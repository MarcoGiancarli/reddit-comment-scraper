Wish I had waited now.    So far what I can see are improvements in graphics, AI, and lighting over the original Metro 2033. Other than that, it is pretty much the same game as the original - no new maps or anything. I still think it is worth it though for those improvements, it is a better game than the original.    Metro Last Light Redux was also released on GOG."

GOG has no DRM so I might as well torrent the game files. But that's not what I want either.   I want to rid myself from Steam and acquire my past and future games with a distributor that has less user subjugating policies. If the games are on both platforms, it shouldn't matter to the developers.  Up side: GOG gets my customer loyalty, I get botnet free game downloads. Their downside: I might use bandwidth to download an old game that I didn't purchase with them. GOG could take the hit and write it off as a measure to win over customers or charge a reasonable one time fee.  Purchasing a game twice, only because its offered by two different distribution platforms, now that is beyond me. But it goes to show what DRM culture has turned people into."
gog,3e41j5,Balorat,3,Wed Jul 22 01:11:48 2015 UTC,"it would be nice if it did but it doesn't work that way, your purchase on steam is bound to steam, it basically says so either in the steam legal stuff, you have to accept when installing steam, or in each EULA of the games (I'm not sure which, but it's in there). As it is now, steam has way more users/customers than GOG, they can't simply offer those for instance who own Darksiders on steam (like me), Darksiders on GOG as the company who owns Darksiders (formerly THQ now Nordic i think) wants money from GOG from every copy the ""give out"". The only thing you can do is to wait for a GOG Sale they are frequent, and then buy the games you have on steam again on GOG, which is what I'm doing right now."

It sucks to be in that position, but I would rather see people pointed to alternative legal-ish methods, such as buying through a VPN or proxy to disguise the country of origin.   Take a hypothetical situation. A publisher is considering to allow GOG to distribute their titles, but a quick search finds they can get the GOG versions without payment. That may discourage them from partnering with GOG. Of course you could find the DRM cracked versions on a torrent too, but I guess I am saying don't give them any more ammunition."

For remaining GOG game INSTALLATIONS  Find the game in the Library (click on the image of the game), then click the More button and select ""Manage"" -> ""Import folder"" and point the folder selector into the folder where that game is installed.  Please be aware that Client will accept any folder pointed to and will overwrite files inside it (this can for example wipe some mods or damage other apps in case of pointing to a wrong folder) and will update the game to the newest version (current default language English)."

Typically however download speeds are generally pretty good on GOG, if you continue to have issues I suggest contacting support because something is going on between your connection & GOG,. GOG support is generally much better than Steam support.  You could also try downloading with the old GOG downloader. One downloaded, go to account -> game -> MORE -> GOG Downloader Links.  Galaxy is still in beta, so you may experience some issues. I get those errors every now and then, especially with very large games, but it has been way less frequent then it use to be.

gog,3d9ioj,MrFaucyPaunts,4,Tue Jul 14 15:38:20 2015 UTC,"Almost none of the games in my library that I feel like playing are available for Linux, and most of them are just DOSbox'd anyway. So, it's nearly-useful for me on that platform (Mac OS X slightly less-so, but it at least has several games I want to play on it).  I also don't like how when the *.deb packages install into /opt/GOG Games/<GAME>, the directory is world-writable. Anyone can theoretically go into the directory and modify the maintenance/uninstallation scripts in there, and add or remove anything they want. So someone could add something like rm -rf /* to them, and when Dpkg/Apt updates or removes the game, it'd execute whatever was put in there. I view it as a huge security hole, so I don't use the *.debs GOG distributes, which eliminates some convenience for me.  Honestly, gaming on Linux (on any distribution service) is barren for me, since they're mostly small indie-games with a small handful of AAA games. I don't foresee anything displacing Windows for PC gaming anytime soon, at least as far as having a wide selection of games to play."

Randomly modifying files & permissions of package-manager-installed files is not something I'm a fan of, since changes can be clobbered in the future and I would have to remember to do make the changes if I ever reinstalled/updated those packages.  That, and if I'm going to be on an Ubuntu or an Ubuntu-derivative, the point of using it is to have a  ""Just Works"" experience and I don't want to mess with any grit or daily tweaking. If I did, then I'd use another distro conducive to customizing & messing-around, like Arch Linux et all.  I know it's not a big deal to open a CLI and enter a few commands as root (I practically live in the command-line with vim & tmux), but I'm at a point where I want one of two things on a Linux distro: Either a) make a shitload of assumptions about me and work perfectly for my needs out-of-the-box, or b) a bare system where I have complete control and things just stay out of my way.  </overly_verbose>"

gog,3d9ioj,Balorat,2,Tue Jul 14 23:10:46 2015 UTC,"In that aspect GoG is awesome, not just the linux versions, though I only use the archive versions, as, like /u/salsadoom I use arch, and also like him it needs an linux version of Galaxy, not just for easier downloads but also to see at a glance which games are installed and which not. Outside the actual linux version of games, GoG is great for its installer and wine. Back when I first came to GoG, the first game I bought was Arcanum, as I had heard that, other than the CD-Version, which I had and unsuccessfully tried to install via wine numerous times, the GoG version would work. And work it did and still does."

I'm fine with command line programs but it can be tricky to use sometimes and there's no autoupdate feature.  (lgogdownloader isn't exactly aptitude.)  I'd really like to see a Linux Galaxy client soon.  Beyond that minor annoyance I'm pretty happy."
gog,3d9ioj,salsadoom,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:35:45 2015 UTC,"Well, as far as the oldies go its alright. I run arch so.. not a .deb based distro, although the tarballs seem to work just fine for me with few problems, I think I had to tweak a dosbox config slightly for.. uh Darklands maybe? I think it had to do with my dual monitor display -- which every ""part-time"" linux developer seems to have a problem with sadly. I forget how I fixed though but it was simple anyway.  Its not a bad experience, but lets be honest: It needs Galaxy because I'm not going to go downloading patches for games like I did in the 90's, that time is over. Geez even downloading tarballs reminds me of the old days, and really its not welcome when say, Steam just automagically does it.   The selection is alright, although there are a few missing options (WITCHER 3). Being a bit blunt, right now if the game is on both gog and steam I'd get it on steam because its less hassle there. When Galaxy is out for Linux this may change as I prefer gog's policies -- but the #1 most important thing is that I can effortlessly play my games and gog on linux doesn't do a good job of that yet.   Going a bit more long term and a bit more technical, its going to run into problems that steam is avoiding with its ""steamos runtime"" setup. That setup avoids a lot of problems and gog should/will have too get on board with something like that, if not exactly that. For oldies running in dosbox it doesn't matter, but for new titles it will be an issue."

The Steam version needs that because the binaries are encrypted for some reason and Universal Widescreen relies on them being decrypted. As the GOG version is entirely DRM-free, the binaries are not encrypted either, and you can use Universal Widescreen right away.  In fact, squizzy's patch is a No-CD crack for an older version even. There are respective cracks for the latest patch, however, so PCGW is even out of date in that regard.  Are you actually using Flawless Widescreen or the Universal Widescreen patch?

gog,3d7xag,Onihikage,2,Tue Jul 14 19:59:04 2015 UTC,"The header looks weird.  I think the tagline ""Where DRM Free Gamers Are Born"" should instead be ""Where DRM-Free Gamers Are Born"" (add a hyphen) and it should use a font which matches that of the GOG logo as closely as possible.  The ""Achievement unlocked"" graphic is badly aliased at 100% zoom, and blurry at other zoom levels.  I think you could stand to emulate the colors of the official site a lot more - associate green with mouseovers, make more use of shades of pale grey, and a sparing use of dark grey. Use purple only for GOG Galaxy-related things, like the ""Achievement"" graphic I already mentioned.  The top banner needs much less purple (at least for me at 1080p, it's well over half purple) and more neutral tones; the part on the left with the planets ought to be replaced with something more physical and more generically ""gaming"", like an assortment of game covers.  I don't even know what the Teddy-Snoo is all about, it doesn't seem related to GOG. Honestly, if it wasn't for the smattering of GOG logos, I'd have no idea I was on the GOG subreddit.  Sorry if all this seems harsh, but I want it to be better, and nothing gets better without criticism."
gog,3d7xag,Onihikage,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:55:09 2015 UTC,"This image is at 1920x1080 and what browser? Is this zoomed in or zoomed out? I have not checked all resolutions yet but it does not look like this for me. Will look into this, but if it's like that zoomed in or out, then it won't likely be fixed. I am optimizing for 100% zoom on 1024 x 768 and above. The tag-line hyphen I can and probably will change, as far as the font I don't know what GOG uses. The font looks good regardless. EDIT: Hyphen added. I'll improve the Galaxy achievement image soon if I can, got a bigger and more clear version of the pic to work with but I'm not sure how it will work out. Scaling it down to fit, might still cause issues. There is just not many good large GOG related pictures to use floating around the net. EDIT: Image should be a little larger and clearer now. The site is petty colorless really and a lot of users complain about the grey colors. Galaxy is new and the future of GOG's business so I would like to implement that more. The purple background is the actual banner which is a repeating image, this likely won't change. It's not easy to accommodate most resolutions not just 1080p and still keep it looking nice. The planets image is layered over and is a pic used by GOG for Galaxy which is why it was used. I could make it bigger but it it would cover to much on lower resolutions. It is. The GOGbear is what you get whenever GOG has an issue or GOG servers are overloaded. I would like a better unique snoo, but that would require someone who can make graphics from scratch which is not me. If you or someone else can do that then feel free to contact me with something.   Criticism is fine, just remember these decisions were not made lightly and if we did something a certain way, there is probably a good reason for it. ;)"

I was under the impression that the client's style is actually almost exactly like the store, but perhaps you mean this page?

New Vegas is more a true FO3 than FO3 was because it is set in the western USA and has factions/heavy lore stuff related to 1 & 2.    FO3 is good for what it is, but a lot of the stuff seems kind of shoehorned in (Harold for example) and feels forced at times where NV feels more natural since it is more of a natural successor.  It helps that Obsidian has developers that worked on the original games as well.  I often find that fans of the originals who played them at release tend to love NV over 3 and those who played 3 first tend to love 3 over NV.  I hope that 4 can build upon the positives of 3 & NV and become a sequel worthy of the Fallout name.  It also helps that I am originally from Massachusetts so I am excited over it being set in the Boston area."

If When hackers guess or hack their way to one of your passwords on one of the sites you're using, they will inevitably try the same password on other sites and services.  As a company, taking security seriously means taking measures to prevent this from being a security problem, and implementing Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is an easy and cheap way of protecting your users.  MFA means you need more than just the password to log in, or at least to make purchases or changes to your account, YMMV. Typically, after entering your password you'll have to punch in a one time code sent to you by email or text message, or from a device or an app.  With MFA, an attacker will need more than your password to abuse your account, and since most attackers go after low hanging fruits they'll most likely move on to easier targets.

gog,3c0hil,Christ-Centered,3,Sat Jul 4 13:25:34 2015 UTC,"Higher ores can be found deeper underground, you can also get Demonite/Crimite ore from killing the Eye of Cthulhu boss and killing the eater of worlds/Brain of Cthulhu. You can spawn them by crafting their summoning items: The suspicious looking eye(6 lenses at a demon/crimson altar)  or Worm Food(30 vile powder and 15 rotten chunks)/Bloody Spine(15 vertebrae). The eye can only be summoned at night while the Eater/Brain can be only summoned in the corruption/crimsion biomes which are the purple or blood red biomes. The bosses can also be spawned without using a summoning item, the eye has a chance of appearing at night on it's own if you haven't already defeated it and the eye or eater will spawn if you smash three crim hearts or shadow orbs in the corruption/crimsion.     The tiers of ores are(for those who don't know them) pre-hardmode: Tin/Copper: which can be found on the following layers surface, underground and cavern   Iron/Lead: surface, underground and caverns  Gold/Platinum: Underground and Cavern   Metorite: from fallen meteorites that spawn after you smash a shadow orb or crim heart in the corruption or crimson   Demonite/Criminite: rare finds underground and cavern layers, dropped from Eye of Cthulhu, Eater or Brain of Cthulhu needs either Shadow Scale or Tissue Samples(also dropped by the Eater of worlds or the Brain) to make a pick and armor.   Hellstone: found in the lowest level of the world usually in lava, needs to be mixed with obsidian(made from mixing lava and water) as well as needing a hellforge which can be found in the buildings in the lowest levels of the world and yes you can dig them up and take then back to your base."

I'm sick of being tied to a client for gaming and frankly, Steam support has proven lackluster in their responses to scammers and issues with in game items. I don't know why I even bought games on there but for now on, I think I'll be DRM free. I'm reading over everything in this subreddit to find out more information about going DRM free and to learn more about GoG. Thanks for the link."

We've done some friend requests posts before to get everybody some friends to chat with and maybe play games with. We also have talked about bunch about the client and are trying our best to leave feedback with the team to make it better. Point is though you'll like going over to GoG it's nice good people good games and really great support staff.

gog,3bzrkv,RagingMayo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:35:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah this would never happen on GoG. There once was a case, when Bethesda revoked the offering of Fallout 1, 2 and Tactics on GoG, but the staff of GoG gave anyone the possibility to grab the games for free before it is ultimately gone. Everyone who aquired the games on GoG before it was removed from the store still owned them afterwards, so they could still download and play them whenever they want (DRM-free).   Otherwise if GoG receives notice that games are to be removed from the store, the games will be put on a heavy sale for anyone to grab. Though some might argue that this could be a marketing stunt. ;)  You can also add your GoG-username here: http://www.gog.com/forum/general/rgog_friend_forum_post  In the thread are already others who you can invite to your friend list. Note that you can only add other users via the forums so far. Hover over their profile icon on the forums and a popup will appear which gives you the option to invite them.   Sadly there isn't an instant message notification in the client yet, so you might see that you received a message long after it was sent to you."

gog,3bqst1,RagingMayo,3,Wed Jul 1 17:39:42 2015 UTC,"Well, it's a fairly popular and highly appraised game (5 stars on gog, 96% on Steam and 8,5 on Metacritic). Game came out in 2011 and still feels fresh with all these free content updates. It's the best value for money you can find out there, unless it's not your cup of tea (rare occasion).  Think of a mix of exploration, progression-based action adventure featuring dungeons with lots of mobs and bosses, unique drops and sandbox world to shape at your will ala Minecraft.  Creations are a big part of the game and you can literally spend hours building anything you want using lots of building materials.  Alternatively you can progress through the game and its bosses. It has thought-out gear progression and not much grinding. It doesn't feature xp though (there are mods that do however), all character building is based on gear, health and mana.   The game's highlight is the unique gear you can find. You can pull amazing tricks that don't seem possible at first. The unique items and the feeling you get when first discovering each one is what makes the game for me.  A possible con is that the game just puts you in the world with no help or a clear goal (latest update brings achievements) - just a guide npc who helps you with crafting recipes. If you cannot progress you may wanna use one of the two wikis available but don't spoil yourself too much :P (Simple Wiki) (Official/Detailed Wiki)  The game is 2D but has superb sprites and effects (lots of gore too - can be turned off).    Even though solo play is superb, many people are addicted to online multiplayer (like Minecraft). It has many active multiplayer servers and communities where you can play all sorts of game modes. I personally play it coop (via local LAN) with one other player and it is one of the best gaming experiences I have ever had.  There are mods too, but I am not sure if they work well with the gog version (game was originally on Steam and most modders used to support the Steam version only). I have played countless hours and never got to try them. This tells a lot about the original content.  On the other hand, I have downloaded lots of player-made worlds (adventure maps, quests, arenas etc). It's amazing what people can make with the world creation tools. Just to give an example, I recall a world that played like a fully-scripted Zelda game! Without using any scripts or mods, just original game assets.  Sorry for the long response but if there is a game to write lots of stuff about, it certainly is this one :)"
gog,3bqst1,lordxi,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:30:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the well-thought-out response! No problem, I read the whole post and enjoyed it. I actually prefer story-based games, but maybe I could just give it a try. Do you have to invest a lot of time to get something done or, let's say, is it a heavily grinding-based game?

gog,3bete6,Asialfred,5,Sun Jun 28 15:59:33 2015 UTC,"I just want to address the part of the question whether it is possible to play those games in multiplayer. I can't answer you whether there are still people who play those games, since I don't know anything about them.  I guess the classic option is Hamachi or the several other clients which work like it. I would want to name one example (though there are quite a few more) which is Tunngle.  I used it back in the days, when I occasionally played Warcraft 3 with my best friend. I think it must have evolved quite a lot since then.   If you haven't heard of Hamachi and the like, I'll try to explain it. The principle is simple. The client is creating a virtual LAN connection with somebody else. The other person who you want to play with must be running this program as well. Then you can play your games in multiplayer over the internet. The only requirement here is that the game supports multiplayer via LAN.  The Tunngle client is offering certain networks which can be used as chat rooms. There you can connect with other Tunngle users. You can then play your favourite games with other people over the internet in this virtual LAN environments. But you have to be in the same network to make it work. So it's like gaming on a LAN party, just over the internet.   There are also clients like GameRanger, Garena and some more.  I hope I could explain it comprehensibly."
gog,3bete6,RagingMayo,3,Sun Jun 28 18:09:07 2015 UTC,I played some Unreal Tournament 2004 a few weeks ago. It worked well and I was able to find games with players. Of course everyone still playing UT2004 is really good now lol.

gog,3bd260,questionman1,21,Sun Jun 28 01:53:02 2015 UTC,"The purpose of Galaxy is to help attract those who prefer the convience of a client as well as being able to give developers the ability to add or keep features such as achivements, a easier to use multiplayer tool set, easy updating, ect.  as one of the big issues GOG had in getting bigger titles was having to strip features like that out of the GOG releases such as Spelunky having the daily challenges stripped out due to it using Steamworks, Galaxy's API in theory is meant to allow devs to keep that kind of stuff in. Plus having features like that stripped out also hurts sales of the games since it can be considered the inferior version.   Will it become mandatory? doubtful. While GOG has changed it's business model quite a bit since it first launched years back but the one big selling point has always been No DRM and in a crowded space where Steam is king and most of the more established rivals for Steam are basically Steam clones(i.e. requiring a client) it wouldn't be in GOG's best interest in the long term to just be another store front that is tied to a client. DRM free is what sets GOG apart and has been helping them get to the position they are in now, so as I said it's in their best interest to keep it that way or risk getting lost in the shuffle and end up like dead like Direct2Drive, Gametap, Impulse and from current reports Desura."
gog,3bd260,MrDCT,11,Sun Jun 28 02:24:45 2015 UTC,"Currently, the use of Galaxy is entirely optional.  As for future plans, only GOG knows, but since games are DRM free, requiring Galaxy would be adding DRM, so I don't see that happening in the near future."

The worst case scenario I could see happening would be if the stopped support for the downloader and http downloads and the galaxy client was the only way to get games on your machine.  However they already have download data and nothing would be keeping you from exiting Galaxy and running the game outside of it."

The Steam Store was added many years later.  GoG Galaxy is a library browser/downloader/update manager and instant messenger, and soon will add gamification   such as in-game achievements and I imagine Steam-like account profiles with showcases of which games you own and play.  Gamification is an aspect of Steam that many users enjoy and Galaxy is supposed to bring that to the GoG community."

gog,3bd260,runnerofshadows,3,Sun Jun 28 18:28:36 2015 UTC,"Well, Galaxy made me seriously consider GoG as a viable player in the industry where I want to spend money on. I like environments, and it to be contained inside that environment I'm busy with. I install and exe, shortcuts mess up all the desktop, and I have to remember that I have a certain title installed to go look it up in windows. I'm happy I can just draw up some list with all the titles I own and pick from there, or seamlessly go to the store to pick up new.   There are games I bought solely for the gamification of it in Steam as well. The achievements in Surgeon Simulator are like challenges in the game and extend the playtime a whole lot more.   The seamless integration of multiplayer games is another one. Just see someone in your friends list playing something and want to drop in? More than once I clicked the ""join game"" button for people playing TF2, natural selection 2, elite dangerous, CS:GO, Rust, Payday 2,...  Even in Origin with Battlefield that option is used. Social coherence is so important as is shown with the downfall of Myspace, the limited popularity of G+ and the continued popularity of facebook even after so many privacy atrocities.   The same argument is for Big Picture mode. Finally you can have a seamless 10ft experience on PC with a controller on your couch. For the first time in literally 11 years this made me look at the current televisions of today to extend my gaming setup with :) (nota bene: it sucks though. 4K televisions have input lag of about 70ms which is just too much to handle)  The use of a client - or a good API so many third party clients could make plugins for say Kodi and Plex is so unmissable in todays competition I cannot believe GoG didn't start earlier with it. You only get so far with offering a better service. It's marketing and user experience that brings in the other half of the people. - Or apple wouldn't be so popular as it is today if people just went for the ""better platform"".

On the renaming itself (which you didn't ask): Retro games sell well, but are not extremely lucrative. They re-branded because they wanted to broaden their market -- their new shtick is simply being a DRM-free, region and consumer friendly, curated game distributor. The good thing is that now we get many new titles by indie developers who are also supportive of the DRM-free mindset. So we get to support more indie developers who endorse a consumer-first market.

gog,3ayyx2,reaffi,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:07:24 2015 UTC,As I pointed out features such as multiplayer or online daily challenges. For example Spelnunky and OlliOlli on GOG both don't have their daily challenges because the daily challenges were tied to Steamworks and since GOG didn't have a alternative they stripped those features out. Same was true of Unepic for sometime which also had the multiplayer stripped out but was later reimplemented via a non-steamworks P2P system.

gog,3awrfv,Gateway2009,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:33:02 2015 UTC,"I don't have the gog version of FO2 but I only tried a few other games I own: Baldur's Gate TOS and BG2 Complete (i.e. the old versions), Caesar 3 and I think Alpha Centauri. I, too, was primarily concerned with the performance of old games since I was afraid of more of them becoming obsolete and unworkable with Windows 10.  BG1 and BG2 work out of the box but I prefer to use a 3rd-party DirectDraw wrapper (I used Arqit's ddwrapper) to improve performance, same as I do with Win 8.1.  Unfortunately I missed out on the gog versions of the original Fallout games but if they work on 8.1 they will probably work the same on 10. Might require the fan-patches for optimal performance though."

gog,3ansr0,hannes3120,7,Mon Jun 22 01:00:05 2015 UTC,"I think there should be a specific subreddit for key trading   This should be an informational subreddit where you can get news, deals and discussion - if I want funny content I go to other subreddits..."
gog,3ansr0,Gateway2009,2,Mon Jun 22 09:51:48 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree with hannes here but the key trading idk if it could be handled well and in a manner that prevents key stealing bots I'd be fine with it. I think that's due to wanting the community here to grow.
gog,3ansr0,hannes3120,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:54:06 2015 UTC,Thats why I think there should be a subReddit completely dedicated to KeyTrades like it is with steam - there you could implement some sort of rating system for users or something similar   I'd say GiveAways are fine here since there usually aren't that many - but it might get too confusing with trade offers between news and discussions
gog,3ansr0,mark2uk,2,Mon Jun 22 11:20:23 2015 UTC,I have to agree key giveaways are infrequent. Maybe if there are a lot being generated it would be sensible to make a separate post called 'give aways during the sale' ... a whole sub-reddit seems like trying to use a JCB to hammer a nail
gog,3ansr0,Gateway2009,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:32:53 2015 UTC,Yeah I can agree with that.
gog,3ansr0,LaronX,4,Mon Jun 22 19:59:40 2015 UTC,For big sales a giveaway mega thread might work. But in the long run there is /r/randomactsofgaming and /r/giftofgaming for that kind of stuff. It would be silly to makea new one. As far as trading goes it would probably be a good idea to make a dedicated trading one for GoG like stramtrades.

gog,3aouof,MidKnight_Corsair,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:00:33 2015 UTC,I started out playing through Steam for screens hots and got no achievements. Adding Galaxy to Steam and then launching Witcher should work though. That said even running through Galaxy I've still only had 2 of the 10 or so achievements unlock that should have.
gog,3aouof,DakotaThrice,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:27:43 2015 UTC,"So I have to launch the client... from another client? lol  Alright thanks, guess that works. Do achievements have a bad rep in Galaxy? Fairly new to it, so I don't really know"
gog,3aouof,DakotaThrice,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:37:43 2015 UTC,You could try using command line parameters to launch the game through Galaxy but I wouldn't know where to start on that though I have heard of it being used on other client based games.  There been times when I've had to add Origin/Uplay/Battle.net to.Steam in order to get the overlay and such to work.
gog,3alnqt,TheLawlessMan,2,Sun Jun 21 12:51:09 2015 UTC,Do you have your heart set on using Galaxy or do you just want to play the game? If the latter you can download the standalone installer directly from your library under the ACCOUNT heading on the gog.com website.
gog,3alnqt,pingus3233,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:11:27 2015 UTC,I would rather use Galaxy. I hate trying to keep up with what games I own whenever I wipe a PC so clients like steam and galaxy are good for me. How do I do it?
gog,3alnqt,pingus3233,3,Sun Jun 21 14:17:00 2015 UTC,"You are ostensibly doing things correctly but have encountered a bug. Keep in mind Galaxy is beta software and has its fair share of bugs.  Here are a few suggestions you can try:  [0. First try to log into the gog.com site and make sure your credentials work there too because the problem might be with your account] 1. Using Galaxy log out and try to log in again 2. Uninstall and reinstall Galaxy, then try again 3. Wait and see if the problem is fixed from the gog.com side      Other than that I got nothing."
gog,3ai49z,Redstahli,15,Sat Jun 20 11:52:12 2015 UTC,"GOG, unlike Steam, actually does curation, so I thoroughly approve.  As long as GOG continues it's quality control I can't fault them for deciding to not carry a game that is against their branding.  That said Hatred didn't deserve all the flak it got...but I'm sure it actually did a lot for boosting sales."
gog,3ai49z,BobVosh,2,Sat Jun 20 15:30:14 2015 UTC,"They sell both Postals, and Hatred seems like similar in content and quality. I don't buy that it is quality control."
gog,3ai49z,lonelycircus,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:59:13 2015 UTC,"Difference is, the Postal games are rated M, while Hatred is rated AO."
gog,3ai49z,Mo145678,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:53:08 2015 UTC,"Hatred is similar to at least Postal 1, Postal 2 is more of a first person sandbox game where each day your given a set of basic tasks to do like Monday: Get Paycheck, go to bank and cash check, buy milk and all you need to do to progress is do those tasks, granted the game does go out of it's way to make those tasks hard, like when you go and get your check you get fired in a very annoying fashion and a bunch of annoying anti-game protesters that are hanging outside come storming in guns blazing forcing you to either run for it or fight them off since this is a sandbox type game your free to handle situations as you choose but it does try to goad you into just getting violent with the people in the game.   For me the way I personally see it is Postal 1 is selling for 5-6 dollars while Hatred is selling for 20 and Hatred really doesn't do much new outside of adding some really nice destructible environments and the ability to drive vehicles which aren't that good since they blow up way to easily and also the game has a terrible checkpoint system where you have to earn respawn tokens from doing set tasks in the level like burn all the money in the bank or kill all the cops in the police station. If you don't have one of those you have to start all the way from the beginning of the level which is pretty easy to do since it's easy to get surrounded by gun toting vigilantes and cops or even hit by a car which is a instant death.  Plus the game is quite short and doesn't add much in replay value.    So it's possible GOG didn't feel that it was worth 20 bucks.  Hatred is not a terrible game but it's not a great game as it's very repetitive, monotonous and short.  So again it's possible GOG felt that it wasn't worth the asking price. Not saying that is the case just a more plausible reason then some of the ones I have seen both in this thread and in many of the Hatred threads on the GOG forums.. usually saying that it was fear of SJW's or whatever label you wish to use, forced them to deny the game, I would be surprised if that was the case since really those who people labeled ""SJWs"" are just your typical internet vocal minority which has as much power as just about any other vocal minority on the internet. Now if they had say the connections that say fundementalists in the US have then I would worry.. but as it stands they are just a very small but vocal minority with no real power outside of being very vocal.   Edit: another possibility is that it's just one of those games GOG rejected for no clear reason or some reason that makes sense to them. I mean they had in the past rejected games for weird reasons like Xenonauts was once rejected for being to high of a price for a Indie. Thomas was Alone and Braid were also rejected for unknown reasons, Cat Lady was rejected initally as well but was quickly accepted after a stink was made by the community, so was Avernum: Escape from the Pit, Nethergate Ressurection, ect. GOG can be like Steam was before Valve decided to stop duration were games get rejected for no clear reason. Difference is GOG claims to actually test the games first while Valve never did."
gog,3ai49z,MrDCT,0,Mon Jun 22 01:30:14 2015 UTC,I got the impression from Reddit that the Postal games are actually good games as opposed to Hatred.
gog,3ai49z,Roondak,6,Sun Jun 21 17:40:42 2015 UTC,"I think it's a business decision like any other, and will not change the way I approach them as a company. I so not know anything about the game except it is supposed to be 'controversial'. Will it include rape? Rape of minors? Rape of minors after gruesome scenes of torture? No idea, but probably people at GoG do and decided if the possible PR backlash would be worth it and made an informed decision.  Or some other reason, maybe it wasn't economically viable to secure licenses at a price that would guarantee a good enough margin.   At the end of the day it's good to have competition and people who want to buy Hatred can get it from Steam. For me GoG is always the first choice, unless steam has a game at an incredibly low price at the exact moment when I want to play it. I like how they work and I want to support them, but somethime they cannot give me what I want and I buy elsewhere."
gog,3ai49z,schrodingers_lolcat,2,Sat Jun 20 12:04:49 2015 UTC,"Wasn't Hatred rated AO? If so then GOG does not carry AO games, why would they make an exception for this game.   You can argue all day about whether or not Hatred should have been rate AO by the ESRB but that is not GOG's problem."
gog,3ai49z,stealthxero,2,Sat Jun 20 19:28:46 2015 UTC,They carry the uncut AO version of Indigo Prophecy/Fahrenheit https://www.gog.com/game/fahrenheit_indigo_prophecy  as well as the uncensored version of Leisure Suit Larry Magna Cum Laude https://www.gog.com/game/leisure_suit_larry_magna_cum_laude_uncut_and_uncensored So it can't be that.
gog,3ai49z,MrDCT,2,Mon Jun 22 01:25:08 2015 UTC,"From what I have seen of it, would I consider Hatred a good game? No  Do I think it is trying too hard to be controversial to generate interest and they hope sales? Yes  Would I buy the game? Probably not  Do I think a game which should be banned because I think it is poor taste or not something that appeals to me should be banned? no   Here is the real problem and we have seen it in Australia with GTA5... groups who dislike something because it doesn't fit their moral code believe they have the right to tell other people whether than can or can't have something.   We even saw it with popular music when Tipper Gore ledge the charge to try and sensor the music industry in early 90s.   These people failed to grasp your moral code is intended to shape your actions and what you do, not what others do.   Nobody I've met has been worthy to cast the first stone, so I say be honest about what the content is and let people decide if they want to own it or not."
gog,3ai49z,mark2uk,3,Wed Jun 24 01:42:04 2015 UTC,"There's no real controversy.  It's not a very good game, and GOG didn't feel like selling it.  The only controversy is manufactured."
gog,3ai49z,j_rodman,3,Sat Jun 20 18:03:46 2015 UTC,"GOG sells plenty of games that have horrible reviews (both critics and user reviews).  Saying ""It's not a very good game"" isn't a valid argument."
gog,3ai49z,Totenglocke42,2,Sat Jun 20 18:08:21 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't think the game itself is offensive or anything. It does not take itself seriously and after all gog already sells games like Postal. The only thing this game has that's any different is that it has controversy behind it and any decision would've caused a backlash by some people.   Honestly, I don't see the problem with selling the game, it works, it's not a piece of shit like those things Steam sells and it's not any worse than other games already on sale on gog but they can decide to do whatever they want with their store and while I think it's not the best decision I'm not going to stop liking them for it."
gog,3ai49z,shinatsuhikosness,3,Sat Jun 20 14:01:58 2015 UTC,"It's entirely a media-created bullshit fest.  Hatred is exactly like 100's if not 1000's of other games.    The only difference is that it dispensed with the bullshit story lines that are very poorly written anyway.  I understand the business decision to avoid media attention, but at the same time I lose respect for the shops that refuse to sell a title that isn't anywhere as violent as others which they are happy to sell."

gog,3ai49z,samuraistalin,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:57:59 2015 UTC,"If the reason is the game ""being problematic"", then yes. Is there any public announcement out there from gog? Until that I'll just assume that's the case.  Censorship can work in many ways.   You can decide not to sell a game because  -problems with the developer -they're Polish too and someone from the hatred Dev team stole one girlfriend from one of Gog's owners. -bad game -bad negotiations -hundred reasons -just because it's your shop and you do whatever you like  Without an announcement they're telling us, ""hey look, we sell postal and carmaggedon, but we'll jump in the circlejerk of censorship and ban hatred from our store because we want to be white knights"".  It's a shame because I was looking to buy it on gog to have my drmfree copy. I don't want anyone tell me what I can or cannot play, or decide from me what is OK to buy or not. I'm a grown up boy and can do that myself.  So I'll go to the stores that have it.  And the comparison between postal and hatred... Well, if you know hatred you have to understand all this is just a soccer's moms bullshit drama.  What will you ban next time? Shadow warrior 2 for violence? Bloodrayne for sexism? What is this? Poland in the 20th century before the wall fall?  Bad business decision."
gog,3ai49z,pungentstentch,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:30:23 2015 UTC,"First of all I want to clarify I think they should've allowed the game on their store, but claiming it's somehow censorship is going too far.  Censorship is, as the name says, censoring, supressing free speech and ideals. There's a huge difference between trying to eliminate a piece of media because of the values and ideas it spreads and just not stocking a game. If Steam decided to stop selling bullshit like Guise of The Wolf or anything made by Digital Homicide no one would be saying it's censorship, would they?   It's a shame because I was looking to buy it on gog to have my drmfree copy. I don't want anyone tell me what I can or cannot play, or decide from me what is OK to buy or not.   No one is doing that. And just as you said you can't tell GOG what to sell or not to sell. If you want to play the game you can still play it."
gog,3ai49z,shinatsuhikosness,2,Sat Jun 20 16:42:36 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree you, I'm trying to say I'm disappointed gog haven't done yet a proper explanation why they don't sell it, yes it's your store and you can't fuck it how you want, but you're sending a bad message to some of your customers.  If I'm trying to be a new model and base my future and success in the market of digital video gaming distancing myself from others stores bad habits, to not sell a video game because bad pr is a pretty bad way to show it."
gog,3ai49z,pungentstentch,0,Sat Jun 20 16:47:38 2015 UTC,"A store refusing to sell a game because it's problematic is actually censorship, yes.  It's like when Target Australia refused to sell GTA V. Same idea. They're trying to get their customers to not play the game, as well as not be associated with it.  With that said I'm still fine with it. GoG doesn't sell shitty games, at least not most of the time, and Hatred is pretty shit. It just bothers me that it's because it's ""Too violent for us"" and not ""We don't sell shitty games""."
gog,3ai49z,Shujinco2,2,Sat Jun 20 16:51:51 2015 UTC,"Right, so I assume a children's bookstore not selling ""50 Shades of Grey"" because they don't consider it suits their store is censorship too..."
gog,3ai49z,shinatsuhikosness,3,Sat Jun 20 16:54:45 2015 UTC,"yeah but let's be fair here, GoG isn't a ""children's book store."" They're JUST a book store, who sells all kinds of books of many types. And being a general book store that refuses to sell ""50 Shades of Grey"" because they find the bondage lifestyle disgraceful would be ethical censorship.  What you're trying to argue here is more akin to my second point, where in GoG was a gamestore that only sold GOOD games and Hatred wasn't one of those so it doesn't get in. Which, as I said before, makes actual sense to me."
gog,3ai49z,Shujinco2,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:29:26 2015 UTC,GOG is just a store that decided not to stock one particular game. I don't see the problem here. I just don't agree with that decision.
gog,3ai49z,shinatsuhikosness,2,Sun Jun 21 03:23:22 2015 UTC,"Well the idea is that they decided not to based on ideology. They're a store front. I'm not very comfortable with a storefront deciding for me what is and what isn't ethical. Just like I'm not comfortable with ANYONE deciding for me what is and isn't ethical. Their job is to supply games we may like to play. If they think we might not like to play it because it's bad or glitchy or a scam, fair enough. But if they decide we don't want to play it because of what's in the game itself, I'm not comfortable with that."
gog,3ai49z,Shujinco2,2,Sun Jun 21 09:43:56 2015 UTC,"Christian book stores decide what not to sell their customers all the time. Just because you sell a product, that does not mean you have to sell all types of that product. I don't expect Walmart to sell porn DVD's just because they sell DVD's. The idea that a storefront has to sell every game title they can is flawed."
gog,3ai49z,exe973,-1,Sat Jun 20 19:33:18 2015 UTC,"Just because you sell a product, that does not mean you have to sell all types of that product   No shit they have the right to do that. The idea is that GoG is clearly not against having those types of games in their store. If it's not a simple case of it being a shitty game/being a blanket ban on AO games, then it's a clear PR move. Plain and simple."
gog,3ai49z,Shujinco2,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:32:40 2015 UTC,"Their job is to supply games we may like to play.   So I take it you boycott Walmart because they dont' sell Hustler magazines or movies?  Same with Netflix since they don't show hardcore porn?  What about NBC, Fox, CBS, or any other TV station that doesn't air R and XXX rated movies during the middle of the day? If you don't have a problem with those things then your argument is bullshit since why do those things get to decide what they will or will not carry but GoG doesn't?    Your argument is basically bitching that a Christian book store doesn't carry copies of the Satanic Bible.  It is your right to buy the Satanic bible but its not the Christian book store's responsibility to carry the Satanic Bible.  Calling it censorship is bullshit and you know it."
gog,3ai49z,psycho_admin,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:29:01 2015 UTC,"So I take it you boycott Walmart because they dont' sell Hustler magazines or movies?   They don't sell anything like that whatsoever, so that would be consistant.   Same with Netflix since they don't show hardcore porn?    They DO however have Human Centipede.   What about NBC, Fox, CBS, or any other TV station that doesn't air R and XXX rated movies during the middle of the day?   Again, they have consistant guidelines about what they show. GoG doesn't really have that as far as I can tell. Also pretty sure I HAVE seen R rated movies in the middle of the day.  The idea is that GoG sells video games. They even sell VIOLENT video games. They don't have a consistent ""We don't have violent video games"" policy as far as I'm aware, so the idea of the arbitrarily picking Hatred for ideological reasons is a bit silly.  Of course I do suspect this has to do with the game's rating and not exactly that it's simply just hatred. Which WOULD mean there is a line of consistency there.  But no, none of the examples you gave actually are actually relevant. It'd be more like if a porn store decided against having a particular porno because it has Nazis in it.  Also definition of censorship, from Vocabulary.com:   To ""censor"" is to review something and to choose to remove or hide parts of it that are considered unacceptable. Censorship is the name for the process or idea of keeping things like obscene word or graphic images from an audience. There is also such a thing as self-censorship, which is when you refrain from saying certain things — or possibly re-wording them — depending on who is listening.   If GoG is withholding this from their stores because they feel like they shouldn't let their customers play it, then it's flat out censorship. Hell even all the examples you gave to me were ALSO censorship.  It's important to note that censorship =/= bad automatically. But I don't think anything that gives us a choice on what we buy from them, ESPECIALLY when they have games equally or more violent than it, should refuse to give us the option of buying from them. I'm simply not comfortable with that."
gog,3ai49z,Shujinco2,-2,Sat Jun 20 19:56:32 2015 UTC,"so the idea of the arbitrarily picking Hatred for ideological reasons is a bit silly.   Show me the statement from GoG that they refused to carry Hatred due to violence.  I will sit here and wait. I will probable die of old age before you find the proof but that's fine because winning an internet argument is the most important thing I have to do with my life, kind of like it's your most important thing to due of claiming someone is censoring you because they don't do what you want them to do.    But no, none of the examples you gave actually are actually relevant.   Actually no they are fully relivent.  Walmart sold 50 shades of grey which was basically penthouse letters and they sell the bluray which is softcore porn (or so I have been told, i haven't actually watched the movie).  Netflix has shown movies such as 9 songs on its streaming which is porn but called ""art"" to include full vaginal penetration and oral sex that ends in ejaculation that they show in its full glory.  So again why aren't you up in arms about them not carrying Hustler?  GoG has not made the statement that you are saying they have that they refuse to carry the game due to its nature.  For all we know they are refusing to carry the game because the offer made to them wasn't good enough.  Or that there is a contract stipulation that they don't like.  Or some from the hatred team once fucked a member of GoG's sister without calling them back the next day.  In the end it comes down to you running your mouth about shit you don't know about claiming people are censoring you.    Do us all a favor and grow the fuck up.  A place not selling something isn't censorship."
gog,3ai49z,psycho_admin,0,Sat Jun 20 18:49:12 2015 UTC,"I agree they should sell the game but that doesn't make it censorship, which was the original argument. I don't agree they're ""deciding for you"" though, they as a store can decide what they want or don't want to sell. You as a consumer still have access to the product through other platforms."
gog,3ai49z,shinatsuhikosness,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:15:57 2015 UTC,"You as a consumer still have access to the product through other platforms.   Well and ultimatly, that's why it's not such a big deal. When Steam did it, everyone was pissed, because Steam was not only willing to allow glitchy, stolen and scammy games on their storefront (Of which Hatred is comparativly super good), but they are the BIGGEST storefront. It felt almost like they were SPECIFICALLY trying to kill the game off.  With GoG, not so much. It's still very in line with their release quality and as such, I'm not actually surprised. Just a bit dissapointed it was about the things in the game instead of the game itself being a bad one."
gog,3ai49z,Shujinco2,-5,Sat Jun 20 19:20:50 2015 UTC,"It is certainly censorship, it's just not government censorship and it's motivation is different.  But it's unquestionably censorship."

gog,3ai49z,shinatsuhikosness,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:37:23 2015 UTC,"GOG usually plays the games that are submitted and like any site or store they know what is selling and what isn't. Do they often reject games that end up seemingly doing well? Sure Xenonauts was initally rejected as were Cat Lady, Unepic, Avernum: Escape from the Pit to name a few and while in those cases they did eventually make it on to the store but for the most part GOG tries to get games that they feel will sell. Hatred really isn't one of those games, sure when it came out it sold 35k copies on Steam and then in less then a week experianced a drop off one that seems to keep going. Since there really isn't much to the game, it's a bland twin stick shooter with a nice graphic style and cool destructible environments and really it's big selling point was the controversy around it once that died down and word got around that this game is really quite tame, people seemed to have quickly lost interest in it hell the average playtime for this game is a whole hour. Not to mention this game was 20 bucks. So more then likely GOG just felt the game wasn't worth putting on the store for it's asking price. Even if one can say ""well they sell Postal 1 and that is the same thing"" it's kinda not since Postal 1 is a older title that is selling on GOG for 5 dollars so while content wise yes it's the same but a infamous game from the 90's selling for 5 dollars is not the same as a game from 2015 with the same content and is just as boring and repeative going for 20 dollars."

gog,3ai49z,OfficialDogeVevo,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:22:49 2015 UTC,It shouldn't be released on GOG because it isn't a good game. That's it. There are good games which happen to be violent and then there are games hat are just violent. It's like comparing SAW to 3 guys 1 hammer.
gog,3ai49z,legion_of_discord,2,Sat Jun 20 23:55:21 2015 UTC,"Well...Privateer 2, Ultima IX, and Postal 2 are not good games but they're for sale. It comes down to brand image. Hatred has an ESRB rating of AO, GOG doesn't sell AO games, therefore they won't be selling Hatred."
gog,3ai49z,psycho_admin,-3,Sun Jun 21 00:09:49 2015 UTC,Honestly here lately GoG has been doing some stuff that makes me not want to spend my money with them.    First was the Witcher 3 licenses thing where gog refused to sell licenses to a competing digital seller and then start talking shit about said competitor and how the licenses may not be valid so people shouldn't buy them.  This alone is bullshit and is the reason I refuse to purchase Witcher 3.  Everyone was up in arms when EA was threatening to pull this very same stunt when EA first released Origin but when gog does it everyone ignores it?  Why?  This action has seriously made me question if they will ever receive any of my money ever again.   Now the whole hatred thing is to me kind of retarded on their part.  Yes I know it is their right to sell what ever they want to sell or in this case not to sell it.  For example no one on here is getting mad at them for not selling masturbatory games like nekopara are they?  Now with that said considering that they sell postal 1+2 and duke nukem and I seriously wonder the double standard here which makes it seem kind of retarded to me.    Now there could be a good reason why they decided to carry hatred and honestly its not their responsibility to tell us why.  And if it wasn't for the recent Witcher 3 issue I probable wouldn't care and would shrug it off without a second thought.  But combined with the recent Witcher 3 issue to me it makes me question their business choices and makes me not want to do business with them.
gog,3ai49z,volimsir,0,Sun Jun 21 01:44:49 2015 UTC,"Wow, I didn't know GOG doesn't want to carry Hatred. They haven't come up with a statement regarding the issue, but if it is related to the bullshit regarding the controversy, than that really sucks. GOG carries both Postals, which were the Hatred of their time. Does anyone know why they don't they stock any AO games?  I mostly buy games on GOG because I believe in supporting the DRM free versions of games. But if they refuse to carry certain games, just because they may offend some people, that sucks big time, and may make me rethink some of my purchases.   They're a store, and if you don't like it, don't buy it. No one is forcing you.  EDIT: Just went through the list of AO games. GOG sells Indigo Prophecy, so I'm not sure if the game being rated AO is the problem."
gog,3ai49z,Mo145678,0,Sat Jun 20 19:42:33 2015 UTC,"Games rated AO are pretty risky to begin with. Couple that up with a controversy and it gets worse.   As far as I know, Indigo Prophecy wasn't surrounded by controversy when it was released. Hatred, on the other hand, was."
gog,3ai49z,Mo145678,0,Sat Jun 20 19:47:11 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, this whole thing has been blown out of proportion. Are people really going to get upset at GOG for not releasing one game?   Not to mention, isn't Hatred rated AO? If memory serves correct, GOG is terribly picky when it comes to games with that rating. So it leads me to the question, why are we even talking about this?  Edit: And of course, I get downvoted. Someone's mad now."
gog,3ai49z,Balorat,0,Sat Jun 20 18:32:02 2015 UTC,"Did they ever said they would release it on GOG? If no (what I think) then there is no controversy. Or is it also a controversy that they also don't sell, I don't know, Halo or Age of Empires, or any game of the NfS series or the hundreds of other games they don't sell, including AAA and indie titles?"
gog,3aeawd,MrDCT,3,Fri Jun 19 12:39:20 2015 UTC,"Episode 3 is not out yet (23rd) and the game is already -50%.   Worst full price purchase ever.  The game is awesome though, so it is good to grab it while on sale, forget about it and play once season is out."

gog,3afg1e,MrDCT,2,Sat Jun 20 02:19:29 2015 UTC,"My bank picks it up as fraud, but only because my company doesn't like foreign purchases and CD Projekt Red operates outside of the United States.

It might be an international thing though if someone is using a debit card.  I believe GOG is in Europe and perhaps certain credit unions and banks do not allow debit purchases in such a manner."
gog,3afg1e,MisterRoku,2,Sat Jun 20 15:07:14 2015 UTC,"It is common for card fraud prevention logic to flag purchases made from outside the country/region of the card-holder.  The algorithms are really quite out-of-date, so they assume if you make a single purchase from out-of-country, that it's probably fraud and they tend to block it.  If you call the credit vendor (number on the card) and ask them to please authorize the payment you are attempting to make, that will probably sort it out.  Until the next country you purchase from."
gog,3aba4n,CZtheDude,5,Thu Jun 18 18:26:58 2015 UTC,"The immersion and atmosphere, along with the difficulty of the STALKER-games makes these games some of my all-time favourites. The series is in a league of its own, with not many games that come close in terms of gameplay or experience, except for maybe the METRO games. These games have great gunplay, a sandbox feel akin to games like Fallout 3/New Vegas or Skyrim, realism in the sense of having to eat/sleep/treat wounds and radiation, and using cover in firefights, and then there's the zombies and mutants. Running into a bloodsucker is a horrifying moment, whereas meeting a group of STALKERs in the wild when you're in dire need of some bandages is very relieving (because you can trade with almost every NPC in the game).  On top of that, the games have an active modding community and tons of great mods to add realism, up the difficulty, changing the storyline, enhancing graphics +++  The games' storyline is so-so, I have to admit that I never really followed it and I don't find it very thrilling. I think these games are more about you making up your own story and experiences.  Shadow of Chernobyl  My first playthrough was on Master difficulty, using the ZRP (Zone Reclamation Project) bugfix/tweaks mod along with Absolute Nature/Structures texture packs and the SWO (STALKER Weather Overhauled) mod! These mods improve the base game without changing the vanilla experience. What an amazing atmosphere. It's so thick you can almost touch it and smell it.  A great mod that adds to the survival experience is Autumn Aurora. It adds some graphical enhancements, puts a visor overlay on your screen (which really adds to the immersion) and makes the game world bleaker and grittier. It also makes some realism changes so that you can't f.ex. just bandage yourself or eat/drink in the middle of a gun fight.  Clear Sky  This is often considered the ""worst"" of the games. I have to admit that I haven't played it a lot to make a good judgement, but IMO even though it feels a little different, it's still a nice STALKER game and definitely scratches the STALKER itch you will learn to recognize after playing these games for a while. It's a visually beautiful game, and what sets Clear Sky apart from the other games is the ""Faction Wars"". This adds objectives to the map and gameplay where you can choose a faction to belong to, and you have to help out faction members in trouble through random encounters and objectives, control certain points of interest and ""strongholds"" across the map, fighting opposing factions and ""deliberating"" them of their bases of operation.  Call of Pripyat  STALKER: Call of Pripyat with the MISERY mod. This is the absolutely best survival game I have ever played.  What makes CoP + MISERY mod so great to me is the atmosphere, gun/equipment customization, upgrading and maintenance, scarcity of ammunition/food, set up camp anywhere and the careful planning of your missions. Coming back alive from a mission or even just a little mutant hunting is extremely rewarding. Not to mention the adrenaline you get when a blowout is imminent and you're way out in the wilds.  I'm still waiting for something to beat STALKER + MISERY's survival game experience. Mutants that will kick your ass, scarce ammo, poisoned food, broken guns and armor, medicines and drugs, set up camp anywhere, atmosphere so thick you can DRINK it. Difficulty and rags-to-riches curves are immense. Hell, the first hours of the game, the best and smartest thing you do is tailgating random NPCs and steal their hunting bounty so you can sell it, because you don't even have a gun yet. If there was ever any game that told you what kind of little shit you really are, this is it. MISERY doesn't give a f*** about you and you are inferior to NPCs.  I've been playing it for about 80 hours and I'm not done, by a long shot. There's just something about being trapped on top of a rock in the middle of a marsh, surrounded by a pack of dogs. It's pitch black, raining and you only have a few rounds left in your pistol.  In the beginning it can be a little grindy to get the money you need for upgrading your equipment, but once you have a gas mask to protect yourself from radiation and a Sunrise suit or better for armor, it gets relatively easy. I took out the whole waste processing plant alone with an AK and a few grenades, must have been like 20 bandits there. The biggest ""issues"" seem to be the scarcity of ammunition and clean food.  Lost Alpha  If you don't want to shell out money just yet, The Lost Alpha mod is a remake/fan-made, standalone modded version of Shadow of Chernobyl and doesn't require you to own the original game. It's a little buggy, but has more content and a different storyline, and is still essentially the same game. And it's FREE! A nice tip if you want to ""demo"" the STALKER games before purchasing.  Tech tips:  You can reduce the vomit-inducing headbob by bringing up the in-game console (press the key above TAB, on my Nordic keyboard it is the ""|"" button, on American keyboards I think it is the ""~"" key) and enter this:  cam_inert 0.0   Personally I use a low value, a little higher than 0, because I like a little headbob. Just remember that the number you enter should preferably be in the ""n.nn"" format.  This setting is stored in your ""user.ltx"" file and can also be changed from there.  There are mods to change the FOV, too, but that involves replacing a DLL file in your /stalker/bin folder.  Difficulty  Difficulty-wise I recommend playing on the highest difficulty, called Master. This is because of the game mechanics and the guns' shooting/accuracy.  The higher the difficulty, the better the gun accuracy. The lower the difficulty, the worse the accuracy is and the more shots it takes to put someone (or something) down, including yourself. The games' way of making things ""easier"" is that rather than buffing the health of yourself and NPCs, you are essentially firing dummy shots every X shot to simulate that you can survive more shots to the body. This goes both ways, both for you and the NPCs.  Putting the difficulty on Master ensures that you have the highest gun accuracy and that every shot counts. Don't let the difficulty name ""Master"" scare you away. It might actually make the game easier, depending on your playstyle and aiming abilities. Just make intelligent use of cover, headshots, correct ammo for the enemy you're fighting and get a scoped rifle and you should be fine.  This coming from someone who usually suck at FPS games. My main tips are to have awareness of your surroundings, and be well-equipped before heading out on missions."

gog,3aba4n,Stefalsky,2,Fri Jun 19 20:29:39 2015 UTC,I'll start us off. As someone who recently bought all the Stalker games and have yet to play them do the veterans recommend playing in order for the best experience or only playing certain ones? Is there any unofficial patches or mods you recommend to use as a new player?
gog,3aba4n,Nerash,5,Thu Jun 18 19:54:19 2015 UTC,"Play them in order of release for the best experience:   S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: SHADOW OF CHERNOBYL (SoC) S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: CLEAR SKY (CS) S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: CALL OF PRIPYAT (CoP)   For new players for the first 2, start with the Reclamation patches and perhaps some graphics mods. The Complete mods are not a bad choice for simplicity (for SoC and CS), however I think you will get more enjoyment over the long term by starting with Reclamation patches.  Call of Pripyat does not have a Reclamation patch that I know of as that is the most stable game of the 3. Playing CoP with official patches should be enough for the first playthrough."
gog,3aba4n,kiros_winstone,2,Thu Jun 18 20:27:37 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for the reply and the suggestions... I defiantly think I will play them in order to get the full experience. :)"
gog,3aba4n,Nerash,2,Fri Jun 19 20:26:38 2015 UTC,"I recommend starting with Shadow of Chernobyl, as it is the first game of the series and thus, in my opinion, has the best story. 2nd  to that would be Call of Pripyat.  As for mods, I recommend playing vanilla first. When you're done with the vanilla, you can move on to the mods. There are mods like the Complete mods if you want a bit easier experience, and there are those like Misery if you want more of a challenge. There's also Lost Alpha standalone if you want to play with the contents cut from the release."

gog,3aba4n,Idislikedogs,2,Thu Jun 18 20:27:36 2015 UTC,"Stalker was the first survival type shooter I had ever played, while admittedly not a full on survival game it none the less scratches that particular itch. Hunting and running from the wildlife, desperate shoot-outs with numbers far above you, weight forcing tough decisions on what to use and what to ditch.   This coupled with the fact that I have always been a fan of post-apocalyptic settings. The zone, while not truly post-apocalyptic in the traditional sense, non the less oozed that feeling of decay and life bursting between the cracks of and old world that will never be the same. It all culminated in a style of shooter I found absolutely absorbed me.   Then came the horror elements and I was in love. From the first mutant playing ping pong with my noggin I knew I was in for more than just a really good shooter, this was a diamond in the rough.   So there I was agonising over ammo, keeping more food than I realistically would ever need after getting the hunger symbol for the first time and watching every piece of gear I had crumble with each shot. And loving every second of it."

It's actually in my top 5 games, and I'll be playing it again when 2.2 is set to be released (soon).  The downside is that it can be ruthless, and you have really have to pay attention when walking around the wasteland. Bullet and food conservation plays a critical role, and the immersion factor is as good as you're going to get."

I never finished CS, I can't remember exactly what it made me stop mid way through, but I'll try to go through it with some mods that don't affect the story.

gog,3a25rm,j_rodman,2,Sun Jun 21 03:22:01 2015 UTC,"I agree, but gog galaxy is a beta so... It does make me feel like they're not taking it seriously if that's their way of posting updates."
gog,3a25rm,LuisLN,2,Sun Jun 21 03:25:21 2015 UTC,"Indeed.  An accurate changelog can be a source of needless customer questions, but it's an important part of building trust, which is pretty key for the customer base to adopt this client.  Many users won't care, but some influential ones will."

Also this, if you haven't heard of it yet:  http://www.pathofexile.com/  Side note: Divine Divinity is, imo, one of the greatest and most memorable games I have ever played. It also has one of the greatest original soundtracks ever created for a video game. I ~very highly~ recommend this game."

Check out these games as well - haven't personally played them, but they seem nice and have good reviews:  Darkstone - the first review compares it to Torchlight itself, seems dated though  Soldak Bundle - Din's Curse seems like a great  and dynamic game, you can find the demo here. I don't know about the other games in the bundle, but the developer's site has demos and more info."

I bought IL2 1946 and it's really great, actually, but I was hoping for something a bit more arcadey and possibly space themed.   Freespace 2 seems exactly what I want, but it hasn't gone on sale yet. I played the OG Wing Commander on my Sega CD (yeah, I actually bought that thing) back in the day and I loved it, so I know I like the play style, but I don't feel like I need all the games in the series. There's no way I'll play them all.  That said, if I buy one or two of the titles (maybe WC III and Privateer), it's like half the cost of the bundle anyways.  Am I being a cheap bastard? Should I just buy the bundle, buy one or two of the more popular titles, or skip it altogether and wait for Freespace 2 to go on sale?"

gog,39y3nn,AnxiousInfusion,5,Mon Jun 15 19:05:11 2015 UTC,It's most likely a licensing issue. GOG was only licensed to provide Windows and Mac versions of the games and has to renegotiate to distribute for Linux.
gog,39y3nn,cdrt,4,Mon Jun 15 21:32:55 2015 UTC,"With Desura possibly shutting down due to bankruptcy, I am personally hoping that RuneSoft and Linux Game Publishing get in talk with GOG on the possibility of offering their Linux ports. That would add Linux versions of:   Sacred: Gold Edition Majesty: Gold Edition Knights and Merchants: The Shattered Kingdom (not currently on GOG) Gorky 17 Creatures: Internet Edition Shadowgrounds Shadowgrounds Survivor Postal² Robin Hood: The Legend of Sherwood Ankh 1&2 (not currently on GOG) Jack Keane Earth 2140 Cultures: Northland"

gog,39x7cq,kvnmahan,10,Mon Jun 15 15:14:20 2015 UTC,"I have never heard of anyone getting their account revoked and losing complete access to their games save for 1 time and that was when someone was caught buying games and then uploading them to torrent sites and was a unrepentant ass about it. Granted this was back in 2011-2012 so maybe that even changed, don't know but for the most part unless you do something really, really bad i.e. publicly pirating the games you bough. Your fine."
gog,39x7cq,MrDCT,-3,Mon Jun 15 15:42:15 2015 UTC,"That's not what he's asking though. It completely dodged the question.   I'd also very much like to know what would happen if your account got banned for some reason.  Say that happened on Steam, that's it. You lose access to your games. What happens at GOG? Do you lose access or do you keep access but just can't make new purchases? What happens if they decide to close your account for whatever reason?"

gog,39x7cq,MrDCT,7,Tue Jun 16 12:24:03 2015 UTC,"I recommend keeping backups of your game installers just in case something happens. The ability to do so is a major benefit of DRM-free content, so put it to use."

gog,39we9e,spiffybaldguy,0,Mon Jun 15 16:58:47 2015 UTC,"Base on that whole ""more like pre-alpha"" I take it that you really have no idea of what Alpha and Beta mean.. since you do know Beta software is still often still missing features and is still buggy. All Beta means that the core feature set, the main code base and the like are set and are not planned for massive changes and the software it self is more a bit more stable but still bug prone."

gog,39s19s,Rampshik,1 point,Sun Jun 14 07:04:24 2015 UTC,"It's quite frustrating as for my first ticket, I was asked to used browser instead of client and I was already doing that. I showed them a cropped out screenshot of the browser and how I didn't see any codes, and they asked for an unedited version (I can't really understand why since they can see my purchase history and my redeemed games while I'm showing them that I see no codes). After sending one more screenshot, there has been no reply since.  I guess I should wait it out. Does anyone know when the Summer Sale ends? I haven't been following with GOG recently."
gog,39s19s,distgenius,3,Sun Jun 14 07:13:00 2015 UTC,"As someone who does root cause analysis on support tickets elsewhere, asking for a non-edited screenshot does a few things:    Provides visual clarification of browser type.  A lot of people will straight up lie about browser version, and if the problem is a front-end issue browser version can often matter.   Lets the analyst/debugger look for other visual clues as to what may be going on.  If, for instance, content is missing elsewhere, the reason the codes may not be displaying is that some of the client-side operations that load the page didn't fire.   It's standard operating procedure.  Everyone hates on support that makes you reboot/power cycle/try closing the browser and re-opening it, but there are good reasons for it. The procedures are designed to investigate from most common/easiest solution to more complex.  As soon as you start detouring off procedure, you run the risk of missing a common cause.  It's the ""think horses, not zebra"" idea.   Piggybacking on #3, whenever we get new hires in that are doing intake and triage, the hardest thing for them to understand is that you can't trust the end user. I use this as a teaching tool. This is not a direct attack on you, or any of the fine folks that use the software I support, but the fact is, whether they realize it or not, all users lie.  It may be something as simple as a lie by omission- ""oh yeah, I totally forgot that I had set your site to run in compatibility mode"" or outright lack of knowledge- ""You mean Firefox isn't the same as Internet Explorer?  They both do Internet, right?""  Sometimes it is much more malicious- we had someone insist our software was losing one clinicians documentation.  A lot of work later, trying various reproduction steps, going back through the backup system, we found that they person hadn't entered any documentation in over 4 months.  We ended up billing the customer for probably 30 hours of time across the support team, at ~$150/hr, because it wasn't our application causing the problem.  I think the management there learned an important lesson that day about critical thinking.   TL;DR: No matter how much technical knowledge you have, you don't know how GoG's internal systems work. There's usually a reason for the weird stuff support asks you to do.  They aren't just monkeys flinging poo at a wall to see what sticks."
gog,39s19s,distgenius,2,Sun Jun 14 16:25:18 2015 UTC,Thank you for clarifying that. I had no understanding of why they would want a full screenshot as I thought they just needed the root of the problem. I was getting increasingly frustrated so I apologize if I seemed ignorant.
gog,39s19s,SonOfCactus,2,Sun Jun 14 16:55:50 2015 UTC,"No apology necessary.  I've had the same reaction you had, and probably more often than was healthy, before I started doing that kind of work. Hell, I still have to fight back the ""WHY DO YOU NEED THAT"" response, and I should know better."

And what's more is that GOG have been replying the same over and over ""Use the browser"" ""It's in your Account details"" and I follow these instructions but clearly it's not there. Then they just stop replying afterwards.  Perhaps (benefit of the doubt) they're working on the issue and have yet to find a solution, but it just feels sketchy and annoying when they advise you to do the most obvious things that you've done already and afterwards leave you in the dark. :/"

I've had an account since 2008, and the reason I signed up is because DRM had grown so utterly toxic. Half the games released on disc were infected with DRM that weakened stability or even damaged your hardware. And even if the game had ""nicer"" DRM, things like limited number of activations, authentication servers being down for the first week of a game's release, and other annoyances pretty much ruined the hobby for me.  Then along comes GOG. Here was an online store that said:  No, it's cool. Buy a game, back it up on disc. It'll still work in 20 years, even if we go out of business.  That's not just a perk, that's a guarantee.   And for your last point, rarely do developers make big decisions about DRM. It's publishers who handle that sort of thing, and you can rest assured that the minute EA, Activision and others had the option of locking down their GOG games with online activations, we'd lose half the catalog to that ugly nonsense."

In the year you mentioned I didn't have home internet at all, making me very sensitive to DRM practices and yet the only problem I had was with GTA IV (happy Windows Live is gone).   It might be a difference in what developer you buy your games from, or as you rightfully point out, what publisher. But from my experience, there are many developers that protect their products responsibly. And the community lash-back towards toxic DRM has been so strong that it seems like more and more publishers have come forwards advertising DRM free games before any vendor started to force them to."
gog,39txv4,onnut77,8,Sun Jun 14 19:37:14 2015 UTC,"Protect their products responsibly??? Are you joking? Piracy prevention is all they care about period full stop. How its done and whatever ramifications it might have are never even discussed much less taken seriously.  I haven't bought an Ubisoft game since the Starforce debacle where they contracted shady Russian hackers to create their ""Responsible"" protection that started destroying peoples hardware, and then went on a ban campaign on their forums for anyone that dared bring the subject up. It took a class action suit to get them to drop it.  Sorry, but you sound like a developer who doesn't believe enough in their product and is making the ""need"" for ""protection"" a much more important thing than it actually is in reality.  I came to GoG in 2008 because of their anti-drm stance. I've stayed an active buyer here eversince because of it. The day they go back on their founding principals is the day I leave."
gog,39txv4,ParadoxicGer,0,Mon Jun 15 12:41:48 2015 UTC,"Ubisoft is one of the most notorious offenders of excessive DRM, I would not use them as an example of DRM done right. DRM becomes better when it makes more sense.   When a publisher puts DRM constrictions on a game, like online-only, a consumer wants it to at least make sense for the actual game. Blizzard's Hearthstone has a single player component, yet I cannot access my purchased content when offline. This I find acceptable because to me the game is defined by playing online against other players. And that's what I mean by 'responsible' DRM; making enough sense within the context of the game."
gog,39txv4,WhatDoesStarFoxSay,11,Mon Jun 22 10:48:58 2015 UTC,"Not only would it damage their brand, but it's also the only thing that sets it apart from Steam/Uplay/Origin (besides the old games, who are now working on modern systems ofc).  Further more DRM, if it's not an extremly harsh/shitty DRM (like always online in Diablo 3 for example), it doesn't stop someone from pirating. All those games are cracked day one and it's made so easy nowadays. You don't have to search for shady No-CD cracks on websites, you just go to you favourite website and actually download an installer file, which installs everything for you (the crack as well) and you do get all the patches as exe files as well.  Even though we live in times with massive DRM, pirating was never as easy as nowadays.  Last thing is also, that publishers think that every pirated copy = 1 lost sale, which is not remotely true. It's called cost fallacy because only a tiny fraction of people who pirate would actually buy the game if there would be no pirated version.   Just make good games and have a good marketing team and the game will sell well on PC (look at the Witcher 3 sales).  So, I highly disagree. GoG should never, ever consider DRM free games. If every game on PC will suddenly become always Online I'll probably stop playing."
gog,39txv4,ParadoxicGer,8,Sun Jun 14 19:41:57 2015 UTC,"Further more DRM, if it's not an extremly harsh/shitty DRM (like always online in Diablo 3 for example), it doesn't stop someone from pirating.    Back when this insanity was reaching its peak, legitimate customers were being forced to learn how to torrent cracked copies of the games they'd legally purchased, just to get them to work.  In other words, DRM was taking legitimate customers and forcing them to learn how to pirate software. Talk about counterproductive."
gog,39txv4,Mo145678,5,Sun Jun 14 19:55:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know this, it's just insane. I do understand why publishers use DRM because it at least takes a bit of effort (you have to actually download a (pre-)cracked game instead of just getting a GOG copy from a friend), but it's just a lost cause.   And having legitmate customers suffer, like you've described it, is just the worst."
gog,39txv4,Etnos,7,Sun Jun 14 19:58:22 2015 UTC,"Like the others have said on here already, adding DRM would severely damage the GOG brand.  The whole DRM-free aspect is one of the primary reasons people are attracted to the site. It's something that GOG has stood up for since it first came around in 2008. If that were to change, I and many other people would feel betrayed.  So no, GOG is and always should be DRM-free. It's what sets it apart from many other places."

Instead of emphasising growth, I am more invested in doing right by the developers who make the games we love. Because that means the games hopefully keep coming. GoG is discerning between developers. In my opinion not by the quality of their games, but by their business philosophy.  Because I see DRM as a tool that can be used both negatively and positively, I find that stance very arbitrary, and a weak foundation for a brand identity. Obviously, a vast community disagrees with me. That's my reason for starting a discussion."

gog,39txv4,j_rodman,2,Sun Jun 21 22:50:50 2015 UTC,"At the moment I agree. I'd say that's the benefit of GOG currently being a reactonary alternative; the impact of its model on the gaming community is still small compared to other, larger vendors. However, we've seen vendors accumulating so much clout that publishing through it or not becomes a choice of your game being successful or not. If or when the revenue GOG brings becomes a necessity for a developer's survival, it no longer becomes a choice. Seeing the current expansion GOG is performing, that seems to me like a real possibility for the future."

gog,39txv4,MIK517,-1,Sun Jun 21 03:36:22 2015 UTC,"I think the upside comes when holding a vendor responsible for its impact on the market.

gog,39txv4,MIK517,2,Fri Jul 10 12:46:02 2015 UTC,"DRM adds to the cost the supplier must pay, the cost is passed on to the customer so both lose.  DRM is not effective at stopping piracy. Charging less money and treating the customers better are ways and they actually work (including maintaining the game in a working state).  The video game industry has become paranoid that because other companies say they need DRM they should have it too, heck even if a developer doesn't a publisher may well insist on it.  Charge too much, and deliver too little, and annoy people too much and they pirate your game!"
gog,39txv4,MrDCT,0,Sun Jun 21 22:46:45 2015 UTC,"The added cost holds true for advertisement as well, yet it is legitimately effective.

gog,39txv4,MIK517,2,Mon Jun 22 11:48:04 2015 UTC,"much of the research I have read on the matter came from F.A.S.T. which seemed fond of pulling numbers out of their buttock cheeks without any methodology, sample size or indeed anything which would allow someone other than them to derive their numbers.  Despite them essentially being a pressure group controlled by the publishers, distributors and some resellers, I have never seen any information which would allow their claims to be independently validated.  When you have an organisation run by a group whos sole function is to ensure they have ammunition to validate their case but can't provide any proof... can you really take them at their word? or even consider them reliable!"
gog,39txv4,reaffi,0,Mon Jun 22 17:27:59 2015 UTC,"Well, some types of DRM are allowed already. For example there are games (AoW3, SpellForce, Two Worlds) on GOG that require registered key for multiplayer, and you cannot play even LAN games without internet connection to verify your key."
gog,39txv4,MIK517,2,Wed Jun 17 00:23:51 2015 UTC,Authentication for multiplayer is okay. Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising launched with multiplayer that requires no authentication and you can guess how that went.

gog,39ogwp,DakotaThrice,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:34:17 2015 UTC,"Publishing the figures isn't explaining why which is what your asking. If the figures alone had been enough you wouldn't have had to make your post in the first place. As far as I can see you didn't link anything.  Here's a rundown of the current top 25 popular items (I've bolded items with a reduction): The Witcher 3, The Witcher 3 Expansion Pass, Pillars of Eternity: Royal Edition, Shadowrun Dragonfall, Wasteland 2, The Witcher 3 & Expansion Pass, Banished, Dreamfall Chapters Special Edition, HOMM3 Complete, Pillars of Eternity: Hero Edition, Divinity: Original Sin, Tesla Effect, Wasteland 2 Digital Deluxe, Legend of Heroes, Jade Empire, Invisible, Inc., Game of Thrones, Sunless Sea, Leisure Suit Larry, Kerbal Space Program, Avernum: Escape from the Pit, Might and Magic 6 Pack, Shadowrun Returns, The Marvellous Miss Take and Dreamfall: The Longest Journey.  Of twenty five slots three are Witcher 3, two are Wasteland 2, and two are Pillars of Eternity leaving twenty one unique titles. The Witcher 3 isn't even a month old yet so anything more than the 10% discount it has would be unlikely at this point whilst the first piece of content from the season pass isn't due for another four months with second not due till next year, again lack of sale there is understandable.Some titles may not be on sale individually but as part of franchise packs/bundles. Likely candidates here without checking whats already been feartured are Shadowrun, Dreamfall, Might and Magic, Divinity, Tex Murphy, Leisure Sit Larry and Avernum. Pillars of Eternity really could do with better sales especially as GOG doesn't seem to have the upgrade packs available that Steam does. For me even those are poorly priced. I bought the Champion Edition from Nuuvem because they weren't selling the Royal Edition so now it'll cost me almost twice what I paid for the game (and more than full price of the basic game version through Steam) if I wanted to acquire the few extras included. I'm not surprised that Wasteland 2 is on sale after the announcement of the free upgrade - sales now are better than potential sales at some point down the line. I'm surprised Game of Thrones has such a high discount as my experience has that Telltale are rather slow on hitting anything over 50% and there's still two episodes to come for this. As for the others I still stand b my point that top selling items don't require sales, if they did they wouldn't be top selling."
gog,39ogwp,MisterRoku,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:43:11 2015 UTC,"Because Valve, i.e. Steam, can afford to discount big games and top-sellers for a limited time.   GOG is kinda of small potatoes in comparison to Valve, and they have a far smaller library of games."

Also the Loyality discount was the same across the board.  The fact that most Witcher fans were already GOG supporters sure as hell didn't help the sales of Witcher 1 or 2 on GOG, Steam outsold the GOG releases at least 50 to 1 or a 100 to 1 and still has the larger overall purchase base even after GOG offered players the ability to redeem their Steam version for a free copy on GOG and numerous discounts. The reason for this was GOG had a much smaller and more niche customer base then Steam, these numbers along with more established publishers being willing to take a chance on releasing on GOG without any DRM seems to show that there are more people coming to GOG then in the past. The amount of Steam users that don't buy elsewhere are very little and often make up what is known as a Vocal minority. The majority actually either A. will buy elsewhere when it's convenient because of better prices, better service such as refunds which till now Steam never offered or B. stuck with Steam because of it's larger selection of titles and the convince of the client."
gog,39gnfx,reverendfrag4,3,Thu Jun 11 17:42:32 2015 UTC,It was same deal on Steam and Gog for me. I hope CDPR will give the backup code to Gog for Steam owners soon. I had to sell CSGO items to buy TW3 with gabenbux :(
gog,39gnfx,Whadios,3,Thu Jun 11 17:44:45 2015 UTC,As it stands CD Projekt has said there are currently no plans to do that. Now that is not to say they won't in time just not at this point maybe when they do the Witcher 3: Enhanced Edition.
gog,39jct1,EazyCheeze1978,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:16:03 2015 UTC,"it could definitely go for more consolidated reads   Operating systems themselves consolidate reads when possible (when the reads are sequential within a small period of time).  Optimizing Galaxy's more global pattern of read accesses is a horrendous kind of thing to optimize, as a programmer.  Unless they are using a particularly stupidly scattered data structure on disk or something, where just switching to something more sensible would immediately pay off.  And they would doubtless have regarded it as low priority compared with getting just functionality itself working, even if they noticed.  But anyway if you're sure that this issue truly exists, report it as a bug."

They're both great RTS's.  Risk Of Rain is a decent roguelinke shooter.  Think that works over LAN.  Xwing Alliance is good for some space dogfighting.  Terraria for building fun.  It's a racer - but I'll always recommend Re-Volt - it always descends into hilarity inside or 20 minutes.  If you want something more story based I believe Baldurs Gate and Icewind Dale let you LAN as well - though I haven't tried it.  I think pretty much all the second-gen Bullfrog stuff let you LAN too (and some of the first) Dungeon Keeper 2, Syndicate Wars, Magic Carpet 2.  It's by no means an exhaustive list on the LAN-fun on GOG, but I love pretty much all of the above and think you'd get your money's worth out of any of them."

That's why I think about getting the Wolf Among Us - can you recommend that? Read some good stuff about it but also many people say that's it's worse than Walking Dead (played the First Episode and while it was nice I wasn't that interested in it because of the setting)
gog,395x0m,hannes3120,2,Tue Jun 9 15:38:45 2015 UTC,DayZ was a disaster. Probably because they released it so damn early.  I've bought it and not played it yet! My friend who has played them both said that The Wolf Among Us is definitely better and he's a pretty big Walking Dead. I'd say it's worth getting it!
gog,395x0m,KidneyAttic,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:43:44 2015 UTC,DayZ was just an example for all the Zombie-Survival-Titles that came out in the last year(s) ^^  a Friend of mine played the first episode of Wolf Among Us when it was free on the AppStore (when it Launched I think?) ad said that it has a pretty dark atmosphere - I think I'll give it a shot - and looking at their pricing-history for Walking Dead and Wolf Among Us it doesn't look as if it's going to get cheaper anytime soon - on the other side Steam SummerSale is coming - and they often surprised us with extreme offers...

I mainly posted this more to say ""hey there is this game coming soon you guys may want to check out"" then ""hey pre-order this bad boy!!11!!""  I am personally anti pre-order myself, the only time I will pre-order something is if it's something I know I would get and enjoy anyway like say the DLC for Witcher 3. Plus I can't stand modern gaming pre-order culture, that whole ""hey pre-order this game and get exclusive stuff and keep in mind where you pre-order because you may get different stuff. That kind of stuff is revolting, when it's just cosemtic crap like some of the stuff you got for pre-ordering Dark Souls 2 that's not that bad but when it's something like a additional character like Goro in MK X, additional maps and the like.. no that is just uncalled for."

I'm done too unless I know for certain the game will be amazing, and even then I'm extra careful. I preordered The Witcher 3 for the discount/to download so I could play right upon release and I definitely felt like that was a good call.  The last preorder I had before that was Borderlands 2.

I won't pretend to be innocent. I loved preordering games when I was younger. Typically you'd get a nice little reward, but being able to pick up the game the minute it came out and stay up all night with friends to play this new game was amazing.  I think pre-orders had their purpose and were fair for awhile. But now they're almost always ridiculous.   It's like early access, alpha/beta games. They used to mean something and actually be worthwhile. Now you're more likely to support an already dying project and just support a cashgrab."

When it comes to Bundles they will be replaced by new ones, single titles or packaged ones like say Ultima 1-3 or Avernum collection on sale will be ""pushed down"" by the newer sale titles, so you will have the newer batch at the top and the previous batch will move down and so when the next batch are introduced that previous ones that was moved down will be ""pushed out"" of the sale.   In other words each new batch pushes the previous batches down and when a batch reaches the ""bottom"" they are no longer on sale."

gog,38gid4,midterm360,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:32:49 2015 UTC,"I hear ya, This may be due to intended pressure to promote Galaxy. Or it may be just due to more coders committing their time to Galaxy.

Eventually all things become bottom line. sad face"
gog,38gid4,Eh_maybe_Entertained,3,Thu Jun 4 05:18:52 2015 UTC,"They changed the name because users said that they wanted newer games without DRM in addition to classic games.  It doesn't make sense to call it ""Good Old Games"" when you can also buy brand new games.  Galaxy is also the result of user requests.  Remember, not only does GOG have a section dedicated to user requests for new features, but they also do a yearly survey to judge how users feel about changes (both before and after they happen)."

gog,37zvtn,Dre_PhD,1 point,Sun May 31 20:27:23 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong, but I don't believe you actually had 25GB downloaded. That is the game size of all the files,  it simply had all the files it was downloading listed in the folder with their size because it was fetching them from the server. They wasn't actually downloaded yet.   I've noticed this before with other games... it had the files listed with their size but I stopped the download right after starting it so I know they couldn't all actually be in the folder yet."
gog,37zvtn,BKGaming_,1 point,Mon Jun 1 08:15:54 2015 UTC,"I don't see how the files could take up 25GB on disk unless GOG first makes 25GB of useless data and then replaces it with the real thing?  For contrast, I started using the GOG.com Downloader (which works way better BTW) and it downloaded the file first, and then the file grew in size as it downloaded it more.  In any case, my solution to the issue was:  **Delete what you downloaded through GOG Galaxy, download the GOG Downloader, and use that instead, because it's less broken."
gog,37zvtn,BKGaming_,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:46:42 2015 UTC,"As I said it not an actual representation of what is actually on your hard-drive. It's very easy to see/test. Install a game or even a free game and look in the temp folder as soon as the game begins to download. You will see every file for the game is listed and the size of the entire game even though it just started and could not possibly be that big.  Galaxy actually only managed 5GB before losing connection which is why is started back at 5GB... As you found out, using the downloader works fine too."
gog,37zvtn,nikolapc,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:37:44 2015 UTC,"Ahh I see. But how does it still take up that space on disk if it hasn't downloaded it yet? Does it just allocate that space as ""used"" or ""will be used""?"

The right one is only bonuses like soundtrack, artbook etc.   There are three ways to download the game   Download the installer manually (Part 1-7 and the patches) Use the GOG downloader[1]. You can then get the links it uses under ""More | GOG Downloader Links"" Use the GOG Galaxy Beta Client. (It is in BETA!!! I don't know if it supports pausing the download yet)   [1] The downloader supports setting a maximum download speed and pausing the download. It will load part 1-7 of the installer for you"

When it is installed download the patch 1.02 install that and you will then be able to play.  Or you can click on the try gog galaxy and install it. It is a program like steam, your games will show up in it and they have a install button that will download and install your games."
gog,37ub80,LordHemuli,3,Sat May 30 13:29:31 2015 UTC,You can find the save files in documents. Galaxy even asks if you want to delete save games or not when you uninstall. If you used Gog.com to download and kept the installer then you can just use that again

gog,37ub80,wanderer11,1 point,Sat May 30 13:47:11 2015 UTC,No it doesn't keep it. I would recommend making a copy of the save game before you do anything just in case
gog,37ub80,MrDCT,1 point,Sat May 30 13:50:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah right now Galaxy won't keep the installer but I recall that being a option in future, probably because they figure no other client does that and since they already have the option to download a installer even through Galaxy, it wouldn't be a big deal. But for now if you want the installer for backup purposes in Galaxy when you click on the game either installed already or not, click the more button and select get backup and extras and download the installer and keep it as a backup and/or use it to install the game and point Galaxy to where it's installed."

Moving the game folder and pointing Galaxy to it under settings, then scan and import (little + symbol a the top) should do it.

As much as people on GOG's boards were complaining about Galaxy because it was a client and it was taking the place of the old downloader. It seems to have helped attract more releases to the site as we seem to be having alot less dry spells like we had in the past, probably in part due to alot of newer titles no longer having to strip features out of the GOG releases as well as possibly making the patching process easier as well."

You own a copy, yes. You do not own the game. The argument remains, you own the parts of the car and can use them as a whole, but it is a ""license"". Honda still in owns the car, it happens that that particular vehicle is now yours, if that makes sense.  Both Honda and GoG are allowed to issue a cease and desist in the operation and ownership of your vehicle or game of they feel you are using it in and unintended way, such as distributing files, or making replicas of the car parts to build more yourself (which would be weird). But because there lacks a solid DRM in either of these cases, taking it back is almost impossible.  So hopefully that fills the gap between the two of you.

gog,37g5xm,IVI4tt,9,Wed May 27 22:59:30 2015 UTC,"gog is a digital game shop like Steam/Origin/uPlay.  All the games it provides are DRM-free, meaning you can make backup copies for yourself and you don't have to have an internet connection active while playing.  The client (gog Galaxy) is lighter on your computer than Steam is, and is designed to support mods. It will never overwrite your modded files with new patched files unless you want it to, and it will soon have rollback functions so you can go to an earlier version of a game.  The advantages of buying a game on gog are:   For the Witcher 3, more money goes to the developers (the developers of the Witcher 3 own gog.com For older games, the gog team will patch them and make sure they work on modern computers Money back guarantee - if it doesn't work and support can't fix it, they'll refund you DRM free, as mentioned above Fair prices - people in the EU pay the same as people in Australia, and the same as people in the USA. If a publisher forces the price of a game to be higher in different regions, gog will give you the difference back in gog credit (like Steam Wallet)"

But when possible they do often tap modders and such like I know Timeslip did the fix for Anachronox as well as the DDraw fix for Thief 1 and 2 till that was replaced by the fan made New Dark engine(it was a replacement engine for the old Dark engine based on source code from the unreleased Dreamcast port of SS2) that was used for the re-release of System Shock 2."

gog,37bwxj,MrDCT,4,Tue May 26 14:22:56 2015 UTC,This is just awesome. I'm sure Gog Galaxy convinced lot of developers and publisher to sell their games at Gog. Even if you don't use GoGalaxy its good for all of us.
gog,37bwxj,reaffi,2,Tue May 26 15:37:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think on of the biggest hindrances GOG had when they did the move to selling newer titles on top of the classics was    The lack of a multiplayer API like Steamworks, not many devs really wanted to strip features out of their games just to sell to what was still at the time a small audience but and this is speculation on my part here since I haven't gotten any info from anyone who has used both Steamworks and Galaxy's APIs to see if there is any major differences to them but so far it seems there isn't or if there is it's fairly small since a few Steamworks enabled titles fairly quickly made the transition such as Rise of the Triad 2013, Double Dragon Trilogy and fairly soon Crypt of the Necrodancer which used Steamworks for it's Daily Challenges. Now I can't say for certain that Necrodancer will still have the daily challenges in the GOG version but given that the devs now have tools via the Galaxy API to keep it in the GOG release it would make sense for them to keep it.  The patching process possibly was a pain as well, since with Steam it was upload it to a server and go and the client would just patch the necessary files, GOG on the other hand you either had to upload a new version of the game or submit a small patch for them to put into a patching program of their design. So compared to the upload and done method of Steam it can be a turn off for devs who had a this easier system to use on Steam and then have to do something else for GOG, which is probley why often times it took longer for patches to come to the GOG release if they even got them, some games still never got patches that the Steam releases got.  Then you have all the fluff crap like Achivements and such, personally I could care less about getting a virtual reward for doing arbitary shit that get's me nothing but people like them and devs like to put them into their games so now they can put them into the GOG versions, well some still have them anyway like Shovel Knight and Unepic but it never registered anywhere outside of the game itself."

I really like the Steam client counting your time played in games, Friend management, etc. but I'm more and more annoyed of the several issues with Valves misbehaviours.

I'm not against Steam, but Gog/Galaxy is far more consumer friendly and I've learned it's not wise to place all my eggs in one basket. I feel GoG is much more progressive and in line with what we as PC gamers should be pushing towards.  More developers really should release their games on GoG. We can already torrent their games, so the DRM-free nature of GoG is objectively a non-issue. I want to give them money and support the games I enjoy, but they're limiting my ability to do so.

gog,379q9h,NEREVAR117,5,Tue May 26 09:39:52 2015 UTC,They weren't charging for mods? I was under the impression they merely put in a system that allowed the modmakers to charge for mods if they wanted to?

gog,379q9h,LuisLN,-5,Thu May 28 23:22:55 2015 UTC,People like you make me sad to use this new platform. The only thing wrong with charging for mods was that Valve took a bit too much money. There's literally nothing wrong with people wanting to make money.
gog,379q9h,Kuldiin,3,Tue May 26 14:44:29 2015 UTC,"Do you even use mods? Give a mod 1-2 patches and the majority of mod developers have long abandoned their creations.

gog,379q9h,ChrisTX4,1 point,Tue May 26 14:58:19 2015 UTC,"...and maybe some tiny details such as the mods Valve hand-picked for their debut set contained some with assets being used without authorization by the creator, their ""Shadowscale"" armor set which was a single piece only (thus clipping through all other equipment), had to be cheated into the game, and had no female model available.  If you permit anyone to sell mods (or games), you end up with a large group of folks that try to make a quick buck."
gog,379q9h,jordguitar,3,Tue May 26 17:32:49 2015 UTC,Right now it is not. There are still plenty of issues that need to be fixed and more features added before it can start to really compete.
gog,379q9h,ChrisTX4,7,Tue May 26 03:49:36 2015 UTC,"I doubt it will be that for the foreseeable future. The amount of GOG customers (assuming all were dual GOG/Steam customers) is not that significant in comparison to Valve's overall customer base. So even if we'd all buy on GOG instead of Steam, whenever possible, the damage would still be eaten up by Valve's everlasting acquisition of new customers.  What GOG needs is an influx of new customers and for this, it's more dependent on how badly Valve screws up in the future than how GOG comes along. Right now, GOG is really damn awesome, but if everyone has Steam, then the disadvantages of Steam (and it being a DRM) have to become more obvious to a broader customer base in order to them considering an alternative service."

gog,379q9h,Whadios,1 point,Tue May 26 21:47:19 2015 UTC,In the future maybe.  Galaxy is still a really immature product at this point and probably has at least a good year or two of development before it can really compete as a tool against steam.  Business wise is another matter.  Valve has a pretty strong hold of PC gaming market now and I wouldn't expect them to give up any sizable portion of that without a fight.  Not to mention the lockin they have due to DRM that will force people to keep Steam installed to be able to play all the games they've bought there which will prevent a real switch from happening.  I can switch from Galaxy to Steam but I can't switch from Steam to Galaxy thanks to DRM.
gog,379q9h,Trodamus,1 point,Tue May 26 12:59:34 2015 UTC,"I'm the guy that would buy a game on steam all the time, no matter what, because of some mental tic that wanted my entire library in one place.  After the paid mods fiasco and with the GOG Galaxy client, I will now consider GOG my primary storefront when it has the game I want to buy. I don't see a reason to use steam after what they tried to pull, except when I don't have a choice.  However, this basically only applies to older games and indie titles. It's not like I can buy Arkham Origins on GOG.  So GOG is a threat to steam under a very narrow band I'd say."

Personally and mind you this is just my take on the whole thing, I don't think GOG has any plans to dethrone Steam, it would be crazy to do so. It's like a wrestling promotion trying to take down WWE. It's just not going to happen, oh sure you could try but your going to get your ass handed to you..(hi TNA, hi WCW). The last company I could think of that tried and by their own admonition try and take out Steam was Impulse and look where that got them and that was when Steam wasn't the massive beast it is now. I honestly think GOG is just going to be the alternative, not the direct competition trying to vie for number 1 but rather the solid number 2 that people can go to if they don't want to use Steam or don't care for it for one reason or another. Granted this is pure speculation on my part based on what GOG has said in the past when they started moving into selling newer games a few years back. But that would be the smart move to make since Steam has been around for too many years and has become too established as a brand to try and compete head on and while yes some of their decision are questionable, I really don't think CDPR and GOG are that stupid. So I personally think a better question isn't ""Can GOG be a threat to Steam"" but ""Can GOG be the successful alternative to Steam we need?"""

I am not anti-Steam. I have been on the platform for 11 years, since they started requiring it for Counterstrike, and have many games there. In that 11 years I have seen a few issues - the biggest being reliable offline playing of the games in the Steam library. My son was in the service, serving on a ship in the middle of the Persian Gulf and all of a sudden months into his tour, Steam decides it has to phone home and he can no longer load anything in his library until he reconnects to Steam, something he was unable to do for months. That is a non-issue with GOG games."

Publishers still foolishly believe DRM is actually doing something against torrenting. I also don't think Valve can fuck up so bad to lose as much costumers to make gog a threat. They still have smart people there and tend to do the right thing when they piss off gamers. Them not fixing support is just the result of getting by with shitty support for years so people have been bitching about it for a while. We'd definitely need an influx in ""bad valve support"" press for them to change. Steam is also moving radically forward to an open structure in the sense of making it a publishing platform for multiple mediums (games, software, movies, audio, streaming, all the community features, mods, and even hardware) allowing everyone to publish there (at least that's what they have been testing for the past few years to see how viable it is). I think gog is in its extreme early stages but they have potential. I love that they started selling movies. Steam has started doing this too but gog does it better right now. First, galaxy will have to play catch up and then start a hard wave of innovation if they want to take a bigger piece of the cake. They are at an advantage right now as they know what people will like as steam has already tested the waters for them. Valve is at a disadvantage as they have to test everything new they come up with without knowing how it will turn out for them (like selling mods)."

gog,377kot,Phlum,2,Mon May 25 15:15:26 2015 UTC,"That works for me, It's just Rouge-like snobs tossing out the term ""Rouge-like-like"" and some of them get pissy when you use ""Rouge-lite"" since I guess that applies to simple rouge-likes like Dungeons of Dredmor, Sword of the Stars: the Pit and to some Tales of Maj'Eyal.

This should minimize the odds of you being charged extra by your bank, for making a currency conversion. If you’re living in a country that is billed in EUR, GBP, AUD or RUB by default, you always have the option to pay the equivalent in USD, if that’s more convenient for you. For example, for our most common price-points - $5.99 and $9.99, the equivalents in local currencies would be: 5,99 USD= 5.49 EUR = 4,09 GBP = 7,79 AUD = 359 RUB 9.99 USD = 9,19 EUR = 6,79 GBP = 12,99 AUD = 599 RUB While our older, “back-catalog” games, and most other items, usually cost roughly the same in all currencies, some new games in our catalog may have different prices based on where you are physically located in the world In such cases, you may find that you're asked to pay a different amount than people in other regions do. However, we offer store credit, which you can use in future purchases, to make up for the price difference. Regional pricing is something that is undertaken at the request of the company for whom we are selling the game, but we do our best to go the extra mile and make it right for everyone. Our company is based in Europe and the VAT/Taxes are all included in the items' prices. This means that GOG.com will always charge you the exact order total visible at checkout.With our location in mind, please remember that we have no control over your bank's additional international card transaction fees (where applicable). Some banks don't charge their customers extra and some do, but there are two ways of avoiding the possibility of extra fees. One is using funds already present on your PayPal account to make purchases (instead of using a card through PayPal). The other is using paysafecard (for details, scroll up to paragraph 2)."

But If I can find the time I could try upload the icons for the 631 games I own somewhere for you but that will obviously only cover 631 games out of 1095 currently on GOG and a few I have are no longer sold on GOG and in some case Steam either such as XIII and Severance: Blade of Darkness.

gog,371b0i,drfitzgerald,5,Sun May 24 06:11:16 2015 UTC,"Well...  A few things.   Gog support is by no means amazon.com support.  As you pointed out no chat etc. Compared to the weeks / months valve generally takes to respond, I would also go as far as to say Gog support is by no means anywhere close to Steam.   That said.  You will not lose progress in the game.  If you are playing it on your account and they have not told you that you cannot refund it than you shouldn't worry.  If you haven't downloaded the game yet... Don't.  As generally speaking that will forfeit the refund back to card deal and make it so only technical issues are allowed to warrant a refund back to store credit."

gog,36w5pp,ecstatic1,4,Fri May 22 21:33:01 2015 UTC,"I'll post my first impression after about 16 hours of play from another thread:  PROS:   Immersive as fuck. I can't get enough of the atmosphere. The music, the ambiance, the skyboxes. Fucking fantastic. I love the voice acting and subtle facial expressions. They really set the tone well in all kinds of situations. Great story thus far. It's a little slow to get started, but the climax of each quest chain thus far has been awesome. The monsters! I love the monsters. The way they look, the sounds they make, how terrifying they are coming at you out of the ground in the dead of night. A+ on the design work. Combat is visceral and fun! Chopping a dude in half is fantastic. And magic feel forceful and powerful much more so than in Witcher 2. Alchemy is taking some getting used to, but I'm starting to get the hang of replenishing potions and bombs.   CONS:   Geralt drives like a boat. The massive inertia of man and horse make precise movement difficult. I've found myself walking most places, breaking into jog only when I want to go very quickly in a straight line. Otherwise, it's simply too frustrating waiting for Geralt to speed up or slow down at every button press. I shouldn't have to walk in a circle to do a 180º turn. Seriously man, learn how to pivot! Clunky interface. It was clearly designed with controller interaction in mind. Having to hit escape 5 times to get out of the inventory menu gets old fast. It could do with a better sorting function, too. I would like to sort by selling price, or ingredient type, or something, and not just which items are new. The crafting tab in the inventory is seriously a mess right now. Also, there seems to be a bug with equipment comparison. If you compare a piece of armor in the store, it will show you the differences of all the stats. But if you compare armor from your inventory to an equipped piece, it will only tell you how much armor rating changes. The graphical fidelity to performance ratio. I'm running pretty much everything on ultra settings. This game taxes my rig quite heavily, but I'm not really seeing why... The textures look bland and flat. The lighting and shadows look nice some of the time and pretty bad at others. The foliage is the biggest offender, since it consumes the most resources and yet looks like fancy sprites with shadows on them. I'm not even going to go into Hairworks. I took some screenshots here (filter by game - Witcher 3, unless you want to go through my other weirdo screenshots :3). Some of those pictures look nice and others make it look like a game from 3 or 4 years ago. EDIT: Patch 1.03 really upped the performance. I can run most settings (except shadows and foliage distance) on ultra and hairworks on full and get over 70 fps in the wilderness and 60 in towns (with the occasional dips into 40s). Towns have some minor stuttering while moving around, I'm guessing it's actor pop-in.  Not digging the weapon and armor degradation. It wouldn't be so bad if the repair kits were more widespread, or if I could repair myself while meditating or something. But as it stands, I have to drop 20 gold for each amateur kits at every blacksmith I visit because 20 gold for 15% is actually cheaper than having them do the repair. Not to mention that it's random if they have armor or weapon kits... EDIT: Having played further and leveled up, I'm seeing this as less of an issue. I have so much money and repair kits at this point that repairs are a non-issue. I still don't like degradation, but it's much more manageable now. On that note, food is waaaay too expensive to rely on for health. You basically have to invest in the alchemy tree and heavy potion usage because spending 200 crowns on food in a single fight is remarkably easy. Or maybe I just suck at not getting hit... EDIT: Same as the repairs. Later in the game this becomes less of an issue. On the lower difficulties, meditating for an hour restores all your health and potions/bombs for the cost of 1 bottle of strong alcohol, of which I have dozens of now.   Overall, this game has its faults which I'm desperately hoping the modding community will address in the coming months. But it has a lot of potential and room for improvement. I can see this being one of my most played games in the next year.  TL;DR:  Immersion, story, combat, monsters = GREAT!  Movement, interface, graphics, repairing gear, expensive food = NOT GREAT :("
gog,36w5pp,Komalt,2,Fri May 22 17:26:30 2015 UTC,"Pretty much the same feelings here.  The game itself is great, most of the problem lies on the interface really.  I really wish there was a ""search"" function or a sorting function like you said for the inventories.  I also find looting bodies to be an unnecessary hassle, its hard to target things sometimes.  Also I'm just a tad disappointed that I actually have to fast travel to some zones and I can't actually physically ride my horse there.  But of course the zones themselves are huge so its really not a big deal for me."
gog,36w5pp,MrDCT,1 point,Sat May 23 00:10:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with the clunky movement, but I can tell you right now that the interface is not designed for a controller. If it was then they missed their mark by a country mile.   Having used a controller and keyboard and mouse, I can honestly say this is not a console/controller interface. A controller interface is as the name entails a UI designed around the limited buttons of a controller as such you have very few menus and a more ""streamlined""(Simplified) interface which the Witcher 3 does not have. It's just a clunky UI all around.   Now it's possible that they tried to find a middle ground for Keyboard and mouse users and controller ones. But still it's not clearly designed for controllers"

gog,36l10h,MrDCT,10,Wed May 20 14:25:25 2015 UTC,"That's been a common complaint along with how adding friends currently is handled. The staff have said many times already they plan on adding a proper pause feature as well as easier friend adding and all that soon possibly in the next update. Should that have been in before leaving Alpha? yes but I can't comment on how many people are working on Galaxy and I am sure they had to have at least a decent beta release ready by time Witcher 3 dropped since CDPR is using GOG to issue patches and DLC for the game for those who didn't buy it on Steam. Plus I am also sure the extra interest that they seemed to had concerning the client when Valve pulled the paid mods thing also may of had something to do with it since they were by that point handing out Alpha keys left and right plus you had alot of people asking for keys and malicious people exploiting the intrest by trying to pass off malware as the client.    Plus I am sure they are also swamped with other things, since it's been hinted at that more then a few interesting releases are heading our way which is probley tying up the testing team, they are still trying to get the kinks worked out of the new my account page and getting the remaining games that aren't yet supported by the client supported and if Alone in the Dark 1-3 was any indication getting the games with other versions as extras like Wizardry 7 which has Wizardry Gold and the original DOS version as a extra and Broken Sword DC which has the orginal version also as a extra set up as separate titles instead of just being in the ""extras"" since Alone 2 and 3 were due to licensing issues/reasons we put in as a bonus when you bought Alone 1 and so were put in the extras section but now are listed as separate games in your account but still come with Alone 1 when you buy it."
gog,36l10h,RavenholmDX,2,Wed May 20 04:28:30 2015 UTC,"As you mentioned yourself, it's a beta (realistically, it's an alpha). If you look at modern web browsers, like Firefox, when you're downloading a file, there's an x beside the download progress. If you click this it cancels the download, without prompt, so GOG aren't exactly doing anything out of the ordinary."

If you exit out of galaxy, the download will stop at that point and RESUME at the download point when the program is run again.  In other words, galaxy pauses the download when it is closed.  People should know this about galaxy."

Have you ever pressed a button with a big X on it, and had it pause?   There is really no need to be so sarcastic about it.  The software is essentially an Alpha, not everything they intend to be in there is in there yet."
gog,36l10h,AfterLemon,2,Wed May 20 15:34:39 2015 UTC,He didn't click it expecting it to be cancel but to remove the download from the queue and expect that it could be resumed later.    You would very much not expect a product based around large downloads these days to release with no ability to resume/pause.  There's no real defending it was a stupid thing to have missing in a release even if it's an alpha or beta.  The confusion is happening because nobody expects a product like this to be missing such a very basic feature so they assume it's a poor UI and click the one option they have.
gog,36me1j,fgtuaten,2,Wed May 20 13:20:05 2015 UTC,"I recommend Afterburner because you can display other information other than FPS too, like GPU/CPU usage and temp. Only downside is, I believe it doesn't work with 64 bit applications."

If you're not, then you could always use other programs like Fraps.  Personally, since I have an NZXT CPU cooler, I have the NZXT CAM software, which can display FPS as well.  You can use CAM even if you don't have an NZXT cooler.  It will still monitor CPU load and temps, as well as GPU load, temps, and fan speeds, and still offer the FPS counter as well."

gog,36hj47,Snakorn,1 point,Tue May 19 13:15:21 2015 UTC,"hmm.. it's possible that Galaxycommunicationservice is what the client uses to communicate to GOG's servers, I believe Steam has something similar. I recall one of the blues/GOG staff mention during the Alpha that they store play time on their servers so if that program is in fact what the client currently uses to communicate with GOG's servers then if it doesn't work when playing Witcher 3 then it's not tracking your playtime and sending the info to the servers."

gog,36g8n4,AnarquistaLibre,15,Tue May 19 03:41:59 2015 UTC,"You mean non-DRM only?  What I do is, I try to assess the value of things with and without drm. For example, if I paid $60 for a game and 2 years from now the company who made the game said ""Hey, Im revoking everyone's right to play this game! We are sending people to your house to delete the game right now"", then I would be really mad. But if I paid $5 for a game and the same thing happened, I would only be a little bit upset.    So I'll only pay full price for a game (or a music, or movie) if I can have the same level of control as I had with my old genesis games or vhs movies. At the same time, Im at peace with the fact that the $5 game I bought on steam can become unaccessible in the future (for various reasons), since the amount of entertainment I had with that product was already worth the small price I paid."

gog,36g8n4,Flamingtomato,2,Sat May 23 10:15:00 2015 UTC,The problem is i don't think they'd have have the right to remove the drm from all the games without getting permission from the publishers in the first place
gog,36g8n4,MrDCT,6,Sun May 24 12:42:38 2015 UTC,"I can't stand DRM or really any nasty form of copy protection for that matter. Ever since I was a kid and my parents bought me a copy of Last Ninja on the c64 and the copy protection on that first batch of copies was nasty, so nasty it could break your disk drive since the commodore 64 1541 disk drive had a separate cpu built into it and so System 3 used that to make the drive to bump to various sectors on the disk where the code was spread out so say part of level 1 would be in say sector 1 another part was in sector 20 and another in sector 10 this was to make it harder to copy the disks as you would have to crack it and then resemble the data and this copy protection scheme often causing malfunctions. I happened to have been one of those poor souls that had that happen to them. They sent me a replacement disk without that copy protection scheme on it but still was BS. Then there was Chronicles of Riddick which used Tages DRM a truly evil DRM scheme that  little drm program hooks up in every little space on your harddrive and is a pain to get rid of, let alone to get it working since it didn't play well with newer OS's and often could lead to it screwing up your system, never had it happen but it was a bitch to get off my machine it was worse then most viruses.   So yeah I don't like DRM, now not all games on Steam use DRM even Valve's silly CEG DRM which is stupid since that was cracked years ago. But I don't buy games on Steam, Origin or Uplay if I can avoid it not just because of DRM but also I can't stand Valve's anti-consumer behaviour alot of the time. ""Oh your not buying a game or even a license your buying a subscription"", ""you have to agree to wave your right to sue us or we won't let you play your games"" not to mention their customer service is shit second only to EA's which when my Origin account got hacked into I couldn't for the life of me get any assistance, I had to go through this stupid help system and through pure trial and error get to the point where it was like okay you need to talk to one of our reps about this and there was no live chat option nor was there a damn number to call despite saying I had to call them.. instead was a link to their help forums and that just made me want to punch a nun. Since all I got was a bunch of clowns who couldn't take two seconds to read anything else outside of the thread title and kept posting the same damn solutions that I had said in my original posting I already did(that damn auto help menu) and just need a number to call.   ""oh just do this, this and that and you will get the number"" 'hey didn't you already read my initial post I said I already tried that and just got a message that I had to call them and listed the hours of operation and gave a link to this forum and that was it' ""Oh you just need to do everything you just told us you did and you will get the number""...  For the record I did get the account back under my control by myself it was actually quite easy seems he didn't figure I could reset the login info back by clicking on a link on a email the system sent me when he changed the log in and thus bypassing the security question that he changed but still need EA to either give me the answer to said changed security question since I can not revert my user name or make any other changes to the account and such till they do or set it back to default.   Oh and don't get me started on how EA's customer service was to people wanting refunds on Sim City.. truly disgusting, threats of locking out their Origin accounts and such if they kept pressing the issue. It wouldn't shock me if Valve's Customer service hadn't pulled that stunt a time of two. But yeah I can't stand Steam, Origin, Uplay, ect."
gog,36g8n4,ChrisTX4,2,Tue May 19 04:45:39 2015 UTC,"I use both Steam and GOG, and for the most part, I can't say I'm too bothered by Steam as an application. However, I live in Germany: Due to regional restrictions because Valve never implemented legally binding age checks which they would have to in order to sell certain (violent) games, a lot of games sold on the Steam store are censored for me. Even worse, there's some games which are IP-restricted against Germany. I purchased Sleeping Dogs: DE while being in Austria only to return here and be greeted with a message that the game cannot be run while residing in Germany. The retail copies did not have such a notice, mind you. So, yeah Steam as a DRM is bothering me a lot.  However, I wouldn't say DRM-freedom is the reason to become a GOG customer if you're already a Steam user and not bothered by it. The customer support, goodies, and the fact that the games you purchase bloody well work unlike their Steam counterparts (hi there Saints Row 2, Jade Empire and a special greeting to Commandos which was not even launchable for anyone until last October or so) are in my opinion better suited to convince Steam users of giving it a bash.

Which I expect it to once this thing gets closer to final. Using it is a little less intuitive than I would like for it to be but I think that can improve over time as well. My wish list for the client are pretty much feature requests like different Library layouts and options add friend via email etc little things like that. Overall I quite happy with it and if they can continue to expand their game library then I can easily see myself switch to it from Steam given the DRM freedom as well as not only having but having a great customer support staff.

gog,362no4,Asyx,1 point,Fri May 15 17:14:54 2015 UTC,Do you have Paysafe cards in the US? That's the only prepaid card they offer. You can use PayPal otherwise. Then you pay an US company that then pays CDPR.   Or you just tell your bank to stop being stupid and unlock international transactions.
gog,362no4,jordguitar,1 point,Fri May 15 21:45:01 2015 UTC,"Generally if it is Visa or Mastercard, it should just work as long as the contact info is the same on the prepaid card as it is for the actual order.  GOG does process US orders in the US."

gog,35zfil,DakotaThrice,6,Thu May 14 22:13:29 2015 UTC,Guaranteed availability at a steady speed. I'd rather have that then have a download crawling along because only three other people bought the game and only one of those is ever online.
gog,35zfil,DakotaThrice,7,Thu May 14 21:03:17 2015 UTC,"It would most likely be a mixed approach, quite like Blizzard's: several cdn's seeding all the games + other peers. That way, you have guaranteed speeds + you have redundancy for whenever a new popular game (Witcher 3, hint hint) is released. Besides, if you have other gogers in your local network (or even another computer of your own with the game downloaded), you'll get crazy download speeds from your local peers.  tl;dr: If done smart (not difficult) - please yes!"
gog,35zfil,supamesican,2,Thu May 14 21:43:07 2015 UTC,That's how I am picturing it.  You have a guaranteed minimum speed (even if you aren't seeding) and your speed could improve according to what tier you fall into with your upload speed.
gog,35zfil,overrated44,2,Thu May 14 22:08:58 2015 UTC,I've experienced it with Blizzard and I think in their case it's totally feasible if only for the sheer size of the userbase.

gog,35redt,Gateway2009,1 point,Sat May 16 22:19:36 2015 UTC,"That is not the same thing at all. As I understand them, concurrent connections are about more effectively and consistently utilizing higher bandwidth; 10 connections on a 25 Mbps bandwidth pipeline will more effectively use the whole 25 Mbps pipe than just 1 connection, and it will be more consistently high, but the program will still use a significant portion of the available bandwidth if allowed to do so."
gog,35redt,Onihikage,7,Sun May 17 05:12:33 2015 UTC,I think if you just shut down the program it won't delete what's downloaded already.  It will resume where it left off when the program was shut down.

gog,35redt,MrDCT,6,Wed May 13 01:29:31 2015 UTC,"It's lighter because Steam downloads partially compressed files, according to GOG staff Galaxy will do the same, they are still working on it. I don't doubt they pushed the Beta out due to the increassed intrest in the client and the release of the Witcher 3 which the retail versions will use GOG for pushing out patches and DLC."
gog,35redt,MrDCT,0,Wed May 13 04:16:25 2015 UTC,is there a noticeable quality difference in compressing that much?
gog,35redt,aiusepsi,3,Wed May 13 04:19:26 2015 UTC,"yeah. Take the regular installers the installer for say Trails in the Sky is 1.56 Gigs, now downloading it via Galaxy was around 2.25 Gigs if I recall.  that's a difference of 0.69, but you could compress it more. If I used the max compression setting in say Winrar I could compress each file in the directory by 50/60 to 98% to 99%."
gog,35redt,Dr_Murke,3,Wed May 13 04:29:40 2015 UTC,"If you mean, will things like textures have lower visual quality, no. It's lossless compression, not lossy compression like JPEG or MP3."

gog,35redt,MrDCT,-3,Tue May 12 22:53:49 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest. Having a semi-clear interface and a pause button is the most minimal thing a download manager needs. the old GOG download manager, though simple as it may be, has these features already. Even for a beta release, this is ridiculous. You may as well not release it when you're at the point that downloading the games is a difficult task..."
gog,35redt,king_of_the_universe,3,Tue May 12 23:10:20 2015 UTC,Sorry but beta is beta. Yeah I'm not pleased quite yet with Galaxy but I know it's a work in progress and that not everything is implemented quite yet. It's just one of those things you just have to deal with at this point.  I've been interested in how they will do some of the multiplayer games or if any of it is working yet in that regard.
gog,35redt,MrDCT,-1,Wed May 13 00:11:53 2015 UTC,It's a beta release for an optional program. Rage will get you downvoted maybe even banned should you go overboard. :)

gog,35nlz0,AnxiousInfusion,7,Tue May 12 00:43:18 2015 UTC,They just released several today!  I know what I'm playing this weekend.
gog,35nlz0,mrmodeste2,6,Tue May 12 02:15:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't know how this can significantly increase the proportion of big editors on this website. Of course, there will be more players attracted by the client, and its functionalities, which I hope will be on par with Steam's. It may also make games focusing on multiplayer more viable, thanks to the promised matchmaking system that would allow us to bypass the GameRanger & Co trick.  However, it is still a DRM-free approach, and I have the feeling that most AAA publishers won't back-pedal on that aspect of their commercial practices. A DRM is an excellent way to ensure that only one player will be able to play the licence they bought at a time. Considering how huge are the financial objectives of big studios, I would be tempted to say they won't be excited by the financial uncertainty of selling DRM-free licences, that may be shared with other players.  I will be honest, maybe I am in a minority, but when I buy multiplayers games such as Empire Earth, or Unreal Tournament on GoG, I play LANs with a single copie that I share among my friends. I doubt they buy it afterwards. I also sometimes share copies of single player games I have, and I reckon that by acting so, I am not being fair towards the editor that trusts me.  Anyway, I may also be talking completly out of my ass. Maybe editors think they will be reaching a niche market that wouldn't have bought their games if they were under a DRM. Maybe GoG also has a significantly lower cut than Steam, that may prove profitable."
gog,35nlz0,spiffybaldguy,1 point,Tue May 12 10:13:38 2015 UTC,"I would be interested to see how this plays out, I think AAA publishers may avoid it initially but I have one simple thought process:  Reach as many as you can, it will make you more money. I hate platform exclusives etc. EA does not get any of my business. I can live without their games.  Those who chose to pirate for w/e reasons they have, are probably going to continue it, so its not really something that's ever going to go away.  Places like GoG make it less invasive for me."
gog,35nlz0,mrmodeste2,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:22:37 2015 UTC,"I agree on your stance on pirating. However, I am pretty sure all major publishers have already well understood how this works.

gog,35nlz0,LuisLN,2,Tue May 12 11:31:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think GOG Galaxy will survive if it's just part of a reactionary movement.  How they're planning on building a community is beyond me, but I hope they make it."

I think GOG Galaxy is just an extension of it, not the entire platform, like Steam.  GOG Galaxy makes it more accessible and increases the functionality of their platform but seeing as the majority of it is optional, I do not see it as their platform so to speak."
gog,35nlz0,MrDCT,8,Tue May 12 05:42:31 2015 UTC,"you do know GOG has been around for close too 7 years now(they started in 2008) and in that time grew from a small struggling platform(it was a possibility in 2011 that both CD Projekt and GOG may not have made it as GOG was barely breaking even) with a small niche community selling only a few old games and having weeks with no releases to selling old games and a few established indies to selling old games, indies(both established and new releases) and a few AAA titles that had been out for sometime to where they are now being viewed as the second largest PC digital store front, 1084 games, getting even more AAA titles, able to become a actual publisher(they published their first two titles about a week ago), having enough sway to help work deals between rights holders, launching their own DRM free client, ect and honestly they just seem to keep growing and that is because more and more people had been supporting the store. Sure there are quite a few people who are turning to GOG soley based on Valve's paid modding fiasco being the last straw for them but GOG had been growing before that and sure some of those who jumped to GOG from Steam over the mod incident may wander back but they are seem to be small minority, since by the looks of things many forgave Valve after they stopped the Paid mods and ""apologized"" or seen the error of their ways (I use the quotes because Valve didn't apologize for shit) which they really didn't if you read their statement, they just said it may have been a poor decision to use Skyrim as it was a well established 3 year old game by that point with 3 years of free mods. Which honestly wasn't the only dumb thing about that move. I could give a laundry list of things they did wrong with that but eh it's done and over but Valve has said they are still feeling it's a solid idea.   Point is yes you see posts about leaving steam for GOG because of you know and because of Galaxy but as I said they are seeming to be a small minority. Just like those who are bitching about Galaxy ruining their GOG. But the community has been well established before Galaxy just there are more people joining it because of Galaxy for many reasons, there are those who felt GOG didn't have the big name games which they seem to be getting now, there are those who just prefer to have a client and all the features that come with them now they now got one, there are those who wanted to suppourt GOG but didn't like how updates worked on the pre-galaxy system now they can get easy auto updates with a option to roll it back in case the update screws something up(it does happen the PC version of Elminage Gothic when it was only on Steam had a update that wiped out all the game files), there are those who didn't like the idea of losing multiplayer from the GOG versions because the original version used Steamworks now that shouldn't be a issue with Galaxy's API though you do get idiots claiming that it makes the game loaded with DRM'd Multiplayer. Still there are many reasons why Galaxy could grow GOG's established customer base other then ""I am pissed at Valve so I am going to GOG"" and those reasons it seems are the main reasons why since GOG released the Beta of Galaxy more people have been going there."
gog,35nlz0,hardolaf,2,Tue May 12 06:21:10 2015 UTC,"There are few in the actual community that feel Galaxy is actually bad. There are a few who complain that it isn't opensource though. People complaining about GOG Galaxy aren't doing it on the fora. Like everything else from GOG, Galaxy is optional. Don't like the downloader? Get you're own, there's some damn good options. Don't like Galaxy? Don't use it."
gog,35nlz0,MrDCT,1 point,Tue May 12 06:53:30 2015 UTC,I know. Hell there are ones that think having Galaxy required for online multiplayer for games that use Galaxy's API since it used Steamworks is a form of DRM.

If we decide to work together, we can offer you the option to get an advance on your game's future sales. There are two ways we can handle royalties: 1. A standard 70/30 (Developer/GOG) split with no advance on royalties. 2. You get an advance on the royalties from your game. In this case, 60/40 royalties split will be in effect until the advance is recouped. Afterwards, we'll switch the split to the standard 70/30."

But the lack of manual sorting really stings, at least for me anyway. Also don't care for having Pages instead of just one long list but I get the reasons for that change since when you hit 400+ games it just starts to take forever to load up your libary especially in the old virtual shelf system. I have 609 games and it took what felt like a eternity for my library to load up even on a decent broadband connection.    Outside of those few quirks I like it but like all things you got people who are pitching a complete fit because it's ""different"" honestly every-time GOG changes something or does something different you have the same people just post bitch posts on the boards till their fingers bleed. My personal favorite was when GOG started selling newer games, oh the complaints from that one. ""Oh GOG may as well start selling Steam keys now"" or ""What the hell no one wants to buy new games on GOG, now that they are selling new games they are going to stop getting the old ones and no one will buy anything""   Then there was the fit that happened when they started unbundling games, that was annoying as the entire announcement thread quickly devolved into a small group of the vocal minority circle jerk with them just agreeing with how stupid it was while basically blowing off or in some cases even down repping those who disagreed."
gog,35kra3,MrDCT,2,Mon May 11 17:15:47 2015 UTC,"100% agreed, I get that manual sorting is nice... but people are blowing crap way out of proportion. It's kind of sad that there are people on GOG that literally complain over everything GOG does and want it to stay niche. If I was GOG I would just ignore it for the most part and do what you think is best."
gog,35kra3,MrDCT,2,Mon May 11 17:22:53 2015 UTC,"That seems what they been doing lately. I do admit I think part of the issue was when GOG was starting out it was niche and had a small but loyal following and GOG wanting to please their base often did things that was asked since at that time they were the majority of GOG's users but now they aren't they are a very small minority and I think it's killing them that their opinons don't matter much anymore. Me personally I don't care what GOG does if it makes them money and helps them grow so long as GOG remains DRM Free and customer friendly.  Since in the PC space we need real viable options/alternatives to the established big storefront that being Steam, not a knock on Steam but having options are always a good thing."
gog,35kra3,MrDCT,3,Mon May 11 17:39:27 2015 UTC,"Very true, as long as GOG stays DRM free... I personally don't care what GOG does either. The PC realm needs competition, otherwise Steam will do whatever they want without us being able to say anything like they do now."

gog,35h5tl,invenio78,6,Sun May 10 15:30:38 2015 UTC,I wouldn't count on anything like that for the foreseeable future.  They have been working on Galaxy for well over a year and it's pretty raw.  But give it a couple of years and who knows.
gog,35h5tl,Totenglocke42,1 point,Sun May 10 18:32:12 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, what do you find ""pretty raw"" about Galaxy?"
gog,35h5tl,invenio78,1 point,Mon May 11 10:36:05 2015 UTC,"""Raw"" as in unpolished and unfinished.  But that's ok, after all it is in beta and not a final product.  In comparison to the steam client, it's been out for years, and valve has much more resources for development.  I think Galaxy is a good start, but it is nowhere near steam in terms of options and function.  I think we will probably have to wait a few years between a fair comparison between galaxy and steam can be made."
gog,35h5tl,Totenglocke42,1 point,Mon May 11 11:53:50 2015 UTC,What do you find unpolished? It's much nicer looking than Steam and just as easy to use.
gog,35h5tl,invenio78,1 point,Mon May 11 12:27:20 2015 UTC,"Examples would include:   No voice chat. Adding contacts is cumbersome, you have to find a review or forum posting to add people to your contact list.  This should be a simple name or email search. No game overlay. I haven't tried this, but apparently you can't pause downloads.  So if you are downloading a 10 GB file and you lose connection 9 GB in, you have to start from the beginning. No download rate limiter. Lack of Achievements. No streaming functions to other devices/TV's. lack of Mod management. No cloud save games.   Just to name a few.  Like I said, it's a good start considering it's beta.  But certainly pales in comparison to the functionality of steam."
gog,35h5tl,Totenglocke42,0,Mon May 11 12:52:15 2015 UTC,"It makes me sad that there are people who view ""lack of pointless achievements"" as a flaw. They'll probably never do cloud storage because there's no DRM - if you want to back it up, it's quite easy to do on your own without them having to pay for server space."
gog,35h5tl,invenio78,2,Mon May 11 12:57:13 2015 UTC,"I actually don't care about achievements, but to say it's not important would be false as there are many gamers that do.  If you don't care about a specific feature, that is fine.  But if there are those that do, they may decide to buy the game on steam instead of GOG because GOG has less features for the same game.  Cloud storage of saves would be important not just because of backups, but the fact that many people play their games on multiple computers (like a desktop at home and laptop when away).  Copying save files to usb drives back and forth is quite cumbersome.  Not to mention that if your computer dies and you don't have a recent full backup, you lose your game saves.  I don't view the lack of features, flaws per se.  But it would be naive to say that Galaxy is not a direct competitor to steam.  So it is fair to make feature comparisons between the two, IMHO."

When the game is on Steam and the kids play via Family Share, I am locked out of my account.  With GOG, they can play a game from my account and I am free to use Steam or whatever I choose to do.  Before anyone says ""piracy"" I am talking about them playing the game that I paid for exactly like Family Share but without restrictions."
gog,35eiiq,docfate,14,Sat May 9 16:20:52 2015 UTC,"That's what GOG is all about really. DRM is designed to keep people from pirating stuff, but that leaves out the old tradition of letting your friends and family borrow your games."
gog,35eiiq,TheTyk,5,Sat May 9 22:23:46 2015 UTC,"In Germany we call this cultural exchange (= kultureller Austausch), i.e. we are allowed to make copies of our CDs and share it with friends and family, although only a short amount (maybe around ~7), but there is no set number. But don't be mistaken, we have strict rules for piracy, I'd say too strict.  I think the same applies to GoG, you share games with friends and family to exchange experiences with each other. That's a natural part of social life. And it also raises the awareness for GoG and DRM-free games in general."
gog,35eiiq,RagingMayo,8,Sun May 10 11:27:41 2015 UTC,DRM free also means a lot when you realize you have thousands of dollars worth of games on an account that if anything happened to it you basically instantly lose them all.  That something can include the company deciding to ban your account.
gog,35eiiq,Whadios,5,Sun May 10 03:59:21 2015 UTC,"This is so understated.  People don't realize that their 200 games on steam could be gone in a second if valve says so.  With GOG, even if your account were banned for some reason, the games you own and payed for can still be backed up and installed later."

I think it's more messed up that videogames do not let you do this anymore. If I buy and read a book, my roommate can read the book when I am done with it. When I finish playing a game it sits in my Steam-account doing nothing...Sharing with people out of your own home could be seen as piracy, but letting your kids play a game you payed for just seems normal to me (It's the way it was when I was a child anyway)"
gog,35eiiq,Shaka1277,4,Sun May 10 11:26:13 2015 UTC,I do this with my brother. I think it's even more morally justifiable than steam library sharing because generally I pay more upfront.

gog,35eiiq,SnowGabe,29,Mon May 11 05:25:00 2015 UTC,"Generally I find GOG a superior alternative to Steam:   30 day money back guarantee (Steam practically never offers refunds and funds are only refunded to Steam Wallet) No DRM Against regional pricing No regional restrictions GOG team actively tests patches and ensures that everything is working Superior customer support Privacy, no personal information is saved when paying etc. Competition is always good for gamers - we can't let Steam become a monopoly"
gog,35eiiq,IronicTitanium,7,Sat May 9 18:55:03 2015 UTC,Against regional pricing   I'm not sure you can really say this anymore given the fact that regional pricing is included on many games listed on GOG at this point.
gog,35eiiq,SynysterSaint,16,Sat May 9 19:11:41 2015 UTC,"GOG is against regional pricing as a concept, but business isn't about being the most ardent player. GOG is asking publishers three things: first, to sell their games without any DRM; second, to sell their games at a flat global price; third, to sell their DRM-free, flat-rate games on GOG, the Zune to Steam's iPod, while Steam doesn't have any such requests for publishers. From the perspective of the studios GOG is courting, those are ludicrous requests. GOG needs to compromise to get studios into their corner before any progress can be made. DRM's obliteration is the foundation of GOG's mission statement, so it makes sense that regional pricing is where GOG chose to shift themselves into a more favorable position.  GOG may one day have enough leverage to demand (not just request, but demand) that studios release DRM-free games at a flat global price. But that can't happen until the industry culture changes, and GOG needs to compromise their way into a larger market share before they can change the culture. It's for that reason I count GOG being anti-regional pricing in their favor even if they're hypocritical about the topic today.  And, moreover, the managing director made a bold promise that regional pricing on older titles will be done as fairly as possible:   TheEnigmaticT earlier mentioned that he would eat his hat if we ever brought DRM to GOG.com. I'm going to go one step further: by the end of this year, I'm making the promise that we will have converted our classic catalog over to fair regional pricing as outlined above [note: read the full link for the pricing breakdown]. If not, we'll set up a record a video of some horrible public shaming for me, TheEnigmaticT, and w0rma. In fact, you know what? Feel free to make suggestions below for something appropriate (but also safe enough that we won't get the video banned on YouTube) so you feel that we're motivated to get this done quickly. I'll pick one that's scary enough from the comments below and we'll let you know which one we're sticking to."
gog,35eiiq,ProtonixChaos,5,Sat May 9 20:20:17 2015 UTC,"Flat pricing is bad. Regional pricing is the way to go, not the way it was implemented, but fair regional pricing should be the way to go. You can't charge the same way someone in the US than someone in Bolivia."
gog,35eiiq,invenio78,3,Sat May 9 22:50:18 2015 UTC,"I humbly disagree.  Goods typically are priced based on what production, transportation, and middle man costs are and NOT by where you live or how much your country makes.  Food, gasoline, computers, etc... all follow this model.  Since the cost of making a game and downloading it is pretty much equal anywhere in the world, it should cost the same.  Not to mention you could have a Bolivian millionaire buying games as well as some college kid in the US who is $200,000 in debt. So why should the millionaire pay $5 and the poor college kid pay $20 for the same product? The regional pricing theory completely breaks down when applied to individuals.  GOG only does regional pricing on about 5% of their entire catalog and will refund certain regions even in that small group of games.  So even GOG seems to be ""kind of against"" regional pricing even though they do practice it with a small minority of their games."
gog,35eiiq,Spartin115,3,Sat May 9 23:06:37 2015 UTC,No regional restrictions huh? Than why does GOG refuse to let me buy Hotline Miami 2 then? #Australian
gog,35eiiq,invenio78,2,Sun May 10 01:42:25 2015 UTC,If you use a ip address from another country (through VPN for example) you should be able to buy it.  I wonder why they don't sell Hotline Miami 2 in Australia?
gog,35eiiq,invenio78,5,Sun May 10 01:55:25 2015 UTC,It was refused a rating here due to an implied rape scene in the game.

gog,35a95n,pdxphreek,3,Fri May 8 18:49:05 2015 UTC,"Late reply, but I have the first game + expansions.   Keep in mind I played these in german back in 2004, so I can't speak for the quality of the VAs in english. I heard it was pretty bad (that's also why I don't know if I can recommend Gothic 1/2).  The first game and it's expansions were some of my favorite games for the PC. Very nice soundtrack, maybe a bit repetitive after a while. Graphics were very good for 2004 and it didn't age too much in my opinion.   Story is interesting with a few plot twists. The base game and the first expansion are basically the same timeline from the view of two different main characters and the second expansion merges and finishes the storylines.  Gameplay is pretty unique, you basically have your avatar and depending on the map you can build up light or dark side races, RTS style. You may also summon other heros which are roughly as strong as your PC, and in some places you can only use the heros and your avatar.   You loot enemies for gear and valuables, you level up, there are merchants, questgivers, etc. Basically it's a mix of cRPG and RTS. I hadn't played anything like it before.  I think it's worth a try, though the german voiceacting was great so that might have to do with it.  Spellforce 2 is also nice. It continues in the same vein (improved graphics, sound, small gameplay changes), but with a completely different setting. It is generally agreed upon that it's not as good as the first one though (by enthusiasts :P).  The first expansion is pretty weak and the other two I can't say much about because they came out like 4-6 years later and were made by a different developer. I can't imagine they're that good.  tl;dr: Get the first one with the two expansions if the gameplay interests you, then if you want more get the second one."

gog,356duw,BKGaming_,2,Thu May 7 23:49:01 2015 UTC,I believe Galaxy is essentially a Chrome browser if I'm not mistaken... or I remember reading that anyway.
gog,356duw,TroyPowers,2,Thu May 7 17:57:46 2015 UTC,"chromium, not chrome. big difference."
gog,354qlr,Mjone77,8,Thu May 7 02:21:11 2015 UTC,"Not yet, as far as I can see. Hopefully they'll add this feature later."
gog,354qlr,ClownsAreATen,4,Thu May 7 04:02:47 2015 UTC,welp this piece of software is going to collect dust for me until that feature gets implemented
gog,354qlr,jersits,3,Thu May 7 15:54:14 2015 UTC,"I hate all the different games in different launchers. A launcher connecting all my Accounts is what i hope for, I personally have no other reason to try/use GoG Galaxy.  I know this would still require gog to start the individual launcher but I would love  to have a complete library in one launcher  I hope they add this!"
gog,354qlr,golem1988,2,Fri May 8 23:22:12 2015 UTC,"This is something I assumed they meant when they said ""Cross-play"" but clearly was incorrect. Hopefully it will be added later, but for business-y reasons it wouldn't be smart. Most of my games come from Humble Bundle usually, and being able to add all of those would negate me buying them all through Gog again. Of course, if they just want people to start using their platform, it would be killer.  I don't know if Steam/Origin would ever work."
gog,355dy4,Vaultnishi,3,Thu May 7 06:33:52 2015 UTC,not really sure as right now there are only two games that support it Witcher 2 and Witcher Adventure game and I haven't tested either.

gog,352mrx,MisterFunktastic,2,Wed May 6 16:16:45 2015 UTC,"Keeping the downloader is completely up to you but it's not necessary anymore as you can still obtain the installers from either the site directly or by going to the game's extras in the client. Pending if you want to have the game installers for archival purposes if your using Windows go to computer and then click the uninstall or change program option at the top and then you will be taken to a list of installed programs. Just search through till you find the game(s) you want to uninstall  See 4 Yes, simply run the scan option in the client by clicking the + and select scan and import folders and point it in the location of the game(s) you want to add. If that doesn't work then try to find the game in your library via the client and click on it, then when it brings up it's page click the more button and then manage and then import folder."
gog,352mrx,MrDCT,2,Wed May 6 18:14:31 2015 UTC,You don't get installers anymore with Galaxy. It grabs fully unpacked games from servers then does things to make it recognized within the OS.  The temp folder that the stuff gets downloaded to is only used as temporary storage until the entire download is done  and then moved to it's final destination.
gog,352mrx,jordguitar,3,Wed May 6 22:33:21 2015 UTC,"yes you do, as I said they are just a separate download found in the extras(More->download extras). See: http://i.imgur.com/8zzB4E9.jpg?1"

gog,34xypn,krupted,1 point,Wed May 6 18:11:33 2015 UTC,"It isn't marked as ""Coming Soon"". I think rather than integration, it just means you can play games online with friends who have the Steam versions, rather than being locked into the Gog system.

gog,34xuev,BKGaming_,2,Tue May 5 17:28:41 2015 UTC,Well 1. they are planning on adding a roll back feature to the client so if anything does go wrong with a update you can just roll it back to the previous version. 2. If you install the game directly from the client then it deletes the installer after install but you can download the installer separately these are found by going to the game's page in Galaxy either by clicking on it's entery in your libary or if it's a game you had already installed then click on it in the sidebar and then click more and then download extras there you will see the traditional game installer   Example: http://i.imgur.com/8zzB4E9.jpg?1
gog,34xuev,sahyee,2,Tue May 5 17:56:54 2015 UTC,If you install the game directly from the client then it deletes the installer after install but you can download the installer separately   That sounds like a huge waste of bandwidth.   Why wouldn't Galaxy just ask if you'd like to keep the installation file for backup purposes?
gog,34xuev,Superneedles,5,Tue May 5 18:08:17 2015 UTC,"It doesn't actually download the installer, it's like Steam it directly writes the games files to your hard-drive. That's why you got to download the installer separately as a backup. I'd imagine they will include some form of a backup feature at some point though.  EDIT: There are some conflicting reports that this might not be true for every game. I have always seen games write directly to the hard drive though."

gog,34xzvh,sirdupre,2,Tue May 5 14:26:04 2015 UTC,"feature thoughts, does GOG have an API for querying an SHA or MD5 has of the files, to detect corruption, and perhaps alert the user of your tool?  I've had a few hdd's go out, but before then were having issues being reliable, without me noticing (yay corruption!)"
gog,34xzvh,prozacgod,2,Tue May 5 19:50:02 2015 UTC,"Yes actually the script already supports this. The MD5 info comes straight from GOG and it is fetched during 'update' command.  If you want to verify your collection, you can just run ""gogrepo.py verify"" and it will validate all known MD5 as well, and report any corrupted files. If you pass -delete flag, it will also delete them.  Then next time you gogrepo.py download, it will re-fetch that file.  This could be improved to only download broken chunks etc but I haven't implemented this. I don't mind just re-downloading the file, and it's quite rare that the file is corrupt during download.  TL;DR: verify command will validate GOG-provided MD5 for (almost) all installer files!"

gog,34xzvh,Silent_Shadow_117,1 point,Tue May 5 20:27:39 2015 UTC,"So, what does this do that the Galaxy launcher won't?  Is it just the idea of keeping all the content you own downloaded and up to date, even though you may not actually install it?"
gog,34xzvh,Silent_Shadow_117,1 point,Wed May 6 04:34:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah basically downloading everything (installers, bonus, etc) you bought and own, including serial number information for games that have them (such as NWN). This is basically a ""sync"" script that you can run as you like, or in a cronjob so you have the latest content.  I like having my own copy and found it tedious to manually download (and download updates).  In addition this script makes it dead easy to verify the integrity of the files you have... to make sure they're valid, unzippable, etc.  This script isn't for everybody.. if you're someone that installs games on demand, and you're fine with GOG holding it all for you (just like steam does) then no real need for this!  If you're someone that wants your own offline copy of your DRM-free stuff (which is a use case GOG fully supports), then this script may help you keep everything synced with minimal manual effort."
gog,34w12h,Tizaki,8,Tue May 5 00:53:21 2015 UTC,I expect Galaxy to be full service. I expect it to cover all aspects of what I want to do within gaming. Anything less would make it inferior to Steam and therefore undesirable to the mass market.  Sadly it is only in alpha now so I cannot enjoy these features...yet.
gog,34w12h,orge121,6,Tue May 5 04:08:14 2015 UTC,"I look forward to it, I also hope they have a mod hosting service like Steam does, not because it needs it but Steam is trying to DRM mods and now trying to sell them back to the public. It is basically why buy on GoG when mods are locked out for you if you don't get it from Steam. Which is wrong, I hope see the good side win the fight."
gog,34w12h,Zalpha,3,Tue May 5 06:56:03 2015 UTC,Mods are not locked for you. I played heavily modded Skyrim without single mod from Steam workshop.
gog,34w12h,SirYoggi,3,Tue May 5 07:52:33 2015 UTC,Yeah but certian mods can only be gotten through the Steam Workshop. On a site like the Nexus they are available to all.

gog,34w12h,supamesican,3,Tue May 5 01:33:38 2015 UTC,Galaxy needs social. Text chat + Group chat would be a huge step forward. Also achievements and stuff.
gog,34w12h,ProtonixChaos,2,Tue May 5 16:32:41 2015 UTC,oh chat functions like this: http://www.gog.com/bundles/gogplugingalaxylandingpage/img/sections/community/screen-chat-1x.png and Achivements like this:http://media1.gameinformer.com/filestorage/CommunityServer.Components.SiteFiles/imagefeed/featured/GOG/galaxy/GOGGalAchieve-610.jpg
gog,34w12h,MrDCT,2,Tue May 5 17:38:53 2015 UTC,"I think it could maybe do both.  The issue with doing the social stuff is that since it's a completely optional thing, implementing the social would make it ""required"" to chat with friends.  They'd have to have another way of doing the community on the website (like the Facebook browser chat) and also let you do it on the client.  I would enjoy social services though, as of right now the launcher is really just a nice way of organizing games, not that that's bad (I really like the look of it so far).  Plus it is just an alpha, so obviously it's not what we'll get in the end.  Scratch that I just watched the Galaxy promo video again and realized it mentioned chatting with friends.  In that case I'm definitely anticipating it, I'd love to be able to switch over from Steam entirely (or for the most part) and be a part of a new community."
gog,34w12h,Silent_Shadow_117,2,Tue May 5 03:59:03 2015 UTC,"It will have the stuff people have come to expect out of their clients such as community intergration, friends lists, chat, achivements, ect. but like the client itself they are all optional so if you just want to use them you can turn them off, according to the blues/GOG staff just about every feature in Galaxy is planned to be optional and can be turned off or in the case of downloading games you can either install the game through the client or download the traditional installer file."
gog,34w12h,MrDCT,0,Tue May 5 11:52:18 2015 UTC,"I wonder if cross-platform will apply to friends lists and chatting. Imagine seeing a little Steam symbol next to some friends, but still being able to talk to them. That would be the absolute coolest thing ever."
gog,34w12h,J0llyRoger,2,Tue May 5 16:58:06 2015 UTC,"I would rather like Galaxy to excel as a gaming platform as well as be technically efficient first before we add extra social stuff like voice chat and community hubs.  That being said, a text chat system would be nice. I use TeamSpeak3 as my main VoiP program, so I wouldn't care."

Otherwise the only financially responsible method of accepting such currencies would be to have a system that automatically traded the money you gave them back into USD immediately, which is a significant headache. Whether that implementation is easy for them to arrange and worth it for the extreme minority who refuse to use conventional online payment is their call to make, and so you're fair enough in requesting it, but I'd be surprised if they did.

Those that were calling for this to be released when Valve messed up with paid mods do not really understand how utterly basic this client is right now. I am not sure if I can really call it a client yet.

The Witcher Adventure Game, Double Dragon Trilogy, Alien vs. Predator Classic 2000, and Rise of the Triad (2013) now use GOG Galaxy to deliver their multiplayer functionality.  Today we retire the temporary GOG Launcher app that originally came with your game. You're free to uninstall the app and your game will continue to work without it.

gog,34pldm,orge121,3,Sun May 3 12:02:36 2015 UTC,"mantis.gog.com   First of all check if someone else already reported/requested the feature. If not, just create a bugreport and select ""Feature"" in the ""Severity"" dropdown menu."

gog,34pldm,TypeAskee,2,Sun May 3 13:35:43 2015 UTC,Right now it's only stability testing and there aren't many features. It doesn't recognize all games you already have installed and the gog downloader is still better than the client. You can't get your library in its manually sorted state and there's no friend system yet.   So you're not missing out on much.
gog,34pldm,Superneedles,1 point,Sun May 3 13:07:19 2015 UTC,"if your just looking for a full featured client to make things easier, gives you community integration, achievements, ect. then your better off waiting till the public Beta since it's then most if not all those features should be implemented into the client. Right now all the Alpha is meant for is testing key features of the client such as downloading, auto-updating, ect. and while they are bit by bit adding new stuff to the Alpha builds like the next build/update will have the option to pause downloads and from what I seen in this current build a planned option to turn off auto-updates globally(right now the option is there but it's not fully implemented) for those who don't want said auto-updates and rather not go through their library and set auto updates off game by game, but it's still a Alpha and you will run into what for most will be annoying issues and the like. It shouldn't be that much longer before they go into beta and open it up to the general public/userbase at least based on the progress they been making in the past month or so, as well as what the guys on the team are saying about the current development states of still unimplemented features and when they say more key features are planned to be added to the Alpha, also since it's believed that they plan on trying to be in beta around the time Witcher 3 drops since it will be the first game on GOG to use the clients Achievements.      In short: depending on what your looking for right now, you maybe better off waiting."
gog,34hwss,TypeAskee,5,Fri May 1 08:17:27 2015 UTC,"Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblem were both specific to the handheld consoles that Nintendo released. There are party based RPGs that are similar to this concept, but I don't think anything is quite the same on PC, actually. In my opinion, those are definitely under-represented genres on PC.   That said, there are games like XCOM (not on GOG), Shadowrun Returns (GOG), and the King's Bounty series (GOG). If you're a fan of the Neverwinter Nights series, you could always check out games like Planescape:Torment, the Baldur's Gate series, or the Icewind Dale series.

gog,34hwss,Pomguo,1 point,Mon May 4 17:38:12 2015 UTC,"Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblem were both specific to the handheld consoles that Nintendo released   Just FYI, both series started on home consoles rather than handhelds. FFT as a PS1 game (and is a spiritual sequel to Ogre Tactics on the SNES and PS1 anyway), and Fire Emblem as a long-running console series before it ever jumped ship to portables.  But you're right, there is a significant divide between Japanese console TRPGs and tactical RPGs in the West on PCs. Much as there is between Japanese console RPGs in general and WRPGs like Skyrim, Witcher, and Pillars of Eternity."

gog,34hwss,Pomguo,1 point,Tue May 5 11:39:05 2015 UTC,"The FF13 series, sure (but then it was developed on PC architecture and optimised for consoles later). The others are just rereleases of existing ports that were made the last time Square made a PC push, in the late 90s.   My point was that since FFT missed the boat that time, and they haven't shown any interest in porting older titles that didn't get ports at the time, a PC port of FFT seems unlikely - but maybe a new, multi-platform entry in the series might reach the PC.  Yeah, a lot of the console-style RPGs we see on the PC these days are indies, since indies often take it upon themselves to fill niches publishers don't want to get involved with. So we have generations of people who grew up playing Dragon Warrior and FF4 who have since moved to PC and want something similar fueling the sales of stuff like Cthulhu Saves the World. I suspect a lot of the backers of Massive Chalice wanted something a bit closer to FFT like promised, rather than the quite XCOM-ey game we've ended up with, so that hole in the market's still there!"
gog,34hwss,TypeAskee,2,Tue May 5 13:07:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm really not sure why they haven't filled that hole still. It seems like it's rather gaping. There are other indie games that are close, I suppose... and more and more TBS games are coming out... so maybe we'll get there soon.   I didn't mean to say that the older FF games are made for PC... just that they're finally coming to PC, which I think is a strong indicator that people want more games like this on the PC. It's becoming more and more common to see a PC hooked up to the TV rather than the XBox or PS."

Just that the current porting to PC is mostly just rereleases of a previous PC port push in the late 90s, and only since FF13 has SquareEnix's interest to the PC platform really been proven genuine.

Where you take on five former stunt people who go off to form their own TV studio and help them make a Sentai/Power Rangers series.

The Banner Saga, Massive Chalice, and Fallout: Tactics, I guess come close.   But you're not going to find Fire Emblem on the PC without illegal emulation (Nintendo does not make games for PC, and as Marth's appearance in Smash Bros Melee showed, Fire Emblem is a Nintendo-made series).

gog,34goqo,eharriett,3,Fri May 1 00:16:16 2015 UTC,"the GoG version includes the '94 CD Rom version which I think is the best because the newer CD version uses actual CD music, which may sound nice, but is not at all plot specific.  When a star destroyer shows up... the imperial march must play.  Steam might include that version but I could not tell for sure.  I think Steam only had the original disk version and the windows 95 CD version.  So I bought the GoG version yesterday. Dosbox will recognize a 360 controller and you can use the internal mapper (Control + F1) to add controller events for all the key presses you want.  Out of the box Dosbox only allows for a 4 axis joystick and the 360 controller has 5 so there's some issues with the right analogue stick, but there's a different dosbox build you can get that increases that limit to 8 that I got working with x-wing last night.  I was also afraid that the DRM in steam would make it harder to modify or use a different dosbox build, so I went with GoG for those reasons.  I played around with it a bit last night and I am going to finalize my joystick controls tonight.  Using the left trigger as a modify key I should be able to get every command of any note on the controller, even including  all the communications options to tell other ships to  form on your wing or head home etc.  The only real tricky part is the the Joystick Calibration at the start of game because you have to sort of guess on exactly where Top/Left and Bottom/Right are, but once you're in game you can hit ALT+C to re-calibrate so you can get it right.  I can provide more details on how to get it set up if anyone is actually interested."
gog,34goqo,andamaroo,1 point,Fri May 1 23:50:50 2015 UTC,"I'd like to know your control scheme, I tried to set my X55 up but unfortunately it recognizes the stick as a controller, even though I tried to force the buttons to be keyboard bindings so I could use all of them.  In XWA it doesn't let me use all of the buttons, but XvT does."
gog,34goqo,Silent_Shadow_117,2,Sun May 3 16:07:07 2015 UTC,"I've only set things up in the dosbox versions X-Wing and Tie Fighter. For the newer windows type games you may need to get an external program like JoytoKey.  That being said by the end of this weekend I ended up digging out my Saitek Evo Joystick because no matter how much I tried, the Left Analog stick on the 360 Controller has real trouble as far as the deadzone is concerned and not being able to fly straight without wiggling about was disconcerting.  It was playable, but not great.  For a quick rundown of what I was trying to do for X-Wing:  Left Analog : Main Flight Controls / Default Joystick Left Shoulder / Right Shoulder = Increase/Decrease Speed Right Trigger: Modify Button Left Trigger: Fire Back: Escape to Menu Start: Adjust Shields (Front / Back / Centered)  Start + Modify: Go to Hyperspace Back + Modify: Open / Close S-Foils  Left Stick Button: Power to Shields Right Stick Button: Power to Lasers  Y : Switch between Lasers / Torpedoes Shift + Y: Cycle linked fire.    B: Joystick Button 2  (Used for Spinning) Shift B: Target ship under current reticle  X: Adjust Power Recharge to Shields  Shift + X: Adjust Recharge levels to Lasers  A: Target Nearest Enemy Shift + A: Change Targeting Mode Right Analog Up: Cycle Targets Forward Right Analog Down: Cycle Targets Backward  Communications  on D-Pad  D-Pad Up : Report In D-Pad Left: Cover Me D-Pad Down: Head Home D-Pad Right: Attack my Target  Modify D-Pad D-Pad Up: Go ahead and Engage D-Pad Left: Evasive Maneuvers D-Pad Down: Wait for Orders D-Pad Right: Ignore Target  Left Stick Button + Modify: toggle screen mode between seeing your cockpit and not. Right Stick Button + Modify: toggle external/internal view mode.  Right Shoulder + Modify: Eject And then in Tie Fighter I had Left Shoulder + Modify set to Match Target  Speed.  That covers pretty much everything you would need to have.  I don't have throttle buttons for Max Power. 2/3rd Power, etc.  And I don't have buttons for going to the Briefing / Map / Damage screens because I never really used those, although in tie fighter it was nice to see the mission goals.    In order to get the Hat to Work you have to set joystick=CH in the dosbox config.  Additionally Dosbox recognizes the left stick (Up/Down, Left/Right), the triggers and the right stick UP/Down but not the right stick Left/Right axis) which was upsetting because I wanted to get all of the targeting computer stuff on the right stick.  There's another build of Dosbox that increases the number of axes supported but I found that calibrating the left stick as the joystick in game was a lot harder in that build."
gog,34goqo,andamaroo,1 point,Mon May 4 01:14:13 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks!  it's weird in XWA because XWA only recognizes up to 15 buttons.  Whereas in the older XvT game, it recognizes every single button on the stick, so I can use more.  I wish I could use my throttle, but I'd have to use some weird stuff to get it to recognize both controllers as a single system."

gog,34ewlj,jordguitar,2,Thu Apr 30 17:37:20 2015 UTC,I can't see why it wouldn't be possible. Steam and Origin are both capable of it and they're full of DRM.
gog,34ewlj,Phlum,2,Thu Apr 30 19:36:07 2015 UTC,It is just how it is working right now and if they change it. Their whole point is that you really do not need it to install any games you get from gog.
gog,34ewlj,jordguitar,3,Thu Apr 30 20:07:13 2015 UTC,"Your last point is true, but that really doesn't matter in regards to the original question. Galaxy isn't mandatory, but it's likely Galaxy will support they same stuff other clients support, which is Galaxy's competition.  It's very possible from a development stand point..."
gog,34ewlj,BKGaming_,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:23:25 2015 UTC,You don't even need the client to launch almost all the games. What is the point of putting that into the client if the whole point is optional everything? Just get something like fences or some other desktop management program to store shortcuts in because this will absolutely ruin your start menu with all the entries it makes.
gog,34ewlj,jordguitar,5,Thu Apr 30 21:23:43 2015 UTC,Convenience... the entire point of any client. The same difference if this was steam and we had a non-steam game. I'd add it to steam just so I can launch all my games from the same place.
gog,34ewlj,BKGaming_,6,Thu Apr 30 21:55:31 2015 UTC,"If the point is to make everything optional, surely the inclusion of this feature would be a sensible move."

gog,34ewlj,JigglypuffPC,3,Fri May 1 04:53:36 2015 UTC,"Yes you don't need a client to do that stuff sure, but there are those who like to have things in one easy to go place. Why else would someone buy a EA or Ubisoft game on Steam knowing full well it's going to boot itself up via Origin or Uplay anyway. As for the optional thing, how is being able to add games from elsewhere to the client make it non-optional? it's not like it forces you to do it so it's still optional. Optional just means it's not necessary but if you want it you can."

The CD Rom version of X-wing and Tie Fighter are included with the 1995 and 1998 editions so if you had bought those previously you got the CD Rom versions added to your library at no extra charge.  If not then you have to pick up the X-wing and Tie Fighter packs for 9.99 -you get the 1995, 1998 and CD Rom versions for those not aware.     Star Wars Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast is 9.99 but is on sale for 7.99   Jedi Academy is also 9.99 but is on sale for 7.99  Rebel Assault 1+2 are 9.99   There are two bundle deals going on where you can get X-wing, Tie Fighter, Rouge Squadron 3d, X-wing Vs Tie Fighter, X-Wing Alliance, Galactic Battlegrounds and Rebellion for 38.93 or less if you already own some of the games in the bundle. For example since I already own Rouge Squadron, X-Wing and Tie Fighter I only have to pay 19.99 for the rest.   The other bundle is: Dark Forces, Dark Forces 2: Jedi Knight w/Mysteries of the Sith, Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, KOTOR 2: Sith Lords, Jedi Academy, Empire at War Gold edition, Battlefront 2, Republic Commando and Starfighter. All for 22.44 or less if you already own some of the games in the bundle     edit: put the wrong price for the Saber bundle but it's fixed now"

GOG is great about letting you take advantage of the sales, and plus the whole 30 day money back guarantee can be used in this case.   So yeah, email support and let them know you just want to get the sale price rather than the original, and they should let you."

Linked bundles normally don't contain duplicate content.  In normal cases there is no duplicate content, with games you already own being deducted from a bundle's price and listed in a similar section below (you don't pay again for the same game). In the case of a stacking promo your existing purchases also count towards the discount percentage.  By comparison, Steam bundle prices include the cost of games you already have (Steam duplicates are lost; you don't get gift copies unless otherwise specified)."

What we're looking at is a base game, its deluxe version, and the deluxe upgrade in the same bundle.  Unlike what you said about prorating the bundle, in this case, buying the full bundle has no effect on the original sale price.  The individual prices are the same whether you want to buy the bundle or not... Not that you'd want to since you'd be buying the same game twice, plus a deluxe version upgrade.

gog,33vdiq,slapshit,2,Sun Apr 26 20:10:41 2015 UTC,"They are trust me... I've been a active GOG user for years, and they are now nearly the only place I buy games. The business practices have change quite a bit the last few years in an attempt to attract developers to bring newer games to GOG. This is why the fair world pricing is now the fair price package, and while there pushing Galaxy so hard."

gog,33vdiq,StorkV88,4,Sun Apr 26 12:00:07 2015 UTC,"GOG's main focus atm is Fantasy, RPG, Indi and Classic games. If you look around new games tend to be either RPGs or Indi games ( often both).   But that is not entirely on GOG. But also on the publishers as they must allow GOG to sell those Games. EA and Ubisoft are pretty obvious about the fact that they don't like DRM-Free and that they want to push there platforms too.  Shown in the fact that you have to activate games on Uplay or Origin even if you bought them and intend to use them on Steam.  Another big factor is community size. Steam can get the publishers to publisher on there system even if they don't want because of the amount of people they reach. GOG doesn't yet. But if they would grow a lot of Devs would probably seem themselves forced to find some agreement  with them.   Lastly my opinion. Tripple AAA games are not what keeps the ""core"" gaming crowed around. The ones that care about how shit greenlight is and the mess the made with the mod system. It is a nice community and a good library of quality games. Because let's face it  no one has enough time to play all the good games."

gog,33vdiq,ProtonixChaos,1 point,Fri May 1 01:10:29 2015 UTC,indi is Indie.  tripple aaa is Triple A or AAA.

You find this a lot in there indie games which is becoming pretty big on GOG. It is a battle because new games often have DRM placed on them, but GOG is partnered with nearly every big publisher. I wouldn't expect most AAA games at release on GOG, but GOG getting AAA games that are a few years old will probably become more common after Galaxy releases.  GOG used to stand for ""Good Old Games"" and some people still think it does... but it hasn't been that in long time."

While it has expanded its catalog some I love that I have been able to get such fantastic more recent old releases such as Wizardry 6-8 and Star Wars: Rebellion.  Don't be discouraged that they don't offer all the Call of Duty games or the latest Borderlands.  Be pleasantly surprised by the vast catalog of older yet still fantastic games.  More newer games will come, but for the moment enjoy the good old games that GOG provides."

But, gog is nowhere near replacing steam as a gaming platform (for lack of a better word). Steam is a bit more user friendly, has a ton of ingenious features (the meta of trading items is a game in and of itself), and a much larger representation of games. Whereas Gog provides more access to niche games and retro games.   You don't have to exclusively support either steam or gog, they are both great services and provide a little bit of healthy competition, which is great for us as consumers."

So, I figured if what I want is available through GOG I'd rather support them than Steam. So for the moment I'll be switching houses. I'm not jumping ship entirely but I don't want to support Steam until the current paid mods scandal is addressed."
gog,33sod2,llehsadam,3,Sat Apr 25 16:57:51 2015 UTC,"I think your idea to diversify where you games come from is good. If you stick to one distributor, you become dependent and can't really argue without running the risk of losing everything.  It won't do the gaming community any good if Steam has a monopoly on digital distribution."
gog,33sod2,rw-blackbird,0,Sat Apr 25 20:53:50 2015 UTC,"Especially if Steam's Workshop is where the games' mods develop.  I won't upload or support any mod there where the game isn't Steam-exclusive, because it just fragments the modding community, particularly if the ludicrous idea of paid mods ever becomes a thing.  The Workshop exists primarily to support and enhance Steam's monopoly, as one can't download a mod from Steam's Workshop unless the game is owned on Steam.    At least with GOG you're treated more as if you own the game you bought.  You don't see people's accounts being banned and access to all their games removed on GOG.  On GOG you can return games you don't like or that don't work within a reasonable amount of time, and backing up the games is trivial and doesn't require any account information to restore them.    I guess I don't see the harm using GOG exclusively, as their policies make it so that even in the extremely unlikely event they did go down tomorrow, provided I have backups of the games and/or extras I purchased (a prudent step anyway), I have lost nothing.    I believe GOG is also more developer-friendly in addition to being consumer-friendly.  They're still a business, but their actions don't appear to be motivated by greed -- they don't seem to nickel-and-dime you or focus on short-term profit over making a reasonable amount of money while still respecting those who do business with them."

They could even follow Valve's steps and have non-existent support.  Maybe they'll become big and evil later on, but I've seen no indications of that so far."

Searching the forums indicates that this isn't a new thing for them. I'm not sure how rules as recent as January would directly influence their business decisions.  If I sound insistent it's just because I like to vet my vendors a bit more thoroughly after how many dropouts there were on Greenlight, plus the paid mods controversy on Steam---I trust GOG, but not blindly.  That and more pragmatically I have to buy my GOG games through Paypal with my current bank---Cyprus-based businesses are on my bank's blacklist, although they say restrictions may be lifted in a month or two."

They're not a fly-by-night operation, and their parent company is a respected game developer.   My guess is the reason their accounting's in Cyprus is simply because taxes are more favorable there, and being a relatively small player, they need that advantage to remain competitive while still being customer-friendly."

Garry's mod was a mod that required significant development to turn it into a full stand-alone game, and the previous free version is still available.

For example, there are many nations with similar purchasing power as Russia yet the game is much more expensive.  I guess it begs the question:   Should the same product cost different amounts depending on where you live (when delivery, production, and local costs are the same for that said product regardless of place of purchase)? If so, shouldn't that be applied in a uniform fashion vs, ""here is one particular country where it's cheaper and another where it is not"" (even though people make about the same amount of money)?   Frankly, I do not feel like I ""cheated the system.""  I view it as the system is unfair and arbitrary.  I ordered the same product, from the same company, through the same service, from the same place but paid less as I clicked on a different button on screen.  By the way, I could have simply clicked on a different button (I think in some regions it is actually more expensive than US price) and paid more than the US standard price so it is really a broken/unfair system."

What I don't agree on is the last paragraph. I think you're definition of  ""cheated the system"" is off. I'm not here to tell you what's right and wrong, but make no mistake, you DID cheat the system. Just because you think it's unfair and don't believe in arbitrary pricing doesn't mean you didn't cheat the system. You bought a product at a regional price that was set for a region with a different buying power. It's an imbalance of what the system sees as equality.  Edit: Whether it's definition of equality is wrong or not."

gog,32ha0e,RagingMayo,4,Thu Apr 23 23:43:30 2015 UTC,"I would say sales are pretty similiar to steam in pricing. The big sales are once almost every season, so summer, autumn, winter sale. I guess there is also a little spring sale. GOG is mostly selling classics, but also some newer games on these season sales. There are also other sales and bundles now and then, i.e. for a specific franchise or game company. IIRC it can reach up to 80% price reduction. I think you will be rewarded, if you wait for sales."

gog,32ha0e,rabid-albino,3,Sun Apr 26 04:39:18 2015 UTC,"Hey just got linked here by all the steam madness, and I'd like to ask some questions about gog before stepping in. 1.What cut do developers get (source would be nice) 2.What games do you recommend, as cheap starting titles 3.Steam and origin have fairly decent multiplayer support, does gog have anything to support this side of their community, or would you recommend using forums and linking up with friends in other ways  4.(connected to 3) what types of games do you primarily use gog for? Single-player? Multi-player? AAA? indie?  I know I probably could find this through Google, but you all appeared as a more efficient method"
gog,32ha0e,RagingMayo,3,Fri Apr 24 22:28:50 2015 UTC,"These are all great questions, but unfortunately I can't answer all of them. I mostly use gog for old single player games that are difficult to track down and get working otherwise. Some titles I can personally recommend are Wing Commander, I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream, and Dungeon Keeper: Gold. As far as multiplayer support goes, there is no front-end software available like Steam or Origin. The gog forums may be a good way to organize games, but I have no personal experience doing that.  I recommend you go ahead and repost this to the main page of the subreddit as a text post and flair it as ""question."" I think you'll definitely get more responses that way."
gog,32ha0e,rabid-albino,2,Sat Apr 25 06:37:31 2015 UTC,"I want to agree that all of your questions could have been answered via google. Anyway, now I have already started writing.   I can't answer that. You might want to contact gog customer support to get information about that. This depends very much on what genres you like. Most of my gog collection consists of adventure-point&click games and RPGs. There are lists on gog called ""GoG Mix"", you could call them playlists. These lists are created by gog users and others can vote for them. Here is one for example: http://www.gog.com/mix/must_play_classic_crpgs. Or this one: http://www.gog.com/mix/totalbiscuits_definitive_list_of_strategy_games. Those lists with the most votes are often somewhat definitive lists of classics. As for now multiplayer is not supported by gog. If there is a multiplayer option in a game, you probably have to use programs like Hamachi or Tunngle to create virtual LAN connections between you and others or use private servers. However gog has planned to release ""GoG Galaxy"" soon which will be a client to connect with other gog players. It will be there to create multiplayer environments, reward you with trophies and have some form of social networking (friend lists), all similar to steam. BUT this service will be completely optional, so you can still play your games fully offline and they are at all stages DRM-free. It's still in the beta phase. GoG is primairly a platform for old games and indie titles, as the name proclaims - Good old Games. Though in the recent past gog has added some games which could be rated AAA, as for example newer The Prince of Persia titles (so the Sands of Time series and the newest Prince of Persia for PC) or Divinity - Original Sin. The Witcher 3 will be soon released as well, though this is also due to the fact the developers CD Project are also the creaters of GoG (hence the load of digital preorder goodies, if you preorder it on gog). There are also loads of (newer) quality indie games on gog.    So GoG is dedicated to provide the player base with old and indie games. This is their primairy marketing concept so far. But they are also stepping forward to introduce some bigger titles to their collection. They won't have the newest AAA games there. You won't see Batman Arkham Knight or Star Wars Battlefront 3 anytime soon. So you are mainly on gog for the old classics and indies. In conclusion to my third answer I would assume that gog users are mostly offline single-players. As I have mentioned earlier, gog users are often in favor of DRM-free games, too, which is what gog is selling 99,99% of the time. I think Divinity - Original Sin could be an exception."

Decided to switch over to GoG after steam decided to shoot itself in the foot recently.   Figured I would buy games if GoG has a version of them at all possible (Like Witcher 3, was going to get the steam version but now its going to be the GoG version if I feel my PC can run it). If not, I have PS4. I do feel like this would be a great time for Galaxy to start showing off its features :D!  Was playing Wicher 1 and 2 again on steam, but switched over to the GoG version, luckily all the saves are universal and work just as well.   Link to the games if no one knows what witcher is :p.

gog,32d06z,adferte,9,Sun Apr 12 19:31:39 2015 UTC,"Dude, just have the game on gog, and hit ""add nonsteam game"" in steam, when you have it installed. That way you can have the overlay to chat with friends, and you get to own the game through gog which is way better than having it through steam."
gog,32d06z,finalremix,5,Sun Apr 12 20:30:17 2015 UTC,"You can't, no- they're different services entirely. This might be slightly less convenient for you, but it's not entirely a bad thing:  Since GOG is DRM-free, you can download the installer then back it up to external drives and such, with no restrictions and no need to register anything online or provide any codes. Decades from now, when Steam's and Origin's servers are long dead- your copy of Witcher 3 will still install and work :)  After installing the game, you can still add the game to your local Steam library with the ""add non-Steam game"" button. It won't update or sync your saves, but it will still enable the overlay, friend chat, screenshots, etc."

gog,31sshb,killum101,2,Tue Apr 7 21:54:09 2015 UTC,The Witcher 3 is having paid DLC. Good or Bad?
gog,31sshb,Miltrivd,11,Tue Apr 7 21:55:17 2015 UTC,"Wait and see. Proper expansions should be welcomed with open arms. I do have mixed feelings about announcing expansions before the game is even released and the whole pre-order/season pass business.  I'm wary about the PC version performance as well, canceled my pre-order but I'll be paying attention to reviews/opinions."
gog,31sshb,deepsquirrel,4,Tue Apr 7 22:29:51 2015 UTC,"They're not actually releasing until way later, and the announcement pretty much says PLEASE WAIT AND MAKE SURE OUR GAME DOESN'T SUCK, JUST IN CASE. I think they've done a pretty good job in terms of announcement time etc.   I'll definitely wait a few days to make sure PC performance reports have time to start flooding the web before I drop the cash though, ya never know."
gog,31sshb,LaronX,0,Tue Apr 7 22:40:01 2015 UTC,Yes this might be true. But selling it now is a shady business non the less. They are trying to sell it off the pre launch hype just in case the game doesn't do well.
gog,31sshb,nikolapc,5,Wed Apr 8 07:20:01 2015 UTC,"Shady, as in they compel you to buy?   I don't know of a business that wouldn't welcome some extra cash on hand, if only for job security.  Shady is when someone takes your money but does not plan on delivering.  Shady is companies firing everyone on the dev team once the project is done regardless of how much money it makes."
gog,31sshb,LaronX,-1,Wed Apr 8 09:29:44 2015 UTC,"While I agree those things are shady, I would also consider this a shady or at least not beneficial deal for consumers as they try to lure them in for extra money.  It is shady in my eyes because effectively you are buying a promise that they will make some kind of add-on based on a game that is not out yet( hence you have no idea what it will be like). Probably with out even knowing what the content of the expansion should be.   Let's make some points.  Let's assume the Witcher 3 will be a grandiose game and the free DLC will fill most of the "" this should be in the base game needs"" like for many other games. What should an expansion be? Well traditionally it has been two things. Either it is more of the same ( in from of a story, areas and skills) or it is an improvement, enhancement and addition to core game concepts and mechanics. The first we still get a lot just under the name of Story DLC. The later makes no sense if they haven't published the game yet. So in the end they are selling a story DLC/ story pack and call it expansion in the hope to cash in on the word expansion and it's implications. There are worse ways of business, but this certainly isn't the best way about it either."
gog,31sshb,nikolapc,3,Wed Apr 8 11:32:06 2015 UTC,"So this:   But we can't stress Marcin Iwinski's words enough: “Don’t buy it if you have any doubts. Wait for reviews or play The Witcher and see if you like it first. As always, it’s your call.""   has no meaning for you then?  This early access or pre-order thing is for fans of GoG and CDProjektRED that want to support them in making the game.  Why is it different from Early Access or Kickstarter? People are not stupid and know the risks involved, but still go into those things. On their own volition.  I am not paying before it comes out(I've supported them enough by pre-ordering Witcher 3 even when they announced the delay), but that is my decision, and those who payed for it, that is theirs too."
gog,31sshb,LaronX,0,Wed Apr 8 11:57:48 2015 UTC,"No meaning in the sense of content delivered.    Hearts of Stone will take Geralt on an all-new 10-hour adventure into the wilds of No Man’s Land and the nooks and alleys of Oxenfurt   Can be everything form just reuse of areas an textures  to actually no content and areas or even a mix of both. This is like the specification for Watch Dogs or AC:U back in the day. Oh and it will be a fun challenging experience that is engaging bla bla bla. There is no info what you actually getting for your money aside from a possibly  10h long story arc.   Kickstarter ( and to a lesser degree Early access as that is a failed project by steam) is in so far different that you give them money to make the game at happen all. Instead of giving money to something that will happen.   Think of it this way. Bayonetta 2 was only made because Nintendo decided to give Platinum Games the money needed to make it. In a sense you could say they backed or kickstarted them. With out that financial support the game simply wouldn't exist. Both sides made that pretty clear.   That is not the case with pre oderes. EVER. You are buying something you don't know shit about aside form carefully selected PR footage. They will make game regardless. The sales are not good and will be beaten in less time then you imagine ( e.g 2 Months for shadow of mordor).  Did you ever hear of a game getting canceled because it didn't get pre ordered enough? Of course not because that thing is gone be made either way. Pre orders in this day and age , excluding limited edition stuff  which is well limited, have small to no benefits ( at best what a sale that is worse in 2 months and bonuses that are worthless maybe a pre load). In most cases there main purpose is to make you buy the game based on hype rather then facts. Which is never is good for the consumer.  Sure you are free to do so.  But you need to be aware. If you increase the incentive to sell pre orders ( as they are ""easy"" money) more dev time will get into stuff that ends up as pre order DLC. Making the industry worse for all of us."
gog,31sshb,nikolapc,1 point,Wed Apr 8 12:26:52 2015 UTC,"I am against pre-order DLC.   But I still sometimes pre-order when I am hyped/want to pre-load (my turtle internet man), so pre-orders are not gonna disappear. The main thing that should be fixed and it is being fixed is that you can cancel them anytime and get your money back. This should be extended to 30 days when you get the game, which is what now GoG and Origin do!  I canceled Unity twice, once because it became cheaper, and the second time because I had the fortune of 2 day delay for Europe and the reviews and more importantly the way it runs were out. Bought Far Cry 4 with the credit I had (""hey at least they wouldn't fuck that up"", they did a bit at launch).  Still, I wanted to play it so much, someone said on forums it works on GTX 650, so I went in and got it again, pumping even more money toward Ubisoft, this time fully aware that I may be fucked, but was glad to play it even on 720p 25fps.  It ran 3fps. That was my calculated risk I have taken with my money. They vindicated themselves a bit with a free game for season pass holders (that was a rush to get after the announcement), but they still fucked a lot of people.  Cut to six months later, 5 patches and a new machine with a GTX 970, that game is beautiful, if you can run it.  My point being, while clearly it may have been the wrong choice, it was my own that I thought out, even in my overhyped brain, and it surely was not made for any pre-order ""loot"".   The dudes from Poland won't pull that shit. They are putting out their games fully DRM free, which are up on torrents the minute they come out. There is no difference between that version and the one you pay for. They need to earn their money with quality.  So if they have full faith that the community will support them with buying their game if it is good and not pirate it, what is wrong with someone having faith in them and supporting them early?"
gog,31sshb,LaronX,1 point,Wed Apr 8 13:15:00 2015 UTC,"I am not trying to make CDProject red down. But the concept is bad and shouldn't be supported. Like any kind of abusive business it won't disappear. But if it is not the MAIN focus of AAA games. Let's face it for both Unity and Watch Dogs Ubisofts whole plan was hype and pre sell it and then work form there. Your ""free"" loot btw came with the lose of ALL right to sue them over the product so in case they wouldn't have been able to fix it and fucked everyone over for good. But they got there asses out.  Besides those game they offered come with so much for free and went on such low discounts it was a lot less value then people pretended. You did't get a $60 Game in Far Cry 4. It was way Cheaper then that a lot of times and comes free with some Nvidia Cards.   Again. I am not saying CD Project is the all mighty evil. But that even they do this kind of stuff just speaks how used people got to pay for stuff they don't know and open themselves up to get fucked over. Encouraging this kind of business. That is what a big chunk of games in early access abuse just as much AAA publishers like EA. CD Project will probably deliver on a good work. The business practice should still be avoided as it makes the market worse for us all to little gain. Really if a Dev/publisher is confident in there Product they do what EA and Bioware did with DA:I where the reviews where out a week before the game and at that point you can safely pre order. but if they hid the reviews for longer then a day before it comes out there is a big reason to be suspicious .  As for the refund policy that is all on steam. They are forced by Eu law to refund and still try to dick there way out of it. EA get's a lot of shit but steams care for costumers is even worse. If they would be a store to open now people wouldn't care about them as it is a restrictive with a very anti consumer set of rules. The only reason they get away  with it is the circlejerk people make over the sales that are not even good/ unmatched anymore.  GoG regularly beats them in price and content of what you get. But people like to circle jerk on gabes face it seems."

gog,30u46k,Shujinco2,2,Mon Mar 30 18:55:53 2015 UTC,"Hello! I'm Shujinco2; semi-long time user of GoG. Somewhat new user of Reddit. My favorite game in the world is Earthbound, and my favorite game company is HAL Labs.  As for what I've been playing recently:   Bravely Default: A nice comeback for the retro Final Fantasy games, this game feels very close to Final Fantasy 5, but is vastly improved in every way. I like how it's easy to tell what you need to do next, which was my bigest issue with Final Fantasy 5. I also really love the added Support Abilities system they added, making customization such a fun thing. Hyrule Warriors: A nice Dynasty Warriors type game for the Zelda fan. I love it's use of many Zelda characters/items/maps from different Zelda games, but I dislike how they only come from Ocarina of Time/Skyward Sword/Twilight Princess/Majora's Mask. I feel like the Oracle games, or ALTTP, could have provided some excellent pieces of the game. Give Darunia the Magnet Gloves. Give Cia the Cane of Somoria. Give Zelda the Wind Baton. Neverwinter Nights: A nice take on D&D combat in the video game realm, with lots and lots to do and an online component. I've been playing the Kingmaker module because everyone said it was easier to get into than the main story. They were pretty right. I'm just on the last part now where I go fight the main bad guy. I brought along Trip, a Wererat Thief, Kaidala, a Druid Nymph, and my badger Bathory. Lots of fun. Punch Out featuring Mr. Dream: A weird boxing game for the NES, that's not really a sport game, but more of a puzzle game in it's mechanics. I got this one on a random whim on Club Nintendo, and oh my god, was that ever a good choice. The game is excellent in every regard (Except, unfortunately, the music), and is such a well made gem. All the characters have much personality, and all the animations are damn fluid. Everything looks good as well. Citizens of Earth: A quirky RPG by Atlus. Very much inspired by Earthbound. A game where you play as Vice President of the World, and recruit your fellow man to fight for you. I tried really hard to like this game, and did up until the second chapter. The game opens up in the second chapter, but not just by a bit. It opens up WAY more than it should have, and is incredibly daunting. There's also so many damn party members it's hard to keep track of all the quests. I also though the music was incredibly bland, and really uninteresting. Might not pick it up again."

gog,30lzs2,finalremix,2,Sat Mar 28 16:29:36 2015 UTC,"I did a review of two worlds on this post - http://redd.it/2savj7  Here it is:   LINK TO STORE  Some details regarding my review   I am just over 18 hours into the game I have NOT finished the game I have done a handful of quests (I spent 98% of the time roaming around the world) I am level 29   I'll just say it right away   I have zero emotional investment in the story and couldn't tell you what my purpose in the game is. Two minutes after installing I decided to go exploring and I never looked back. So from now I will be looking at this as a sandbox RPG.   Pros   The world is quite large, you can go walking through forests the entire time and not encounter a single road Health, mana and teleporter shrines are everywhere in the world Loot selling is incredible easy-you are given portable teleports near the beginning of the game! You can combine like items so they will increase in stats Go ahead a murder everyone! A guard doesn't want you to enter an area yet? MURDER HIM. A home inhabitant is preventing you from looting his place? Close the door AND MURDER HIM. It is actually very satisfying :) Wide-screen support!   Cons   Riding a horse is a VERY stiff experience and you will become very frustrated with it's difficulty navigating the terrain Organizing your inventory is a very frustrating experience. You have to manually move the items and it is not very good at detecting open slots It does not feel very alive and you can tell everything has been specifically placed in spots The dialogue is bland and the voice acting is...amusing There is not a huge variety of enemy NPC's Crafting potions is annoying. You can make permanent stat increases but if you change one ingredient then it becomes a basic elemental augment for your weapon-thereby wasting your high-level ingredients.  I couldn't navigate the character creation screen so I could have the option to choose other classes           End review:  Don't play it for the story. Play it for the cheap price and decent RPG experience."

gog,3060re,MoebiusTripp,3,Tue Mar 24 19:39:14 2015 UTC,We were talking about this and my answer is yes there is a time to for them to be classics. I would say some time between 10 and 15 years. The reason there is no specific time is it depends on when the mindset decides it is either just an old game or a classic.   New (0 to 1 year) Current (1-3 years)  Dedicated (4-10 years)  Old / Classic (10-15 years)
gog,3060re,MoebiusTripp,2,Wed Mar 25 03:47:37 2015 UTC,"I have a different approach than many folks, since I have a laptop dedicated to games older than 2002. My WayBack Machine has all the old classics that run on DOS and pre-NT based Windows and other platforms like Scumm, plus all the text based games that run on text parsers like Z. This allows me to play many old games others find over the hill.  That said, I find that most games before about 1985 have graphics too crude to play. I would then call the classic period from 1985 to 2000.  The modern period ran from 2001 to 2010 with a general simplification of game play and a decline of C&C as a game factor.  The current generation is 2011 to the present. I am a patient gamer and rarely buy until the release of a GOTY. There is a serious decline of AAA titles in this group of my collection because I have found a precipitous drop off in game quality. I can't stop laughing at the dating sim with dragons that is DA: Inquisition long enough to think of buying it.   The main point in response to your direct question, remakes are boring if you have played the original. I bought the Avernum series not realizing the first 3 games were remakes of the older Exile series. Now Spiderweb has released another remake with no change but graphics and game play refinements. How long can you turn out retreads? And since Grim Fandango runs just fine on Scumm, I won't be lining double-fine Tim's profligate pockets on that remake either.    Take this for what you will. I am an Old Fart Gamertm who walked out of Ironman II after 20 minutes because it bored me."

Feel the hankering to play something older, but not something that I don't understand or follow well, which apparently is most old games. So, in the meantime, until a game catches my attention, I've been playing Guild Wars 1 again, starting fresh and that has been really great.   Of course, Pillars of Eternity is coming out this week, and I'm kind of hoping that it's going to be just an easier to understand version of Baldur's Gate, a crpg that I don't need to look up a walkthrough to get playing through.   I never can get into older games because I just don't seem to follow them. Not gaming as a kid, I'm not used to this more hardcore style... so I tend to just wander around the starting zone lost for a while before giving up and uninstalling. That's where I am with Neverwinter Nights 1 right now, actually... just wandering around the training area, trying to find a guy that I can't seem to find and don't know where he should be.

They are sure are awesome as hell though ;)  Also you during pretty much any big GoG sale ( the ones where stuff is on the front page for a limited amount of time/number) you can get a critical hit and have pretty much any game for free. I think I got 3 games like that so far. Was pretty sweet as I have a very limited budget it meant I could buy something else too.   Ehm.. what where we talking about again. Oh yes! GoG is awesome :D

I do think that the Wednesday thread will need some ground rules, though, so it doesn't just become a weekly dumping ground (like Update Monday at /r/letsplay). Something similar to the existing posting rules. No channel links, a brief description, and it must reasonably be considered a relevant game to this subreddit. It doesn't have to be on gog.com of course, because that is the whole point of the thread. However, I think it should still be limited to older titles. With ""older"" being subjective."

gog,2y5z54,llehsadam,3,Sat Mar 7 14:15:23 2015 UTC,It has to be. The game had a newer engine so it is actually one of the most detailed isometric 2D games out there. It came out at the time isometric strategy games reached peak levels of detail and then the industry decided to switch to 3D graphics.  So what I'm saying is that Emperor plays like a modern isometric game in widescreen.

gog,2x9a2w,Sweet_Moon_Sugar,2,Fri Feb 27 05:27:16 2015 UTC,It was only very short. You pretty much just moved through a series of levels with your badger babes. Each level had its own enviroment and challenges. It wasn't very fast paced but I first played it on a very lazy Sunday and it was just perfect for the day. It's got some really nice music too.

gog,2x4hfh,RetroTrigger,2,Wed Feb 25 16:22:42 2015 UTC,"Short answer: dedicated to news from the GoG website, gameplay help, technical support, advice about purchases, (newly) showcasing other subreddits that are dedicated to games on the GoG catalog and meta topics (Talk Shop now).  Long story: Well in the beginning it was just a random subreddit that was about the site and was essentially dead (/u/disso was too busy being a super secret agent or something). I somehow found the subreddit and I asked to take over and he graciously did so. I started posting website deals, I linked the subreddit all over Reddit (especially when /r/gamedeals posted a sale) and had an influx of people. A really great moderator I brought on was /u/matthew94 as he did an amazing job with the wiki, the CSS and sharing news from the site. More people came in, I was really excited and we kept on trying crazy things such as:   we got drunk once and made the entire subreddit communism themed Subreddit-showcases. I would contact the mods of subreddits that had communities dedicated to games that were on the GOG catalog and we would ask questions and stuff   Recent /r/Stalker one Baldur's Gate Veteran one /r/FTLgame one that was amazing The original /r/baldursgate one  I thought about gift-giving/wishlist-granting once-a-month threads but that ended up going nowhere   Moving on I FINALLY DID THE USER FLAIRS. That has been a 9 month process (thanks /r/csshelp sidebar!) and now here we are...getting content creators and once again I am trying to break this shit...only I am not drunk this time and giggling about Chairman Meow"
gog,2x4hxp,Pyroraptor,2,Wed Feb 25 16:26:41 2015 UTC,"Dude you are on fire!! This videos are tons of fun to watch! Couple questions:   When you were talking about graphics you mentioned that ""remember it is a Unity game"" what did you mean by that? The voice you used was really amusing It is pronouced ""dah-moh-cleez"" :P The combat reminds me of the new batman series, prince of persia and other ""combo-strike"" games   edit: Enjoy my comments on the video :P"
gog,2x4hxp,hohnsenhoff,2,Wed Feb 25 18:19:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! I'm super glad that you liked them :D   Unity is a game engine that is fairly easy to use.  It allows developers to make games easily, but does not have a lot of the advanced graphics options that you can find in other game engines (for example CryEngine). I'm not a game dev, so I have to take what my dev friends say face value.  Most Unity games are not as pleasant to look at, so it is quite a feat when you get such a beautiful looking game out of Unity. Thanks so much :D I'll try to do a bit more voice acting in later videos. I had fun with it ^ Dangit >.< Well I hope my lack of proper pronunciation is at least comical xD I was hoping to get more combat footage, but only hit one combat encounter card.  The combat looks and feels a LOT like the Batman Arkham games, Assassins Creed, and Shadow of Mordor.  I think they did a fairly decent job on it, although I know some people don't feel that way. IMO that type of combat is a harder system to try and implement. Therefore I give more credit for a smaller indie studio that doesn't have the resources that the AAA studios have.     Thanks so much for the feedback and comment :D It helps me out a large deal when looking at aspects to improve.  ::SeaOttergamer"

gog,2x3b1z,welsknight,2,Wed Feb 25 07:50:18 2015 UTC,"ABOUT THE ESCAPISTS: The Escapists is a game developed by indie developer Mouldy Toof Studios. It provides the opportunity of experiencing a light-hearted insight into everyday prison life and, as is the case with all inmates, the main objective is escape! While under the careful watch of the guards, players will need to go about their daily duties clandestinely secreting useful objects from under their captors’ noses. Potential escapees will learn how to craft seemingly innocuous items into useful tools and even weapons as well as using them to execute cunning diversionary tactics.  Players will need to learn when to keep in line, utilising their time sensibly as they develop their own personal plans of escape. Learning the prison’s daily routines and spotting opportunities are all part of life behind bars. Working out potential routes and even misdirecting guards soon become second nature.  Whilst remembering to attend roll-call, holding down their job and keeping their fellow inmates on side, players are can also benefit from advancing their character's statistics through various means including boosting their intellect and exercising regularly. Balance mundane routine with careful planning to attain your ultimate goal - escape and freedom!  Get it on GOG: http://www.gog.com/game/the_escapists  Moudly Toof Studios' Twitter: https://twitter.com/mouldytoof  EDIT: Sorry, I missed the memo regarding the rule change about text vs. link posts for video submissions. If needed I can delete and resubmit as a text post, but otherwise I'll make sure to do future videos as a text post. Wish there was a way to show the thumbnails on self posts, though. =("
gog,2x3b1z,hohnsenhoff,1 point,Wed Feb 25 07:52:38 2015 UTC,I approve this post ^_^ (I really like how much detail you put into this comment). I am surprised by how the resurgence of pixel games has occured
gog,2x3b1z,hohnsenhoff,2,Thu Feb 26 03:06:17 2015 UTC,"Me too, I think there's something eternally endearing about old-school graphics and pixel games (at least for those of us that remember them from the ""good ole' days"").  Also, if I might make a suggestion: Rather than positing everything in a text post, would it be possible to still post a link, as long as a comment is left (with ""Info In Comments"" in the title) much like this one? Most content creators like myself put a lot of time into their thumbnail images, and the only way for them to be seen here is to actually link the video/playlist in question."
gog,2x3b1z,hohnsenhoff,1 point,Thu Feb 26 18:52:57 2015 UTC,Huh...that's a good point. The issue we had was links being dropped and forgotten on the subreddit. So we had the text posts as it forced the users to actually detail their posts as well as sharing their content. The way you mention it might work...let me talk it over with the other mods
gog,2x3a0h,LaronX,4,Wed Feb 25 07:35:06 2015 UTC,For gods sake. Can we make a tread for all let's pays of have a filter. It is annoying to navigate the sub with this many of them.
gog,2x3a0h,DecadenceNight,1 point,Thu Feb 26 15:09:01 2015 UTC,We have a couple things we are working on before we get to that:   I am adding more user flairs and realizing a mistake of mine I am going to be having to redo every single CSS line regarding them (Just short of a thousand lines in total and it is not automated) Getting the new moderators up to speed on the subreddit Getting the post guidelines all figured out Adding the extra post flairs Fixing the flair sort option so they are usable Working on setting up the autobot so we could have a daily thread   So in the mean time-as I said in this very post-we are just going to do it this way so we can best understand how this will all function. It is going to be not very clean (annoying as you say) for a little bit but within a week that will be changed.
gog,2x3a0h,Pyroraptor,2,Thu Feb 26 15:39:23 2015 UTC,"I think that the first week or so of this should be grace period while the specific details of the rules are ironed out. After some point though, should we start reporting posts that don't follow the guidelines?"
gog,2x3a0h,Pyroraptor,1 point,Wed Feb 25 15:56:30 2015 UTC,The idea was more that I was going to lay down some guidelines and see how they work for everyone. After a set amount of time I have a quick chat with you all and we make changes then. Although if the posts are done terribly then of course report them :-)
gog,2x3a0h,Pyroraptor,2,Wed Feb 25 16:33:14 2015 UTC,"Came here from /r/LetsPlay. I wanted to thank you for letting us post videos on your SubReddit.  It is increasingly difficult to find mediums to post YouTube content due to the large influx of new content creators.  You probably noticed that due to the large amount of videos posted in the past 2 days. When a new area to market opens up, people flood to it. However, I expect that the video posts will die down over the next few weeks.  I am also excited to help out GOG.  They have always had very pro-consumer policies, which I admire.  They offer DRM-free copies of games, a money back guarantee for downloadable content (which is insane), and are now encouraging customers to research the games before they buy them. By allowing content creators to post gaming content they are giving customers an easier way to determine whether or not a game is worth purchasing.  This also helps protect the consumer in cases where a game is buggy, doesn't work, or is just plain bad (coughAssassinsCreedUnitycough).   Of course, as a YouTube content creator my views might be biased, so please do take that into account.  That being said, I look forward to your new program on /r/GOG, and please let me know if you need help with anything.  We have a pretty good community at /r/letsplay full of people who help each other out, make meaningful posts (most of the time), and we don't have many trolls.  I hope that is reflected in the type of posts you will get here as well.  Thanks again,  ::SeaOtterGamer"
gog,2x3a0h,Pyroraptor,2,Wed Feb 25 16:35:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for commenting! I am honestly think I am going to be surprised with the longevity of everything as the LARGE catalog of GOG and the potential for collaborations will make it something better. Now With other people desperately trying to get noticed I think with a better mod team we can weed out those who are just trying to cash in and don't care about the content (you can tell by the quality of their posts and if they just link spam)  edit: I have explained elsewhere that the reason I do this is -- ""[...]There are so many people who love these old games but the community is scattered and have this idea that not many people will watch their content. I am looking to change that with your and everyone else's help. I think we have something here"""
gog,2x3a0h,Pyroraptor,2,Wed Feb 25 16:46:13 2015 UTC,"Exactly, and I hope that link spam doesn't happen.  We don't see it very often at all on /r/letsplay. When it does happen it gets shut down pretty quick (by the redditors usually, not necessarily the mods).  However, I think you are going at it with the right attitude.  I'm sure that adjustments will need to be made, and a few mods will need to be promoted, but it looks like you already took that into account."
gog,2x3a0h,llehsadam,2,Wed Feb 25 16:49:14 2015 UTC,"Just a quick thought. Could we get a ""Youtube"" and ""Twitch"" flair for this subReddit? That way people could more easily distinguish content creators.  Just a suggestion :D"
gog,2x3a0h,SmallSubBot,2,Wed Feb 25 16:37:01 2015 UTC,So would you like that as a user flair or a post flair? Also we will see when I get to it as I have to add flairs to my other subreddit /r/motiontrackedboobs
gog,2x3a0h,ThatRatGuyOnReddit,2,Wed Feb 25 16:43:02 2015 UTC,"I would say a User flair, but that is up to you.  I'd check out your other subReddit but... at work xD"

gog,2x1raa,DecadenceNight,1 point,Tue Feb 24 23:28:36 2015 UTC,"Well, if anyone here loves Fallout they could enjoy seeing Arcanum: Of Steamworks & Magicka Obscura. Very similar but set in a fantasy steampunk victorian-era world.  I own an old physical copy (no idea where it is atm) but I would one day like to own it through gog when I'm able to.  Otherwise, how about making special threads everyday, with different game genres or themes for lets plays to reduce potential spam. Just an idea to discuss, it will be nice to see LPs of classic games but I don't think it will be good if the sub begins drowning in posts of them. Not discouraging people to make the posts, just post in moderation perhaps?"

(I blame my shit country for being slow with the times)    So when I eventually played Fallout I noticed the gameplay similarities. Same kind of camera view, turned based combat with action points, quests quests and more quests and many locations to visits and things to find. The stuffed two headed cow in Arcanum even made sense to me after that."

gog,2x1raa,KhaineGB,-2,Thu Feb 26 00:01:12 2015 UTC,None.  If I wanted to watch someone else play video games while I sat there bored I would travel back in time and watch my older brothers do it.
gog,2x1raa,CinnamonJ,2,Wed Feb 25 01:23:25 2015 UTC,You don't get the point of a Let's Play then.  Let's Play's are supposed to be someone playing the game while providing interesting commentary or while talking about stuff happening in the game. Just watching someone playing a game silently would be more like a walkthrough.

For those who don't know, you play survivors in a war zone, and this game can deal with some rather sensitive subjects due to this. I advise caution if you choose to watch this LP series.  So let's see how long I manage to survive before I stuff it up in some kind of spectacular fashion. The series updates every Thursday at 7pm GMT. :)"
gog,2x00dr,KhaineGB,2,Tue Feb 24 17:13:54 2015 UTC,"And my final GOG-related series is the classic RPG, Fallout 1!  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOrBliTYfAnDEjcyW8hkBJIV0unBIvZgr  Unfortunately, this game is no longer available on GOG, which I believe is due to licensing issues. I hope that gets resolved in the future, since it's a great game and I much prefer buying older games from GOG rather than steam.  For those who don't know, Fallout 1 is probably THE classing post-apocalyptic, turn-based RPG. It's the spiritual successor to Wasteland (though Wasteland 2 is now out!) and you play as someone who spent all of their life in a vault, a massive underground structure designed to protect people from the horrors of nuclear war.  Of course, something goes wrong. It has to go wrong for you to be sent out into the post-apocalyptic world and thus have an actual adventure. Anyway, I'm playing this with the FixIt patch, as it restores some content and applies the high resolution patch which I feel makes the game a bit easier on the eyes on modern systems.   This series updates every Friday at 7pm GMT. :)"

Theres nothing worse then having to traipse the internot to find out how to get past a part of the game & seeing its something no one could ever of imagined, unless living in the same padded cell that the creater resided within ;)  Its like Unmechanical. There was a part to solve a pattern puzzle in some circle. Took gawd knows how many attempts (with an on screen hint/help) to do it & even when I got it done, Id still no idea wtf I`d done right lol.

Start off with Shadow of Chernobyl and play it the first time through with only some graphical enhancement and bugfix mods.  There is a useful repository of mods in the sidebar at /r/stalker and there you can find a Starter Pack which is a small compilation of these type of mods. These mods do not change gameplay at all, except for fixing bugs and polishing the graphics.  Someone earlier asked me how S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is compared to Metro 2033 and Fallout, here is an explanation.  STALKER is right between both games. STALKER is not as open as Fallout, but it is not linear like Metro. If you look at the map of the Zone in STALKER, you will see that it is much taller than wide and you pretty much make your way up north to the center of  the Zone. However, you can occasionally branch off to other areas on the sides and are free to explore a level for as long as you want. Think of it like a tree.  Call of Pripyat is different, SoC and CS have a lot of smaller areas with loading screens in between, Call of Pripyat has three more massive areas and is much more open."

gog,2wlhqo,ARGUMENTUM_EX_CULO,3,Sat Feb 21 17:21:49 2015 UTC,"Who ever decides to read this for what ever reason, this will be a huge post so for your trouble of scrolling down, you get a picture from my first play playthrough:  8 years ago, I was 14. I was a CoDjunky (that was my youtube profile name for a long time), I played CoD2 and CoD4 to the ungodly amount of time. CoD4 is the only game out side of League of Legends that I've played more then 1000 hours . But while League, I've been playing for the past 4 years and CoD4 I collected the much hours in about year and a half. Some people had WoW, I had CoD4. During that period, other games pretty much didn't exist . I thought that Bioshock being ""crowned"" PC game of the year for 2007 from most of the sites and magazines was ""the biggest insult to the video game community ever"". Thats how much I was cut of from the ""real world"" of video games. Nothing else could be better then CoD4, it was the greatest game of all time.   Fast forward 1 year, its 2008. after playing nothing else then CoD2 and CoD4 and bit of Dota in a local PC playground with friends and finally I got board of it. Mostly because I was playing alone, my friends were playing WoW or Dota. I couldn't find a decent community to play with. SO what was I gonna play now? Well a Serbian PC magazine was talking about S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Clear sky and how it sucks, because it had so much bugs and glitches that, unlike the last game, which was also buggy but at least the story, settings and everything in it was great and fresh, and this was just a copy of it, but with even more bugs and gave it a score of 60/100.   Of course being an idiot and score being important to me at the time I said I am not playing this shit, but I will how ever try the first game. And tried the game I did. I fell in love with the game in a heart bit. AND unlike most people I didn't have any bugs for what ever reason, the game worked perfectly. I still to this day haven't played STALKER complete mod because that game still works with out a problem for me.   I was amazed at what the game was. The setting for me was great, because my favorite level from CoD4 was the sniper mission in Pripyat. I also live in country that was once a socialist country and the architecture of houses build in that time is very similar to the one in game. So I felt like I was in ""my backyard"". AI of the enemies and creatures was just mind blowing for me. A enemy is trying to flank me?! They are running away from grenade?! Dogs are attacking mutated pigs in packs and are running away from you if they feel they are in a bad spot?! Military decided to clear the camp of bandits on its own?! Its was all mind blowing to me. Everything in that game felt so good and great. I loved game so much that now its my favorite game of all time. I still love CoD4 but nothing will ever beat stalker as my favorite game. I love this game so much that my alias online is a nod to it :D AND because of SoC I later went on to play Fallout, which why now I am one of those people crying on the internet for Fallout 4. I also tried that ""game that payed to be ""Crowned"" the best in 2007"" and I saw that I was missing out on a great game. SoC ""set me free"" and now I enjoy as much games as I can when ever I can. Currently my PC is busted and I am using a shitty laptop so I can't play the game, but all this reading from the subreddit and me writing this post made me want to play it again, for the 4th time, because I want to see what will I experience this time, because every time I got something different. I went blind, got crushed by a falling building and even got to meet that handsome man that MarkedOne needs to kill. And i might even try out the complete mod this time, because I want the game to be pretty :D even tho I have grown very fond of the texture ""quality"" of the vanilla version. It had its own charm on me.  Now for your trouble, here is the picture.Sadly, I am not sure were I got into the fire fight, 2 options come to mind: Railroad bridge or at the end of Cordon zone leading to Garbage. Either way, I tried to sneak undetected by the military but failed and was forced go on the offensive and use all my ammo for AK74u that I collected up to that point to kill them all. MarkedOne 1 Ukrainian Military 0  Picture: MarkedOne vs the entire Ukrainian army"

gog,2wlhqo,logion567,2,Fri Feb 20 22:53:49 2015 UTC,"Hello Rookie stalkers. I have a little tip for you. In game there are objects with awesome properties created by the zone called artifacts. And there are three specific artefacts I want to write about. They are called Stone Blood, Meat Chunk and Soul. You see acording to their description theese artifact give you health, hovewer they also make you less bulletproof, mutantproof and fallingproof :P. This is mostly true hovewer they don't add you health. They just boost your HP REGENERATION. That means they shouldn't be used when in a fight because then cons>pros. Put them on when safe and wait some time to save a medkit.  Some more tips: Never loot bodies when in a firefight. By pressing ""H"" you are going to acces the list of contacts around you (active PDA's). I reccomend playing without screen chrosshair, disabled minimap and on Master difficulty (the game is more immersive and realistic). If anyone is interested - my loadout (real life names in brackets): Armor: Unique Tourists suit (aquired from Sidorovich). Sidearm: SipT-M200 (SIG P220) Sniper rifle: SVUmk2 (Dragunov SVU) Shotgun: Chaser 13 (Moosberg Maverick 88) 5.45 caliber rifle: Obokan with a PSO scope. (AN-94 Abakan) 5.56 caliber rifle: TRS 301(ZM LR300 ML) with SUSAT scope M203 granade launcher and silencer, 9x39 rifle: VLA Special Assault Rifle (AS Val). Obviously i dont carry everything at once.

I installed the first game to play, and it's tough as balls. It's very good, though. The game factors in inertia and momentum, which is something I haven't seen much of in space flight sims.  It takes a page from those games in the 90's where it slaps the controller out of your hands and screams ""SO LOOK IN THE MANUAL YOU CHUMP!!!"" when going through what passes for tutorial missions. Difficulty ramps up very quickly."

There are plenty of Paradox games though that aren't Grand Strategy. Games like Magicka, Game of Dwarves, etc are all run by Paradox. To be honest, many of the games that I really enjoyed lately are owned by Paradox. They do have a tendency to release some pretty buggy releases... but they are usually awesome about following up and fixing them.   That said, as far as the stuff that GoG is getting so far, it looks like it's mainly the old stuff that's had years of bug fixes and whatnot already. Not sure what the modding scene is like for the original EU, but the CK2 has some pretty awesome mods for it, including a full conversion to Game of Thrones that's pretty impressive."

All in one modpack, does graphics replacements mostly.  Easy to install. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl  Warning:  Includes minor gameplay tweaks.  Some may like it, others won't.  There are also ""Complete"" mods for Clear Sky & Call of Pripyat.  As well, ""Misery"" for CoP (which is a hardcore mod as well as a graphical overhaul) & ""Autumn 2"" for SoC (mostly just graphics but I could only run it at 30fps so warning there.)   Duke Nukem 3D's got some model/texture replacement mods that run on the ""eDuke3D"" source port.  Too many to link.  Honestly, I play the Megaton Edition nowadays, and I prefer the original graphics. Mount & Blade series has a crapton of mods. (Nexus Mods will get you started).  Floris Mod Pack for Warband is what I used, which also added some gameplay features on top, while not changing the game much. Not a texture pack, but the VCMI project for Heroes of Might & Magic III Complete acts as a mod manager & HD mod allowing you to use any resolution you want.  I wouldn't recommend above 720p if your eyes hurt looking at tiny things though. Don't forget all the resolution mods for the old Infinty Engine games like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale & Planescape Torment.  There's a GOG thread for each to getting you up to spec.  Nothing changing the textures but the games look good at 1080p.  Can't say the same for the text.  Similar mods exist for the Fallout games if you were lucky to grab them before they were removed.  FO2's got its own content restoration mod so get that and both have 1080p mods available. Deus Ex's is getting a mod overhaul or redo soon (Forgot the name).  Keep an ear out for that.  Otherwise, its got some some texture mods as well. HDTP (High Definition Texture Pack) also showed up, as well as Shifter.  Also I use a replacement .exe (Called DEUS EXE or something) that acts as a launcher and comes with better Direct X & Open GL support. Not a HD project, really but you will need Arx Libertalis if you're gonna play Arx Fatalis as that game was quite choppy vanilla without the mod.  Something to do with Windows 7 or 8.  So I'll mention this as its freaking required.  Plus makes the game look a tad nicer than vanilla so it counts. Not graphics either, but I see Knights of The Old Republic II is on GOG now, so everybody needs the Restored Content Mod.  This is compulsory.  Circle of Eight mod for Temple of Elemental Evil is also required.  [It's a big unofficial community bugfix patch, maybe balance changes as well IDK.]"

gog,2v2hfi,Twinge,9,Sat Feb 7 06:00:23 2015 UTC,"The one thing I always like to emphasize about FTL: it can often feel luck-heavy at first, but in reality good enough play will win the game virtually every single time even on the hardest difficulty."
gog,2v2hfi,niky45,6,Sat Feb 7 09:34:23 2015 UTC,"THIS.   in the end it's NEVER the RNG's fault. it's the lack of skill.   maybe not in that exact moment (.... you can't beat the game with a poor loadout), but in all the decisions that got you there. a mistake you made a few sectors ago.   and that's what I love most about FTL. that moment when you realize it's just a question of trying some more times, 'till you get it and are able to win with whatever the game offers you on that run.   100+ hours later, I love this game more than ever. even though I have a terrible backlog which will last me for years is I keep playing FTL again and again and again."
gog,2v2hfi,not_perfect_yet,2,Sat Feb 7 09:40:25 2015 UTC,Aaaand surely you can demonstrate that with 10 consecutive wins with engi B on hard. Can you make a video of that?
gog,2v2hfi,DiscordDraconequus,2,Sat Feb 7 16:07:51 2015 UTC,"Many moons ago a friend of a friend told me that FTL was completely luck based.    Now, to say that luck plays zero part in it is silly, but the biggest factor in a win or a loss is the player.  I took what this person said as a challenge, and set out to prove them wrong.  I played 10 games in a row, with different ships each time.  It wasn't on hard mode, like you suggested, but it was before Advanced Edition so it was the hardest difficulty available.  I also turned the 10th game, with Engi B, into a drinking game.  I won every game.    There will be games where bad luck dooms you from the start, but those will be few and far between.  90% win rates on normal and hard are very possible.  There was a post on /r/ftlgame relatively recently where somebody erased their game data except for ship unlocks, and then beat every ship on hard with a 100% win rate."
gog,2v2hfi,OurEngiFriend,2,Sat Feb 7 20:12:58 2015 UTC,"70%, since they were going for achievements. There was another thread some time before that, where the person used a profile editor to skip achievements and unlock all the ships from the get-go."
gog,2v2hfi,Twinge,2,Sat Feb 7 21:14:34 2015 UTC,Before Advanced Edition I won with all 18 ships in the game on Normal (hardest at the time) without a loss.  I'm currently in the middle of doing Hard with every ship in the game in a row as well.  While it is technically possible to lose because of luck it is extremely rare - we're talking 1 in 200 games or so.  What normally happens is a few small mistakes (ones you may not even realize you're making) add up to your eventual demise.
gog,2v2hfi,niky45,2,Sat Feb 7 22:48:35 2015 UTC,"but man, I'm not there yet. I'm barely starting at normal, still trying to master it. almost getting to the point of not losing with the easier ships if I don't make a terrible mistake. (on normal. I can't even imagine playing on hard yet).  but I've heard of some true masters who were able of beat the game with every ship in a row (no losses in between) on hard. including engi B and the stealth ones. so it can be done.   you just require an incredible amount of skill. but then the RNG doesn't matter anymore.   .... also, 10 consecutive wins? .... you mean you'd watch a 30+ hour video? (... for me a run lasts no less than 3 hours... sometimes closer to 4. )"
gog,2v2hfi,not_perfect_yet,-1,Sat Feb 7 16:33:54 2015 UTC,"Ok, then don't go around saying things like that. FTL is RNG based. That means you will lose because of it. I'm not saying how much and certainly you can get pretty good with it, but you can't compensate that you can just not find any shops or any weapons."
gog,2v2hfi,Twinge,3,Sat Feb 7 16:37:52 2015 UTC,"you can't compensate that you can just not find any shops or any weapons   There's at least 1 guaranteed shop per Sector - 2 guaranteed in Abandoned, Zoltan, Civillian, Engi, and Slug.  It's impossible not to find stores if you're playing correctly.  You can say that luck will affect your chances of success based on your skill level, I suppose: a so-so player will lose games because they didn't have good enough luck to make up for their lack of skill.  But with good enough play virtually every single game is winnable."
gog,2v2hfi,Blan21,1 point,Sat Feb 7 22:55:06 2015 UTC,you can just not find any shops or any weapons.   If you can't find any shops it's because you didn't bring long-range scanners and were not good enough at the game to use one of the various events to map out sectors.
gog,2v2hfi,niky45,1 point,Sat Feb 7 16:43:13 2015 UTC,"FTL is RNG based. That means you will lose because of it.   .... but only 'cause you still aren't good enough at it.    but you can't compensate that you can just not find any shops or any weapons.   I've never played on hard. but on easy, once I didn't find a single weapon 'till sector 6. so I had to do with kestrel's starting loadout. it was a pain in the ass. but I did it (and won). the same happened to me in my first-ever normal run. but the lack of skill (due to the higher difficulty) killed me soon after that.   I agree most of us don't have enough skill to even win on normal reliably. but it's a problem of lack of skill. which can be addressed with luck, yes. but still. you may win 'cause the RNG, but you'll always lose due to a bad decision.   also, just to be clear. FTL is by no means easy. indeed, it's incredibly hard, even on easy. but you don't need the favor of the RNG, you need to die a thousand times to get the necessary skill and knowledge to win easy.   normal is a whole other thing. but the more I play it, the more sure I am that I don't die due to the RNG, but due to my lack of skill. after a death I close the game and think, ""what did I do wrong?"". and I always find an answer (or else I'll ask at /r/ftlgame for advice... and find out that I was right: I did indeed made some mistake - maybe in the same fight, maybe a few sectors ago at a store. or just before the store, upgrading the ship before getting a chance to buy the blessed cloak.)"
gog,2v2hfi,Slashlight,4,Sat Feb 7 17:02:15 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say never RNG's fault. The Stealth ships have a pretty rough time in the first chunk of the game because a single encounter with beam weapons will either flat out end your run or leave you hobbling along until you eventually die. Similarly, the fact that hitting/dodging is complete luck of the die means that occasionally the game will just decide to bone you over.  Not that RNG's a bad thing. It keeps things fresh. Just don't give people the wrong impression that your loss is always your fault. Sometimes the game just decides to drop a rock on your head."
gog,2v2hfi,vikingerik,2,Sat Feb 7 12:40:38 2015 UTC,"Stealth vs drones is often cited as the biggest RNG swing in FTL... but even this can be mostly solved with skill.  You have to watch what the drone is aiming at and use your cloak when it's about to shoot something important.  You can work out the drone's target from its alignment right before it shoots.  Drones always aim at the exact center of a room so there's usually only one or two possibilities from a given angle.  If it's aiming at a blank or unimportant room (doors, sensors), let it hit.  When it aims at weapons or cloaking, then you cloak.  I read about this tactic, went to try it out, and won five consecutive games on Hard with Stealth ships."
gog,2v2hfi,niky45,1 point,Sat Feb 7 15:26:21 2015 UTC,"Sometimes the game just decides to drop a rock on your head.   yeah. but if you have enough skill, you can pull it out and make a win even then (tip: no, I'm not there yet)  I agree there are some ships that have a hard start. stealth ones, engi B, zoltan (B and especially C), Rock A.... but in the end it's not the RNG's fault. say: stealth A (or even B), against a beam 2 drone (and a mini beam). you're pretty much dead, right? nope. you just need to cloak and power your L4 engines 'till the FTL is charged, then run as fast as you can. you may take some damage in the meantime, but FTL never was about doing a 0 damage run, nor again wining every single battle. and the stealth ships are not easy to begin with.   ... well I do agree that most people would be dead in that case (been there, done that), but only, cause they still need more skill.   obviously the RNG has a huge impact in the game. but in the end, your death was caused by your decisions. not in that same fight, but maybe a couple sectors ago, when you decided to go for that shiny BL2 instead of spending the scrap on a new shield layer. after all, you should alreaydy know that by sector 5-ish a rebel can have 2xBl2 plus an artemis. (... that would be one of the nightmarish loadouts to see at that sector, BTW)"

So, the thing I want to plug most is the soundtrack, because it's absolutely perfect for the game, and not only that, but it's fun to listen to even outside of playing. Ben Prunty absolutely knocked it out of the park! A good deal of the Kickstarter money went to him so he could focus on making the soundtrack full time, and I think a lot of us at /r/ftlgame would agree it was money well-spent.  You can stream it for free or buy it here. He also made brand new songs for the Advanced Edition content that are even more awesome.   I'd also like to point out if any of you are thinking about buying and confused about what Advanced Edition is – that's free content that comes free with the purchase of the game. Basically it's a patch that adds a new race, a lot of new ships, new events, new weapons, new drones, and more. You can choose to enable or disable the content at the main screen: I'd suggest starting with it disabled just so you can get a feel for the game, the races, the ships, and the weapons. Since AE adds so much, you'll be going up against a wider array of threats – but you'll also have more ways to deal with them!"

gog,2v2hfi,OurEngiFriend,7,Sat Feb 7 06:23:20 2015 UTC,"Infinite Space is a mod that turns FTL into an endless sandbox game, rather than a mad dash through seven sectors to beat a final boss. Infinite features no final boss, and is basically ""play until you lose"", with mini-bosses at the start of each sector.  However, it's been abandoned, and has not been updated to include Advanced Edition systems, weapons, and mechanics.  Captain's Edition (another campaign overhaul mod) has a ""CE Infinite"" module, which is an optional mod installed on top of Captain's Edition. Should you download it, it does the same thing as Infinite Space, but includes the arsenal and events of Captain's Edition (and Advanced Edition)."
gog,2v2hfi,0003c9fe,3,Sat Feb 7 06:29:27 2015 UTC,Has the mod author shared the files with the community to work on?
gog,2v2hfi,Redyoshi101,6,Sat Feb 7 06:33:42 2015 UTC,"The mod format, .FTL, is open-source by nature. .FTL is actually just a renamed .ZIP archive, which can be unzipped by any archiver worth a damn. The files within are just 32-bit PNGs, XML, and TXT files. So by distributing the mod, you are in a sense sharing the files of the mod.  However, it's considered kind of rude to redistribute other modders' work, unless you've asked beforehand or (in some cases) you're ""adopting"" the mod from the original modder. I guess in this case, no one's adopted Infinite Space, since Captain's Edition already has a similar implementation. RAD-82 has made a similar mod for vanilla FTL called FTL: Extended, which uses the same mechanic Infinite Space does, but doesn't introduce any of the new events found in Infinite Space."

gog,2v2hfi,Anistuffs,2,Sat Feb 7 07:02:30 2015 UTC,"This is a cool idea. I might post a story-thing later but here's some of my favorite builds in recent memory:  Dual fire beams and a MKII flak gun on the Stealth C  This loadout was really fun. Dual shield drones also made this quite a unique run. For the non-FTL players: Fire beams are really fun weapons. They're beams - so they can't miss the enemy ship - and they cause a wake of crew-killing, system-burning fire wherever they sweep. They can't penetrate shields, but with a flak II gun - essentially a sawed-off shotgun - shields are no problem. The shield drones periodically create layers of impenetrable super-shielding around your ship.  Triple heavy lasers+hacking on the Engi B  The DPS on this loadout was incredible. Automated reloaders made this super fun. For the non-FTL players: Heavy lasers are cheap, power-efficient, and deal a healthy amount of hull damage with a quick reload and a chance of hull breaches and fire. They're frequently used as volley-enders; that is, they're fired after other weapons to deal the actual damage to the enemy ship (as opposed to being used to strip shields). A level 3 hacking module can safely and reliably disrupt an enemy shield system to the point where it's a sitting duck - so no need for extra ""shield-stripper"" weapons.  And of course, the infamous Ion Bomb-Flak II-Glaive Beam-Preigniter loadout  Destroy. Everything. For the unenlightened: Ion bomb does a large amount of ion damage to a system - meaning it's not damaged, but disabled until the ionization wears off. Flak II, as said above, is basically a sawed-off shotgun that is excellent at shield-stripping, and the glaive beam... oh, the glaive beam. Can't miss, does an incredible amount of hull damage in a single fire... but has a large charge time.  The preigniter fixes that ""charge time"" problem by having every weapon charged and ready to fire as soon as you jump into a battle. If you don't kill a ship immediately, you leave it completely crippled."
gog,2v2hfi,Limiate,3,Sat Feb 7 09:52:06 2015 UTC,This stuff looks cool...where am I supposed to be looking?
gog,2v2hfi,zasdarq,3,Sat Feb 7 06:33:36 2015 UTC,"Good point. The player ships are on the left - weapons are attached to the side of the ship (and shown in a list on the bottom of the GUI), defensive drones (such as the shield drone) orbit the ship. Not shown in any of these loadouts are offensive drones, which ""dance"" around the enemy ship.  The enemy ship shown on the right in the first two screenshots is the final boss - beat it and you've just bagged a victory.  The third screenshot is different - it's a screenshot of the cargo hold (think inventory), with equipped weapons at the top, equipped drones below that (only if you've purchased a drone system), storage slots below that in a grid, and augmentations to the right (where you see the weapon preigniter and long range scanners)  Weapons:  -The fire beam is the weapon that looks like a red beak made out of saws  -The Flak II is the tube that looks like it has a pump in the back  -The heavy laser is the only weapon in it's screenshot but... it looks like an artillery piece  -The ion bomb looks like a slot, or a tray - the bomb is extended from there and then teleported onto the enemy ship  -The glaive beam is the big thing with a focuser.  I've also edited my original post with descriptions of the loadouts for non-FTL players."

gog,2v2hfi,Byzantine_Guy,3,Sat Feb 7 06:35:29 2015 UTC,"Yep! I'm a modder myself; I go by the name ""NarnKar"" on the forums. Usually I just make ship mods; I'm not proficient at the event coding yet.  I'd recommend, well, my own mods obviously [obligatory plug!] (just kidding).   For visual mods, I'd recommend Better Planets and Backgrounds, Sanmoku's Replacers mod, HD Backgrounds, Ship Greeble Graphics, Crew Diversity Mod, and possibly Shiny! UI Overhaul. I recommend so many because they're purely eye candy mods, which don't change the gameplay at all.  Ship mods, well, add ships. The modded ship replaces an existing one (usually Kestrel A), and sometimes comes with custom art, guns, things like that. I've played far too many of these and I recommend a lot of them, but the ones that really stand out to me are Kieve's Obsidian Cruiser and brothershogo's Hayabusa Drone Battleship [which was made before Advanced Edition. I updated it to include the new systems].  As for campaign overhauls, there's really only one. Captain's Edition is a massive compilation of weapons, events, enemy ships, sector types, augments, music, and artwork, slowly built up from the entire modding community's ideas and contributions. For some, it's like an FTL 2. The thing about FTL is that about a thousand horus in, you can get bored with the game and know everything in and out; that can be quite fun, but the thrill of discovery is also fun as well, and CE provides a lot of that.   I'd also recommend the Randtrel and Flagship Randomizer, for when the player loadouts and the final flagship fight are getting stale. They're a great way to shake up the experience of the game after 400 hours, since the final boss is always the same otherwise.  Still, though, out of respect for the game, I'd say this: wait to download mods until you're comfortable with unmodded FTL. Just like tasting the dish before adding salt, out of respect to the chef; get to know the game before modding it."

They do not need oxygen to survive, and actively drain O2 from the room they're in! take that, puny human invaders!  Now, this game can be brutal at times, but it has a habit of bringing out some of that brutality in players with one specific weapon.  The Fire Beam.  This weapon is probably coated with 666 carvings or something. It makes for an interesting strategy. Now, it's a Beam weapon. It does not miss, and can be targeted pretty accurately to hit as many rooms as possible because you essentially place one end a line of a certain length at a point, then rotate it around the mouse and click to set the area. it'll go along that line, hitting all rooms the line touches. However, any layer of shields will fizzle it out.  The Fire Beam is unique in that it does not do any damage. But the chance of lighting fires is very high, and these fires can spread out of control quickly. So with something to take out the shields, players can light some fires in the weapon room or the shield room, and watch as the enemy ship burns. This can be quite a power trip, watching the crew scramble to put it out while you sit back and keep adding to the problem.  But the game has a pretty cool community over at /r/ftlgame and has created some great stories. The events are really creative, and can have unexpected results, and the sheer randomness gives it a huge amount of replayability. It will also give you a perfectly reasonable fear of giant alien spiders. and the soundtrack! amazing! http://benprunty.bandcamp.com/track/hacking-malfunction-battle"

gog,2usoi6,Jelster64,3,Wed Feb 4 21:10:15 2015 UTC,"How I troubleshoot in order:   Right-click on the game's .exe and hit Properties.  Set it to run in Windows XP SP2 mode & Administrator.  Work down from there to Windows 95 mode.  Turn off Aero.  If not.. PCGamingWiki.  Usually a good resource for popular to semi-popular games, but something like this may not have anything. Google ""[name of game] Win 7 64bit.""  Start browsing around.  Try some of the tricks mentioned.   If you have Linux installed as well, you can try Wine.  Wine in my experience, can sometimes run old Windows programs better than Windows.  This is usually since they don't remove compatibility usually for older DirectX stuff like Microsoft tends to do.  I know that GOG also will swap in a Wine-based .dll for DDraw on some of their games (Icewind Dale for sure) because the Win7/8 version doesn't work or performs like ass.   So if you are dual-booting, testing in Wine is an option.  YMMV and all.  You can also try running WinXP or 98SE in a Virtual Machine.  Although great for standard programs, not-so-effective with games.  If none of this works.. I'd give up.  At this point what's left is messing with .dll & .exe files with a hex editor, or re-writing the entire engine through reverse engineering (openXcom style)."

The Cleric will be a little bit harder to play because they have to divide their attribute points between Strength and Intelligence but the Mage is all Intelligence so its fine.

gog,2qbj2q,RagingMayo,3,Thu Dec 25 16:24:38 2014 UTC,"Dear GOG Community,  first of all I have to say that it is so great to see that ""grown-up"" attitude and how objectively the whole topic was discussed. It is a pleasure being part of the GOG.com community (both as a gamer and as a publisher's representative). Here is our statement on this matter:  At Nordic Games, we treasure all the strong and long-dated partnerships with our offline- and online retail partners equally. We believe and aim for an equal treatment between the digital, and the boxed versions of all our games and among said partners.  The decision to remove certain games from the gog.com platform was not an easy one. Gog.com and Nordic simply were not able to reach a mutual agreement at the moment. We considered several aspects and implications thereof, while also staying true to our equal treatment principles towards all of our partners worldwide.  However, this decision does not affect our company’s viewpoint on the following subject areas:  - We like the gog.com folks and we will continue to work together with gog.com on selected games  - We unrestrictedly share gog.com’s stance on DRM-free versions and we will keep releasing DRM-free and/or widely accepted DRM versions of our games.  - Our own equal treatment principles remain coherent; we do not want to put one of our partners in a special place and cause a stir with other partners  What do we mean with the last point exactly?  Given gog.com’s decision to aim for an exchange-rate orientated pricing would leave us in the unenviable position of constantly having to adapt our pricings in all territories on- and offline to ensure an equal treatment. As exchange rates are very dynamic in nature with the potential of shifting rapidly, and given our network of more than 100 off- and online partners, this will result in a significant amount of extra time and work. For a company of our size, this can result in a non-manageable effort and will heavily impact our work hours, which we would like to dedicate to all the great games in our pipeline (such as The Book of Unwritten Tales 2, SpellForce 3, The Guild 3, MX vs. ATV Supercross and many more), rather than constantly adapting our global pricing structure.  We are aware that this decision might lead to raised eyebrows amongst certain members of the gaming community, but it had to be made and we as a company adhere to it.  With playful and gaming regards,  Nordic Games    – Posted August 28, 2014 @>Last Chance Special for numerous titles, save up to 80%"

gog,2q9kzi,joecarst,1 point,Wed Dec 24 20:55:29 2014 UTC,"I was very impressed with NOLF when it first came out.  I found the presentation clever, the gameplay very good, and the levels very memorable– so much so that I still remember a stealth mission to infiltrate the enemy's base and sabotage a rocket, involving being trapped under the rocket before ignition.  I thought the gameplay and overall style was top-notch.  However, I tried playing NOLF a couple years ago and was extremely disappointed.  In my humble opinion, it has aged terribly.  I remember that I was very bored with the gameplay in particular.  I think that what it did, in terms of gameplay, has been done many, many times since and improved upon to the point where I couldn't bear it in NOLF.  Basically, every component of the game has been improved upon time and time again and become a staple of FPS gaming, to the point where playing NOLF feels like playing a very poor example of a FPS.  All that remains is the style, and by modern standards even that is not impressive anymore.  tl;dr  NOLF was once a great game but only for it's innovation.  Everything has been done better and it's no longer enjoyable to play."

Since then, my potential game time has diminished substantially to the point that I now simply don't pay attention to achievements. They're sort-of a non-issue for me now, and my attitude towards them is simply ambivalence.   In other words, I'd not apply the word ""obnoxious"" to them, and I'm hoping you can elaborate on that."

My advice, stay out of the sarranid (yellow) and nord (blue) areas for a while until your army is sufficiently strong (the sea raiders and desert bandits will roflstomp you) enough to take on mountain bandits with ease.  Also get yourself a couple followers and put the party skills on them (surgery, wound treatment and spotting) - these will help keep your army from getting wiped.  Lastly, recruit swadians (orange guys) and try to train them up asap to swadian knights and you'll be able to slaughter most enemies you encounter.   Once you get the base game down, head to the Nexus site and get the Floris mod, it really adds some nice features without changing much of the base game.  Also check out /r/mountandblade for some good tutorials."

gog,2onfz7,brianinthered,2,Mon Dec 8 18:58:19 2014 UTC,I'll send you a PM with the code I have. Hopefully it works. That help?
gog,2ocmwp,SlyScorpion,4,Fri Dec 5 09:22:27 2014 UTC,"Here is the forum explanation:   Hi, everyone!  The Galaxy team is hard at work to bring you the Client application that will let you manage your GOG.com games library more conveniently. We’d love for the initial release experience to be as smooth and streamlined as possible for everyone, but releasing an app of this scope is no easy feat.  We’ve already conducted some internal testing, and now we’d like for the Client to face a wider array of software/hardware configurations and Internet connection types. That’s where we’d like for you to come in - and help us run more tests. :)  The first stage of this test is Windows only. A separate OS X alpha will follow in the coming weeks. (Linux will follow - eventually, but it’s in the works!)  But before we jump in and hand out the alpha Client, we’d like to set some ground rules.  1) The key word here is ‘alpha’, which means that this is not the final app and not all functionalities are present. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the core tech in the Client on a wider set of computer configurations than what we can locally test on, so only core features are included. Below I will post a detailed list of what is present and what we plan to add in future releases.  2) Alpha also means that you can encounter some unexpected issues. If you have a metered connection (a bandwidth cap or payments per bandwidth used) or you’re currently playing and can’t afford a loss of game time, this might not be for you. In other words, if you want to avoid potential problems with the alpha Client, simply wait for the final release.  3) Please, please, please refrain from posting screenshots, reviews or first impressions, both on our forums or elsewhere, as this is not the final product and many changes will still be made.  Back to Galaxy!  The features included in the alpha release (in other words, what we want to test): -- client installation -- application basics (resource usage, responsiveness, stability, user interface) -- the auto-update function -- installing, updating and launching games* via the client (without a standalone installer) * not all games are currently compatible with the client, so you’ll only see the compatible ones in the alpha version of the Galaxy Client.  Features NOT included in this release (planned for subsequent releases): -- an embedded GOG.com store -- a better library view -- managing DLCs, language packs, and auto updates in the client -- downloading standalone installers and bonus content ...and more!  If you want to participate in this test, we expect some feedback from you (after all, that’s what this alpha is for!). Therefore, we expect you to have some time to test the client: -- download and install the Client app and log in to your account -- install/uninstall as many games as you can -- know how to access various logs and try different problem solutions as needed -- report any bugs and issues in our internal reporting system -- participate in discussions with our staff and follow their suggestions/requests  Yes, that does require some technical knowledge and a bit of your time. If you don’t think you’re the best person to test out the Galaxy Client in its alpha version, don’t worry! There will be a public beta once we finish this stage, when you will be able to check out the Galaxy Client without any extra requests from our end.  If you’ve read all of the above proceed to the signup page: http://www.gog.com/galaxy/alpha  We will be sending out invitations in batches (along with some more info on how to install the client and report bugs), so not everyone will receive one right away."

gog,2oadcj,venn177,5,Thu Dec 4 19:33:37 2014 UTC,"One moderator of GOG wrote in the twitch chat during OutStarWalker's stream:  ""I'm actually watching the stream through the 0.2.0.609 early build of.... TAA DAAA DUUUUM... Galaxy Client.""   2 infos:  - 0.2.0..... seems like it's gonna be out in summer 2015 at this rate :)  - Ability to browse Internet or watch twitch streams implemented directly in the galaxy client   Source  From other interviews, I gather that Galaxy is more than just a client. It is a whole collection of features and services as well and they all need to be implemented before GOG can start supporting newer and/or heavily-multiplayer games. Also, a second round of Galaxy beta promotions might happen.  They discuss quite a bit in the first hour of this: http://www.twitch.tv/gogcom/b/578119158"

gog,2oarmy,OrangeGull,2,Thu Dec 4 21:32:08 2014 UTC,Thanks for using the flair! So say they alerted you...what would this do?
gog,2oarmy,hohnsenhoff,2,Thu Dec 4 22:10:34 2014 UTC,"Encourage me to buy games to play on mac/linux even though they don't obviously run on those systems.  Also keep me from messing around with wine/PlayonLinux. It is important to note that not all games can be played with wine/PoL, but multi-platform engine reimplementations make it possible to run on those systems.  I would think they would also offer other features too, like widescreen support for older games and such."
gog,2oarmy,hohnsenhoff,1 point,Thu Dec 4 22:27:15 2014 UTC,Oh so they allow you to run the games on other operating systems?
gog,2oarmy,DocMcCoy,2,Thu Dec 4 22:42:27 2014 UTC,"Yeah! From Edit2: What is a game engine?  ""The software that drives pretty much everything you can see and do in a game. It's the code that handles input, display, rendering (graphics), AI, sound etc. It is usually created so that several or many games can be made with the same engine.""  Look at the Arx Libertatis page, you see that it says ""There are packages for Windows, Linux and FreeBSD, but you might also get it to compile and run under Mac OS X and other operating systems."" That tells us that their engine was made to run on those systems (FreeBSD, Linux and Windows) while the original game only says that it runs on windows, meaning that you have no chance of running it on anything else with out help.   I suppose the notofications would have to say the name of the engine reimplementation, and it could have the icons of the supported opperating systems. I know that GOG.com cannot offer support for these engines, and there should probably be a disclaimer near the notification."

gog,2nxxjh,fallwalltall,1 point,Mon Dec 1 16:16:03 2014 UTC,Every weekend they have a set of games for sell.  They typically have a small indie game on sale on Wednesdays.  Go through the site and find about 5-8 games that you are interested in.  Watch the site over a few months and you can probably get 2-3 of them on a very nice sale.

You select alphabetical sorting and Witcher series goes to section W starting with the earliest entry and all succeeding Witcher games ignore the alphabetical order to achieve organization.

gog,2mqbmj,hohnsenhoff,2,Wed Nov 19 19:28:42 2014 UTC,"Even CDPR didn't exactly start out good. They used to sue pirates of the Witcher, but then got such hard community backlash that they stopped and switched over to their current modus operandi. Now they are churning out smart developers who know that piracy is not something that you should hardhandedly waste resources preventing."
gog,2mqbmj,DMZ_Dragon,3,Wed Nov 19 06:15:36 2014 UTC,"Now they are churning out smart developers who know that piracy is not something that you should hardhandedly waste resources preventing.   Meanwhile at EA, Denuvo eats RAM and SSD's for breakfast.  When will they learn?!"
gog,2mqbmj,DMZ_Dragon,2,Wed Nov 19 06:21:19 2014 UTC,"EA's made the same mistake in the past (SecuROM and family, anyone?) They are simply trying to push the worst DRM on people again and again. And one day, they will succeed."
gog,2mqbmj,DMZ_Dragon,2,Wed Nov 19 06:34:33 2014 UTC,"It makes me sad though because at least Origin has shown some improvement. Yeah, it's no where NEAR as good as GOG, but at least they have no-questions-asked refunds. I thought they actually started caring about PC gaming in their messed up head of theirs, just a little, but nope. They actually want to destroy our hardware...   And one day, they will succeed.   Eh, it'll just be cat and mouse with them and the cracking scene. SecuROM took like 6 months to crack and I'm guessing Denuvo won't be much shorter, but I'm willing to wait just to spite the fuckers, because seriously, fuck EA.  They went from offering a free demo for DA2, to putting the most damaging form of anti-tamper tech in 2014 on DA:I."
gog,2mqbmj,DMZ_Dragon,1 point,Wed Nov 19 06:41:21 2014 UTC,"Origin > Steam. Yes, I said it. They do not have the games catalogue or the sales, but if you have issues, Origin gets them solved. Steam usually doesn't.  Trouble is, you are willing to wait, while many will buy en masse and burn a ton of SSDs and such. This is going to be interesting. Denuvo is already being worked on (source: scene), and we will see how quickly that gets destroyed.  Moral of the story for Denuvo is: Pirates always win."
gog,2mqbmj,IronicTitanium,2,Wed Nov 19 07:16:26 2014 UTC,"Origin > Steam. Yes, I said it. They do not have the games catalogue or the sales, but if you have issues, Origin gets them solved. Steam usually doesn't.   True enough. I think Valve has grown complacent, really, although they've never really had stellar support to begin with.  They really need to be knocked down a peg because I love Valve as a company and GabeN for being GabeN, but part of the reason I support Origin and GOG is simply because I really want competition to Steam that makes a dent, I want them to feel it. I love what Greenlight does for example, giving an opening for indie devs in the market.  I think there's one thing everybody agrees on, though: fuck uPlay, and fuck GFWL.   Trouble is, you are willing to wait, while many will buy en masse and burn a ton of SSDs and such. This is going to be interesting. Denuvo is already being worked on (source: scene), and we will see how quickly that gets destroyed.   I hope to god it's soon.  For all of the faults of Denuvo and EA, DA:I actually looks like a damn good game. If by some miracle Denuvo gets patched out, I may just insta-buy the game just to show them that I support healthy business practices.   Moral of the story for Denuvo is: Pirates always win.   Yes, no clue why big publishers fail to realize this at this point. Rockstar, EA, and Ubisoft need to get their heads out of their asses.  Hoping to all the stars above that GTA V isn't sporting some sort of Denuvo-like DRM..."
gog,2mqbmj,DMZ_Dragon,1 point,Wed Nov 19 07:22:02 2014 UTC,"Greenlight is incredibly broken, as many examples have shown (games like Paranautical Activity being denied and delayed). The idea is nice, but even Valve does not like it anymore.  I am not sold on GfWL fucking yet. It's never been noticeable to me. Uplay, meh, I had to login recently after buying Far Cry 3: BD on Steam (great game btw), and having to start Uplay after Steam.  I would wait until someone like TotalBiscuit pre-views the game before buying, because the sounds I am hearing from many friends with (less than legally) acquired early copies are not particularly positive, especially when comparing to Dragon Age 1. It looks to be better than DA2 though.  EA, Ubisoft and every AAA company already know and realize this. The problem seems to be the high executives that seem to think they can beat a group that has unlimited time and far better skills and insane dedication.  I would hope for a good GTAV port, myself. Rockstar's DRM is usually of the idiotically bad variety that often gets patched out quickly (see GfWL)."

I can tell you for sure though that at some point in time in the next few months there will be more then one bundle offering different combinations of the Ultima games even one that will include all of them (Underworld, Savage Empire/Martian Dreams ect..) I have seen this bundle for sale during their winter blowout before, and at other times of the year as well during big sales...

gog,2l6jgp,toodice,2,Tue Nov 4 03:54:56 2014 UTC,For me - The Secret Of Monkey Island™: Special Edition
gog,2l6jgp,AnxiousInfusion,10,Mon Nov 3 18:58:33 2014 UTC,"What? No, surely. Oh I see. You've played Monkey Island before but now you want to play it again with the ability to toggle between retro and modern graphics. Everyone has played Monkey Island. I was foolish to even consider otherwise.  So, I'll remind you of the combat system. The awesome, ground-breaking simulation of actual pirate swordfighting. As you'll remember, you battle enemy pirates through clever wordplay, with each fight that you lose only making you stronger. What's great about this system is that it's easily transferable to the real world. Should you end up in a real-life pirate battle one day, you'll be able to outwit even the sharpest of tongues.  I'll use this point to remind you of how you previously completed the game without dying. Those situations where death was certain, where your fingers hovered over the ""load game"" button, were turned around dramatically by a joke or two. Remember that no matter what you clicked on you could never lose or damage your progress in any meaningful way. That always left you able to try out those... riskier (and often more amusing) options.  Of course, I couldn't suggest that you played through the story again without purchasing plenty of plaster beforehand to patch up those holes in the fourth wall. Constantly throughout the game you will be spoken to directly by the main character, Guybrush Threepwood, who often shares his comments and thoughts about the current situation. Gameplay mechanics in adventure games had become rigid enough by the time that Monkey Island was written in order to allow for plenty of in-genre jokes. Jokes that even go so far as to include the interface itself as a prop.  Lastly I'll remind you of the puzzles. Well, as you will recall, they are challenging and hunt-the-pixel can sometimes rear its ugly head but this is more a fault with the genre than the game itself. At least with this incarnation you can switch between the two graphics styles and that can often be enough to highlight an object you may otherwise have missed. The logic behind the puzzles is solid though as long as you can begin to think in more cartoony terms.  Overall if it's been long enough for you to have forgotten the solution to some of the puzzles it's well worth the purchase just to enjoy the story again with some slick graphics. If, for any reason, you have never played the game then frankly, I don't want anything to do with you."

Day of the Tentacle, The Dig and Full Throttle were especially good. Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis feels much more like a fourth movie than Crystal Skull ever will.  The Longest Journey and it's sequels are incredible storytelling. For a bit of fun, check out the Kyrandia games (the second one, Hand of Fate, was always my favourite).  If you're more into the Sierra style of adventure games, then their best releases would be King's Quest 6, Police Quest 3, Space Quest 4/5 and the first Gabriel Knight."

gog,2kztuv,Denhonator,1 point,Sat Nov 1 22:25:56 2014 UTC,"There is definitely a lot of information and things to figure out before these games click, it's a huge part of the appeal of these old school type games for me. Nowadays everything feels so streamlined and set.  Breath of fresh air that Ubisoft even attempted being true to M&M with X, also there's those Grimrock games - I fiddled with the first a bunch, have you checked it out?"
gog,2kztuv,Denhonator,2,Sat Nov 1 22:50:47 2014 UTC,"Nothing wrong with having to learn the things and not have the game hold your hand. I like that. It makes you feel you actually accomplish something yourself. I just find that in those cases, if the game does not completely appeal to me, I'd rather put the effort in a game that does.  I don't know about M&M X, but I could see their attempt in their HoMM games, but yeah, it was a good attempt. The games are not bad, but not what made HoMM 2 and 3 good either.   I've never gotten to know Grimrock games. What are they like?"
gog,2kztuv,Denhonator,1 point,Sat Nov 1 23:04:19 2014 UTC,"They are a kind of a mixture of on-rails turn based RPG, Rogue-like (super hard and mean - but I can't remember if you can make it easy) and looking for secrets and levers by clicking every surface. It's grid based.  I personally didn't finish the first one, and don't remember it that well, but they're really well received (metacritic 82) and are certainly something I now want to give another go at Xmas or maybe after I go through the Might and Magic games again. They might be more up your alley since you're more experienced with the grid style than me.  I did think HoMM:V was pretty fun for the hotseat/LAN, but they really gimped the amount of multiplayer content and that was usually my favourite thing (though HoMM:3 has awesome campaigns). Why they didn't put more effort into fun hotseat levels with coop I don't know, and the map editor you could use to make procedurally generated 2v2/v2/v2 maps had so little variance it didn't really do the trick.  I played HoMM:VI mostly single player as I'd moved away from my pal who'd I'd play with, and I lost interest in the campaign really quick."
gog,2kztuv,Denhonator,2,Sun Nov 2 00:01:03 2014 UTC,"Then I guess I should keep an eye out on Grimrock sales. I like it when a game is ""super hard and mean"". Well, at least I do if the game pleases me in other aspects.  Something I am ashamed for that I haven't yet played is HoMM 2. I know, I complimented the game earlier, but I am 99% sure I will not change my opinion after playing it. I'll be sure to get it from the next sale on GOG. Maybe IV as well."
gog,2kztuv,Gypsy23,1 point,Sun Nov 2 00:22:25 2014 UTC,"I've played both, HoMM:2 is really great and has some creatures and concepts I wish they retained (Dragons get upgraded from Green -> Red -> Black I believe in the Dungeon town), and the art style is a bit more... ""pretty"" than HoMM:3 - the colours used are reminiscent of like decadent Egyptian/Arabic jewelry.  3 is really a stronger game, though I wish that HoMM:3 looked more like 2. It had a more charming style. It's pretty much the difference in art and colours that you see in M&M 5 -> M&M 6. Realism and newer technologies can make things look uglier."

I've been lurking about for a bit, mostly to catch news of new releases, the occasional freebie, (thanks GoG!), and to keep an eye on this Galaxy thing that's in the works.  The oldest game I've ever played is probably Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom for my Coleco Adam. It was first released in 1982, although the Adam version was released in 1983. It was probably around 1985-86 when I first played it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pHuAlXEN7M  It came on a tape.  Tied for oldest would be the 1983 Star Wars arcade game, of which my local arcade had the sit-down cockpit style.  Dear god, I've been playing video games for almost 30 years.

My collection is fairly...extensive... so I don't find myself buying more games often absent new releases to GoG.  I started using GoG when I got sick of tracking down games that I played when I was younger- things like the Gold Box TSR games that I keep waiting to show up in the vault.  Pool of Radiance might be the oldest game PC I've played, but I can't be sure.  I didn't even get that game until the Windows 98 era in the Forgotten Realms collection.  I had Ultima VI and The Genie's Curse before that, although they were released after.  I have since also played Nethack and Adventure, but I'm not sure if those count.  I keep hoping that more esoteric older titles will be released- Dark Heart of Uukrul, the aforementioned Gold Box Games, etc.  I mostly want to be able to experience the greats from that era that I missed the first time around, and go back and forth between replaying old classics and the newer generation of games."

Like x-wing and TIE-fighter, but slightly improved and had multiplayer.  Episode I: Podracer. Race the galactic circuit in your podracer. Super fun.  Other indiana jones games.  Other monkey island games/sequels.  The Battlefront series. Play as a stormtrooper or other infantry unit in star wars first/third person war shooter.   Rogue squadron. Another flight simulator, but more of the missions focus on in-atmosphere than in-space,  creating a more 2d feel imo.  Battle for Naboo. Like rogue squadron, possibly its sequel.   Star wars: dark forces/jedi knight. Third person rpgs where you play as a jedi and  upgrade force powers and weapons. Had multiplayer.   Republic commando.

gog,2kleki,brianinthered,5,Tue Oct 28 18:42:53 2014 UTC,"They're pretty amazing story-wise, they're worth playing for that alone. However, I'd recommend finding a way to play Blood Omen 1, and just skip Blood Omen 2. Blood Omen 2 is inferior in pretty much every way and most fans prefer to ignore it as much as possible. It introduced a lot of weird story elements that were never really resolved satisfactorily and that may never be now because it's been over ten years since the story has continued. Which leads to my other warning, keep in mind that the finale of the games is emotionally satisfying, and does tie up a good amount of loose ends, but wasn't meant to be the last game and thus still leaves some big things unresolved. Also, if you find trouble understanding any aspect of the story, feel free to ask me about it, I've been a big fan of these games for a long time."
gog,2kleki,BeTheGuy2,2,Wed Oct 29 00:27:14 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the additional information.  You guys painted a great picture of the Legacy Of Kain series I'll definitely pick them up. I loved arcadish games like Enclave and Rune, but also love the simulation aspects of Arx Fatalis. So I think these games are right up my alley"
gog,2kleki,ashinroy86,2,Wed Oct 29 17:48:23 2014 UTC,"Legacy of Kain is one of my all-time favorite series. The voice acting and story are top-notch, even by modern standards. The games vary a good deal in style from title to title, so I'll try to break down them below. Across the board, however, you'll find an engrossing narrative that'll demand your returning for more.  1) Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain is the first game in the series and remarkably different from the others. You take on the role of the titular Kain, a newly born Vampire. The game's an isometric action RPG  of sorts. Think somewhere between Diablo and Castlevania.  2) Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is arguably the best in the series. You play a new protagonist, Raziel, a former vampire turned ghoul. The game plays a bit like Legend of Zelda: OoT in that it's an open world action adventure title incorporating some RPG elements and puzzle-solving. One of the awesome things about the game, especially for its time, was that there was no loading between environments or stages. Also, there are no check points or save slots. Dying in-game is handled very interestingly, and there are some puzzles that require you to fade in and out of the spirit world.  3) Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 2 is a direct sequel to Soul Reaver, and plays very similarly albeit more streamlined. Less of an open world than the last, but tighter combat and visuals.  4) Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen 2 is the bastard child of the series. It wasn't penned by the same team, so as /u/BeTheGuy2 described, the story's pretty far out of canon as far as some fans are concerned. There are literally characters who reappear from the dead without explanation. In terms of gameplay, this is more of an action game with very linear level progression. At the same time, none of the other titles made me feel more like an awesome vampire than this one. I loved picking up random civilians and feeding on them. For what that's worth.  5) Legacy of Kain: Defiance was the premature finale to the series. It's very much an action game (think Devil May Cry) that periodically has you switching between Raziel and Kain. The game's a lot of fun, but lacks the gameplay depth of most of its predecessors. The visuals are good, though, and the story simply can't be missed for fans of the series.  Hope that helps! Make sure you report back once you've ventured into Nosgoth to tell us how your adventures are faring.  Edited: Clarified Blood Omen 2's canon status a bit. The game IS canon for all intents and purposes, it just doesn't really fit with the rest of the series."
gog,2kleki,crono09,3,Wed Oct 29 16:37:56 2014 UTC,"Wow, thanks for all the detail on each game. I will definitely pick these up. It appears GOG has all of them!  So I'm in for a long ride. I really like the sound of open world, even with older games. I remember playing the first on on SNES, but never got very far. Thanks again."

gog,2kboek,SPCR,2,Mon Oct 27 23:12:20 2014 UTC,"There's a lot of great games that could come out of this. The early Star Wars stuff, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, Full Throttle, Sam and Max, Day of the Tentacle, Loom, Grim Fandango, Monkey Island (especially the third one, which, while IMHO not as good as the first two, was still enjoyable but is now almost impossible to find)...  It's always puzzled me, because those games would probably net a fair amount of sales today (partially out of nostalgia, partially out of the legend that's been built around them, partially because some of them are just damn good games), but most of them haven't been made available. Hopefully this is changing.  If I had a sword, I'd fall on it in disappointment if this turned out to just be the Special Editions of Monkey Island 1 and 2. I mean, those are great, but I suspect most people who are interested already own them."

gog,2i3x50,brianinthered,1 point,Thu Oct 2 17:34:14 2014 UTC,I had problems with this as well.  It really requires DosBox instead of just running the GOG version in Wine.  The reason is because GOG bundles the Windows DosBox emulator with the game.  So you are using Wine to run an emulator to run a game. Check out this Guide on how to use Linux DOSBox to run games like Fallout
gog,2i3x50,brianinthered,1 point,Thu Oct 9 22:15:30 2014 UTC,"Odd. I've played a fair number of GOG bundles with DosBox, but it's usually pretty obvious.  Why would they use the Dos version of Fallout when they could use the Windows version? Why doesn't it show the usual DosBox files and installation stuff?  Are you saying I'd have better luck with my old Windows disk?"

Maybe  I was thinking of Dungeon Keeper or some other game.

The new one makes things harder to read to read, it all looks like one big grey blob and the different sections of the page do not stand out. They also took out the ability to see review by date meaning that if you write a review for a game that already has more than a handful then no one will see it."
gog,2eu7gv,RagingMayo,2,Thu Aug 28 19:45:29 2014 UTC,"I'm not a fan of having news on the left and games on the right. It may be that is just what I'm used to from steam but it just seems off to me. Another thing I don't like is how that gog doesn't differentiate games that you already own in the catalog but replacing the price with ""owned"" any more. That was a feature I really liked, it made browsing the store much clearer.  Edit: oh god, I've just noticed gog have added hogs of war. All of you, buy this game now."
gog,2eu7gv,Emperor_of_Mars,2,Thu Aug 28 22:29:27 2014 UTC,It's really sad that all those Nordic Games  games are being put down. Is it because the publisher doesn't want these games available on gog anymore?
gog,2eu7gv,RagingMayo,7,Thu Aug 28 23:23:02 2014 UTC,"no, according to someone from Nordic Games, the issue was when GOG started supporting other currencies they(GOG) didn't want too high of a regional price difference/want to force fair pricing, but Nordic couldn't budge as they have to keep the prices at the same level on all platforms, because of deals with certain stores(retail or otherwise). In other words if a game owned by Nordic was say going for 19.99 in USD, 35 in British pounds and 67 in AUD on Steam they would have to have the game sell for those same prices for that region/currency on all other digital platforms including GOG. GOG didn't want to agree to that and so they were forced to end their relationship and pull the games off the store."

Go to (All) Programs -> GOG.com -> SimCity 2000 and look there.  If the program is there, run and uncheck the ""Full Screen"" Option and Save your settings.  If there is no Graphic Mode Setup, you must edit the ""dosboxSC2000.conf"" file in the game's own directory. First create a backup of this file, and then edit the original dosboxSC2000.conf with a Text Editor:  Find: fullscreen=true  Change it to: fullscreen=false    Save the file and run SimCity 2000.  If you don't like the resolution, you can search for the ""windowresolution="" line and change it to a different resolution like: windowresolution=1024x768"

gog,2brw1f,SteamPunk_Devil,3,Sat Jul 26 12:13:56 2014 UTC,"So, let me get this straight here....  We have companies that charge exorbitant amounts for games that, quite frankly, aren't worth it, and bundle in bullshit Day 1 DLC with TONS of DRM included then get their games pirated out the wazoo and cry about said piracy and how it's hurting their profit margins but they can't ever possibly stop the pirates and they only end up hurting the legit consumers...  vs.  A company that eschews DRM on principle, doesn't try to take back games that it gave away by mistake, consistently provides  amazing technical support, allows the consumer to download and install it's games on as many machines as possible even though piracy may be involved, and seems to be making quite a good business of things.  Hmmm.  Personally, I have pirated games in the past, but almost always went out and bought the full game if I thought it was worth it. I could theoretically give all my GOG games away via physical copies or via torrent to millions of people, but I would actually feel bad about doing so because it all comes down to an unspoken trust. This company trusts me and I trust this company.   Maybe if the suits at some certain large companies would get their heads out of their asses and look at GOG they might actually start putting games out that people would want to buy instead of pirate."

gog,2bp1ez,MisterRoku,3,Fri Jul 25 14:46:41 2014 UTC,I did a quick search on the GOG forum and this is the best answer I could find for you.  It appears EA may hold the rights to the 90's game and Gearbox has the rights to make a sequel or new one.
gog,2bp1ez,pdxphreek,2,Fri Jul 25 15:07:10 2014 UTC,"So a rights issue will keep it from coming out again.

gog,2bpqet,brianjenkins94,4,Fri Jul 25 18:41:02 2014 UTC,"Advantages of GOG.com: Integrated DOSBox games for those who don't want to be bothered with the minute details of setting this up. OMG Old games!!! Fair pricing. No DRM.   Disadvantages of GOG.com: Their Browse/Purchase/Play flow is not good, they do not retain CC information. Downloading your titles should be do-able from the GOG downloader, not from the Browser which just sends a link to your GOG downloader. GOG accounts are nothing more than a list of game links.  Advantages of steam: By far the smoothest Browse/Purchase/Play flow of any online game distributor to date (single interface, saved CC information, download and play in seconds).  Disadvantages of steam: DRM of course. Playing offline often is wonky, having multiple PCs accessing steam can be annoying. Cloud save files can really screw you up...   Where does GOG seem to excel? Classics and giving a place to gather those that enjoy the classics. This lends to links between games where those who own Baldur's Gate may want to be informed about games coming out like Divinity Original Sin. Really I've been VERY impressed with how they handle DOSBox and their integrations, extremely good system.   Where does Steam seem to excel? Steam excels as a gaming social media platform. It also excels as a marketing tool. So much $ has been thrown in their winter/summer sales as well as weekly/daily sales. Steam excels at Multiplayer games, because of the contentedness of the platform already its easy to coordinate with friends to go play games like CS, TF2, L4D etc.  It may also seem weird, but Steam excels partly because of its age. It is incredibly difficult to dislodge a giant in a market like this. Because all the people who use their service would have to walk away from thousands of dollars of games.   What is the most encountered argument against your platform of course? My platform of choice is Steam. I've only recently started buying GOG.com games. I think the most encountered argument against Steam is the DRM argument (if you exclude issues with Greenlight).   And your retort? The DRM is there, but barely noticeable. In fact the entire experience is so smooth, some might wonder ""What DRM?"" I'm not sure what issues people have run into, but I have not encountered any. Heck I take full advantage of Steam Friends and Family as well."

gog,2bpqet,clb92,2,Fri Jul 25 20:44:51 2014 UTC,"On my phone so don't want to go into a long debate.   Basically Steam is DRM regardless of what way you spin it, been a PC gamer about 18 years and I don't really like the idea if all my games tied to an account like Steam for example.   Though steam has gotten better compared to the early years and I like not hunting down patches.   I like GOG, games are tied to an account to download but you can do what you want with the installer I.e. Back it up. Also I like the way gog are handling their Galaxy service, all the benefits of steam but optional and the games are still DRM free.   Edit: also forgot to mention. When it comes to older games Steam is almost useless for it because they do not work on ensuring it works on modern systems unlike GOG."

Then players who are interested in that can sign up to play against each other.

I had attempted to purchase Shadowrun while it was at it's lowest but steam kept failing to load at checkout. I sat their thinking, ""You know what? Gog would not have had this problem.  My gaming library consists of a few of the best PC RPGs of all time, Baldur's Gate 1+2 and Planescape Torment. I had originally bought them all a bit after launch. I had actually gotten Planescape: Torment as an Easter present from my mom the year after launch(she had no idea what to buy, thought the box art was neat, which is about what I thought when I got it).   The others are Fallout (for whatever reason I haven't picked up fallout 2 yet and I've played through it and enjoy it more), Neverwinter Nights Diamond (I can not enjoy this game, I don't know what it is, I'm going to blame 3rd ed rules), Icewind Dale (eh) and Temple of Elemental Evil, by far the worst I've ever played.  Mind you, I own the ToEE adventure box for AD&D, so it isn't a source material problem!  I'd like to go back and pick up some of the rpgs I missed out on or didn't complete when I was younger, like the latter Ultima series, Nox, Arcanum, and maybe Wizardry 8 (because having a bard get your team killed is always hilarious)."

gog,29ceb3,beyond1,2,Sun Jun 29 07:38:58 2014 UTC,"I got Arcanum a while back because it was made by Troika, and I had just finished up Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines. I really want to play it but found it really hard to get into. Any tips for a first playthrough?"
gog,29ceb3,techrogue,2,Sun Jun 29 14:57:14 2014 UTC,"First, be sure to install all the recommended mods http://tinyurl.com/nzh5nv7  Then for your first playthrough I would advise you to not play with a technology oriented character. They are underpowered and you might not get the best experience. A safe bet would be a melee character with high charisma - you will either talk or fight your way through.   Don't forget to read the manual before playing the game, it'll give you a nice overview of the lore and will make you appreciate the game more.   Last, but not least, explore as much as possible. The world is huge and has some very rewarding hidden side quests.  [edit]  I found a very useful guide that I read before my first playthrough, check it out http://tinyurl.com/mhpyeu5"
gog,29ceb3,beyond1,1 point,Sun Jun 29 15:48:18 2014 UTC,My only gripe with Arcanum was that only YOU could use the schematics you picked up in the game as items. You couldn't hand them off to someone in your party who had the skill in technology to build them. They could only build the standard items that you were able to build simply from having the skill.  I hope a mod changed that.

Tropico Reloaded - The best soundtrack ever.  Buy it just for the soundtrack to play at parties.  It's a good city building sim too.  Real funny.    Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 - RCT2 is one of the perfect games that you can come back to year after year and it's still fun.  I've been playing it on and off since it originally came out.  Jade Empire - An overlooked Bioware RPG.  Most folks know Bioware for Mass Effect, BG, KotoR and NWN, but Jade Empire is a standout action RPG based in ancient China.  I just love the setting.  Defcon - Think chess with nukes and ever expanding rules of engagement.  It has a great Wargames-like 80s era look that work so well."

gog,29ceb3,meradorm,6,Tue Jul 1 19:09:16 2014 UTC,"I haven't actually played the GOG versions of any of these, but here goes:   Heroes of Might & Magic III - Really good strategy game with my favorite style/era of graphics. There are tons and tons of missions and campaigns, so you can spend ages in single player alone. Then there's the random scenarios generator and multiplayer after that. This is one of those games you can keep coming back to for decades. Torchlight - Its sequel outshines it, but it's not on GOG. Torchlight is a well done Diablo-style game made by some of the people that worked on Diablo 2 and Fate. It's basically a combination of the best parts of both of those games. My only criticism is that it's pretty easy, so you might need ot play on one of the harder difficulties to really enjoy it. Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 - The best sandbox tycoon game ever made, with lots of different rides and buildings to choose from. It also has my favorite style of pixel art graphics. Its predecessor has more interesting scenario objective though, so if you're more into that sort of thing RCT1 might be worth getting instead. RCT1 is just as good, just with less stuff. Avernum: The Complete Saga - At least 300 hours of content here, all in one giant storyline. Once you get used to the old school design, they're incredibly immersive and the story is well done. It starts with an evil empire that throws its enemies into a hell-like underground realm called Avernum. So many people have been thrown in, they form their own societies in Avernum. There's also a well-done modern remake of the first game if you can't get used to the old games, and remakes of the rest of the series are in progress (slowly). Stronghold Crusader - The original Stronghold was fun but somewhat flawed. Stronghold Crusader introduces farmland. You can't just build farms anywhere in the desert, so green land is now a heavily contested and crucial resource. There's also a long trail of skirmish missions called the Crusader Trail. Stronghold Crusader Extreme (which I think comes with the GOG version) adds an even longer Crusader Trail, along with some very hard AI characters."
gog,29ceb3,Darierl,2,Sat Jun 28 22:03:42 2014 UTC,"Evil Genius - Who doesn't like to have control over a bunch of minions?  Pirates Gold Plus - Being a pirate is just so much fun  Dungeon Keeper 2 - A full dungeon is a happy dungeon  Theme Hospital - Dr, please attend emergency. A case of The Squits on it's way.  Roller Coaster Tycoon (Any Edition) - Honestly, how hard can it be to find the exit?. Oh there's no path leading to the exit!? My bad."
gog,29ceb3,hohnsenhoff,2,Sun Jun 29 07:45:14 2014 UTC,"Don't have much on GoG, but out of what I know is on there:  Pathologic - everybody just play the damned thing so I can quit recommending it. (Anyway, there's no other game on earth like this one. It's my favorite game, and it's incredibly important to me.) (Knock-knock by the same studio is on there too, but I personally didn't like it nearly as much, though it's still good, it's a very different game.)  Penumbra - Like Amnesia, but better.  The Cat Lady - Don't miss out on this one. Don't know where I got the impression, but I thought it was some limp, poorly done indie title until somebody gifted it to me. Wrong.  Papers, Please - Addictive and funny, but at the same time, the oppressive atmosphere and storyline is going to impress upon you if you're in the mood to engage with it that way.  Deus Ex - Obligatory."
gog,29ceb3,Darierl,2,Sun Jun 29 21:00:59 2014 UTC,"I'll only choose games that I actually have in my GOG account;  Planescape: Torment - Possibly some of the best dialogue ever written for a videogame, it is dense, intelligent and humourous. The game draws you in from the start and doesn't let up. A gem of a point and click adventure/rpg.  Freespace 2: Extremely satisfying space simulator, you get a very 'real' feeling of piloting that craft.  Torchlight: Point and click hack and slash, I've played the shit out of the Steam version, if you like fucking with your inventory and levelling up to mess up creatures, you'll like it.  Rollercoaster Tycoon 2: To be honest I've never played this, but the first one is one of the most fun games ever made and I played that till my eyes bled sweet glorious tears.  - Give kids free balloons, change colours of balloons - witness the glory.  Unreal Tournament 2004 - Boom, Bang a Bang  Honorable Mention: Guacamelee - you're a luchador with super powers."

SimCity 2000: I'd say it's the definitive SimCity game. If you've ever heard a reference to ""reticulating splines"", it's referring to this. I have the original, I bought the GOG version but I haven't installed it yet. The fastest speed is broken because it's linked to CPU clock, maybe that's fixed in the GOG version.  Spelunky: Randomly generated levels, crazy hard, but a blast to play. You'll probably want a controller for this one.  Myst: THE atmospheric puzzle solver. I played it back when it came out and I still get goosebumps playing it (maybe it's nostalgia, but it's still a good game)  Sam and Max collection: I just started this one. I played Poker Night 2 (great game that is by far the best poker game on the PC). Sam is one of your competitors. He has some great dialog, so I picked up these games from that alone, and I haven't regretted it. Works great on a touchscreen, too, for Dell Venue or Surface owners."

gog,29ceb3,tylo,1 point,Mon Jun 30 18:43:42 2014 UTC,"You can easily skip Baldur's Gate 1 and just play 2. The story is nutshelled at the start of BG2 and is a pretty cliche fantasty trope-fest anyways. The most memorable part of Baldur's Gate 1 for me is discovering the best god-damned barbarian ever written.  Planescape: Torment is very easy to get into. It's not an easy game per say, but easy because there are so many ways to do everything. Death is also a central element of the game, so don't worry about doing a quickload/save constantly. Unusual tidbit that isn't normal for a dnd game that is useful to know for P:T: Wisdom gives you an experience bonus and there are wisdom checks to unlock story details/dialogue throughout the game.  It's probably the greatest PC rpg ever written. The artwork in the game is jaw droppingly gorgeous. It is a masterpiece. I recommend doing their mod guide that get it set up with fixes and the widescreen mod so your modern computer can see it all with fonts that are legible: Planescape: Torment UI and Widescreen Guide"
gog,29ceb3,dizzyelk,1 point,Tue Jul 1 00:15:40 2014 UTC,"FTL (Faster Than Light) - Just ridiculously addictive. It's not easy, but it is rewarding. There is no feeling like defeating the flagship the first time. Heroes of Might and Magic 3 - The graphics are timeless and so is the gameplay. An absolute classic. The 5th game is really good, but I prefer the 2D look of Heroes 3. Baldur's Gate 2 - Deep story, great characters, wonderful art design, old school D & D. You can't go wrong here. NoX - An action-RPG with a lot of heart and a goofy sense of humor. It was written off as a Diablo-clone, and wrongly so. Master of Orion 2 - I still haven't found a space 4X game that is more addictive. Terraform planets, play politics, fight giant space amoebas, outfit your ships with guns that create black holes ...

gog,29ceb3,tigrn914,1 point,Mon Jun 30 23:09:56 2014 UTC,"Kinda late here, but here's my two cents:  1- Ultima VII (really the whole Ultima series, as it's one of the most influential RPG series of the early computing era, with the possible exception of the EA crap that was 8 & 9, but the ones before 6 are very hard to play, and the pre-3 ones almost impossible, due to being games from the '80s with the old school style painful interfaces)- It's still #1 on my list of best rpgs ever. Outdated, and the combat and inventory system are kinda crap. However, it's an amazing world, with great NPCs. I recommend  taking the files and running them in Exult, as it allows you to use the better paperdolls from the second part and increase your resolution and so forth.  2- Master of Orion 1 - Everyone always circlejerks about the second one, and it had some great additions, but it always just felt like Civilization IN SPACE, while the first one felt like it's own unique game. It had a great balance between macro and micro (which the third one tried and failed to achieve) that was just lacking in the sheer amount of micro needed in the second one.  3- Dungeon Keeper - It's great fun. 'nuff said.  4- The Quest for Glory series - The best thing, IMO, that Sierra produced. It's the best fusion of old school adventure game and RPG that I've ever played. Plus, it's just great fun, with the Sierra humor showing through, but not overpowering.  5- Xenonauts - A remake of X-Com that is actually like X-Com."

gog,2922gd,Darierl,1 point,Tue Jul 1 15:26:52 2014 UTC,you welcome enjoy it
gog,2922gd,hohnsenhoff,2,Tue Jul 1 18:26:06 2014 UTC,"I'm in the same boat as you. I got Magrunner, Omerta and Still Life 2 all for free. I didn't particularly want any of the games and the only one that I've even heard of before was Omerta but free is free and I'm happy to have the games. Then torchlight got put up for free, a game that has long been on my wishlist and that I might have just bought on Steam today during the sale. I was rather ecstatic to get the game. After that, I kept myself awake until 1 AM EST waiting for the next free game. Unfortunately, I never got it and fell asleep until this morning when I woke up, completely by luck, at 6:20 AM. The first thing I did was check GOG and saw American Nightmare up for free, another game that I've wanted. I haven't played any of the games yet with the exception of about twenty minutes on Torchlight but I am excited to play them! It was really amazing of GOG to do this!"
gog,2922gd,hohnsenhoff,2,Wed Jun 25 17:03:16 2014 UTC,Haha I'm glad I'm not the only one who stayed up late for this. What are your first impressions of Torchlight?
gog,2922gd,DMZ_Dragon,2,Wed Jun 25 17:21:30 2014 UTC,"The only other game that I've played similar to it is Path of Exile. Of the two, I think that I prefer PoE. However, the gameplay is still good in Torchlight and combat is rather well done as well although there doesn't seem to be as much of a focus on loot as I would like. Overall, the game is fun and I'm sure I'll spend many hours playing it."
gog,2922gd,DMZ_Dragon,1 point,Wed Jun 25 17:30:28 2014 UTC,I've never played Path of Exile. I take it you would recommend it?
gog,2922gd,hohnsenhoff,2,Wed Jun 25 17:50:06 2014 UTC,"Yes, I would definitely recommend it, unless you absolutely do not like the genre. It also has one of the fairest price models of any free to play game that I've seen."
gog,2922gd,DMZ_Dragon,2,Wed Jun 25 18:07:47 2014 UTC,"Just one, and it was the one I already have (Torchlight). It gave me a gift copy though. So I'd be willing to trade it for one of the other three games if there's anyone else in my position."
gog,2922gd,hohnsenhoff,1 point,Wed Jun 25 18:38:48 2014 UTC,"Omerta apparently has a game-breaking glitch, hence some of the negative reviews on GOG. There IS a patch to fix it, but the GOG version doesn't have the patch yet. So, heads up, maybe put Omerta on the bottom of your ""new GOG games to play"" list until GOG gets the patch.  Also, I missed that game but got all the others, bummer ): Well I didn't get Alan Wake either, but I have it on Steam so meh. Magrunner looks interesting."
gog,2922gd,DMZ_Dragon,1 point,Thu Jun 26 00:06:14 2014 UTC,"I got all of them except Still Life 2, I've played the shit out of Torchlight on Steam, it's fucking brilliant, I played the first one for like three days straight when not at work then immediately bought Torchlight 2, which is even better, I've clocked a lot of hours on that one also."
gog,290q4b,madcowbomber,3,Wed Jun 25 01:40:43 2014 UTC,"DOS or SCUMM GoG games should work on android tablets...   DOS Games require DOSBox, Scumm games can work on DosBox, but work better on ScummVM... Hope this is of some help"
gog,290q4b,speewave,2,Wed Jun 25 04:31:52 2014 UTC,"Additionally, I think you'll have to run the installer on a Windows system first, since they don't come as zip files. Then you would copy the folder to a microsd card or whatever.  Most games are meant to be played with a keyboard/mouse. I haven't used one, but I'd imaging the ASUS Transformer would be ideal. Or one that can use a USB keyboard/mouse combo. I believe dosbox has ways of doing things like differentiating between right and left click with the touchscreen, but I'd expect it to be cumbersome.  What else were you thinking of doing with the tablet?"
gog,290q4b,LegalPusher,3,Wed Jun 25 07:04:30 2014 UTC,"I assume you're talking about android tablets, and that I don't know, but I have a windows 8.1 tablet (dell specifically) and I've not had an issue playing any of the first-person games such as wing commander and Ultima Underworld 1/2 or Might and Magic games.  I use a keyboard attachment though."
gog,290q4b,TeamRedRocket,2,Wed Jun 25 05:00:54 2014 UTC,Curious is your tablet an intel Windows 8.1 or the ARM Windows RT 8.1
gog,290q4b,speewave,2,Wed Jun 25 06:55:10 2014 UTC,"sorry if I didn't make it clear, it is not an RT tablet.  100% 8.1.  It's the venue 8 pro.  I honestly don't see the purpose in getting something locked to windows 8 store.  Now, I don't know how it stacks up compared to other tablets.  I didn't really research any other one since we had a credit from dell for our work account, and I didn't need an actual computer."
gog,290q4b,TeamRedRocket,2,Wed Jun 25 06:58:39 2014 UTC,Cool.
gog,290q4b,speewave,2,Wed Jun 25 07:03:00 2014 UTC,"Also a Venue 8 pro owner, I love it. I've heard that Baldur's gate and Sam and Max games work well. I got both through GOG summer sale so I'll find out soon if the rumors are true."
gog,290q4b,Kale,1 point,Wed Jun 25 11:10:17 2014 UTC,"I figure really any older game that runs in a lower resolution should be fine, I just tried those out since you don't need a mouse."
gog,290q4b,TeamRedRocket,2,Wed Jun 25 11:12:33 2014 UTC,"Some you do need a keyboard, since there's no prompt to bring the on-screen keyboard up. MTG2014 is like that. There's an IOS and Andriod tablet version, but no way to enable touchscreen for us Windows users. Poker Night 2 runs great on the 8 pro, but theres no clean way to exit, unfortunately. I have a bluetooth keyboard and mouse, but I prefer not no use them unless I really need to.  Thanks for checking those out."
gog,290q4b,Kale,1 point,Wed Jun 25 11:22:46 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I have the case/keyboard combo and it works pretty good, I just don't like taking an extra mouse with me places."
gog,290q4b,TeamRedRocket,3,Wed Jun 25 11:25:57 2014 UTC,"If you're using an x86-based tablet, such as Dell Venue 8 Pro, which runs full Windows 8.x, you can run anything. If you run a Windows RT tablet, nothing will work. If you use an Android tablet, you can run DOS or Scumm games in DOSBox or ScummVM. You'll have to install the games to a PC first then copy the appropriate files to your tablet's storage card. None of these will run on iOS tablets, unless it's jailbroken in which you could then run DOXBox or SCUMM.   Considering the bulk of Mac OS X compatible titles are DOSbox/ScummVM games, I'd think it would be reasonable for them to provide an Android version out the door, since it would just require the same thing as Mac: packing the game with DOSBox or ScummVM."
gog,290q4b,Elranzer,1 point,Wed Jun 25 15:35:18 2014 UTC,baldur's gate and other games on that engine have a separate tablet friendly port - gemRB. you can purchase them for the data files.
gog,28znzr,next_paragraph,2,Tue Jun 24 19:10:21 2014 UTC,"If you already own it then seek out the patch. It adds three tracks, network play and split screen."
gog,28y961,YT-0,11,Tue Jun 24 09:02:20 2014 UTC,From memory Ctrl+F10 (I could be wrong with the key combo) to release the mouse pointer which will then let you alt+tab.   Edit: I was right http://www.dosbox.com/wiki/Special_Keys
gog,28y961,ANDROID_16,4,Tue Jun 24 09:59:08 2014 UTC,"That does the trick!  Thanks for the link, too!"

gog,28kcr4,Kale,3,Thu Jun 19 17:00:26 2014 UTC,"Going back to my real backlog, I have never beat Descent 3. I still have the scratched up discs from long ago when I built my first AMD Athlon system with a half gig of DDR memory. GOG has let me revisit these old awesome games, and even games I didn't particularly love, but can't bring myself to discard install discs... now I know they're at most $10 away should I ever be overcome with the desire to play them.  The only two games that I wish GOG had are SimTower and ""Stars!"". Then I'd never keep old systems around."
gog,28kcr4,Darkerson,2,Thu Jun 19 21:39:37 2014 UTC,1/2 gb? :O
gog,28kcr4,Kale,4,Thu Jun 19 21:42:42 2014 UTC,"Yep, computers used to only have 512MB (½ GB) of ram back in the day. Scary thought."
gog,28kcr4,pdxphreek,5,Thu Jun 19 22:37:15 2014 UTC,First computer I built had 4 mb. RAM. And was screaming running Windows 3.1. But I installed Windows 95 and it ran slow until I upgraded to 8mb.
gog,28kcr4,Darkerson,3,Thu Jun 19 23:58:59 2014 UTC,I remember walking a mile on one of the hottest days of the year to the computer shop to drop $90 on an additional 4mb to finally upgrade to 8mb so I could play Doom smoothly...  That was a good day.
gog,28kcr4,Darkerson,2,Fri Jun 20 00:37:44 2014 UTC,"I didnt start building my own until around 2000, but the first computer I ever had was a Tandy TRS-80 (Yes, the old Trash-80s, as they were nicknamed.) Dungeons of Daggarath was just absolutely magical to me as a kid. Loved that heartbeat mechanic. Never beat it, but I loved every second of it."
gog,28kcr4,Darkerson,5,Fri Jun 20 00:12:45 2014 UTC,"512MB was actually a lot at the turn of the century. When Decent 3 came out, Pentium 3s were the best processors you could get, which supported a maximum of 512MB. The top computers I saw still only had 256MB. Most people still used Pentium 2s, which capped at 64MB. Most people I knew had 8MB. You were lucky if you could afford 32MB."
gog,28kcr4,Kale,3,Fri Jun 20 17:50:19 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I know. I had a Pentium II 450Mhz with 512MB (4x128MB) of PC100 SDRAM on an intel 440BX Mobo at the time. It was so nice having that much back then, but the only reason I had it was thanks to some generous friends that would give me their hand me downs back when I couldnt afford anything."
gog,28kcr4,Kale,3,Fri Jun 20 18:20:09 2014 UTC,Wow. I thought I misread that because my Pentium 2 266Ghz came with 512KB (not MB) of memory. I didn't know the P2s supported that much RAM.
gog,28kcr4,Darierl,2,Fri Jun 20 18:34:34 2014 UTC,"266Ghz with ½MB of ram. XD  All jokes aside, those 440BX boards could handle 1GB total, as long as the vendor put all 4 ram slots on there. Pretty nice chipset for the time."
gog,28kcr4,Darkerson,2,Fri Jun 20 20:07:25 2014 UTC,I think so. First computer I had with a 1GHz processor too. Maybe it was less but I think it had a half gig. My memory is a little fuzzy on when each was standard.
gog,28ktwq,new-pc-builder,2,Thu Jun 19 19:35:53 2014 UTC,"Here is a link to GOG's support page, there is a ""payment options question"" topic in the drop down menu.   I hope this helps.  Edit: forgot to include link"

gog,28isb4,pdxphreek,3,Fri Jun 20 00:45:30 2014 UTC,"That'd be a mess. A lot of games do have a ""saves"" folder, but many don't. Plus there's a broad range of games, from the 80's until today with a wide range of files. Plus, what gets saved? There's game progress data, but then what about user created content like world edits or configuration settings, screenshots? Ultimately it'd have to be a general cloud storage service that would potentially hold anything.  You might be able to set something up on your computer to start sending data from your games to google drive or a similar service. Set up a directory and just start making weekly backups or something."
gog,28isb4,Brodivh,5,Thu Jun 19 14:34:16 2014 UTC,"You make it sound like a monumental and unproductive effort. The gog uninstaller always asks if you want to keep saved games... So they already know where and what all the save files are. Once their client comes out, I'd be surprised if they didn't allow some sort of cloud save with it"
gog,28isb4,ducttape83,1 point,Fri Jun 20 11:06:01 2014 UTC,Especially the games that run in dosbox etc. They can pretty well redirect the saves anywhere they want.
gog,28isb4,disso,3,Fri Jun 20 16:14:24 2014 UTC,"Yes it is a mess, which is why it is more useful for 1 company to do it once, then have multiple people creating their own automated solutions."
gog,28isb4,T_T_O_P,1 point,Thu Jun 19 14:39:10 2014 UTC,"Gog games are a lot more um, independent than platforms like Steam or Origin. You could use something like Dropbox or Google drive, but I understand what you mean about the ""ancient"" stuff. You know I bet there is a market out there not just for something like cloud storage, but for something that could be guaranteed to be accessible in like 10-20 years."
gog,28isb4,yoshi314,1 point,Thu Jun 19 16:00:56 2014 UTC,"They may be more independent but they still add the games in one by one, add art etc. I'd love to see gog get to the stage where they can offer services as well as the games, they have already started with galaxy havn't they?"
gog,28iy63,TeamRedRocket,2,Thu Jun 19 04:49:15 2014 UTC,Why do you think you need rules?  Is there some moderation stuff going on behind the scenes concerning posts that aren't visible?  (e.g. deleting many posts on /new/ etc)
gog,28iy63,TeamRedRocket,1 point,Thu Jun 19 13:45:51 2014 UTC,"Behind the scenes? Oh definitely! Not as far as banning, removing comments and the like because this subreddit is more active with votes and not comments. The most we are doing is deciding how we are forming it for the future. not...3 months ago I believe we were around 600 and now we have doubled so making sure everyone knows what we are about it is a necessity. Being able to point out the sidebar and everything being there is basic"

And you can import your GOG wishlist into an ITAD waitlist, although it takes a browser extension to do it, since GOG doesn't have a remote API for that data."

I can see what's available to buy now and what's coming up in the future.  And since there's a timer I can actually plan my day around being in front of my computer for a minute to pick something up I want.  I've already picked up 10 games this sale, I've resigned myself to never actually finishing my library backlog, now I'm just buying games to keep them for the future in case I might want to play them.    The only thing I wish was different, I wish I could click the upcoming games and see what they're about.  I know I can just use the search bar but I'm kind of lazy and it seems crazy that the upcoming game pages aren't links to the game pages."

gog,283z09,hukarez,4,Wed Jun 25 20:00:07 2014 UTC,"Maybe it's just me, or perhaps this is just the way it was designed to be - but is it possible to add more than just 1 promo bundle to buy in one fell swoop as opposed to making multiple transactions? :("
gog,283z09,hukarez,3,Wed Jun 18 14:32:27 2014 UTC,"A few ways to do it:   Go to each individual game page and add them to your cart. The prices will adjust automatically for the appropriate discounts when you complete a bundle. From the bundle page, click ""gift entire pack"" and it will add it to your cart. Do this for all the bundles you want, then on the checkout page, remove anything you don't want. As long as it still completes bundles, you'll get the higher discount. Add the game to your wishlist, then go to your wishlist in your account and add them to your cart. Same deal: complete the bundles in your cart to get the higher discount."

That's probably my only gripe with GOG thus far- the inability to add multiple bundles to a cart and purchase.    I just hope bank doesn't think I'm a victim of credit fraud once they see multiple transactions in a short period on my account!"

Wonder if they just decided if it was too much? Was there an invisible limit in stock on some ""flash sale"" items? Or is it random? (Saw Sacred Gold pop up twice yesterday, on the same sheet of flash sales.)  Things I have picked up so far: Larry Reloaded, Sacred Gold, Darkfall 3, DX: Invisible War, Pathologic, Summoner.  Also saw: Cat Lady, Driftmoon, Blackwell Bundle, Inquisitor, and Grimm on sale yesterday.  That's as far as i can remember on the flash sales."

gog,284gfd,Halfwise2,1 point,Sat Jun 14 10:43:46 2014 UTC,"1) Everyone should buy Deus Ex 1 + 2.. would almost recommend playing 2 first as it is a great game, but falls short in comparison with 1.  2) Games tend to get pulled when there is a dispute of ownership. (Which is what happened to Fallout), as it isn't clear where the profit is suppose to go. Less so for DRM. The money they made off of DX1 and DX2 is long since considered obtained. Anything now is just icing on the cake. This isn't EA we are talking about (I hope).  Thief will no be pulled unless there is a dispute of IP ownership. Deus Ex will not be pulled unless there is a dispute of IP ownership. I know less about the others and their companies to make a determination on that.  But if you haven't played either of these games, buy them, I agree. I mean if you haven't, what is wrong with you, people? :)"

I just want to recommend these to anyone interested, they are two of the greatest games ever made, in my opinion.  LBA is RPG like. I'll admit, I've only played the second one - Twinsen's Odyssey and it was amazing. It has a great story, and lots of things to do.  Dungeon Keeper is also a great game (both 1&2). If you've ever played the command and conquer games or StarCraft, it is similar. I guess its an RTS? It is a lot of fun and unique in many ways - it's also multiplayer so you can play with your friends if you want."

gog,27w367,hohnsenhoff,10,Wed Jun 11 17:17:53 2014 UTC,"I think a lot of EA games like Battlefield 4 as you suggested, would have a very large increase in players. I don't think it would alter the game too much though. The largest impact would come from a game like World of Warcraft. Dropping the DRM would mean a lot of different things.   1) There would be a lot more players. You wouldn't need an account. No DRM means you couldn't enforce a monthly fee, so the game would become 'free' for millions of people who already play it and million of people who don't play because of the cost.   2) You could host it over LAN/private servers. No DRM means the game is installed locally which could easily be played over LAN. Blizzard currently runs it's own dedicated servers, but you would see a lot more people running their own worlds and versions (Vanilla/BC only).  3) Mods. There would be so many mods. They can block external software already, but if the game is running from your computer, you can change it. Even without official support, people would find a way to open the game up.  Now for the negative ones:  1) It would be heavily pirated. locally installed means you could find a way to copy the game over to another system. Only a matter of time before it was readily available to people who didn't want to buy it.  2) Hacking. Battlegrounds would be regulated as much or at all on private servers. People would find ways to break the game. PVP would lack balance from this and PVE would be too easy as some mage could cast a spell that shoots Ragnaros' at any enemy.   3) Quality would deminish. Blizzard makes too much money from it, but most of that money goes back into the game. Either through expansions, bug fixes, GMs, or better content in general. With the 'no fee' part, you wouldn't have as good of a game.   Ultimately, I think it would be amazing. I would love to play through the game solo, or even with a couple friends without having to deal with other players. I would become a very popular co-op game. They could make money from renting servers and hosting different content. Maybe you have to pay for Arena/BG access since these have to be consistent and regulated. Regardless, it wouldn't happen. They would lose too much money."

With this week's massive update we make race choices matter more,  with racial traits impacting more class units. Water combat is more tactically rewarding, and we've added new game speed settings  that allow you to adjust empire development speed for quick multiplayer games or marathon XL maps.  See the list below for much more updates! Thanks to all of you providing feedback! This game just keeps getting better and better :-) Change Notes:  Buffs are in *BOLD**  Nerfs are in *ITALICS**  New Features   Added new game speed dropdown to advanced game options to allow players to change research and city growth speed Added 2 more speed settings so we now have: 50%, 75%, 100%, 150%, 200% and 300% speed. Added a new advanced game setup option to force tactical combat to play out at high speed Added support for the tactical AI to cast disjunction Added advanced rule to limit the heroes that spawn for a player to the races of their leader and absorbed cities. Added “Wait for GPU” toggle in the Game’s Launcher and Game Options Menu. This option might fix overheating issues. Windowed mode now restores to previous position if you restart. Also added a toggle to enable or disable this behavior. Disabling this will reset the window to start at 0.0 position with default size. Toggle can be found in the graphics tab of the launcher. Water Combat Fixes It was felt that water combat was messy and unfocussed(sic), with all embarked units feeling the same due to having fire ballista and fire cannon abilities. To fix this, water combat has been completely revamped so that embarked units act more like units on dry land.  Move points of all water only units and transports have been reduced"

Developer / Publisher:  Krillbite Studio / Krillbite Studio  Game Modes: single-player Price: $20 USD ($18 sale)         What's Cool About It:   The perspective of a two year old child. You’re small, vulnerable and helpless. But you can also crawl into small places to hide. Seeing your own hands crawling frantically under the couch makes you feel even more fragile Focused on story, not cheap scares. Merging a child’s perception of reality with its wild imagination, lets you unravel what is actually causing your own fear and confusion. Oculus Rift support. For the VR-fanatics, this feature will make sure you get as close to being a child again as you can.   Overview:   Among the Sleep is a first person horror adventure, in which you play as a two year old child. After waking up in the middle of the night to mysterious sounds, you start a journey in the dark looking for your mother.          The game lets you experience the horror felt by a child when familiar and friendly surroundings are transformed into something sinister. While wandering around in surrealistic environments, you have only your teddy bear as a companion. There might be threats hiding in every shadow, but there’s no traditional combat. Instead, you will actively have to find places to hide and avoid confrontation in order to survive. In Among the Sleep you’re vulnerable, scared, and trying to make sense of the world. Dark things will happen. How will you find comfort?"

She's an alcoholic and takes it out on her kid then tries to make up for it with gifts and such when she's sober.

But I agree with you. Maybe the devs will explain after the game loses traction."
gog,274thv,darkesco,2,Tue Jun 3 07:42:05 2014 UTC,"Sorry but the whole killing or dead thing make no sense.  Everything in the game points to alcohol, note the bottles everywhere. The drawings left everywhere show that the same character as the monster is both nice and mean to the kid.  and then there's the whole, ""you've gotta stop hiding from mommy"" bit.  Also the bit at the end where mommy is on the floor with a bottle of whiskey and lashes out at you and then recoils in shame, is rather obvious too.  Also the voice at the end is the same voice as the voice at the start, the man mommy is talking about you to, and telling him that he's not taking you away."

gog,26wyk0,hohnsenhoff,2,Sat May 31 07:05:25 2014 UTC,"I would say that what she liked in the game were the simple puzzles that gave a sense of progression, the variety between the different stages, and mostly that the puzzles were based more on use of logical thinking than on trial-and-error.

Hilariously drunk robots dancing to funky German techno music.   Overview:   CLARC is an isometric, grid-based puzzle game with fast-paced arcade elements. It features comic style visuals in various different graphical themes, from the inside of a chaotic factory to the surface of Mars to the interior of an intruding enemy spaceship where you think, run, and fight through heaps and heaps of carefully designed puzzle and action areas.          Our hero, Clarc #37, is a simple, hard-working maintenance robot, living in a decaying nuclear missile factory. Ever since the old supercomputer has disappeared, the rest of the facility has fallen into utter chaos. The discovery that diesel has thrilling effects on robotic circuits lead to a fierce shift in priorities: Every robot has since been focusing on drinking instead of working. Everyone except Clarc. So when a less-than-peaceful spaceship enters the stage to disarm and dismantle this out-of-control doomsday device of a partying factory, Clarc is the one to save the day. He has to overcome his programming to rescue his fellow robots and, of course, his newfound friend, the lovely atomic bomb, Clara."

Some games issue a patch while others just have you redownload the whole thing, it depends on the game. I believe the GOG downloader application can alert you to updates but I don't have any reason to leave it running for that purpose so I don't know exactly how it works.  As for the Don't Starve multiplayer...we don't know yet. I would imagine the developers don't want to create a situation where you can't play with your friends so it should be safe to assume that they will be compatible.

Developers will put in special hooks in for the Steam release, and those hooks are still present in the DRM-free release. The game will blast out these hooks but if Steam isn't running on your system then nothing happens. But if Steam is running then Steam will catch the hooks and throw the overlay on it. If you also own the game on Steam (like from Humble) then you can even earn achievements and such this way, without the game ever being installed through Steam.  Don't know how to stop it other than to close Steam before playing."

Indie games are always throwing something interesting into the mixed bag that is gaming. Untried concepts that would seem like a risk to the big AAA publishers (whose games tend to have budgets that require scientific notation) are brought to life. Concepts such as an alternative version of Texas, or an 8-bit open world romp through the video game memories of yesteryear have all been brought to us by indie games with all the attention to detail and love of the craft that an indie developer can provide.   Let's check out what we we've got in our own trail mix of indies in the IndieMix Promo!   Are you an explorer? Does the thought of making your own map using triangulation, yes, actual triangulation!, get you all excited? Then book a ticket to Miasmata for only $2.99! After being stranded on an unknown island, you must search the island for the cure to your own illness. Be careful as you are not alone!   Some RPGs will have you rolling your party for hours on end before you can even set one foot out the door. While that can be fun, sometimes it's easier to create party members on the fly, so to speak. Create your own party members using your very will--a single hulking behemoth or a herd of rapid-sting scorpions--in the world of Geneforge 1-5 Yours for only $3.74!   Fiending for a bit of the old ultra-violence? Are you done with being the nice guy, the so-called Chosen One, and saving princesses? Yeah, so are we! That's why we took a drive down to the Sunshine State and signed Hotline Miami for those of you who cried out ""No more Mr. Nice Guy!"" Snatch it now for $2.49!

Not to say I didn't enjoy; I have 6 level 70 characters and still plan on getting the last class(barbarian) to 70. It's just that even with the new adventure mode there is only so much you can do at max level. I guess character development is more interesting to me than loot and Paragon levels doesn't quite fill that need for me.

gog,246ysc,aNonSapient,4,Mon Apr 28 16:29:28 2014 UTC,"On a separate note, until now I have had difficulty doing these in-depth character creation areas. Can you give me some advice on this matter?"
gog,246ysc,ThorThunderfist,8,Mon Apr 28 16:39:35 2014 UTC,"Edited to make a bit more sense.  I blame my kids for screaming mid-typing the first time through.  This is a very basic guide.  It won't make an uber character, but it should produce a pretty simple character for you to play and enjoy the game with.  If you've never played an Infinity Engine game before I recommend starting off as a fighter (Human Dwarf or Half-orc).  They have the most hit points and the least special abilities to keep track of.  You'll want a well-rounded party, but that can wait until after the tutorial area.  For a fighter you care about 3 stats.  Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution.  Because this is your first time, feel free to reroll your stats a ton of times until you end up with a strength of 18, dex of 16+ and con of 16+.  You couldn't care less about int, wis, or cha.  They matter, but not to a fighter.  And in the long run you'll have other characters who have those stats.  Give you fighter some good weapon skills.  Something like swords or axes.  Daggers, quarterstaffs, and slings are for the wussy classes.  If you really love a weak weapon and want to choose them,  go for it.  There are no really bad weapon types (except short swords; seriously, don't choose short swords).  Get yourself 2 dots in the weapon(s) you want to use.    If you want to use 2-handed weapons (2-handed swords, spears, halberds, etc) get the weapon style proficiency too.  (You'll find it near the bottom of the proficiency list, next to sword and shield style and 2 weapon style.)  If you want to sword and board it don't bother with the sword and shield proficiency.  It's okay for BG1, but it gets really weak in the sequel and you'll wish you'd spent those points elsewhere.  Lastly, pick a cool name.  If you name your character Retard McMoonUnit, you'll see that name come up all the time.  It'll be funny for five minutes, but for the rest of the ninety to hundred fifty hours you play the game it'll get really old.  The tutorial people do a decent job of telling you most of what to do.  After that, try to build a well-balanced party.  At least one wizard, one thief, and one cleric is recommended."
gog,246ysc,ThorThunderfist,3,Mon Apr 28 18:10:43 2014 UTC,This is awesome thanks!
gog,246ysc,ThorThunderfist,3,Mon Apr 28 18:22:22 2014 UTC,I'm sorry I'm not quite certain what you are asking.
gog,246ysc,ch4os1337,4,Mon Apr 28 18:02:52 2014 UTC,This part. I would like some advice in creating a character because I am currently feeling overwhelmed with the amount of details to consider  edit: that's a random screenshot i found on google images
gog,246ysc,ch4os1337,3,Mon Apr 28 18:12:14 2014 UTC,"Gotcha.  In BG1 ranged attacks are king.  ESPECIALLY when you get exploding arrows.  So for ease of play on your first venture, I would recommend a Fighter,Ranger,Paladin or Fighter/Thief.  The extra hitpoints are crucial.  For Baldur's Gate 2,  ranged attacks are far less powerful due to the prevalence of a few spells.  Magic is King, if you have enough spells per day and have bought a magic license to cast spells in Athkatla.  In terms of power gaming, charisma, wisdom, and intelligence have very little effect in the game unless you are a Cleric, Mage/Sorceror, or Bard.  Sap points from those to get your Strength/Dex/Con up.  Also Middling stats of any kind have no real bonuses.  a Constitution of 14 has very little change compared to a Constitution of 9.  This is mostly the same for all the other stats."
gog,246ysc,Twogunkid,3,Mon Apr 28 18:20:05 2014 UTC,Cool thanks! Do you think this strategy can be applied to games like fallout 1?
gog,246ysc,Twogunkid,3,Mon Apr 28 20:12:01 2014 UTC,"Definitely not!   The history of Fallout (GURPS based) and BG (2nd edition ADnD based) are what make these strategies succeed/fail.    Fallout follows a purely linear model; 7 Agility is always better than 6 agility.  In Baldur's Gate, stats between 9-15 are all almost exactly the same."

I remember watching the adventures of Kevin the Strong (a fighter) and the wonderful NPCs he recruited. (I believe their party was Xan, Imoen, Kivan, Khalid , and Jaheria)  So when I first saw Baldur's Gate on GOG I bought my own copy. I had already played through BG 1 and 2 several times. I then bought enhanced edition as well, which due to the superior interface I use (I have not bought BG2EE)  As for my favorite build (and I reroll till my eyes roll out) I love triple multiclassing.   Mods: The Ascencion mod for two is a must in fact all those mods are worth it. For BG1 if not using enhanced edition grab an interface mod."

gog,245ok0,hohnsenhoff,6,Mon Apr 28 03:14:43 2014 UTC,"Heya. Guy who played Eador Genesis here. I'd estimate that I've played about ten hours of it, and it was a fair bit ago, so I'm far from an expert.   It really reminded me of Heroes of Might and Magic, or Disciples. Same style of gameplay, as you can see in the linked trailer.   The other guy is right: the game is fucking hard. I have a behavior wherein I start new games on hard difficulty, because normally the ""standard"" or ""medium"" difficulties are hand-holdy and easy and unfulfilling. Eador Genesis is not one of those games. It's ball breakingly hard. If you lose a fight, expect to have to start the entire mission over unless you save often, because leads snowball really hard. Once you lose an army that's holding a border, it's stupidly hard to keep the AI from taking all of your under-developed territories, which then creates and insurmountable lead that culminates in you dying.   I never got too far into the campaign, so I can't really speak to the awesomeness of the story or anything, but I did appreciate the first curveball they threw my way.   I dunno. I tried to like it, but came away from it going ""eh"".   There's another game that may be relevant to your interests if you're interested in Eador Genesis, which is The Battle For Wesnoth. It's free, has a multiplayer scene (kind of), user created campaigns, deep combat, and scratches the TBS itch a bit better in my opinion."

gog,23xhbx,Wiezy_Krwi,3,Fri Apr 25 05:37:22 2014 UTC,"I mostly buy games that I used to own (or still own) to play them again on windows 7/8.  My better half also buys a lot of adventures because well, they don't really get made anymore (we have all of the recent exceptions, like a book of unwritten tales)."
gog,23xhbx,GideonLaStrange,3,Fri Apr 25 11:28:13 2014 UTC,"I kept or buy a lot of the games I played as a kid partly for the nostalgia factor, and partly because some of them really aged well and are still just genuinely enjoyable to play.  My parents were always really strict about what games I could play, and they always checked the ratings and read the reviews. So I wasn't allowed to get a lot of the games that I really wanted because of the M rating. So now I'm trying to collect all those games I never got to experience when they were new.  My wife also likes to revisit games she played as a kid. She's introduced me to a lot of games I had never even heard of but now really love. She introduced me to the Elder Scrolls via Morrowind shortly after we got engaged.  Which also brings up another reason why I buy old games. My tastes have changed as I've grown older. I used to like racing and Tony Hawk games. I don't really enjoy those anymore (except the occasional rainy day THUG2 or THAW session). I used to like RTSs, whereas now I prefer turn-based strategy games because it allows me greater freedom to do other things around the apartment while I play. I still enjoy FPSs, but now I expect them to offer me quality storytelling, puzzle elements, and player choice rather than just killing everything in every level. Simple military FPSs are not for me. I've also discovered RPGs through my wife, a genre I wouldn't have been able to properly appreciate when I was younger, and there seems to be a greater variety of older RPGs than new ones. And now I get to go back and play the games I would've played then had I the tastes I do now. I remember seeing the first Fallout games at Target and thinking, "" That looks stupid"" (I was like 10, so forgive me). Now I consider those some of the greatest games ever made. I still would've rage quit on it if I had played it as a kid though.  My wife and I have a mid-to-high end gaming computer a friend of mine built which we load up with newer, heavier games. I also have a laptop which I use for writing. But with older games that take up a megs each rather than half my hard drive, I can load my entire GOG library to my laptop and effortlessly play Fallout or Alpha Centauri or what have you anywhere."
gog,23xhbx,KhetdaNight,2,Fri Apr 25 16:36:17 2014 UTC,"Well... I was born in the 90's so I pretty much grew up with a computer as they were first beginning to grow as an industry. I played a lot of old DOS games like Doom and ROTT and eventually early Windows games. I enjoyed every game I played and would play them again. When I saw a compilation pack of the Fallout series on a local online shop several years ago, I got my saved up allowance and bought it immediately and I don't regret it at all.   I'd buy many GoG games if I had a credit card. Like SC2000, one of my favourites, or Arcanum: Of Steamworks & Magicka Obscura, another favourite. There are plenty I was never able to get as a kid but I'd buy/play old games because nostalgia, fun or simply because they were great even outdated as they are."

Its really weird when you see someone playing minecraft on youtube... descending in some randomly generated cave with those blocky textures, then you start playing Ultima Underworld and you get the exact same feeling.    I dont get the idea of liking old games just because they are old, the same way someone collect stamps or baseball cards. For me a game is an experience, and althought now we have better graphics and more ways to sell those experiences, but we also had that 20 years ago (and cheaper).    So considering that, I dont think Im skipping  on graphics or anything... Mirrors Edge gave me a really unique experience and a lot of hours of entertainment... I think those graphics and sound had a lot of weight in that. But at the same time, Fallout1 also gave me an amazing experience, with just story telling and well thought game mechanics."

I'd recommend it.  Finally, back again to ol' Blade Runner by Westwood! Definitely still one of my top 5 adventure games. Excellently put together, great fun, well-written, and shockingly replayable. Also, the graphics and gameplay have aged very well."

I picked it up from GOG during the Valentine's sale, but have yet to play it. I'm pleasantly surprised that the gameplay is pretty much the same as the Civ games, and it's really not all that dated."

I'm not capable of online payments(no credit card or such, can't afford) All I have are a few free titles and I'd love to play some of my old favourites again, if I ever won anything. Arcanum was awesome.   I think it's a good idea to make sure you already have the games before being eligible to win. Pic of collection in Imgur with account username properly visible, not blurred etc. Important info blurred as necessity requires.  Several lower priced games instead of one high priced? Might be good, especially like a few games in a genre that goes together or sequels. Mix it up now and then, say bi-monthly or whatever works best, with a high value game. Perhaps during big things like stuff worth celebrating or big sales.  Just my 2 cents on this. Congrats on growing sub, gog is a pretty awesome site.  :)"

The soundtrack is one of my top five CDs (not just video game music) of all time.  I've listened to the soundtrack way more than I played the game.  I still put it on at parties.  Rollercoaster Tycoon: Another sim game about making an amusement park.  It's awesome.

Wikipedia has some interesting info, although not exactly what you are looking for:   GOG.com (formerly Good Old Games) is a computer game sale and distribution service operated by GOG Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of CD Projekt RED based in Warsaw, Poland. GOG delivers ""classic"" video games through its DRM-free digital platform for Windows and Mac OS X. In March, 2012, it began selling more recent titles such as The Witcher 2, Alan Wake, Assassin's Creed, among many others.   There are also forums at http://www.gog.com/forum.

I also aim to finish all the challenges, which I've barely touched, before they shut down the GFWL servers in July--manageable, certainly, unless Titanfall has too much to say about it.  For GOG.com games, I've been on and off playing Dust: An Elysian Tail and Banished. I'd also like to take another crack at Divine Divinity at some point.

Shadowrun: Dragonfall, a fully-fledged expansion pack for the recent old-school RPG gem set in the legendary setting where cyberpunk meets fantasy, bringing in a whole new 12 hour-long campaign and many improvements to the gameplay, is available on GOG.com for only $14.99. The basic game, Shadowrun Returns, is available for $14.99 as well. That's 25% off for the base game for the next two weeks.  In 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they finally did, the event became known as the Dragonfall. It’s 42 years later, and a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return…  Shadowrun: Dragonfall, transports runners to the Free City of Berlin, a thrilling Shadowrun setting full of gorgeous new hi-res environments, a diverse new cast of characters, and a new soundtrack by Sam Powell, the composer of the original Sega Genesis Shadowrun game. You'll lead a small team of shadowrunners, each with their own outlook and backstory. The members of your team are designed to play unique roles during missions, and each has a distinct set of skills, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. Now, you can save your progress at any time during the game. The new save-game functionality is available in new downloads of Shadowrun Returns and through a patch for all existing copies.  If you miss the times when expansions added enough content to the game to more than make up for their price, you need to grab Shadowrun: Dragonfall, for only $14.99 on GOG.com. Don't have the base game yet? No problem! Shadowrun Returns is discounted by 25%, making it available for only $14.99 as well, until Thursday, March 13, at 5:59PM GMT."

The discussion around the region-based pricing announcement was actually pretty eye-opening for me, but I didn't really have anything to contribute to the discussion.  Also, to answer your (since edited out) question about using Reddit versus the website, I've gone a bit overboard on RSS subscriptions over the years. Left me with a few too many things to look at each day. I've found myself finally kicking my RSS habit (mostly) for checking updates on around four subreddits.

Due to issues with the site (the new geo-specific pricing structure) we are looking into spreading our focus on the topics of drm-free, old school pc-gaming (other sites offer drm-free AND old-school games and I WANT those games to be mentioned as well), and any mod updates for old game (seriously I have a legit boner for mods) as I want this community to grow from a simple rss-feed. The MAIN problem we have is low user feedback. The mod-team is working hard to add new banners, updating the mod bot (/u/matthew94 is an awesome dude for this), and in general adding a ton of new layout but without the community giving feedback it gets discouraging.        So without ANY pause GIVE FEEDBACK. Goofy, silly, serious, angry, looking for support, looking for gamer buddies, ANY FLIPPING FEEDBACK. We need to encourage the group to come in and say whats on their mind. One user by the name of /u/eelan was unsure to add but I got on his ass to give his two cents and it was FUCKING FANTASTIC.

My request from you is to add feedback and my bounty is to find someone new EACH DAY and say hello and thank them for their input. If you haven't heard from them in a while ask them how they are and what they are playing. You want better content and additions? ASK FOR IT and let EVERYONE know they are loved and welcome in.

gog,1ykpq4,eelan,5,Fri Feb 21 22:37:01 2014 UTC,"I can't comment much on the regional pricing since I am in the US and don't see it, but I know it sucks for those of you elsewhere.  Based on my limited understanding, The regions are overly broad and the whole 1 USD = 1 British Pound or 1 Euro is baffling.  You don't have to be an economist or math major to see how just about everybody outside of the US is getting soaked on these prices.  I think a lot of this has to do with learning to play by the rules of the various publishers or simply have nothing to sell.  Even small publishers are going to see there is money to be made by following the big publishers in adopting regional pricing.  When the contracts come back up for renewal, GOG either has to stand up for their principles or lose access to both new and old games.  As a publisher, if GOG doesn't want regional pricing and other digital storefronts (Steam, Origin) do, why even deal with GOG?  You will notice that Steam has recently had a steady trickle of classic games that were once only found on GOG.  It sucks for the consumers, it sucks for GOG, but in the end, the publishers make the rules.  What causes me concern is that I'm not thrilled to hear about the push for pre-orders.  I honestly don't understand why anyone would choose to pre-order a digital good since they are infinite.  I don't mind the kind I have seen from GOG in the past for those that buy in the first week or so (buy PixelJunk Monsters and get Mutant Blobs Attack free, or something similar).  What I would hate to see is ""buy ""New Shooter get exclusive Chef apron avatar clothing"" and that nonsense.  People freaked out when GOG added DLC content.  I don't like it (and wouldn't buy it until there is a complete pack), but they finally fixed the site to make it work (you used to have different boxes on your shelf for each piece of DLC, now it is all under the main game with a DLC flag in the corner).  I get that more and more games feature DLC and they wanted to make them available, but I prefer to see GOG as a place I can pick up a complete game without strings attached, like they have done with older games that have expansion packs, which are included with the base game.  One of the reasons I buy from GOG is to avoid the slimy BS sales tactics.  I appreciate what GOG has done in making classic games available to buy when nobody else would.  I'm glad to get some interesting indie titles and the potential for bigger new releases.  I am excited about this sub and those like-minded people that enjoy the types of games that GOG specializes in.  While this isn't just going to blow over, I hope that everyone is able to continue to game and have fun talking about it.  Of course I never thought I would ever buy anything from the company that did that ridiculous fake shutdown marketing stunt and here I am!  Sorry for rambling on.  My condolences to those facing regional pricing.  I hope GOG doesn't forget that people are freaking out because they really care about what they represent(ed)."

gog,1ykpq4,Matthew94,1 point,Sun Feb 23 03:44:34 2014 UTC,"You will notice that Steam has recently had a steady trickle of classic games that were once only found on GOG.    Classic games on Steam are not a new thing. For example, I bought King's Quest 1-7 on Steam before they were available on gog. When gog re-released these games, the difference was that they install dosbox for you so you can actually run old games without extra work, while Steam is just a store and only sells what the publisher gives them. But the difference was never DRM (this particular collection doesn't use Steam as DRM) or pricing (it's cheaper on Steam even with regional pricing) or transparency (Steam generally makes manuals available on the store page, on gog it's ""bonus content"" you buy with the games).  The reason to buy on gog was all the values that gog stood for, that buying these games on gog should give you a complete product was just as important as that it should be yours to keep. They've slowly been dismantling these values, but for me DRM isn't even the most important one, so little reason remains for me to buy on gog. In other words, I disagree with them saying the lack of DRM is the big feature. In reality, DRM doesn't interfere with my ability to play a game even nearly as much as the concept of pre-order DLC, and of course it also doesn't make games more expensive for me in the way that regional pricing usually does for Europeans."

gog,1yb4ns,eelan,6,Wed Feb 19 03:37:12 2014 UTC,"eelan mentioned Legend Entertainment, which immediately made me think of The Wheel of Time. It's an Unreal engine first-person not-quite-shooter set in the Wheel of Time universe. I never read the books but the game was rather interesting with tons of spells and a neat multiplayer mode where you set traps to defend your citadel.   Westwood made a great Blade Runner game. It was an adventure game with a real-time clock, like The Last Express.   They've got the Bloodrayne games, so why can't get get Nocturne? It was a huge resource hog when it came out, but it should be playable by now! A horror-themed third person shooter.  Also, it's not that unknown, but I'd love to get to play the RTS-FPS version of Battlezone again."
gog,1yb4ns,emnii,3,Wed Feb 19 03:57:05 2014 UTC,"Oh man, I remember a few of those!  As someone that HAD read some of the Wheel of Time books (before getting sick of braid-pulling and ear-boxing), it made absolutely no sense to me. I honestly think you are far better knowing none of the lore, otherwise you just wonder what, why, and how it has anything to do with the series. I do remember being quite impressed with the visuals at the time, but turning a fantasy book series into a puzzle-based FPS was just weird.  I also had Blade Runner, but I don't think I had seen the movie at the time. I am sure it would have been much more exciting to play in that world if I had more context. I do remember being awed by the fact it came on multiple CD-ROMs and having the awesome dirty future atmosphere the movie is remembered for.  I'd like to see both of these again. WoT because I'm more detached and open to the idea, and Blade Runner because I know what it's about and based on.  Not sure how those MPEG videos would look at modern resolution, though."
gog,1yb4ns,emnii,2,Wed Feb 19 04:12:16 2014 UTC,"I think that's the case for me. I knew nothing about WOT going in and enjoyed the game. I know plenty of other people read the books, and hated the game. I though that second level in Shadar Logoth where you're getting chased by smoke tentacles was very creepy and atmospheric. It left such an impression on me that I still remember it all these years later.  I've still got Blade Runner somewhere in my collection, but I've got no idea if it still runs. That thing came on so many CDs! That's another one that suffered for being too technically ambitious at the time. It was all voxels."

I never got to play the multiplayer, and it sounded amazing. I doubt it's still active anymore, sadly.   Shadar Logoth was fantastic. Great creepy atmosphere. That's the one part from the books that they really nailed."

Idk if it counts as lesser-known but I would buy it in an instant and my dad has wanted to play tie fighter again since we stopped using ms-dos.  command and conquer: any of the old ones maybe like the first decade cd-rom that they put out  any of the old need for speed games but most preferably nfs porsche unleashed  aces of the pacific  chip' challenge  oregon trail  sim ant  power pete (only game I ever played on an old mac)

gog,1yb4ns,hohnsenhoff,1 point,Wed Feb 19 06:51:16 2014 UTC,"Loved Chip's Challenge back in the day.  There is actually a remake by the original creator called Chuck's Challenge 3D for PC/Mac/Android. Unfortunately I don't care for the 3D perspective of those. The iPhone/iPad version looks like it is in the original top-down viewpoint. You can find out more here: http://www.chuckschallenge.com  There has to be some freeware versions out there. In the recesses of my mind I seem to recall a version that either had the exact same level layouts, or at least could import the original level data to play on modern hardware.  I'd also like to revisit Sim Ant now that I am older and wiser. When I originally owned it, I don't know that I really did much beyond invade rival nests and didn't see much beyond the initial scenarios."
gog,1yb4ns,StJude1,3,Thu Feb 20 01:55:07 2014 UTC,"To kick things off, I was thinking of a game I used to play way back in the day, Superhero League of Hoboken.   It is an interesting RPG/adventure hybrid filled with memorable heroes and villains doing battle in post-apocalyptic New Jersey.  The characters and plot are hilarious, and I would likely enjoy even more today since, as I said, I was young and a lot of it probably went over my head.  Still, even back then, I delighted in the absurdity of it all. It was like video game version of The Tick comic/cartoon.   Not sure where the rights are today. It was published by Legend Entertainment, which I remember was big into making games based on popular fantasy novel series.   I found a wonderful, exhaustive, article about the game at the terrific Hardcore Gaming 101 site here: http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/hoboken/hoboken.htm  Truly a under-appreciated and terrific game I would love to revisit."

gog,1y4ule,eelan,3,Mon Feb 17 10:44:25 2014 UTC,"Evil Genius looks great!  It sounds like such an obvious premise that I can only hope the devs were able to execute. It reminds me of an updated, James Bond-style Dungeon Keeper.  Curious about the updated Baldur's Gates. I was always tempted to try the mod that combines BG1+BG2 and their expansions into one mega-game, updating BG1 to use the BG2 rules and enhancements. Combined with other graphic/widescreen mods it sounds like it would be an awesome desert island experience!  For some reason I never finished the Icewind Dale games and I have been thinking about them lately. More hack & slash, but same tasty Infinity Engine!  Magrunner looks like like a neat Portal + Cthulhu mashup but I'm not sure I have UE3 horsepower under the hood."
gog,1y4ule,Tatsunen,3,Wed Feb 19 03:14:23 2014 UTC,Yeah Evil genius is great. I personally love 60's spy movie aesthetics (No One Lives Forever 1 & 2 are also all time favorites) and Dungeon Keeper style gameplay so it really appeals to me. The user interface is one area where you can see a little age but it's still more than serviceable. Very humorous and the there's little touches (like your Evil Genius personally attending the torture of top agents and the cliche top bad dudes being pitched a plan complete with table model) that just help complete the atmosphere.
gog,1y4ule,eelan,1 point,Wed Feb 19 11:57:32 2014 UTC,"The NOLF games were a blast!    I will never forget the big Scottish guy on the tricycle level. Everything about those games ooze style and there were so many little touches that made it more real. It was clearly a labor of love for the devs. So groovy.  Going to have to look into Evil Genius when I have a chance. I know my main concern was that it might get repetitive, but it sounds like it is worth playing just for the vibe."

gog,1xf5f3,Tytillean,2,Sun Feb 9 20:13:04 2014 UTC,"Yes and no.  Like, I said there are only about 7 screens worth of data.  Overview - See the galaxy and adjust funding etc. As seen by this image.  http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_RksXlvOhmqE/TJJbr891RkI/AAAAAAAAAFo/7BP_Wvgj40Y/s1600/master-of-orion-1993.jpg  Then you have each of the subscreens seen at the bottom.  The best thing to do if you buy it, is to read some guides like this one, google things you don't get and prepare to lose a lot. You just gotta play to learn.  After writing and erasing paragraphs I have this to say, there are a small amount of controls so it's not hard to play but time and allocation of resources is so crucial you could go on all day about how to play. Hell, that tutorial I linked you is about 35 pages long and that's to win a battle on normal following that person's instructions.  One example of resources is ships, researching an upgrade doesn't do anything straight away. You have to design a new ship to make use of it. The catch? Well, you can only have 6 ship designs and if you go over you limit you need to scrap a design, and destroy all ships of that type in play. You do get 0.25-0.5 of the value back, but it's an important decision.  Keep pushing on with a weak fleet or scrap it, power up and come back later with a much more powerful one? It's a big decision, in that time they could have researched new defences or someone new might declare war on you. That's just a few turns of decision.  When I play it more I might do a full writeup as you could write a book on the various possibilities, the game is pretty reactive to what you do."

I haven't been able to get it to install well the last few operating systems.  When it came out on GOG, I was super excited. Now I play it from time to time.

Essentially all you're doing is uploading a sprite sheet image (assuming you're doing images) to Reddit and altering the subreddit's CSS to accommodate it. Text or image flair doesn't matter. If you know CSS, you'll be fine.  As for what to put as flair in this subreddit, I think getting a list of popular games and turning them into flair would be a good start. Maybe get the thumbnails of the boxes from GOG? For example: http://static.gog.com/upload/images/2012/02/c640c4bcc71f765ba0ad5ebdf4567bd3c2b458f9.jpg , except it would have to be resized down a little so it's not a big bulky thing on everyone's posts."

There's not much point talking about our DRM-Free Time Machine sale here, as it's already ended. We know you liked it, it was lots of fun, and we'll probably re-visit this idea in the future, but let's move on to more current things. There are two things in particular we'd like to mention. First, is the new Official GOG.com Blog on Tumblr, that we've launched just this week. We hope to make it a place offering a different perspective on the games from our catalog, GOG.com and its team, and gaming in general. If you happen to own a Tumblr account and you would like to give us some help with spreading the news about the blog's recent launch, you can do so by re-blogging this post. Or any other post, for that matter. It will be greatly appreciated if you do.  The other thing is even more exciting, especially if you're a music aficionado. Over 30 FLAC-encoded lossless soundtrack have been just added as bonus content to our games, and you can grab them alongside their respective games. If you already own one of these games, a FLAC soundtrack (or soundtrack) is now available for you to download. If not, you can some high-quality game music right now, for as little as $5.99.  Here's the full list of all 31 FLAC soundtracks. Note, that in some cases there will be more than one added to the same game+goodies package, so keep an eye out for the most attractive deals!  Another World  Battle Realms  Chaos Overlords  Crusaders of Might & Magic  Darklands (Roland MT-32, SoundBlaster16 OPL3, and the SoundBlaster OPL2 versions included!--see credits below)  Desperados Dead or Alive  Disciples: Sacred Lands Gold and Disciples 2 Gold  Earthworm Jim 1 and Earthworm Jim 2  Heroes of Might and Magic II, Heroes of Might and Magic IV, Heroes of Might and Magic V, Heroes of Might and Magic V - Hammers of Fate, and Heroes of Might and Magic V - Tribes of the East  Imperialism and Imperialism II  Jade Empire  King of Dragon Pass  KKND Xtreme  MDK 2  Might & Magic 6, Might & Magic 7, Might & Magic 8, and Might & Magic 9  Mob Rule  Neverwinter Nights 2(original soundtrack from the base game)  Shadow Warrior Classic Complete  The Witcher (both soundtracks: music from, and inspired by the game) and The Witcher 2  Wizardry 8  We’d like to thank Stefan_L. for providing us with the enhanced Darklands soundtrack. Also, special thanks go to Thiev and Judas Iscariot, two members of the jolly GOG.com crew, who went above and beyond their usual duties to procure all that lossless musical goodness and make it available for your listening pleasure.  That's it. Thank you for your time, have a nice weekend and remember about our Wargaming Promo.  Edit: This Week on GOG returns! Well, at least in some form it does. Here's the first ever ""The week on GOG"" post on our blog. It contains the summary of all this week's releases, the weekend promo info, and--yes!--the Enigmatic Hint for the upcoming GOG.com release! We hope you'll enjoy it!"

Sadly I just stick with the list view with new items at the top.  Maybe if you could organize while in the list view it would be easier. Now that I think about it, I wonder if I could just zoom out on the shelf in the browser to drag them easier.  And I realize this does nothing to create separate groupings, but even a blank spacer would help.   I guess I shouldn't be too upset about having too many games to comfortably organize!"

There was actually a big huff on Reddit about it because EA made up excuses why it needed to be online, but it actually ended up being unhelpful in the ways they said it would be helpful and was still just thinly veiled DRM."
gog,1uqbu0,hohnsenhoff,1 point,Sat Jan 11 07:44:20 2014 UTC,Would you mind adding some of your favorite games/genres? Even add some random quirks you like in games. Would be easier to recommend a title. Thanks!
gog,1uqbu0,hohnsenhoff,2,Wed Jan 8 19:21:07 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the remark,I already added it to the edit :)"
gog,1uqbu0,disso,1 point,Wed Jan 8 19:26:09 2014 UTC,OH! Settlers 2 I believe? It seems to fit that kind of art style -> http://www.gog.com/game/the_settlers_2_10th_anniversary
gog,1uc46y,hohnsenhoff,2,Fri Jan 3 20:27:08 2014 UTC,Rather tempted to rebuy these but I have them all on disc and barely played them due to a steam backlog.

gog,1uabdv,hohnsenhoff,1 point,Fri Jan 3 04:08:43 2014 UTC,How do you all feel about this?
gog,1uabdv,eelan,3,Fri Jan 3 04:08:54 2014 UTC,"Having never heard of Curse, I wasn't sure what to expect, but from the info posted it sounds more like marketing to current Curse subscribers.  As long as it doesn't change GOG beyond growing the user base I don't think it will have much effect on me personally."
gog,1uabdv,nbcaffeine,2,Fri Jan 3 09:14:06 2014 UTC,"Well, having a curse sub (premium, for some reason. I wrote a WoW addon when I played and hosted it on Curse, guessing that's why), free game, cool.  I don't really know most of these games, I do own darwinia already. Any suggestions for someone who primarily plays RPGs?  Edit: Far as partnership, think they are just getting paid by Curse for promotion of Curse's premium offerings, not like equity buyout or anything."
gog,1uabdv,einexile,1 point,Fri Jan 3 06:42:06 2014 UTC,I was sort of hoping Curse was planning a Raptr style hub that would work with our GOG collections. (And hopefully not be a resource hog and constantly scan all of our game folders.)  Guess not. This is about as much of a partnership as they've got with any customer who does a giveaway on their forums.
gog,1uabdv,einexile,1 point,Fri Jan 3 16:04:06 2014 UTC,"This was the first I have heard of that service, for those that have not heard of it these are two links that helped me   Wikipedia Article Official Website   Have you used this site before?"
gog,1uabdv,Wiki_FirstPara_bot,2,Fri Jan 3 18:39:57 2014 UTC,"I used it for a while and it's fun, but I repeatedly watched as it scanned the entire folders of games for which it's only supposed to track usage. This included Steam games, which it's supposed to track by watching your profile. Probably harmless, but obnoxious and a resource annoyance.  It seems to rely mainly on promotions involving special bling for free-to-play games, for example a vanity pet for Rift. Actually they were also giving away the Rift expansion as a reward last year. Sometimes the notifications for this can be a little repetitive, though they aren't intrusive.  It follows your play time in certain games and gives it a progress bar, and it also tracks achievements. What it won't do is watch most games you play outside of a launcher. It also doesn't work with Origin or the Blizzard launcher. There's an option to enter your usage manually, but it's limited to 6 hours even though using it disables any rewards associated with the game. What's the point of adding something like Anarchy Online and saying I've played it for 6 hours?  I've been hoping for something more like Xfire but with a genuine social aspect. (Maybe I should just take another look at Xfire as it's been a good long while.) To Raptr's credit the discussions seem to be free of censorship. The Shadowbane discussions are full of emulator talk, for example, since the game has been officially shut down. I haven't seen outright abusive posts anywhere, so that's probably not allowed.  In any case, it's not all bad and I'm giving it another try. It's just not everything it could be and frankly it strikes me as a little sleazy, but then so do most things these days."
gog,1u5pr7,hohnsenhoff,1 point,Wed Jan 1 14:27:40 2014 UTC,Thanks for submitting this!
gog,1u5pr7,terp02andrew,1 point,Fri Jan 3 07:55:24 2014 UTC,"Yeah I just checked my library (made my account on Dec 12th for the promo), and the games are still there. I'll be downloading all the files tonight/tomorrow though just in case."
gog,1u4ov2,flearghnflarblar,3,Wed Jan 1 00:54:02 2014 UTC,For what reason are you posting this on here?
gog,1u4ov2,hohnsenhoff,0,Wed Jan 1 23:44:40 2014 UTC,"I'm posting it because GoG.com is one of my favorite DRM-free game sellers and Steam alternatives. Steam is a major PC gaming ""platform""--today, probably the best known--but its TOS and customer support are questionable.  This and other recent experiences have motivated me to purchase more from GoG.com and other reputable sellers, in spite of their lesser popularity (compared to Steam). Steam users who have watched both services' winter sales may feel similarly, if stories like these don't get buried by diehard fanboys (as they do in Steam's own forums, and in the /r/Steam subreddit)."
gog,1u4ov2,hohnsenhoff,1 point,Thu Jan 2 00:20:04 2014 UTC,"No problem mate, I just ask you to add this explanation next time so we have some context. Thanks and hope to see you around more :-)"
