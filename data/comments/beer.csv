They have been with Odell for a collective 52 years. The Odells will retain 10 percent each as a family legacy, Wynne Odell said in an interview.

beer,3e3qmx,HiimCaysE,5,Tue Jul 21 18:52:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know that having some verbiage to offer necessarily equates to a more meaningful rating, but I can see how cutting out those with less would definitely discard a lot of careless and casual ones, even if some baby goes out with that bathwater. I guess they want ratings that are more considered and well thought out. These changes from time to time, technical ones based on philosophical ones, do make the overall rankings seem kind of arbitrary, or at least sort of loose. Maybe they make another change six months from now and the whole thing reorders again. I guess you always take these things with a grain of salt and make sure you understand the methodology and take it into context when placing any significance on a given ranking. Just another reason not to see ratings as the gospel.  I do think it's good that people shouldn't feel pressured or forced to write something if they really use the site more for their own tracking purposes than to contribute to the community.  Edit - I still think this verbiage threshold may introduce some undue influence from really buzzy/hyped beers. When you've finally tracked down a really hyped beer, you're excited to try it, excited to share your experience with the community, and more likely to have more to say about it. If on the other hand you finally make your way around to trying a beer that's been there for 20 years, which is long past any hype stage, it may seem more routine and maybe you don't have as much to say about it even if you've rated it as objectively as any other beer. So in that way maybe your review of the hyped beer winds up counting while your review of the shelf standard winds up not counting. That would seem to contribute to the undue influence of hype. There's no perfect system, I know, and this isn't really criticism so much as thinking out loud."
beer,3e3qmx,turkeypants,2,Tue Jul 21 19:28:35 2015 UTC,"This seems silly.  The number rating has nothing to do with the description.  Is there really anything to indicate that someone who wrote out paragraphs of description has a more valid opinion on the beer than someone who only put in a quick blurb of tasting notes or even someone who simply rated the beer without feeling the need to take the time to write a review?    Do they just want to encourage people to write longer reviews?  Kinda seems like it from the post  If so this seems like a very heavy handed way of doing it.    Also the fact that, as they pointed out, some beers and places that previously had average scores won't now due to no qualifying reviews seems very counterproductive.  I'm pretty sure most of my local breweries won't qualify for a score anymore.  If I'm just trying to figure out at a quick glance what breweries and beers are worth checking out in an area I'm visiting, I'm much more interested in an overall average score than I am whether or not some person I don't know thought the aroma of their IPA reminded them of sipping a glass of grapefruit juice on a freshly cut lawn.  For that matter, when I do read reviews I much prefer short and to the point than some of the crazy crap I see on BA."

A few I would suggest:  Stone (Escondido) - the biggest, and the most beautiful grounds.  Also the most crowded, probably.  Riptide (San Marcos) - industrial taproom, great beers.  Port Brewing/Lost Abbey (San Marcos) - really friendly folks, great beers.  Mother Earth (Vista) - homey downtown taproom.  Prohibition (Vista) - great local brewpub, try the SBA and the burgers.  Iron Fist (Carlsbad) - my personal favorite, sweet Belgians.  There are lots of others.  Indian Joe, Belching Beaver, Societe, Karl Strauss, and probably a dozen new ones I haven't even been to yet.

Why? Cause it cost about $1 or less a beer. Cause they are easy to drink. After I drink them I don't feel like I need something else to drink.   My untappd log shows about 100 different beers. Last one I enjoyed was Q.Cumber by Jailbreak. I felt like I needed something else to drink after that. Jailbreak beer goes for about $11-13 per 6-pk. So about $2 a beer.  I will not sink so low as to buy a case of Natty Boh though.   Just my opinion."

There are some more subtle things Budweiser can do to pull at strong craft beer fans, but they know that videos and photos and taglines aren't going to accomplish it.   I would argue, though, that the commercials are aimed at two types of people - Budweiser advocates (give them ammo against craft nerds) and 18-21 year old peer-pressure-prone drinkers who are forming their lifelong habits - ""If your friends are telling you to drink ""better"" beer, they're being snobby and undesirable. They don't want you to have fun, they want you to be nerdy. This isn't lecture hall, it's ok to just have fun."""

beer,3dy859,foamy2001,5,Mon Jul 20 17:33:01 2015 UTC,"Budweiser ALWAYS has a good Super Bowl ad.  But seeing a cute puppy and a horse doesn't make me run out and buy their product.  I go okay cool, a golden retriever that looks like my dog when he was little.  How adorable.  Someone pass that Stone Ruination, please.  I used to work in advertising.  And while they do big commercials that generate talk, the way I see it is they do it to keep up that repertoire.  I don't know their numbers, but I would be interested to see how many new customers it generates them.  They are advertising an ""age old"" product, that people know if they want or not.  And for them, that's what keeps their business alive.  My uncle is a Budweiser drinker.  Always has been and always will be.  But for me or other people who enjoy different types of beer that commercial is nothing more than entertainment.    I look at Budweiser the same way I look at places like In N Out.  They stick to what they know and it works for them.  I guarantee Budweiser could pull advertising for a year and see a very small drop in sales."
beer,3dy859,rachel_soup,8,Mon Jul 20 17:39:13 2015 UTC,These sorts of ads aren't for new customers. Its to keep their brand ingrained in the general fabric of society. Same reason why Coke advertised with Normal Rockwell-esque paintings of Santa Claus. When your general person thinks of a soda in the US they think of Coke. When your general person thinks of a beer in the US they think of Budweiser. That's a very valuable thing from a branding perspective and maintaining it takes a particular kind of advertising campaign.
beer,3dy859,UncleMeat,4,Mon Jul 20 18:17:41 2015 UTC,"Guess so, I just don't know if their core audience talks about it or approves of it, so I can't say if it's really effective in either maintaining or building their brand.  Comcast has us all talking too, etc"

beer,3dy859,Cycloptichorn,5,Mon Jul 20 19:55:12 2015 UTC,"For me personally, I just found it funny. I would say they increased their brand equity with me a little bit just by making me smile. Subtly, I'm probably more likely to pay the extra dollar or two to buy a case of Budweiser over a competitor like PBR when I'm in the mood for light beer because of their ads that lift my mood slightly. Again, subtly, but that's the point of the ad.  I love craft beers (which is why I subscribe here), but I also love to drink Budweiser at social settings - I don't think the two are mutually exclusive. I hate that they try to draw a line in the sand between the two, but come on - that ad is pretty clever."
beer,3dy859,WeenisWrinkle,2,Mon Jul 20 17:40:38 2015 UTC,Agreed.   Sounds more like something your buddy would give you shit about than something an advertiser would try to sell you with.   I like it and don't feel the need to take it seriously.

beer,3dy859,ALLthepoops,5,Mon Jul 20 16:32:07 2015 UTC,"Two different audiences, so they would do better advertising through different means for each. I think craft beers typically advertise by word of mouth, social media, and interviews or stories in beer publications and podcasts. Much fewer television advertising for even the biggest craft brands like Sierra nevada, lagunitas, stone, new Belgium, Boston beer co,  etc.   I did read a nice article about the experimental brewery within Budweiser, I forgot the magazine. I can't figure that one out though. Because they are trashing craft beer so loudly, it will be hard to forget such negativity even when reading about the positive, crafty, things they do behind the scenes."
beer,3dy859,na_cho_cheez,2,Mon Jul 20 18:08:04 2015 UTC,"Because some people see this commercials and either think ""Hell yeah I drink Budweiser and that makes me a real drinker, not a weird craft drinking hipster""   Anyone that angry about this is probably not drinking Goose Island at this point either.

Judging by the ongoing popularity of BCBS/variants, and how often I see people on here wax philosophical about how they ""only care about whether or not the beer is good"" and not who makes it, they seem to be right. Pathetic."

It wants to control the industry if possible, and contain it if not. Supporting them means supporting their ongoing efforts to obstruct, disrupt, and otherwise derail actual craft breweries.  That said, I do think you ought to have enough pride not to tithe to the guy spitting in your face."

Their product is:   Cheap Consistent Light At least tolerated by the vast majority of people   What exactly is so egregious about pointing that out? You might think those are shitty reasons to buy beer, but at least they're being honest about their products. As someone who enjoys both ends of the spectrum, I have been accosted far more for having a Bud Light in my hand than a local craft brew."
beer,3dy859,js155306,12,Mon Jul 20 17:00:24 2015 UTC,"I've always had a thought in my head that if a craft brewery like Stone or Founders took the Budweiser recipe and copied it, ingredient-for-ingredient, and released it under some crafty-sounding name like ""Day Drinker: American Rice Lager"" or something of that nature, that it would be given rave reviews for its refreshing crispness and easy drinkability on a hot summer day.   A lot of beer geeks tend to judge a beer's quality based on who brewed it. Before even taking the first sniff or sip, a lot of us already have our minds made up.   I'm guilty of it, too - I've misjudged beers because I thought they were nothing more than craft-bait by a macro brewer, and while technically correct (Some of shock-top brews, Michelob Winter's Bourbon Cask Ale,  some of the Big Eddy stuff, etc.) if you look past the, you'll find some beers that may or may not be your style, but you can tell that someone who enjoys the art of brewing has definitely put some thought behind it."

First, to what ""marketing campaigns"" from craft breweries are you referring? There are maybe a dozen craft breweries that have national marketing campaigns, and there are no craft breweries which have marketing campaigns in the same way the macros do.   Second, how many craft breweries can you name which market their beer by attacking the macros? Stone's ""fizzy yellow beer"" line is pretty much the only one that would qualify. When craft breweries actually have real marketing, it's pretty much always built around advertising how good their products are, not how bad the macros' products are."

We shouldn't forget that Budweiser is one of the greatest marketers in the world. They know their target audience better than we know ourselves. They didn't become the largest beer brand in the world by luck.
beer,3dy859,PhiladelphiaIrish,2,Mon Jul 20 15:43:23 2015 UTC,"Not to mention that fact that this is targeted at regular drinkers of Miller and Coors. This ad tells them what they want to hear, but from the Budweiser brand, which positions itself as a leader in the effort to defend what they like to drink. Regular Bud drinkers are a given, they get reinforced loyalty to their brand and their macro beer, while encouraging a bit of derision amongst their peers for straying (which I find unpleasant, but it probably works). And finally while the ad's a turnoff for many, there are certainly a few regular craft drinkers who had Budweiser in their mind next time they went for a cheap beer."
beer,3dy859,Atomic_Skull,5,Tue Jul 21 12:17:47 2015 UTC,"We ""don't understand"" because, get this, it might just be a completely terrible and ineffective marketing strategy in the long-term. Whenever a company does some incomprehensible end-run like this, there's always some contingent of people who want to say that it's some sort of genius. But really, they didn't lose market share in the first place out of their competitors' luck.  Budweiser as a brand, even within AB, is more expensive than Bud Light, has less alcohol than Bud Platinum, and doesn't taste as good as any of their premium brands. Budweiser is losing sales because its primary market, stubborn brand-loyalist middle-aged men, is rapidly aging and people in general drink less as they age. Yes, this is who Budweiser is intending these ads for, but that doesn't mean they aren't throwing good money after bad trying to keep them. It also doesn't mean they aren't necessarily hurting their other brands with these ads."

The market for this product isn't moving to craft beer, they're just getting old. New customers have already been supplanted by craft beer and won't be attracted by these ads. Nothing about the product has value for them.  Large companies like this can, in fact, do wrong with their marketing. In the long run, they'd be better served by scaling down Budweiser and shifting resources to their successful brands than trying this ""proudly macro"" thing that doesn't seem to be doing much except making them look a little foolish."

beer,3dy859,supaphly42,49,Mon Jul 20 16:08:17 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. Honestly, most macro beer isn't even bad, it's just bland. What little flavor is has is usually just a mild sweetness.  I mean I don't love it, but I also don't hate it. I just don't really buy it."
beer,3dy859,chrwei,25,Mon Jul 20 16:45:12 2015 UTC,"Surprised I had to scroll this far down to find this. Why do they mock craft beer and drinkers? Because craft beer and drinkers mock them relentlessly.   And like the guy below said, they produce a light flavored beer, but their actual quality is second to none. You can grab any two cans from any of their breweries, and they will be identical."
beer,3dy859,kilmore_trout,45,Mon Jul 20 17:58:17 2015 UTC,"Because they have always been a bully.  in St Louis there was one festival that AB said they'd pull their sponsorship (they were the lead sponsor) if Schlafly was allowed as a minor sponsor (there were many minor sponsors, none were beer but some were alcohol, and multiples of several product categories).  the only beer allowed to be sold at the festival were AB products.  beer the was the only product with this limitation.    for reference, Schlafly's annual production was what AB made at the St Louis location in a couple minutes or something.  not exactly formidable competition.  AB's just a bully."
beer,3dy859,chrwei,52,Mon Jul 20 15:09:20 2015 UTC,I grew us in STL and I've seen this first hand. A kid I went to HS with has made it far in the AB hierarchy and he throws shit fits if you bring any non-Bud beer to any picnic or party. I've seen him try to make people leave public parks if they bring craft anything.

The guy I know is a business development and sales guy and gets pretty ridiculous company perks (watch the super bowl from the field, etc). Maybe if you work at the brewery it's different? Lots of the hockey dads I knew worked downtown at the brewery and they seemed to be more beer lovers than company loyalists, but then again, they aren't in a position to launch attacks either."
beer,3dy859,Cycloptichorn,7,Mon Jul 20 15:46:18 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. I worked with a lot of AB employees - brewery staff and office workers - in a past life, and many if not all of them are not straight company loyalists. They drink local, craft beer as well as their own beer (it doesn't hurt that you get free AB beer each month as a job perk). Many of the brewers home brew, and since not everyone stays there for life, a few are friends with craft brewers."

I used to have a good friend who is an AB rep.  He tried to pull the same shit when he saw people drinking anything but Bud or one of their products.  Kept it up for a few years until some of us rounded on him and told him he could shut the fuck up or stop getting invited to parties.

Caused a scene at one party (after drinking like 10 bud lights, yeargh) and essentially did stop getting invited, though he did back off on it.    Guess the damage was done.  People don't like having their beer insulted."
beer,3dy859,Cycloptichorn,15,Mon Jul 20 15:58:57 2015 UTC,Ten bud lights.. So like 3 IPA's. :D

Maybe it's that they've been at it for triple the time by that point, I dunno, but it's always been my friends who drink piss beer who get the most wrecked."
beer,3dy859,oricthedamned,13,Mon Jul 20 16:08:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I thinks its the sheer volume mixed with the mental thought of 'I'm on beer 8, whoa!'."

beer,3dy859,mrmonopoly25,3,Mon Jul 20 16:44:26 2015 UTC,"I hear you, but I was going with craft IPAs that are familiar to most people - Dogfish 60 minute (6.0%), Lagunitas IPA (6.2%), Sierra Nevada Hop Hunter (6.2%) are all in that range. Again - I'd need my math checked out, but I think you could still drink 10 Buds and be drunker than if you drank 3 Two Hearted, Union Jack or Sculpin (or even things in the 8% range)."

beer,3dy859,1iI1iI1iI1iI,4,Mon Jul 20 16:28:57 2015 UTC,For instance if there is some kind of event happening (AB sponsored or not) he starts by complaining about them to the organizers (these people are making a ruckus/drunk and angry etc) while asking them to take their coolers back to their cars. He continues to make annoying comments about their presumed lifestyles (based on craft beer drinking). It's really sad but it did remind me of these recent commercials.
beer,3dy859,chrwei,2,Mon Jul 20 16:43:34 2015 UTC,"Why are people listening to some random asshat? If it's not AB sponsored and he has no authority, tell him to fuck off and drink whatever you want.  Maybe I'm misreading something here."
beer,3dy859,UncharminglyWitty,5,Mon Jul 20 16:51:47 2015 UTC,How is that bullying? That's simply image and marketing management. You act as if they're required to give sponsorship money. If you're upset with anyone it should be the event holders as they allowed themselves to be manipulated and sold out.
beer,3dy859,chrwei,2,Mon Jul 20 15:45:17 2015 UTC,"it's still strong arming, aka bullying, the event organizers. if AB were running the event I might feel different, but they were not.  FWIW, AB is no longer a sponsor of this event, and most of the local craft breweries are.  AB is still a vendor there though.  I'm not sure if this is due to the inbev sale and the changes that drove or if it was the organizers choice."

beer,3dy859,JimmyHavok,2,Mon Jul 20 17:11:12 2015 UTC,"AB said they'd pull their sponsorship...if Schlafly was allowed as a minor sponsor   That's entirely reasonable.   The point of sponsorship is to promote your brand.  Honestly, it's a pretty rookie move of the organizers to even try to bring in another brewery.  Maybe if they had only small local or even regional breweries, they could get more than one, but when you have a large national brand, you better believe they're going to want exclusive rights."
beer,3dy859,ProjektTHOR,44,Mon Jul 20 17:00:48 2015 UTC,Because you all keep talking about it and giving them clicks and page views.

But, one thing you can not knock them for is their brewing technique. The insane amount of beer they brew and the consistency they get is rather insane, if the beat large craft breweries like Sierra Nevada and Sam Adams don't brew with same kind of quality control and consistency as Budweiser. As much as I hate them I really do admire the Brewers that's work there."
beer,3dy859,mikelj,10,Mon Jul 20 17:09:10 2015 UTC,I agree with you. Even the bigger craft brewers deal with at most 2 brewing locations and have problems with the inconsistency in brewing between 2 locations. AB does this at 18 massive locations with millions of dollars of product on the line if something goes wrong. You have to give them credit where credit it due. The taste of the beer may not be everyone's favorite but their   QA process is on point.
beer,3dy859,ClintFuckingEastwood,4,Mon Jul 20 19:57:43 2015 UTC,"Whats also impressive is the ability to make such a consistent brew with a lager, the beer variety with the least places to hide your mistakes, one off flavour would stick out like a sore thumb!"
beer,3dy859,ksye,32,Mon Jul 20 21:12:05 2015 UTC,It's really not easier to make a lager than some overhopped IPA.
beer,3dy859,jaketothemax1000,21,Mon Jul 20 16:15:46 2015 UTC,"Also, it's not really like they can change the recipe. They've been making Budweiser the same way for over a century."
beer,3dy859,ksye,3,Mon Jul 20 16:23:27 2015 UTC,"Imho, they could make better beer easy, and maybe more consistently then small brewery. But the price range would change.  Ab-ambev is already purchasing many traditional craft breweries in brazil, and they do not change recipies.   Their focus is large volume for ""casual""  drinkers"
beer,3dy859,z64dan,2,Mon Jul 20 16:27:25 2015 UTC,"This is what is so overlooked in this sub. This is such a small subset of the beer buying market. It's not a good example of the market, even among craft beer drinkers. I love beer, I homebrew, I seek out new and interesting varieties of beer. However, I buy way more Bud Heavy and PBR than anything else because it's affordable, it tastes good, and it's easy to drink a lot of. It's as if I have to stop going to Waffle House and Taco Bell because I like going to nice restaurants. This sub can be frustrating."

beer,3dy859,TheReverendBill,5,Mon Jul 20 15:23:34 2015 UTC,"Correct. People miss this constantly. ""Budweiser"" and the team that works on ""Budweiser"" advertising don't own craft breweries or take direction from the AB-InBev Craft Division. They operate totally separately. I would be surprised if everybody working on the Budweiser brand (internally or at their marketing agencies) even knows that their parent company owns Goose Island. Budweiser the brand is not AB-InBev.   Budweiser's advertising route isn't contradictory to AB-InBev's purchase of craft brands. Budweiser is saddled with increasing their market share. To do that, they reaffirm to their core audience that you don't need to be a snob about your drinks. And if they insult a couple people on the edge, and it resonates with them... huge win. Craft beer drinkers put social pressure on friends to drink ""better"" beer and Budweiser's job is to let them know that it's ok to drink what you know and have a great time.   Even at the internal level, you don't think the ""Bud Team"" wants to shove a report in the face of the ""Craft Team"" that shows macro market share up?"
beer,3dy859,dvdanny,5,Mon Jul 20 15:59:42 2015 UTC,"People say this, but it's not like the parent company don't have a say in the direction that the brands go in."
beer,3dy859,NashBiker,12,Mon Jul 20 15:50:31 2015 UTC,"Yet Budweiser commercials do not represent the entirety of AB-InBev's marketing strategy. It would be incredibly dumb of them to try to market Bud Light Lime and their ""crafty"" brands in the same way to the same demographic."
beer,3dy859,trench_welfare,6,Mon Jul 20 15:58:39 2015 UTC,"Coca Cola Classic and Diet Coke for a famous example have entirely different marketing departments, one has very little influence on the other.  The portion of AB-Inbev that is buying craft companies probably has very little influence over AB's Bud/budlight marketing.  Regular Bud makes a TON of money, any parent company would be wise the let them do their thing."
beer,3dy859,thatguyworks,3,Mon Jul 20 17:45:11 2015 UTC,it's not like the parent company don't have a say in the direction that the brands go in.   That's exactly how you ruin the company you just bought.  Just let them do their thing.
beer,3dy859,UncharminglyWitty,2,Mon Jul 20 17:43:55 2015 UTC,"no, they buy semi successful craft breweries and drive down the cost and quality so they can elbow their way up the volume chain and choke out independent competition. this is why every time you buy a 10 barrel, goose island, kona, long hammer, widmer or elysian, you're contributing to AB-INBEVs corporate strategy to force you back to cheap swill."

beer,3e35lp,turkeypants,4,Tue Jul 21 17:04:36 2015 UTC,"I think you're getting downvoted because no one knows exactly how to help you.  You really like Heineken, which is a purposely skunked beer, and are afraid of getting a 6-pack of Yuengling, which is a fairly innocuous American beer.  There's nothing wrong with getting drunk on good beer, I do it all the time, but you haven't suggested anything that you would be interested in drinking ""good"" beer, especially since you're not too adventurous when drinking.  My advice is to just go for the Yuengling, cause it's pretty good for what it is. Maybe give Sam Adams Boston Lager a shot, which will have a little more bitterness and character than Yuengling, but is still fairly easy to drink. Same goes for Brooklyn Lager.   As for Stella, you'll find it very similar to Heineken, so it won't really bring the change-up you're looking for."

beer,3e07g3,Neurophil,6,Mon Jul 20 23:14:09 2015 UTC,"Stone's Just Delicious IPA is treated with Clarity Ferm, a protease which breaks down gluten. It can't technically be labeled gluten-free, but laboratory tests (which Stone publishes here) consistently place it below the threshold for GF-10 products (which most people which Celiac can consume without issue). It's a great beer, and lots of people with gluten sensitivity find they can drink it.  There will probably be more and more beers that use Clarity Ferm in the next few years. You could also take up homebrewing, since it's available for homebrew use and you could hypothetically use it to make any beer in any style gluten-free. I have a friend with Celiac who does this and has good results. You can get home gluten tests here, but they're a bit expensive. She uses them on occasion with high-gravity beers, but generally just starts with a small glass, waits to see if she has any reaction, and if not goes from there."

Once in a while I'll check to see what beers are recommended based on my Untappd check-ins. If I'm at a bar I'll ask the bartender what's new or interesting. I talk to my friends about what they've drank recently. Beer festivals.   Oh, and most importantly, when I walk into my bottle shop and talk to the owner about what new or otherwise interesting is in. That's how I buy most of my beer anyways, at my local bottle shop. If it sounds interesting and i'm in the mood for something, I buy it!    Edit: I'll also be honest. Price plays a role in what I buy too. Above $10-12 a bottle, it's less of an impulse purchase, with limited exceptions. When we're that expensive, I'll typically do more research and check BA / Untappd and maybe even just search for a review or two. Below $10 a bottle, I'll impulse buy more."

There is no need for spreadsheets and apps and checking ratings and all that. If you want a broad, diverse beer experience, just make it a point to buy something you've never had every time you go to the store or bar. There is no better way to explore the beer world.  Don't worry about getting bad beers sometimes. You will - and that's good. It's just as important to know what doesn't work for you as it is to know what does. You can learn just as much about beer from a lousy beer as you can a good one. That contrast is important."

So does your understanding of certain styles, the situations in which you drink or ways you drink (which can influence what you're drinking), trends in the industry, recipes, and more.  It's nice that you've had a few beers, but it's not like you suddenly reach a point where poof, ""I've experienced everything I need to experience.""  Famed beer writer Michael Jackson, someone to whom the entire beer reviewing/writing industry owes a huge debt, was still exploring, discovering, and learning well into his 60s.

If and when you brew your own, it's a fun challenge to drink something that's considered bad and try to brew a better version of it. Maybe you improve the mouthfeel, maybe you strengthen the hop profile by changing the amounts used in the recipe.  Whenever and wherever I travel in the US, I make sure to go to at least one brewery and brewpub I haven't been to before or have never had a beer from. I ask people locally where they go.

I don't begrudge any brewery positioning itself with investment backing, whether they've been going for decades and an owner is looking to retire or are a new brewery and looking to establish themselves with better resources to compete.  At some point the market will decide the winning and losing bets. When it starts showing which way it leans I hope quality isn't negatively affected, and opportunities and jobs remain for local/community and independent brewers."

It seems like there's a few breweries that get shit on for no reason (Denver Beer Co especially comes to mind) and a few breweries who manage to survive out of... loyalty? Convenience? I don't entirely know. Twisted Pine and Joyride are other breweries that I think are plain mediocre and yet have managed to find some sort of following. Of course, I feel like Breckenridge and Twisted Pine have great brewpub locations with fantastic food, and Joyride has an emerging community in Edgewater around it, so I guess they all have some sort of vehicle for success."

beer,3dy6ma,KingVape,4,Mon Jul 20 16:17:30 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I don't care for Blue Moon myself but they've done great things for craft beer as a whole. They're a gateway for many that have stayed away in the past. They get people to try something new and from there they become a bit more open to trying other new things like craft offerings.   This may not be a beer for a craft beer drinking IPA fan, but it'll likely get many macro drinkers to try it and from there, they'll likely be more willing to try other IPAs too. We don't need to blow peoples faces off with hop bombs when they're just getting started. Something like this can get them in the door and open them up to trying other craft offerings."

So here's what I got:  -Davidson in Glens Falls is a top notch brewery and would only require 1/2 hour of driving.  Try the Red and get dinner there.  -Keep an eye out in stores for Lake Placid Brewery and a newer one out of Canton NY: St Lawrence Brewing.  Their 4 pack for DIPA cans was only $9.  Also look for anything from Browns Brewery in Troy  -ADK Pub and Brew is hit or miss with their beers.  Hated their Tangerine Ale but think they make a good lager.  Definitely a good stop to break up the outlet shopping  Edit: Forgot Mean Max Brew Works in Glens Falls  -Fort Ann has a distillery that makes whiskey  -Glens Falls has two breweries I know nothing about:  Coopers Cave and Common Roots  -No idea if you'll find it but I had some cans from a brewery in Chatham NY that were great!"

I think you'll find a lot of people in Texas wouldn't qualify Shiner as a craft beer even if the BA does. It will help make your analysis a little easier.

They'll all fill other breweries' growlers. Carton likes to put a branded sticker over the logo, but they come off easy. Kane hangs a tag off the handle. The rest use tape and just write the name of the beer.  There was some uncertainty about this in the past, but the NJ ABC has said that filling another brewery's growler is fine as long it bears the government warning, is sealed after filling, and any label accurately reflects its contents.  As for that government warning, whether or not a given brewery will notice or care if it's missing is up for grabs. If I were getting a blank growler, I would definitely affix a sticker with that warning on it."

It can also be deceptive for the brewer to pinpoint where to focus their efforts because their sample from the bright tank might look great, but then the packaging run and bottle environmental conditions change things in a way that might not be immediately evident to them. But yeah, that's a lot. But also, I've gotten that much out of various bottles from other breweries large and small before."

beer,3dzzq9,asharkey3,4,Mon Jul 20 22:15:27 2015 UTC,"No, they don't all taste like piss. The style of beer you're used to is called different things, but sometimes American adjunct lager, American light lager, etc. The major names are all fairly similar. They're low on flavor to start with, but often have off flavor hints like wet cardboard or stale popcorn or weird sweetness. I can't answer what ""that taste"" is other than the combo of similar grains, hops mixes, and yeasts, but I know what you mean.   But that's just one style of lager. There are lots. Beer breaks down into two families mainly - lager and ale. Each family has lots of styles. Check them out here.   What you had was an ale, specifically a wheat ale, specifically a German style of wheat ale called hefeweizen. It uses a particular type of ale yeast. So between the yeast and the grain, you've already got something very different than a Bud or whatever. Another style of wheat ale you might like originates in Belgium. It's called witbier, or just wit. Instead of the hints of banana and clove that you typically find in hefeweizens, you'll find hints of orange peel and coriander or similar profiles. There are various American wheats too that aren't necessarily either of those styles, so keep an eye out.  You may be happiest exploring the ale side of the house for now, but just to show you that not all lagers are the same, go find yourself a doppelbock. This is a very malty and dark German style that's like drinking a bowl of liquid Raisin Bran cereal. It's a lager, but it tastes and smells and looks nothing like the big name grocery store standards you know. One you might find in a good beer store would be Celebrator by Ayinger, recognizable on the shelf by the little white goat charms that hang around the neck of each bottle on a red string. That's a great beer and totally different from Bud/Miller/etc. Bocks, Oktoberfests, Schwarzbiers, there are various other lager styles you can find. Pilsners and Vienna lagers will be closer to the Buds etc than these other lager styles, but typically a lot better. You can see what you think though. An easy pilsner/pilsener to find is the prototype, the original, Pilsner Urquell. It's easy drinking and smooth. See what you think. Sam Adams lager is apparently a Vienna lager or based on that style. Other easy to find lagers to try in other lager substyles might be Brooklyn Lager and Anchor Steam.  Happy exploring."

There are also two very extensive bottle/beer shops.  One is the Mobil Station on Milton (the interstate you'll be on from Phoenix is I-17 and turns into this road as I-17 essentially ends in Flagstaff) is on the right as soon as you enter Flagstaff and they have a FANTASTIC selection of Arizona beers as well as beer from elsewhere (2020 S Milton Rd Flagstaff, AZ) .  The other shop I would highly recommend is McGaugh's Bottle and Smoke Shop.  (218 S San Francisco St Flagstaff, AZ 86001).  It's a little further into Flagstaff than the Mobil station, but they also have a great selection.      There are two routes you can take from Flagstaff to the Grand Canyon.  One is via US180 and is a beautiful drive, but has no beer on it.  The other is I-40 from Flagstaff to Williams and then north to the Canyon.  Williams has Grand Canyon Brewing which makes some really good beers(and is right off the highway), it's worth a stop in there.  Have a good trip !  Cheers!"

The Alchemist, Hill Farmstead, and Lawsons are probably the biggest must-visits and since it looks like you are from CA those are all beers that are impossible to get on the west coast.

Orange County: The Bruery and Noble Aleworks are the standouts, Bootleggers can be good too.  San Diego: ...is a fucking playground. There's no shortage of excellent beer. A newer, great spot is Bagby Beer in Oceanside (Bagby used to brew for Pizza Port and won multiple awards), the beer is very good, the food is good too. And just around the block is a place called The Flying Pig, it's a restaurant not a brewery, they have good beer, but they have a pork chop plate that's fucking amazing (also the pork belly plate).  As for the rest of the SD area, shit that could be its own thread (or own sub), but for me personally, the places I've enjoyed were Blind Lady Alehouse, the new Ballast Point in Miramar (order the chorizo mussels), Modern Times...uh oh yeah, breakfast spot in Oceanside: Beach Break Cafe. Great breakfast food, really cool staff, surfboards hanging from the ceiling and a little skateboard museum display right when you walk in the door. And you can get a side of coffee cake instead of toast with your dish.  Stone was cool for the spot, but I was a little disappointed there weren't more pilot beers on tap. When I was there they only had one beer that wasn't available bottled, it was a lavender pale ale and wasn't very good. Still a good spot, and maybe it's different than when I was there a couple years ago. I did enjoy sitting in the zen garden and listening to the frogs while I sipped my super fresh Ruination though. And try the beer cheese soup.  I'm from LA County though, so I play tourist in SD, I'm sure some dudes can come in here and give you some spots I know nothing about.

OP, if you do get down to SD, you could spend at least a day checking out a fraction of the breweries. I recommend hitting up some of the lesser known places (rather than your Stones, Ballast Points, or the like) and head into Miramar or Clairmont. My local favorites are Societe, Helm, Modern Times, Intergalactic, and Ballast Point (their smaller locations are nicer in that they are less crowded. The Little italy location has the most beers on tap as that is their R&D place and do many limited brews). Avoid stone unless you are a huge fanboy...they have nice facilities but I've never been impressed with their offerings as pretty much everything is bottled that's on tap.  Since it looks like you're going through San Luis Obispo (SLO), make sure to stop at Central Coast Brewing for beer (Happy hour every day from 5-7, it's honestly better than Firestone in Paso, less people and pretty much all the beers at firestone are ones you can get bottled) and stop at Firestone Grill (not related to the brewery) for a tri-tip sandwich.

From there, crawl your way around River North/Five Points. Options there are Great Divide, Crooked Stave, River North Brewing, Epic, Spangalang. There are more options in the neighborhood and downtown but those are my favorites.  A bit South of downtown there's TRVE, Renegade, and Lowdown all fairly close.  The NW side of town where I live is a little more quiet but still has some great stops. Good bottle shops in Mondo Vino and Small Batch Liquors. Good breweries in Hogshead (English-style cask-conditioned Real ales), Joyride, De Steeg, Gold spot, Diebolt.  EDIT: If you can swing it, it's worth the extra mileage to take 70 West through CO, especially if you can time it to be in Glenwood Springs on the first Saturday of the month. Even if not, it's an astoundingly beautiful drive, and passes near some decent breweries with really good patio views. If I were to optimize your route, I'd stay on 80 until 25, head down to Denver with stops in Fort Collins and Longmont, maybe Boulder, do the Denver stuff above, Hit up Cannonball Creek brewing in Golden before shooting west on 70.   I love Wyoming, but 80 does not go through the interesting part."

Worth checking out for their kolsch alone.  Also, if you're going through Fort Collins, New Belgium is a pretty legit tour. Cool company, good beer."

Make sure to stop in Auburn for Knee Deep - its just a few miles off the highway - some of the best IPAs in NorCal.  If you have time for a slight detour, take Hwy 49 from Auburn to Nevada City and hit Ol' Republic - a hidden gem with some seriously good beer.  From there you can catch Hwy 20 for a pretty drive through the Sierras back to 80 and head on to Reno.  Ditto the comment to make sure you hit Ft Collins, which it looks like you are doing.  The Odell tap room is great.  I also highly recommend Equinox."

Take Hwy 287 instead of 25 and hit basically in this order: Avery is my favorite for their barrel aged series but their standards are good but not great. Left Hand, a short drive away is incredible for everything from insanely hoppy to malty deliciousness. Oskar blues not only has a few of my favorite standards but also has some great southern comfort food restaurants. Get the texas toothpicks as a side on whatever you get.  Then fort collins has Odell's that is definitely worth the pilgrimage as you work into wyoming."

If you make it into Chicago proper check out Half Acre and Lagunitas for breweries, and check out Local Option and Hofleaf for beer bars.    In Detroit area, check out Witch's Hat Brewing and Kuhnhenn Brewing. Try the Big Doedish at Witch's Hat and DRIPA at Kuhnhenn.  When in the bay area check out The Rare Barrel in Berkley if you like sours, they put out some great stuff and have a cool tap room.    Didn't have the chance to visit any breweries but The Bayou in Salt Lake City had a nice beer selection.    I'd strongly consider going through North Carolina to stop in Asheville and Charlotte.

Sure, it adds a bit of time, but you're more or less on that path from Chicago to TG anyway.  In Milwaukee, hit up MKE Brewing, Lakefront, Discount Liquor.    Tyranena is on the way to Madison from Milwaukee if you feel so inclined to take a pit stop.  I hear Balling the Queen's excellent.    In Madison, go to Karben4, Wisconsin Brewing, Capital, Vintage.    New Glarus is pretty self-explanatory (no exclusives unless you go to an R&D release, but great scenery and fresh beer on tap)."

Bad Beat and CraftHaus are literally across the street from each other.  I live in Kingman, AZ and work at Black Bridge Brewery in downtown Kingman.  I'm biased, but I love our beers and would be honored as hell to have you stop in.  On down I-40 in Williams, AZ, there's Grand Canyon Brewing which has great beers.  A bit further down I-40 in Flagstaff, there's Lumberyard Brewing, Flagstaff Brewing Co., Mother Road Brewing, Historic Brewing and Wanderlust Brewing.  I have had beers from every one of those breweries and I can honestly say that every brewery knocks it out of the park every time.  Flagstaff is a beer drinkers wet dream and I'm happy to see that you're spending the night there.  I recommend Hops on Birch and The Green Room(downtown Flagstaff) for evening beers and La Fonda for breakfast in the morning.  That's all I really know about Northern Arizona/Nevada breweries.    I was in Ventura, CA back in December for a friend's wedding and was really impressed with Surf Brewing Co. and Barrelhouse 101.    Cheers !"

The brewery is a little over an hour north of Toronto, so no sure if visiting is an option for you.  In terms of visiting breweries in town, Mill Street and Amsterdam are both nice, and have decent (if fairly generic) restaurants, and a fairly wide offering of beers.  Not much in the way of sours and IPAs, though.  Bellwoods Brewery is smaller than the previous two, but likely has more beers up your alley.  Decent patio, too.  Also located in a cooler area of town.  An IPA that's not super hoppy, but does seem to be fairly widely enjoyed, is Duggan's #9 (they have a brewpub in town).  I'm more partial to their #5 Sorachi Lager, though.  As I'm more of a lager/ale man in general, some local ones that I enjoy are the above-mentioned Duggan's #5, St. Andre, and Mill Street Stock (for whatever that's worth!)."

Most LCBOs have an Ontario Craft Beer section you can raid. If you're in for hops here are a few options:  Flying Monkeys Hoptical Illusion or Smashbomb Atomic IPA  Muskoka Mad Tom/Twice As Mad Tom IPA (6.4% ABV/64 IBU vs. 8.4%/71)  Nickel Brook Headstock IPA or Continental Drift Belgian Pale Ale  Hop City HopBot IPA (Hop City is actually owned by Moosehead but operates independently and I unashamedly love HopBot)"

beer,3dvus5,HUH_YIS,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:12:46 2015 UTC,At least here in PA you can rent a keg tap and the tub for around $20 extra and you'll get that money back when you return it as well.
beer,3dvus5,sasonmeewald,2,Mon Jul 20 00:31:40 2015 UTC,"You need three things:   The keg itself Equipment to dispense the beer, and A way to keep the keg cold   So #1 is obvious, and most beer stores sell them. For #2, the same stores should have taps for rental - if a store sells kegs and doesn't rent taps, just go to another store. They'll give you a simple tap that uses a hand pump to pressurize the keg, so you don't need a CO2 tank or anything. And #3 can be done with a large tub and some bags of ice. The store may or may not rent tubs as well.  Here's a random store that I've never been to and am not necessarily suggesting, it's just an example:  http://www.thebeerstorenh.com/KEGS_0I8U.html  Those guys rent taps and even tubs. You might notice their note saying they don't rent jockey boxes. This is a jockey box (again just an example). They let you serve cold beer using less ice than just a tub, because the ice goes in the cooler and the beer is chilled as it's served, instead of chilling the entire keg. However you need a CO2 tank and regulator to use a jockey box. Note the rental I linked includes those things, that's why the rental is a little expensive. Homebrew stores are more likely to rent these than beer stores, but some beer stores may have them.  Anyway those are your options."

Stanley's is on site at JK, but just skip it and go to Pieous.  If you are with someone, order the pastrami plate and one pizza.  It does not matter if you like pastrami, just do it.  It is fucking great.  You are a terrible person if you do not like it.  Hops and Grain  After that, Adelbert's, Strange Land, Live Oak, 512, Zilker, Thirsty Planet, and more.  Then on to brewpubs:  Pinthouse Pizza - great house beer with 40ish other taps. - Solid pizza but nothing crazy good.  I eat there often because I like the bar.  Black Star Coop - same as above but with only around 20 other taps - Good food all around.  Whip In / Namaste Brewing - Good beer - interesting place.  I used to go there a lot and they have 60ish taps. - Tex-Indian food as if that is a thing - some people rave about it, I think it is mediocre. I like regular Indian food much better.  ABGB - only house beer, but it is good, just wish there was more. - Solid pizza  Beer Bars:  First and foremost - Craft Pride.  60 taps of ONLY TX beer.  Great to get a good local beer. - Via 313 on their patio is fucking delicious.  Banger's - next door to Craft Pride - 100 taps or so.  Great choice. - They have great sausages and other beer garden style food.  Draughthouse - one of the oldest beer bars in Austin - 70ish taps.  North of downtown near Pinthouse Pizza  (so easy to do both together).  Good prices at both. - No food but sometimes food trucks at Draughthouse.  Others worth mentioning - Waller Creek Pub House (downtown), Chicago House (downtown), Wright Brothers Brew and Brew (downtown), Hi Hat (east of downtown but close), Whip In (just south of downtown - but already mentioned), Pinthouse (north of downtown but mentioned), Hopfields (near campus).  I would not go to Gingerman, but that is just me, I never go and live here.  Beer Stores:  First and foremost - WhichCraft.  It is the only true bottle shop in town. Great service, only craft, and often free samples.  Then you have East 1st Grocery, Sunrise (on Anderson), Specs, Central Market, Whole Foods are the main other ones.  But just go to WhichCraft.

Check out South Austin Brewery if they're open. They are usually open on weekends, with a band playing (very cool little stage) and a nice party-type atmosphere. They have all of their beers for really cheap (3 dollar drafts). I really enjoy the TPA.   Go to Rainey St. and check out Craft Pride. It's a beer/wine only bar with only Texas beers on draft. Really cool atmosphere, great bartenders, and the best pizza I've ever had in my life in the truck out back (VIA 313).   Live Oak Hef can be found at almost every single restaurant in Austin. I hear the tour is cool, but if you can't find time, at least try it somewhere. It might be the best Hef on the market. I also enjoy the Big Bark Amber.  If you're looking for other places to check out, let me know. I work downtown and have been to quite a few places in my 1 year here."

They can't even keep up with demand in their back yard.  And shipping beer direct to consumers is illegal in most states. That's why no brewery does it.

That said, this is either going to try the uber approach of breaking every law they can find until they get big enough that states negotiate with them, or they're going to get shut down fast.  I expect the later prior to the former with anything beer.

Uber ignored the corrupt medallion system to bring a better product to consumers, and are finally providing the impetus for making changes to that system. The current distribution system is also corrupt, and if a company challenges that with a solution that's better for consumers, that's a good thing. Both are great examples of crony capitalism and should be challenged, especially when good market-based solutions exist, but are kept illegal because of the undue influence of certain companies (cab companies in the former example; big beer in the latter) on politicians."

In talking with the Barrel Backer guys it's a big part of what they work with when they're talking to the individual breweries and figuring out how much, if any, product they can get from a brewery when it hits the required level of interest. That discussion has a big part to do with how many cases are available and the ""days remaining"" in the listing.  As to the legality piece, it was one of the first questions I asked them. Basically they are not the shipper. They are working with a distributor that has the necessary legal ability to ship the beer. If for any reason, the user is in a location that cannot receive shipments they will be notified when they put their address in. Currently the only places that can't be shipped to are Utah (not surprising) and Iowa (surprising) if I remember correctly."

beer,3dr6si,LZ_MPLS,10,Sun Jul 19 05:04:08 2015 UTC,"Barley John's is just up 35W. The best brown ale and the best pilsner i've ever had both came from here!  Hammerheart is out in Lino Lakes, but completely worth the trip. They've got an excellent lineup of barrel-aged, smoked, robust, dark, and rich beer. Truly remarkable!  Indeed always has a few awesome taproom-series beers on tap, and have a nice little space with a patio and food trucks.  Sisyphus, Fair State, and Urban Growler round out my top five.. uh, six.  and many many others!"

beer,3dr6si,wildhockey64,3,Sun Jul 19 20:09:40 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for the standard, Surly is a must. They've done so much for the beer business in this state.  Lots of the others are a ton of fun as well -- Bauhaus; Fulton; Summit.   If you're looking for something with great brews and no pretense, Flat Earth is a solid choice:  http://flatearthbrewing.com/beer.php  I'd recommend making a list (from what's been mentioned here), bookmarking their websites/twitter feeds, and checking to see which food trucks are where (other than Surly, which has its own food).   We have some fantastic food trucks in the Cities, and that can be a fun part of the experience."

""Indeed"" and Sociable Cider Werks are in the same neighborhood as above, and also quite good. Steel Toe is also great, but the taproom is only so-so.  If you wanna cross the river into St. Paul, Bang! and Flat Earth are pretty decent. Also Urban Growler in St. Paul is just fine."
beer,3dr6si,goducks2438,2,Sat Jul 18 18:39:58 2015 UTC,I mostly agree although I was not impressed with Sociable's beer so if you don't like cider....  A couple of lesser known ones: Boom Island does all Belgian styles pretty decently. Fair State does a lot of sours and has a lot of good ethnic food nearby.
beer,3dr6si,obsidianop,2,Sat Jul 18 19:06:12 2015 UTC,"Indeed is great.  They always have a number of one offs and cask ales on.  Great River and Tin Whiskers in St. Paul are also good.

Summit is alright, Indeed is great, Bauhaus is ok, Steel Toe is pretty good, Town Hall is great but I think their food is hit and miss. You could also hit up some restaurants with solid tap lists like the happy gnome, or (my personal favorite) black sheep."

beer,3dqnfm,TheShittyBeatles,42,Sat Jul 18 14:49:13 2015 UTC,"I found some of their results hard to believe, so I went to the article's source.   We crawled the website BeerMenus, a site at which bars and restaurants can post their drink menus. The dataset includes over 6,000 bars and restaurants with over 20,000 different beers. Only bars and restaurants that submit their listings to BeerMenus are included in the analysis, which means our data is biased towards the kind of places that would put their menu on the internet.   I think that site is probably skewed towards craft beer joints which is why you see results like Bell's Oberon being the most common beer sold at bars in Kentucky. I would really expect one of the big three macro light beers to take top spot in just about every state, with the possible exceptions of a couple like Yuengling in PA and Shiner in TX. However, there's no way Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat is actually offered at 83% of bars in Nebraska.  My conclusion: the headline is probably correct; however, it misrepresent their data which show lots of interesting beers because they were pulled from a biased source."
beer,3dqnfm,ironicname,8,Sat Jul 18 16:54:17 2015 UTC,"I agree, I opened this expecting to see one of the big 3 in almost every state. Also I wouldn't really expect to see Shiner even on Texas. It's offered a lot of places, but anywhere offering it pretty much offers any of the big 3 too."

That was prior to the major craft boom of recent years so many places got their heads out of their asses and put Yuengling where it should be among domestic beers.

Alot of A1 beers are from a brewery who only features that one to five styles. Sam Smith is a shining example on how to do it all, harvieston is how to do it right, Cantillion is how to do it with love and tradition.   Allagash is like the matt forte of smaller batch brewing. While they are popular and have a large facility, they keep the bar very very high continually with all different styles of beers. Give them 3 different beers to make for 250 years and see how good thier product could be againt a rival trappist/english made beer.  If there is another brewery thats can hit the beers like they do, please let me know, I don't mind driving 259miles(one way) for a havieston 40yr that costs $40 in a bar."

You are just being ridiculous saying that they are the only brewing doing things like they are outside of those three.  They focus on making solid Belgian style beers and make some incredible sours.   I'll give you a few examples of US breweries that are at least their equals and leave it at that.   Hill Farmstead, Russian River, Crooked Stave, The Bruery,  De Garde, Jester King, Cascade, New Glarus, and Goose Island (for BCBS and their sours alone), and Perennial/Side Project."

They might have 10 or 12 different styles of 1 each and 30 wild ales or saisons. Or visa versa with any certian type of beer. I don't think you understand what a whole line takes to happen.

You just don't apparently recognize that.  Apparently other people see this too as your first reply is being downvoted to all hell."

Which gives thier whole line something no one else has done. Try a Ola Duhb and get back to me.  Sam Smith is a benchmark for popular beer styles. And they do it on a massive scale. Kudos to these guys and then some.  What other breweries can match 10 to 15 different styles as sam smith and allagash? While there are execellent examples of certian beers(St.bernardus Wit my favorite), getting a whole line that rivals small batch brews is very, very rare.  Credit must be given where due. If distribitors werent such blood sucking sheep, more people could enjoy such wonderful creations."
beer,3dqnfm,Freshnbaked,4,Sat Jul 18 19:10:16 2015 UTC,We actually have this tiny unknown brewery called Hill Farmstead that seems to counter your argument.  Argue all you want but bottles of Allagash aren't selling for $60 a bottle.  Lawson's Liquid Maple Trippel is $30 for 750 ML and it will sellout within 1/2 an hour tomorrow morning.

You don't know what beer you are talking about even with the ability to search for it at your fingertips, yet you continue to type inaccurate information to prove you know nothing.  Enjoy your ""upscale"" D'Amato's. I figured someone working at a place of business that does ""high volumes"" of sales of beer would have a visible beer menu. I also figured that a Michigan based place that does ""high volumes"" of beer sales would be promoting the tons of good Michigan beers you have in the state.

I like the locust bar near Jefferson university, it's a good old dive bar smoking is permitted still so you have been warned. A great one I tried last month during Philly beer week was Victoria freehouse near Penns landing. I don't know if they are still serving it but they had this absolutely delicious mead, I was a little gone at that point so I don't remember the name. I also love brauhaus schmidtz on south street, epic selection of all German import beers they probably won't have any local craft brews but the stuff they do have is shipped half a world away and some of it has never been on US soil before. Frankfort hall is another wunderbar German pour house great food better beer. The kicker that will earn a decent amount of hate is the field house below the convention center. It's a sports bar but where they lack in food and atmosphere they most certainly make up for in selection.

beer,3dplne,el_refrigerator,9,Sat Jul 18 12:05:36 2015 UTC,"I came here to say this.  The three differences between Guinness and domestic ball lock systems are:  The Keg Coupler - which is only used for Guinness, Harp, or some other european kegs.  The Nitro/CO2 gas - Which is a mix of 75% Nitro and 25% CO2  The Faucet - Which has a specific restrictor plate which causes the guinness style pour.    You can't use the nitro without the faucet, but you can use the faucet without the nitro.  The faucet blends the gas into the beer during the pour to give the signature guinness cascade.  If you remove the restrictor in the faucet, then you can use the faucet to pour draft that is 100% CO2.  Personally I would start with a domestic set up first.  There are so many options that you can choose from, whereas if you start with the european system you are going to limit what you can purchase.bn"

beer,3dplne,jakl53,6,Sat Jul 18 15:47:52 2015 UTC,I just bought a kegerator myself. At first I was planning on building a triple tap but I get commercial kegs through work and just the build got expensive.   So I figured at this price I can just buy one premade thats just plug n play. Well the triple taps that hold 3 1/6th barrels (torpedos or sixtels) are like $900 so I wasnt THAT keen about 3 taps. Next I was going the Costco route ($400+30 ship) with plans to add a second tap ($130) but then I would still have to buy a second regulator anyway and that got too expensive and still had work and so I continued my search.  I finally settled on the KC2000TWIN by edgestar and found it on overstock for $600 free ship and used a new user %10 off code for a grand total of $540. I got it Tuesday and after the hook up from work grabbed a 1/6th of shandy yesterday for $16 and I drank a quarter of it last night. If you have any questions feel free to ask. Ive spent the better part of the past three months researching lol.

When I lived with 3 roommates we would buy half barrels for $130-180 (around $1 a beer). My girlfriend and I moved to a different state, and here it's cheaper to buy 12 packs of bottles or cans than it is for us to buy 1/6th barrels (not to mention the upfront cost of $400-800 for the kegerator).

beer,3dplzz,wazzusean,16,Sat Jul 18 05:41:23 2015 UTC,"There are many different styles of lagers. A lager just means a beer that's been brewed with a bottom fermented yeast (as apposed to a top fermenting yeast which sits on top of the brew like a large frothy head), which is then cold stored for a few months while it undergoes secondary fermentation. There are many styles of lager. Helles(Bavarian)/dortmunder(Czech) which is a pale malt lead fruity beer with little hop presence. Pils(German)/Pilsner(Czech) also a pale beer, but much hoppier and bitter. Dunkel(German)/Tmavý(Czech) which are copper amber to dark brown malty beers, which are nutty and roasty and taste of dark dried fruits and sweet caramel malts. Then there is the big boy, my favorite style of lager the dopplebocks, they are like a dunkle but much stronger, sweeter, thicker, fruitier, and maltier typically 6.x%-8.x% abv, generally drunk as cold weather warmers, but there is a pale hoppier version called the maibock which is drunk in may. Looking at what ratebeer says about Tom Creans, I think you'll like the helles/pils style of beer. So look out for Ayinger Jahrhundert, Andechs Helles Vollbier and Augustiner Helles in the helles catagory, and Edel pils and Tegernseer Pils for pils. Happy hunting."

For Pilsners:  Pilsner Urquell  Staropramen  Waldhaus (not sure if this is in America or not)  Budweiser Budvar (Czechvar in the U.S., it's not affiliated with the American Budweiser corporation at all)  Hummel-Bräu Pilsner  For Helles:  This isn't my favorite style. It's basically very similar to Pilsner but is less hoppy and bitter. Any of the major Munich breweries would have a good option here (Paulaner is probably my favorite of these, and if you can get some Hofbräuhaus or Hofmühl try that).  Next, try to branch out into some darker lagers (Dunkel). These are lagers but have some sweeter caramel, chocolate, and coffee flavors that are really nice. This is one of my favorite styles.   Andechs Dunkel is one of my favorites, but again I'm not sure if it's available in the U.S.  Ayinger Dunkel  Ayinger Celebrator (technically a doppelbock, but very similar)  Köstritzer Schwarzbier is really solid. It's actually a schwarzbier, so it's completely black in color whereas dunkels would be copper and dark brown colored.   Then you should taste some wheatbeers. These are sweeter and have some banana and clove flavors. They are really nice on a hot day or really any day.  Ayinger Urweisse  Paulaner Hefe-Weißbier  Weihenstephaner  Andechs Weißbier  If you're still with me at this point, try some ales.

I've not had Tom Crean's lager, but reviews describe it as a toasty/""bready"" lager with a touch of grassiness.  If it's the grassiness that floats your boat, look for German (especially East German) pilsners like Wernesgruner. You may find most pilsners too bitter, though. In that case, keep an eye out for so-called ""golden"" lagers. These are lagers that have a faint touch of toasted malt to them, which gives them bread-like aroma and flavor.  I'm sorry I can't give you specific North American suggestions, but I've been living on the west coast for a decade, and lagers are generally shit out here. If you're in Ontario or Quebec anytime, I suggest giving Labatt Crystal or Labatt 50 a go - if they still make them."

While those you've listed are very tasty, I was hoping to find something from Boulevard, 3Floyds, Pipeworks, or a limited/rare Goose Island release (they have keg only offerings, like Sofie Paradisi which is AMAZING!)."
beer,3dprgn,Seanbikes,2,Sat Jul 18 16:27:17 2015 UTC,Anything that rare like the Sofie Paradisi is going to end up at a bar and not in the hands of a regular consumer.  As far as I know 3Floyds doesn't do kegs to consumers anymore and the only way I'd expect to get Pipeworks is if you bought it from them and drove it down to FL.

They are (as far as I know, would love to know if there's more) the only places you can buy full strength cold beer, even on SUNDAYS. Hallelujah!  Epic has a slightly larger variety, all their beers are 22 oz, but they have a ""tapless tap room"" where you can sample all the beers you want (you have to order food to do this).   Squatters has 25oz 9% Hop Rising for $4, and I practically live off them. Their selection is great too, but not all the beer is full strength, as many of them are made to be on draft."

beer,3dpkmq,Barboski,2,Sat Jul 18 13:08:56 2015 UTC,"Great question!  Yeah I was really curious to see how things play out when I was moving up here.  I would actually say that PA's laws are better.  As far as buying beer/wine/alcohol at a retail location, PA's laws are a bit better than Utah.  In Utah each bottle is priced individually (at least at the state store which is full strength beer.  You can get beer up to 4% at any grocery store or 711).  Which is kind of nice in a way that you don't have to buy a case or 12 pack like a distributor.  That being said it ends up being more expensive than a distributor, but I find it is a tad cheaper than buying from a PA bottle shop or beer to go from a bar.  A lot of the state stores here in Utah though don't have a great selection and NONE are open on Sunday.  The part where I think the Utah laws REALLY suck, is the fact that you can't serve a beer with more than 4% alcohol on tap... If you want a normal beer at a bar you have to buy a bottle.  To me at least, this kills one of the main reasons of going to a bar in the first place.  And for that main reason, the PA laws are a lot better, so enjoy your greener grass friend :)"

beer,3dsi2z,CerebralBypass,5,Sun Jul 19 01:03:21 2015 UTC,"I sell beer for a living, and I can tell you that we refuse to fill outside growlers (99% of the time) because most people suck at rinsing theirs out. And just using water won't really do the trick. Growlers should be sanitized very well to ensure that the beer going into it won't get infected or ruined by the nasty crud you left in the bottom of it.   However, this only really applies to places like us who will take your used growler (from us) and replace it with one that has been properly sanitized and dried.  I can't speak to places who only fill their own growlers, but if you bring a used one in they will fill it right away without cleaning it themselves."
beer,3dsi2z,southsCLT,2,Sun Jul 19 03:41:28 2015 UTC,"All of the breweries I frequent will refuse to fill a dirty growler. My local growler bar will actually clean your dirty growler for you. I think refusing to fill a ""competitor's growler"" is a dick move and bad business."

beer,3dsi2z,The-Grim-Reefer,2,Sun Jul 19 13:44:02 2015 UTC,"Here's what's required on growlers in NC:    • Brand name of the product  • Name of the brewer/bottler  • Class of the product (is it a porter, lager, stout, etc.?)  • Net contents (how many ounces?)  • If the malt beverage is fortified with any stimulants from the original manufacturer, the amount of each (in milligrams) per container  • Name/address of the business that filled/refilled the growler  • Date of fill/refill  • If the malt beverage is more than 6% ABV, the ABV percentage will need to be on there  • The following statement: “This product may be unfiltered and unpasteurized. Keep refrigerated at all times.”  • The alcoholic beverage health warning statement as required by the Federal Alcohol Administration Act   Some breweries and shops will have some of this information printed on each of their growlers.  Others will use tags and stickers to ensure that each beer is correctly labeled.    If you bring in a growler from another brewery/bottleshop, it can be a pain for workers to ensure that each growler is properly labeled.  In some cases, it is probably a lot easier to say ""no outside growlers"" than to have to review and accept or decline other growlers on a case-to-case basis.    A brewery near me only sells pre-filled growlers, and you just drop off your glass when you pick up a new one.  I know of a growler store near me that does fill outside growlers, but charges you an extra fee to get a sticker with all of the required information.  Another place around me lets you trade in one of their growlers for another freshly sanitized one--the reward for using their growlers is never having to sanitize them yourself.    I don't think it is outrageous for breweries to refuse to fill their product in other companies' growlers.  In most cases, I would wager this is done not out of spite but because the breweries want to stay on the right side of the law."

For Goses to try: NoDa Brewing is releasing their What Gose 'Round next week at the brewery. It's pretty delicious. Other Goses that are available in our area are the Hibiscus Gose from Boulevard, Mission Gose from Evil Twin, and Champion's Face Eater Gose.   Other Sours: Try some Berliner Weisses. Champion's Tart, Bells' Oarsman Ale, Evil Twin's Nomader Weisse, and Dogfish Head's Festina Peche should be easy to find.   Pick up some beer from Wicked Weed. They're out of Asheville and specialize in some great sours. You'll pay between 10 and 15 bucks for a bottle, but it's well worth it! If you're ever in Asheville, stop in the Wicked Weed Funkatorium and get a flight of sours.   To take it up a notch, try some authentic Belgian sours such as Petrus Aged Pale Ale (my personal favorite), Duchess de Bourgogne, Rodenbach Grand Cru, and Monk's Cafe Flemish Sour. These will be much more tart than the Gose you tried, but you'll probably dig them! If you like fruitier beers, try some Lambics.  Have fun!"

What you may find is that over time drinking beers that are less hoppy you build up a tolerance, a hop appreciation, and eventually a hop craving. But it is not something to force. Just enjoy the beers that you enjoy. There are going to be hops in them, some more than others. Just stick to what you like, and occasionally try a sip or a sample of a beer that one of your friends recommends. If it's an IPA you may find that you still don't like them and that's fine. Or maybe one day you find that you do.   Tons of people go through what you are going through. They can't imagine how anyone could possibly like this taste and or just baffled and confused that they are missing something. But they're not because you like what you like and you don't like what you don't like and there isn't some standard of what is good. It's totally normal. Nature tells us not to eat things that are really bitter, so it's no surprise that when you have a bitter pungent IPA your palate tells you not to like it.   You may find that changing gradually over time, and maybe not. Tons of people who love IPAs now formerly hated them and could not understand how anyone could have like them. It really doesn't matter. There are plenty of beers out there for you to like without drinking IPAs. Try a pale ale for example. That's the junior version of an IPA. Or rather, an IPA is the turbo version of a pale ale. There are also beers that are a lot milder, such as most of the wheat beers you will find. Browns, ambers, lots of different lagers, there's all kinds of stuff. You don't have to like IPAs so don't force it. But just trust that the people who do like them actually like them because it's nuts to think that millions of people would be drinking a beer style that they hate as much as you hate it. The same thing just has a different effect on different people even if it seems really unlikely to you based on how it tastes to you. There's plenty of beer for everyone."

beer,3dskr8,onetwo4,2,Sun Jul 19 03:00:10 2015 UTC,"Your palette needs time to develop. Drink a variety of beers and keep an open mind and you might find that you will appreciate IPAs later. There are also a lot of IPAs now that are way toned down and would be a better choice to start with. Try out some session IPAs or some pale ales, then some APAs. Either way listen above and don't try to force it, just drink what you enjoy and let your palette do the rest."
beer,3dskr8,TheoreticalFunk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:58:41 2015 UTC,"The first 'hoppy' beer I had that I liked was Hopalicious from Ale Asylum.  It was a bottling mistake and it was free.  I really enjoyed it.  So I started exploring more hoppy beers.  Fast forward to the next time I was at that brewery, about a year later... I don't even like that beer any more.  Not hoppy enough.    Just like beer is an acquired taste, so are hops.  You will crave them.  And then one day you won't any longer.  It's an odd experience that I wish I could go through again.  :-)"
beer,3dskr8,GarrottedClown,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:34:53 2015 UTC,"Drink Mirror Pond Pale Ale, if you can get it, for 3 months, or else have Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.  These will acclimate your palate to hops.  If it is the warm time of year where you live, even better.  I think these are wonderful, frankly.  These are around 40 IBU. Then after three months, try Sierra Nevada Torpedo, their IPA.  Drink this for a month.  Not exclusively, but have some around.  This is 65 IBU. Then try Ballast Point Sculpin.  This is around 70 IBU.  This is my personal limit.  Whether it will remain so, I do not know.   Then come and revisit this post.  Your experience was my experience; didn't understand why everyone liked IPAs so much.  Then I climbed the ladder by mistake.  Generally because I discovered I liked hops; just not massive amounts of hops.  But then, I guess, I acclimated.  Maybe you'll never like IPAs, but I can say that I used to just wince when I had them.  Not anymore.  They're still not my favorite style, but there are specific times I crave them specifically.  Generally after exercise in the heat."

Try something that's not an IPA but hoppy, like a Ballast Point Calico. That was my gateway, then I tried an SN Pale Ale, all day IPA, then a Torpedo and it just went off the deep end of hops from there"

beer,3dskr8,jeffwhit,2,Sun Jul 19 15:35:53 2015 UTC,"What ipa's have you had? there are different aspects of ""hoppy"" so when you say hoppy it doesn't accurately describe what part of the hop taste you don't like. There is bitterness, flavor, and aroma - these are all characteristics of hoppy.  I enjoy ipa's and hopped beers because of the complexity and added flavors/smells/tastes it brings to the overall beer. You can have a hoppy beer that is dank and juicy with hop flavors with little to no bitterness. You can have a brew that is just straight hop smell. To even throw a wrench into the works you can have smooth bitterness and bitterness with a bite. All of these play along with the grain bill so super hoppy beers can be masked/subdued by a big malt body. To make it even more complex there are so many different hops, they each have their own flavors, bitterness amounts, and aroma abilities - i mean there is even hops that give a wine/grape like flavor  In short, hops are amazing and lend to a great wide variety of tastes and smells. I also like it when i drink a super dank beer and get a nice hop buzz going (hops are sometimes used in sleep aid teas)"

beer,3dskr8,japansam,3,Sun Jul 19 09:29:52 2015 UTC,"So, OP, not all IPAs taste like pine. The major hop that has strong pine flavor is Simcoe. There are other beautiful hops like Amarillo and Mosaic that have more floral, grassy, and tropical-fruity flavors. Give some IPAs that use those hops a shot.   For example, I think you would really dislike Stone IPA (malty, super bitter), but like Lagunitas IPA (lower abv, lower IBU, tastes like dank melon). But that's if you're on the west coast."

My advice is if you want to try something hoppy without it being the curbstompingly bitter taste you get from an IPA, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is a good place to go. That's where I am right now. At first it was on the edge of how bitter I could go with beer, but now I appreciate it and like it quite a bit. I still like witbier and lagers, but my palate is starting to expand.

It's just fun to taste a beer and get all those impressions from just some barley sugar water, yeast, and a bunch of flowers. IPA is also a style I can't brew worth a damn so I extra appreciate commercial IPAs."

Not IPA bitter, or too strong, but notably bitter. Whether that's from the coffee, the roast, some kind of hops, or the dark chocolate notes, I don't know. Speaking of chocolate, there is a sweetness to this beer but much more restrained in my opinion than in most imperial stouts. Plus it's a dark chocolate sweetness more so than a milk chocolate sweetness. I also got something akin to some woody notes. So along with the coffee notes it's a pretty grown up taste. I remember it having a really respectable and nice looking head too, good texture. I found it to be an unusual stout with an unexpected profile that was pretty interesting.

I think we all would have dry heaved and gotten sad and angry if AB had bought it. But I think pretty much everybody in the beer world likes and respects Duvel and its products and sees both as legit. So on the one hand, while it's a surprise to see one of the crown jewels go, it doesn't feel like such a big deal because you (or at least I) kind of trust Duvel not to fuck it up. Felt the same with Boulevard.   On the other hand, what happens when Duvel decides to sell themselves to ABInbev or one of the big multinational shitcannons? Because then we're right back to square one with the various concerns we've heard craft brewers talk about, such as declining choice ultimately. For example here's what Jacob of Modern Times said the other day in his AMA:    Q: What do you think about the mega breweries buying small craft breweries? Specifically Goose Island.  A: Well, on my most stressful days, I'm very sympathetic to the owners who chose to sell. On better days, I really, really wish it weren't happening. It screws craft breweries in a huge way. The biggest issue is that ABI immediately slashes the prices of the acquired brewery's beers. That may sound like a good thing for consumers, but it's actually an anti-competitive strategy that depends a multinational corporation's willingness to lose money or break even just to force out the competition. So if it continues and the strategy is successful (and it certainly has been in other industries), craft beer drinkers can expect a lot less choice in the beer world and much less friendly environment among brewers. Small, independent breweries can't afford to not make money just to maintain tap/shelf space; ABI can. So the end game of this process is very bad for craft brewers and drinkers.   Also it would be interesting to know the structure of a deal like this. What exactly do they give up in exchange for whatever they get? And what does that mean at the nuts and bolts and dollars and cents level? For example does it effectively mean that the owners have finally been able to take a big fat payday and are now employees who will continue to run things as normal, and the money is just on someone else's books now? And is it just a case that it works as an investment for Duvel, just another revenue channel for them? Does Duvel get something else out of it? Like in the San Miguel / Founders situation, they said that buying into Founders gave them access to the American market somehow.   At what point, if any, does Duvel start calling the shots at FW and what kinds of changes does the buyer  typically make in situations like this? Is it just a scenario where they see these great breweries as great investments and trust the guys who built them to keep doing what they're doing for the long haul? Or is there a larger strategy? Is it particularly different than when a brewery gets bought by a private equity firm?"
beer,3dkmcr,turkeypants,18,Fri Jul 17 02:01:59 2015 UTC,"So far, Duvel has not slashed Blvd. prices at all...in fact, they've remained unchanged since the buyout.  Also, if they are calling the shots at Boulevard, they're calling some pretty killer shots.  I've really enjoyed The Calling, Heavy Lifting, Radler and the fact that they're canning now.  At the same time, Tank 7 and most of the Smokestack Series is still in place and tasting great.  ABI, on the other hand, has been really watered down the Goose Island brand (with the exception of BCBS and the rest of the BA stuff) and I think Elysian and 10 Barrel are headed that way now.  There is a difference in which multinational buys out the smaller brewery.  AB-InBev is an advertising agency/marketing firm that happens to be pushing beer.  Duvel Moortgat is a brewing company that has pretty consistently cranked out quality beers, from their Mothership to Ommegang to Boulevard.  They just have not provided a reason to believe that this will go bad."
beer,3dkmcr,Stonecipher,5,Fri Jul 17 02:20:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, like I say, this one didn't bother me because Duvel seems all right for now. I'm just curious about the mechanics of any of these deals.   My only theoretical concern is the same as worrying whether AB/whoever will buy a treasured brewery directly. If one of the megas buys Duvel it's ultimately the same thing. I don't know if Duvel getting bigger like this makes them a more attractive target for any of the multinationals, but I would assume so. Win prize brands and eliminate competition in one swoop. That seems like what the megas have otherwise been doing as you watch them acquire brand after cluster after multinational.  Otherwise I'm curious about what it means to be an arrow in a growing Duvel quiver. Because there's shorter term and longer term (though we have Ommegang as a longer term indicator in this case). What if they buy up another five or six really good ones over the next ten years? Just for fun let's say they bought Cigar City, Russian River, 3 Floyds, Surly, Toppling Goliath, and AleSmith (whether or not that's a realistic prospect in any of those cases). What does it mean now to be in that club? Is it only advantages, like better deals on volume ingredient purchases, maybe all of them getting national distro? Other good things? Are there disadvantages? Does it become unwieldy at some point? Do they start making strategic choices to streamline the catalog or discontinue some smaller lines to focus on this or that stronger area? What pressures do they have as they get bigger? What individuality is lost from their component breweries if any as they grow?  For example, I think of someone like Pyramid, who are admittedly a last generation brewery that people haven't talked about in years. But through one acquisition and another they're now one of at least twelve breweries nobody cares about (Magic Hat, Honey Brown, etc.)  under the umbrella of Florida Ice and Farm Company, which also owns non-beer brands. Those weren't equivalent to the Firestone Walkers or Boulevards of the world to start with, but I still wonder what effect being part of that growing and repeatedly acquired quiver in general has meant for those breweries. Do you get lost at some point? Pyramid bought Portland, then got bought by Magic Hat's parent, all of which then got bought by KPS/NAB, which sold them to Florida Farm and Ice. Who's next, and what will that mean? What has it meant so far?  When we think of the megas, we think of faceless evil empires eventually shaving things down to bump share prices up a few cents or making other kinds of decisions the original owners might not have. Duvel doesn't seem that way now. If a Duvel gets big enough, though, do they go public and take the same path?"
beer,3dkmcr,turkeypants,2,Fri Jul 17 03:01:10 2015 UTC,"If a Duvel gets big enough, though, do they go public and take the same path?   Duvel has been public since June 1999 although the family own a controlling share."

""Combine"" is a safe word for now because it doesn't appear to be a straight purchase, and it doesn't appear to be a partnership. I'm inclined to believe that FW maintains control over their business and that Duvel will provide cash and resources in exchange for a portion of ongoing profits. But FW is a very important name to fall into this bucket in any way. They already do well and they already have a large footprint... One would think they could expand without an investor, and it turns out they couldn't (or didn't want to).  On another note, it's hilarious that huge FW fans have read FW's statement and buy in 100% immediately. Of course their carefully crafted letter says ""nothing will change"" and ""everything will get better."" What's it supposed to say? That they're sacrificing quality for growth?"

beer,3dkmcr,sjhalestorm,8,Sat Jul 18 15:40:43 2015 UTC,It helps b/c Firestone has a distribution hole in the middle of the US.  Boulevard is strong there and has strong relationships with distributors.  Duvel also could infuse cash into the brewery (vs. taking out a loan and risking your company OR taking money from outside investors who don't understand the business) and allow Firestone to make more beer.  Makes sense to me.

beer,3dkmcr,Stonecipher,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:20:23 2015 UTC,"Well, I will say Goose Island.  One of my favorite breweries ever - and not just for their BCBS, BA stuff, etc, but for their regular products like Honkers, IPA and Harvest in the fall.  They've watered down the brand with insanely cheap prices and pretty much no one cares about them outside the Chicago market or outside of their high-end, specialty beers still being brewed in Chicago.  Jury is still out on Elysian and 10 Barrel, but so far it hasn't gone well for Elysian, given that one of their original owners (who happens to be one of the smartest, best persons in craft beer) has already bailed on them.    Either way, Goose was enough for me to be skeptical."

Good beer isn't a popularity contest unless you're one of those people who only drink what is cool on Untapped this week. Watered down the brand with insanely cheap prices?  Last time I checked they are still selling at prices that are comparable to a quality beer being produced on the scale that it is.  312, Honkers etc are cheaper than the Sisters or their more limited offerings because of volume plain and simple. If it's popular enough to make a profit and continue being brewed and sold that at the same quality everything else is marketing and I don't drink marketing. Is the beer good and the same quality, yes or no?  Elysian isn't ruined either because one of the owners who didn't want to sell couldn't tolerate working for ""the man"".    There wasn't anything bad about what they were asking of him as an employee other than the fact he didn't want to be someone's employee. It seemed like a pretty good gig to be honest with a lot of travel on ""the man's"" dime to some interesting places. And frankly if he was so adamant about not working for someone else he should never have entered into a situation where you have 2 other partners and could be out voted."
beer,3dkmcr,Stonecipher,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:34:40 2015 UTC,"You're right, good beer is not a popularity contest.  In fact, I wish the public's perception was focused less on what's hot and more on the quality of the liquid.  That said, the quality of Goose Island's core products has dropped considerably in the past five years or so.  You're also right about Cantwell's decision to leave, other than the last statement you made, which is sort of ridiculous.  Do you think, that in a million years, that if you had the opportunity to open a really great, craft brewery with two buddies or associates that you would turn it down?  And if you were really excited about it, would you, in a million years, believe that one day you'd be faced with the decision of whether or not to accept a multi-million dollar buyout?  I don't think so."
beer,3dkmcr,Urabask,3,Fri Jul 17 02:41:30 2015 UTC,If anything the quality has gotten better and much more consistent since they're generally a lot fresher now that they're handed by AB's distro.  Their core beers were never especially exciting to begin with.

Meanwhile, not to rip on them but beyond brewing co. Is on the map yet... Beau's is superior to them for the Ottawa region (my opinion, also not claiming Beau's makes 90+ beer). Even the Toronto region is missing bigger players.  I get that it's a WIP but it shouldn't claim to have  ALL breweries with beer over 90 unless it actually does. I like the map but not the title."

Agreed w/ Dunham and Trou du Diable as well.  Charlevoix deserves a mention as well"
beer,3digst,PoodleDestroyer,2,Thu Jul 16 19:28:29 2015 UTC,I don't know why you've been downvoted. DDC is the only brewery that I could take any of their beer and there's a 90%+ chances I'm gonna like it. I've never had anything close to mediocre from them.
beer,3digst,PoodleDestroyer,2,Fri Jul 17 02:19:44 2015 UTC,"Some people get really territorial about their favorite breweries (especially say, Hill Farmstead or the Alchemist)... you should see the number of downvotes in /r/ctbeer, it's nuts.    That said, I have had one or two from DDC I thought were just ok, in particular I remember one in the style of the apple Ephemere from Unibroue that was just eh.    However, the number of times I've had a style from DDC that I've never even heard of and had it be absolutely killer, and seen that style catch on like wildfire a year or two later....  Or the beers where I'm still searching for anything at all like them, e.g. their Japanese tea beers or a spiced beer anywhere near as good as the Route de Espices....  DDC is truly a special place"
beer,3digst,arghdos,2,Fri Jul 17 14:26:04 2015 UTC,"DDC used to be the best in Quebec to me competing with TDD(Buteuse Special Ed. <3) but Dunham has been releasing unreal stuff this year(fig quadrupel, whut.) and I kind of fell in love with them.

beer,3dnci9,headlessparrot,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:13:12 2015 UTC,"As a supplier of beer to many company events, I can tell you that lululemon employees have a deep appreciation for the suds. Work hard, play hard is definitely embodied by them.   It is unfortunate that Mark Anthony Group (owner of the Delta, BC based Turning Point Brewery at which Stanley Park brand beers are brewed) was the one to get the partnership, trading in on the fact that they snagged the Stanley Park brand for beer and the event and afterparty are hosted there. lululemon may be more corporate than they once were, but I think their brand ethos of being innovative and offbeat would fit better with Parallel 49 (a craft brewery actually in Vancouver and with the size to actually handle an event like this).  Beer can be a decent post-workout beverage, but Curiosity Lager misses the mark here, being filtered (stripping out useful proteins and yeast as a source of B-vitamins) and not containing many electrolytes. Also, at 4.6%, you'd have to drink 12.5 of them before you hit the break even point of a 5% beer, something I doubt marathon runners are going to be undertaking.  Don't get me started on the wind turbine...  *Edit: the beer being filtered is pure conjecture. Also, I have no affiliation with Parallel 49 Brewing Co., they just seem like a good fit out of the choices of breweries located in the city."

It has long been legal for vendors with the proper licenses to ship to most states, but breweries and wineries have been never been able to ship directly to customers before.

For UPS and FedEx, it's simply ""against policy"" (businesses can ship alcohol to consumers if it's valid with state law, but person to person transfers are banned.) Which is why everyone jokes about ""olive oil shipments"" and ""living yeast samples.""  But you definitely do NOT want to be shipping through USPS - 18 USC Section 1716 is the relevant law, and you'll note there can be hefty fines and prison sentences associated.  USPS, however, would LOVE to get into the business. Think of the boom they'd get if they could ship alcohol direct to people's doors -  they've been pushing for it for years now. The Fed and State agencies, as well as the wholesalers, hate the idea because because it's lost profits and taxes."

beer,3dear0,picard001,6,Thu Jul 16 16:39:22 2015 UTC,To legally ship alcohol with FedEx you need to be approved as a shipper.  It's enabled on the shipping system and forces any alcohol shipments signature services to adult signature required (21+) which costs quite a bit more.  USPS would probably have similar requirements and the average person couldn't legally ship alcohol.

Everyone here loves what they do,” he [David Walker] added.   I wonder which specific gravities he's referring to there. He makes it sound like these things are inevitable and immutable laws but I wonder what flavor of inevitability he means. Is it the ""someone is offering me crazy money for this business that I've always just pumped profits back into and never really made a lot of money off of"" kind of gravity? The lure of the long-awaited payday, which we just assume acts like gravity due to our predictable tendency to take it? Or is it more like the ""we can't expand like we want to without some serious financing we can't generate at current volume"" gravity? Or is it a ""whether we want to or not, we will be pushed out of competition or crushed if we don't expand, so we are forced to find a partner, parent, investor, etc."" kind of gravity?   That last one is the one I'm most interested in because I don't know to what degree it exists. But that's the one that would seem most inevitable, while the others would be optional. It seems like the goal of business is to always grow - at a minimum because it produces rewards and so we just typically assume it's what people would want, but I wonder also if you find yourself pushed to after a certain size. Is it a ""grow or die"" kind of situation as Larry Bell said of Bell's in 2010? ""In this business, if you're not growing, you're dying."".   If so, why? Take Russian River for example. The owners say that it has always been a lifestyle business for them and they're not interested in expanding anymore at this point. That shows that at least in some cases and under certain conditions you don't have to grow if you don't want to, if you like it where it is, which says that you can reach equilibrium and stay there if you like and if the market cooperates. The popular corner restaurant that's been there for 50 years doesn't have to expand into a chain, for example. But maybe that's not always the case. If you're a mom and pop hardware store, maybe you get eaten up by the Home Depots et al if you don't expand because that's just the reality of mismatched competition, economies of scale, etc. That sounds like a ""gravity"" situation, i.e., economic forces that can't be resisted.   So if you're Goose Island or Boulevard or Firestone Walker or any of these others, is there ever a situation where you feel forced to sell or take on partners to survive or is what David Walker referring to typically a case of ""gravity"" of an enticing, desirable, enabling kind? Or is he referring to lots of different kinds that all add up to a generally predictable tendency toward growth and consolidation?   I'm more interested in hearing from people who know something about this than I am from guessers. I can guess too!"

beer,3dma3g,dfd02186,2,Fri Jul 17 14:29:24 2015 UTC,Well you have to go to certified beer distributers to buy beer and can only buy 24 packs at most places. Its pretty much impossible to get a 6 pack of craft beer for a reasonable price you have to commit to a 24 pack which will be like $35-40 bucks. So you are also committing to 24 beers you don't know if you even want.

Except for certain breweries that stick to their region -- Russian River, Surly, New Glarus, etc. -- there isn't much you can't find in NJ.  Find a good liquor store or three and between them you'll have literally hundreds of beers to choose from.  Where are you in the state? That way people can recommend good shops to you.  EDIT: As a side note, stop worrying about tracking down Heady Topper or whatever the flavor of the month is. You don't need to do that to drink the best. There are dozens upon dozens of fantastic top shelf beers, if not hundreds, that are easy to find and are just as worth drinking.

Not just a hobby, actually, an obsession, quite frankly. I read and study everything that I can about the fair, and I collect items from the fair.  Anyway, Pabst for over a hundred years has claimed that they got their name by winning the blue ribbon at the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. In fact, it even says it on the can. Pabst made a HUGE promotion about this - he even draped entire bars in a gigantic blue ribbon to promote this ""win"".   Here's the thing, though: It never happened. Pabst never, ever won a ""blue ribbon"" at the World's Columbian Exposition. Blue ribbons were not even given out. Beers that were exhibited at the fair that were of ""high merit"" were given a bronze medal, and that's all. In fact, MANY beers were given a bronze medal for high merit, but there was no blue ribbon.  The ""blue ribbon"" is an absolute lie, and one that has been going on since 1893. But Pabst declared himself the winner and tied little blue ribbons on every bottle of beer, and how was anyone to check, in 1893?  I first got this information by reading about all of the awards given to everything at the fair in ""The Book of the Fair"" - which is THE source for fair information. It clearly states that Pabst earned a bronze medal.   No blue ribbon. It's a complete lie, folks."

That's exactly what I had presumed they were going to do. It's what I would assume anybody with an existing non-beer brand would do in this situation. I figured they'd just get some big contracting outfit to crap out a standard generic beer and slap a sticker on it and everybody would buy it because Iron Maiden.   All the embellishments - the marketing, the name, the artwork - wouldn’t mean a thing if it didn’t work as a beer   On that note, I think it would be interesting to know what sales would have been like without the Iron Maiden branding. How would people have perceived it against the competition?  Because even with the influence of the branding, I'm seeing 3.37/5 on BeerAdvocate and a 3.04/5 on Ratebeer, which places it in my personal subpar, generic, and forgettable zone. But then again most regular beer drinkers aren't on the ratings sites, and if their goal was to put out a broadly palatable beer designed for volume drinking by a wide audience and without any perceived ""craft"" barriers to entry, I guess those kinds of BA/RB ratings are right about where you'd expect them to be. Plenty of market for that, so if they've pulled off a beer that works in that space, more power to them.

We have a VERY hard time separating marketing and hype from the actual beer. There are plenty of beers that are top 100 because of hype purely. In a blind tasting they'd never rate that high but because of limited availability or because others are telling them that they're amazing, others believe it too and it's reflected in their reviews.  My friend Lanny is the guy that imports Trooper (along with countless other amazing foreign beers we see in the US market). He's a big fan and can tell you why it's an awesome beer (minus the marketing part of having Iron Maiden's name on it).

So I did some research and figured I wouldn't find any - It was well after the release month. On a whim, I checked inventory at a shop (maybe 4-6 months after the release drop) that was a bit out of the way for most people and they had 4 bottles available - It wasn't totally in the middle of nowhere or even a small shop by any means, but apparently they don't have the consumer base to swipe big ""expensive"" limited beers.

About the size of a living room, boxes stacked wherever they can fit. That kind of place. I knew they were going to have some Westvleteren and Fullers Vintage, which convinced me to go. Then about an hour before I left for the event, I saw this blog post from them: http://www.berlinbiershop.com/2015/06/heady-topper-at-berlin-bier-shop.html  Needless to say, I was pretty surprised, especially knowing how hard it is to get even in the US. The story went that the brewer at Alchemist (John ...) took a fresh batch to a beer festival in Poland and they didn't sell out. The owner of the Berlin store was offered the beers at 9€ a can and rejected them, saying he can't make his customers pay that. A few days later the organisers came back with a cheaper offer, and voila, HT in Berlin, Germany."

In other words, the bottles you offered to pay half for were probably technically still ""fresh"" in their stock system for a few more days because they were within code.

Not like it's an IPA or something that's better when fresh.  I usually start drinking the fall seasonals the last week of August or the first week of football season.

Even if they start going downhill after 3 months, you'd have until October 15th to drink whatever you bought now.  I guess I just don't see seasonal creep as the huge deal everyone makes it out to be. Somewhat odd to start thinking about fall in mid-July, but not too many practical downsides."

beer,3dbmz0,forza_racer,2,Thu Jul 16 03:09:50 2015 UTC,"Feel like I have to explain this every year.    Sam Adams figured out that people stopped buying winter beers the moment Christmas ends.  This left them with a metric fuckton of beer just sitting on shelves that no one was buying because they thought ""hey, let's start releasing these beers right before Thanksgiving as that's when people will be drinking them"" not knowing that no one would be buying that beer come December 26th.    To counter this, they moved up their spring releases to January because seasonal releases are big movers and they needed something to fill the gap between their winter release and their old schedule for Spring releases which was in February or March before.    This led to the other seasonal releases to be pushed up and the rest of the industry, specifically with Pumpkin beers, followed suit.    TL;DR:  To make sure that their beers don't sit on shelves breweries will release their seasonal beers sometimes months before the season actually begins, as once the season passes those beers are no longer purchased."
beer,3dbmz0,Timma05,3,Wed Jul 15 14:50:26 2015 UTC,"I talk to most of the sales reps to do beer ordering for the store I work at. They handle the cheap stuff but I have input on the nicer beers. One of the distributor's sales reps is very knowledgeable, so I asked him - why the hell do breweries insist on putting out their pumpkin beers so early?  Well, it's actually pretty simple. The problem is that a lot of people drink pumpkin beer, but the window of time you have to sell them is small indeed. Because once the average consumer has had their fill of pumpkin beer, they stop buying it until next year. So every brewery is forced to put theirs out a bit earlier - lest the consumer is already bored of pumpkin beers by the time theirs hits the shelf.  Obnoxious? yeah. but so are pumpkin beers in general."
beer,3dbmz0,chewie23,2,Wed Jul 15 02:22:32 2015 UTC,"IMO pumpkin beers die on Halloween. For whatever reason people don't associate pumpkin beer with fall but with Halloween and the other major fall style is Oktoberfest which also dies around the same time. So if you want to sell x amount the earlier you put it out the better. And people don't realize Beer seasons have far more to do with the anticipation of a season rather than the actual season. Winter beer stop moving in January, Summer beers are already slowing down, and nobody has ever cared about a spring beer."
beer,3dbmz0,Mrbuckeye,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:48:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a few years ago it wasn't so bad, but with the explosion of the craft beer market and subsequently the increase in number of pumpkin beers, they are all trying to beat each other to the punch.  Additionally, a lot of the smaller breweries that did limited release would only release ""X number of barrels/cases/bombers"", Southern Tier at least more than doubled those numbers last year if I remember correctly so released earlier and were in stores much later. Ah well, knowledgeable people will stock up with what they need."

Even berliners can be all over the map from mild to super sour. Not sure what is appropriate. But they tent to be low in alcohol and refreshing. Not overly complex, strong or super sour.   I would seek out some Rodenback or Liefmans Goudenband (comes wrapped in paper) both will run you around $10 for a 750ml."
beer,3df5eb,mizary1,2,Thu Jul 16 13:42:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar with the beer/brewery, but ""sweaty sock"" sounds like they used Brettanomyces (a wild yeast) at some point in fermentation. This yeast creates musty, barnyard, and hay type flavored and aromas, some even border sweaty clothes.  This is a way to make a sour ale since the beer has been soured with a wild yeast. However, if you're looking for a more tart flavor, look for beers that use a blend of the bacteria Lactobacillus ( same bacteria in yogurt) or Pediccocus. Traditional styles that may use these bacteria are: Flanders Red, Flanders Brown and Berliner Weisse (def Lacto), among a few others that escape me and I'm on mobile so can't look up properly. Those aforementioned styles are traditional to Europe, both Flanders from Belgium and Berliner from Germany. Try Rodenbach or Duchesse de Borgogne for Flanders Red and any Berliner you can find.  American sours using lacto or Pediccocus may actually say it on the label somewhere. American sours are more eclectic and therefore are harder to pinpoint. But if you want to avoid that ""sweaty"" Brett character, avoid beers that may mention it, since most usually do. Since I don't know where you're located, not sure what to recommend since I don't know what is distributed by you. Best bet is to look up some local breweries and see what sour ales they're making. If you have questions, you can ask and I'm sure they'll give you more info.  Hope this helps."

I've had Deep Ellum IPA, which is pretty great, from Texas but I don't know if that's available to you either.  Edit: When shopping for IPAs, freshness is key to maximum hoppiness.

beer,3dcs1n,Mattybz28,3,Wed Jul 15 18:46:10 2015 UTC,"This is actually a very important concept to be aware of that took me a while to figure out on my own. I don't think it makes sense at all for someone to reply to your post with only ONE specific IPA to recommend, because without knowing more, you might think it's representative of all IPAs, and of course that's impossible. In my experience (I'm still learning), IPAs generally fall into one or two of these categories with the following dominant traits: (a) bitterness, (b) grapefruit (sometimes I associate with bitterness), (c) tropical fruit, (d) piney/grassy/resiny/earthy/floral, and (e) malty. This is a huge range of flavors. For example, west coast-style IPAs (read: not all IPAs from the west coast follow this style, and not all beers of this style are from the west coast) will probably have dominant bitterness + grapefruit character. I personally like tropical fruit flavored beers with less bitterness (you'll eventually learn that these can come from a process called ""dry-hopping""). ""Malty"" in general means the hop character (any of the first three traits) are generally more subdued. And then, the more you try, you might find common hop varieties that you might like. For example, I've come to know that citra, mosaic, and azacca tend to give the fruity character than I enjoy. Finally, it has been mentioned before, the freshness cannot be stressed enough for IPAs. Call me a snob but I avoid drinking IPAs bottled > 2 months after the bottling date. Local is your best bet for finding fresh stuff, so keep that in mind if you're east coast and you're getting all these west coast recommendations (Lagunitas, Stone, Sierra Nevada, Firestone Walker, etc).  So basically, I highly recommend you try a variety of IPAs to determine what kind you really like. If Two Hearted Ale was the first IPA I tried, I wouldn't bother drinking another IPA again, because I didn't know a different IPA could taste so drastically different (it was too malty for my taste)."

Boulevard Single Wide IPA - Also pretty mellow, with some more fruity notes. I haven't seen it in a while though, not sure if they still make it...  I also suggest exploring more regular Pale Ales:  Founders Pale Ale and Lagunitas New Dogtown Pale Ale are both quite delicious, and are a bit different than SN's Pale. Also, both Founders and Lagunitas IPAs are also really great examples of the style, so it might not be a bad idea to try those next."

beer,3dcs1n,walnut_of_doom,2,Wed Jul 15 19:03:09 2015 UTC,"They can all use any variety or combinations of hops, though the varieties use may depend on regional styles.  PA = lower alcohol (4.5% - 6%), usually lighter body, hop bitterness is fairly balanced with the malt. English Pale Ales are even more balanced, while American Pale Ales (APAs) are usually slightly more hop-forward, still with a decent malt presence.  IPA = medium alcohol (6% - 7.5%), light to medium body, even more hop bitterness. English-style IPAs usually have a bit more malt presence, and tend to use more herbal hops, while American IPAs tend to use more citrusy, piney, and floral hops, usually w/ minimal malt character.  DIPA = high alcohol (8% - 9.5%), heavier body, high maltiness, w/ high levels of hops to balance out the malt sweetness. Not necessarily the most bitter of the bunch, as some of them can be fairly sweet due to the heavier malt. Alcohol taste may be present.  Session IPA = fairly new style, low alcohol (4% - 5%), very light body. While it uses a low amount of hops, the lack of prominent malt character (which gives it the light body) can potentially give it a higher perceived bitterness than the others."

beer,3dcs1n,letsgetbrickfaced,2,Thu Jul 16 18:40:17 2015 UTC,I'd suggest Dogfish Head 60 minute. It was my first IPA and is very mild with the hop taste in my opinion.

I'll have to get down to Kane more, they're in my general vicinity (lol, i was raised with a generous definition of ""vicinity"" when it comes to breweries....) so it's really ridiculous that I haven't been there before. I did Carton instead when I was last bored in new jersey because I'd heard they do sour stuff, but their IPA didn't knock my socks off."

To each their own I guess.  If I don't want something too bitter (still 50% of the time) I usually go for a Belgian beer (love me some tripels en quads). What are your favorite (not too bitter) beers?"
beer,3ddwuo,Avason,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:43:16 2015 UTC,"If you're into wheat beer, I'd check out Washita Wheat from Mustang Brewery. It's made with red wheat instead of the usual white wheat. Gives it much more of a smoky flavor and makes it a bit heavier than traditional American wheat ale."
beer,3ddwuo,FrostySt,3,Sun Jul 19 19:31:49 2015 UTC,"I have a pretty shit sense of smell, and that has a knock-on effect on my sense of taste.  I like big, flavorful things in general, because they have enough oomph to really register, while more ""delicate"" foods/drinks just come across as kind of bland to me much of the time.  I don't much like session IPAs, for example, because they just taste like watered down crap to me.  Even many single IPAs, unless they're really bold, seem kind of... eh.  They have a place, but they're not a go-to style of beer for me unless I expect to be sharing.  Sometimes I want a really hoppy beer, sometimes I don't.  If I want a really hoppy beer, sometimes I'm after mostly hop aroma and want a lighter taste, and sometimes I want my ears blown back by hop bitterness.  Either way, I usually lean towards big beers, and I'd say I more often lean towards more balanced beers than hoppy ones.  An interesting one recently for me was trying Ruination 2.0 from Stone.  It is, to me, a far more complex and balanced beer than the original, and a superior beer by nearly any measure.  However, it doesn't have the same brick-of-hops-upside-the-head punch that the original Ruination had.  I'd say 80-90% of the time I'd prefer to drink 2.0 if I had to choose between just the two (not that it's really possible, but still), and 10-20% of the time I'd miss the punch the original had in spite of the fact that it's a more one-dimensional beer."
beer,3ddwuo,Omophorus,4,Wed Jul 15 17:19:57 2015 UTC,"Well-balanced for sure. Usually, a beer that balances bitterness with fruitiness for me (Barberie's lime and raspberry pale ale, Brasseurs du Monde's raspberry pale ale). Lately I've been going after sour beers, though."

I haven't had most of the beers on this list but I can say omission is miles ahead of anything new planet or Green's has been making.   That said, Omission's brown ale is weak."
beer,3dcz0l,DocCalculus,2,Wed Jul 15 15:35:38 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think their label says ""gluten removed."" So it's probably that process whereby they add something that converts the gluten. So they can't technically say it's ""gluten free."" A person with Celiac Disease couldn't have it, but others with gluten allergy can enjoy Omission. Or myself. On a funny side note: If 'that the case, the name wouldn't be accurate, they're not omitting gluten, but converting. hehe"
beer,3dcz0l,DocCalculus,2,Wed Jul 15 16:42:40 2015 UTC,"Don't know if you saw, but a user posted further down about a family member with celiac who is able to enjoy Omission.

beer,3dcz0l,cynosureskater,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:20:48 2015 UTC,"Somebody correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that's the case with all gluten-free beers.   Stone published the gluten count test results and it's truly minimal. I was surprised they didn't just say ""free"" in the same way you can say ""fat free"" or ""zero calorie"".  Are the other beers literally 0.00%?"
beer,3dcz0l,bgrueyw,2,Wed Jul 15 16:47:09 2015 UTC,"I think if it says Gluten-free, then it is free of all Gluten. Stone's Delicious was crafted to remove gluten, but since there are still trace amounts, they can't say Gluten-free, but rather Gluten reduced, and even recommend not drinking in if your are Gluten-intolerant, however miniscule the amount of gluten there may be.

beer,3dcz0l,tricheboars,3,Wed Jul 15 20:22:44 2015 UTC,"The gluten-free craze was kind of lame, but was also super helpful to those with true allergies.

Then, he says:   There's a similar situation today with craft beers   How is finding local craft beers in airports anything like not knowing that Coors is a cheap, national brand?  This article could just be the headline, and you'd get the same amount of good information from it."
beer,3dfrbj,theultrayik,-1,Thu Jul 16 00:17:54 2015 UTC,"The author was in college in 1986, which was the year coors reach national distribution. Coors was considered ahead of it's time and sought after. Once everyone had coors there was nothing special about it.

beer,3dfrbj,theultrayik,-2,Thu Jul 16 02:40:04 2015 UTC,"To your first point, even if that was the case, it still doesn't make what I said wrong.  The author actually told us that he was excited about Coors until he found out people were drinking it everywhere.  Not based on taste or any other kind of merit.  Simply because he thought it was supposed to be exclusive.   As to your second point:   The author is making the point that craft beer is hype and that once everyone tries it, it loses its luster.    The author literally does not say or allude to this anywhere in the article.  You made this up all on your own.  The author merely states that craft beers can now be found in some airports, and he encourages people to try as many as they can."
beer,3dfrbj,Blabberman23,0,Thu Jul 16 04:40:43 2015 UTC,"To your first point...it still doesn't make what I said wrong.   I was never trying to prove you wrong, I was merely trying to highlight the purpose of the Coors analogy. I was challenging your point that at the time Coors was cheap and a national brand like it is today, because it used to not be cheap and highly sought after.   This analogy serves no purpose other than to allude to what he truly thinks of the ultimate fate of craft beer. If he wanted to write an article about how great craft beer is and its wide availability, he could have done that without bringing up Coors. The author states that:   ""Consider [craft beer] the 21st century version of my high school Coors obsession.""    He ties back the analogy he had made with his new claim about craft beer. He is not saying, and I am not saying, that craft beer sucks and is not something to be fussed about. All I am saying, and highlighting, is the point that craft beer boils down to hype and that Fremont brewery is no better than 3 floyds Brewery, or any other. However, eventually craft brewers will meet the same fate as Coors, where it is common and loses value because it is a ""cheap national brand"".  I failed to specify my point that:   once everyone tries it, it loses its luster.   to mean that once I try some highly sought after beer, I can find a similar clone by a brewery near me. I am fortunate enough to live in Seattle so I am privileged to try a plethora of amazing beer.  I don't think people are willing to acknowledge that craft beer is a bubble and will pop and crash. Only the best breweries will survive and become the next ""Coors"" and ""Budweiser"". My guess is that a silly tax will be proposed that will cripple the craft community and only let the big fish survive. I am hoping that this happens after I die."

beer,3dcmur,ClydeDog,2,Wed Jul 15 16:25:41 2015 UTC,"The beer was either force carbonated improperly or there was too much yeast added and secondary fermentation happened to the point where too much CO2 formed inside the cans.   You should be able to bring the beer back to the place you bought it from and get a refund/replacement. Either that, or email 21st Amendment and they'll make it right."
beer,3dcmur,southsCLT,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:06:51 2015 UTC,"Temperature could also be a factor. If the beer is warm, less CO2 stays dissolved, increasing pressure."
beer,3dcmur,34679,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:18:36 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter how much yeast is there, what you're thinking of is too much sugar. Whatever yeast is there is going to ferment out any (fermentable) sugar present to create CO2 and a small amount of alcohol when bottle conditioning.   This is all a bit irrelevant though because canned beers aren't carbonated via refermentation. They're carbonated in a brite tank in the brewery then transferred to the cans and capped on a crown of foam to force out any air and replace it with CO2.   What likely happened was either a batch was carbonated and canned before fermentation completed and there was some unanticipated refermentation in the can, or some wild yeast/bacteria got into the beer that is capable of fermenting sugars that the yeast strain at the brewery couldn't chew through."
beer,3dcmur,Elk_Man,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:48:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think 21A does, but I don't see a reason canned beers couldn't be carbonated via refermentation?"
beer,3dcmur,mathtronic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:48:08 2015 UTC,I don't think cans can take the increase in pressure the way glass bottles can. The increased pressure from carbonated beer off gassing a bit of CO2 that's already in suspension is much lesser than the increase from going 0-2.5 volumes of CO2 when conditioning.

Whatever the issue was with bottles could be the same issue with the cans.  With homebrew it's most commonly the result of overcarbonating or bottling before the beer is fully terminal. In a production beer it could still be overcarbonating or infection.  Definitely let 21A know. Brewers want to get these things right and won't know to fix it if they don't hear about issues."

beer,3damii,YJ87,2,Tue Jul 14 21:14:33 2015 UTC,"Congratulations!  Lagunitas is my favorite brewery! Not only is all of the beer top quality, they are also a great company with a nice laid-back approach.    Lagunitas Sucks, one of their IPAs, is a great one to start with from them. It's super piney and citrusy, while being insanely drinkable as well. It is distributed in 32oz bottles for most of the year, although it comes in six packs for a few months out of the year.    Lagunitas Nightime Ale is my personal favorite from the brewery. It's a black IPA done extremely well. Big tropical fruit notes on the nose and a nice roasted chocolate taste on the back end. Look for this one in the Winter.     If you like Barleywines, Laguintas Undercover Shutdown Ale and Brown Shugga will be your best friends. Brown Shugga is out in the Fall and Undercover in the Spring. Both are strong brews almost reaching 10%, but are they are smooth at the same time. Brown Shugga is sweet like the name implies while Undercover is more hop-forward.     That being said, the only beer I have had from Laguintas that I haven't been very impressed with is Censored. Just not my cup of tea I guess. But really, anything you take home from this brewery will deliver.   As far as Oskar Blues, their Ten Fidy stout is out of this world. I'm pretty sure it's one of the top rated beers on BA, and for good reason! It is super smooth for the ABV (10.5 like the name implies) and has amazing flavor.   Pinner has been one of my favorite low ABV beers this Summer. It has a nice vegetal/dank quality to it that I love.   Old Chub on nitro is a nice treat. It comes in 16oz cans and tastes like a tootsie roll, in a good way.   Enjoy!"

beer,3damii,acerv,2,Wed Jul 15 00:01:39 2015 UTC,"Everyone is kind of just listing everything from Lagunitas (which isn't wrong since nearly all of their beers are good).   The individual ones you should try are the Cappucino Stout (great beer made even better by the fact that it's price point is insanely good even as far out as Iowa)  Equinox is extremely tasty. Hard to find Pale Ale's with as creamy a mouthfeel as this stuff.  And Nightime. Malty sweet dark fruit flavors with great hop presence.  Those would be my top 3. But as I said before, they're all good."

I know they were imported so that costs more but I think all those local breweries make a better and in this case cheaper product. That being said drink what you like and if you love Heineken go to town. Cheers!  It seems like pricing at my store is on the high end or something is up could be MA taxes.

beer,3dagjq,AnOldHope,3,Tue Jul 14 19:29:24 2015 UTC,"Full text from the Petrol Station's Facebook when this went down:   Unfortunately, we will not have BB10 today. We love Saint Arnold and the excitement the Bishop Barrel series carries on a local level is a huge indicator of the strength and growth of craft beer in Houston. However, two weeks ago, with no notice, Silver Eagle distributors (saint Arnold's distributor) raised their keg deposits from $50 to $60. In 5 years we have seen their keg deposits go from $25 to $60 as well as multiple keg price increases. We also have learned that they intended to raise keg deposits from $60 to $70 in September. The reason for this increase? ABI (Budweiser) raised their keg deposits to silver eagle to $70 because kegs shells were going missing from large accounts (stadiums, kegs sold to individuals from retailers). So basically, punish small craft beer businesses for macro incompetence. We have joined with our friends the Flying Saucer, hay merchant, mongoose vs cobra, to boycott silver eagle. However, that means not purchasing Saint Arnold, Karbach, Sierra, Firestone, 8th wonder, and other brands we love. Bottom line, if we don't take a stand, big business is going to destroy craft beer. We have seen it in the last 2 years with ABinbev buying Craft breweries so they can lower prices on portfolio beers like goose islands core brands making it harder for craft breweries to compete on a retail level. Also craft breweries resorting to macro tactics such as moving placed package at grocery stores, offering sales incentives to take other craft breweries taps at bars, and suing each other. This was an industry built on going against the grain, not following the macros but proudly saying ""fuck you, we're nothing like you"". As a retailer, we are the last stop before that delicious craft beer gets to you, the beer drinker, the reason we do this. Our costs have gone up on everything for the last 10 years. Rent, kegs, keg deposits, utilities, fuel charges, you name it, but we raised our prices only one time. We are taking this stand so that 5 years from now, you are not paying $12 for a pint of saint Arnold lawnmower. Let's hope Silver Eagle does the right thing and we want all the breweries affected to know we love them and hope this resolves quickly so we can get back to drinking beer. Cheers."

We were pretty shocked to hear they were going up that much and have heard of huge backlash in many Houston bars.

Some folks may order it specifically because of the Paterno reference.  Other people might disapprove of the beer and discontinue support of the brewery to express their displeasure.    This isn't particularly crude or obnoxious, so I guess it sits in an area where people will probably have different feelings about it.  Calling an DIPA ""The Palette Molester"" with artwork of Sandusky would definitely be in poor taste.

Newest and some of it shows in their brews.  Not a knock as its my go-to brewery out there.  Have a Arrogant Bastard copy beer last time I was there.  Very, very good.    Old Bust Head-  A bit of a pain to get to, but surprisingly furnished for its location and very busy.  Only have been once.

They don't really have any flagship beer, so  what they have on tap differs everytime you go there.  Sometimes they are pretty good, sometimes they are not great.

The beers are very interesting and several are great.  They focus on barrel aging and experimental flavors that constantly shift.  Also, Lost Rhino, Old Ox, and Ocelot in Ashburn, VA are excellent.  Lost Rhino is a mature brewery and they just started making some sours. Bad Wolf are a great crew and they have a constantly shifting mix - some solid, some mediocre.

beer,3d9nvd,fogindex,5,Tue Jul 14 18:14:15 2015 UTC,"My recommendation would be go to pubs will a good selection of hand pulls, ask the guy which ales are good, possibly mention you prefer a hoppy beer, try them all, move to next pub...   I wouldn't really recommend the larger, mostly you find pubs and bars serve two kinds, ""cheep"" ones like Carlsberg or Fosters and ""premium"" ones like Peroni or Stella, but they are all mass produced and fairly flavourless. You might see the odd ""craft"" larger from smaller breweries which can be alright but they are a quite rare."

beer,3d9nvd,CptBigglesworth,3,Tue Jul 14 22:53:16 2015 UTC,"Go to a pub serving real ale, and try out all the beers. Because British beers are usually brewed to be sessionable, you can easily try 4 to 5 different beers without getting drunk.  Beer-wise, I can't really give you a recommendation, because beer is very local. You will more likely find Timothy Taylor, Theakston's or Black Sheep up north, local ""large"" breweries like Brains in Wales, and something like Fuller's, Sharp's, Ringwood, or Shepherd Neame in the south.  Plenty of pubs are tied, i.e. owned by a brewery, so often you will only find their beer on hand pumps, and maybe one guest ale. Look out for freehouses, they usually go through a greater variety of beer (there are exceptions, of course, like The Harp in London, which is Fuller's-owned, but Fuller's only occupies one out of 8 or 9 pumps).  When it comes to hoppy British ales, my personal favorite at the moment is Thornbridge. Their Jaipur IPA is top-notch, and the Wild Swan is a fantastically refreshing hoppy golden ale, but as I said, availability wildly varies and is very local, so you'll more likely find them bottled.  But don't overcomplicate things: just go to a pub, try out what they have, if you don't like it, move on to the next pub. My experience has been that there's always something to discover in a pub. The most unlikely places will randomly have a single cask of some fantastic beer from some teen-tiny local brewery, which you'll afterwards never find again."

I ask because Texas is far from as simple as you have it listed. The individual cities make the local liquor laws and they do crayon what's sold and what's not. For a long time Dallas had a split where liquor store were only allowed on one side of the city (may still be true, I try to avoid Dallas). Irving, one of Dallas's biggest suburbs was dry until a few years ago. A lot of cities that allow beer sales do not allow wine sales.

And Chilly mart was Born. In the 80's that was the only place to get beer within a 20-30 mile radius they did an assload of business.

They may do so for both or either on and off-premises consumption. There are still dry towns in Maine.  Sundays do have restrictions on hours of sale, they arent allowed to sell til later in the morning, although I dont remember what the official time is.  New Years Eve, liquor sales are permitted til 2am.  There is currently a movement trying to get liquor sales permitted until 2am during the summer as well.  Random WTF rules:   Establishments selling liquor may not be within 300 feet of an existing school or church  You legally cannot sell more than 2 beverages to a customer.

In most states there are variances in liquor laws between counties/parishes.  For example, in Louisiana:   Bar closing time listed as ""none"".  In East Baton Rouge Parish, its 2:00am.  In New Orleans, there is no closing time. Sunday restrictions also listed as ""none"".  In many parishes you can buy beer after a certain time (noon usually), but not wine or liquor.  In some you can buy all three, but in a reduced time window compared to other days.  In a few, there are no restrictions at all.   Don't get me wrong, this is a great collection of information.  People just need to be aware that this should only be used as a basic guide and not the definitive guide statewide."

Only thing that sucks is bar hours, but I'm not in the bar scene anyways.   Missouri:   One of the most alcohol-permissive states, perhaps only behind Nevada and Louisiana:  No open container law.[50] No state public intoxication law. Liquor control law[51] covers all beverages containing more than 0.5% alcohol, without further particularities based on percentage.[52] Cities and counties are prohibited from banning off-premises alcohol sales.[53] No dry jurisdictions. State preemption of local alcohol laws which do not follow state law. Certain bars in Kansas City and St. Louis grandfathered into the ability to double as liquor stores. Special licenses available for bars and nightclubs which allow selling alcohol until 3:00am in Kansas City,[54] Jackson County,[55] North Kansas City,[55] St. Louis,[56] and St. Louis County.[57] Grocery stores, drug stores, and even gas stations may sell liquor without limitation other than hours.[58]  Patrons allowed to take open containers out of bars in Kansas City's Power & Light District.[59] Parents and guardians may furnish alcohol to their children.[60] Missourians over 21 may manufacture up to 100 gallons of any liquor per year for personal use, without any further state limitation, state taxation, or state license.[61] (Obtaining a permit from the Federal Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau and meeting other requirements under federal law probably still is required for private citizens to manufacture distilled alcohol - but not wine or beer - for personal use.[62][63][64][65][66])   Missouri law recognizes two types of alcoholic beverage: liquor, which is any beverage containing more than 0.5% alcohol except ""non-intoxicating beer""; and ""non-intoxicating beer,""[67] which is beer containing between 0.5% and 3.2% alcohol. Liquor laws[68] apply to all liquor, and special laws apply to ""non-intoxicating beer.""[67]"

beer,3d46in,chrwei,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:37:35 2015 UTC,"I think someone already pointed out how MA is not correct. We have a weird system, some gas stations sell beer/wine (bought some yesterday at a Sunoco), some grocery stores sell beer/wine, and then of course there's tons of liquor stores that sell beer/wine/liquor. It's a # of licenses thing. Supposedly it prevents a monopoly, Wal-Mart can't open liquor stores at every Wal-Mart in MA and drive out mom and pop stores.  Second, RI does not have happy hour so to speak. That DBR regulation you linked to says that drinks cannot be offered for a cheaper price than they are normally offered M-F until 6pm and Friday at 6pm through Sunday (aka, the entire weekend). So outside those times you must sell a beer for the same price. A Narragansett is $3 at 4pm on a Tuesday, it has to be that price after 6pm on a Wednesday. So, bars around here have like monthly specials, all day, which is ok with the DBR reg, which says drink specials must stay the same for all the above described times."

Actually with all the craft examples it would be great to use really small brands, but I doubt all respondents would know who Pilot Brewing or Luckie Ales are for example.  And yeah there's definitely a lot of shitty craft beer. Especially IPAs are victims of ""lets throw hops at this and see what happens"" and then it ends up being bitter and uninteresting.

I went last year now that I live in Denver and it's fun to try new things, but you definitely end up getting waster.  It's almost worth the trip just to do all of the other events around the city during that week."

It's a great event, you will have a bunch of r/beer folks tell you it's overpriced, crowded, blah blah... but its a frickin party with thousands of beers. Once will probably be enough but it is truly a magical event for a beer lover. Plus the entire week has so many great events in Denver- you will drink so much amazing beer.   Tips- Don't plan on driving. Eat food. Make a strategy for the first hour or two and then forget it. Chat with all the fine people in the industry, look for cool events in Denver on the days surrounding the session.

beer,3d9q0f,OleWorm,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:47:58 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd say it complements the session—there are only about 30 beers poured at F2T, but each brewery pairs up with a notable beer-focused restaurant (last year, chefs from Monk's Kettle and Alla Spina, were involved, for example) to showcase beer and food pairings. Some breweries bring out beers only for F2T. Anyway, there's only a few hundred tickets available, so it's comfortable and the food was pretty good (even if sometimes the pairings don't quite work)."
beer,3d9q0f,turlian,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:17:39 2015 UTC,Does this mean you can't try the other beers at GABF and you only try the 30 at F2T?
beer,3d9q0f,Autonomoose,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:32:52 2015 UTC,"No, it's an add-on—you have to have a ticket to a session in order to get a ticket to F2T. So, you're getting 30 additional beers that aren't on the GABF main floor."

""Old timer"" neckbeards like me who drank first-wave (pre-21st century) craft have been burned many times, and these wounds run deep. Fruit and other adjuncts have a well-deserved stigma.  I know that Magic Hat #9 has its fans but it's not picking up new drinkers. Sales did not explode when the new ownership expanded its market. People don't become Spice Girls fans anymore, either—their moment is over.  Elsewhere in the fruit-in-beer world, there's the crafty beer push for wedges of fruit in beers like Blue Moon and Widmer Hefe. Weirdly the people at CBA think that they just need to bang the drum a little harder for ""Oregon's Favorite Craft Beer"", add a shandy variant, and call it a day. If it nudges volume sales a bit, then it does the opposite for whatever mindshare it has left, and let's remember who put them where they are.  Another adjunct nightmare was coffee. You whippersnappers probably never had Red Hook Double Black, a collaboration with an up-and-coming coffee chain called Starbucks. Peanut butter and chocolate the combination was not.  Lagers… all craft beer was ale, all macro garbage was lager. Case closed, amirite?  I was on those front lines. Some did not survive. Many who did still live with the trauma and flashbacks. I've adjusted to peacetime—mostly—but if I like Grapefruit Sculpin, I still say to hell with pumpkin peach, watermelon wheat, banana barley, rutabaga rye, or whatever. That's still too real.

beer,3d6hqt,tysnowboard,2,Tue Jul 14 04:14:04 2015 UTC,In terms of taste? there probably isn't a discernible difference.

beer,3d6hqt,brettyv82,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:42:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Some IPAs like Heady use yeast that help accentuate the tropical notes of the hops, but in general you want a really neutral yeast fermented on the cool side in order to not impart a lot of esters. So, in theory, an IPL and an IPA would be mostly identical if they had the same hopping schedule. Plus, we're in love with late-hopping these days, which really overwhelms any other flavors present in the beer that might otherwise differentiate an ale from a lager."

beer,3d0w62,Tarantio,4,Mon Jul 13 05:21:46 2015 UTC,The same logic should apply to Budweiser which came from the town of Budweis in the Czech Republic.
beer,3d0w62,explohd,6,Mon Jul 13 00:43:31 2015 UTC,"Budwieser (AB) has nothing to do with with Budweis. Except the name, which was stolen from the real Budwieser brewery that is still putting out great beer. You'll find them as Czcechvar in most countries, due to AB winning an expensive lawsuit."
beer,3d0w62,DaveIsLame2,5,Mon Jul 13 02:06:51 2015 UTC,"I thought that lawsuit was still going on.  Edit: Its way more complicated than I thought.   According to the British Budweiser Budvar website, ""Currently [in 2012] there are about 40 trademark dispute cases pending in different jurisdictions and some 70 procedural issues up for consideration around the world"".  Until January 2013, the Czech Budweiser Budvar won 89 of the 124 dealt cases with the American Budweiser (eight ended in a draw or conciliation).   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budweiser_trademark_dispute"
beer,3d0w62,Farty_McFartFart,6,Mon Jul 13 02:16:51 2015 UTC,"Budweiser has everything to do with Budweis. If we look at the naming history on the Budweiser wikipedia page:   Beer has been brewed in Budweis since it was founded by king Ottokar II of Bohemia in 1245. The name Budweiser is a derivative adjective, meaning ""of Budweis"". In 1876, Adolphus Busch and his friend Carl Conrad, a liquor importer, developed a ""Bohemian-style"" lager, inspired after a trip to the region.   In fact, in a trademark dispute in 1880 American Bud won the trademark dispute, but the judge said:   The statement on the label explains that it was not made at Budweis, but by the Budweiser process. Whether there was anything peculiar to Budweis about this process or not, it seems that this beer was really made as beer is made in Budweis — of the best barley and hops, and with the same preparation of the mash.   I see nothing to do with the name of the company in Bohemia and everything to do with the town."

However it does need brett brux and/or brett L and whether or not the right strain can be picked up elsewhere is still a little debatable.  (edited to add brett L)

The author of the article could have talked in general about how people misuse the term, instead he chose to specifically single her out which needlessly makes her look like an idiot. It's not like he needed a concrete example of someone calling an American wild ale a ""lambic"", we all know it's ubiquitous.  Singling out a certain person in this style wouldn't be an issue if it wasn't the internet. On the internet, people are relentless, and tons of people who would otherwise sit there silently have no problem typing up a bunch of mean shit without thinking twice. A mention like this is more than it would take to get a lot of twitter harassment from others."

As the commenter said above, she could've just said, ""Hey, here's a differing opinion ... Let's talk about this -- what do you all think?"" to her thousands of followers and really cultivated a discussion, while privately said, ""Hey, you know this is how you made me feel when you made an example of me.""

I'm not sure why he can publicly single her out as the idiot that uses the term ""lambic"" when she's supposed to be privately upset about it. The issue is not that she has a different opinion, and your solution would not have helped."

beer,3d0w62,dHUMANb,26,Sun Jul 12 21:26:55 2015 UTC,"Its because she's a beer community pseudo-celebrity/public figure. If she can't handle any sort of criticism, especially criticism as petty as the correct use of the word lambic, then she is in the wrong business."
beer,3d0w62,-al,22,Sun Jul 12 18:47:28 2015 UTC,"Tweets are public, they're allowed to be publicly used. When you're stating an opinion in public, you're subjecting it to public scrutiny.   He did not at any point belittle anyone. He chose some real examples of what he was talking about to solidify his point beyond speculation. That's normal, expected, and not un-polite, much less offensive. This woman didn't take offense, she was pissy because she was wrong and wasn't mature enough to deal with it."
beer,3d0w62,SubcommanderMarcos,-15,Sun Jul 12 18:54:30 2015 UTC,"You are right that tweets are public, but I'd wager that his blog has a much bigger audience than the number of people who read that twitter exchange previously.   The analogy would be if in the middle of a classroom and the person next to you said something incorrect. A few people nearby might have heard what was said, so it's not like it was whispered in private. Then, in response to the wrong thing, you went up to the front of the class with a presentation covering all of the reasons why the other person was wrong, complete with a recording of them saying the wrong thing. On the internet, it's even worse, because anyone listening in can retaliate with negative commentary with minimal effort and virtually no chance of it following you around.  Technically there is nothing inherently belittling, but it's unnecessarily shining light on the person. I believe that the author is speaking to a general misuse of the term, but it comes off as a personal challenge to the woman.  I don't think she was pissy because she was wrong. In the first tweet response, by suggesting other examples like the IPA and RIS, she is admitting that ""US lambic"" is not the correct term."
beer,3d0w62,dtwhitecp,10,Sun Jul 12 21:10:31 2015 UTC,"That is a terrible analogy, and it's based on what you yourself called a wager, which is a bad way to go about things. Your very comment is posted on a public board. Not many people may pay attention to it, but then again, many could. You chose to accept that risk the moment you posted, as did I. A tweet can be completely ignored, as it can be retweeted a billion times, and the poster has no control over that. In fact, the very purpose of twitter is to get short messages to be as widespread as possible. That's the whole point. And a necessary condition that everyone accepts when they create a twitter account and post on it. It's vastly different than orally saying something and being heard by those within earshot.  Also   unnecessarily shining light on the person.   It is not. It's exemplifying his point. For example, though I'll be a slight hypocrite and not seek out sources so this doesn't become too long, I've recently seen a few conservative blogs trying to claim there is a ""pro post-birth abortion movement"" plaguing universities all over north and south america. All those which I read failed to point out a single real event to evidentiate this claim. The claim is thus reduced to pure speculation.  The blogger here, however, knows of this possibility, to solidify his point, that people are misusing the term lambic, he provided a few examples, previously agreed by their respective posters to be public reproducible data, that prove the phenomenom. This made his entire post more valid. Without belittling anyone, technically or otherwise.   The woman complaining is also apparently a known author, and as every author ever, she should be prepared for criticism. It's part of the job.  You don't want light shined on you, you don't stand right beneath the lamp."
beer,3d0w62,SubcommanderMarcos,-14,Sun Jul 12 21:34:36 2015 UTC,"Speaking of bad communication, it's not constructive to say ""your analogy is bad"" and describe something as ""a bad way to go about things"". You aren't explaining anything, just stating an opinion with no explanation or analysis to back it up.  Was this twitter exchange posted directly to reddit? The article written in response to the twitter exchange was. That's one fact that I take into consideration when I say that the blog has a bigger audience. I don't know for a sure, but the evidence points that way. Do you disagree?   The big difference between this scenario and the abortion thing is that nobody is in denial about how people misuse the term ""lambic"". We all know it happens. That's why it wasn't necessary to shine light directly on her. Does the author have the ability to do that? Yes. Were her comments public? Yes. Did they have to be featured in the article for his point to be made? Absolutely not. The author took it upon himself to significantly increase the exposure of her comments to prove something that didn't need to be proven, with the only side effect of it being that she now has a target on her head for criticism. You are right that it's a risk she took, but the utility of increasing that exposure is only to increase shame directed at her, so it's pointless unless that was the author's goal."
beer,3d0w62,dtwhitecp,8,Sun Jul 12 21:55:44 2015 UTC,"You aren't explaining anything, just stating an opinion with no explanation or analysis to back it up.   I'm not entirely sure why you actively removed the explanation from the sentence just so you could say I didn't explain what I meant.   Do you disagree?    Yes. Being posted to reddit is an eventuality, one that is possible both for the blog post and the tweet. Both posters knew of this possibility. It's part of stating things in public, they are, again, subject to public scrutiny.    We all know it happens.    Really? Everyone? All of us? Everyone ever knows of lambics, and the particularities of the term. Did you really just say that?   If that were even remotely true, the whole article, and the tweets that preceeded it, and followed it, and this thread, and the comments on the post, none of that would have happened. If the author felt absolutely no need to point out the misuse of the term, because, as you proposed, everyone knew that already, he wouldn't have had any point to make on that post, and wouldn't have made the post. If he had still made the post arguing something you propose to be obvious, it would've been completely irrelevant, and therefore ignored, or otherwise treated as irrelevant. The reaction to it has proven otherwise.   Also let me rephrase the ""taking a risk"" part. She accepted, as did all of us, by posting information of any sort in public communication channels, that said information can be used by anyone as they see fit. It is immature to put an opinion online and then complain that people responded to that opinion. And no, a blog post has no bigger audience than a tweet by default, I've said this, a tweet can be retweeted a billion times, a blog post can be read a billion times. That's like a rock band renting a stadium to play a gig, then complaining they were only expecting 15 people when the place filled up."

Having a blog/twitter doesn't give you carte blanche to say whatever you want. She is the one who made herself sound like an idiot by posting the original tweet.   I'm all for fostering an environment that is more friendly, but come on now. Jeff Alworth is passionate about beer and a regarded beer authority. He used her original comment as a jumping-off point to post commentary around a topic that anyone who has a beer website/book should be educated around.

beer,3d0w62,Jason_OT,11,Mon Jul 13 06:14:01 2015 UTC,"Why should ""brands"" be offered legal protections, but not places and traditions?"
beer,3d0w62,behindtheaegis,0,Mon Jul 13 01:40:52 2015 UTC,"Because brands are actually intellectual property and have far more exacting standards than any of the EU protected foods. The EC established these protections specifically because none of them qualified as trademarks, even before the EU existed.  As much as the EU would like it to be the case, there's really nothing special about where or who makes something. A master craftsman can come from anywhere, and modern science means he can use whatever ingredients, environments, and processes he (or she) wants anywhere in the world."
beer,3d0w62,Jason_OT,7,Mon Jul 13 02:05:31 2015 UTC,"So reverence to origin isn't important?  Idiosyncrasies that only the original technique and place can provide (native yeasts and bacterial cultures, for example) aren't important?  I guess that's your opinion and you're entitled to it, but I (and many others) find that important enough to create a distinction.  Besides, if imitators are just as good, what does it matter whether they have the label or not?  I guess I'm also confused why this bothers you so much."
beer,3d0w62,behindtheaegis,4,Mon Jul 13 02:18:54 2015 UTC,"So reverence to origin isn't important?    Not in the way you seem to think, no. Being able to use the proper term for a food produced by specific techniques with specific ingredients is revering that food's origin.   Idiosyncrasies that only the original technique and place can provide (native yeasts and bacterial cultures, for example) aren't important?   It's not that they're not important, it's that you're wrong in thinking they can only exist in the original location. It hasn't been true for decades.  Techniques and ingredients are, of course, important. They're what defines any type of food. They're also infinitely portable, especially in the modern age.   Besides, if imitators are just as good, what does it matter whether they have the label or not?   Because A) they're no more ""imitators"" than anyone producing a type of food in any region, and B) the label is what they're making. The EU protections do nothing to actually guarantee quality, they merely provide a false sense of quality assurance."

beer,3d0w62,LorenzoFirepower,4,Mon Jul 13 05:14:25 2015 UTC,Technically Lambic isn't based on location but rather process and ingredients.  But I disagree with you. I absolutely think there is merit in protecting them.
beer,3d0w62,Lukerules,6,Mon Jul 13 00:57:04 2015 UTC,The whole argument being made in the article here is that Lambic is still only valid when produced in the same region.
beer,3d0w62,Jason_OT,3,Mon Jul 13 03:13:58 2015 UTC,"The type protection it has ""isn't"" region specific technically.... To save me retyping this is an explanation from a blog post I did a while back.    By the definition, lambic needs to be a naturally cooled, spontaneously fermented beer, with specific final gravity, colour and bitterness (specifics can be found in the TSG application.) There is also a Belgian Royal Decree regarding the name which states it needs to have at least 30% unmalted wheat. While it isn’t bound by geography, like AOC protected products, it does still need to have the yeast strains Brettanomyces Bruxellenes and/or Lambicus. Two naturally occurring yeast strains named from Lambiek (a Belgian town) and Bruxelles (Brussels). Whether or not a brewer in Australia or the USA could pick up the same strains is something I don’t think anyone has looked at too in-depth. And whether or not if you just “inoculated” your brewhouse with it first by spraying it on the walls is probably a bit of a grey area. Considering Cantillon, seen to be the benchmark for many lambic styles, has done that very thing for their new building may suggest it’s ok?   TSG application: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:1997:021:0013:0014:EN:PDF  Horal/Royal Decree (Dutch) http://www.horal.be/en/lambic-gueuze-kriek/legal-protection  Original post: http://aleofatime.com/2015/04/01/matters-of-style-and-taste/"
beer,3d0w62,Lukerules,2,Mon Jul 13 04:58:41 2015 UTC,"So, in other words, there's nothing preventing Americans (or anyone else in the World) from making Lambics aside from some bureaucratic protectionism."
beer,3d0w62,Jason_OT,4,Mon Jul 13 05:05:41 2015 UTC,That depends if they can pick up the right strain or not really. If they can then yes.
beer,3d0w62,Lukerules,2,Mon Jul 13 05:28:13 2015 UTC,"I'd bet, given the nature of wild ales, the ""wrong"" strains are being used plenty in so-called authentic Lambics (in fact, the TSG application does not bar the ""wrong"" strains). Also that the difference between the ""right"" strains and many of the ""wrong"" ones will be imperceptible in the finished product.  But none of these EU protections are meant to have scientific backing in the first place, which is most of the problem."
beer,3d0w62,Jason_OT,4,Mon Jul 13 05:33:15 2015 UTC,"Read this for the full breakdown on what you'll find in a lambic. The different strains of brett definitely bring differences, just like different strains of other yeasts do too.   http://www.lambic.info/Microbiology_and_Biochemistry#Brettanomyces_dominance"
beer,3d0w62,Lukerules,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:41:41 2015 UTC,"None of that refers to specific strains of brett, just the range of flavors and aromas that can be created by them. That does not necessarily imply different strains are solely responsible, as a single strain's reaction to different ingredients will also create different flavors and aromas. Of course different strains can also create different profiles with the same ingredients, but these things are not mutually exclusive.  My point was that all this restriction to two strains of wild yeast is, if you'll excuse the pun, wildly misguided. It's not to say that different strains can't produce different flavor profiles, but to say many strains will produce imperceptibly different profiles. This is especially true with wild yeasts that are inherently more variable."
beer,3d0w62,Jason_OT,8,Mon Jul 13 06:00:37 2015 UTC,"All of these EU protected names are fucking stupid arguments.   Certainly not. These names have a reputation and are linked to more than just the product. Roquefort can only be roquefort if it has been aged in the caves it has been for centuries, a similar thing goes for Lambic. These names are linked the tradition, the history behind the name and the culture they come from as much as they are linked to the product.  If the product is good there's no need to use the protected name anyway, the product can sell itself. And if you think people are no longer fooled by cheap knock offs you don't live in the same reality as the rest of us."
beer,3d0w62,Aethien,4,Mon Jul 13 06:18:00 2015 UTC,"The thing is, these traditions can now be replicated anywhere on Earth. Species can be transplanted, environmental conditions can be replicated, even the water composition can be cloned.  Roquefort is not a brand name, it does not refer to a specific manufacturer or even really much of a specific process even though it is a style of cheese. Legally, it refers to any number of manufacturers doing almost anything they want as long as the cheese is aged in specific caves, with a specific fungus from those caves. Realistically, it's a process that can be replicated anywhere on Earth with the right fungus and conditions. If I make a cheese in the US, using penicillium roqueforti, and it's just as good or better than cheeses made the same was in France, there's no logical reason I shouldn't be able to accurately refer to the style of cheese I made.  Regardless of how good or bad the product is, it still needs to be described stylistically. That's what these protected names are. They're genericized styles, no matter how much the EC/EU have wanted otherwise for the past 20-25 years."

beer,3d2plm,jcxco,2,Mon Jul 13 05:27:31 2015 UTC,"I find myself appreciating the drinkability of them. They don't taste great, but they don't taste bad, necessarily, and you can keep going back for more, never really satisfied, but never overwhelmed either. They achieve what they're going for."
beer,3d2plm,NooklearToaster,5,Mon Jul 13 14:17:40 2015 UTC,No I feel the same way. Before I discovered craft beer I thought I hated beer. I wouldn't touch Budweiser or anything like it. Now I legitimately enjoy cheap beer. Narragansett tall boys have become a staple in my fridge.
beer,3d2plm,turkeypants,3,Mon Jul 13 03:57:33 2015 UTC,"Long ago, I was the same! I really didn't like beer at all. Then I was introduced to other craft styles. I actually hated, it thought I did, general American beer for a while."
beer,3d2plm,turkeypants,3,Mon Jul 13 04:30:22 2015 UTC,"The new general American beer seems to be IPA's. I'd take a macro over any IPA. I can do sour beers, sweet beers, tart beers, and flavored beers, but I cannot touch a bitter beer. Very few do I enjoy that have an IBU over 30. It makes beer shopping kinda depressing at the grocery store because it seems like 80% of the craft beer in stock is all IPA's."
beer,3d2plm,mathtronic,3,Mon Jul 13 15:32:26 2015 UTC,"I think there's definitely too much snobbery in beer circles. People slate the big-brand beers as undrinkable and terrible.

beer,3d2plm,turkeypants,5,Mon Jul 13 10:05:17 2015 UTC,"I think I've just learned to accept Macro Lagers for what they are, and not try to judge them by the same standards I use for craft beers.  Long day at work, or I've been outside, or helping a friend move or something. Hey, Allurex, you want a Budweiser? Fuck yes I do.  Don't overthink it, just enjoy it (if you want to).

I didn't drink any for years, and meanwhile was sampling craft beers far and wide and getting a lot better and picking out the different things I was tasting in any given beer. So after long enough, I figured I ought to go back and try the old lagers again just to make sure I wasn't being hipstery about disliking them. But nope, they were not only still bad, they were worse, and I was also better equipped to pick out the various reasons why. Multiple bad component flavors. Do not want."

beer,3d2plm,Tssjr225,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:04:22 2015 UTC,Curious in a not-at-all-judging kind of way what flavors about it don't work for you. It's fascinating to me how different people's tastes and perception of flavors is.
beer,3d2plm,cmrncstn,3,Mon Jul 13 23:20:12 2015 UTC,"It varies from beer to beer. I tested multiple - Bud, Bud Light, High Life, Icehouse, and PBR that I can remember. I don't know what I did with my notes, but I remember Bud just since I've mentioned it here a number of times in the past.   It had the aroma of wet cardboard crossed with bread, then some old popcorn and later a hint of something like a tired hard taco shell (even though they don't use corn), then this kind of weird sweet chemical candy flavoring that was also kind of a chemical perfume note of a non-food nature, which bled into a hint of a cousin aroma of acetone. These weren't in your face, but they were the ones I was able to pick out.  The taste was harder to pick apart, I guess just since it was that prototypical flavor that first registers in your brain as ""beer"" in your youth, but the primary thing I noticed was the wet cardboard flavor. There was also a little of that gross fake chemical sweetness (as opposed to actual -ose sweetness that would have been richer). It was of course lower flavor over all, but what was there I didn't want.  I do remember that one thing they did well was to make it sort of crisp so that after a sip, it truly evaporated off your tongue and left nothing, prompting and leaving the way clear to take another sip, and another. That would be important in any refreshing session-ish beer so I give them credit for that and for making something otherwise mostly balanced.   I remember High Life and PBR were both worse than Bud and worse than I remembered. I don't remember their off notes specifically but I remember the flavor being worse. I can't quite remember on Icehouse but I think I remember being less disappointed in that one, though I think it lacked some of the crispness of Bud, maybe was sweeter.  But overall, do not want. Bad aroma notes, bad flavor notes, and all of that in the context of being generally bland. Just a waste of time and a wasted beer opportunity. I hear people say, ""oh man, if you have it at the brewery really fresh, it's really great and so much better. But it seems to me that if your superslick, world-topping system can't get your beer from your brewery to your pet distributor to the high-turnover shelves of a grocery store to my mouth without going from this rumored deliciousness to these things I tried, you've got problems. Not putting much stock in that one. And as a third of this sub likes to remind us daily, the macros are nothing if not consistent, so I'm not chalking it up to a bad couple of weeks at the store over the course of my sampling either.  One caveat I will add is that the discovery of better beers years ago led me to revolt against this style of lager, much in the same way the entire American craft revival did. So if there are other companies out there making this same style of beer, maybe I'd dislike those too as opposed to just disliking the macro guys for whatever it is that they do that I don't like. Maybe it's just the style as opposed to the maker. But I'm just trying to allow for all possibilities here. I really don't care who makes it if I get things like wet cardboard, stale popcorn, chemical sweetness hints, and weird perfume notes. It's like the Jester King guy recently saying skunk is something he likes and wants in there. I'm never going to want that either, don't care what style."

beer,3d2plm,TakesJonToKnowJuan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:05:22 2015 UTC,"I'm a college student who just started trying a few different types of craft beers (because that's what we have around the house, now that I'm home for the summer.). It's obvious that these are superior to the cheap stuff I can afford to binge drink on my own money at school, but I'm still totally comfortable drinking PBR, Busch, and the like. Would you recommend I stick with an ""ignorance is bliss"" attitude and enjoy my Natty Ice years, or do you think it's worth it to get into tasting and analyzing  quality beers, even if it ruins the cheap shit for me? In other words, has it been worth it for you?    (sorry to single you out in this thread; I just noticed that your comment was both well written and recent)"
beer,3d2plm,Tssjr225,2,Tue Jul 14 02:10:30 2015 UTC,"College is awesome. And it sounds like yours involves powerdrinking partying like mine did. That's so much fun. And there's no reason to buy richer, heavier, pricier beers if you're just going to be guzzling 10 or 12 while you sweat out on the dance flo' and get wrecked and maybe become a vomit cannon later out in the yard. You're a broke ass student who wants to get down. So buy the drunk fuel and do your thing.   It's not that you can't also try and explore and enjoy good beers sometimes in other settings. But volume beers will still serve their same purpose for the rest of school and a bit beyond. And realistically after you've got a few in you, the taste doesn't register nearly as much anyway and isn't that important. And you want ones that are lighter and more refreshing so you can keep going. One thing you can do if you want is have a nice beer for your first one or two during warmup before your palate is shot and before you start paying attention to other things like the potential future bed partners starting to show up. Then switch over to economy mode and go turbo. WOOOOOOOOO COLLEGGGGE!   A good trick is to buy one pack of something like Mike's Hard or Smirnoff Ice or some other refreshing alcopop and slip one of those in your cooler with your beers each night to be your #7 or so. Your mouth gets all worn out on crap beer at some point in the night and it gets harder to keep drinking. But you've got work to do. So if you've got a refresher to break up the monotony and clear out the fuzzy sock feeling and wake up your palate, you can dive back in strong for the rest of your cooler for the home stretch. Remember, you are a better dancer with each beer, and you become more and more attractive. Those girls definitely want to have sex with you so keep going. Well, some of them anyway. You'll just have to pitch all of them. Don't go disqualifying any of them with your stupid standards. Just keep drinking until you and everybody else are good looking enough to wind up in sweaty, tangled, pass-out sex in somebody's toolshed.   Maybe also throw an emergency Red Bull in that cooler each night too in case you find yourself in a Last Man Standing standoff in the wee hours. She's the last girl at the party and there's four guys and she's definitely going home with the last one who doesn't pass out, and you need to make sure it's you. Feed your frenemies your remaining beers and fill one of your empties up with the Red Bull so it looks like you're still drinking when really you're cheating and fueling up while they're getting closer to passing out. Get your gum on at this point too so your mouth doesn't taste like a rented bowling shoe when you start sucking face. It's smart to save some gum for the lady too because you don't want her holding back just because she's afraid you're going to be put off by her cigabeer breff.   And remember it's OK to sneak out in the middle of the night and walk home because really that's what you both want unless you think you've got a shot at a sunrise special. She wants her whole bed and doesn't want to have to hold her farts in either, so just sneak on out of there. If you get caught, you forgot, you have that thing early tomorrow morning you have to be up for, so you can't stay, and you'll check her later for sure, thumbs up."

beer,3d3evg,CrimsonEngage,8,Mon Jul 13 05:14:27 2015 UTC,"There are a few very accessible wines made by meaderies. Although distribution isn't guaranteed, and many liquor stores may not know of mead, there are classic brands such as Bunratty, Chaucers, and Redstone. Some new brands who have found very good distribution include Moonlight, Nectar Creek, B. Nektar, and Schramm.  You can call around to find liquor stores that have it. I suggest finding liquor stores that specialize in wine instead of beer. Oddly, mead seems to have a following more closely related to beer drinkers, despite being by nearly all definitions a wine, up to and including how most meaderies are licensed by the government.  You can also try ordering online. Some meaderies even offer shipping from their location. I'm usually not one to single out a single suggestion, but Michael Fairbrother has done a tremendous job at Moonlight and is truly a leader in honey wine and I would absolutely without hesitation recommend ordering from their website a bottle or two to try as your first meads.  Also be wary of what kind of mead you want to seek. For example, Bunratty is a blend of mead and white wine, a tradition that some old world labels like. I do not find their mead to be stylistically a good first example, as that white wine does dilute the honey flavor.  Nectar Creek is accessible on the West Coast, but it's lightly carbonated and lower gravity, plus when I went through their lineup, had an off-flavor.  You should look for a mead that is of wine strength, that is categorically to a style of mead (BJCP Category 24 traditional, 25 fruit mead, or 26 other/historical mead), and of course, maybe has some good reviews. Again, hate to single one place out on this, but if you want to cut through any research and just want to try what will be a great mead and you can shop through some styles and you want to make getting it to your stoop easy so you can try it, I really recommend Moonlight. Fellow mazers can really attest to Fairbrothers' quality of honey wine.  Cheers!"

I don't like all BA beers, but the most recent I just loved was Cambridge Brewing Co's Ode to Olde, tasted like a manhattan in beer form.  not sure where the hints of cherry came from though, the server said they got the barrel from a local distillery and it was old so they didn't remember what was aged in it before, but was either bourbon or rye.  I don't think it was rye."

beer,3d4f04,maibd,2,Mon Jul 13 14:32:45 2015 UTC,Was it from the most recent release (2014)? BCBS has a pretty hefty ABV and is typically recommended for aging as this will mellow out the alcohol and bourbon notes over time. Also if you served it cold some of the more nuanced flavors may have been masked resulting in a booze bomb.
beer,3d4f04,Wblack2,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:46:06 2015 UTC,"Yes it was the 2014 release and my excitement got the best of me, couldn't help but open it asap. Next time I think I'll let it sit. Served it at 45, which I believe is a little colder than recommended (by about 10 degrees). You're definitely right about the aging though, I was wondering if that was behind it at all"
beer,3d4f04,Wblack2,2,Mon Jul 13 16:42:29 2015 UTC,"One of the keys of barrel-aged beers is the blending done when the beer is considered finished. The ratio of fresh to barrel-aged beer will impart different levels of spirit flavor and booziness. In addition, as others have mentioned the type of barrel and what other adjuncts are used also changes the flavor. Maybe your palate is just looking for a more blended or lighter variant than BCBS, or something that uses additional elements to offset the bourbon or hard/alcohol flavor.  Where are you located? I am sure that me or other members of beerit can recommend some beers that would be available for you to try. One series that I would recommend which is pretty available as a good intro to the different flavors achieved through aging is the Great Divide Yeti series. Standard Yeti is an imperial stout which they then take and age on oak chips with different components to really change the beer, It should have a wide distribution so you might be able to find it. Unfortunately the variants are seasonal (I think it is Oatmeal Oak Aged Yeti right now) but you might still be able to find some Chocolate or Espresso yeti which are my favorites. If you can find these you can do a side-by-side and see if you can pick up on the different flavors."

beer,3d2aep,cmrncstn,3,Tue Jul 14 21:24:00 2015 UTC,It's a take on Scottish style strong ale. So scotch ales and strong ales and for a higher abv try some barley wines. I won't recommend any specific brews or breweries due to the fact I don't live in a region where the beer you mentioned is available so it is highly unlikely anything in these styles I've tried is available in your area.

beer,3d4df0,CLEbeerguy,3,Mon Jul 13 12:43:53 2015 UTC,"In this entire ""battle"" that has spawned from ABI acquiring craft breweries and, specifically, since the throwdown Super Bowl ad, there have been a lot of misconceptions about how massive global brands operate when it comes to marketing.   Yes, the craft breweries that ABI owns put profits in the deep pockets of the people who are actively attempting to keep craft beer small and non-threatening to their bottom line. So, on the surface, it appears hypocritical of Budweiser to ""attack"" craft beer. They want their new assets to succeed, right?   Well, when it comes to marketing, things are heavily convoluted. Each unique ABI brand has it's own marketing team. The Craft Beer Division of ABI employs a marketing agency that has nothing to do with any of their other brands. The Bud Light team and the Budweiser team probably share some goals, but they probably ignore each other for the most part. In an ideal world, each division would know what the other is trying to accomplish and make sure not to stand in the way of any of those goals, but the marketing world is never ideal. At best, there's a 10-person meeting once a quarter where each team presents a conceptual plan for the others. No input, just a heads up. The Craft Beer division presents a grassroots concept where the brand is on the ground, making a big stir at local festivals, controlling distribution of the Bourbon County line to increase hype, etc. They specifically avoid TV commercials because that's not ""craft"" enough.   So you look at Budweiser and their marketing goals are to be the all-American good times beer. Grab some buds. Drink with friends. Drink all night. Party. Make today the ""good old days"". They'll help you have a better time surrounded by fun people. ""The beer guy"" is an American archetype built by classic college movies, phrases like ""who's bringing the beer?"", and decades upon decades of macro marketing. The Super Bowl commercial was a misstep in their own marketing, lying to themselves about what they are by trying to put down what they are not.   But when they say ""nobody cheers for a guy bringing watermelon wheat beer,"" they're right. That's their brand. They are the ""party has arrived"" beer. Even if you like watermelon wheat beer, you can't deny the image of 5-6 people sitting around a pool and a guy with a brick of Budweiser walking in and suddenly starting a party. If the guy had a sixer of Hell or High Watermelon, most of the people will tilt their head like a dog in confusion. They might love it after trying it, but it's not an instant good time like Budweiser (according to the messaging). It's not so much hurting their ""sister brands"" as much as it's solidifying and defining their current messaging which serves the goal of becoming the brand they need to keep/build their audience.   Nobody on the Budweiser marketing team is concerned with any of their craft brands. They look at market share reports and see that they need to combat the share they're losing to craft beer in general. The parent company, the man behind the curtain, the man nobody in marketing reports to is the owner of craft breweries, not Budweiser. Conversely, their craft brands will continue to be the anti-macro and ""fight"" the big bad macro beers in their own ""craft"" way."

Berkshire Brewing Lost Sailor IPA Pretty Things Lovely St. Winefride Pretty Things Meadowlark IPA Ballast Point Sea Monster Imperial Stout Samuel Smith Yorkshire Stingo Weihenstephaner Vitus Zoll Cellars Harvest Pumpkin Mead   I haven't tried any of these before, so this should be an interesting week. Had the Habanero Sculpin and Lost Sailor last night. Habanero was delightfully spicy and peppery, but it's not something I want to drink for an extended period of time. Lost Sailor is serviceable, but not as good as Steel Rail."

On Thursday I walked down to my local liquor store (don't go to chains guys, come on) and brought back a twelve of Sam Adams mixed (Boston, Summer, Downtime Pils, Rebel Rider IPA) and the Sextant Pack by Ballast Point (Wahoo, Pale Ale, Sculpin).    What are everyone's thoughts on twelve packs that only have three varieties?  I don't mind (especially if it's three killers) but my girlfriend really prefers variety."
beer,3cz6id,whtrbtobjct,3,Sun Jul 12 15:24:57 2015 UTC,"I would prefer more variety too. That's what's so appealing about pick-your-own six packs.  A new beer every time. With the twelve packs having three of each type, it's almost one too many. Personally, I'll have had my fill of a certain beer after two. Especially if it I didn't enjoy the beer that much. Having two bottles of six different beers would be great. If I like a beer enough to wish I had more than two bottles, then I'll definitely go buy a six pack of it."

Tahoe Mountain Brewing also has some great beers and Riip Brewing's Dan K IPA is probably the best new IPA I've had in a long while.

beer,3cy7dd,peemorebutts,2,Sun Jul 12 05:15:45 2015 UTC,Yeah this list is pointless. California has state fairs all across the state during the summer. For instance the San Diego county fair just ended and Orange County fair is on now both of which have beer competitions. Interesting enough the top beers at San Diego fair where all local breweries. These beer lists and competitions have gotten out of hand and I think most well established breweries just don't care about them any longer.

beer,3cy7dd,bchris24,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:43:13 2015 UTC,I work in the beer industry and very few breweries I know of even entered. The few that entered did so because it's generally a smaller pool of breweries.

The Strahov Monastic Brewery is close to the Prague Castle and definitely worth a visit, and there are great views of the city and river on your walk over. I heard great things about BeerGeek although I didn't have time to make it over there. I did the Bernard's Beer Spa with some friends and it was a blast, although you get 30 minutes in the spa with the beer on tap and that seemed to fly by quickly.   Finally if you want a good local dinner recommendation with craft beer, go to Kulovy Blesk. Great Czech food and a nice selection of craft beer, including a couple fridges with bottles for takeaway.

There are tons of tasty handles under $25 that'll get you where you're going. If you really want to get into good beer, stop considering where you can pinch pennies. Buy a good six pack over a garbage case and drink for the beer instead of the buzz. Sierra Nevada puts out great stuff that's entirely affordable on any budget that includes any beer at all."

And from what you mentioned regarding adding OJ to Blue Moon, it doesn't sound like you're really looking for something that tastes like beer.  My two cents? The Bud Light Lime-a-Ritas and Mixtails are something like 8% ABV, taste nothing like beer and come in enough flavors where you'll find one you can swallow. Same thing with Four Loko - nine flavors and 8% ABV. All come in 24oz cans and should run you $3 max per can. All also have a ton of sugar, so you'll wind up with a nasty hangover the next day."

For people just starting out, who like fruity things, they make some friendly intro fruity beers. I think they're cheaper than most craft beer (can't remember) but I imagine they're more expensive than your Buds and Millers and whatnot. I think otherwise you're not too likely to find a good tasting beer in the Bud Miller price range or less."

I just want something that's easy to get down. I had to mix some orange juice with the blue moon to get them down due to the taste being so awful
beer,3d2oxl,DeathtoPants,2,Mon Jul 13 05:47:40 2015 UTC,"Well in that case aim for Leinenkugel Shandy instead of one of their others. The others are subtle, but the shandy is really lemony. Sounds like beer-tasting beers just aren't going to do it for you yet. They may in time but in the meantime these fruit-boosted ones will go down easier.

Remember to look for the small 25cl bottles, as the 37,5 and 75cl bottles are quite different beers.  Have you tried any darker beers? Left Hand Milk Stout is sweet and very smooth.

It has been forever since I had Nugget Nectar, but it is an amber, as is Fat Tire. I seem to have lost my taste for Fat Tire, they changed it, or it is wildly different on tap.

beer,3cupdu,forestofcats,28,Sat Jul 11 05:23:07 2015 UTC,I've tried lots of beers that I hated. Buffalo Bayou did a Cucumber Melon beer for example. But I never regret trying a beer. Even the bad ones.

I can only really speak for North Carolina but Waynesville, Brevard, Blowing Rock, Lenoir, Hickory, and Granite Falls off the top of my head all have breweries of their own, some of them several. I get what you're saying but I think Appalachia in general gets a bad rap with this kind of stuff and it's kind of unwarranted. The history of moonshine in the area has, I think, directly lead to a pretty strong interest in brewing. Sure there are tiny towns where people stick to Miller/Bud/Coors but no more so than small towns in any other place in America, and I'd argue that Appalachia has a stronger craft culture than a lot of other regions."

beer,3cupdu,statix37,3,Sat Jul 11 04:17:13 2015 UTC,"I'm moving to Charlotte in a few weeks, I am excited to try some of the breweries there.  Any suggestions?"
beer,3cupdu,southsCLT,8,Sat Jul 11 03:16:22 2015 UTC,"OMB, Triple C, NoDa, Unknown, Birdsong, Sycamore, Heist, Sugar Creek...and others. More coming too."
beer,3cupdu,laundryplatinum,2,Sat Jul 11 03:48:57 2015 UTC,"Since the other guy just listed all the ones he could think of, I'll give you some starting points. You should go to OMB, NoDa, and Birdsong, and here's why.  The first place you should go is OMB. They're the biggest brewery in town by production, and their main flagship, Copper (an altbier), is my favorite beer from the city. All of their beers are traditional German styles and brewed according to the Reinheitsgebot. Their facility is gorgeous too, it feels like you've been transported to a real German beer hall.  My other recommendation - a more typical craft brewery, and my favorite in town overall - is NoDa Brewing. Located near the hip trendy neighborhood of NoDa, they make an award winning IPA (Hop Drop and Roll, Beer World Cup gold medal last year), one of my favorite porters, and a lovely refreshing blonde ale. They cover pretty much the whole spectrum that you'd expect a craft brewery to.  Just down the road from NoDa is Birdsong, the last I'll write about here. They just opened up a lovely new facility and make the best brown ale in the region. Make sure you try their Jalapeño Pale Ale; it's unique and delicious. I stop by just to get growlers of those two beers, since they don't can or bottle.   You should check out all the other little places too, but those are the highlights, imo."
beer,3cupdu,statix37,3,Sat Jul 11 14:48:02 2015 UTC,"Birdsong began canning Jalapeno Pale Ale about two months ago. You should be able to find it at any bottle shop, Whole Foods, or Total Wine."
beer,3cupdu,laundryplatinum,3,Sat Jul 11 15:32:59 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for the info.  I am moving from Seattle so I am excited to see the differences and similarities between how these two cities approach craft beer.
beer,3cupdu,08mms,2,Sat Jul 11 22:35:46 2015 UTC,"Man, I've heard so much good about the beer scene out in Seattle, I hope we can compare, lol. Craft brewing here in CLT is much younger and smaller, but we've really been booming (even compared to the country on average), and I think we're doing some really good things. I'm sure you'll enjoy what we have to offer!  Be sure to road trip to Asheville as well if you want to see more of NC beer - they're probably the real hotbed of the southeast."
beer,3cupdu,TubaMike,2,Sat Jul 11 23:45:35 2015 UTC,"The craft beer scene in Seattle is pretty phenomenal, there is an amazing brewery every time you turn around.  However, I like the idea of going to a city where craft beer is still a new idea (relatively speaking) and seeing what CLT can offer.  Don't worry, Asheville is already on my list of road trips after I try a couple different places in Charlotte."

Bud, bud light, miller light.  typically when they ran out of one of the beers they served what ever beer they had left.    For many weeks I remember they served bud light as bud, bud light and miller light and no one there could tell.  I thought it would NEVER have a micro brew on tap.  They  now have shock top lemon shandy."

beer,3cupdu,shickashaw,27,Sat Jul 11 01:02:52 2015 UTC,You can successfully market to your target audience without pissing off a bunch of other people in the process. I'd say it's pretty shitty marketing.  edit: Also I don't think Budweiser's target audience is the type to use twitter regularly.
beer,3cupdu,gumby_twain,20,Sat Jul 11 01:45:36 2015 UTC,"Them doubling down on the anti-craft beer message (i.e. craft beer sucks and is for hipster girly-men) means either the marketing is working or they're sticking with a marketing plan that was written a year ago and isn't able to be changed at this point.  I just can't figure out the logic of a company that is buying craft breweries on the one hand and then bashing them on the other. I guess they figure ""heads I win, tails you lose"" in the process."
beer,3cupdu,peteyboy100,29,Sat Jul 11 01:53:40 2015 UTC,"It's pretty simple really. Craft beer is a growing market they want a part of and they still need to maintain an existing brand. The parent company may be investing in the new market shifts, but they need to maintain their existing brand as well. They also won't lose any customers with their campaign. The only people upset with the ads swore off Budweiser (and all their major competitors) already.  The goal of the campaign is to endear themselves to ""average consumers who just want a regular beer"" AKA macro beer consumers. They're trying to get market share from Miller and Coors, not craft beer. To do that they first bring up negative stereotypes of someone they think the average macro brew consumer doesn't like, then they say why consuming their product makes you better. This way they get the idea in consumer's minds that their product is the better choice, without having to directly attack another macro brew.

You put 100 people in a room. all of them are your target demographic; people that drink beer.  lets say 20 of them are die hard craft beer fans, and 80 of them are die hard Budweiser fans. The craft beer geeks obviously know about Budweiser and won't drink it, but perhaps the bud crowd doesn't know much about craft beer. Some may be in the dark, but always open to new things.  So they are all in this room, and Bud goes, ""hey look at this twitter post!""   the 20 craft brew fans are gonna not care, , laugh at Budweiser, and stick to their craft beer.  of the 80 Bud drinkers, most of them will probably bee like ""Yeah, watermelons gross! we like piss water beer!"" but the chance that just one of them is curious is likely. One person might be like, ""I fucking love watermelon, and I fucking love beer, whats there to lose?""   so now theres (possibly) 21 craft drinkers, and bud just lost $20 from a case of beer.  So now in this situation we have here, multiply that by the general population (that follows twitter or reads this thread and any other beer related articles), and thats probably a bit of a hit to Bud. Not much a of a hit, but its not selling them any more beer either.  Bad publicity."

The issue isn't about Bud knocking watermellon  beer specifically, but rather the way they are shitting on craft beer culture as a whole.  It would be SO much better if they celebrated diversity of taste, diversity of beer, and craft brewing culture in America (much of which started with homebrewers!) And THEN follow that up with something to the effect of, ""But one thing we all agree on, there's nothing like a cold Budweiser.""  Or some other unifying thing.  Because honestly, before the company decided to shit on everyone's taste, I would absolutely not complain about a Budweiser on a hot day. Simple, cold, refreshing, I don't necessarily need complex craft beer all the time, I just want my macrobrewer to respect me when I do.     Edit: a typo"

They stock about 90 different Israeli brews and most are not yet exported, so it's rather unique.  http://www.beerbazaar.co.il"
beer,3cwuoy,solatic,6,Sun Jul 12 06:32:19 2015 UTC,"Not as easy, but not that rare as well. I don't like Goldstar and it really isn't different from the US macros. Same thing, just one brand that took over with rather bland beer. If you're in Tel Aviv go to Beer Bazaar, it's around center Tel Aviv, great people and atmosphere there and you can find all of those beers there. I listed their website and FB at the bottom, same goes for Dancing Camel."

beer,3cwuoy,CBFisaRapist,4,Sat Jul 11 18:05:32 2015 UTC,Hops need a cold climate to grow so they're not commercially viable in Israel - all the hops are imported.
beer,3cwuoy,BillyReuben,4,Sun Jul 12 06:24:16 2015 UTC,"Almost 100% certain that they do. I don't think those microbreweries import from over the seas. Also some of these use special hops so I am guessing they are grown here, but still mixed with other hops.   The Pressure Drop for instance if I remember correctly uses a combination of different hops that give it such a unique taste."

Their calculation is pretty easy to see: craft beer is the threat , not the other, traditional rivalry brands such as Coors Light. So, attack craft brewing.  The strategy is this: we're never going to get people who have an ideological connection to Craft Beer (ie, us), so we need to cut them out and target the section of the market that we can retain. One way we can do that is by ""othering"" Craft Beer, and reasserting ""mainstream"" values of simplicity, conformity, easily met expectations, comfort.   The goal is not to draw you and I to their corner. They know they can't do that. The goal is to make everybody else feel comfortable with their choice to drink big label beer."

Yeah... It's done."

Instead we're constantly talking about them and their company and their marketing and their strategy and their processes and other stuff. So maybe it's a ""there's no such thing as bad press"" maneuver? Just stir up shit to keep people talking about you? I wish it would go away. Their beer has not been about beer for a long time. It's just the arbitrary stuff that floats inside whatever identity du jour their ad agency du jour wants to sell you. It's literally only about the brand and about the advertising.

They're trying to strengthen their core customer base of loyal Bud drinkers to ensure they won't get curious and try something local.    As for them buying up craft breweries, I personally think they're just doing it so shareholders think they have a plan to deal with craft beer - when they really don't. So much of InBev's time and money is spent on growing other markets like Latin America and Asia, and the money they're spending on these small craft breweries is chump change to them. $30MM, $50MM, $100MM isn't a lot money to a company with $47 billion in revenue. If they really wanted to invest in craft beer they would look to one of the big players instead."

You can compare that to other calorie counts but for a lot of people it's easier to see ""burning 500 calories would require you to run stairs for 30 minutes"" and they'll think oh wow that's actually a lot of work (and a lot of calories).

beer,3ctmmb,Icapica,2,Fri Jul 10 22:49:25 2015 UTC,"Right, but that's just because you are looking at calorie counts.  For the majority of the population, they don't necessarily understand the relationship between calorie count and weight gain.  Would 150 calories take 10 minutes to walk off?  30 minutes? An hour?  Most people just don't know, so they'll assume that a coke is no big deal.    If the research has shown in a statistically significant manner that calorie count doesn't curb consumption as much as amount of exercise, that's something important to consider.  Just because you want to look at just calories and think ""alright, I get it"" doesn't mean it works with a randomly sampled population.  America (and, increasingly, the rest of the population) is going through an obesity epidemic.  Anything that has evidence behind it showing that it can cut food consumption appreciably in the population should be considered, even if for any individual redditor it doesn't seem necessary.    Also, ""fuck those researchers"" is really a silly thing to say...the researchers don't go into the study thinking ""Man, I can't wait to show that calorie counts don't work to cut food consumption and people have to see amount of exercise required to work that food off.  That'll show them!""  They tested the null hypothesis (probably that nothing will cut consumption) against calorie count and exercise required and exercise won out...it's not some conspiracy."

beer,3ctmmb,Icapica,2,Sat Jul 11 09:01:24 2015 UTC,"Converting to the wrong units is a terrible idea. If someone consumers 500 calories, they're looking at running (not walking) for about an hour. For an obese person, that is hard to do, and there is a good chance he/she doesn't know what that means either. Furthermore, an obese person burns calories at a different rate from a petite person, so this is meaningless. If calories were widely displayed, people would have a better sense of how energetic foods are compared to others, and hopefully be able to make better decisions. They could compare a burger to a piece of grilled chicken and see that the chicken has half the calories."
beer,3ctmmb,Muirbequ,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:18:33 2015 UTC,"As long as the units were the same (running/walking/whatever), they could still be more understandable for the general population.  Why not show both calories as units and exercise units for an average individual? You're saying that exercise will differ based on body type, sex, etc. and while this is true, it's still been shown that the exercise is a better unit if getting people to reconsider their consumption is the primary goal, which it obviously is.  Also, even if they're not capable of running due to obesity, it serves as a good reminder of just how much work is required to burn off those calories in a unit that's easier to comprehend.   You're speaking largely in hypotheticals about how people would view calories or exercise towards weight gain, but if the study was designed properly and tested properly, then it's already answered your hypothetical and shown that showing caloric intake isn't enough to affect behavior.   Even if exercise amount is off by 20-30% based on the individual, if it can ultimately get them to consume fewer calories, isn't the goal achieved?"
beer,3ctmmb,DoorMarkedPirate,2,Sat Jul 11 02:22:18 2015 UTC,"If people don't understand what a calorie is then the problem stems from a lack of education. You can apply this sort of system to anything which an individual has any non-neutral stance against. We could label the price of cigarettes and alcohol with units of food, housing, and the ability to provide for your children. We could label cake with units of diabetes or sunscreen with negative units of skin cancer. Perhaps we can measure clothes with units of cold resistance and style. But at the end of the day, those units mean less than many of the ones we already have, and the end-goal values are up to each individual to decide. That strategy is simply catering to the lowest common denominator of customers."
beer,3ctmmb,Muirbequ,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:51:45 2015 UTC,"In many countries (e.g., Canada, Australia), they do label cigarettes not with stats and figures about lung cancer rates and the proportion of smokers who get emphysema, but with pictures of cancerous lungs and tar-filled teeth. It's sad but well-known that people respond better to anecdotes and even inaccurate info that is easy to digest than to accurate facts and figures.  That's just the way it is if you want to affect behavior. Regardless of whether those numbers or images mean less, they have more of an effect.   If it serves its purpose, then it's a better option, regardless of whether you're looking at cakes, Big Macs, or beers. Price is a different factor for coats and such because we're talking about preventive medicine here, not spending, but sunscreen could be labeled in sun exposure vs. burn risk, especially because it's a logarithmic scale where the difference between SPF 30 and SPF 70 is much lower than most people think.  That's another good example of how getting the point across is more crucial than accurate values."
beer,3ctmmb,DoorMarkedPirate,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:12:43 2015 UTC,"Those are good points. But food is a set of choices. It's not about what you eat, it's about how many calories you eat total. So even if you eat only high calorie food, you can still lose weight with portion control.  My main concern is that this is less useful for people who actually care about their nutrition. It would be better if efforts were spent in education rather than using scare tactics. Taking it to an extreme, there could be a rise in anorexia as people start to associate food with work."
beer,3ctmmb,Muirbequ,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:56:39 2015 UTC,"Putting this as simply as possible: People are different and burn calories at different rates. Unless ""walk for 45 minutes to burn these calories"" was tailored to each specific individual, that system of measurement is utterly useless. Calories might not mean much to some, but one that is mildly educated in nutritional sciences (as little as visiting a dietician once in a blue moon) can take caloric intake and figure out roughly how much exercise is needed to burn off said intake.   Even more simply put: Listing food with amount of time to burn calories is absolutely, completely, and utterly useless."
beer,3ctmmb,SVTf,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:24:31 2015 UTC,"Again, this is all based on the assumption that people are well-versed in caloric intake and how much it takes for them to burn off those calories...that's just an assumption that doesn't hold much water. I'd like to find the study that this information is based on, but if they found that walking or running times served as a better method of cutting consumption (regardless of inaccuracy per individual) then it's better for this purpose. This isn't really about giving people exact numbers for caloric intake...this is about getting people to eat less food that they don't need. If calories don't serve that purpose for the sample population in a statistically significant manner but exercise required does, then that's a better measure for this purpose."

beer,3ctmmb,holemole,3,Sat Jul 11 15:29:17 2015 UTC,"...According to Draft, restaurants will be required to not only list the calorie counts, but also other nutritional information such as sodium and carbohydrates for their drink offerings.   Having a diabetic girlfriend who drinks a beer on occasion, I can see this being useful if even just as a point of reference / ballpark number.  Also, Yard House's menu is going to be a LOT more informative now, heh."
beer,3ctmmb,c00ller,4,Fri Jul 10 20:26:47 2015 UTC,"Speaker for a type 1 diabetic here and this is very good news to me. I can only inject insulin for some random number of carbs (usually 15 g for a 12 oz), and keep checking my BG more frequently to see if it's going up or down. It just gets more complicated when consuming food at the same time. I can understand (maybe) why nutritional labels are not necessary on bottling, but I hope that more breweries can post their nutritional info on their website.   edit: One time I was hypoglycemic while at a bar. I just quickly chose a beer and drank down half of it hoping it would have enough carbs in it to bring my blood sugar back up and luckily it did. Then drank the other half more enjoyably. That beer saved my life =D"

beer,3ctmmb,nightrain789,2,Sat Jul 11 03:08:17 2015 UTC,"No, it's not ""the government going overboard getting into regulating shit."" People oppose regulation because it ""hinders"" markets, but the same people often forget that there are two sides to the markets. More information like this leads to better decision-making on our part as consumers. Better decision making means more efficient markets, which in turn maximizes social utility. If I like the taste of two beers almost the same, but they have significantly different energy values, and I'm trying to manage my calorie intake tightly, then knowing which of the two has fewer calories will lead me to make choices that will effect the best overall return.  You may argue that some customers would rather not pay a premium (the cost of nutrition analysis, which could theoretically be ""passed on"" to us) to know what the caloric content in their beer is, even if they were fully aware of the significance of these calories, but I'm just trying to show you that the issue is far more involved and that not all regulation is the result of the government ""going overboard."""

Zywiec Porter is a close second for me, bu the price jumped to $4/pint near me, so I don't drink it as much.

So I wouldn't be surprised if it's similar or the same recipe.  I haven't compared though.   Vintage Ale definitely has my vote. You can age them for a long time. Last December we discovered one in our basement from 2005. After 9 years I was unsure what to expect, but it still tasted great!"

The better bottleshops across the country have so many bombers from all over--yes including from oregon. couldn't you have just suggested a few to the dude and let him see?  Sorry if I come off rude, hope you see where I'm coming from. It's like someone asking ""hey whats a great new album?"" and someone saying ""oh, my new favorite music is really obscure, you wouldn't have heard of it."" Why answer with a non-answer? It just comes off as pretentious."
beer,3csszj,hopstar,5,Fri Jul 10 18:33:21 2015 UTC,"I think you read more into my comment than I intended. The truth of the matter is that the vast majority of local breweries don't distribute outside of Oregon, or maybe to Seattle and the SF Bay at most. Breakside, Buoy, Hop Valley, Double Mountain, Silver Moon, Pelican, Ecliptic, Laurelwood, and many more of my favorites are pretty much only available around here, so suggesting them to someone who lives on the east coast is pointless.   It's not that I was trying to be a hipster or a dick, but I've been running a bottle shop in Portland for a decade, and I deal with tourists coming in on a daily basis and asking for stuff they can't get ""back home"", so I'm pretty familiar with what's available elsewhere."

He's asking for information--and what information does he get from that response? Nothing, it has literally zero value to him.

Most places in the country have a decent selection of reasonably priced bombers that are only available in that region. It sounds to me like your projecting your own hipsterism or recollections of your time in Portland onto the tone of my post, neither of which reflect what I said.  I'm probably the least hipster and/or snobby beer nerd you'll ever meet, and I'm happy to suggest beers to people, but like I said a couple posts up it's pointless to suggest beers that are only available 3,000 miles away.  I've wasted far too many words on this comment chain already, so I'll just wish you a nice weekend and be done with it.  Cheers, bro!"

If you are eating something ridiculously spicy so as to melt your face off you want to stick with something simple and drinkable like lagers and pilsners, and lots of them. If the beer is there more to compliment the spice I like strong beers like double or imperial IPAs or Tripels or Belgian Strong ales like a Duvel."

Anchor Steam is one of my favorite beers to have with spicier foods.  Be careful with very hoppy or high alcohol beers.  Both of those things can accentuate the spiciness of the food.  Take a look here for more food pairing info.  I've used it before for pairings and it's a pretty good resource.  Edit: a word"
beer,3cuwju,maszpiwo,4,Sat Jul 11 00:37:58 2015 UTC,"If you are looking to enhance the spiciness then ipas. The alpha acids from the hops will combine with and enhance the acids that cause the burn from spicy foods. If you want something to both soothe the tongue and ""reset"" your palate a light cream ale will do well since the element used in cream ales and milk stouts is the same as the compound in milk that neutralizes the burn from spicy foods. ( i don't suggest milk stouts simply because the capsaicin in spicy foods is an appetite suppressant that will make the stout too filling)"

I suppose it would accentuate the spice if for some reason a dish wasn't ""spicy enough"" but rather than making a pour beer pairing, I would think the food could just be prepared spicier?

beer,3ctns8,beeradvice,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:50:10 2015 UTC,I've done that before except I mixed it with Lindemans Framboise instead (which is quite good on its own by the way). I preferred 70:30 stout:framboise because then the raspberry flavor didn't overpower the chocolate.

beer,3ctns8,DeathtoPants,2,Fri Jul 10 19:01:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know. That could be the case. For me, Young's didn't have as much chocolate flavor as I expected/hoped. It was also thin."
beer,3ctns8,TheSaddestSadist,4,Fri Jul 10 19:14:00 2015 UTC,I agree with Samuel Smith's being like milk chocolate. Young's I've had multiple times and I actually struggle to detect any chocolate flavor at all. Young's does not live up to the name IMO.

While I was expecting more chocolate in the Young's and felt like it was missing a bit, I ultimately wound up liking it better just because it was stiffer in that regard and not so super sweet. I like chocolate beers but I want them to have some robust stoutness. When they're chocolate syrup, that's still nice but it just seems simple."

For my chocolate beer recommendation, you owe it to yourself to pick up a Sam Smith's Chocolate stout. Truly a delicious brew.  If dark chocolate is your game, lots of Imperial stouts like Sierra Nevada narwhal and Oskar Blues ten fidy have loads of chocolate flavor imo, as does the Brooklyn dark chocolate stout (shocker)."

I also appreciate what the colonists were trying to achieve for themselves: to live, right now, in a world of enterprising, fulfilling hedonism. Hopefully, Modern Times Beer will be one of those little pockets too.    How would you say the rubber of those those founding inspirations has met the road of the real world of business? This is probably just a roundabout entre into asking you how things have worked out differently in growing this business than you might/could have imagined up front. Biggest misconceptions? Biggest lessons? Biggest compromises or necessary sacrifices? Biggest bitter pills? Biggest reversals? Biggest areas of personal growth and change? Take your pick.   And speaking of that, if you're familiar with the Chaplin film by the same name, can you draw any parallels with that sense of trying feverishly to keep up with the machine of modern industry/business?  Also, is the ""are you 21?"" gate on alcohol websites a law or just something you have to do in order to not get criticized as socially irresponsible? Thanks for not making me waste time entering a specific made-up birthdate on your site."
beer,3cpe2u,phillip42069,14,Thu Jul 9 18:57:03 2015 UTC,"Wow, good questions. Where to begin...  I definitely think we've succeeded at creating ""weird little pockets of radness"" with our tasting rooms. Those spaces are the most personal things we've built and I'm extremely proud of them because I think they've brought something really, truly unique and wonderful into the world. So in that regard, yeah, it's been a smashing success in terms of the original mission.  I think the ""biggest areas of personal growth"" and the Chaplin question are tied together because yes, trying to keep up with the growth of a fast-moving industrial business has been tremendously challenging for me personally. The stress and anxiety has been enormous. I understand that from the outside looking in, Modern Times seems like a fairly slick operation. Don't believe that for a second. This place is held together with duct tape and dried blood. We started with one tenth the capital of other breweries that are growing at a similar rate, and we've managed to accomplish that with boat-loads of hustle. It's been amazing, but it's also taken a huge toll. I could use, like, a 2 year vacation at this point.   Before doing this, I had never run a business, never been a manager, never cut a five or six figure check, etc...So the personal and professional growth curve has been very, very steep. But in the moments when I'm not losing my mind, I'm very proud of what we've accomplished in such a short time.   The age-gate is 'mandated' by a voluntary agreement between alcohol producers and the FCC. Basically, at one point the federal government said, ""If you guys don't regulate yourselves, we're going to regulate for you."" And this self-policing agreement was the result. Like a lot of alcohol regulations, it's goofy as hell, but it's the lesser of two evils."

beer,3cpe2u,thelizahhhdking,11,Thu Jul 9 19:31:28 2015 UTC,Thanks dude! Really appreciate it!
beer,3cpe2u,phillip42069,2,Thu Jul 9 19:50:38 2015 UTC,You earned it man. Keep it up
beer,3cpe2u,phillip42069,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:55:51 2015 UTC,So what brewery is that? I'm originally from the Menifee area and would always head to Weins and Black Market in Temecula. Would be nice to hear of places to check out when I'm visiting home
beer,3cpe2u,gkunkle,5,Thu Jul 9 21:32:11 2015 UTC,"Also, Menifee got their first brewery called mason jar.  Mostly German style beer from what I understand. I need to make it in there and check it out."
beer,3cpe2u,cluster_1,3,Thu Jul 9 21:49:43 2015 UTC,I'm not going to say which one but it's one of those two!
beer,3cpe2u,dances_with-cougars,8,Thu Jul 9 21:46:53 2015 UTC,Hey! I visited San Diego from Portland this spring and loved your taproom in North Park. When will you expand distribution to Oregon?
beer,3cpe2u,fractalsoflife,3,Thu Jul 9 20:39:44 2015 UTC,Glad to hear it! Someday!
beer,3cpe2u,fractalsoflife,8,Thu Jul 9 20:59:23 2015 UTC,"Holy crap, you've replied to literally every comment here. Impressive.   Just have to say you guys are my current favorite new brewery. You've been knocking it out of the park this year.  I'm a home brewer up in Long Beach and dying to drive down and visit. Do you do tours of the operation or is it taproom only?"
beer,3cpe2u,mrpeterandthepuffers,7,Fri Jul 10 00:01:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's awesome! We do tours on Wednesday and Saturday, essentially by request. But you can see most of the brewery from the tasting room."
beer,3cpe2u,KFBass,8,Fri Jul 10 00:06:54 2015 UTC,"Which two San Diego breweries make you say ""Damn. They are on point with their beers!""? Aside from your own brewery of course."
beer,3cpe2u,tikiwargod,16,Fri Jul 10 00:25:20 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately answering this question is guaranteed to offend at least a few people I know and like, so I will have to remain silent."
beer,3cpe2u,KFBass,11,Fri Jul 10 01:28:21 2015 UTC,"Hi Jacob. Thanks for doing another AMA.   I am always interested in hearing about a brewer's lineage and legacy. I picture a brewery family tree, connecting breweries through marriages (mergers, e.g., CBA, NAB, or AB In-Bev), children (someone moving to another brewery or opening up their own shop, e.g., Kim Brisson-Lutz moving from Maui Brewing to Saint Archer, Jay Goodman moving from The Bruery to Rare Barrel, or Travis Smith moving from Russian River to the Bruery before starting Societe with Doug Constantiner from the Bruery), or godparents (someone influenced and informed by another brewery without actually working there, e.g., Anchor influencing Ken Grossman in starting Sierra Nevada or Pro-Am competitions). I hold firm to the belief that no one is an island.  As I understand it, you worked at Stone and homebrewed before starting Modern Times, correct? And already, you have a ""protégé"" in Alex Tweet opening up Fieldwork Brewing. Have you maintained a relationship with folks at Stone or Alex? Have you tried Alex's beers? In a recent interview, he shared how his work with you was influenced by Michael Tonsmeire, the mad fermentationist. Are you still working with Michael? Finally, in your previous AMA, you said ""Unfortunately, collaborations are a luxury that can only be afforded by breweries with time and capacity, neither of which we have at the moment."" Any plans for future collaborations? Maybe something for the Festival of Dankness?  Thanks again for the AMA, the great beers, and for distributing to South SF Bay area!"
beer,3cpe2u,LudwigWittJr,20,Thu Jul 9 19:02:19 2015 UTC,"Correct. Yes, I'm definitely still in touch with Stone (they're our distributor, so I literally talk to them every day), and Alex (Fieldwork sent beer for our Hella Tight Bay Area Extravaganza and he's sending beer to the Festival of Dankness, too). Mike is definitely still in the loop, although there's less for him to do now, so he's more like our spirit animal. I think I'll have a project for him soon, though.  Yes, it seems like we finally have the time and space to do some collabs. We're starting off with a couple at other peoples' breweries though, both because it's fun to travel and it's easier for us. Stay tuned for details."
beer,3cpe2u,lostinasuprmrkt,2,Thu Jul 9 19:47:06 2015 UTC,Thanks for the responses! I look forward to all your beer.
beer,3cpe2u,MrDonamus,2,Thu Jul 9 20:17:19 2015 UTC,Follow up if it's not too late - How do collabs work from your side of things? Who calls whom? How do you decide on a recipe? And how do you decide where to brew/distribute and who gets the money?
beer,3cpe2u,MrDonamus,5,Fri Jul 10 12:19:00 2015 UTC,"From another professional Brewer, that would be a mighty incestuous family tree and a huge undertaking. I don't even work in the states and I can count several guys who have moved around from breweries you mentioned, to come work here."
beer,3cpe2u,UnaPierna,2,Fri Jul 10 01:07:34 2015 UTC,It gets even wilder inside the province. Everyone knows everyone it seems.
beer,3cpe2u,StPaddy81,2,Fri Jul 10 19:57:57 2015 UTC,"Our province? Your in ON right?  Yeah it's crazy incestuous up in Ontario. For OCB week I brewed with a guy I trained at magnotta, at the granite, days before he moved to mill st, to work under a girl I know from beer for boobs. That brewday I met a guy who went to work at block threw shortly thereafter, block three which was started by a Brewer from Welly, where I now work, who helped me move into my house.   Crazy incest up in here, and that's just one example of us younger guys. I once heard a crazy story from Jamie mistry about how George from f and m almost killed him with a forklift when they both worked at upper Canada."
beer,3cpe2u,fogindex,4,Fri Jul 10 20:21:28 2015 UTC,Just got Mega Black House yesterday. Excited to try my first MT beer.
beer,3cpe2u,fogindex,5,Thu Jul 9 18:43:13 2015 UTC,Cheers! Hope you dig it. I've been really stoked on all the positive feedback we've been hearing on Mega Black House.
beer,3cpe2u,snuffy_707,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:06:26 2015 UTC,I think you should throw that sucker in some barrels. But I'm sure I'm not the fIrst person to have suggested that.
beer,3cpe2u,ComradePalmer,6,Thu Jul 9 21:37:13 2015 UTC,Do you have any plans for further distribution in the near future?
beer,3cpe2u,DJPho3nix,17,Thu Jul 9 19:20:25 2015 UTC,"We're rolling out in the Bakersfield area this summer, but aside from that, no. We're going to need to bring some new tank online before we can talk about expanding our footprint at all."
beer,3cpe2u,iLorax,3,Thu Jul 9 19:48:46 2015 UTC,Understandable.  I didn't realize y'all were only two years old.  I've only had one beer from Modern Times and it was pretty good.  Hopefully I'll see it in AL one day.
beer,3cpe2u,iLorax,2,Thu Jul 9 20:23:16 2015 UTC,Yes Bakersfield! Can't wait!
beer,3cpe2u,SanDiego_BeerDude,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:28:53 2015 UTC,I can't wait!
beer,3cpe2u,marmitza,5,Thu Jul 9 23:44:11 2015 UTC,TRUE/FALSE: I read somewhere that Blazing World was an attempt at blending Surly Furious & Alpine Nelson...
beer,3cpe2u,timmay106,9,Thu Jul 9 19:52:00 2015 UTC,"Close, but I wouldn't describe it as an ""attempt at blending""; more like general inspiration. What happened was this: Mike and I were talking about what to do with the hoppy beer slot in the year round line-up, and we're both big fans of Nugget Nectar. We felt like there was a lot more room for growth in the imperial/hoppy amber style, but not many breweries were doing anything with it. And of course, other beers on the ""inspiration board"" were Nelson and Furious, along with several others. I had also homebrewed several batches of a beer I called ""Pacific Nectar"", which was the jumping off point for Blazing World. So yes, it was inspired by several beers, including the ones you mentioned."
beer,3cpe2u,FartSkin,2,Thu Jul 9 19:57:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply!  Will Northern California receive distribution of your wild ales like Palace Of Cracked Heads, Rampart Junction, etc?"
beer,3cpe2u,fermenter85,8,Thu Jul 9 20:27:52 2015 UTC,"They actually were, very briefly, available during our launch week in SF. But in general, our barrel-aged beers are sold online and then picked-up in our tasting rooms, and that's how it will have to continue for now. We're working hard on producing more barrel-aged beer though."
beer,3cpe2u,fermenter85,2,Thu Jul 9 20:30:07 2015 UTC,Asking the most pertinent questions I see.
beer,3cpe2u,aonbe,4,Thu Jul 9 23:08:42 2015 UTC,"How has the brewery adapted to the current drought situation California, and most of the other western states really, is going through?"
beer,3cpe2u,HUH_YIS,7,Thu Jul 9 20:15:55 2015 UTC,"Thus far, the drought has not had any impact on us. We'll see if the local water district issues any restrictions, but I would guess industrial users are last in line for cuts."
beer,3cpe2u,DEEJANGO,5,Thu Jul 9 20:17:50 2015 UTC,"Being from Chicago, I haven't had the chance to try much of your stuff. The few things I have tried have been top notch. The first that I tried from you guys was a Blazing World that I got in a trade as an extra and I really enjoyed it.  Do you have any plans to expand distribution out to Chicago in the (hopefully not-too-distant) future?  Also, will you send me some Monster's Park with Coconut? :)"
beer,3cpe2u,sdclark5,8,Thu Jul 9 20:31:35 2015 UTC,"I would love to send beer to Chicago. I actually fell in love with craft beer at The Hopleaf, so Chicago holds a very special place in my heart. I wouldn't own a brewery if it weren't for Chicago! That said, we are maxed out right now, so I can't make any commitments to new territories. Someday!"
beer,3cpe2u,theriibirdun,6,Thu Jul 9 20:36:12 2015 UTC,"Pleas make more monsters park, haven't been able to get it anywhere yet and I'm in LA. Also what the heck is up with the super limited version of the MP BBA? Obviously people are gonna jump on it, 1 bottle per person is brutal.. Any thoughts on a society ala bruery for some of your more sought after beers? Could get the upfront capital to make more interesting stuff.. Not that your stuff isn't already great but I'm a touch bitter.   Cheers and keep it up, love your stuff"
beer,3cpe2u,Badwolf2013,8,Thu Jul 9 21:11:44 2015 UTC,"We just don't have the space to make any more. BUT, we have a plan to make more. Stay tuned.  We did create a society--The League of Partygoers and Elegant People--for our Kickstarter campaign, but we haven't expanded it because...see above. We may consider taking another crack at it if we're able to grow the volume and variety of our barrel-aged offerings. But no promises."
beer,3cpe2u,steezburgers,2,Thu Jul 9 21:47:02 2015 UTC,"Oh nice, I was late to the party on that one. I think the society's are an interesting way for breweries to reach out to customers who maybe would like to get more interesting products then they have locally available, and would be willing to $$ for it. Plus it locks in some additional capital for the brewery to do fun stuff with. For people like me who don't live reasonably close to good breweries (I live near Ventura so everything is a drive) it presents an attractive option. Glad to hear more fun things are coming down the pipeline, don't neglect that Instagram account ! I know lots of us follow the breweries because it keeps everything in one spot instead email newsletters Etc. what are your pros and cons on the whole society model for breweries?"
beer,3cpe2u,Aethien,8,Thu Jul 9 21:57:32 2015 UTC,"I really don't have a question, more of a comment. I want to say that for the last year and a half that I have been visiting Modern Times, I have enjoyed all the beers you have produced (some more so than others but never disappointed). Also you have a really great staff  AND BRING BACK THE CASK OF LOMALAND WITH TOASTED COCONUT!!! or was it fortunate islands and toasted coconut??? Either way BRING IT BACK lol Keep up the great work and congrats on year number 2 and hope for many more to come"
beer,3cpe2u,steezburgers,6,Thu Jul 9 19:10:43 2015 UTC,"Haha, thanks, glad to hear! Thanks so much for your support, and I'm really happy to hear our staff is treating you well. I feel very fortunate to have attracted such great people."
beer,3cpe2u,cregbeary,4,Thu Jul 9 19:48:02 2015 UTC,"Afternoon!   I really wanted to comment on... well a lot... but Monster's Park, Blazing World and Blackhouse are just my favorite beers by Modern Times. The first Modern Times beer I tasted was Blazing World and at the time I worked at a beer bar. It felt like the bar was losing out on an opportunity there. Soon after suggesting this to upper mgmt, I was so happy to see it on tap. Now Blackhouse has replaced other handles there too. Seeing your company grow makes me legitimately happy.   Now, to lead into a question... I really appreciate your branding as well as package design of your brand and product. When at uni, I struggled because I loved the clean white simple look and at the time it wasn't popular. When I found your cans in retail settings, it felt kind of like a small victory because of the design on your packaging. The question, if you did (which I'm assuming you did) participate in the branding of your company, what other possibilities were you thinking as far as an aesthetic look for Modern Times? It would be interesting to visualize the different directions your brand could have gone.   Thank you so much for doing this AMA. I am so sad to not be able to attend the Festival of Dankness. I really enjoy the events though, Black Friday last year was tons of fun! Bought a few Limited Edition Monsters Park to enjoy at home.   Cheers!  Edit: I heard you've been thinking of brewing a Barley Wine... any chances we'll see some CharlieWine in the near future?"
beer,3cpe2u,highpowered,5,Thu Jul 9 20:35:34 2015 UTC,"Awesome, really appreciate the support! That means a lot.  Yes, I worked very closely with amazing designers on the aesthetics of Modern Times. All of the directions we explored were in the ""clean, vintage, gender-neutral"" direction. There were a lot of fun can mock-ups in there, but unfortunately I can't share them. In general, I just wanted Modern Times to reflect my personal taste and the grown-up approach I'd like to see craft take. We were never going to be the brewery with cans showing an alligator wearing wrap around shades leaning on barrel with a frothy pint of suds in his hand while he chips in a birdie. There's already more than enough of that kind of thing. I wanted our design to look good next to Fiestaware or an Eames chair, and I think we succeeded at that."
beer,3cpe2u,workthrowawayyyyyyyb,3,Thu Jul 9 20:57:47 2015 UTC,"Hope I'm not too late....  I was stoked I got a chance to visit your Point Loma tasting room while in SD on vacation last month. Loved the space, loved the beer, wish I could have tasted the whole board.  My question is related to my second-favorite beverage: coffee. I have yet to see another brewery really embrace coffee the way you guys have. Are you really just a barista wearing rubber boots? Love to see where you go next with it and I'll be begging the NW Coffee Beer invitational people here in Portland to send you a damn invite. Mega Black House would have killed at that fest."
beer,3cpe2u,misterid,8,Thu Jul 9 21:24:17 2015 UTC,"Awesome, glad you had a great visit!  I'm really passionate about coffee, and I think there's a ton of overlap between beer appreciation and coffee appreciation. So I'm really passionate about introducing beer geeks to specialty coffee. I think we have a really unique opportunity to spread knowledge of world class coffee among a group of folks who have very adventurous palates. We've already seen great responses from folks who came to us for the beer, and ended up leaving with a newfound appreciation for coffee. And I want to keep pushing that. Our barrel-aged beans have been a great entry-point for beer geeks. Now I want to get them on-board with single origins, two of which we have coming available soon that I think are absolutely phenomenal.   I would love to go to the NW Coffee Beer Invitational! I think I already talked to Brian Yaeger about it, but I'll double check."
beer,3cpe2u,exoxe,4,Thu Jul 9 22:02:06 2015 UTC,Whats it like working with a famous punkboarder?  Is he unruly and does he roundhouse kick every fermentor to kickstart the batch?
beer,3cpe2u,manachar,3,Thu Jul 9 22:12:26 2015 UTC,Yes.
beer,3cpe2u,manachar,5,Thu Jul 9 22:21:26 2015 UTC,"Hey Jacob, love your beers. Going to be traveling down to SD in two weeks and can't wait to visit the taproom again.   I fucking love Fortunate Islands. My coworker and I brought back 5 cases to northern California well before anybody up here had it, and other than the fact that it got cooked by BevMo (we had asked for it ahead of time and I think they stored it outside on Ventura Blvd in July for a week before we picked it up, their issue, not yours), every other beer experience I've had with your product throughout California has been incredibly positive. Especially City of the Dead and Fortunate Islands. If FI wasn't so expensive at the only outlet I can find it in Sonoma County it would be a go to.   I'm a winemaker full time and love experimenting with new technique and interesting packaging. I have really appreciated the experimentation with coffee aging you did and the mildly subversive way you handle product advertising and just how the beers fit into their categories to begin with. I'm jaded with the craft/luxury wine and beer world in general and your approach has been totally refreshing. So, cheers from up north. /fanboy  My question is: Any plans for more sours and or fruit beer experimentation (or maybe just getting some more further north)? I remember hearing about rumors of more and getting amped about it. I think I saw a fruit beer at Beercraft at one point but only on tap. Any other interesting stuff in the pipeline?  Also, how often do you get visitors immediately after their trip to the Body Shop? Is there glitter everywhere?"
beer,3cpe2u,BigBassBone,6,Thu Jul 9 22:34:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Really appreciate all the kind words.   Our sour program was always designed to start up in two installments: 'dark' and 'light'. We brewed and released the 'dark' sours first, and we're now on the second go around with those. The 'light' sours have 3-5 more months to go, and yes, there will be plenty of fruited versions.   Other than that, we have Fruitlands, a sour cherry gose, in the pipeline for our 22oz program, which should be fun.   We get very few people coming over from the strip clubs. They're, uh, budget-minded establishments, and their audience generally is not interested in $5 pints of craft beer."
beer,3cpe2u,BigBassBone,2,Thu Jul 9 22:43:50 2015 UTC,"Surely you must be joking, Pacers is the classiest of establishments.  But really though, I will drink all the gose. Put some on tap on the 22nd!  Thanks for the response."
beer,3cpe2u,phoenix3e3,4,Fri Jul 10 01:53:28 2015 UTC,What was the inspiration for the Michael Jackson and Bubbles post-it mosaic?
beer,3cpe2u,kylesplash,3,Thu Jul 9 22:41:17 2015 UTC,"The mosaic is a satire of a sculpture by Jeff Koons. The idea of doing a massive Post-It mosaic was just the product of my personal weirdness. We had that giant wall towering over what would become the tasting room, so I wanted to do something dramatic with it."
beer,3cpe2u,broncobluster,8,Thu Jul 9 22:48:22 2015 UTC,Can you please make Booming Rollers a year round release!
beer,3cpe2u,dancetar,38,Thu Jul 9 19:26:55 2015 UTC,"Haha, I'm happy with it as a seasonal. The seasonals are intentionally all hoppy/IPAs for the sake of freshness; this way you know if you see it outside of the seasonal window, it's not that fresh."
beer,3cpe2u,dancetar,2,Thu Jul 9 19:50:19 2015 UTC,Such a simple idea but it makes so much sense!!
beer,3cpe2u,dancetar,9,Fri Jul 10 06:00:07 2015 UTC,What do you think about the mega breweries buying small craft breweries?  Specifically Goose Island.
beer,3cpe2u,dancetar,27,Thu Jul 9 18:59:32 2015 UTC,"Well, on my most stressful days, I'm very sympathetic to the owners who chose to sell. On better days, I really, really wish it weren't happening. It screws craft breweries in a huge way. The biggest issue is that ABI immediately slashes the prices of the acquired brewery's beers. That may sound like a good thing for consumers, but it's actually an anti-competitive strategy that depends a multinational corporation's willingness to lose money or break even just to force out the competition. So if it continues and the strategy is successful (and it certainly has been in other industries), craft beer drinkers can expect a lot less choice in the beer world and much less friendly environment among brewers. Small, independent breweries can't afford to not make money just to maintain tap/shelf space; ABI can. So the end game of this process is very bad for craft brewers and drinkers."
beer,3cpe2u,Pablopubes,7,Thu Jul 9 19:32:36 2015 UTC,You should inform ABI of that. BCBS has not got any cheaper. Only more expensive.  Also love your beer! Hopefully we see it in Chicago one day!
beer,3cpe2u,worstbeerblog,9,Thu Jul 9 21:12:28 2015 UTC,"That's called ""prestige pricing"" and it's designed to make you feel like their still the kind of company that makes something worth buying.   We definitely hope to be in Chicago someday!"
beer,3cpe2u,worstbeerblog,2,Fri Jul 10 02:15:26 2015 UTC,"For someone who says they have no ""business"" experience, it sounds like you really grasps the big picture of the market strategies in play. If it makes you feel any better I put goose IPA in my macro door next to the bud light instead of in the beer cave."
beer,3cpe2u,brianskuhar,2,Fri Jul 10 06:27:12 2015 UTC,I don't! But you can learn anything if you're determined enough and willing to google a lot.
beer,3cpe2u,brianskuhar,4,Fri Jul 10 19:56:30 2015 UTC,But the price of all the year round Goose Islands has dropped off significantly.  As much as $1.50-2 a six pack in the last two years
beer,3cpe2u,plutoisplanet9,2,Fri Jul 10 02:23:51 2015 UTC,"It's also available in Europe now for roughly similar prices to the Anchor, Flying Dog and Brooklyn's that have started appearing in supermarkets around me. I was pretty disappointed in the 312 and the IPA though, very middle of the road and uninteresting."
beer,3cpe2u,plutoisplanet9,2,Fri Jul 10 08:49:05 2015 UTC,"Besides BCBS and some other randoms (really enjoyed The Muddy), Goose Island has always been very meh IMHO."
beer,3cpe2u,franch,9,Fri Jul 10 12:44:49 2015 UTC,"Hey Jacob.  Were you a big fan of ""Simpler Times""?  The names always confuse me.  Obviously not the beer."
beer,3cpe2u,phacebook,12,Thu Jul 9 19:00:07 2015 UTC,"No. They're not at all related, and I think that's pretty clear from the labels, beers, branding, context, etc...There's also ""Early Times"", which is a brand of whiskey. Also not related."
beer,3cpe2u,greeed,3,Thu Jul 9 19:37:53 2015 UTC,"Any idea when you will get distribution in Portland? I had some Black House shipped here, and it didn't seem like the primo edition I picked up in SD. Still one of my favorite all-time brews. Thanks!"
beer,3cpe2u,Thatguyaric,11,Thu Jul 9 20:20:21 2015 UTC,"I do not know when, just that I absolutely want to. Because we're brewing at max capacity, I can't make any commitments to new territories. But I really love Portland, so much so that I would probably have ended up living there if it had better weather. So business trips to Powell's/Portland are definitely a priority."
beer,3cpe2u,Thatguyaric,3,Thu Jul 9 20:25:25 2015 UTC,I think you have the loveliest looking cans around.  Pity we don't see them very much in the UK.  Do you distribute to Europe and if so where can I find your beer?!
beer,3cpe2u,snuffy_707,4,Thu Jul 9 21:09:02 2015 UTC,"We've sent one small shipment to Sweden, our only European market. Hopefully we can add more!"
beer,3cpe2u,snuffy_707,2,Thu Jul 9 21:14:05 2015 UTC,what is the connection to Sweden?
beer,3cpe2u,Madomb01,5,Fri Jul 10 01:58:25 2015 UTC,"None really, but it's the best overseas market for American craft beer by volume. So it has a very well-developed infrastructure for import/export."
beer,3cpe2u,Madomb01,3,Fri Jul 10 02:36:47 2015 UTC,Do you like to drink beer?
beer,3cpe2u,mrpeterandthepuffers,8,Thu Jul 9 21:12:49 2015 UTC,"Sometimes. Sometimes drinking beer puts me back into ""work mode"" when I'm just trying to chill the fuck out; it's hard not to analyze something you spend all day analyzing. So sometimes I enjoy drinking cocktails or wine."
beer,3cpe2u,cyecats,3,Thu Jul 9 21:48:51 2015 UTC,Hope I'm not too late. You did a great Tap Takeover here on Maui at Maui Brewing Company. It introduced me to your great beers.  When will see you back doing a Tap Takeover with some of your great new stuff that doesn't make it into cans?
beer,3cpe2u,Lecturepioneer,5,Thu Jul 9 21:21:34 2015 UTC,"That series of events we did in Maui was seriously one of the highlights of the last two years for me. It's not everyday you get to see a frickin' whale breach while introducing a crowd of enthusiastic people to your beer. So cool.   Anyway, I'm eager to head back to Maui, for obvious reasons. There's a killer new beer bar coming to Lahaina, so maybe I'll time a trip with that opening. We're totally committed to Maui, so I'm eager to keep building relationships there."
beer,3cpe2u,guacamole23,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:53:55 2015 UTC,"Wonderful news on both fronts. The beer scene here has vastly improved in the last two years, in no small part to you and other craft brewers distributing through Maui Stone."
beer,3cpe2u,guacamole23,3,Thu Jul 9 21:59:04 2015 UTC,"I love your beers! I know you have a sour program, and I'm wondering if you'll be canning those or only doing them in large format bottles. Thanks. :)"
beer,3cpe2u,bucky505,4,Thu Jul 9 21:24:54 2015 UTC,"We're sticking with 750s for now. I would be worried about the possibility of infection with running sour beers through our regular canning line, and our line also only accepts 16oz cans. But I agree that sours in cans would be rad. We could potentially do something like The Dancing Plague in cans, since it doesn't have any live cultures in."

beer,3cpe2u,mikeyleebs,3,Thu Jul 9 22:07:27 2015 UTC,"I know you guys publish all of your recipes on your website and I was wondering how that has been working out for you so far? I know in a blog post your goal was to get feedback from the community on how to improve the beers you make. Have you gotten and good feedback or collaborated with anyone yet?  I personally have not tried making any of your recipes (I would just buy your beer but I live in Chicago haha) but I am very interested in making one soon, especially the sour or Brett recipes. I was wondering how long these typically ferment for. Do you have to age the beer for months to let the brett finish eating all the sugars and then dry hop at the end?"
beer,3cpe2u,a_ill_literate,2,Thu Jul 9 21:51:36 2015 UTC,"It's certainly been cool to see homebrewers tinkering with our beers, but it hasn't really led to any changes here. I'm happy to keep doing it for the sake of transparency, but frankly, the people who have probably gotten the most use out of them are a few breweries who have suddenly started making very similar beers.  Our barrel-aged sour beers go for around 18 months. Our 100% Brett beers take 30-40 days, at least, and yes, we dry-hop at the end (Brett flocs very poorly, so we end up waiting a long time before dry-hopping.)"

I would love to distro beer in Florida, but Southern California, Maui, the Central Coast, & SF (our current distro footprint) more than soaks up every drop of beer we make.

beer,3cpe2u,jaso4657,5,Thu Jul 9 19:05:54 2015 UTC,"Hello, I recently bought (and thoroughly enjoyed) your Mega Black House. I was wondering if you guys were planning on doing anything else special with it (bourbon barrel aging, etc.). Also, everything seemed to be on point with the beer except the mouth feel which was rather thin. What was the reasoning behind not making a thicker (motor oil-esque) mouth feel?"
beer,3cpe2u,nollaigjohn,11,Thu Jul 9 18:55:43 2015 UTC,"No current plans for any other versions of Mega Black House. I think a barrel-aged version might be too similar to Barrel-Aged Monsters' Park with Coffee.   As for the mouthfeel, we generally are not trying to make thick, sweet beers; we like beers on the drier end of the spectrum across the board. One of the ways you make beer thick as hell is to make it sweet, and that's just not our bag."

beer,3cpe2u,ThePraetorian,18,Thu Jul 9 18:39:16 2015 UTC,"That's news to me. We've literally never received any reports of infected beer, and accounts (and fans and distributors) certainly aren't shy about letting us know when something is wrong. If we had an entire batch that was infected, it would a 5-alarm fire around here, and that definitely has never happened.

I don't know of any other brewery that has a commonly used pet name, so I wear it as a badge of honor.  Sometimes dontdrinkbeer is hilarious, sometimes not, but that could describe just about anyone trying to do satire/humor. Personally, I'll take old school BA reviews from Overlord and the sadly departed Angry Beer Rep Twitter handle over dontdrinkbeer.

The biggest threat I face is burn-out, and I just never dreamed that would be the case. Fortunately, we're growing in a way that's making my job less stressful all the time.

beer,3ctkgo,LongBook,7,Fri Jul 10 17:42:30 2015 UTC,"Glad to help. Cool that you're trying to broaden your beer horizons. I doubt you'll regret it. There will be some palette evolution for a bit, but I'll try to recommend some beers I'm pretty sure you can get your hands on that won't be too big a leap for you to begin with ...   Victory Prima Pils: One of the best pilsners in the U.S. market. Because pilsners are in the same style class as Bud Light, this shouldn't be too different from what you're used to, except brewed expertly with the right ingredients, to taste good, not just make insane profits. Anchor Steam Beer: A classic, and one of the oldest, if not the oldest, craft beers. Once again, a lager style that should be easy on your palette, and it should be fairly easy for you to find. Ballast Point Longfin Lager: A German-style lager that's easy to drink, low ABV. Brooklyn Lager: Another solid lager, this time from your neck o' the woods. Ballast Point Grunion: Stretching you out a bit here. If you're OK with the lagers, try easing your way along with this 5.5% ABV pale. Just enough hops to taste it, and to separate it from the white ale you didn't like. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale: Another craft beer classic. I suspect the hops may be a bit much for you, but it's definitely one you should give a try if you're testing this style. Victory Summer Love: If the pales are too hoppy for you, you can always fall back on some simple blonde ales like this one. Very solid beer that you'll probably like. Not a big stretch from where you are.   There are plenty more options, but those can hopefully work to get you started: fairly easy to find, a small walk from where you are, and good craft beers. Once you try some of those, as you enjoy them more, don't be afraid to push into brown ales and IPAs, then maybe stouts and barleywines, though that's probably going to be a long journey before your palette's ready.   Good luck, man. Cheers."

If you have a bottle shop/liquor store that sells make your own 6 packs, go there and get 6 random different types of beers. That's the best way to figure out what you like"
beer,3ctkgo,melcher70,2,Fri Jul 10 18:27:37 2015 UTC,I have heard allot of good things about Yuengling. Will have to give it a try!
beer,3ctkgo,melcher70,3,Fri Jul 10 19:20:33 2015 UTC,"So far, you like Lagers/Pilsners. That's a good place to start. Try to find a Pilsner Urquell. It's a very old, classic Czech Pilsner, a lot of American ""factory lagers"" are based on that recipe. It's kind of like drinking a much better tasting Budweiser. Another option (if you're in MA or close you should be able to get it) is Jack's Abby Framingham lager. It's the same style.  My first foray into ""good"" beer started as a 21 yo drinking Sam Adams. The lager is a good place to start. It's darker than what you're used to, but a pretty classic taste. And then branch out from there! Also, talk to people. Try to find a pub that specializes in craft beer, ask the bartender to suggest something. Maybe a place that has a ""flight"", a group of small tasting glasses if different styles.. Or a store that offers tastings. Enjoy it!"

beer,3ctkgo,ak_doug,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:23:58 2015 UTC,"Start with Sam Adams Lager. The blue bottle. Sam Adams Boston Ale might be a good next choice.

beer,3ctkgo,huntimir151,3,Fri Jul 10 19:32:15 2015 UTC,"IMO the best and easiest way to get into the craft scene is to start with standard pale ales. They are generally really drinkable and many have great hop character that can launch your interest towards something more robust. As for a specific beer recommendation, Lagunitas IPA is easy drinking and great for new beer drinkers. Similarly, Founders All Day IPA is designed to be easy to drink and refreshing. All of my non-beer drinking friends love these two beers, and they're a great introduction to the scene.  Very wordy, but I hope this helps a little!   Cheers"

beer,3ctkgo,Hurdy11,2,Fri Jul 10 19:28:02 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna go against the grain here and suggest a bold move. Don't pussyfoot around with easing your palate into beer, just shove it right into the vortex and buy a bomber of oak aged yeti. Again, risky strategy, but I have faith.  However,  if that somehow doesn't work, check out Sam Adams Boston lager, and Samuel smiths oatmeal or chocolate stouts. The former was my first good beer, and I loved it off the bat. The latter ones are super drinkable and offer a taste of classic British beer. From personal experience,  I would also recommend something many would not for a beginner: Chimay red and Dogfishhead 90. I drank both early into my beer drinking experiences, and adored both as soon as I tasted them. The former is a fantastic Belgian trappist dubbel ale (don't let the word ""belgian"" scare you after your bad blue moon experience,  completely different beers, and this one is actually belgian). Lots of malty, fruity, and yeasty goodness here, blew my mind, and started my voyage to truly great beer. The latter is a malted sort of Imperial Ipa, which may sound scary, but I drank this beer while in the throes of my PBR pounding days and fell in love immediately.  Maybe you will too, though I admit that Ipas generally take a bit to get into. Other than that, mix and match, you're certain to find something you love!"

beer,3ctkgo,BeerTengoku,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:33:52 2015 UTC,"In addition to the pale ales and pilsners that other users have mentioned, I'd also suggest giving brown ales a shot. It's hard to go wrong with Sam Smith Nut Brown Ale. Like you, I am not a fan of wheat beers and I found IPAs too hoppy initially, but brown ales were just right.  My best advice, though, is to find a quality bottle shop near you with a good craft beer selection and employees who know their stuff. They will help direct you to what's locally available, and they can make recommendations that grow with your tastes."

beer,3crrgh,RuskiesInTheWarRoom,9,Fri Jul 10 12:59:25 2015 UTC,Exactly! This is why I bought the aluminum growlers from CCB. They also don't 'look' like growlers and can be a bit more incognito if going to a park or beach that doesn't officially allow alcohol.

beer,3crrgh,Naturebrah,13,Sun Jul 12 15:16:18 2015 UTC,"Alright, I've got nothing better to do tonight and I recently went through the growler research process so I'll pass on my knowledge and hope it's helpful to you.  Yes, the material a growler is made of is important in keeping freshness but what's much, much more important is the seal. In my experience, most glass growlers are cheaper and therefore have cheaper seals, which is supposed to keep the bad air out and the good CO2 in. Glass also doesn't keep as much light out as aluminum or stainless steel, but it won't make too much difference if you're transporting your growler from beer source to fridge then fridge to stomach.  As far as keeping your beer colder for longer out of a fridge and in transit, the material matters somewhat but the real game changer is if the growler is double-walled with a vacuum between those two walls to stop the transfer of heat entering the growler and subsequent suds.   Another point to take into consideration is how long you want to store the beer. The main issue is keeping that vital CO2 in the bottle. Glass growlers never got me past a week before I noticed a drop in beer quality. My Miir growler I recently purchased kept beer straight-from-tap quality three weeks later. The other top-tier, double-walled/vacuum growler out there is the Hydroflask, which is essentially equal in performance to the Miir. I chose Miir because I dig what their company stands for and from other reviews I've read, it has a slightly better seal.   Yeah, both of these growlers cost you a pretty penny but they're also going to last you decades most likely. Plus the performance is outrageous. In my own tests, the beer inside only rose 3-4 degrees F after 8-10 hours of being outside during Texas summer afternoons in direct sunlight (90-96F). With the same circumstances and a glass or non-insulated stainless steel model you'd get some super skunky beer. Also keep in mind that once you pop the top, you've really gotta consume it all that same day. I've tried resealing on many growlers and the carbonation is never up to par.   One smaller point to keep in mind is some growlers don't come with the General Surgeons warning label and some spots won't fill unless you've got that label. Both the Hydroflask and Miir growlers have them printed discretely on the bottom.  So all in all, it comes down to lifestyle. I go backpacking with my Miir and have some super fresh, crisp, cold beer after a day of hiking. If you're only going to be consuming at home and will be drinking it within a few days, the glass ones are more economical. In my mind, if you're going to pay for top quality beer, the investment in the best growler to protect that beer is the way to go.  I think I covered everything. If you have more questions, lay em on me!  Edit: I forgot to mention that some breweries only allow fills from their own growlers they sell so watch for that."
beer,3crrgh,Housman,2,Fri Jul 10 07:55:05 2015 UTC,"Wow man, thank you for all that information. I really liked the 3-4 differential in direct Texas sunlight part. I will definitely check those growlers out. And yeah that surgeon general warning was going to be my next question about them but we're good. I will be sure to spread the word of the Miir and Hydroflask. Safety & Peace."

Always traveling with glass is a pain even though I have a couple of the sweet beer stien growlers from Germany.  As long as the metal one is filled to the top, the seals are fantastic and easily replaced after time. I still collect the glass ones and I have some badass vintage VT glass but day to day, I'm using metal."
beer,3crrgh,BeerForThought,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:28:57 2015 UTC,My issue with metal ones is that a lot of them don't seem to have been designed with pouring in mind at all--they have these huge opening mouths on some of the designs.
beer,3crrgh,Tb0ne,2,Fri Jul 10 15:34:44 2015 UTC,Growler beer should only be around 3 days at most. The two primary advantages of aluminum are durability and insulation (Double wall vaccum).  It's honestly not that big of a deal. Just drink beer.

The Oklahoma distributors have no intention of letting something like single-strength cold distribution get to a ballot, and if it did they would surely rally heavily against it.

It used to be that Saturday morning growler lines were 2+ hours long but I haven't heard much in the past 5 or 6 months, so that may have changed.

And I'll return to the idea that a brewery that puts out a product called Wake n' Bake is more likely to be making another weed reference than sending a shout out to ecig smokers.

All of the beer folks in town either loathe it or are indifferent to it, because it's not really what craft beer drinkers are looking for.    But they are currently brewing at capacity and cannot meet demand for many of their beers now, mainly because they can't brew enough of this beer.    However, because of the financial stability of having this beer sell so well is that they can start to experiment with barrel aging and oddball one-off beers without worrying if they can pay the electric bill at the end of the month.  Some people don't like craft beer.  Some of those people will never like it.  But they will drink this beer.  And that's fine."
beer,3ctsga,TheoreticalFunk,2,Fri Jul 10 18:49:13 2015 UTC,"I think you hit the nail on the head. I left the article open for interpretation, but I think you conclude what many of these smaller people can do with a sweet beer. Now some, like the contract brewed root beer, or the unstoppable BBC making their own shandy label, don't have to worry about daily logistics of a tiny brewery and how they are going to expand. As long as someone like Mother Earth keeps making great styles outside of their vanilla ale, and the vanilla ale is something that can help them expand, I'm happy for it.  What I do worry is if too many breweries who are already financially stable, flood the market with sweet ales, cashing in on the success, and motivating others to oversaturate the market. Where one might see a decent lineup of new beers or seasonals from breweries, we'll just be getting sweet ales. It could happen, seeing the success of the contract-brewed Root Beer, which now outsells any other craft beer six pack at many liquor stores nation-wide."
beer,3ctsga,TheoreticalFunk,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:57:01 2015 UTC,"I think people are going to do what intrigues them or what they think they need to do to be financially viable.  Most people want to support local brands these days, and as long as we can hold onto that I'm not worried about what BMC or some other large corporate entity does.    They're doing it because they're losing currently."
beer,3ctsga,CBFisaRapist,6,Fri Jul 10 19:09:38 2015 UTC,"I think here on the ground floor is the right time to let consumers know these beverages are alcopop   I don't think they all are alcopops, though. Several of those are legitimate beers, brewed and fermented like any other, that happen to have fruit flavoring. They're no more alcopops than, say, Lindemans Framboise, which is intensely sweet, too.  In some cases, you greatly exaggerate the flavoring and sweetness, too. Hell or High Watermelon, for instance, can't be mistaken for anything but beer."
beer,3ctsga,turkeypants,4,Fri Jul 10 22:36:36 2015 UTC,"You are in some cases saying that these beers are like alcopops and in other cases are actually calling them alcopops. And you're saying a trend in craft beer is alcopops. Just so nobody else gets confused, I think I get your drift and you're not actually claiming that any of the beer-beers are technically classed as alcopops, but rather are just using that term figuratively and broadly to also describe flavored beers that might be seen as direct competitors and equivalents to alcopops because of their taste and targeting. I don't think you're saying alcopops are a trend in craft beer, but rather that craft beers that may resemble the sweet flavors of alcopops are a trend in craft beer.  For anyone else playing along at home, my somewhat dim understanding of how alcopops differ from beer is that after a similar boiling of grain (with no hops or perhaps low hops) and subsequent fermentation process, they're filtered so much that about all that's left is a basically neutral and clear base of water and some of the original ethanol, and then they add in external ethanol, flavorings, colorings, etc. to arrive at what is effectively a premade cocktail soda.   From what I gather this is really just an end run around laws that would otherwise prevent liquor drinks from being sold at places that are only licensed to sell beer, such as gas stations and grocery stores in many states. So the grain boiling and fermentation steps technically qualify it as a beer equivalent in the eyes of the law, but then are rendered mostly redundant by the filtering if I understand correctly.   So what you basically get is a product that is the same as if they'd just started with water, ethanol, flavorings, and colorings, and then carbonated it, namely a cocktail or alcoholic soda, not a beer. Maybe the distinction doesn't matter too much in the end if you like whatever you're drinking, but some will be interested in the comparative processes and the different things we name the results.  Apparently in Europe they just make premade cocktails and don't bother with these end-run brewing/filtering steps. That's done here too to a lesser extent but you can't sell that kind in places only licensed to sell beer because it hasn't jumped through the silly hoops."

Sort of. Alcopops being made of beer or a beer-like product is only really true in the American market. Everywhere else they'll use a distilled spirit of some kind. Generally just neutral grain alcohol, although you get exceptions like Bacardi Breezers. But essentially alcopops are products that are alcohols mixed with flavourings and sweeteners so that they taste like a soft drink.  I haven't tried any of the ones they've listed but the Root Beer one and maybe the last one sound like alcopops.  Although the root beer doesn't seem to have been marketed as a beer (I could be wrong on that).   With things like the cherry wheat, they're something else. While they aren't typical beers, like we'd expect them to be, they still definitely taste different from a cherry soda."
beer,3ctsga,turkeypants,2,Sat Jul 11 16:57:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah I mentioned the other type of alcopop in my last paragraph, the ones in Europe for example that don't have to jump through these weird legal hoops sense these laws only apply here. We have their kind too but you can't get them in places only licensed to sell beer.  On the cherry wheat, that was the whole point of my comment. Not the same thing as an alcopop. Just sweeter and fruitier than regular beer.  The root beer in question was in fact marketed as a craft beer. That's the whole reason I got interested in this process and in the distinctions because it just doesn't seem to me that that is a beer at all. There are rumors that it is made like a gruit, but I don't think I believe it. I imagine it's just another alcopop. They are very cagey about the process and avoid questions about it. They marketed it as a craft beer, seemingly astroturfy grassroots style through the craft beer community, and they refer to it that way and call it an ale on the bottle, which some say indicates that it is different from an alcopop. But I bet it's just like the other alcopops."

Also, I'm too young to have experienced Zima, but all of the intense hate I've seen it get makes me really curious as to what it actually tasted like."
beer,3ctsga,concretepigeon,2,Fri Jul 10 21:49:23 2015 UTC,"There's a definite difference. Fruit beers don't taste like beer in a way you'd expect, but they don't just taste like a soft drink. Alcopops just taste like carbonated soft drinks."

The rest of these are actually beer, not alcopop (although the Shandy has a little bit of both going on.) You can sweeten or add flavors to a beer, and have it still be beer."

beer,3ctsga,brettyv82,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:44:07 2015 UTC,"I have no physical proof, but while the bottle says ""Small Town Brewery"" which is a relatively new, small brewery in Illinois, most of it is actually contract brewed by City Brewery in Wisconsin, which makes Smirnoff Ice, a well-known alcopop. Also, Small Town Brewery is definitely co-owned by Phusion, which is the same company that makes Four Loko. So, it's owned and made by companies made famous by alcopops. It's circumstantial, yes, but seeing as everyone I know who has tried it said it tastes just like root beer and nothing like actual beer, I'm inclined to believe this is the case."
beer,3ctsga,turkeypants,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:57:26 2015 UTC,"Right, but we knew all those details already (multiple threads on this in past weeks). And all but a few were suspecting alcopop while one guy had it secondhand that it wasn't, and another guy said that because the label says ""ale"" that means it qualifies as beer according to the government regulation definition. I was wanting to know if you had proof. But you're just like the rest of us, suspecting. I don't think you should state it definitively like that unless you have actual info. That same contract brew facility makes some actual beer beers too, for example, and there are various other caveats to our suspicions about the brewery's ownership and origins. Again, we're on the same wavelength here but neither of us actually know for sure."
beer,3ctsga,brettyv82,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:12:05 2015 UTC,"My comment was mostly pointing out the inaccuracy of OP's use of ""alcopop,"" so if NYFRB is actually beer, then his list is 100% incorrect, since every other one listed is actually beer with flavors added, and not ""malt beverage"" like Mike's Hard Lemonade or Smirnoff."

People wanted to try it because of the name, but Stone, thinking customers wanted to try it or gift it just because of the name, forced the customers at beer trade shows to try their range of beers before letting them on the Arrogant Bastard Ale.  If the sweet beers get people interested in the brewery and as such, are active in finding and trying the rest of the range of the beers, then well done.  For me, I'm not a big fan of fruit beers as I find them too sweet or too gimmicky. However, I do Coronado's Orange Wit beer and also Baird Yuzu Garden Ale. There are others too but I forgot."

So am I any different?   In a way I'm not. But I think it's sort of like you've said here. It's about the extent. I also think it's about the intent. If you wanted to anger, insult, and inflame a lot of Muslims in the current political climate, you'd be hard pressed to come up with too many better ideas than a pig in a niqab and text that makes allusions to terrorism and appropriates your faith's main exclamation of worship to its god. And then to make it a commercial product and send it out there unprovoked, no context, and try to buzz it up, that just really comes across as a deliberately ugly and hostile shot.   Their one about Catholics made fun of the Popemobile as an ice cream truck, which I don't think would be a specific insult to anyone. And it depicted the pope as a dinosaur, possibly in reference to the raptor bishop/Jesus meme, or maybe he's a predator, or maybe a suggestion that the concept of pope was an outdated or fossilized one or something. Not sure. So I could see someone saying, ""that's disrespectful to the pope and to us"" but it seems pretty bland. The one line about ""The kids cream! For brett cream!"" when paired with the idea of a predator in an ice cream van could refer to the sex abuse scandal. That's pretty prickly territory but seems like pretty deserved criticism of how the church officially handled the scandal (as opposed to ""all muslims are terrorists because Islam"").  The one about Mormons had a guy in his undies in a recliner while women tidied house and poured him coffee. The text went straight for polygamy and then straight into sexism and then mocked the ""magic underwear"". That one's pretty deliberately offensive but would seem to invite a weary sigh and an eye roll from Mormons rather than something deeper. Maybe a Mormon could comment, but I think they just see the automatic polygamy references as ancient history that lives on like a zombie in the public dialogue.  The Scientology one name drops Xenu and thetans and depicts a hoppy Xenu figure and that's pretty much it. Not exactly a love letter to Scientologists but pretty lazy and light as insults go.  Nobody would care about the atheist one. It depicts a monkey in a scientist's lab coat and likens the beer's development to evolution. No real feelings to offend there and maybe that's why it does a pretty poor job of pricking a target.  I know what I do and don't believe and am not going to let anybody push religion on me or let them hijack some issue with it as though it's the governing reality, but I still think I should probably be less wisecracky and mocking about religion in casual chat when I know religious people who haven't done anything to me will see it and will take it as a barb. But that still seems like a smaller and different thing than this. This seems more like an agenda - a visible, public, and ugly one."

It has that anachronistically inappropriate feeling of if you were to hear a racist joke in 2015 of the kind that would have passed in the 1980s. I think that's the only other one that's really deliberately just an ugly slap, but even that one isn't as bad. The Catholic one is less clear but I think they're hitting the papacy (as opposed to all Catholics, or Catholicism) on the handling of the child abuse scandal, which is pretty hard to feel bad for them about. And they were also more subtle about it.   The Islam one would be hard to top without some stereotypey angry/evil bearded guy in robes and a head cloth with a dynamite vest and a nametag that said Muhammad and exploding towers behind him. But a pig in a niqab and terroristy text that contorts one of their main exclamations is not too far off. A veiled pig? Allahu Alpha? Explosion themes? Seriously?! Yikes.   Let's see their Jewish one. Will it be that big-nosed 4chan caricature guy circumcising a camel, with text about a final solution for controlling the banks? ""Oh ho ho, just poking fun.""  I'm not a big fan of religion but I think the whole series was just a tasteless publicity stunt. It's certainly working."
beer,3cpibt,RuskiesInTheWarRoom,5,Fri Jul 10 02:21:22 2015 UTC,"None of the others approach the clear inflammatory efforts that this one does. None of the others perpetuate -phobic stereotypes. None of the others promote fear and dismissal in the same way. None of the others brand the religion as a pure violence. This distinction is what makes this an Islamophobic mess.   (Edit: see this wonderful comment for links to the other labels, as well as /u/turkeypants's great thoughts and reflections: http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/3cpibt/am_i_the_only_one_who_thinks_new_alpha_went_a/csy05j0)  The equivalency would be closer if the Catholic one had the Pope with his hand in the pants of a choir boy suckling the abdominal wound of a grinning Jesus Christ. If the Scientology label skipped the trodden, easy ""Xenu"" tropes (do we really think Scientologists care if we keep making fun of Xenu? No. They don't care.), and instead had images of notable Scientologists bound and gagged by Miscavidge who was holding the Auditing files over their heads while getting off. If the Mormon label forewent ""coffee gags"" and instead depicted polygamous sects with child sister-wives being wed against their will, and abandoning young men to die.   See the thing about this attempt to justify and normalize one extreme viewpoint is that it betrays how little we know, and how phobic, we actually are.   Are we okay with depicting only the paranoid fantasy of the extreme of one religion, as representatives of the religion as a whole (""nobody whined when we did the other religions!""), and pretending at all that Jack Mormons drinking coffee and the Popemobile are any way equivalents? We shouldn't be. What this does is lift and normalize only the extreme and wrong, depiction of one religion, while maintains the status quo of another.  It's a pathetic, intellectually dishonest position to take.  This label is Islamophobic, potential xenophobic, and utterly wrong, and their effort to justify it is equally so.  Edit: also, it isn't funny. The other labels are actually witty and clever. People who find this ""funny"" find outrage, but not meaning, to be funny. They're on board with the label's representation."

Hair of the Dog makes a very nice IPA, but their strong suit is their heavier beers, which are great, but not necessarily what you want in summer (barleywines and strong ales). Deschutte's brewpub has a lot of stuff that they don't bottle, and it's often quite good.  Bailey's Taproom, Hawthorne Hophouse, and Green Dragon are both excellent bars with a wide variety of stuff, much of it local and interesting. Talk to the bartenders, as they will know what's good and what to recommend.   Also, unlike most other cities in the States, many restaurants in PDX serve great, interesting beer. As in they are likely to have taps or bottles that aren't down the street at a bar that also has good beer, so not just the delicious but ubiquitous Bell's, Lagunitas or whatever else there is elsewhere."

Beer is usually an acquired taste and you want to have a good time and enjoy yourself on your birthday. Cider on the other hand is pretty palatable and tasty and easy right away for most people. Thinks like Mike's Hard Lemonade are pretty easy to drink. And cocktails can be made to be fun and tasty in the right proportions. Screwdrivers are easy (vodka, OJ). Rum and coke or bourbon and coke. Dark and stormy (rum, ginger beer, lime). Any kind of juice plus seltzer plus vodka plus a squeeze of lemon or lime.  If you're going to go with beer and will be drinking in volume, you might consider Blue Moon. It's an easy-drinking, mild, round wheat beer that a lot of people use as a palatable stepstone into better beer. It's a bit sweeter and tastier than your average Budweiser-type lager.   Even easier to drink might be something like a Leinenkugel Summer Shandy. That'll be very easy to drink. Very lemony.

Oktoberfest beers are typically a bit stronger flavored than the Vienna style. Sometimes big U.S. brewers call their Vienna style  ""Amber."" These styles of beer tend to be more malt heavy and rely less on hops flavor or bitterness.  If you live near a Trader Joe's they have a really great (and cheap, as in $5.99 a sixer) Vienna Style which is under their label, but brewed for them by Gordon Biersch.   Try searching for Vienna styles and you'll be right in the ballpark of what you're looking for.

My wife and I will go there during happy hour and after hours when their beer is half off.  I had a terrible experience at Aces and Ales.  The service was horrible (4pm on a Tuesday) with no customers in the place and it took 5 minutes to order a beer and wait for the bartender to stop texting to pour it.

beer,3co0ry,I_LIKE_BASKETBALL,2,Thu Jul 9 13:15:56 2015 UTC,"How are we being screwed on price for session beers? The malt and hops are a very minimal contributor to the price of beer. Packaging alone costs more than all the ingredients combined. http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-09-11-CraftBeerInfographic.jpg (I'm usually wary of Huffington post, but I've talked to several brewers who have backed this up as accurate)"
beer,3co0ry,DrinkCraftBeerJeff,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:18:45 2015 UTC,"While I accept the politics of distribution probably complicated the matter more than I implied, the point is that an imperial stout (for example) isn't just malt and hops, is it?

beer,3co0ry,I_LIKE_BASKETBALL,2,Thu Jul 9 14:23:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand...what else is an imperial stout other than malt and hops (well, water and yeast too, but I don't think you mean that).  And yeah, an impy stout has to ferment longer, which is an opportunity cost for sure.  But how many session IPAs are you seeing priced at the same cost as Imp Stout? Maybe I'm missing something? I've always heard the argument before that session beer should be less expensive than regular strength beer...haven't seen many comparisons between imperials and sessions."
beer,3co0ry,z_smalls,0,Thu Jul 9 14:57:41 2015 UTC,"It's not that uncommon for brewers to use additional ingredients such as coffee, as well as specialty malts and hops that are more expensive. My feeling is that basic session ales hardly ever do, yet we never see that reflected in the pricing. Perhaps 8.99 a sixer really is the average after all of the distribution costs, but I still don't think that's fair.  I see the price difference in tapped beer. Very common to see the lowest ABV beer is often the cheapest on the menu, while the highest costs twice as much. I just wish we were afforded the same luxury in bottles."
beer,3co0ry,I_LIKE_BASKETBALL,2,Thu Jul 9 15:06:51 2015 UTC,"First, imperial stouts are almost always going to be priced higher than, say, a session IPA from the same brewery. It would be really unusual to see a counter example of that.   Second, imperial stouts definitely do use more malt, as well as (typically) more specialty grains, but they don't usually use new, expensive hops and they often don't use as much hope as a session IPA (many of them probably do, but only to get the BUs up, for which they hopefully aren't using nice, expensive hops). Also, malt is cheap. Hops aren't.   While session IPAs don't use as much malt, the hops they use are going to usually be the sought-after, expensive varieties and they're going to use massive amounts of them if they want to make a really great example.   If you see a cream ale priced like an imperial stout, then maybe there's a problem. Session IPAs, however, are really expensive to make."
beer,3co0ry,bgrueyw,0,Thu Jul 9 16:28:32 2015 UTC,"You haven't really explained why sessions are ""really"" expensive to make, though. Apart from the ones with rare hops or whatever, they are, by design, very simple beers and very quick to make. I'm not talking about all sessions being the same price as all stouts, it was an example to illustrate lack of price disparity. And the more pertinent example being my previous post:    I see the price difference in tapped beer. Very common to see the lowest ABV beer is often the cheapest on the menu, while the highest costs twice as much. I just wish we were afforded the same luxury in bottles.   Which would strongly imply it's all distribution politics. If that's the way it is then that's the way it is, but I'm not really buying that Even Keel should be $15 a 12 pack, while Orabelle (8.7%) is $9.99 a six pack. And I get it - different businesses, different availability, different levels of demand - but at the end of the day, this disparity is consistent across the board. It's not a coincidence. It's not a coincidence that the universal average price for a bomber is $10, when you can often get twice as much of that beer in bottles for the same or less money.   It's just a popular product being sold at what the market is willing to pay, it's not a genuine reflection of costs and labor most of the time."
beer,3co0ry,Terrorsaurus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:03:12 2015 UTC,"Orabelle is a tripel, which is lightly hopped with Pilsner base malt, maybe a touch of specialty malt and a sizable amount of sugar. I would imagine that from an ingredient standpoint a 4.5% session IPA costs at least as much as a tripel. Just an aside to point out that ABV != ingredient costs."
beer,3co0ry,Pisthetaerus,0,Fri Jul 10 17:51:24 2015 UTC,"It doesn't account for the various costs of different beer styles. What particular type of craft beer does this represent? Sam Adams Boston Lager? Old Rasputin? Heady Topper? It doesn't say. Premium hops like Citra cost a lot; much MUCH more than the grain bill for an average beer, even an imperial stout.  I don't disagree with you though on the wider point.  I'm just taking issue here with people claiming Session IPAs should cost less than stouts because of the smaller grain bill. That argument annoys me. Your point about packaging, distribution, and retail costing the most still stands for all craft beer production."

Not NY state but also awesome if it's still available  Troegs Scratch #195 Vermont Style DIPA - brewed for Rochester Beer Week (so it sort of counts as NY?), which was the second week of June so it would still be pretty fresh if they have any left.

beer,3clqa8,DEEJANGO,2,Thu Jul 9 02:05:04 2015 UTC,Something local.
beer,3clqa8,dancetar,2,Thu Jul 9 03:03:32 2015 UTC,"See if you can get your hands on black house by modern times, victory at sea/sea monster by ballast point (these two are imperial porters/stouts). also check out hanger 24 or bootleggers brewery. They both have good stuff but they are both SoCal places."
beer,3clqa8,ems88,4,Thu Jul 9 16:09:51 2015 UTC,"You don't seem to have much Belgian or Belgian-Style (Stella doesn't count, Blue Moon only half counts...).  You could go classic Belgian with Chimay, Duvel, or Delirium Tremens.  I find pale Belgian styles to be a little more popular, at least with my clientele.  Saisons and Tripels in particular.  Allagash, Ommegang, and Unibroue all make great Belgian-style beers.  North Coast's saison Le Merle is rather tasty.  As for sours there aren't too many that are consistently available and priced at an approachable level.  A nice option is the Anderson Valley Gose (pronounced go-suh) which is a German-style salted sour wheat beer.  It's like adult Gatorade.  It's quickly become a staff favorite at my bar.  Another is Snapshot, a lightly tart wheat beer from New Belgium.  It's a little less extreme than most sours, so it's less likely to turn people off who aren't already converted.  As for craft stout, I'll second Old Rasputin as a solid option (available on Nitro only).  Obsidian Stout or Black Butte Porter from Deschutes are also good options, so long as you don't mind duplicating from the same brewery.  If you'd like any further info or recommendations, feel free to ask.  I manage a craft cocktail bar just over the hill in Santa Cruz with 12 taps and about 14 bottles/cans."
beer,3clqa8,andylion,4,Thu Jul 9 06:20:47 2015 UTC,"Just want to second (third?) everything ems88 has to say.   A lot of the changes I would recommend would involve ""upgrading"" beers like Blue Moon or Stella to higher quality beers like Allagash White, Tank 7, Snap Shot, or any good local wit or saison.   A combination of Old Rasputin and Black Butte Porter would really up your selection on dark beers and adequately satisfy folks looking for either big or sessionable stouts and porters.  One point mentioned elsewhere that is definitely worth considering is rotating taps. Obviously you'll want to keep your most popular beers, but you've got enough taps and enough overlap in styles that you could easily scale back on the pale ales and IPAs and instead offer more variety. Personally I'd recommend having a rotating IPA, a rotating ""session"", a rotating big beer, and a rotating oddity (like sours).   Having new beers regularly coming into the bar gives folks a reason to keep coming back."
beer,3clqa8,andylion,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:12:12 2015 UTC,"You are absolutey right about a rotating tap, probably more than one.  I am hesitant to ""upgrade"" some of the staples because even though we could find better, some of our clientele just want what they want, and that's OK.  As far as IPA's rotating is an option, or possibly dropping one to even things out.  We are clearly out of balance.  Thank you for your time."
beer,3clqa8,theabsence,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:49:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you for responding!  I understand wanting to have some consistency in your offerings for regulars, and if I'm understanding your original post correctly it sounds like you are adding an additional 8 taps to the ones currently listed. If thats the case then I think you could easily add a couple solid Belgian beers, Old Rasputin, Black Butte Porter and still have four ""themed"" rotating taps. You could even sacrifice one of the current IPA taps and make it a rotating IPA tap and use one of the four new themed rotating taps for local beer.   Having four rotating taps also gives you the ability to do some limited tap takeovers, which as others have mentioned is another great way to add variety and drive business."
beer,3clqa8,ems88,3,Fri Jul 10 12:17:32 2015 UTC,"I back this guy entirely. In the end though, it all depends on what sells at your bar. I will say that people love rarity and tap takeovers so make friends with your distributors.  Funny enough, I was up in Santa Cruz within the last year and there's a good chance I've had a pint at whatever bar you run. I love that town."
beer,3clqa8,theabsence,3,Thu Jul 9 06:45:32 2015 UTC,"Awesome!  I run 515 Kitchen & Cocktails, which is downtown but just off the main drag.  We're just across the street from Lupulo, which is an AMAZING craft beer bar.  We have more of a cocktail/restaurant focus, so we don't have nearly as many rare/unusual offerings.  However, over the last year we started doing four rotating taps including a local tap (mostly Sante Adairius Rustic Ales), a sour, a Bruery tap, and a ""Rotating Craft Draft"" which in practice is Allagash limited release about half of the time and other delicious beer the rest of it.  If you come back to Santa Cruz, come on by!  I'll even make you a fantastic IPA cocktail."

We need to add a strong one though.  Same with Sours, I'm very curious about the Anderson Valley you mentioned, thank you.

The spent grain is passed on to farmers. The yeast is discarded. Eating yeast like that will have some unpleasant side effects to say the least.    the ethanol from the yeast was refined until it was pure enough to start mixing with petrol   Yeast isn't made of ethanol, it produces ethanol when allowed to ferment sugars.   TL;DR: Their explanations are entirely wrong, but should have read that the same yeast recovered from beer's post-fermentation can also be re-used to ferment out <whatever>, which can then be distilled into ethanol. Re-using yeast is hardly new, brewers have been doing it for generations. They just use beer yeast strains instead of whatever other yeast strains they were using before because brewers were throwing it out anyways as it can only be re-used so many times in beer making."

I love hearing about the science-y stuff, and offering free tastings of course always helps. Maybe the only thing I can suggest is to make it interactive? I always get excited when a tour guide asks a question to the audience and I'm able to answer it. If you don't mind me asking, which brewery do you work at?"
beer,3cn7tb,LukeSka-walker,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:53:24 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I've only done one tour and it was at Stone. However I can tell you that my friend and I had different opinions on the tour. I thought it was good, she wasn't as impressed. She's been to more of them than I have, and she says that getting into the specifics of how the beer is made is boring because all tours do it. So I would say that while the science is cool, I would be careful not to focus too much on that part as pretty much every brewery tour out there discusses this. Instead I would say to spend more time discussing the methods and/or materials that are unique to your brand.  I agree with the other comment here that the more interactive and engaging you can make it, the better. The Stone tour guide started off discussing who the biggest sellers of craft beer in the US are. It was a fun and engaging question that got everyone involved. That was definitely one of my favorite parts."

I get that it's an easier design than using any of the myriad compounds important for taste in beer or wine, but still ethanol vapor retention is one of my lowest priorities in glassware use.

beer,3ck2j1,von_Barbarian,2,Wed Jul 8 18:14:30 2015 UTC,"I think it does matter, to an extent. For me, shaker pints and other flat sided glasses never promote good aroma in any of the beers I drink. Aroma is one of the most important parts about drinking beer, so I feel it's worth it for me to go out of my way to use a glass that helps. While I have found that certain shapes promote aroma more, I think the key is to at least have enough headspace in your glass where you can stick your nose in and actually smell your beer. I have dozens of different styles of glass at home, but when I have a bottle share, I tend to bring out the Ikea 6/6$ wine glasses because they are cheap and I have a lot of them. That being said, if I could get my hands on 10 Tekus, I would probably use those instead.   Some people may not care and would prefer to drink out of the bottle or out of a can or plastic cup, and that doesn't bother me at all, but I find that I enjoy the beer more when I can get the full experience. I also am a brewer, so any sensory experiences I can get from the beer help greatly in my ability to create great beer."

I also have a couple of tulip glasses, a Spiglau/Dogfish IPA glass, and a few others from brewery tours. In my experience, stemmed glasses are better simply because your beer stays colder. The pilsner (which sadly broke) and IPA glasses are fantastic for any lighter ale or lager, because they stay colder and seem to increase carbonation. That being said, I don't notice any noticeable difference between any of the stemmed glasses, be they tulip or Belgian style or whatever else they may be called. Anything rounded on a stem seems to be about the same. The giant wheat glass I have is stupid and pointless. There's no way to drink the whole thing before it goes warm, and no one wants a warm wheat beer."

beer,3chrhh,bbucksjoe,8,Wed Jul 8 00:28:56 2015 UTC,"Nova Scotian checking in. Our craft beer boom is in full swing right now.  Depends on where you go, of course, but I personally would recommend Propellor Brewing in the city, Hell Bay and Boxing Rock in the South Shore, Sea Level in the Annapolis Valley, Tatamagouche Brewing Company (nearish to the NB border!), and Big Spruce in Cape Breton.  There's also a good variety of brewpubs, and multiple other breweries province wide not to mention wineries and distilleries too!  If you're looking for a couple different bottles to try I'd recommend Bishops Cellar or Rockhead  (liquor stores in Halifax), they have a good assortment of local choices so you don't have to visit every one!  Hope that helps on the Nova Scotia front!"
beer,3chrhh,goweld,2,Wed Jul 8 01:17:10 2015 UTC,This is exactly the type of answer I was looking for. I'll try to hit some of those if possible and if I can't I will definitely grab some bottles and try some of the local stuff. Thanks !
beer,3chrhh,jburley2,3,Wed Jul 8 02:20:25 2015 UTC,Also if you're down south shore way there's a distillery in Lunenburg called Ironworks.  They make awesome rum and a smattering of other spirits if you're into that kind of thing.  Plus Lunenburg is a great tourist town to go for a visit.
beer,3chrhh,jamesbrowski,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:01:16 2015 UTC,Definitely about that rum life haha. I will check it out if we get a chance to go to the south shore.
beer,3chrhh,goweld,2,Wed Jul 8 03:41:40 2015 UTC,"Was just in NS for a few days.  I always forget how great the propellor esb is.  I like the Garrison Tall Ship Amber as well.  It can be frustrating how narrow the beer selection is in many of the NSLC's, though.  They do well by local brewers, but they really ought to rotate out a few of the micro offerings from other regions in Canada and the US.  Even if it's just the 22 oz format, it has to be annoying for the gov't to have a monopoly on beer while simultaneously limiting the selection available."
beer,3chrhh,jamesbrowski,2,Wed Jul 8 13:47:16 2015 UTC,"It's incredibly irritating. I don't live in the city, so I'm limited to our local NSLC... and if I'm looking for craft beer or wine from a province outside of the Maritimes, I'm out of luck!  Most shelf space is limited to large scale international or national producers, leaving no room for the interesting stuff. At least we have local!"
beer,3chrhh,goweld,2,Wed Jul 8 14:23:17 2015 UTC,"It's good that local brewers are there to fill the void.  I wonder if there is a possibility for a businessman to partner with NSLC to offer international craft selection.  Even in Halifax, most liquor commissions only offer the ""big name"" micro brewers from the US, Quebec, Ontario, etc."
beer,3chrhh,thecheeseface,2,Thu Jul 9 18:18:55 2015 UTC,"I feel like, at this point, there must be a reason that hasn't happened. Then again, maybe I should look into it!"

If a specific beer you like isn't available in PA, it just means that the brewery has not yet decided to distribute it there, and there are a ton of potential reasons for that.  Ask your bars/beer stores about stocking it, or call the brewery and ask about their distribution.    It's not like there's a law against it..."
beer,3ckb9g,soylentgringo,-3,Wed Jul 8 16:58:11 2015 UTC,"I remember asking New Belgium, for example, as to why they don't sell beer into PA about 6 years ago.

Maybe I had misinterpreted these ""zones"" as the counties that I mentioned.  Lets say they have a high demand around Philly, and want to sell there.  They cannot only sell in that zone, and must purchase the zone license for ALL the other zones.  That makes more sense, and tying that with the bullshit of being a Commonwealth, makes a lot more sense.  Never heard of ""The Blue Laws""?"
beer,3ckb9g,soylentgringo,3,Wed Jul 8 17:29:27 2015 UTC,"Blue laws refer to the set of laws restricting the sale of alcohol, and they kind of suck in PA.  In maybe the last decade, some strides have been made, but they still suck.  Beer distributors must be separate from wine & spirits stores (the latter are state-owned, and can't sell Everclear, for example), and you can only sell full cases.  You can finally buy alcohol (outside of a bar) on Sundays or past 9pm on weeknights.  You can buy 6-packs at a bar, but you can only carry out 2 at a time.  No beer in gas stations or convenience stores (there are a few gas stations with ""cold rooms"" full of...soda, hoping the laws relax someday).  You can finally buy beer in (some) grocery stores, but only if they have a separate ""beer garden"" area, and only until 10pm.  If a brewery wants to sell beer on tap, they have to serve some kind of food (you see a lot of pretzels for this reason), and it has to be separate from where they sell cases of bottles.  And so on...it's complicated and it sucks."

beer,3chxwr,Journeyman351,3,Wed Jul 8 01:22:56 2015 UTC,"Big Top, J Dubs, and Darwins are probably the three most popular breweries in the area. I wouldn't say any of them are spectacular, but I wasn't a fan of my experience at J Dubs (no flights, no AC). Big Top was okay, and I've never been to Darwins.   Located next to Darwins is the Mandeville Beer Garden, which is a cool place that serves good food. I'd say that is a must visit. They get kegs of stuff from the three breweries I mentioned, and the atmosphere is way better.  Motorworks in Bradenton (just north of Sarasota) has an awesome atmosphere. Beer is decent, nothing great, but the grounds (bocce courts, corn hole, live entertainment, and food trucks) makes this one my favorite place in the area.  Honestly, St Pete and Tampa has the better breweries (as mentioned in another comment). Try CCB's Cucumber Saison, their seasonal release. You can get it at Total Wine or ABC liquor.  Not beer related, but you should definitely go to Siesta Key Rum...best rum in America, hands down."
beer,3chxwr,fsubones,2,Wed Jul 8 01:54:29 2015 UTC,"Ooh, that all sounds great. I planned on spending most of my beer adventuring in either St. Petersburg or Tampa, as I won't actually be in Sarasota all too often (or so I hope). I'm staying with my aunt and uncle, and I am interested in making a couple days out of St. Petersburg and Tampa before I leave. I would love to experience Sarasota in general, but it seems the other two aforementioned cities are MUCH more interesting in terms of nightlife and beer.   With that said, I will totally check out Siesta Key Rum. I'm planning on spending a day in/around Siesta Key Beach because.... I've only been at East Coast beaches."
beer,3chxwr,abombinreverse,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:09:23 2015 UTC,"As a sarasota native, Don't bother going to darwins, their priorities are on making money not about good business or the beer scene in general. Darwins main restaurant (the one next to mandeville) actually just closed Monday supposedly because the ""homeless"" population was too big of a problem and kept customers from coming in.  I also went to the main brewery three weeks ago since I hadn't been there in a while and they tried to charge me $4 for a 4 oz pour of any of their seasonals.   While the atmospheres aren't the best ever go to jdubs and big top. The people working at both really care about the beer and make some really good stuff. Big top's flagship beers aren't anything special but their seasonals and one offs are on point. Last time I was there I had a key lime wheat that was killer.   The only other places I'd hit up that haven't been mentioned is green bench in downtown st pete and coppertail in Tampa. Green bench has come a long way and are getting pretty good at making sours and coppertail just finished their new facility and it's gorgeous. Their trippel is also really good."

Unfortunately, I'm not as familiar with Sarasota, which is about 45 mins away from Tampa or St Pete the drive is not bad at all, and I do recommend a day trip. Sarasota has Big Top, and there are certainly several more in the area.  Both Cycle and Cigar City are phenomenal. In St Pete, where Cycle is located, you also have Green Bench, 3 Daughters, and several more terrific breweries to try. My favorite on that side of the bay, 7venth Sun, is further north in Clearwater.  In Tampa, where CCB is located, highlights include Coppertail, which is the new big-boy on the block, and that I'd highly recommend, and Angry Chair, and Southern, among others. Six Ten is a great place to drop in, without a doubt.  Depends a bit on what styles you like, but in terms of breweries worth visiting in the areas you've mentioned, these are some good options.   I'm a mod over at /r/tampabaybeer, and I'd invite you to come drop in. We'll have some more specifically tailored recommendations there."

beer,3ckl70,XTanuki,6,Wed Jul 8 17:35:15 2015 UTC,Why would you like diacetyl? Buttery beer = bad beer
beer,3ckl70,GoatLegSF,-1,Wed Jul 8 17:26:10 2015 UTC,"It's like you've never had a Newcastle or Sam Smith's Nut Brown (or for that matter their pale ale, which is loaded with diacetyl for a pale ale.)  Beers can have different flavors, and I think the (lightly!) diacetyled brown beers are great.  Which is why I was confused when I read a different article here with someone complaining about it, when it's part of the style."
beer,3ckl70,GoatLegSF,3,Wed Jul 8 17:37:40 2015 UTC,"Never had that Sam Smith's, but I surely don't like Newcastle."
beer,3ckl70,turkeypants,2,Wed Jul 8 17:41:36 2015 UTC,"I think it's one of the reasons I specifically like a number of Sam Smiths beers - from what I've read they put/leave it in there deliberately. I mean, I love butter. I love butterscotch. I love butter and toasty malty things together (bread and other baked goods). So I think it's nice and makes sense as a flavor combo if it's in there at a level that's complementary, not dominating. Movie theater popcorn fake butter taste on the other hand is not something I can see myself wanting, and I think that's how diacetyl comes across to lots of people, and I guess is one of the reasons diacetyl is seen as an error in so many styles. Or maybe they're just not ones where that flavor combo is harmonious."
beer,3ckl70,turkeypants,0,Wed Jul 8 18:32:26 2015 UTC,"I agree and would like to subscribe to your Kickstarter!  I guess my meta-point is that of all the things beer could be, it should never be boring.  The number one mistake people make when home brewing is inadequate sanitation leading to a lactic infection, resulting in undrinkable, bad, sour beer.  If I generalized from this to ""sour beer is bad"" I would be wrong!  I would be missing out on Kasteel, Duchesse du Burgogne, and the entire Flanders tradition."
beer,3ckl70,NathanPierce,2,Wed Jul 8 19:52:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm with you. One man's infection is another man's... well, desired infection.   What impresses me most in a beer anymore is complexity, which is just another way of stating your point about boringness. When they can have layers of interesting and distinct yet complementary flavors playing well together in a well-composed symphony, no matter the tune, I think that's the height of brewing art. Being able to detect these notes individually and as parts of a composite whole is so satisfying. SS Nut Brown was the first beer I'd ever had that had real complexity, which is funny to hear myself say looking back at it now. All I'd had before then was high school and college macro lagers, whose complexity was limited to notes of wet cardboard and maybe stale popcorn. I might have had a Samuel Adams Stock Ale first, can't remember, but my memory of that one was just that it was delicious by comparison to Milwaukee's Best, not that it was necessarily complex. But the Nut Brown had such rich, toasty malt, alongside caramel, alongside buttery flavor and almost buttery feel, alongside other things going on all together and I was just blown away. The buttery part was such an unexpected and welcome treat. That was my pinnacle special occasion beer for years.  These days that beer doesn't come across to me dramatically like that anymore, sadly, I guess since the bar for complexity has been set higher by so much other stuff, and since hops and char and wood and tartness and spice and other things have taken hold of my brain and are missed when not present. That one and most browns are a lot more subtle to me these days and usually not interesting. But I still remember how dramatic it was to discover. A whole new world. Beer meant something different after that point. And that's been the quest ever since - chasing harmonious and interesting complexity. A modest daily driver is nice when you just want to enjoy having some easy beers and not thinking about it, but my enthusiasm for the hobby has always been this exploration to find all the different and original things people can do with beer as a canvas. And thanks to all the variables it's basically an inexhaustible frontier. So I've got that going for me.  tldr- yeah"

They say that comes from malolactic fermentation. So the ""buttery"" flavor comes from lactic acid. Regardless of the source, if one likes butter flavors in her beverage, why not, to each her own. Now, it is my understanding that diacetyl is an infection, whereas malolactic fermentation is an intended process..."
beer,3ckl70,Ragerz78,2,Wed Jul 8 23:12:20 2015 UTC,"The buttery flavor in Chardonnay is indeed diacetyl (introduced, as you say, via malolactic fermentation).  It's one of those ""people make a mistake and then overcorrect"" sorts of things.  Diacetyl flavors can be overwhelming, bad, and terrible, and especially when homebrewing can indeed result from unintentional infections.  People taste those and overcorrect to ""all presence of the flavor is bad!""

I have a hard time recommending them to anyone because of a couple of things:  1) The price point. There are so many fantastic beers at a much more reasonable price than these two. 2) The ""dusty bottle"" syndrome that can happen because of point #1. Some of these will sit and some stores are not so good about actually putting these on sale because they probably have quite a bit of sunk cost in them on the back-end. So sometimes these will still go full price years later after they have been ""aging"" a while."
beer,3cfmnl,mancide,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:06:04 2015 UTC,I have noticed recently that the price points of some of their beers are coming down. For example a 4-pack of 16 oz Citra Summer Slacker is only $11 at my beer place.

Similar thing I experienced with Hairy Eyeball and Equinox.  I've only noticed in the past year and a half or so that it's way easier to find and usually in stock at most places."
beer,3cfmnl,Ingens_Testibus,2,Wed Jul 8 01:20:21 2015 UTC,"Okay, I was just wondering about this earlier today.

beer,3cfmnl,19Styx6,4,Wed Jul 8 01:59:55 2015 UTC,"Lagunitas may use hop extract but others do as well, like Russian River for Pliny the Elder.  Here's what Vinnie Cilurzo of Russian River says about hop extract as a tip to homebrewers to brew better IPAs:   Consider experimenting with pure resin Co2 hop extract for the bittering addition. Pure resin hop extract still needs to go through an isomerization stage in the boil, but, you are adding a lot less green matter which can lend a very clean hop character and bitterness."

beer,3cfmnl,19Styx6,2,Tue Jul 7 23:48:27 2015 UTC,"I think that Saint Arnold benefited from being the only craft brewery that was easily available in Houston for a long time. Everything I have tried from them was ok, but nothing I would seek out. Sure, if I'm at a bar in Houston I'll go for a Saint Arnold over a Budweiser. I'm guessing that is what made people think it was so good, because it was compared to the minimal selection available. It will be interesting to see if they are still held in high regard in the future with other Houston breweries growing and it now being easier to find other craft beer around."
beer,3cfmnl,zendawg,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:21:13 2015 UTC,"This is true.  They have great name recognition in Houston/Texas due to their longevity (1994 founding).

I must be an idiot to stand in line for 15 minutes for an overpriced, overhyped beer that was better last year, right?    People act like standing in line is the most reprehensible and intolerable thing possible, like there's no way a beer could possibly worth lining up for 30 minutes.  I've got nothing against standing.  I should probably stand more, to be honest.  It's definitely more healthy for me to browse reddit on my phone while standing in line than sitting on my ass in front of my desktop.  If the release is on a day when I have free time anyways, it isn't like I'm missing out on that much by standing around--Netflix will still be there when I get back.        You meet cool people in line.  Sure, there are inevitably a few bad apples out there, but all the folks I run into are pretty laid back.  You can chat about beer while you're waiting.  It is like /r/beer in the real world!    Going out of town to a release is like going on a little adventure.  A secret mission.  I check brewery and bottleshop social media pages to see when beers will be released.  It isn't that much work.  Sometimes I might have to go by a couple bottleshops in town to find that elusive limited release.  It is like a treasure hunt (or a wild Goose chase if you don't find what you're looking for).    In the end, good beer is still just beer.  That's fine with me, because I like beer.  Yeah, I know there are always comparable beers to the whalez that are much more widely available without the hassle, but I like the hassle.  It's fun."

If you don't buy into the culture you're going to hate it there.   That being said they are the most important brewery in Southern California.

After all, I only knew him from interviews and Youtube videos, right?  Met him in New York a few years ago, though, and yeah ... douchy asshole.  Just to cut questions off at the pass, there's no story here. He didn't do anything to me, there isn't anything to tell. He just came across as a self-absorbed douche to me, the sort of guy you meet at a party and immediately wish he'd wander to another room.  It's not that I was predisposed to dislike him, either.

Taste is taste, so I wouldn't knock anyone who doesn't like it -- it's totally cool if it's not someone's thing -- but sometimes I feel like a beer like Spotted Cow is a perfectly cooked cut of meat, and people are like, ""Where's the seasoning?"" instead of just appreciating how lean the beef is and how well it's cooked."

The perceived quality of a beer is more highly related to its scarcity than we admit. While there are some non-white, non-male brewers, the craft beer community is at the very least not free of the gender and racial problems that exist in the rest of American society, and let's not even start on sexual orientation. We're in the middle of a bubble, and when it bursts, a bunch of folks are going to be left holding the bag, both in terms of buying beers for trading/selling purposes, and in terms of breweries folding. Fewer people can discern the drop-off in hop t0nez than claim they can, and fussing about freshness is just that -- fussing.

But if it is a bubble, the pop could be kind of ugly. Large craft brewers may become the new macros and regarded as lacking quality or innovation (which I also think is untrue about macros). Regardless, they'll have economy of scale on their side and smaller/newer craft brewers may have a hard time competing. It is really expensive to start a brewery, and its growth/popularity make it very appealing to investors. Those smaller/newer brewers may be tempted or forced to sell to investors who may not know anything about beer quality and may pressure the brewers to make poor quality decisions in order to compete. Which may give craft a bad reputation and completely undo all of the market building that's happened so far...

I'm hoping the increasing popularity of 18th Street Brewing helps change the stereotype image a bit. As for women, I think the increasing popularity of craft beer among females will result in more female brewers over the next decade, but we'll see. I wasn't aware of the sexual orientation gap, that's unfortunate if true.     We're in the middle of a bubble...     I agree and disagree. I live in Seattle where there are over 40 breweries, but there are honestly only a small handful that are world class.

In my experience, they're almost always excellent beers, but are also almost never beers that warrant the absurd lengths people go to get them.  The race to get Heady, and now Sip of Sunshine, for instance. Both are great beers, but there are readily available alternatives that would win just as much praise in a blind tasting. (The sight of a rare label tends to skew perceptions.)  Offhand, the only IPA/DIPA ""whale"" I can think of that really did blow me away was Maine Dinner. I've had it on a few occasions now, and it's one of the few I'd actually wait on line for."

Even up to half a dozen years ago, it was  still head and shoulders above most IIPAs.  Vinnie has shared the recipe for years and now any home brewer and local pub has a riff on it.  It's no longer novel.  But that reputation of the best IIPA in nation lingers from a time when it was legitimately supreme.   The same can be said for Two Hearted.

For some beers, there isn't that big of a difference between drinking out of a bottle and a glass. Fat Tire is terrible. Anheuser Busch has arguably the most capable brewers in the world. IPAs, while good, don't taste like beer. Does that make sense? It's like a whole other type of drink."

beer,3cc8be,TheoreticalFunk,13,Mon Jul 6 21:40:01 2015 UTC,"If you taste them on separate occasions I mostly agree with you. You'd have to have a sensitive taste and taste memory (is that a thing?) to discern them. Drinking them side by side you do taste quite a difference. I personally prefer Westvleteren, but only when obtained at roughly the same price. I don't think it's worth a few extra Euros/dollars for a bottle. Buying it at the brewery however gives you a really good beer for a good price."
beer,3cc8be,krotz,4,Mon Jul 6 22:06:33 2015 UTC,"While the recipes are supposedly very similar, they do use a different yeast strain.  I detect a very discernable difference.  That difference in flavor is a fermentation characteristic.  Westvleteren's fermentation schedule and specific yeast (same as the Westmalle strain) produces a distinct grapiness."
beer,3cc8be,kevmo77,5,Tue Jul 7 02:18:37 2015 UTC,I went from one brewery to the other.  From St. Bernardus to Westvletren.  Got back on the bus and opened another St. Bernardus.  Same.
beer,3cc8be,TheoreticalFunk,11,Mon Jul 6 22:11:40 2015 UTC,"I understand that wheat beers are generally regarded as pretty inoffensive and good gateway/summer beers, but I don't care for their flavor at all (specifically the banana/bubblegum/clove components) and will take just about anything else if it's available. Gose is delightful, though."
beer,3cc8be,ISaidNoDecaf,6,Mon Jul 6 21:52:59 2015 UTC,"Where do you live? When I lived in DC, I couldn't for the life of me find any german-style, more bitter Weiss beers. Could only find the overly fruited, Belgian Witbier type, such as Hoegarden. I found that, at least for that region, pratically all American wheat beers were in that type: always fruited, very sweet.  It's just completely a very different flavor. I suggest Weihenstephaner if you can find it, IMO it's the best one, but in truth, Germany has a very strict standard for crafting beer, so most German Weiss are similar. They are much less sweet."
beer,3cc8be,JHMRS,6,Mon Jul 6 22:14:46 2015 UTC,"Based on what I often see on this and other forums this is an actual unpopular opinion in the beer community:  It's ok to not like a beer and turn it down if someone offers it to you or to not have a beer at a bar/restaurant if the only ones on the menu are ones you don't like.  I don't get the mindset that you are a stuck up asshole if you turn down a beer.  If you make a big deal of it and try to tell people they are wrong, then yeah - you're an asshole.  But if you politely decline and don't make a big deal of it what's the harm?  I don't have to have alcohol, and I don't need the added calories of a beer I'm not gonna enjoy.  To be clear, this is equally true for both craft beer drinkers turning down macro stuff (or craft beers they don't like) and macro lager drinkers who turn down anything craft/not their brand/out of their comfort zone."
beer,3cc8be,evarigan1,5,Tue Jul 7 00:19:55 2015 UTC,"I'd rather drink water than Bud Light so yeah, I do that.   I've also gone to a craft beer bar and refused to drink because their prices were absurd. $9 for 10 oz of local IPA, give me a break."
beer,3cc8be,mrpeterandthepuffers,3,Tue Jul 7 03:50:27 2015 UTC,"Fuck that mindset. If the people you're around are even remotely professional, they will never have a problem with you turning down beer. There is always a good reason not to drink, and anyone with a modicum of common sense understands that. There is absolutely nothing wrong with turning down a beer, for any reason or no reason at all."
beer,3cc8be,nvstarz,3,Tue Jul 7 05:42:02 2015 UTC,"This is a good point and I think your example of the other side of the coin helps to show that.  People think you're being snob if you turn down a Bud Light, but if someone turns down an IPA because they don't like them that's OK."
beer,3cc8be,itsme_timd,8,Tue Jul 7 14:11:58 2015 UTC,"I'm sick and tired of hoppy beers. Seriously sick and tired of everyone going cuckoo over the next IPA. Hops does not mean good beer. Any schmo can brew a beer and stick hops in it to give it that strong kick. I end up enjoying other beers where I can taste the malt and yeast, and enjoy something infinitely more complex than 100 FRIGGIN IBUS BRO. Give me a belgian dubbel or a hefeweizen over any IPA, any day of the week."
beer,3cc8be,Thelastterminator,8,Tue Jul 7 04:25:21 2015 UTC,"-Imperial/Double IPAs are not wildly differentiated. A mess of hops and alcohol is a mess of hops and alcohol. People should quit worshiping this style as a pinnacle of brewing.   -AB is the most efficient and well run brewing company in the world and should be a model for environmental, safety, and quality for the entire industry.  -Hype beers are fun to stumble upon and brag about, but no beer is going to change your life or get you off. Should you really stand in line for 5 hours to buy a beer?   -Craft Beer has given people an excuse to abuse alcohol without drawing criticism."

beer,3cc8be,19Styx6,17,Mon Jul 6 20:14:07 2015 UTC,"That's so interesting that it comes across musty to you. I've never gotten anything remotely musty in it. I get a delicious, fresh, fruityfloral pop. I'm not challenging your impression of it, just noting how two different people can taste such different things in the same beer.   This is one of the reasons it can be such a minefield to give or receive beer recommendations, not to mention how different people can perceive different levels of bitterness in the same beer. Or the cat pee thing, or the metal thing. It can just depend on the person. And even within the same person a beer you used to think was spectacular can just seem bleh now. Sometimes you'll try one you've been hearing a lot of hot buzz about, it's not that good, and you start wondering, ""Am I just a bad taster? Is my palate undeveloped? Is it just in a different place? Is there something wrong with this batch? What were those other people tasting here?"" It can be hard to know.   All you can really go on is your own experience. That's why it's difficult to universally pronounce something over or underrated. There isn't an objective rating to compare it to. All you've got is your subjective one, which may or may not resemble the average of thousands of other people's. That's why it's always interesting to see your rating's rDev on beeradvocate to see how much it differed from the pack average. When you're like 40% off, you're thinking ""What the hell happened there?"" But whatevs. Let it ride."

I feel they've been trying to change things up with their new revamps with stone pale and ruination.   People here HATE rogue. Now, i heard that they treat their employees like dandy shite and terrible whatnot, which is terrible, but honestly, i really like some of their beer. i really do. sorry.

beer,3ch7c2,SnakeSmith,4,Tue Jul 7 22:16:56 2015 UTC,"Here's what I usually do! Start with a cup with or without ice. Pour in some tomato juice. Sprinkle in some salt (about 5 shakes?) add fresh lime juice (half a large lime or both halves of a smaller lime) add in a few drops of Worcestershire sauce. If you want it a little spicy, drop in a few drops of Tapatio or sprinkle in some Tajin. Add beer and mix! I'd skip pepper and celery, that's more Bloody Mary and less michelada. This is the way my family usually makes them! Makes the bud much more drinkable!"
beer,3ch7c2,LTshrink,3,Wed Jul 8 01:24:27 2015 UTC,"To elaborate on what the others have said, ""chelada"" is the product name that Bud uses for their canned micheladas. Micheladas are a Mexican drink made with beer, tomato juice, and other things. If you are using Bud and Campbell's tomato, use salt, pepper, Tabasco, and Worstershire at the very least. Peronally, I agree with /u/acenarteco that Clamato is the way to go. However, I also just love Clamato all the time and in all cases in which you would use regular tomato juice (especially in bloody maries, though that technically makes it a bloody caesar)."

For example, their source of number of breweries still lists NC as having 101 breweries. We're up to 132140 breweries and that's mostly because the administration is backlogged (I visited a brewery yesterday who is all set to start brewing but can't because they're awaiting approval.)"

beer,3cbmk1,toepaydoe,5,Mon Jul 6 20:59:50 2015 UTC,"There's groups of delusional white people with ""native"" bumper stickers that are angry people are moving to Colorado.  The massive influx of people during marijuana legalization that causes the citizens and the rent in this beautiful state to be too damn high.  Honestly, it's fucking amazing living here.  300 days of sun, amazing craft breweries everywhere, breath taking landscapes, and the fittest state in the country.  Moving here was one of, if not the best, decision I've made in the past 10 years.  I will never understand why people get so angry that out of staters want to move to this paradise."
beer,3cbmk1,KarlWeathers,4,Mon Jul 6 22:04:30 2015 UTC,"It's prolly similar to how we Montana's don't want more people moving here. You don't want more people out in a place where you are trying not to see people. It's not that we don't want to share it's that we don't want nature to become commercialized where you go on a hike and see a hundred people. Where lift tickets cost $100 but the lines are so long that you only get 8 runs in,  where the powder after a storm is gone by 11am,  where you can't find a fishing spot because there are 3 people already in it,  where boat launches have a 45 minute wait time.  Where specialized hunting tags are nearly impossible to get, where that land you have been saving years for suddenly becomes too expensive you have to rent a house.  I'm sure Colorado is a beautiful state and that's why people move there but there are reasons natives don't like it.  It's not that non natives are mean or something.  It's just they add more people to the mix on something that would prolly do better with out more people. I know for a fact that Colorado is going to run into a lot of the water issues California is having if the population their continues on its path. The same thing. With most western states. Montana Idaho and Wyoming are not immune to this population growth. And it's scary for us as well. That's why I use the slogan Montana sucks, I hear Colorado is nice."

That's what you get for being an idiot.   But here in Montana it used to be a point of pride to have less than a million people in the state.  Then back in like 2012 it was a sad day for I think most people when we hit the million mark. And we may get  another  rep by the time. Of the next census it's still sad because like i said earlier, a lot of Montana mystique is the lack of people,  the ability to go out and not see another human. To have clean air and clean water within reach. To know who your neighbor is.  To not worry about locking your door. But times are changing and as California continues to not have enough water, more and more people will end up leaving those communities and they will choose to move to locations that have those fancy new tech jobs and bozeman and butte are trying to get those. And it's bitter sweet because Montana is ridiculously cheap to buy land compared to a lot of other areas in the country so we will get more companies moving here and that means more people which means longer lines and more people and all the negative effects of those more people.  The economy will grow which is prolly good.  But there isn't any real benefit to an influx of people. Because for the most part people are awful,  individuals are good.  But people as a group suck."

IPAs are always best when you're drinking them as fresh as possible. A good many standard IPAs are allowed to sit on shelves too long and over just a few months they turn into bitter and possibly oxidized messes. A well made fresh IPA is such a treat.   Ambers are a wide ranging style. Every brewery will have very different takes on an amber. I love Modern Times Blazing World. It's Amber in color. They call it an amber, but it's very hoppy. I wouldn't say it drinks like a full-on IPA though. The malts used bring a roundness that a lot IPAs gloss over. Give it a try and if it's to your taste it might just be a gateway to IPAs.   Overall be brave with what you taste and be open minded. There's a lot of challenging flavors in the beer world. Something you don't like now could be your new paradigm a year or two down the road. Sours beckon, barrel aged stouts await, saisons want to crackle your tongue, hops want to seduce you, and even the tried and true lager might surprise you."

beer,3cdmgu,secondarycontrol,4,Tue Jul 7 03:15:01 2015 UTC,This is the correct answer. High Life is Millers oldest running brand and is not an economy beer like Natty is today. That would be The Beast (Milwaukee's Best). MGD is basically an attempt to have the taste of High Life draft (cold filtered and unpasteurized ) in a can and initially carried the High Life name before being dropped into just MGD  It should also be noted that Natty Light was ABs first light beer and was a premium product sold at the same price as Bud. Only after Michelob Light and Bud Light come on scene did Natty Light slip into the discount brand status.
beer,3cdmgu,MadScientist420,-4,Tue Jul 7 03:26:49 2015 UTC,It's not the correct answer; read the Wiki I posted a link to.
beer,3cdmgu,mugsoh,2,Tue Jul 7 05:14:22 2015 UTC,"MGD or High Life, take your pick.  High Life was Miller's flagship beer for most of the last century, occupying the same product category as Bud Fat and Coors Fat. Genuine Draft was introduced a variant of High Life that was supposed to reproduce the different taste drinkers got from High Life when they had it on tap vs. in cans or bottles, where it had been pasteurized. So either one of those is your beer even if, as mugsoh notes, the recipes aren't or at least weren't originally related. The point is that MGD/High Life were originally the equivalent product category of Bud/Coors.  Just as a side note here - the interesting thing about beers like that is they can be repositioned at different levels as needed. You see High Life as their Keystone/Natty, for example, but it used to be seen as their flagship. It just got overtaken by Miller Lite and went into decline. So they repriced and repositioned it as a lower level beer. Same beer, just presented differently to the public, and that's why you have that impression of it now. Isn't that interesting? They tried to lift it back up in 2010 but I'm not sure anybody noticed. It still has a ""dead brand"" feel to me, like a homeless orphan. But the point is that these things are just commodities. Doesn't really matter what's inside. It's just about the advertising and what you're told to believe about what the beer says about you."
beer,3cdmgu,turkeypants,-6,Tue Jul 7 03:54:53 2015 UTC,It's not the correct answer; read the Wiki I posted a link to. The Lite recipe wasn't even developed by Miller brewing and preceded MGD by 15 years. There was never supposed to be an association between High Life and Lite Beer from Miller. They didn't even refer to it as Miller Lite until the 90s.
beer,3cdmgu,mugsoh,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:18:25 2015 UTC,"We're not quite connecting here. I specifically acknowledged and echoed what you said about Lite's different lineage and unrelated recipe. What I'm talking about is the slot High Life and MGD occupy for the company. OP asked if they had a ""regular beer"". He was aware of their light beer but wondered if they had one that wasn't light. They do. Two of them. MGD and HL. These are the beers that line up against Bud and Coors Fat in the non-light flagship category. They are the equivalent products. He's not asking about some kind of relationship between the fats and the lights by the same brewer, or about historical/retired beers, just whether or not Miller had a non-light that he could pick up in Houston."
beer,3cdmgu,turkeypants,-5,Tue Jul 7 06:33:46 2015 UTC,"I see what you are trying to say, but the way I read the OP's question, he is wondering if there is a heavy version of Lite in the way that the light versions of Coors and Bud are based on their original heavy versions. Neither High Life nor MGD would fit that bill. If he wants the heavy version of Lite, he would have to get a Meisterbrau."
beer,3cdmgu,mugsoh,0,Tue Jul 7 07:12:16 2015 UTC,"Well then loan him your time machine and he can pick up some Meister Brau. Otherwise, he's on the way to the store in Houston and wants to know if there's a regular beer there by Miller, not a light one, that he can pick up. Miller reformulated Lite when they bought it anyway so the original recipe and its relation to Meister Brau has long since been irrelevant."
beer,3cdmgu,turkeypants,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:09:21 2015 UTC,"It's not intended to be a light version of Miller. The recipe wasn't even developed by Miller but by a competitor they acquired.

The corresponding original beer would have been  Meister Brau which is no longer brewed."

It's spelling of 'LITE' allowed them to make ads in which the consumer would say ""Give me a Lite"".  When Miller Lite first hit the scene it was most commonly known simply as ""Lite"".  Then everyone and their brother started putting out light alternatives to their main line brew and ""Lite"" became known as ""Miller Lite"".  High Life is the original Miller beer.  When someone said they wanted a Miller, or it's Miller Time, they were referring to High Life.  MGD is supposed to give you the flavor profile of a High Life on Draft.  The light variants on High Life and MGD are their own light beers, separate from Miller Lite."

beer,3cdxz5,nvstarz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:49:46 2015 UTC,"Wine coolers are not good for beer unless you can stand the bottles upright (or your collection is all corked & caged). Bottle capped beer should not be aged on its side like wine, but vertically. I've heard arguments (can't find any science behind it though) that exposing a bottle cap to liquid over a long period of time will cause it to degrade and allow air in/out of the bottle, ruining the beer. Personally, I don't enjoy yeast rings in unfiltered or bottle-conditioned beers. Vertical storage prevents this as the yeast has to sink to the bottom (yay gravity!).  Also, cellar temp should be 55 degrees F. Serving temp is lower than cellar temp. 55 degrees is also the proper cellar temp for fine wine, so if she has a collection, you can utilize the same space."

If youre set on making it work 52F sounds pretty swell if you have to pick only one temp. Although one valve, a temp sensor, and some basic logic functions could make a beer/wine cooler optimal for both. This assumes youre pretty handy though."

beer,3cbp1t,YodaLoL,12,Mon Jul 6 17:43:13 2015 UTC,"It is done using this technique. Depending on the style of tap, you either push or turn in the opposite direction. This pulls the lager through in a much 'tighter' way, forcing through more gas rather than liquid and leaving a really dense head: like this  It is really common in bars in Spain, and it can be done on most lager taps I have worked with in the UK.  Edit, probably a better example here"
beer,3cbp1t,evertondave,8,Mon Jul 6 20:27:45 2015 UTC,"Work is boring so this came out super long, sorry. Here's a detailed and realistic explanation: When in the keg, the beer has a certain amount of CO2 dissolved in it, depending on how it is made and the style. Foam happens when the CO2 comes out of solution and is wrapped up by proteins and sugars in the beer, making tiny bubbles. This happens just from changes in pressure and temperature, as well as simply disturbing the beer (shaking, etc). The sensation of creaminess in a head is based on the density of those sugars and proteins. Beer with more proteins and sugars in it by recipe will tend to have a creamier tasting head at any size.  When you pour a beer normally, opening the tap up all the way provides the least resistance, so it's generally just the change from keg/line pressure and temperature to normal room temperature, plus the falling of the beer from the tap to the glass, that knocks the CO2 out of solution and into bubbles. If you held the glass way down below the tap, the beer would fall further and that shaking would knock even more out. If you hold it really close to the tap and tip the glass, it hardly falls at all so the head is smaller.  The pressure change mentioned above can be forced to happen more violently at the nozzle of the tap if you restrict the opening. When the opening is small, almost all of the CO2 is knocked out immediately and you'll get pure foam coming out. When you do that, you just end up with a thicker layer of foam than you'd normally have. It doesn't exactly force out more gas, since the gas mix is already determined in the keg.  If you wait a little while after pouring a beer with a thick foam head, some of the bubbles pop and the head gets smaller - but with a sufficiently proteiny/sugary beer, the foam only condenses and tastes even thicker. That's a common style of pouring in European (other than English) beers - pour a larger head and wait for the foam to go down a bit so you are left with an even more concentrated and creamy head.  So, for this particular beer, it's like this:   Start with a beer that's reasonably sweet and proteiny like most lagers and has a mid to high level of carbonation Pour most of a beer normally so that the liquid in your glass still tastes carbonated Open the tap halfway and use that to cover your beer in foam Let that foam condense a little bit.   What you are left with is a very thick and creamy head. Some bars would instead just pour the beer such that it drops a good distance before hitting the glass, which also generates a big head that condenses down to be very creamy -- the only difference being that the leftover liquid beer won't have nearly as much carbonation in it, resulting in a sweeter taste (since CO2 tastes bitter/sour).    Nitro beers: The taps used for ""nitro"" beers have a restrictor plate in them that causes this same effect as opening a normal tap a tiny bit an even more extreme level. If you took a regularly carbonated beer and hooked it up to a nitro-style tap, you'd literally only dispense foam. Beers designed for nitrogen taps are almost completely flat, which is to say they have a very small amount of CO2 dissolved in them, but it's just enough that when shoved through the restrictor plate it almost completely comes out to force that head. The cascading effect you see is from all of the CO2 forcing its way out after being smacked around by that restrictor plate.  So, if you want a ""nitro"" style beer, you make it with a lot less dissolved CO2 and push it through a restrictor plate. They also hook it up to special ""beer gas"" instead of a normal CO2 tank - if you hooked it up to a normal CO2 tank, it would slowly carbonate as it is hooked up. Instead the ""beer gas"" tank only has a small amount of CO2 (to maintain the small amount in the beer) and a lot of nitrogen, which doesn't dissolve in the beer nearly as well, and instead just shoves the beer out of the keg."

beer,3cbp1t,poetryslam,2,Mon Jul 6 20:52:16 2015 UTC,There is no specific name for it that I have ever heard. It is a pretty easy trick that you can do on any lager tap though. Some are specifically designed and have just a foam release button on the top (fosters is an example). On more basic taps you can replicate the result by barely pulling it forward and only a thick foam will be produced.
beer,3cbp1t,evertondave,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:02:32 2015 UTC,"Why is this done?  It seems like it's essentially selling the foam at the expense of the liquid, but is there something I'm missing?"
beer,3cbp1t,evertondave,3,Mon Jul 6 21:03:07 2015 UTC,"It is never at the expense of the liquid. The glasses are always oversized by a couple of inches to allow for the head. I suppose it is for better mouthfeel. Lager can go flat really quickly, especially in the sun, plus, it looks good. Belgians do a very similar thing by closing the tap slowly so the glass overflows with foam then scrape the top off with a blade. They tend to say they do it because the extra bubbles create more aroma. Personally, I think it is mainly for show."
beer,3cbp1t,poetryslam,3,Mon Jul 6 21:09:15 2015 UTC,"The spanish guy in the video i posted says it is to protect the beer and keep it fizzy, if his opinion is worth anything."
beer,3cbp1t,evertondave,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:15:21 2015 UTC,"That actually all makes some sense.  I have some delirium tremens glasses (bought for the pink elephants) with a fill line that's about 2/3 up and I can imagine pouring nice and easy to the line before adding a nice, thick head up to the rim."
beer,3cbp1t,poetryslam,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:22:21 2015 UTC,"There is actually a technique you can use to do that perfectly with a bottle. Pour it half an inch short of the fill line, and with the mouthful that is left in the bottle hold it between your hands and rub them back and forth so the bottle is twisting rapidly. The dregs will then foam up. Pour it on top and it will look like it was served from draught."
beer,3cbp1t,tsondie21,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:29:28 2015 UTC,"I think this technique is (or was) spelled out on Hoegaarden bottles.

beer,3cbp1t,Niode,6,Mon Jul 6 21:45:33 2015 UTC,It was likely a beer served on nitrogen. The most common beer served on nitro Guinness. It's a replacement for the CO2 which they typically serve beer on.
beer,3cbp1t,tsondie21,3,Mon Jul 6 17:46:23 2015 UTC,"Incorrect. Most European keg tap handles can be pushed two ways (you can also do this with the ones that turn 90 degrees). Towards you for full open dispense, and away from you for a restricted flow. This allows the beer to be forced through the same air pressure causing it to fob and gives you a creamier head. On under-carbonated pours putting the flat beer under the tap and pushing forward is one way of fobbing a head onto the beer. It just looks nicer that way."
beer,3cbp1t,Niode,-6,Mon Jul 6 21:14:47 2015 UTC,Uhh.. This is true too but it doesn't make my theory incorrect. Nitro beer is a real thing that makes the beer head exactly as the op described.
beer,3cbp1t,tsondie21,4,Mon Jul 6 22:14:45 2015 UTC,"San Miguel doesn't use nitro dispense. So yes, it does make your theory incorrect. Also Nitro isn't a replacement for CO2 as most beers served on nitro use a 70%N2/30%CO2 split (Guinness is recommended 75% N2/25% CO2)."

However, I would also highly recommend Harmony Brewing. It's a cute little operation with surprisingly good beers and interesting pizzas. Also, get the breadsticks or cheesesticks, you'll thank me later. Also, if you find yourself north of the city proper, Perrin is worth checking out, I was pleasantly surprised by them."

Either way, enjoy! I just moved to the east coast from Michigan  and while there's  solid beer scene here too,  Michigan is something special.  Oh and you've probably heard enough suggestions but the original Hopcat is in Grand Rapids.  I haven't been to that one personally but the others have like 100+ beers on tap and excellent food."

beer,3c8pse,JoelFromSales,3,Mon Jul 6 04:38:36 2015 UTC,"While not all bars/taprooms/breweries update their tap list regularly, here in Tampa and beyond, there have been some old school players that use these very basic backends that either automatically read if a tap is dead or new taps can be added to the program. This information regularly feeds into their website or a backend that aggregates the information (without outputting it anywhere).   I had a similar idea to OP a while back while drinking beer with a friend at The Brass Tap in Tampa. Their system is set up electronically like I explained above. The only issue I ran into was the guy who was installing them. According to my research, he was a novice programmer that'd worked in a semi-related field for years. Then you have the Cigar City taproom that uses an application designed by a local marketing company that can be changed dynamically.  What I'm getting at is that you'd have to establish connections with these people and sync up the beer lists. Sounded like a headache, so I abandoned the idea almost immediately after some brief research."

Also, the list is hard to read as quickly as it moves, so I often have to ask the bartenders about beers.

I just thought you should know. I do like the idea of having this seamless backend that integrates with their website. I also like the idea of working with a designer to improve that frontend.

beer,3cc2dh,iamnotdave,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:14:34 2015 UTC,"I'm from Minnesota and buy a lot if Wisconsin beers. My favorites from across the border are New Glarus, O's, and Tyreana. New Glarus gets all the pub but there is some great beer in Wisconsin besides spotted cow. I highly recommend New Glarus-Moon Man, Black Top, Naked, Cabin Fever, and all of their fruit beers especially serendipity. O's flat out makes great beer. Try them all especially the Red and the Stout. Tyreana I can actually buy in Minnesota but it's a Wisconsin brew. Rocky's revenge is my favorite from them. My least favorite Wisconsin breweries are probably Capitol and Central Waters I do not really recommend them.   If you travel through Minnesota visit a few breweries I can't recommend the new Surly brewery enough the place is incredible. Dangerous Man, Indeed, and Town Hall are terrific too. For beer you can buy in the Store my favorite local breweries are Surly, Brau Bros, Indeed, Lift Bridge-Hop Dish and Schell's. Schell's doesn't get enough love they are the 2nd oldest family owned brewery in the nation and brew awesome German style beers. My least favorite MN breweries are probably Lake Superior(I think they have quality control issues) and Futon is kinda Bleh to me.   There is a ton more in both states but my post can only be so long. Have fun!"

It's Definetly worth the trip out to New Glarus but be forewarned that Great Taste falls on the same weekend so the crowd will be a bit larger than usual.  Besides Wisconsin beers id recommend picking up some Surly, Three Floyds, and Toppling Goliath if you've never had it. I hope this helps, and enjoy your trip to Wisconsin!"

beer,3cbyd2,Cideleetivy2,29,Mon Jul 6 18:48:39 2015 UTC,"He's probably giving it to you right after bottling if it's got no carbonation.  Bottle conditioned beers require 1-2 weeks at room temperature for the yeast to create the fizz.  Then they require chilling for several days to drop the yeast out.  Be careful upon pouring as the bottle warms the yeast can get back into suspension, it's best to pour it all quickly while it's cold or leave the last bit in the bottle.   Next time he gives you some beer inquire as to how far along into the bottle conditioning phase it is and at what volume of CO2 you can expect.  Most ales are styled at the lower end of the carbonation spectrum so don't expect a high Bud Light fizz from home brew."
beer,3cbyd2,ChiefBurrito,4,Mon Jul 6 19:12:50 2015 UTC,"This is all correct. Also, because many homebrewers don't focus on clarity, and therefore don't filter or use finings to drop particles out of suspension, you may see some haze in the beer from protiens, hop particles, yeast, etc. This is all fine as far as safety and flavor goes, but it means the beer won't be very clear. I've brewed a few swampy IPAs, and they were among my friends favorites.   Also, if you do what ChiefBurrito up there said, and give the beer some time in the fridge for the yeast to settle out, it still won't hurt you if you get some yeast in the glass. Yeast is actually pretty good for you, but it may affect the flavor a bit."
beer,3cbyd2,SuicydKing,3,Tue Jul 7 03:19:34 2015 UTC,"not sure if this was said, if there's a bunch of stuff that settles you don't have to pour the whole bottle out, leave the sediment behind  i'd like to add that when i started brewing i didn't focus on clarity, it was an extra step or steps that didn't seem to effect taste. over time i realized people drink (and eat) with their eyes. Clarity and color is, if not just as, important as taste."
beer,3cbyd2,jturkish,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:24:13 2015 UTC,"Yup. As a rule of thumb, for homebrew don't pour the last quarter or half inch of the bottle into your glass."
beer,3cbyd2,BusyBurningBridges,2,Tue Jul 7 15:45:42 2015 UTC,Very interesting! Thank you! I'll try that next time!
beer,3cbyd2,13h4gat,9,Tue Jul 7 03:15:30 2015 UTC,He's probably bottling it poorly. The yeast should settle down during fermentation and when you siphon it into bottles you're supposed to leave the yeast in the fermentation chamber. He might also not be carbonating the beer in the bottles which is why its coming out flat. That or his capper isn't capping the bottles properly.
beer,3cbyd2,ChiefBurrito,9,Mon Jul 6 18:59:42 2015 UTC,"Actually there is yeast in bottle conditioned beers, this is what creates the carbonation, see my other post below."
beer,3cbyd2,13h4gat,4,Mon Jul 6 19:15:00 2015 UTC,I know there is yeast but I'm saying a good amount of it should settle out during fermentation and make the yeast cake. Whatever little amount is still free floating will be bottled and that should be enough to carbonate it.
beer,3cbyd2,doctorfunkerton,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:38:08 2015 UTC,Yeah leaving it in the fridge for a few days helps to settle it too.
beer,3cbyd2,firebush123,3,Tue Jul 7 00:54:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I cheaped out and bought some caps online one time without any research, turned out they didn't have the little rubber ring washer thing inside them.  I got a nice tasting but flat oatmeal stout.    Although, I would think we would know to correct that after the first attempt?  Maybe he just thinks that's how homebrew is supposed to work?"
beer,3cbyd2,pithed,3,Mon Jul 6 19:10:31 2015 UTC,You still can get some yeast settling out in the bottles even when properly siphoned so generally i tell people I give my homebrew to to refrigerate the beer over night to settle things and decant into a glass without pouring out the last 1/2 ounce or so.
beer,3cbyd2,na_cho_cheez,3,Mon Jul 6 19:11:52 2015 UTC,"Ask him what style it is, and ask when its supposed to be ready. Flat beer has happened to me before but i was honest about it when giving it out. As a homebrewer I never serve anything to my buddies without giving them a rundown of the beer style and any information about it. I generally don't give out anything I think is shitty, except to my brother who always genuinely likes to find out about beer flaws and experience whan nasty beer can be. But your buddy may just not give a shit and just be giving away shitty beer and he has no idea how shitty it is."
beer,3cbyd2,Elk_Man,3,Mon Jul 6 21:13:34 2015 UTC,"Foggy and yeasty can be common of homebrew, especially bottled. A quick snoop tells me you aren't a regular poster here, so I hate to be presumptuous, but do you drink non Bud/Miller/Coors beer often? There are lots of styles that aren't supposed to be as carbonated as light lagers.   Also, with homebrew that is carbonated in the bottle like his probably is it is very important to pour it into a cup and leave behind an ounce or so of beer witht he majority of the yeast.  It could be also that your neighbor isn't a great brewer. If that's the case hopefully he will improve.   Also, please rinse out the bottles when you're done and give them back. It is generally appreciated."

beer,3cd6ff,saind,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:33:12 2015 UTC,"Mostly brewer's choice, so far as I know.   In my experience, blonde ales tend to be less alcoholic (lower ABV), while golden ales and strong ales are bigger beers. Golden ales are usually lighter in color than strong ales (and tripels are often paler than golden ales), but there's a ton of overlap.   Luckily, most Belgian beers are delicious, so I guess you'll just have to test them all and take notes to help define the differences for yourself.   It's a hard job, but someone's got to do it."

I don't care for Boston Lager or Summer Ale but Sam Adams has plenty of good beers apart from those. Smuttynose is solid too.

beer,3cch9p,myblandusername,3,Mon Jul 6 20:57:29 2015 UTC,"The problem with these lists is that they're always substantially wrong.   For example, from your first link:   The first professional brewers were all women called brewsters. The women had to be very beautiful to be able to become brewsters.    Not really.   There are too many types of beer in the world to know the exact amount that currently exist. However, we do know that Belgium is the country that has the most individual beer brands.   We know no such thing. For a number of reasons. First, because this factoid never says what it actually means by ""brands."" Is Bud Light a different brand than Budweiser? And second, because regardless of the interpretation it just isn't true; there are very clearly both more breweries and more ""brands"" (whatever the meaning) of beer in the UK, Germany, and particularly the United States than there are in Belgium. While Belgium may have the most breweries/brands per capita, the United States currently has well over 3,000 breweries in operation.   The world´s strongest beer is Brewmeister´s “Snake Venom“. While regular beer usually has about 5% ABV, this Scottish killer has a stomach-burning 67.5% ABV.   In their initial runs of both Snake Venom and Armageddon, Brewmeister simply lied about the alcohol content. Neither beer was anywhere close to its reported strength, as confirmed both by proof tests and laboratory tests. Having tried both, I wouldn't believe either was over 30% ABV. They are apparently now making a . . . product called ""Snake Venom"" which is at the stated strength, but it should in no way be regarded as a beer as it is very clear that they are adulterating it with pure ethanol.  From your second link:   In the middle ages clean water was often difficult to find. [...]   It wasn't. This is a myth, plain and simple. People drank beer not because potable water was in short supply, but because (i) it was a good way to store grain which would otherwise spoil or be eaten by pests, (ii) it was a good source of energy during a period when a large portion of the public performed manual labor every day, and (iii) because they liked it.   Store it upright   I've done this one too many times to do it again. But just no. You can store beer upright. You can store beer sideways. In almost all cases, it does not matter which.    Pilgrims   Another myth.  I'll stop here, but you get the idea."

I was able to buy fresher bottles of Punk for literally half the price in a Weatherspoons less than 100 meters away from the bar I worked in and when we where asked why this was the case by punters we had to say that our beer was fresher and you were helping to support an independent business, neither true. Those 'shares' they are selling, worthless, they have set their own value on the them and because they are not a publicly traded company, after they vest you have to use Brewdogs own forum to sell them and the only other people on this forum are people who already have over priced, worthless shares, so you can't even get rid of them. They are currently trying to open a hotel where you get a tap in your room and unlimited beer whilst using the hashtag #beerforbreakfast which I'm pretty sure has to be against some of responsible drinking laws too. I like some of their beer, I love Jackhammer and Hardcore but almost all of it is just a gimmick and when you stand the up against most half decent American breweries you can see just how far they have to go. Also anyone notice a huge price jump in Mikkeller recently, that's because BrewDog bought up all the distribution rights in the UK and jumped the wholesale prices 30% overnight meaning most independent bottle shops instantly got priced out of the market.

beer,3c6a61,tommyonepin,5,Sun Jul 5 22:18:15 2015 UTC,"Hey - current BrewDog staff member here. Wanted to give an opinion from a current employee's point of view as, while I appreciate that everyone has their own experiences and is entitled to their opinions, the experience represented previously in this thread is not the norm in my experience. Far from it.  Just as a bit of context, BrewDog is one of the fastest growing companies in the UK. Since 2007, we have launched 29 bars worldwide, now export to 55 countries and made £3.9m profit in 2014, all of which was reinvested back into the business. “That’s some nice regurgitated spiel you’ve got there” I hear you cry. Sure. But it is worth bearing in mind that the company now has a dedicated HR department, which did not even exist two years ago. BrewDog’s people are its greatest asset and we’re now putting huge resources and investment behind ensuring their happiness. Ex-employees may not have had the luxury of that support, but it’s firmly in place now, and it’s critical to the company’s development. Don’t judge BrewDog on what it was a few years ago. Nine years ago, we did not even exist. We’re young, and we’re growing fast. We’re bound to have made mistakes.  I have worked at BrewDog since 2013 and I love it. It’s fucking hard work, I work crazy hours and junior team members are given a lot of responsibility early on. But I do those long hours because I want to do them. I work fucking hard because the nature of the business means I get see the results of my labour. And being “in at the deep end” is not something you will get with many companies of BrewDog’s size. If you want to learn, the best way is by doing.   Being a small, fast-expanding company naturally comes with growing pains, and the co-founders themselves are acutely aware of the issues that can arise and the work we have to put in to avoid them. But we hire people who can be flexible and hardy enough to deal with those, understanding they are part and parcel of learning as we grow. More importantly, we hire people who want to be a part of something ambitious.   The beer will of course be cheaper to buy from Sainsbury’s or Wetherspoons or anywhere else with a bigger footprint…that’s called economy of scale. Launching 29 craft beer bars and growing a team from the ground up will inevitably lead to overheads, but the service in BrewDog bars is, in my opinion, excellent and you get what you pay for.  As for the shares, I won’t comment too much on this but if you are a shareholder, you will know about the trading day that took place in 2014, and the value at which shares were sold. If anyone has a specific question about Equity for Punks, we have a dedicated helpdesk to respond to questions and enquiries. We’re not shy about what we’re putting out there in this respect, but there are restrictions placed on discussion of this thanks to the FCA.  BrewDog is now a Living Wage employer, so  the suggestion that the company doesn’t pay staff well is redundant.  Not keen on the beer hotel idea? You sound hella fun. But if you don’t like it, don’t stay there.   Regarding Mikkeller, we provided a comment on that back in 2013 (again, a long time in BrewDog years) and this is available on some blogs online."

Maybe media, or marketing, just a hunch, but I'd be interested to know.  I'm glad you have an HR department now, when I was there, there was no one and as a result:  You still owe me 3 weeks pay, when I called the office to get it I was told if I wanted it I would have to pursue you through the courts to get it, and despite having a letter signed by my manager offering me this money, you were going to renege on it.  When I filed a complaint about receiving emails calling me a 'cunt' in them I never got a response. Happy to screen dump em here if you want?  When I reported being made to falsify numbers in the nightly take so the manager could use it as a personal loan service and when I reported being directly lied too as part of a pay review I was told I could quit on the spot or be fired tomorrow.   So glad you're staff are now covered by an HR department, I still think you're a pretty shitty company and I would advise against working for or supporting such a brand."

Incidentally I love the rogue amber ale they have for £1.50 in select spoons (its £3 in others). What a bargain, we were the only ones drinking it and it felt like being students again whilst the staff muttered how it was too cheap as they had to keep going downstairs to get us more bottles.

They didn't have much competition in the UK while introducing the concept of ""Craft Beer"" to the UK consumer.  If they were to start up now they would just add to the list of breweries in the UK with mediocre beer and hip branding (there are several that are fantastic but the quality is quickly becoming diluted with more and more half-baked startups).  In fact, I don't think they would ever be able to achieve the same level of growth if they had started up even a few years later.  American consumers who drink non-macro beer are much more likely to buy from breweries based on substance over style.  They won't buy into the hype.  This is just my opinion as an American living in the UK based on my experience running a craft beer pub and now working at a prominent brewery in the southwest."
beer,3c6a61,illBringtheNachos,3,Sun Jul 5 11:23:03 2015 UTC,Thornbridge was definitely before.
beer,3c6a61,Winston-Green,3,Sun Jul 5 16:06:18 2015 UTC,"Considering Martin Dickie used to work for Thornbridge I'd say that Thornbridge were well before Brewdog haha. They had tonnes of competition in the real ale market that's why they had their 'feud' with CAMRA and blathered on about 'craft' until the cows came home to differentiate their product from the literal hundreds of world class breweries in this country. Just because you call it 'craft' doesn't mean that it's brewed in any way different to traditional ale. There are craft breweries that sell beer exclusively in casks just as there are bottle exclusive or keg exclusive breweries. It's all nonsense marketing jargon. Saying you are 'craft' doesn't automatically mean you are better than traditional breweries. That's nonsense, however it does seem that Brewdog think that. To say they were responsible for bringing the 'craft beer' movement to the UK is laughable at best. There's literally thousands of breweries in this country that you can consider craft and a very large number of them were operating for a long time before Brewdog was even a glint in Martin and James' eye. They just had the biggest mouths on them and decided to get the backs up of a large number of prominent people in the industry which fostered their infamy."

beer,3c6a61,MrKrinkle151,9,Sun Jul 5 20:53:20 2015 UTC,"I really couldn't disagree more. Brewdog has some extremely solid offerings, and it's pricier because it's an import craft beer in the US. When they open their new brewery in Ohio, the price of their offerings will come down."
beer,3c6a61,slash196,10,Sun Jul 5 11:05:35 2015 UTC,"I couldn't disagree more. BrewDog is overhyped, their marketing is loud-mouthed, but it's not backed up by much, plus their ""no cask"" policy is 2edgy4me. Their beer is always quite diappointing, both from keg and bottle, and given the fact that they contract the vast majority of all Nelson Sauvin hops, they can't make good use of it. And I live in Germany, so the beer is always reasonably fresh."
beer,3c6a61,_ak,9,Sun Jul 5 13:20:29 2015 UTC,"You live in Germany? Where are you finding Brewdog on tap? I can barely find something worth drinking in stores. For a country that's practically synonymous with beer, the market is mostly a frozen hellscape of a thousand identical lagers."
beer,3c6a61,slash196,2,Sun Jul 5 13:26:46 2015 UTC,"Berlin is the (self-proclaimed) craft beer capital of Germany, that's where I live. Quite a few bars do craft beer now, and the dedicated craft beer bars do imports, so BrewDog is something you can find regularly. Stone is currently in the process of building their European brewery there, while BrewDog is working on launching of their bars, but the latter seem to be hampered a bit by local bureaucracy. Plus there's quite a few local craft breweries, some better, some not so great, but at least there's plenty of variety now. It was a lot worse like 5, 6 years ago, but within the last 2 to 2.5 years things have improved a lot.  I absolutely agree that German beer is boring. More of the same everywhere, virtually no innovation, and of those large breweries actually trying out new things, their attempts are botched, like Beck's ""craft"" series of pale ale, amber lager and imperial pils. Just because Germany is synonymous with beer, it doesn't mean it's good beer, unfortunately. But then, it shows in sales numbers. Germany's per capita beer consumption has been dropping massively over the last few years."
beer,3c6a61,_ak,3,Sun Jul 5 16:48:53 2015 UTC,"Aha, of course. Yeah Berlin is very ahead of the curve. It's funny, because I've been keeping a close eye on the craft scene and there are a LOT of craft breweries here in Bavaria. But their distribution is so miserable you can't find them. There are a couple of very good ones in Munich, which is just 90 minutes away, but if you went to every beer shop in Passau you'd never know it. But good lord, you'll find 45 varieties of Helles from breweries so tiny you'd never find the town on the map.  Frankly I'm happy to see that Beck's is trying to move into the segment here, because maybe all these other brewers will get their heads out of their asses and realize there's a better way to make money in beer than to try to churn out the cheapest lager possible."

beer,3c6a61,turkeypants,3,Sun Jul 5 17:28:38 2015 UTC,"The no cask policy makes sense in the context of the UK in a way that it wouldn't in Germany or the States or anywhere else really. Cask is pretty much the standard here for smaller brewers and beers, aside from mass market lagers. Before BrewDog came along nobody really did anything but cask. I don't dislike cask, but some styles are better suited to being cooler and more heavily carbonated. It gets a bit annoying when the only offerings in pubs are cask and rarely a style that suits cask, so it's nice that they've gone in a different direction."
beer,3c6a61,concretepigeon,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:21:55 2015 UTC,"It's fine if they simply decide not to do cask. But what bugs me is how they've gone from doing cask in their early years to actively badmouthing cask and CAMRA.  Compare that to e.g. Thornbridge, which is also well-recognized as a modern craft brewery instead of a traditional real ale brewery, and which does cask, keg and bottles, without discounting any of these containers."
beer,3c6a61,_ak,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:22:01 2015 UTC,"But what bugs me is how they've gone from doing cask in their early years to actively badmouthing cask and CAMRA.   Well they did cask for the reasons I mentioned. The nature of the British brewing industry is that if you want an ale distributed in pubs you need to do cask. BrewDog led the way in a slight shift away from that, but I can hardly blame them for shifting. They also don't criticise cask (although they don't do it). Being critical of CAMRA is totally reasonable. They're a big organisation and powerful in the industry. They aren't above criticism."
beer,3c6a61,concretepigeon,2,Sun Jul 5 21:37:50 2015 UTC,"They definitely have criticised cask. At least for IPA. And they're probably even right, I've never had a great IPA on cask."

I cant speak for the breweries who think that these ""sexy"" labels are a good idea. I understand women are more marketable than men though and i think that some of the most egregious labels seem to be a bit short sighted.

I suppose you could say I assumed you where defending the articles conclusion, and i apologize for this, however i find the idea that using sex in marketing is somehow wrong is a huge double standard and most people only care when its -MALE- sexually thats being advertised.  For example; is it bad that strawberry daiquiris are advised for women? Should they be forced to sex up the drink to appeal to men?  As an asside, i think the success of campings such as protine woulds ""beach body"" posters shows that appealing to our desire to be sexy is very effective, so... im not really sure what you have against these branding techniques."
beer,3cbpv3,Psuedofem,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:00:39 2015 UTC,"Also i find it funny that you think there should be a higher standard in beer than in literature.   I think there should be a higher standard for craft beer marketing than there should be for romance novels. Romance novels are the Milwaukee's Best of literature.   Who's this ""we"" that's aiming for a standard?   I dunno - how about the craft beer community? This is a group that has no problem sharing opinions -- strong ones at that -- of brewer's marketing practices. I mean it's July and we're still talking about the stupid Super Bowl ad. The ad ""offended people's sensibilities"" so I'm not sure why labels which offend people get a free pass from the same group.  And I've read your other posts, so I don't want to get into a pissing match with someone who obviously has a lot of piss to throw around, but who says ""that strawberry daiquiris are advised for women?"" Is this 1950?"
beer,3cbpv3,InLikeErrolFlynn,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:43:56 2015 UTC,"Yea, I like getting into arguments on the internet. It's a personality flaw, but oh well.   But let's be clear about your position. You have no problem with fashion, makeup, romance novels, romantic movies, protein and health supplements but craft beer shouldn't be able to make any double entendre because there should be a higher standard?  So the question is what measurement are you using? You tried to say it was less effective last time but the sucess of protein world kind of removes that possibility.  Now first off, the reason people disliked the superbowl commercial isn't because ""it offended our delicate sensibilities"" (im assuming you meen Budweisers commercial btw) there is a fundamental disagreement between how you're supposed to enjoy beer, and budweiser is celebrating an antagonistic ""anti intellectual"" attitude where people don't care about quality. They are literally trying to celebrate their bad business practices. People who strive to be knowledgeable about something shouldn't be denigrated, they should be emulated. (Btw i don't personally have anything against the ad)  And these labels don't offend the same group of people because beer aficionados care about taste, not gender politics.  Now, as for strawberry daiquiris, are you trying to say that this drink DOES appeal to men with your snarky backhanded ""1950's"" remark? Im just going to ignore it and try and rephrase the question so you'll accept it and give a real response.  Girly drinks like say... appletinies don't appeal to men. Should bartenders be forced to change the presentation or the recipe so it appeals more to men? Do you see it as just as bad when men are ""left out"" or is it only bad when women are ""left out""?"

The problem I've noticed is primarily with American craft stuff, which is a shame. There's still a reluctance over there to give it a shot, and then when they do, it's with stale and mishandled beers, and so the stigma continues. Demand isn't high enough yet.

You might also want to look out for Belgian Whites like Hoegaarden or Blue Moon if you're on a budget. These are all pretty easy-going styles, and nowhere near as intense as IPAs.

beer,3c41ru,notahipster-,40,Sat Jul 4 17:24:18 2015 UTC,"Beers don't really expire. They're safe to drink for a long time. ""Typical"" beers just might not taste as intended, or taste good, if you drink them too long after they've been bottled or canned. A lot depends on the style of beer, the ingredients used and the alcohol content of the beer.  Generally speaking, beers with high alcohol content age better than say, a simple pale ale. A quick look at the Sam Adams website says Utopia is 28% ABV. That's pretty damn strong, so it's probably going to hold up well over a long period of time.  Why is this desirable? Depending on what goes into the beer, the beer might take on different characteristics and taste as it ages. Sometimes there's diminishing returns on this process, or the beer peaks at a certain point in the aging process.  So you're basically gambling on the idea that a beer bottled 13 years ago has aged into a beer with a very good/unique taste. Is that guaranteed? No, but the chances of that being true are pretty decent.  I'm not very familiar with this specific beer, but it seems to be a seasonal limited production thing. Often with these types of beers, recipes get tweaked from year to year. So if you had a time machine and tasted the 2002 Utopia fresh, it might taste a bit different from the 2015 Utopia fresh.  Some people like to get a variety of aged bottles then crack them open at the same time and do a taste test. How does a 13 year aged 2002 compare to a 7 year aged 2008 versus a just bottled 2015?  So that's why someone might pay a ridiculous amount of money for this bottle of 2002 beer. In short, just remember some beers might be treated similar to wines of a certain vintage that if aged over time become more valuable."

beer,3c41ru,wtstephens,8,Sun Jul 5 11:05:01 2015 UTC,"the TL; DR is the higher the alcohol content, the longer a beer will hold up. Sam Adams Utopias is the highest strength naturally fermented beverage ever produced, so...  EDIT: forgot to include ""Utopias."""
beer,3c41ru,brettyv82,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:51:15 2015 UTC,"A tiny bit of yeast sediment released into the bottle will also allow a beer to age a bit more as well.  Any oxygen that leeches into the bottle could (in theory) be consumed by the yeast, assuming it isn't shocked or dropped out."
beer,3c41ru,wtstephens,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:53:06 2015 UTC,"That, and hops are a natural preservative. The big change in the beer from what I understand as it ages is that the aromatic and bitter hops tend to mellow out as it ages. This can be a good thing, or it can turn a perfectly-balanced beer around. Take, for instance, a 28% ABV with more mellow hops would make the malt flavor more apparent by juxtaposition. I would, however, be very curious about any perceivable difference in mouthfeel."
beer,3c41ru,brettyv82,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:43:06 2015 UTC,"Correct about hop character mellowing over time. This is why you should drink IPAs as fresh as possible, especially ones that use a lot of sweet crystal malt, because otherwise you end up with a cloyingly sweet beer when the bitterness from the hops fade.  Sam Adams Utopias has hops in it (or else it wouldn't really be beer) however you'd be hard pressed to taste them. Even before it makes it into the bottle it's aged for years in barrels, which would diminish any noticeable hop presence. It has been a few years since I tasted it, but I remember it being closer to port than beer. Thick and sweet like maple syrup, and quite warm from the alcohol."
beer,3c41ru,wtstephens,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:44:00 2015 UTC,"I've never had Utopia, as my state doesn't allow ABVs above 12%. Just added it to my Untappd wishlist, though."

beer,3c41ru,SubcommanderMarcos,2,Wed Jul 8 13:35:33 2015 UTC,Maybe because the beer isn't carbonated and the alcohol content is high it lasts for longer? I don't know too much about beer other than that I like it to be honest
beer,3c41ru,Givemeawayoutofhere,2,Sat Jul 4 17:30:27 2015 UTC,"Calling Utopias beer is a stretch. It is barley, hops, water, and yeast, but it's 28% and tastes more like a port brandy than a beer.   Beside that point many styles of beer can age for years as they change and develop over time. Not all improve, but all change. Of course the definition of what ""improve"" means is between you and your tongue alone."
beer,3c41ru,FBIinformant,16,Sat Jul 4 17:33:41 2015 UTC,"It's not really a stretch at all ... far less a stretch than with partially freeze-distilled beers like Brewdog's Tactical Nuclear Penguin (32% Imperial Stout), for example.  The thing that defines most types of alcohol is where the fermentable sugars come from.  In the case of Utopias it comes from grain, and the final product is not distilled (like a grain vodka or a new make whisky would be). It may not taste like other beers you've had, but it absolutely is a beer."

Seek out the small guys, many of them are making better beer than the mass produced production breweries like Green Flash. Stone, Green Flash, and Ballast Point are tourist traps. Go for those places that don't bottle or can (Societe, Intergalatic, Butchers, 32 North, Toolbox, Wavelength, Fall, Rip Current, Council, Monkey Paw). Don't go to the Boutiquey Bars (there's a lot of them of 30th). Churchill's, Hamilton's, Small Bar and Obrien's are great (O'brien's almost always has Pliny on tap)...

The weather is beautiful this time of year and there are plenty of other outdoor activities you can do during a trip.  Other than that, /r/beertrade is you best bet.  If you do decide to roadtrip it, check out The Alchemist's website for a list of stores that get shipments and when they receive them.  For places that sell cases, you may want to call ahead and see what time they open, then get there a little before they do.  When I went to one place in Montpelier, there was a line formed 30 minutes before the Co-op even opened.  If you can only go on a weekend, you should still have some luck buying 4 packs, you just might need to hunt around a little more."

beer,3c6h8u,itbizbd2015,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:01:04 2015 UTC,"I used to go to Beerfest every year when I lived there. There are some major downsides to it.   Since Jungle Beer closed down, there's not really been a true Singaporean craft brewery. Sure there's Archipelago which is owned by Heineken Asia Pacific and its direction is a crippled. The Pump Room only produces for its restaurants. Same goes for LeVeL33, Tawandang, Starker and a few more. Then you've got the shit like 1925 and AdstraGold that are using pre-hopped malt extract. The food system is absolute crap. There are fantastic options but you're stuck with the equivalent of a McDonald's rip off that you end up paying $10 for a crappy burger. The music side of things seems to have died down. Beerfest was started by a company called Timbre that try to encourage local bands however from what I hear this year the music selection and bands seemed to be completely off. The same band would play the same music in the jazz tent as the main tent.    That said I will say that it has helped raise the profile of craft beer in Singapore. When I first moved to Singapore you wouldn't see many places offering Stone or Deschutes (both on tap and in bottles) whereas now there are more and more restaurants opting for more beer options which is great for the consumer."

You should skip Brewgrass for a few reasons. Its a drunk fest where you will get really drunk and probably forget the vast of majority of the beers you drank and what they tasted like. Secondly the brewers hate that fest and some of the best breweries in the area don't attend. Don't go to fests that don't get the brewers themselves excited, they bring the beer they want to get rid of, not their best most interesting brews.  My advice would be go to the south slope, hit up Burial, Greenman, Twin Leaf, Wicked Weeds Funkatorium and if you still feel like drinking go the Thirsty Monk or Tasty Beverage."

beer,3byn9m,youveruinedtheactgob,15,Fri Jul 3 21:14:26 2015 UTC,"Many users of reddit don't have a direct relationship with her or wouldn't immediately see why her firing affects their use of the site. In the grander scheme, though, the firing is the catalyst that set off all the pent up frustration that many moderators and power users have with the employees of the site.   The key to understanding the outrage (and where your daily experience with the site becomes relevant) is that the problems that mods have with the admins are roadblocks that make it harder to effectively run communities. For example, did you know that the majority of the tools used to run subreddits are 3rd party tools, developed by people that don't work at reddit over at /r/toolbox? Reddit's inherent tools make it very difficult for mods of decent sized subreddits like /r/beer to fight spam, remove people who abusively post personal information, keep subreddits on topic (like beer posts in a beer sub), and respond to modmail sent from users. I can tell you that those problems are a thousandfold in some of the biggest subreddits, including /r/AskReddit where I mod, which is currently the biggest subreddit on the site.  On the surface, it does seem silly to close off hundreds of the biggest subreddits because somebody at reddit got fired. Although /r/IAMA is just one subreddit, don't forget that President Obama did do an IAMA there which brought down the site as the admin team scrambled. Ultimately, though, the frustration isn't just because one person got fired. It is because the way they handled that is representative of their disregard for the thousands of unpaid moderators who work tirelessly to give users the experience that they have when visiting reddit.com. If you want the site to improve and the employees of reddit to be more transparent with its communities, moderators, and userbase, then you should care about the recent events."
beer,3byn9m,pursuitoffappyness,7,Fri Jul 3 19:19:00 2015 UTC,"That is the only 100% coherent explanation I've seen so far, thank you. I fully support the right of mods to make their subs private in protest, and I see why an open dialogue between mods and admins is important. I guess it mostly confused me that so many thousands of (non-mod) redditors were suddenly on a colloquial first-name basis with one reddit admin, acting as if a member of their family had been unjustly fired."
beer,3byn9m,always-wanting-more,4,Fri Jul 3 19:33:56 2015 UTC,"Oh, well, it is my opinion that reddit's demographic is young and therefore has a strong anti-authortiarian streak.

Plus, Victoria has always been one of the most responsive admins in answering people's questions and actually participating in the community."

They were just promoting this or that or the other. See President Obama's AMA for the best example. As more and more celebrities started going on because their PR people made them, the bar for interesting people who weren't famous got higher. At this point it's just a waste of bandwidth. A famous person does an AMA and suddenly everybody is checking it out because Buzzfeed told them about it, and then it overwhelms the rest of the site."

My new move Pirates of the Carribean 12: Curse of the Dead Man's End is coming out July 24, it's pretty cool stuff. AMA"". So lots of people have seen her first name more than any other moniker."

Once reddit gold was implemented Ellen Pao made it clear that this site was profit based but that's exactly how sites like digg died. Subreddits going private is an effective protest because it actually shuts down a portion of reddit.   On a side note just from briefly going through your comment history you're a huge asshole.

Especially if she was insubordinate in any way, which includes ""differences of opinion"" on the direction of AMA or any other area on which she was paid to work.    Who the hell actually thinks of this place as a ""community""?  It's a message board.  It's a chat room.  It's a fucking picture blog with the ability to comment and have your 2 seconds of gratification from getting some points.    It's a place to find porn.  It's a place to ask a question and maybe get a decent answer.    It's not a community.  It's not your home.  It's not free.  It's a company; it has investors; it has accountability.  It has attorneys who are  constantly defending lawsuits against it.  It has expenses.  It has competition.  It makes money off people's content.  It makes money off gold.  Fucking fantastic.  They are not forcing people to share their work, or buy their gold.  You can go elsewhere.  You don't because you have nothing of value to contribute.  The best you can do is bitch about some girl who was fired over god-knows-what, and claim they are taking away your rights to see fat people publicly shamed, or 12 year-old girls in bikinis.  I hope you're not stupid enough to think that those subreddits were taken away because they just felt like it.  They were taken away because reddit is getting sued.  They are losing money.  They represent a very small concession to an otherwise profitable model.  You want your 12-year old girls in bikinis, go to find it elsewhere and shut the fuck up.  As for Victoria, fuck her--or maybe not.  Doesn't matter.  As for the mods, fuck them.  They do this shit for the attention and good for them.  Everyone needs a hobby, but they are not forced to be here either.  As for this ""open and honest"" shit, fuck you for thinking reddit's administrative, legal or financial departments have any obligation for being ""open and honest"" with YOU.  You want reddit's tax returns?  You want their attorney work product?  You want to be informed about the direction of their marketing team?  Go apply for a job there and quit whining on some message board.  As for Ellen Pao, I haven't seen one fucking thing so far in this entire fucking mess, even in the circlejerk/punchable faces threads, that actually puts together a cohesive thought on why someone hates her--apart from her being unattractive and suing her former company over alleged discrimination.  I'm just going to assume that the hatred for those two things is just attributable to the fact that 95% of the user base are males in college and otherwise stupid as shit.

Thank you for being level headed about this. Reddit has been behaving so childishly lately. It's a website, not a country. Jeez. Sometimes employees get let go, or policies change regarding content.

The subreddits closing is not because of her firing (reddit is a private company and she was ostensibly fired legally and for legitimate reasons) but because of the way the company left moderators of multiple subreddits, including /r/iama, /r/books, and /r/science, high and dry with no contact points for professionals and celebrities who have agreed far in advance to do AMAs on the site. This disregard for mods who run the site and try to keep the subreddits running was the impetus that set up all of the slowly percolating frustration many mods (and users) have had with the admins for quite a while. If you still think it's dumb, I get that, but hopefully you have a more clear perspective on why it happened and how it is greater than just the fact that an employee was fired."

I never met Victoria, I'm sure she was nice and good at her job, but if she works at a business, that business wants to change a small bit of her job to help the business make more money, they wanted to add video answers to some IMAs, she was resisting the change. It's fine to disagree with the changes being made, but it's not like a business trying to make money or add videos is evil.    The real reason people are mad is because there are a lot of really terrible subreddits that got banned. Is censorship a bad thing? Yea sure, mostly, but is /r/coontown or fatpeoplehate a good thing? No they are not. They are completely fuckd, they influence the young users on this site to be more hateful people and it's disgusting.   Is it the place of reddit admins to change that?

We call them sours because most beers now-a-days aren't sour, a sour beer is often very off-putting for people not familiar with it, it let's you know what you're getting into.   Also, many breweries (especially American) are making beers that are sour but don't necessarily fall into the category of a lambic, geuze, berliner weisse, etc.   And often times sour is the dominant flavour, so why not describe it like that? Lots of IPA hybrids are named things like hoppy brown ale, hoppy wheat, hoppy tripel. We don't need more traditional names like India Pale Ale that don't describe the style at all, if it doesn't fit a traditional guideline call it what you want, and hopefully what you're going to expect by drinking it."

beer,3bzlgs,Hopsnmalts,0,Fri Jul 3 14:22:15 2015 UTC,"There are some beers that are sour or tart (two different flavors) but they are just that. Flavors.  Sour is not now, nor has it ever been a style. Oude Bruin is a style. Flanders Red is a style. Lambic is a style. American Wild Ale is actually a style. Berlinerweisse is a style.  They are all done with top fermenting ale yeast - so they are totally ales. Also brett can taste like anything. It can be fruity, tart, a little funky or fucking straight up George Clinton humping a wheel of Red Hawk.  This is not a criticism of these beers. I love them. But let's educate rather than dumbing down something we are passionate about."
beer,3bzlgs,Hopsnmalts,10,Fri Jul 3 21:04:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not suggesting ""sour"" is a specific term like Flanders Red et al, but rather a good umbrella term in the vein of ale and lager.  If anything, giving people awareness of the difference between ale, lager and ales/lagers that are soured is a great start to more education."
beer,3bzlgs,k-bo,-11,Fri Jul 3 21:11:00 2015 UTC,"But ale and lager are not umbrella terms. They specifically refer to fermentation, ie what temperature yeast likes to hang out at and where it likes to have lunch.  Requesting one or the other at your bar probably won't get you any closer to drinking what you want.  Nor would asking for a sour. If you've only had shit from cascade and someone throws a monks cafe or a basque cider then you are still no closer to getting what you want.   Yall can believe what you want. You are now and forever wrong. Sour is a fucking flavor."
beer,3bzlgs,DoktorJesus,7,Sat Jul 4 01:58:31 2015 UTC,"Ale is an umbrella term for beer brewed with top fermenting yeast and lager is an umbrella term for beer brewery with bottom fermented beer. And so what if it's a flavor not a style. Are you not allowed to call a beer by the style? If someone tells me to pass the beer with the green label, I'm not going to call him an idiot and tell him it's a kolsch, I'm going to give him the beer. Even though ""green label"" is neither flavor nor style."
beer,3bzlgs,Hopsnmalts,4,Sat Jul 4 02:43:55 2015 UTC,"To this point, ""sour"" is a great term, because it essentially refers to beers that have been fermented with any number of lacto-fermenting bacteria strains incorporated (or acetic, or isovaleric, or whatever acids are making the beer sour.) It's especially useful when differentiating saison or farmhouse ales, or ales brewed with brett, where it can be difficult to determine whether not the beer is intended to be sour."
beer,3bzlgs,k-bo,-2,Sat Jul 4 06:52:38 2015 UTC,"That's not the point. The point is OP posted an uninformed article with incorrect information.  I don't like stouts, I only drink ales like Pilsner."
beer,3bzlgs,k-bo,2,Sat Jul 4 22:38:22 2015 UTC,"Nowhere is my information factually incorrect. I never suggested that people should ask for a ""sour"" at a bar.

beer,3bzlgs,mishugashu,2,Sat Jul 4 23:53:47 2015 UTC,"As I said in my comment to the post, not all sour beers are done in a traditional style. If you're brewing a traditional sour beer in the style guidelines, call it that, which most breweries do. If you're just fermenting for lacto, adding lactic acid, or even as the Ontario brewing Flying Monkey did with their Down By The Bay and just throwing a bunch of sour watermelon candies in the fermenter, why not call it sour? It describes what you're getting into.  A name won't deter you from further discovering flavours and aromas within the beer."

Even the Arrogant Bastard is pushing it a bit. I'm definitely picking up a lighter more summery beer this weekend.
beer,3c040e,Mister_Potamus,2,Fri Jul 3 21:07:54 2015 UTC,"Best thing about Sierra Nevada having a brewery in North Carolina is that their beers are now on the same price tier as the 'craft' brews under the umbrella of the mega brewers.  Just scored a 12 of Torpedo for 11.99. A dollar for a beer sporting 7.2% ABV? And it tastes awesome? And it doesn't have a barnyardy aftertaste (Ranger), or a metallic twang (many double IPA's)? Helllllll yes!  Edit: Yeah I get the dark beer + hot weather thing. But Torpedo isn't that malty or heavy."
beer,3c040e,Givemeawayoutofhere,2,Fri Jul 3 21:27:38 2015 UTC,Agreed. Being near Kansas City I get Single Wide for about the same price so I tend to buy that. But of all the beers listed I'd probably prefer the torpedo and maybe the 99 shilling to anything else.

beer,3c14kb,CBFisaRapist,4,Fri Jul 3 21:57:44 2015 UTC,"You'd have to put down more beer than you could possibly finish to get the equivalent of a cup of coffee, if that's what you're worried about.  A single bottle of coffee beer might have the equivalent of 1/4 - 1/2 an ounce of coffee in in, and the higher end of that scale would make it a beer with the coffee really up front. In many cases it will be even less, maybe in the 1/8 - 1/4 oz range per 12 oz bottle.  In other words, to drink the equivalent of a standard 8 oz cup of coffee, you'd have to get one of the most potent coffee beers out there and drink 16 of them. For most, you'd have to drink 32 beers or more.  If you can't / don't drink caffeine, you can still drink plenty of coffee beers without worry.  Source: I brew and did the math. I can't drink caffeine and coffee beers are some of my favorites, so can also confirm the effects, or lack thereof."

beer,3c14kb,sevets,2,Sat Jul 4 03:36:03 2015 UTC,"Some coffee beers brew the coffee separately and add it in during fermentation, so I'd imagine it'd be the same for just regular coffee that was older. Even if coffee is added during the cooking, some methods of brewing regular coffee do the same and I'd imagine there to be a good amount of caffeine left. Ultimately, it comes down to how resilient caffeine as a molecule is.  Perhaps it's be more a question for a scientific forum."

beer,3c3puh,brettyv82,6,Sat Jul 4 17:54:01 2015 UTC,"White oak is used for oak aging, not red. You smell a lot of oak because red oak is pungent. White oak is not, but it has an unique cellular structure that makes it ideal for working with liquids. It's part of why both the wine and spirits industries use it so widely.  Out of curiosity, did you know what you were doing when you charred it, or did you just wing it when it came to that, too?"

I think you could do this, but you're likely going to have to slow down to get a real quality result."
beer,3c3puh,TheoreticalFunk,6,Sat Jul 4 14:00:46 2015 UTC,"On the homebrewing scale, two months can actually be quite a bit of time. It may even result in his beer becoming overly oaky, depending on what kind of oak he's using and the amount.  On the home scale, whether using small barrels, chips or cubes, your surface area to volume ratio is way different than on a pro scale; your beer is in contact with a lot more wood.  You can get robust oak & bourbon in just a couple of weeks, often a month at the high end. Soak the chips in bourbon for a week, lay the beer on top of them (with a little of the bourbon) for two, and you'll have some fairly potent bourbon & oak flavor."

Much of that, however, was in the form of “small beer”—a diluted, fermented slurry of grains and water that was consumed at breakfast and lunch   No, it wasn't a 'slurry'. The grains were filtered out (lautered) just like any other beer. It's beer. Regular beer. Just very low alcohol.   Before water filtration was commonplace, small beer guarded against cholera and other infections because it was mashed and fermented.   No, boiling (or at least getting above pasteurization temps) was the primary reason beer was safer than water. The alcohol and hops (or other bitterings) helped keep it sanitary so they're also on the list. Mashing is right at a temp to actually encourage growth of bacteria and other microbiologicals, but is a necessary step in brewing.  More on point though - I do love low alcohol beers if they've got enough flavor. What kills me is the price. It's probably due to taxation and other logistics, but less than 4% ABV craft beer isn't that much cheaper than a full strength one. Good thing it's easy to homebrew low alcohol beers - I made a 2.9% stout in March that was wonderful."

Mashing was/is traditionally done around 152F (67C) for 60 minutes. Most pathogenic bacteria will be killed at those temps, because the human body is about 98F (37C), they aren't going to grow well in a mash.

beer,3bvfvg,toasterjoey6,2,Fri Jul 3 09:28:24 2015 UTC,"Pasteurization (the killing of bad things) is a process that relies on temperature and time. Well, more accurately it is heat and time but temp is close enough for us to work with.  Basically, you'll kill everything you want to kill either with a very high temp or with an effective temp over a good while. 140°F is not very hot (~medium for a steak) but it is hot enough if you keep everything that temperature for ten minutes or so. If you take a mash to 140°F and then immediately remove it from the heat (or worse, chill it down intentionally) then you might not get the results you want.  Not actually often a problem for brewing or fermenting but it is in cooking or safe food handling."

beer,3bvfvg,RoseOfSharonCassidy,9,Thu Jul 2 18:40:02 2015 UTC,It's just that a beer with half the ingredients seems like it should cost less to most people. The issue is that he malt is only a small part of the price.
beer,3bvfvg,hebephrenic,2,Thu Jul 2 18:54:56 2015 UTC,"yep... All Day IPA has a buttload of hops in it, which is a big reason it's not cheap   It's also a million times better than BMC type beers, and only a little more expensive. So there's that, too"
beer,3bvfvg,goblueM,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:12:36 2015 UTC,"From a position of ignorance, does it really take less ingredients to make low abv beer? Why is that? I had no idea."
beer,3bvfvg,areyouawake,4,Fri Jul 3 00:55:32 2015 UTC,"Yep. Alcohol % is related to the amount of fermentable sugars that go into the beer. If you add 12 pounds of barley you get (generally) more alcohol than if you add 6. Also, since there is less alcohol/body as the alcohol gets lower, many (though I disagree with the practice) add fewer hops to balance this. Further, if there is less fermentable sugar, you need to use less yeast, so overall fewer ingredients.  Overall, though, I think that when you take into account packaging, distribution through the three-tier American system, taxes, etc., it does not make as much of a difference as people think.  IMO it is much harder to make a flavorful and interesting low ABV beer, so I am actually happy to pay as much for the experience. Objectors have a theoretical (if maybe not practical) point based on ingredient costs. The ""I need to pay twice as much to get drunk"" camp is eve more correct, though that is not usually why I drink beer."
beer,3bvfvg,hebephrenic,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:35:56 2015 UTC,Low ABV high-quality beers are harder to make. Because you can't mask any off-flavours with hops or dark malts.

beer,3bvfvg,MillionMonkeyArmy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:49:57 2015 UTC,What? That makes low abv drinking a better deal. For your dollar you get the same amount of alcohol but more delicious product.  And I found the math: 4x44 cL cans Guinness at 3.5% abv is 68.5 SEK 1x44 cL can Guinness at 4.2% abv is 21.3 SEK Or 6x50 cL cans Falcon at 3.5% abv is 59.95 SEK 1x33 cL can Falcon at 5.2% abv is 9.9 SEK 1x50 cL can Falcon at 5.2% abv is 13.5 SEK
beer,3bvfvg,Ethanol_Based_Life,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:53:47 2015 UTC,"If you want to help the low-abv drinkers, you up the limit in grocery stores to 3.9% and make everything up to 3.5% tax exempt like 2.8%.  However this would be such a loss of revenue and at the same time a benefit to public health that our dear leader + all powerful state would not like this.  The monopoly ONLY exists as a source of revenue. Otherwise they wouldn't have retarded taxation laws and they would in some way make the pre-party experience a bit milder, with for instance looser regulation on alcohol sales to the public.  I would settle for a 4.2-4.4% allowed like in Norway or Finland at ICA and a serious easing on the alcohol permit process. Then I would shut up.  I think it's complete and utter bullshit to pay 9.9 for a 33 cl can of horsepiss. It's a joke."

beer,3bvfvg,retrosike,3,Fri Jul 3 15:22:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but honestly so is the definition a lot of craft beer drinkers seem to use. People increasingly want ""sessionable"" to just mean ""under 5% ABV,"" which leads to a lot of beers that really aren't particularly sessionable -- sours and really hoppy beers especially -- wearing the label. I'm certainly not as rigid about defining session beer as the English tend to be, but I still find calling something like Westbrooke Gose a session beer pretty silly."
beer,3bvfvg,rrrx,-1,Thu Jul 2 16:09:09 2015 UTC,"I think sessionable means different thing to different people because our tastes and tolerances vary.  To me, it's more a concept and less a set description of the beer. I wouldn't session Westbrook Gose either, but I can see someone doing it.  Currently Terrapin RecreationAle(4.7%) or OB Pinner(4.9%) are my sessions of choice."

beer,3bvfvg,o0joshua0o,2,Fri Jul 3 14:21:41 2015 UTC,"As far as I've understood, you can't hide anything behind massive hops or dark malts.  But you are far less likely to get a boozy kind of off-flavour since it's low ABV and that just doesn't happen.  I think it's trickier than you think, but it's also fairly cheap to make, since less ingredients etc. I actually think it's maybe easier to make hops shine through a low-abv beer since they don't have to compete with a hefty grain-bill in recipe-crafting.  I know one guy in my country who does only low-ABV beers that are impossible to get drunk on. He sells out all the time, to restaurants with near one star in the guide michelin or with one star (have to check), retailers etc.  He even sells the beer online. Since it's basically soda with 2% ABV, he can do that. I think he doesn't even pay that much for ingredients either, despite having a big-ass brewing rig."

I managed to find some of the original at a CVS, and it blew away 2.0 side-by-side, despite being a few months older at least.  2) The beer you got in PA was exposed to prolonged heat or light at some point between Stone and your glass.  3) Peoples expectations were set too high out of nostalgia.   4) New beers have come out in the meantime that have surpassed RuinTen in terms of what it originally accomplished.  5) Years of RuinTen exposure has permanently damaged our taste receptors.  Either way, I live in San Diego and have decided I'm making the short drive to a Stone Company Store right now. Will report back in about a half hour with my take on this."

beer,3by4ge,thepipesarecall,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:16:53 2015 UTC,"You're right bud, thus year's RuinTen was underwhelming. Still delicious, but underwhelming. Disappointed considering this has been one of my favorite beers for the last couple years.  Bottled 6/25."

beer,3by4ge,azizabah,5,Fri Jul 3 21:52:31 2015 UTC,"I had a bottle in Ohio yesterday and it was fantastic. Great hop flavor and easy drinking, especially for the abv. Mine was bottled slightly earlier I think so maybe there was a batch issue."
beer,3by4ge,letsgetbrickfaced,2,Fri Jul 3 03:39:49 2015 UTC,Sorry for your bad experience. I just finished a refrigerated one from bevmo in cen CA that was bottled on 6/13. It was good but not great. I found it just nondescript but above average in all aspects of beer. I'm not a beer expert but I was just mostly dissatisfied with the hype and not the beer itself. Still an above average but not special beer. Hope the one you had was not subject to poor care.
beer,3by4ge,cluster_1,-2,Fri Jul 3 06:06:24 2015 UTC,"Try again. Was either a bad bottle or your taste buds were burnt out by something at the time.   It's as good as it ever was for me, and I've been in love with this beer since the 2012 one."
beer,3by4ge,slash196,-5,Fri Jul 3 15:11:47 2015 UTC,Beer is much more art than science still. It could have been a bad batch due to poor quality hops. I have frequently had go-to pale ales and IPAs that I suddenly had to stop drinking because the quality had fallen off a cliff.
beer,3by4ge,Nomsensus,6,Fri Jul 3 12:26:15 2015 UTC,Beer is much more art than science still. It could have been a bad batch due to poor quality hops.     Huh? Biological issues with the hops are exactly due to the science behind the beer and less the art.

Hoppy - Founder's All Day IPA  Malty - Breckenridge Vanilla Porter Belgian - Brasserie Lefèbvre Blanche de Bruxelles Fruit - McAuslan St. Ambrose Apricot  Tart - Bell's Oarsman Sour - Jolly Pumpkin Bam Biere - not cheap :(   Looking for some other new ideas for the weekend.  Edit:  Added Bell's Oarsman as an alternative to the expensive sour (I don't know a good cheap sour).  Also, these are based on general, year-round availability with a fairly decent distribution.

beer,3bwbvm,quantummotion,2,Thu Jul 2 20:45:53 2015 UTC,I just saw that Ballast Point makes a kolsch that they for some reason call a pale ale: http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/199/696/    I've never tried it so I can't vouch for it but you should be able to find it in California I imagine.    I really like the style because it's middle of the road ABV (usually around 5% or less) and it's a very clean beer.
beer,3bwbvm,loudstain,2,Thu Jul 2 20:50:14 2015 UTC,"Might be wrong on this...someone correct me if so, but I'm pretty sure Kolsch is one of those things like champagne...it can only be called a Kolsch if it's brewed in that region of Germany, hence why they're calling theirs a pale ale (which is also weird because it's a lager...)"
beer,3bwbvm,maszpiwo,2,Sat Jul 4 14:15:14 2015 UTC,"You're right on one part, wrong on another. My way of getting around it is I call it ""kolsch style"" because it is indeed only a kolsch if it comes from a specific region.    However, it is still an ale."

It's their flagship beer so most likely, which is a great example of west coast IPAs.   Rampant is a bit dry for my taste. Big daddys nice and fruity.

beer,3c1sws,iroh_zenmaster,9,Fri Jul 3 23:43:19 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that you are referring to Stone Enjoy By IPA (one specific beer) and not a sell by/drink by date system in general. From what I've heard, Stone will buy back all the unsold beer from stores/bars so that customers only ever drink fresh beer. This is different than what pobody is suggesting. Essentially hoppy beers like an IPA need to be consumed fresh to get the full effect and flavor of the hops. If you drink them when they have sat too long the flavor changes and you are no longer tasting the beer that they brewery wanted you to get. Is there a bit of marketing going on? Yes, but there is certainly a benefit to drinking fresh IPA's."
beer,3c1sws,Omophorus,2,Sat Jul 4 02:49:29 2015 UTC,"To piggyback on this.   It's a tasty beer that's also a marketing campaign for Stone.  They brew a batch several times a year and the ""Enjoy By"" date is always a holiday like July 4th or Valentine's Day.   They bottle it about 6 weeks (give or take) before that ""Enjoy By"" date, so that consumers get it and are encouraged to drink it as fresh as possible.   It's absolutely a marketing gimmick, but it's also a top quality beer, so it's worth trying in spite of the gimmick."
beer,3c1sws,iroh_zenmaster,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:11:51 2015 UTC,Agreed.
beer,3c1sws,iroh_zenmaster,0,Sat Jul 4 18:29:34 2015 UTC,"No, I was referring to beers in which the bottling date is an enjoy by date instead.  If I like IPAs that are 2 weeks old or less, an enjoy by date is worth fuck all.  I mean if your going to bother to label each beer with anything besides the label then isn't the bottling date itself worth the most info-wise?"
beer,3c1sws,pobody,2,Sat Jul 4 15:38:45 2015 UTC,"OK. Gotcha. Then yes, the bottling date is more informative if you have a certain level of knowledge about beer (which it sounds like you do). I think that breweries opt for a consume by date in order to provide a number that people are more accustomed to seeing (like on food)."
beer,3c1sws,holemole,4,Sat Jul 4 18:32:19 2015 UTC,"That's not there to help you. That's to encourage the merchant to discount or throw out old stock and buy new stock, the idea being that the customers will not want to buy ""stale"" beer."
beer,3c1sws,pobody,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:45:44 2015 UTC,"So...   That's not there to help you.   But...   the customers will not want to buy ""stale"" beer.   Which one is it?   The customer wouldn't know the beer is stale without the date (short of cracking it open, anyways)."
beer,3c1sws,dirtycomatose,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:52:06 2015 UTC,"My point is it does not help the consumer at all. Without the 'enjoy by' dates people would happily buy the beer and never know the difference. But posting a date instills the placebo effect, so they either (a) don't want to buy that case or (b) buy it and then think it tastes bad because they expect it to.  It's a gimmick that the brewery uses to sell more beer regardless of if it gets consumed or not."
beer,3c1sws,CBFisaRapist,3,Sat Jul 4 00:50:44 2015 UTC,Brewed on date matters a lot though. It's not really a gimmick.
beer,3c1sws,FBIinformant,3,Sat Jul 4 03:42:21 2015 UTC,"Without the 'enjoy by' dates people would happily buy the beer and never know the difference.   I strongly, strongly, strongly beg to differ. The whole reason why I refuse to purchase undated IPAs and pale ales anymore is because I too often ended up getting beer that was clearly well past prime time, and I'm far from alone in that. You don't need a date to know when you're drinking older beer.  You do, however, need a date to avoid buying it in the first place. I'd have taken a pass and saved my money if I knew ahead of time how old they were. I'm not alone in that, either.  It's not a gimmick. It's information that helps people who actually care about what they're buying make an informed choice."

Odell, great divide, left hand, new Belgium, Avery, Oskar Blues, Upslope, Tommyknocker are the ones I can think of right now, in particular I'm looking for those breweries with small distribution.  I'd also be interested beers from nearby states that could be obtained in CO but not in TX.   (Russian River for example)"
beer,3bxn79,BeerGoggleTan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:44:59 2015 UTC,Get a bottle from Trinity. Odd13 is my current local favorite. Eddyline and Crazy Mountain have good 6ers. Bootstrap makes my favorite IPA and pale.

beer,3bvuy8,jturkish,2,Sat Jul 4 00:51:15 2015 UTC,"Not a brewery, but Pre-Funk has quite a few IPAs in pretty heavy rotation. They're also next door to Woodland Empire so thats a good two-for-one (although I don't know what they are currently serving in the way of IPAs).  Another great beer destination is Payette Brewing and Haff Brewing down in Garden City. They're just a few blocks away from each other and both have some solid IPAs.  If you're willing to forgo the bar and buy some beer to take home with you, I highly recommend Selkirk Abbey's Infidel which is a great Belgian-style IPA."

beer,3bvuy8,andylion,2,Fri Jul 3 12:12:28 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you care more about the best IPAs specifically, vs. the breweries... 10 Barrel Joe IPA is the top one in town. Sockeye Dagger Falls, 10 Barrel Apocalypse, and Payette Outlaw are the next best local IPAs. You can sometimes get a Blood Orange Outlaw at Payette. Unfortunately, I think the NorCal IPA snob side of you won't love the rest of the strictly local offerings.  For other great beer that we get in from nearby, the beer spots (not breweries) around downtown are Taphouse, Bittercreek, Pre Funk, Bier Thirty. Look for Barley Brown's Pallet Jack for something closer to Pliny-level (how dare I?!).  I could probably go on and on here if you're not just hyper-focused on finding the IPAzzzz...  Edit: I feel like I should give you breweries to avoid. IMO: Edge, Post Modern, Ram, and Highland Hollows. I want to love all the breweries in town, and these places really all have good to great food, but good food makes you a good restaurant and good beer makes you a good brewery. I'm less-than-impressed with the beer coming out of these and I'd hate for you to form your opinions based on them. Sorry not sorry Boise."

And with the ABV on the label, you know what you're getting into before you even buy it much less open it. So I'm not sure I see the problem from the consumer standpoint. I'm sure a 64oz steak is nice, but that's too much for me so I don't order it. Or maybe I'll eat part save some for later. Or share it. But there's otherwise a menu full of alternatives in normal portions like always.  On the brewer side, with the exception of the sort of Brewdog-style stunts in the actual ABV arms race that they do just for the sake of it, I don't see ABV being the goal of brewers except when it's to be able to compete in this recent session beer trend. I don't think they say ""Let's make a 12% beer."" I think they say ""Let's make an awesome beer"" and then the chips fall where they may on ABV since they're not limiting themselves. Sometimes that means higher ABV.  I'm not having any problems with this issue myself, and on the broader scale I'm confidence supply and demand will sort themselves out as usual."

If I'm wrong anyone please correct me, as it's been a while since reading up on the laws, but in order to get a specialty beer at a store in your area you have to have that store request it from a distributor, and some of the distributors suck at getting a diverse selection or keeping their stores up to date on new releases. The two distriutors in my area I am aware of are Fabiano, or Mulenbeck for example. Even though Fabiano has expanded greatly what they are able or willing to order may be different than what a distributor from Detroit or Grand Rapids has to offer. So your cousin may have several beers from Michigan alone that are not available in the area. One of the better Michigan beers I have had that I don't see around much in my area is 51k IPA from Black Rocks brewery in Marquette MI for an example. I hope this helps!"

Dogfish Head does Burton Baton, for example, which sits in massive oak conditioning tanks and comes out amazing. Actual spirit or virgin oak barrels don't work as well, I don't think."
beer,3brhdt,rrrx,2,Wed Jul 1 19:53:24 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying. I'd be interested to see if aging it in virgin oak barrels creates too much of an oak flavor. So in your original post, I'm assuming you were referring to barrel aged beers with some kind of spirits in the barrels used."

Breweries and retailers have each approached the law somewhat differently, but the fact remains that nobody knows exactly what is sufficient and what is not sufficient to be, strictly speaking, legal.  Growler fills two days ago were very clear: they could only be in 32oz and 128oz volumes. No other restrictions existed.  Now, while 64oz is explicitly legal, all growlers must be labelled and demonstrate the contents, and be sealed. There's no specific clarity to what any of that actually means.

beer,3br1of,slash196,4,Wed Jul 1 13:46:25 2015 UTC,"I agree. However, I'm genuinely concerned that we're in a bit of a bubble right now, and that the growth might not be sustainable."
beer,3br1of,shukoroshi,3,Wed Jul 1 14:48:11 2015 UTC,"Bah. I've been listening to craft beer bubble doomsdayers prophesying The End since at least the mid-to-late-1990s. I just don't think there's much to it, and I actually think the claims have become less credible over time. Even Jim Koch, who used to warn about this, has recently said he thinks there's plenty of room for continued growth.   Even when domestic growth in the craft beer segment starts to slow -- which it eventually, inevitably will -- brewers will still have the option to expand their export business. Most craft breweries haven't even begun to think about that, since they're struggling just to meet domestic demand, but those that have (Brooklyn and Boston Beer in particular, which are pretty big in the UK and Scandinavia) have had good results.  I don't think there's room for a whole lot more big, national or regional brands the size of a Dogfish Head, or a Stone, or a Founders. But I also don't think that most craft breweries start with that goal in mind. The large majority of craft brewers don't want to dominate the market; they want to provide good jobs for themselves and their employees so they can live comfortably, and they can do that while staying pretty small. There's plenty of room for another 1000+ breweries the size of a Hill Farmstead or a Tree House. Just look at Belgium; if the States matched their density of breweries, we could comfortably double our current numbers."
beer,3br1of,rrrx,2,Wed Jul 1 21:46:48 2015 UTC,"Sam Adams lager is now brewed under license in the UK. Brooklyn's big, Sierra Nevada Pale is available in just about every supermarket in the UK now. A few others are doing pretty well. The only problem they'll have with exporting is that there are huge numbers of craft brewery's popping up in pretty much every developed country now."
beer,3br1of,concretepigeon,5,Wed Jul 1 23:09:01 2015 UTC,"Certainly the pace of growth isn't going to continue indefinitely, but major players like Brewdog already have established identities and strong business acumen.

beer,3br1of,cberra88,3,Wed Jul 1 21:14:01 2015 UTC,Not a chance. Rapid expansion in the UK hasn't led to cheaper prices. £4.90 for a pint of Punk IPA in their bars is taking the piss in my opinion.
beer,3br1of,Niode,2,Wed Jul 1 22:53:38 2015 UTC,£4.90? Where? Edinburgh is £4.40 a pint. We had it in at work for a thing and we had to put it on at £4.80 a pint and it still went out the door. I'd prefer paying £4.90 for a pint rather than that for a bottle. Craft ieg is still pricy in Britain for a number of reasons
beer,3br1of,alphabetown,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:44:10 2015 UTC,"To be honest that's not a ridiculous amount to pay for a pint of a 5.6% craft beer in any pub in Britain. It's rarely under 3 quid for a shit macro any more. It's stronger which means more malt and more tax, as well as being more heavily hopped. It costs more to produce, as is, and then you add to that the fucking ridiculous levels of tax in this country, their prices are pretty reasonable."
beer,3br1of,concretepigeon,2,Wed Jul 1 23:11:59 2015 UTC,Except that other UK breweries who aren't producing anywhere near brew dogs near macro brewery capacity aren't charging as much for mid strength IPA (in my opinion vastly better tasting) like Magic Rock/Buxton.
beer,3br1of,Niode,2,Thu Jul 2 06:47:05 2015 UTC,"That's possibly a concession they make to secure a foot in the door for market presence. As a bar manager, I take price heavily into consideration, and for premium products I have to think about the cash profit rather than the percentage GP. This is a risk, obviously, since a broken bottle or bad keg loses a lot more money. The smaller brewery is therefore able to make itself attractive by having a lower price, even though I know Brewdog's big name will sell reliably. Bigger operations like Brewdog have to hit high percentage GP goals consistency for their macro model to work.  Edit: Market** presence"
beer,3br1of,Litrebike,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:28:43 2015 UTC,What you're saying doesn't make sense. At such high brew lengths the overheads are drastically reduced increasing their GP as a result. Smaller breweries still have to meet their profit targets to grow as a business so I don't see the two strategies as mutually exclusive. The problem here is that BD aren't offsetting their increase in profit with the cost of their beer and then have the audacity to ask their fanboys to pay for their expansion with no return on their investment. Seems like BD are having their cake and eating it all while fools happily part with their money. Brewdog could charge less for their beer but they don't.
beer,3br1of,Niode,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:39:11 2015 UTC,"I think you've missed my distinction between cash and percentage GP, and just how important this is for restaurants and bars in the premium sector. It's a suggestion to explain one instance of cheapness versus another instance of expense using the knowledge I've developed dealing directly with brewers, wine makers, distillers. I am suggesting that low prices are not necessarily altruistic; I don't think smaller producers would charge less if they knew it would sell for more. There's no need to declare that what I've shared 'makes no sense'."
beer,3br1of,Litrebike,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:02:24 2015 UTC,Your suggestion doesn't make sense though. The sheer size of brewdog means their prices can be less than smaller producers. My point is that an increase in production scale has not lead to lower prices in this country so to expect lower prices over there would be unrealistic as there is no precedent for that when it comes to Brewdog.

beer,3bsubo,bobsforth,9,Wed Jul 1 21:32:57 2015 UTC,"I think it's arrogant. To me, it's a brewery saying ""You as a consumer must demonstrate your brand loyalty to us by buying this thing that is exactly like several other things you already own so you can only use it here.""   I live in California, where the law is really unclear. (Here's a resource for my fellow Californians.) Every brewery I go to reads the law differently, and whether they use it as an excuse to exclusively fill their own growlers factors into my impression of them. Some breweries won't even fill my DrinkTanks growler, which has no other brewery branding on it.   Shout-out to my favorite brewery, Drake's in San Leandro, which will fill anybody's growler -- they wrap it in black plastic wrap, put a Drake's sticker on it, and attach a card with the beer name, ABV, etc. It's great. It exemplifies the collaborative, open-minded spirit of craft beer, not exclusivity.  This is kind of a pet issue of mine because I really like growlers -- they're the greenest and freshest way to get beer, and what's better than bringing home your favorite from a new or local brewery? But I refuse to clog up my house and spend extra money on useless chunks of glass. It's ridiculous and wasteful.   We should all be as lucky as Oregon."
beer,3bsubo,Nonplussed2,2,Wed Jul 1 23:34:25 2015 UTC,"To be fair, until fairly recently, breweries were only allowed to fill growlers of their own, and had to be fully branded. Now, they are permitted to fill others, even blank ones, but they still have to cover up the other logo with one of their own. Even blank ones will need a logo put on it. And that could be a hassle for some breweries. Also, they have to pay for all those labels, which they don't charge for, to put over a growler that you paid another brewery for. Some are cool with that, many aren't.  And some may not really be aware of the law change."
beer,3bsubo,Skiceless,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:46:48 2015 UTC,"Agreed with all that. But honestly, how hard is it to charge an extra dollar for a label? And if you're not aware of very public changes to your industry, whose fault is that? I recognize that it's complicated, but I'm just not convinced that breweries don't use it as an excuse to say ""our growlers only."" And I think that's shitty business practice, so that's what I tell them (nicely, of course)."
beer,3bsubo,Nonplussed2,2,Thu Jul 9 16:02:35 2015 UTC,"I would bet that it's not an excuse to exclusively fill as much as it is a case of some breweries not wanting to flaunt the law and others not giving a shit.  We had the same issue in Minnesota. ""But XYZ brewery will fill any growler so it must be legal"". My response was always ""Not getting a speeding ticket doesn't make going 50 in school zone legal"""
beer,3bsubo,AdamLikesBeer,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:05:44 2015 UTC,"Yes I understand that breweries are being cautious. But many breweries around the state are openly filling other growlers every day with no trace of any kind of enforcement, and the ""growler clarification"" is available online:   ""Information required on the label:   Name and location of the manufacturer (city and state) and bottler (if different). Name of the beer in the container. Alcohol content is mandatory if 5.7% abv or greater. It is optional if below. Net contents of the container.""   All easily done.  Even with that, I've had several brewers tell me explicitly that the state ""doesn't allow us to fill other breweries' growlers."" Which is false. So yeah, I do consider it an excuse to be exclusive. Perhaps it's an ill-informed, conservative excuse, but still an excuse."

In states where it's not the law, I don't have a real problem with it. While the courtesy of filling any growler is nice, I can understand a brewery preferring to stick with their own.  Breweries near me will fill anything, but they make it so cheap to just buy one in-house that I usually just get one on site."

I get that you'd prefer for me to buy your branded growler, but as many have mentioned, that is verging on an unsustainable proposition.  I have 5-7ish breweries here that I often fill growlers from, and it can be nice to get a fill when traveling.  That can be a whole lot of growlers, and a whole lot of space, not to mention coordinating when to have one growler on-hand vs. another.

Or any PR firm at all? Particularly one that monitors conversations and jumps in to carefully deflect questions about the brewing process? If it's brewed same as beer, what's so proprietary about it, particularly if the backstory is that he cooked it up on his stove using a recipe from a 17th century cookbook? Notice he said it is ""brewed and fermented"" just like any other beer. Well so is Mike's Hard. At first. Then it's stripped nude and completely rebuilt into something else.  I'll keep a passive ear out in the future, but for now I still have a hard time believing this is anything other than the alcopop it appears to be, which is being marketed slickly through the appropriated lens of craft beer due to craft beer's surging market cachet, along with what smells totally like an invented mythology. It seems like they know if they admit it's just Mike's Hard Smirnoff Root Beer, that bubble of borrowed craft beer association would pop and they'd lose their cool factor along with the ready-made craft beer audience that is evangelizing it through its own channels for free. Such as right here.  Because if they didn't grassroots this thing nationwide through the craft beer community as they seem to have done, they'd have to Mike's Hard it on tv in a non-beer context to the Mike's Hard kinds of audiences. Pabst is the king of infiltrating an influential subculture to popularize a product grassroots stealth style on a low budget.   So far all the pieces suggest some smoke and mirrors.   As has been said here before, if people like root beer soda and want one that gets them drunk, it doesn't really matter what this thing is and they should just buy some. I'm just interested in the backstage mechanics of this product push. It really did happen out of nowhere. Critical mass coalesced out of nowhere and in a single week it was suddenly on everyone's tongue wherever I went. Beer forums, blogs, bars, the people at liquor stores, just blammo. Even the buzziest new darling craft beers or brewers don't happen that way. Obviously Pabst distro makes a huge difference but I also smell a planned assault by experienced stealth marketers with deep pockets, a scripted backstory, and a groomed public narrative, perhaps after stealth testing in its original local market."

beer,3bujuq,mugsoh,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:50:48 2015 UTC,Do you think they use a Belgian yeast strain in blue moon?  The most Belgian part of blue moon is the label.
beer,3bujuq,namelessbrewer,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:59:16 2015 UTC,I've never tried that. I'm still pretty new to beer. I'll try to get my hands on some soon.
beer,3bujuq,leakproofgrain,3,Thu Jul 2 07:27:34 2015 UTC,If Oberon isn't available near you look for Harpoon UFO White or UFO Hefeweizen
beer,3bujuq,TheBrewer,3,Thu Jul 2 11:11:50 2015 UTC,Blue Moon is far more true to style than Harpoon's UFO White (flavored with WONF) and Hefe (not really a hefe).  Hoegaarden and Allagash White are classic and widely available examples of a Wit.
beer,3bujuq,CBFisaRapist,0,Thu Jul 2 12:27:31 2015 UTC,"Bell's Oberon is the same style and flavor   Oberon is an American-style wheat, Blue Moon is a Belgian-style witbier. They're quite different. The main thing they have in common is that they both contain wheat. Otherwise, they're two separate styles with two separate sets of characteristics."
beer,3bujuq,Wblack2,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:47:50 2015 UTC,"In name, they're not the same. But they're pretty damn similar. The orange and wheat flavor dominate in both. Oberon is probably the most similar drinking beer to Blue Moon i've ever had."

beer,3bw8qg,kchouichomp,2,Thu Jul 2 18:36:42 2015 UTC,"You're not the first to ask this question here but I can't say I've ever seen a final or useful answer other than random guessing. Some people get headaches, some get nauseated, some get gut problems, etc. Sometimes it's from every beer, sometimes just hoppy ones, sometimes just other types, etc. It's hard to know if they've adequately ruled other things out or have more than an incident or two as their proof, and we never hear back from people if they ever go to their doctor about it.  As for hard liquor as an alternative, none of us can know what will or won't give you this reaction, so science says test it. Apparently true alcohol allergies are rare, and it's usually something else in a given alcoholic drink that's causing an allergic or otherwise weird reaction than the alcohol itself. So maybe hard liquor would work better for you, but let's put it to the test.   Go to the liquor store and get yourself a handful of mini airplane bottles of stuff that are always up by the cash register. Vodka, rum, bourbon/whiskey, and maybe tequila (skip the less identifiable stuff like cinnamon berry sparkle weird whatever spring break turbo vomit fuel). And make yourself some cocktails with cola, juice, club soda, tonic, lemon/lime, whatever works with a given liquor. Or just drink it on the rocks if you can stomach it - fewer variables that way but not worth it if it makes you green. See what happens.   If you get a headache, that's handy info because the culprit is probably just alcohol in general, assuming the other cocktail ingredients such as cola or juice or whatever don't otherwise give you a headache on their own. If you don't get a headache, that's also handy info because it means it's not alcohol in general.  If no headache, next try wine, a white first and next time a red. Sometimes there are deliberately sulfites in wine that give some people allergic reactions including headaches (and I think I read that sometimes they're in beer just as a byproduct of brewing), and sometimes there are histamines in wine that can do it. Get yourself a Chardonnay or Sauvignon Blanc or something for white, and then a Merlot or Cabernet Sauvignon or something for red. Nothing expensive at all for this test - I'm talking like $6 screwcap, but not down to gas station Boone's level, because I'm not sure if that's even actually wine. You can buy full sized bottles of whatever or those little fourpacks of Sutter Home mini bottles if that makes more sense or if they're cheaper. Don't drink both red and white in the same test run, since one might be problematic and the other not.  If still no headache, then barring less common types of alcohol as potential culprits, you can look back to beer. If this is an allergy issue, allergens in beer can be one or more of the main basic ingredients such as barley, wheat, rye, yeast, hops, etc. If you get a bad reaction from lots of different types of beer, maybe it's coming from one of those key ingredients that are in most beers.   I can't imagine continuing to test beers if you've tried a bunch of different types and are guaranteed a headache, but one final step could be being thorough about making sure you've tried a range of different styles: pilsner, wheat, pale ale, IPA, brown, porter, stout, bock, something Belgian-y, etc.   Maybe you could skip the styles you know you've already tested and just focus on some others by buying a build-your-own mixed sixpack of those styles. It doesn't sound promising given what you've said, but maybe you've tried fewer styles than you realize (for example Bud, Miller, Coors, Busch, Icehouse, Milwaukee anything, Pabst, etc. all pretty much count as the same lager style or close enough), and maybe there's a style out there for you.   For example lambics use hops in a different way than most beers - they used aged ones. What if that made a difference? One way to find out. To take it a step further, there's a rare style of beer called gruit, which is what basically all beer was until they started using hops. Beers would be bittered with things like marsh yarrow and other bitter herbs instead of hops. I think I read that gruits these days legally have to contain some amount of hops along with the weird stuff in order to be classed as beer, but I might have that wrong. Point being, there may be some gruits out there with a lot less hops than normal, or maybe none if I'm wrong about the law.  If beer doesn't work out for you, maybe give cider a try. It can often be found on tap and in bottles at bars these days, so it can be a handy alternative when you and the crew are out drinking pints and you don't want to be the obvious odd man out. Looks just like beer. It's also easy to find lots of them at your grocery store for home testing. Angry Orchard, Woodchuck, Crispin, Magners, Strongbow and more.  Good luck. Update us with a new post if you find any answers from your testing. We ought to start something in the sidebar since people so regularly ask but so neverly find answers. A Compendium Of Unexplained Beer-Related Maladies, we could call it. Maybe over time we'd find some patterns and keep augmenting it with whatever science/med knowledge is out there."

beer,3bsogt,turkeypants,3,Thu Jul 2 04:06:42 2015 UTC,"first, read /u/TakesJonToKnowJuan's guide to aging linked on the sidebar. Really read it.  It will tell you that almost all of those probably didn't benefit from aging. If you didn't have them fresh, you should definitely drink the beer fresh before trying to age it.   Anything that's not strong, 8+%, is almost certainly past its prime. Of those that are strong, you should drink at least one of the two soon to see if it's still any good.   Off the top of my head, the espresso stout and sweet potato beer are the only ones I'd think might hold up."
beer,3bsogt,TheMoneyOfArt,3,Wed Jul 1 21:07:00 2015 UTC,"You should drink every single one of them now.  There are only two or three beers in that entire pack that would hold up well after a year - the double latte, the imperial dark, maybe the Altbier or Scotch ale -  and even they are going to have degraded, not improved.  The coffee in the double latte, the sweet potatoes in the Scotch ale, the balancing bitterness in the imperial dark ... all that stuff is going to be faded. You're going to be drinking lesser beers.  There was no reason to stash this stuff away. Especially not two cases of it!"
beer,3bsogt,njbeerguy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:20:50 2015 UTC,Got it. Thank you for the tips. You said coffee flavors fade so would that mean i should also drink the bottle of Xocoveza i have?
beer,3bsogt,genderchangers,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:48:27 2015 UTC,Yes. Xocoveza fell off a cliff after a few months.
beer,3bsogt,njbeerguy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:55:14 2015 UTC,"Xocoveza was also made with peppers and spices, which is even more reason to drink sooner rather than later. Spice falls out of a beer fairly quick. So does fruit flavor.  Pepper heat will last a little longer, but except for ""extreme"" beers I haven't had many where the pepper flavor lasted much longer than a year. It can often fade in six or nine months.  Depending on how potent the coffee flavor is, you'll usually see it fade to the background within a year or two.  You should have your Xocoveza is right now."

beer,3bsogt,CBFisaRapist,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:24:48 2015 UTC,"I apologize in advance for being a bit of a dick, but why are you cellaring beers when by your own admission have no idea what to cellar and what not to cellar?  Why buy two cases of beer and store it away without really knowing whether or not it's a good idea, especially when fully half or more of the beers in those packs are terrible to cellar, and even the ones that might stand up okay are still best had fresh?  Just about every single one of those beers should have been drank a year ago. Almost every last one of them.  If you don't understand what you're doing and why when it comes to cellaring beer, you're only accomplishing one thing by stashing away random bottles: building yourself a ""collection"" of beer that is half as good as it should be or worse.  Stop doing this, people. It's ridiculous, and judging by the number of ""should I drink this nor or wait?"" posts that get made here these days, people are doing it all the time. Beer isn't a collectible, it's a drink. If you don't know whether or not a beer is good to stash away, don't.  And I'm saying this as a guy with an extensive cellar who has been laying down beers for 20+ years.  There is laying down beers with a purpose and doing it just for the sake of doing it. Doing the former can be highly rewarding. Doing the latter is almost always a waste."
beer,3bsogt,CBFisaRapist,2,Wed Jul 1 21:11:24 2015 UTC,"i had recently turned 21 and was still learning. I didn't do it as an attempt to steal beers away from those more deserving than i or to impress my friends, most of whom don't really stray from Sam Adams or Shiner. Honestly i was waiting for an opportunity to share it with some friends who'd appreciate it but i never really found a time and now i have some year old beer. I realize my ignorance is showing but i just want to cut my losses and drink the ones that aren't doing me any good in storage. So if you don't mind me asking which ones specially do you think would age well?"
beer,3bsogt,CBFisaRapist,2,Wed Jul 1 21:30:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think any would age well, except maybe the imperial dark ale. There's a shot that one will mature in an interesting way with time. I'd suggesting drinking one now, and if you want to experiment, let the other sit for two or three more years at most.  I think you're still safe on the altbier, Scottish ale, coffee stout, and the rye bock. By ""safe"" I mean they'll still be drinkable and tasty right now. However, they're only going downhill from here, so don't wait too long. Drink them before the end of the year.  The rest of them, I'd call up some friends ASAP and taste your way through them. A few, like the Chico pale ale and the India pale lager, aren't going to be very good at all anymore. The others will still be drinkable, but they'll be a shadow of what they were.  As a side note, props to you for admitting to some ignorance. There is NOTHING wrong with ignorance, only with an unwillingness to learn -- which you clearly don't have to worry about.  Chalk it up to a lesson learned. No big deal, that. We've all beer there.  Now go grab your glass and start sampling those beers!"

In 2010, I turned 21 and he surprised me with 2 bottles that he had been saving for a special occassion. They. Were. Delicious.   Obviously, this does not translate to every beer type, but Lagunitas tends to keep their beer is darker bottles to help prevent ""skunking"". The only way to know is to try one.

beer,3bnisu,League-TMS,9,Tue Jun 30 17:19:18 2015 UTC,"An outsiders perspective on beer in Brussels.  I was fortunate enough to make it to Brussels earlier this year. Lots of touristy venues that play the beer destination card, but there are also some gems. Here's what I found:  Cantillion - If you only go to one place in Brussels, go here. The brewery has been around since the early 1900's. Self guided tour with tasting flight at the end. Best beer bargain on the earth. I brought home 9 750s at less than 7 euros each.  Délices et Caprices - Just a few block from the Gallery and the rest of the more tourist oriented locations, this place is a must visit spot. Unlike anything in the vicinity the prices are reasonable and the owner (who, from what I've heard, is almost always there) is passionate about Belgian beer. I can't thank Pierre more for spending the time talking beer to me and my beer drinking colleagues (and letting us sample the young regional lambics). If you only go to two place in Brussels, go here and Cantillion.   Delirium Cafe - Loud. Think college/young professional hang out. Beer selection was great, but as an older fart, I felt out of place. Worth a visit.  Le Poechenellekelder - This was mentioned in the story. Despite the location, pretty laid back. Food and beer selection were both very good. Can't remember the food, but I drank 3 Fonteinen geuze. Reasonably priced, tasty food. Cash only, if I recall. Worth a visit.  Moeder Lambic Fontainas  - Europe meets left coast. Great selection, decent food. A bit of a walk from central city, but close enough. If you have 2 days, you should consider checking it out.  These were the highlights of my trip. I found the areas close to the center of the city to be a bit touristy and pricey. If you're looking for Westveltetern (8 or 12), and you can't arrange a trip to Vleteren, I found that the most reasonable place was Au Bon Vieux Temps (12 euros for a bottle of 12, about 6 euros less than anywhere else). A cool place, nonetheless."

Bombers are generally a terrible value and I wish more beers would come in 4-6 packs.  That said, to answer your question, ABV is in fact one of the many factors I consider when deciding to purchase a more expensive than usual beer.  What is more expensive than usual?  Anything that is more $ per ounce than a $12 six pack is expensive, IMO.  But anything that is more $ per ounce than a $15 six pack is one I'm gonna have to think hard about before spending my money.  The factors, IMO, are how much did it cost the brewer to make the beer, how rare is the beer, and how unique is the beer.    Brewer expense is kind of a catch all, it includes expensive adjuncts, excessive hopping, barrel aging, long term aging (like sours), and yes abv because higher abv means more fermentables means more cost to the brewer.  If the beer is unusually expensive for me to buy but it doesn't seem like it should be unusually expensive for the brewer to make I'm probably not buying it unless it meets the other two criterion.  This is why I very rarely come home with Ballast Point Sculpin, despite it being a fantastic beer.  I can't justify it being $4 more for a six pack over something like Two Hearted (which I prefer anyways).  Rarity is pretty self explanatory - it sucks but supply and demand is definitely a thing.  If there isn't much of it out there the brewer can get away with jacking up the price, and I don't really fault them.  The craft beer industry is not a charity industry.  That said, it does sometimes seem like rarity is artificially generated.  Regardless, if it's super rare and hyped, well I'm a sucker and I'll probably buy it at least once if I've never had it.  It better be damn good if I'm gonna buy it and seek it out a second time, though.  Uniqueness is kinda  a subset of rarity.  If it's unlike anything else on the market, the brewer can probably get away with bigger markups.  But in order to make it unique they probably require some expensive adjuncts and processes anyways, so costs are probably increased to begin with.  If two beers are the same price and different ABV, ABV probably has little to no impact on my decision of which to buy.  It's more just about which beer do I prefer.  In fairness, I do tend to prefer the bigger beers because they generally (certainly not always) tend to be more flavorful and complex.  But sometimes I'm also in the mood for a sessionable pale ale or gose too.  I don't think I can give you a perfect ABV range, I don't think anyone can honestly.  I guess if you force me to pick one ABV to drink for the rest of my life it would probably be around 7%.  Low enough to be able to drink a few without getting silly, but high enough to include a lot of the bolder IPAs and stouts of the world."
beer,3bo73g,evarigan1,3,Tue Jun 30 20:41:03 2015 UTC,"Well said! I've thought about (and read about) the whole abv vs price thing before... and you summed it up perfectly.  What got me re-thinking the abv issue is I brewed an evil twin bikini beer clone - from a kit (brooklyn brew - someone bought it for me as a gift) and it's a 2.7% ""IPA"" beer.  I was expecting it to taste like beer flavored water. But it was really flavorful and delicious. I've never had the actual beer. And one of the reasons is the price vs abv.  It's a little silly to think that way, but I can't help it.  Interesting to hear others take on this."
beer,3bo73g,Vertigo666,3,Tue Jun 30 20:55:03 2015 UTC,"Bikini Beer is incredibly flavorful for being as low abv as it is, I was surprised at how tasty and non-watery it actually was."
beer,3bo73g,natemc,11,Wed Jul 1 05:01:17 2015 UTC,"ABV is the last thing I care about these days. I just want a good tasting beer no matter the price or alcohol content, I actually hate getting drunk but love drinking beer."
beer,3bo73g,sjhalestorm,2,Tue Jun 30 20:41:02 2015 UTC,"I actually hate getting drunk but love drinking beer.   Right on. If I were drinking to get drunk, I would do it with much cheaper beer... or a bottle of bourbon."
beer,3bo73g,jpaventi13219,4,Tue Jun 30 21:00:04 2015 UTC,"Moderately. I can understand why I'm paying more for Allagash Curieux or Founders' bastard beers. If I'm spending, say, $10+ on a low octane bomber, I want to know that it's a quality offering.  I drink a lot of session beer because I'm a fast drinker and I don't like ending my evening early. Give me a Founders All Day IPA any day.  6%"
beer,3bo73g,jpaventi13219,2,Tue Jun 30 20:22:08 2015 UTC,If you are spending $10+ on a bomber that's 10% abv would you be less concerned about it being a quality offering?  edit: and yes founders all day IPA is indeed delicious. great at a summertime baseball game. play ball!
beer,3bo73g,jbramley,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:31:35 2015 UTC,"If I'm spending $10 on a bomber that is 10% abv, I am probably doing so because I trust the brewery's reputation. Places like Founders, DFH and Allagash have earned that. For others, I would see what people I trust think or try some of their other work before taking the plunge."

beer,3bo73g,turkeypants,2,Tue Jun 30 20:30:12 2015 UTC,"ABV itself and price are unrelated to me, but that said I'm not going to shell out $12 on a sixpack that I plan to drink in an afternoon. Is Stone Go To good? In my opinion it is, but I'm much more inclined to grab a 6er of something cheaper like Harpoon, Mayflower, or one of the other less expensive local brews.   When I'm just enjoying a good beer at home though, yeah, if its a beer I know I like or I'm willing to roll the dice on I'll buy a $10-13 bomber of 5%"
beer,3bo73g,Radjage,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:53:19 2015 UTC,"I regularly buy bombers of Hottenroth (3.1%) and they run $10-12 near me. I don't worry much about the low ABV.  One of my favorite session beers is Boat Beer (4.2%). It runs $10 for a four-pack of 16oz cans. It's a little pricey for a session beer, but I love it.  Whether I buy, say, Stone session over the regular IPA depends on my intentions.  Mostly, I don't pay attention to ABV when I'm buying, only when I'm drinking."
beer,3bo73g,DarthMaillard,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:00:32 2015 UTC,"I like a nice relaxed feeling from having a couple beers, but I'm not really looking to get drunk in the most efficient way possible these days. I really enjoy just exploring all the different things brewers can do with beer. So if it's 4% or 14%, what I'm looking for is a well composed, enjoyable, interesting, and hopefully complex and distinctive beer.   I don't have a minimum or a maximum but I do find that it seems to be harder to make a beer that really delivers the taste and feel I want at lower ABVs, though they sometimes win points for a clean taste/feeling. Stone Levitation was the first one I tried that I felt really delivered on taste at low ABV.   The ones that resonate most memorably with me do tend to be upwards of 6% and really more up around 8ish or higher. When I first had a high gravity beer a decade ago, I remember being so put off by the alcohol taste, feeling it dominated and ruined the rest of the beer. I never taste that anymore - it just seems to play nicely as a component part. I think the highest I've had was something like 15 or 16 and it wasn't really about the alcohol. Put another way, I don't really care what the ABV is, but the beers I like best just more often wind up being ones that are higher.  I guess if I were designing a lifer I'd say 7.5-8%. Enough to have some ass on it but not so much that you get stonkered really quick."
beer,3bo73g,Vertigo666,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:17:10 2015 UTC,"When I was making less money, I had to be frugal with my beer and would only tend to heavier beers with a good abv as they were most of the time a better value. I would never ever spend 10 or more on a sixer of anything around only 5%. This led to me really like stuff like triples and IPAs.  Now, however, I drink less to get buzzed and more for the beer itself, so I'm all over the place. It's still a big consideration, but now I'll throw down a bunch to try 4% sours and the like or any beer I find creative. That said I still never buy bombers, horrible value there.  If I could only drink one beer forever it'd probably be something 6% and tasty like dogfish had 60 minute."
beer,3bn46q,MOOzikmktr,3,Tue Jun 30 15:35:57 2015 UTC,"Maltose Falcons in Los Angeles were founded in 1974 and recognized as the oldest. Daught Board in the SF Bay Area was founded soon after and is generally recognized as the second oldest. I would have to look through some books at home, but it's a fair assumption that a few clubs sprung up in the intervening nine years."
beer,3bn46q,fractalsoflife,2,Tue Jun 30 21:38:27 2015 UTC,"Maybe, when I was a Bier Meisters member we looked into the relative age of our club and competition and found 1 and 2 that were older, respectively.  There is no comprehensive data anywhere which is why we also qualified those claims and the qualification was included in the printed article.  Two of the founding members, Jackie and Alberta Rager also own one of the oldest homebrew shops in the country and are both significant figures in the modern history of homebrewing in the US. Boulevard founder John McDonald was an early member. It is a club with a cool history (including homebrew club of the year in 2000 IIRC). Since KCBM won club of the year, DOZE is the only other club to win it with entries from a single region. The other three clubs to have won in that period are QUAFF (Jamil was out of region), SPHBC (Gordon was out of region), and The Brewing Network (no region). Since the notion of entering the region you live in is no longer a thing it almost certainly will never happen again."

beer,3bn46q,prophetsavant,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:45:01 2015 UTC,"FWIW, this was all well before my time. I was a member around 2009-2013  Boulevard I believe first sold beer in 85 but I think John had that building at least in 84 so he might have basically been opening his brewery as the club was founded. It stands to reason he did some sort of homebrewing of pilot beers and he would have been customer at the Ragers' store since there obviously were not many homebrew shops around back then.  Some of the people involved in Free State were members as well.  If you are interested in the history of KC beer it might be worth a Friday evening to drop by a Bier Meisters meeting (or to Bacchus and Barleycorn to talk to Alberta Rager). There are several very long time members who are still active in the club, including the first club president. In those days there was a limited commercial scene and homebrew scene and they were more intimately tied than they are today."

When I talked to the people at Tower they didn't seem to even be aware of the beer, and when the guy checked the inventory on his computer, it showed they didn't even order it last year even though I bought some of last years release from that same location.

I like how craft brewers are transparent about their process and ingredients, in general. I have a feeling that Not Your Father's is full of extracts and adjuncts. It is a glorified malt beverage and it should not be marketed as a craft beer.   Call it a craft beverage if you want.

Two were created by restaurant owners who hired a brewer and fail to give them support because it's a restaurant and the beer is a marketing gimmick. The other doesn't brew anything... they contract it out of Wisconsin.  There's nothing really wrong with either of those methods, but ""Craft Beer"" or ""______ & Brewery"" have become such powerful marketing terms that people who have no interest in the craft beer community or being transparent are getting in on the action.

What makes those terms desirable, let alone superior? They're nice buzzwords, but they don't inherently mean anything when it comes to the end product (and they certainly don't qualify/disqualify a place as a craft brewery). If anything, as evidenced by this very thread, such buzzwords lend themselves to the sort of deceptive marketing you seem to be rallying against.  If you're going to shit on restaurants jumping aboard the craft beer train, you should direct your ire towards places like Arriba and Lucille's that are explicitly cashing in on the concept of 'house brews'.  I'll agree that Bad Water is aptly named, but your critique of the other two seems misguided."
beer,3bhwzz,holemole,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:29:54 2015 UTC,"To dive a little deeper, I think Mother Bunch is on their 3rd (maybe 4th) brewer since opening less than a year ago. The owner simply hasn't given brewers the support or facilities to produce a quality product, so the brewer leaves. I don't know if the brewers have been good, bad, or otherwise (heard a bit of both), but the focus is on the food and running a restaurant, not beer. Sure, it's a ""craft brewery"" because they brew beer, but a consumer cares (and you should too) because that location will be the first introduction to craft beer for some people. They 100% succeed at quality food and quality experience... But fail to deliver on beer. Those who are introduced that way or give it a second chance are going to assume that is the pinnacle of beer and walk away, taking a customer away from somebody focused on providing quality beer.   But this isn't about one specific place, that's just an example - one that may likely turn it around at some point. It hurts the market for everybody if somebody claiming to brew local craft beer fails expectations. And a marketing experiment is likely to fail a quality test. When terms are abused for marketing purposes, the entire market sinks with the diminishing returns of the marketing term. I happen to work in marketing and I've worked on sinking ships that were relying on a hot marketing term to sell a sub-standard product.   So you're right, there's nothing inherently wrong with the beer produced by a business operation or inherently quality about a brewer-owned brewery. But I'm not using ""brewer/family-owned, beer-first, hard-working, brewer-driven"" as marketing terms. A brewer who cares about brewing and calls his/her own shots will spend more money on ingredients, dump bad product (eat the cost), and stake their reputation on quality beer. A restaurant owner who cares about food will spend more money on a chef, quality food ingredients, and less money on a brewer, brewing equipment and brewing ingredients.   A last word about MB - I don't mean to critique them, I enjoy going there. They have a wonderful, almost all local tap list at any given moment, and the food is absolutely top notch. But they're cashing in on a trend, and poorly representing craft beer by selling the concept of a craft brewery. If craft beer becomes an evil term, they'll simply wipe it off the door and keep selling sandwiches happily. It's smart business."
beer,3bhwzz,sjhalestorm,2,Tue Jun 30 01:21:09 2015 UTC,"It is interesting to know that Mother Bunch has gone through multiple brewers. I had several beers there, two of which were forgettable and two were awful beers and over thought (A gose that had an extremely cheesy scent, and a shepherd's pie beer.)

A bit hyperbolic, don't you think? Few people are going to try something and assume it's indicative of everything - and those who do likely aren't all that interested in the first place. I abhorred my first beer, but I certainly wasn't naive enough to write beer off altogether.   A brewer who cares about brewing and calls his/her own shots will spend more money on ingredients, dump bad product (eat the cost), and stake their reputation on quality beer.   I agree with this, but I'm not sure you can rag on Mother Bunch for this (first I've heard of it, but I'll take your word), all the while touting a place like Dubina. While they were been pretty open about it, they've still served at least a few batches of beer that definitely should've been dumped. (They're not alone, either - well-established places like Fate and Arizona Wilderness had some early batches that were pretty foul and had no business flowing from the taps)   But they're cashing in on a trend, and poorly representing craft beer by selling the concept of a craft brewery.   Surely you're joking. They aren't selling a concept - by every definition I've ever heard, they're an actual craft brewery. I admire how much you seem to care about the local community, and I certainly share that enthusiasm, but unless I somehow skimmed over news of their acquisition by InBev, or the mash tun and fermenters on-site are just for show, it's pretty unfair to throw Mother Bunch under this bus.  Is the beer at Mother Bunch world-class? Probably not - but how many local places can honestly answer otherwise? Strictly as a matter of convenience, I've taken countless clients, friends, and family members out there for food and drinks, and not a single person has expressed any sort of displeasure with the place. Granted, to my knowledge none of them are certified Cicerones, but give or take a thousandth of a percent, neither is the general population.  Your issues with Mother Bunch seem to boil down to ""they aren't doing things the way I think they should"", which, while certainly a valid complaint, rests entirely on your shoulders."
beer,3bhwzz,holemole,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:09:23 2015 UTC,"or the mash tun and fermenters on-site are just for show,   They were for the first bunch of months... It's why the first brewer left. The owner wouldn't front any cash to get the actual brewing system operating, so the brewer was using a homebrew system. They've fixed that issue, but it's a good example of the priorities of a restauranteur compared to a brewer. What do you think happens when the brewer asks for cases of fresh fruit or hops with rising prices?   A bit hyperbolic, don't you think?   Probably a little over dramatic, but not altogether untrue. There's a huge group of people who have been told ""craft beer is so much better"" and ""craft beer is totally worth the higher price,"" so they're dragged out to a place to give it a try and walk away thinking it's hipster hype. Their perception is confirmed - overpriced and nothing special. Ammo for the next argument against going out to a brewery or craft beer bar.    they've still served at least a few batches of beer that definitely should've been dumped.    Nobody is batting a thousand, but Dubina specifically, has dumped batches. They've made mistakes in the brewing process. But they'll also call in somebody for a taste test if they're not sure if it's sellable. They had a gose that needed to be dumped, so it got dumped (maybe a week or so too late). Their barleywine didn't turn out as planned, but it sold like hot cakes, so they put a disclaimer that it wasn't true to style on the menu and rode it out (so many people loved it). 8-Bit wrote a business plan that included financing for two batches for purely testing purposes - no intention of selling, only dumping - to make sure that they were delivering on quality. Quality-wise, I would bet Wilderness would agree they've sold some things that didn't turn out as well as they wanted (coughberlinercough), but at least they're doing it their way and innovating (easy to forget they've done a lot of things in this desert that nobody else would try) rather than having a boss (potentially) limiting their ingredients and requiring them to sell something they're not proud of.    I've taken countless clients, friends, and family members out there for food and drinks, and not a single person has expressed any sort of displeasure with the place.   I'm with you. I love going there. I take out of towners there. I recommend it to people coming to Arizona (if you look far enough back in my history, you'll see it here on Reddit). I just generally include the disclaimer to stay away from their beer. It functions as a great restaurant and bar, doing the bare minimum to be called a brewery.   Again, it's not really about MB. Overall, it's an authenticity thing. As any product/market/hobby/anything becomes popular, authenticity decreases and brands get to the bandwagon (how much crap says ""gluten free"" these days?). Referencing OP - Small Town Brewing seems to have traded in some authenticity for cash/distribution, and ""Craft Beer"" will continue to lose meaning (how craft is Sam Adams now? Sierra Nevada? Lagunitas? Good Island? All still OGs worthy of respect, but so large that they have to battle for that hands-on craft clout). Some incredible brewers will become disenfranchised by the community and become less transparent too, but hopefully their product retains an authenticity.   Also, certainly not trying to argue and hope you haven't taken anything as an argument - simply a fair discussion."
beer,3bhwzz,sjhalestorm,2,Tue Jun 30 04:14:35 2015 UTC,"Sierra Nevada and Lagunitas do not belong in that list.  Sierra Nevada is as a craft beer, as authentic, as brewer-focused, family-owned as it gets.  Just because Ken Grossman's company has been around since the very beginning of the craft beer movement in America and has grown to be one of the largest has nothing to do with its ""hands-on"" craftness.  (I avoided craftiness because of the craft vs crafty thing.)  If anything, Sierra Nevada's size and success has made it MORE hands-on.  They grow their own raw materials, they do some of the coolest science projects a craft brewer would do.  Macrobrewers see hops as a commodity products providing alpha acid.  Sierra Nevada has a GCMS with a sniff-port to analyze hops for their aroma characteristics and allow their brewers to become familiar with specific odor compounds in hops.  I get your point about battling for craft clout from places like Sam Adams which contract brews a large amount of their brand, or Goose Island which is now wholly owned by AB-InBev.  But SN and Lagunitas do not belong in that list.  I say this as a homebrewer of 16 years who turned pro 6 years ago.  I am in awe of what Ken Grossman has done with his brewery, and what he has done for the craft beer community.  He certainly has grown, but in every way that growth has been all brewer/family-owned, beer-first, hard-working, brewer-driven!  That said, I've enjoyed reading the rest of your posts, just wanted to make sure that it was clear that SN does not have to battle for craft clout, they define it."

This Reddit thread at least sources its claims much better than the article, and it doesn't give the same impressions about the brewery at all.  Is Small Town contracting through City Brewery in La Crosse, WI (owned by Pabst) and using their distribution networks? Obviously, at this point. Are they a deceptive trojan horse product from Four Loko? I won't deny it's possible, but I sure as shit haven't seen conclusive evidence yet.  One thing I will gripe about is this supposed 1600's recipe book they're always going on about, like he keeps it on his desk and flips through occasionally for recipes. A document that old would be extremely delicate and I doubt it would have survived intact in some attic for the brewer's grandma to just give it to him one day (like they claim). Not to mention, brewing from that period was very different from the types of beers produced today. Some or all of that recipe book stuff is bullshit."

They can spend millions on new equipment to meet a larger demand that may or may not be used  or  They can hire a company that already has the capacity to make excess while they ramp up the finances to build a new brewery or offers flexibility to make new product lines without a massive capitol investment.  Sam Adams doesnt brew any of its Octoberfest beer in a Sam Adams brewery and most of the Boston Lager you see is actually made in LaTrobe PA in the brewery that used to make Rolling Rock (Actually owned by City Brewing now). Many medium breweries will do this with an established large volume brew, so they can focus on the small batch/craft stuff at the home brewery.  There is no Pabst brewery anywhere for PBR...its all Miller Coors contract.  On the other side of the coin, New Glarus in Wisconsin is one of the top 25 producing Craft Brewers and onloy seels in Wisconsin, because they wont contract out their brewing and dont want to invest in a new or expanded brewery just to go regional. The small scale makes them almost legendary.  The same thing happens in whiskey, actually...If you drink any Rye whiskey, chances are it was made a factory in Indiana and shipped for aging at ""craft Distillers"" that simply dont have the resources to make rye, but do the barrel aging while the distillery focuses on core bourbon or whatever."

Hear me out on this. What you've linked to definitely shows a relationship between Pabst and Four Loko for at least distribution and contract brewing, but that was already known and no one's disputing that. You'll notice, though, the privacy policy that you listed deals primarily with web content and distribution matters, so all that shows is what we already know they have a hand in.  The whois page, to me, gives the same impression about web content and distribution services but does not confirm ownership (even then, would this mean that Pabst owns it, or Four Loko?)  The trademark by Innovative is definitely the most persuasive evidence you have there, but I have an honest question about that: Does ownership of the trademark (which could refer to nothing more than the web design and logo, though I'm not an expert) indicate ownership of the entire brand, the recipe, production, and everything else associated with Small Town? Or is it, once again, just part of their distribution and marketing services that we already know they are providing?

beer,3bhwzz,Messiah,-1,Mon Jun 29 18:01:08 2015 UTC,Making whiskey that's artificially flavored and colored is a bit different. That's blatantly cutting corners to make an inferior product. I imagine at some point they're going to be able to perfectly synthesize whiskey at which point I don't really care where it comes from.  This could very well be a malt beverage that they artificially flavor. Which really isn't that different from regular root beer so it doesn't upset me that much.

beer,3bhwzz,lbcsax,0,Mon Jun 29 18:31:29 2015 UTC,"Making whiskey is taking distilled alcohol and then aging it in barrels. The real issue isn't that they're using stock grain alcohol, it's the fact they're just adding chemicals to it and taking a massive shortcut. I think eventually they're going to be able to replicate barrel aging with chemical additives but right now I don't think they're close. If you can make a product that is chemically identical, the only thing that really differentiates it is the creation narrative of distilling it in small pots and then barrel aging it versus taking a stock alcohol and adding stuff to it in a factory.    Obviously there is a lot of at best ""creative marketing"" and at worst straight up misinformation going on with that Templeton Rye. I think their marketing is a bunch of crap, but it's mainly because we've put such a high value on artisinal creation methods that make us feel really good about our products. I've never had the whiskey, but I can't imagine it's that good and that really should speak for itself."

There's just a foreboding ""artificial flavors"" on the label, which also kind of sucks. Craft brewers tend to talk about what goes in their brews, but they don't necessarily have to.

This is an unfortunate accident but pushing off the responsibility to the alcohol is not right, people fucked up in the decisions they made to drink and drive and sell barely teens booze and got someone killed.

beer,3bgql3,TundraWolf_,21,Mon Jun 29 02:05:44 2015 UTC,"Vacuum the coils on all your fridges.  Mine seems to be deliberately constructed to make this hard to do, so I have to run a thing that looks like a giant bottle brush through the coils then vacuum up the debris."
beer,3bgql3,JimmyHavok,9,Mon Jun 29 03:08:45 2015 UTC,"The fridge is designed in this way for maximum efficiency in an otherwise inefficient system.  I used to work in A/C and electrical repair so I have disassembled a fair number of fridge and cooler units.    Your fridge and any cooling device is going to operate by compressing a substance (Freon, ammonia, etc.) to a high pressure, sending it through a tube where it will be expelled through an orifice to a lower pressure tube that feeds back to the compressor.  Now because we know physics, anytime you compress ganything or just go from lower pressure to higher pressure, temperature follows a scale and will increase accordingly.  At times, the coils on a A/C's compressor unit or the external coils of a deep freeze will get so hot they can burn you.    This is the reason for the coils in the first place - the engineers figured out that it is a great way to improve the function of the system by adding in coils, fins and other means of dispelling that heat.  As you increase pressure (compressor unit) but can remove heat, the cold part (condensing unit) can function that much better and will actually make it cold very fast.  In college in Texas during the summer I would run a water sprinkler over the coils of the outside unit to help it drop that heat from compression.  By doing this, I was able to effectively change the internal temp of my house to the 60-65 F range in a matter of hours.  Your A/C unit is actually just a heat exchanger, exchanging the heat from inside your house to outside.  Anyway, because the engineers decided your fridge needed all the coils to get rid of heat, they had to add surface area.  And when you add that much surface area with restricted airflow, you get a buildup of particulates, namely dust, hair and dirt.  This is what happens to your fridge/freezer.  This also happens to your A/C unit.  The more dust and dirt they have, the less efficient it runs and it could potentially 'freeze up' - where it is trying to run to cool things down but just becomes unable to.  To fix this, we call in a repair tech and clean the coils to return proper airflow.  As you said, it is deliberately constructed this way, but not to catch dirt but rather get rid of heat to help cool your beer and you down."
beer,3bgql3,AgITGuy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:35:15 2015 UTC,"The problem is the orientation of the coils. They are set so that the zigzags go front to back, and block entry of a vacuum cleaner hose. If they were set 90 degrees from where they are, the hose could go between the zigzags and cleaning would be trivial."
beer,3bgql3,JimmyHavok,2,Mon Jun 29 19:41:41 2015 UTC,"Yup I used to deliver appliances and one of the biggest reasons that refrigerators go out is due to dust and especially dog/cat hair buildup around the coils. The heat can't dissipate efficiently and the condenser has to work much harder. I've seen many scorched wood floors and melted laminate because the coils get so hot. If your fridge can't maintain temperatures clean off the coils and give it a day. This will often fix the problem. People complain modern refrigerators don't last as long, but it's mainly because old refrigerators had the coils on the back where they collected less dust and got more air flow. Modern refigerators have the coils underneath and simply vacuuming out the coils 1 or 2 times a year will extend the life of of your fridge by many years."
beer,3bgql3,Colonial_Morphology,6,Mon Jun 29 14:22:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's funny I noticed my fridge that's about 25 years old was running constantly. Then one day I had it pulled away from the wall to vacuum back there and noticed the build up of 25 years of dust and shit. Damn fridge works like new now.   Also tangently related, I spilled about 2 gallons of helles in my keezer about a two or three months ago. I cleaned it out with just a hose. The keezer dosent have any moisture control and last week had a little water accumulating at the bottom. It started smelling funny and I investigated down there and discovered fucking mold everywhere. Had to quickie-wipe the whole thing."

He proceeds to open the fan, pulls out the the filters and OMG they were thick and full of crap!  After he cleaned it out the AC is now freaking cold!

beer,3bl2wk,theguyfromharlem,0,Tue Jun 30 02:46:52 2015 UTC,The only thing special about it was that it was there. I paid 16 bucks for a 4pack of KBS before but this just seemed a little crazy.
beer,3bl2wk,huntimir151,-1,Tue Jun 30 02:52:46 2015 UTC,$4 a bottle for KBS isn't unreasonable.  But $9 seems excessive.  I assume it was a 12 oz bottle?
beer,3bl2wk,theguyfromharlem,2,Tue Jun 30 03:20:17 2015 UTC,"In AZ, KBS was going for $39.99 a 4 pack."
beer,3bl2wk,timeforbanner18,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:15:40 2015 UTC,"I was gonna say, 16 bucks!? I payed frigging 28 in florida."
beer,3bl2wk,sube_fresh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:23:37 2015 UTC,Yeah one place had them for $22.99 but always quickly sold out. $39.99 was just the highest I saw.
beer,3blnhd,retsoced,3,Tue Jun 30 05:45:17 2015 UTC,Hop Hands has been the name of a beer for several years now.
beer,3blnhd,nickman611,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:31:29 2015 UTC,"Yup, and a good beer at that. But what ISNT already the name of a beer? I think the word ""hop"" and all it's derivatives has been exhausted."
beer,3bi4a8,Jagator,2,Mon Jun 29 12:20:10 2015 UTC,They'd be great for small batch home brew...or for blasting to pieces in your yard.
beer,3bkcap,chopkin5,0,Mon Jun 29 22:44:48 2015 UTC,"It might not be made anymore, even if some random store carried it. Try contacting Heineken"

beer,3bftco,mbpharmd,2,Mon Jun 29 00:11:04 2015 UTC,"I've been partial to the 12 pack Centennial IPA lately. Delicious, higher ABV and IBU than the All Day, and still under $20. The 3 extra cans you get with the All Day is nice though."
beer,3bftco,amcdermott20,28,Mon Jun 29 18:38:47 2015 UTC,Dale's Pale Ale. Damn good beer. $8.00/6-pack at the grocery store around the corner.
beer,3bftco,Ben_Towle,55,Mon Jun 29 00:57:49 2015 UTC,"I like to keep Two Hearted around, or Founders All-Day if I want more volume. That said, I always like to have something in my fridge that I've never tried before, so I can have something new whenever I want."

beer,3bftco,tyme,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:54:41 2015 UTC,Is it also brewed in Ohio? I only knew the original and the one in Tampa.

beer,3bftco,yodaboy64,2,Mon Jun 29 08:03:18 2015 UTC,They don't distribute any further west than Indiana as far as I know.  I moved to Missouri from Pennsylvania last summer and am always missing Yuengling.
beer,3bftco,fractuss,3,Mon Jun 29 11:09:41 2015 UTC,Can confirm. In Texas.  It makes me very sad.
beer,3bftco,paturner2012,6,Mon Jun 29 13:07:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this: Especially for the price, it's good beer - you can pick up a crate for $15 at Hannaford in NY and it's better than most macrobrews. Definitely my table beer of choice."

beer,3bftco,VusterJones,3,Mon Jun 29 13:35:44 2015 UTC,This or Chesterfield Ale. Not a bad cheap ale that's a great go to can beer. Brewed by Yuengling and I usually alternate between this or Yuengling as my go to canned beers while obviously having about 300 bottles of victory brewing of some sort throughout my house

beer,3bftco,nicholka,2,Mon Jun 29 03:51:03 2015 UTC,"I'm a beer snob; I admit it. I also work in a craft brewery, but coors banquet is so fucking smooth. It's either that, Labatt or Yuengling."
beer,3bftco,davethebrewer,2,Mon Jun 29 04:38:40 2015 UTC,It's so fucking amazing right off the line. I drank a bunch when I toured the plant. It's ridiculous how tasty it is. Easily the most memorable glass of beer ever. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.
beer,3bftco,Lizardking13,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:04:55 2015 UTC,"I've been drinking it for a few summers now as an alternative to my usual Mexican beers.  The 16oz cans are great.  Larger size as 12oz goes down a little too fast.  Wide mouth, less turbulence causing burps.   Wet finish with apple and banana notes.  Great around the pool and in the river.  Just nice and refreshing in a wonderful form factor.  There is even a lid to put over it when outside.  Makes sure bugs and other flying stuff doesn't get in."
beer,3bftco,davethebrewer,6,Mon Jun 29 02:17:10 2015 UTC,Fat Tire. It's the beer I associate most with where I grew up and for me amber ales are flexible enough to be enjoyed year round.
beer,3bftco,SteamboatWillie,2,Mon Jun 29 02:13:17 2015 UTC,I love Fat Tire! But I've found I'm more prone to headaches with Fat Tire compared to other brews. Maybe it's just me? Still one of my favorites though.

It's a decent inexpensive beer, so yeah.  Don't get me wrong though, I'm still a beer snob! lol I keep a fair amount of homebrew on hand. Right now, I have my own APA in my fridge, and am getting ready to bottle a original recipe titled ""Tropic Thunder,"" which is a tropical lager-style ale with a bunch of citrus thrown in since it's summer and that seemed like a good idea."
beer,3bftco,dmoreau,3,Mon Jun 29 03:01:50 2015 UTC,So with you on this. I love Bud Heavy as my go-to non craft brew.
beer,3bftco,Seatowndawgtown,2,Mon Jun 29 16:15:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  I'm right there with you. Miller Lite or Corona. Nothing special. It's cheap and gets the job done on a hot summer day.   That, and a few limes."
beer,3bftco,paladinkyle,2,Mon Jun 29 03:21:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly! I mean, I love a good craft beer, and I love trying to challenge myself when homebrewing. But when it comes down to it, I only have two favorite kinds of beer: free, and cold (in that order, too).  And from a brewing perspective, Budweiser has made the careful manipulation of countless variables its bitch! Light, crisp lagers are pretty difficult to make from a homebrewing point of view, because any mistake you make really shines through in the finished product (in which case I'll toss in a bunch of hops and say that's what I meant to do all along! lol)."
beer,3bftco,drunken_flamingo,2,Mon Jun 29 03:32:37 2015 UTC,Same! Budweiser is my non craft beer of choice! Send along some of that Tropic Thunder tho....that sounds great!

beer,3bftco,BuckShit,2,Mon Jun 29 02:10:50 2015 UTC,Rolling rock is never a bad choice.  It's insane what you get for the cost. If you really need to save money go rr over any other cheap beer

beer,3bg8dm,ParmesanPlatoon,39,Sun Jun 28 23:17:16 2015 UTC,"To me the only point of a mixed six is to try new things I wouldn't otherwise want to commit to buying a sixpack of just yet. It's specifically a tester for me, like getting a little taste jot at a bar. I'm less worried about not liking 6 of 6 in a mix than I am about not liking 6 of 6 in an unmixed. If you don't like the first one in a homogenous six, you're stuck with five more that you know you don't want. I don't mind too much because most things aren't terrible but it can be annoying and those unwanted ones can kind of haunt the fridge for a while.   If on the other hand you don't like the first one in a mixed six, you've got five more fresh chances to discover something interesting. The odds that I won't like all six in a mix that I have put together is just very low. But even if I did go 0 for 6 once in a long while, that's just the price of exploration and discovery.   You have a long beer life ahead of you. Be willing to go for it. You'll discover more a lot more quickly. If you're worried you won't like any of the six and you're wanting it for a session, buy a mixed sixpack of all unknowns plus a sixpack of a beer you know you like, just so you've got a fallback."

beer,3bg8dm,drip_pan,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:02:07 2015 UTC,I agree with turkeypants. The whole point of the mix 6 for me is to try something new 6 times over for $10. If I like a particular beer I will just buy a 6 or 12ver outside of just one.   Sometimes committing to a $10-15 6 pack without knowing if you like them leads me to adding those to a mix 6 to try before going big.

There's Rush River as well out of River Falls, WI, but you being right on the border means the tasty MN beers!  If any of my recommendations aren't found where you are you could take a short drive over the river to Taylor's Falls and most likely find them there.  Here's some stuff:  Surly hasn't even been around long and is taking the scene by storm.  They really have a lot of great beers.  The Furious is by far their big seller, but I really like their recent ""Doomtree"", an hommage to a hip hop collective in the cities.  Also really like ""Hell"".  Summit is the flagship of the area for micro growth.  They're like the older guy now...but they've got some solid beer.  I love their Horizon Red, and I'll drink pretty much all of their beers.  Indeed is a unique small brewery.  They're doing some really cool stuff.  I'm hard pressed to dislike any of their beers either.  The Midnight Ryder Black Ale is friggin' delicious.  Also look out for their cans of Mexican Honey Imperial Lager.  Now THAT'S summer beer.  Steel toe is relatively new also and they've got a few beers that are tasty, but they're smaller and I don't know if they're going to make it as far even as the falls.  Look for their Size 7.  Fulton is a bit more prominent, with their ""Sweet Child of Vine""...a few years ago that beer was EVERYWHERE.  Its alright.   Liftbridge has the Farm Girl.  That's a great Saison.  Happy hunting!"

beer,3bklx3,huntimir151,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:46:04 2015 UTC,Basically every major beer you could find at a local gas station. I don't care for anything too stout but definitely not light. Particularly looking for a lager or ale. And nothing too sweet. I hate that stuff. Just a decent hoppy taste really. I don't care for special flavors. Just a good all around beer. And obviously a decent abv

I think its pretty good. i know you already made your decision, but if you wanna go a copper/amber ale route again anytime soon i'd suggest Lagunitas censored or give stone levitation a try. currently, I'm having an Alaskan Amber for the first time and I'm ashamed to say so because i think its fantastic! i'd say to give that a look too! I have no idea where you're at so you may or may not get it, but alleycat amber from lost coast is not a bad one either. atm thats all i can think of off the top of my head! hope it helps!"

beer,3bklx3,shamalamabigdong,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:49:19 2015 UTC,"besides what slash said, typically the beer they come out with is exactly what it says it is, and sometimes not much more to it. like for example they came out with the siracha or however you spell it beer. Their donut beer rotation is another example of just holy cow this is just bad, i mean they got exactly what they said it is in the beer but basically its just that - or one of their other beers they consistently sell is their hazelnut brown. that thing basically tastes like straight up hazelnut. people either find it boring, the hate the taste, or whatever reason they have. This is personally from what i've gathered working at the store i work at.   and to answer your other question I'm in southern California"
beer,3bklx3,BabiesGotTheBends,2,Tue Jun 30 20:23:40 2015 UTC,I think it's good but I don't go out of my way to get it - had it at a party last time and was surprised how tasty it was.

beer,3bkgte,ZOOTV83,3,Mon Jun 29 23:22:24 2015 UTC,Do not age this beer.  It should be drank as fresh as possible.   The chocolate falls out pretty rapidly.
beer,3bkgte,TheoreticalFunk,2,Tue Jun 30 20:28:01 2015 UTC,I'd say just drink it.  I haven't found that aging does anything worthwhile for it.
beer,3bkgte,Blooddawn,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:15:48 2015 UTC,If there's a best by date you should probably drink it. That and I can't imagine too much time will do that choco flavor any favors.

I'm planning to hold a Stone IRS vertical/horizontal tasting  (verti-zontal?) with 2006 through 2015, including Odd-Year variants.

Siasons, many stouts, had my first sour and imperial red. I'm happy I'm exploring things.  It been the same with my music this year. Stuff I use o neeever listen to I'm listening to more and more and putting my most faithful on the back burner."
beer,3be2ln,kchouichomp,2,Sun Jun 28 18:15:40 2015 UTC,"Well shit, that's sounds really neat and open-minded. I'm gonna give some unsolicited advice then. If you liked that sour, try to find Cuvee des Jacobins Rouge. It's become my all-time favorite sour, just a hair ahead of Consecration. Petrus Aged Pale is also very affordable for a barreled sour, and is fantastic. Also, bump some Childish Gambino if you like hip hop at all. Money Baby is my jam of the week every week. Dude's been killing it."
beer,3be2ln,Moosifer26,2,Sun Jun 28 21:37:10 2015 UTC,"You and I would be best friends. I love the Rogue and Childish Gambino has been my jam for the past few weeks!

beer,3be2ln,ReinbachThe3rd,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:06:09 2015 UTC,"Both are solid pieces of advice. Sadly the only sour kve been able to find here in Alaska is from one of the brewers here.

On Water Street is Water Street Brewery, which has pretty good food and usually has 7-8 of their own beers on tap.  Old German Beer Hall has the usual suspects of German beer, but is a fun place to check out.  Also right off of Old World 3rd is a bar called Upper 90. Cool sports memorabilia, and a pretty decent bottled beer selection.   Ale Asylum Riverhouse has all of the different Ale Asylum brews on tap, plus a few they are testing on a limited run.

The tour guides here are some of the best I've seen.  It's the quality tour of Milwaukee.  Milwaukee Brewing Company &/or Milwaukee Ale house - Good food at the Ale House, good tour at the Milwaukee Brewing Company, It's the quantity tour of Milwaukee (basically unlimited within a certain time frame).  The facility is quite a bit smaller and more crowded than lakefront.  Horny Goat Hideaway - No tour...  since HG contracts all their stuff through Point, they only have a small pilot brewery setup there behind a glass wall.  The beer selection is good (all HG's distributed stuff...plus new beers only available at the HGH.

beer,3bgfe3,user10085,7,Mon Jun 29 00:22:08 2015 UTC,"How to remedy this? Remove out-dated beer from the shelves (this is another huge problem, at least in my area) and educate distributors and retailers about proper storage.   The distributors and retailers in your area are fully aware of how to properly store beer, but refrigeration is expensive.  I've never seen any retailer that has all of their beer refrigerated.  I think you'd be hard pressed to find many breweries out there who aren't concerned about putting out only the freshest beer possible.  But getting your beer into the hands of your customers generally means using outside distribution and retailers.  Each is a different business with different prerogatives, and sometimes quality is affected/sacrificed along the way from supplier to customer.  The reality is, if you demand fresh beer, get it at the source.  You limit your options, but you can be more certain of the quality."
beer,3bgfe3,jigglawr,2,Mon Jun 29 02:38:13 2015 UTC,"You're right. Unfortunately geography limits the options, and there are only three breweries in my area."

It sort of sounded like you were saying they just tasted objectively old in a generic way that would apply to any beer, just kind of a stale taste, but don't let me put words in your mouth. My palate may not be as attuned to those taste characteristics as yours, but if it's my first time having a given beer, I'm not sure I'd be able to say whether it tasted old. To me it would just be ""this is how this beer tastes"". And then next time I had it, I could judge whether the second one tasted different. If the second one tasted more flavorful, I'd assume it was either fresher or just a better batch. If it tasted fainter and less lively than the first, I'd assume it was older."
beer,3bgfe3,mathtronic,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:20:14 2015 UTC,"I had had dales and hop nosh prior to the poor experiences I describe above. That was my base line.

beer,3bgfe3,theultrayik,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:37:45 2015 UTC,"You might be surprised how much your palate can vary day to day, or by hour within a day, and how much your mood can affect whether your response to a given sensory input is positive or negative. As a brewer wanting to make decisions about my beer based on how it tastes rather than my own whims, this has been a fascinating thing to learn and a challenging thing to figure out how to work with.  You could look for a same best-by date on the same beer from 2 different retailers and taste side by side to be sure there's something different about them. Or even better, have someone pour one of them into 2 glasses and the other into one glass and see if you can pick the odd one out. Not that I think that kind of rigor is necessary for you to decide whether you're enjoying a beer or not, by all means share your thoughts with the brewer. But I do think that kind of rigor is necessary for the brewer to figure out what to do about it. If you score 100% at picking the odd one out over multiple trials, that is amazing and not something I've seen tracking a crew of brewers for more than a year. If you miss some of them, be open to the idea that your palate or mood is affecting whether you're enjoying the beer rather than the recipe or handling."

I need a TLDR because I read your whole post twice and still don't know what you're saying."
beer,3biqr3,kthoag,-3,Mon Jun 29 16:31:46 2015 UTC,TL;DR People that are new to craft beers don't like hoppy beers. If craft beer is to continue to grow we need new people. We need to help these people find beers they like instead of trying to force IPAs on them.
beer,3biqr3,ATXBeermaker,5,Mon Jun 29 18:24:13 2015 UTC,"Craft beer has been growing apace for years by and large on the back of hoppy beers. Why would they change a winning formula? And it's just really not at all true that there aren't non-hoppy alternative for the curious. I got about 10 different bars around Austin regularly. They all have fairly knowledgeable staff that are more than happy to engage someone and make great suggestions when a customer wants something that ""isn't too hoppy."" I just don't see this as a problem. IPAs sell for a reason, and it's not just because uber-beer-nerds are into them."
beer,3biqr3,ATXBeermaker,-2,Mon Jun 29 19:00:31 2015 UTC,"Then why isn't there any macro IPAs?  I've never known anyone not into beer or only into macro lagers to enjoy an IPA on first taste.  Yes IPA's and hoppy beers have driven the craft movement. I am thinking of the future. We need to attract people who are new to real beer. Also those new to ""real beer"" don't know what ""hoppy"" means. They will sometimes say ""give me something light"" but that's just because they think anything dark is going to be strong and bitter. How many times have you heard an uneducated beer drinker say ""I can't drink guinness it's too thick and heavy"" while drinking a budweiser which is heavier all around - except in flavor.  Also I am not saying we (craft beer drinkers, breweries, bars, etc) are doing a BAD job of recruiting new people to craft beer. I'm just saying we could do it better. I'm also not trying to attack IPAs (my favorite style) I'm just saying other styles are being neglected to the detriment of everyone.  Here is another interesting angle to think about. I've never liked cheap macro lagers. I drank them for a bit and slowly moved into good beers in the late 1990s. I assumed I just didn't like pilsners or kolsch or cream ales because all I'd ever had were bad examples. It took me a LONG time to finally taste some quality examples and realize what I had been missing. Just as I'd incorrectly written off those styles lots of people who try a few different craft beers decide it's not for them and go back to cheap macros...  often because they chose examples that were too ""flavorful"" or bitter or strong. If I start a club to introduce people to film (high quality artsy movies) I'm not going to start them on obscure french films from the 1950s which will alienate them."
beer,3biqr3,ArchibaldHairyTuttle,3,Mon Jun 29 20:20:53 2015 UTC,"Then why isn't there any macro IPAs?   There are lots of IPAs that are owned by large macro companies. Goose Island IPA, for example. Red Hook Longhammer has been brewed for a while and AB-Inbev owns 32% of the CBA, which owns Red Hook, Kona, Widmer Brothers, etc. Don't kid yourself. The big guys are making money on IPAs. They just don't scale to massive volumes very well if you try to keep margins super high.   We need to attract people who are new to real beer.   Why do I have any responsibility in that? There is ample selection of good beer. If people are interested in it, great. Otherwise, it's up to the producers and retailers to worry about how to sell it. I'm not a recruiter for the craft beer industry.  Maybe it's where you live (or where I live), but by and large wherever I go the staff is very knowledgeable and the customers aren't afraid to say they are not."

I'm still afraid of the big bad wolf. InBev isn't giving up. Germany once had a proud great beer scene and InBev (and the other big guys) came in a took it all over and made it all crap.

Make that your crusade instead of worrying about how hoppy beers may be dissuading craft beer beginners."
beer,3biqr3,Ingrid_Cold,0,Mon Jun 29 21:28:11 2015 UTC,Interesting view point...  But I never said I want bigger craft breweries. I just want more market share.  I'd rather have 10k small craft breweries putting out 5k barrels a year than 100 big ones putting out 500k barrels a year. And a variety of different sized craft breweries would be best IMO - which is what we have today.  Also I have no crusade other than to promote craft beer. The IPA idea was just a hypothesis based on a few observations - it was  meant to spur discussion.  I think I combined too many ideas into one post.  And it came out like a manifesto!  It was not my intention.

beer,3bdrk8,aratcliffe,5,Wed Jul 1 03:22:59 2015 UTC,"The most helpful thing to do is list the area you live in so people can make regional suggestions, but I'll try to list some more widely distributed beers with flavors you might like.  Smoky: Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen tastes like you're drinking a big cloud of BBQ smoke. Very, very unique beer.  Salty: Gose is going to be a sour and salty low-ABV beer, sounds weird but very refreshing. Destihl Here Goes Nothing is a great example that I love, Westbrook Gose is supposed to be one of the best around but they don't distribute near me so I can't personally give an opinion on it.  Sweet and malty: Scotch ales for the scotch drinker, of course. Oskar Blues Old Chub is probably the highest quality scotch ale you can find just about anywhere. This is one of my most regular beer purchases, at $9 for a six pack of 8% ABV tasty scotch ale you can't go wrong.  In return, I'll ask you to recommend scotch for me. I'm not a very regular scotch drinker, but the ones I've found that I really like are Glenmorangie 12 and Old Pulteney."

Well, the people who own Glenmorangie also own Ardbeg, and Ardbeg is my personal favourite, so I will always recommend that, especially if you're looking on venturing to the smokier, peatier, Islays, from the more sedate Highlands.  If you're not a fan of the smoke, Benromach 10 is lower on smoke without it being gone, while Ben Nevis tends to have good balance and texture, but more fruit flavours."

If you are generally sipping on Scotch then you would probably enjoy some of the heavy hitters. Old Guardian by Stone or Big Foot by Sierra Nevada are some of the readily available beers. If you can find something that is barrel aged it will give you that extra flavor. Also, I'd go with some Imperial Stouts, much more variations and options that Barleywines."
beer,3bdrk8,OriirO,2,Sun Jun 28 15:50:07 2015 UTC,"Barrel aged stouts and barleywines and old ales.   There are also a few scotch aged beers which will probably be interesting and may kind of work as gateways. On the other hand the similarity while not being the same may be a turn off. Most bourbon drinkers I know don't really like the light sweet scotches, but if they like scotch the peaty stuff is where they go.   The Ola Dubh series from Harviestoun is pretty widely available. It's an old ale (Old Engine Oil) aged in spent Highland Park casks. I've had the 12, 16, 18, and 30 yr versions. There's at least a couple more including a 40yr.   Another interesting one is Mac Fanny Baw from Against the Grain. It's a smoked beer made with, among other things, peat smoked malt, and alderwood smoked salt, aged in spent Angels Envy bourbon barrels, in which they tried to recreate an Islay scotch profile. I like it, but it's a pretty strong love or hate beer.  Sidenote: I need to try some Ardbeg. I love Laphroaig."
beer,3bdrk8,Dawrt,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:16:05 2015 UTC,"I didn't see anyone say this, Harviestoun makes a beer called ""Ola Dubh"" (oola doo), ages on scotch whiskey barrels. They make 3 different versions 16, 18, 30yr, I think the 30 is the only one aged on scotch whiskey, the other 2 I'm not sure about.   It is a dark beer with that roasted scotch flavor, molasses sweetness. Only 8%, drinks a little heavier."

Then through transport, distributors, into the shop...   One more won't hurt it."

If you like their White IPA, try their Ol'Factory Pilsner and Workers Comp Saison. You won't regret it. To prove I'm not an employee or whatever, I think their Rye 95 is garbage... but maybe I just don't like Belgian tripels? Too heavy on the mouthfeel and flavors.. But their DIPA and Conntucky ale are both great investments, if you ask me. And their brewery tasting room is probably the best brewery experience I've had so far. Wicked Weed (Asheville) comes in at a close second, but they also had lots of food....   Other than that, all I can think about is Victory.

Victory: Baltic Thunder Porter comes to mind. You can experiment with others (like Moonglow Weizenbock or Golden Monkey Strong Ale) since Victory is a pretty solid brewery, but they may not be your style given your original post.    Lancaster Brewing: Milk Stout. I love this beer. It has many of the same flavor profiles of a porter. It's a little sweet but not cloyingly so and super easy to drink.  Bell's: Based out of Michigan but easy to find in PA. You might like the Kalamazoo Stout. I like many beers from them, but they might not all be suited to your tastes.   Troegs: Java Head Stout (if you like coffee). Again, a solid brewery but most of their beers seem out of your comfort zone.  Brooklyn Brewing: You might like the Brooklyn Pilsner.    I think that's a decent start. Happy drinking!"

Rhinegeist (from Cincinnati) is also popular around Lexington/NKY. Their IPA, ""Truth,"" is stellar."

The only restaurant that closed was the 4th Street location and that is due to Kindred buying the property and going to demolish theater square to make room for another building. The E Main St tap room/brewery/distribution warehouse are not part of the restaurants. They split up around 10 or 15 years ago. Only the tap room/brewery/distribution warehouse changed.

Country Boy's Cougar Bait is available in six-packs, and although I wish they canned their other beers, it's a good blonde ale. If you can find Eight Ball's Reintarnation, buy it. It's also out of Newport and fantastic. Lexington's West Sixth Brewing has a Heller Heaven Double IPA that's out of this world, too. If your into heavier beers, their Cocoa Porter is pretty top notch, too. I've seen Liquor Barn Beaumont Centre have these in stock.

I've always thought Chimay Blue would be delicious with lamb. Maybe also a Doppelbock like Weihenstephaner Korbinian. Something rich and dark but not overpowering.

Anyways, he passes out around 4:00 pm (early start to the day), and his wife invites some of her friends over since she's been babysitting drunk guys all day. I'm one of the few still awake and relatively sober, and I hear the girls talking in the kitchen.   They're looking for beer. They can't find any Miller Lite, so one of them finds this rare 2006 Samichlaus in the fridge - a birthday present from a fellow beer snob. This cunt of a woman (not the wife, one of her friends - the fat loud obnoxious stereotype craving attention) opens it without asking anyone and takes one swig. She gags, repulsed by the flavor, and just dumps the whole thing down the drain, complaining as loudly as possible about how horrible this beer is and that she's doing someone a favor.   I don't argue that she had no idea what she had in her hands, but who in the hell goes looking for a Miller Lite - at someone else's house - just grabs whatever bottle they can find, and proceeds to dump it out and complain about it?"

He asked if he could grab a beer, and I said sure! I had a shit ton of beer in the fridge, it was a party, that was the point. I said ""Just grab something from the door,"" where I had put all the party-friendly beer. Instead, he reaches into the deep back of the fridge, holds up the Trappist and says ""What about this one?"" I loudly and immediately exclaim ""NO! That's a gift! Grab literally any other beer!""

beer,3b8zli,altf4life,4,Sat Jun 27 04:53:56 2015 UTC,"The perceived ""heaviness"" of Guinness comes from being nitrogenated vs being carbonated. Smaller, denser bubbles create a thicker, richer mouthfeel and I find (with my sample size of one) that it seems to sit in my stomach much longer than a carbonated porter or stout.   A brewery near me has a rotating nitro tap and even a heffeweizen becomes quite ""heavy"" due to it.   I work in a tasting room and most not beer people are a little wary of things like porters and stouts because Guinness is so ubiquitous (here, at least).  As soon as I explain the mechanism of it people tend to become a lot more receptive."

It's got a wonderfully full body with a rich, sweet aroma, and A very well balanced flavor profile that let's the porter's maltiness be the focus while a light bready sweetness finishes on the pallet.   Ok on my way to DBC now."

beer,3bbhjl,xyz1024,2,Sat Jun 27 22:54:59 2015 UTC,"Gilpin Black Gold from Hogshead Brewing. Everything Hogshead makes is brewed in the English cask style, so it is truly the most authentically English porter in CO. Definitely worth a visit. NB: there are only two tap accounts that carry Hogshead, owing to the fact that Hogshead is very particular about who they distribute to, owing to the fact that maintaining cask beer at the proper conditions is exceptionally important for product perception and uniformity. The more you know!  Also advise visiting Backcountry Tap House in Boulder. The folks there will talk your ear off about sampling all sorts of different beers, and the bottle list encyclopedia-like in breadth and depth."

beer,3bbhjl,bigowlbrewery,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:40:05 2015 UTC,"Definitely try Ballast Point Victory at Sea. Kind of pricey but one of the best porters I've drank. Should be available in CO. It's from San Diego. Now available in 6 packs and bombers. Try the bomber if you can get it. Outstanding brew and I'm not really a fan of Ballast Point. Too hoppy and too pricey for what you get. However, the balance between hops and malt in their porter is perfection. Worth the extra few bucks."

beer,3bb1mw,MrRaoulDuke,0,Sun Jun 28 21:26:37 2015 UTC,"A good rule of thumb for any nation's beers is if the ABV is over 8% you CAN cellar it. Anything over 12, unless already cellared, is usually aided by extended cellaring. The main exception is extremely hoppy beers because the hop flavors drop off precipitously. Those beers can cellar but transition towards the barley wine category after 6-8 months usually. There are a lot of specific exceptions to this rule so if you're unsure about a beer, ask folks, but I've had good success building my cellar this way."
