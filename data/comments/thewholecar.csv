thewholecar,3dxxm5,gtam,5,Mon Jul 20 13:13:25 2015 UTC,"Info:  Sydney Allard founded Allard Motor Company in 1936, producing potent sports racing cars powered by Ford V8 and Lincoln V12 engines. Allard racing cars continued to prove themselves as capable competitors, with one example winning the 1952 Monte Carlo Rally piloted by Mr. Allard himself, narrowly defeating Sir Stirling Moss. That same year, Allard released a new touring car based on their venerable J2 racing car, the K3.  Featuring a reinforced chromoly-tube chassis, Allard's innovative divided front axle suspension system, racing steering ratios, and a host of potent American engines, The K3 is a racecar at heart, beneath an all-aluminum envelope body. While the racing attributes limited everyday practicality, the K3 offered undeniable performance along with some welcome luxuries, like seating for three, a spacious trunk, and a convertible top.   The concessions made for performance, along with the steep $5,300 asking price, made the K3's appeal as a touring car suffer. As a result, only 63 of these exhilarating roadsters were produced and just 46 remain today.   Source  Question - What's up with the bent gearstick?"

This one is special too as it's the 25th Anniversary Edition, only 100 in Canada! Some special trim bits and stronger and lighter mechanical bits make this a really special send off to the NC Miata.   I actually drove this exact one when it had around 400-500KM on the Odometer, I remember stepping into a Scion FRS right after and immediately stalled the car. The shifter + clutch combo on the Miata is just so buttery smooth, it was jarring to step into another car right after, everything felt disconnected. Now a year later, stepping into my personal car (BMW 135i) after a day with the Miata and I am again reminded of how effortless this little Miata is. Sometimes the answer really is ""Because Miata"".   Hope you guys enjoy the album!"

thewholecar,3dc7sd,uluru,4,Wed Jul 15 08:18:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you!   Overall, I did not find anyone who really complained. Sure it is not your traditional 6 cylinder or 8 cylinder Caddy--but since you can still purchase the ATS with that fabulous 3.6-litre, and would be the choice for more of the 'traditional' crowd, I think that this 2.0T is reserved for the younger generation. Further, there are some examples of the 2.0T being tuned to well over 400 Horsepower.   In terms of quality, I found the ATS to be outstanding. Everything from the quality of the drive thanks to the magnetic ride control, to the power that 2.0T delivers. (273hp~) The chassis is magnificent and really nothing about the car felt 'entry level'. I tested an SRX a few months back, and that felt Entry level and was actually MORE expensive than this ATS. A recurring thought I had when driving this car was that it felt like I was piloting a Spitfire in World War 2 on my way to fight ze Germans. The ATS feels like a BMW 3 series /MB C-Class /Audi A4 killer!  TL;DR: ATS drive good."

thewholecar,3d912k,mgbgtv8,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:48:04 2015 UTC,"Found this moody album over on Petrolicious.   Photographer's facebook.  Story:  Clark Gable would win over audiences and critics alike with performances in films like A Free Soul, Red Dust, and, but his first forays into Tinseltown were met with a less than enthusiastic response. Initially considered too rough to play a romantic lead by studio decision makers, it was not until undergoing grooming and training by his acting coach that Gable came to epitomize the American ideal of masculinity and virility.  Gable would make the top-ten box office list 16 times, win an Oscar for his role in Frank Capra's It Happened One Night, and is immortalized by his delivery of the line ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,” in Gone with the Wind—among the most quoted in the history of cinema. He would also play a race car driver in To Please a Lady, and loved automobiles, so what’s a king of his industry to do? Buy lots of them, so he could squire around the most beautiful leading ladies of the day in style.  Many people consider taste to be a purely subjective attribute, but both subjectively and objectively, Gable had taste in spades when it came to cars. As he gained fame and fortune, he was able to afford the best, and some that entered his stable were the 1935 Duesenberg Model JN that played its own part in Gable's famed relationship with Hollywood beauty Carole Lombard, as well as a 1936 Duesenberg SSJ Speedster, 1937 Ford Lincoln-Zephyr V12, 1938 Packard Eight Convertible Victoria, 1948 Jaguar 3.5-Liter Mark IV Drophead Coupe, 1955 Mercedes-Benz Gullwing, and a 1956 Mercedes-Benz 300 Sc.  In 1948, the new Jaguar XK120 would be unveiled to the public—and Gable was smitten. He wanted the car as badly as another starlet he may have tried to seduce. Originally intended as a limited-production model to raise interest for a forthcoming series of sedans powered by the same, and new dual-overhead-camshaft inline six-cylinder engine with hemispherical—or “hemi”—combustion chambers, orders for the XK120 immediately exceeded capacity, but there was also steak to go along with the sizzle.  All XK120s had independent torsion bar front suspension, semi-elliptic leaf springs at the rear, recirculating ball steering, and telescopically adjustable steering column, a sophisticated setup for the day. The six-cylinder engine displaced 3.4 liters and produced 160 bhp, and was said to be capable of 120 mph. That would make sense for the XK120 nomenclature, however the car was capable of more, hitting more than 130 mph in later testing. Zero-to-60 mph took place in less than 10 seconds, quick for the day.   Gable could have certainly afforded any car he desired, but the XK120 was priced at $3,940 in the United States, lower than many of the cars the actor could buy, or already possessed. No, what attracted Gable to this car was its combination of beauty and performance, and Gable would go to International Motors on Wilshire Boulevard in Hollywood and personally insist that he be sold the very first XK120 to arrive on the West Coast.  Jaguar initially thought it might probably sell a couple hundred of the new model, but demand was so strong that the first cars had their bodies made out of hand-beaten aluminum until the actual production tooling was ready. While most of these early aluminum cars were destined for racing, Gable’s first XK120 was one of the first customer cars to leave the Holbrook Lane production line in June, 1949.  Our feature car here is one of Gable’s other three XK120s, and this one was gifted to him by the Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner at the time, Anton ""Tony"" Hulman, Jr., while the actor was in town filming To Please A Woman. He would keep it stored there, and amazingly, the car would only see use once a year in May when Gable, a race fan, would come back into town to see the race. Today, only 6,500 miles register on the odometer. The unpaid celebrity endorsement did no harm to the sales figures for the car, and the actor loved the model so much he that he would go on to own three other XK120s. Gable would also write in a 1950 issue of Road & Track magazine his thoughts on the car.  Titled My Favorite Sports Car…, Gable would espouse on his attempt to reach the XK120’s official 132 mph top speed, when he managed to coax 124 mph out of his completely stock and unmodified car. A total of 12,078 XK120s were sold through the car’s production run to discriminating individuals, and while today celebrities and cars are nothing new, some celebrities, like Gable, were much more interested in the intrinsic qualities of the car they bought.  Most celebrity cars change hands often, but this one—hidden away from prying eyes for more than 40 years at one of the most traffic’d places on earth for car enthusiasts—must be one Gable would instantly feel at home in more than 50 years after his death."

I'm quite fond of classic cars for their most simple shapes. Say the boxy lights on the back of that AW11 the other day. Progress is often associated with ""more"", and we see that in a lot of modern cars, with their busy and 'innovative' designs. I really value simple, so I dig the the circles."

thewholecar,3c3xzr,MeIsMyName,4,Sat Jul 4 19:44:29 2015 UTC,"Definitely. It's a real shame this car was never actually put into production, after a much needed interior color change.  It's exterior design probably could use a little bit more refinement to make it look more sleek. I think they overdid some aspects of the design, trying to integrate triangles and other odd shapes into things that really should have just been smoothed out to look closer to the 2005 GT in overall design. However the truly impressive part of this car is the engine. How many cars are there on the road with a quad turbo V12, especially in 1995?

Renault's considerable F1-derived turbo-charging expertise was applied to the humble 1.4-litre overhead-valve engine, resulting in a power increase to 160bhp (in road trim), an output sufficient for a top speed of 125mph and a 0-60 time of under seven seconds. In the Turbo, this remarkable little engine was mounted amidships (where the rear passenger seats had been) and drove the rear wheels via a five-speed transaxle.  A thinly disguised two-seater supercar, the Turbo was first seen in prototype form at the 1978 Paris Salon and made its competition debut in 1980 on the Tour de Corse, Jean Ragnoti's 250bhp works car leading the event before succumbing to electrical trouble. In 1981 Ragnotti/Andrie won the Monte Carlo Rally outright for Renault and the following year Ragnotti won the Tour de Corse again. Faced with increasing competition from teams running four-wheel drive cars, Renault responded with more powerful 5 Tour de Corse and 5 Maxi Turbo variants, Ragnotti adding another Tour de Corse win in the latter in 1985. At the end of the season the works team retired the 5 Turbo from competition. Had Renault chosen to contest a full international programme with the 5 Turbo rather than concentrating on French national events, then its record at the highest level would surely have been even more impressive.  I  would like  to start a new trend, rating the car from 1 to 10 with an anonymous poll.. We can discuss it in the Meta thread."

thewholecar,3bi9ry,weatherwar,5,Wed Jul 1 15:58:20 2015 UTC,"Source    Text from here    The Nissan, or more appropriately Datsun, Z chassis, has always been a favorite among car enthusiasts worldwide. The aggressive yet classic body lines have been a definitive shape in the automotive industry for decades now. Erik Jonasson’s journey is one that takes us back in time in more than one way.    In 2006 Erik bought a 350Z, which was driven everyday for nearly 4 years. As time went on he became more and more aware of the history behind that little Z badge on the front fenders. In 2010, Erik decided that it was time for something with a little more soul and character; something unique. This particular Datsun 240Z (S30) was something special to begin with, having been cared for, and rather meticulously at that, by a single owner since 1985.    The care included some tinkering as well. The original 2.8L was stroked to a 3.1, with a Nismo cam, and a Triple Weber DCOE 45 kit, all matched with a 5 speed box to really make this car move. However, it didn’t take long for Erik to dig into the car himself.  The vision was to make it a real track car, a carbon fiber front diffuser and the rear bumper was ditched in favor of a tow eye. Soon after came that iconic duckbill style BRE rear spoiler, and matte black fender mirrors to replace the California mirrors it previously had, for a more authentic Japanese look.    After some more research, a real coilover option couldn’t be found, so it was time to do some custom work. Erik modified some Golf mounts to the car and welded them in, and of course brought the car down to earth to an aggressively functional height to keep in line with the track look.  As time went on, the focus became less on making the car into a bona fide track car, and more about making something that would both look great and perform well. Tire sizes were changed from 285s to 225s, and the car was sent off to the body shop to have it’s slightly damaged fenders reshaped to achieve the aggressive look Erik was aiming for. The rear of the car is now 13cm (5 inches)  wider than factory spec and the fronts were flared to be able to fit the new stance of the car. The whole care was then painted Ferrari Rosso red to finish of the ever-classic look.    Erik had out grown the look of the Centerlines on the car, and began the search for something that kept true to the old school Japanese track look. He had found some SSR Formula Stars in Japan, had them shipped to Sweden, and widened them from their original 14x6.5 to 14x8 et 15 and an incredible 14x10 et -47, creating some serious dish in the rear. The car's new style didn’t end there however.  Little details were added such as the JDM pole parking lamp, JDM tail lights, Nardi handbrake grip and shifter, Momo Steering wheel and pedals, and a Nismo shift knob to bring it all together.    As it sits now, Erik’s car is what many would refer to as Shakotan style, a style  relatively unseen anywhere outside of Japan, which is exactly what he is aiming for. Here in Sweden, the car is extremely well known and has a presence about it where ever it goes. While it may not be for everyone, there is no denying that the car doesn’t stand out from the rest. Erik’s future plans for the car are to step up the handling and extract some more power from the straight 6 to really make into the track car he’s always wanted. In his words, he wants to make it into what he calls the ""perfect driver's car"". Based on where the car is now, I have no trouble at all believing that Erik will be able to achieve just that."

thewholecar,3bbh9g,Catatafish,7,Sat Jun 27 17:01:37 2015 UTC,"Text from: http://classiccars.wikia.com/wiki/Messerschmitt_KR200  Messerschmitt, temporarily not allowed to manufacture aircraft, had turned its resources to producing other commodities. In 1952, Fend approached Messerschmitt with the idea of manufacturing small motor vehicles. These were based on his Fend Flitzer invalid carriage.  The first of Fend's vehicles to enter production at Messerschmitt's Regensburg factory was the KR175. The title Kabinenroller means ""scooter with cabin"". While the Messerschmitt name and insignia were used on the car, a separate company, incorporated as Regensburger Stahl- und Metallbau GmbH, was created to manufacture and market the vehicle.  The KR200 replaced the KR175 in 1955. While using the same basic frame as the KR175 with changes to the bodywork (notably including wheel cutouts in the front fenders) and an improved canopy design, the KR200 was otherwise an almost total redesign. The rear suspension and engine mounting were reworked, and hydraulic shock absorbers were installed at all three wheels. Tire sizes were enlarged to 4.00x8.  Retailing for around DM 2,500, the KR200 was considered an instant success with almost 12,000 built during its first year. A maximum speed in excess of 90 km/h (56 mph) despite a claimed power output of only 10 PS (7.4 kW; 9.9 hp) reflected the vehicle's light weight.  In 1956, Messerschmitt was allowed to manufacture aircraft again and lost interest in Fend's microcars. Messerschmitt sold the Regenburg works to Fend, who formed Fahrzeug- und Maschinenbau GmbH, Regensburg (FMR) to continue production of the KR200 and his other vehicles.  In 1957, the KR200 Kabrio model was released, featuring a cloth convertible top and fixed side window frames. This was followed by the KR201 Roadster without window frames, using a folding cloth top, a windscreen, and removable side curtains. A Sport Roadster was later offered with no top and with the canopy fixed into place so that the driver would have to climb in and out at the top of the car.  Production of the KR200 was heavily reduced in 1962 and ceased in 1964 as sales had been dropping for a few years. The demand for basic economy transport in Germany had diminished as the German economy boomed. A similar situation developed in other parts of Europe such as in the manufacturer's biggest export destination, the United Kingdom, where sales were particularly affected by the increasing popularity of the Mini.  24-hour record run  In 1955, in order to prove the KR200's durability, Messerschmitt prepared a KR200 to break the 24-hour speed record for three-wheeled vehicles under 250 cc (15.3 cu in). The record car had a special single-seat low-drag body and a highly modified engine, but the suspension, steering, and braking components were stock. Throttle, brake, and clutch cables were duplicated. The record car was run at the Hockenheimring for 24 hours and broke 22 international speed records in its class, including the 24-hour speed record, which it set at 103 km/h (64 mph)  Messerschmitt Service Car  Messerschmitt, and subsequently FMR, made factory-converted Service Cars to order for the automobile service industry. Similar in concept to the Harley-Davidson Servi-Car and the Indian Dispatch Tow, the Service Car had a detachable tow bar and clamp, a revised front suspension to accommodate the tow bar when in use, and a storage system inside the car to accommodate the tow bar when not in use. The service technician would drive the Service Car to the customer's car and, if the customer's car was drivable, attach the tow bar to the front of the Service Car, clamp the other end of the tow bar to the bumper of the customer's car, and drive the customer's car to the garage. When the service was complete, he would drive the car back to the customer while towing the Service Car, detach the Service Car from the customer's car, and drive back to the garage. Approximately 12 were built; only one is known to exist at present.  Features  The KR200 incorporated several features unique to the KR line and its four-wheeled derivative, the FMR Tg500. Externally, the narrow body, the transparent acrylic bubble canopy and low stance were among the more obvious features.  Tandem seating  The narrow body, and corresponding low frontal area, was achieved with tandem seating, which also allowed the body to taper like an aircraft fuselage, within a practical length. 10 PS (7.4 kW; 9.9 hp) propelled the KR200 to around 105 km/h (65 mph). The consumption of the car was 87 mpg-imp (3.2 L/100 km).  The tandem seating also centralized the mass of the car along the longitudinal axis which, combined with the low center of gravity, low weight, and wheel placement at the vehicle's extremes, gave the KR200 good handling characteristics A more minor advantage of tandem seating was that it made an export version to countries that drive on the left unnecessary. An ""Export"" model was built, but this denoted a more luxurious trim level.  Bubble canopy  Entry to most KR models except the KR201 Sport Roadster and a corresponding Tg500 version was through a canopy door hinged on the right side of the vehicle. The door included all the windows (windshield, window frames on all but the Roadster models, folding top on Roadster and Kabrio models, and acrylic bubble on other versions) and the frame in which it was set, extending from the right side of the monocoque tub to the left. On Sport Roadster models, the canopy was fixed and there was neither a top nor any windows at all, only a tonneau cover. The bubble top on the KR200 was simplified over that of the KR175 by the use of a larger curved glass windshield that formed A-pillars with the side window frames. This allowed the bubble to be simpler and more compact than the KR175 bubble, and it was consequently easier and less expensive to produce. The windshield wiper, manual on the KR175, was electric on the KR200.  Engine and transmission  The KR200 ran on a 191 cc (11.7 cu in) Fichtel & Sachs air-cooled single cylinder two-stroke engine positioned in front of the rear wheel, just behind the passenger's seat. The engine had two sets of contact breaker points and, to reverse, the engine was stopped and then restarted, going backwards. This was effected by pushing the key further in the ignition switch than normal, whether intentionally or not. One result of this was that the KR200's sequential, positive-stop transmission provided the car with the same four gear ratios available in reverse as in forward movement.  Apart from the dual-mode ignition, the KR200 had a steering bar reminiscent of that of an aircraft. Operated by pushing rather than by turning, the steering bar was connected directly to the track rods of the front wheels, providing an extremely direct response best suited to small, measured inputs. The gearshift lever had a secondary lever on it which, when actuated, would put the car in neutral regardless of what gear it had been in before, although the transmission would have to be shifted back to first before the car would be able to move from a standstill.  Unlike the KR175, the KR200 had a full set of pedals: clutch, brake, and accelerator. The brake pedal still operated mechanical brakes using cables.  There are car clubs in Europe, the US, and elsewhere that still value these cars, usually for their quirky character rather than their actual monetary value. Nonetheless, some collectors will pay over 20,000 euros for a well-maintained ""Schmitt"".  Aftermarket reproduction parts are made for the KR200, including reproduction bubble tops made from car-safe polymethyl methacrylate."

This was a French engineer's idea (Gabriel Voisin, a pioneer in aircraft design, having built the first airplane to cross Europe) of what affordable motoring should be. The first idea came in the 20s, but it wasn't until 1949 that the first car was introduced at the Paris Motor Show under the name of Biscooter. It managed to grab 1500 preorders until it was deemed ""probably not a good idea"" by a market research study.  It was a Spanish firm ""Auto Nacional S.A."" that saw the potential for such car in the Spanish market and bought the patent to manufacture the car in Barcelona. If at that time, the average car cost 10 years of salary, this was just a mere 3 years of hard earned money.   The body is made of aluminium, and it has a 2-stroke 9 hp Hispano Villiers engine (made under license from ""The Villiers Engineering Co"") driving the front wheels through a chain.

Working in collaboration with chemical company Rohm & Haas, who had just developed a new product called “Plexiglas”, they created an entire body shell for a 1939 Pontiac Deluxe Six. It was soon dubbed the “Ghost Car.”  When the car was first featured at General Motors’ “Highways and Horizons” pavilion, it was a massive hit. Most people wouldn’t have seen Plexiglas before, so a transparent material with that many curves was almost unheard of. Here you could look through the body of the car to see all its internal workings exposed. For aesthetic purposes all structural metal was given a copper wash, while the hardware and even the dashboard were covered in chrome. All the rubber elements in the car were made in white, including the tires.  The final price for the car? In the days when a new Pontiac was just about $700, this beauty cost $25000 to build.

thewholecar,3aynoq,ChipsHanden,10,Wed Jun 24 15:42:13 2015 UTC,"The Alfa Romeo Carabo was a milestone in Supercar design. Originally penned by Marcello Gandini, from Bertone, the car was called “Carabo,” meaning beetle. The concept car was shown in October 1968, at Porte de Versailles in Paris, to a stunned crowd. It was built on the Chassis of the mid-engined V8 Alfa Romeo Tipo 33 and was an experimental design. The Lamborghini Miura, also previously designed by Gandini, had suffered from front-end lift at high speeds, so the Carabo was an exercise in focusing on an aerodynamic solution. The car also featured upward hinging doors, which later inspired the Lamborghini Countach.  The 1968 Alfa Romeo Carabo concept car was based on the race-derived mechanicals of the exclusive 33 Stradale from the previous year, but that wasn’t its only claim to fame: it also inspired two of last century’s most iconic cars...  The Carabo project was a collaborative effort between the Italian manufacturer and the Bertone styling house: a partnership which had previously borne fruits that included the 2000 Sportiva and BAT concept cars of the mid-1950s. The basis of the Carabo was a chassis numbered 75033.109 which was, more specifically, that of a 33 Stradale road car. Despite sharing mechanicals with the Tipo 33 race car and since being recognised as one of the most beautiful cars in history, Alfa had trouble finding owners for the Stradale due to its steep asking price of around $17,000. As a result, five of the Stradale chassis were passed to Italian carrozzerie: two to Pininfarina (used for the 33.2 and Cuneo concepts), one to Italdesign (which became the Iguana concept), and two to Bertone – the other being used as a basis for the 1976 Navajo concept.  The H-shaped tubular chassis supported an all-aluminium 1995cc engine which was designed by Carlo Chiti and, incidentally, was the first Alfa Romeo V8. The fuel-injected, longitudinally mounted motor used chain-driven camshafts and red-lined at 10,000rpm, despite being detuned to 230bhp from the Tipo race car’s 250-270bhp. This granted the Carabo a top speed of 160mph and the ability to dispatch the 0-62mph sprint in 5.5 seconds, with the power being sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed, syncromeshed, transaxle gearbox designed by Valerio Colotti."

thewholecar,3apzp5,eyeothemastodon,8,Mon Jun 22 19:55:15 2015 UTC,"Pictures from RM Auctions and text from Autoweek  The BMW-Glas 3000 V8 Fastback by Frua was borne from the Bavarian automaker's purchase of the Glas company, which also produced a small coupe and GT that wore a roundel after BMW's purchase. One other model that Glas produced was the 3000 V8 that was a little more challenging visually than the small sports cars. The purchase of Glas by BMW gave Pietro Frua an opportunity to restyle the 3000 V8, after working on a number of other projects for Glas.  The result is a classic Frua design, one that reminds just about everyone of Maserati cars, namely the Mistral and the Indy. Frua gave it a sleek, low-slung appearance that also manages to use some sharp angles. The front and rear overhangs are on the longer side, but well within the proportions sported by Maseratis of similar design at the time. The BMW-Glas 3000 V8 Fastback features an almost-hidden BMW kidney grille which looks like a bit of an afterthought, with the Italianate styling overwhelming the chassis' German roots and character, requiring one to be relatively close to the car to identify it as a BMW unless one is an expert in rare coachbuilt German coupes.  Powered by a 160-hp 2,982cc V8 engine connected to a four-speed manual transmission, the BMW-Glas 3000 V8 Fastback features an independent front suspension with double wishbones and de Dion rear axle with a Panhard bar, with triple Solex downdraft carburetors sipping the fuel.  This car was displayed at the Paris and Frankfurt motor shows in 1967, switching from red to a blue metallic finish between shows. A blue metallic color is what the car wore last at the Barcelona auto show, after which it was sold to a private customer in Spain who would go on to keep it for over 20 years. The current consignor has treated the car to a mechanical restoration, which included a repaint and a reupholstery of the interior. The car now shows 64,950 miles on its odometer, believed to be genuine.  This car hails from the period when coachbuilders and automakers tended to sell their show cars, and this example reportedly led an uneventful life after its show days were over. Its pedigree is a ticket to the world's top concours events, and it helps that the design has aged well. There is a finite number of coachbuilt BMWs from the 1960s and the 1970s out there, and as values for Batmobiles and Maseratis alike pick up, the top estimate (US$530,000) may seem like a good deal in a few years.  The car was auctioned last May at Villa Erba. I cannot find how much it was sold for. Valuation seems way too high."

thewholecar,3aqz6x,uluru,6,Mon Jun 22 20:15:41 2015 UTC,"Hey guys,  This one's a long one so TL:DR - It's a ""recreation"" Shelby Cobra 427, but a good one. It changed my views on replica/recreation cars after I shot it.  As for the writing itself, I'm trying to put a bit more effort into that area these days, and would really appreciate some honest feedback on how I can improve. Feel free to PM me if you'd prefer.  It was a long, boring drive to reach Bologna from Switzerland. Highway driving in the Audi was smooth and quiet, but ultimately repetitive and dull. At least it gave me time to think about the car I was booked to shoot on arrival. It was a replica Shelby Cobra 427, but reportedly a very nice example indeed. I realized that I wasn’t sure exactly how I felt about replica cars, and switched off the music to let myself think.  Being honest with myself, I admitted that I might hold something of a bias against replica vehicles. I’m always interested in authentic products when I spend my money, be it on a pair of shoes from a company that has been making the same design for decades, or eating at restaurants whose menus reflect the backgrounds of the chefs, rather than what sells best. Rightly or wrongly, if we were playing a word association game and replica was the prompt, “fake” would probably be the first word to pop into my head.  Since then, I’ve posed this idea to others to understand if this was a commonly held view, and while it differed slightly in the words chosen, the overwhelming majority agreed that original cars were “always better than a replica”. So why was I driving six hours that day to shoot this “fake” car? Well, a job is a job, but images in my mind of an American icon wearing foreign number plates in Italy’s “Motor Valley” sounded fun. I’m so glad that I went though, because the shoot really changed the way I thought about non-original cars, and certainly influenced the selection of cars that we publish here.  On arrival at the owner’s beautiful modern home mid-afternoon, we introduced ourselves and sat down to have a quick chat before the shoot began. Angelo told me a story of how his favorite toy as a child was a model car. He would come to discover that the blue roadster with white stripes he adored was based on a 1965 Shelby Cobra 427, and promised himself that he would try to own the real thing one day. Fast-forward a few decades and sadly, prices of original cars had hit stratospheric levels. Clearly, Angelo shared a dream that many others had aspired to realize, and supply and demand had been working against him for quite some time.  Disappointed but not defeated, he set out to find another way of experiencing the thrill of owning this roadster he had dreamt about parking in his own garage for so long. Clearly, the original is out of the question for all but the most well-heeled enthusiast – and even then, would those folks drive them anywhere near the limit? More likely the remaining original cars will be preserved by collectors in climate controlled garages around the world.  He considered his options and decided that buying a replica Cobra was the only way that he would ever know if the sensation of piloting a real life version of his favorite toy was as good as he had always imagined. Angelo found a number of options available, with big names in the sector like Superformance being considered, but in the end, it was Backdraft Racing that won his order. I got in touch with the owners of the company based down in Florida, as I was curious to see what they were all about.  I asked the blokes in charge what separated their company from the pack (there are a surprising number of firms building Cobra-like vehicles in the United States) and what they would say to folks who think that non-original cars are “lesser” vehicles. He explained that people come to their firm because they build the best car to drive, not the most authentic replica. They race their cars all the time, and the team knows what they are doing. Tony Martin runs the factory where the cars are built, and he knows a thing or two about developing cars and quality control of components. Having won many races in over his career, including the Daytona 24hr in 1984, he adds a lot of credibility to the company.   We as a company do not focus ourselves on building an authentic replica, as we are more concerned about the drivability of our cars. Our biggest selling point is a road test especially if the customer has driven one of our competitor’s cars. We build approximately 160 cars per year and ship them worldwide. We offer different spec cars for different countries to help meet local requirements for registration. We brand the cars with our own name, as we are proud of what we do. Essentially building a modern sports car with 60's styling. Like all automotive companies we believe racing improves the breed and we use this to test and develop our cars. This is not done to the same extent as we do by our competitors.  Seemed like a pretty no-nonsense explanation, and when I read through the specs, I better understood why Angelo had decided to go with them. Just like this popular post, BDR’s recreation takes the Cobra’s classic styling and tweaks things in order to produce something unique to the brand, and then focuses on producing a roadster with better performing modern components under the bodywork. Choose the engine that excites you the most. Say the small block 427 for those wishing to recreate a muscle car feel, or a Ford Coyote 5.0 for those chasing something more modern. The suspension that is continually tuned and developed through their racing endeavors are all based on BMW components, so customers can be assured of easy parts support in the future. Given the modern performance, and the fact that a comparable Superformance car would likely be around $25,000 more than the RT3, I can definitely see the attraction in placing an order.  Angelo was certainly happy with his decision anyway, and after spending the afternoon studying the car through my lens, I couldn’t fault it. After the car ride there spent wondering how I would judge this non-original car, I’d been anxious to see if it felt cheap, fake, or just “off” in some way. It didn’t. It sent vibrations throughout his home when he turned the key, and sounded magnificent on the run, turning heads wherever we drove. With around 550hp pushing just 2400lbs, it was genuinely fast, and while the suspension was clearly developed to handle the demands of a track, it was certainly drivable on the street as well. It simply felt like a proper, substantial, well-sorted sports car, and I found myself struggling to remember why I had developed a grudge against replica or recreation vehicles.  I’ve decided that it was a combination of seeing poorly executed builds online, and talking to clients with hugely valuable collections of original cars. Generally speaking, people form their own point of view from their personal experiences, and those opinions of people they get along with or admire, and I was no different. With so many manufacturers building cars over time, I suppose I had more than enough to read and discover about “real” cars to bother investing much time in considering replicas. Speaking with the owners of rare original cars, I came to better understand the cost and effort required to preserve classic cars in original condition. They enter concours events around the world to share their cars with fans, and obsess over every detail in both the car’s build and historical record. For the most part, many collectors I dealt with considered themselves stewards of historic objects, and would never deviate from the car as it was first created. With that perspective, I could understand how they looked down on replicas as a cheap imitation at worst, and a flattering homage at best, and I’d adopted their views as my own.  I still hold great respect for those that value originality. Even if you start with an authentic car, it’s much, much harder to maintain a car with original components - repairing and reconditioning rather than replacing or repainting.  These wealthy collectors that buy the sort of cars we showcase here with our auction highlights are definitely true car fans. They are willing to spend more money than some of us spent on our homes to acquire and preserve a piece of automotive art. They could spend that money in thousands of ways that I couldn’t relate to, so I definitely respect that they feel so strongly about original cars – but I no longer share their dismissive attitude towards replicas.  I’ve realized now that dismissing all non-original cars as lesser cars was pretty ignorant of me, perhaps even arrogant. Why should the world be black and white, when the grey areas are so much fun to explore? Exceptional replicas and recreations of many cars do exist, and I feel like they deserve a spot on these pages so that they can be discovered and enjoyed here alongside the other remarkable cars we feature. Perhaps one day you’ll find yourself in Angelo’s position, where your dream car has appreciated beyond what you are capable or willing to spend. If that’s the case then I hope that you’d have an open mind to at least consider the possibility of trying a replica of that model – you might be as pleasantly surprised as I was."

thewholecar,3ajeia,DaaraJ,7,Sat Jun 20 19:47:28 2015 UTC,"Bob Sorrell was an artist who worked in aluminum and fiberglass, translating his one two-dimensional mechanical drawings into stunning automotive bodies. When his sleek aluminum SR-100 sports racer body debuted at a 1953 Petersen Motorama event, the overwhelmingly positive reception prompted Sorrell to create a fiberglass-bodied variant for production. Seven examples were originally constructed, but only six were delivered to customers; in July, the SR-100 that Sorrell kept for himself, the 1954 Sorrell-Manning Special, will cross the auction stage in Santa Monica, California.  Working with his father in a shop on Felton Avenue in Inglewood, California, Sorrell quickly earned a reputation as a man unafraid to tackle whatever challenges walked in the door. In the early 1960s, his craftsmanship caught the eye of “TV” Tommy Ivo, who hired Sorrell Engineering to fabricate the aluminum bodies on his Croshier-Baltes-Lavato and Barnstormer top fuel dragsters. Never one to turn down a challenge, Sorrell once bought the wreckage of a Lister Chevrolet that had been crashed and burned in a shunt at the 1960 Los Angeles Times Grand Prix, determined to transform a pile of scrap into a winning car. The Sorrell-Larkin Special never proved competitive, but its streamlined fiberglass body and patriotic red, white and blue livery were certainly memorable.  As Forgotten Fiberglass tells us, Sorrell relied upon the talents of others in the early part of his career. The first Sorrell body, a roadster made of aluminum, was crafted by California Metal Shaping circa 1953 and perched atop a Kurtis 500 KK chassis. Sorrell Engineering advertised it as “available soon” in period magazines, and quickly began offering fiberglass or aluminum SR-100 bodies, in roadster or gullwing coupe styles, to anyone interested. One early customer was reported to be Mickey Thompson,  who was said to have used a Sorrell body in the 1956 Mexican Road Race.   It isn’t clear how long production of the SR-100 lasted, but seven bodies are known to have been built. Six were delivered to customers, but the seventh never left the Sorrell Engineering shop. Ordered by “Laster and Pollard,” the fiberglass roadster SR-100 was built atop a Chuck Manning ladder-frame chassis, constructed of chrome-moly steel tubing. Like a funny car, the removable body was hinged at the rear, presumably to make access to key components and systems a bit easier.  Despite numerous purchase offers over the years, Bob Sorrell held onto the Sorrell-Manning Special until the time of his death in 2003. Found in a shipping container, the unfinished roadster passed through a string of buyers before attempts were made to finish the build and restore the body. Acquired by its current owners circa 2007, the Sorrell-Manning Special underwent a two-year restoration that ultimately involved the efforts of three individual shops.  Today, the car is finished in metallic blue paint, powered by a Chrysler Marine Hemi V-8 fed by a quartet of Zenith carburetors sitting on a genuine Cunningham intake manifold. The rusted Borrani wire wheels originally used on the car are gone, replaced by Halibrand replicas with knock-off caps, and the engine-turned dash with period-correct Stewart Warner gauges speak of the attention to detail given the build. Since the car’s 2010 debut, it’s been shown in the Petersen Museum’s “Fantasies in Fiberglass” exhibit and has earned best in class honors at both the Amelia Island Concours d’Elegance and the Keels and Wheels Concours d’Elegance.   Though the Sorrell-Manning Special lacks a provenance rich with celebrity ownership or competition glory, it remains a significant piece of Southern California automotive culture history. Auctions America is predicting a selling price between $175,000 and $225,000 when the car crosses the auction block in Santa Monica.   Source  More detailed write-up  Video"

thewholecar,3aeg2s,CorneliusVan,9,Fri Jun 19 18:36:18 2015 UTC,"I used to think the same thing, but you'd be wrong. We've become accustomed to engine bays with nice covers, where everything is clean and concealed and often stylized. We when look at pictures of older cars, they're from an era where cars were several orders of magnitude simpler, and everything is right there and it looks nice and easy.  Here is a 2003 Jaguar and here is a 1964 (or thereabouts) Jaguar.  The Lister Jag shown here is unique because it's from the eighties, where fuel injection was becoming mainstream but the stylized engine bay (often manifested in the form of a plastic cover) hadn't become common practice. The priority was to ensure that this new and more complicated system was easy to service, and part of this meant leaving everything out in the open.  Look at the modern Jag and this Lister again. Everything on this V12 is right there in the open, easy to get at. Putting everything on display makes it appear daunting, but once you actually have to do anything with it you realize quickly that it's a hell of a lot nicer than the modern stylized engine bay, which is often a claustrophobic nightmare under that pretty cover.  It's still a thirty year old twelve cylinder Jag, maintaining the thing isn't for the faint of heart by any means, but that spooky appearance is actually in your favour."

It was redesigned in 1997. This is a 2014, model GZG50, but hasn’t changed since 1997. It was designed to be slightly symmetrical when viewed from the side. Each car is painted with seven layers of paint, giving a sense of being lacquered.   It features the only V12 made in Japan, the 1GZ-FE V12. It’s a 5.0L that develops 310 hp and 460 Nm (340 lbf·ft), with over 400 Nm (300 lbf·ft) available from as little as 1200 rpm, but power isn’t the purpose of this engine, it’s extreme smoothness. So smooth that you can place a coin vertically on top of the running engine and it will not drop.   I think it’s a very interesting car, at least from the point of view of what the conservative Japanese consider luxury, although the car is not marketed as a sign of wealth and excess. For example, the seats are usually ordered in wool cloth instead of leather, as leather is squeaky, crochet curtains are preferred over tinted glass as tinted glass attracts suspicious looks. The car, being a limousine, it’s obviously focused on the passengers. It has massage seats, heated seats, cooled seats, and many more seat things. Check the pictures. The crochet covers are actually very common in Asia (specially in the south of China, including pillows on the rear window), and this particular car is used as a taxi. It’s a way of showing that the car is clean and cosy and tidy inside, in a very old-fashioned way.   The interior doesn’t scream luxury to me, and it’s not its intention, but every piece of wood you see is hardwood, the air vents are made of metal, every door has a metallic ashtray with an electric lighter (can you guess where the door handle is?), has a ton of Lexus LS parts (Lexus wasn’t sold as a brand in Japan until recently).  Something It doesn’t have is a tachometer. You don’t want your chauffeur going around screaming the engine.   Pictures from a Japanese blog, Hatena  If you are interested, here are a couple of videos, driving through a city from the driver’s POV and a second one on the highway.   And since it’s the only Japanese V12, you can hear it inside a tunnel here and here"

thewholecar,3a03a1,mxpower,4,Tue Jun 16 15:15:47 2015 UTC,"Hey man,   Don't sweat it with the photos. Yes, we aim for high quality and a certain format here - but not everyone is a photographer (plus car shows are tough to shoot at!) and we understand that.  IMO it's cooler to have some OC from regulars here, than perfect shots from manufacturers that we might have seen before.  Your album made me consider my stance on restorations vs preserving originality. I flip flop between the two in terms of my preference. Sometimes it is just the nicest thing in the world to see a perfectly shiny, repainted classic - a trip back in time to when it was first built. Then I see cars like this and just obsess over the natural patina that time has created, and think it's the best thing ever.  How about you?"
thewholecar,3a03a1,YouMustChill,3,Tue Jun 16 14:35:17 2015 UTC,"I really liked this car. I remember spending a lot more time with it than I did. One thing that I don't think I got well was the raisable limousine style center glass. Those horns pictured are for talking to your driver in the forward cab. The other fascinating thing about this model is that it was essentially the first modern car in the sense that it had a gas, brake and clutch pedal in the modern layout. The Ford model T had three pedals making it look recognisable, but despite reading about how to drive one several times, I still can't explain it.  I love an original car, but I also like shiny things. I wouldn't touch this one, but I enjoy the minute details that go into a good restoration. I think the decision comes down to what's obtainable. My Karmann Ghia is in rough shape, so it's getting a full rebuild. I would love to own a later Citroen DS, and if I got one, I'd look for a nice original. There's no way I want to replace that hydraulic system.  I'm not all that into customs, but can appreciate making something out of an otherwise un-restorable car. My idea of un-restorable is different than some though."

thewholecar,39wlhu,mxpower,7,Mon Jun 15 11:48:37 2015 UTC,"This is the updated model S version released in 69 with 100 produced. What a beautiful car, I dare say come close to the beauty of that era Ferrari 330/365.   Wiki  An updated Islero, dubbed the Islero S, was released in 1969. The engine in this model was tuned to 350 brake horsepower (260 kW; 350 PS), but the torque remained the same. There were quite a few styling changes, including brightwork blind slots on the front fenders, an enlarged hood scoop (which supplied air to the interior of the car, not the engine), slightly flared fenders, tinted windows, round side-marker lights (instead of teardrops on the original), and a fixed section in the door windows. Various other changes included larger brake discs, revised rear suspension and revamped dashboard and interior. The top speed of the S improved to 161 mph (259 km/h) and acceleration from zero to 60 mph 6.2 seconds.[3] Only 100 examples of the Islero S were built, bringing the production total of the Islero nameplate to 225 cars. Ferruccio Lamborghini himself drove an Islero during that era - as did his brother Edmondo."
thewholecar,39wlhu,superdude4agze,2,Mon Jun 15 14:53:53 2015 UTC,"It's actually the Islero 400 GTS (the standard one being the Islero 400 GT). Ferruccio considered this car the closest to his vision of what Lamborghini should be, and I think he got one right until his death, but I cannot remember where I read that.   The article below offers some insight on this car.

Evo:   The kit served an aerodynamic purpose — it was wind tunnel tested to reduce drag to 0.29, while at the same time increasing downforce.   That's actually very good for a blocky sedan."

thewholecar,39stvw,TheDynasty11,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:43:12 2015 UTC,"That got me thinking, so I checked some things.  The Evolution II had 40 hp over the M3 but the M3 had a ~ 200lb weight advantage.  Since the rule-of-thumb is 100lb = 10 hp, gearing could easily put an M3 over the top on a track.  I never drove an Evo but I did drive plenty of 190s and the difference between those cars and the 3-series of that era...they might as well have been aimed at different parkets entirely.  Hell, I would prefer a 1st-gen M3 even today; those things were a blast."
