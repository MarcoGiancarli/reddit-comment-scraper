NewSkaters,3e2fl9,MixeroPL,2,Tue Jul 21 13:04:50 2015 UTC,"Really depends how much you have. You can find a used one on craigslist or ask someone you know if they have a board for sale. There's even local guys and organizations around my surrounding cities/neighborhoods that'll hook kids up with boards for free, although  I don't know if you need that. If you have to get the cheapest brand new set up possible from a store/online, I started with a cheap company complete for $50-$60, and kept adding new parts over time.(bushings, then bearings, then trucks, etc.)"
NewSkaters,3e2fl9,smeer97,2,Tue Jul 21 14:48:11 2015 UTC,The mini logo blanks are good. Mine ~$20. I've ridden in rain with it and it's been rolling good for a year or so. No grinds so ymmv.

You can often fine direct-to-seller folks that will give you a cheap board for not too much. I've used funboxdist a bit (http://www.funboxdist.com/), and I know they ship internationally, but you might have a local shop that can do the same thing quite cheap.   Of course, the downside with something like funbox is they are perhaps going to have some lower quality stuff when it comes to their house trucks and wheels, but them and equivalent distributors will give you a cheaper setup to start with."

In store is also great as they will build your board for you if you don't know how to apply grip tape or don't have a skate tool or whatever.

Except I would go for Bones Reds bearings and also the Bones wheels you picked out are V5 which is used for ledges and bowls. If your just gonna be skating on flat ground with rocks and dirt I would get the V1 or V4. Go on the Bones STF website and read about the different versions.

NewSkaters,3dsegz,deadbolt39,3,Sun Jul 19 00:23:54 2015 UTC,"I am in no way a medical professional, and it might be an underlying medical issue but I imagine it's just because you're putting a lot of load and strain through your knees. I don't like to make assumptions but how much exercise do you do? If you lead quite a sedentary lifestyle you'll probably find that as you keep skating you'll strengthen the muscles in your legs and start to lose a bit of weight and things will get easier. Keep going, if you don't notice a change maybe check in with a doctor."
NewSkaters,3dsegz,J_Walter,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:52:06 2015 UTC,"I had some bad knee tendonitis for a bit after a lot of pushing. Had some bad technique for a while too. Advil, ice, and rest helps. Check you have a smooth push and not a violent kick. A visit to a doc might not hurt I'd only to get some good exercises to strengthen knee."
NewSkaters,3dsegz,vegimal18,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:37:43 2015 UTC,From my experience with knee injuries its more from too much impact in the wrong way if that makes sense. Perfect example was when i was trying no-complys down a stairset and hurt my knee from landing on my jumping foot constantly. Maybe you are pushing awkwardly and putting too much strain on it?
NewSkaters,3dsegz,hockeyfreak567,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:45:41 2015 UTC,Ur techniqe might need some cleaning up. When u push both ur feeet should be parrlel .as if u where walking. The foot in front on the board should pivit when u move to push and when u get back on.

I know I will, Because it's fun, exciting and can give a sense of freedom even to those who feel most trapped in their own lives or the life society/family expects of them.   Here's your tip: I fail. Often sometimes in front of people, but I smile say to myself ""that was fun"" or ""Woah"" and carry on about my business, because it is my business. why should I care what other people think about it?   If I smile and keep myself in good spirits, all they're gonna see is a bloke whos having fun. Funny thing about people; they're a lot like mirrors, I ain't ever felt bad for somebody whos smiling.  So do that. Some might even be envious."

NewSkaters,3dke5b,OMTH,3,Fri Jul 17 01:28:35 2015 UTC,"Know how you feel, got back into it a couple months ago too. I remember one scenario where I was skating in a car park and this car full of girls just stopped, they all got out. I thought they'd notice and got slightly self conscious... Next minute one of them pulls out a penny board and fumbles around, see's me skating, waves and says Hi. Ended up giving her some advice and helped her our a bit. Made my day."

But usually I'll just put the fact that I'm a n00b behind me and just have fun. Besides, I like this sense of freedom and cruising down the streets so I should enjoy myself right? I'll look stupid when I do a clumsy shit fall in front of others but it's stupid fun so why not?  Let's just go skate man, at least it's fun for us! Won't be that fun if we keep thinking what other people think of us and miss ourselves out on the fun!"

NewSkaters,3dke5b,V3ndeTTaLord,2,Fri Jul 17 09:34:55 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite things about skating is that, when you are doing it right, it demands 100% of your focus. When you find yourself worrying about other things in life, like what people around you think, look at the board, at your feet, at the ground under and ahead of you. Be totally and fully conscious of your core center of gravity, of every motion of your arms and legs. Focus only and completely on skating. Not only will your mind have no room for any other concerns, but your deep and complete focus will result in much better skating."
NewSkaters,3dke5b,isskewl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:59:52 2015 UTC,I initially had the same feeling. The thought of skating anywhere even near public spaces was unimaginable. Now I skate in the middle of the town where there are lots of people that I know very well. You know what I realized? No one gives a single fuck. No one.
NewSkaters,3dke5b,InsanelyStupidHorse,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:54:01 2015 UTC,"I have the same issue, I have been skating around the MAIN area in my town, where everyone goes to work, I still do it, I just ignore the cars and mess around, I still am not going to the skatepark because I don't believe I am good enough to do some of the things there, but I think its pretty fun just to ride around town :)"
NewSkaters,3dke5b,erucae,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:33:24 2015 UTC,When I feel self conscious I think this: 1. Is the person paying for my house? 2.

NewSkaters,3dke5b,SCBG,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:34:01 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way a lot of the time. I think it's partly down to the UK, and the fact it's not often you see someone skating.   I skate to work and back, through the town centre. I'll often pick up my board and walk if there's too many people around though. Not because I can't avoid them, but because I just feel self conscious. As I've gotten better I've tried skating more and more of the journey though, and on quieter days I'll do the whole thing now.   Just stick at it, it'll get better. I don't know what sort of board you ride either, but I use a Nickel sized Penny-esque board. I've got a regular trick deck, but I'm not as good with it, and it's a lot louder >_<"
NewSkaters,3dmdhs,Kalithres,2,Fri Jul 17 13:13:03 2015 UTC,"If you want to learn tricks, you won't be able to learn them on a longboard.  Just get a regular skateboard."
NewSkaters,3dmdhs,KanpaiWashi,2,Fri Jul 17 15:25:55 2015 UTC,"To be honest I wouldn't go with either of those. But if you got one of them already then you'll be fine, there are much worse things you could have done. You'll be happy either way! Here's something I threw together for you that is much better quality than what you're looking at though just in case.  Deck - http://www.skatewarehouse.com/Skate_Warehouse_Blank_V-Natural_Deck/descpage-SWNEDK.html I consider 8"" the most popular board size these days so that's what I'll recommend, but if you think you'd want something bigger just look up the proper size trucks for that particular deck.  Wheels - http://www.skatewarehouse.com/Spitfire_Formula_Four_Classic_99a_Wheels/descpage-SF4C9WH.html I recommend sizes between 50 and 54.  Trucks - http://www.skatewarehouse.com/Independent_Stage_11_Standard_Trucks/descpage-INELSTR.html You want the 139mm / 8""  trucks for an 8"" deck  Bearings - http://www.skatewarehouse.com/Bones_Reds_Bearings/descpage-BSREDBR.html  Bushings - http://www.skatewarehouse.com/Bones_Hardcore_Bushings_2_Trucks_Medium/descpage-BSHCMBBU.html Get these to replace the stock bushings that come with your trucks. These are important because stock Indy bushings are fucking awful.  Hardware - http://www.skatewarehouse.com/Independent_Phillips_Hardware/descpage-INPMH.html You want the 1"" hardware"
