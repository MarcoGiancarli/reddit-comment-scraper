mazda3,3dvkvo,By2Kaapi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:52:42 2015 UTC,"I know hindsight is 20/20 and all that but it's best just to stay your lane when you see someone driving like that in the rear view mirror. Assume the worst (drunk driver) and drive predictably. It's much harder for someone driving 100+ mph (drunk or otherwise) to make adjustments than it is for you.  This is also why the left lane is used for passing only. I don't mean to sound like a dick but the awkwardness could've been avoided altogether simply by obeying the law on your end. Yes, it's possible the drunk driver STILL could've crashed despite all your efforts, but it's best to do everything right on your end to keep make the situation as predictable as humanly possible (and to also get the law on your side if/when things do go wrong).  I'm glad you made it out safely and hope you have a speedy recovery. Definitely get checked out at a hospital, even if you think you feel okay. I also hope the drunk driver gets what she deserves."
mazda3,3dvkvo,Quistak,2,Wed Jul 22 11:35:14 2015 UTC,"Oh wow that is terrifying, and I'm glad you are ok and could walk away from that.  In my previous M3, I had a 2008 hatch - I was in a less serious, similar situation that you describe, in this case both of us were sober and it was just a bad decision on her part. I was coming up on a choke point where the highway splits. It's a 4 lane highway and the left is for the one that's changing, to stay on the one we were on - you stay to the right. I was in the second lane from the left because I wanted to get onto that other highway. A ford escape wanted to merge over on a curve and she merged into my passenger door and scraped up the side. We were going maybe 55 at the time. No airbag deployment and my car was dented and scraped but my airbags didn't deploy and because the impact point was the headlights of the escape's front left to my passenger door no glass shattering or anything. I had a ""fuck!"" moment but had the clarity to begin slowly merging over to the right and waited for the police to show up.  The lady was kind of spazzy and asked me if that scratch had ""always been there"" and that her blind spot monitor didn't tell her I was there, etc. Well yeah it wouldn't have because I was ahead of her. I thought she was going to flake out and blame me but she took full responsibility. We had the same insurance co so it was pretty easy to deal with, although the rental company gave me a dodge Avenger to drive for a week and that is one very 'meh' point a to b car.  Just a heads up - since you were not at fault, the record of your accident will go public in a few days and you may be inudated by lawyers and chiropractors etc. Ignore those ambulance chasers and get yourself checked by your own doctor / or ask people you know of any good ones. That was by far the worst part about dealing with my accident, my phone was blowing up for 2 weeks after that. I was fine and didn't need any medical treatments. They didn't care and wanted me to come in for an evaluation anyway.   Since your car will be totaled - Make sure if it wasn't a base model to let your insurance adjuster know and make sure they know about the safety features so you get a fair quote from them for your replacement. They should know but it's good to double check, you know what you have more than the insurance guy."

Is it advisable to walk out of such a deadly crash? What is the best thing to do if you do not feel any physical hurt but risk internal injuries? I have read on several forums not to move someone in a crash but instead let paramedics handle them since it can risk paralysis etc.

I sit down in the cockpit and everything (heads-up display,location of the nav. screen etc.) is oriented towards the driver, not something that looks like it was taken from a parts bin and slapped on because they had extra.

mazda3,3dq3dd,Arizhel,2,Wed Jul 22 12:47:16 2015 UTC,What makes you think that the quality will be any less than what Mazda is demanding of their Japanese plants?
mazda3,3dq3dd,CelestialBlueMyka,3,Sat Jul 18 15:20:12 2015 UTC,"This is still a new factory. The Japanese factory has been around much longer. VWs made in Germany are generally better bulilt than the same models from Mexico. Same with Fords and mexico vs Canada/us. Also note that they are not built exactly the same.

The cars just get on a train and they're in the US. For other businesses timezone and similar culture to the US are good reasons to operate here in MX.  Honda engines have been made in Jalisco for almost 20 years now and complete Accords/CRVs, Toyota makes tacoma pick ups in Baja California, Nissan/Renault has a huge factory and those are just the Japanese brands. And while I've also had bad experiences with a VW made in Puebla (that was an electronic mess, not withstanding that the parts that failed came in a box that said VAG and Made in Germany) there is an Audi plant nearing completion there too."

For other businesses timezone and similar culture to the US are good reasons to operate here in MX.   What ever gave you the idea that Mexico has a similar culture to the US?  It doesn't, it's extremely different.  Latin American cultures are particularist, whereas Germanic and English cultures are universalist.  That's why corruption is so rampant in Latin American countries: personal relationships are more important in those cultures than following rules, so corruption is endemic (e.g., your relative asks you to look the other way when he commits a crime; in a particularlist culture, you do, in a universalist culture you call the cops)."

I never said all Americans are drug users nor drinkers, but the products sell well in the US, otherwise the drug cartels would not have  the money they have nor would they go to all the trouble of selling their product there, there's a demand, so someone figured out how to supply it after it became too complicated to get it through the Caribbean.   Yes, for an American coming to Mexico there would be vast differences he'd have to get over (it's arguable and down to each person to see if that would be greater than in India or China, to mention other common outsourcing destinations) but from a Mexican side, we consume so many American products, have many US corporations and consume so much media that there would not be a big cultural shock if a Mexican is to work for an American, or goes to live to the US."

Currently, almost all of Mazda's profits on these cars is lost in shipping costs from Japan to North America. I expect their quality control to be as vigilant as ever, so their reputations don't take a hit."
mazda3,3dq3dd,NorjackNC,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:25:35 2015 UTC,Exactly. Building and then shipping from the other side of the Pacific Ocean is crazy expensive. It makes sense to set up manufacturing and distribution as close to your consumer as possible.  Mazda aren't idiots. I'm confident that making absolutely sure there were no manufacturing and assembly issues in Mexico was in their top three concerns.  They would also know that any misstep at a Mexico factory that was new would be a black eye for many years and hard to overcome.  Mazda is a small fish among car builders which to me means they would be even more careful than a big fish like Honda.  I'll have no reservations buying my new 2016 mazda3 iT later this year and I expect I'll see the VIN begin with 3
mazda3,3dq3dd,Arizhel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:41:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Building and then shipping from the other side of the Pacific Ocean is crazy expensive.    No, it isn't.  Have you not noticed how much cheap junk comes from China?  Shipping by ocean freight is ridiculously cheap, much cheaper than by rail, and orders of magnitude cheaper than truck.  Now of course, that's by ton-miles.  If you're shipping from northern Mexico to Texas, then it's cheaper than from Japan (where it needs to travel by ship across the Pacific, then by rail from California to Texas).  But if you're shipping from China to Germany, it's cheaper to ship by water than by rail across Asia.  Now, how the shipping costs from Mexico to California compare to Japan to California, I don't know, but it's probably in favor of Japan.  But to New York, it might be in favor of Mexico since you have to go all the way across the Pacific, through the Panama canal, and then up the east coast to NY, but that's still a long distance by train too; it might be cheaper to put the cars on a boat in Mexico and sail up the Atlantic coast.  Anyway, the point is, it isn't all that expensive to send bulk cargo by ship.  There's a good reason China is dominating low-cost manufacturing even though everything has to cross the Pacific, and why the same was true for Japan decades ago."
mazda3,3dq3dd,starh4wk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:39:26 2015 UTC,"Mazda had a big writeup about the Mexican plant in one of their Zoom Zoom magazines.

mazda3,3dgcoo,mishaco,0,Thu Jul 16 16:18:26 2015 UTC,140k is ~ 9 years of wear on a car.  And most cars don't make it that long.  If you wanted reliability then you should of gone with a manual.  The clutch is considered a wear item on a manual any anything over 50k is good.  The main issues with Automatics is that when they do start to go bad it's already to late.  Your choices are to try to rebuild the transmission or just replace it.

Unlike the sedan, where you can pop the trunk open from your remote or with a switch from the driver's side, the hatchback can only be opened when the doors are unlocked.

Second, Mazda just sent out postcards to everyone about updating to v55. They wouldn't spend all that time and money if the next big update was right around the corner. They would never encourage people to go to a dealership twice with such a short period for the same thing. Third, Mazda's version naming isn't like a lot of others. It's rarely a nice number. I doubt there will ever be a v60. They went from 27 to 29 to 31 to 33 to 51 to 53 to 55. I could go do the whole list, but I think you get the point. Fourth, I have been through the code in v55, as have many others and there is nowhere near enough code for android auto for it to run in any form.

I'll be sure to take a better pic next time I mess with it. As for mazda updating,  they updated due to a lot of complaints about the system. They keep rolling out with updates that have little bits of progress in some areas because they do a snapshot of their builds after correcting something major like their memory optimization after v33.  There actually is a pattern to their versioning .  Kind of like android versioning. And while there's not enough code stuff to get fully functional android,  it's certainly runnable to a certain point if you understand the dbus and mmui system.

As for android auto, It's terrible because of all the workarounds I had to do. It's a two part thing. The frontend runs on the car and interfaces to the backend that is installed on my phone through USB. It does remove all access including my steering wheel and commander knob buttons as I have not yet figured out how to interface them into the AA system.

mazda3,3db8bx,Slep,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:01:05 2015 UTC,Hood struts? That would be awesome. Any more details? How hard and how much?
mazda3,3db8bx,MarkVII88,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:03:31 2015 UTC,Corksport and Redline Tuning make ones for the Mazda 3. It's a 20 minute job if you're slow with a socket wrench. They're really easy to install. Corksport has an installation video on their website. The struts run ~$100 or less
mazda3,3db8bx,knotquiteawake,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:40:19 2015 UTC,"There's any number of relatively cheap mods that can improve the performance/handling/comfort of your new car.  You could upgrade to a Mazdaspeed3 rear sway bar or go with one from James Barone Racing to get better handling.  You could replace the OEM air filter with a drop-in replacement hi-flow filter from AEM or K&N.  If you need to run snow tires, put them on your OEM rims, sell your OEM all-seasons and put that money toward rims/tires you want for spring/summer.  If your car has an automatic transmission, install a transmission fluid cooler with in-line fluid filter.  As for other upgrades like exhaust, suspension, brakes I would get some of your money's worth out of the OEM components first.  If you're going to keep the car for a long time, I wouldn't worry about paying extra for these items until the original components have done some miles."
mazda3,3db8bx,coopsux,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:15:17 2015 UTC,If you're not driving hard all the time is there a distinct advantage to transmission coolers?
mazda3,3db8bx,MarkVII88,2,Thu Jul 16 20:04:51 2015 UTC,"extending the life of your transmission by ensuring it gets cooled independent of the engine temp, also increasing your capacity for atf which is nice for peace of mind. personally i wish I'd installed one a long time ago, i regularly watch my atf temps hover above 200F which is when there's a danger of overheating and unless you use higher quality fluid, when you can expect it to start breaking down (the fluid, that is)"
mazda3,3db8bx,CapedNate,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:34:53 2015 UTC,"On the Mazdas247 forum that I belong to, there are a lot of references to transmission fluid wearing out much sooner than one would expect.  Perhaps this is only applicable to the non-Skyactive transmissions on the older MZR engines (2.0L, 2.3L, 2.5L).  Trans fluid warms up very quickly, even in cold weather areas, so a cooler would help keep your operating temps below coolant temp levels.  Your fluid will last longer and the car will shift smoother."

Tint the windows and replace the paper filter with a quality reusable filter.  Now, that being said, if I didn't already have a supercharged Mustang, I would probably be very interested in any turbo options for this car."
mazda3,3dcpbm,Travno1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:25:11 2015 UTC,"For reference, here's my car. I looked into upgrading the horn and tinting today. Oddly, the horn would cost more to have done than the tinting. I'm also kinda on the fence on whether I should tint all my windows (including windshield) or just do the sides and rear. In NJ, the law is you can't have the front side windows or the windshield tinted. I'm kind of thinking it will look stupid if I do half the car. And if I do the front windows, I'd already be breaking the law so I might as well do the windshield too. Not sure if having the rear and sides only done would look bad.  I am also not feeling the door edge covers the dealership put on. I think I might remove those. The color on them is slightly off and they look kind of weird. What do you guys things?"
mazda3,3dcpbm,Travno1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:32:25 2015 UTC,"I would probably do tint (even if you can only tint the back...that's pretty common...it's not ideal, but you're stuck in your state), maybe the mud/splash guards, and maaaaybe chrome door handle covers. If you don't have them, get the fog lights. They look great!"
mazda3,3dcpbm,Nixdaboss,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:39:59 2015 UTC,"The decals and chrome accents IMHO are at best temporary enhancements. If you like them that much though, go for it especially since they're probably easily reversible and cheap. In the 90's when import automobiles experienced a boom, I was tempted to deck out my car with decals but would've regretted it later. Glad I didn't follow that trend. I always think to myself, ""Would I still want that in a few years?"" Even the window tinting I have an issue with, since a good number out there are poor quality hack jobs or don't last long enough. Plus it impacts night time visibility and risks damage to the rear defroster upon removal or reapplication. If you live in a really hot place it might be worth it though.  If you want ideas for other worthwhile (again, IMHO) mods let me know and I can list some."

And they are actually cheaper than buying from amazon so i bought them... That and the dealer threw in free instalation. I also bought them (yakima over thule) because im already invested in yakima... Aka i have yakima bike racks and kayak racks already. Honestly idk if i could install yakima mounts on thules never tried or bothered to look up but whatever looks good to keep it the same imo.

I think the silver cross bars look tacky, not the rack itself. That's just imo though and my 3 is dark blue so I want black. I'll check into the oem because it is a lot cheaper than what I'm seeing at Thule and Yakima websites. $199 on the Mazda website vs. $400 for a nice Thule rack."

It says:   Users with mixed entertainment favorites (FM/AM/XM) can now switch between their favorites in the same order that they’re listed on the Mazda Connect display using the steering wheel control buttons.    Does that mean if I am listening to XM, and my favorites include both XM & FM channels, when I cycle between my favorites using the steering wheel controls that I will get switched between XM & FM as the channels come up? As opposed to now where it only changes between XM presets when on XM and FM only when on FM.   If that is the case, that sounds annoying!"

mazda3,3d2sar,pattheslat,7,Mon Jul 13 01:48:46 2015 UTC,When this question came up for me when I was looking for a new car.. It really came down to do i really need AWD haha.  Turns out I didnt so I stuck with the Mazda cause it drove better and cause i hate CVT. Also what kind of winters are we talking about
mazda3,3d2sar,CorruptedFox,7,Mon Jul 13 01:59:13 2015 UTC,"I know this isn't an accurate comparison to the cars you looked at, but I've got a 2012 skyactiv 3 hatch and my coworker has an STI wagon. Obviously very different cars. His subaru is a lot smaller, and doesn't get nearly the same mileage. We both agree the mazda isn't really any less fun to drive. I've had to drive 200+ miles through ice storms and as long as you've got good tires fwd is fine.   However, for really long commutes, I don't like my mazda. Seats are hard, it's loud, and the ride is rough. I wish I'd have got what my brother did, a jetta tdi. Yeah, it's more expensive, but it's got a much nicer ride. The diesel is REALLY fun to drive, and even accounting for the higher cost of diesel, it has about the same cost per mile as my skyactiv."
mazda3,3d2sar,ElbrusEldarkhanov,5,Mon Jul 13 02:51:05 2015 UTC,"when i was buying my car, it came down to a 2014 impreza and 2015 mazda3 for me as well and it was a difficult choice. the overall decision came down to this: the impreza just felt so much more ""basic"". i didn't really like the look of the interior and it lacked the bells and whistles that we could get for a similar price in the mazda3 i touring model with the tech package. from what i remember, there wasn't a backup camera in the trim level of the subaru we were looking at, and that plus the blind spot monitoring on the mz3 were HUGE selling points. plus the touchscreen infotainment system, bose speakers, and sunroof!  it didn't help that subarus are just in super high demand in my area, so much so that there were only like 3 or 4 hatchback models in the whole metro area (due to the 2015 not being released yet and the 2014s being scarce). so there was very little room for negotiation on price (whereas we were able to negotiate down pretty far with the mazda dealer), and we had very limited options when it came to trim levels and colors.  we really liked both of them, and were very happy with the performance and efficiency on both. overall, it came down to either getting the tech and a sportier look or the AWD and a more basic look, and the tech won out. for what it's worth, we didn't have a single problem driving last winter in the snow with the FWD. i do not regret the choice in the slightest! however, i will say that the seats in the mz3 are not the best for long drives. i've done four 7 hour drives in the last month, and the lack of lumbar support in the seats makes for a very sore back by the end of it."

mazda3,3d2sar,Bonneville865,4,Mon Jul 13 02:50:37 2015 UTC,"Living in Wisconsin, I was pondering the same question.  Ultimately, I decided that I wasn't going to choose my everyday driver on the basis of a few days a year.  Living in an urban area not too far from major arterials, most of what I drive on is heavily salted.  Taking AWD out of the discussion made my choice easy.  I liked the more luxurious feel of the Mazda 3.  I opted for the hatchback grand touring model, which gave me leatherette seats, navigation, and the dealer threw in remote start.  I liked the tight handling around curves, quick breaking, and more modern design of the Mazda 3.  I drive a lot for work, so cabin design was key for me.  I liked that everything felt ergonomic, and that it had features that mattered to me - 2 USB ports, dual zone climate control, and backup/turning sensors.  Ultimately it is personal choice.  One thing that pushed me over the edge was the positive reviews, such as these:   http://www.caranddriver.com/features/best-small-cars-2015-editors-choice-for-best-compact-and-small-cars#ec15top http://blog.caranddriver.com/the-best-car-interior-available-for-under-30000-is-in-a-mazda/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9auTt2FCAyM"
mazda3,3d2sar,pgrit154,3,Mon Jul 13 03:46:57 2015 UTC,"I thought about an Impreza before I got my 2014 s Touring. AWD is nice, especially since I live in the northeast, but I decided I would rather drive the Mazda 99 days out of 100. Also a 2014 Impreza has a worse horsepower-to-weight ratio than the 2001 Civic I replaced, and is lower to the ground than the Mazda3.  That said, my wife has a Honda Pilot that is actually pretty damn good on snow. If I really felt I had to drive on any day of the year in my own car, I would have gotten a Subaru XV, since it is just an Impreza with a more appropriate amount of ground clearance."
mazda3,3d2sar,RalphieRed,3,Mon Jul 13 02:53:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if it's applicable, but for the models I was comparing, Subaru's had over double the cost of insurance.  It might just be my location/model/etc, but it was my biggest reasoning.  More minor reasons... My Speed3 is my 3rd Mazda...  The first two were the most fun to drive cars I've had, and my AWD Eclipse had the turning radius of a dead goat (and I live on a court).  Subaru might have been better, but all these things combined, I didn't bother to test drive one."
mazda3,3d2sar,Qix213,3,Mon Jul 13 15:41:50 2015 UTC,"I just recently bought my Mazda3 hatch. You're impression comaring the two are spot on. The Mazda has better gas mileage, has faster acceleration, and has a nicer/more minimal interior. Those factors were important to me. Plus I think the Mazda 3 just looks nicer, and that it's would be something I would be happy to see day after day.   Where the Subaru excels is it's ride and suspension. When I test drove it it felt like it rolled less in sharp turns and had slightly quicker steering response. AWD drive is also a plus but I had to admit to myself that i didn't need it. My car is a commuter car and for the very few days where it might be nice in snow or going up to the mountain, it just wasn't worth it for me.   In ended up going with the Mazda3 iTouring model without the technology package (plus door sils, wheels locks, auto-dimming mirror, and all weather mats) and got my car for 19800 after some hard bargaining. At that trim you get the backup camera, and blind-spot monitoring along with leather steering wheel and shift knob.   So far, I'm very happy with my choice after driving with it for a month."
mazda3,3d2sar,Slep,2,Tue Jul 14 00:01:45 2015 UTC,"I feel like I am in the exact same dilemma and I'm having such a tough time deciding. I've been a Mazda person since I was little (I currently have a 2003 Mazda Tribute with 217k on it), with my family always having driven them, but I do spend a lot of time driving in snowy, crappy conditions (I live in Colorado and snowboard about 50 days a year). My boyfriend has a Subaru STI that has been reliable and fun to take to the mountains, so I've been considering an Impreza simply for the AWD in getting to work and possibly to take up there. But I just can't get over how much I love the Mazda 3 hatch, the slightly bigger engine, and the upgrades inside. I'm inclined to think that a dedicated set of snow wheels would be sufficient, but it makes me a bit nervous not having AWD after having driven it for the past 10 or so years. I would love more input here from current 3 drivers regarding snow driving :)"

Mazda also offers a 2.5L with about 30-35 more horsepower. For me, that was the deciding factor, honestly. But I live in California. If I still lived in Wisconsin, I'd probably have gotten the AWD Subaru (plus it'd be less likely to rust out from the salted roads than the Mazda)."

The only thing I could think of that would be 'normal' would be if there was a lot of rust build-up on the rotors from oversea transport and that just needed to be worn off with some driving.

mazda3,3d2k6u,momfoundmycumsock,2,Mon Jul 13 01:18:03 2015 UTC,"I'd just look up on your state's DMV website and/or state/county traffic court website what the process is and go from there.  In CA it is get ticket-->if you don't fight, pay the 'bail'-->take online class-->done.  Taking the class means your insurance company doesn't know you got a ticket, and so long as you don't get another one in the following 18mos (might be 24mos now?) they won't find out."
mazda3,3d2k6u,miataman85,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:26:15 2015 UTC,Probably $200-$300 fine (of which only like $70 is for actually speeding) and very little impact on your insurance.

mazda3,3cyuvq,paps511,4,Sun Jul 12 00:55:19 2015 UTC,"It's a named feature in the smart start guide, either pressing and holding it or pressing repeatedly will turn it off, for use in the case of emergencies. How would this be useful? i.e. if accelerator pedal gets stuck or engine starts smoking/sets on fire and needs to be shut off immediately. It's smart enough to not turn off when you press it one or two times."

mazda3,3cxwha,frazzbot,3,Sat Jul 11 19:39:49 2015 UTC,I've had my 2012 since brand new with only two top screws on each plate and I haven't had any rattles or scratches. It's really not a big deal OP.
mazda3,3cxwha,haveyouseenthe,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:44:34 2015 UTC,"I've had plates on my '15 since day one, and I haven't heard any rattling at all.  If it were a problem, I'm sure Mazda would have done something about it."
mazda3,3cxwha,Arizhel,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:02:22 2015 UTC,Funny - I just put a new alumni frame on my new 2015 not 15-min ago!    I just made sure the two bolts were nice and tight and gave it a shake and it did not budge a bit.
mazda3,3cxwha,Abide_or_Die,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:52:50 2015 UTC,"mine doesn't budge either, but the metal plate and the bottom half of the frame aren't quite sitting flush against the body of the car."
mazda3,3cxwha,Spruce_Wayne,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:06:38 2015 UTC,"I only know about the rear, and I'm not sure where to get the screws since I took mine from the front since I'm not required to have a front license plate. All I did was use a drill to screw the bottom of the plate down after the top screws were in place. No pilot holes or anything required. I would check Lowe's or Home Depot for the screws.  Edit: I have a 2012 BTW"
mazda3,3cxwha,miataman85,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:01:26 2015 UTC,"I have never had a car (eight so far, including my wife's) that had all four bolt holes (front or rear) and I've never had scratching from the plate/frame with only the top two holes in use."
mazda3,3cxwha,jswift79,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:30:43 2015 UTC,i have a 2012 mazda3.   i stripped one of the achors that holds the screw.   i used expoxy to fill the hole and a self tapping stainless screw to hold the tag
