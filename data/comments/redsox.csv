Frankly, with the recent talk of MLB expansion teams to cities like Montreal and Charlotte, I can't help but think that Boston would be a more successful Baseball-City than these other options, even though we already have a AL team. Its nothing against those other cities, but some cities are big on Baseball, some are big on football, etc. and Boston is definitely a city full of people who love baseball, so I think that a NL team would have success in Boston.  Also, as long as its not like they move the Tampa Bay Rays to Boston, if they create a new, Boston-original team, I will gladly cheer for it, because I cheer for all things Bostonian."

redsox,3e0j5a,mcorcoran3,-1,Tue Jul 21 20:32:17 2015 UTC,"When guys like Dan Roche, had them written off well before the Yankee series, saying all he wanted to see was competitive baseball for the rest of 2015. It's hard to believe what you're trying to say, it's Dan Roche, he literally wears Sox pajamas to bed. His wedding was Red Sox/baseball themed.   BUT, back in June people like Buster Olney (ESPN), Bradford (NESN/WEEI), Caron (NESN), Arnold (WEEI) were all still on The Red Sox hype train, they were spewing verbal diarrhea that was fed to them from the team. Which leads me to believe that the media played a huge role in conning most Sox fans into thinking they were wearing the emperors new clothes."
redsox,3e0j5a,secreted_uranus,-1,Tue Jul 21 10:22:30 2015 UTC,My dude Eduardo got lit up again.. Smh I can't believe it I had I hopes for this kid. I hope he can get his head right .
redsox,3e2y0s,YardGoats,20,Tue Jul 21 15:35:51 2015 UTC,"Only the saddest, most pie-in-the-sky fans think there's any trade value to be had in any of the veterans on this roster. We're stuck in hold-steady mode."
redsox,3e2y0s,omglolitsjf,6,Tue Jul 21 16:42:19 2015 UTC,"I think that there are several teams that would probably be interested in Koji, with his contract ending next year I would be open to it as well."
redsox,3e2y0s,tenbuckbeer,2,Tue Jul 21 16:48:16 2015 UTC,"Speier's latest Globe article is saying we should trade older vets for whatever we can get to let the young guys play. Think Peavey and Drew last year. Send off Naps, Vic, De Aza, various relievers, make room for JBJ, Castillo, Owens, Craig or Shaw, Kelly in the bullpen. Basically even if they don't have trade value we still might move some guys who won't be back next year anyway."
redsox,3e2y0s,d-cent,2,Tue Jul 21 17:52:59 2015 UTC,Peavy and drew had some value. Nap and vic have none. If we could even get a ptbnl that would be amazing
redsox,3e2y0s,tenbuckbeer,2,Tue Jul 21 18:11:57 2015 UTC,"Drew didn't really, it was a swap of contracts for someone we didn't need. Peavy didn't get us much either, it was mostly a salary dump for us. I'd expect less but similar for Napoli or Vic, we pay most of their contract or absorb someone else's bad contract who we cut, they go to a team who can use an extra part who has been good in the past and maybe could get hot again for them."
redsox,3e2y0s,mcorcoran3,2,Tue Jul 21 18:27:46 2015 UTC,"The return for Peavy wasn't horrible. It was two of the Giants top 10 pitching prospects. Not great prospects, but not a bad return."

redsox,3e2y0s,nhmo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:35:28 2015 UTC,"Everyone forgets how much the market has changed since they added a second wildcard spot. The trade deadline will always be a seller's market. You might think that some of these vets have no trade value, but we honestly don't know that. With more clubs in the mix, they might be willing to do something we don't expect."
redsox,3e2y0s,FrankDelano,6,Tue Jul 21 21:46:47 2015 UTC,"We have no one to sell. Maybe Koji? No one is going to take our underperforming, overpaid scrapheap vets. Even for free."
redsox,3e2y0s,LansdowneStreet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:37:10 2015 UTC,"Koji's a solid closer but the market for closers is already overloaded.  If we ""sell"" it would be someone like a Hanley Ramirez who has been good for us at the plate but might cause a contender to overpay in search of a DH.  And I don't think that plan is either likely or a great idea."
redsox,3e2y0s,thekraken108,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:41:56 2015 UTC,A team might want Koji for a 7th or 8th inning guy though.

redsox,3e2y0s,LansdowneStreet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:11:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying trade him just to get rid of him, but if someone offers you something good why not?    No no, that's fine, I just don't think anyone's going to offer anything of any real value.  If they do, great, and if it gives Koji a chance to help another playoff team even better.  But I just doubt it's going to happen.   probably more than most of the rest of the team.   Probably, but if we really want to sell we should see if anyone's willing to make an attractive offer for Ramirez or Sandoval.  I like Sandoval a lot and Ramirez is entertaining, but if we're going to get a useful player for the future it'll probably require unloading someone like that."
redsox,3e2y0s,thekraken108,2,Tue Jul 21 21:13:37 2015 UTC,Unless we can trick the Dodgers again I think they're untradable without eating most of their contracts.

redsox,3e2y0s,mcorcoran3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:16:04 2015 UTC,"We should sell parts if we can but the problem is our GM sucks at selling.

redsox,3e2y0s,GrapeRello,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:15:20 2015 UTC,"That Lackey trade still makes me shake my head. He's pitching for $500,000 with a 2.9something ERA. While Craig and and Kelly are kicking around in AAA with Rusney on what has to be one of the AAA teams with the highest payroll."

redsox,3e2y0s,lawlrhus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:01:25 2015 UTC,"3.26 ERA with a much lower FIP looks pretty good to me this year. The rest of his stats don't look that bad either. Can he stay healthy all the time? No, but he certainly can pitch still."
redsox,3e2y0s,OhRatFarts,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:16:32 2015 UTC,2013.
redsox,3e2y0s,lawlrhus,2,Tue Jul 21 17:40:58 2015 UTC,"What about it? He pitched lights out and then got injured. To me it seems he's a bit brittle, but that doesn't mean he's a bad pitcher and we should trade him."
redsox,3e2y0s,OhRatFarts,3,Tue Jul 21 17:46:02 2015 UTC,"His injury was day-to-day, then just a quick DL stint, then he didn't come back to September.  When he's healthy, he's a great pitcher, but he's only had 3 seasons where he hasn't been on the DL for an extended period.  If it'd be up to me, I'd offer him a contract reflecting his abilities yet safe enough for the team, say $15M/yr gauranteed + $500k a start beyond 16 or so.  I think we could get creative to keep him yet minimize the risk."
redsox,3e2y0s,lawlrhus,2,Tue Jul 21 18:30:57 2015 UTC,I think something like that would be a pretty solid idea.
redsox,3e2y0s,mcorcoran3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:20:29 2015 UTC,He is not a bit britle. He is made of glass.
redsox,3e2y0s,LansdowneStreet,0,Tue Jul 21 20:21:47 2015 UTC,"You know, if he comes back he's our #1 starter, and we're not just giving him that in name only.  I would much rather have Clay Buchholz right now than Cole Hamels or Jon Lester, all things considered."
redsox,3e2y0s,Diomedes413,3,Tue Jul 21 17:42:47 2015 UTC,Are you serious? Clay Buchholz over Lester or Hamels. WTF are you smoking?
redsox,3e2y0s,LansdowneStreet,-3,Tue Jul 21 18:16:59 2015 UTC,WTF are you smoking?   Look up the numbers.  This year he's pitched flat-out better.
redsox,3e2y0s,nottonywisconsin,4,Tue Jul 21 18:22:54 2015 UTC,"Lester is on pace to hit the 30 start/190 inning mark again for the eighth straight season. As much as I enjoy watching Buchholz pitch when he's on, Clay has never hit either of those milestones. Not one time.  34 Lester starts are ultimately going to give you more value than 18 Buchholz ones, no matter how good they are."
redsox,3e2y0s,LansdowneStreet,-3,Tue Jul 21 19:25:26 2015 UTC,"Every year those Lester starts are going to get worse and they're already on their way this year.  He's had his moments alright, but his overall numbers are down in a division where, all things considered, they should be headed in the opposite direction.  I like the guy and advocated signing him this past offseason.  But if we had done that, we would regret it.  Buchholz on his contract is more valuable to this team than Lester would be on his.  Imagine this team with Jon Lester in the rotation.  Better?  Yeah.  Out of the cellar?  I'm not so sure."
redsox,3e2y0s,mcorcoran3,2,Tue Jul 21 19:27:14 2015 UTC,"Clay is getting old too though. He is on the wrong side of 30. So they both will decline in time, but Lester will get you almost 200 innings and is a guy you can trust in the playoffs. Buch has amazing stuff but never lasts and is not trustworthy.   The only thing better is Buch's salary, but given he only pitches half a season, they make a comparable amount per start."
redsox,3e2y0s,LansdowneStreet,0,Tue Jul 21 20:21:03 2015 UTC,"So they both will decline in time   No no no, I'm not saying ""in time.""  I'm saying right now.  Jon Lester is on the decline.  Right now.  He will never be as good again as he was in 2013, and honestly before 2013 we would never have spoken about him in these terms.  You're right, he'll get you 200 innings.  200 pretty solid innings this year, he's not 2013 Lester or even 2014 Lester (where his trustworthiness in the playoffs got the Athletics eliminated in one game) but he's still good.  Next year?  200 solid innings, maybe.  After that?  200 innings, but Rick Porcello's going to give us 30+ starts at this rate too.    Again, this is hindsight.  At the time I was for keeping Lester too.  But, with all respect due to a guy who pitched pretty damn well and still can, looking at it now I think we're better off.  Certainly, all other things being equal, Jon Lester would not be putting us in first place this year.     The only thing better is Buch's salary,   Actual 2015 statistics, too.  And honestly, we're talking about the 15-day DL right now.  Suppose he misses three starts.  Unforgivable, right?"
redsox,3e2y0s,mcorcoran3,2,Tue Jul 21 20:41:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he puts up good numbers sometimes but can't last a season. Lester and Hamels put up 200 innings no problem - -Clay is 30 and has never done it."
redsox,3e2y0s,sirhumphry,4,Tue Jul 21 20:19:18 2015 UTC,Then you are an idiot. Without fail year after year bucholtz gets injured after 11 games. You can't be an ace if you can't play a season
redsox,3e2y0s,LansdowneStreet,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:09:32 2015 UTC,Which is fine since neither Lester or Hamels is looking like the kind of guy I'd send up against Chris Sale these days.
redsox,3e2y0s,GrapeRello,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:23:26 2015 UTC,"General Manager /u/graperello is putting Koji, Tazawa, Oganda, Wade, Kelly on the block for pitchers. Victorino, Napoli, De Aza, Swayheart, Checini (sp?),Allen Craig Brock Holt (yeah I said it), Jackie Bradley JR for hitters. I'm sure I'm forgetting some other players and prospects but those are some off the top of my head. I would also put Hanley, Pablo, Porcello, and Rusney Castillo on the block b/c I'm not a fan of those signings at all. Rusney really scares me.  I would like a young pitcher who is under control, but so doens't every other team in the league haha. Danny Salazar, Sonny Gray, and a few others would be on my radar but no idea if they're even on the market. I would certainly be open to listen to almost anything. I would be interested in another Dodgers like trade that works as a get out of jail free card. B/c I think they have some really bad contracts right now"

I grew up poor and I just haven't been able to justify spending money recently :/ I had three surprise surgeries this year and three unrelated severe infections. So I haven't been able to work, which has been incredibly frustrating. Mostly because our power was shut off a few times but also I am just really sick of being stuck living in my mom's house, eating her food, when I KNOW she can't afford to support me. Feel pretty guilty about that. Id take either her or my brother with me to the game. In good news, my mom recently got the all clear on the cancer front after her two tumors were removed! And my brothers sudden seizures seems to be under control. There were a few months this winter when I was sure I was going to lose the two most important people to me in the same year. Now things are starting to look up, I'm feeling a lot better, and it would be amazing to celebrate with a sox game!  Edit: though, now that I think about it, you may not want to give me the tickets. All four games I've been to we've lost 9-4, so I may be cursed. Wanted to be totally honest :P"

redsox,3e4nxb,Solar24,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:43:39 2015 UTC,"This is exactly it. I remember calling to trade koji last year after his great first half and we begun to tank out.

redsox,3e4nxb,s1apshot,3,Tue Jul 21 23:47:58 2015 UTC,"Jackie Bradley Jr., there is no debate that his defense is amazing but I have very little faith in his bat coming around. I say move him now in a package for a starting pitcher or prospect who could boost our rotation in the near future. I really don't want to wait on his value to depreciate to the point where we just option him so someone else will take him.    I would also say if we can move Koji or Victorino for someone of value pull the trigger. I don't think either has much left in their tank so get something before we get nothing.    Craig can go too if someone wants him, at least we wouldn't have to pay him anymore"
redsox,3e4nxb,DatabaseCentral,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:19:06 2015 UTC,"Jackie Bradley Jr., there is no debate that his defense is amazing but I have very little faith in his bat coming around.   I have not much faith in his bat coming around, and right now I would debate what to do. He is tearing it up in AAA. My plans I would trade De Aza, Victorino, Holt and call up JBJ for RF with the starting job.  But that is a gamble. If JBJ doesn't perform in the major leagues after tearing it up in AAA, his value depletes hugely from what it is at this moment.  I would roll the dice on it, but hey, what do I know, I thought Allen Craig could bounce back.   Craig can go too if someone wants him, at least we wouldn't have to pay him anymore   Should be noted, him not in the 40 man roster, his contract he is due isn't on the team Payroll. He doesn't affect us much."
redsox,3e4nxb,s1apshot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:47:26 2015 UTC,We still have to actually pay him though
redsox,3e4nxb,DatabaseCentral,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:48:51 2015 UTC,But doesn't effect the luxury tax and stuff iirc. That is beneficial even though we have to pay it. Our owners can afford it. It doesn't really affect how much we can spend.
redsox,3e4nxb,DatabaseCentral,2,Tue Jul 21 23:50:06 2015 UTC,"Holt.  Koji.  Victorino.  De Aza.  I'd expect back a good prospect for Koji. I'd hope for a good reliever from Holt. Prospect for Victorino. PTBNL from De Aza  Other trade options, unlikely to be traded:  Steven Wright  Tommy Layne  Robbie Ross Jr.  And I'd do anything to have someone take Napoli."
redsox,3e4nxb,DatabaseCentral,5,Tue Jul 21 22:54:52 2015 UTC,"No way I'd trade Holt.  Especially not for a relief pitcher.  He's on pace for a 3 WAR season, which just about the max you could expect from a reliever, and Holt could easily get better (he's just entering his prime). Plus he hasn't even hit arbitration yet and he plays every position.  Also, the teams we're looking to be dealing with are the ones that are in contention, and they aren't going to want to give up major league talent, especially not a dependable reliever.        I'd have to see the return before I traded Koji. We might need him next year.        Absolutely trade Victorino if you can. He's had a lot of trouble staying on the field the last few years, and his production has been hit-or-miss when he's healthy, and he's lost a step or two on the basepaths and in the field, and he is no longer a switch-hitter, so his value is limited. But, with all the younger players we have looking for time in the outfield, we have no use for him anymore.        De Aza is probably our best trade chip. He won't fetch much, but a lot of teams are going to be interested in him, with the way he's played since he got to Boston.        Wright and Layne are cheap and under team control for a while. Why trade players that could help us win in the next few years? They're not going to bring back anything more valuable than they already are.        Ross has been pretty awful. Maybe he lost something when Texas tried to cover him to a starter, but the change of scenery certainly didn't help him find it. I'm sure someone will take a flyer on him though, everyone is hungry for bullpen help.        I would trade Napoli for a bag of balls and a bucket of Double Bubble, just to get some thing for him, anything, instead of just letting him walk at the end of a lost season."
redsox,3e4nxb,NUKEFreeman,3,Tue Jul 21 23:06:19 2015 UTC,"Holt could easily get better (he's just entering his prime). Plus he hasn't even hit arbitration yet and he plays every position. Also, the teams we're looking to be dealing with are the ones that are in contention, and they aren't going to want to give up major league talent, especially not a dependable reliever.   Holt could easily get worse too. He's 27 years old. His prime isn't much. He isn't adding power this late in the game. He is a solid hit producer, and that is great.. but to utilize him as utility he'd be on the bench 5 days a week. Other teams will pay him to be a starter. His years of control increase his value.  And some major league teams will do some stupid things at the deadline. If Royals needed a guy to replace Omar Infante, wouldn't one of their bullpen pieces be effective as a trade piece? Especially with the surplus? Of course that isn't probably who we would trade with and probably not the value Holt would command. It's just a hypothetical.  Value isn't necessarily how good a player is, it goes to team need. If the team has a surplus of relievers, they are more likely to trade one in order to address another area of need. Red Sox have a surplus of some offensive players (OF crowded, Holt doesn't have a position) so we are more likely to trade them for areas of need (First base, relief pitching, starting pitching)   I'd have to see the return before I traded Koji. We might need him next year.   You're right we might need him next year. If we trade Koji my backup plans include trying to trade for Tyler Clippard, Francisco Rodriguez, Aroldis Chapman, David Robertson, Craig Kimbrel. Many closers you could go after. Then if all fails, Jokim Soria is a free agent.    Wright and Layne are cheap and under team control for a while. Why trade players that could help us win in the next few years? They're not going to bring back anything more valuable than they already are.   I said unlikely to trade them. It depends what you are offered in return. If someone needs a lefty specialist, Tommy Layne is serviceable and could command a nice return. If someone wants a #5 starter or a long relief, Steven Wright is a good option for someone. He isn't in our future plans.  But depends on return.  And I agree with you analysis on Napoli."
redsox,3e4nxb,DatabaseCentral,2,Tue Jul 21 23:36:18 2015 UTC,Someone doesn't seem to like your opinions in this thread.
redsox,3e4nxb,NUKEFreeman,3,Tue Jul 21 23:39:16 2015 UTC,People don't like the thought of trading Holt. I seriously don't see a starting spot for him. Is his value he holds right now > the value he holds as a utility player in 2016? The answer is yes. His current value is greater than playing 2 games a week for the Sox. So I'd like to cash in on it.
redsox,3e4nxb,NUKEFreeman,2,Tue Jul 21 23:42:04 2015 UTC,And I'm right there with you.
redsox,3e4nxb,DatabaseCentral,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:43:30 2015 UTC,Holt is no where near as good of a player as you make him out to be.
redsox,3e4nxb,NUKEFreeman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:08:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah. People seem to think bad of relievers or something. And they overrate Holt. Holt plays every single position. It's incredible. He could be an excellent, one of the best utility players, but right now he is showing he could be a starter for some team. That brings value.   In my opinion a good solid reliever is more important to this team moving forward than Brock Holt is. Relievers are extremely important. Look how it is helping Yankees to leading this division. The Royals are defending AL Champs because of their dominating bullpen. Astros came out of nowhere because they have a great bullpen.  Brock Holt is a good player and would be an excellent utility player for this team.. but utility player isn't everyday. As much as you want to believe it, Hanley is starting majority of games in left, Mookie is almost an everyday centerfielder, Pandas everyday at third, pedroia is everyday at 2B, Bogaerts is everyday SS.. and it leads to Holt only getting the chance to start twice a week max and only long term when there is an injury. He's too valuable for that role, so trade him for something we can utilize and we can get another utility player up.   Marrero could potentially fill that utility player role."
redsox,3e4nxb,slapadastic,2,Tue Jul 21 23:24:40 2015 UTC,"Especially with the shape our bullpen is in going forward.  Tazawa is really the only guy you can have 100% confidence with going into 2016 at the moment.  I like Holt, he's a great bench player.  But, he's not a part of the core moving forward.  I'm not trading him to trade him, but you can definitely get a good return for him."
redsox,3e4nxb,DatabaseCentral,2,Tue Jul 21 23:30:32 2015 UTC,"What is odder: this question getting asked twice a day for the past week, or the same subscribers responding to each post?"

redsox,3e31f5,slipspace11,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:00:30 2015 UTC,"I mostly agree, but I'm not quite as on-board for the ""baptism by fire"" of forcing Owens and Swihart into regular roles at the big league level if they're not ready. That mentality can screw up young guys.  Otherwise, I agree with mostly all of it.   Hanley to 1B Bradley, Betts, Castillo in the OF Joe Kelly and his 96 MPH fastball into the bullpen (maybe he'll Andrew Miller himself into a good reliever?) Swihart catching for the veterans, Hanigan catching for the young guys (Johnson, Rodriguez, Owens if he's up). Let the veterans help the young guys on either side of the battery. Have Porcello and Miley (to a lesser degree) work on different approaches to see if we can't get them back into more consistent form.   Might as well use the time we've got."
redsox,3e2c3x,ParsnipPizza,26,Tue Jul 21 12:30:17 2015 UTC,"Farrell can't make Porcello pitch, Napoli hit, Hanley play LF, Pablo lose weight, Ortiz not be 40, Victorino be healthy... the list of problems with this team goes on and so little of it can be fairly blamed on Farrell.   I don't even put this on Cherington because I still think Lucchino and Henry are tying Ben's hands. I think they let him do his thing after the 2012 disaster, and then when things went well in 2013 they started to think they had something to do with it and went right back to steering their ship into the ground."
redsox,3e2c3x,slipspace11,9,Tue Jul 21 12:38:31 2015 UTC,No but Farrell also pussy foots around his players. He isn't in charge of his own clubhouse and that alone is enough ground for firing
redsox,3e2c3x,slipspace11,3,Tue Jul 21 16:01:34 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say he pussyfoots, I think he does everything he can to avoid throwing his players under the bus, even when he really should do so and they totally deserve it."
redsox,3e2c3x,slipspace11,2,Tue Jul 21 16:23:46 2015 UTC,"He does everything he can to avoid confrontation. He wants to be buddies instead of the boss. I understand not throwing guys under the bus publicly and that's admirable, but in private you gotta lay the hammer down or no one will respect you"
redsox,3e2c3x,slipspace11,3,Tue Jul 21 16:38:07 2015 UTC,How do you know how he interacts with his players in private?
redsox,3e2c3x,copilot0910,4,Tue Jul 21 16:59:59 2015 UTC,Because it's pretty obvious. He gets screamed at by one of his players in public: Nothing happens. His players whine and bitch and moan and fiddle on instagram. You have players like Hanley Ramirez who hasn't earned a thing with this organization saying there's no way he'll play first base. The fact that it even crosses the players' minds that they can do shit like this shows they have no regard for Farrell. You don't see this stuff on well managed teams
redsox,3e2c3x,copilot0910,3,Tue Jul 21 17:13:53 2015 UTC,"Maybe not, but you didn't see it happen in 2013 either, when they had the right kind of guys on the team. But above all that, you don't hear about any of that shit when the team is winning, which they haven't done for a whole litany of reasons, the least of which in my opinion is Farrell."
redsox,3e2c3x,Theo93,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:19:25 2015 UTC,"True but I'm personally of the theory that the 2013 team was a self-guided ship and John Farrell was just kind of along for the ride. He's definitely not the chief reason this team is struggling, but struggling teams rely on their manager to do his job above what is normally required and Farrell just doesn't have any of that kind of leadership in him."
redsox,3e2c3x,Theo93,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:43:57 2015 UTC,I agree with that to an extent. I just hate to put the blame on a coach when the players aren't doing their jobs.
redsox,3e2c3x,Theo93,3,Tue Jul 21 19:47:52 2015 UTC,"You're right exactly about Lucchino. I'm still not convinced too about his grasp being too tight. Regarding Henry, he won't accept losing it seems because of this ""a big market team can't rebuild"" philosophy that will hamstring future growth and player development. Lucchino, the second Bobby V turned into a dumpster fire, I knew his control was too much, as I new Bobby V was his manager."
redsox,3e2c3x,Theo93,2,Tue Jul 21 13:46:24 2015 UTC,"Right. And I really think after Bobby V was a disaster, Ben was able to convince the owners to let him do his job, and that brought us the right manager in Farrell and the right players in Gomes, Dempster, Ross, Victorino, Napoli... solid players but great teammates and leaders as well. Then I think the success of that year went to the owners' heads and they abandoned the philosophy that brought them success, brought in AJ Pierzynski, traded Lester, paid for Hanley and Pablo... and now look where they are.   If Cherington gets dumped at the end of the year I'd be really interested to see what kind of position he gets wherever he ends up - I wonder if we'd see the type of system that is starting to really flourish with Theo in Chicago."
redsox,3e2c3x,mcorcoran3,2,Tue Jul 21 14:32:20 2015 UTC,"Im guessing praising Ben, but I have no clue. You're fully right in my opinion, ownership pushed it too much."
redsox,3e2c3x,mcorcoran3,2,Tue Jul 21 17:46:16 2015 UTC,He can sit Pabol or Napoli when they aren't doing shit. Why he did play Holt yesterday is beyond me.
redsox,3e2c3x,TTSsox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:01:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah I didn't understand that either - he's obviously not perfect, but pinning the season on Farrell for things like that is missing the big picture in my opinion."

redsox,3e2c3x,icethepartyplanner,2,Tue Jul 21 19:25:30 2015 UTC,"My thinking is that you see what you have now and what you need to get in the offseason, rather than hanging on to players you know won't be here next year, put together a new team and cross your fingers that it works next spring like we tried to do this year."
redsox,3e2c3x,LansdowneStreet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:35:18 2015 UTC,Do you think Ferrell is the right Manger for the team?
redsox,3e2c3x,slapadastic,2,Tue Jul 21 19:50:32 2015 UTC,I don't think anyone would have any more success than him with this current squad. I think he deserves an opportunity to manage next year with a (hopefully) higher quality team.
redsox,3e2c3x,potentpotables,2,Tue Jul 21 20:52:59 2015 UTC,I hope so. I wouldn't be shocked if he got fired this winter honestly. But I agree with you that we would be where we are regardless of Farrell.
redsox,3e2c3x,LansdowneStreet,2,Tue Jul 21 21:04:10 2015 UTC,"I think we should clean house in the off-season. It is too late to change things now this season. But the ax needs to fall on some heads this off-season. Not all Farrell's fault, but when a team with this payroll sucks this bad for two years in a row, both the gm and manager need to be looked at seriously."
redsox,3e2c3x,TheNaturalBrin,2,Tue Jul 21 20:29:54 2015 UTC,"It is hard to know how much of the roster is Cherington's fault, but we can't fire the owner. Someone needs to be accountable for a 200 million team that sucks this bad. Lucchino is reported to have been losing his power, which is good, but hard to justify keeping Cherington after all of these terrible moves."
redsox,3e2c3x,UberGroove14,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:28:38 2015 UTC,Agreed with everything until Cherington.
redsox,3e2c3x,mcorcoran3,0,Tue Jul 21 21:24:15 2015 UTC,"But Farrell can make those guys want to play more and give more effort. He can tell Ortiz to get his head out of his ass and play first base because the team needs him. I don't think bad performances are just because of lack of talent, I think they also show lapses of concentration and lack of motivation. That's on Farrell. Guys losing track of outs, that's on Farrell."
redsox,3e2c3x,icethepartyplanner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:59:36 2015 UTC,"I don't agree. First of all, Papi does go out and play 1B when he's asked- he complains about it, but he still does it. Second, I don't know how anyone can expect Farrell to get in his players heads to the point where he makes sure they know how many outs there are. These guys are professional baseball players, they've been playing their entire lives, they shouldn't need the manager to remind them to pay attention to how many outs are in the game."
redsox,3e2c3x,UberGroove14,3,Tue Jul 21 14:28:00 2015 UTC,"Ortiz should be out there more consistently though. He's stubborn, but I think a tougher manager could say play first or sit, your choice. He wants to play to reach incentives, so that could motivate him. And the forgetting outs just emphasizes the lack of focus on the team. The players forget about the outs because it doesn't matter to them, they don't have to care because no one drives it into them. And then after they laugh about it because it's all just a big joke. Would any of the great teams we have had so that? No, they would be more focused and care more about the details to help them win."
redsox,3e2c3x,icethepartyplanner,3,Tue Jul 21 14:40:36 2015 UTC,"Ortiz should be out there more consistently though.   I'd say at this point Ortiz can do what he wants to do, and I'd say we shouldn't really get to complain about it.  There are lots of issues with this team, but if anyone deserves this club's loyalty it's our designated hitter and why do we even need to bring this up?"
redsox,3e2c3x,UberGroove14,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:56:45 2015 UTC,"I agree with you because I trust Papi. I trust that as a ballplayer he is aware of his role, his legacy, and, hopefully, his ETD."
redsox,3e2c3x,LansdowneStreet,2,Tue Jul 21 15:59:56 2015 UTC,"Ortiz is nearly 40 years old and has been DH-ing almost exclusively for the last 10+ years. Even if he wanted to, we can't expect him to play the field every day or even every other day and stay healthy and still be effective with his bat."
redsox,3e2c3x,icethepartyplanner,-2,Tue Jul 21 14:44:58 2015 UTC,This is Ben's team. He needs to go.
redsox,3e2c3x,LansdowneStreet,7,Tue Jul 21 14:40:00 2015 UTC,"Not pictured:  How this team's infusion of youth is the best part about it and the best thing we have to hold onto moving forward.  I mean, maybe that happened entirely without the input of the general manager, but that's hard to believe."
redsox,3e2c3x,icethepartyplanner,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:57:53 2015 UTC,"Then he should take Larry Lucchino and John Henry with him.  Which I don't want to happen, I just think they need to back off and let the GM do his job. Otherwise we're going to get the exact same results from the next GM who comes in."
redsox,3e2c3x,LansdowneStreet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:43:42 2015 UTC,"You're insane.  Lucchino hasn't been involved with the team at all this year. He's 100% involved in the Olympics.  Love him or hate him, Lucchino is unbelievably great at running baseball teams. Mother problem is he hasn't been involved enough this year.  The people who defend Cherington infuriate me.  They make up reasons to defend him.  All false hypotheticals"
redsox,3e2c3x,icethepartyplanner,7,Tue Jul 21 15:26:43 2015 UTC,"I think Farrell gets a bit more grief than he deserves. However, I will say that no matter how hard I try, I cannot and will not understand starting Nap over Holt this season. I flat out don't get it - and I know there are plenty here who defend the move. We're just going to have to agree to disagree.  Also, I think Wright should be given a bit more slack as he has been up and down, in the pen and in the starting rotation. It's tough when your season is that scattered, I think. And that, to me, is on Farrell as well.  But the issues with Nap and Hanley are not the fault of Farrell. Same with Vic, Rusney's underwhelming performance in the Bigs and Allen Craig as well. That's not his fault.   To me, I think, the situation with Porcello and Hanley is more frustrating than anything else. Hanley in LF is aggravating (and sometimes even at the plate, too - dare I say) and the Front Office's signing of Hanley and then kind of just shoe-horning him into Left is a bit frustrating too. Porcello must be better next season or I don't know what is going to happen there. He has been total shit, if you ask me. It's one thing to watch Eduardo struggle as the kid is a rookie but Porcello was supposed to be so much more. Same with ""Cy"" Kelly now that I think of it. His total collapse as a starter is also not the fault of Farrell but starting Kelly over Wright is a misstep that Farrell owns exclusively.  Some of the things are the fault of Farrell and some aren't and I think, in the end, he will be fired which will be somewhat of a shame as this blame lies more with the veteran players who are playing like shit and management above Farrell."
redsox,3e2c3x,LansdowneStreet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:54:36 2015 UTC,"Farrell is not to blame for most of this shit show -- the roster is probably the biggest disaster and the trades, contracts etc... have been bad (Porcello, Pablo, Rusney so far, Craig/Kelly)  Still, it is hard to justify keeping Farrell even still. This team needs a major reboot and a new manager seems inevitable sometimes soon."
redsox,3e2c3x,ThePaddingtonBear,7,Tue Jul 21 20:27:11 2015 UTC,"And on top of that, he does a terrible job of managing in game. I wouldn't be upset if we brought in someone to kick this team in the ass and show some passion."
redsox,3e2c3x,LansdowneStreet,5,Tue Jul 21 12:45:02 2015 UTC,"The last time they hired someone to ""kick the team in the ass"", they hired Bobby V. Not necessarily disagreeing with you in terms of being what they need but I have a small amount of faith in Sox management to get that kind of person and then have it be a successful endeavor."
redsox,3e2c3x,bcelos,0,Tue Jul 21 13:05:57 2015 UTC,"After the past few seasons I have a small amount of faith in Red Sox management to do anything more than make a lot of money.

redsox,3e2c3x,ynkysuk,2,Tue Jul 21 13:49:23 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I share some frustration in regards to Farrell, too. So, I totally get it. I do think, however, management better do some soul searching if they really expect people to show up and pay the stupid prices at Fenway to watch a sub-par product. Another couple seasons of this and I could see ticket sales suffering significantly."

Do you think our management is so stupid they don't realize the easiest way to make a lot of money is to win?  Because I don't know what people think reality is, but there's no way there are easier ways for the Boston Red Sox to make money than to make the playoffs."
redsox,3e2c3x,John_Farrell,0,Tue Jul 21 14:46:07 2015 UTC,"Saying I want to make the playoffs is different from actually doing it. I don't doubt that they want to win, but they just haven't been able to do it recently."
redsox,3e2c3x,atraintocry,3,Tue Jul 21 14:58:31 2015 UTC,"But come on then, tell me how they've managed to lose all benefit of your doubt because they want to make money, and tell me how that desire to make money is hurting the ballclub.  Because from my perspective, looking back to when we HAD shitty owners, these guys have made literally everything--every single thing--about Red Sox baseball better since they arrived in 2002.  Their desire to make money is what won us three titles and what gives me hope that this situation is only temporary.  Because there's more money in winning than sucking.  So obviously they're going to prefer winning."
redsox,3e2c3x,redsoxman6594,0,Tue Jul 21 15:00:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think you get what I'm saying. I originally made a joke because the team has sucked recently but they have made a lot of money, so all these owners know how to do is make money. The owners do want to win, in reality, because they like it and it gives them money, but to do that they have to build a good team. They have been unable to do that recently, thus I'm not sure what my confidence is in them making smart baseball decisions."
redsox,3e2c3x,gangnam_style,2,Tue Jul 21 15:11:25 2015 UTC,"They have been unable to do that recently, thus I'm not sure what my confidence is in them making smart baseball decisions.   Well let's see.  Compared to the Yawkeys and the legacy they left behind, this ownership group is winning that one 3-0.  In considerably less time.  So there's that.  I just think it's insane, and people like to do this, to blame ownership because they like making money, as though winning didn't make more money.  If we were on the luxury tax recipient list, that's one thing, but this is Boston.  There's one easy way to make money.    And therefore blaming ownership kind of doesn't hold any water."
redsox,3e2c3x,Heatcheck3s,3,Tue Jul 21 15:14:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not blaming them because they like money!!! I'm blaming them because they have had one competitive team in the last 5 years!!! Thanks for the three championships, but what have you done for me lately? 3 last place finishes in 4 years is unacceptable, and yes I know they won the other year, but that doesn't excuse the suck. This team should consistently be a playoff team, and not being that has to be put at least somewhat on upper management and baseball ops. And saying that we have won more than we did with the Yawkeys is the worst way to look at it. Don't you want to win as much as possible? Or are you ok with sucking because that's what we did for so long so oh well? Personally I want to compete every year and try and win as much as we can because that's what it's all about."
redsox,3e2c3x,LansdowneStreet,2,Tue Jul 21 15:45:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the three championships, but what have you done for me lately?   This is insane.  I'm too old to agree with you on this.  Unacceptable.  I went into my twenties expecting that I would be exceedingly lucky if I ever saw the Red Sox win A title.  Now they have three.  ""Lately"" is a relative term.  They've done PLENTY for me lately.  Your clock runs too fast is the problem.   And saying that we have won more than we did with the Yawkeys is the worst way to look at it. Don't you want to win as much as possible?   Man I want to win, but I've gotten everything I could reasonably demand, so even if we don't win I'm not going to throw season-long temper tantrums and blame everybody because ""waaaah we didn't win all the time.""   Or are you ok with sucking because that's what we did for so long so oh well?    I'm okay with riding it out because I have no reason not to believe in this ownership group's devotion toward winning.    I don't understand what you think you want.  For these guys to sell the team because, well, now that they've been a whopping two years without duck boats they're failures?  For us to demand that they go all out to win every year, like being devoted enough would make the guys they paid play better?  Or are you just spewing shit in every direction because the season's not going well?"
redsox,3e2c3x,senorpootin,2,Tue Jul 21 15:57:55 2015 UTC,How quickly we become spoiled.
redsox,3e2c3x,archmcd,2,Tue Jul 21 16:51:01 2015 UTC,"The problem is, and replace him with what?  With the payroll we have and will continue to have, we're almost forced to replace Farrell with another ""player's manager,"" and pretty much all of those guys (even Terry Francona, who is undeniably awesome) have the same set of flaws.  They don't bench struggling players fast enough.  They don't seem to have answers in a crisis.  I mean we could try getting more of a no-nonsense manager in there, provided we don't botch that nearly as horribly as we did in 2012.  And provided we're willing to deal with occasional players getting furious and the clubhouse being strained.  ""Find a leader of men.""  Like yelling would get Mike Napoli to finally adapt to this year's strike zone.  Like yelling would restore two years of youth to David Ortiz' bat.    Would firing Farrell be an overreaction?  Maybe, but on the other hand he's not really moving the needle here.  I do know, however, that the man he replaced is my least favorite coach in any sport, ever.  (Actually, Valentine is numbers one and two on that list, as I'm convinced he and football coach Greg Schiano are in reality the same person.  So it's Valentine, Valentine, and then Rick Pitino.)

Bogaerts, Betts, Rodriguez (yes he got shelled yesterday, rookies do that, moving on), Swihart, Brian Johnson, and so on. -Dustin Pedroia is still on this team. -David Ortiz is still in the league.  #500 is coming.  It's not impossible for it to come this year.  And the way the rest of baseball treats this guy, we need to step up for him.  It's the least we can do at this point. -This is going to be the last we see of Koji, the rest of this season, and if you don't stop and appreciate that you will miss him when he's gone. -Hanley Ramirez and Pablo Sandoval's unique but separate brands of reckless baseball. -Pedro day.  Mark my damn words:  NOTHING is over until we've had Pedro day.  I mean, what?  Can people really not watch a losing team?  What did you people do with the Celtics before 2007-08?  What did you do with the pre-Parcells Patriots?  I'm a Northeastern guy, let me tell you, the world continues to spin after your team loses."

If someone really does want to give up on the season, fine, happy to see them next March.  I suppose it'd be better than throwing a fit every game because this team keeps making stupid mistakes combined with mediocre luck and none of that ""intangible"" spark that can gloss over a lot of that.    I think there's still some entertainment left in this team, though.  There's the potential that at some point very soon the whole team kind of goes into ""screw it, let's try anything, why not"" mode and starts just playing incredibly reckless baseball.  That sounds fun to me.  Or maybe we don't get that but we still see a bunch more of Eddie Rodriguez starts, Xander Bogaerts doubles, Mookie Betts stolen bases, and Dustin Pedroia swings.  That could be worth the three hours a night."

redsox,3e2dum,Boston_Pops,2,Tue Jul 21 15:27:53 2015 UTC,"Teams currently in AL wild card contention have played .543 ball so far.  Considering the record is 42-51 (.452), the Sox would need to go 46-23 (.667) over their remaining 69 games to finish @ 88-74 (.543).  Absolutely nothing I've seen this year suggests the Sox can play .667 ball over a stretch of 69 games."
redsox,3e2dum,nhmo,3,Tue Jul 21 18:40:49 2015 UTC,"Even with the run before the all-star break, the Sox needed help from the rest of the AL East to legitimately have a shot at the playoffs."
redsox,3e2dum,nottonywisconsin,2,Tue Jul 21 15:05:39 2015 UTC,"I think so. They are 6-8 in July after going  14-14 in June, 10-19 in May, and 12-10 in April. 88 wins has historically been the wild card floor, and what both wild card leaders are on pace for. The Red Sox would have to go 46-23 (.667 win percentage, 108 win pace over the course of a season).  This is not a good team dealing with injuries or prolonged slumps due to bad luck or mechanics. There simply isn't enough talent on the roster. Production at catcher, first base, third base, right field, and left field all rank in the bottom ten. The bullpen is one of just four groups that has provided negative WAR to date, with only three pitchers (Uehara, Tazawa, and Layne) providing above average relief pitching. Even with a strong rotation, I think the Red Sox would struggle to string wins together with the poor defense, below average offense, and lack of relief pitching.  Ideally, one would hope David Ortiz finishes the season on a tear, hits his 500th home run against the Orioles in the home finale, and then calls it quits. That would free up the DH position for Hanley and others, as Ortiz is a platoon bat at this stage of his career, and can't field a position. I'm also hopeful Cherington will be fired right when the season ends so that his successor will have the most time possible to retool the roster going into next season."

redsox,3e3838,nwdcdude,6,Tue Jul 21 17:00:41 2015 UTC,Need to decide what you plan on doing next year at 1B. Are we going to move HRam or Panda over? If you do then do you plan on replacing them at LF/3B with someone in AAA.  So for hitters you could be looking for a better fit at LF/3B or 1B if you want to leave them where they are.  I think they should be looking at the front line starters whose contracts are up and look to extend one of them beyond this year.  I think they should be buyers and sellers. You try to sell any parts that have any value and don't figure into your future plans while still trying to acquire anyone that could be a piece in the puzzle for the future.  It really feels like it should be a stacked lineup like we all thought this spring but it just hasn't come together.  I really don't know what you could realistically do with this team besides try to upgrade the pitching.  Maybe look towards SD who are getting ready to sell and try to get Ross and Kimbrel or something. Could help stabilize the rotation and bullpen. Could give Philly a call and try to get Hamels and Paps to do the same. If I had my choice of starters it would be Price or Cueto but I don't think our FO would be willing to pay them.
redsox,3e3838,itsmuddy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:02:41 2015 UTC,"Cueto would be a great addition. Price would be nice, but given the history between him and Papi that could cause a problem in the clubhouse."

redsox,3e3838,njgreenwood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:50:36 2015 UTC,I feel that Cueto is a higher ceiling but Price is a lower floor. I don't know why but I am a little more hesitant on a long term deal with Cueto than I would be with Price.  I don't think there would be any issues between Papi and Price. Papi is probably only around for another year and Price would have just gotten a $1-200ish mil.
redsox,3e3838,LansdowneStreet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:19:10 2015 UTC,Thankfully it'd only be a season or so of them seductively glaring at each other.
redsox,3e3838,canadacanadadry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:52:09 2015 UTC,"Cueto scares me a little, he's had some elbow tightness lately, I'd hate to have a Lackey situation where he signs a gigantic contract, pitches like shit and then misses a year.  Although if he were to come back in the later part of the deal and help us win a World Series, that wouldn't suck."
redsox,3e3838,itsmuddy,2,Tue Jul 21 19:13:59 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind us being buyers in the right trade market, but this isn't it.  Sometimes around July you can find a way to make a big move to get a guy you need moving forward.  But this year the best pitcher on the market is Johnny Cueto, who we'd need to then keep (and who we'd then need to stay healthy for the long term) and that might not be easy.  Cole Hamels is fine, but Clay Buchholz is producing similar numbers in a tougher division for far less money, not sure Hamels puts us over any top.  There are no leadoff hitters (I like Betts but he needs to up the OBP if he wants to be a leadoff man) out on the market either.    I think the smartest course of action right now is to do nothing.  If someone blows us away with an offer for Hanley or maybe Sandoval (Ramirez is far more likely though), we'd be dumb not to listen, but I wouldn't seek such a deal out either.  Any improvements we make probably have to come this winter."
redsox,3e3838,NUKEFreeman,2,Tue Jul 21 17:54:47 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why there seems to be a large contingent here that considers trading Pablo or Hanley a possibility.  It won't happen.  These guys are four-ish months into five and four year deals.  Sure, Pablo is having a shit year (still better than WMB and past few years of shit at 3B we've had!).  Hanley is hitting well, but his defense is atrocious, negative WAR, I get it.  But you can't trade them.  For one, there's no market for guys on contracts like this.  If Ben gets some kind of incredible offer (hint, he won't), then fine.  But you'd be trading them at incredibly low value, it's simply a terrible move to make.  Second, trading either would be a big fuck you to any and all future free agents.  We'd be saying, ""Hey come sign here, but asterisk, we may just ship you out if you suck for half a season.""   Where's the logic there? I understand we have a rabid fan base but sometimes the though processes detailed here leave me feeling dumber for having tried to understand them.  If Ben wants to be a buyer, I'd probably look to upgrade the pen and the rotation, and look at 1B as well.  If a team wants to take a chance on Napoli for any decent prospect, why not.  I'll echo other posts here and add that Cole Hamels and/or Cueto seem to be targets at this point.  I'm hesitant about Cueto, or any of the other expiring pitchers, given that we could be giving up prospects for nothing if they ended up signing elsewhere in the offseason.  If possible, any trade would include some kind of negotiation window for an extension.  I'll include Price here even though he's an immature twat.  Possible scenario: Sox acquire Hamels. Unlikely scenario: Sox acquire Cueto. Dream scenario: Sox acquire Cueto and Chapman. Video game scenario: Sox acquire Cueto and Votto."
redsox,3e3838,NUKEFreeman,2,Tue Jul 21 18:26:10 2015 UTC,Agree. I'm not exactly sure what everyone was expecting out of Panda and HRam though I would have loved if Hanley could have at least been closer to replacement level fielding. At this point I would feel safer with Papi at 1B and Hanley at DH.  I really don't know what can be done to improve the anemic offense. The pitching can and should be improved through acquisitions and people not continuing to pitch worse than they should (Looking at you Rick).  I do agree that Cueto/Champman could be a dream trade but we all know the FO wont do what it takes to sign Cueto beyond this year. Could maybe get a Ross/Shields/Kimbrel type deal with SD which should improve the pitching while costing less but not have as big an impact as Cueto/Chap.
redsox,3e3838,NUKEFreeman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:42:52 2015 UTC,"There are two situations in which I agree:   You trade for a guy like Cole Hamels, who has multiple years left on his contract after this season and can help you in 2016 and later. You try and trade players like Ramirez or Sandoval (players with contracts you want to dump) and bring in rental players to fill the spots now and get rid of the money for next season.   I don't see the second situation being very likely, but I can see the first.  I'm not trading Bogaerts, Betts, Swihart, or Rodriguez in any deal.  Those four and Pedroia are my untouchables, and Ortiz is not going anywhere.  Everyone else should be on the table, even with how unlikely dealing some players are."

redsox,3dzbiz,slapadastic,3,Mon Jul 20 22:06:12 2015 UTC,"A lot pitches down the middle then some tipping, Hanley lost a ball, but in the grand scheme of things it would've save only one run."

redsox,3dzbiz,SpacemanLeesBong,5,Mon Jul 20 22:23:25 2015 UTC,Took the Ump long enough to call Ortiz safe on that.  He really wanted to call him out.  Actually he was probably just stunned that Napoli got a hit and the Red Sox scored a run.

redsox,3e06bo,apprberriepie,2,Tue Jul 21 04:37:54 2015 UTC,You didn't ask nicely enough
redsox,3e06bo,apprberriepie,2,Tue Jul 21 04:39:44 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'll try with De Aza Holt: Pretty please get a base hit or a homer De Aza Holt? We really like you. It would be very much appreciated."
redsox,3e06bo,RedNotWhite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:41:28 2015 UTC,That didn't work either. :(
redsox,3e06bo,apprberriepie,2,Tue Jul 21 04:42:30 2015 UTC,I had Panda Express for dinner. Was delicious.

redsox,3e06bo,RedNotWhite,3,Tue Jul 21 04:35:44 2015 UTC,Maybe the Sox just need a little more time to get comfortable after the break.
redsox,3e06bo,slapadastic,3,Tue Jul 21 04:35:25 2015 UTC,Like another half season or so?
redsox,3e06bo,RedNotWhite,2,Tue Jul 21 04:35:53 2015 UTC,"I predict we take 2/3 with the Astros, sweep the Tigers, then take 3/4 from the White Sox."
redsox,3e06bo,Karma_Chamillionaire,0,Tue Jul 21 04:36:57 2015 UTC,I predict you will masturbate more times in the next 24 hours than the Sox get wins in the next seven games.

redsox,3e06bo,tenbuckbeer,2,Tue Jul 21 04:34:14 2015 UTC,Pedey's hit a few warning track shots. He's getting there

redsox,3e06bo,sicilianhotdog,5,Tue Jul 21 04:34:51 2015 UTC,I'm out here living life. I've never had seats where I can yell things at the players and I know they hear me.  It's very empowering

redsox,3e06bo,AATroop,2,Tue Jul 21 04:39:37 2015 UTC,"Guy, I feel personally responsible for the downfall of Fred Lewis' career (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Lewis).  In the minor leagues, he played for a team 15 minutes from my hometown, and seats right behind the plate were ten bucks.  After a whole year of ""FRRRREEEEEEEDDDDDDD LLLLLEEEEEEEEWWWWWIIIIIIISSSSSSSS"" his stats tanked and he only ever ended up being a AAAA - level guy"
redsox,3e06bo,DatabaseCentral,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:39:21 2015 UTC,If Trout gets up tell him he looks like a thick-necked Frankenstein (I know that's not the name of the monster but who cares)

redsox,3e06bo,DatabaseCentral,3,Tue Jul 21 04:36:21 2015 UTC,I have said it before about Mike Trout and it is still true.
redsox,3e06bo,RedNotWhite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:35:11 2015 UTC,Yes. Saving this to send to my Mariners fan brother when he gets upset about Trout
redsox,3e06bo,DatabaseCentral,2,Tue Jul 21 04:36:42 2015 UTC,Always feels good when you find out you're taller than a player. Doesn't happen often though.

Do I put youtube links in the text box?  My videos aren't uploading to it, so I could link them instead.  Do I describe the videos?  Here is what it looks like"
redsox,3e06bo,AATroop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:30:20 2015 UTC,"You need to print the videos first, then staple them to the back of the application. Make sure you use a video printer."
redsox,3e06bo,yangar,4,Tue Jul 21 09:50:22 2015 UTC,Can you put a link to your Youtube profile there? That way it is all together?  Or maybe host the original files in a Dropbox folder and share the link to that?
redsox,3e06bo,slapadastic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:31:56 2015 UTC,I'll try this. Worse comes to worse I'm sharing individual links in that box. Thank you for your help.
redsox,3e06bo,RedSoxDamageControl,3,Tue Jul 21 04:38:30 2015 UTC,What kind of job is it?
redsox,3e06bo,slapadastic,2,Tue Jul 21 04:31:50 2015 UTC,It's for video editing.
redsox,3e06bo,apprberriepie,2,Tue Jul 21 04:32:17 2015 UTC,I'd do what /u/sox_beer_fish said.

redsox,3e06bo,apprberriepie,5,Tue Jul 21 04:29:45 2015 UTC,Um...
redsox,3e06bo,apprberriepie,3,Tue Jul 21 04:29:01 2015 UTC,I'd gladly take his place.

redsox,3e06bo,Dominiking,4,Tue Jul 21 04:31:56 2015 UTC,I did that a while ago. Don't do it.
redsox,3e06bo,apprberriepie,3,Tue Jul 21 04:27:46 2015 UTC,The heartburn will be worth it to see my Red Sox come back and win to keep some life
redsox,3e06bo,RedSoxDamageControl,3,Tue Jul 21 04:29:08 2015 UTC,Eat a hat instead. Much less pain.
redsox,3e06bo,RedSoxDamageControl,4,Tue Jul 21 04:31:14 2015 UTC,"The throwing up all over your couch, won't."

redsox,3e06bo,RedSoxDamageControl,4,Tue Jul 21 04:25:01 2015 UTC,I tried to ask nicely :(
redsox,3e06bo,yangar,2,Tue Jul 21 04:28:18 2015 UTC,"If Hanley gets a home run, I will do something. Taking suggestions."

redsox,3e06bo,RedSoxDamageControl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:24:25 2015 UTC,"I mean like his leg was hurting, not that he was lazy. God knows Pedroia isn't lazy."

redsox,3e06bo,AATroop,2,Tue Jul 21 04:23:36 2015 UTC,Would be an awfully good time for Hanley to do something
redsox,3e06bo,apprberriepie,3,Tue Jul 21 04:23:28 2015 UTC,Hey look at this!

redsox,3e06bo,slapadastic,3,Tue Jul 21 04:21:13 2015 UTC,It means not scoring with the bases loaded and 1 out.
redsox,3e06bo,apprberriepie,5,Tue Jul 21 04:20:46 2015 UTC,Nope.  Stranding motherfuckers like it's Castaway up in here

redsox,3e3lbe,ThePaddingtonBear,2,Tue Jul 21 18:31:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the best 3B of the future options are both currently in Greenville. Sandoval wasn't a great signing, but he's significantly better than what the other options were and are."

redsox,3e3lbe,devern_hansack,2,Tue Jul 21 22:16:09 2015 UTC,"Everyone's saying Pablo is awful, and I admit I haven't been able to watch as many games as I've wanted to lately, but I don't understand how everyone thinks he's doing so poorly. He's had some bad plays at 3B that really jump out to me, and his hitting hasn't been great (not really a switch hitter anymore), but his numbers are on pace to be about what he has been for the last few years. In fact, if he finishes the year the way it's been going so far, he'll have comparable numbers to 2012 when the Giants won the World Series.  He's not Adrian Beltre, but he's not Will Middlebrooks, either. I don't think he needs to be traded, and because of his contract, I don't think anyone would trade for him if they did try to trade him."
redsox,3e3lbe,internetosaurus,2,Tue Jul 21 19:24:02 2015 UTC,"His offensive numbers this year are closer to 2010, when he was left off the NLCS roster and had 3 ABs in the WS, only with a lower walk rate and less power. That's not to say they'll stay that way, he's a streaky hitter and we knew that going in. His defense at 3B, however, has been terrible - DRS and UZR give him -13 and -12.5, respectively, and the eye test backs that up. Errors aren't a great stat, but his 12 this year have been well-earned.  He's better than WMB - and that's why they signed him, they didn't really have other options with no quality 3B prospects above A ball - but he's been bad. Not awful, but definitely bad."
redsox,3e3lbe,htheo157,2,Tue Jul 21 20:19:56 2015 UTC,"Think about this. Who wants an overweight, underperforming, player who just signed a big contract this year? No one that's who."
redsox,3e3lbe,zombiefart,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:45:10 2015 UTC,"Not this year, but eventually, yeah, I think so. I think Moncada is our 3B of the future and will probably be ready by 2017. So I won't be surprised to see Panda traded either at the end of 2016 or early 2017 depending on how well he is playing (hopefully he can build up some trade value, of which he has none right now) and on how ready Moncada is to start."
redsox,3e3lbe,MisterBergstrom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:31:41 2015 UTC,"Any thought of him shifting to 1B, Hanley shifting to DH, and Moncada at 3B when Papi retires?

redsox,3e3lbe,MookyB,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:17:02 2015 UTC,"Haha, trade him to who? Are you so concerned with getting him off the roster you didn't take a second to wonder if anyone would actually want to pick up his contract? Try actually thinking about. Last offseason, the red sox offered him the biggest (or close to it) contract on the free agent market. Do you think any team feels his value has gone up since then? Or that any team's need for a 3B has significantly risen since then?"
redsox,3e3lbe,Valint,0,Tue Jul 21 23:59:59 2015 UTC,It wouldn't break my heart.  I'm sure Holt could take 3B if we couldn't find one.

Tyson Ross is not only buying, but it's looking toward the Future and getting off of a team that's selling. I'd do Margot and Brian Johnson for a Tyson Ross and Kimbrel.  That would also result in shipping of Koji to a contender.  I'd also trade De Aza, Holt, Victorino. Bring JBJ up to the OF.   De Aza would be an excellent flip. Could get a PTBNL from him.  Other pitching to look at, maybe Salazar from Indians. Quintana from the White Sox. Maybe Mike Fiers from Brewers.  Then for bullpen, obviously top choice is Chapman, then look at Kimbrel, Francisco Rodriguez, Tyler Clippard, and maybe David Robertson. Joakim Soria in Free Agency.   Those are for closer roles. We need a closer when we trade Koji.  Then look at mid relief, 7th inning, and other options for the 8th inning.  That's my plan.  It keeps us in contention this season, yet helps us in the future."

I'd rather stand pat, see what we have in our young guys, hope Porcello calms down, and see what the Winter presents in terms of FA/trade market.  Not that we're out of it, but the price of trying to get back in it with trades is a bit discouraging.  I'd rather we just try it with what we have."
redsox,3dywqq,LansdowneStreet,4,Mon Jul 20 18:13:30 2015 UTC,"It is tough, neither selling or buying makes a ton of sense. There are some guys worth selling, but the return simply isn't going to be huge(Koji, Victorino). For buying we need a top tier pitcher with multiple years left on a contract. I can see a three way trade as a possibility for a top tier pitcher. Pure buying or pure selling just isn't going to be worth much.   I say we go for Hamels in a trade or pick up a FA in the offseason to solve pitching. Maybe both"
redsox,3dywqq,ramtom,9,Mon Jul 20 17:53:27 2015 UTC,I don't want Hamels right now.  The cost is too high and I expect he'll be on the decline sooner rather than later.  We don't need another mid-rotation starter.
redsox,3dywqq,LansdowneStreet,5,Mon Jul 20 18:14:06 2015 UTC,"I think we can get a pretty good return on Koji to be honest. Teams that are in it are always looking for a top tier closer and are usually willing to overpay (E-Rod for Miller last year, for example)."

What people don't seem to get is that you can ""sell"" without losing valuable assets.  GMs are prone to making bad trades at the deadline.  It doesn't happen as much as it used to, but if you can trade Victorino, Napoli, or other guys that are at the end of a deal or blocking the progress of a younger guy (or just generally sucking), you make that trade.  Even if its for a less than stellar return. Cherington will definitely be on the phone trying to ship some people out of here."
redsox,3dywqq,ThePaddingtonBear,3,Tue Jul 21 13:35:59 2015 UTC,"We'll be sellers unless there's a deal to be made for Hamels. They're too far out for a true rental to make sense. There's not much to sell, however. De Aza makes sense and should have a market. Victorino and Napoli probably won't have suitors. Maybe we can get a lottery ticket if we eat some salary.

redsox,3dywqq,nottonywisconsin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:09:42 2015 UTC,"The farm is already here (Betts, Bogaerts, Rodriguez), and no plan intends for a $180 million baseball team to finish last in the American League.  Fundamentally, the general manager has more responsibilities than to just oversee the development of prospects. Mr. Cherington's acquisitions at the major league talent level have mostly been busts, and the magnitude of the team's failures during his tenure should be concerning to every fan."
redsox,3dywqq,thekraken108,0,Tue Jul 21 19:31:19 2015 UTC,"The only pitcher that makes sense to get right now would be Hamels since he's under team control for another 4 years. Guys like Cueto and Zimmerman can wait till the off season since  they're free agents then. Anyways Pedroia, Holt, Bogearts, Swihart, Betts, Eddie Rodriguez, and maybe Brian Johnson should be untouchable. I would have no problem trading anyone else but most of them won't have much of a return or just have too big of a contract, so I doubt much of anything happens."
redsox,3dywqq,OhRatFarts,0,Mon Jul 20 19:50:42 2015 UTC,Cole Hamels is 31.  He isn't under team controll ... this is his 10th season in the bigs.

Ortiz is great in the playoffs for sure, but that doesn't matter if we don't make the playoffs. As soon as Garoppolo is better than Brady, Belichick will make the switch, and everyone will be upset including me. But I won't be angry, because it's the right decision.

But there's no reason to trade the face of your franchise for 10+ years right now. Taking him out of this already stagnant lineup doesn't really solve anything. You'd presumably move Hanley to DH, but then no LF is going to fill Papi's void in the heart of the order. Plus trying to explain a trade like that to the fanbase would be a complete mess. Honestly at this point it's better to just wait out the waning days of his career than do anything drastic and ultimately pointless."

I don't see him caring about anybody else but his numbers.   This team needs to move on from him.

What Jordan Spieth is doing right now is basically supposed to be impossible.  It was one thing when Tiger Woods dominated, because the ""field"" wasn't as strong then, but this is the generation that caught and passed Tiger.  Some kid who won his first tournament ever last year is absolutely not supposed to win every major.  It is entirely possible Spieth is some sort of golf wizard.  You'll say that's unreasonable but there is no reasonable explanation for this."
redsox,3dvdz7,BelichicksHoodie,2,Mon Jul 20 01:54:39 2015 UTC,"We all know how the script will play out. Johnson and a few others share the lead, Johnson and company all blow the lead, and Spieth swoops in to win it."
redsox,3dvdz7,MaladroitClock,3,Mon Jul 20 01:44:44 2015 UTC,"The most baffling was how defensless the Old Course was all day, minus the 20 mins it rained sideways! Definitely a HUGE moving day for most."
redsox,3dvdz7,OhRatFarts,3,Mon Jul 20 01:46:43 2015 UTC,"The whole day was amazing today! Every camera shot looked like a highlight package with all the birdies dropping! Spieth is just insane, was loose all day, even joking with Garcia on 18 and having a great day all around!  I'm so torn between wanting Spieth to get his 3rd in a row, and chance at a Grand Slam later this year, and rooting for DJ to bounce back from Chambers Bay. Was hoping one of them would possibly fall out of contention to make my decision easier but they both have a great chance (along with about 30 other players)!!  Side Note: Paul Dunne, the low amateur, is 2 years older than Spieth and also has a chance at winning!"

redsox,3dwaef,rawspeghetti,10,Mon Jul 20 01:46:28 2015 UTC,Neither team would do it; the Angels would say no first.

redsox,3dwaef,itsmuddy,8,Mon Jul 20 01:49:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think this is a good answer.  Obviously Red Sox wouldn't do that. Aquiring Trout, while amazing, would then leave us with a whole to fill in SP and SS, while accounting for a fortune on our payroll. So we'd probably become worse, if that is possible when acquiring the best player in baseball.  The Angels I think would love that trade offer, but you'd be getting rid of the face of the franchise for players that aren't guaranteed to be excellent. They could be very good, but you gotta go after excellence if you are trading the best player in baseball.  Angels would only consider it for all three, but you can't trade the best player in baseball.  Red Sox wouldn't do it because they'd create more problems than solve."
redsox,3dwaef,DatabaseCentral,6,Mon Jul 20 02:00:36 2015 UTC,I would trade all three for Trout.
redsox,3dwaef,sugar_free_haribo,2,Mon Jul 20 03:41:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly I'd consider, and probably do it. This is Mike Trout we're talking about..."

redsox,3dsxsx,DatabaseCentral,13,Sun Jul 19 03:46:54 2015 UTC,Absolutely no way you can bash pitching after these first two games. This offense is unacceptable.
redsox,3dsxsx,PunkPenguin,8,Sun Jul 19 03:47:43 2015 UTC,"Switch around two words and your comment is also true for games in which the offense shows up but the pitching is awful. The main culprit here is the Sox's inconsistency to win given the situation of the game, too many times have they either have had no run support or losing despite hitting well. Having too much of either of those two things leads to yet another losing season."
redsox,3dsxsx,Heatcheck3s,3,Sun Jul 19 04:13:06 2015 UTC,It's 2014 again....
redsox,3dsxsx,SupportstheOP,10,Sun Jul 19 18:16:01 2015 UTC,"No, it isn't. But Porcello's long ball problem is horrific. If we can't fix it, we're going to have a really shitty pitcher the next 4 years. If you take away the home runs, Porcello would actually be a decent pitcher."
redsox,3dsxsx,AATroop,6,Sun Jul 19 03:48:14 2015 UTC,Yeah. That's a fair point. It was promising that the homers were against only Kole Calhoun and he made work of Trout and Pujols.
redsox,3dsxsx,DatabaseCentral,3,Sun Jul 19 03:50:37 2015 UTC,"That's the other weird thing; it's not even great hitters he's giving up the homeruns to. It's mediocre to good hitters. Something is just wrong with Porcello and it needs to be fixed. It's very easy to give up on him, but we'd have a decent #3/#4 if we could identify and fix the issue at hand."
redsox,3dsxsx,AATroop,3,Sun Jul 19 03:52:03 2015 UTC,Kole Calhoun is not a slouch though. Maybe Porcello is too comfortable or worries about other batters instead of the man at the plate?
redsox,3dsxsx,DatabaseCentral,2,Sun Jul 19 03:53:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not saying he's a slouch, but he's not Mike Trout or Albert Pujols. Although, they did have some well hit balls tonight, only after the Calhoun did the damage though."
redsox,3dsxsx,AATroop,0,Sun Jul 19 03:57:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Porcello didn't look very good but he wasn't the problem tonight. I'd cut the offense some more slack tonight because Richards is nasty, but they let CJ freaking Wilson do the same thing last night. What a bummer of a series so far."

I wish I could use the all star break as an excuse for the offense, but in all honesty it has been unacceptable for two games straight. Xander's streak ended tonight :( Masterson looked great, top of our order actually needs to get on base, and we need to stop leaving people on base. Plenty of reason to still be optimistic, but these two losses have still been brutal. But hey, at least the Yankees lost."

Only two big mistakes, but with no offense he gets the loss.   His pitch counts were awful. He was throwing about 20 per inning, mostly because they weren't swinging at the close pitches.  The Fox announcers kept talking about how he was barely missing, but he'd throw 8 pitches to a guy like Aybar for a leadoff walk.   His curve looked good, but it just seemed like he wasn't fooling anyone. Like his delivery was obvious. Like they could all pick their spots. Like nine of them were worried about striking out.   And then Masterson of a people, comes in and they're all on the back foot, not sure what's coming.   Maybe Porch's delivery is too telling, or maybe it's just clear how different his pitches are. I dunno."

redsox,3dqzl6,FatGuyANALLIttlecoat,9,Sat Jul 18 20:46:20 2015 UTC,"Position Players  This was a little nuanced. I used bWAR (WAR from baseball-reference.com) to determine a player's best year. This is not indicative of the best seasonal performance at each position. I wanted to pick players that are known for being Red Sox. Tris Speaker put up better numbers in CF, but he is known as a Cleveland Indian. Babe Ruth had a monster year in RF for the Red Sox the year before being sold, but he is known for being a pitcher for the Sox, not an outfielder. I put in Jimmy Foxx in spite of the fact that he is remembered as an Athletic first because we honestly shared him with the A's, and he is far and wide our best first baseman.   Rico Petrocelli has the better season than Nomar, but I picked Nomar because NOMAH.   Yaz is in left over Williams because he was the better fielder, and his season in 1967 overshadows ALL of Ted Williams's seasons. I picked Ted's best year offensively, because his fielding does hurt his overall WAR.   The Bench is composed of other Red Sox legends. Almost entirely subjective.    1B 1938 Jimmy Foxx (7.6) 2B 2011 Pedroia (7.9) SS 2000 Nomar (7.1) 3B 1989 Wade Boggs (8.4) RF 1981 Dwight Evans (6.7)  CF 1979 Fred Lynn (8.8) LF 1967 Carl Yastrzemski (12.4) C 1978 Carlton Fisk (5.9) DH 1941 Ted Williams (10.9 oWAR)   Batting Order: Boggs, Pedroia, Nomar, Williams, Foxx, Yaz, Lynn, Evans, Fisk  Bench:    1944 Bobby Doerr (2B, 5.9)  1978 Jim Rice (OF/1B 7.5)  2004 Jason Varitek (C, 4.0) 1967 Tony Conigliaro (OF, 3.7) 1969 Rico Petrocelli (SS 10.0)   Starting Rotation  This was based soley on bWAR. Babe Ruth doesn't even crack the top 10 for best pitching seasons as a Red Sox player, which is surprising. He only really pitched for 5 seasons, and never cracked a bWAR of 9. What made this so easy is that each of these five had sizeable careers in Boston.    1901 Cy Young (12.6) 2000 Pedro Martinez (11.7) 1936 Lefty Grove (11.1) 1990 Roger Clemens (10.6) 1912 Smoky Joe Wood (10.4)   Bullpen  This was a lot more nuanced because sabermetrics don't do a good job evaluating relief pitching, which is sad, and there are specialty roles in the bullpen that require some creative licensing. I did not include Dennis Eckersly because he was only a relief pitcher with us in his last year, and he was a shell of his former self. I thought about putting Tom Gordon as the closer because he was nasty in 1998, and holds the record for saves in a season as a Red Sox player, and at one point held the record for consecutive saves without a blown save (broken by Gagne), but in 2013, Koji put up an ERA+ of over 300, and at one point he pitched 27 consecutive perfect innings (or close to it).    1998 Tom Gordon 2008 Jonathan Papelbon 2002 Alan Embree 2005 Mike Timlin 2012 Junichi Tazawa 2013 Koji Uehara (Closer)   Manager  Joe Cronin.   He managed the Sox from 1935 to 1947, the first ten of those years he was a player-manager. I take him over any other manager because he managed for so long, and his number isn't retired because he was just an excellent shortstop.   EDIT: formatting."

redsox,3dqzl6,ThePaddingtonBear,0,Sat Jul 18 23:01:32 2015 UTC,"He seems to have developed at the plate quite a bit this year in AAA, but hasn't had a real chance to show it in the bigs. I think he could hit at least .250 now if given the chance. Mookie is a definitely a good centerfielder now and I do think he'll be very good defensively for years to come, but JBJs defense is just on a whole 'nother level. His glove, the routes he takes to the ball, and his arm are all astonishingly good. Dudes only 25 too, I think we're starting to get spoiled after the influx of 22 year old phenoms in the league. We got a big ass right field which basically needs a second centerfielder, mookie can set up shop there."

His career wRC+ was 97, aka average offensive production, and he wasn't really a great defender at a non-premium defensive position.  He only had one season of above average production for the Sox in 1985, and even his best offsensive season (1981 with the Cubs) was only a 126 wRC+.  Plus he played what, like parts of 5 non consecutive seasons for the Sox total? And in that time was basically replacement level (0.9 fWAR in his time in Boston).  To say that Bill Buckner isn't a huge downgrade from Carl Yastrzemski is nuts."

To put this into perspective, Mike Stanley accrued a bWAR of 21 over 15 seasons.   Counting stats: .289/.321/.408 and if you take his stats and turn them into an ""average"" year for him, he's an 11 HR 78 RBI guy. This is not an amazing first baseman, and an absolutely foolish choice considering Jimmy Fucking Foxx was a first baseman for the Red Sox for over 7 years."

It took a while to find players with a highly negative WAR at each position; the best method I could come up with was isolating 30-40 year periods on Fangraphs' WAR Grid, looking for the lowest totals for players with more than a year with the Sox, and then verifying their fWAR and rWAR totals (the grid has its quirks, like listing Jon Lester as a 0-WAR player in all his years with the Sox despite fWAR having him as a 4- to 5-win pitcher most years). There are a couple on here that came from various worst-of lists; Manny Alexander gets special mention for being useless his one year with the Sox, being one of the consistently worst players to get playing time and keep a career going, and the suspicious incident when a bat boy was found with steroids while driving Alexander's car.  C: Marc Sullivan  1B: Butch Hobson  2B: Jose Offerman  3B: Manny Alexander  SS: Julio Lugo  LF: Charlie Maxwell  CF: Karl Olson  RF: Shano Collins  SP: John Wasdin  RP: Julian Tavarez  CL: Eric Gagne"

It's part of what I love about him but sometimes it goes too far. I never once believed he quit on the team or refused to play.  I personally believe Farrell had him at first base, he didn't want to do it, and Farrell told him to either play first base or he wasn't playing. I think he chose not to play first base and Farrell sent him home with the illness as a cover up because I don't believe the team. Ortiz threw a fit about playing first, then didn't play on the day that made the most sense to play first, and now Farrell says he won't be playing first. I'm sorry, I can't ignore that.

redsox,3do7qc,trobert4001,-5,Sat Jul 18 16:20:40 2015 UTC,"For people who just can't comprehend why anyone would ever be distrustful of Ortiz, or think he's selfish:  -Showed up on ""The List"". Stood at the podium, slamming his fist declaring it was an injustice! He didn't know WHAT he could have POSSIBLY tested positive for!! He PROMISED he would get to the bottom of it, and let ALL OF US KNOW what it was, and how the test was wrong...11+ years later, he's said nothing further on the topic. It's easy to say the right things (coughcoughmytempwas104cough), it's harder to back it up with facts.  -How many times did he make his contract an issue? 5 straight years from 2010-2014? More? Certainly not less. HE brought it up many times, nobody else.  -He has whined about lineup position, and protection. Again, this has happened many times. Remember when Hamilton signed his mega deal? Ortiz didn't miss it, quipping ""We should be getting guy slike this, I can't be doing it all myself."" Nice how he threw his current teammates, and lineup protection under the bus. Oh, but he's not selfish.  -When he burst into the Francona press conference is one of the most disgusting acts I have seen by a player in that situation. Over a single RBI? Really? No, not self-centered at all, is he?  -2011. Spring Training, they are ""The best team EVVVVVVAAAARRRRRR!!!!!!"" They miss the playoffs. 1) I didn't think it ever appropriate for Ortiz to OPENLY STATE he didn't understand what the manager was doing, ""his boy"" aceves should be starting. After the season, talking about what turned in to a toxic clubhouse; ""If it's going to be like this, maybe I should go to the NYY."" He fucking said that, not me. He's supposedly a team leader with his little on camera, in dugout pow-wows? Please.  -Prior to 2014 season ""Guys doing what I do, they making 25...30 million a year!"" More contract talk by Ortiz? Noooo. Making statements that show a fundamental detachment from reality? Noooo.  -Whenever people have questioned him...whether it be his play, his motivation, no matter the topic, he can NOT handle the criticism. He wants ALL of the praise, but rarely wants to EVER take his share of the blame.  -His presidential selfie, and his 100k whoring of himself and the president to samsung. In my opinion, that was a supremely DOUCHEY move. No, it wasn't fun, cute or anything. It was a disgusting cash grab by a guy making millions.  -""This is our fucking city"" great line...would love it had it been organic, and not staged like the presidential selfie. How do I know it wasn't organic? His own words. When talking about that moment, he mentioned how he was confused at first, because nobody reacted...then the cheers erupted! He was unfamiliar with the few second pause of him saying it to it getting routed through the stadium speakers. Had he not PLANNED on saying it, he wouldn't have been expecting the reaction. It was still a good moment, something the city needed...but knowing he went out there planning to say that takes a little shine off it for me.  THis is how it basically breaks down for me....between the lines, I love the guy. When he opens his mouth...I wish he never had. He is playing a role, he loves being a ""star"". When his career is over, he'll be GONE! He will NOT be like Schilling and moving in to the area. He WILL be like Pedro...being he will get away from the game for a few years, miss it, and take some position with the sox where he can come out every so often and wave his hat in front of adoring fans like Tom Hanks in A League of Their Own (though, Ortiz would actually enjoy it).  Obviously these are my opinions, but they are grounded in the facts I laid out above. This is all off the top of my head. When I start to dig, I'm reminded just how often Ortiz has made things ENTIRELY about himself.  I'm not telling anyone to stop rooting for Ortiz, but I am saying he doesn't deserve the pedestal many put him on. SF fans cheered Bonds for years even though he was a miserable, insufferable asshole...he was a great player. Ortiz isn't a miserable, insufferable asshole. He's a jovial, wide-smiling glad-hander who will be the nicest guy in the world...as long as you tell him he's great, pay him his money, assure him his security, give him his RBI, get him his lineup protection, and consult with him on pitching rotations.  ANd to the EXTREMISTS....the ""we don't win 3 rings without Ortiz"" people I know are all around...all I have to say to that is, well, without Dave Roberts, maybe we never win 1. It's a team game, and it will NEVER be renamed the Boston Ortizes."

redsox,3dsklh,pruo95,10,Sun Jul 19 01:25:14 2015 UTC,Tons of people. Mostly people who overrate Brock Holt.
redsox,3dsklh,ThePaddingtonBear,2,Sun Jul 19 01:36:47 2015 UTC,But what do you think?
redsox,3dsklh,ThePaddingtonBear,3,Sun Jul 19 01:39:52 2015 UTC,I don't believe in his bat enough. I'd keep starting Napoli at least against lefties and hope he figures things out.
redsox,3dsklh,slapadastic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:41:45 2015 UTC,That's fair. I'd be happy with a platoon of 1B. Ferrell probably also likes Holt's versatility as player all around the field.

redsox,3dsklh,walczyk,4,Sun Jul 19 01:56:10 2015 UTC,It isn't? He's been an average hitter during his MLB career. He was never anything special in the minors.  The thing that amazes me about you Holt boosters is that we went through this whole exercise just last year. He had a hot first half thanks to an unsustainable BABIP. Those of us cautioning to enjoy it while it lasted were shouted down. Then he hit .219/.278/.271 in the second half.
redsox,3dsklh,gofastrightnow,2,Sun Jul 19 02:01:41 2015 UTC,Still hasn't had an awful streak like Napoli. Holt is young and had maintained his production. Your argument against holt and for Napoli holds less and less water as Napoli dips past 180. How do you believe in naps bat but not holt?

redsox,3dogx8,DatabaseCentral,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:36:44 2015 UTC,There's no reason Koji can't go back out.  He is very efficient with his pitches usually.  But Farrell hates that for some reason.
redsox,3dogx8,OhRatFarts,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:39:53 2015 UTC,Koji in two innings is no bueno. And for all we know it could have gone into the 13th inning before taking a lead. I'd save Koji for save situations. That's my feelings on the matter. Closers jobs are to close. They aren't to be brought in when it's a tie game. Go look at what Huston Street said. He hates when closers are brought in in those situations.

redsox,3dogx8,tricher00,2,Sat Jul 18 04:29:42 2015 UTC,Gotta figure he's using him against the top of the lineup (esp Trout) and assuming they can do something in the next two innings.

Bat him against favorable match-ups. Though, looking at his splits... I guess that'd be only against LHP at home? Don't know how feasible that is.    I also think he might be getting the start because Pedroia isn't coming off the DL just yet. I'm assuming that when he does, Holt can slide over to 3b with Panda making the transition to first. But that might just be wishful thinking."

Also do you have some insider on Pedey, all signs and media outlets said he worked out yesterday and while Farrell hasn't said 100% it is expected for him to come off the DL today and ESPN (not saying they are right) has him slotted to start tonight against the Angels"
redsox,3dmegi,mikeofhyrule,2,Fri Jul 17 16:53:08 2015 UTC,Holt is a worse defensive 3B than Sandoval.
redsox,3dmegi,shabinka,-1,Fri Jul 17 18:07:33 2015 UTC,"okay Holt to SS and Bogey to 3B... He only helped us win a WS from third, And so you know if you look at tenure in Boston, Holt has a .945 while Pablo has a .943 and I think its fair that its WAY harder to just play 3B randomly here and there than every day.  Holty will get the fielding up if he starts playing there every day..."

redsox,3dmegi,hobbesthompson,3,Fri Jul 17 22:23:50 2015 UTC,"I don't dislike him, I think he's just okay. I wish he would go longer than 5 innings which is what I feel like he was at more often than not before the break."
redsox,3dmegi,hobbesthompson,2,Fri Jul 17 22:31:48 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I think his biggest downfall is mental strain, not physical. Someone else on here suggested the team hire a team shrink. I've long felt that would be a very worthwhile investment. Miley falls apart if he gets stressed out. If he gives up a critical hit, or the defense has an error, he just loses focus and stops thinking between each pitch."
redsox,3dmegi,Gingerbreadmancan,2,Fri Jul 17 22:33:45 2015 UTC,"No one could benefit more from a team shrink than Buchholz, in my humble opinion. To me, Buc just seems so clearly unwell mentally and I think (keyword as I am no professional) that might be really where all these random injuries are really stemming from for him.  But you make a fair point. Miley's biggest downfall is probably mental strain - and him chewing out Farrell like he did was some bullshit, too."
redsox,3dmegi,Gingerbreadmancan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:35:26 2015 UTC,"For sure, Buch is a basket case. We have a number of those on the team. Miley is also one of them. The blow-up at Farrell was uncalled for, but a sure sign of a mental funk, and I am pretty well convinced Nap has a psychological funk going on right now too. It could be physical, but I'm certain it's mental.  We know Eddie's problems were simple (at least on paper, might be more work to solve in practice), and we know Joe Kelly has a problem deciding what kind of pitcher he wants to be, which is a coaching and management problem - and keeping him as a starter is a disservice to him as well as the team - but a number of other people on the team seem to exhibit psychological problems that inhibit their performance.  Boston is a high-pressure city for sports. Some players have it, but others just can't handle the pressure. I've never seen so many good and even great players anywhere else like those who come to the Sox and just fall apart once they're on the big stage at Fenway."
redsox,3dmegi,theAnswer42,2,Fri Jul 17 22:41:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with what you said mostly. I think Nap's issues are both mental and physical. I truly, truly believe he doesn't have it anymore and I know I hem and haw on the game day threads about him but only because he is the epitome, to me, of a veteran player who clearly doesn't have it anymore but Farrell being Farrell sticks with the veteran player in spite of the younger, newer, talent that should be given a spot in the lineup on a consistent basis and be shown patience as they develop.  But I agree with you. We sure do have our fair share of players who seem to be in need of something beyond the physical aspects of playing the game. No argument there."

He's turning 25 later this year, he has some good collegiate experience under his belt. Pretty mature pitcher, very excited to see how he adjusts to the majors."
redsox,3dmrvg,bunker_underground,10,Fri Jul 17 15:59:08 2015 UTC,"Johnson's game revolves around pinpoint control of four average pitches, he keeps batters guessing.

redsox,3dmrvg,theAnswer42,4,Fri Jul 17 15:37:26 2015 UTC,"He's like the anti-Joe Kelly. Nobody raves about his pure stuff, but he's got amazingly good control. In any case, it will be hard for him to be worse than Kelly, Masterson or this year's version of Porcello."

redsox,3dmrvg,senorpootin,2,Fri Jul 17 15:56:26 2015 UTC,"most likely Houston, Farrell hadn't exactly said, but you can assume it's after LAA"
redsox,3dmrvg,TheRealSpoder,2,Fri Jul 17 16:00:06 2015 UTC,I think starting him against Houston would be a horrible idea. He's a lefty who doesn't throw very hard and throws a lot of strikes. Facing a right handed heavy lineup full of free swingers in that ballpark for his first big league start might be setting up a disaster. Facing the Angels wouldn't be a cake walk either but I think the matchup is a little bit better for Johnson.

Not to mention we have extremely talented players still in the minors in Yoan, Margot, Kopech (uhhhh), Espinoza, Owens, Johnson, Benintendi, Devers ... not to mention Trey Ball is starting to come around, Chavis and Sam Travis have potential, Javier Guerra is performing extremely well... and now this Marco Hernandez as the PTBNL from the Felix Doubront trade...

He wasn't quite good enough out of high school to be drafted, but he was offered a baseball scholarship and was told if he kept improving he might be draftable. He freaked out, turned down the scholarship, never went to college and stopped playing baseball entirely. We'd still go out and play catch or hit balls every now and then, and he had a killer arm. He regrets never taking the opportunity and seeing what could have been."

A bit surprised he's this high, but I think he's got an incredible offensive ceiling.    Moncada is finally showing exactly why we paid him that much money and is roughly where you'd put him.  Margot likewise is placed pretty similarly to other prospects. The advanced bat and ability to play a plus defensive centerfield is pretty valuable.  Law still likes Owens which is pretty good. If you've paid attention to his struggles, it's because they basically shelved his changeup (best pitch) in order to work on his curve and now it's finally starting to pay dividends.   Guerra is a huge surprise. Before this year we thought he'd be a defense only SS but his bat has produced an amazing amount of pop thus far in A ball (11 HR and a .502 slugging mark) as an 18 year old. It'll be interesting to see if he can sustain it because if he does, he becomes incredibly valuable."

redsox,3dksre,agoddamnlegend,2,Fri Jul 17 14:06:10 2015 UTC,I think most of the porcello hate is with the front office for signing him long term without ever seeing how he would do leading a rotation or in Fenway. My problem with it is that it was a reactionary move to the Lester situation from last year and though those type of moves typically don't work out well for us we seem to make them a lot (our lineup stunk last year so we need to sign the two biggest name bats on the market without considering fit).
redsox,3dksre,zman990,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:21:20 2015 UTC,"That's not a fair complaint though, because the price we paid reflected the fact that there was more uncertainty in Porcello than signing a proven ""ace"" (whatever that word means)."

redsox,3dksre,agoddamnlegend,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:08:58 2015 UTC,His contract is reasonable if he is the high end #2 starter he was last year other than the #3 or worse starter he has been every other year of his career. Now given his age I would say that it's a higher likelihood that he improves than regresses but it's still banking on consistency over a one year fluke. You're also asking him to take a larger role in the rotation than he ever had before.  That said I think most of my complaint is in the reactionary way we make major moves. Over the years we've had many and most of them blow up in our face.   Player's manager Tito doesn't work out anymore so let's hire Strict Bobby V Bobby V blows up in our face let's go back to the opposite end of the spectrum with Farrell Should have extended Lester in the offseason before his deal expired. Extend Porcello whom we've never seen pitch in our uniform or unique media environment. Outfield doesn't hit last year so let's pay a guy we know can hit but we've never seen field a ball in the outfield (Hanley). If you want older examples just look at our SS position. Rent-a-Wreck can't field so lets trade him and bring in Alex Gonzalez. Alex Gonzalez is amazing in the field but doesn't hit well enough? Let's get rid of him and bring in hitting SS Julio Lugo. At one point we were paying like 4 starting SS's salaries throughout the league.  I feel like I should put one example where it really did work out to be fair so look at the 2012 team. No chemistry? Let focus on bringing in a ton of glue guys for 2013.   My complaint isn't that they find problems and try to fix them but rather that they identify problems and go 180 degrees in the opposite direction. I know this is a long answer to a one sentence post but I'm kind of responding to both of your posts to me.
redsox,3dksre,zman990,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:16:21 2015 UTC,"I see what you are saying, but what are they supposed to do?  They identify a problem, and then try to fix it.  There isn't a magical blueprint to exactly how to build a team, so it's all trial and error.  If they didn't try to address any of the problems you mentioned, and just let them fester, people would be just as upset.  It's easy to cherry pick examples of moves that didn't work out.  But you can't judge them based on how they turned out.  You have to judge the moves based on whether they made sense at the time of the decision.  It's not fair to criticize them for moves a year later when more information is available that wasn't there when the decision had to be made.  To respond to your most relevant example, I don't think they regret not extending Lester.  End of the day they had a limit on years and dollars that they weren't going to budge on.  The Porcello signing had nothing to do with ""missing"" Lester.  It was a move that fit perfectly within the club's philosophy.  They make that move whether they signed Lester or not because it was a very good use of resources."

It's the fact that they go 180 degrees in the opposite direction. They don't ever go halfway.  To give examples you have to cherry pick them but it's not like I had to try too hard to find them. They've done this since halfway through the Epstein years at least. I think it's in reaction to our fanbase and media. Look at most fans, they swing to both extremes on topics with little time in the middle. Most people are in the Porcello sucks and Rodriguez is God camp right now but switch their stats over the next month and everyone will flip opinions on both. I can't believe how many people I read talking about how this was the year Clay was going to finally put it all together and how he turned the corner only to be back in the he's injury prone and we should have sold him off when his value was high now that he's hurt again, and we don't even know how long he's going to be out this time.  I know that hindsight is 20/20 but most of these were opinions I had at the moment. I was in the camp that thought trading Rizzo and Kelly for Gonzalez only made sense if you won it all that year since we could have signed him the following off season for the same exact contract. Now I'm not saying that I'm always right, hell I thought Carl Crawford was a great signing at the time. But some of these reactionary moves are just stupid. For example if they trade a top prospect for a rental this year it would be so dumb. Yes they went on a run lately but don't give up the future for this team.   Now with the Lester situation it was pretty clear in their comments after he signed and based on the offer they gave him in the offseason that they regret their spring training offer they gave him of 70 million. Trading for Porcello was independent of the Lester situation but making sure he's resigned in Spring Training before he ever even pitched for us was related."
redsox,3dkdjj,BriEnos,6,Thu Jul 16 23:47:09 2015 UTC,"Pedroia, Bogaerts, Betts, Swihart and Rodriguez.  I would trade other prospects for players under contract for a few years (I'm not giving anything up for rentals for this team).  I would trade players off the Major League roster for prospects.  I'm not giving up anyone from this group.  They are the core of this team moving forward.  If this team hasn't made up any ground by the deadline, or lost ground, I am definitely selling off pieces.  Brock Holt is #1 on that list.  He's a 27 year old utility player having a career year.  Get what you can for him before he plummets back to Earth like he did in the second half last season.  He's not a prospect.  He is not a core player moving forward.  I understand fans love him, but his value is at its peak right now.  Sell, sell, sell."

Get what you can for him before he plummets back to Earth   Couldn't agree more. I would add Koji to that list, but I am hesitant just because closers are hard to come by. But on the other hand, how much does Koji serve this team in the present? Other teams have a much higher need for a dominate closer, and we could get a team who is making a push to over pay for him."
redsox,3dkdjj,Gingerbreadmancan,3,Fri Jul 17 01:45:53 2015 UTC,"Holt, Uehara and Tazaw are probably the only players (excluding my untouchables) that has any value now that Buchholz's is hurt.  I wouldn't trade Tazawa, but trading Uehara is probably a good idea because he won't be helping this year (if the Red Sox are sellers) and might show more of his age next season."
redsox,3dkdjj,NUKEFreeman,2,Fri Jul 17 01:50:58 2015 UTC,"Our bullpen needs a whole new look. Only a few guys I'd salvage in that pen going into 2016. I'd be okay with Tommy Layne and Tazawa. I think we need less experiments in the Pen. Experiments are Ogando, Barnes, Breslow, Ross Jr... just too many.  Experiments I am okay with in 2016: Kelly (if he wants), Hembree (need to get him up one year), Pat Light (if he finds himself in Pawtucket). Then you can also look at Workman if he bounces back nicely from TJS.   I'd trade Koji at the deadline. I'd try to buy Aroldis Chapman. Reds have weak prospects and are due for an overhaul. I'd give them a real good one for Chapman. We can afford Chapman. I just wouldn't give up Espinoza, Kopech, Devers, Swihart, Moncada. That means they have their choice of Owens, Margot, Guerra, Holt.. ect..  Other relievers I would look at, Tyler Clippard, try to sign Darren O'Day (I'd love him pls), Joakim Soria is backup plan for closer, and see if anyone wants to dump someone on a bad contract.  Really looking at our bullpen situation, I say you gotta pull a deal on Koji, and then look for Chapman, and if you can't get him, see if you can grab K-Rod. If we trade Koji, I want another closer on our team before the trade deadline passes."

That being said, I wouldn't be buying at the deadline so prospects aren't really on the table anyway.   I'd love to sell Napoli, Uehara and Victorino.

redsox,3dlisi,walczyk,5,Fri Jul 17 06:22:32 2015 UTC,"Holt at first when Pedroia is back is obvious move. Panda is always a streaky hitter. He stays at third and stays on our team. Porcello stays in our rotation because typically you don't just give up on a 26 year old pitcher after half a season. If you did, then there would be a whole lot more 26 year old pitchers on the trade market."

So that's clubhouse chemistry, right? Then Hanley was moving from SS to LF. He got to bulk up and play a less demanding position... which should result in fewer injuries. Not to mention he is a few years younger than Nelson Cruz... and in half a season of playing in 2013, he had 22 HR and came in #8 in the NL MVP voting. So.. there was questions on defense.. but if you would remember we took a guy that played 2b and now he is an above average defender in CF... so we then take a SS and convert him to the smallest LF in the majors. Why would we expect what we got? It's absurd to rate things on hindsight. I'd win millions if I knew the outcome of the lottery. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go to sleep.

redsox,3demf3,dinero2180,14,Wed Jul 15 17:51:01 2015 UTC,"Gorden Edes can be hit or miss. Here are some of my own notes and thoughts on his article just to break it down a bit and give my opinion.  John Farrell: D  Agreed with the grade, to be certain, but some of his arguments for that grade are weak.   It can't help but be a reflection on the manager when a star player is in the can on Instagram midgame, multiple players lose track of outs   Yes, it can. Farrell sat Panda the following game. He can't prevent all bad behavior from players but at least he responded to it in some way. Losing track of outs is bad but when it was, say, Mookie thinking there were 2 outs when there were 3 that's not that bad. The other way would be worse. Meaning, thinking it's 3 outs and it's 2.    sloppiness abounds on the field and on the base paths, and he has to take blame for pitching to Nelson Cruz with a base open in the ninth inning.   Okay, yeah, fair points all around there. Pitching to Nelson Cruz is just one of the multitude of Farrell's in-game fuck ups. There are so many. I think Edes should have just focused on listing them. Like, for instance, leaving Ogando in the last game before the break entirely too long and anytime he has elected to play Breslow or Napoli.  Clay Buchholz: B   A 5.73 ERA in his first seven starts, a 1.99 ERA in the next 10, and now another trip to the disabled list for Buchholz, with a highly uncertain return date. The Sox can't count on him being a factor in the second half.   Yeah. I would add, shame on people like me who bought into a resurgence of Clay. Regardless of it being 2013 or 2015, he's good for 9 - 10 starts and then little else. I agree with Edes, too, that Buc is going to be 100% unreliable moving forward this season (at the very least).  Steven Wright: C+  He gave Wright a C+ which I disagree with completely. Wright is better than that and has gotten the shit-end of Farrell's stick. ESPECIALLY when Breslow is given a C- (and he deserves a D, at most) you can't give Wright a C+, I would argue.   Barnes got a D- but deserves an F. Bogaerts deserves an A+ not an A-   Other than that, decent article from Edes."

redsox,3demf3,UberGroove14,2,Thu Jul 16 00:45:22 2015 UTC,he's juuuuuuust barely clawed his way back to 0.0 WAR -- before that he was negative despite his offense. that's how bad his fielding was. literally one of the worst left fielders ever in the major leagues.
redsox,3demf3,lislislislislis,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:52:40 2015 UTC,"Yup, but I don't think anybody would actually argue that his poor defense (and you are correct it historically bad defense he is playing) has really counteracted his offense so much that he is worth a replacement player."

His off-field stuff is fine - problems happen like they will with any team, but they're dealt with and never escalate.

redsox,3demf3,UberGroove14,2,Wed Jul 15 18:23:22 2015 UTC,I fully agree but I will cringe every game just noticing that Hanley is in LF while Holt is at 1B. I mean Holt is mister super utility and we are going to put him at the easiest position on the field because of Hanley.
redsox,3demf3,Stevedave936,2,Wed Jul 15 18:27:29 2015 UTC,"I could see Hanley and Holt splitting 1B. Hanley will have to be the moving piece, I think. Sometimes playing 1B (Holt to LF or 3B if Panda needs a night off or something or even to RF if Vic continues to be Vic and gets injured), sometimes in LF, sometimes in DH, sometimes the night off.  That's how he should be used, I would argue. But just like with ""Cy"" Kelly and Breslow, I don't ever want to see Napoli on the field during a Sox game unless we're up by a whole fuck-ton of runs."

Fastball up to 99 mph, plus curveball, feel for a changeup, pounds the strike zone and mixes his pitches like a veteran, not a 17-year-old kid. I would take him over any of the pitchers in the 2015 draft, which is really saying something given that if Espinoza were born in the United States, he wouldn't even be draft-eligible until next season."

Hanley is raking; he may be a pain in the ass defensively, but he's raking and will be a DH when Ortiz leaves, which will happen at some point.  Pablo is playing the worst of his career, but he's still serviceable, and can improve in the second half.    Percello has been garbage, but I don't think he can stay this bad forever.  He's pretty young, and has a durable arm.  I think it's something in his head right now that hopefully he can work out.    The thing about the Red Sox?  They can afford an albatross or two.

We all thought the Lackey deal was terrible, and he ended up playing a huge role in the 2013 WS run.  These players are proven veterans with a history of success, you can't write them off so soon.

redsox,3di7ux,saturatedproper,0,Thu Jul 16 18:05:07 2015 UTC,"In reality it is.  It's very hard to acquire a younger front line starter, and the young guys you don't really have to pay anyway.  To get those guys you really need to wait until they hit FA or right before it, and at that point you are going to have to pay them into their 30s if you want to sign/keep them.  At some point they need to realize that overpaying a 4th starter for the last two to three years of a deal is the cost of doing business and the price you need to pay to get three to four years of a dominant top of the rotation starter.  It sucks, but it's the only way you're going to get them unless you develop them yourself.    And if you develop them you have a guy making league minimum at the top of the rotation while you are paying the 4th guy top dollars.  EDIT: Saying they will only pay guys under 30 is like me saying I refuse to drink water that's wet.  Technically I guess I'm open to dry water, but in reality I'm not going to find any."
redsox,3di7ux,Beelzebot44,3,Thu Jul 16 16:46:18 2015 UTC,The problem is all of the front line pitchers want long deals which the Red Sox aren't willing to give.

redsox,3di7ux,dtrb32,-1,Thu Jul 16 21:25:26 2015 UTC,"That's proven to be a questionable strategy.  Say a guy does improve.  You're getting two to three ""improving"" years where he's a mid rotation guy and then the three or four ace years.  If you sign the proven guy, you're getting two to three ace years and then three or four decline years were he's a mid rotation guy.

The future is extremely bright and this season can be attributed to incredible underperformed of some players, especially Napoli, Porcello and Sandoval. Ramirez is a great addition to the team but he needs to be off the field, with him we have secured our DH for the future with Papi's impeding retirement in one or two years. They also have a bunch of spending money with all the expiring contracts that would allow them to go get a pitcher in the off season. The franchise is fine even with the horrible 2014 and disappointing 2015."
redsox,3di7ux,theAnswer42,4,Thu Jul 16 14:19:15 2015 UTC,"Hanley looks bad right now because he has been terrible in left. He has looked better recently, even though he is still nowhere near replacement level out there. He looked terrible at the plate in May while he was nursing his shoulder. Even with a terrible month after that injury and his terrible fielding, his WAR on the season is still 0. Obviously playing at replacement level isn't good, but if he was DH he would be a huge asset to our team. It just so happens that our current DH is 39. He will be fine."
redsox,3di7ux,Karma_Chamillionaire,4,Thu Jul 16 14:48:53 2015 UTC,"People need to lay off of Hanley a little. Sure he's probably one of the worst defenders in Red Sox history, but at least he's finally shown some hustle in left in the past two weeks. On top of that, he'll be moved out of left (and maybe the field entirely) at the first available opportunity."
redsox,3di7ux,gustamos,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:00:56 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more. Right now he's world-historically awful in left field. If he could improve to dismal, or even just embarrassing, he would be a significant asset to the team.  I still believe in Ortiz. I feel like he wants to be Ted Williams and retire  in his 40s, and there's still somewhat of a chance I think he could do it."

We have an amazing core of cheap, young players already producing at the big league level (X, Betts, ERod), with even more blue chip prospects on the way (Swihart, Castillo, Moncada, Owens, etc).  Plus some good veteran pieces signed long term (Pedroia, Porcello, Hanley, Panda)  There aren't many franchises in baseball right now that are more healthy than the Red Sox."

He's a young, proven pitcher so he will figure it out.  And Panda is playing exactly how Panda has always played, with just slightly worse defense.  If you are surprised at all by Panda's performance so far, then you must not have any clue who is in the first place so your expectations were baseless."

I wasn't opposed tot he signing, but he wasn't brought in (I hope) to be the ace.  He's a mid-rotation guy that they overpaid.  But you have to overpay for pitching sometimes, so if he can get back to even an average pitcher I'm ok with it.  They have shown the willingness to spend money, so it's not like his contract is going to prevent signing someone else.  They set limits on the salary for specific players, but they don't seem to have a limit for the team itself."

That's like a starting point as they would want both Rod and Johnson to double their odds of getting a good pitcher to replace Gray and then they would want high ceiling position players like Swihart and Devers along with a lottery ticket player or two. It would be a crazy package to get the AL ERA leader who happens to be 25 and under team control for 4.5 more seasons. Not worth exploring."

redsox,3de9tc,Gingerbreadmancan,2,Wed Jul 15 18:29:06 2015 UTC,I find it hard to believe that Beane didn't want someone in our farm system. Or he might have thought whatever he asked for would be too much for Cherington.   I don't know.
redsox,3de9tc,theAnswer42,2,Wed Jul 15 18:33:34 2015 UTC,"One of the keys of the trade was that Beane anted a replacement third basement and he was/is really high in Brett Lawrie, we didn't have anyone to offer him for third base especially after Middlebrooks exhausted all his value."
redsox,3de9tc,njgreenwood,2,Wed Jul 15 18:42:28 2015 UTC,"I think /u/theAnswer42 nailed it, Lawrie was the goal. Though Beane could've had that in WMB."

redsox,3de9tc,OhRatFarts,0,Wed Jul 15 18:09:46 2015 UTC,IMHO his versatility far supersedes his great offensive numbers.  The Sox know this; other teams know this.  The Sox rejected every deal for him this winter.
redsox,3de9tc,ThePaddingtonBear,7,Wed Jul 15 18:28:05 2015 UTC,He's a nice piece. Unlike those other guys he's not untouchable.
redsox,3de9tc,OhRatFarts,0,Wed Jul 15 18:09:55 2015 UTC,See here
redsox,3de9tc,ThePaddingtonBear,4,Wed Jul 15 18:28:40 2015 UTC,Bogaerts:  22  Betts:  22  Rodriguez:  22  Holt:  27  Then there's the respective pedigrees.
redsox,3de9tc,OhRatFarts,-1,Wed Jul 15 18:35:53 2015 UTC,"pedigrees   Everyone was bitching about Holt's ""bad pedigree"" with respect to why he shouldn't start in place of Middlebrooks.  How did that turn out?  But, if you insist, let's look at their minor league careers:  Betts:     4 seasons, .315/.408/.470/.877 Holt:      6 seasons, .307/.372/.410/.782    Bogaerts:  4 seasons, .296/.373/.489/.862      Only issue on his ""bad pedigree"" is he has no power, he can't hit HRs.  HRs don't mean much.  He makes up for it with his speed and gets above average 2Bs and 3Bs to bring his SLG up closer to the other two.  Is that making him a bad hitter? Look at him, obviously not.  But what Holt brings to the table is that he can successfully play 7 positions.  How many have Bogaerts or Betts played? A total of 5 between them.    You also fail to realize everyone develops at different times.  For example, anyone who puts money on this 16-year-old girl from France who just joined the International Registration is a moron.  It is very rare for a child prodigy to stay that.  Others develop and catch up.  Back to Holt, he is invaluable because he can play everywhere well and hits well above replacement level.  If no injuries, he rotates through giving everyone a day off.  When an injury pops up, he fills in that role, and fills it in well.  You'd be a moron if you trade him away.  And the Sox know this as well as other teams, they denied IIRC 3 trades for Holt."
redsox,3de9tc,ThePaddingtonBear,4,Wed Jul 15 19:27:31 2015 UTC,"what Holt brings to the table is that he can successfully play 7 positions. How many have Bogaerts or Betts played? A total of 5 between them.   ... because they're good enough players that the team wants to find and stick with a primary position.    Only issue on his ""bad pedigree"" is he has no power, he can't hit HRs.   That and you've entirely ignored the age advancement scale.  Look, I like Holt. He's a phenomenal utility man. He'd probably be an averagish starter at 2B, but he's almost assuredly not going to get that chance on this team. If they can find a team willing to pay full time starter value in a trade, then I'd take it. If not I'm perfectly happy to keep him in his current role. But putting him in a class with those other guys is simply ridiculous. There's no two ways about it."
redsox,3de9tc,Blanketsburg,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:45:27 2015 UTC,"While I'm not a blind optimist on Holt, there's no reason to outright refuse that Holt could turn into the next Ben Zobrist. Obviously less power, but batting average-wise they had pretty similar minor league careers."
redsox,3de9tc,Gingerbreadmancan,2,Thu Jul 16 19:30:19 2015 UTC,Only way I see a trade happening with the A's for Gray is if Beane has another mental lapse (à la Donaldson).
redsox,3de9tc,Blanketsburg,2,Wed Jul 15 17:18:48 2015 UTC,Donaldson was going to price himself out of Oakland regardless.
redsox,3de9tc,Gingerbreadmancan,0,Thu Jul 16 19:26:57 2015 UTC,"I doubt highly it's going to happen. If it did happen, I imagine Holt, Mookie and Xander would be off the table.   I'm just playing ""what if"" here. If we were to trade for Sonny Gray, who would you feel okay parting with? Realistically?"
redsox,3de9tc,OhRatFarts,2,Wed Jul 15 17:26:34 2015 UTC,"If it did happen, I imagine Holt, Mookie and Xander would be off the table"
redsox,3de9tc,theAnswer42,-1,Wed Jul 15 17:55:54 2015 UTC,"No one.  The A's aren't a selling team.  They're more out of it then us (we're 14% odds, they're 7% odds as of today). They'd be looking to the future which would keep them from putting Gray even on the table.  And the only people I'd ever be ok parting with, the A's wouldn't want because 1) the player(s) suck [edit: or simply aren't good enough for this deal] and b) A's would want someone for a longer term to rebuild with.   If we were to try to get Gray for a run this year, we'd have to give up at least 2 youngins/prospects.  Not worth it for us.  Our pitching problems can be solved internally anyways, but I'm pretty sure Cherington is too dumb to know what to do.  But it's all moot as Gray won't even be on the table until the 2017 trade window at the earliest, and most likely in reality the 2019 trade window.  And this of course is dependent on how the A's are doing then.  EDIT: the ONLY person I would consider to trade away would be Swihart as Vazquez is our starter when he returns and Swihart is too good to be a backup.  But like above, the A's wouldn't be interested in Swihart, they got Vogt.  As far as ""what if's"" go, this has to be the one of the most crazy of them all up among things like ""what if the Red Sox used Ted Williams' frozen head and made 8 clones."""
redsox,3de9tc,OhRatFarts,3,Wed Jul 15 17:58:42 2015 UTC,"Want a really good What if. Sonny Gray was one pick away from being picked by us in 2011.  Edit: Who says Vazquez is our starter when he gets back, they are going to compete in spring training to see which one is and then they are going to platoon."
redsox,3de9tc,theAnswer42,0,Wed Jul 15 18:11:45 2015 UTC,"Vazquez was the best framer in baseball when he was up last year, and by a good margin at that.  Someone here posted how large the strike zone got when he caught vs. an average catcher.   Vazquez was going to be the starter this year with Old Man Hanigan as his backup (then we got León and Hanigan became starter)  Vazquez has put up better offensive numbers in both AAA-ball and the bigs.  Vazquez is far superior at getting runners out (52%) compared to Swihart (29%)  Healing of catcher TJ surgeries isn't anything like that for a pitcher.  They only have a few hard throws to do a game.  Pitchers gotta throw hard 100+ pitches or so.  No need to panic if he'll be the same like often pitchers aren't.   Any ""platooning"" will either be a day-game-after-night-game substitution or if Buch has his panties in a bunch only wanting to pitch to one of them.  Either are not considered platooning, with the former very common.  Having Hanigan here and trading Swihart yields the best value for us."
redsox,3de9tc,canadacanadadry,3,Wed Jul 15 18:20:42 2015 UTC,"Of course Vazquez was going to be our starter this year, this was going to be Swihart's first year of complete triple AAA. You're comparing a fully developed catcher in Vazquez with one that was rushed and still has time to develop into something better. Also with all the problems with have had with catchers being hurt this year I think it would be better if they hold on to the both of them."
redsox,3de9tc,yoitss,2,Wed Jul 15 18:31:41 2015 UTC,"Can we let ""Hot Rod"" die already?  That said, would Owens, Margot, JBJ, Guerra, lottery ticket type get it done?

redsox,3dc78u,metatron207,4,Wed Jul 15 03:29:44 2015 UTC,"If you subcribe to WAR (either version), he's not that far off from being one of the Top 20 position players in baseball. Yeah, some of that is CF defense and the positional adjustment, but there are plenty of CFs who aren't in that Top 20.  Edit: I looked it up, and his numbers are even better than I realized. rWAR has Betts at 4.2 (already near All-Star quality for a full season); that's good for 8th-best in the AL, including pitchers, and tied with Buster Posey for 13th-best in MLB, again including pitchers. fWAR rates Betts significantly worse, but sees him as the 16th-best player in the AL (10th-best position player) and tied for 31st-best player in MLB (tied for 21st-best position player, with fellow young'un Joc Pederson) with 3.1 WAR.  Among CFs, fWAR has Betts as tied with Pederson for 5th, behind Mike Trout, Lorenzo Cain, AJ Pollock, and Andrew McCutchen. rWAR has Betts behind only Trout and Cain. I'll say that again: both major WAR conventions rate Mookie Betts as a top-5 center fielder in all of MLB this season. And if you needed more evidence that this isn't just the positional adjustment inflating Mook's value, both rWAR and fWAR put his offensive contributions as more than double the value of his defensive contributions."

redsox,3dc78u,metatron207,3,Wed Jul 15 04:13:16 2015 UTC,"See the edit to my comment below. Both WAR conventions rate Mookie as one of the best CFs in the majors this year. None of his numbers pop--he's not going to steal 60 bases, he won't hit 40 homers, his BA is below .300 and his OBP is hovering around .330--but he's an extremely well-rounded player, and he has been one of the best Red Sox/outfielders/American Leaguers/professional baseball players this year."
