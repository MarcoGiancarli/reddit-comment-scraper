They may also offer support if you decide to report your boss. If you do decide to report him, have someone go with you if it makes you feel better. Whether it's a friend or university counselor, you can have someone go with you to the police station without them necessarily having to be there while you file a report."

Kid A is dead and missed dearly so kid B jumps in and pretends they were best friends and tries to move in with the parents and manipulate them...Like what are you trying to prove? Its people like this that keep me up at night and make my stomach churn. Its people like this that really show how awful the world we live in is.  Edit: Just reread this and the ending and yours is wayyyy crazier.

Theres always people trying to manipulate the situation, theres always people saying they were close that weren't."
badpeoplestories,3dnsgb,Cozzafrenz,4,Fri Jul 17 20:27:34 2015 UTC,"Hahaha I read your post and that's what made me remember this, actually!   J was in the Navy years before this, he joined as soon as he was 18 so he got out pretty young. This all happened in like 2010-2011 so he was probably 23 or 24 at the time. He's not intimidating but I've seen him get in fights and he gets crazy. I'm sure that's what saved his ass a lot. But after this he literally had a mob after him so he would have put up a good fight but ultimately lost.   This will probably make me sound like a bitch but whatever.  By best friend was murdered in 2009. Obviously I was really upset the day of his funeral (side note: his death paired with an abusive relationship all happening around the same time fucked me up pretty bad and I ended up using heroin and pills to ""deal with it"". This is before the drugs so you can guess where I was mentally). I got word that this girl that my friends, including best friend, and I hated was planning on showing up to his funeral.   I was NOT having it. I called her and told her that she knew he hated her, so her showing up at his funeral was disrespectful and if I saw her there then I would personally make sure she learned her place. She sat in the parking lot while the people she was with attended the funeral.   During that same funeral I noticed that a girl that best friend hated with a passion was sitting a few rows behind me. I was pissed because I knew she hated him as well but at this point I was more concerned with bawling my eyes out. This bitch was texting during the whole funeral and didn't even bother to turn her phone on vibrate. I turned in my pew so fast and a friend that was sitting behind her later told me he's never seen anyone give someone the type of death glare I gave her. I walked up to the girl after the funeral and calmly told her that she's lucky that we are where we are and I respect his family as much as I do but she better hope to god that I never see her again.   I don't understand why people do that stuff. I went to rehab and worked in treatment so I unfortunately have seen many friends lose their lives to addiction. Even though I was somewhat friends with them, I would never in my wildest dreams act like we were better friends than we were. And I especially wouldn't go to the funeral of someone that I know didn't like me just simply out of respect for their friends and family. People are disgusting."

I have talked to numerous friends and asked them what I should do. Alot of them told me that I should confront the parents, like everyone on here has. And I've done some pretty heavy thinking about it.  And honestly...This would just cause a huge fight, and it would fuck everything up. They would get enraged pissed at me.

badpeoplestories,3diosn,King_Groovy,6,Fri Jul 17 20:00:56 2015 UTC,"like 2003-04 or so, I had a cyst right in the crease of your body where your leg attaches to your torso. I was taking my morning dump one Thursday morning when I reached down to scratch my boys, I noticed a little pea sized lump down there. So naturally I panicked ""holy fuck! A lump!! A LUMP ON MY BALLS!! HOLY FUCKING FUCK A LUMP ON MY BALLS!!"". So I went to the doctor and found out it was just a cyst. He told me to do warm compresses, and that we'd see how it was on Monday, and that we'd just make an appointment to get it taken care of. Well two days later it grew to the size of what felt like a ping pong ball. I called the doctor's office (by now it was Saturday) and he called me back and told me to go to the ER. I took a shower before heading to the hospital, and while drying off, I felt it pop. Now I have this bulging fluid pressing up against my sack. It needed to be cut, drained, and packed. Being that it was actually right in the crease of your skin, I needed two stitches after all the packing was removed. Those two stitches were the hardest earned I've ever received   Side Note: Laying on your back and looking down to see your doctor removing packing from your crotch like a magician's hankerchief is the most unreal thing you will ever see without the aid of hallucinogenic drugs  EDIT: cleaning up muh spellers and grammers"

This is a wonderful thought, but i have a question: What if they come with thoughts of things you never want to think about? How do you recommend getting over those awful times in order to be at peace with those scars and that they signify such trauma?  Yeah, AskingReddit now too..."
badpeoplestories,3diosn,King_Groovy,2,Wed Jul 22 01:38:57 2015 UTC,"Reddit doesn't have the answers you're looking for. Your answers are within you. Everyone can appreciate how much a punch in the face hurts, but only the victim understands ths sting. Only you can truly understand what you've been through and how deeply they've affected you. You are the only one in the history of the universe with your specific point of view, so it is up to you to become strong enough to overcome your pain. It is your responsibility to know yourself. As infinite as the universe is outward, that's how infinite your mind is inward. You never stop learning about yourself, and the more you know yourself, the more equipped you'll be to deal with your problems.   I have dozens and dozens of memories no one should ever have, so let me save you a bit of wasted time.... the only way out is through. We don't realize it but we spend a lot of time trying to wriggle our way around the hurt of this world instead of standing tall and saying ""Fuck you!! You're not backing me down!"". It took me a long time to realize that inner strength and confidence is the only way to look pain in the eye and make IT back down, and the only way to build upon that strength is to become fearless. And the only way to become fearless is to find your ""fuck it"" place. Deep down inside you there's a place where you just don't give a fuck anymore. When you find that place , and focus your thoughts inward, you're going to become stronger and even more fearless until you wake up one morning and you realize that the people who you thought were so scary are actually rather small. You begin to see the invisible wall people put in front of themselves to shield them from the uncomfortableness of life. Then you begin to realize how much stronger and more equipped you are to handle the rest of the world than they are because you can see they've only taken their thoughts so far. You can see how lost and blind they are, and then you begin to pity them (but not completely, because fuck them, they're jerks). And then you just shake your head at what a waste it is  And before you begin to think of how sad and dreary my explanation is, you need to realize that when you've gotten that far, you'll finally be ready to recognize the important people that cross your path. The good and loving people that you've always wanted in your life will suddenly jump right out at you, and you'll look back and understand why you turned your back on those other pricks in the first place. You'll never feel alone again because you'll have surrounded yourself with the right people... and then you'll realize that those people and millions other like them didn't just suddenly appear. They've always been there. You just weren't in the right frame of mind to notice   It's taken me 40 years to come to some of these realizations. I hope I could help you"

When she was leaving, an officer spotted her and followed her all the way home and confronted her about it. He had already started a ticket for her and everything. She ended up removing her leg to show him that she was in fact disabled. His response was that even if she had an amputation, she shouldn't park there since she seemed to walk fine with her prosthetic, not getting the fact that walking 10 feet to your car with a prosthetic is completely different than walking through a packed parking lot (Christmas time) full of ice."

It was more naivete than patience, everyone gets bullied some way or another as a kid and that's how we learn to draw the line. Mine was a little more...bizarre...but I'm grateful that I eventually learned to stand up for myself :)       I almost became atheist for that very reason before I realized it was the church group I hated, not the belief. At the end i even did Biblical research into the oppressive things my old church was teaching and a lot of it was unfounded or even contradictory to what was there. (Jesus actually advocated for respecting women, although due to cultural differences in some areas there were different sets of advice on how to go about achieving that in each nation.) So I stayed Christian because I wasn't going to let a group of sick people ruin my beliefs, and so far all the churches I've gone to since then basically teach that everyone is responsible for the consequences of their own behavior, and no one has the right to judge each other. But I can understand why you left, the initial surge of anger and hurt at being oppressed like that can be overwhelming, at times it took everything I had not to just go ""fuck you all, I'm done"".

She had some books that were pure comedy gold. It was the height of the grunge era, a time I had hair down to my shirt pockets, and I discovered through one of these ""sacred"" texts that long hair on men was an abomination against God. Why? Because of some obscure Jewish law about men baring their heads before praying, while women should wear a veil. Apparently, in this author's reckoning, a woman is allowed to have a ""veil"" of long hair, while if a man has such a ""veil,"" it is against the natural order and a sin.

Therefore, it is tainted with sin and imperfect. Not exactly very confidence-inspiring in terms of taking every word of it literally as... well, as gospel.  Hey, I like the Bible.

I specifically ran a food pantry where people could chose what they wanted and people by and large took less than they sere allowed when they got to just pick things that they would use.   Maybe something very important to her is coming up, like she is seeing a child she hasn't seen in years, and she wants to look how she looked then.   I don't know. I find that people rarely just feel like they are entitled to anything and everything. Instead, they see things like this kind of a haircut as an opportunity to feel like they do have some dignity."

badpeoplestories,3bgjz1,SpaghettiTuesdays23,7,Tue Jun 30 08:27:28 2015 UTC,"People are just mean over all. They don't know how to communicate what they want, and don't bring anything for reference but get mad when you do the exact thing they explained. Or the come in wanting straight across fringe and once you cut it they FREAK out and it's always your fault when really, it was a big change and they end up liking it in a day or two.   Once a girl I was in school with, let's call her jabber jaw , had her friends mom, Mandark, come in. She wanted a perm so she was referred to this girl, T. T was the sweetest, tiniest, little homeschooled country girl I've ever met. She never got mad, she would do anything for anyone, and didn't ever talk bad about anyone. She was also naturally great and doing perms and was the only person that didn't hate doing them, so Mandark booked with her.   Mandark had a short haircut. Like a pixie cut but for a middle aged woman that looks like she's in a midlife crisis. So, T had to use smaller perm rods to roll her hair. Everything was going fine, the woman was pretty rude over all. When T was done blowing the woman's hair dry after she finished the perm, the woman lost her shit. She was screaming in front of the whole school and other clients, cussing, yelling about how ""that's not what she wanted"" ""she has family pictures today"" and ""the curls are too small and tight and she looks like a poodle!"" Along with calling T names and making her cry.  The instructor came over at this point and she usually has the ""the client is always right"" mentality. Not this time. She tried staying professional, but you could tell it was getting pretty hard for her. Mandark fucked up when she called T names and made her cry. I think at that point every student and teacher in that school wanted punch her in the face AT LEAST once. I know I did. The teacher basically just made her look like a fool. Basically the instructor asked if she's ever had a perm done before to which Mandark replied that she gets them all the time. So the instructor told her that she should have known that the curls are going to be tight the first few days after getting them and that she should have known better to schedule family pictures the day she was getting a perm. Mandark left and never came back. He daughter wasn't much better of a person.   Also, one time I was cutting this girls hair that I hadn't seen in like 10+ years and her mom was with her. Her mom was rude from the start but I just ignored it. She came and sat at the girls station next to mine to talk to her daughter. I don't care normal, but that girl had a client. So I told her in the kindest way possible ""I'm sorry! She has a client right now and she's gonna need that seat when she's done washer her hair!"" So she had to go sit in the waiting room. I then kept hearing her on the phone with someone loudly calling me a bitch. To the point where the students and clients who witnessed what I said to her where getting upset. I just laughed about it. I waited till they were leaving to go stand by the door with a friend and say loud enough for her to hear ""some older women are just so angry and bitter. Oh well, sucks to suck"" then smiled at her and watched her leave even more angry.   I don't understand why people that are SO PICKY about their hair would go to a beauty college to get it done. It's rare we ever mess up someone's hair, we have instructors that make sure we don't and we don't start taking clients until we pass certain tests. But there's still a very slim chance it could happen, just like in a salon. But people act like we're supposed to be the most experienced stylists in the whole world."
badpeoplestories,3bgjz1,BaddieBot,5,Tue Jun 30 16:14:28 2015 UTC,You're triggering memories Ohmygod. I had this woman come in and have no idea what she wanted. We looked at some books and she found a pixie cut she liked (standard pixie cut) and asked if she was sure she wanted to go that short. She said yes. I do exactly what the picture in the book looked like to her hair and she flips the fuck out saying I hacked off all of her hair and that it's too short and I ruined everything. She caused some mental scaring. I always ask my clients a million times now how much they want off if it's more than two inches and I will continue to double check with them. If I get someone who wants a dramatic length change I want to crawl in a hole.   That woman made me cry for a long time.   And in school you're trying so hard to do your best and learn and you know there's a chance you'll mess up so you try even harder so you don't have that experience... And you still end up in the bathroom crying eventually.

HeliMom always made such judgments for him. She too was legit crazy and often fully admitted he was her entire life because her marriage was so horrible she found her only will to live in parenting him. Which is just a whole can of worms in itself. Gah.  I immensely approve. Don't forget my inappropriate shoulders :P"

I had a wonderful career until 2 years ago when I was badly assaulted, and still on meds for PTSD and GAD, buy my hubbie is amazingly supportive.  When I am more stable we are moving back to the US, and I can't wait. Wendys and Walmart !  My Dad died last year, there was a lot of healing, crying and talking. I didn't see them for 10 years, and they had changed, enough now that Mum visited (had to fly over as we live on other sides of the country) and we really bonded. I didn't know that they both had major mental health issues (what child can understand) and I have accepted the apology.  The thing is now I look back now, and I see how I grew to be independent at such a young age,then spent my adolescence and early life traveling. Traveling seemed to put everything in perspective, my issues were nothing compared to the children in Bratislava begging and hunting rats to take home to eat. Seeing people in Vietnam, that had been burned or hurt in that useless war, who am I to say I suffered. Compared to the western world child, yes, but the millions of children that don't have a choice, or a means to escape, they are the ones that truly suffer.  Getting everything out on here is really cathartic, and I am about to disengage from the memories.  Wow.... sorry that was a long answer."

A lot of people don't understand, and I hope they're never in a situation where they really have to. I'm a recovering heroin addict and I worked in rehabs for a few years. Seeing people come in during their addiction and seeing them become their selves again is pretty crazy. Usually a huge difference. That being said, it's very, very rare to see someone addicted to weed. I feel like this guy is kind of just an asshole.   Way to put your foot down.

You're enabling him. He knows he can keep pulling this crap because someone else will just come try to save him when one of you gets tired of it. He's not going to stop. He needs help, and he won't be willing to get it until he has no one and nothing left.   You and your family need to all tell him that you're all cutting him off completely and the only way he's going to get your help is by going to rehab, completing rehab, and staying sober. And you need to mean it. Also, someone suggested calling the cops on him when you know he has drugs on him. That's good advice, just make sure he isn't with TB if you do it, or in their house.   This behavior doesn't mean he's a bad person. I mean, while using he is, of course. But I'm not nearly the same person when I'm sober that I am when I'm using. Most people aren't.   If/when you and your family put your foot down, he'll probably be pretty mad at you guys for a while.

But obviously not.   I've worked with many victims of sexual abuse while working in rehabs, not to mention I've personally gone through it, and seen many of them speak this way about it. Not all, but a lot. Like she said, at some point people learn to disassociate emotions with the facts. That's what some of us have to do to deal with it."

If that doesn't happen, it's on you to remove yourself from the situation that is making you unhappy or hurt.  There are bad people in the world, yes. It sounds like you are intimately acquainted with several of them.  When we surround ourselves with bad people, we will lead a life at their level.  The trick to a good, happy life is to surround ourselves with good, happy people.  Now, I know you just intended this to be a vent, but hey - I've been where you are, and it's amazing how happy that removing yourself from the situation and those that strive to continue the conflict makes you."

It worked good until he started doing it and she started sending me links to the photos. I loved her very much, I wanted to salvage a relationship with her if nothing else. I see now that I was stupid for that, but I can't go back and change things. I removed them both and blocked them the day they posted the picture that bothered me the most. And that is when the shit storm ensued."

It's very common for women to stay with partners who have abused their child, and for the life of my I cannot fathom why.  I think abusers pick women who will allow themselves and their kids to be treated this way... But you stood up for yourself.  You're not the same as your mother, you are a strong person.  You can get through this, and fuck the drama-mongers and people who thrive off of other people's business.  And it's okay to be angry and disappointed in your mother.  She has made choices in her life to willfully lie to herself and others in order to cling onto a relationship that is bankrupt.  People have to deal with the consequences of their choices and should not always be forgiven.  They need to know what their choices cost.    Sorry."

You must never expect anything unrealistic from her again if you don't want to feel betrayed again. It took me almost 50 years to figure this out. My mother was a psychopath. I'm sorry to say it but don't think yours is any better.  Psychopaths do not change because they do not think they're wrong. About anything. Ever. They are very sad people in real life and make the worst parents imaginable. I know. I wish I didn't. When we delude ourselves into thinking we can change them, we cause ourselves enormous and unnecessary pain. There is no way around this. The only thing to do is to become emotionally independent of her. It can be done and the sooner the better.  Cut your mother, grandmother, etc. loose. You do not need any of these folks in your head or in your life. Make a clean break. You don't need to defend yourself. You don't need to prove anything to anyone. Hold you head high, walk away from the mess and learn to live a happy life. There is nothing that will make you feel better."

Please consider speaking with a councillor about what has happened with you in the past and what is happening now. There are also support groups for those that have been sexually assaulted and abused. It is great that you have a supportive husband and friend, but sometimes it helps to have people to talk to that have experienced similar things.  Also, pleas also consider talking to the police regarding the past rapes as there is a good chance that your attackers will go on to do the same things to other people. You should also report it in case anyone ever tries to say that you slandered their name."

Then you refuse attest your capability in the way they ask you to , and instead start to threathen everyone with media and lawsuits BASED ON BEING DISABLED.

(Easily investigated by computer.)    4) I offered to do a behind the wheel test in a car if they wanted to test my abilities.  5) The form they wanted me to submit required information that was none of their damn business and had absolutely nothing to do with driving a car.

One does not get a drivers license for 10 years. At the time, it had to be re-upped every 2 years. This means I had been evaluated every 2 years by my home state. I was willing to take the same tests as everyone else.    What you refuse to try understand is I wanted equal treatment. Not special treatment. What the hell does gynecological information have to do with driving? And yes, that was on the ""medical assessment"".   That is really funny in a pathetic way. I've jumped out of airplanes and ran a marathon and was a lot more active and looked it. Please. Do you have any idea what sort of hand strength it takes to play a pedal harp? Obviously not.

badpeoplestories,36a58h,Toiletsareforbabies,-22,Wed May 20 03:33:52 2015 UTC,I have been in poor countries where the average daily caloric intake for a child is less than 300 calories a day. I have seen people die from true starvation. I have seen emaciated fathers and mothers weep over the dead bodies of their Children who died from malnourishment.   I have no sympathy for any privleged westerner who would deliberately starve themself or deliberately throw up after eating in a quest to be thin or fit some ideal beauty standard and then blame a parent for being angry at their behavior.  Perhaps you should check your privlege.

When I decided to learn it, I acquired the sheet music and sang alone until I had mastered it. (I'm sure the cats were traumatized and my parrots didn't speak to me during the time.) I didn't let anyone hear it until it was presentable.  Unfortunately, there are those idiots who feel that ""OMG! This is MY song"" and caterwaul it without the benefit of any musical training.

What happened to you, is really fucked up, but it seems you have this now behind you, and have healed quite a bit already, and are on a good way. Is that correct ? I hope that you can heal to the point, where this is nothing but a bad memory, that has no influence over you any longer !!! May I ask how you managed to heal so good ?   A good friend of mine was abused (sexually, physically and psychologically) by her older brother for years, and just recently started to remember things. I always knew there is something wrong with her, and she knew too, but never what exactly. Then we had a one night stand, and I realized right away, she must have been sexually abused in her past. I then slowly and carefully started to talk about it with her, like what and why I had this suspicion. She still could not remember, but 2 days later she suddenly had a kind of flashback, where she suddenly remembered something. We got her professional help, and via hypnosis therapy they slowly recovered these memories, and we got her brother to confess to it all. Now she started to deal with these memories, and can start healing. I wanted to know if you have tips what could really help her, what kind of therapy, like group therapy, self help groups, 1on1 session with a therapist etc.etc. is the best ? What else helps ? But do not feel pressured in any way, if you do not want to talk about your therapy that is totally O.K. !!!"
badpeoplestories,359mpm,fuckherndafce,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:28:06 2015 UTC,"I didn't ever deal with the problems when I was younger, I really justthought that every family was like ours, perfect looking to the world but a festering wound underneath.  I am/was a Psychologist and I did find that it helped me realize that there are others and actual names for the trauma I experienced as a child. It kind of normalized it for me, knowing that it was abnormal (that probably doesn't make sense). I say 'was'as I technically am but I  was assaulted quite badly by a client and I never want to work in mental health again.   But, back to your friend, CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) with a one on one therapist may help to stop negative cycles when she suffers from flashbacks. CBT works by breaking down things that make you feel bad, anxious or scared. By making your problems more manageable, CBT can help you change your negative thought patterns and improve the way you feel. Once the behavioral and sensory symptoms are stablized then they can work on breaking down the seperate disorders that make up how she feels, such as anxiety, depression and self worth issues.   Personally I don't really believe in large group therapy for serious issues. I have PTSD and went to a few just to see how it would be talking to people that alsos suffer from PTSSD/Anxiety. It made me more depressed as others talked about- for example- marriage brake ups, loss of employment and generally all negative experiences.  Being able to talk to someone who will NOT judge you, but just listen is important. Let her talk, cry or just be there for her, is important.   Does all of that make sense, she needs to get to the place that she realizes that she isn't defined by her experiences but the suffering can make her stronger because she lived through the awful experiences and pain. They make her more resilient.  I hope that makes sense. I initially dealt with everything by escaping, around Australia then Europe. I feel that the escapism where no one knew my past helped meg et through everything, and I proved to myself I could survive interdependently."

I'm glad you have supportive friends and a sweet fat pup on your side. I wouldn't be alive if not for my pups.  You must get the fuck out of there as soon as you possibly can. I suppose you already suspect this is so.  Even a person without the slightest touch of seasonal affective disorder and a perfectly well balanced neurochemistry would become completely undone in a situation like the one you inhabit. It is toxic. Poisonous. Potentially causing life-long confusion and distress. Unhealthy, unwholesome and intolerable.  I was brought up in a similar situation. At 15 I ran away to live in abandoned buildings, panhandle for $ and eat out of trashcans. It was a vast improvement over what I had put up with in the parents' comfortable suburban home. I believe this act is what saved me from becoming a life-long psychological invalid like my sister who stayed far longer than is advisable and now lives on SSI and watches day-time TV.  Honestly there's a very good chance your problems are due almost entirely to the circumstances in which you are forced to live. Why blame your own brain when there's so much evidence that your problems actually originate outside of it?  I wonder why it's become so fashionable to attribute psychological problems to anything except horrible living conditions when it is so obvious that horrible living situations do cause horrible psychological trauma? Is it because pharmaceutical companies profit so much when brain chemistry is implicated and not at all when horrible living circumstances are entirely to blame?  You should know that there is not a single drug made by god or man, legal or illegal, that will make it possible for you to enjoy, or even endure, such corrosive circumstances unscathed. Not even hourly injections of heroin, or a lifetime's supply of fentanyl lollipops glazed with cocaine, will render the abuse you describe inconsequential. You need to gtfo of that mess. You are probably not mentally ill yet but long exposure to excessively toxic personalities like the ones you describe so well is how people become mentally ill."

To be fair, a lot of my problems were there before the move with Mother and Step-Douche. I will say a lot of it was what I was made into though. But the blame cannot be put solely on them. Of course, Step-Douche doesn't help make it better.  I'm aware drugs only dull it fora short period. Part of the reason why I don't want to be medicated. I do hope once I manage to wrangle the SAD beast I bare better, I can move away from the need to be around toxic people. Or if my mother would divorce the step-douche...

We live in a time when doctors just hand out pills. This is a culture created by pharmaceutical companies in order to profit at the expense of those in pain. It is evil. I had to learn this the hard way, which seems to be the only way I can learn anything.  The only way to solve such problems is to look into them yourself. Find out where they came from, how they act on your, how they limit your world and then, when you can look at the problems without judging you will have real understanding and you will solve them once and for all. It can be done and the result is crazy happy free joy etc.  It took me 50 years to solve all my problems (depression, drug-abuse, social phobias, anxiety) because I was so distracted by ideas instead of actualities, by psychiatrists and their loopy theories  and because I did tons of drugs to self-medicate. Like I said, it's always been the hard way for me. My sister says that I have to learn the hard way twice before I really learn. She's funny.  I wish you the best and hope it won't take you so long.

Either, dude grows a pair and a few more braincells, and realizes and admits to himself what's going on, or he doesn't and your relationship with him is SOL. In the first case, you need to be ready for that realization and be ready and able to forgive him. No strings attached. He fucked up, and he now knows it. Fucking up is human, and to expect more is irrational. What he and your relationship with him needs is grace. The last thing that your relationship with him needs is your anger towards him right then. That can come later once the air is cleared and the water is crystal in the form of seeking understanding. Once it's all out in the open between you two, the anger will subside without ever using it.  In the latter, well, it sucks. It really does. It hurts, and there's not much like the pain of losing a friend that close. The good news is that there's plenty of folks here, myself included, that are willing to listen. It's what this we're here for. That, and living vicariously through other folks' social situations, but eh. We've all got that one person that we utterly, absolutely find despicable. Those that don't aren't being honest with themselves. At least you're being honest, and that's a lot more than very many can do."

It's not a huge deal, I'm not close with the guy at all but this semester I had to do a group project and it was me, two other girls and this guy. Starts off a little quiet but it's fine, he's always late but what ever. Comes up that he's vegan because his girlfriend told him to, totally weird but brush it off, saw a picture and she's somehow gained weight eating vegan, weird. We exchange emails to share documents and he says he only uses his girlfriends email, and it was some anime character name not some easier to remember thing. On our group Facebook chat it constantly says he's read our messages but when he turns up to study (which is getting infrequent) so I'm figuring she checked them. Then he just stops turning up all together, didn't hand in his version of the assignment, when we do see him he has no explanation or apologies and generally looks like a kicked puppy pleading not to be hurt again. His Facebook page is covered in his girlfriend posting how wonderful he is and his degree is now non existent. It was the weirdest thing to be around."

You also meander, change the tense, flip-flop between points in the story, and refer to your ex as ""he"" and ""you"" off and on.   You also refer to your ex as a ""predator"", but why he's a predator is rather unclear. He cheated on you and spent money that he shouldn't have spent the way he did - he's definitely a douchebag for sure. But how is he a predator? That was not really explained.  Also, all-caps (TYPING LIKE THIS) is very hard to read, is abrasive, and comes off as yelling.   When you make a post, you're sharing it with the entire community with the assumption that it's quality.

I know it's really hard to leave relationships like yours, but you're the bigger person and you genuinely cannot help someone that isn't willing to help themselves. If it was just simply a mental disorder causing these problems, it's possible to get help, but not easy. However, it's not your job to put yourself in danger for the sake of rageboy.  Stay strong and reach for bigger and better things. Eventually you'll find your perfect someone. But don't rush it. Your happiness and health (Mentally, physically and emotionally) are far more important.  btw, I'm binge-reading all these. I enjoy the stories but feel terrible for you.  On the mention of women loving dogs more than men, I definitely LOL'd. I've got 4 large breed dogs, one of them is my #1. He knows it, I know it, and my boyfriend knows it. If you ever need to smile, I submit numerous photos of them on reddit. :)  I sincerely hope that you're doing much better now."

badpeoplestories,2xvpl8,mangababe,18,Wed Mar 4 06:03:19 2015 UTC,I am so sorry that happened to you. Teachers should have stepped in WAY sooner. So many disgusting neglectful adults involved. It must have been hard to write about this. I felt my blood boiling while reading this...
badpeoplestories,2xvpl8,star_silk,11,Wed Mar 4 07:19:58 2015 UTC,"I honestly think they either didn't believe me, or were afraid the Ringleader's mom would get them fired. Sad, but true. Most of them stood back and played stupid sadly. And yes, every parent involved sucked. Thanks for the support."
badpeoplestories,2xvpl8,star_silk,7,Wed Mar 4 16:11:20 2015 UTC,"The teachers should have intervened...They're mandated reporters and it sickens me how often they get away with negligence. If the teachers were concerned they should have kept going up the chain of command that exceeded the ring leaders mother...then again it looks like they were taking advantage of the situation you were in by not getting involved.   Keep speaking out for yourself and keep seeking ways to heal. I don't need to tell you this but I know it helps hearing it from other people, it was never your fault. You were not stupid for wanting to play with them after being invited. Being a kid is lonely and highly underestimated, especially when you've been raised to think no one will ever listen to you."
badpeoplestories,2xvpl8,ProffieThrowaway,7,Wed Mar 4 18:11:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you. :) I think a lot of the problem was the fact it was a school for gifted kids. The teachers expected maturity to come with intelligence. You know how they tell us to try and work things out first in high school before going to the authorities? Even more stupid when applied to grade-schoolers. And then you have the one voice against a large group, and I'm accusing the Ringleader? (She was an angel around teachers) I'm not surprised no one took my side.   We should have been better monitored. If the teachers had taken the effort to patrol the playground, for instance, half of the things done to me would never have happened. From the distance it probably looked like a game. It wasn't until I was assaulted, and had an  ovbious mental breakdown did anyone notice. I just... stopped caring. And when no one else cares about the kid that stuff becomes obvious. I gained 60 pounds, started wearing the same clothes everyday, didn't participate any more. The whole deal. Then it became very obvious there was something wrong.  To this day I still deal with the issues this caused. Things like remembering hygiene, weight, and keeping a clean space I still struggle with. Luckily I have an extremely understanding and helpful bf. Actually makes me feel like the mental scars might fade with time, ya know?"
badpeoplestories,2xvpl8,star_silk,7,Wed Mar 4 20:40:08 2015 UTC,I went to a technological university where everyone was gifted and geeky and it was awful. I have never been so harassed and mistreated in my life (not to mention sexually assaulted and harassed as well). It's like smart kids get together and rather than being happy that they suddenly have people like them around to be friends with they instead decide to reenact the worst of the abuse they suffered at the hands of bullies up until that point.
badpeoplestories,2xvpl8,star_silk,1 point,Thu Mar 5 05:53:17 2015 UTC,"I think it has to do with the fact your smarts set the bar, not your looks or clothes (At least that's how it was at this school) For the first time geeks had an advantage, but the threat of that power being taken away is far more frightening, thus driving people to do horrible things."
badpeoplestories,2xvpl8,wolfbob007,3,Thu Mar 5 06:27:53 2015 UTC,"It is cases I've dealt with growing up, and seen others deal with growing up in terms of bullying, that made me want to pursue teaching.  There is a hierarchy of needs that have to be met in order for students to succeed, and when you're in danger/neglected/needs not being met, you're going to flounder around helplessly. Teachers are taught that. Teachers are put through seminars and classes about that, and they have to take a specific class on law that deal with these issues, know the signs, and the consequences that follow if you don't do your job.  I somehow suspect that many states don't require that education, and it may be more of a recent thing...A lot of the court cases they tell us about are more recent :/  When I get my certificate I'll be thinking of you and many others. I wish kids could have a voice, and I wish more teachers knew that being more observant would help so fucking much. I am so sorry to hear that nothing was done before it was too late. Your story reaches me.  Having a strong support system is good to have, that's great you're growing past your pain!! You dont gotta answer this, but do you have a plan on helping yourself further heal?"
badpeoplestories,2xvpl8,wolfbob007,3,Thu Mar 5 01:16:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for responding, and 'm glad you are going into teaching! Kids need teachers like you. This stuff was almost a decade ago, before the large amount of young suicides if I'm correct, and in a small southern town as well, so I wouldn't be surprised if teachers didn't get proper training. Once I get my life back in order (Family issues left me with nothing as of last Sept.) I'm hoping to find a therapist. I'm doing better than one would think, giving my upbringing but I look at issues like this similar to a mole that randomly popped up or a wound that won't heal:  It may be nothing, but if it's not ignoring it won't do any good. Better to get it looked at and KNOW than push it to the back of your head and hope."
badpeoplestories,2xvpl8,littlemissmoxie,3,Thu Mar 5 01:22:22 2015 UTC,"You seem pretty self-aware, that's great you're looking into seeing a therapist once things smooth out.

badpeoplestories,2xvpl8,mymarkis666,2,Thu Mar 5 06:10:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks :) Yeah, a few kids got bullied to death and the school system got a little tougher on bullies. Not much though."
badpeoplestories,2xvpl8,VaneFreja,2,Thu Mar 5 06:26:08 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda seeing myself in your stories and the comments. In this case, I'm a male. But the big difference is that I'm deaf with hearing aids on and was a bit overweight, but not overly so. This was before the Internet and before cellphones became common.  Going through school up to fifth, not many issues. But 6th through 9th... Almost no friends I could rely on. Here's a few things they did:   picked for last in anything in physical education/gym one kid was just throwing stuff at my back at times, going so far as to ask the girl that was between us to move side so he could toss the object at me. He finally stopped. I nearly hurled my desk at him. pennies (or small coins/objects) were tossed at me at times   One teacher actually threatened to spank me with a paddle if he heard me get into a fight again. The real story was that I was never in a fight (I HATED fighting) and someone tried to get me to fight or or I just reacted badly to something they did to me. He refused to listen to me, and that was RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE CLASS!  They did more, but as time has gone by, I've either forgotten some things or just let it all go. If I tried holding it all in, I'd be one constantly-angry guy.  Once I had my locker broken into at the end of 8th or 9th grade, and EVERYTHING was taken. Everything I needed for finals and homework was gone. I told my teachers and they said that what my grade average was before the finals, that would be my final exam grade. When classmates heard this conversation in class, some were pretty upset. However, those responsible didn't even try to return my stuff. Did they destroy it, toss it in remote trashcans, what?  But I'm wondering about something else... Why didn't they bother with my hearing aids, tie/tape me up and toss me in a locker, that sort of thing? I even lived close to the school and several who went to the same school and were on the same bus.  But you came through this also, and are going through some help. Good for you and good knowing you're still around. Teachers and parents should be listening and watching more, but even they fail and it makes headlines somewhere when the bullied kid commits suicide or shoots up the school."
badpeoplestories,2xvpl8,VaneFreja,1 point,Sat May 2 23:27:31 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you went through what you did as well, and I hope you are healing. It honestly baffles me how teachers and parents tell kids to speak up when they are being bullied, and then don't believe the child when they do.   I would say the reason they didn't escalate the violence or target you hearing aids because it would be harder to paint you out as an equal aggressor/ instigator. And not to mention anyone who steals a kid's hearing aid is a douche, and everyone knows it."
badpeoplestories,2xvpl8,Entegy,2,Sat May 2 23:52:08 2015 UTC,"Healing I am. I have a blog where I posted everything, a ""growing up deaf"" serial of sorts. That's helped me out.

The third and the fourth I heard constantly. Ignoring them didn't do a thing. Going elsewhere or ignoring would cause them to step up attacks. Stand up for ourselves? Fight back? Damned if I did, damned if I didn't.  And there have been stories out there of others actually stealing the kid's expensive hearing aid, whether it be an analog aid, a digital, cochlear implant, or others.  As for ourselves, we're moving on with life. That's the best thing we can all do. The former bullies may find you somewhere and either ignore you or apologize for what they did."

Late grammar school grade levels and middle school kids can be horrendous monsters! The bullying along with the abuse from my stepmother meant I ended up with undiagnosed PTSD for the rest of my life which made everything worse. For me it was over 40 years ago, but regarding some of the kids that bullied me, if I had a chance and could get away with it I would still beat the living shit out of them! I know it wouldn't solve anything but it severely affected the rest of my life, and I'm sure they continued to be bullies as they got older. I know that bullies are usually bullied themselves, but I believe in correcting egregious behavior and punishing it wherever possible! If that sick little shit's mother screamed through the phone at your parent, then there's a huge clue right there as to what was going on in her house. There was denial everywhere, & I hate when that happens to kids who are being abused!  Until you can get a therapist I can recommend a good book that will help you understand everything that happened. It's called The ACOA Trauma Syndrome by Tian Dayton. It explains your shitty parents and a lot about your shitty bullies. It will verify that you did nothing wrong.   Don't let your past abuse define your present! You can choose to begin again every moment of every day, and you can learn how to reparent yourself with love. I wish you all the best in life!"

Best thing to do in situations like these is find SOMEONE you can trust in school to stick up for you. Be it student or teacher, just find someone. I got close with my senior-year HS English teacher, and I'd vent to her about the bullcrap Geology class I had.

He needs to evict her from his life asap before she poisons it more. But if he can't see that for himself at this point I don't really know what more you're supposed to do.  My advice would be to be there for your friend if he needs it but stop going out of your way to do him favors. He's made this girl his whole word (why? she's horrible) and it's going to take a wake up call to make him pull his head out of his ass.

badpeoplestories,2xpuat,robot_fruitcake,6,Mon Mar 2 22:15:21 2015 UTC,"And, finally, the thing that makes me the angriest: the time she told the world she had cancer. Like everything else in her life, she announced publicly that she got a cancer diagnosis. In the months that followed, she would complain about how women wouldn't want to be with her because she was ""sick"". Finally, she ""got treatment"" about a year after her first diagnosis (of course, she claimed it took so long because the health system was discriminatory and horrible). Magically, she's all cured! She's a ""survivor"". I later found out (from...her, again) that she had cervical dysplasia[2] . If you don't bother to follow the link, cervical dysplasia is what an abnormal pap smear is. It is caused (usually) by HPV. It is NOT a cancer, although rarely it can lead to cervical cancer. Most of the time, it stays stable or is eliminated without intervention.   No, just... no. My mother had a brain tumor (she had surgery and she's mostly okay now) and many of her friends drifted at that time. These are people she had always been willing to be there for, to help out (when our family was doing well financially) in any way possible. They're (sort of) back in her life now, going out for lunch or dinner every so often, but I've let her know that I never want to see them again. They are horrible people who didn't want to stick around for the surgery and the recovery, they were suddenly too ""busy"" to stop by to visit her in the hospital even once while she was recovering from two surgeries that could have killed her and suddenly once they got news that my mother was doing better, they had more time. I feel like she would be one of those people.   A decent human being does NOT fake cancer or a tumor. Or any illness for attention. Fuck that shit.  A part of me wants to hope that she does get cancer except I know how bad that can be (father has stage iv cancer, not going to state specifics as this isn't my story), but I hope she has karma bite her in the ass many times over.  What a terrible excuse for a human being. Fuck you, WildThing."

Sure, jumping to that conclusion and never examining it is bad -- but not as massively, extra-strength triple-ply bad as outright faking. And if she were that bad, why tell the truth now?  Don't get me wrong, in no way am I defending her. Just given the choice between having a thoughtless drama queen out there or a cancer-faking narcissist, I'm really hoping for drama queen."
badpeoplestories,2xpuat,mommy2libras,3,Tue Mar 24 08:20:28 2015 UTC,"I don't know. Doctors are pretty damn particular about how they describe these things. I had cervical dysplasia for over a decade before I heard the word cancer and it wasn't even because I had cancer, it was because it finally progressed to high grade dysplasia and he wanted to do a LEEP to remove a layer of cells. They don't play around with things like that. Sure, they'll tell you it's possible it could become cancerous. But you know whether you've been referred to an oncologist or not.

I had an ovarian cyst removed, and it turned out to be a tumour (a borderline malignant ovarian tumour). My surgeon NEVER used the word cancer, and told me that there was nothing to worry about and I would likely just need yearly monitoring.  I doubt any responsible doctor would say that this condition was a cancer or even imply it just because it causes unnecessary stress for the patient.   The other thing is that she made a big fuss over going to a ""cancer treatment centre"" when really for her condition she'd likely just be seeing a regular gynecologist.   You ARE right in that I have no clue why she would be open with her diagnosis if she realized it wasn't a cancer. It's...possible that the delusion was so strong that she honestly believed she had cancer and that she was getting cancer treatment. Or, the other more horrible possibility is that she honestly thought no one she knew would be inquisitive/intelligent enough to understand what the term meant."

badpeoplestories,2wv1g7,bondagenurse,2,Tue Feb 24 20:17:05 2015 UTC,What's a rape kit?
badpeoplestories,2wv1g7,Zombie_AU,4,Mon Mar 9 23:47:40 2015 UTC,"Great question!  So you go to a hospital and they will have a professional doctor come and take a look at you.  They will photograph any bruising (there can be a subtle difference between consensual sex and rape), as well as take swabs of DNA evidence of both you and the perpetrator.  That's the ""kit"".  https://www.rainn.org/get-information/sexual-assault-recovery/rape-kit  It can be emotionally difficult, but should not be physically painful.  If it is painful, you are now in a hospital and they may save your life.  Not every hospital will have the ""plan B"" pill available (to prevent getting pregnant), but you can usually find/take that within five days and it's still effective at preventing fertilization (plan B is not an abortion, it's basically last minute birth control).  At this point it's unlikely the perpetrator is in any kind of DNA library.  So you are still in complete control of whether you want to press charges or not.  Before pressing charges, you can then wait little bit if you want to get to a safer location away from the perpetrator.  If you press charges, they will eventually be tested as a match.  The thing is, if you shower first or wait too long for the rape kit (even just a couple days), the bruising/swelling can go down too much to be admissible and the perpetrator's DNA will have been absorbed."

Perhaps at least one of the guys still lives there.  If not, the landlord should know who was living there at the time.  Would the taxi company have a record of your friends pickup location?  What kind of car did he drive when he dropped you off?    At this point, the police probably won't do much.  But if you can figure out who did this to you, it's best to report it anyway.  He'll continue doing this to other women until he's caught.  Next time, it might be aids he gives to someone."
badpeoplestories,2wv1g7,SagebrushID,2,Mon Feb 23 16:05:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly I remember nothing about where I was, or what the guy even looked like. I spent the next 3 days incredibly sick."

This happened to a friend of mine recently and she's refusing to get tested as doing so will make it too real for her.  Not sure if you want advice or not, but r/Survivors can be a great help. The fact that this encounter has made you infertile is awful, and I hope you're in an ok place now. Bg Internet hugs from the UK :("

I guess he is angry that I am angry with him...  HERE IS A LIST OF GAMES  I angrily sent this list to him two weeks ago. He didn't even register how pissed I was. I'm passive aggressive and I think he's too dim for that. The games aren't that great, but I collected them from age 5 to 15, and he had the nerve to tell me that I didn't even care about them.

OP has never stated he is clean and not at fault for these stories,  he fully admits in the first paragraph that they will largely involve his poor choices.  So yes in a sense OP is writing his stories about how he was a bad person."
badpeoplestories,2vukxl,notabumblebee44283,1 point,Sat Feb 14 14:29:34 2015 UTC,"She had barely spoken to me that day, is what I was trying to convey.  How does anything in this story make me a misogynist? By definition a misogynist is someone who hates or doesn't trust women, or extremely thinks they don't deserve rights. Clearly I like women, and I had decided that I was going to be friends with this girl and not think about her in a sexual context because she mentioned she had a boyfriend. The boundaries were clear.  That being said, I could have made better decisions throughout this entire story, as you'll come to see, if you think I'm in the wrong, I'll get my just desserts. I prefaced this by making clear my state of depression and general mindfuck, so my moral compass may have been off at the time. Not trying to exonerate myself, just putting into perspective"
badpeoplestories,2vukxl,DefiniteMethAddict,-4,Sat Feb 14 14:25:28 2015 UTC,"The use of the term ""beta"" makes you sound like a PUA/MRA type, and most of them are rabid misogynists. Combine ""beta"" with a story about an evil slut, and... Yeah you sound like a probable misogynist. If you do not, in fact, hate women, then you might want to be more mindful of the words you're using, because they just happen to be used frequently by people who hate women."
badpeoplestories,2vukxl,notabumblebee44283,2,Sat Feb 14 15:27:22 2015 UTC,"That in itself is misuse of language. Why let stereotypes influence what language and intonation you use? Let him use ""beta"" if he wants to, and stop jumping to conclusions based upon that usage."
badpeoplestories,2vukxl,DefiniteMethAddict,2,Sat Feb 14 15:36:38 2015 UTC,"That's just silly. Like it or not, words have connotations beyond just their literal dictionary definitions. Also, I did not mean to say that I think he's a misogynist. I was explaining why it would be easy, from his post, to jump to that conclusion."
badpeoplestories,2vukxl,notabumblebee44283,3,Sat Feb 14 16:17:14 2015 UTC,"Words only have connotations because we over-react to the intention behind them. It is probably one of the largest problems that the English language has when compared to other languages (in a cultural sense). We continually battle against stereotypes and pigeonholing, yet candidly allow the same activity with our language to continue.   Then we see problems with phrases being twisted to alternate meanings - as happens in the courtroom constantly. We have a significant number of people who have difficulty conversing because we attach a wide variety of definitions to their conversation, which are otherwise unintended. There are a couple of accounts of people being sentenced to crimes they did not commit, and when interviewed later in life have attested to this definition warping.  So no, it's not silly at all. He uses ""beta"" to describe a male who is less masculine than others he has known. You attach mysogyny only because you portray the usage as also describing the author as enjoying or revelling in this fact. Perhaps that says a lot more about you than it does him."
badpeoplestories,2vukxl,DefiniteMethAddict,2,Sat Feb 14 16:36:37 2015 UTC,"Mmmmmkay. Good luck in your quest to make language exist in a cultural/societal vacuum. And again, I was not assuming OP is a misogynist, just explaining why his word choice makes him sound a little bit like one. If I threw around terms like ""lamestream media"" (random & kind of dated example, just what happens to come to mind), then people might suspect I'm a Palin fan or a Tea Partier. So if I were talking for some reason about media bias or related issues, I would not use those words, because they are frequently used by people I wouldn't want to be affiliated with."
badpeoplestories,2vukxl,notabumblebee44283,2,Sat Feb 14 16:55:26 2015 UTC,I think we will disagree for much longer than a small internet confrontation can draw out. I think you live in a different world to I.

It's also possible for a girl to be a slut without the accuser being a misogynist.  If you had read anything I said for its context rather than seeing two words and making a presupposition, you could probably come to the conclusion that I tried to be as respectful to her boundaries and relationship as possible  I never said this girl is an evil slut either. You're projecting a personality onto me based on two words that I've used, rather than the context they're used in"
badpeoplestories,2vukxl,BaddieBot,-2,Sat Feb 14 15:34:51 2015 UTC,"Calm down, dude. I never said I think you're a misogynist. I read your story, saw words that are kind of red flags for that kind of thing, but after reading the story in full decided that there was insufficient data to judge whether those flags were actually real indicators of where you stand on that front. I downvoted your story at first, because of, yes, a knee-jerk judgment based on how those words tend to be used by a certain set of people. Then I got to the end of the story, thought for a second, and decided, meh- ok, possibly not actually a sexist creep. I withdrew my downvote.   Then I looked at the comments, saw that someone else had a similar gut reaction, and that you took exception to the misogyny accusation. I thought I'd try to explain why your story might garner this sort of reaction. I'm not trying to be the PC police, just letting you know that some words may have unintended connotations. K? I'm trying to be nice, and I'm hungover and typing at a snail's pace on a shitty ancient ipad. Which is not really relevant, I just... feel like I should get brownie points, not arguments."

It doesn't forgive her being so unsupportive, but it does explain some of it.  Let her go, hope she matures and settles down eventually,  and consider seeking her out on future-facebook in a decade or so.  Not everyone can be a ""good friend"" through life changes.  Sometimes people aren't emotionally equipped to handle every situation.  I've stopped initiating with friends who won't do the same for me, after a few chances.  If they contact me now I'm friendly and cordial with no hard feelings, but I'm not going to raise my hopes when they talk vaguely about making plans to hang out again.  I just smile and nod and say ""hey just let me know when, you still have my email and phone number!"".  Then walk away with zero expectations.  I'm not burning a bridge, but I'm not holding it up anymore either."
badpeoplestories,2v9iys,UndergroundLurker,3,Mon Feb 9 16:29:47 2015 UTC,"That's exactly how I am playing this out. She did admit in the past she wondered what it would be like if we dated, but if anything happened, we would ultimately lose our 'friendship'. Believe me, I am by no means in my opinion attractive, especially compared to some of her exes.  As far as contact, that is all up to her. I recently upgraded my phone after the power button on my iPhone 4 decided to stop working. I told the worker at AT&T to just put my number onto the new phone, without adding contacts. Anyone I talked to regularly I have their number memorized, so I would put them on myself. Anyone else, such as her or anyone I used to talk to, I removed.  While, of course, if she were to initiate trying to get a hold of me, it would be on her part. I wouldn't be an asshole, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to liven up the conversation or drop everything from before.  I haven't had any social media in over a year (unless Reddit counts?), but she has my number, e-mail, address. It wouldn't be hard to bet a hold of me otherwise."

badpeoplestories,2u4u13,verminty,14,Thu Jan 29 22:56:20 2015 UTC,"This is the worst. I've had many instances of people leaving me behind or excluding me from plans. One was when I graduated middle school (age 16, not American), and my friends wanted to go to a buffet together. I wasn't happy in middle school since I was the only kid not transferred with my old elementary school class, and was instead moved to another class where everyone knew each other. Luckily my old friends did try to be with me (though they were assholes too and sometimes during recess they'd just walk away from me and figure out excuses why). I was so glad when they asked me to go with them to the buffet! A few days before I started asking questions about the plans, but was surprised to know they were cancelled. Oh well, people were busy and I decided to go to my step-brother's 30th birthday party. Since this is bad people stories, you know where this is going... Turns out the plans were very much on, they just didn't want me with them. I was so broken after that. My old friends had betrayed me and I was the only one left out and felt like shit.  Well, then I went to high school. I have to say it was so much better, since where I come from people in high schools are mature enough not to exclude people based on stupid shit, and because I went to a small school where everybody had the same interests (art school). Unfortunately, this was not the case all the time. When I was a freshman my new group of friends were talking about going to see a movie. I got into the conversation and asked what movie it was. ""Alice in Wonderland"", they said. Silence. Another friend comes. ""Hey X, wanna go see Alice in Wonderland with us?"" ""Well sure!"". I couldn't believe it. I was too shy to just invite myself, which I would have done now since I don't doubt if people like me or not. But then I definitely needed an actual, vocal invite. Why shouldn't I have? The other friend sure got invited! I was devastated, and spent the afternoon in music class with another friend who wasn't invited either (though she just didn't mind at all, she didn't care). I was so close to tears then, I couldn't believe it had happened to me again."

Now I just have enough backbone to understand that my friends actually want to spend time with me so when they say ""I'm going shopping!"" I can ask ""Cool, can I come?"" without much hesitation. It wasn't like it was a closed group and I was trying to get into it; I was already in it but they were being inconsiderate teens and didn't realize that excluding people from a group of friends is a no-no, especially if they know of the plans."

Also, depending on where you live she may be breaking many laws by not paying you on time or fixing the mice issue (which may be a health code violation).  Just start keeping track of when and what you request from here and try to get it in writing (emails or texts).

It's too easy to fake. Not sure about video but again, if you have recording running in your home, like security, it may be a way around that. Even in the US, it depends on the state. I know some states it's illegal to record others without consent (like phone calls) bur I think in some others it's perfectly ok.

The (very nice) pest control officer informed me that mice will have been under the floor and in the walls for years especially as it is a Victorian terrace bulding (http://imgur.com/k9BlqOa) and the mice will literally run from building to building through the walls and floors.. it is the HOLES which have been left unattended for a number of years by the landlord (and so gotten bigger) which have let the mice in."

This brother had spent a lot of time at my grandmother's house with us growing up; we all thought he was such a decent guy.  He had a pretty secret double life.    I hate people who do this to their family.  It's never so much about the money as it is the betrayal and theft."

It could be fear, it could be greed, it could be utter stupidity.  Likely it's a combination of many things.  You'll have to decide whether or not he's worth keeping in your life.  The fact that he lied means what he knows what he did was wrong, or at least that you would disapprove.  That may mean he can come around."

I would imagine that he justified it to himself as deserving it because he looked after her, and by thinking that he needed it more than she did.

Not someone close to him, just a guy that lives in the house. 2. The house is fortified. You arent just kicking the door in or picking the locks. It was made to be this way by the original owner, a thief that was scared someone may try to rob is stolen goods. 3. Home invasion is a felony. Not one Im willing to risk getting arrested for. I have kids.  4. I dont think in a million years hed keep that money in the house if he was away. 5. Im not sure he actually is on vacation.  My personal hope is the detctive can somehow get a search warrant, and that hes not on vacation. To me thats the only way we may recover anything.

It doesn't matter what should and should not be, it matters what is.  In this situation they are the antagonizing factor and if you don't excise them from your life they will metastasize and spread like the cancer they are until they take everything good from you and your spouse.  If he can't accept that because he's clinging to a feeling about them that's no longer grounded in reality then he is condemning you to the same Hell he refuses to extricate himself from.  Does any of that sound like the actions of a loving spouse in a healthy relationship?  Just as you would have to take the bottle away were your husband an alcoholic you have to take this destructive influence away because your beloved is not thinking clearly enough to put it down himself.

I may have missed the first two parts but I'm pretty sure drinking hand sanitizer is just fucking not good.   I'm also pretty sure that a landlord who doesn't do reference checks and a background check is sketchy in their own right.
badpeoplestories,2skntz,rtaisoaa,1 point,Fri Jan 16 03:45:03 2015 UTC,I'm not sure whether we helped her dependency or not. If we had done nothing about it we would have been stuck with her in our house for way longer than we did.  Everyone I tell this story to blames the landlord and I honestly don't. I've been a landlord and it's really hard to check people short of doing a police check which is pricey and time consuming. If a kid is moving right out of their parents house they won't have previous landlords and they could lie and tell you that's the case even if it isn't. And parents lie all the time for their kids. Here the mom was with her when K met her to show her the room and all seemed normal (obviously the mom wanted her gone and thus lied through her teeth to make her daughter seem like a good tenant). I had a tenant whose parents swore up and down he was a good kid with a steady job...month later stopped paying rent. It is really hard to check into a tenant and unfortunately once they get into your property they have more rights to stay then you do to get rid of them. So I don't blame our landlord a bit but I understand how others might.

badpeoplestories,2skntz,BaddieBot,2,Fri Jan 16 02:43:45 2015 UTC,"part of it is because genuinely we wanted to help this girl who so obviously has fallen off the track. But another part was that she didn't have a computer or a phone so if we'd left it up to her she wouldn't have done anything and we would have had to live with her even longer, until she would be formally evicted which could take another week or 2. To us it was worth the effort if it meant getting her out weeks earlier, plus we could go home at the end of the day and say well we gave it our best shot...if that makes sense"

From experience,  the people who don't like you because of their own intolerance aren't people you want to be around anyway (barring family but you can't force people to change.

He knows I will fuck this kid up and he knows hes the vindictive, manipulitive sociopath type that would press charges and try to get me jail time. You think Im havent gone ballistic? I actually gave him the benefit of the doubt when my dad first accused him. But once he refused to take the polygraph I knew. Now hes locked up in his house. Living 20 minutes away in another state. Trying to get a restraining order against me. Dont get me wrong, I still wanna beat the fucking kid senseless if I see him, but hes not gonna go anywhere where I will find him. I also have to keep my head on straight because if I just start beating his face in and he bleeds on me I risk getting HIV. I have two young kids. I dont want them growing up without me because this low life piece of shit made me lose control."

badpeoplestories,2pcysj,MedicStoner,26,Mon Dec 15 14:12:24 2014 UTC,"I'll just format this right quick:  sorry for spelling and punctuation I'm on my phone. The big players:  me: medicstoner, 25 year old ex infantry suffering from PTSD and cyclic vomiting syndrome (I can't work because of those 2 conditions).  My wife alex(works non stop to support me, literal saint).  Jimmy (50 year old crackhead alcoholic, drinks a 2 liter of vodka a day)   And Michelle (our landlord and still crackhead).   So me and my wife just finished college and were in south Florida. We didn't want to move back to middle of nowhere Texas so we decided to get a place around our college. After looking everywhere and being turned down(fresh out of school college kids) we finally find a great place renting a room from a nice older couple (or so we thought). They are the nicest people we have met in sflo so we are excited, we would have a yard and everything even if we had to share.   Well 2 days after we move in Michelle starts asking me to do everything under the sun, pressure washing, cleaning out a house of her friends that passed away, going to take care of her horses. I'm fine with that I love to help if I'm not sick. Well apparently with the money we were paying for rent she was buying lots of coke, and she gave me all these things to do so she could party at the house alone with her husband (didn't find this out till much later).   Well after about 2 weeks of this I hit my cycle of vomiting where I throw up for a week straight. She is slowly gets more agitated over the week I'm sick (no time to do coke) so one night while my wife is taking care of me we hear jimmy bitching to Michelle horribly trying to get her to do coke. Me and my wife figured out that they had done it in the past but we're sure that they had put it down(nice home, nice things working on a budget) Michelle is turning it down flat out. My wife goes out to congratulate her for saying no and to ask jimmy to calm down(mind you over the last week jimmy has cursed more then I've heard in my life). Jimmy starts going off on my wife telling her she's worthless and a lot worse I can't type. She is just as heated towards him calling him a worthless drunk etc.   I see that things are getting too heated so I step in between them and start breaking it up. I am about to push my wife outside when I hear jimmy say ""I'm going to beat your ass right after I go through your little boyfriend. I have my back turned, to him when's PTSD comes back in full swing(do or die time). As I turn around to swing as hard as I can and punch him in the face knocking him out for 2-3 seconds, at this point I go white, I just beat him when I finally come out of it he is on the ground both eyes swollen shut and his bottom two teeth sticking out from under is now hanging lip.   I promptly say I'm sorry you can't do that stuff around me when all of a sudden....he hugs me. Says he's sorry and that it's his fault(I'm confused as shit) I accept the apology to just drop it. Everyone agrees its Jimmy's fault and I just did what needed to be done. And me and my wife decide to just go to bed (we learn later he did this so we wouldn't expect repercussions from him)   That's enough for part 1 if you'd like to know how things get really bad let me know and I'll do part 2 where they try to organize my wife's rape"

He has bouts of it much like you describe. One thing the I'm guessing at based on your user name is the ""MedicStoner"" is that you are a pot user, apparently there is a syndrome NOT CVS that presents just the same as CVS that is caused by copious amounts of pot smoked, in the case of my friend, he does not smoke pot at all, they identified his problem after a year that it was caused by Gall Stones. In either case the Hot Baths cause the vomiting to subside, has something to do with the brain I am told."

In the spring and summer, I can ride my bike in about 15 minutes or so but I've already put my bike up for the winter. Also riding a bike in winter sounds like a horrible idea."
badpeoplestories,2p1p7i,DiscoJaguar,15,Sat Dec 13 00:23:23 2014 UTC,"You know, I am going to be down voted here but why is it your Aunt's responsibility to get your ass to work?  Your an adult, you have numerous options to get into work such as   Ride in with your dad two hours early Walk or bike Get help for your issues so you can drive yourself.  Worst case drop your dad off then come back 2 hours later.   All the signs you mention indicate you think you are a special snowflake.  It would be one thing if this was arranged ahead of time with your aunt, but it was dumped on her third hand.  She is under no obligation to haul you to work, you need to grow up and not rely on the kindness of others."
badpeoplestories,2p1p7i,Master-Potato,5,Mon Dec 15 19:52:11 2014 UTC,"I think you're the voice of reason in this thread. If I couldn't drive I've walked or biked since I was old enough to work.  Now as a manager I expect the same out of my people. You're letting down your team by not being punctual, and ""I didn't want to walk"" doesn't hold water with me."
badpeoplestories,2p1p7i,Master-Potato,3,Tue Dec 16 04:13:15 2014 UTC,"It's less ""I didn't want to"" and more ""I had major abdominal surgery less than 60 days ago and if I slipped on the icy sidewalks on my way to work, I could risk doing a lot of damage."" I was already out for two whole months because of medical-related issues and I had just gotten off of light duty maybe two weeks prior to this morning.   I will be honest, I'm not exactly super coordinated as it is. Me falling and hurting myself is very, very likely as it tends to happen a lot. I was already going to be late by the time Aunt Nah said she had changed her mind. Arriving late, cold, and more than likely injured again (therefore unable to perform the physical labor my job requires especially during our busiest time of year) seems like it would let my team down even further."
badpeoplestories,2p1p7i,Master-Potato,5,Wed Dec 17 01:03:17 2014 UTC,True that.  I have ridden a bike for 45 minutes at 3:00 in the morning to make it for my shift literally shovel cow shit because I was a dumb ass and hydro locked my truck.  It's not anyone else's fault but mine.
badpeoplestories,2p1p7i,sunshineyhaze,0,Tue Dec 16 04:46:43 2014 UTC,"I have been working on the driving issue, but it has been difficult to find a doctor. I live in a very, very small town so the closest doctor who might be able to help me and is also covered by my insurance enough that I might be able to afford one session a month lives over an hour away. Scheduling and appointment has been extra difficult because I would still need a ride to get there (no public transportation, wheeeee).  Most of the problem with this situation is because I had set up other alternatives but they were unavailable under the circumstances. And my bike has been put away for the winter, meaning it is not available as an option. And even if I walked, the conditions outside were icy, cold, and more conductive to me falling somewhere and breaking something with no one knowing where I was. And I still would have been late.  My Aunt has offered in the past that if I had no other options, I or one of my family members could call and she'd help me out. This is, in fact, an offer she'd made in the past and had never at any point rescinded it. I found out that my original ride could not make it an hour before my shift began. My Aunt cancelled on me at 8:35. If she had not wanted to or been unable to help me, she could have told me at any earlier point between 8:00 (when my original ride cancelled and informed me that Aunt Nah would be helping me instead) and 8:35. If she had informed me even 15 minutes earlier of her unwillingness, I would have still been late, but much less so.  The anger I feel is from 1) Having all of my other backups unable; 2) having taken Aunt Nah on her standing offer for a ride IN THIS EXACT SITUATION THAT SHE DEFINED only for her to bail; and 3) Her taking so long to do so or not saying no right off the bat so that my mom could have helped me out a lot earlier.  If I had known that getting a ride in the morning would be an issue, I would definitely have gotten a ride with my dad or with one of my coworkers who had also gone in early. I do my absolute best to have rides lined up far ahead of time so that when the time comes, I'm all set.   Aunt Nah was my last viable option. This was the exact situation she had told me was completely appropriate for asking for her assistance. I am doing my best to get healthy and not be so reliant on others. But I also think a part of growing up is that when you offer to help someone, you follow through when they take you up on it instead of waiting until the last second to say ""Actually, nevermind."" Leaving them stranded."
badpeoplestories,2p1p7i,sunshineyhaze,5,Mon Dec 15 23:05:33 2014 UTC,"You did not ask her, you had your mom ask your grandma, who then asked her. Why are you depending on your mom to find you rides to work?  Your job as a employee and a adult is to ensure you have your own means of transportation.  Now if you had asked you aunt the night before, and she agreed then that's one thing.  But to expect her to stop what she is doing to drive you is a bit much.  Doesn't matter if she is catching up on a judge Judy marathon, her time is important as well and should be respected.  Remember, a emergency on your part does not not constitute a emergency on her part."
badpeoplestories,2p1p7i,BaddieBot,2,Tue Dec 16 04:55:37 2014 UTC,"Look, I get it. Believe me, this is a very isolated incident. But according to my grandmother, Aunt Nah had agreed. My mom found out that she would be unable to help me so she arranged for an alternative ride BEFORE informing me that she was stuck at work. I did not even know my mom would be unable to get me until after the plans had been arranged. If she had told me at 8 am ""Hey, I can't make it, can you call your grandmother/AUnt/coworkers?"" I would have done so.  So again, Aunt Nah agreed to give me a ride BEFORE I knew that my mother would be unable to get me.   But up until 8:30 am or so, as far as anyone had informed me, my Aunt Nah would be picking me up at 8:45-8:50 to get me to work on time. If Aunt Nah had called me even at 8:20, maybe some of my coworkers might have still been home or close by enough to give me a ride.  I feel like you have this idea that I'm completely irresponsible and never set up arrangements for myself. Which, I can understand given the fuckup that was the morning described here. But. This was a rare, isolated incident.  This was maybe the third time in the 5 years I've worked at that company in which I had been without a ride and informed at the last minute. THe rest of the time, I do arrange my own transportation. Hell,  I've been going in early for the last few days and I had rides arranged ahead of time.   I needed her this one, single time, to help me because I had no other options. I made this a bad person story mostly because if she'd said no from the start or even 10 minutes earlier than when she did, I might have been able to find someone else. WHen my mother was unable to help me, she arranged something else before telling me. Because that's how I've always been taught that favors work. When someone is depending on you for something and you are unable to help them, it is important that you let them know at the earliest possible moment so that other arrangements can be organized. My aunt waited until about 15 minutes before she was supposed to show up to tell me she had changed her mind.   Like, I get hindsight is 20/20 but I ask you, sir/madam/esteemed commenter, how was I supposed to ask Aunt Nah to give me a ride when I didn't know that I needed one until after she had already agreed? How was I supposed to predict that 2 people would die on my mother's floor at the hospital and so she'd be stuck there doing charting? I need you to understand that if I had been aware of any of this, Aunt Nah would never have been asked because I could have asked a coworker the night before. Or ridden in with my dad 2 hours early and just spent that time napping in the lounge at work."
badpeoplestories,2p1p7i,Skwishi,4,Wed Dec 17 00:55:50 2014 UTC,"You know ahead of time your mom works late due to issues beyond her control.  However I suspect you could of found that out before your dad left.  At the very least you could of called your aunt directly after you found out from your mom.  Third hand request usually get muddled.  However, as you say this is a isolated incident.  You are classifying your aunt as a bad person based on one incident, one that was given to her third hand at that.  In my mind, one type of bad person is one who relies on the kindness of others when they have means at their disposal.  Here is a little story to cement the point.  About a month ago, my truck's engine decided to go out.  I did not have enough in my reserve to put a new motor in the truck.  So instead of going in to debt, or begging rides, I brought a 200 dollar car.  Now I would not recommend 200 dollar cars to anyone, but I knew the history of this one and figure it will get me by for a couple months until I can save up the cost of a motor.    My point is when it comes to most things in life, do not ask anyone to inconvenience themselves without anything in return.  Many folks will offer anyway, but I don't think less of those who don't."

badpeoplestories,2ousdf,headoftheasylum,2,Fri Dec 12 19:31:00 2014 UTC,"Just an FYI, methadone is not a heroin substitute. It is often used to help wean people off of heroin and like any other narcotic can be abused itself. But methadone is also used to treat long term, debilitating chronic pain. Because of it's long lasting effects many people who start taking methadone can decrease or stop taking other short acting narcotics like oxycontin and vicodan. That being said, you would never put it in a spoon and inject it into your neck! So if this asshole did have a legitimate prescription for methadone he was definitely abusing the drug."

Let him be the weirdo who's quietly stewing and ignoring his friend for imagined slights. Eventually he'll realize pouting isn't going to work or your friends will realize he's being as asshole."
badpeoplestories,2omtkf,BEWILDERED_WIZARD,7,Mon Dec 8 16:39:22 2014 UTC,Agreed.  I'd even kill him with kindness now and again.

So first is I'm cooking beer but chicken next weekend (try it, soooo good) so I'll invite people by face. if he doesn't talk to me, well it's up to him isn't it. I'll be asking for a little contribution because I'm not a charity.   Next plan of attack, I'm into drawing so I'm having some fun offering to make silly pictures for others. They give me 2 animals, i combine them, think of the dird as an example. Drawing, not PS.   I'll continue saying good morning and hello, to the point that if he doesn't reply I'll bug him until he acknowledges me or actually tells me he's ignoring me (ball will then be in my court).   Any more ideas?   edit: fixed links"

That's not a bad thing, just how some are.   If you want to go phych (in a graduate) he's stuck in his protective bubble still. The last 3 years he has been able to do what he wants and his parents probably put up with it. Now I came and challenged him in some way, his reaction is to try and push me out of his life. Probably worked on others, but they don't have to live with him."

They got so offended and cursed me out but they just left. Im sure they snuck in, but I really hope they spent the 18 bucks on an imax ticket and wasted it.   Glad you got those tickets.

This:   People like this will take every scrap of help and friendliness from you, then ask for more and make you feel guilty if you say no. He will lie, telling you that you're remembering things wrong, and tell everyone around you all sorts of bullshit. This includes saying that you're talking shit about them, to try and get them on his side.   I get this all the time, any bit of niceness is taken and run with and if I turn to say no it turns in to a mud slinging match of everything he has done for me (which I am yet to see)   I have also noticed the way his family treats him, tiptoeing around him.

Just don't drain yourselves being there for him.   Also for further reference the one that goes to jail is usually the one who did the beating. As in CrayCray would go to jail because James was beat up. He's the one with the marks so she'd be going to jail.

It started out with a few cuts and scrapes and progressed to her actually hitting him in front of their friends. His male friends started off thinking it was funny and then just plain didn't know what to do when she hit him in front of them since we grew up in the deep south where no matter what a woman does they are taught never to put your hand on them. She was really surprised when I tackled her and threatened to kick her ass when she hit him in front of me after that she was some how able to curb her homicidal rage when me or one of the other girls in the group were around. Which proves that they have every ability to control it if they fear there will be consequences.   You're absolutely right though. We tried everything to get him out of that situation but until he decided to leave there was really nothing we could do. Just keep letting him know that if he ever wants to leave there's a place for him."

I won't hit her because if I start I won't stop, and she's not worth legal issues. But if she hits me I'll press charges so fast her head will spin, and maybe that would be a fucking wake-up call.

The fact that your boss caved to this woman and punished you actually gives her a better position if she does want to take this to a civil or criminal court (""if I was wrong why did they punish the bouncer"", might not win her the case but much stronger footing than she had). If they cave further and let her back in the place, there's a chance she's going to be a bitch and try to cause trouble with you again. If your boss doesn't have your back in a case this one-sided, he doesn't value you as an employee and will never have your back if another big issue happens. Don't quit, I'm sure you'll need the money after not working for two weeks, but start browsing the wanted adds and asking about openings at other venues.    Watched a similar situation happen over the summer, customer tried to return one or two hundred dollars worth of cosmetics (some of which we didn't sell I believe) without a receipt and flipped when we wouldn't let them. Came back with their husband and cornered my manager and assistant manager to scream at and threaten them for five or ten minutes (I watched the video, I'm the calmest person I know and it probably would have ended with the police called if I was in that situation). Everything was on camera and policy was properly followed. My manager just wanted them banned from the store. Corporate gave them a $50 gift card. Of course, next week they come in to gloat and end up doing more screaming/threatening. Bad enough my manager's husband confront the guy and tells him to stay away from his wife. Ends with asshole customers banned from the store anyway and manager being dragged through court for a couple months over assault charges (on both sides, customer's husband shoved manager's husband and they made up some bs about manager's husband punching customer's husband or threatening their kid or something). Guarantee if district manager or whatever higher ups who had decided to cave and reward bad behavior with a gift card instead supported their employees by banning the customers or even just ignoring their complaints, it would have ended the situation immediately.  Edit: Also, start looking soon. If she does try to take you to court or a similar situation happens and your boss decides it's easier to fire you than hang up on a crazy person it might affect your ability to get another bouncer job. Don't think anyone's going to want to hire a bouncer going to court for assault charges or being sued after injuring a customer if word gets around. They won't get your side of the story, they'll just see you in front of a judge because of something you did on the job."

You are supposed to stop them playing in the street at night while camoflaged."
badpeoplestories,2lzlok,Fifth5Horseman,2,Wed Nov 12 00:42:02 2014 UTC,"So I'll address this in a couple of ways. This is directed at the melange of opinions expressed in response to my posting.  First, the personal attitude question. Look, I get it. I drive a motorcycle in Los Angeles. If I assumed that every driver who made a mistake and put themselves or me at risk was a person of bad character, I'd be a raving paranoid, convinced that 10% of the population of Los Angeles were casual murderers targeting me personally. I get through the day by recognizing that they probably didn't see me, and remind myself to keep a lane position that maximizes my visibility, and I let it go.  If one can't let it go, if one feels compelled to rush home, fuming, and write a screed on the Internet about some under-10 child on a web board dedicated to the bad behavior of narcissistic adults, substance addicts and hoarders, then perhaps one should seriously consider where one's priorities are. If somebody thinks this is a normal response to swerving a bicycle around a child who entered a residential street flanked by homes, I encourage them to consider finding a home in the Australian outback, a mine in Greenland or an oasis in the Gobi desert where they needn't be bothered by those bad children and their terrible decisions.  Second, perhaps you can consider this common fallacy: when we make mistakes, we know the full circumstances of our decision-making, and we typically understand that our mistakes are a combination of circumstances, bad information, and (rarely) a deliberate short-cut that results in error.  When others make mistakes, we often attribute it to a fault of character. They made a bad decision, they took a short cut, they took it in a knowing and informed fashion, and therefore they are bad people. People who belong on /r/badpeoplestories .  This is a fallacy, and one that is well-studied. I would ask you to take yourself out of the situation for a moment and ask: do you know all of the circumstances that prompted that person to make a decision to enter the roadway, or to be outside in dark clothing? Were they chasing a ball or a toy in the road? Were they looking for a pet, or a sibling? Did they have a companion on the other side of the road they were trying to join? Were they frightened, or lost? Was it darker than they expected because of the recent switch to standard time and they were desperate to get home?  If the OP doesn't know the answers to these questions, will you concede that it's at least possible that the OP was unaware of  circumstances that contributed to their mistake, and that perhaps he and you shouldn't assume the worst?  I'll cover one final matter. Children are not automatons, and they are not chattel. While it is appropriate and reasonable to to ask whether the parents had coached and disciplined their child in appropriate safety when entering the street, that is literally the most they can do. Unless one builds a home like a prison, with barbed wire at the property line, children will sometimes explore on their own, and sometimes enter a residential street, even when they've been properly educated. That's simply a fact of the world in which we live.  EDIT: Fixed some pronoun inconsistencies."

I get it, I wasn't born yesterday.  OP's post was about the parents or guardians of that child who allowed the situation to occur, not the child.

badpeoplestories,2lzlok,Fifth5Horseman,1 point,Wed Nov 12 07:07:46 2014 UTC,"It's a teachable moment. I meet people all the time who agonize over the actions of others, certain that those actions are chosen for personal advantage at their expense, or to harm them, etc.   I mean, look at what you said:    And if you are the parent, you are responsible for them. You are responsible for that child's 'independent actions' and 'not great decisions.' You are supposed to stop them playing in the street at night while camoflaged... OP's post was about the parents or guardians of that child who allowed the situation to occur   Do you know what the parents' intentions were? Do you know that they were irresponsible in this matter? Do you know that they are bad people? Like I said, children aren't automatons, and to hold a parent wholly responsible for the independent actions of a child is a contradiction in terms.   If your response is that they must be irresponsible because their child got into the street, then you are indeed ""judging others by their actions""."

It does not explain interpretations of one's own behavior, where situational factors are more easily recognized and can thus be taken into consideration. The flip side of this error is the actor–observer bias, in which people tend to overemphasize the role of a situation in their behaviors and underemphasize the role of their own personalities.

But a 7year old is a child and the parents are very much responsible for what he/she does. Ant they are also suppose to care about their kid.  I don't hate kids. I just don't like parents who don't do their best to prepare them for life.
badpeoplestories,2lzlok,Fifth5Horseman,2,Wed Nov 12 14:57:23 2014 UTC,This commenter does not seem to believe a parent needs to supervise their child. Very strange attitude.
badpeoplestories,2lzlok,RickRussellTX,1 point,Wed Nov 12 23:54:19 2014 UTC,What I wrote is clear. And that's not what I wrote.
badpeoplestories,2lzlok,RickRussellTX,1 point,Thu Nov 13 07:29:04 2014 UTC,"And from this incident, you are certain that these parents don't ""care about their kid""?"

badpeoplestories,2lzlok,LG193,4,Thu Nov 13 16:36:47 2014 UTC,"If op was driving a car that inconvenience would have been dialing 911 and having to deal with having hit a child with his car. Like he said that the kid was lucky he wasn't driving a car which makes me believe either he was able to break in time or was able to quickly swerve around the kid.   Yes the kid is able to act independently from his parents but it's his parents responsibility to teach him basic road safety and by the sounds of it they failed in that regard. Too bad op didn't knock on the door and let the parents know he almost hit their kid darting into the road and if they punished the kid we would know this story doesn't belong here, but if they yell at op for telling them how to raise their kid then it does belong here. Sadly we'll never know."
badpeoplestories,2lzlok,BaddieBot,3,Wed Nov 12 03:02:42 2014 UTC,Thank you for getting the point of the story.
badpeoplestories,2lzlok,thelordofcheese,0,Wed Nov 12 15:04:05 2014 UTC,"Yes, what the kid was doing wasn't smart, but you don't know the context and shouldn't be jumping to conclusions like that immediately. Any way, I am glad the kid is alright."
badpeoplestories,2lzlok,RickRussellTX,4,Tue Nov 11 22:13:34 2014 UTC,I'm pretty sure he just didn't watch were he was going.  I would never cross a street without looking for cars or other vehicles first.
badpeoplestories,2lsupi,Diablo3RuinedMe,19,Sun Nov 9 22:29:19 2014 UTC,"Now with paragraphs! :D  This is my first post, and I intend it to be the first of a series, because I grew up surrounded by bad people.  I now present for your viewing pleasure: Episode One, or My Dad Is Half Retarded.  Our major players:   Me, Diablo3RuinedMe, various ages throughout the story. Dark brown hair, blue/green/gray-on-a-bad-day eyes, really pale because I burn too hard to be in the sun. I'm also overweight, but not a hamplanet and I don't use fat logic. Severely bipolar. OddMom, my mother and sometimes my best friend, sometimes the bane of my existance. DamagedSis, my younger sister who has her own host of problems. We were good friends for a time but then our father fucked it up. DumbFuckDad, my father and part of the reason DamagedSis is so damaged. CarrotWhore, DFDs new wife with whom he starts a family and part of the reason DS is all screwed up.    Before we begin, I want to say a few things. The first is that by all acounts, Daddy was a decent father before Nanny died. Family lore says he crashed his car and was in agony for a week and then Nanny died and he just lost his mind. I suppose I remember some things from before he stopped being a dad. But unfortunately I also remember some shitty things from before he was nuts too.  ON WITH THE SHOW!    ***WARNING! THERE IS NO JUSTICE HERE! ONLY PAIN AND SADNESS!***   The first time I actually realized my dad was a bad person is when I was around 4 or 5. DamagedSis was still tiny so I couldnt have been more than 5, she was born when I was 3. Anyway, something was being done with the yard and there were lots of people over. We were clustered on the porch, and DumbFuckDad was smoking a cigarette. I went to give him a hug and got burned. It hurt but I was okay, until I started peeling the skin to check for ashes  in case of infection (I was a mildly smart child, my IQ was 115). DumbFuckDad started yelling at me in front of everyone and when I tried to explain, he kept yelling until I broke down and went inside. I slept the rest of the day.  Fast forward to me at six years old. DFDs been cheating on OddMom for a while now with a variety of online whores (this will be important later). He is seated at the computer and tells me to bring him a cup of tea. I go and get it but I'm feeling a little sick and I almost make it back...but then I threw up. I'm standing there covered in puke and tea, soaked and feeling icky. DFD yells at me because his tea is ruined. OddMom glares at him and cleans me up.  Fast forward to a bit later in the year. We have a rickety staircase and the banister on it is falling apart. I was going up the stairs and a wood splinter half the thickness of a pencil stabs into my hand between my thumb and forefinger, becoming intangled in the nerves. I tell OddMom and she has DFD take a look. He tries to rip it out. I scream and cry and kick up a fuss and finally he frustrated yells at mom to just ''Take her to a fucking hospital then and let THEM deal with it!'' When we get there I have to have surgery and to this day my thumb still doesn't move quite right in cold weather.  Still be me, still be six. DFD has decided to leave us for one of his internet whores (she will have her own post, shes legitimately a bad person too). DFD leaves leaves DamagedSis a cowboy hat and snakeskin boots. I get a box of bullets from WWII. I wait by the door for him to come home the next day because although I'm smart enough to understand divorce, I honestly thought he was just divorcing OddMom, not me and DS.   Its my 7th birthday and DFD didnt show. Id say he called but I don't remember.  Its a few months after and DFD wants me and DS to meet CarrotWhore. He makes us wear heavy makeup and perfume and dresses to meet her at McDonalds. We weren't given a choice on what to eat: 6 peice nugs and a water. I wiped off all the makeup halfway through and CarrotWhore decided she didn't like me.  Im 8 i think and they get married and settle down in Florida for a while. DFD brings us down there and makes me sit outside in the sun for 2 hours each day. I burn But not too badly, not yet. Then Carrot Whore decides we have to go to an air show. I beg for sunblock for my ears the whole time but I don't get any because it will ''reflect badly'' on her if I get any in my hair and make my hair greasy. I ask dad and he ignores me. My ears burn so badly they turn into massive blisters. I have to get a special cream from the doctor. Its really expensive. OddMom is broke but she ends up with the bill anyway.  I'm 10 and I'm on several medications for my Bipolar disorder. DFD and CW work at a boys home. I start to become friendly with one of the boys. DFD and CW make him go live in the other cabin. I make friends with another one. This one they leave alone.  I'm still 10 and CW has decided that I don't need my meds, and that its OddMoms fault that I have issues because she doesn't discipline me enough or something. DFD agrees with her because if its OddMoms fault he doesn't have to face that I inherited it from Nanny. CW starts withholding my meds a lot. She also punishes me for wetting the bed, as if its my fault.  I'm still 10. I've called OddMom and said i want to go home. My therapist told her i was just being rebellious so she makes me stay. DFD overhears our conversation. He doesn't yell but he still makes me cry. later CW has run away (I'll tell why in episode 2). DFD blames me. He makes me try and talk to her when she finally comes back. She yells at me fro my nervous tic (my eyes roll up and to the left while my head jerks down and to the right). She says no one will ever want to talk to me if I can't stop doing that.  Its my 11th BDay. DamagedSis and I usually celebrated on the same day since it wasn't a big gap between our birthdays. DFD thinks its funny to scare us so bad we started crying, then got mad when DamagedSis (who was 9) couldn't stop even after it was revealed to be a surprise birthday party.  I'm still 11. Tensions are high between me and DamagedSis. DFD and CW have decided that shes their love child from a past life. She gets treated better than I do suddenly. Of course they still make her write lines, things like ''I will not ask for my mother, CW is my mother while I'm here, I will be obedient'', things like that, but overall she gets nicer stuff and catches less flak for mistakes.  I'm 12 and DFD and CW fuck up something somehow. They pack up and leave the state immediately. On the way to BFE they run out of gas. They sell off my stuff on the side of the road. All my Harry Potter figurines, my books and my broomstick, my barbies and kens and their dreamcar gone.   I'm still 12 and dad takes DamagedSis to BFE ''for the summer''. Shes gone until march. She comes back wrong. DFD wouldnt take me. He said there wasn't enough room in the car. The backseat was full of empty boxes. He just didnt want me to be there.  I'm 13 and dad only calls to ask for DamagedSis. If shes not there he doesn't talk to me.  I'm 14 and I don't wanna talk to him any fucking way.  I'm 15 and he's visiting me for the first time in two years. He brings his new family. His son throws things at me. His daughter gets treated like a goddess. DamagedSis and I each get a shirt from Goodwill and then we are trucked to Taco Bell after being promised our favorite restaurant.  I'm 16 and DFD sends me  a birthday card every year with 10 dollars in it. This year I just get the 10. No card.  I'm 17 and dad visits for the last time. His son is a lot like me, smart and angry. They treat him like they did me and treat his sister like a goddess still. One day he will blow up and take them down in a ball of flames.  I'm 18 and its my birthday and dad doesn't send me a card. Turns out he was having CarrotWhore send them. DamagedSis doesn't get a card either.  I'm 19 and I get a vague post on my wall on my BDay. No card.  A few months ago I turned 20. No card. No wall post.  DFD forgot my birthday for 4 days and finally said he ''was out of town, youre getting old, lol''.  He skipped a bunch of child support and won't catch it up because DamagedSis is almost 18.  The worst part for me is that I'll spend my 21st birthday on FB or peering into the mailbox to see if he sent me something this year."

badpeoplestories,2lsupi,RickRussellTX,5,Sun Nov 9 23:33:26 2014 UTC,Well DS was kinda fun and goofy. We had like you know regualar sibling stuff going on. Then she came back and she was angry and she started fights for the hell of it and used like knives and rocks and shit. Once ahe hit me with a glass coffee pot.
badpeoplestories,2lsupi,MechBear,13,Mon Nov 10 00:38:03 2014 UTC,"Well, let's see.  (1) Dad and his old GF abscond with your younger sister and disappear for months.  (2) Your sister is greatly affected by the experience.  (3) Whatever happened, it drove a wedge between Dad and the old GF.  (4) Dad keeps calling to talk to the younger sister.  (5) He meets a new GF and treats her daughter like a princess.  I think you need to ask your sister what happened on that trip. She may need help dealing with it."

Nothing that's happened in what I've described had actually taken place in school, and in my opinion is pretty much on-par with the other things I've read. It's based off of her as a person. I'm going to keep posting about her because she is a bad person. Sorry if you disagree, but she is, and imo, it surpasses 'high school drama'.   She has done real harm, and has attempted to get others to harm me, and succeeded, so i apologise if that doesn't seem like a thing a bad person would do."

Everyone is so hopped up on hormones and changing it causes pretty much anything that occurs during high school to be dramatic. Everyone  has their own levels of drama during their pre-teen - teen years, much of which can be described as bad, just at various levels.   I hope I'm making sense  >.<"

If I may I would like to point out that tools such as PhotoRec do come with some responsibility as I found out the hard way. If you delete a large amount of images, take a few more and delete them as well, the tool will recover all of the newer files and possibly some of the older files.  I found this out when I was tech support for a large construction firm. I had a director of the company looking over my shoulder as well as the user that had deleted some survey images. A mistake which was going to cost a lot of money as we had to prove we had installed something that was subsequently stolen from site.  I recovered the lost pictures as well as some more erm, private images taken at the users home. Not quite the happy ending they were both expecting!  In my view recovery tools are best used alone to avoid raising false hopes if the tool can't recover anything and to keep private things private."
badpeoplestories,2l8cal,Dont_smile_nicole,2,Wed Nov 5 11:16:24 2014 UTC,"I will be sure to use the power of SD recovery tools only for good. Thanks again, and enjoy the lounge!"
badpeoplestories,2l8cal,BaddieBot,1 point,Wed Nov 5 11:45:34 2014 UTC,Well. At the very minimum I'll see what images may be on the card. I'm not sure if she used it or anything after she took it. She said that it may have been used but she's a constant liar so I'm not sure.
badpeoplestories,2l85ek,householdsponge,14,Tue Nov 4 03:17:02 2014 UTC,"The only reason I am staying around is because I am in the process of buying a house so it would be pointless to move for a month then move in to the bought house.   I don't know what changed his behaviour, we got on really friendly terms but only as friends. He has a kind of girlfriend in the uk where as we live in nz.    He kept making what I thought was jokes about us hooking up but again thought it was joking.  It felt like I became his mother or girlfriend which I wasn't. And when I pushed back and said I am not doing this for you he got crazy  I don't think he is violent (but then I didn't think he would act like this)   He is trying to tell my friends I am depressed and that they need to stage an intervention. I am not depressed. And my friends know this too and are concerned that he is acting like this."
badpeoplestories,2l85ek,quintrelle,14,Tue Nov 4 08:00:02 2014 UTC,"Whatever you do, do not let him know your new address, he sounds creepy."
badpeoplestories,2l85ek,foodandart,5,Tue Nov 4 11:40:56 2014 UTC,"Thing is he has integrated himself in to my group of friends, so I wouldn't be surprised if he does find out. But I am hoping I will be living in a townhouse complex that you need permission to enter in to the area, so hopefully that will keep him a bit more at bay.  I have a feeling he will think he will be moving with me, so I am not telling him that I am even looking at buying. then when I do move I will say the spare room is for my family I wont be having flat mates."
badpeoplestories,2l85ek,foodandart,13,Tue Nov 4 20:01:26 2014 UTC,"Don't even tell him that. Tell him that you are moving and not bringing anyone along. You are getting you OWN space. You are NOT in a relationship with him, and you owe him nothing. Do not let him or any friends guilt-trip you. Fuck that shit, get angry about it and cut whomever plays the emotional manipulation game out of your life.   20 years ago, I got a roommate when my husband went off to college and one of the first people to look at the spare room, all of the sudden was talking about the relationship we were going to be in. Really? Needless to say, when I mentioned that the husband was away for school and would be showing up on breaks, that was the last I heard from him.   Some men think that an unattached woman is their property if they share living quarters. Sounds like this is the case, and you should start to pull back and pack your stuff and move it into storage so that you have a quick move and friends can help you in a single afternoon.   Also, I don't know how the utilities go, but on your last day, make sure they know that you are no longer at that address and make it known in NO uncertain terms that you will not pay for any bill that you have not set up service for in person. (accounts of roomates turning service back on in the name of the roommate that's gone are the stuff of financial horror stories..)  If your friends like this guy, fine, ask that they respect the fact that you have been living with him, and they have not, so they don't know all the aspects of his behaviour, and you do and you wish for them to not inform him of your location. You have to be firm, esp. so if he's playing the friends angle, and if any of them can't respect your wishes, cut them loose.   Your peace of mind and security is more important than any other concerns."
badpeoplestories,2l85ek,Peregrine21591,7,Tue Nov 4 23:10:48 2014 UTC,"No I will not be telling him where I am going. At All and I will ask my friends not to give out my information either.  That sounds super freaky, I wonder why people think like that, it does feel like he has taken possession over me.   Luckily all utility bills are in my name, so when I leave they come with me, so he would have to set everything up if he was to stay there.  Yeah I will be laying down firm rules and if they don't want to go with that then they can be cut"
badpeoplestories,2l85ek,GoodMorningRedditt,3,Wed Nov 5 01:29:33 2014 UTC,"It is freaky. The possession of women is one of those 'men things'. Personally I think it is hardwired into their biology and many can't help it or are even aware it's an aspect of their psyches. Those times when the man is oblivious to his actions are when it gets dangerous, the id takes over and he'll run with it. Sometimes it is rooted in a familial protectiveness, but other times it is just control and manipulation. From what you've written, this sounds like pure control and manipulation. Lose this jerk for good, no looking back.   Take care of yourself, and if there's any more horror stories when moving day comes, keep us appraised!"

badpeoplestories,2l85ek,Erocitnam,3,Wed Nov 5 01:46:53 2014 UTC,It's good that your friends are aware that he's acting crazy - my advice would definitely be to cut all ties with him when you move into your new place
badpeoplestories,2l85ek,thelordofcheese,2,Tue Nov 4 15:57:29 2014 UTC,Yeah I am going to try to have no contact at all and hope that he wont try and get through to my friends and get them more on side.  One of them said that he is being sweet and protective. But I think she has a bit of a crush on him and I worry that she will try invite him back in... Maybe need to distance myself from her until she sees the real side of him. As I have warned her and she thinks its an over reaction
badpeoplestories,2l85ek,murderbox,2,Tue Nov 4 20:06:04 2014 UTC,"Fine, let her move in with him."
badpeoplestories,2l85ek,MouseMistro,25,Tue Nov 11 07:16:01 2014 UTC,"You know he's in love with you right? Maybe more obsessed but he thinks you're ""his"". Is he violent?"

badpeoplestories,2l85ek,MouseMistro,12,Tue Nov 4 08:17:55 2014 UTC,I wouldn't worry too much about him falling in love with you.   I would worry much more about him wearing your skin a la buffalo bill.

badpeoplestories,2l85ek,Zeeaaa,2,Wed Nov 5 01:18:27 2014 UTC,"Yeah, seconded. 1) he cares if you like your ex more than you like him, 2) he cares if you think the new roommate is hotter than him, 3) he watches you while you sleep, 4) he talks about hooking up with you. This is not normal or appropriate behavior. You should buy a lock for your bedroom door."
badpeoplestories,2l85ek,Zeeaaa,0,Tue Nov 18 09:51:01 2014 UTC,That's not love.

badpeoplestories,2l85ek,BaddieBot,8,Mon Nov 24 14:47:19 2014 UTC,"I would be very careful if I were you.  He sounds unstable and definitely has an increasing obsession with you; he could turn violent, be it towards you or to someone he views as a threat that could come between you and him."
badpeoplestories,2l85ek,theotherghostgirl,2,Tue Nov 4 17:51:15 2014 UTC,"Yeah that is what I am concerned about, I was going to go out on a date with a guy once a while ago and he got all funny, and was saying oh if he comes here I will have to make sure he is good enough for you. Which at first I thought was funny but now I am worried that it may turn in to a rivalry for him"
badpeoplestories,2l85ek,thelordofcheese,1 point,Tue Nov 4 19:56:58 2014 UTC,Yeah be careful who you bring around him until you're able to get out of there.  Who knows who he could snap on because he's decided to claim you as his. Make sure he has no idea about your new place and make sure your friends are aware not to tell him.

That's where I ran out of fucks to give because me telling you you're ten minutes from your destination is still putting you closer to your goal than wandering aimlessly being lost. Besides which, the courtrooms don't open until 9:30 and even if you're late you'll still beat the judge who's probably having a coffee and a quick fap before donning his or her robes, eventually starting work around noon and waking up at 2.

I'm guessing it depends on your country, state, and city, As some will have specialized numbers for tips or you might have to find a general tip line for the country in general, or you might need to find a pay phone to call from. It doesn't really matter if you are taken seriously though as every time he gets reported it starts to form a paper trail, which means that when he DOES get caught it's going to be more evidence against him."

All my furniture and most of my stuff is still there, I'm gonna start selling it off soon so I have no strings when I move.  3) I can't definitively say one way or the other, but I'm going to assume so. This city has the highest chlamydia rate in the area, and there are many, many hookers spreading it around (anyone from T.O. will know where I'm talking about).

Sometimes I hate this quote but it does ring true, ""Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger.""  Have you considered trying a sex therapist? Or even just a regular one? Your experience that night may have made your brain place some blocks in place in regards to sex and pleasure, and I think that a good therapist may be able to help you with that.  I know that for some women even achieving orgasm is difficult (source: me) so while you may have ""fun"" you never get the same enjoyment that others do from the act without knowing what you enjoy.  I would recommend a podcast to you by Dan Savage ""The Savage Love Podcast."" He covers the issues around female orgasm and sexual enjoyment quite often, and knows more about girly parts than most straight men do.   I hope that some day you can find closure and heal the emotional damage some strange fuckhead imposed upon you."

Quite frankly my parents have been brilliant and it was insulting to suggest that they were the reason i felt like crap all the time.   A sex/relationship therapist is something that my partner and I are now looking into since we're kind of restricted to intimacy once a week and I just don't get get anything from it other than discomfort."

badpeoplestories,2jmcg0,BaddieBot,3,Sun Oct 19 06:11:14 2014 UTC,"Hence my now entry into nursing, I have other medical based degrees so my options as a nurse are limited to Management or Consultancy as I'm overqualified for an entry level Nursing job (band 5) and will most likely be shunted up to a band 7 or 8 within a year or so. Ironically despite not liking sex, I'm actually specialised in sexual health and infectious disease so I'm in the process of getting the connections in place so I can work in Public Health.  If it just so happens I end up taking a management position in the trust that Nurse Cunt works for then it will be a bonus as I get to fire her useless ass and strip her of her registration."

As a nurse/doctor/healthcare worker you should not be judgmental during professional hours. I don't care if your a racist flag burning Nazi during your personal hours but the minute you hit the floor all that shit should be gone and to say that to a girl who'd obviously been assaulted in the most heinous way well I guess cunt is the right word for her.

I'm annoyed because my dog was neutered a little young, which isn't very healthy for him--he should have matured a little more before they did the procedure. He gets mounted all the time by other male dogs, haha. I can see why someone might choose not to do the procedure (they want a different temperament for the animal, and have weighed the health benefits and risks of the procedure) but they have to be extremely diligent in avoiding situations where the animal will reproduce.   But I never had any sort of intellectual debate about the subject. It was more ""I am going to criticize your decisions from my very limited understanding of the subject"""

As much as I love my parents & know they would have acted in my defense, I don't know if I could have been brave enough to confess I was having such a problem, if it were me.  I know I felt like I should be able to take care of myself at that age.  I'm just so glad that your family (repeatedly) had your back!

A therapist should challenge you a little but never so much that they push through boundaries like that before you're ready.   If you feel you need one again, absolutely do your research. Usually by getting recommendations through your primary care physician. And if the therapist doesn't help, they are usually required to also give you a list of referrals. If they don't, they're failing in their duties and can be reported, at least, that's what I've hard from some family in the medical field"

Unfortunate you got the lad who thinks he's a regular Freud and believes he knows more than anyone else. Again I cannot reiterate this enough, therapy is not a platform for the therapist, its suppose to be a safe zone for someone to speak and sort things out. (My 2 cents)"

I think I was the only student never expected to hand in a sick note.  The only teacher who treated me with any level of respect was the English lit/communications teacher who whilst she hated everyone she at least acknowledged that I was the only person getting 100% on coursework with only a 40% attendance rate! Heck she was the only person to congratulate me when I passed my final year exams and graduated.

badpeoplestories,2iky6i,roxie1127,2,Tue Oct 7 20:45:41 2014 UTC,"There is a very specific reason I chose the name Roxanne for this BPS. It's completely different from what her actual name is.   I'm hoping you have fixed that bad habit! Most of the people in my stories did the same shit, getting upset because I ""abandoned"" them."
badpeoplestories,2iky6i,roxie1127,2,Tue Oct 7 20:58:47 2014 UTC,"Oh the bad habit is definitely fixed, proud to say I've been bad person free now for nearly 3 years!! They should give badges out for this kind of stuff!!"

But.  It sounds like you were giving enough signals that a rational and well adjusted person would get the hint, but then again you gave enough encouragement in conversation for a desperate and deluded person to latch on to.   You don't need to introduce yourself, you don't need to give a phone number, you don't need to go anywhere with him.

badpeoplestories,2ibdbs,northernberry,10,Sat Oct 4 23:26:56 2014 UTC,I feel sorry for his girlfriend.
badpeoplestories,2ibdbs,Jiniue,8,Sun Oct 5 02:29:57 2014 UTC,He also has a Tumblr which still has pictures of his ex-girlfriend instead of his new one
badpeoplestories,2ibdbs,PushcartPops,7,Sun Oct 5 02:51:33 2014 UTC,now im really curious
badpeoplestories,2ibdbs,PushcartPops,5,Sun Oct 5 03:04:31 2014 UTC,"The tumblr has been inactive since 8 months ago, but he still answered a question about whether or not he was single with a yes response and at that time, the girl on his Tumblr wasn't even with him anymore.. So I found it to be pretty rude that he wouldn't delete the pictures or at least replace them with new ones of his current girlfriend. I have a feeling he might be using the new girlfriend for a place to stay or maybe money since he also has a slight heroin problem"
badpeoplestories,2ibdbs,PushcartPops,2,Sun Oct 5 03:07:41 2014 UTC,"Your boyfriend called you a ""chubby girl"" and you got mad at his friend?  lol"
badpeoplestories,2ibdbs,PushcartPops,1 point,Sun Oct 5 03:11:06 2014 UTC,No my boyfriend said his friend doesn't like chubby girls and that's why he was being rude to me.
badpeoplestories,2ibdbs,Tray2daC,0,Sun Oct 5 03:11:49 2014 UTC,"I think he was being rude to you because he was generally a sociopath.  Sociopaths like to pick the insecurities in others to exploit.  If you exuded confidence and self acceptance about your body, it would not have worked and he would have found some other gap in your armor.   Good news is that over time people like that tend to alienate everyone in their lives.  If he is anything like the sociopath ""friend"" I had when I was in my younger day, he will wind up alone and living with his parents after doing time for theft. Living well is your best revenge.  Bad news would be if you are still the same person who would become so personally affronted by someone using your attributes to attack you, then you are still going to be vulnerable to this kind of judgement from the bad people in the world who will use anything to bring others down in the hope it will raise them up."
badpeoplestories,2ibdbs,BitchMagnets,5,Sun Oct 5 16:43:19 2014 UTC,"I wasn't upset because I'm chubby and he didn't like it, I was just upset because he's a dick.. Kind of the reason I posted it. I've always known he's a sociopath, it was just nice to see him stoop to a 'new low' as he would have called it a year ago."
badpeoplestories,2ibdbs,BaddieBot,0,Sun Oct 5 18:09:40 2014 UTC,"Cool.  I'm sure his life will get much, much lower then being with a big girl who will put up with his shit."
badpeoplestories,2ibjk7,theotherghostgirl,6,Sun Oct 5 00:42:32 2014 UTC,Keep us updated on this piece off shit excuse for a human being. Can your grandfather post no trespassing signs or enter a complaint with the county? Or fence the area himself so there's no contest? Or sue the neighbor for harassment? I'm pretty pissed off on your family's behalf.
badpeoplestories,2ibjk7,headoftheasylum,2,Sun Oct 5 06:15:56 2014 UTC,"From what I can understand, aside from continuing to have his landscaper take care of the land and giving the neighbors a warning, he hasn't done anything yet, so I'm guessing he's giving them a chance to play nice.   Hopefully they aren't going to try anything dirty because it would be hard on my great aunt."
badpeoplestories,2ibjk7,PushcartPops,-14,Mon Oct 6 01:16:35 2014 UTC,"Check out OP's other story.  She isn't very big on ""No Trespassing"" signs or property rights when it infringes on her ability to do whatever the fuck she wants on other peoples property.  Interesting that property rights mean something when the property belongs to her family."
badpeoplestories,2ibjk7,twynkletoes,7,Sun Oct 5 14:40:05 2014 UTC,"why are you picking on this kid?  I read her other story first, she did nothing illegal. In this story, the neighbors are breaking the law by having a fence erected on her grandfather's property. If a survey was performed, the surveyor would have flagged the true property lines."
badpeoplestories,2ibjk7,PushcartPops,-6,Sun Oct 5 20:49:12 2014 UTC,And how do we know he didn't and OP isn't a bundle of sticks?
badpeoplestories,2ibjk7,PushcartPops,6,Sun Oct 5 22:57:46 2014 UTC,"Ok, so first of all, as I previously mentioned the guy in my previous story had no ""no trespassing"" signs on his property.   Furthermore passing out flyers is much different than trying to build something on someone else's property."
badpeoplestories,2ibjk7,PushcartPops,-16,Sun Oct 5 15:53:37 2014 UTC,Is it rape if I only put the tip in?
badpeoplestories,2ibjk7,PushcartPops,4,Sun Oct 5 15:55:04 2014 UTC,We aren't talking about rape. We're talking about property rights. This is like saying that accidentally littering is on the same level as purposely illegally dumping pesticide into a major water way
badpeoplestories,2ibjk7,PushcartPops,-13,Sun Oct 5 16:09:18 2014 UTC,"How does one ""accidentally litter""?  Does shit just leap out of your hands?  And what we are talking about is you trying to justify the same behavior that you judge other people for, because you haven't done it to the same degree...yet.  But the behavior comes from the same sense of entitlement that you can do whatever you want, and other people's rights are secondary to your desire.    At any rate, your story here is a bit fuzzy on what exactly you are saying that these people are doing.  It doesn't sound like they are blocking access to the right of way, are they?"
badpeoplestories,2ibjk7,BitchMagnets,3,Sun Oct 5 16:20:17 2014 UTC,"There is no right of way. If you had read the story you would know that my grandfather has been very careful to make sure that the land doesn't become right of way, despite the neighbor's best efforts otherwise.   Basically the tried to illegally fence in half of his back yard as well as all of theirs"
badpeoplestories,2ibjk7,PushcartPops,-9,Sun Oct 5 19:56:16 2014 UTC,"I don't know if you and I are using the same terminology for "" right of way"".  My understanding is that if you have a property that is in front of someone else, they property owner would have right of way through your property to access their own. I'm not understanding what the fence would be doing unless he's building the fence across a road?  I read the story.  Multiple times.  Still not understanding the issue."
badpeoplestories,2ibjk7,BitchMagnets,3,Sun Oct 5 22:55:07 2014 UTC,"As far as I can tell they were trying to claim that they had a right of way grant on the property owned by my grandpa, which apparently they took to mean they could use as an excuse to fence it in so they could have a bigger backyard.   Seeing as my grandfather would have been alerted to or compensated for this seeing as he has owned the property for years, and has never gone into a right of way agreement with the previous owners of the house.   Even so, this doesn't excuse building a fence through it, as it would sort of be like if you lived in a ground floor apartment building and your neighbor fenced in your shared front yard.  http://www.zillow.com/blog/what-you-should-know-about-easements-and-rights-of-way-76427/"
badpeoplestories,2ibjk7,PushcartPops,-4,Mon Oct 6 01:11:55 2014 UTC,So you are saying that the fence blocks the right of way to the property? Just trying to visualize what you are talking about.
badpeoplestories,2ibjk7,BaddieBot,5,Mon Oct 6 01:53:22 2014 UTC,You're seriously making a mountain out of a molehill with the flyer thing. It's hilarious how fucking pissed off you are over it.  The people in this story are literally trying to steal the grandfather's land. This is a completely different issue. There's no comparing them. You're either a troll or a moron. I can't decide.
badpeoplestories,2ibjk7,stosh2014,-9,Sun Oct 5 22:08:53 2014 UTC,"My problem isn't with a flyer, it is with someone standing on someone's porch and arguing with them about their right to trespass for five minutes, according to OP.  How much land are they allegedly stealing?  The story is pretty unclear as to what the actual issue is beyond those mean people are spending money to improve their home and OP is a hater."

She got so far into our heads that she was just jerking the strings on a daily basis and we didn't realize something was up or that it wasn't normal until much later. She was a good friend- when there was something in it for her. And yeah, just highlights were shared, not much of the other stuff- but at the same time, even the highlights was a lot of shit to go down in a year and a half.   Roxanne was much the same as Ratchet, which might have something to do with why they hated each other. But she didn't have the whole emotional warfare thing going on like Ratchet did."

He didn't like my friend but in general he had no qualms with it.   I think he didn't believe in any sort of sexuality/gender that could threaten him. He thought genderqueer or androgynous people weren't real either and that they should really pick a side. He was paranoid about waking up liking dudes one day, so he thought that gay dudes just had...woke up gay?  He accepted a few people as actually being gay but they had to meet some sort of weird criteria he set in his head that I never understood."

badpeoplestories,2hzt2b,PushcartPops,5,Wed Oct 1 23:10:41 2014 UTC,"Your fear is understandable, OP. To have a grown man surprise and yell at you would have been really scary for many kids that age. Especially since it was apparent he was just waiting for you to arrive so he could pounce! The guy was a confrontational ass looking for an easy target. Even though you were on his property without his express invitation (but with the approval of your city), he could have chosen to tell you to leave instead of acting like that towards a young volunteer asking for support for a library."
badpeoplestories,2hzt2b,RickRussellTX,-6,Thu Oct 2 06:53:28 2014 UTC,"No, the guy was not ""looking for a target"".  He was quietly enjoying the fruits of his labor.  OP was the one ""looking for a target"", aka voters.    OP, know that this guy wasn't mad at YOU.  He is tired of constantly being asked to buy shit at his door, and you provided the cherry of disrespect on top.  A cherry by itself isn't a sundae, but it is part of one.  Chances are that the home had no trespassing and no soliciting signs.  Having ""approval of the city"" doesn't allow you to tresspass.  He probably gets some slick door to door high pressure coming like clockwork, neighborhoods like that typically do.  Finally it got to a point where a doorbell is like getting hit.    I would like to think in this situation that I wouldn't take my rage out on a minor or someone handing ouT political or religious speech trespassinG on my property, but the only person who can give you permission to enTer and remain on my property is me.  Feel free to hand out flyers from the sidewalk."

badpeoplestories,2hzt2b,BaddieBot,2,Thu Oct 2 14:05:08 2014 UTC,"We had been briefed by both my friend and her parents that if they had no trespassing or no soliciting signs posted that we were not supposed to attempt to leave a flyer, as this was part of the agreement that we had with the city. This man had no visible no trespassing signs or no soliciting signs, or any other warning that he wanted no part in having a flimsy and easily removable hanger on his door knob, or I wouldn't bother trying to leave a flyer.   I should also mention that this kind of advertising is something that happens about once or twice a month where I live, so it's not uncommon to have a ad for a local politcal group or business on you door knob."
badpeoplestories,2hzt2b,Jandor01,-2,Thu Oct 2 18:08:14 2014 UTC,"Here is why I don't want your flimsy and easily removable hanger on my doorknob.  Say I, Mr. McDouchebag who lives in a nice house due to hard work and sacrifice, decides to go out of town for a week.  Go take advantage of poor people in some undeveloped country like evil homeowners like to do. That kind of thing.    So someone drops a flyer for their landscaping business off on my door. Someone realtor sticks a business card in the door jamb. Someone else hangs a menu on my doorknob.  Eventually I have my front door festooned with a mess that a homeowner would obviously clean up if they were home.  Can there be any stronger sign to a burglar casing homes that no one is home?  People shouldn't have to get ugly signs all over their home for people to respect property rights."

Her family places the highest possible value on family itself, to the point where you stick by your kin no matter what they do to others or you. I have a cousin who was sent to juvie for almost murdering a classmate for being gay, and another sold his mom's wedding ring for drugs. In both cases their parents defended them no matter how bad things were. The one who sold his mom's wedding ring never got in any trouble at all. That's just the culture of my extended family and I choose to stay away from the ones who are bad, but I get crap for it all the time. In terms of my aunt, I have her blocked on all social media accounts and my cellphone, though she's never actually called it. And two years ago she was diagnosed with cancer. It didn't make her a better person and even though she's in remission she still uses it as a ""get-out-of-jail-free"" card."

But the only mention of her brother was how sad her father was to learn that he had Autism but he overcame it and was a good dad and supportive of her in spite of the challenge. In other words, she used her eulogy as a way to frame herself as the golden child and her brother as the problem child. She hates her brother and always has, because she feels like he takes attention from her and uses the parents money that should be hers."

I've been to a few funerals and I've noticed that they bring out the best and worst in people.

Unfortunately my family has equal numbers of selfish people to kindhearted ones.

She yelled at one of my brothers for using the phrase ""Grandad was an amazing husband, father, and grandfather"" and not including father-in-law. She read his speech beforehand and told him he'd better include it in his speech and he said he wasn't going to change it. She screamed at him on the car ride home about how insulting and disrespectful his speech was.   She also lied to my dad, telling her that I had said nasty things about my sister-in-law (married to my Golden Child brother). When my dad questioned her further, she admitted she hadn't actually heard what was said but that she had a third hand account. The only time I have seen my dad blow up at my mom saying ""Why would you lie to my face like that?"" She melted into her chair from embarrassment.

badpeoplestories,2gkxl0,Sparklepuff,3,Tue Sep 16 20:18:59 2014 UTC,"I know that you're way past this, but I wanted to post a couple of things that have helped me along in case other people in similar situations come to read this (as I suspect a lot of BPS readers are).  I used to feel the same way as you, and I had a couple of realizations that helped me out:   If I didn't feel comfortable venting or telling my ""close friends"" about my problems or whatever else, then I needed to get some actual close friends and stop dealing with the twits I'd surrounded myself with. My philosophy is that friends are the family you choose, and I'm quite picky these days (to my betterment). More for other people going through the same situation who read through other parts of this thread: it's okay if you ""show weakness"" in front of your SO. Even if you're a dude. It's certainly true that many people interpret being sad, chafing at a shitty situation, or even having any emotion other than a careless bravado as a weakness, but that's a problem with their perception and their maturity.    We live in a society that demonizes any emotion as a weakness - personally I feel this is because we have a culture (in America, at least) that encourages people to not give a shit about anything. It doesn't matter if you're sad because you, for example, found out that the scars on your body come from something inflicted on you by parents that you don't even remember - you're emo, i.e. your emotions are invalid.  The process may not be entirely comfortable, but if you own your emotions and know that you're a strong person regardless of whether you're happy, sad, angry, compassionate, whatever, you will eventually find other people with the emotional intelligence to understand where you're coming from."
badpeoplestories,2gkxl0,pieuvre776,2,Tue Sep 16 23:26:43 2014 UTC,"Very nicely said! I don't know how, but somewhere along the line, lack of emotions got confused with control over one's emotions. It takes a much stronger person to process their emotional state, experience it, and come back around than it does to 'not have' any emotions; which is really just bottling them up and makes for horrible things when you add time."
badpeoplestories,2gkxl0,Sparklepuff,2,Wed Sep 17 22:13:48 2014 UTC,"Thanks! What gets me is that it wasn't too long ago, relatively speaking, that it was totally okay - even expected - for a man to be passionate, whether he was laughing or crying.

Same reason why most women wont date a man shorter than them. They want to be the emotional one, she wants you to be her rock, no a blubbering child who can't protect her."

Been his rock, been there for him and set my own feelings aside to make him feel better. He goes out of his way and does almost whatever it takes to help make me feel better when I'm upset or sad. Why don't I owe him that same courtesy? I do not see him as weak or anything less than what he is for crying. I see a man I love who's finally gotten comfortable enough with me to open up emotionally because he trust me and trusts that ill catch him when he falls. Relationships are supposed to be two people who put forth effort to be with each other because they're found love, happiness, and caring. I simply can't understand your view and never will but you should serious develop a new philosophy on life and women or you will always be some miserable asshole who can't even make friends on the Internet.  Some people go through life hating it and just accept that others are happy, some go through life hating it and making it as hard as possible for the people around them."

Just like that other quote which you probably forgot  ""I'm not like most women"" -most women  Listen to their actions not their words because women are brought up to be liars, they are taught that lying is the right thing to do to get their way, or to make other people feel better.   So how long did your dating this tall girl actually last anyway?   (and it's not a ""shitty view"", it's a very realistic view, stereotypes are there for a reason)"

I never said that marriage and love are dependent on each other.  I could never marry my boyfriend and still be with him and love him my entire life.   Beyond the fact that the benefits of having a marriage license make life easier for both us and our future children, I want to be Mrs. hislastname and have that celebration joining our families for the rest of our lives.

People that think the world is black and white.  People that think bad people never do good things, and good people never do bad things.  People who think their definition of right and wrong is defined by the holy scripture of tumblr and whatever gets upvotes from SRS-esqe circlejerkers.  There's nothing inherently wrong with being sexist, men and women are not equal.  TRP as a theory is insightful and helpful to many.  TRP as a subreddit is garbage ran by racists and extremists.

badpeoplestories,2gkxl0,Casualface,6,Tue Sep 16 18:35:16 2014 UTC,Oh absolutely not. Gender has nothing to do with it IMO. I guess what I'm saying is that you have to measure levels of commitment. And the same is true of friendships.   Any relationship that is a year old will be a better source of support than one that is newer. I just think that in intimate relationships often one side will be too sensitive and shary too fast.
badpeoplestories,2gkxl0,pieuvre776,4,Wed Sep 17 14:51:22 2014 UTC,"I agree with that 100%. The other guy was saying that all women were to be not trusted regardless of how well you know them. Kind of a crazy thing to believe, I think."
badpeoplestories,2gkxl0,Casualface,3,Wed Sep 17 15:22:38 2014 UTC,"Gender has nothing to do with it IMO.   Yeah exactly.  And the reason that you've only ever gotten dumped by women, is because you only date women.  Same for Mr Misogynist here - he's had negative experiences not succeeding at convincing women to sleep with him or accept him, because he's not romantically pursuing men.  I think that's why all his hatred is directed towards women specifically."
badpeoplestories,2gkxl0,copypaste_93,-2,Wed Sep 17 15:41:37 2014 UTC,"I'm confused, maybe you can clarify something for me. Isn't calling the OP misogynistic, telling him to go back to TRP, etc. basically just victim-shaming with a twist? Injustice when done to females, perfectly ok if the victim has a dick. Her crazy overflow very well could have put him in prison. The simple fact of being born female isn't a license to behave like that. She's the kind of woman who gives all of us a bad name."

You can't undo it if you take too much. I don't think it's necessarily terrible if you're an adult and only try it once. Don't get seriously into it. Trinidad and I have a friend that we nicknamed Bucket because his drug history is vast and unending. He did MDMA constantly for a few months and he just hasn't been the same since."

badpeoplestories,2ga3to,QueenShitlord,8,Sat Sep 13 10:52:50 2014 UTC,Why didn't you report PG to the police? That's a legitimate rape charge. He could be doing this to other people.
badpeoplestories,2ga3to,pingas-9000,5,Sat Sep 13 21:17:34 2014 UTC,"Because of the circumstances it happened in. We were both drunk, and it would essentially be my word against his.  I didn't think people would believe me, or that they would blame me for what happened (I shouldn't have been so drunk, and all that)  I didn't want people to know what had happened, because I was ashamed and blamed myself.   I didn't want to have to go through it all again and have all the invasive questions and basically be torn apart in court. By the time I talked about it to someone, there was no physical evidence so it would've been nearly impossible to prove either way.   I didn't even want to admit it had happened for a while, and I tried to focus all my efforts on leaving so I wouldn't have to deal with it. (Probably the worst thing I could have done, but hindsight is a wonderful thing)  Judge me as you will, but it's not as simple as 'you should have told the police'."
badpeoplestories,2ga3to,PTSDemons,4,Sun Sep 14 10:38:02 2014 UTC,"I was in a similar situation. What you can do is anonymously report the guy. It's great. I reported the guy who raped me that way. What happens is you make a brief statement (in writing at like a Rape Crisis Center) and it's completely anonymous. No public record or anything.   It's great because if(when) he does it again and the next girl files a report, it'll show up in the system and the detectives have that. You can do it so they can or can't contact you. and if they do, it's just an interview.   Basically it's like when some guy is accused of rape and you hear about these past reports. It helps build a future case.   I'm really sorry this happened to you. It's terrible when someone you trust to not rape you is actually terrible and the worst. He should burn in hell, or you know, alternatively, live with the trauma himself instead of getting off scott-free."

Also consider better friends. I have an awesome group of friends right now and it turns out I can trust them and nothing bad happens? It's very weird for me. But in the best way.

badpeoplestories,2g2fdo,banned_accounts,4,Thu Sep 11 18:05:35 2014 UTC,"She doesn't have to anymore, really. They were all working at the same place (and Trinidad got them both jobs there), but Trinidad and EasyD decided last week to move again to another city a few hours away. Trinidad planned to work at a job better suited to her, and EasyD was going to finish his college degree in a couple months. Thus began a spectacular show of screaming ""It's not fair!!!"" and foot-stomping on Elle's part, because ""the only reason EasyD went to Alberta was to support her"". Conveniently forgetting, I guess, that Trinidad and EasyD were the ones going initially and they allowed Elle and JerBear to go with them out of the kindness of their hearts.   So Elle threw a shitfit because if there's no EasyD there's no car, and JerBear can't drive, so how is she going to get around? Do they expect her to walk? DO THEY? So it was like 3 days of Elle freaking out on Trinidad and talking shit to her mom, then EasyD started getting apprehensive about leaving her and told Trinidad he was going to stay and she could go, forgetting that they had both already given notice at their jobs. Trinidad called me freaking out the day they were supposed to leave saying she was going to come home, but I convinced her that she needed to stay there. She couldn't let that cunt ruin her plans for a better life, and as much as I'd love her to come back she's better off out west. So she told EasyD she was going to move with or without him, so he had to make a choice. EasyD chose to go with her. And that's why Trinidad and Elle are no longer speaking. JerBear was surprisingly quiet about the whole thing and apparently wanted to go with them too, but thankfully the leash around his nutsack doesn't extend the required 400 km."

And I've been planning to move out there for about a year. Work is so much easier to come by in Alberta, Ontario is a cesspool these days. My dad lives in Calgary now and Trinidad is really close to there so I'm hoping by next fall I'll be in a place to do it. I could've moved this year but then Turtle moved home, and I delayed subconsciously in the hopes that we might reconcile. So now I'm setting the plan in motion again."

I think Elle knows he won't change, but she's still hoping he'll grow up and take care of his child like a man.

The way you tell the story, you had already scared the living daylights out of this guy, told his cousin what she can do with herself, and told the cop to mind his own business.  It seems to me like you had already won the fight.  To keep going after them was just pouring salt in the wound. It sounds like they had already stopped their bullshit, but you decided to to start it back up again.   But maybe I missed something or you left out some details. The way the story reads you come off as a hothead that doesn't know when to leave well enough alone.   Different life experiences and all that, but I have had much better luck just letting things go than going to war with people."

I know I am a hothead, I know I have a mouth that gets me in trouble more than anything and if you read what I wrote I knew what I was doing was wrong. The minute a cop showed up at my door on their behalf was a declaration of war. Up to that point we could have gone our separate  ways."

If this does not work then someone needs to tell the girlfriend of the biggest, most testosterone filled jock around. This guy will enjoy a spot of violence and can back it up with the many teammates and other jocks around him. The fact that the info comes from his gf will mean that he is not going to take this as an open invitation to date your friend when this is done.   If you have no jocks then a neo-nazi will do in a pinch. But, that might be worse than the situation she is already in.

badpeoplestories,2eezzh,multiplesifl,2,Sun Aug 24 16:54:07 2014 UTC,"It's a play on the descriptor ""neckbeard"" which - broadly speaking I'll add - generally means a slightly overweight, unshaven, fedora wearing older teenager or adult that calls women 'M'lady' and acts like a nice,friendly guy with the sole intention of trying to get sex who also complains about the ""friend zone"" a lot. The friend zone is where a woman puts you when she sees you as a friend despite your romantic intentions to her.   I shall note that a woman is in no way obligated to date you or have sex with you, it's just in their head that they think this. I'm trying to figure out why the guy originally said it but to the best of my guess, he pissed off a female friend of his and she rebelled against it. As such he wants to talk to her to convince her to take him back as a friend or whatever else. You were some jackass standing in the way who should've seen his desire and made haste! /s   You handled that the best way you could though. I'll go so far as saying that was the most diplomatic and reasonable way you could have done so."

But when religious people end a conversation with, ""I'll pray for you"" it sounds like a brush off.  It sounds like, ""Good day sir!"" from Willy Wonka.  Don't tell someone that you're going to pray for them at the end of the conversation.  Just say goodbye, and then go pray for them.  They don't need to know you're doing it.  And best of all, you're following Matthew 6:5 when you do this."
badpeoplestories,2eezzh,calladus,3,Sun Aug 24 07:07:57 2014 UTC,"Thank you. I did indeed.  You make a very interesting point. I did not think of it that way. In my head, I was only trying to reassure this clearly disgruntled person that I genuinely meant her no ill will and that I care. I'm not a person of hatred. I have anger, but I control it to the best of my ability. I guess saying, ""I'll pray for you"" is my way of letting go of the anger and showing the person I care about them even if they hate me.  I only ever want to make people happy. You do make a valid point, for which I appreciate you sharing. I will have to ponder over that."
badpeoplestories,2eezzh,multiplesifl,4,Sun Aug 24 07:21:44 2014 UTC,"I agree with calladus's comment about ending conversations with ""I'll pray for you.""  It comes across as self-righteous and patronizing, even though you're probably not intending it that way when you use it.  Otherwise, you handled the guy really well and kept your cool.  BTW, you may want to warn the woman he was trying to chat with.

badpeoplestories,2eezzh,xkcd_transcriber,1 point,Sun Aug 24 16:52:13 2014 UTC,"How about a suggestion?  Instead of saying, ""I'll pray for you"" at the end of a conversation, instead say something like, ""God be with you"" or ""God go with you"".  By speaking in this manner, you've identified that you are religious and that you mean no harm.    You've also removed a self-focusing statement that sounds supercilious, and replaced it with a more humble statement that focuses on the other person.  Best of all, ""God be with you"" is already a form of prayer!  If that particular phrase doesn't suit you (or if it sounds too highfalutin!) then choose a similar phrase that focuses on the other person and leaves YOU out of it."

But mostly we are upset that religion has a privileged position in society and in politics.  And any attempt to point this out is met with automatic ridicule.

She doesn't know her father well, but I'm sure she recognizes him. He actually just posted a picture on FB of the two of them that I'm pretty sure was taken during the plane ride he took her on (it was definitely on a plane, and taken recently, and I don't know when else he'd have been on a plane with her), and she looked happy enough."

badpeoplestories,2dztyr,mommy2libras,-1,Fri Sep 5 20:10:41 2014 UTC,"This does not sound like a terrible person This sounds like a man who had a kid when he was too young and didn't have the discipline to take care of them, then he joined the army and if there is one thing that the army teaches you is discipline. He is trying to get his kid back into his life and I respect that. It's not his mothers place to decide if he is a fit parent or not. If you are a parent and you love your kid you say fuck the law and do what you can. And the reason the marines are so cold to you is because a unit is a brotherhood that supports each other and if one of them wants their kid back then that unit wants him to have his kid back."
badpeoplestories,2dztyr,Injected_Americas,2,Wed Oct 15 05:18:26 2014 UTC,"The parents want BIL to have his kid back, but he won't work with them to prove he's responsible enough. Kidnapping your child isn't a show of love, it's a display of immaturity and selfishness. He's shown no interest, the child barely knows him, but you 'respect' him for taking her across state lines away from the people who have actually raised her? Right."
badpeoplestories,2dztyr,Injected_Americas,-12,Sat Dec 20 11:49:06 2014 UTC,"Has anyone tried giving BIL a chance?  If he joined the marines he probably got a lot more discipline and focus in his life and the first step in being a parent is wanting to be the parent.   And most modern BEQs (bachelor enlisted quarters) are pretty nice, depending on where you're stationed and what stage of your training you happen to be in. Camp Pendleton has a series of new facilities that are nicer than most dorms and the ones at Miramar use electronic keycards, each person gets their own room and just shares a kitchenette/bathroom.  I like to think the desire to be with his daughter in the wake of the death of his SO was the motivation instead of marginally better housing accommodations.   Hopefully he can make a compelling case, he'll at the very least probably get NJP like a dock in pay, maybe rank, extra duties etc. worst case (for him and the daughter) is he's dishonorably discharged :("
badpeoplestories,2dztyr,Injected_Americas,19,Tue Aug 19 22:22:53 2014 UTC,Kidnapping proves that he is not mentally prepared to care for that child.

badpeoplestories,2dztyr,masterpooper,20,Wed Aug 20 02:27:00 2014 UTC,"Bullshit they can't. My first memory is being kidnapped by my father who had no legal rights because he was an abusive, alcoholic, drug addict, and with that weighing on top of him choosing to go pick up a whore who was an undercover cop instead of going to a custody hearing he ended up losing all rights to his kids . His parents are the legal guardians and if he takes the child without their consent then it's kidnapping."

I wish he could/would go, though. I also think he's of the mind that this is what he'll be doing for the rest of his life.  And it was under the counter.

badpeoplestories,2d42b3,lila_liechtenstein,1 point,Fri Aug 15 10:46:13 2014 UTC,"False friend:       False friends are pairs of words or phrases in two languages or dialects (or letters in two alphabets)  that look or sound similar, but differ significantly in meaning. An example is the English embarrassed and the Spanish embarazada, which actually means pregnant.  Often, there is a partial overlap in meanings, which creates additional complications: For instance, e.g. Spanish Lima, meaning either 'lime' (the fruit), the capital of the Republic of Peru or 'collar beam' (part of a roof construction), but also 'file' (the tool). Only when lima is used to mean the fruit does it become an accurate translation.  Similar words may also fail to catch all the nuances of each word. For instance, the French demande simply means a 'request', which is similar to a 'demand' in English and 'demandar' in Spanish but carries significant differences, as well.  The term should be distinguished from ""false cognates"", which are similar words in different languages that appear to have a common historical linguistic origin (whatever their current meaning) but actually do not.  As well as complete false friends, use of loanwords often results in the use of a word in a restricted context, which may then develop new meanings not found in the original language. For example, Angst meant fear in a general sense in German, but when it was borrowed into English in the context of psychology, was restricted to mean a particular type of fear described as 'a neurotic feeling of anxiety and depression',   while Gymnasium meant both 'a place of education' and 'a place for exercise' in Latin and its meaning restricted to the former in German and the latter in English, making 'Gymnasium' mutually falsely friendly in those languages as well as Greek, where it started out as 'a place for naked exercise'.

A drunk, obnoxious alcoholic that always blows it off and tries to make you feel like a nutjob or ""sensitive"".  She will never see reality and will milk every situation for drama/sympathy. Get out before she starts crying to her friends about what an awful daughter you are and can't go grocery shopping in peace.   I might be a touch pessimistic, but it's born from years of this cycle. I have a new policy now. Family doesn't get a free pass for being assholes, if I won't put up with it from anyone else I don't make an exception for them.   All that being said, if this really was a rare thing from her then just straight up tell her you're never discussing it again and move on. She sounds like she'll never agree that she did wrong so don't bother trying. I'm spiteful so I'd also mention her personal taxi services is over, but that's up to your bf if he wants to keep being nice after a confession like that he is better than I. Sometimes people don't realize what others do for them until they get cut off."

The whole boobs in my bf's face thing has happened a couple of times, but it was nothing to the extent of that night. Look out for an update, though. I feel like I'll probably have one soon.

badpeoplestories,2bqe8l,BudongHerder,6,Fri Jul 25 22:30:21 2014 UTC,Did she get her dogs safely away from him? I feel like he's the kind of person that would just leave them in the basement.
badpeoplestories,2bqe8l,Mitch_Mitcherson,12,Sat Jul 26 07:19:30 2014 UTC,"Oh, didn't mean to not mention them. He actually took care of her dogs for the week she was in the hospital.  He definitely has narcissistic tendencies with people, but he has a huge soft spot for dogs. He likely treated them better than he treated her.  After she got out, she stayed with our parents for a few months to get completely stable, and I kind of shamed them into letting her bring her dogs as well. They weren't happy, but they dealt with it."
badpeoplestories,2bqe8l,Mitch_Mitcherson,2,Sat Jul 26 11:35:30 2014 UTC,"I'm glad she doesn't have to live with him anymore, but I'm guessing your mom and dad still welcome him into their house? Or are there rules set in place that he can't be over while she's staying there? I hope it's the latter, for her sake."
badpeoplestories,2bqe8l,BaddieBot,4,Sat Jul 26 13:17:32 2014 UTC,"She is actually living in his house, but she can tolerate it since he has been out of town for weeks/months at a time for work. When he does come back into town, it's for short periods. She did tell me lately that she has a plan to move out of his place in the next few weeks to get into her own apartment, though.   When she was still living at our parents house, there wasn't really a clear rule of how he was to act, but he was definitely aware that his idiotic attitude wouldn't be welcome. Dad is willing to tolerate a lot, but he hates drama. And DBB is one big drama llama.   The parents still welcome him into their house because they are... not the best parents. I've said it in another post elsewhere; I love my life, but my parents should NOT have had kids. DBB was the first kid, and they made a bunch of mistakes with him. Mom was mildly verbally and mentally abusive to me when I was young, but she was much worse, as well as physically abusive to my brother when he was young. Because of that, they still act like they have some sort of obligation to him since he is such a broken jackass. And he milks it.   Edit: It's almost amusing, DBB used to point out how ""easy"" my childhood was since his was so much harder. I never really got angry enough to point out that while mom wasn't physically abusive to me, he definitely made up for it. Read the ""Say Uncle"" story for more details regarding that."
badpeoplestories,2bqe8l,WhitTheDish,5,Sat Jul 26 13:24:56 2014 UTC,"I've had a few PM's regarding my own behavior towards DBB, based on the petty revenge stories. Just so everyone is aware, I admit that I am not the nicest person to my brother. But please also be aware, for every story that I have of being able to kind of get back at him in some way, there are another hundred where he is an absolute dick to me or the rest of my family with no consequences. It took a long time for me to realize it, but that is why I have cut off all contact with him."

All of us self-medicated to deal with our issues, and we encouraged each other's drug and alcohol abuse so ours didn't seem like an issue.

badpeoplestories,2azgd5,SimoneJnr,13,Thu Jul 17 20:10:11 2014 UTC,We have several theaters that have posted and DO it: use of a cell phone in the theater while the movie is running will result in you being thrown out of the theater.  Second time you are banned from that chain.   They're serious.
badpeoplestories,2azgd5,dragonet2,15,Fri Jul 18 01:52:34 2014 UTC,"I just went to see that too!  We were in an Imax with seat selection. We get there...and there's a family of 5 sitting in our seats. Parents with THREE kids under the age of 9. To see an adult movie. Wow. Ok. W told them they were sitting in our seats and they moved. To the row behind us. Where the kids proceeded to talk through the movie and kick the back of my chair. And the chick beside me texted throughout.   When we went to see Maleficent I ended up sitting beside a guy who was absolutely fucking plastered beyond drunk. He checked his phone, spilled bits of his drink and popcorn on me, kept knocking into me....and then answered his phone, and stumbled across the entire row of people (almost falling on the people in the row in front twice) and left the theatre to talk. He, thankfully, didn't come back, and he left what was left of the mickey of Smirnoff under the seat. Also, the guy in front of me kept leaning his seat back and smacking it into my knees. He stopped when I got mad and pushed back with my feet.   I do not understand why people are not capable of basic human decency in movie theatres. Teach your kids to shut up and not kick the seats in front of them, and if they don't, take them out. Don't get stumbling drunk and be a nuisance to your buddy that came with you. Don't impede on peoples personal space."

I was 19 and desperate to stop feeling like that and to concentrate again, so I just trusted the doctor. I was on my ass for basically 2 weeks because it made me too exhausted to do anything, and I actually started hallucinating at night sometimes.

I don't write about anything but the bad things obviously, but when she wasn't being a mega-cunt she was unbelievably charming. She is very personable and knows how to handle people really well, so within 20 minutes of meeting her she treats you like the most important person in the room. When she realized you were close to saying ""fuck her"", she'd pull back for a few weeks and become the sweet, funny girl she was when you met her. You'd relax, she'd start talking about how great it was that you've all grown up lately, and she'd slowly start being a cunt again. Lather, rinse, repeat. A lot of it was also that Stoner and Turtle were practically spellbound by her, and I didn't want to drop her and lose them too. It was honestly an abusive relationship, and now I think, as hilarious as it is, that I had mild Stockholm Syndrome or something similar."
badpeoplestories,2awmhu,TheSilverFalcon,3,Thu Jul 17 00:19:45 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that's the classic cycle of abuse.  That's how they hook you.

It is hard to find actual dog treats she can eat. Well this new pet boutique opened in our outdoor mall, so I decided to see if they had any fancy dog treats b/c fancy usually means bison which is one of the few meats my dog can eat without defecating all over of the house.   I'm in there looking at the treats. I found this interesting coconut meat thing, so I'm looking at the ingredient list. All of a sudden the only other customer in there starts berating the sole employee. F bombs and bitches galore. I have no idea what the customer was going on about, but the employee looked like she might start to cry so I said, ""Hey, you're being extremely inappropriate."" This guy gave me the evil eye and said, ""The only reason this store is still in business is because of me!"" I rolled my eyes. He left. I bought my treats and told the poor girl I'm sorry she had to deal with such an entitled asshat, but I hoped she had a good day from here on out.   I walk to my car, and who am I parked next to? Asshat and his Ford Contour that had to be at least 13 years old at the time. I stared him down as I put my bag of dog treats into my BMW and drove away. I hate when people act like their transaction will make or break a retailer. You aren't that special buddy. The pet boutique is, not shockingly, still there and doing well."

I was in a similar situation two years ago, although I must add that the mother back then wasn't half as obnoxious. But there was a kid trapped on the other side of the road, and neither the girl nor the mother really knew what to do and shouted anxiously. I waved at the mother to tell her I'll step in and took the kid by the hand until the light turned green.

Unless she's Megan Fox covered in bacon.   Layla is a bitch. A petty, sad bitch and I actually feel very sorry for her. She's not going to live a happy life."

And, no, my sister isn't Megan Fox covered in bacon. What she is though, is very outgoing and confident by comparison to the girls in that group. I didn't say she could pull any man from any woman. I simply said she could do it to them. She has, actually. Unintentionally, which was pretty hilarious to watch.  I'd prefer Jennifer Lawrence with a side of bacon...."
badpeoplestories,29o5xb,ihateeveryoneonthisp,3,Thu Jul 3 12:29:11 2014 UTC,"The whole first part of this story reads like it was written by Jamie Lannister   And? Jaime Lannister is awesome. Maybe he's a bit arrogant in the beginning of the series, but his character has certainly grown enough for him to be likable in my opinion.  Also, I like how you think you can cast such accurate aspersions on a person you don't even know. OP knows his sister a lot better than you do, so I think I'm doing to defer to his interpretation of her rather than yours."
badpeoplestories,29o5xb,expansionpakrequired,-4,Thu Jul 3 23:42:38 2014 UTC,Being likeable negates incest. TIL.
badpeoplestories,29o5xb,batteriesnotrequired,1 point,Fri Jul 4 00:44:14 2014 UTC,"Oh, please.  Your comment compared OP to Jaime Lannister on the grounds that Jaime was arrogant, not incestuous. If you genuinely meant to imply that OP's relationship with his sister is incestuous based on the information that you have in front of you, I think my original point - that you feel far too comfortable assuming so much about people who you don't even know - is strengthened, and also that you are an idiot. The proof is in the pudding."
badpeoplestories,29o5xb,expansionpakrequired,-11,Mon Jul 7 09:47:51 2014 UTC,"Dude, I get that the whole thing is really really fucked up. But don't you think posting it here, then sharing it on FB, and commenting on it between you and ur sis puts ur friends in a awkward position? (Yes, I know who you are and you know me). I want you to know that not everyone believes her, and I for one honestly thought this thing was worked out a longtime ago.    As your friend, I'm we're not trying to take sides because we love the three of you (faults and character flaws included). But this does cross a line in some ways. To me man, it's your sisters fight not yours and it's been years man. What does bringing this whole thing up over and over and over again accomplish? It's time to leave it in the past."
badpeoplestories,29o5xb,batteriesnotrequired,13,Wed Jul 2 21:50:52 2014 UTC,"I for one honestly thought this thing was worked out a longtime ago.    Well, seeing as no apology was ever forthcoming from Miss Layla, who continues to hold to the story, I don't think it can fall under ""worked out"" so much as ""let go of"". I do know some of the people in the middle did, eventually, apologize to my sister for the spectacular failure at friendship 101, which is why they aren't in the story as anything more than a vague reference.   we love the three of you (faults and character flaws included   I do appreciate this, I really do. But I think you have a very lax definition of character flaw. My being an asshole with a sharp tongue that I sometimes fail to keep in check is a character flaw. Making up a rape scenario in which a close friend got you raped to quiet the dissonance in your head is not. That is a HUGE problem indicative of a narcissistic personality disorder. And yes, I do have enough psych classes under my belt to say that with a good degree of confidence.   it's your sisters fight not yours and it's been years    She's family, you pick on one of us, you pick on all of us.  When Layla dragged in my (ex) best friend into it, it most definitely became my issue, even if I had wanted no part in it. Yes its been years, but our recent warm and cuddly run in with Layla reminded us of the ye goode ol' days.     What does bringing this whole thing up over and over and over again accomplish?   It hasn't been brought up almost at all since it happened. And I'm not trying to accomplish anything, I just thought I'd share with the fine people of Reddit one of the shittiest things I've ever seen a human being do.   It's time to leave it in the past.    I'd love to, yet I keep running into her at group functions. What does that tell me? Try to look at it from my side, instead of being overly concerned with her's. Layla acted in a way that should have earned her complete expulsion from the group. And yet she continues to be friends with most of them. OK, she is a pretty good manipulator, so the weak minded ones are gonna fall for it, but what's the excuse for the rest of you? ""Oh its OK that she did something that amazingly shitty to another mutual friend, but since she hasn't done it to me, its alright!"" Is that it? Because I honestly, no BS here, cannot, for the life of me, understand how you can either excuse her actions as just some character flaw or admit that they were terrible, and continue being friends with her in spite of it. I truly don't understand it. The company you keep...  This life is filled with such few good people, and soooooo many crappy people, that anyone willingly choosing to keep a bad one even knowing what they are capable of is baffling to me. I'm not saying my sis and I are perfect, we aren't. But we have never treated another person that badly, and would never dream of treating a friend like that.  I'm more than willing to hear your reasoning if you feel like sharing. PM me on Facebook."
badpeoplestories,29o5xb,expansionpakrequired,14,Wed Jul 2 23:08:32 2014 UTC,"You may know OP, but the rest of us don't. How is he in any way ""putting [his] friends in an awkward position""? I could understand how posting it to facebook might make things a little awkward, but if he chooses to do so, he's still well within his rights.   It's your sisters fight not yours   Wrong. I can think of two reasons right off the cuff as to why this ordeal involves him. First of all, he obviously cares very much about his sister and therefore what affects her also affects him. Second of all, the altercation involves many people who are (or were) mutual friends between OP and his sister.   I for one honestly thought this thing was worked out a longtime ago   While it seems as though OP has worked through much of what happened, I want you to have to abandon an entire friend group and then we'll see how well you take it. Maybe OP is just seeking a little validation that what he did was right, and to be honest he deserves it for being such an awesome person.  Now we come to you. Why the hell does this affect YOU so much? If you are truly his friend, wouldn't you rather help him work through these issues, rather than lambast him for talking about it? It sounds to me like you were one of the people who chose not to tell OP and his sister about the rape accusation after hearing about it from Layla, and now you're trying to make him feel bad when in reality you're the one who was being a shitty friend. Also,   we're not trying to take sides because we love the three of you   Someone made a rape claim against someone who you claim to ""love"", dingus. Do you really think that ""staying out of it"" is the proper course of action here? What is wrong with you?  You're obviously projecting because you feel guilty for not being a good person, but you don't have the emotional maturity to accept responsibility for it. Instead you're choosing to get mad at OP for sharing the story, rather than getting mad at yourself for sucking (which is what you should be doing).  0/10, try again. You have some major growing up to do."
badpeoplestories,29o5xb,expansionpakrequired,-10,Wed Jul 2 22:41:12 2014 UTC,"Listen I'm not trying to start a fight and I have done my best to be a good friend to all evolved, which is something you wouldn't be able to know. So let's start by clearing up some things you called me out on.   He is putting some of his friends, or at least i feel like I am (unless I'm no longer considered a friend of his, that's his call) in an awkward position because I have spent the last hour+ working to keep people from showing this to Layla. I do not believe things happened the way she has said they did and I have made that fact clear. But there is no need to have this brought to her attention because he and I both know that won't go well.   To be honest this whole thing happened when I lived in a different city and I didn't know about it for nearly the same amount of time they didn't know (I say nearly because I don't know when they found out). I didn't ""take sides"" because OP and his Sis are really good friends of mine (I don't see them often enough but that's another story) and I don't want to see this drag them down, again. I don't have the luxury of dumping Layla because she friends with my wife and my believing her or not isn't something I bring up.   As for me having to abandon a group of friends over something like this, I have done it. I was ""Actor"" in a different situation. I know what it's like being accused of rape and that not being true (that's probably why I never took Layla's side just at her word). OP was there for me during this (even tho I don't think he knows about it, I haven't told many people) and I want to be there for him and help him in anyway possible.   You're right I do feel bad about not being a good enough friend. I wasn't and couldn't be there for OP and his sister when they were going through something I (and they) didn't know about. I am there for them anytime, anywhere. I always have been.   And most of all, I am anything other than mad at OP over posting this (I do think sharing it on social wasn't very smart because our other friends, the ones that want to go to Layla, showed it to me first and I told them to stay out of it). I want him to know that he doesn't have to just hide the post from me and that I'm here for him in what ever he needs. I apologize if my first post came off as angry but I had just finished being in a yelling match defending his post before I wrote mine.  As for my level of emotional maturity... I know I have growing up to do, we all do. That by definition doesn't make me a worse person than you."
badpeoplestories,29o5xb,godlessgamergirl,10,Wed Jul 2 23:11:25 2014 UTC,"there is no need to have this brought to her attention   Maybe there is. Is she a child? Are we collectively responsible for coddling her dumb personality, rather than showing her the ways in which she is wrong so that she may grow? You're enabling her shitty behavior with your inaction.   I didn't 'take sides' because OP and his Sis are really good friends of mine...and I don't want to see this drag them down again   Oh please. You obviously didn't want to take sides because to take a side would have resulted in a conflict that you were too cowardly to face. In a situation like this you have no choice but to take a side and make no mistake - you did. You just chose the side that allowed your ""friends"" to be hurt so egregiously.   I want to be there for [OP] and help him in anyway possible   No you don't, or else you would have been. You want to be there for OP if you can do so without getting your hands dirty.   I wasn't and couldn't be there for OP and his sister when they were going through something I (and they) didn't know about. I am there for them anytime, anywhere. I always have been.   ...what the fuck? Can you not see how these statements are directly contradictory? That's like saying ""I am wearing shoes. Also, I am not wearing shoes.""    I want him to know that he doesn't have to just hide the post from me   Your first post was literally about how he shouldn't be posting this. You are so all over the place that it would be laughable if it weren't so sad.   Stop dodging blame and accept responsibility for what you did. The only way that you can help OP is to stop making stupid excuses as to why you're not at fault. I know you want to believe that you're a good friend and a good person but the harsh reality of this situation is that you weren't. The sooner you accept this, the sooner you can begin to change for the better. Also,   I know I have growing up to do, we all do. That by definition doesn't make me a worse person than you.   I never said it did. Stop projecting."

She wasn't used to the noise level in the apartment and barked furiously in the middle of the night suddenly. I woke up screaming bloody murder which made her bark even more.

My old stepdad (the one who threw my shit out on the street when he and my mom divorced) had a family like that. I was fine with them when I was younger, but older they were definitely cringe worthy. They all had some kind of undiagnosed BPD and Narcissism with some sociopathy mixed on the worst ones. His mother was the worst. She had the same thing about  cleanliness. They also never bought gifts for me older than a ten year old might receive. Like stuffed animals for my 16th birthday. It was all really strange."
badpeoplestories,29n86r,ltlgrmln,5,Wed Jul 2 13:58:24 2014 UTC,"Oh I was lucky to get anything at all in the years between visits. They only occasionally remembered anyone's birthdays (and consistently ignored my mothers). If they remembered at all they would send maybe $20 in a check. Sometimes it was $10, and my father, their own son, would get the same thing.  When she was actively manipulating her daughters into hating my dad (over some made up reason she created out of thin air) we would get ignored.  I've come to terms with her now. If there is some afterlife, and I'm stuck in Hell with her, I'm going to take great pleasure in telling her she was part Hasidic(?) Jew straight from the motherland. She was a staunch racist."

I think it had to do with me being the only kid in that whole gigantic side of the family without any siblings.  Dad's sisters were favored over him even though he practically ran the family, other grandkids were favored because the aunts lived 3 feet up grandma's ass. My cousins would get birthday and Christmas cards with hundred dollar bills inside, I'd usually get $5, or a tenner if I was lucky. They'd get fully paid for cars at 18 whether or not they had one already and proceed to wreck them, I got a $20 gas card.  Seriously tempted to write up a series on that side of the family."

badpeoplestories,29at8o,BaddieBot,3,Sat Jun 28 15:14:33 2014 UTC,"This reminds me of why I don't play chess anymore. I moved around a lot as a kid, and I found chess teams to be a pretty constant source of dorktastic friends wherever I went.   Until my last (and longest) move, where the school had this super serious business chess team - or so I was lead to believe. They had a ranking system and points and they went to a regional tournament every year, despite only being an elementary school team. I was just on the cusp of making the regional team - just two wins away. I was playing against this kid named Erik, and his mom was officiating the match and one other (a big no-no already, but they were strapped for judges that day, so whatever).  For those who aren't familiar, chess has a rule where a move isn't official until someone's hand is off the piece they're holding, but the instant they do that move is set in stone. Well Erik managed to play right into a trap I'd laid, and saw his mistake just a second too late. His hand was off his queen and she was mine. Until he slapped his hand back onto her and said nervously ""NO! I take that back!"" There were hisses from our tiny audience, and someone ran to get Erik's mom from the other match.  Naturally, she ruled in favor of her son, despite my protests and him outright admitting that he'd made a mistake and that by all the rules, his bad move should stand. I played fast and angry the rest of the match, trying to psych him into making another slip-up. But his illegal queen decimated my ranks and eventually ground us into a draw. It would have certainly been a win for me without her on the field.  Now, I could understand all this, though I knew it was wrong and I was a bit ticked off. But Erik's mom had to put the final seal on my anger by ""apologizing."" I put quotes around that because apologies do not come with the phrase ""But he really didn't mean to do that! You should be more understanding next time."" That was it for me - I came to a couple more meetings, but my heart wasn't in it and refusing to play any match she officiated left me on the sidelines more often than not. I lost just enough matches to ensure I wouldn't make the team and quit immediately after.   I didn't have the words to articulate just why that moment killed it for me back then, but I do now. If a group of adults expects kids to take an activity seriously enough to enter tournaments and be constantly grading them on their performance (the rankings chart was updated after every meeting and posted in the cafeteria for all to see), they should take it just as seriously and treat everyone fairly, even when they screw up.  In short, fuck Ronda and everyone like her - they're killing people's enjoyment of something they're passionate about."

badpeoplestories,29961z,schwann,3,Fri Jun 27 17:06:58 2014 UTC,"I had a similarly grouchy grandfather.  I can remember almost every visit with him having at least one incident where he found (as he called it) ""a bone to pick"" with me, even as a very small child.  It was little things like ""playing too loud"" (i.e., being a kid), using too much sugar (i.e., more than one spoonful in a bland cereal) or watching too much TV.  In retrospect I think it was either that he resented my parents' financial success, that I was the offspring of the lesser of their two sons (my dad's brother was the Golden Child) and/or he envied me and thought I had life ""too easy"" or ""was spoiled.""  He was very bitter and unpleasant to be around.  His wife (my GM) was very sweet but had no real backbone to stand up to him.    We spent most of our family vacations with my mom's folks, as you can imagine.  They were wonderful people.  Having a grumpy set of grandparents really made me appreciate the fun ones."
badpeoplestories,29961z,SmedleyFernhoop,3,Fri Jun 27 20:04:49 2014 UTC,"In my grandfather's case, I think he was just bitter at just how much had been lost from the family over the years. His father (my great grandfather) was actually a major player in the Chinese Nationalist Party and was both influential and wealthy. When they were forced to flee China, they lost quite a lot. My GP managed to rebuild using what they managed to carry with them, but his mistake was in selling it all to move to the US. The property he owned in Taiwan would have been, at a conservative estimate, worth at the very least tens of millions in today's currency. Then in the US, many Asian Americans who immigrated during that generation became quite wealthy by starting businesses (restaurant/laundry chains). He, on the other hand, was never able to make anything of himself after coming to the States.  So yeah. Extremely bitter."

It is the current ruling political party in Taiwan. The name literally means the Chinese National People's Party, but is more often translated as the Chinese Nationalist Party.   The predecessor of the KMT, the Revolutionary Alliance, was one of the major advocates of the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and the establishment of a republic. The KMT was founded by Song Jiaoren and Sun Yat-sen shortly after the Xinhai Revolution of 1911. Sun was the provisional president but he did not have military power and ceded the first presidency to the military leader Yuan Shikai. After Yuan's death, China was divided by warlords, while the KMT was able to control only part of the south. Later led by Chiang Kai-shek, the KMT formed a military and succeeded in its Northern Expedition to unify much of China. It was the ruling party from 1928 until its retreat to Taiwan in 1949 after being defeated by the Communist Party of China (CPC) during the Chinese Civil War. In Taiwan, the KMT continued as the single ruling party until reforms in the late 1970s through the 1990s loosened its grip on power. Since 1987, the Republic of China is no longer a single-party state, but the KMT remains one of the main political parties.  The guiding ideology is the Three Principles of the People, advocated by Sun Yat-sen. Its party headquarters are located in Taipei. It is currently the ruling party in Taiwan, and holds most seats in the Legislative Yuan. The KMT is a member of the International Democrat Union. Current president Ma Ying-jeou, elected in 2008 and re-elected in 2012, is the seventh KMT member to hold the office of the presidency.

badpeoplestories,2923du,aberdeenmmmm,25,Wed Jun 25 14:07:38 2014 UTC,"That's completely impossible tho. Heroin is difficult to smoke and the most common method is putting it on a square of tinfoil, using a candle to heat undearneath it, then using a toilet paper roll to suck in the smoke coming from it. It's called ""chasing the dragon"".   Just saying, people go through all this trouble because it's the most effective way, and even then it's unreliable because you miss a lot of smoke. You can't just roll it in a joint.  It could be pure opium instead of heroin which shows up the same on the test, but that's expensive and hard to get in the US. Or she's just lying because she doesn't want everyone to know she was willingly doing heroin, which would explain why she came back to him. Or you're making this up."
badpeoplestories,2923du,biowtf,9,Wed Jun 25 23:30:09 2014 UTC,It's possible she's lying. I don't know her that well and mostly talk to her cousin. I'm just reiterating what she told me.

badpeoplestories,2923du,Seneekikaant,4,Thu Jun 26 01:00:02 2014 UTC,chasing the dragon refers to chasing after an unattainable high/thing.   You're just talking about smoking dope on tinfoil like freebase.  People do roll mj in h... messed up.   Best option is just don't do drugs off the street. It's dangerous and you really do not know what the fuck you're getting.  If you want weed wait till it's legal.   Also you do not know what those drug sales are funding.

badpeoplestories,292f5j,storiesarefun,3,Wed Jun 25 21:14:37 2014 UTC,Nothing.  The kid's mother found out and lied to the police about me threatening to kill him.
badpeoplestories,292f5j,storiesarefun,1 point,Wed Jun 25 21:18:19 2014 UTC,"But you were afraid you'd go to court until they said everything would be handled through the school. Did you just think threatening to kill someone could take you to court or is that really a crime where you live? (We're talking about saying to kill someone, not actually holding a knife to their head, right?)"
badpeoplestories,292f5j,storiesarefun,2,Thu Jun 26 01:02:20 2014 UTC,"I thought I was going to court. I'll explain a quick timeline of my anxiety.  *I get a call in Part 1 from my friend. The friend is screaming and on the edge of tears, and tells me he found what I was saying about him. I try to save myself, explain myself to our mutual friend (who's also a good friend of mine), and he winds up cutting me off. Panic kicks in, but this time, it's just ""Oh god, people are going to find out about this and I won't have any friends"", which I thought was going to be true because one of my best friends had cut off all contact with me.  *At the end of Part 1, I find out that I have a meeting with the school cop the next day. This is what triggers my fear of going to jail. At this point, I don't have much of a clue what I said.  *Part 2 starts. After lots of tears and fears, and medication, I force myself to go to the meeting with the school cop. The vice principal is there as well. We go over some housekeeping, and I confess to writing nasty stuff about Todd, which I actually did. I'm also told that Todd's mother had called the police and found the account from a Google search, and filed a police report with us. Then, the school cop tells me I threatened to kill him, and I guess that's why the meeting took place.  *Then, Part 3 picks up. I break down and scream that his mother lied to the police. At that point, I basically thought I was 100% going to go to jail. Then, my mother asks if I'll be facing criminal charges (which, for the record, I wasn't), and when they said no, my fears, for the most part, died down. Anxiety ends here."

Has she tried getting loans or scholarships?"
badpeoplestories,28ktgx,franklintheknot,21,Thu Jun 19 22:16:36 2014 UTC,"The kidnapping charge was just some ridiculous thing her grandma threw up because she knew she had to say something.  Nicole doesn't live with her grandparent's anymore, they kicked her out permanently which I'll cover in the next installment. Instead she lives with her somewhat less crazy aunt.  Her granddad 'helped' her buy a car, but because Nicole had no idea what she was doing her grandfather had the car put in his name even though Nicole paid cash for it and was an adult when she purchased it.  It's their favorite thing to hold over her head, they threaten to call the cops on her and have her arrested for stealing it all the time.   My parents are trying to help her get the car thing sorted out but it's looking doubtful that it can be resolved. They're also helping her look into financial aid for school.  Nicole isn't the kind of person to give her family the finger and leave, so she tries to pacify them and hope for the best. I know she's looking at moving far away after she graduates."

They are awesome, and very supportive.  The car thing might be very difficult. Usually the person whose name is on title has to agree to give it away... If she can prove she paid for it, and that he deceived/took advantage of her in order to have it put to his name, she might have a chance, but a slim one at best. Note, I'm not lawyer, so consulting an actual attorney might be best. Still, she should consider the idea of just accepting the car as loss, and moving on...  While it may not be in her nature, for hermental/emotional well-being, she should really consider the idea of cutting, or at least reducing contact with her family. It'll be very hard at first, and she'll feel guilty, but the eventual reward of peace will be worth it.  I really hope things get better for her.   Internet hugs"

badpeoplestories,28d7lg,MellowYellow212,9,Tue Jun 17 18:31:05 2014 UTC,"Actually you could technically make a citizens arrest in that case.   You can only make a citizens arrest when a felony has been committed, and in this case it'd be felony assault, as it involved a minor.   However, then you'd have to convince the cops that the reason you're detaining these two people was actual felony assault. You'd have to hope that there's a camera nearby or witnesses to back up your account. You'd have to hope that the officer actually takes your side instead of ""This man attacked uz while we wuz mindin' our own buiznass! Tell 'im JR, we didn't hit yoo ur nuthin!""  And keep in mind that even if it all went down like it's supposed to, you still get to spend a lot of your free time in court.   Citizens arrests rarely go well. (Unless your a security guard, but they receive training on what they can and can't do)   That being said, calling the cops and requesting CPS, along with asking the manager about any video surveillance is a good step as well.   No matter WHAT you do though, odds are VERY good that nothing will happen, and the kid would get beat more for whatever it was you did do.  ""Mudderfucker callin' the cops on us. What teh hell was he thinkin'? All because of your winy bitch ass."" SLAP"

You not only need to start finding a new job because this crazy psycho bitch is CLEARLY stalking your ass, but because Ian isn't giving you the coworker support you need. As someone who's worked many years in the restaurant and retail industry (both times as a manager), you DO NOT let a newbie undermine somebody with authority. It ruins the flow of management, and it will eventually lead to disaster in staffing (which is a bigger headache than it would need to be). Ian keeps telling you not to throw people under the bus, yet he'll always take Crazy Psycho Bitch's side?  Save yourself the trouble and start looking for a new place, because you're clearly not getting the support your deserve at work. Clean fresh start from ALL the people you used to be connected to will be hard, but is well needed for you. And she still wants you to be a bridesmaid? Don't even both responding to her or Nick's shit anymore. I am seriously gonna laugh my ass off if they continue to plan and waste money thinking you're gonna join them on their fucked-up-special-day as a bridesmaid, only to have reality hit them when they see ""Wait....wtf_drama_throwaway isn't gonna come? But we already paid for her spot to be here!!""  But seriously, wishing you all the best of luck and strength to get you through this."

I am so sorry to hear that you're going through this.   What I am wondering is what you are doing to remove yourself from this situation. You have said ""no"" to her, you cut off contact briefly, but you don't seem to be seeing how truly DANGEROUS this situation is. Anna is pulling a Fatal Attraction thing here. She wants to get you fired. She WILL accomplish that if you stay. Have no doubt. After she gets you fired ( and she WILL!), you best believe she will go after other areas of your life. This girl is stalking you and terrorizing you and no one else believes it. This is no Soap Opera, this is a horror movie. You are Jamie Lee Curtis and Anna is Michael Meyers.  This bitch is fucking your life and she will continue to until you remove her and her enablers from your life completely. This means quitting your job, moving, blocking ALL of these people on Facebook and getting a burner cell phone so all of her crazy messages are still received on your current phone, but she can't really get a hold of you.  Get the Fuck out, OP. You are on the Titanic and it is about to go belly-up. Read The Gift of Fear. Empower yourself. You can do this!  I apologize if this sounds harsh, but I have been stalked before and I so wish someone had opened my eyes to the danger I was in.  Please keep us updated. We care about this. Start planning your escape before Anna makes escape impossible. She wants your life destroyed."
badpeoplestories,27szrf,idevourlife,7,Thu Jun 12 19:07:49 2014 UTC,"New job.  Also, stop talking to her.  Maybe tell Nick that you never agreed to be in the wedding in the first place, and you didn't reconsider your position to begin with, regardless of what Anna told him.  Then again, maybe that would just cause round 5 of crazytown, and it would be easier to just stop talking to the whole lot of them.  Also, it's obvious that Anna took the job simply to fuck with you.  That's some serious dedication, and is worrying.  Start keeping a record of unwanted contact, in case you need to get a restraining order."

Behaving like nothing is wrong to your face while carrying on like you've wounded her to everyone but I'll bet anything she will have you fired from your job next.

(Sometimes phone companies actually do this for free or allow you to change your # for free if you're being harassed)   The psycho might think all of this is funny.   OR  Act like her friend.

Plus you need to go to your/nick's friends and clear the air instead of saying NOTHING, or they'll think it's true. Prove that this nick guy isn't the same nick, and tell ian to stay out of your way.   Then tell Chris you're not fucking jealous, you don't fucking care, and that if you wanted to date him you would have but you had no feelings for him whatsoever, and that the kiss he gave you on your forehead was a friend kiss, not an actual kiss.

At this point, though, she's just going to be more and more jealous and Nicolas should just dump her ass because that kind of relationship is unhealthy.

All of these except maybe the first one was him wanting to argue. Especially the third one where he got pissed off at me for asking him to get me a box. I was apparently undermining him when I said ""Step-Douche, could you please go get me the box? I'm taking this stuff to Mother"".  I'd love to just be able to ignore it, but see, ignoring him just makes it worse and he gets mad about that. He's just an ignorant ass potato."

badpeoplestories,279sdr,Jiniue,2,Wed Jun 4 23:07:24 2014 UTC,"Yeah. I wonder often about her choice between SD and my dad. My dad is a lot like I am. Step-Douche, in an effort to impress my dad, actually saw this and wondered if he was pissed off at him, too.   I was six when they got married, and I lived with my dad until I came here to go to college two years ago. Step-Douche never had his own children and he doesn't know how to treat children. Considering I only visited during the summer, he never had much interaction. He's even worse with my nieces.  The thing is when coming into someone else's child's life, they have to accept the quirks that makes them them. Wanting to gently help them out a shell is different than ripping it open and tearing them out."

If it hurts for longer than a day and not because of scrapes or bruises, go to a doctor immediately.

Honestly, really great advice as I usually pour gasoline on the fire and just make things worse.   I have a couple of stories where I'm the bad person. I'll get to those eventually.

She should have been proud of you for your accomplishments, as most parent's goal is to try to make sure their children have a better life than they did.  There's a quote from the TV show Roseanne that says, ""We wanted to make sure that we tried to improve our children's lives, compared to ours, by at least 50%.""  That's how I feel as well.  I'm sorry, but your mom is a narcissistic bitch cunt to treat you that way.  And your dad should have stepped in and shut her up, I don't care if it was Mother's Day or not.  He shouldn't have enabled her by staying silent.  Out of curiosity, have you talked to your dad about that day and ask him if he felt that way, and if not, why he didn't speak up?"

If I were you, and the supervisors wouldn't do anything about it, I would have went over their heads and called the cops.  I would explain to them what happened, and how the only culprit could be her.  Then when they searched her, they would have found the kids' envelopes, which is irrefutable proof(unlike the loose money in the jar).  Then your managers would have HAD to fire her.  Your managers are weak and spineless to not do anything about this, and then to basically threaten your jobs if a bad employee is fired.  That comes off to me as, ""let her do what she wants, or you will lose your job.""  That is not right.  Why is she so special where she can get away with all of this and have such job security?"

badpeoplestories,267mfy,Pixie-dust,33,Fri May 23 12:27:34 2014 UTC,"... and this is why we paid for our own wedding. Never, ever take anything from a Narcissist. You think this shit ends when the wedding ends? They will hold this over you for the rest of your life.  All you can do at this point is stop caring what they want - at all. Will they threaten to not pay? HA! Tell them how they're gonna lose face and all their friends will think they're cheap, and talk about how terrible the wedding was. So they can pay up and shut up, or look like chumps.*  I'm so sorry about all of this stress, babe. Try to enjoy the process for what it is - you're officially severing your connection to your ""family"" and making a better one, one where people are healthy and love each other, are supportive and listen to you. After the wedding, do not ever take another dime from your Nparents. Shit is never worth it.  *this is also emotional manipulation, but take it from a sometime Golden Child - it's they only ammo that works against Narcs that isn't No Contact."
badpeoplestories,267mfy,algohn,11,Thu May 22 17:29:36 2014 UTC,"I knew it would be rough, but I thought I could handle it. If it was just me I'd be fine. I get really upset when what they do upsets Mr. Fantastic. He can't let things go the way I do because I always have an outlet for my hurt feelings while he does not.   This wedding is the last financial support I ever want from them. In the future if they want to give a gift they can, but the minute the guilt trips start, I'm going to mail them an envelope of cash. Thankfully I stuck to my guns in the house hunt. They didn't contribute one cent (didn't want them to) and it turned out really well. They were pissed as all get out, but in the end my Dad admitted that we made a really good decision. Fancy that? Making a great decision without them? It's like we're mature rational adults or something."
badpeoplestories,267mfy,algohn,3,Fri May 23 12:32:01 2014 UTC,"Oh god, just thinking about the fallout gives me an anxiety attack. Honestly I think the reason why this is all so frustrating is because I did claw and fight my way out for years and years, so it's weird for them to have so much involvement and the ability to make decisions that impact my life.   They don't respect me, but my mom has a healthy fear that I'll just completely drop out of their lives. I wouldn't do that now, but it's a definite possibility in the future, especially if my kids are involved.   I'm the only person in my family who has forged a career outside and independent of the family business so I truly am the only child with the potential to just pack up and say ""I'm done."" That has been really great as leverage towards reaching Momzilla's heart and IdolDad begrudgingly respects that as well. I know he was miffed about several of my recent life choices (switching jobs and buying my house) but he didn't bitch at me afterwards and even for once reigned in my mom. He knows if he pushes me, or lets Momzilla push me too far I'm just going to nope out of there.   I'm not going to play chicken because that would only be me dropping down to their level. For years I have tried to fight my way out with a scorched earth policy. It's done a dirty job of it, but I'm having much more success (and less anxiety) by telling them 1) what they did violated my boundaries and deeply hurt me, 2) what they did is/was not acceptable, and 3) you can only do that for so long before you drive me away. Much more effective in my opinion. It's the only way I can see where we all grow together and have a better relationship. That's the goal, a healthy relationship, not punishing them for their long list of crimes against their children. By showing them the short-term and long-term impact of their actions calmly and rationally I've seen change. Small change, but I'll take it. I don't know if their hearts are changing, but Momzilla in particular has had some unexpected behavioral changes. I'm gonna take what I can and run with it."

badpeoplestories,267mfy,drlala,13,Thu Jun 5 11:55:47 2014 UTC,My best friends parents are both major narcissists perfected the art of emotional blackmail. When it came to her wedding she and her mr fantastic both only wanted two other people up there with them. Her parents went insane and forced them to include other family members into the party. Besides the bride and groom there ended up with 10 pairs walking up the aisle instead of just the MoH and BM. They also without permission from the bride and groom invited over two dozen extra guests. By the day of the wedding they were both over it. They didn't care anymore and just wanted it over. It's been about 2 years since she spoke to her parents. She sends cards and gifts for holidays but doesn't bother to go see them.

My mother acted like a complete asshole during the first dress-shopping excursion and I did not include her or consult her about anything after that.  We paid for our own wedding so we avoided that drama and it was 100% worth it.  10/10 would do again.

Please, please, tell me you'll post pics on /r/wedding of you in that dress!?   Also, HUGE high five to a fellow bride who wanted a blue dress. I ended up being less brave than you and settling for an ivory dress with blue tulle underneath, but I too LOVE the colors. /hug You'll be gorgeous!   Edited to note: The producers didn't really ""egg"" anyone on, from what they told me, but they definitely do ask leading questions and try to get to the bottom of what your party's feelings are. As the bride, you will spend a LOT of time sitting in the dressing room in your panties and...crap, what do they call it...a bustier thing? They give you one. While they are interviewing everyone else, you basically just sit there in between dresses, chatting with the awesome camerafolks. Your consultant will be out and about.

We were living between our two places and realized we were just paying double rent.   Heh, funny story. We were living in my gated apartment community when my dad woke me up with a call one Saturday morning. ""Good morning! I'm sitting on the street outside your place, let's go have breakfast!""

badpeoplestories,264i0r,beccabee88,2,Wed May 21 17:05:16 2014 UTC,I think you should feel free to emphasize a lot how much you love the dress that RedMom chose for you. Really drive the point to your mother that she was not involved in deciding that you wanted the dress.

Should have gone with a regular doctor.   The one time I went for allergies (never had allergies until around 24) I touched these vials of liquid and he pressed down on my arm. Apparently if my arm went down it meant I was allergic to that allergen within the vial. His prescription was a bunch of herbal tablets. Like 6-7 different kinds. I would have been taking around 20 pills a day...for the rest of my life. If that wasn't enough of a turn off, a month's supply was around $300-$400 bucks. I said ""no fuckin way"" to the cashier and just left.   I never knew what caused my allergies, but since I left that apartment I've never had allergies again. Must have been mold or something.

I think they were just going nuts because my sister had a pretty serious and rare illness (she still does, it's just much more under control now), and they didn't know what else to try."

Never really realised how lucky I was I guess.  If I have a point, it's that it's still your day and maybe you can persuade her of that. Remind her about how her parents paid for her wedding but still let her do it her way, maybe? Assuming that they did, of course. Maybe she was in the same position you are now?  Another option might be talking to your dad, but I don't know if that's possible or whether it would help at all.

Basically it's saying that the people that you choose to have in your life, whether they are blood relatives or not, are more meaningful.  You CHOOSE to include them in your life, rather than having to associate with them just because they are family.

Not everyone that is looking for another job is doing so because they hate their current one and the company isn't necessarily a bad company because they aren't/can't pay you more, it's in their interest to keep expenses low.

You can start your first day and sign your contract on the very same day. Having the contract written in an email is useless.  I agree with him, a person who sees themselves offered a solid position should gladly jump on it, not say ""maybe"". If you don't want a job don't go to the interview.

badpeoplestories,25avnq,Koebs,11,Mon May 12 13:41:05 2014 UTC,"This probably wasn't her only offer. I don't blame her. Playing the field and looking for the best offer is what job hunting is all about (IF you have options). This doesn't detract from motivation... If anything it makes her more motivated. The company also benefits from having someone other companies showed interest in and not just someone who jumped on the first company that said yes.  Companies don't always talk about benefits in their initial interviews, but it is an incredibly important topic... Especially nowadays."
badpeoplestories,25avnq,trivialretort,4,Mon May 12 16:17:49 2014 UTC,"OP said she already had a job. It sounds to me like she wanted everything in writing so she didn't get screwed when she left her old job for the new one.  I have seen places rescind offers that were verbal and not written up, or change things verbally agreed to, after the person quit their old job for the new one. How would you like it if someone offered you a better job (based on what they told you in an interview), and you quit your current job, and on your first day at your new job your boss says ""Oh we decided those benefits were too much so we are only going to pay you x amount(say 5$/hr less or something). Or what if you put in your two week notice and 3 days later your new job offer is rescinded? Without a written offer you're screwed.  This potential employee was being smart and covering all bases. I would do the same in that situation."

badpeoplestories,257yq3,Jasondazombie,19,Sat May 10 17:52:17 2014 UTC,"Sorry, had to break up the wall of text so I could read it :)  Bitchy Brenda was pretty much your typical piece of white trash. She thought she was hot shit. But she ALWAYS gave customers shit, and was a complete asshole to anyone who, god forbid, asked her a question, and more assholery if your question was one she perceived as dumb. The managers/lead guards (me included among this group) knew she was like this, and the other guards knew she was bad. They hated dealing with her. At the very least, she was rude. At her worst, she would take 25 minutes to rotate from one spot to the next, when it would take around five minutes to have one person on break rotate and have the cycle continue until the guy going on break was actually sitting on break.  At least once a day, someone, somewhere, somehow, would get a complaint from a customer that she had been rude or condescending to a guest. She had been reprimanded once for calling a customer fat, illiterate, and ""retarded"" for not knowing how to sit in a tube, and having trouble. We were nervous to fire her, because our park required at least 100 guards to staff the park on any given day, and this year we had only 196 guards hired. This was problematic at best, because minors (who make up the overwhelming bulk of the lifeguard force) cannot work more than 40 hours a week. This would work well if we were open Monday-Friday. But closing a water park on Saturdays and Sundays during summer is a suicidal business decision, and so the park remains open 7 days a week, leading to significant deficits in staffing.   Luckily, we made do thanks to Bethany, our dedicated Staff Scheduler, who did all the rough work of patching a schedule that was flexible enough to work with busy teenagers. In the end though, we were dreadfully short and we had to keep her because there were so few other guards, despite multiple protests from disgruntled guards and the other leads.   Well, one day, she arrives about 45 minutes late to my area, and since she is scheduled on that area, we have to compensate by adjusting the positions of the guards and removing people from ""non-necessary positions"" (which the guards enjoy as a brief respite from their demanding rotations) until a replacement can be found. When she does arrive, it tuns out it's due to her wanting to get breakfast AND coffee at two separate locations. I'm quite angry now. During that last hour, I've been trying to find a replacement to no avail. Well, she takes a position, and the rotation begins at it's normal pace.  At around 11:45, she's at the top of one of the rides, and this black family comes to the top of the ride and prepares to ready themselves. The ride, by its nature, requires a sort of mini lecture to learn how to ride safely. and the guards are trained to give this, to give a demonstration using an old tube, and such. She apparently gave her spiel, and the family didn't understand because she had, as the family later told me"" did a crap-tastic job at it."" When they asked her politely to repeat it, she did, and then, before she was about to push the release button, she said (and this still shocks me to this day) ""Fucking retarded niggers can't pay attention to a fucking word I say."" and then she, according to the guests, told me ""That she mocked my race by saying what i said earlier in this ....sort of ghetto accent."" So this woman and her husband are fucking livid, and apparently, the people in line are shocked. They exchange pleasantries, and the woman tells her that she's going to find the manager. Bitchy Brenda dares them to find me. ""Good. Do it. If you can find him. I don't give a fuck. It's one less group of morons I have to deal with."" Challenge accepted.   While this is going down, I am eating lunch with some of the lifeguards who are on the Break rotation. Out of the corner of my eye, I notice one of the deep guards (those who man the pools and bodies of water over four feet) pointing me out to a large group of people. I get this gut feeling something has passed. I expect a signal, but the group approaches me. Its' the family. ""Excuse me, are you the manager?"" ""I'm the lead guard, so yes. Can I help--"" ""What the fuck is the matter with that lifeguard up there?"" The mother says, pointing to the top of one of my rides. ""DO you KNOW how RACIST she is?"" ""I'm sorry?"" I say. Right now my mind is beginning to extrapolate what the fuck could have possibly happened up there. ""Your lifeguard, think her name was... Bitchy Brenda, she called us retarded AND the n word."" ""Yea man, that lifeguard is crazy, we wanna file a report. NOW!"" The father says. I face-palm.Oh my god I think. It was one thing to be 45 minutes late, but this? Now, I am done with this shit, and Bitchy Brenda has crossed the fucking line. This could get us sued for discrimination, and slander, and can ruin or reputation in the community, which stands in high regard. In fact, it is a priority to ensure that reputation is maintained at ALL COSTS. I need to react. Now. Before this escalates.   I call Joseph, our Park Manager, to get down here right now, over the radio. She is getting canned, right now, so god help me. No more excuses from Joseph about bad numbers, no more protests form the guards about her antics will be heard. This ends now. I have no real intention of asking any questions to this family. Joseph can do that if he wants. I trust these guests. This is exactly the shit I expect Brenda to do. ""Listen ma'am, this is frankly unacceptable."" I say after calling Joseph. ""Damn right it is!"" The father says, his arms crossed in annoyance, ""So what happens now!"" ""I've called our Park manager and he, and I, are going to personally deal with this. We do not allow this kind of crap. I know you are mad, but you can rest assured that I am livid right now. Please stay here until we can get this settled.""   Joseph arrives with two security guards. He knows about Bitchy Brenda, and has had more than his fair share of talks with her. He does not smile, but his demeanor is hidden, and i can sense he has secretly been waiting for a good excuse to fire her. I look at my break table, and offer one of the small, yet desirable rewards I carry with me to reward exemplary behavior. This time though, it is a bribe, which is fine. We can use them to entice the guards to agree to do work, such as diving for sunglasses in the deeper pools at the end of the day. Everybody, however, raises their hand, leaving me to pick. I decide to give Robert, one of our veteran guards of 2 years, the task of covering Brenda's spot when Brenda is ejected form the park.   So Joseph, the family, me and Robert, walk up to the top of the hill where the ride entrance is. When we get there, she rolls her eyes and tries to ignore us for a few moments. ""Brenda?"" Joseph asks. ""You wanna tell us what happened?"" ""Oh look, you brought the manager."" Bitchy Brenda says, ""Brenda."" Joseph says in a hinting tone. ""What?"" Brenda says snidely ""Nothing happened. These stupid people didn't listen."" ""What you said was racist and unprofessional We do not tolerate this kind of behavior."" ""What are going to do, punish me?"" ""No. We're past that stage. You've been terminated. Get out of the park."" ""Fuck you, this is the stupidest joke I've ever heard. You don't got the balls to fucking fire my ass!"" ""No Brenda, this is for real."" I say."" You are one of the worst people I've had the pleasure of having to work with. You showed up late, have been rude to customers, have screwed up the rotations more times than i can count, and have refused to help guests with basic customer service. This park is done with you, and we no longer want you on the team."" ""Right. I am the most bad-ass lifeguard."" ""I think i can safety speak for the other guards that you are not as loved as you think you are. Get out now. Robert is going to be taking your place, on his break shift I might add."" ""Make me."" ""Okay."" one of the security guards says. ""Brenda, just get out before you make this worse for yourself."" Robert says. ""You bitches don't have the balls."" she says.   Now, at this park, we had these big, big rental tubes that were essentially giant donuts[1] , but about 5 feet across because we purposely overinflated them to ensure that they could handle the stresses of fat people and what not. But they weigh about 20 pounds and carry a lot of energy if they are tossed or thrown. Their bulk ensures that it can easily knock a person over, at the very least making them stumble. In the wave pools, they knock people over. Brenda grabs a rental tube that is lying nearby, where a family had set up a blanket and a picnic, and she twirls around and throws it and knocks Joseph over. Robert and I catch him before he falls onto the concrete, and the two guards stumble after her while scrambling to call the Park Police.   She was caught 5 minutes later after she tried to get to her car in the employee lot. She was arrested for assault, battery and resistance of arrest. She never once came back, despite telling everyone while being arrested that she was gonna find Joseph and Me and ""Beat us up so bad that we'd be in the hospital forever!""  Aftermath: We went back to where they had set up their stuff, and Joseph worked out a deal. Instead of having a whole mess in the courts over suing for slander and whatnot the whole family got season passes (which meant they could come, in theory, every day for the entire summer) and five tickets to give to friends and ten discounted tickets. The family was actually quite nice about it. We saw them quite a bit over the summer."

badpeoplestories,250iqa,boo_love,13,Thu May 8 21:30:58 2014 UTC,"Okay so regardless what happened you saw a woman raising a belt to a child, correct? If so you could still call the police to have them figure out what the story behind it is. As adults we are supposed to be a voice for children it's not our job to decide that maybe this child did something wrong and the mother was in the right (btw in most states you can only physically discipline a child with an opened hand on a non vital part of the body). If the police got involved and found out this woman has been beating this child regularly, they can then get this child out of a shitty situation. IMO your manager is just as bad of a person as that woman was."

badpeoplestories,24pxul,Obscuriaa,6,Sun May 4 20:54:39 2014 UTC,"Your friend sounds like a sociopath.  Key attributes to look for:   inability to value other people glib / superficial niceness manipulation actions undertaken solely for their entertainment, often involving manipulation and at the expense of somebody who trusts them promiscuity lying, even without a reason for it poor impulse control/ excessively impulsive behavior   So, OP, do your homework on this, and stay the fuck away from her. Some sociopaths end up as serial killers (but not all serial killers are sociopaths), and the nutjobs you hear about in the news- the kind who steal millions from investors via fraud (Ponzi schemes etc) are overwhelmingly sociopaths.  Your friend, fortunately, seems to be at the lower end of the intelligence spectrum- some sociopaths / psychopaths can be extremely dangerous because of the attributes I mentioned, combined with very highly developed skills of manipulation- faking emotions (very convincingly), manipulating people into doing... whatever they want, essentially.  And that could be anything.  Think of them kind of like toddlers who got old and started drinking: they think they're the center of the universe (and, strangely, genuinely don't know better than this, although the clever ones know to fake it).  So if a toddler as smart as his parents wanted them to buy him candy, would he still throw a tantrum? of course not- there's got to be a better way! Maybe that's stealing the candy, maybe that's manipulating a cashier, etc.  But the impulse is there, the restraint isn't, and there's greater intelligence guiding it than in a toddler."

Then when I was 17, I went out to dinner with him and my parents. And when I was 18 he invited himself to my high school graduation.

Also, your biological father isn't a pedophile or (the politically-correct term) a pedosexual.  Pedosexuals are attracted to children before puberty, generally before age 11.  Hebephiles are attracted to children in the ages of puberty, generally from 11 to 13.  Your biological father would be an ephebophile, which is someone attracted to legal minors who are physically mature.  All men are ephebophiles, since our hormones don't know when a girl is of legal age-- we just know when she's capable of becoming pregnant.  That's how we evolved.  He took advantage of his position to take advantage of a girl, and that is morally and legally wrong.  However, he is not unusually sick or twisted.  You shouldn't worry about having bad genes."

It was so funny working child-care, whenever a kid came up to report they'd been hit by another child, I'd ask ""Oh no! Why did they hit you?""  It was like they'd never been asked that before. Perhaps whenever they go tell their parents something, they are trusted implicitly, their word is gospel and punishments are metered out on their siblings instantly.  ... not here, though, and the kids would be stunned enough by the question to tell the truth.  ""Oh Billy hit me, because I hit him first / I stole his toy / I threw dirt on his shoes.""  -- OK, well you shouldn't be mean to people if you don't want them to be mean back. You and Billy stay away from each other for the rest of today, alright? Job done!  I only had one occasion where a boy couldn't tell me why another had hit him. I told him I didn't believe there was no reason, and he chose to bail on the accusation rather than pursue it.  Of course, I would always go chat to the kid who had resorted to a more physical solution and said (whether they admitted doing it or not) ""We don't hit each other. OK? If you have a problem you come tell me and I'll sort it out for you.""

Well the girls started going through the desks of the students and taking their things, like pencils and pens and trinkets they had in the desks (the old ones that would open up). I didn't think they should be doing that.  ""I don't think Girl Scouts should be going through people's things."" I said out loud for the group to hear (there were parents, the leaders, and the girls there).  One of the moms pulled me aside and told me: ""little girls shouldn't be brats!""  I never forgot about that... When I told my mom she confronted the troop leader who ""was outraged"" but never did anything. I continued to get picked on.  The 2nd incident was when I was using the bathroom they turned off the lights, chanted Bloody Mary, then all started screaming.  I still can't use the bathroom with the lights off."

There's a good reason for a break in the storyline and it'll come back eventually, but under a diffrent account/Names because someone in my real life has seen the stories and related them to FattyRikke, not saying it was FattyRikke but said ""It reminds me of the stories You told me about FR"". If someone can find the stories and relate them to it that easily it kinda scares me thinking what shit will go down if my ""family"" finds it all.  Edit: I can honestly understand why you'd think it's fake tho, there's a lot of fake stories on /r/FPS, a lot more than you'd think, but a lot of people writing stories either have Savant memoriies, are reliving the shit every day like a PTSD-affected soldier or are bullshitting, one series that was rather big and ran around 50 parts is easily detectable as bullshit just by the characters being totally... uncharastaristic.  One character that was described, even named ""Quiet nerd"" goes from being a quiet nerd, to threatening to cut a person with a scalpel to being a quiet and scared nerd because the person he was talking to said ""You wouldn't dare"" or something like that.

I originally typed out an additional ending to this, but nothing came of it in real life. Thought it was going to be a big plot point, but I'm sort of happy it didn't turn out that way.  Jim ended up ""accidentally"" butt-dialing me, then texting me the next day when I ignored his staticky voice-mail. I showed New Guy both of these, and we had a temporary idea to prank Jim (Gutenpranken!). It would have involved weeks of New Guy pretending to be me and conversing with Jim via my phone, and if Jim were to 'try anything' again, New Guy would arrange to meet Jim somewhere under the guise of sexy times with me. New Guy would pop out of the shadows or something in a Spiderman costume and likely wail on him a little bit.  We stopped after a couple texts for the sake of Pam, who is currently in another country. She was made aware of the totality of Jim and I's dumb tryst long ago, and has still chosen to be with him. We figure it's her responsibility to deal with his stupidity now, as much as we'd like to go vigilante on him. It felt a little too much like meddling.  Would have been an even happier BPS ending though."

badpeoplestories,22ty10,Suko88,4,Sun Apr 13 08:58:20 2014 UTC,"Lol!  I left her assistant out of the story completely, but that lady was pretty awful for me too, and actually did most of my boss's dirty work for her.  I was teaching my students French, and together we came up with a game called ""French Knock-Out."" It was basically the same as regular Knock-Out, with the basketballs, only they had to answer a question in French before they took a shot.  I put the game in my lesson plans, so assuming my boss was reading them, she should have known what it looked like.  One day the kids wanted to play, so I took them outside. They were running around and having a great old time, and I was yelling out questions for them. In the distance I can see Satan and her assistant muttering together--then her assistant walks over and starts yelling at my kids for not listening to me. One of my favorite kids, sweetest little nerd child you ever met, instantly sort of crumbles.   I should add that all the children were absolutely terrified of Satan's Assistant. She was back-up for when the kids weren't behaving, a kind of boogeyman you threatened them with when they were being disrespectful. ""If you don't behave, I'm going to call Miss Satan's Assistant to come here!""  I interrupted and was like ""No, they're fine, we're playing a game, they're doing what they're supposed to be doing."" She then kind of flipped out on ME, I can't remember what she said exactly but it was obvious I was in some pretty big trouble.  At the end of the day, one of the kids brought it up and was like ""So and so was in trouble!"" THen another child was like ""No, Miss WorstBossEver22 was in trouble!!"" All the kids in the room started asking me why Miss Satan's Assistant was yelling at me and what was going on.  Even the kids knew what was up."

A kindergarten teacher tried to talk me into changing career paths and becoming a teacher because I was so great with the kids, and a man I had never subbed for walked up to me and asked me for my name because he wanted to personally request me if he ever needed a sub. He said the other teachers were talking about how great I was, that he wasn't the only one who heard/knew that.  So, take THAT Satan. You lost a school site, while teachers love me!!"
badpeoplestories,22rq2o,beautifulbrandii,30,Fri Apr 11 11:12:49 2014 UTC,"OMG, I can't imagine why you would think anyone would attack you.

You have my utmost respect."
badpeoplestories,22rq2o,crow_baby,15,Fri Apr 11 14:03:17 2014 UTC,"Well... I can imagine why it would happen: father/husband is a needle user & car crasher, they figure this couldn't have possibly happened without the mother knowing, she's probably just as f*cked up as he is and in all likelihood she'll go straight back to him as soon as she gets the chance because they're drug buddies.  Let's face it, not all women grow a pair of brass ovaries when their abusive druggie spouse puts their child at risk like the OP did. I suspect her case is the rare exception, not the rule.  Not that it excuses CPS overlooking the facts, but when you see abusive spouses roll over again and again, you might be blind to the exception cases."
badpeoplestories,22rq2o,RickRussellTX,3,Fri Apr 11 16:57:23 2014 UTC,As someone who had to live with a couple (one was a druggie) I can tell you that either the other person doesn't know because the druggie keeps it hidden so well (what you went through) or (As my step bro went through) was in total denial that druggie WAS taking drugs until he found her passed out in the bathroom with a needle in her arm.  They're still together. You did the right thing.

They say it would be very interesting for other people because of where I came from, what I have been through, and how I got to where I am today (which is muuuuchhh better than even I had ever hoped for, lol)!   And after that happened and he refused to even go to the CSD/CPS office I realized I never loved him and I actually hated him. I love my children more than life itself and would never ever ever trade them for anything. Buuuutttt I am so glad I left him immediately and have no relationship what-so-ever with him. I seriously believe my children are sooo much better off without him in their lives. His new wife msgs me on facebook and says things I know I said while with him. Like ""It sucks when the person you love, you don't even like."" Yeah I was miserable with him.  I was young and dumb and thought I was in love. My son was planned (got off birth control) and I definitely made a lot of mistakes. In every mistake, I learned a valuable lesson.

It's a rerun of a jerry springer episode, which I think was rerun with different characters at least half a dozen times....made me think the writers for that show were just lazy, or (more obvious explanation) that people just don't learn from other peoples mistakes...  It takes 2 people a family to make these kind of mistakes:   (I was 20, SF 23, married 3 yrs. at the time)   WHY DID YOU GET MARRIED WHEN YOU WERE 17?? All women date douchebags or (according to OP) ""douchiest of all douch canoes"" when they're teenagers. Why did your family/friends not stop you?   Turns out I am pregnant. I find out a week after I kick SF out, which I did the day SF got out of jail (a month after they take Baby) we will co-parent Ill be a single mom of 2.   Abortion clinics exist to help stop ""douche canoes"" offspring from spreading.  Thank you for sharing OP, but I'm guessing he had a drug addiction/party personality when the met; marrying into that and procreating with him doesn't leave you in the clear."
badpeoplestories,22rq2o,Koebs,5,Sat Apr 12 03:54:20 2014 UTC,"I ran away when I was 15 from a family I should have been taken from. And my mom signed for me to get married because she was trying to make up for being a horrible mom, by what else, but making another horrible decision....   I am a HUGE advocate of waiting at least 5 years and being older than 25 before getting married, even tho it's too late for me. I made a seriously bad decision and I make sure my children (without ever bad talking their dad in front of them) know that I made mistakes at a young age that can be avoided... Then again they have a muuuch better (like completely opposite) childhood.   Next I had already had one baby who cps had just taken and I wouldn't be able to have an abortion (I am pro-choice, but I personally couldn't do it) for the main reason I emotionally would not be able to handle it. My son came home after 5 mos and my daughter was born 3.5 months later. They are now best friends. They have each other and I honestly couldn't imagine my life without BOTH of them :) And after my daughter was born I had my tubes tied... I didn't wan't to have multiple baby dad's that might not be there (as the first definitely wouldn't be)... So no more for me, got my boy n girl and I am done.   Last He did NOT have drug addictions when we met. He did have a little bit of party personality, but hey so did I, we were 16 and 19. He started drinking daily when I was pregnant and actually became addicted to heroin when our son was 6 months old. I had been beggin him to stop and threatening to leave. He kept promising he would change (I don't believe anyone who says that anymore). I was young, had never had a real family, and wanted to make it work for my son. So this trip to visit his dad was supposed to be when he got sober. The day we got there.. THE DAY we got there is the day this happened. I was sleeping from driving 23 hours. And wake up to this. LAST STRAW! OVER. He said he'd change, and he only got worse. I kicked him out and NEVER looked back. I have had my own houses, cars, and jobs since I left him, with no one's help. It was a learning experience that I learned from, so no I didn't learn from anyone else's mistakes unfortunately. I now have more knowledge to share with my children though. And like I said they are already soooo much happier and healthier than I ever was.. and that is all that really matters :)  TL;DR  Why I married young, abortions aren't for everyone, and no he wasn't on drugs when we dated, only after we got married."

Not allowed to whip the tetherball around super fast... not allowed to climb up the meagerly sloped grass hill... all the badass metal jungle gym stuff (monkey bars, geodesic dome (aka thunderdome), cheese blocks, steepfast slide, swingset) were replaced by boring plastic and balancing games.  When we started having jumping duels on the new wobbly balance beam, they banned that as well.  Not allowed to keep score in any games because someone's feeling might get hurt.  It is pretty disheartening, but there is hope!  A brand-new jungle gym was installed in my local park, and it is the most badass one I've ever seen.... it's like the thunderdome we had as kids, but with all sorts of awesome ropes and hammock things for hanging and climbing inside.

The oldest was in kindergarten and was a rambunctious kid. After she was caught jumping on her parents bed she got a swat on the butt and a good scolding. Of course once her little brother got involved they ended up back in there jumping on the bed together. She slipped and hit her face on the night stand leaving a small bruise. She got another scolding and sent to bed. The following day at school the teacher asked her about the bruise and she told her that she was jumping on the bed and got a spanking. Of course the teacher called the police, CPS shows up and takes the toddler boy. Long story short, it took them a year, a mountain of legal bills and all of their savings to get their children back all because a teacher didn't take the time to ask a small child to clarify what she was saying. They had apparently taken her to the office where the principle had asked leading questions. Your mom did an excellent job of not allowing the situation to escalate."

Someone sees our car flipped in the middle of the road and calls, I ALSO call, as my 2 yr old had to be unbuckled from an upside down car. They show up, check out Baby.. Baby's perfect :) even asking for his rubber snakes he was playing with in car... Cops take SisterFucker to jail (after ER)!! (Saved his life.. I was going to kill him).... Then they TAKE my baby... Yes CPS/CSD takes him. Says I failed to protect Baby by letting Baby go. (I was asleep and even if I had tried to stop SF, he was sober when he left ANNNNNDDDD we were married and Baby is HIS son, the cops would have told me that they couldn't stop SF anyway) I passed U.A. immediately. But not good enough.Turns out I am pregnant. Find out a week after I kick SF out, which I did the day SF got out of jail (a month after they take Baby) we will co-parent Ill be a single mom of 2. I fight for 5 months to get Baby back jumping thru all the hoops (being stuck in a state I did NOT plan on living in, had to get a house and full time job), SF refuses to do anything, no UA's, no visits, no classes (basically Baby & I got a fuck you). I finally win with a ""we're soo sorry we shoulda never taken Baby"" YA THINK!!  Now I file for divorce cuz I am sooo done. But SF goes on the run (SF escaped jail somehow after being taken again for being found with a needle in his arm, passed out, rolled into a telephone pole in the park, almost into the river). And I find out at this time, SF ran to be with his step sister who is ALSO pregnant!!!! Took me a yr, but they finally caught him and served SF in jail. I got my divorce. Since SF showed up with his pregnant, underage gf/stepsister AND filled out the papers wrong I got everything I asked for, including supervised visits for SF if he ever wants to see his children. They are now 10 (til May) and 8 (today) and see SF once a year with SF's grandparents supervision. Of course it didn't work for SF n his sister (her mom, who was SF's Dad's gf for 10 yrs, actually adopted the baby bcuz SF & 2nd BM (BabyMomz) were both strung out on meth). SF then remarried a Wonderful Woman (Now with the exact same name I had when married to SF... WEIRD) and had a boy & a girl (just like SF & I did) and even named their children almost identical names to MY kids. But SF & WW are happy (guess she can deal with SF's addictions). SF helps raise their kids. Where as my children think a dad is someone who you see once a year. I believe MY children are happier and healthier without SF in their life, as I surely am.

When my sister was a senior in high school and almost 18, she did what most typical teen girls do which is spend a lot of time primping and fixing her hair and make up in the morning before school. Because of this, she had a bad habit of being late to school by a couple mins on a fairly regular basis.  Well my school had this rule that three tardies equal one missed day of school, so they made it appear as if my sister was missing tons and tons of school, although she wasn't. This, I believe social worker, for the high school turned my mom into cps! My sister legally could have quit school by that age and was damn near an adult herself, so it was pretty shocking when it happened. I remember that my mom was stressed and super pissed about it and was freaking out at my sister over her primping habits. Luckily, cps didn't take it too seriously and my mother called and raised hell to the very apologetic principal."

badpeoplestories,22m5b7,pierced_celt,6,Thu Apr 10 12:26:31 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately, with thirty kids per teacher in the U.S., it's really just not possible to let the kids play all the games we did growing up because there's simply not enough adults to keep an eye on them, and children really aren't capable of the foresight to keep themselves safe.  I worked for a non-profit at an after school program and helped out at lunch a few times--recess for the younger grades was overwhelming, there were so many kids running around they couldn't help but trip over each other, it was unreal. And the school I worked at had literally not a patch of grass, it was all asphalt. If tag had been allowed, there would have been a child hurt every day, you just can't keep an eye on that many kids.  Schools are totally corrupt too, with tenure it's almost impossible to fire a teacher no matter what they do, I've heard horror stories of adults slapping children, calling them names, and still not getting fired... a teacher in my high school called me crazy and told me I needed to be on medication and made me cry in front of everyone, she taunted homosexual and Mormon students on separate occasions, and had weird relationships with at least one girl... not sexual but she wanted to hang out with her like they were friends, invited her to movies, etc, the girl thought it was weird but I don't think ever said anything... and the teacher still didn't get fired because she had tenure. She quit after I made it my mission in life to make her miserable, I complained about her to the principal and got him to start asking questions of the other students who of course told him how awful she was.   And at the non-profit I worked for, my boss had literally been caught stealing money the year before, there were receipts to prove it and everything, she refused to discipline a male employee who made sexually inappropriate jokes to middle school girls, and every person who'd worked for her quit because they couldn't stand her and told her supervisor so. But eventually they were told by the supervisor there was nothing anyone could do about it, and my old boss got a new supervisor instead of getting fired.  The program was totally disorganized, it was in a really unsafe neighborhood where people got shot on the daily and the kids would just wander around unsupervised because we didn't have consistent attendance sheets and it was so chaotic that we'd lose track of them, they'd get into fights with each other, etc. My boss really hated me and went out of her way to torture me (somehow I seem to get myself into these situations a lot, mostly because I can't keep my big mouth shut). I eventually had to quit because I couldn't take it. I really loved those kids too, and tried to stick it out for them, but the stress was affecting my health.  This turned into a really long post, but the more people know about the school systems... as bad as you think it is, it's probably ten times worse."
badpeoplestories,22m5b7,raisin_response,3,Thu Apr 10 01:17:05 2014 UTC,"Happily just found out that the school I was working for ended its relationship with the non-profit that ran the after school program, at least in part because I helped bring all the corruption to the principal's attention. She verified with other teachers that what I was saying was true and signed up with a new program. Hopefully it's legit--it does seem to be a lot better, judging from the website. I'm happy for the kids.  So I may have been tortured out of a job, but at least justice was served!! I bet my boss and my old co-workers are furious! The best part is, I can go back and visit the kids without worrying about running into any of the old staff. :-D"

Nothing happened, because she was tenured and was a year away from retirement. She was bitter, burned out and hated her job/students. I doubt she started out that way.  And then people wonder why I homeschool."
badpeoplestories,22m5b7,Xanthina,3,Thu Apr 10 03:24:56 2014 UTC,"A lot of people decide they want to be teachers having never worked with kids before, step into the room, and realize instantly it's not for them. But by that point they've gone through all the schooling to become a teacher, and no one wants to admit after all that ""Guess what, turns out I really don't have enough patience to be surrounded by thirty antsy kids every day.""  Of course, MOST people wouldn't have the patience for that, but to admit it is akin to admitting you kill kittens on the weekend or something. People view not liking kids as a personality flaw... so people are less likely to admit it when they realize they don't, since they're ashamed. Especially since they've probably been telling people for years that it's their passion to teach. Then they don't get out when they should, build up a lot of animosity, and the kids are the ones who end up suffering.  Liking school/education/learning is definitely not the same thing as liking to work with kids, as some teachers find out too late. :-/ And even if you really DO like kids, it's a hard job. You see a lot of kids with issues and you're pretty powerless to do anything about it, the curriculum is all messed up, you have to teach to tests instead of for fun. It's sad. My friend was just telling me a sixth grader punched her in the back after he asked her to move and she didn't get out of his way fast enough... a BIG, intimidating sixth grader too. And my friend is a pretty tiny woman--she's tough and can handle herself, but this kid was plenty bigger than her.  Thank your teachers--they really have to put up with a lot."

You're implying that children don't learn multiplication until they're 8-9 years old, and don't move onto addition until they're 10? Disregarding the fact that kids generally learn to add numbers before they learn to multiply them (because it's easier), I'd say that 10 is quite old to not know basic maths.   You, my dear, are either very stupid, or send your kids to a really bad school."
badpeoplestories,22m5b7,jenntasticxx,1 point,Fri Apr 11 04:40:03 2014 UTC,We learned very basic multiplication/division at 6-7 and adding/subtracting at maybe 5-6.
badpeoplestories,22m5b7,phjorg,-6,Fri Apr 11 00:38:56 2014 UTC,"The stupid one is you.  https://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081213164351AA6zzPp  As you can see, 8 is when multiplication becomes part of the curriculum. Not 5.  Please go be stupid elsewhere.  Oh, and the context was very obvious that I was saying you start addition at 6."
badpeoplestories,22m5b7,angelothewizard,6,Sun Apr 27 00:51:07 2014 UTC,Did you seriously just link yahoo answers? Seriously? Yahoo answers is akin to asking a blind person what an elephant looks like!
badpeoplestories,22m5b7,cloudwithlegs,3,Fri Apr 11 00:51:31 2014 UTC,How ignorant of you xD Maybe in your part of the world it is appropriate to leave basic maths that late but where I come from kids learn their times tables at the age of 6-7 depending on what group they are in.   I see books for that age range every day in stores boasting that they will help kids of that age learn their times tables if they're struggling. In fact I distinctly remember helping my sister with hers a few years ago when she was that age. She too struggled with multiplication. To be honest if the kids in your sons class 'don't even understand numbers' at that age there's something wrong somewhere...
badpeoplestories,22m5b7,miope,1 point,Fri Apr 11 09:33:48 2014 UTC,In Spain the kids began to memorize the multiplication tables at 6.

badpeoplestories,22lhmg,plastic-thor-helmet,23,Wed Apr 9 10:19:15 2014 UTC,"Epilogue:  Like I said, Butters and I never spoke again. And good fucking riddance. I've recently found out that she's gained a hell of a reputation back home, and is generally considered to be more than a little crazy. Last I heard, her mother was threatening to kick her out.  Mane graduated that year. I have no idea where she is or what she's doing and I frankly don't care.  There were other nasty individuals that peppered my year, but they were so minor in comparison that it doesn't warrant a write-up or deserve that much of my time.  The friends that stood up for me at the table still keep in touch, and they have been incredibly supportive.   My old school is still a shithole.  My last year of school, I unfortunately did have to go back to the high school for one class. I spent an hour and a half there every day for half a year and then never went back. I did not return for graduation and told almost no one of my plans. Many of my classmates apparently thought that I had moved.  When I first prepared to go back to school, I had my first full-blown panic attack. I was driving at the time, practicing the route I would have to take from home->school->college for the start of the year. I started to drive erratically, and my mother had me pull over. Thankfully, I didn't hit anyone (thank you empty country roads)  I basically kept shaking and sobbing. I don't remember much, but I do remember repeating ""I don't want to go back. They can't make me go back"" too many times.  Thankfully, I never saw Butters again, even during my one class in the school.  I have trust issues as a result of this, which means that any time I think someone is getting ""too close"", I shut down emotionally and feel....numb.  Otherwise, I don't reveal anything, don't communicate how I'm feeling, have anxiety over people's intentions, and am paranoid about information that could be ""used against me"".  I suppose I'm going the other end of the extreme by oversharing in the most public way possible in an attempt to combat it."

To make it a little more difficult on my end, this same girl had been a very good friend in the past. She had stood by and supported me when I went through hell in high school, and it was difficult I let go of that, hence why I tried so hard to remain diplomatic and salvage that trainwreck of a conversation.

EXCUSE me? You don't think men deal with a similar stigma from women? What's worse, it's nearly universally seen as acceptable for a woman to lie about a man, even to the point of accusing them of rape, and suffer no negative consequences, and often being praised for it.  So you have the exact same ""shaming"" going on, plus the added detriment of being slandered and the slanderer being lauded for lying.  e: and Hutt has 2 ""t""s"

Secondly, I don't know a single person or nation that condones anyone lying about rape. The problem with rape accusations is that it's often down to opposing accounts of two people.  Could you possibly be more of a whinging victim? OP never said anything to spark your bullshit tirade. Go back to the red pill."

My oldest (she'll be 17 next month!) asked me when she was ten if there was a Santa because her friends told her there wasnt.  I asked if she wanted the truth (because I'd always been able to skirt the issue 'if you believe then he is, etc') but I vowed early on never to DIRECTLY lie to my kids, and this was the first time she had asked point blank, I told her the truth, and she BAWLED!  I felt like the worst mom ever, but she still to this day says she appreciated not being lied to...  I don't know what magic age to stop living the lie, but I told her, in our hearts, there is a Santa in all of us, then she kind of had this profound look, and she understood what I meant, it was a beautiful moment for us.  I'm sorry your sister ruined that for you!"

I really disliked my sister for doing that, I think the thing about being a kid is that part of you believes in Santa. My sister is just a generally horrible person."

I figured out that she was all the others, Santa and the others, and I asked her if I was correct, she said 'yeah just don't ruin it for your sister' who was 5 at the time.  Since I found out in such a horrible way, I vowed to be evasive but truthful to my own kids, so when she asked flat out point blank I had to tell her.  I was pissed though, because her best friend told her, in front of best friends parents, because they are 'good church going folk' and think Santa is the work of the devil.  Its FINE if thats what you believe and I support your right to believe whatever you want, but don't ruin it for all the innocent other kids ya know?"

She told him no. Which caused him to lock himself in my dad's music room. He wouldn't come out so my dad and stepmom took turns trying to figure out why he was so upset. So when Dad told me, I remembered my friend fucking around with the Google Voice Santa thing. I had it call both him and his mother.  When my nephew confronted my dad about it, my dad told him I ""went to school with someone from very far up North"". So when I finally saw him, he told me he didn't want underwear for Christmas. I told him I had to slip in a joke.   I know I shouldn't have lied to him but I didn't want to run the risk of him spoiling it for the younger cousins. At the time, there were 9 others. Two of them already knew but kept it a secret. At this point there are 12 kids total."

badpeoplestories,21il1k,robbiesmirn,3,Thu Mar 27 22:01:15 2014 UTC,I've known people who never dated but got married and still remain married to this day.37 years.My parents.
badpeoplestories,21il1k,thelordofcheese,2,Fri Mar 28 04:59:03 2014 UTC,"OK, you damn well know it's story time."
badpeoplestories,21il1k,robbiesmirn,3,Fri Mar 28 05:29:58 2014 UTC,"Haha.Nothing of that sort.Typical Indian family tradition of Arranged marriage.To me it always sounds wierd.Boy meets girl along with their respective families,both discussed knowing about each other over a cup of tea/coffee.Everything goes well,in a couple of days engagement.a month later marriage.And until the wedding,both girl and boy avoid contact (1970-no phones,computers haha) of any sort.So everything basically starts post  wedding.One would be amazed on thier wedding night,my parents didn't get their private moments for a bit.my dad's 5 young siblings sleeping on the same room as they were.and this went on for months.Let me add here it's a tradition that the girl after marriage has to live with the family.so it's like new parents out of nowhere.my mom served each and every one of em' from cooking,cleaning,dusting,helping with studies for my then young uncles n' aunts,going for work as a hospital nurse.etc.This went on for 15 years (even after my and my bro were born)and thats being primarily considered by the society as a good wife.After that both my grandparents simultaneously a year after two,and all the siblings went on seperate ways(uncles went different states,aunts got married),then they finally got to be together living by themselves.Then their focus solely led to us.By then I were already in highschool,my bro in college.my mother continued working in the hospital,by dad his business,and us being in our respective educations.Years went by just like that.As of today,my brother is well settled with his wife and a kid on the way.Me just working as a middle exec in a top firm.my parents both retired are now travelling where ever their like.sometimes visit my uncles,aunts,her siblings etc.Does anyone find the romance,the dates,the candle-lit dinners,the slow dance,going to movies,making out etc.here? No,because all through their whole life they still had each other even though they were distant under the same roof.Both never were idle enough to demand any affection or complain about paying less attention.and both have immense love for each other.If something bothers my dad and he skips dinner and goes to sleep,she does the same.if either of them gets sick,won't sleep at all and stay by the bed side.yeah they fought as well,but small matters which would never lead to any extent of name calling or violence.I don't even think or recall if they ever raised any voice at each other while arguing.They are one wierd couple to this day.I love them till death."
badpeoplestories,21hi00,maecheneb,7,Thu Mar 27 06:10:37 2014 UTC,"Just as a heads-up, I think you may have accidentally mentioned Twiny's name in the fourth to last paragraph (her second letter).  But yeah, I definitely knew someone like this. My older brother was totally my parents' favorite and he knew it and loved to take advantage of it. Every time he would get caught doing something wrong, he would come up with some excuse as to why it was my fault. Like one time, he headbutted me and when my parents looked at the commotion, he told them he was moving to kiss me and I headbutted him! The nerve! And of course, since he ""never lied or did anything wrong"" (meaning was never caught), my parents believed him. I eventually learned to live with it and now that we're older, he's a bit nicer and we can laugh about times like this. Especially now that he admits it. Lol. Hopefully your sister eventually lightens up and you can both laugh about it later!"
badpeoplestories,21hi00,purpleheartz,7,Thu Mar 27 08:11:43 2014 UTC,"Thanks so much! I'm such an idiot. Good thing it's a super common name!  I hope so too! Right now, she is actually the worst she's ever been: her behavior moved from ""bullyish"" to abusive as we got older. I think one day she'll be nicer, though! She has a lot of problems (we both do, mental illness and addiction runs in our family), but I think that once she gets a handle on them she'll be a lot better. Either way, despite her rough edges, I do love her with all my heart!"

Really?)   http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title34/ar15/ch1.html  The reality is, anytime you want to take her to court over this, you legally can.  IANAL so check out what the law says in your state.  You're petrified of a shit storm(drama) caused by a person with no actual power over you!  You've accepted (in your head) that she holds you hostage. You're the one that holds the gun.(legal repercussions for her slander against you.)  Disclosure: I stayed in an unhappy marriage for 5 yrs.because I was so worried and scared of what he would do if I filed for divorce. (6'5"" with stalker tendencies)   Your sister sounds a bit like my ex-husband.  I filed for divorce and found out the ex had no claws. I mean it wasn't a walk in the park, but it was soooooo worth it. I'm now happily remarried for the last 15 yrs. to my (perfect for me) other half.  Just something to think about. :)  Good luck"

It's probably driving her up the wall that your not rescinding your ban as I assume she's used to her close family capitulating to her tantrums and it will likely get worse the closer to the wedding it gets.  From your previous stories, I would not put it past her to try to pull something on your wedding day."
badpeoplestories,21863y,halfwaygonetoo,8,Tue Mar 25 04:02:09 2014 UTC,"Heck, it wouldn't be out of line to see if there's budget for a security guard for the venue explicitly to remove her if she shows up, to be honest."
badpeoplestories,21863y,beautifulbrandii,10,Tue Mar 25 06:08:18 2014 UTC,"You should do yourself a favor and get a restraining order against her, in case you haven't already. It's been suggested in the comments that your mother might try to bring her to the wedding or to your house to ""reconcile"" the two of you. You might not believe that your mother would be so dense, but if she ever does attempt it (and she certainly won't warn you beforehand), you'll be really glad you got that restraining order. As a court document, it means that you can call 911 the moment your sister shows up and she'll be whisked away immediately, no questions asked. You snap your fingers, she's gone.   The incident, if there is one, won't be over quickly if you don't have a restraining order. The police will arrive, at your wedding, and you'll have to find some way of explaining why she needs to be taken away. Meanwhile your family will be haggling with you and taking sides. Your sister will be putting on the waterworks and being awful. It'll get ugly. Who has time for that shit at their own wedding?"
badpeoplestories,21863y,generalwalrus,3,Sun Mar 30 15:54:40 2014 UTC,"Since her mother is firmly in denial about the possibility of mental issues, I could definitely see her pulling that.  Even a firm phone call or face-to-face talk in which the OP states ""under no circumstance do I want her at my wedding.  Anyone who brings her can consider themselves not invited either,'  with eye contact (or something along that level), might not work; cognitive dissonance is a real bitch."
badpeoplestories,21863y,thelordofcheese,6,Fri Mar 28 04:54:35 2014 UTC,"I can empathize with your struggle. I was fortunate enough to grow up with a couple of people like this. A step brother from my dad's second marriage, and a step sister from my mom's second marriage. We were all around the same age growing up, but one of the first things I noticed when I meant each of them was there affinity for telling very tall tales that were obviously not true but in different ways.    The step brother's lies were mostly innocent one upper type of things. Telling extravagant stories about things that never happened, or to get him out of trouble, but never really caused any drama. And would not lie to defame someone else or cause drama. Just innocent stories that never really hurt anybody.    The step sister was a bit more manipulative. She would tell lies to gain favor with people. When I first met her (both 10 years old) one of the first things that came up was how her boyfriend got her pregnant and beat her with a baseball bat to make her miscarry.    I went away in the military for 10 years and just came back home, and decided since it has been so long that they both may have changed, or at least give them the benefit of the doubt. A couple years ago, the step sister and my mutual ( much younger ) brother moved in with the step sister. He never really knew her that well, and/or had the capacity to know who she was due to the age difference. I didn't want to say anything to him as I haven't really spent much time with her in a long time and, she is his sister and wouldn't want to sound like an asshole saying ""your sister has issues just like your dad.""    He just moved out after a bunch of drama she created catalysed by the step sister telling one of his girlfriends friends that he cheated on her, which of course got back to the girl friend. He is not the cheating type and is too busy working and spending time with his girlfriend to even cheat.  So yeah, I guess neither of them changed, but at least the brother is mostly harmless.    There's got to be some sort of name for this type of behavior, because it is not normal, and there is definitely something wrong mentally there."
badpeoplestories,21863y,TristanVash38,9,Sun Mar 30 15:58:24 2014 UTC,"I know that her ""tales"" hurt and make you angry. Especially when other people believe some part of them.   I've been there. I know exactly what you're going through. Please don't allow her to diminish your joy in your life.  The only way I've found to stop this behavior is to STOP hearing it.   Even though you've blocked her, stopped talking to her, refused to allow her in your life, she knows that your family and friends continue to tell you what she does. She knows she still has the ability to get to you.  From now on, ANY time someone brings her up (including your parents) tell them ""Stop. I don't want to hear anything good or bad about her. I don't want you to talk to me about her."" Continue saying it to everyone until they no longer speak about her.   THEY will inform your sis that YOU don't hear anything about what she does. That anything that she does doesn't affect you in any way, because YOU don't know about it. The positive effects are that you are happy and that it will make her furious."

Sorry for terrible formatting etc, I'm on my phone.   Long back story short: I'm living with my MIL, her husband (call him DD), my husband (call him DL), my 1 year old (call her BL) and (back then) my SIL (call her CA). This story happened about 4 months ago, CA has since moved out.   Anyhoo, when we first moved out here, we just tried to get jobs and didn't do much socializing with CA, but afterwards, at about 1 month after moving here, we found out she smoked pot too, so we would, every now and then we would smoke a bowl together at night.   Cut to about 2 months in to us living here, and CA has started talking to her BF again, and gets uber depressed. Me being the nice naive person I am, try to connect with her and talk to her. She is rude and just a nasty person. Egotistic, uncaring, tactless. Just gross. (There's a lot of backstory to her. when I have more time and if there's interest I'll post more.)   Anyway. 3 months in, she FLIPS SHIT, for some reason, goes literally batshit crazy and believes her bf gave her HIV and she gave it to us through bed bugs. Checks herself into the ER, all that's wrong with her is a minor UTI. They send her home.   Next day, she's convinced she's dying and she's passing it all to us. DL and I try to hang out with her, smoke a bowl with her to calm her down etc, she starts just getting extremely paranoid that all the cops are looking for her, that she's killing the city we're in. Just crazy. (She took 2 hits off a regular bowl.) So we take her home, go grab some food and head back cuz DL has a bad feeling. We eat, go home, check on BL(sleeping soundly) and go to bed.   3am, DD is knocking on our bedroom door with 3 POLICE OFFICERS. They tell my husband that fucking CA TOOK MY GODDAMN KID She walked a mile and took her to the hospital because she was convinced we were all dead. We rush to the hospital, grab my kid and sleep all the same bed that night. CA goes to a 72watch, some therapy and that's it. I've cut her out of my life.   I'm shaking right now re-living this, so I'll write more later, again if anyone cares. BL is fine, doesn't remember or seem to remember the event. :)"

Back in 2003(when we were still dating), we took a trip down to Georgia to see relatives of mine.  He had never seen the Atlantic Ocean before, so we took a day trip to Savannah and Tybee Island.  While we were in the ocean, both of us ended up getting stung by jellyfish.  And oh boy does that hurt!!!  We both jumped sky high and ran out of the water so fast you would think we were Speedy Gonzalez.  But once we got back that night to my relative's house(and ever since then), he changed the story.  His story was that I got stung by a jellyfish, but HE got stung by a(more intimidating looking) stingray.  I don't know why he changed it, I figure it looks more ""manly"" than a jellyfish lol.  And a couple of years later when Steve Irwin died(by a stingray), he instantly said, ""Thank God that stingray that stung me only got my ankle, he could have killed me!""  I just laughed and said, yeah except for the fact that it was a jellyfish.  To this day, he will not admit that it was a jellyfish. Lol."

I personally believe that the best kids have parents that completely enjoy them. But, then again, I'm biased. LOL"
badpeoplestories,20x1lp,Kay_Kat,2,Sun Mar 23 02:10:04 2014 UTC,"I totally agree!! People are always complaining that their children are bad or naughty... And the first thing I always say is ""Children need attention. If they are acting out its because negative attention is better than no attention!!"" I nursed my son 19 mos. and my daughter 13 mos. (and NO I am not saying anything bad about people who don't/can't). I wouldn't change that bond for anything. People keep asking me if me and my current fiancé plan on having more kids, and I always get the same response every time I give my answer. NO I do not want more because I am a 100% hands on, pay attention 24/7, play with my children, talk and teach them as adults, and put alllll my time into making them the best people they can be. With that said, I am not willing to go through the amount of time and patience it takes to start over at baby again... SO NO I don't want more children and that's my choice. As I have one of each, same dad, and we are wayyyyy past diapers I think my answer is reasonable even if others can't understand my decision - because children don't take thaaaaaatttt much work.. HAH!!!! A lil news flash: They DO take THAT much work if you plan on them becoming functioning, healthy, good members of society.. AND it's the parent's job to teach them to be the best person they can become, so if your child fails miserably as an adult, its probably something you did as a parent, tho not always, I do know!  But yes they are great ages and just Grand!! I do enjoy them every day, even the naughty moments and misbehaving that all children do learning lessons. You also help make the best kids when you lead by example. Happy mommy in any situation, even bad/hard times are met with a smile & nothing can get me down attitude, creates happy children. Talking things through and explaining everything helps a whole lot more than ""Because I said so"" and you will teach a lot more lessons with words than physical contact... Teaching 'No Hitting' with hitting doesn't make sense... And my son now cries and whines ""PLEEEAAAASSEEEE Juuuust STTTOOOPPPPPPP talking. I get it. PLLLLEEEEEEAAAAASSSSEEEE MOM!!!"" LOL  Thank you tho for the kind words and you seem like the reason why your boys turned out to be amazing men! :)"
badpeoplestories,20x1lp,drlala,5,Sun Mar 23 02:51:05 2014 UTC,"You sound like you're doing all the right things. I started rolling when I read about how your son cries and whines. Mine did the same! LMAO  Once my kids became adults, I have spoken with them about the things that I did right and wrong. The things that they appreciated the most was being able to talk to me, talking to them like adults, explaining to them what they didn't understand and being clear on the rules. They weren't so fond of the punishments (no I didn't hit either), but they always knew what they were going to be and I always followed through with them. I kept a list of rules and their corresponding punishments on the fridge. If they felt I was wrong in punishing them, they even had the ability to talk with me about why. Sometimes, I did change my mind.   As teenagers, they appreciated that I stepped back and let them handle any situations that came up, but always stood behind them. I would guide them, but not lead them. That I had expectations for the way they acted and the things they did, but didn't force them. If they fell, I helped pick them up, but only if they asked. Most of the time, they wanted to pick themselves up. They were still able to talk to me about anything. Don't get me wrong, they were still teenagers and had to deal with all the angst, we had some troubling times, but, for the most part, it was really good.   I will also admit.. Activities and sports saved me. The more active they were, the less time they had to get into trouble. LOL  The next time someone brings up you having more children, just smile at them, say ""Thank you. You're so sweet. But I'm happy with the way things are."" If nothing else, it'll stump them too much for a comeback."

If they're offering to speak to your PI friend it's worth a shot, if you mention that this may avoid bringing the police into it if she pays up then this may work.  Other than that, damaging her life is the best you're going to get if the police can't help you."
badpeoplestories,20hwx2,GMDynamo,4,Sat Mar 15 20:44:07 2014 UTC,"These spiritual dudes said that she was no longer visiting them as of a month or so ago. For all I know, they could be lying their asses off to get us off their backs but I'm considering them to be a dead end for now. That said, we did tell them that if they dropped hints to her about repaying me, they would get a reward.  There are a few options available to me at this point, but I'm not entirely keen on pursuing them just yet as taking those measures would most likely cause her to refuse to pay straight away. I actually work for the law enforcement, and attempting to bring the cops in could get her to raise up a stink and make all kinds of false accusations at me.  A had stepped in to contact her on my behalf and managed to actually get a reply. Surprise surprise, A got a whole heap of self-righteous indignation for her trouble. More BS about how misunderstood B is. How if the roles were reversed and B was the one who loaned a friend money in her time of need, B wouldn't even ask for the money back and just wait patiently for said friend to return the money as and when they wanted to.   Right now, my girlfriend and other close friends are trying to persuade me to lay ruin to her life seeing as B seems to be an unrepentant bitch."
badpeoplestories,20hwx2,CountofAccount,7,Sun Mar 16 04:59:25 2014 UTC,"You are not going to get your money back; she'd avoid paying as a matter of principle. Bad people don't add to your life, so I would cut your losses and keep away from this person (and tell others to keep away), unless you have workable legal recourse or real criminal activity to report. I cannot help you there.  You could anon message everyone in her friends and contacts that she's a bad person with all that you found in order to warn them off, but that will have minimal impact if they are already invested in her and chances are she would find out."
badpeoplestories,20hwx2,hemlocky_ergot,2,Sat Mar 15 19:10:20 2014 UTC,"I've pretty much known that the likelihood of me getting my money back is probably 0.000001% but I'll be damned if I'm going to let her get away this easily. I'm still trying to be civil and polite but the option of texting every single person she knows with screenshots of my conversation with her (her request to borrow money, me telling her I'll loan her money with a specified time frame for her to repay me, her agreeing to the conditions and acknowledging having received the money, the subsequent begging for money and the huge meltdown which basically shows her turning into a downright insane bitch) is starting to really appeal to me."
badpeoplestories,20hwx2,drlala,3,Sun Mar 16 05:05:44 2014 UTC,"Honestly, if she is an attorney and has lied on her resume to get her new position perhaps you can send an email to the HR Department of her new firm advising them of what you know...   Either way, if she's as crazy as she sounds and isn't putting forth good work product I'm sure she will be fired soon enough."
badpeoplestories,20hwx2,idevourlife,3,Mon Mar 17 01:37:14 2014 UTC,"An email containing all the details I've discovered along with evidence verified by witnesses supporting my statements has been drafted. I am still hesitant about hitting 'Send' and forwarding all of it to every single person she knows as well as her current employers and the Law Society (government organisation which serves as a watchdog for the legal profession in the country). Doing so would probably cause a great deal of harm to her and her family. Now I honestly couldn't care less about what happens to her. She deserves what's coming, but her family would just end up being collateral damage and that isn't fair to them.  That said, if she continues to be an unrepentant bitch, I guess it's just too bad for her and she will just have to deal with her family's wrath.  I'm just utterly amazed at how delusion and self-absorbed a person can be. It's gotten to a point where she seems to have convinced herself that she can do no wrong, and every one in the world is out to get her and cheat her of the fame and fortune that she rightfully deserves.    EDIT: A former colleague of mine who is working at her current firm has just told me that B is currently treading on thin ice due to the many complaints from her boss about her quality of work."

She and I were both fairly awkward socially, but we got along really well together. Unfortunately, 2 guys who used to be good friends of mine sat on either side of us during physics found out, and started making rude comments that made us both feel awkward. It didn't last much longer after that. I still hate those guys."

There are a lot of things I wish I could undo to myself and others. I've thought about it and talked about it with my husband, and he thinks it has something to do with my parents. Now that I am writing this and got me going through these awful memories, I think my destructive behavior was the result of being bullied and abused by an adult. As a child, you look up to adult looking for guidance and protection, but he did the total opposite."

badpeoplestories,20docz,bukowskis_bluebird,30,Fri Mar 14 04:29:53 2014 UTC,Call CPS. Especially if the mother's on drugs.
badpeoplestories,20docz,boo_love,8,Fri Mar 14 04:56:46 2014 UTC,"To my knowledge she is no longer on drugs. Or at least, she was pregnant or breastfeeding from December 2012 - January 2014. She seemed pretty stable until December 2013.   She emotionally neglects her son but still feeds him and he goes to school. As far as I can see there is no substantial physical abuse. Any physical abuse is mostly emotionally damaging (dad puts him in head locks that sort of thing)  CPS wouldn't help with any of that. He is fed, clothed, and being educated. He's not being beaten. As far as I know, she isn't on drugs today. They won't do a thing."
badpeoplestories,20docz,boo_love,11,Fri Mar 14 05:05:50 2014 UTC,"CPS will still investigate mental/emotional abuse. The child is old enough to talk and he can tell the workers how he feels. Abuse is abuse no matter what form. If he really doesn't like being away from y'all and he hates his parents he'll tell the social worker everything that they have done! You can make an anonymous tip and they'll never know it was you. Just think about it if he is being abused should he really have to endure it? If there is no abuse then that's one thing you won't have to worry about. For the sake of the children just call. We have to be the voice for children, we have to stand up and help them."
badpeoplestories,20docz,boo_love,15,Fri Mar 14 15:40:22 2014 UTC,I called and made a report earlier this morning. Maybe something will come of it. But I doubt they'll even be visited. The lady seemed really incredulous because I haven't even seen them since Thanksgiving. She asked why I didn't call in sooner and I told her that it seemed bad before but his mom was in a worse mental state now. I told her that I just worried for the kids and wanted them to be aware.   I've made a much worse report to CPS before and nothing happened. I don't anticipate that this will do anything at all.
badpeoplestories,20docz,bukowskis_bluebird,5,Fri Mar 14 16:31:58 2014 UTC,"As long as you have called it in that's all you can do at this point. If something bad does end up happening and CPS didn't do anything to stop it, you can have a clear conscious knowing you tried! Just keep track of everything you see or hear happen. If you bring in a log of everything, CPS will have to do a full investigation. Also if you can get other people in the family to make the call then there is more than just one report and again CPS has to investigate."
badpeoplestories,20docz,therealbessica,7,Fri Mar 14 18:00:03 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty alone in wanting what is best for those kids. Believe it or not, she's the best mother of the bunch.   It's a horrible family and I just feel bad for the kids.   To be clear, the other time I reported to CPS was for my OTHER sister in law who is way worse."
badpeoplestories,20docz,therealbessica,4,Fri Mar 14 18:17:49 2014 UTC,Damn that's awful! As a daycare provider it sickens me to hear this kind of stuff happening without any resolve for the children.
badpeoplestories,20docz,therealbessica,4,Fri Mar 14 23:22:27 2014 UTC,Is she still dealing? A few anonymous tips to the police wouldn't go awry. Both parents is prison? You might be able to make a court case for permanent custody.
badpeoplestories,20docz,Phobos_Deimos,3,Fri Mar 14 05:22:51 2014 UTC,"I don't really know if she's dealing. She cut us out. I only knew she was dealing back then because I always had her son. I know that about six months ago, she was dealing pot on a small time level. At worst she'd lose her medical marijuana card and get a fine. All that would do is mean that there is less money for her kids.   Her boyfriend is out of jail now and back at home. I'd have to get him arrested too.   That would be awesome if it happened though -- no denying that."
badpeoplestories,20docz,generousheart,5,Fri Mar 14 05:25:30 2014 UTC,If she is still selling out of her home she can be charged with child abuse and they will take both kids. It might be worth a try.

I have no idea why these individuals think that will work for the long term!  How about stop (or at least slow down) eating so much unhealthy CRAP!  I'm glad your involved and helping him, because they won't be around forever with the way they are acting.  I don't know about his sister, in my experience the mom is probably beyond help unless you can get her into a nursing facility where they monitor her, and the sister might be a lost cause if she doesnt get out from under her mothers thumb.  You should direct him to r/raisedbynarcisists (my spelling on that is probably wrong, but you get the gist) and see if the stories there ring any bells (I bet they do).  You mentioned counseling so glad to hear he has you and another positive thing going for him, don't let him feel to blame for his sisters death, its probably the mom projecting her own feelings of guilt onto him which is maybe because she can't handle blaming herself?  I don't know just hypothesizing, anyway, good luck to you both and I'll watch for more stories from you!"
badpeoplestories,20c5z2,lollappaloosa,3,Thu Mar 13 23:50:33 2014 UTC,"Why is your husband/BF (?) enabling this behavior?  If he's in therapy, his therapist should be guiding him to unlearn his codependent behavior and replace it with healthy independent behavior; which would mean an end to the enabling. Not engaging is a good start (if hangs up on them) but the rest of the story is in present tense so he's still severely codependent and you are putting yourself in a toxic situation as well by having any contact with them, even second hand through CB."
badpeoplestories,20c5z2,lollappaloosa,3,Fri Mar 14 09:37:22 2014 UTC,"We're actually in the process of buying a house and moving three states away, at which point we'll be cutting off all contact. The therapy thing is fairly recent- it wasn't until we got engaged and he moved in with me that I realized how bad the situation was, and then I had to convince him to go to therapy. I am lucky enough to have grown up with a stable, supportive family, so I really am not in a position to explain the codependency and manipulation, but he's a good person who is doing his best to un-learn everything his mother has drilled into his head.    I thought about leaving him before, but I love him and he's taking the right steps, and I don't regret staying with him. Things are getting better."
badpeoplestories,20c5z2,thelordofcheese,1 point,Fri Mar 14 12:06:58 2014 UTC,"Good for you, and for him.  Hopefully he will continue his therapy when you move and be able to maintain low or no contact with them, it's the only way for him to heal and move on with his life.  If you're serious about having a life with him, I'd recommend you read up on codependency..it will give you a much better understanding of where he's coming from (which you won't understand without a basic knowledge of it) and you'll be able to identify codependent and enabling behaviors, which will allow you to help him move past them also.  Good luck, just keep yourself mentally healthy and maintain distance from his family.  :-)"

Then just pan fry the chicken. (3-5 minutes on both sides)   When that's done, take the chicken out of the pan but leave the pan on and simmering.   Use a dry white wine and pour 1 cup into the pan and let it settle. Then add  a few tablespoons of butter (it's for taste and thickness) one by one, letting each one melt before adding another.   Add some parsley, mix it around, pour over chicken and enjoy!   Also making the minute brand 5 minute rice with chicken stock instead of water is amazing. (Could use bouillon cubes.

His whole behaviour is about dominating and controlling you.   I understand that you're feeling like shit right now. I'm am sorry about that.   Even though he claims he wants to help you be more open and talkative, what he does is doing the opposite. When he forces you to chat with him, you're going to connect ""being chatty"" with ""it feels forced and horrible"" in your mind. This will definitely not help you to feel comfortable opening up to people in the future.  I hope you can make your mother see what an asshole her husband is. She's not completely delusional, I guess, since she sometimes stands up for you. It's time for a very, very serious talk with her...

He tells you not to act like a child, but how childish is it to go tell to your mother everytime you hurt his ""poor poor feelings"" even in the slightest?? He's preaching one thing and doing the opposite.  Ok, how am I going to finish this comment? Let's just go with this: Your step-douche is the biggest douche in the universe.

One can argue his horrible experiences over in Europe could have brought this on, or he's just a dick.  Oh, I know that. I already associate small talk with horrible, gut-wrenching pain that gives me nervous giggles. I'm fine to talk to people when I'm comfortable. If you know something I'm interested in, I can possibly show you how nice I am by not shutting up. But it only happens when I'm comfortable. My friends learned this. They're used to the random, long lapses of utter silence. Sometimes when I start to talk, I startle them. No one likes to be forced to do anything, but Step-Douche never seemed to learn that lesson.  I'd planned to have one on the five and a half hour drive back to our hometown, but that was cancelled. I'm considering maybe going back with my father when he comes to help us with some house details.   Oh, I've been depressed a while now, but that was a combination of things. I'm not used to being sad all the time. Angry, yes, but not sad. I've been crawling out of that hole though, and things are getting some better. Just one day at a time.  I really don't believe a damn word he says. I don't think I ever really did. I was always good at knowing when someone was spinning a yarn. He is a hypocrite. I don't see why he can't grasp the concept that everyone is different. He knew I was quiet, shy, and not a big talker since I was a little girl.

It also is not a means to end an argument if it is forced - it's like the difference between having sex when you want it, because you want it, and being forced to do it with someone you abhor. One brings closeness and all the fuzzy feelings afterwards, the other one makes you feel dirty and used.

badpeoplestories,1zmbb6,Fwoggie2,75,Wed Mar 5 19:36:03 2014 UTC,"Could be quite the email.  Dear extended family.    Ref my sisters email, and any phone calls she may have had with you, allow me to give my side of the story, because there may be a little  confusion or concern.  For some reason, over the years my sister seems to have taken a dislike to my fiance which disappointed me.  I recognise that there may be the odd eyebrow raised because he's not Irish, but you can't help who you fall in love with.  I know the birth of my son pre marriage raised more eyebrows; I agree that should really have waited until I was older but whilst I'm not perfect (A little self criticism looks good with this stuff) my fiance and son are the most perfect thing in the world, and make me so happy.  Princess Ham calling my fiance a Yank is something I dislike (I have said so more than once) yet she persists.  I will reluctantly tolerate that for the sake of peace, but I won't tolerate her calling my son a half breed or stating he has dirty blood (Insert email or a photo of a text message here).  (Son's name) really ought to enjoy better treatment from his Aunt.  It was for this and several other reasons that I decided to not invite her.  A wedding is meant to be the holy matrimony of husband and wife, a celebration of love and eternal happiness.  Viewpoints such as the ones I listed above aren't welcome on our wedding day.  Since I made the call I expected my sister to be naturally upset, but I was hoping for better from Princess Ham then ""I hope you die (see attachment), let alone ""I hope (son's name) dies"" (see attachment).  I don't want my sister at my wedding if she wants us all to die.  I want to keep her as part of our lives, but she is clearly making this hard.  There is no abuse.  I am in no danger.  You can call my fiance anytime to ask any questions, here's his email address and mobile number - you already have mine if you want to talk to me as well.  I love you all dearly as I know you love me - your concern in recent days for my wellbeing is deeply thoughtful, thank you.  I look forward to you coming to the wedding and us having a hell of a party afterwards - it will mean so much to the three of us to see you all there.  Orsomethinglikethat...."

badpeoplestories,1zmbb6,MangoBeat,25,Wed Mar 5 14:36:15 2014 UTC,"Don't do it as a straight up mass email, be mature and DO NOT sink to her level. I had to deal with similar issues from ex Fiance Dickatron's younger sister, and our response had basically been to SHOW the rest of our family that we were ok. We sent out a rather prettily photoshopped invite thing as a ""hey we're going to be visiting ____ celebrating our engagement, please please come and join us."" We made it a huge thing, saying we wanted to meet the extended family and blah blahblah. It meant that the famiy could come and see us in action and SEE that we weren't abused or starving. (The fact that I was covered in bruises was easily demonstrated by the photos of me at LARP events and from paintballing.) As tempting as it is to sink to her level and be sarky and snide, DON'T. It's only going to end in tears.  Options: Have a big skype announcement, skype or facetime all the family back home so you can VISIBLY show them you're fine. Also gives you the added bonus of being all smarmy and ""we just wanted to PERSONALLY invite you to the wedding, ask you if there were any special considerations we might have forgotten, or ideas for theme or colours or whatever""  Even if you totally ignore their ideas, they'll FEEL like they're part of the process and will be more likely to take your side, and thus more likely to come, or feel super bad that they can't come.  Don't even mention her bullshit allegations. Don't say anything unless they ask. If they ask, roll your eyes and dismiss it like it's absolutely nothing. Because it is NOTHING. Just respond by rolling your eyes and laughing like it's a hilarious joke. ""Oh yeah, I heard Hamsis had been saying that, she's either got entirely the wrong stick, or she's making it up, I'm just trying not to get involved.""  If your family are still going to believe her petty bullshit drama after that, (I'm going to come off really harsh here) then they're not people you're going to be wanting at your special day anyway.   So many hugs for you, and I hate that she's doing this to you."

Maybe this is a good time for her to finally have reprecussions. Just be to the point:  ""Look, everyone. My sister is, and always has been, a liar. She has spent many years putting me down and just being all-around unpleasant to be around. Recently, I came to the decision that I don't want that at my wedding. So, in her usual fashion, she has decide to lie and manipulate everone around her to get her way. Again.  Frankly, I'm done with that. I don't want that in my life, or in the life of my family. Obviously, this is a case of my word versus hers. But ask yourself, who is prone to histrionics, and who isn't? Who has gone out of their way to bother everyone and give them a ridiculous ultimatum? If you'd like to hear more, feel free to contact me. Please do not expect to ""fix"" this situation, as it's not some petty squabble. I've made my decision.

badpeoplestories,1zmbb6,MangoBeat,5,Wed Mar 5 13:37:24 2014 UTC,"I think her family will just try to convince her to mend fences, not really understanding the situation.

I had a friend in my life at one point who told me I had to choose between him and my boyfriend. The friend had some serious issues >.<  I told him that the person who makes me choose between two people I care about isn't worthy of my affection to begin with. It hurt to say at the time, but it has been such a truism throughout my lifetime that I have stuck to it.  Family should never act like this, ever. Anyone who claims to be family (by blood or choice) and asks for this type of ""decision"" should not be regarded as family of any type. They do not want what is best for you, they just want to create drama and have people support their ""cause."""
badpeoplestories,1zmbb6,pubbing,6,Wed Mar 5 14:30:15 2014 UTC,"Yeah, this is a HUGE red flag, to me. Who gives ultimatums like that, especially given the made-up context Ham gave. ""My sister is being beaten and I just want to help her. SO CHOOSE HER OR ME OR I'LL GET MAD"".  I have had some very, very serious situations within my family where a few people cannot stand to be around someone. I mean, decades long problems. And not one of them has made anyone choose. In fact, they go out of their way not to make it awkward. So, you'd think people would be suspicious of Ham immediately for that."

badpeoplestories,1zmbb6,OMGBADBEATZLOL,14,Wed Mar 5 14:56:22 2014 UTC,"Thanks, that is exactly my thoughts. If anyone comes they'll see a well cared for child who is spoiled, not a beaten down family. They are more than welcome to check :)"

DO NOT EVER give child protective services a way into your life.  They will look for and find something to get on your case about.  NEVER SIGN ANYTHING THEY GIVE YOU and never give them an in because you will be beholden to them forever.  My son was in NICU for a month after he was born.  We spent endless days and nights up in the hospital with him because we loved him and wanted to be with him.  One night one of the nurses got the hospital social worker and CPS on us because my wife fell asleep in the recliner with him at 3:00 in the morning, (he was sleeping in her arms).  They wanted us to get involved with them, sign a safety plan (thank god we didn't sign this), regular home visits, all that shit until they found a reason to take him from us.  It finally stopped when they asked us for drug tests.  Me and my wife initially thought there was no problem with this since we had nothing to hide but later decided enough was enough and said we weren't giving them anything or even talking to them anymore with out a court order to do so.  So in other words NEVER TALK TO CPS!!!"
badpeoplestories,1zmbb6,foxyshadis,14,Wed Mar 5 16:37:56 2014 UTC,"That is horrifying! The very thought that anyone could do that to you for something so little is....ugh.  I am so glad you guys decided to tell them off.  My first impulse would be compliance too because I feel like I have nothing to hide but my (very little) experience over the years dealing with government officials has taught me that the more compliant you are the more you can give them to entrap you, should they need to.  It is very sobering because you like to think they're there to help but that isn't always the case. :("
badpeoplestories,1zmbb6,sevenBegore,7,Wed Mar 5 17:11:13 2014 UTC,"yeah don't go reading into some of the messed up stories of what CPS across the states have done to tear apart lives. obviously they do good as well, but a lot of collateral damage."
badpeoplestories,1zmbb6,Fwoggie2,13,Wed Mar 5 20:45:39 2014 UTC,"See, you hear stories like this and then read about ones where CPS was notified repeatedly and should have intervened long ago. It's baffling. I guess it comes down to the individual agencies working these cases. Some people do their job well and are on top of things whereas others are just negligent or over-zealous."
badpeoplestories,1zmbb6,MangoBeat,3,Thu Mar 6 06:23:18 2014 UTC,I'd imagine it's easier to bully meek and compliant people used to doing the right thing than lifelong bullies whose only goal is always to screw you before you screw them.

You're lucky in that your sister is stupid enough to put all of this in writing, which will help a lot later.  I'm not a lawyer or anything, but I'm pretty darn sure her spreading these rumours about your husband is slander. I'd press charges if it were me, you don't want some dimwitted but well meaning relative talking to your son about his ""abusive father"" or anything stupid like that, and it will clear your hubby's name completely (handy if she pulls shit in the future).

If you feel like you need to do that then you could always give the bus ride a theme or something so that it makes you feel less paranoid.  :)  It's weird that so many people are listening to, her story doesn't even make sense.  ""HerbalGerbal is being abused! She asked me for help and to take Nephew away because she's scared. Now I'm not invited to the wedding!"" <tear>  So, she's saying that you reached out for help, she did nothing and didn't take Nephew/tell the authorities/recruit family assistance until now because... she doesn't get to come to the wedding? So, abused sister < wedding appearance. Even her lies make her seem selfish.  Sigh. I'm sorry you have to put up with her, OP. She's so tedious."

Sister promises not to, mum pretends to believe her, and agrees to try to persuade you.  Phase two: you make sure that the wedding is going to occur in a location that can be easily controlled, e.g. fifth floor of a hotel, only one or two ways in or out, and security guards available. Staff are shown pictures of sister, told that she's insanely jealous and likely to be violent, and that she must, at all costs, be kept off the premises. Be persuaded by mum that sister will behave, allow her to join the wedding party.  Phase three: wedding day. Mum picks up sister, drives to far off location, meets future husband there. Takes keys, gets out of her car, gets in future husband's car, they drive off. No point trying to get sister out of the car, just do it fast enough that she can't react.  Phase four: Wedding. If sister manages to turn up somehow, cops are called. Glorious victory."

I read your wedding dress story and was really rooting for you, so I'm glad to hear you've decided to deal with her before rather than during the wedding.  If you haven't made a decision yet, I would encourage you to not mass email everyone in reply. If you shoot back just like she has, people will write it off as a bitch fight with neither of you in the right. If people are concerned about your safety, then it's completely fair to show them that you're fine and dandy together.  But be careful how much you share of her shenanigans. Drama llamas keep coming back if you continue to feed them nuts, and you'll come off as a lot more mature than her if you simply address the concerns, state that sister is behaving this way because of personal family issues, and not press it.  Even if it does feel good to let it all out to anyone, families are weird, and it could backfire horribly."

She let everyone smoke and drink and fun was had by all, but when ever there was a BIG party, I never drank, I liked just being stoned in the corner with my observations lol, plus, I sucked at drinking and would usually end up taking clothes off if I got drunk lmao.  I NEEDED to be the sober only stoned one at the party, because when the cops got called (which they always did for some reason) Mom would take off and leave me with a house full of drunk, usually sobbing teenagers leaving me to face the cops alone...

The vast majority of ppl with the disorder live normal lives. Psychopathy/sociopathy simply means the person has no emotional response to stimuli. A person affected by the disorder is always stuck in the emotional equivalent of neutral.  Nothing in this story point to sociopathy Nor are you a trained medical professional. You do not have the right to apply that label to anyone.

Don't worry about getting ""exact change"" so to speak. Some encounters he will benefit more and some you will be up. If you are consistently and over the long term getting the short end of the stick, then reconsider how good a friend he is.   It might also help to speak to a therapist.

Can a bunch of random people on the internet who don't know the first thing about you help you to do it? Probably not.    Should you change?  Well, you sound like a bit of a douchebag.  And this is when you describe your actions.  It might be even worse from other peoples' perspective...it usually is.  It doesn't sound like you are the second coming of Hitler, but your life will probably be a lot happier if you can figure out how to become a better person."

badpeoplestories,1z9y0b,afcagroo,2,Mon Mar 3 23:31:53 2014 UTC,"My great grandfather was like this, from what I hear. He was a boiler man at the local hospital, and my father would go to visit him after school.  During the visit, my dad would try to make small talk, and ask questions about what my great grandfather did. ""What's that valve do?"", things like that. The answer was ""Why do you need to know?!""  You see, my great grandfather came from the mindset that if you had information, you kept it and made money off it. If you knew how to operate a boiler, you did it in secret and shared it with no one lest someone else take your job.  This actually was useful information he hoarded, but the mindset still drove a wedge between him and his family. If you don't find a way to let go of insignificant information like how to get free ice cream, then you'll find your friends spending less time with you."

You know how to share but you never had to so you don't like to. I mean no one REALLY likes to share very much... Sure, warm fuzzies and all that but if the other person has something of their own and you don't have to share you'd be arguably happier than if you had to split whatever you had in half. Raw human nature. I don't know how you can fix it but I once knew someone who was like this; she was not big on sharing in the least, on the same level as you. That's okay, you aren't obligated to share everything, it often makes you a 'nicer' person, even a push over.... For starters I'd talk to your friend about the problem. Make sure he understands that for some reason it's an issue for you and he's likely to be more careful about what he asks of you."

badpeoplestories,1z5ci9,masterpooper,4,Sat Mar 1 01:37:58 2014 UTC,"Herm, should've been clearer with that.  If it's not TMI, I will say that while my uterus can indeed house a baby, I have a birth disorder (affecting my chest cavity and upper extremities) that would make pregnancy extremely dangerous for me and the little fetus blob.  If you're the type that likes to learn about other's gross deformities (or a medical information sponge) I'd be delighted to regale you with the details.  But LSS, when I say 'can't' get preggers, I don't mean 'incapable' of gettin' preggers.  I mean ""TAisokay, if you get preggers you will need hospitalization and you are a poor-ass motherfucker with shitty health coverage, so you 'can't' get pregnant"".  I've known since a very young age, so it's always been whatever.  But this is part of the reason it was so goddamn stressful when I thought I was pregnant.  It wasn't just that I might have an unwanted babeh (because I do love little babehs), but I was in legit danger from that unwanted fetus-blob."

badpeoplestories,1z5ci9,trouble_tree,1 point,Sat Mar 1 12:52:47 2014 UTC,"There is a ""window period"" of time between the initial infection and when HIV can be detected by a test. These days I think the period isn't more than a month, but I don't know when the LL drama occurred or what sort of information OP read/was given about it. Three months sounds a bit lengthy.  So test results can be returned very quickly, but HIV may not be detectable for several weeks after infection."
badpeoplestories,1z59n7,indigo-amaryllis,15,Fri Feb 28 02:47:07 2014 UTC,I don't understand why you should hug him.  Ever.  He seems like he is grooming you.  You need to move back with your dad.
badpeoplestories,1z59n7,drlala,10,Fri Feb 28 07:15:43 2014 UTC,I've been considering. A lot.
badpeoplestories,1z59n7,penguin_sweater,18,Fri Feb 28 08:51:18 2014 UTC,"Please do it.  This man is incredibly creepy and it's making me uncomfortable just reading it.  It's not just the hugging either (which shouldn't be happening at all if you're uncomfortable, regardless of your relationship), but the comments on your weight/body, the making you subservient and attempting to break your spirit, and stuff like this:   Step-Douche looked past Mother at me. ""Come here! We're going to the bedroom to talk about this in private!"" He snapped. I shook my head, ""Get out here!""   Why does he need to speak to you in private?  Why doesn't he want your mother to hear?  What is he planning to say/do to you that he can't say/do in front of her?  This is scary.    On a slightly different note (one that I'm sure will be really unpopular), why is your mother letting him treat you like this?  I know it's her husband, but come on, there is a point where you have to do what's best for your child (I don't mean over petty things, but feeling safe in your own home is kind of a big deal).  Also, what does your Dad think?  EDIT:  I'm sorry to harp on, but this bit is a bit weird to me as well:   Mother stopped us and said that we should apologize to each other, hug, and say we loved each other.   Unless you're five, hugging really shouldn't be involved or even really suggested.  That might just be me though, so I apologise if this is normal where you're from."
badpeoplestories,1z59n7,penguin_sweater,7,Fri Feb 28 13:59:24 2014 UTC,"I think, even if she was 5, that hugging should never be forced. If a child doesn't feel comfortable hugging me, then I will not force it. I think it teaches the child that it's okay for others to disrespect their personal boundaries. I know a lot of parents that force their kids to hug, but I always say it's okay b/c I don't take it personally. I always offer a high-five instead and I've never had a kid turn me down on that lol"
badpeoplestories,1z59n7,penguin_sweater,4,Fri Feb 28 16:23:14 2014 UTC,"I agree completely!  I actually meant that, you know, when little kids fight with their siblings (their approximate age) they're often told to hug and make up, or so I've seen.  Totally though.  My mum drilled into my siblings and I that no one was ever allowed to make us feel uncomfortable, and that she would stop it if they did (and boy did she).  Even basic stuff, like if an adult other than our parents wanted us to hold their hand, hug, etc. That 5' of pure instinct would make sure it was known that nothing came before her kids, hahaha. That's probably why I'm really struggling to understand OPs mum in all of this, but then again, maybe mine was just super special or something."
badpeoplestories,1z59n7,penguin_sweater,5,Fri Feb 28 16:31:52 2014 UTC,"I think it's a super old school way of thinking. Older adults see it as disrespecting elders, but I just see it as the kid expressing control over their personal space. My godson will hug me most days, but sometimes he won't and I always say it's okay and get a high five instead. His mom was mortified the first time he wouldn't hug me, but I'm thinking he hasn't seen me in two months why would he want to hug some random lady godmother or not.  My parents def enforced hugging, and I think that is why I am so adamant about not forcing it lol"
badpeoplestories,1z59n7,Iforgettingmyaccount,4,Fri Feb 28 16:56:37 2014 UTC,"Thank goodness you've broken the cycle =)  I think parents also tend to forget that just because they're friends with/love/trust someone doesn't necessarily mean that their children automatically do, especially with the younger ones.  I try to make a point of introducing myself to kids when I meet them, because they are they're own people.  Back on topic though, OP must be between 15 and 20 (I have no idea about schooling ages in the US) so it's just so weird that hugging is still enforced, that way of thinking aside.  It reminds me of those creepy older guys who try to get kids/teens to sit on their lap."
badpeoplestories,1z59n7,penguin_sweater,3,Fri Feb 28 17:02:21 2014 UTC,"I'm 20. I've not specified that. I need to.  The hugging thing is old school. I'm from the south. Like I said in an upper post, it's customary. When I was little, I tended to hide behind my parents' legs depending on if I remembered the person. Hugging was not enforced for family members I just met. But, again, the hugging is seen as a means to end an argument among family. It shows 'okay, I'm done fighting"". I've really only expressed once that I didn't want the hug which was after the first argument. Step-Douche became annoyed and started the argument over. He also pointed out that I disrespected him and didn't love him because he wasn't my father. I felt like saying ""duh, dumbass"" but held my tongue. I would never consider him a father, a replacement for a father, or anything of the like."
badpeoplestories,1z59n7,penguin_sweater,2,Fri Feb 28 22:09:06 2014 UTC,"You can't love someone until you know them. He's a bit of a twat if he expects everything to be instantaneous /:  I mentioned earlier that maybe you can substitute the hug for a handshake? I'm from Australia, and that's kind of the norm over here (fight, then make up and shake hands). You might be able to say that it makes you feel like more of an adult and that you think it shows more respect or something.  I know it may just be a culture difference, but I find it really disconcerting that a 20 year old is forced to hug anyone- family or not."

badpeoplestories,1z59n7,drlala,1 point,Fri Feb 28 17:18:17 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I was getting one of those 'many wives' fantasy vibes from him. To not help out with anything, especially when moving, because ""You two need to do it"" is really weird.  Especially with how he treats OP and what he demands off her.  I mean, asking how each others days are is fine, but it sounds like he's expecting from her what her mother gives him."
badpeoplestories,1z59n7,beautifulbrandii,3,Fri Feb 28 17:38:11 2014 UTC,"He believes everyone should fit to his specifications. He's rude to everyone, even people he calls his friends. Then he says that he's just joking.  I think the reason he wanted to speak to me alone was that way Mother couldn't interject and he could just yell and yell and yell.   It was scary just standing there listening to it all.   I don't know why she lets it go. She agrees with some of it, that I do need to get out of my shell, but she also understands how hard it is for me and lets me have my space and time. Ah, that's the wonderful thing. My dad doesn't know. I'm not allowed to tell him. Because if I do, well, I don't want my daddy to go to prison. He will be coming in a few days or a week to help Mom with some work. I may go back with him, depending.  It's normal. I see your point, but where I'm from, family is a big thing. Even if it is step-family we can't stand."
badpeoplestories,1z59n7,franklintheknot,3,Fri Feb 28 22:02:52 2014 UTC,"It's still really worrying that he wants to do that in private though, it's not right. Things are even worse if you can't tell your Dad! The best thing about Dads is that they're always there for you :) he might be just the person to give you some solid advice and help you out.  Please don't take it the wrong way when I say this, but given your age, he might have a tad more wisdom in dealing with the jerks of the world :). You don't have to tell him absolutely everything, but I think it would be a good idea to let him in on a few of the things that have happened, just for advice if nothing else.  I can see why it's normal if it's a cultural thing, but please don't let tradition or culture make you feel uncomfortable. You are just as entitled to your personal space and preferences as anyone else. Maybe you could try substituting it with a handshake (I'm from Australia and that's generally what we do. Have a fight/argument over where you parked your koala? Shake hands afterward), that way you're still making up, but you'd feel more comfortable."

badpeoplestories,1yyds3,Ro-chan,1 point,Wed Feb 26 20:34:06 2014 UTC,"Well, ""meh"" with the body language of pushing past somebody.  Is it so hard to smile and say, ""Let me put my things away and I'll be with you in a few minutes""?  I understand the frustration of poor social skills, in high school I was just about as outcast and introverted as they come. With that said, even if a complete stranger asked me a question, my reaction would not be to say ""meh"" and turn away from them. Family members (step-members they may be) deserve at least that much consideration.  Now I don't know the history of OP and SD; maybe she had good reason to think he was insincere, or that he was trying to pick a fight. His reaction after the fact was certainly over-the-top."

We just don't talk much in my house, I guess that's why 'meh' is seen as a fine response even with the walking away. (only one who would be offended unless they were already upset is my uncle).  Well, they'd lived together for a few months up until that point, so I imagine it wasn't an unheard of response from OP. It's weird that it only became a problem right then, unless he just never said anything before? IDK, I have talked to SD and he's... weird.  This is where it all started, from what I gather.

You could have just said ""it was good, thanks"" or ""it was ok but I was nervous""  instead of ""meh"". It comes across as very rude.   You need to be able to make basic polite conversation with people to function in life. This doesn't mean you have to become the life and soul of the party or tell people your life story, you just need to show that you are listening to the person and acknowledge their question. It is an important life skill that everyone needs to learn.  I'm an introvert, I get it, but this really is a must and doesn't take much effort, most questions can be answered with one sentence."

That's fine if he can do that, people think he's a dick when he does that, but I'm content to say hello when eye contact is made and introduce myself politely when the time comes."
badpeoplestories,1yyds3,DemonKat33,2,Wed Feb 26 20:33:51 2014 UTC,"Yeah, asking you to ""see a stranger, walk right up to them, tell them my name, and just talk their ear off. "" is way too much for him to expect if that's not your personality. I for one wouldn't be able to do that.   If he's trying to make you do that he's clueless and not very empathetic to your feelings. I'd tell him to mind his own damn business if it was me.  I just try to pass myself and be approachable and friendly when someone talks to me.  Protip: If you don't want to go into detail when someone asks a question answer it briefly and move the focus off you by  asking them something similar to what they asked you.   Eg. Stepdouche: How was college? You: It was ok thanks....its hard to say yet....I'm still getting used to things. How was your day?  People care more about you acknowledging their question than they do about what you actually say and extroverts love talking about themselves."
badpeoplestories,1yyds3,DemonKat33,1 point,Thu Feb 27 17:11:23 2014 UTC,"It's far from my personality. When i'm forced into a conversation like that, I begin to get jittery and stutter.  That's the thing. He's incapable of minding his own business. He wants to get into everything about someone, and if he doesn't like things about their personality, he flat out says it and then tells them how they need to change and that they need to do it now. He has one friend, the poor guy has OCD so bad that before we leave his house, he's on his knees scrubbing the floor from footprints. Step-Douche has yelled at him, like he does me, that he needs to just stop this. That it's stupid. This man has had this problem since he was young. OCD is hard to deal with and hard to handle. But it's something Step-Douche doesn't like, so it has to go.  I can fake it when it's necessary. Say I'm in a class or at a job. I can hold a mask just long enough, but once I'm out, it cracks and I'm downing water like a dehydrated man in a desert.   See, with step-douche, you have to go into detail because if you start talking to him about something, he won't let you change subject for long. Once he's done, he goes right back, or he gets mad and snaps at you not to change the subject."
badpeoplestories,1yyds3,DemonKat33,2,Thu Feb 27 22:15:12 2014 UTC,"Your mileage may greatly vary. In my neck of the woods, meh is more or less accepted as a sign of indifference and isn't necessarily seen as being rude, unless it has a specific tone behind it. Getting a meh as a response to a basic day to day question like that isn't really rude, its basically the equivalent of saying ""same old,"" or the like. I've heard it used fairly often at work, hell, I've even had my dad use it once or twice.  OP might have had a certain ""tone"" about them since they were stressed, but I don't think step douche really had a valid point. The other big thing is talking with family and talking with a boss or a teacher is very different. With friends and family, you can use more of a relaxed language. Like, if OP had responded, ""Oh hey dude, I had a killer day,"" nobody would be jumping down their throat about how they need to learn how to properly communicate if they want to have a job/succeed in the real world or whatever."

badpeoplestories,1yyds3,robbinthehoodz,1 point,Wed Feb 26 04:40:02 2014 UTC,"Your step douche sounds exactly like my step douche. I moved out when I was 17 just so I wouldn't have to deal with him anymore. My mom always sided with him. She still does. Whenever I go to visit now and I have to interact with him it's always super forced and fake. It's really good practice though, for interacting with people at work that I can't stand without letting them know I can't stand them."
badpeoplestories,1yyds3,Called_Fox,3,Wed Feb 26 14:41:18 2014 UTC,"I'd never really realized how bad this would be until the move. I've been considering going back home, but my mom's not well. She at least tries to see both sides, though I don't always like that... I mostly just try to avoid him, but that doesn't work either. He gets mad at something I say to him, he gets mad if I say nothing to him."
badpeoplestories,1yyds3,robbinthehoodz,2,Wed Feb 26 17:01:21 2014 UTC,"I know how you feel.  It got to the point where I would say to him ""What would you like me to say? Because there is nothing that I say that will keep you from getting angry.""  Yes, that usually made him angry, but it was usually worth it.  Later on in college, when I was taking my advanced mathematics class (complex analysis for the win) I would explain obscure proofs to him in detail when he asked about my day.  So worth it to see his eyes glaze over."
badpeoplestories,1yyds3,NexVesica,3,Wed Feb 26 19:39:22 2014 UTC,"I had that happen yesterday and a few months back. He was flabbergasted. I apologized, he didn't care, I tried to explain, he wouldn't listen.  He makes me explain everything. I wish he would just leave me alone. I don't like talking about my day, and I don't see how being able to do small talk at a job is important. It can help build trust and all that, but hey, so can being good at your job and when they ask for help, be nice."

badpeoplestories,1yveuw,iknowbadpeopletoo,43,Tue Feb 25 06:31:35 2014 UTC,"CONTINUATION  However, she made big dramatic posts on Facebook about how some girl in-game had made her hospitalize herself, that she’d completely destroyed Alpha Nerd Girl’s mental state. She soaked up the sympathy, saying things were better now, but she had to get out now in order to save herself. A former fuck buddy of hers had also said something similar – talking to me might cause “someone else to die,” a reference her supposed suicide attempt. Not being well, I interpreted it as my existence caused people to want to die, so the best thing I could do was take myself out. After telling me this, she went to my husband for sympathy, demanding he kick me from his guild, take her side, and kick me to the curb while she was treated.  She said to him outright she didn’t give a fuck if I was suicidal and in a place where I could try to do it (home alone all the time..), she needed him more.  Excuse me? You’re in Canada, and he’s my husband. He also knows all of what was said to me, because everything was logged through an add-on and Facebook.  I freaked out.. The school counselor told me I had to get help the next day through their psychiatric services or the on-call counselor was calling an ambulance. I opted out of hospitalization. After four failed attempts at taking an antidepressant, I’m on one that does work.  I hope she’s doing better now. I really do. Now that I’m back, I truly believe she was ill and needed help herself.  This was a mess, but I feel so much better having it “out there.” Thanks bps. <3"
badpeoplestories,1yveuw,Lynoctis,6,Tue Feb 25 06:31:49 2014 UTC,"I have one question. Was she possibly playing a hunter? (You can PM me if you don't want to publicly expose that info). Seriously. I dealt with someone extremely and scarily similar in my guild. She posted tit pics on our guild website, expected loot because she was a girl who hit on all the guys in the guild (and threw fits when she didn't get her way), was emotionally unstable, and had fits of childishness (ignoring those who tried to call her out on her bullshit and constructively criticize her raiding skills).  She sent me a hateful message on facebook when we finally did get rid of her. She also lived in Canada. Bitch was cray."
badpeoplestories,1yveuw,godlessgamergirl,15,Wed Mar 5 14:53:17 2014 UTC,I'm confused as to why your husband was mad at you and not her.  Why didn't he back you up?
badpeoplestories,1yveuw,Fwoggie2,12,Tue Feb 25 15:59:04 2014 UTC,"I'm confused about this too (I'm a guy - I would back my wife up 100%).  Or maybe he'd hit rock bottom in his worry re how sick (psychiatrically wise) you were, and tried the nuclear approach after all other ideas hadn't had an effect.  If I were you, I wouldn't answer that IKBPT.  As for WoW, I used to hit IRC 17 (holy shit) years ago - it was an early chat room software thing.  I was at Uni then.  It nearly cost me my degree, so engrossed I got in it.  I snapped out of it just in time and rejoined the real world after realising I had less than 5 friends within 200 miles of me despite being at Uni.  Then I had to sort out an ex (who got into it just as I got out of it, my fault for introducing her to it) - she had a guy who was in love with her, then she got real and said no, then he set up a new account as his own brother and said the guy had drunk a litre of whisky and driven off a cliff in Tel Aviv (he hadn't, it was all a lie).  She went seriously bulimic, got admitted to Psychiatric hospital for a few weeks.  Anyway, where I'm going with this IRC, is to perhaps consider whether WoW (for you) is worth it, all that angst.  It's supposed to just be a game.  If it makes your life better in some way, if there's a value add to it, keep going with it.  If it's doesn't make you happy more than 50% of the time, or you're worried about how much time you do it, maybe reduce it or stop altogether.   But it's your life not mine.  I hope it works out :)  PS Never give up on the meds even if you feel back to normal.  Ppl don't realise that mental illness affects 1 in 3 adults."

badpeoplestories,1yveuw,Bonfire_,16,Tue Feb 25 19:25:31 2014 UTC,"I'm so sorry that happened to you, and I'm so sorry about your father's death. Every woman who has ever played WoW knows about ""that girl"", and feels your pain, I am sure. I sure as hell knew exactly what you were talking about the second you wrote ""that girl"", and I cringed. I hope you're in a better place now, and that you know you are special, unique, and wonderful - don't ever let anyone else get you down. Something about WoW and raiding makes the hurts from that game fester a little more, the team environment of a raid can mean when drama happens it backfires on everyone. I hope this hasn't ruined WoW for you, and I am sending lots of internet hugs your way.   Also, what the fuck, your hubby was the guild leader and didn't kick that bitch weeks prior? To steal words from fatpeoplestories, he needs to alpha up."
badpeoplestories,1yveuw,juel1979,8,Tue Feb 25 07:27:02 2014 UTC,Seriously. I'm a bit disappointed in husband here. He was seeing both sides of things and in a leadership position to fix it and let both the antagonist and his wife bail instead of kicking that girl out? I hope he's turned things around.
badpeoplestories,1yveuw,AgentKittyfeets,2,Tue Feb 25 17:25:20 2014 UTC,"Yep. ""that girl"" ruins a lot of fun by people who just want to enjoy the game, no matter the gender. I think it hurts more due to us thinking everyone might 'get' us because we have this common love for the game? Just my thoughts, but then there's 'that girl' who uses it as a way to punch up her ego and crush other girls because of that BS 'I'm not like OTHER GIRLS' mentality we get shoved down our throats.  To the OP: I'm so sorry you had to go through all that, and I am glad you're in a better place now."

I was always top dps (and I hated if someone out-did me). But I was always much better at healing, and hated it, because it was so stereotypical!!! Sigh.   Anyway, people like that bitch are one of the reasons I left WoW. It's like a fairyland of selfish, immature psychopaths just waiting for someone to victimize."

I was raiding ICC when I got a phone call from my best friend's mom that my best friend passed away a while back. Took a 14 month break from the game after that, and I still can't enjoy the game like I used to. I just felt like I wasted so much time playing WoW that I could have spent with him, you know?

badpeoplestories,1ylb5k,emag,10,Sat Feb 22 09:10:00 2014 UTC,I am a subscriber to FPS and I did consider posting there but there was absolutely no fat logic with Bear. He was just a bad person. I will see how I could go about approaching it. Could be fun! I have not even included everything in these four parts. Just the stories that really stick in my mind. Might be some decent material still to be had.
badpeoplestories,1ylb5k,NexVesica,5,Sat Feb 22 11:41:46 2014 UTC,"I mentioned it in the previous part as well, but it doesn't sound like there's a whole lot of material for an FPS. Like you said, doesn't seem like there's really any fat logic, just bad person logic. At best, you might be able to stretch out the first paragraph or two of this into a single FPS post, but eh, it'd come off as pretty generic."
badpeoplestories,1ykv3k,Lightfairy,12,Fri Feb 21 23:30:46 2014 UTC,....I would have done it anyway.
badpeoplestories,1ykv3k,sweetpoison138,6,Sat Feb 22 00:56:25 2014 UTC,"I, in all honesty, did consider it. But he was gone and he has not caused trouble again so I let it slide. I will however do a little add on to this story some time today. There are a couple of things I forgot to add. And yes, one of them is kind of a form of revenge after he left but only because of his stupidity and and the fact that he lied. Keep an eye out for it as I think you will like it."
badpeoplestories,1ykv3k,SpHornet,4,Sat Feb 22 01:06:56 2014 UTC,once you do it you lose your leverage
badpeoplestories,1ykv3k,theamazingroberto,3,Sat Feb 22 02:54:19 2014 UTC,That is true. He is still in one scene that I move in in my city. In fact I am attending an event next weekend and he will probably be there. He was last year! I like to keep something up my sleeve just in case it is ever needed. Funny thing is he still makes up fake profiles and has tried to add me on facebook several times. He is friends with some of my friends and as soon as I see one of his profiles I block it so I can't see anything he posts. I just don't want to know anything about him.
badpeoplestories,1ykv3k,NotACatfish,4,Sat Feb 22 11:46:25 2014 UTC,He asked why I had complained to facebook about the copy profile he had set up of me   the fact that he actually asked you this tells me he either has the biggest pair of balls known to modern science or he is a sociopath.
badpeoplestories,1ykv3k,emag,4,Sat Feb 22 13:34:14 2014 UTC,"The guy was dumb and extremely narcissistic. Traits that I did not really discover till late in our cohabitation. He spent most of his time in his room playing on his computer. Prior to that he was actually at work and with 1.5 hours travel each way, each day, I did not see much of him. He has tried to add me on facebook several, through several profiles over the last three years. As if??!!!"

I'm so sorry for you. <3 I've been burned through being nice, too -- but at least you have the good sense to put your foot down!  This bit is a little confusing, though:   it is MY home and that Bear is my guest   Are you in the rented flat or your father's house at this point? If he's paying rent then it's both of y'all's. :)"
badpeoplestories,1yj6mv,moxiered,7,Fri Feb 21 14:47:43 2014 UTC,"We were in a rented villa at this point and everything was in my name. He had an appalling credit/work/rental/everything history that he could not get anything in his name. If one is going to be technical, then legally I did the wrong thing by giving him an hour to exit the premises but when you read the final chapter you will see I did the right thing. I knew that he had no idea of his legal rights and took advantage of that fact."
badpeoplestories,1yj6mv,La_Fee_Verte,2,Fri Feb 21 22:59:04 2014 UTC,final chapter coming? I really hope that this is the chapter when he leaves your house and your life FOREVER.
badpeoplestories,1yj18q,Lightfairy,2,Fri Feb 21 11:32:59 2014 UTC,People that lie to you when they are fully aware of what you're doing for them are one of the worst kinds of people.

badpeoplestories,1ygazm,jameson71,6,Thu Feb 20 21:44:27 2014 UTC,Yup.  89% positive is really good.  Don't let the fakedowns get you down!
badpeoplestories,1ygazm,Tray2daC,3,Thu Feb 20 22:25:39 2014 UTC,Was this a recent occurrence or long ago?

badpeoplestories,1ygazm,dorf_physics,10,Fri Feb 21 02:11:40 2014 UTC,"Don't get so hung up on the upvotes/downvotes. You got your story out, in a kind of anonymous way. That had to be cathartic for you. If people don't like your post, fuck em. You still got to get your story out and that's what's important.  Don't concentrate so much on your karma count."
badpeoplestories,1ygazm,tombradyrulz,3,Thu Feb 20 21:49:02 2014 UTC,"You're right, I got really emotional writing it out and felt better. Still a but emotional and got mad over a couple down votes haha. I'm over it now. You people sure are nice."
badpeoplestories,1ygazm,BurgerThyme,2,Thu Feb 20 21:54:14 2014 UTC,"I personally enjoyed your story. She sounds like an outright cunt. But putting anything out for public consumption leaves you open to other people's options. And not everybody is going to agree that it was a good story.  Like I said, if they don't like it - fuck 'em. You got what you needed. But don't discount everyone on reddit due to a few opinions.  Hope that you're doing better now that you're away from that anal annex."
badpeoplestories,1ygt1h,KhemikalReaction,22,Thu Feb 20 19:40:17 2014 UTC,That is literally a guide to an abusive relationship scenario.  I'm so sorry you went through that.  You deserve real love!  I hope things are going better now :)
badpeoplestories,1ygt1h,MidnightDemon,15,Thu Feb 20 21:50:26 2014 UTC,They are.  I took another 2 years after that one and met my current boyfriend.  It took me an embarrassingly long time to figure out he wasn't going to be the same way but he really is great.
badpeoplestories,1ygt1h,alliOops,10,Thu Feb 20 21:57:41 2014 UTC,"as /u/Bouncingdiddy said, this does not make you a bad person. this was payback for him being a very nasty demeaning narcissistic bastard.  have no regrets, live a happy life :) that will be an even better payback!"
badpeoplestories,1ygt1h,Bouncingdiddy,13,Fri Feb 21 11:57:16 2014 UTC,"Finally I broke up with him. I'd like to say I was the bigger man....so to speak, but I remembered his email password and I went in and forwarded his nasty cybering emails from other girls to everybody on his contact list. So....I'm not a good person either.   No, there is nothing wrong with doing this, it doesn't make you a bad person. This narrative shows Narcissism personified. There is nothing wrong with you doing this, motherfucker deserved this and much more. You just made a very important PSA for any other girls he was talking to."
badpeoplestories,1ygt1h,1_k3y-u,3,Fri Feb 21 01:21:30 2014 UTC,You're more patient and a better person than I am. Glad you got rid of him!
badpeoplestories,1ygt1h,ludovician,3,Thu Feb 20 23:07:27 2014 UTC,"we did not have sex one time because he couldn't get an erection to me  he would jerk off 10 or 20 times a day   Honey, I don't think it was you. Any guy jerking off that often is going to have trouble getting it up when it counts."
badpeoplestories,1ygt1h,ludovician,4,Thu Feb 27 12:23:56 2014 UTC,I don't think it was either...but at the time it certainly was awful.
badpeoplestories,1ygt1h,xRoseable,2,Thu Feb 27 14:09:37 2014 UTC,Glad you're out of there and moving on.
badpeoplestories,1ygt1h,Melaidie,3,Thu Feb 27 15:03:52 2014 UTC,he would jerk off 10 or 20 times a day   ...wut.
badpeoplestories,1ygt1h,Melaidie,5,Fri Feb 21 22:52:06 2014 UTC,Yeah..... until it bled.... I imagined it would bleed well before 10 but he said that was about the average
badpeoplestories,1ygt1h,gfycat-bot,5,Sat Feb 22 00:36:19 2014 UTC,"Bled?! Clearly doing it wrong, holy hell. What kind of friction burn do you gotta have to bleed from masturbation? Seriously, I'm glad you got out of there okay. It can be tough when people treat you like shit so much that you start to believe it. Trust me, you're a good person. I would have done much worse than sending an email around."
badpeoplestories,1ygt1h,xRoseable,4,Sun Feb 23 14:10:08 2014 UTC,You know how to start a fire with sticks?  One way had to tie a string around the upright stock and rotate it quickly back and forth.  Like that....with a towel around it.  I'm surprised it took more than a couple of times to start bleeding.
badpeoplestories,1ygt1h,captainjuggy,6,Sun Feb 23 14:42:41 2014 UTC,"The only explanation I can think of is that he's a masochist. I cringed so hard reading that first sentence, and I don't even have a penis."
badpeoplestories,1ygt1h,captainjuggy,5,Sun Feb 23 14:50:18 2014 UTC,I figured it was because of the amount and intensity that he had to do more and more to feel it.  That's another thing I struggled with though...being sex positive after that.  I assumed any guy that jerked off was going to get out of control with it and if I dated them they would not want anything to do with me.

But I do have an uncanny knack of being an outright bitch if the situation calls for it. I try to use my powers for good.  But that doesn't stop someone from feeling victimized after they are told off for their own shit behavior and concoct a story wherein they are the victor.
badpeoplestories,1ye3d5,Tray2daC,2,Wed Feb 26 12:38:39 2014 UTC,"Oh, well in that case you shouldn't feel alarmed at all if you find a story about yourself! If someone's being a douche, call them out on that shit behavior. Most adults are still very much children in the regard that if they're not corrected (in the appropriate setting, mind you) they won't learn what is acceptable and what isn't.

Because while Eye's is an asshole douchebro, he's an attractive and charismatic douchebro. Like, 7/10. 9/10 if he never opened his mouth.

badpeoplestories,1y7vd7,chesZilla,140,Tue Feb 18 05:50:17 2014 UTC,"Cont in comments because long:  I was broken. My friends urged me to stay until I felt myself again. And so I extended my flight (again) until the end of October. Maow and Bear are my saviours. I owe them so much. They literally just saved my ass, took me in when I was a broken wreck, and made me a part of the family.  I stayed a month, and we had shenanigans and hijinks and I think I was doing pretty well. Ex-a-tron went sobbing to Landlady as she was my best friend, asking her to intercede on his behalf that he was distraught because he'd destroyed the only good thing to ever happen to him. She arranged for us to meet in London overnight, and we had a long talk where I said it felt like he wasn't even fighting for the relationship that he was using Landlady to do so, and that I was fed up with being the only person putting any effort in. He said he didn't know how.  We left London with the arrangement that we weren't together, but he would never speak to Scheming McCuntyfuck ever again, and we would work on being friends again until our appeal result came through and we would reassess our relationship then.  We were awkwardly friends again, with only the odd report of Scheming McPlottybitch moaning about what a spiteful cow I was, so manipulive and such a shame I wouldn't let Ex-a-tron have a ""real life"" (read as: with her). To his credit, either Ex-a-tron really had blocked her or he'd gotten better at hiding their interactions, I never saw them talking.  But he still refused to believe me when I said she was still spreading shit, and that she made me intensely uncomfortable. We kept like this until just after Thanksgiving when my family came to visit me and with exellent timing I received the UKBA appeal result. We had been refused again. Ex-a-tron and I had a LOOOOOOOONG talk about our relationship. We talked about our options, him moving to the USA (scary and difficult for him, but he was ok with me up and moving to the USA and leaving my friends behind for our relationship because ""I was used to that kind of thing""), the possibility of me going into the diplomatic core and us travelling the world for a few years, even living with my parents and working in the embassy or with medical aid programmes in Colombia. At the point he sounded like he was about to ask we be in an open relationship, I cut him off at the pass saying that I was afraid of continuing distance like this because we had ""no end in sight"" and he cracked after not even 7 months, what was to say he didn't just cheat again and again. This was not the answer he wanted. He had expected me to just bend over and let him fuck anyone he wanted while continuing to be engaged. I put my foot down and said no. And so it was done.  I started seeing Hot Miller, and things started going great. I found out through the gossip train that Ex-a-tron had started shagging Scheming McPlottyfuck again almost as soon as I had got on the plane back to the USA. He had asked her to be his girlfriend on NYE (I didn't find this out till later) and she'd rejected him because ""he wasn't her type"" and started moaning to some of my mutual friends that it was because she had found out he was cheating on her.   SO HE WAS CHEATING ON YOU...WHILE CHEATING WITH YOU....  CAN ANYONE ELSE SMELL IRONY?  I SMELL FUCKING IRONY.  AND KARMA.   Not knowing this, I had received a message on New Years day asking to get back together with Ex-a-tron. I put my foot down and said no, because I learned to stick up for myself, and found out how to reengage my spinal chord. I wasn't about to let myself get pushed around by the same old bullshit.  I heard no word from them at all until about two days ago when I woke up to about 35 messages on facebook from friends asking if I was ok, and offering hugs. I thought in my half asleep state, that someone had died. Before I could investigate I had received a phonecall from Landlady who wanted to tell me before I found out through someone else, that Ex-a-tron and Scheming McBitchface had made it official on facebook that they were a couple.  I honestly didn't give a fuck, and wished them all the luck and chlamydia in the world (she's got a rep for being a relationship ruiner and a bit of a fuck anything that moves and some things that don't kind of girl) and hoped he enjoyed the bed he'd made. Until for funsies I checked my ""other"" inbox and found a message from Queen cow herself.   ""Glad to finally get him away from your clingy grasp.""   So now the gloves are off. I know rationally that she's just trying to get a rise out of me and make me react, and I shouldn't, but I'm fucking done. I am trying to move on with my life and she's trying to drag me down to her level.  So there you have it, Reddit. This is why I am no longer with Spouse-a-tron."
badpeoplestories,1y7vd7,Lottia,23,Tue Feb 18 05:50:55 2014 UTC,"I know someone just like her, when I was in high school the guy spent about 3 years bouncing between the two of them because they were both spineless. Glad you got out.  Also, I'm sorta glad you didn't get it but it seems bullshit (on the UK border forces part) that you didn't get a visa on financial grounds. I had a friend from Utah who's mother works two jobs and can't afford hot water supposedly. (note had, so that may have been a lie)"
badpeoplestories,1y7vd7,ch0ug,20,Tue Feb 18 10:15:46 2014 UTC,"Well I'm glad I didn't get it only in that I would have been shackled to a spineless loser. I want to go home don't mistake me, I miss the UK like crazy, but I want to go home on my own merit, not dependent on someone."
badpeoplestories,1y7vd7,Sxooter,10,Tue Feb 18 10:42:39 2014 UTC,I remember when the switch from spouse-a-tron to ex-a-tron happened on fps. Scary. What a bastard though. Dont miss UK too much. At the moment it is very wet and fails.

badpeoplestories,1y7vd7,Sxooter,16,Tue Feb 18 06:14:53 2014 UTC,"That's what I'm trying to tell myself. I've been going through fits of ""Bitch is lucky I don't have a grand sitting so I can fly over in my steelies and kick her teeth in"" and ""bitch isn't worth the effort. I'm not getting arrested for some scummy bitch who doesn't deserve it, I intend on EARNING my rap sheet on things that matter."""
badpeoplestories,1y7vd7,DiscoJaguar,19,Tue Feb 18 06:16:46 2014 UTC,He's not worth the effort either btw.   The old saying living well is the best revenge very much applies here. You're only problem is finding the right sized stick to fight the guys off with etc. :)  Also be picky.
badpeoplestories,1y7vd7,uptoandexcluding,14,Tue Feb 18 06:24:01 2014 UTC,Yeah I've just given him up as a lost cause.  She's properly poisoned him.  So many folk have commented and said they've cut contact saying they can't forgive him for what he did to me and how he's just totally changed since.
badpeoplestories,1y7vd7,penguin_sweater,7,Tue Feb 18 06:29:07 2014 UTC,I assume you guys share a lot of friends in your LARP community. How's that working out? Do you avoid events each other go to etc?
badpeoplestories,1y7vd7,NDWolfwood5268,11,Tue Feb 18 06:42:48 2014 UTC,"Well not any more. he cut contact with anyone who expressed disapproval over his behavior or was supposedly ""my friend"". Which was practically everyone except for her friends who are all poly drama llamas. (Quite a few of them are my friends and I love them to bits but all larpers are drama llamas to a certain extent,  some more so.) We haven't had an event together since the break up,  and since the events are in the uk and I am in th USA I can't make them all that often anymore.  I dint see much of a problem as I have quite a few friends in field and he's managed to alienate himself from most everyone.  It's also an event with some 2000 people,  so is easy to avoid dick heads if you are clever about it."
badpeoplestories,1y7vd7,PerfectHair,5,Tue Feb 18 06:49:26 2014 UTC,"Should thank her really, (I know I know don't shoot me). If he could be gotten by a person like that, sounds like it would have happened  sooner or later.  Either way, they're made for each other.  Glad you're in a better place now."
badpeoplestories,1y7vd7,IndsaetNavnHer,4,Wed Feb 19 21:18:13 2014 UTC,I think I will settle for not smashing her head in at events. That's about as charitable and grateful to her as I'm going to get.

You dodged a massive bullet!  Someone who can't spend a few months away from you, who is unwilling to do half the things they expect from you, and is this much of a spineless tosser is not worth it! Even if you two had been in the same country, he'd have still found an 'excuse'.  I'm beyond words. Just, dude! Duuuuude!   He'll be miserable, she'll be alone (hell, that's probably happening right now) and even if they're together fifty years they'll still never trust each other. What a miserable set of troglodytes. I honestly feel sorry for them, I mean, how pathetic do you have to be to do half the things they have? Disgusting.  You deserve better, and even though it doesn't feel like it, this is the best thing that has ever happened to you. Now you get a chance to be with someone you can trust and who treats you the way you deserve to be treated, and you get a chance to be truly happy and not always wonder.  Ps, can you change his name from Ex-a-tron to Douche-a-tron?  Because he's a douche."

badpeoplestories,1y7vd7,TaylerMykel,12,Wed Feb 19 13:33:49 2014 UTC,"She wanted him because she didn't have him.  Now that she has him, she'll want someone else.  In six months, after their relationship crashes, burns down, falls over, and sinks into the swamp, he'll come crawling back to you with a sob story about how breaking up with you was the worst decision he ever made and will you please please take him back?  When that happens, tell him to fuck off."
badpeoplestories,1y7vd7,DemonKat33,13,Wed Feb 19 00:16:00 2014 UTC,"This resonates so hard with me. My ex from high school pulled the same shit not even four months into our relationship. Over the summer he went to this premiere event our local theater was having for the second part of the 7th Harry Potter movie where all of the previous movies were played back to back to back; it was like, a two day event. I couldn't go because I was working and couldn't take the time off, but I trusted him (although he had a history of cheating on every previous girlfriend and had been screwing some other girl when we had first started talking/flirting/thinking about being a couple) because I was young and stupid and he was my first boyfriend ever. He met this girl there and I guess they really hit it off as ""friends"" when she stole his hat and ran around daring him to take it back. Because he was a complete idiot, he didn't tell me about her, probably knowing that I would NOT be okay with it, but they hung out all the time. Without my knowing, of course. I found out about this when HatThief's friend approached me and asked ""Hey, sleepy_table, are you dating ShitStick?"" Yes, yes we're quite happy. ""Well, you're a really nice person, so I thought I should let you know that he's been seeing my friend HatThief and he kissed her the other day in the stairwell."" So, I confronted him. I asked who she was, when they met, what was going on? He said they were just friends, explained the premiere story and said that SHE had kissed HIM. I bought this, for some reason, but asked that he cut all contact with her. He agreed. After the confrontation, my GBF (gay bestfriend, alwayts good in a crisis), my BFF and I stalked her all over Facebook and discovered that she was posting things like, ""Sigh, Monday. I'm  happy because I get to see him but I can't hold him like I want to. I can't say who he is, because I don't want to ruin things for him with his girlfriend. Heehee!"" I put my bitch face on and messaged her and asked her to please leave him alone. She made the startling confession that it was me she was in love with (wtf?!?) and then I let it go. This was all sometime in late October. Come February, I discover that not only has ShitStick still been in contact with HatThief, but he has been seeing her on the side for quite some time, or so I can only assume upon seeing the gigantic hickey that he tried to hide from me. Obviously, I didn't invest a metric shit ton of money into our relationship or fly over the Atlantic Ocean for him several times, but for a first love, it was a rough way to end. I should have seen it earlier, but I was too desperate to hold on to what I thought I had.  Tl;Dr: My ex is also a douchecanoe"

badpeoplestories,1y7vd7,DemonKat33,2,Tue Feb 18 21:11:18 2014 UTC,"I guess people might like to hear the story of how my Ex-husband-SF- left while I was sleeping, took my 2 yr old son-Baby- (he will be 11 in may), went to fukc his 17 yr. old step sister (I was 20, SF 23, married 3 yrs. at the time), got drunk and high, flipped the car 6 times trying to sneak home, then walked the rest the way to his dad's house (as we were visiting another state) and didn't call the cops. Someone sees our car flipped in the middle of the road and calls, I ALSO call, as my 2 yr old had to be unbuckled from an upside down car. They show up, check out Baby.. Baby's perfect :) even asking for his rubber snakes he was playing with in car... Cops take SisterFucker to jail (after ER)!! (Saved his life.. I was going to kill him).... Then they TAKE my baby... Yes CPS/CSD takes him. Says I failed to protect Baby by letting Baby go. (I was asleep and even if I had tried to stop SF, he was sober when he left ANNNNNDDDD we were married and Baby is HIS son, the cops would have told me that they couldn't stop SF anyway) I fight for 5 months to get Baby back jumping thru all the hoops (being stuck in a state I did NOT plan on living in, had to get a house and full time job), SF refuses to do anything. (I finally win with a ""we're soo sorry we shoulda never taken Baby"" YA THINK!!) Turns out I am pregnant. Find out a week after I kick SF out, which I did the day SF got out of jail (a month after they take Baby)  we will co-parent Ill be a single mom of 2. Now I file for divorce cuz I am sooo done. But SF goes on the run (SF escaped jail somehow after being taken again for being found with a needle in his arm, passed out, rolled into a telephone pole in the park, almost into the river). And I find out at this time, SF ran to be with his step sister who is ALSO pregnant!!!! Took me a yr, but they finally caught him and served SF in jail. I got my divorce. Since SF showed up with his pregnant, underage gf/stepsister AND filled out the papers wrong I got everything I asked for, including supervised visits for SF if he ever wants to see his children. They are now 10 and 7 (til Apr n May) and see SF once a year with SF's grandparents supervision. Of course it didn't work for SF n his sister (her mom, who was SF's Dad's gf for 10 yrs,  actually adopted the baby bcuz SF & 2nd BM (BabyMomz) were both strung out on meth). SF then remarried a Wonderful Woman (Now with the exact same name I had when married to SF... WEIRD) and had a boy & a girl (just like SF & I did) and even named their children almost identical names to MY kids. But SF & WW are happy (guess she can deal with SF's addictions, which now includes food as SF went from 180 with me to 380 now). SF helps raise their kids. Where as my children think a dad is someone who you see once a year. I believe MY children are happier and healthier without SF in their life, as I surely am.   Sorry to story tell in the comments, but damn definitely survived the douchiest of all douche canoes I have ever met. (never really posted or wrote a story here, PLEASE don't attack if I messed up as I love you guys and read stories ALLLLL day, lurking constantly on FPS, BPS, & WTF)!!"
badpeoplestories,1y7vd7,DemonKat33,2,Wed Feb 26 10:02:29 2014 UTC,"Also when the tow company flipped the car over so I could get my luggage out the trunk (SF, baby, & I had just drove 20+ hrs to visit his family, which is why I passed out) I saw that the ONLY part of the roof not completely smashed flat was the place where my son was sitting... I cried! I couldn't believe his dad could do this to him. AT least SF wasn't too drunk to know that he HAD to buckle up MY son. SisterFucker (SF) was thrown from the car and had to climb thru back window to unbuckle Baby who was hanging upside down in his carseat!"

I don't care if he never heard them talk to you that way or they had an excuse (or 20) if my fiancé heard me even say a guy looked at me wrong he would either avoid dude completely (if possible for both of us) OR make sure bully/perv/etc. KNEW I was a special diamond that would be protected at all costs!! If a second time happened it would definitely be their last mistake!  Anyyywwwaaayyyy... I am just sayin I saw your pics and you are beautiful. And SKINNY as all hell!!!! I fluctuate with weight. Sometimes I like being a stick (5'6"" 125) and sometimes, like now, I like being thick (5'6"" 170) BUT I am not a planet. Everything is proportioned right (I would share a pic if I knew how... easiest way I know is log onto FB.com/beautifulbrandii page is private, but I unlocked a cpl pics for you my sweet lady lol & everyone else who sees this I guess lol) and I actually LOVE how I look now over when I was super thin. And I did read all your issues with food, but seriously NOOOO way you are overweight!! You look beautiful :)  Oh off subject again... LOL... Anyway just saying I thought the entire time that you were too good for him... and if you need any more help becoming less beta, or just wanna chat (as you seem completely friggin awesome) I would love to play some games with ya (I saw u play WoW, What you think about Rift??)."

They don't deserve to breath the same air we do, those toxic cunts. Poison their relationship by deliberately tagging him in photos on fb of you and your sexy new man and how great its going. Make it known to him how happy you are with your new man. Make him doubt himself and their relationship, which he will, spineless people second guess everything they do.  Or take the high road, ignore them and all their shit and win the battle by being the happiest, best person you can (given the circumstances). Succeed in your life in every way they can't.

badpeoplestories,1xx6td,TheGreatZarquon,21,Fri Feb 14 20:27:57 2014 UTC,"Start a paper trail at the police station, and get yourself a cheapo security camera, dude. Save every text or email she's sent, keep all your phone records, and document everything that's happened as thoroughly as you can. Since she's already tried filing a false rape report, breaking and entering, vandalizing your car, stealing your mail, killing your utilities and fucking with your phone, having evidence of her bullshit can really help you out the next time she tries something."
badpeoplestories,1xx6td,etherealstasis,11,Fri Feb 14 20:34:18 2014 UTC,"This. So much this. Having paperwork and videos that backs up what has happened to you will be vital if she tries anything else in the future. Most company reps will write you a letter confirming what you talked about. If the company/police station won't write you a letter, write it yourself and fax/email it back to the company.   Even having a dated letter with a sent confirmation from your end is loads better than having only your word against hers."

Keep texts if you still have them, or start documenting them when she continues to harass you. Set up a camera system if you can. Take pictures of your most effected property every day if you have to. If this woman is capable of ""willy nilly"" taking out a full grown man with a beer bottle, who knows how far she'll go to teach you a ""lesson""(besides all the stuff mentioned above)?   Worst case scenario: bitch may kill you if she completely loses it. Best but still worst case that doesn't involve you dying: she may succeed in getting you into more legal trouble and possibly in jail for something you ""did"" to her.  If you can't leave out now, then make-fucking-sure that she cannot come near you, fuck your stuff up, or get in contact with you through either herself, or through the poor saps she managed to wrangle into her crazy game without the threat of jail time."

badpeoplestories,1xx6td,-Fender-,14,Fri Feb 14 21:35:12 2014 UTC,"I've called the cops multiple times and they don't take me seriously, they just say, do you have a restraining order?  I say, I've filed for one but no one is ever able to find her to serve her.  Then they tell me there is nothing they can do unless she's at my apartment harassing me.  Yeah, cuz she's going to stick around when I call the cops on her.  When she changed my address I filed a police report and sent them a copy of the change of address form, nothing ever came of it.  As far as I'm concerned, calling the cops is useless because they haven't helped me on bit.    It's way different when a man calls on a woman, for example.  I called on her when she physically attacked me, I had welts and red marks all over my head and face.  The cop talked to her and she was a total bitch to him, after five minutes he came out and said he couldn't do anything and left.  She again, the same day, attacked me and I called again, then they took her away but that was mainly because she was just being a total bitch and was running her mouth.  Now...one night she just wanted me to leave our apartment and I refused, she called the cops.  They show up and have me sit outside while they talk to her, I wasn't drunk and I hadn't laid a finger on her.  The cop comes out, I figured he was going to let me go back inside....no such luck, he told me to put my hands behind my back.  I'm just like what the fuck for????  He tells me she had a scratch on the palm of her hand and that in domestic calls one of the people involved will end up in jail.  I went to court and the DA didn't even bother to have me go in front of a judge, they just threw it out but still, I ended up in fucking jail for doing nothing, refusing to leave the apartment that I pay 100% of the rent and bills for.    So really,  call the cops?  I do but I don't get my hopes up that they'll do shit to help me."

badpeoplestories,1xx6ax,norajeans,2,Sat Feb 15 07:05:45 2014 UTC,"Yeah, all of the kids in that family do.  Dad is an NParent and Mom is a bit of an enabler who doesn't think her husband is wrong and also thinks therapists are scams.  The older sisters (I'll them Littlepicky and Bigpicky because they're super picky about food) have a nice mix of narcissism and depression so they don't care what their parents think, went to see a therapist and found that it solved their issues.  BF is not Narcissistic at all and because of this, ends up dealing with his parents and school the worst (I try to help him the best I can since I also have an NParent and have horrible depression).    Douchebro, in my opinion at least, deals with his parents the best but is also very narcissistic especially when paired with SAP (who reminds of my NMom so much).  He can slide away from his dad's demeaning comments better than BF or sisters but still holds a lot of angst towards both his dad and Jesusboss.  He is a victim of circumstance in that SAP provides him with the emotional support which he needed and craved, but asks for way too much in exchange and also exasperates his bad characteristics.  In a way, this whole family is a case study of what can go wrong with NParents and BF and sisters were really just lucky that they have really cool partners (not to toot my own horn or anything).    And I do believe that there is an OK person inside of Douchebro but he needs to fix some of his thought patterns and find a partner who will fill him with kindness instead of entitlement and fake confidence."

It just takes being around good people to make you start to emulate them. It's hard to tell how much of who he is as a result of his environment and his way of coping and how much is him. I don't think he's a lost cause, but just like an addict, the first step is admitting you need help. At least the sisters were able to see that.   I think the older we get the more we grow the more we look back and think wow we use to be such douchebags, good thing I outgrew that! Hopefully maturity will also set in at some point too!

I don't think M really even tried to get him back which isn't surprising considering how abusive he was to her and Selena (he had a tendency to resort to fists and cooking knives when raging though I don't think he ever stabbed anyone... yet). The last time Selena saw him was at the CPS office when they were brought in. My mom physically separated them when DJ's horseplay with Selena started to get obviously sexual on his side (incest is nothing new to that family but that's not something I can blame on M). He called us a couple of times from the group home begging my parent's and Selena to let him live with us. I'd say it's been over a year since I've heard anything else from him. I think he enjoys the group home about as well as he did the multiple times he was sent to juvenile detention. No one likes learning they aren't the biggest, baddest, craziest guy in the food chain. I can't say we didn't feel bad for him and my parents really did give serious thought to taking him in but eventually admitted that it was beyond their limits."

No matter that she was his spouse, no matter that she was in charge of the child and welfare is awarded to the parents (not one of them; both). She committed welfare fraud with his name on the paperwork, and the court refused to send the mother to jail even though she was the one who pulled it off. Even though she was an active heroin user. She was taking the child care stipend that was supposed to be going to daycare while she looked for a job and spending it on heroin, having a fellow user sign the papers. When he got locked up she was forging his name - that's how stupid she and the judges who sent my housemate to jail are.  But can't send a woman to jail, especially not a black woman, when you can send a white man.  She didn't show up for the child support hearing and they refused to give him a default judgement. At least he has full custody. After losing nearly everything when he was sent to jail and she sold whatever she could for smack before she disappeared. He sister even took his dog to the pound (he was able to get it back, thank dog)."

I do however don't think throwing change or chains around a skittish dog is the answer however. can't imagine how heartbreaking that had to be for you trying that out.   have you resolved your issue with barking? I think every dog is different. I used ""timeouts"" on my large anxious dog to get her to stop and after time just telling her to stop works now because she knows if I have to go past stop the words ""go take a timeout"" are coming next. (timeouts are in her large kennel). that being said I have a little dog that won't listen at all. I literally have to pick him up and take him to a different room to get him to calm down and stop.

Homeopathy is bullshit, plain and simple.   My story ends somewhat sadly - seven years later, her excessive barking caused polyps on her vocal cords, and we had to take her in for emergency surgery to have them removed. Very scary. She ended up being all right (though my wallet is still recovering), and her scar is healing well so far. She is still able to bark, but it's more of a soft huff-huff now, and it really seems like she doesn't realize she's not making the same sounds as before. I feel like shit that I wasn't able to train her out of it before it got to this point, though. I'm sure there was something else I could have done, but I can't think of it yet. :/   Timeouts is a really great idea, though, and I haven't heard of that technique before.

I'm glad your dog is healing from it ok!   it's easier when everyone in the household is on board. I hope the method work for you! worst case scenario if the little dog is really hyped up it will try to go to the windows in the room I put it in for a time out but I try to block them off with clothes hampers doors and black out curtains and coddle him a little if I can. might be able to avoid blocking out the windows if the rooms windows only point away from the dogs point of interest. (for example the backyard if was barking at the road)
badpeoplestories,1xnt9f,aydr33,1 point,Mon Mar 24 09:55:12 2014 UTC,"It's a homeopathic product, unless it has changed in the past few years. The main tenet of homeopathy is that it works by taking the original ""sickness"" and diluting it down, allowing the ""remedy"" to retain the ""memory"" of the illness while not harming the patient. It's complete hogwash. Adding two drops of extremely diluted anything to a dog's water bowl is not going to do anything - it's just adding water to water. Homeopathy is not how chemistry works.   Yeah, it was totally extreme, and very scary! Thanks, yes, she's doing much better, though it's super awkward explaining to people why she sounds hoarse all the time. Yes, oh my gosh, I totally feel you on the windows. Arrrg."

But above all, I was ashamed. I felt like I instigated or deserved it. Or like I should have been able to handle it. I didn't want people to know, especially my parents so I never told them until after the fact.

badpeoplestories,1xa441,ctrlcutcopy,0,Sun Mar 23 13:55:39 2014 UTC,What on earth is a red pill man?
badpeoplestories,1xa441,SpHornet,-15,Tue Feb 11 16:17:54 2014 UTC,"As far as I am aware, the first person to coin the term was Rollo Tomassi in his blog The Rational Male. Mostly, someone (either male or female) can claim to have taken the red pill once they start being more objective about the world around them (specifically related to gender issues), and start to recognize how many female behaviours are defined by a principle called ""hypergamy"".   As such, saying that someone is a red pill man should not have any negative connotations. The Rational Male (I'm mentioning this blog specifically because this is the one I am most familiar with) is a place where everyone is free to respond to any post, and if one finds any logical inconsistencies or false claims that something is a fact, he is perfectly allowed and even encouraged to mention it. This usually leads to civilised discussions (with both men and women in the community responding) about why what was stated was true, and eventually leads to a better understanding of objective reality.  And now you might understand why I thought that the term ""redpill"" that our very sophisticated friend ""Queefing_Peanuts"" casually stated as if it was an insult was quite out of place."
badpeoplestories,1xa441,xRoseable,-9,Fri Feb 14 17:39:59 2014 UTC,"i looked up the term on google.  as far as i can tell, you're absolutely right.  i may spend some more time researching this, it seems pretty objective, although that may change.  the red pill subreddit seems kind of arrogant and douchey thus far.  i'll give it a chance though."
badpeoplestories,1xa441,SpHornet,-8,Fri Feb 14 23:47:12 2014 UTC,"Ah, I haven't visited that subreddit yet, actually. I did see some negative mentions of it on /r/mensrights, though. Seems your opinion of it might be shared by most MRAs."

badpeoplestories,1xadtx,SKNE,3,Fri Feb 7 23:02:12 2014 UTC,"I worked in the heat of summer last year in south Memphis on a railroad crew. We performed track maintenance and ditch work. (Think locomotive sized ditch witch) Nasty, infectious, crummy environment. I walked ditches under bridges and on the backsides of ghettos, shin deep in disgarded mattresses, soiled clothing and tires, along with everyone else's nasty hot garbage. I personally had to free from the mud 1000 or so tires, from donuts to semi retreads and toss them further into the brush in order to cut a clean ditch. Sounds like a lot of shit, right? It was a 70hr/wk job and I loved every second of it.  All EXCEPT for my super, who let his shitty desire to drink copious amounts of vodka every night ruin team morale. My 2 weeks was announced after he called me a f##k. People are REAL crappy. :("

I don't really know how she would have reacted if we'd called her out, but it really would have been an empty gesture as we couldn't have taken the animals or helped them other than temporary by making sure she took them to the vet or getting them groomed. It wasn't so much that she actively abused them so much as her own comfort was paramount and caring for anybody or anything else was a background concern and didn't happen if she was ""too busy""."
