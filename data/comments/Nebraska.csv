Nebraska,3dy4k7,gAlienLifeform,9,Mon Jul 20 14:13:52 2015 UTC,"I struggle with how to feel about the governor spending this way. Its his personal money and I want to believe he should have the right to spend it how he wants. But what he's doing here bothers me. Senator Coash puts it well in this article.  I disagree with the governor on this issue. But I don't think I'd feel much better about this if he was spending his money to push changes that I would support. It just feels wrong. People should not have this much push in government simply because they have money.  Ultimately, I'm ok if the petition passes, even though I don't support the death penalty. If enough people feel that they were misrepresented by the legislators, then fine. Let's have a real vote on it and settle the issue for good."
Nebraska,3dy4k7,MrTizl,9,Mon Jul 20 15:09:47 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'm not sure this is something the public needs to vote on, as the ban is a practical solution to a problem the Governor continues to ignore: It's impossible for the state to administer a lethal injection. We don't have the drugs, Europe won't let us sell the drugs, the FDA won't let us import the drugs, and substitutions have proven problematic (insofar as a humanely killed prisoner's last words probably shouldn't be ""I feel my whole body burning"").  Plus even disregarding that we can't, we haven't killed a prisoner since the middle of the Clinton administration. ""Nebraska isn't killing inmates"" is a factual statement old enough to be sentenced to death by lethal injection.  I generally like democracy in action, but this feels more like that episode of the Powerpuff Girls (revealing my generation here) where Princess wasn't allowed to beat up bad guys so she tantrumed her way into Daddy buying power armor for her. Both feel like it's far more about one individual not getting their way on a personal power trip, than about ""justice.""  Just a flawed human perception from someone who never was fond of Rickety Cricket, though."
Nebraska,3dy4k7,RukiTanuki,7,Mon Jul 20 15:42:54 2015 UTC,"If the petition fails and there is no vote then I'm ok with that too. Easy for me to say because I agree with the outcome, but it's fair to say that the system played out as designed. Bill passed, governor vetoed, veto overruled, done deal.  Your facts, along with the enormous cost and lack of evidence supporting the death penalty as an effective crime deterrent, just make this whole situation that much more strange. It can't wrap my head around Ricketts digging in this hard. He HAS to have heard these arguments. And he obviously knows he can't get the drugs. Why is he fighting so hard in the face of these very reasonable arguments??  I want to think that he has a good reason and isn't just throwing a tantrum in the form of money, but I can't come up with a better explanation. This makes so little sense."
Nebraska,3dy4k7,MrTizl,7,Mon Jul 20 16:11:51 2015 UTC,"""The functionality of the death penalty in Nebraska has been a management issue that I have promised to resolve."" Speaks volumes about his outlook.  Did I mention he bought illegal execution drugs at a 600% markup which the FDA immediately siezed? Didn't consult state officials, didn't verify importation would be legit, didn't even make sure they'd work except by name. It was so shady the invoice labelled the execution drugs ""harmless medicine."" Then there's this: ""...[HarrisPharma] broker Chris Harris was not authorized to sell the samples, meant for use in testing. That, [Attorney Jerry Soucie] contended, meant Harris misappropriated the thiopental, and Nebraska was in possession of stolen property.""  I typically say ""never ascribe to malice what can adequately be attributed to incompetence,"" but man, that doesn't do him any favors in this case. :)"

The Kevorkian method is expensive and cruel.  Brass is much cheaper and more normal, for killing people who give up their right to life."
Nebraska,3dy4k7,wizmut,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:39:35 2015 UTC,"We had issues with making death row move with the electric chair, don't need to bring up the lethal injection to prove your point there.   Nebraska had a very costly, extremely backed up, and badly ran Death Row program. Compared to other states, it was EXTREMELY easy to delay the program. All you had to do was tie up the courts in unnecessary babble and you got your stay.   To be honest, personally always been on the fence about death row. Either you run it right, or you don't run it at all. It wasn't practical to run it, and any efforts to make the process more streamlined would be kabashed by Chambers as he'd always have at least enough support to drown the bill in a filibuster. And if there is anything Mr. Chambers excels at, its drowning bills he doesn't approve of in filibuster.   So in the end, the Leg overwhelmingly found it impractical to continue the program. Gov. Rickets is acting entirely on personal belief, and not on what is best for the state. He was elected to do what was best for the state, and thus far has proven that his goals do not align with that.   Executive branch always forgets these sorts of things once they leave the leg or judicial branch. Be it Mayors, Governors, or Presidents."

Nebraska,3dy4k7,Superty1,6,Mon Jul 20 18:49:05 2015 UTC,"I've got a problem with a Governor using his own funds to forward his own agenda.  He needs to remember he's there to serve the electorate's wishes, not push his wishes on the electorate.  Not only that, but I view this entire thing as a bit of a hissy fit with him screaming, ""The mean people won't let me kill people!""  Ignoring all that, I have two issues with the Death Penalty, with the first being that it's permanent.  What happens when you later discover that whups, you got the wrong guy?  It's bad enough to incarcerate someone innocent for 25 years, but at least you can release them and let them have something of a life. Once you take their life, however, it's over and done with.  Second, based on the numbers I've seen, it costs more to execute someone than it does to keep them in prison for life. So, we're going to spend even more money executing people because it apparently satisfies some people to do so.  So now because Ricketts is spending his money to try to get his way, the state gets to spend more money on a ballot initiative where he hopes to spend even more of the state's money executing people?!  Hey, Pete? Why don't you focus on some real problems, like oh, say, preventing crime in the first place?  Oh, wait, that would make sense."

Nebraska,3d6chm,Magnus77,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:56:54 2015 UTC,"Eastern Euorpean is pretty prevalent across the US.  I've lived all over.  I'm not trying to be an argumentative dickhead here.  You can find runzas all over the place in little places.  Just off the top of my head, I've had them driving though in Ohio, Utah, Arizona, and California.    The fast food version is what is unique.  I used to date a girl from AZ and she loved them.  She had her mom fly to NE and try them out.    As far as the reuban goes.  You are right and I never thought about that.  You blew my mind.    One thing people don't think about for NE is authentic Chinese.  I used to date a woman from hong kong and we'd always ask for authentic at places.  Good god, you can get some good shit in Nebraska.    Just go to a place and ask for the good stuff.  It's never on the menu."

Nebraska,3d6chm,AgentOrangeMD,5,Tue Jul 14 16:58:52 2015 UTC,"If you are going to Chimney Rock, skip the visitors center and just walk up as close as you can. There is (or there was about 4 years ago) a trail leading around the base. You can get way closer and it looks much more impressive than from the visitors center.  Scottsbluff Monument and the Wild Cat Hills are also super cool. If you are into WW2 history, there are ammunition depots east of Hastings and Northwest of Sidney that are really neat to see."

Robinson, Agate Fossil Beds and then come into Scottsbluff and the Scotts Bluff National Monument, do some hiking in the Wildcat Hills, then hit Chimney Rock, jail and courthouse rocks.  I haven't been to Chadron State Park, but photos I've seen are amazing.  Whatever you do, stay off I-80. It's just road, more road and road. All the interesting stuff is in other parts of the state.  I've yet to get to Valentine, but the parks and waterfalls around there are highly recommended.  Runza has decent burgers and chicken sandwiches, but the Runzas really aren't that great. Don't eat at Valentinos unless you want exploding diarrhea."

Nebraska reminds me a lot of rural Texas. The farm country, the hill country, small towns etc. There are less Hispanics in Nebraska, but you can still find Hispanic Grocery stores, etc.   Nebraska has state income tax but the property taxes are lower. One thing that shocked me was that Car registration has to be done at the DMV IN YOUR COUNTY. You can't just go to a random DMV to get your car registered.  Another thing that pleasantly surprised me was people are less religious in Nebraska. There is still a high church to population ratio, but it is different than in the bible belt.  Also, don't be surprised if people wave at you. It is just a friendly thing to do here. I promise they aren't trying to shoot or rob you."

Old Market, Dundee and Midtown are known for local food and drink spots. These are all neighborhoods in Omaha and everyone here knows them well, just ask anyone and they'll tell you where to go. 3. We have the #1 zoo in the world, the Henry Doorly Zoo. Plan on a full day if you visit there. 4. Much like Texas, Nebraska is a football nuthouse. You will not be bored here if you like football. 5. It gets extremely hot in the summer, and can get extremely cold in the winter. That being said, we have some spectacular fall seasons here. 6. I'm not from Omaha originally, and one thing that surprised me was the sense of community here. There are always events and festivals taking place. Just about every weekend in the summer there's something to do. Very community oriented. 7. Kansas City is only a 2 1/2 hour drive away, and is a TON of fun.

Just don't drive like you need to be there yesterday and give yourself long stopping distances. If you don't need to be out and about, don't go out.  Learn to pump your brakes if you don't have ABS, and stand on that pedal if you have functional ABS.  If you have a 2wd pickup, stay home if it's icy. Seriously, do the rest of us a favor. Don't even bother.   Lastly: do not text and drive. It's dangerous enough when conditions are dry and the car is responsive, it's deadly when the car loses control and you don't have an ""out"" planned because you were worried about your text messages.  Edit: ice scraper. Get two in October. Get one to leave in the car, get one to carry with you to and from the car, because there is a good chance you'll find a layer of ice on your car that freezes it shut."

I'm still not used to how cold it gets. But buy a lot warm clothes before winter comes, you will need them. A four wheel or front wheel drive vehicle comes in handy with the ice but no matter what you drive be careful in the winter. If you're not going to live in an apartment be prepared to shovel snow again and again and again. Liquor can be bought in gas stations here. Be prepared to meet the urban cowboys. Don't drink and drive, Nebraska has one of the highest Dui rates so cops are always everywhere.

This is personal to my experience of driving through the state and visiting country homes there.  The goldenrod is for the state flower, the blue is for the Ogallala aquifer, and the red is Husker red."

While I appreciate the general idea of the blue for the aquifer, I had previously had the thought that the defining characteristic of the state is the Platte river (the original source of the name Nebraska), and thought a blue representation of the river made sense. Anyway, this design is objectively better than the existing flag."

Ideally in a way that would be optional.  Perhaps across the gold stripe in a slightly lighter gold?  A version with ""Nebraska"" text would be great to plant the association of the new flag."

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. If you would like one made for any subs, just say the word and I'll crank it out. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as ""city"", “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  I will be using this data to update my state/city/regional subreddit profanity analysis. I will also be running the numbers to see which of the subs have the most active discussion. My city and international clouds should be coming out in a week or so.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of the words, the top words are under the third image in the album. I typically removed the largest words on the second and third images, as they were so large they typically made the other words harder to see. Only two states had words larger than their state name/abbreviation as the largest word, Wisconsin with ""Walker"" (our governor) and California with ""Water"".

Nebraska,3bdhzt,PookyBearTrady,3,Sun Jun 28 04:44:56 2015 UTC,"I like Bernie but I have a few fears, totally unrelated to his politics - which I largely agree with.   I think he can beat Hillary, but I think he might end up damaging the democratic ticket in the process. I think that - for better or for worse - Hillary is the better chance to beat the republican field. If Bernie beats Hillary and if Bernie wins the White House, I think he would be an ineffective president due to inaction or outright mutiny from Congress. I truly believe the backlash against his policies would be condemned and resisted more than Obama's.   Again, I like Bernie and he's got the best ideas of any candidate currently running (and he's been the most consistent), but I just don't think he'd be able to get anything done."

There's no recognition of our heritage, our resources, or our geography -- all common themes of political flags. It's bland and forgettable. (The obvious retort -- ""Just like Nebraska!"" -- is a punchline, not a serious defense of the design.) Even if we had to keep that designer's colors and symbolism choices, we could do significantly better. Something as simple as a subtle wave could represent the Platte, or the Sandhills, our the""amber waves of grain"". The presented design makes it appear the designer was tired and did ours last."

Nebraska,39nyxa,ronniejean1,5,Sat Jun 13 03:04:55 2015 UTC,"Here's the OP from /r/unsolvedmysteries :  Samuel Sherman (19) disappeared near his home on July 19, 2001. He left for a job interview in downtown Omaha that morning and never returned to his home in the 3600 block of Bedford Avenue, Omaha, Nebraska. He had blonde hair, blue eyes, and weighed about 160 lbs. There is very little known about Sherman and a Google search will yield very limited results. I'm hoping someone who attended school with him or knew the family will come forward with more details. The lack of evidence is almost as mysterious as his disappearance. Sherman's case is exceptionally interesting because it occurred just one month after the disappearance of another 19 year old boy named Jason Jowlkowski. Jowlkowski also lived in Omaha, Nebraska about a block from where Sherman lived. Even more suspicious is that he had interviewed for a job only a week prior. Jowlkowski was headed to meet a friend for a ride to work when he disappeared. Unlike Sherman, Jowlkowski's disappearance has been covered extensively. On paper, Samuel Sherman disappeared under the same circumstances as Jason Jowlkowski but so little is known about him. Any new information would be helpful to both cases.

Nebraska,38jrbz,Ransal,4,Thu Jun 4 19:39:55 2015 UTC,In the 1860's the politics of what city was going to be the capitol of Nebraska was contested between the oldest city and largest city. Omaha ended up being the choice but Bellevue still complained nonstop. To make a concession they agreed to pick a city on the west side of the platt river to help people traveling from the west to have one less hurdle to get into the capitol. Lincoln was a small town named after the current president. The president wasn't liked at the time as the civil war was about to kick off fully expecting the people of Nebraska to move the capitol back to Omaha quickly. Instead you know what happened. Lincoln was shot and the capitol stayed put ever since. On mobile so mind the grammar and spelling.

Majority doesn't mean shit to people like him."
Nebraska,385c3u,NecessarySchism,2,Tue Jun 2 00:39:23 2015 UTC,"To be fair it is likely that the majority of Nebraskans agree with the death penalty and the stance that Ricketts took on the issue.   That being said I do think his position on the death penalty is wrong. The reality is that Nebraska is very unlikely to ever use the death penalty again and yet all the appeals, and now the possibly of a referendum vote on keeping the death penalty is costing the taxpayers a fortune.   You would think that in a conservative state like Nebraska that Ricketts might want to take an opportunity to save the taxpayer some money. The only problem is that conservatives only want smaller government went it is on their terms."
Nebraska,385c3u,gereth,5,Tue Jun 2 19:37:05 2015 UTC,"While I agree with the last two paragraphs of your reply wholeheartedly, very nicely put, I don't think the first one stands correct. A 30-19 vote from our elected officials wouldn't indicate that the majority of Nebraskans support capital punishment. The vote goes to show that most would agree with what you said in that it has become a waste of taxpayer dollars and largely inefficient. Pete Ricketts is making a big deal about it not because he has to, but because he chooses to...and that makes him a giant scumbag."

Nebraska,385c3u,Blitzsturm,4,Tue Jun 2 01:18:12 2015 UTC,"""But what then is capital punishment but the most premeditated of murders, to which no criminal's deed, however calculated it may be, can be compared? For there to be equivalence, the death penalty would have to punish a criminal who had warned his victim of the date at which he would inflict a horrible death on him and who, from that moment onward, had confined him at his mercy for months. Such a monster is not encountered in private life."" - Albert Camus in Reflections on the Guillotine.   I would also say we don't prosecute soldiers for murdering combatants because it's at least theoretically the killing of someone who is actively trying to kill you. In the case of capital punishment the victim has already been detained."
Nebraska,385c3u,milhouse92,4,Tue Jun 2 04:51:29 2015 UTC,"I had to re-watch the video to figure out how you pulled out the word ""murder"".  The only part I found was the ""murder drugs"" which I don't believe was intended in a literal sense.  But even assuming it was, with a definition of ""to kill someone unlawfully and with premeditation"" it would be accurate as it's unlawful to import the specific drugs.  So it's kind of accurate in a weird sideways kind of way despite having only the intention to sound funny.  As to the comparison to soldiers killing; I see that more akin to killing someone in self defense rather than murder, but in a more specific national context.  If we were always 100% sure the person being executed was guilty rather than 95% sure and it costed less to execute someone than life in prison I'd be totally in favor of it.  Even being a deterrent has some merit but that's been proven wildly untrue.  So I landed on the side of being against it.  Not for any assumed moral superiority about the wrongness of killing but it being wildly impractical and ineffective; accomplishing nothing more than making some people feel better.  As for John Oliver I find him a wildly funny comedian masquerading as a news pundit.  His primary objective is to entertain, his primary subject matter is the news.  On the bright side this combination tends to lend it's self to more informed viewers since people tend to remember things that are more funny.  This is why Stephen Colbert's audience was tested as being more knowledgeable than any other news watching demographic.  While some matters may be stretched with no visible intent to mislead, I'd not call it the flat out lies organizations like Fox News spit out.  But... yeah... when it comes to the ethics and politics of ending another human life things can get a little crazy an people have a lot of opinions."
Nebraska,385c3u,Blitzsturm,3,Tue Jun 2 06:09:24 2015 UTC,"I used to work on Ricketts campaign. I had a chance to meet Pete a few different times. He was a very nice person in the time I got to spend with him. For how often he is made to be this super-rich out of touch guy, he really isn't. I remember the day after I first met him, he greeted me by name. I haven't really enjoyed his politics since he took office, but he is a good person. It can be very frustrating seeing both sides take low blows at each other, but that's the game they are playing.  Side note: he seriously has the funniest laugh I have ever heard, it could be on Revenge of the Nerds its so funny."
Nebraska,385c3u,-jabberwock,2,Tue Jun 2 13:38:14 2015 UTC,"I tend to consider myself a ""moderate"".  More socially liberal with regard to personal freedoms while fiscally conservative with regard to the stupendous amount of money the government spends on things we don't need.  Things like when it comes to public assistance I think we need to take care of people that are down on their luck without letting them abuse the system to live off of when they can pitch in.  And I'm a huge proponent of pot legalization for a whole LOT of reasons not including my own interest in it's use.  Anyone that's really taken the time to research these issues without personal biases can easily see the problems we're running into.  These tend to be pretty common sense stances a large majority of the population stands behind.  But you get some right or left wing extremists with sticks up their butts that think they have to throw away moderation and go way off the rails.  This is in part why I'm registered as an independent.  Partisan politics turns into this vicious and counterproductive ""us vs them"" fight.  Like the GOP throwing a temper tantrum that shut down the government in the somewhat recent past.  Each side is more concerned with getting their way than serving the interest of the public.  I'd like to see more of us that get disgusted with this kind of bullshit behavior get more politically active.  Make sure we put politicians into office that actually listen to their people and make a solid effort to do right by the people rather than advance some personal view.  Maybe we can convince some of the candidates in the next election to do an AMA and really engage with the public in an open format. so we can more easily tell who's real and who's fake."
Nebraska,385c3u,Blitzsturm,2,Tue Jun 2 14:59:44 2015 UTC,"That is an often talked about area in politics. The idea is independence vs mandate. Some candidates run on the premise that if they are elected then they are beholden to the voter who elected them, the majority. Through the representation system of government that we have transfers the individual powers that each individual has into that elected representative. This is where you have officials that are more of a maverick in terms of voting positions. I think that often times, we forget to ask the candidates how they view that issues of if they are vested with power to make decisions as they see fit or if they are strictly beholden to the voters who elected them.  If anyone watched the override debate on repealing the death penalty, there was a representative who said that he disagreed with it, but he campaigned on the promise that he would uphold his campaign promise. Sen. Chambers then urged him to do what he felt was right in his heart. This is kind of the crux of the political process for elected representatives, especially if they stand on the opposite side of those who elected him/her."
Nebraska,385c3u,-jabberwock,2,Tue Jun 2 16:19:33 2015 UTC,"For the most part I feel elected officials should represent the interests and opinions of the people they represent with very few exceptions.  Exceptions would be like ""should we allow blacks in restaurants"".  There are many states to this day that would deny basic human rights if it were put to a popular vote.  You're not allowed to deny fundamental human rights even if it's a popular opinion.  Which is why gay marriage is such a hot-button topic as if late.  Abortion has a larger moral grey area with justifiable thinking on either side but that's a matter that was already decided in roe vs wade.  So women have an undeniable right to safe abortions within certain time constraints.  My problem with some of the conservative base is enforcement of personal beliefs and prejudices on others; which is why I identify as socially liberal.  If a given behavior doesn't affect you, or even have a victim or a determinable negative effect on society, then I don't think we should piss-away the money that it takes to futility try to stop that behavior.  Most people are fine despite the moral objections of others; and if your a happy well-functioning tax-paying citizen then you should be able to do more or less whatever you want up to the point where you are hurting others as long as you're aware of whatever risks apply to yourself.  So in terms of a politician doing what he or she feels is right... right for him/herself or right for the most people? Ricketts in particular may feel his actions are right for him, but everyone else has made it clear it's not right for them.  I'd find an ideal leader one that does what brings the most happiness and well-being to the people he/she represents completely objectively based on only facts regardless of personal hang-ups."
Nebraska,385c3u,Blitzsturm,2,Tue Jun 2 16:15:50 2015 UTC,"Mostly right.  There may be a handful of caveats involving privileged knowledge like national security but in general operating in a way that brings the most good to the most people.  Ricketts doing what people don't want is more to do with the two-thirds majority that overruled him and his adamant stance on the issue despite the american population deeming the practice in less favorable terms in light of more public awareness of the facts regarding it.  To a degree I can understand if he made promises to parties that helped him get elected and his upholding of those promises, that's sometimes the dirty-business politicians have to engage in to even grasp at power.  It's not ideal but it's how things currently work.  As for individual controversial items it's popular for conservative politics to appose I'll list out a few and try to concisely explain my view.   Gay Marriage: Marriage affords some special privileges such as making medical decisions for a partner, insurance coverage, managing estate of someone after death, etc.  Most objections are on religious grounds, I reject all of these as they don't apply to people outside of the relationship and the constitutions expressed forbidding imposing religion on others.  The remaining arguments are on semantics of a generally already defined institution.  To this you could go ""separate but equal"" legal agreement but that idea has some baggage and bigotry attached to it.  So, I'm fine with marriage being between ""two consenting adults"" given how much power it has to affect the happiness of people in the relationship and no power to affect the happiness of people not in it. Abortion:  Nobody wants to have an abortion.  They are an absolute last resort measure to prevent having children for people that are not able to support children.  I feel people should do everything they can to avoid needing one but they should remain a safe and legal option.  There need to be carefully selected guidelines regarding timing however.   Most objections are on religious grounds, I reject all of these as they don't apply to people outside of the situation and the constitutions expressed forbidding imposing religion on others.  This matter has already been ruled on in Roe vs Wade and the case is closed.  There have also been some unexpected economic benefits from Roe vs Wade as well; to learn more about this find the book or the movie ""Freakanomics"" which explain this in greater detail. The Drug War: I could rant on this one for a long time and cite a huge number of studies and resources but I don't have proper motivation to invest that kind of time.  You can do some googling on the topic to find sources if you're interested.  But, the drug war has been disastrous.  It's consumed billions of tax payer money, ruined good peoples lives and ultimately failed as drug use rates have risen slightly since the ""war"" began.  I know more than a few happy healthy intelligent successful tax-paying marijuana users.  This prompted me to do a lot of research which lead me to find it's less harmful than either tobacco or alcohol and has a significant number of medical applications.  If the people I know were put in prison for their use it would destroy the lives of good people that have never wronged another person ever.  And there are people that haven't been so lucky.  Lots of  them.  The US imprisons more people per capita than any other country in the world by a HUGE margin and a majority of those arrests are on drug charges.  I find this unacceptable.  As with alcohol and tobacco, I'd like to see it (and a few other substances) legalized, taxed and regulated.  We've already seen the consequences in Colorado which are overwhelmingly positive, they have huge tax revenue off it.  This is another hot issue Ricketts is staunchly apposed to.  Anyone that's gone over the data without bias can only come to the conclusion what we're doing now makes no sense; it's doing more damage than good. Science Denial: This has been a hot topic for a long time.  People denying evolution and climate change nearly exclusively on religious grounds.  Politicians thinking they know more than the whole of the scientific community with years of research, knowledge and an overwhelming pile of undeniable proof make me worry and I don't want them in a position of power. Police Corruption: This is getting huge press these days.  It's pretty clear we have a problem of police abuse of power, some cases of blatant racism, civil forfeitures police simply stealing people's possessions without them having done anything wrong and general militarization of police forces.  This isn't a specifically conservative-defended problem but the common stance among many is that the police do nothing wrong... ever... Government sanctioned religion:  Things like prayer in school, display of the 10 commandments on government property, etc.  This has never been acceptable.  Often people will try to say the US is a ""Christian Nation"", those that believe this haven't studied the actual works and quotes of the founding fathers.

Nebraska,37yda0,Plainsman,2,Sun May 31 13:03:03 2015 UTC,"For those getting a login screen:  In the early 1900s, a group of homesteaders settled along the North Loup River, calling the settlement DeWitty.  Like many others of the time, they sought out the American dream. While the people were historically important, unfortunately, the settlement was widely forgotten. Finally, though, a group is working to remedy that.  The settlers came as part of the Kinkaid Act of 1904, which allowed them to claim 640 acres of land or one square mile in the counties that made up the Sandhills.  Some of the first settlers included Charles and Hester Meehan, an interracial couple who fell in love in Canada before moving to Overton and then DeWitty. Charles was Irish-American, and Hester was of African decent. One of the Meehans’ last living grandchildren, Catherine Meehan Blout, believes it’s important to remember her roots, along with the others who settled in DeWitty, including escaped slaves and free people of color.  “It’s a very important part of America’s history,” Blout said. “Black Americans, and in my case Canadians, were part of the entire landscape of the U.S. It’s an important story for us all to see and remember.”  More than 100 families lived in the settlement during its 20 years of existence, according to Nebraska-born author Stew Magnuson. DeWitty had a baseball team and a band that played across the Sandhills. It is considered the most successful African-American rural settlement in Nebraska.  “The story of DeWitty is the story of the American dream,” Blout said.  Members of the settlement worked closely with the nearby town of Brownlee, which was made up mostly of Danish settlers. Robert Hannahs, a former slave and a barber, worked in Brownlee during the week and in DeWitty on the weekends.  Every year on the Fourth of July, the communities would come together and have a party, according to Magnuson, whose book “The Last American Highway: A Journey Through Time Down U.S. Route 83: Nebraska-Kansas-Oklahoma,” includes a chapter on DeWitty and photos of people from Brownlee helping the DeWitty settlers build their sod church.  “By all accounts, the two communities got along really well,” Magnuson said. “People had to depend on each other in that remote, harsh land.”  Eventually the name of the settlement was changed to Audacious, which Blout believes is fitting.  “The homesteaders of DeWitty were just that — audacious,” Blout said. “They were audacious for believing that the American dream belonged to them too, and they were audacious for committing all they had to attain that dream. Remembering DeWitty pays homage to those who confronted barriers in the pre-Civil War United States, in Canada and in the Nebraska Sandhills with a ‘we can’ attitude. Remembering DeWitty gives anyone who knows their story a reminder that they can too.”  While putting his book together, Magnuson thought it was sad there was nothing near the old settlement to show that it existed. To change that, Magnuson and the Cherry County Historical Society are spearheading an effort to have a historical marker installed near the location of the DeWitty settlement. The marker was recently approved by the Nebraska State Historical Society, but $5,100 has to be raised before it can be installed.  “The state will construct a place to pull over,” Magnuson said. “We’re looking for donations large and small.”  That means the marker is all that has to be purchased.  “When we can clearly mark where our ancestors have been — and by name — we can ensure the full story will be told, and we can then better understand the purpose of our journey,” said Joyceann Gray, great-granddaughter of DeWitty homesteaders William Walker and Charlotte Hatter.  Donations can be mailed to or dropped off at Security First Bank, P.O. Box 480, Valentine, NE 69201. Make checks payable to: “DeWitty Historical Marker Fund.”  “I hope the marker goes a little way toward acknowledging our past,” Magnuson said."

In this case, they'll likely say she was a horrible person and she deserved it and God has sent her straight to hell and blah blah blah. Thing is, whatever they say is protected free speech hand crafted to make you want to punch them in the face.  They simply go where they're high emotions, stand where they're legally allowed to be, carry the most inflammatory but legally protected signs and make the most inflammatory but legally protected statements until someone attacks them. Then they sue the pants off that person with their shark lawyer family.   City blocks their legally protected assembly? Even better. Sue the city, and the cops, and the mayor personally, etc.  Once you hear of this world view, little things make more sense: how a seemingly insane organization is always in the legal right, how even their smallest children know exactly how to be inflammatory but legally protected, etc.  Their entire model is to troll you so you do something they can sue for.

Ricketts has vowed a veto and announced last week that the state has bought new lethal injection drugs to resume executions.   I'd be curios to hear his exact reasoning... ""Well, we already bought the drugs... we gotta kill somebody otherwise it's a waste"""
Nebraska,36n3pa,Blitzsturm,2,Wed May 20 17:55:17 2015 UTC,"I've heard him on the radio a couple times and he basically says his usual ""I'm just listening to the will of the people of Nebraska"" along with ""We need this as a tool to prevent heinous crimes and bring real justice to those who commit them.""  Why we bought more of the drugs is beyond me. Is that why we haven't executed anyone for almost 20 years? Because we just didn't have the drugs on hand?"
Nebraska,36n3pa,MrTizl,6,Thu May 21 13:54:17 2015 UTC,"I'm imagining being pro-death penalty is a political posture that appeals to a conservative base by being ""tough on crime"" which has nothing to do with facts regarding it's effectiveness.  If you do research on it most information suggests the death penalty isn't a deterrent at all.  That coupled with the weird fact that it costs more to execute someone than keep them in prison for life and the startlingly high percentage of innocent inmates sentenced to death makes it just plain impractical and slightly immoral.  There's only one real benefit to execution and that's making the family of their victims feel better.  Additionally the Nebraska Public's opinion on medical use of marijuana is pretty overwhelmingly clear.  Yet he's pretty hardcore about blocking it.  So it seems like he's not concerned with popular opinion; at least not outside of a specific base."
Nebraska,36n3pa,Blitzsturm,3,Thu May 21 15:11:21 2015 UTC,"The real shit in buying the drugs? A lethal injection requires 2-5 grams of sodium thiopental and 100 mg of pancuronium bromide, the two drugs that the state just bought. According to the governor's office, the state has purchased 1,000 ampules at 2 mg each of pancuronium bromide at a cost of $26 per ampule, and 1,000 vials at 1 g each of sodium thiopental at a cost of $25 per vial. Both of these have shelf lives of 3 years. The state just spent $51,000 on drugs they absolutely should have realized they would never use. Even if this bill wasn't being passed, that's a minimum of 20 lethal injections that would have to be performed in the next 3 years to use all of the supply of pancuronium bromide, and at least 200 (!) to use all of the sodium thiopental. There are only three people on death row in the state that have exhausted all their appeals. Not sure how Pistol Pete thought he would be able to kill that many people so fast. This is just a colossal waste of taxpayer dollars."

Nebraska,36n3pa,balaayaha,7,Thu May 21 00:20:32 2015 UTC,"To expand on /u/balaayaha's comments, a Seattle University study found that each death penalty case cost an average of $1 million more than a similar case where the death penalty was not sought ($3.07 million vs. $2.01 million). If Seattle University is too liberal for your tastes, a study coming out of the Kansas legislature in 2014 found that defense costs per trial in the average death-penalty case were $395,762 per case, while costs for non-death-penalty cases averaged $98,963 per case, less than 25% of the cost. Not only that, but they found that housing prisoners on death row cost $49,380 per prisoner per year compared to $24,690 per prisoner per year in the general population.  I don't agree with the death penalty for a number of reasons, first and foremost being the fact that the possibility of even a single innocent person being killed by the state for a crime they didn't commit seems egregious to me. But like /u/balaayaha said, the economics are definitely in favor of repealing, which is a large reason this bill has received bipartisan support in the legislature."

Nebraska,36n3pa,huskermut,0,Thu May 21 05:57:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think your direct economic argument is entirely correct. My stance on the death penalty is not exact, but to say any one will lose an argument from an economic stand point is not correct, either.  Placing a monetary value on a life has never proved to be an exact science and it is a sensitive subject. However, Syracuse Professor Thomas J. Kniesner estimate that, to reduce workplace fatalities, the public is willing to pay from $4 million to $10 million in regulatory costs for each life spared.  If you want to base your argument solely on monetary terms and using the lower-bound estimate of $4 million, the lifetime cost of a capital-eligible case that results in the death penalty would need to come in excess of $56 million for it to outweigh the public's willingness to avoid being murdered.  Obviously the death penalty costs money, so does any other criminal justice sanction. But these are expenses that protect innocent lives, hold society's most heinous criminals accountable, and are legitimate functions of both federal and state governments.  You can argue your simple facts all day, but what do you put the cost of a life at?"

What does this have to do with our comparison? The inmate will either spend their life in prison, or be executed. They're no longer a danger to the public."
