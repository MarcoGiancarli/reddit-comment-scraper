At our store (if memory serves) egg biscuits are $1.69, cheese adds $0.30, while the egg mcmuffin is 2.79.  Another option may be a ""muffin only"" ($1.29) add cheese (+$0.30) add round egg (+$0.69 or more I think.)  Also, here the ability to add/sub eggs to the $1 sausage mcmuffin is explicitly blocked (without generous use of the ask me key).    Edit: however, You could order a sausage muffin without sausage and a round egg in the side (same cost as adding it to another sandwich).  This would most likely be the cheapest option,  but requires guest assembly.  Pricing structure at your local stores may and will vary and has an extremely high probability of making absolutely no sense.    Meal discounts may further complicate things further.

I !00% agree with you that McD needs to change their business model but i am not sure what they can change at this point other than cutting labor. If you read the article, they complaint that they are running 15-20 ppl where as others run at 6 employees.

McDonalds,3dhlu2,willox19217,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:51:39 2015 UTC,"My store rarely punishes people for anything, so they spot sweep lobby and barely wipe everything before leaving. This is why it is so gross."

McDonalds,3dgfmv,McFuckMyLife,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:24:04 2015 UTC,thats sort of what we do. just common sense and you can kind of tell by pricing total. you or the customer will usually catch on if something is off.
McDonalds,3dgfmv,k4zz4m,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:31:16 2015 UTC,"There's a lot more to it than just reading back their order, it's not something you can ""only do for large orders"". Sure, maybe that specific part.  It changes everything from the exact wording you're supposed to say when taking orders/presenting/taking cash, it changes the bagging/running procedures, changes how you hand out bags, and changes the way stickers are placed on sandwiches and where certain sandwiches are placed in the HLZ."
McDonalds,3dgfmv,McDKid,2,Sat Jul 18 13:31:50 2015 UTC,My store is starting AAT and I find it extremely helpful.  I am usually in grill but I am getting crossed trained in service so I can become a manager and AAT just feels like it is something that should be done.  In grill it helps when I don't have to remake an order or a sandwich because someone handed it our wrong.
McDonalds,3dgfmv,MrGeniusPhD,2,Thu Jul 16 04:36:38 2015 UTC,"Ask ask tell is supposed to be the new standard for all us restaurants.    The key change is forced upselling is no longer policy.  Instead, that time should be used to verify the customer's order.  In addition, at both windows  and when presenting FC  orders, a key part of the order should be verified before paying/handing orders.  Theres also a bunch of smaller changes.  Folding bags is now discouraged, as this prevents guests from quickly verifying the contents of the bag.  Sauces should be on top.  Our store also recently installed a printer by one of the order-taker POS units to print pick lists for all held orders (a big accuracy problem here).   For drive through, usage of order separation dividers is encouraged to clearly communicate which bags belong to whom.  On the grill side, the importance of using of grill slips is highlighted.  At our store, we replaced the slip printer hardware, and the new setup has dedicated printers for side one and side two (4 printers total.)  A ""modified"" UHC  tray is placed in the landing zone, and is to be used to isolate specials from regulars."

I've already changed my greeting but I only read back orders if I think I got it wrong.

McDonalds,3dez80,hipnugget23,3,Wed Jul 15 19:19:11 2015 UTC,"""Hi, welcome to McDonald's! How can I help you?""  Customer orders, I say ""okay"" softly after most items so they know I've rung it up. When they finish, I double check anything that was even slightly confusing to understand (""Did you want two drinks total, or just one with the meal?"")  Then I'll say, ""Can i get you anything else?"" Or ""Does that complete your order?"" They say yes, I give them the total and tell them it'll be right up!  As a newer cashier, I'd double check the entire order, especially if it's big or confusing, just to be sure.  Edit: Don't forget to ask if it's for here or to go after you've verified everything! Sorry, I usually work back booth, so everything's to go!"
McDonalds,3dez80,forensikat,2,Thu Jul 16 00:11:07 2015 UTC,"This is very useful, thank you."
McDonalds,3dez80,TurkeyLurkey33,2,Thu Jul 16 02:48:01 2015 UTC,"I learned instead of saying ""for here or to go"" it's best to cut down to just "" will that be for here"" because people are usually coming inside to eat there or else they would just drive thru. Saw it in some video for training. Funny thing I did for the first week of work was when people came in and ordered a drink I asked "" for here or to go"" which was silly but I did it and kind of got laughed at a lot."
McDonalds,3dez80,forensikat,2,Thu Jul 16 23:19:54 2015 UTC,"Haha that's hilarious! I did that too because they drilled in getting whether the customer was eating in or not right, so they'd order something single and small and I'd be like ""uhh... for here or to go?""  I also think that's a great suggestion. I didn't think of the fact that if they come in, they're probably eating in (which is true). I've also heard that yes or no questions are just better in general since the customer doesn't have to say as much as it generally makes the process go quicker. Thanks for the tip, I'll have to try it tomorrow unless they banish me to back booth!"

McDonalds,3dap0h,VeryMeanDude,7,Tue Jul 14 20:27:22 2015 UTC,I just finished my second shift. Best tip I could say is to ask questions when you're confused! It's not really that hard of a job but it can get hectic and you need to pay attention when they're training you.
McDonalds,3dap0h,youmakemewannasing,3,Tue Jul 14 21:19:05 2015 UTC,"Working for almost 2 months now. I'm pretty good at the kitchen, they started teaching me how to work the front. Don't be afraid to screw up because you will. And even if you do, its okay. No one is judging you on your mistakes and everyone is willing to help. Just ask! You'll eventually master it after making hundreds and hundreds of sandwiches or pressing hundreds and hundreds of buttons. Repetition is what nails everything into your head! Good luck and welcome to the crew!"
McDonalds,3dap0h,coolpixer,5,Wed Jul 15 00:30:08 2015 UTC,"Stay busy. If you don't have an immediate job (taking an order, making something for an order, etc.) Find something to do. Sweep, stock stuff, ask what you can do to help. Ask your manager for clarification if you need it, don't try to figure something out if you don't understand.  If you hear a term you're unfamiliar with,  ask about it. Staying busy is the biggest thing for me. When I have new people on my shift, I have to constantly tell them to stay busy. As a manager, I really notice and appreciate when new people ask how they can help, are willing to learn new things, and generally stay busy."

McDonalds,3dbjyb,GlycerineGaming,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:06:53 2015 UTC,"Try to learn where everything. Stay up to date with specials. Some registers aren't as responsive as I like so when you're trying to up size or add in multiples make sure they light up. For special grills know when to sure the shortcuts at the top and full grill feature. ex. When its like Big Mac no pickles the shortcuts are fine but like 8 mc doubles plain its easier to go [8] [grill] [only cheese]. Handle cash like a boss next dollar up/ exact 20/ exact cash is your friend.  Learn what's on the sandwiches so communication with the grill is easy and keep it simple. Even if the customer says Mc double no onions, no pickle, no mayo, only ketchup and cheese don't put all of that in there, just only ketchup. Ask me is fine for really interesting stuff.   Being accurate saves you more time then messing up and having to fix stuff or calling a manager to wipe off your screen. If you're slow keep the chit chat going with the customers.  I agree with coolpixer on repetition, when I'm working late and on back drive I'll repeat the order to them or to myself so I don't forget it/mess up omw back to the register."

I didn't know about this, nobody else at my store does either. We've always had to do each one individually. I always thought it was stupid. I always tried doing stuff like [8] [only cheese], never thought that you would have to press 8 then grill. Definitely some kind of hidden feature.  Just tested in my POS simulator and it works."
McDonalds,3dbjyb,etherealchaos,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:09:42 2015 UTC,"Out of all the fast food places I have worked, McDonald's registers have to be one of the easiest ones I have used lol.  Like others said, repetition helps so much! It'll become muscle memory and eventually, your fingers will be flying across the screen. But here's a few tips I can think of right off hand.   If your POS system is set up like mine was, you'll have the ability to ring in multiple items at once. What I mean by that is sometimes, people order in circles. They'll say 'I want a 4 Piece Happy Meal, two cheeseburgers, two large drinks, blah blah...' but the POS will prompt you several options for that Happy Meal (what toy, what side, what drink, what sauce) so thankfully, you can ring up all the rest and then go back and ask them what choices that they want. So don't be afraid to ring up other items, even after the computer prompts you to pick a choice. It saves on time and confusion. I don't know about your store, but at the store I was at, people loved their half-sweet/half-unsweet tea. There is a button under Grill that says Half-Cut, so push that in when you need to do half-and-half tea. I believe there is also a Half Sweet Tea option, but I always got chewed out for using that one. When people want to upgrade their meal (or just their drink) to a Large, make sure you use the Md to Lg Upgrade Drink button. I usually forgot to put the upcharge on there most of the time lol. Ringing in things in groups helps a LOT. If someone wants (God forbid) 5 Big Macs, instead of pushing the button 5 times individually, just push 5 and then the Big Mac icon. It saves you time and frustration lol. But a word of caution, sometimes the buttons will stick and then you'll wind up with 55 Big Macs. Lol. So be careful.   Good luck! You'll be a pro in no time!"

McDonalds,3d0wse,youmakemewannasing,3,Sun Jul 12 16:24:10 2015 UTC,"Good luck, it's really not that scary. Just do what your managers tell you and try to always smile with the customers. There's a few new people at my store that are total dead pan because they're new and nervous. A smile goes a long way, but also don't let rude customers get you down.   My number one tip would be to always find something to do. Depending on your location, mornings might be slow. Wipe something down, clean off trays, refill coffee. My managers hate seeing people just stand around, so if you're at a loss, just start sweeping. If they want you doing something else, they'll tell you, and even if they don't mention it, they'll appreciate you not just standing there when it gets slow.  Also, when they tell you to do lobby, that's not a position. My first day, I went to do a lobby check and was out there for 45 minutes because they never told me to come back! Be sure it's clean though, and check the trash and bathrooms!"

I watched videos for three hours and then made fries for an hour and went home, lol. Now I'm on register.  On my second day, I watched the cashier for the entire day and made drinks for her. I was shown how to make almost all of the drinks, which was cool. Third day was the same, and fourth day was my first day on my own register.  My biggest tip is to be generous and kind to your coworkers right away, especially the people working at the front with you. Help them out- offer to make things for them if you know how and aren't busy. They will like you, and they will be totally willing to help you out when you need it. The people in the front have already saved my ass on register multiple times.  Also, if you make a mistake on ringing up someone's order and it is too late to modify it- go grab the manager and have them fix it. Trust me, the customer will eventually notice the mistake, even if they don't right away. It's better to fix it before they see it, they will be less annoyed."

Right next to McCafe the paper told the trainer to be nice! So I'm thinking I may make a lot of mistakes or its kinda hard?    I'm nervous on being put on the drive thru if that happens too!

For a while, it was essentially cook-to-order after lunch peak, and then there was the whole $1.19 price scandal, which probably killed sales halfway through its limited life.    Made me realize how great of an idea the buffalo ranch mcchicken (RIP) was (a single sauce is easier to keep in code than a special type of meat)."
McDonalds,3cyygu,TehWildMan_,3,Sun Jul 12 23:53:19 2015 UTC,"Ours actually sold pretty well, but there's just too many options. I think that's a problem with some McDonald's, too many options, so products are bound to fail.   I will say, though, I loved those buffalo ranch McChickens. I can just take off mayo, add ranch, and get a pack of buffalo sauce but I thought having buffalo in stock in the back was a good idea."
McDonalds,3cyygu,forensikat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:00:42 2015 UTC,"I have noticed chicken LTOs fail frequently at our store.   In fact, our store still has 6 un-opened cases of selects.  Part of it may just be a lack of effective advertising for the selects and HnS, or just limited demand for chicken (although the regular mchickens fly by the dozens.).      Although I am curious to see how the new Buttermilk Chicken pans out.  The allergen concerns do worry me though."
McDonalds,3cyygu,TehWildMan_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:14:37 2015 UTC,"That's why I stick by the keep it simple rule. People want their dollar chicken or burger sandwiches. If they spring for fancy, they'll go to a nicer restaurant. At least, that's what I've seen in my area, though the sirloins are doing surprisingly well.   I haven't heard of the buttermilk chicken. It sounds good, but probably won't do as well as the regular mcchickens. I still get people coming through asking if we have selects, which we got rid of two years ago. I personally think the strips are a great idea, but the nuggets are a classic and sell much better."
McDonalds,3cyygu,forensikat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:17:59 2015 UTC,"Our store just ran through the last sirloins last weekend (in the us, they were supposed to be a six-week LTO like selects, but were extended).     Selects were put up in direct competition against our own nuggets, however the price difference was massive.  Turns out we had a lot of people who wanted to see selects back here, but not many actually willing to buy them.   They ended up seeing a similar problem that the mighty wings expirement showed: they are good fresh, have a limited holding time, are weakly demanded, and take forever to cook, and we ended up with a s**tton of extras.  The buttermilk chicken is a replacement for the old crispy chicken, in a similar fashion to how we swapped the grilled chicken out.  Sorry about the confusion."
McDonalds,3cyygu,TehWildMan_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:21:07 2015 UTC,"Ahh, I'm guessing you're not in the US, then (I'm in Ohio)? I remember when I went to Europe and I saw the chicken selects were still available there. I've had a few people tell me they want to see the sirloins stay. They're few and far between, but the people who do like them LOVE them!  I never thought it was a good idea for McDonald's to go into the wing business. If people want wings, they'll go to a wing place. It didn't surprise me the Mighty Wings were phased out. But that chicken sounds really good, I hope we get that here.  This is all very interesting to me, as a PR/Marketing major. McDonald's is a great example of trial and error products!"

I was gone when the selects came and didn't come back until after they went. I know our store got rid of them relatively quickly."
McDonalds,3cyygu,forensikat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:32:25 2015 UTC,I got to try the buttermilk crispy last week and it is SO much better than our current crispy. The breading reminded me a bit of the select breading.

The #2 meal is special as in it comes with 2 sandwiches within its meal.   First of all, as you only ordered the burgers, you did not get the meal. That means you were charged for a total of 4 cheeseburgers ,no meal. The meal would have came with fries and a drink and normally costs 4.99-6.99 each  You did not look at the board closely enough ( maybe too hungry ! ) as for every single meal there are 2 prices, one for the sandwich only and one for the meal. Therefore the only problem is I think you assumed that it still came with 2 cheeseburgers even without the meal for 1.19. It's 1.19 per sandwich.  I hope that answers the question.."

Also, I cannot make the cone like the cone on the picture on the ice cream machine. And speaking of the ice cream machine, I am convinced that it strives to be a nuisance to the crew as well as to customers. In the past two weeks, it has broken down at least twice."

However, it is pretty dumb as a policy considering it's your own time, and it's limited, so if you're in a situation in which you are on break but it's very busy, always staying at the back of the line could result in you wasting like 15-20 minutes of your 30 minute break not even eating your food, which sounds pretty dumb to me."

I one got into a recurring altercation over the span of a month with this really fucking crazy indian guy who would come through and ask for a small coke (no ice!! no ice!!) and 10 packets of honey. He would whip out this 6 month old receipt from the day shift (I work graveyard) where they gave them to him for free, and try to argue his case.

McDonalds,3cn77x,forensikat,3,Thu Jul 9 10:35:45 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure we're a franchise and we charge 20 cents for extra sauce.   It used to depend on who was the manager (and if anyone was looking over your shoulder) as to whether or not someone would get charged. We had a few managers who hated the world so they'd charge for every little thing (even mayo and mustard!) and some that'd hand them out by the bucketful. If someone asked for one or even two, I would just grab some and give them out.  But now it's policy we charge for even one extra, though if someone's not looking or my store manager, who is really nice and generous is working, I'll just give them one.   So yeah, completely arbitrary and totally luck of the draw depending on who's working and what manager is on."

But yeah, if we're feeling nice and the store manager isn't around we'll just give give them out (unless you come through wanting like 5). So, same as everyone else here: it's arbitrarily enforced.  Most people ask for it after they've already gotten their food and are at the last window so I have to debate in my head how much I dislike them: is it worth it to hold up my entire line while I run around to find an open register and charge this guy for a packet of sauce?"

McDonalds,3cfau6,StyrofoamGlass,3,Tue Jul 7 17:41:34 2015 UTC,Don't know if that would be worth it. Pretty sure 2 liters would cost the store 50x more than whatever they pay for the bulk amount.
McDonalds,3cfau6,readypembroke,3,Wed Jul 8 03:37:19 2015 UTC,"For a situation like that, typically Coke will do same day emergency service. You can sell the coke from the 2 liters in the meantime and avoid the headache of angry customers plus you end up making money. Either you say sorry no coke and customer goes elsewhere and you get $0 or you spend a little money to continue making money at all. Its a crappy situation no matter how you slice it."

To wash dishes we had to heat up water in the microwave till it boiled. We had to have another mcdonalds make our tea and have someone go pick it up."

At the store I work at, the crew were allowed to eat our food during our breaks in the lobby.

I can't imagine being told I'd still have to work after something like that happened. My grandmother passed away earlier this year and I was able to call out a few days and my management completely understood.
McDonalds,3bp7an,rChutoy,4,Wed Jul 1 09:44:54 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that McDonald's isn't a single employer. It's around 2500 employers - that's roughly how many owner operator organizations there are. So that's roughly how many different sets of policies there are in the US McDonald's organization.  When I owned a couple small chain businesses (not McDonald's) I had a couple employees with deaths or other family emergencies, and I just sent them home and paid them anyway. You have to take care of family first."

If not the quality depreciates and you don't want that in the sandwich.  Was it fast? 35 second build time for most menu items. If you're a customer would you expect McDonalds to serve you a 4-5 star entrée within the span of 45 or so minutes? No, we're fast food.  Was the sandwich right to order? It's a big deal if you were to put a McChicken in someone's Quarter Pounder.

McDonalds,3b6wdb,TOSHINO_KYOUKO,3,Fri Jun 26 13:32:16 2015 UTC,"Normally, the people on the table should be calling out to you what is needed. For example; when they empty a tray of regular meat, they're supposed to call out ""Regular Meat"" or ""10-1"".  If they're not doing that, then watch the screen. Another example; lets say your tray of quarter meat only has 1 piece left. You see 2 double quarter sandwiches on the screen. So you should then make more quarter meat.    OR some stores will have a piece of paper that tells you what should be in the cabinet. Example; you want to know how much regular meat you need. You look at said paper say between 2PM and 5PM and it calls for 5 regular meats in 4 trays. It varies on your store peak times.  An added tip, always wipe down the grill and keep it clean. If you're using the Teflons, when you don't wipe them down then meat will start to stick to it."
McDonalds,3b6wdb,BardMusical,3,Fri Jun 26 15:17:02 2015 UTC,"To add to that: check the cabinets as well. Empty trays aren't always pulled or called out, and you might not hear everything."

McDonalds,3b6wdb,Tupples-,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:31:39 2015 UTC,"I have the same thing as OP, and it's NOT because they're too heavy. When I do it too much with one hand I end up being sore/hurting in the wrist. Just they way they are made I guess. I find they put a lot of strain on your wrist when you lift them with one hand. Hoping it will go away on its own after a while."
McDonalds,3b6wdb,McDKid,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:42:21 2015 UTC,"When you're on grill, you're ultimately in charge of how much stuff there is. Ask whoever's on the table stuff like ""how much 4:1 should we have at one time?"".   Then, keep an eye on the UHC. You should be checking it every few minutes to know exactly how much of everything you have. If you're supposed to have 4 4:1 at a time, then watch it to know when it drops too low and you need to make more.  Watch the screen too. If 15 McDoubles suddenly pop up, you should be making more 10:1 even if all your trays are full -- because they won't be full after all those are made."

I, however, do work in a restaurant. A very, very fucking busy restaurant. I was just like you, minus the crying, for a good couple of months. They will likely not fire you right away as anyone who's worked in the service industry has seen people like you before, and even seen then turn into amazing employees once they get used to it. It's what happened to me.  What HELPED me during the beginning stages was first; fucking breathe. Do whatever you need to do to calm yourself down. When your hands start shaking and you start trying to do fifteen things at once, narrow in on one SPECIFIC task and focus on it. One thing at a time. Stop thinking about being fired, about disappointing the managers and pissing off the customers. Don't worry about that. Especially the customers. People are fucking assholes and complain about everything because they know it can get them free food.  Anyway, if you do end up losing your job or you can't take it anymore and quit, don't beat yourself up. The service industry is seriously not for everyone."
McDonalds,3az56c,Falcon_Cunt_Punch,3,Wed Jun 24 18:33:16 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you're in the US.  First, have you done the register training? There's probably a training computer in the crew room - most restaurants should have one - and you can run through training on there. That might help some. It won't help you find products - that's too dynamic - but it'll help you be more comfortable.  If you're having problems, talk to your manager about it. Maybe they can give you different duties until you get used to dealing with the public that much so you don't have two things at once to freak you out, or put you on slower shifts for a while.  This last thing may be a generational difference - I'm probably older than your parents. I see people say ""I have social anxiety"" and stuff like that all the time. Do you actually have a diagnosis from a mental health professional? Because if you don't, stop saying that. What you mean is ""dealing with people makes me uncomfortable and I freak out.""   If you phrase it like a medical condition, it makes it seem like it isn't in your control. If you phrase it like a behavior, it is. Stop thinking of getting uncomfortable and nervous as a medical condition and it'll be easier to conquer it."
McDonalds,3az56c,ritchie70,2,Wed Jun 24 20:14:21 2015 UTC,"I haven't done any kind of training they just put me out on the front computers.

McDonalds,3az56c,ritchie70,3,Wed Jun 24 20:50:57 2015 UTC,"The training PC is a normal desktop computer but it should have a bunch of training stuff on it. I don't know a lot about it to be honest. You could ask about it.  You might seriously do better to think of this as something in your power. I used to be painfully shy. Still am sometimes. The thought of making a phone call sometimes fills me with terrible dread - more so than talking to someone in person, by quite a lot. But you've just got to do what you've got to do.  And you know, you get used to it. You can get used to anything. I had a job where a customer would usually basically cuss me out at least once a day. After a while, you just stop caring because you know they're just having a crappy day and they're blaming you."

The worst part of the job is the co- workers.  They either act like I don't exist or yell at me.  I would encourage you to stick with it and try not to get too discouraged.  I've only been working for a week and I've almost mastered the cash register:)  I also struggle with anxiety issues. It can literally take me up to 30 minutes to convince myself to get out of my car and go inside.  It's a constant struggle for me working at McDonald's, but it's getting better with time.

Our biggest complaint is the layout.   The main lunch screen has a lot of wasted screen real estate, and is cluttered with discontinued promos.   There are two pages for each the deserts and LSM items. All the items could fit onto one page per category, and could be labeled a lot better. Also, both categories are littered with discontinued items.   Our registers have 4 pages for breakfast items, plus the lsm items on the LSM2 page.  Most of these screens are full, but many items are broken (either inventory-wise or will prevent totaling) or discontinued.    Drinks are also a mess.  Even the sodas and teas are spread among many different pages.    I could go on and on.  NewPOS also lacks the ability to create seperate tickets on the same order, and taking large group's orders gets messy really quickly."

McCafe and regular drinks are separate and that helps me differentiate them.   Ice cream and baked goodies are separate and i like that.  we only have two breakfast menus as well.  once i got used to the entire layout, i started to really have fun with it.  the ONLY thing i really dislike is that I can't cosztomise a bunch of sandwiches at the same time. esp in a bundle box or something."

Regarding vomiting, I have a story.  A few  months ago, for whatever reason, I started feeling nauseous and asked to take a quick 5 min break from grill. I threw up violently in the crew restroom, and went back on the floor. Immediately, someone asked if I was feeling okay. Now this was around 11 on an 8-4pm shift. I told the team leader that I wasn't feeling well and had just thrown up. He replied: Well then, better rest in the crew room for a while. I stayed in the crew room while clocked in for about 20 minutes then decided to go home as I felt like vomiting again. As I finally clock out around 12 I end up vomiting a few meters outside the restaurant. Edit: if your store manager is treating you like this, talk to your regional manager or submit a personal action letter (PAL)"
McDonalds,3auznq,currentsc0nvulsive,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:33:09 2015 UTC,"I've thrown up multiple times before at work without being able to go home, so that's fairly normal. Usually I take 20 minutes and so to recover and keep on going. If I still don't feel good I just don't give a shit about anything or anyone, I do my job and nothing more.  Shit hitting the fan in my store means calling the general manager or regional manager and having them come fix things.  Power outage usually means the store being closed, simple as that. But TBH my store would have tried to keep going as much as possible as well, especially so close to close. We've never had one while I've worked there though.

McDonalds,3askwc,wmb0003,2,Tue Jun 23 04:19:06 2015 UTC,"At my store they actually did increase the prices by a few cents here and there on each size.  it's entirely possible however, that whoever was taking your order rung you up wrong. there is a special menu for us to place your drink order, and a LOT of newbies don't don't know how to do this unless they are told. I've cringed at some of the recites i've looked at where it's one large drink for 1.50  also, at wal-mart mcdonalds, there are dollar drinks (except for small)"

McDonalds,3askwc,tonyromojr,2,Tue Jun 23 10:49:28 2015 UTC,Ya this worker just didn't no what was going on. I ordered a nugget meal and she charges me for 6 nuggets and a drink. No fries. She even asked me did I want to upsize my fries.
McDonalds,3askwc,crawlywhat,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:54:41 2015 UTC,"yeah that would make me cringe. I work in a newly opened store with no crew trainers so i've been training most of the newbies on how to take orders, and honestly I've been pretty good at it. i ALWAYS instill in them that a serrate-from-meal drink is a different button!"
McDonalds,3askwc,syling,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:35:00 2015 UTC,"When you punch in a meal, you have to hit 'med' then the entrée. She probably hit the button but the POS didn't register it, which is why you were charged for just the 6pc nuggets and regular price for the drink (meals use the regular drink button, not the $1 drink). It's a common mistake but she should have caught it when the order was totalled."
McDonalds,3askwc,DanaBass,2,Tue Jun 23 13:22:50 2015 UTC,"Not all places have $1 drinks. At my Mcdonalds, the only $1 drinks are sweet teas."
McDonalds,3askwc,cerebralshrike,2,Tue Jun 30 22:10:22 2015 UTC,I've noticed that the McDonalds here that are inside hospitals and/or gas stations charge regular prices for their drinks. The only place I've seen dollar drinks are at the stand-alone stores.
McDonalds,3askwc,sherreh81,2,Tue Jun 23 04:57:09 2015 UTC,"Back when I managed at McD's, the dollar drinks were a' la carte only.  If you get it in a meal, you pay the full price as you are getting a deal with the meal.  Not sure if that is what was going on here though."
McDonalds,3askwc,TurkeyLurkey33,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:30:03 2015 UTC,"They went up. That's my line when people freak out about it, we charge like 1.79 for a large, small drinks are 99 cents."

McDonalds,3al8gk,moistbutter,7,Sun Jun 21 08:11:36 2015 UTC,"A single 50% discount on days you work for anything you want around $5 (I think it's technically supposed to be $5 or under but nobody really cares if it comes out under $10, and we usually give ourselves the discount anyway).  Sometimes if they're really super desperate they'll offer you a free meal if you get called in or something.  It's standard policy across all stores to not take any excess food -- it's supposed to be thrown away and logged as waste (that way people don't ""accidentally"" make stuff they don't need). Nobody at my store really cares though, I totally load up on the apple pies we have left at close.  Edit: Managers get free meals whenever and can give employees free meals for whatever reason they want."
McDonalds,3al8gk,McDKid,7,Sun Jun 21 09:52:37 2015 UTC,UK - all training is paid for. All employees working get a free meal with a desert. If you're not working you get a discounted meal that costs £2.99.

Which restaurants give a free dessert? We aren't even allowed water on our break  :S"
McDonalds,3al8gk,bluffroom,2,Fri Jul 10 12:31:06 2015 UTC,Wow. That sucks. McDonald's company policy entitles you to a meal. This can vary when it comes to franchisees

Bonus meals for call-ins or stay-over shifts are often given.      We also have a 40% discount, but the order must either follow the pattern of an extra value meal or an employee meal.  For that reason it is rarely used."
McDonalds,3al8gk,TehWildMan_,3,Sun Jun 21 08:24:41 2015 UTC,"Should have mentioned that this is a NZ store. Training was hardly even training, i was shown how to run the front for the first hour, then i was basically just working like i do normally for the next 5 unpaid hours."

The corporate store gave us a 50%-off meal every day, regardless of working. They also gave us a free meal on days we worked 5+ hours.  The franchise store only gave us a 50%-off meal for working a shift."
McDonalds,3al8gk,jenscoldmagic,2,Sun Jun 21 16:44:25 2015 UTC,"Denmark here We get a 25 % discount on all meals we buy, if we happen to visit the restaurant in our free time. If we have had a shift, we get a free paid meal of 85 DKK maximum (12.8 USD)  You are still working even though it is a training shift, so they have to pay you for it."

McDonalds,3al8gk,thisisnttheairport,2,Sun Jun 21 21:09:25 2015 UTC,"NZ: your store must pay you for those six hours, it is against your employment contract not to. If they don't after you bring it up with the Restaurant Manager/Franchisee, send a Personal Action Letter to Head Office.  In NZ McOpCo restaurants; this might differ if your franchised: - 10% at any restaurant with a MyRewards card you download from metime - when you're working, 50% off most boxed burgers (Big Mac, Quarter, Filet) + one portion of fries + one portion of dessert. No grilling allowed, unless it's to remove ingredients or swap out a meat portion with a tomato to make it vegetarian. Small postmix or Espresso Pronto are free and not included. Promo, Angus, other drinks not included. - overnight shifts, same rules as above but free.  - managers get free meals whenever and can pass the privilege on to crew as a rewards and incentives.  Cannot take any excess food, must be wasted and logged into myRestaurant - but you'll probably find you'll have some items you can take home. :)"
McDonalds,3al8gk,thisisnttheairport,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:57:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I posted this in r/nz and they basically just called me entitled, but ill ask my manager about the hours next time. Also, I never knew about the free fries amd drink rule, so all this time when ive been buying combos I could've just bought the burger and got free sides?"
McDonalds,3al8gk,McDKid,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:20:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I was unclear. The fries are part of the 1/2 price, small postmix drinks are free – so, it usually works out better to ring up the burger and fries, then get 50% off and pay for that, then just grab your free drink. Your store might have a different policy, though, if not a McOpCo store. :)"
McDonalds,3al8gk,thisisnttheairport,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:58:42 2015 UTC,swap out a meat portion with a tomato to make it vegetarian   wtf? People do this?

McDonalds,3ai8au,Loneliest_Man,4,Sat Jun 20 12:47:23 2015 UTC,You're not allowed Bar towels in the kitchen? What the fuck. Do other restaurants do this?
McDonalds,3ai8au,_christ_in_e,2,Sun Jun 21 00:55:33 2015 UTC,"At our store, the rule is ""No exposed towels"".   Towels, when not being actively used, can only be stored in the clean/dirty buckets, or in one of the designated trays under the assembly table.  Grill towels excepted during cleaning."
McDonalds,3ai8au,TehWildMan_,1 point,Sun Jun 21 08:32:17 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it's supposed to be the same way at my store (we have the buckets for a reason) but you can usually find a towel laying around somewhere to use.  Actually I would totally clean a lot more often if they were easier to find laying around.. when I come across one I naturally pick it up and start wiping stuff. But it's too much work to walk all the way over to the bucket and ring out a clean one, I only do that if I really need one or it's really slow.  Every so often I'll find a towel someone has left in a weird spot for an extended period of time (like on top of a fridge or other places you would never think to look) and it's completely dry since it's clearly been there for a few days. They feel so weird when they're dry because you never touch them when they're dry. They're always in the buckets or in the washer, both places are very wet.  Also, they're cool when left in the walk in freezer. Solid towels."
McDonalds,3ai8au,McDKid,1 point,Sun Jun 21 10:05:48 2015 UTC,It's the opposite at my store. We get in trouble for not having them in the kitchen because we are supposed to be cleaning when we're not busy
McDonalds,3ai8au,free_and_alone,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:44:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, wtf? What about grill cloths, you should at least have those?"
McDonalds,3ai8au,McDKid,1 point,Sun Jun 21 10:00:19 2015 UTC,Why are you not allowed to have towels in the kitchen? At my store we have a separate set of towel buckets just for the kitchen.
McDonalds,3ai8au,aar012,2,Sun Jun 21 06:05:59 2015 UTC,"We can use towels in the kitchen, but only when we are cleaning. So say I want to wipe the table.. Once I'm done wiping the table, I need to put the towel in the dirty bucket. It's dumb because you can run out of clean towels real fast and with our washing machine, it takes about 2 hours for a load. Just from wiping the table, the towel can easily be reused because it still looks clean (Unless you wiped down near the fried product area where the oil tends to get on those tables)"

Those nights suck."
McDonalds,3aekix,McDKid,1 point,Sun Jun 21 10:08:51 2015 UTC,"It gets worse at our store:  We only have 1 dt register with cashier functionality, located in back booth (The presenter registers can be logged into cashier mode, but can not do anything but recall/edit orders).  FC has two functional registers.  If lobby is open, if multiple cars are in drive, then the cashier has to run back every time to pay out orders.    We recently had a brand standards visit.  As expected, we were marked off for not having a cash-enabled presenter-booth register and a broken FC register."

McDonalds,3achw4,SadStrangeMess,8,Fri Jun 19 00:03:52 2015 UTC,"I started just like you did 5 years ago and now I'm a manager. Even now the biggest complaint I get is that I don't speak loud enough. Stick it out for at least 3 months. At least where I live that's your probation period anyway. If things aren't working out, you should know by than.  At my store we have a program on the computer that simulates the cash register. Ask if you have something like that which you can practice on.   Your trainer should not be yelling at you. That's inappropriate. If it were me I'd pull the trainer aside somewhere private and say something like ""Hey I know it's frustrating working with a new person who is having some trouble catching on. I'd really appreciate it if you could try to be more patient with me. You must have been in a similar situation when you first started. Do you have any tips on how I can become faster?""

McDonalds,3achw4,BLACKGUY981,4,Fri Jun 19 15:05:10 2015 UTC,"I can only tell you that it will get better as you get used to it more. I've been on both sides, as the new guy running around with his head cut off, and as a trainer trying to coach a slow person over and over again. I try to be patient with new people, but the job is super stressful and the new guys are the easiest thing to take the stress out on. I know it sounds horrible, but that's how it works.  So my advice? Stick it out. I hated the job so much when I started and contemplated quitting every day when I wasn't looking at the clock. You'll get better, and everyone will stop yelling at you then. At that point, you can be the boss and order people around. :P"
McDonalds,3achw4,Zeke2d,3,Fri Jun 19 00:28:10 2015 UTC,"I know plenty of people like this where I work who act similar to you who I would describe as meek and a tad slow. I wouldn't worry about it too much, your priority should be to fix the things that frustrate you. When I started front (after learning back) I couldn't understand which burgers were where and I kept wasting time while taking orders, so I just sat there when it wasn't busy and tried learning where everything was. If you ever need help you shouldn't be afraid to ask where things are and what needs to be done (your responsibilities that you might not know about) - This could include stocking up the coffee espresso beans. It's only your third day, your experience at mcdonalds can only get easier and more mundane. Focus on what frustrates you and start from there."
McDonalds,3achw4,_christ_in_e,3,Fri Jun 19 00:13:18 2015 UTC,"Tomorrow is my third day of work and I'm still struggling with doing things correctly.   That's totally okay. It took me a month or two to fully get the hang of things. It just takes time.   My trainer says I'm slow and I speak too softly   Once again, give it time and you'll get better. After a couple weeks you'll talk a lot more confidently and be more used to dealing with people.  Basically just give it time and you'll get more comfortable."

Up here, you don't get put on graveyard until you have at least a month under your belt.  Listen: Everybody finds it tough at first. Drivethrough can be a bitch - I got thrown into a dual lane for the first time on Halloween night.  Your trainer sounds like a bit of a bitch, to be honest."
McDonalds,3achw4,NorthBlizzard,2,Fri Jun 19 06:02:44 2015 UTC,"I used to work there. Yeah, it got better. You gotta find your niche. I was terrible at cook and front register, but I dominated the drive thru. We had a two lane drive thru and I still got great times.

You're gonna fuck up and you're gonna make people angry.   The thing is, that's how literally every job in the world is. Nobody goes in an expert. You just have to tough it out and honestly, man up.  I used to suck at this job when I started. But I kept doing it and I got better. At my store training lasts three days, you aren't even out of that yet.   Eventually you'll start figuring it out, and even better you'll start making friends with your coworkers. The relationships you build with your coworkers are the only thing that makes this job worth showing up to, so work on that part a lot."

I first apply a generous amount of butter on the grill, letting it warm up for 10 secs. I then place the chicken and apply the lid with water. When the timer is done, I flip it over and add more butter, browning it on both sides.   When the timer is done, I immediately remove it, as to not cause sticking and burning.   The final result is a perfectly cooked piece of chicken with a nice bronze char."

Then I take apart the McDoubles down the middle, and insert the McChicken inside. (I put in the McChicken without the bun that contains tomatoes, mayo and celery) I do this for the other McDouble and McChicken. Then I take off the top bun of the newly created ""McGangBang/McChubble/McDank/McClusterfuck"" and insert a third of the fries, and do the same with the other hybrid sand which. All that is left are two top McChicken buns, I take the remaining fries, and put it in between those two buns, making another sand which.

McDonalds,39q77r,Teufel9000,5,Sat Jun 20 21:23:18 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of anyone being fired for such trivial things as that. At my store, ONE person has been fired since I arrived (been there for around eleven months). The reason? He called in sick for a Saturday night shift and then showed up at the restaurant drunk. TWICE. He also smoked on the job (while he was clocked in and during a lunch rush, he grabbed a cigarette and went outside). Your reason for being fired is absurd, and I would file a complaint (if it's a corporate store) or talk to the owner (if it's a franchise).  I'm sure the manager will have a different side of the story, but if these were the reasons given for being fired (not your interpretation of your firing), you should pursue further action."
McDonalds,39q77r,gmrepublican,18,Sun Jun 14 04:59:21 2015 UTC,"Sorry that happened but it sounds you still have some growing up to do (don't take offense). If you are very young still it will not affect your record that much, do not worry about it. You can still use the reference since no one will really call to check with the restaurant.   She told you mutiple times to ensure you had enough fries ready, you didnt. She told you to mop the floor up and you did not do it correctly. Then you go on to complain about bad management... maybe, but maybe there is more to the story.  Being grown up means taking responsibility for your work and actions. I too would be annoyed if I asked an employee something and he or she did not do it despite me reminding them several times. On top of it you spilled your drink. At this point it seems like you are unreliable in which case you create more work than you produce. If this all happened today and it was a first occurrence she is in the wrong. But judging by your statement saying you want to quit and :   Now I understand why she hires literally everyone who comes in, because everyone quits or gets fired.   It leads me to believe there was multiple incidents where there was a conflict between you and management prior to today. Take this as a lesson in life: your employer is not your mom or dad who will have infinite patience to repeat endlessly to you to do something. And it gets worse as you progress in life. Learn to be responsible for your own actions. You were not fired because you didnt mop correctly or have enough fries. You were fired because she probably deemed you too incompetent to fulfill the job."
McDonalds,39q77r,dluminous,4,Sat Jun 13 19:09:15 2015 UTC,"The other managers liked me and my coworkers complimented me for learning fast. My general manager is someone that no one likes, she's thrown food at people and screamed during rush hours to the point that other customers hear her. I was still new and I got the hang of all of it fairly quickly after being taught. She just does not know how to manage the store and is unanimously hated between the staff. She passed by me during rush hour today and cracked when she saw me by coincidence not having one more batch of fries cooking."
McDonalds,39q77r,dluminous,3,Sat Jun 13 19:22:33 2015 UTC,Fair enough. But here's another life lesson: you do not choose your boss so sometimes you got to roll with it. So you may end up with a great manager or a shitty one (like you) and it sucks. But at the end of the day you knew she was like that so you should have been conscious enough to double ensure you did your job well when she was on the floor.
McDonalds,39q77r,dluminous,3,Sat Jun 13 19:32:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, you're right. I should have minded how my area looked when she was around.

Even when placing meat on the grill, my hands are no where near hitting the top platten."
McDonalds,39ni0s,TehWildMan_,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:31:28 2015 UTC,"Placing meat is the hazard under my managers procedure, which for grill crew who place patties two at a time, requires the two patties being placed simultaneously to be vertical. Like this.  4 2  4 2  3 1   3 1.   That pattern essentially requires one arm to be above the other when placing patties.  As a taller person, there is a lack of vertical space to avoid the uppers when placing the back pairs.  I have always used the following pattern, despite for being written up numerous times and suspended twice.  4 4   3 3   2 2   1 1"
McDonalds,39ni0s,McDKid,2,Sat Jun 13 02:35:19 2015 UTC,"This confuses me. What do the numbers there mean? And I still don't understand what grill you would have where you would touch the upper platen.  Also, how do you bring them down to 300?  However your manager says to do it is wrong. There's a specific order you're supposed to lay them in and pick them up in. I just pulled up the SOC for it: http://i.imgur.com/KI0u0rL.png  Edit: Welp I don't know anymore because looking at that picture from the SOC the numbers on there confuse me too.  Edit 2: Wait, I might understand it now. You use both hands to put down patties at the same time? This would never work at my store because they're always frozen together and after laying one we have to slam them against the grill to break the next one off."
McDonalds,39ni0s,TehWildMan_,2,Sat Jun 13 02:42:31 2015 UTC,"Responding to your edit, but generally a strong tap against the grill is enough to fully seperate a stack of 8, providing the case hasn't seen too many defrost cycles.  And some of the crew (myself included) place two-handed ( drop one from each hand, move hands, drop nezt pair, etc)"
McDonalds,39ni0s,Tamuff,2,Sat Jun 13 02:53:24 2015 UTC,"Dude. I can't stand when someone on the grill before you allows the freezer to run on defrost and not reset it. The meat becomes impossible to break apart. Especially the quarter meat. I can pound the shit out of them, they are just fused together it seems like. I remember one day a new person who got done on the grill didn't reset the freezer, so it's been on defrost for a good 2 to 3 hours.. I was over there pounding away on the meat, it was so loud a manager thought I was actually trying to break something. Even he tried to get the meat apart and couldn't."
McDonalds,39ni0s,McDKid,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:56:49 2015 UTC,"The numbers are which order you remove the meat from the grill, you can take two pieces of 10:1 meat off at a time and you do so in the order you laid the meat.   Edit: actually, looking at that picture again looks kinda confusing. This is the UK version: http://imgur.com/16NkIMA"
McDonalds,39ni0s,Tamuff,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:49:08 2015 UTC,That's how you take it off? How do you take two pieces off at a time? I have the spatula in one hand and the other... thingy in my other hand.

McDonalds,39ni0s,TehWildMan_,2,Sat Jun 13 09:33:00 2015 UTC,"I don't understand. You literally have your arms on top of each other? That sounds awkward as hell and very inefficient. What we do and how we're trained, is to place 4 pieces of meat in one hand while you hold the other 4 pieces of meat in your other hand. You place the 4 pieces on meat in your right hand down first, then place the last 4 pieces of meat that are in your left hand last. So you have 2 rows of 3 and 1 row of 2."
McDonalds,39ni0s,Tamuff,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:46:07 2015 UTC,"It is a very awkward  way of placing meat I know.   Also, are you using two or three  plattens grills for 10:1.    Two Platten grills have a lot more space to work with. Our store uses three platten Taylor grills."
McDonalds,39ni0s,Tamuff,2,Sat Jun 13 02:49:27 2015 UTC,We have 2 platten. I've never seen the 3 platten ones.. I'm assuming they're pretty much the same expect the 3 platten is longer to accommodate the third platten? How exactly would they have less room?
McDonalds,39ni0s,McDKid,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:54:09 2015 UTC,"Three platten grills have the same lower grill area size.  The plattens are thinner ,but extend farther out by a few inches, and each platten can comfortably fit a 2x4  grid of 10:1.   The back of the plattens are at a lower elevation on the 3s when open, and there is little room for error in placement."
McDonalds,39ni0s,currentsc0nvulsive,2,Sat Jun 13 02:58:16 2015 UTC,"So they're both the same, only one has thinner upper plattens? I think I know what you're talking about and we have one of those.. The upper plattens are run using hydraulics instead of the weights, yes? (Not sure if you've ever seen inside the grills. It's actually pretty neat) Even those you should have plenty of room to place meat without getting burned.  Edit: Nevermind I'm dumb. These are our grills we use http://mcd.manitowocfsusa.com/images/uploaded/mcd/products/garland/garland_mwe2w.jpg"
McDonalds,39ni0s,Figglypuff,5,Sat Jun 13 03:03:19 2015 UTC,What the fuck kind of store are you working at that doesn't have these gloves?!  How are you even passing the monthly health and safety audits you need to do once a month?   Get the rest of the crew to do the same. They can't not have these gloves.
McDonalds,39ni0s,Figglypuff,7,Sat Jun 13 01:29:50 2015 UTC,"We haven't had those gloves for the past 2 years. Never heard of health and safety audits. Is that something Cooperate does? Does it make a difference since I'm at a franchise? Since I've been at the store, there has only been maybe major 2 inspections. As a matter of fact, next Friday the store is going to have a major inspection. It's funny because when there are no inspections scheduled, no one cares how the store is ran. Managers slack off, crew slack off. No one gives a fuck. But when it's time for an inspection, everyone is so anal about doing everything the correct way. I always say to my co-workers ""If we did things the right way all the time, we wouldn't have to be running around like chickens with their heads cut off"""
McDonalds,39ni0s,Figglypuff,2,Sat Jun 13 01:34:07 2015 UTC,"There's a monthly health and safety audit that the business manager should do. Franchisee or their area manager must do one once a quarter. And McDonalds franchise consultants should complete one annually.   I should point out I'm in the UK, so it may vary. If you can poke around in the office and you should see a huge folder with health and safety written all over it."
McDonalds,39ni0s,McDKid,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:40:18 2015 UTC,"I'm in the US. I'm willing to bet UK Mcdonald's are much better ran than US ones. Not saying all US stores are shit, but the one I'm at is shit. Franchise owners are really cheap. I've been there for almost 4 years. When I was in orientation, I was told every 90 days or so I would be evaluated and be given a raise if passed. I haven't gotten one evaluation period at all. As a matter of fact, no one in my store has gotten one because the owners refuse to dish out the extra 10-25 cents an hour."
McDonalds,39ni0s,McDKid,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:43:35 2015 UTC,My store doesn't have special gloves either. I just thought that was normal.  After burning my hand really bad the other week I've tried to adjust how I clean them and keep a thing of burn stuff in my locker.
McDonalds,39ni0s,McDKid,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:37:57 2015 UTC,"That's completely fair. you have to have the big heat resistant gloves to do the grills. how do you pass your audits, etc.???"
McDonalds,39oy1h,waspentalive,4,Sat Jun 13 10:10:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it is a stupid policy, but the till doesn't actually have an option for three separate orders. I suppose it's possible to take one order, total it, and start a new one, but management probably doesn't want you doing that since it messes with their car count statistic. There's nothing against you driving around though, probably just the employee being lazy."
McDonalds,39oy1h,Zeke2d,2,Sat Jun 13 14:51:44 2015 UTC,"At least on our POS there's a ""multi-order"" option to do this. It'll combine the separate orders on the KVS and say ""multiple"" so you can see they all go to the same car.  As seen in the last two orders in this picture: http://i.imgur.com/F0tYawz.png   Blue “Multiple” icon in order cell header when an order taker groups multiple orders going to the same car; a straight vertical line separates each individual order.   It also works for more than two but our store has the same policy, to only do two orders per car."
McDonalds,39oy1h,McDKid,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:24:34 2015 UTC,"I always see that, but I don't know how to do it and I'm always afraid I'll mess something up if I try.   Any simple instructions for it?"
McDonalds,39oy1h,Amarelas,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:41:35 2015 UTC,Just press it before you start taking the second order and it'll group it with the first one on the screen.   It'll automatically turn off the next time you take an order so if you want to do more than 2 you have to press it again.  You still have to cash each one out separately.
McDonalds,39oy1h,McDKid,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:16:38 2015 UTC,"I had assumed that the two orders per drive in visit was to prevent one car from gumming up the works for other customers. That does not actually explain thought why I could not go around for the third order.   For brevity I did not originally say, but the clerk actually 'checked with management' before telling me I could not drive around."
McDonalds,39oy1h,YellowPumpkin,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:24:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah there is a reason for the two order max per car, but the drive around thing is bull.

I can understand the value of having three separate orders and keeping the change straight but if those people are actually that picky about getting exact change when you picked them up food they need to pull it together.

However, the person that was in charge of our orientation was about 30 mins late so.. but she just handed us these folders that had the paperwork we had to fill out, there was a W-4 form that we had to fill out.. there was a packet that was just a stack of stapled papers like tests in school are but it just the basics and going over the rules and policies, cleanliness of the restaurant, etc. etc. and then we had a break. After the break, we just continued learning about the same stuff. When it was over, she just asked us some questions about what we went over to make sure we were paying attention. I don't know if it depends on location or not but I didn't get my uniform at orientation. After orientation, I was told to take all of the paperwork I filled out and take it to the manager of my McDonalds so I went in and dropped it off and my manager gave me a day to go back and watch videos. The videos were basically just long interactive PowerPoint presentations and they were so boring. I was there for about 4-5 hours watching videos.. we were supposed to get our uniforms when we showed up to watch videos but they were late getting in so we got our non-slip shoes and that was it. After watching the videos, my manager told me that she would call me whenever my uniform came in but I never got a call from her so about 4 days later, I called her and asked if my uniform came in. That day, I went down to my McDonalds and got my uniform and schedule. I've been working since! Hope I was able to help you out some, I'm sure it probably differs a little bit based on location and there were 21 people at my orientation and a co-worker of mine only had, like, 8 people at hers and I've seen someone on here say they only had 3 at theirs, including themselves so I guess it really just depends on how many people are there too that'll dictate how long you're there for orientation but that's what mine was like."

Ours definitely has a POS simulator that works offline and I've played around with it a bit, but the resolution is screwed up or something because the window goes off the screen and I can't minimize it in any way, so I can only use the like top left of the POS, which sucks.  Any ideas on how to get stuff off of it?  Edit: I believe all the stuff is on something called NABIT. After some effort I have somehow found myself in the deep dark depths of McDonald's resources, in which I have found a crapload of information and stuff. I mean, I found equipment calibration information, equipment installation & programming instructions, LTO's and execution manuals, all SOC's, the entire like 400 page operations & training manual, basically everything except a POS simulator is on this site...

The configuration is done at the time of cashier login.  OP's is set up as a dedicated casher (lack of a ""reset selected cod"" button)  Also, about the menu layout, it appears to be standard with no Southern Chicken sandwich, and powerade/lemonade fountain drinks.

McDonalds,38hptx,azisnomarsa,2,Thu Jun 4 14:09:50 2015 UTC,"Crew Trainer who is one of the best our store has, but also has run out of fucks to give here,   DO NOT listen to your trainees when they tell you things like ""I worked at another McDonalds"" or ""I know the menu because who doesnt?""  Make them study the screen until they can prove they know how to ring up.   If they're too persistent, let them ring up without any intervention and watch them crash and burn, THEN come in and save the order. Make an example out of this for maximum effect. The nice way to say ""Stop acting ratchet"" is ""Sometimes the way you say something may not sound like you think it does.""  This may be area specific. I work in Baltimore fairy close to the City, so I end up encountering this struggle often.     NOTE: This is still a work in progress. If your trainee has too big of an ego, make sure you tag on ""it's not hard"" or ""It's pretty simple"" in a friendly/helpful way to every task (some being legitimately difficult) as you teach them so it starts to make that knowitall attitude fizzle out as they mess up.  Test them on the common stupid customer orders like:           McDouble extra cheese (Double cheeseburger) Sausage Egg McMuffin NO EGG (Sausage McMuffin) Sausage and Egg biscuit meal ADD CHEESE (we have a SEC biscuit button that's not a numbered key)  BEC McMuffin (BEC Biscuit SUB muffin) Might not be the same in your POS Number 1 (breakfast) With Eggwhites and white cheese (this is literally an Egg White Delight or number 3)    Last, I always drill into my Trainee's heads the following: ""Customers are idiots. They do not know what they want, so you have to know what they want for them.""  Fun observation on the last one: Every trainee who ""gets"" what I mean ends up making it, but the ones who get super shocked/borderline offended by that statement NEVER last.   Hope that helps. Good luck and hopefully your store is better managed than mine when it comes to how training is handled."

McDonalds,38hptx,ambiguousem12,1 point,Thu Jun 4 09:23:07 2015 UTC,The biggest thing that helped me when I was nervous about training someone was to remember that I know my stuff. I've worked at mcdonald's for a while and my manage wouldn't have made me a crew trainer if he didn't really believe in me.   When I'm actually training I try to really encourage the trainee to ask questions because I know when I was trained I was super shy. I also give them my cell number in case any questions come up later (however we also had a work group chat that I basically ran so I'm not sure I recommend this for everyone).  Basically just do your best! You can always review the flyers/SOCs in case you forget a procedure or detail and managers are there to help. Good luck and congratulations!!

It's more about coaching I found. When I work my shifts now I try to spend some time with people who might be struggling and just give them any tips and explain any procedures we have. As for training I found it helps to just be understanding and not be an asshole because we were all new and its easy to make mistakes that seem stupid to people who've been working for a while

McDonalds,38anta,MistrCreazil,5,Tue Jun 2 23:55:47 2015 UTC,"I understand the issue and it is frustrating, but please keep in mind that the people working in the restaurant have zero control over the pricing or what they are able to ring up on the registers, and that prices vary from location to location.   Have you tried purchasing the 20 piece meal that includes 2 large fries and no drinks? When customers don't want drinks but do want fries that is the combo I recommend.  I think the company doesn't offer the 20 piece as a single meal because it was never intended for a single person to be eating 20 chicken nuggets. If you follow that logic it does make sense to have the double combo available."

Especially if I've been at work all day and missed lunch.   My neighborhood shop shouldn't arbitrarily decide what I can and can't have as a damn meal by setting it up in such a way that I'm punished for ordering it for myself once in a blue moon."
McDonalds,38anta,TehWildMan_,0,Thu Jun 4 05:41:10 2015 UTC,"Their intention is to make money.  Whatever it costs to bump mediums to larges should be able to occur in order to,  ahem,  make more money."
McDonalds,38anta,Figglypuff,2,Wed Jun 3 21:56:18 2015 UTC,"It could be that the register does not have a valid price for a 20nugg2meal large size.  At our store, that was (no longer offered) a promotional deal, and the price for the large version was 99.99$.  The 20piece meal for one follows the same pricing rules with other value menu items."
McDonalds,38anta,Figglypuff,-1,Wed Jun 3 00:29:50 2015 UTC,"Let's just break the price down of the ""promotional""  deal.   20 piece -  $5  Two LARGE drinks - $2.  Two medium fries -  Can both be had for $3? Because that's a hell of a ""promotion.""   Sell me more shit at regular price please.  Also,  I'm unable to just get a 20 piece meal as itself.  It's either just the nuggets,  or two medium fries and drinks."
McDonalds,38anta,Figglypuff,2,Wed Jun 3 00:36:28 2015 UTC,"Large drinks, when and where they are not on promotional deals themselves, are roughly 1.79$.  Mediums are 1.49.  So using my stores current pricing we have:   20 nuggets: $5 2 medium drinks $3. 2 medium fries at $1.99 each: $4  That comes out to 12$ at regular prices. Large drinks and fries would raise that by 1.20$"
McDonalds,38anta,tsumeone,-7,Wed Jun 3 00:40:32 2015 UTC,A large drink here has been a cool dollar for years now. I've never seen a large drink anywhere close to me for over a buck.   Unless it's in a Mcd's on a toll road.   Then everything is jacked.
McDonalds,38anta,crawlywhat,2,Wed Jun 3 00:44:01 2015 UTC,"No what he means is that the dollar drink is a promotional price. They aren't allowed to input promotional prices in meals and therefore the system rings it up as the regular large price of about 1.79. Even though if you buy a large drink outside a meal it is $1, that is not actually the regular price. It's just a promotional price and the cashier needs to ring up a promotional item under the drink tab, which is not allowed for meals."

McDonalds,38anta,Figglypuff,-4,Thu Jun 4 05:17:41 2015 UTC,"My logic isn't faulty if a dollar large drink is what I've always known,  and it's what the price of ordering it separately is.  So,  uh,  explain to me how it's faulty logic,  guy."
McDonalds,38anta,Figglypuff,2,Thu Jun 4 05:23:58 2015 UTC,"Ok so I assume you don't work at a McDonald's, but to explain it, the dollar large drink is a promotional special. Even though it's been going on for years at many locations it is still a special price. It's a long term special, but it is a special so that it can be optional by location, franchise etc.   I assume you don't work at a McDonald's but if you just enter a large drink it rings it up as 1.79 or so depending on your region. But no trained employee ever rings it up like this, they enter the specials menu under drinks to select the special dollar large drink. But since it is a special, and specials are not allowed to be included in meals the software rings it up as the non promotional price of about 1.79. So even though whenever you order a large soda that isn't part of a meal it is only 1 dollar, that does not mean that 1 dollar is the regular price for that item."

McDonalds,37xdgd,westroop,4,Mon Jun 1 03:35:14 2015 UTC,"I would like to inform you readers about the company that supplies McDonalds with their meat; Cargill. This company neglects to report injuries, dismisses employee's who bring up safety issues, and is responsible for extremely large numbers of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. In fact, if you have ever worked at a Cargill beef processing plant, employee's are forced to keep with the ""line speed"" and over 90% of the long-time employee's suffer from severe arm and hand pain or absolutely ruined wrists (as in unable to type, unable to hold a cup, etc). Ironically, the majority of them are also uneducated and speak English as a second language. Considering all of McDonalds meat comes from Cargill (as do the burgers for Wendy's and A&W), when you support these businesses you are supporting slave labour in North America.  Being in the international company Cargill is, it is also noteworthy that while the ""days without injury"" is relatively low in North American plants, it is in the thousands in 3rd world countries. Do you really think no injuries occur in those countries that lack Human Resource departments and Government legislations protecting workers? Even in countries with these policies in place, Cargill straight up lies, uses illegal and unethical practices and attempts to claim no responsibility when their workers are injured.  ."

McDonalds,37ujsg,darkness_and_despair,3,Sat May 30 14:50:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly, overnights are shit and if it's been really dead, like no orders for an hour, sometimes changeover will happen early depending on who the manager is. It's also possible the morning you went in and got food at 4, changeover had already happened and they just held on to all the leftovers. And as to the 24/7 drivethrough thing, while it is open 24/7, a ""close"" and ""open"" still has to happen. It was probably done earlier than it was supposed to and they didn't want to make any more orders before the day shifters came in. Also, the ice cream machine ""breaks"" because it hasn't been cleaned and won't work properly until it has, and it's a hassle to do. As Irishpotato said, this is all speculation without knowing where you are or which McDonald's you're referring to, but it's mostly run by minimum wage workers, who aren't payed enough to give a shit."
McDonalds,37ujsg,YellowPumpkin,2,Sat May 30 17:05:24 2015 UTC,At my store we usually do full breakfast changeover 15-20 minutes early so that us overnighters can get out on time. I miss starting breakfast at 3 instead of 4.
McDonalds,37ujsg,Serventdraco,2,Mon Jun 1 22:45:17 2015 UTC,"The reason they only accept cash sometimes during the overnight is because at some point in the night they have to ""reboot"" all the machines into the next day. It takes about 15-30 minutes and you have to manually calculate all the costs , including tax...   Yes hours vary by store, 80% of McDonalds stores are owned by independent franchisees and that's why."
McDonalds,37ujsg,Juicy555,2,Sat May 30 17:00:46 2015 UTC,"At our location (US) breakfast items begin at 4 am. We are open, both lobby and drive-thru, 24/7. It should be noted that we just switched back to regular menu for overnights...for the past year (?) or so we had been serving the ""after-midnight"" menu which carried some regular menu items as well as biscuit sandwiches and hashbrowns. There is a brief period of time that every store that runs overnights will accept only cash. Our POS (Point of Sale) system has to shut down to officially record sales and inventory to transmit and during that time registers and cashless devices will not be in use. A well-practiced overnight manager should be able to bring the system back up in 10-15 minutes with no technical issues. The ice cream machine is tricky, both because I 100% believe that it could really be down but also that I believe even slightly that a lazy crew person or manager just didn't want to make shakes/ice cream. The machine in our restaurant breaks down quite a bit for a variety of different reasons and it is very frustrating both as an employee and also as a customer (I love ice cream lol). I'm not sure about breakfast hour variance. A 24/7 restaurant will on rare occasion close for a few different reasons, the most likely of which was probably hood cleaning which happens on a scheduled basis. There's always a crazy chance they didn't have water and weren't allowed to be open or something like that."
McDonalds,37ujsg,That_Weird_Girl,1 point,Sat May 30 18:18:43 2015 UTC,The ice cream machine goes into heat mode from 2-6 every night. There's nothing we can do about it
McDonalds,37ujsg,Amarelas,2,Thu Jun 11 20:22:06 2015 UTC,"Location would be helpful. I don't do overnights but at my store, from midnight to 5am, we have a ""night"" menu, in which there is a mixture between both breakfast and lunch items (obviously not the full menu, but the most popular things)."
McDonalds,37ujsg,TehWildMan_,2,Sat May 30 20:54:00 2015 UTC,"At our store (corporate), the following applies.  The after midnight menu applies between midnight and 4, and full breakfast after 4.  Our crew will push breakfast after 2 or so, as we already will have pulled most of the remaining lunch equipment for cleaning and storage.    Due to the way our system works, and end-of-day procedure has to be processed every night.  During this time, all cash must be accounted for, and the backend goes offline to record inventory, events, etc.     The registers and kitchen computers often have to be updated, but thankfully it appears this can happen without a complete reboot (but without an active backend, they can't do anything).  This saves time in that respect, whereas it used to be that we were waiting on computers to update before beginning the new day.  The ice cream machine we use has to either be dumped out and brushed cleaned every night, or filled up and heat-treated every night (with mandatory daytime brush cleaning twice a month).  Heat-treatment takes a few hours to complete, including a mandatory hold period at high temperature.   Since nights and breakfast is the slowest time for ice cream sales, it makes logical sense to perform heat-treatment during this time.  Our machine is set to go into heat at midnight, and if heat-treatment completes successfully, will return to cold standby around 5am.  However, it has a tendency to fail once or twice on a daily basis.  There are situations where the whole store must be shut down for the night.  This can include vent/hood cleaning (quarterly), planned equipment maintenance/installation (happens a few times a year), planned cleaning (before major inspections), or being critically short staffed."

The chicken will be diced into 12-16 pieces instead of 4 strips.  Bacon bits for the ranch salad are discontinued, although stores will have stock to last quite a while (assuming /u/TehWildMan_ doesn't accidentially drop a cambro full of them).  Instead, 3 halfs of bacon will be used, torn into bite-sized chunks on table.  This solves a problem where bacon bits were often held at room temperature for days before being used on salads.    Table assembly is simple.  I am not sure on the exact portion sizes, but our store is using two rail-spoons of the asain veggie blend, and roughly 8 orange slices, along with the diced chicken.    EDIT:  Forgot that an orange glaze will be applied on the chicken.   The stock dressing is a mcdonalds-exclusive packaging based off Newman's Own Sesame Ginger, and sliced toasted almonds are included with the salad."

If you're out back expect it be hot, stressful, sometimes sticky, and to have front counter on your ass. If you're in back booth (drive thru OT/Cashier) expect it to get cold (they should provide a jacket or allow you to wear yours) and lonely. If you're out front, expect alllll the customers to blame you for eeeeverything. but honestly, have a positive attitude and it won't be tooo bad"
McDonalds,37jzcl,currentsc0nvulsive,3,Fri May 29 21:39:03 2015 UTC,"Just follow what you read in the McHand book. They will put you on line straight away to observe how well you learn from the book, and what your strengths are and assign you to service or kitchen accordingly.   You do not get paid for this training."
McDonalds,37jzcl,hazardash,7,Thu May 28 04:30:19 2015 UTC,"There are two kinds of McDonald's: Corporate owned and franchised.  Each franchise operates as an independent company so the answer can vary to any question regarding employment practice. With a corporate store, you will receive policies and learn about some basics at orientation and then you should be trained and observed.   Regardless of Corporate vs. franchise stores, you should be paid for ALL training and work time.  If you have not been paid, contact McDonald's HR Consulting at 877-623-9150."
McDonalds,37jzcl,krico,3,Thu May 28 06:35:55 2015 UTC,"This may have happened to you but this isn't what happens at every McDonald's, or even the majority.

McDonalds,37faga,StyrofoamGlass,3,Wed May 27 13:48:29 2015 UTC,"Its an interesting problem as the dispensers for mayo are designed to dispense a specific portion (1/2oz) per shot. Ideally, that should prevent inconsistency from happening.  Of course, it isn't perfect although I think personal preference may have something to do here."

McDonalds,37cge9,TickledStink,3,Tue May 26 16:42:17 2015 UTC,Probably what gave you any hint of flavor on the sirloin is the vague beef seasoning sprinkled on the patty right before they shut the box and put it in the bag.

McDonalds,37c5j7,TTausch,3,Thu May 28 03:48:28 2015 UTC,"It's a new roll out of procedures that are aimed at lowering complaints, food cost, among other things. It's worked wonderfully in my store from purely a dt perspective."
McDonalds,37c5j7,BiggerThanAnAnt,2,Thu May 28 12:44:59 2015 UTC,"When taking the order in the drive thru COD, once they have completed their order, the employee must read back the ENTIRE order and CONFIRM that it is correct with the customer (Ask) . At the second windows they will read back the entire order and confirm that it is that party's order once again (Ask) . Lastly, when handing the party their food, the employee must (tell) them their entire order before handing it to them. At my store it has greatly increased accuracy, we still make mistakes of course but not as many."
McDonalds,37c5j7,BiggerThanAnAnt,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:07:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I learned about this the past week. No one at my store does this. When they're told to do it, they get all defensive and angry. It's funny to watch because someone in front counter took a 100 dollar order, didn't read anything back to the customer. All hell breaks loose with confusion.. Then when it was all said and done, the manager simply told the cashier ""You need to read the order back exactly so stuff like that doesn't happen"" the cashier got real angry and threw a fit."
McDonalds,37c5j7,TehWildMan_,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:30:30 2015 UTC,My people department manager threatened to take hours away from people who weren't doing it one night. And she made mistakes throughout the night afterward. It was pretty funny to watch.
McDonalds,37c5j7,McDKid,2,Thu Jun 4 06:55:28 2015 UTC,"Our store is doing the same, but using unmodified blue UHC trays (only kind we have extras on right now).  The ideas behind this is that the stickers have an annoying habit of falling off or slipping onto the wrong item.  Finding that one special in a pile of regulars can be a huge hassle.   Breakfast shift is worse: occasionally a buffer of common items is created, and breakfast crew usually doesn't bother marking specials."
McDonalds,37c5j7,TehWildMan_,2,Tue May 26 19:56:29 2015 UTC,Your store doesn't have any extra trays?  I can't even tell you how many I've broken because someone has one pulled out a little and I push one in from the other side without looking first.
McDonalds,37c5j7,Serventdraco,1 point,Wed May 27 08:37:46 2015 UTC,"In preparation for an inspection or something, we recently replaced the entire set of UHC trays, and some manager had the brilliant idea of discarding the old ones instead of keeping a few in the shed.    However the replacement set only consisted of 4 grays, 4 whites, 2 yellows, 8 amber, 4 blue, 3 amber flats (1/3 size),2 (2/3size) nugget flats, 3 biscuit trays, and 2 white flats.  During breakfast, every single one of those except 2 blues is in use, and most get carried over to lunch without cleaning.  In fair defense, most of those that we discarded had seen well over one or two years of usage."
McDonalds,37c5j7,TehWildMan_,1 point,Wed May 27 10:52:02 2015 UTC,LOL.. I have done this a couple times.. I have to say that it never gets old. I laugh every time even though I didn't intentionally do it. lol Push a tray in and then all a sudden you hear this huge bang.. Good times.
McDonalds,37c5j7,StyrofoamGlass,2,Thu May 28 03:47:42 2015 UTC,My store is doing this because we're getting new landing zones that have dividers. Special orders are supposed to go to one side and regular sandwiches go on the other on the new ones. The tray is supposed to get the assembler in the habit of sending special orders to one side.  Don't know why your store chose to break a tray.
McDonalds,37c5j7,Eric10956,1 point,Tue May 26 21:39:54 2015 UTC,The store probably broke a tray because they had extras and a full tray doesn't fit nicely into the HLZ.
McDonalds,37c5j7,currentsc0nvulsive,2,Tue May 26 21:56:05 2015 UTC,Sounds like it means they broke 2 fish trays for no reason.

McDonalds,37c5j7,McDKid,2,Tue May 26 22:51:44 2015 UTC,"The wire trays? That has to have an impact on speed. You're supposed to just be able to just slide it in, not walk over and place it in."

Granted, I work at a smaller McDs so I can get away with some things. For example, I rearranged all the condiments in the kitchen to make it easier to get to.

McDonalds,36z4tz,Jon-Connington,8,Sun May 24 10:09:48 2015 UTC,"Suck it up. You applied for the job. We had a Brand Standard Visit which lasted 8 hours the other day, and I did fries for the whole 8 hours. Minus break. Yes it's not nice, but someone has to do it."
McDonalds,36z4tz,Jon-Connington,2,Sat May 23 12:33:17 2015 UTC,"Was pretty relaxed to be honest. Are you in the UK? The woman who did it was doing it for her first time, as they don't do those FOR's anymore.   She asked a few of us questions, and checked the bottom of our shoes. She just walked around for about 6 and a half hours with a tablet marking everything."
McDonalds,36z4tz,majambe,2,Sun May 24 02:31:03 2015 UTC,"I'd be more worried about them not giving you any break. Any shift lasting 4-8 hours means they're obligated to give you a 30 minute break.   I understand, fries can be stressful and all the heat and the oil and salt doesn't help it. You may have to accept however that this is what you have been dealt. Since you only work one day a week for 5 hours, there's a low chance of you being trained on other positions. Doing other jobs depends mainly on what positions are necessary and also how much free time managers and/or crew trainers may have. For example, my store is in dire need of service people, so that's where I was put, and since I work a full 40+ hour week, I got to be trained on everything service-related.  In short, I would talk to your People manager or General Manager about: 1. You not being given a break today, and 2. Your feelings about your position. If only to get a little clarity. And if there is room for them to train you on something different, the opportunity may arise. Chin up."
McDonalds,36z4tz,Serventdraco,2,Sun May 24 09:02:55 2015 UTC,I'd be more worried about them not giving you any break. Any shift lasting 4-8 hours means they're obligated to give you a 30 minute break.   Depends on where you live and if the store is corporate. According to our GM corporate policy is that you only need a break if your shift will be 5 hours or longer.  Other than that where I live there are no laws saying that employees get breaks.
McDonalds,36z4tz,SaiyanMaster95,1 point,Sat May 23 18:11:46 2015 UTC,"For where I am, any shift of 6 or more hours requires a break"

In my store you get a 35 minute unpaid break for any shift more then five hours. I think we're supposed to have 10 minute paid breaks but the managers say no. I used to work more, my availabilities say 3 shifts a week but they don't care. I usually get like 10 hours"
McDonalds,36z4tz,edELRIC90,2,Sun May 24 04:03:21 2015 UTC,"I had a similar experience when I started in kitchen. I'd do about an hour in kitchen watching levels before moving to lot/lobby for the rest of the shift (minus breaks). It sucks, but somebody has to do it. If you worked more often, they'd probably trust you to work other stations. As is, though, you're probably stuck there for a while."

McDonalds,36ylds,TehWildMan_,2,Sun May 24 08:56:34 2015 UTC,"The ""detectonics pens"" use an iodine solution as ink.  That ink doesnt react with the paper real currency uses, but will react (turning black) with everyday papers (due to starches).     IMHO, they are useless because it is relatively easy to fool in both directions. Modern us money has many other features that can be checked out."
McDonalds,36ylds,santaswrath,1 point,Sun May 24 13:29:10 2015 UTC,It's not required at every store but it helps. It's a counterfeit detector pen that you mark the bill and if it marks clear or yellow it passes and if it marks a dark color like brown or black its a fake bill.
McDonalds,36ylds,TehWildMan_,1 point,Sun May 24 16:39:08 2015 UTC,"Im now curious.  Having come across a few dead-obvious fakes (that felt/look ""off"" at first sight and looked more or less inkjet prints on resume paper), did that bill in question attempt to replicate the color-shifting and metallic emblems, or any other security features (watermark, plastic strip, etc)?"
McDonalds,36ylds,chaseoes,1 point,Sat May 23 21:24:10 2015 UTC,"No security measures were attempted. The bill was two pieces of paper glued together and thrown in a washer with some poker chips or some coins from what I can tell. Felt extremely thick to the touch, more like a worn out greeting card.

McDonalds,36res8,MurderIsRelevant,2,Thu May 21 14:59:11 2015 UTC,I don't Fucking understand them. McDonald's isn't a good career (unless you are a GM or higher) It's just a stepping stone until you get a better job.
McDonalds,36res8,cobraman115,1 point,Thu May 21 16:51:17 2015 UTC,"I heard they want 15 dollars. I think that's too much. Maybe 9-11 dollars is a better number. They already raised their hourly wage by a dollar at corporate stores only. Franchise store workers don't get anything, unless the franchise owners are willing to pay more. Which I highly doubt they are. I'm sure there are some that will, but not my franchise owners. They're cheap as fuck."

McDonalds,36rg7e,cobraman115,2,Thu May 21 15:14:32 2015 UTC,"I completely understand this policy. I was working the other night and had a homeless man came in and started asking my customers for money for food. We were busy enough that I didn't really have time to ask him to leave. But one gentleman said to order whatever you want and he handed him his card to use.  The homeless man orders $80. 46 in food. He literally tried to order one of everything.  After we started making his food, he said that he ordered to much and wants his money back. I said sure, but it has to go back on that gentleman's card. He got all pissed off and left."

McDonalds,36pfnq,aar012,3,Thu May 21 02:22:28 2015 UTC,"Are you busy throughout the shift? When I do overnights, we take breaks when it isn't busy (there are usually 5-10 minutes stretches without customers when we can relax). Even so, they give us free ""snacks"" during the shift (pies, ice cream, etc.) and a free breakfast at the end. Not a bad deal, and it makes up for the lack of traditional breaks. Do you get anything of this sort, or are you expected to work eight hours straight? If the latter is the case, I would take it up with a manager."
McDonalds,36pfnq,gmrepublican,3,Thu May 21 02:35:32 2015 UTC,"Payroll compliance is a huge thing in my store. Attached to every schedule is a break list (pretty much every scheduled person's name and a box next to it to check off once they are sent on break). Employees sign next to their name to when they go on break to verify that yes, they have taken their break and we didn't just checkmark it and not give them a break.   If someone stays late, we write in what time they worked until on the schedule. Not really necessary because if they clock in & out correctly they will be paid for what they worked. It's more a safety measure just in case, so the manager doing payroll knows how long to pay them for.   Any changes made to a crew person's hours on the computer need to be signed by the manager doing payroll & the crew person whose hours were manually changed to verify that the hours are indeed correct.   If you are not getting paid for the hours you worked that's 100% illegal and I would be contacting HR or employee services and filing a complaint. If they are doing it to you they are doing it to other employees too and that's not right. I think it's time for HR/accounting to do a surprise audit."
McDonalds,36pfnq,syling,2,Thu May 21 04:15:52 2015 UTC,"I work the graveyard shift. Our breaks are all paid here, and our food is all free.  You're far more difficult to replace than the day crew.

McDonalds,36pfnq,CynicLibrarian,2,Thu May 21 09:27:36 2015 UTC,"So are you not getting paid for the full time you work or are you not getting your breaks? That's 2 separate things, the former being illegal and the latter might be depending on what state you're in."
McDonalds,36pfnq,santaswrath,2,Sat May 23 05:12:25 2015 UTC,at my store if you work over 5 hours without a break you start getting the penalty rate
McDonalds,36pfnq,cara123456789,1 point,Sat May 23 10:12:32 2015 UTC,"Contact corporate HR if you need to (after trying to resolve with local management if possible).  At my store (corporate store), managers have a nasty habit of inserting breaks I never took or reverting my time punch to the schedule when I worked extra hours.    For this reason, I keep a pocket notebook with time punch receipts when provided and a handwritten log when not.  If I notice a discrepancy, I send a letter up to HR with the receipts and my phone's location history for the days in question.  From there, they add those hours to the next check.  Happens way more often that I would like, and management isn't happy about the backlash they get.  But sometimes, those 3 hours a week can mean the difference between eating and not eating the next."

McDonalds,36oof4,Amanda-rae,3,Thu May 21 06:14:39 2015 UTC,"Fish happens to be one of the highest-margain items (at a cost of roughly 40 cents each).  Beef and bacon on the other hand, take a look at the inventory  prices on those.  Its not pretty.  And the new grilled chicken patties cost roughly just as much as a 1/4lb beef.   In addition, over the past two years, beef prices for us have climbed almost/over 35%.    What shocked me most was the cost of coffee.  I always thought it would be expensive."
McDonalds,36oof4,TehWildMan_,3,Wed May 20 23:47:42 2015 UTC,This makes me even less likely to order a fish sandwich.  At almost 4 dollars the price is pretty ridiculous compared to the actual cost of the ingredients.  I miss living in a more Catholic part of the country where they had the fish sandwiches for $1 during lent.  They're good but not $4 good.

McDonalds,36d6gn,LFG_Hunter_A,5,Mon May 18 13:15:23 2015 UTC,It sounds like you guys are just throwing the food away instead of counting it. You have to write it on your waste sheet. If it isn't put in there it looks like it was stolen because there is a variance between how much you sold and how much you counted as waste.
McDonalds,36d6gn,cobraman115,1 point,Mon May 18 13:46:03 2015 UTC,This. They have to take out a sheet and count waste before throwing it in the bin.

McDonalds,36d6gn,santaswrath,2,Sat May 23 05:20:07 2015 UTC,like other people have said it's an inventory error. your production manager needs to do a better job at recording waste and checking inventory. it should be an easy fix but it's all on the production manager to follow up with that stuff.
McDonalds,36d6gn,sexi_boi,1 point,Mon May 18 18:36:14 2015 UTC,"Our store also has an inventory problem sometimes hitting a thousand nuggets a month, but beef is a more sane number (except for a few pounds of sirloin due to test runs and employee trials).  However, on the inventory stat reports, the two highest $ losses are sugar followed by ice cream mix (when the machine is working)  Those also happen to be items where we do not count waste at all.  Without counting waste, it is next to impossible to know how much sugar is being lost to drink refills, employee drinks, wasted tea, yield error, or if any is being straight up stolen.  In addition, our store locks down the promo key and has no other function for entering remakes.  Because of this, when something is remade without tossing the original into the waste bin, the remake becomes a stat loss.   This problem is compounded, as a HUGE portion of premium sandwiches (clubhouses, sirloins, etc) are made horribly wrong.  And that's before employee food.  We have a known problem of crew T-Red'ding employee meals from the register rather than a manager handling it.  And our store does not offer a discount other than the one break meal, so there is a strong incentive to steal."
McDonalds,36d6gn,TehWildMan_,1 point,Mon May 18 17:31:30 2015 UTC,my sisters stores managers were really angry because there was 1000 chicken nuggets gone. At my store the things often missing are sundae sauce because we're too generous to the customers lol
McDonalds,36d6gn,cara123456789,1 point,Sat May 23 10:02:17 2015 UTC,"Dude... Tell your owner. If that happened at the store I worked at, they'd be fired on the spot. Even eating one pickle is theft. Anything that gets wasted MUST be recorded. Manager meals must be entered through the register. Any manager meals that don't get entered is theft. Not entering waste is breach of management minimums. Any crew eating ANYTHING is theft and instant termination, even waste. Taking product home is definitely theft. Have had plenty of crew and managers fired for this.   Portion control is also a large part, as well as controlling waste. It's crews responsibility to follow procedures and managers to follow up that it is. Again, had plenty of people crew and manager alike fired for this. Losing any money on STAT is not acceptable, let alone that much"

Your best bet is to say you've taken a second job and that your schedule there is whatever times you don't want to be working at McDonalds."
McDonalds,369u1x,YellowPumpkin,2,Sun May 17 17:34:17 2015 UTC,Just ask to fill out an availability sheet. At my store we're not required to show proof of anything. We just ask for an availability sheet and fill out what days and times we can work. I think the only requirement is that you have to be available for 1.5X the hours you want. For instance if you want 40 hours a week you have to be available for at least 60.

McDonalds,35y7q3,curiousparallax,6,Thu May 14 14:39:33 2015 UTC,"I certainly empathise with you. I'm a Crew Trainer at my store that has put up with over thirty of our experienced crew (yes, thirty) quitting in the last three months. Our Restaurant Manager is awful towards the crew and promotes the wrong crew to management, because anyone with a brain in my store would rather not be a manager and deal with his wrath on a daily basis.  My store has become a bit of a joke on social media because of how badly our store is handing the customer load on weekends. We're of the busiest stores in my country, and we're trying to serve all the customers using new crew that can't handle the workload. Saturday mornings with ten minute cars in a dual-lane drive-thru, every weekend. Angry customers, angry managers and angry crew that are getting blamed for not doing better when the reality is that we're simply under-resourced for the output that we're expected to produce. Once upon a time everything was ok, but we were being treated badly. Try imagine how it is now that everything is going down the drain.  Anyway, this began about three months ago and I thought I'd try wait it out and see if there's a difference. Three months later we're still just as screwed and I'm left wishing that I left with everyone else. New crew are coming in and leaving quickly because they're seeing how bad it. It's becoming a bit of and endless cycle of hiring new crew, new crew hating new job, quitting and being placed by more new crew.   In your case, it's good that you're respected by the managers and such and that the people you work with are great. It's somewhat the same for me. However, if things don't improve quickly with your supervisor, and people keep leaving, I don't think anyone could blame you for following suit and leaving, especially if you can get a job close-by at one of those other stores. My former work mates did, no regrets.  I also apologise for all the text.  TL;DR my store is being run by incompetent managers and new crew that can't handle the excessive workload. Leave if you can."

McDonalds,353fwk,VirulentViper,3,Wed May 6 19:58:18 2015 UTC,Pay is biweekly. Orientation should be pretty simple if it was anything like mine. One of the managers just talks to you about expectations and shows you around the store and stuff. This is also when you get your uniform
McDonalds,353fwk,free_and_alone,3,Wed May 6 21:20:22 2015 UTC,"Ooh okay, thanks! I appreciate the response!"
McDonalds,353fwk,Shockwave0304,3,Wed May 6 21:35:27 2015 UTC,"As already said, pay is bi-weekly. My orientation I went to a small building on a different nearby McDonald's than the one I was hired into and got told what they expect and what it's like to work there, filled out all the required paperwork and tax sheets; tax information, direct deposit, etc.. I tried on my uniform there and was given my schedule. Took maybe 1 1/2 hours with 3 of us there."
McDonalds,353fwk,Shockwave0304,2,Thu May 7 02:19:08 2015 UTC,"Awesome, this helps out a lot. Thanks so much for the info! I have to meet with the manager again on Friday and I think he's doing the paperwork with me there? That's what it sounded like from the way he worded it."
McDonalds,353fwk,Shockwave0304,2,Thu May 7 02:22:07 2015 UTC,"Possibly. When I applied I was given a packet with info on what it's like to work there, rules, yadda yadda, and  all the forms we would fill out and was told to bring it to orientation when I went. I don't work at a corporate owned McDonald's so it could be different if you're being hired by a Corporate one instead of a franchise."
McDonalds,353fwk,redgroupclan,2,Thu May 7 02:31:11 2015 UTC,"Alright, cool. I know he told me to bring a photo ID but I need to get a new one so will I need that when I meet up with him on Friday or would I be okay if I got it on Saturday?"
McDonalds,353fwk,Shockwave0304,1 point,Thu May 7 03:30:43 2015 UTC,"I can't answer that one for you, you'd need to talk to him. I was told to bring a photo ID and copy of my SS card so they  could copy it to have proof of my identity on file. If you can, call him and ask if you could get it to him Saturday."
McDonalds,353fwk,Shockwave0304,1 point,Thu May 7 03:46:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they told me to bring photo ID and my SS card too. What's the food thing like? A relative of mine worked at a restaurant and got half-off of whatever meal they wanted but they still had to pay."
McDonalds,352pof,BlackDave,7,Wed May 6 16:39:09 2015 UTC,"I no longer work there (been over a year now) but I'll share my reason.  I started working there one day after I turned 18. You see, by the time I was allowed to work, the economy decided to take a shit on the fan and finding a job got a whole lot tougher. I applied at many places and could not find a job. By the time I got hired at my McDonald's, I had already applied three times. I still think that the only reason I got hired was because I held the door and was polite to what turned out to be the general manager when I went to apply for the third time. I was excited because it was my first job and I ended up working there for 5 years.  I hated the job a couple months in but the reason I stayed was because I was about to graduate high school and would need money for college. Also it was my only source of income and once you start getting income, you don't want it to end. Eventually I moved out of my parent's place and needed the income to survive so I stayed. I was hating the job but I couldn't leave it so I started applying for other jobs and couldn't get anything. I was also scared of change and scarred that the new job wouldn't work out and I would be in the streets with no money. Another thing that kept me going were the promotions. Every time I started thinking about leaving the restaurant, a position would be offered to me. It's like they knew what I was thinking. So soon enough I was a Crew Trainer, then a Swing Manager. By the end of 2012 I was a department manager. I started with Guest Services because I was already involved as a LSM (Local Store Marketing) coordinator, which had to report to the GS manager. So if I was both, communications would improve. Things were going alright until my store manager (a different one than the one had hired me at that point) decided to throw me in the kitchen department with no training what so ever. I had to do inventory and manage the kitchen which were two things I never did before. The employees would start talking shit about me and the other managers would make fun of my incompetence. Eventually I caught on and created my own inventory system which other managers started using, ironically. The thing that bothered me the most was that the previous kitchen manager was promoted to People department and was now in charge of hiring and scheduling employees, which she did a shit job at. She would hire the worst people and would take forever to release the schedule for the next week. Sometimes it wouldn't be ready until saturday night and employees had to call to find out what time they would work on sunday. It was bad. Seeing the chaos in the restaurant, the supervisor decided to bring in a people manager who was in training to become a store manager to train her and help us get back in shape (after the previous store manager had left).   This guy was a godsend. He always sided with my opinions of what needed to change and started teaching me how to hire and schedule employees. At one point he convinced the store manager to let me schedule the employees. I was able to get the schedule up in the break room by the end of tuesday. I made the current people manager look bad and impressed the store manager who always treated me like a child.  Things were going great management wise, but throughout the five years I worked there, I always had to deal with shitty employees, and horrible customers. It was slowly getting to me until one day I just snapped, walking into the freezer room and just sat there for a good half an hour thinking about my future. No matter how good I did at the job and how much money I'd end up doing, the stress of working for McDonald's would always be unbearable. I couldn't do it anymore. A friend of mine told me of a night auditor job opening at a hotel and I took it. Sure it was night shift but it was a desk job and it was peaceful and quiet. I loved it. Now I work as I.T.(my dream job) for the same hotel company, providing support for 7 different properties.   Edit: TL;DR: The stress of dealing with shit employees and shit customers made me quit but the job itself was okay."
McDonalds,352pof,BlackDave,3,Wed May 6 17:51:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the response! Also, how did you stay in the freezer for 30 minutes?! Brrrr"
McDonalds,352pof,StyrofoamGlass,3,Wed May 6 19:57:19 2015 UTC,"I used to do the truck delivery and also inventory. While i wore jackets, I could handle the cold in there without one. Plus i was steaming mad."
McDonalds,352pof,JustRegisteredHere,5,Wed May 6 20:23:22 2015 UTC,Because I was too busy trying to be defiant about going to college after high school. Couple that with a crippling fear of change and the fact it's really easy to get comfortable working there....10 years later I'm still there. Wish I could say it gets better.
McDonalds,352pof,Zeke2d,3,Wed May 6 17:04:14 2015 UTC,"My top reason for staying at McDonalds is that it's super easy. It also helps that I enjoy the pay, a majority of the people, and I love working for customers."
McDonalds,352pof,edELRIC90,4,Thu May 7 22:33:32 2015 UTC,"The location is convenient and I'm able to get 40 hours a week. I'm afraid I won't get full time hours if I go somewhere else. Honestly though, I've grown used to it, which is pretty bad since I still dislike the job, but my coworkers are awesome.  The gm has been there for 14 years because he just kind of got comfortable with it. He's also told me not to be like him."
McDonalds,352pof,redgroupclan,3,Fri May 8 17:56:33 2015 UTC,"While im sure it's different in different places, because it was decent pay. Originally it fit around school/uni, then as I received more qualifications and experience from them and moved up the ladder, pay became much better. Sure, depending on Restaurant Manager/consultant, things were better or worse and hours were hell under one RM in particular, but usually hours are ok, allows for appointments without scheduling time off, customers can be awful, staff can be awful and a giant headache, but paid better than other jobs even for the same job somewhere else. And its active (not sure how fat managers can stay fat and do their job!), never the same thing each shift."
McDonalds,352pof,Skwink,3,Thu May 7 03:27:09 2015 UTC,"It's the only place that would respond to my online applications. I was too afraid to go to places in person and ask for an application. I like it. It's easy, the coworkers at my place are a little like a sappy family, and I almost never encounter a customer being a full-on jerk like most people say they have to deal with.  Aside from the fact that I don't want to say goodbye to coworkers, I'm too lazy to look for another job even though I only get minimum wage at 17 hours a week when I need to be saving up for car insurance, student loans, and the ability to move out of my parents house."
McDonalds,352pof,kittypaloosa,1 point,Wed May 13 01:32:04 2015 UTC,"I've worked here for two years. I've reason I stay is I love the food service industry.

McDonalds,352pof,Odditys,1 point,Mon May 11 01:25:00 2015 UTC,"Well I recently got laid off from my last job when the company shut down nation-wide, and as I'm still in school I needed a quick job that could give me flexible hours.

So thank you McDonald's, you are letting me pay my bills."

McDonalds,34z95l,majambe,1 point,Wed May 6 03:49:30 2015 UTC,"Something as simple as, in your words, explaining to your manager calmly, should work. If they're reasonable then they should listen to you and do their best to accommodate. There should be other people in your store that can handle grills.  In saying that, as others have said you should try and get formal training in the kitchen. It can honestly be quite fun once you're good and fast on the line or on the grills. Until that proper training though, you shouldn't even be working on them without somebody supervising you. Tell that to a manager if they try get you on the grills again."

McDonalds,34trgo,none_shall_pass,11,Mon May 4 14:23:43 2015 UTC,"Perspective from the weekend prep person at a busy corporate store:  Chicken selects were intended to be a 6/8-week limited time offering.  Now we are introducing the Sirloin 1/3 burgers (for a limited run of 5-6 weeks), which I have already had the pleasure of trying all three varieties while training other crew on them.  We already have the [bacon/nobacon] clubhouse line of sandwiches, which when made right (cough, cough) are downright amazing. The big mac and QPC are the essential classics.  Over the past year, due to menu rationalization, we lost roughly half of our grill sauces, and numerous specialty toppings, and a premium bun. This severely limited the specialty sandwich options.  Even some sandwiches which still can be made were taken off the menu board.  The value menu was formerly a host of flavors for any taste, now its a jalapeno burger (a local item IIRC), two McChickens (one of which is also an LTO), and the baseline burgers.  They have also discontinued quite a few of the slower nugget sauces (Sweet chili, cBBQ, and habenero ranch that many found delicious.  McDonalds has also been very weak with seasonal LTOs. Last year, for christmas, all our store got was the mcrib, and that release was botched to hell and back (advertising started a week before we got the buns, and ended months after we stopped receiving any sauce.  Our store's menu board even showed the mcrib for a long time after we ran out.)  We have had the same two pies for who knows how long now, where we rotated them out frequently last year.  No speciality drinks this past year, excluding the shamrock shake (which overstressed our machine and broke it for a few weeks), although we are starting Strawberry Sweet Tea for the summer.  Honestly, I don't see that flavor going anywhere."
McDonalds,34trgo,TehWildMan_,2,Mon May 4 18:31:00 2015 UTC,"Yup, I think the bacon clubhouse is the best item on the menu and the closest thing to a restaurant-style burger you'll find.  It seems the seasonal items have died down here as well. We've had strawberry-cream pies for way too long now, and we had holiday pies for way too long before that. We had the McRib last year as well but only for like two weeks, not long enough compared to everything else seasonal. I only had a chance to eat one of them. Yet we just stopped selling selects and shamrock shakes last week.  Our menu board still shows half the stuff we don't sell anymore. We recently got rid of diet sweet tea, it's still up there. It also shows the southern style chicken sandwich among other things, which we haven't had since like last year because of the menu rationalization.  How are the Sirloin burgers? I haven't tried them or made any yet."

McDonalds,34trgo,McDKid,3,Tue May 5 02:58:33 2015 UTC,"It's no different from the rest of the wraps except for the sauce.  I've been ordering snack wraps with no ranch, add sweet chili (since we only sell the ranch snack wrap now). And I've added bacon to the sweet chili one to combine the bacon and sweet chili premium wraps. I'll probably add extra sweet chili to my next one since I've noticed it isn't spread out very well.  The BBQ wrap was definitely the best one but they got rid of it and we don't even have the sauce anymore. And the Tangy Barbeque cups are different from the Chipotle Barbeque that was used on the wrap."

Also whenever I come home from a shift (regardless of the time), I just have a long-ass soak in the bath, about an hour or so."

McDonalds,34n7wd,DoctorMythos,2,Sat May 2 22:49:11 2015 UTC,"In my McDonald's here in Germany we have... Id say 4 different chicken sandwiches. Chickenburger, Chickenburger-TS, McChicken Classic and the Bacon Clubhouse Chicken (just for a time). And well, the Wraps all have chicken in them. I guess you're from America? What kind of chicken sandwiches do you have?"
McDonalds,34n7wd,Manedblackwolf,1 point,Sat May 2 20:11:31 2015 UTC,"We have the McChicken, 2 Bacon Clubhouse Chickens (grilled and fried), and this new Artisan Chicken Sandwich that's supposed to use ""pantry ingredients"".  And then 8 kinds of wraps.  I miss German McDonalds, I lived by Hanau when I was in the army."
McDonalds,34n7wd,Manedblackwolf,2,Sat May 2 21:58:34 2015 UTC,"We also have a grilled Clubhouse, it's called Beef, though. Since it has beef, obviously..."

McDonalds,34mdqo,DoctorMythos,1 point,Sat May 2 22:50:28 2015 UTC,Same here. It seems like strawberry creme has been the LTO pie forever now.
McDonalds,34mdqo,djkcoop,1 point,Sun May 3 01:29:36 2015 UTC,Baked apple pies will be making a return. The fried pies are only here for a limited time  just like every single product mcdonalds is releasing currently.

I can see how it would affect work, but if both parties are mature enough to keep it behind the scenes, why would it be a problem? I'm not talking about this post in particular, just in general."
McDonalds,34la2d,edELRIC90,3,Sat May 2 18:32:53 2015 UTC,"Not sure about other countries, but here its in the contract that to avoid risk of favoritism, bullying, inappropriate conduct, etc, it can't happen. It's the non-fraternization policy. Here a manager isn't supposed to even hang out with crew outside of work. And being in a contract, yes they can get fired. Have seen a couple people get in trouble for it."
McDonalds,34imnl,DrizzlyEarth175,8,Fri May 1 13:54:26 2015 UTC,"Chances are the people you are calling don't know. McDonalds is a busy environment and managers always haw something to do. Instead of calling, go into the store during a quiet time of day, and speak to a manager. That way they can't leave you waiting for an answer."
McDonalds,34imnl,Jon-Connington,2,Fri May 1 14:07:59 2015 UTC,"Well, every time I called I asked for a manager, which I suppose I should've said. And honestly, I'd probably have to go in at like, midnight in order to do that.   Or, will they just call me when I need to go in next?"
McDonalds,34imnl,CynicLibrarian,5,Fri May 1 14:13:09 2015 UTC,"every time I called I asked for a manager   A swing manager would not know when you are working next, off the top of their heads. It would require them to go hunting around for the information, which is difficult to do in the middle of a rush.  Can't you just drop in and check the scheduling book?"
McDonalds,34imnl,Jon-Connington,2,Fri May 1 14:33:32 2015 UTC,"There are multiple managers who work at every store. My store has 12. Obviously some are higher up than others, but the chances of speaking to the manager who deals with hiring people are slim.  And you wouldn't have to go in at midnight, go sometime in the morning, between 10-11. Or afternoon about 7-8.   Don't rely on them to contact you. I know it sounds stupid, but do it yourself. It's something I've picked up on working there."
McDonalds,34imnl,Editcus,3,Fri May 1 14:29:48 2015 UTC,"Lol this almost happened to me when I first started working here. After I clocked out on my first day I looked at the schedule and I saw that I wasn't on it and they didn't have me scheduled. So I told a manager that I wasn't on the schedule and so she wrote on the back of a receipt and gave me some days. Talk to the shift manager, the one the makes the schedule. Like what the person said before, go in when its not busy like at 1-2, 4-5 and maybe around 9"

I don't like mustard on my burgers, or pickles or onions... so I get it plain and add the ketchup myself if I want. And maybe a few french fries. However if I'm ordering the quarter pounder I just get no onion no pickles and light ketchup"
McDonalds,343vlo,deliriumtr1gger,9,Tue Apr 28 02:23:49 2015 UTC,"I've worked at McDonalds for 3 years have never heard of this. A quick Google search shows that its a big mac but with 8 meat patties?  If that's true, than that's a really stupid idea that McDonalds can't legally make or sell a sandwhich because its so monster? There is no button for that sand which nor will nobody know what that means, and he or she will have to spend 2 minutes and break down what you actually want. In the end you will not get a monster Mac, but a big Mac add 6 extra reg patties. And it will cost you $10.79 at my store before tax. An extra $2 or $3 I'd want the extra cheese..  Tdlr;  its not illegal for McDonald's to sell you large sandwiches. If you ask for it we will make it :)"
McDonalds,343vlo,Juicy555,4,Tue Apr 28 04:03:19 2015 UTC,"This. I worked for McDonald's for a while, and one of the truly amazing things about their ordering system is that you can order ANY sort of modification for ANYTHING. Case in point, my last day of working there, just to fuck around with the cooks, I ordered a McDouble, add lime wedge. We all got a laugh and they didn't actually put it on, but if you wanted to, you could order a Big Mac, hold the meat, add an apple pie, add whipped cream, add buffalo sauce.      Burger King used to have the ""Have it your way"" campaign, but you really can do that just as well at McD's."
McDonalds,343vlo,ohenry78,4,Tue Apr 28 13:43:26 2015 UTC,Why would it be illegal to sell an unusually large sandwich?
McDonalds,343vlo,Vegetableswag,3,Tue Apr 28 16:25:01 2015 UTC,because the government would find out and everyone will go to prison
McDonalds,343vlo,DonGeronimo,4,Thu Apr 30 00:23:12 2015 UTC,We are allowed to make it and it is legal - you just can't call it a Monster Mac because the Monster Mac is a customer creation and not an official product name. Just ring it up as a Big Mac with 6 extra patties and we'll make it for you.
