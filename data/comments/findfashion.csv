If she doesn't use large bags look under the ""shoulder bags"" sections and maybe even some satchels or larger cross body bags (though those are more casual). Some of these brands trend more towards $400 so that may be out of your price range but you could always check out local outlet stores or the sale section on larger websites such as Nordstrom. The following are some good suggestions from their sale section, but feel free to check out the designer's websites and the regular priced merchandise if this isn't what you're looking for.

findfashion,3d64dw,awaytossed,2,Mon Jul 13 20:40:02 2015 UTC,I couldn't find the exact water bottle but this seems to be of the same brand. The only difference is that it's a flip cap instead of a flip straw.
findfashion,3d5wsl,ichliebespink,2,Mon Jul 13 19:47:42 2015 UTC,Are you looking for one of the top 3 or the bottom dress?

findfashion,3d24f9,CremeChantilly,3,Sun Jul 12 22:23:44 2015 UTC,"Find a top you really like even if it doesn't have the lace trim and buy it. Go to a fabric shop, ask to look at lace trim. Buy about a yard of the one you like most. Take it home and sew it on. Can't see?  Take them to a seamstress and have it sewn on. Walls, you get what you wanted."

findfashion,3cyfyi,tgarron,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:47:43 2015 UTC,"Commenting here since my other post was removed without me realizing.   I have been looking high and low and coming up empty. I am looking for taupe-colored suede leggings and it seems like it is a mythical creature, but when I do find a pair, it's sold out in my size and most sizes. I am wondering if it's so hard to locate because of the season or if it's not something really in style. Are suede bottoms outdated?  edit: this is pretty much perfect and it has a small available but it says it is ""available on waitlist"" :/"
