DFO,3e4wh7,SuperShittySlayer,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:33:56 2015 UTC,Usually when it's just my brother and I partying the game is running fine. Then with a full party it's storm for basically everyone but i think it's a little worst for them since my brother usually hosts/party leader. Im not exactly sure how P2P works with 2 PCs on the same side.
DFO,3e4wh7,SuperShittySlayer,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:41:06 2015 UTC,You can try using the //monitor command to check the pings. You only need to pay attention to the top left digits under the player portrait. The lower the better.

DFO,3e4pgy,Lil_Puddin,4,Tue Jul 21 22:58:07 2015 UTC,"Dark Templar is better in both pve and pvp imo. They're highly sought after since their holds are amazing in pve, and in pvp they have a lot of utility (multiple grabs, otg, aoe, superarmor type skill) & big combos (they can squeeze in damage with one of their holds, can also do resets if opponent doesnt have quick stand)."
DFO,3e4pgy,matsunoki,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:00:56 2015 UTC,"DT has her holds, but Nen has his bubble, both of which are important in OV. M. Nen does more damage, and isn't on the chopping block in the future (DTs only damage skill Destroyer gets destroyed in future nerfs). I know some pretty good m nens in pvp, DT in too new for me in DFOG to know pvp wise but I'm sure she is good with all her holds and whatnot. Both are percentage classes, so both do well with reinforcement. IMO DT was kinda boring before 45, then it was annoying to have to wait for Destroyer to do your big damage (it really is a ridiculous skill though, absolute bonkers). M nen is pretty fun (you ride a friggin lion for gods sake) and he has a godly chronicle set. I say M nen!"
DFO,3e4pgy,Sher101,-4,Wed Jul 22 00:54:41 2015 UTC,"Both are somewhat poor damage-wise.  M.Nen brings a short lasting damage immunity bubble, speed buffs for the whole party (everyone loves this), and servicable damage.  DT brings holds, holds, and more holds, with piss poor damage.  They're both welcome in any group really. They just perform entirely different roles."

DFO,3e2xmh,FenixR,2,Tue Jul 21 15:32:49 2015 UTC,"Monk takes a bit more control since you need to use duck and sway well, as well as dry out cancels and efficient cool down rotation. MNen on the other hand is very dependent on x attacks and spirals for damage, especially end game. I believe something like 90% of their damage comes from spiral + tiger flash x attacks later. So they just spam x and use cooldowns as they come.  I would say if the monk player is good, they have a lot more potential - better burst damage, better consistent damage with good control, better buff with totem, etc. They are also considered one of the most satisfying classes to play in DFO. So I would recommend monk."

DFO,3e2mqa,oohjeric,2,Tue Jul 21 14:08:18 2015 UTC,"Both are fine. Anybody who isn't a shithead will accept either into an OV party as long as they have enough exorcism. I think people like to run Spitfires and Rangers together, since Rangers can put out really high damage and Spitfires can buff them.   2/3. Ranger survives solely on killing things before they get killed. The +12 Phoenix Revolver will do the job for a long time, but once you're in Power Station you're probably still going to get murdered if you dare attempt to solo an ultimate road. Female Spitfires spend most of their time in the air and have stun/freeze procs all over the place, so they have a much higher base rate of survival."

So the fact that they mentioned 2nd awakening means they want the hype. Besides if I remember correctly you need to do black dragon tournament for 2nd awakening.

As for the best one, elementalist and summoner shine the most in PVE out of the 4. But all 4 classes have very different play style, look up some videos on them before you choose. As for leveling guide, the general rule is to follow all your epic quests, and grind special dungeons if you run out of them. That last question I can't really answer because its top secret lol.

The leveling guide is pretty straight forward with just completing all your epic quests and grinding special dungeons when you can.   The FP system is explained my Runa, right beside Seria in the beginning room. Pretty self explanitory   As for making money, easiest is to use irl money to sell cash shop items.

DFO,3e0rsv,NineNen,2,Tue Jul 21 05:13:23 2015 UTC,"Elementalist: devastating nukes for bursting either single or multiple enemies. Very boring leveling phase, you will begin seeing huge improvement to gameplay beyond level 40. You are at the mercy of cooldowns, but proper cycling of skills will let you clear dungeons very quickly.  Summoner: exactly what they sound like, summon a bunch of tanky summons to fight. AI is extremely dumb so getting to lvl 30 for mark the target is mandatory to get the feel for the class. Sustain damage out of the ass with this character and the damage itself is also as high too, its nuts! Witch: More specced for damage over time. They are very good for aoe coverage as well as being capable of locking monsters in once place (great for parties ofc). Damage will drop off quicker compared to the other two though as their base skill values aren't really amazing. Witches most notibly have gear that makes them extremely strong relative to the first two classes. Early leveling is the easiest, imo, since you get good burst skills early on Battle mage: I'm not too knowledgeable with them, someone fill in for me.   Leveling guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/DFO/comments/3amk8e/leveling_guide_1585/  1 fp = 1 room of a dungeon. 8 fp consumed on entering a special dungeon (gold border, like forgotten forest at lvl 17).

Each class is very good, they just all have different strengths.   If we're being honest, I would park your mage and try a different character to get a better feel for the game. When I first picked up the game, I tried to play f. mage first and had a really hard time getting into the game, so I quit for a while. I then came back and tried out the other classes and ended up having a blast, as the subclasses for each class generally break the mold, with fun, innovative skills. For example, Slayers can be a generic swordsman, with strong sword abilities and what not, but they have an entire subclass dedicated to magic techniques. Fighters can start off as generic Ryu-clones, but they can evolve into spirit-gods, dirty tricksters, and wrestling machines that make Randy Orton look like a joke.  This game has a lot of interesting character classes, and the mage is not an exception, but I really would recommend trying out something more conventional before going for a mage. That said, Witches are my favorite mage subclass by far, simply because they have hilarious abilities."

DFO,3e1bgb,Kikklik,3,Tue Jul 21 04:54:04 2015 UTC,It's called hitstop and it's a unique property depending on the weapon. The most noticeable example is comparing the hitstop of hitting 3+ enemies with a zanbato vs. a lightsaber.  You can't truly prevent it because it's an innate part of the game.
DFO,3e1bgb,Nihil679,2,Tue Jul 21 04:57:49 2015 UTC,"Plenty of action games do this.  It's to give your character a feeling of weighty-ness to their attacks.  I know in Monster Hunter when you strike a monster in a weak spot your attack will just stop for a frame or two before it cleaves through.  Super fucking satisfying.  I personally love it.

Grandine shows 82-85 as the recommended level, but all monsters are level 85 in Grandine which would mean you can't get level 75 epics there."

Edit: Further explanation, you need a point in the TP skill to have it ""active"" in the first place, so the +TP skills have a point because, well, it makes no sense to add to something not working.  Some TP skills are also 1 point masters, but still have further benefits with levels. For example, Spitfire's Crossmore Upgrade maxes at 1, but more levels reduces the damage penalty."

DFO,3e0m1q,Stormquake,7,Tue Jul 21 01:12:14 2015 UTC,"It's a level 84 area in Suju. There are 3 dungeons attached to it, Natram's Warden, Betrayal of the Twin Golems, and Natram's Warden. It was an area originally first released in CDNF and it got heavily revamped when they released it in KDNF (particularly in difficulty because the CDNF version is unforgivably hard). They cost 8 fp to enter just like special dungeons and clearing the dungeons will give you a buff that only works in these 3 dungeons. It can be anything from drop rate increases to Powerful Energy drops.  Each Dungeon has some unique gimmick to it:  Natram's Warden - You're ""timed"" to finish it as soon as possible to get the most rewards. The boss has a huge elemental shield that's a random element each run. You're given a message on what Element he has chosen and you break statues that are opposite of that element to gain inflict that element + a bigger aura. When you have the biggest aura you can break through his shield easily which is needed since he takes heavily reduced damage from all sources while its up. The Light Blue Crystals you get as rewards can be sold to NPCs for 4k each and you can get at least 9 per run so this is a very good dungeon to farm if you're low on gold.  Betrayal at the Twin Golems - You can rescue the other Twin Golem at the top of the map. You have to kill all the mobs assaulting him and his helpers and when you successfully rescue him, he'll help you with the boss fight. The Flaming Twin Golem boss is COMPLETELY STATUS IMMUNE so rip any status classes (tried to beat him on my Brawler only to not dent him due to his high health regen). The boss drops at least 3 Powerful Energies by default but he can drop more, especially if you have an endcard bonus for it.  Holy Land Kuruunchad - This is just straightforward giant bossfight with the Giant Crystalline Dragon, Natram. He's annoying to solo just because he has an attack where he'll grab you with his mouth and turn you into a solid crystal. You need another player to break the crystal or you'll die within seconds. If you're soloing then you're just dead unless you're a Knight or a Male Mage since the immortality passives somehow prevent the crystallization from killing you (they'll proc the second it ends though).  The best reward for doing these dungeons is Natram's Bead which is for Magic Stone (one of the few magic stone beads in the game). You can buy the beads from an NPC for a ton of Dark Blue Crystals (Obtained from Daily Quests and as drops from all monsters in Kurun-Moon). There are two beads, both give +5 all Elemental Damage and  and the difference is either +1 Physical Crit and +1 to Physical Rear Crit or +1 to Magic Crit and +1 to Magic Rear Crit. There are also some exclusive Monster cards of each boss and some other rewards as well."

If you run it at level 25, you basically only farm the first area for the whole 30 minutes for the Blue Crystals to buy the level 25-34 stuff. If you're level 48, just farm the level 45 area until the timer ends, etc.  The earliest I'd recommend trying to do the last area is at level 70 for most classes. Some classes can tackle it at level 65 depending what class it is and what your gear is.  Also be prepared to burn through tokens if you encounter the Werewolf Tracker."
DFO,3e0jfn,Save4Less,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:11:45 2015 UTC,How much exp can you gain from just straight up grinding (say for lvls 55 and 75). Hopefully it's enough to warrant playing my alts again.
DFO,3e0jfn,Save4Less,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:59:24 2015 UTC,"The EXP itself isn't too groundbreaking at higher levels especially considering it's 30 minutes of grinding, but you can exchange crystals that drop there for EXP potions that give 100% clear exp for 5 runs and stack with other EXP potions.

DFO,3e0hgu,DFO_Ugin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:55:57 2015 UTC,On controllers? No. Controllers are fine. As for Macros such as the slayer xxx thing. This actually happened in a tournament. It was in a tournament hosted by FireCommando(Who is one of the coheads of super armor prime now) and it was rather obvious. He was xing very fast and never moved forward during it. Like some people are good at making the x string not move you forward at all but typically people will slip up on the first hit occasionally. Any way the guy was disqualified from the tournament as it was pretty apparent for most watching.

DFO,3e0hgu,matsunoki,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:41:02 2015 UTC,There is a difference between timing your X key to match your attack animation and firing off the X key in 0.01s intervals repeatedly to hit that same timing.
DFO,3e0hgu,619472206,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:44:49 2015 UTC,It's not hard to do all of what you said without macros. With X attacks however it is harder to time them without autokey because it is dependent upon your ping if you actually want to time every single attack correctly. You eventually get used to the pace at which you need to hit the x key and can hit as fast as autokey. Different pings you need to press hit x at a different pace.
DFO,3e0hgu,Larfreezey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:00:38 2015 UTC,"Not much they can do, it's difficult to 'catch' these types of things and even more difficult to prove it. I probably know which streamer you're talking about because he does it so blatantly and his character is one that can really take advantage of it, but no one can prove it and I doubt Neople will do anything about it even if ranked PVP opens. Even on KDNF they don't bother with this type of stuff, the only ones they started banning are blatant hacking or purposefully lagging."
DFO,3e0hgu,619472206,-1,Tue Jul 21 05:24:27 2015 UTC,"The only thing closest to a macro is the auto x function in the settings. Other than that XIGN would normally block them.

DFO,3dyidv,xxswiftpandaxx,15,Mon Jul 20 15:58:11 2015 UTC,"Actually, you don't pick your subclass as you make the character. Reaching level 8 will give you a simple quest where you're allowed to watch the preview videos for each of your available subclasses, and at level 15 you can receive a quest that, upon completion, will give you whatever subclass you selected when you took the quest. Furthermore, reaching level 50 will allow you to undertake a quest chain that will advance you to your first Awakening, granting access to your (currently) endgame skills. Second Awakenings will be released in a future patch, available at level 75.  As for your character, if you're not level 15 yet, then don't worry; you still have time to choose a subclass. If you already took one, though, then the only option is to make a new character if you want something different. There's a reason we're allowed 20 characters per server."

You've been playing say, Berserker for awhile, but you haven't had any luck in hells, just another run of the mill mediocre zerk.  2nd awakenings are on the horizon and you open a epic pot.   Bam, Balmung.   Suddenly the patch hits and you get free class change books, you have two options.   Stay mediocre possibly forever and carry on with your Zerk adventures...   Or, you could switch to WM and use your Balmung, suddenly going from a mediocre zerk with magic seals/whatever to a WM with Balmung.   Just think of the process as giving it to an alt.

As for using a ticket to change class, yes I understand why some people would do that, but on the other hand you lose all your work on that character. All that armor is gone (possibly Epic), those sub equips too (possibly class locked). Yes, if you have average gear and you find a great Epic weapon it might be worth considering to switch, but what about all the other gear?"
DFO,3dyidv,Daitelion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:30:02 2015 UTC,"? It was an example of a situation where someone would consider class changing.  Zerk wearing some 80 unique/seals wouldn't compare with a WM with Balmung, simple as that.   Epic armor isn't gone, you can keep wearing it lol, any epic armor a zerk would want a WM could use pretty much, also, sub equips? Most people opt for a tear for their free slot.   You would lose chrons, but that's it really."

DFO,3e07w9,ako1379,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:21:17 2015 UTC,i think so too
DFO,3e07w9,5hadows,2,Mon Jul 20 23:25:45 2015 UTC,"There are way too many damage boost equip in the game, and because they dont stack chances are youll replace the glory bracelete sooner or later. The Necklage however will stay there for a long time since there aren`t many necklages that are better than +16 all elemental damage and res."
DFO,3e07w9,5hadows,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:48:36 2015 UTC,"ya i love stacking crit chance on gears, the bracelet just doesnt work great with my crit chance gears :/"
DFO,3e07w9,Sky248,2,Mon Jul 20 23:55:36 2015 UTC,"Of course it does, the wording is poorly done but what they actually mean is that damage boosts won't stack with each other with the exception of critical boost gear. You can't have two damage +% equips because only the highest value will stack but you can stack +% damage and +% crit damage."
DFO,3e07w9,Pkerzach,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:02:48 2015 UTC,"am i wrong? it said ""Not applicable for critical damage"" from the bracelet"
DFO,3e07w9,ruminate888,2,Tue Jul 21 00:11:14 2015 UTC,"I believe that means that the limitation, it not stacking with other damage mods, doesn't apply to crit damage mods."
DFO,3e07w9,kaisthetic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:16:34 2015 UTC,im pree sure it means it dosen't boost your crit damage value by the percent. It should be a increase regardless being (base X Bracelet boost)+(CritdamageMultiplier)
DFO,3e07w9,ruminate888,2,Tue Jul 21 03:23:03 2015 UTC,"Are you going to farm a 9pc OV set?  Are you going to farm for a liberation weapon?  If you answered yes to both questions, then that leaves one slot open for a random epic, random legendary, or a guaranteed quest legendary. The best quest legendary to match the 9pc OV set and liberation weapon is the bracelet. This set up is the reason why most take the bracelet."
DFO,3e07w9,babksgd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:12:21 2015 UTC,But liberation gives 16% damage so the bracelet's 9% damage would be a waste of a stat if you got the liberation weapon...unless im missing something
DFO,3e07w9,babksgd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:00:52 2015 UTC,"Liberation damage bonus is the same as phoenix/dragon weapon. It adds a second source of damage instead of increasing total damage. In other words, they stack."

DFO,3e03bd,619472206,2,Mon Jul 20 22:47:12 2015 UTC,i think this is after the buffs to EB
