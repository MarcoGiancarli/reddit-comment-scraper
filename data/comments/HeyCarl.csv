HeyCarl,3dh2dm,Colonel_Goatbanger,24,Thu Jul 16 05:29:01 2015 UTC,I apologize in advance for being dumb as a bag of hammers. I don't get it. Please explain.
HeyCarl,3dh2dm,pseydtonne,23,Thu Jul 16 07:04:25 2015 UTC,"From googling Galloway, personal exposure to US military culture, and checking what the hell the Arthur Ashe awards are, leads me to believe some people are upset a combat vet who lost limbs lost out on a courage award to a transgender woman.  As for the joke, Noah lost his left arm and leg from below the elbow and knee respectively. Thus he is ""all right."""
HeyCarl,3dh2dm,MaserPhaser,3,Thu Jul 16 10:41:37 2015 UTC,"Wow, Jenner won this award by becoming a woman, this guy deserved it. I'm angery now"
HeyCarl,3dh2dm,Papalopicus,14,Thu Jul 16 12:07:17 2015 UTC,"Jenner won it because of sports. ESPY Award is short for Excellence in Sports Performance Yearly Award.  Bruce Jenner was a decathlon Olympic gold medal winner.   Galloway participates in a variety of fitness competitions from regular 5K and 10K races to ones like Tough Mudders, CrossFit competitions and Spartan events. He was chosen as a contestant on Dancing with the Stars (season 20). None of which earned him a medal in sports.   If we're going to give ESPYs to everyone awarded a Purple Heart, that's around 2 million medals. One award a night would take over 5,000 years ...and seeing as the medal is less than a hundred years old, we'd need dozens of ESPY Awards awarded every day for these non-sporting award winners.  Again: SPORTS. Should we award Galloway the Strongest Man In The World award? How about an honorary gold medal to match Jenner's? Or an ESPY for his high school efforts in football? Some people just like to fucking moan about shit that has nothing to do with what's going on. SPORTS.   Ever get stuck behind someone in Burger King arguing because they want a Big Mac and the woman last week gave them a Big Mac, and that's the problem with this country, they've been coming here for fifteen years and never had a problem getting a Big Mac before...? Do you encourage those dimwits? Because that's what the complainers, and you, are getting ""angery"" [sic] about."
HeyCarl,3dh2dm,Jackpot777,11,Thu Jul 16 13:01:38 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Jenner won his/her(?) gold medal years ago. This guy pushed through extensive injuries and performed in various sports events. :/ So I do think he kind of deserved to win it."
HeyCarl,3dh2dm,Dominus_Redditi,4,Thu Jul 16 16:35:11 2015 UTC,"That was my mindset going into this. The award doesn't have to be all about sports, just sport involved peoples actions. Terrible injures, and still had the courage to continue in many sports. The award is for courage, and changing gender isn't as courageous in my mind. There's many other transgenders why don't they get awards?"
HeyCarl,3dh2dm,Papalopicus,2,Fri Jul 17 02:02:29 2015 UTC,"Jenner was an established gold medalist, a damn fine lawyer, and actually stopped his hormone therapy to transition back in the 80's because he loved kris so much, he wanted to have a life with her. So he put his own hopes and wishes, his identity on hold for her. That takes a lot of courage. She continued to stand up for what she believes in after going public with her transition. She stands up for what she thinks is right, and that takes courage.   I am a veteran. I have lost many friends. I have seen first hand what happens to our troops. They are very courageous as well. But the fact of the matter is, Caitlyn Jenner has always been an athlete. Sorry, but Galloway didn't get into competitive sports until after his injuries, and he used the sports as a way of rehabilitation.  So, if we're looking at the big picture, Caitlyn has been an athlete, and has been achieving athletic feats for longer than Galloway has. Jenner deserved the award whether she's a woman or a man. Galloway is known as a war veteran, not an athlete, plain and simple."

HeyCarl,3dh2dm,Pancerules,2,Thu Jul 16 16:08:28 2015 UTC,"The Big Mac... you mean The McDonald's Whopper with a few tweaks?   Though fast food companies do tend to copy each other's successes, the Big King seems especially egregious because Burger King already has its own signature sandwich, the Whopper, which actually predates the Big Mac. The Big King is a copy of the Big Mac, which is a copy of The Whopper, which was always made with a quarter pound of beef as the new bigger, Big King is (though the company won't confirm that).    Is that the point you were trying to make?  Yeah, I know it wasn't. You meant McDonald's Big Barney!   https://soundingsjohnbarker.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/barn1.jpg"

HeyCarl,2sc7gb,22taylor22,-2,Wed Jan 14 02:18:29 2015 UTC,Fine I'll say it. It's because Sophia is dead and he wouldn't say Sophias mom.

HeyCarl,2sc7gb,b3n4president,4,Wed Jan 14 13:36:52 2015 UTC,"""Sophia's Mom"" is needed because part of the punchline includes 'Carol'.

HeyCarl,2rsu23,Sample_Name,60,Fri Jan 9 00:00:30 2015 UTC,I am so impressed by the many ways everyone has managed to warp Carl's name.
HeyCarl,2rsu23,Nataface,14,Fri Jan 9 02:00:41 2015 UTC,"Sorry for a stupid question, I'm a bit new to these, I subscribed a while ago and found most of the original (and subsequently top) posts on this subreddit incredibly funny.  Now I see them every once in a while since I'm subscribed to it and I don't find it nearly as funny, so my question is, is the point really just abusing Carl's name? There used to be some creativity, now its just a bad pun followed by a new way to butcher the name, has that turned into the point? It seemed like there was no emphasis on warping the name in the early posts which were the ones that I subsequently found hilarious, and now I strongly dislike most of the submissions because of where the emphasis is.  Again I'm sorry to disrupt the normal flow of these comment sections but I'm just interested in what makes a quality post here nowadays."
HeyCarl,2rsu23,Burgerburgerfred,16,Fri Jan 9 02:59:57 2015 UTC,"Well to start off the name change it wasn't always like this. It was a slow and gradual change first from ""Carl"" to ""Coral"" and it soon led to posts with ""QWUARRAL"" and so on.  The original posts in the subreddit were a mix of both The Walking Dead references and something that would come from /r/dadjokes. However as that material began to thin out a little bit and the season is currently on hiatus, it slowly shifted to puns and a skewing of Carl's name. Hopefully in time the content will shift back to its more Walking Dead theme as the show resumes season five.  Hopefully that helps, currently most people seem to enjoy the name skew but it seems to come and go just a little bit."
HeyCarl,2rsu23,Wezle,2,Fri Jan 9 03:24:50 2015 UTC,"Ok, that makes some sense, I guess I just never found the shift as funny but that's a perfectly reasonable explanation for why it's happened."

And in some other comics they keep fucking with the template. The whole point of the template is that you get good comedic timing with your joke. This sub is slowly turning into /r/youdontsurf

HeyCarl,2kjs5b,that_nagger_guy,0,Thu Oct 30 08:32:49 2014 UTC,I don't care how YOU spell it. The topic of the subreddit says it is Carl. It's right there for you. C..a...r...l.
HeyCarl,2kjs5b,Poltrygeist,-2,Thu Oct 30 17:58:10 2014 UTC,It is pointless discussing this with rude dickbags. You speak one language and come being a dick to people who speak 3+ because they misspell one letter of a word.
HeyCarl,2kjs5b,that_nagger_guy,1 point,Thu Oct 30 20:18:40 2014 UTC,"You assume I speak one language. I actually speak four. We are not addressing speaking though. Only reading. The subreddit is in standard English. All you had to do was observe that. I doubt you are educated in many languages though. Your vocabulary, use of foul language and name calling, informs me that you're young, probably 15 or so, and in the lowest percentage of your class. Also, the bit where you declare that arguing is pointless, but you still do it anyway, tells me you do not study tactics and have poor impulse control. Which probably increases your poor vocabulary choices. Please enjoy more CARL word plays where Carl...C..A...R..L..Has many speaking lines. For you I should create some Koral ones though. What do you think KOOOORRRREEEELLLLLL?"
HeyCarl,2kjs5b,Poltrygeist,-2,Fri Oct 31 07:51:04 2014 UTC,"I like how you speak 4 languages but cannot prove it. You just need to Google translate though so no need. I don't look at the name of the subreddit. I clicked ""MyRandom"" and got it up I think and just commented in a thread without thinking. Since it's spelled KARL in my native language it just comes natural to me to write Karl. What about my vocabulary in ENGLISH makes you think I'm not educated in other languages. Jesus christ you are a dimwitted one. You are saying that I am immature? Says the one fucking crying over someone misspelling a word.   You make me cringe so fucking hard. You are one sad little bastard trying to decipher people over the Internet and you cannot accept that people speak different languages."

HeyCarl,2j07l6,surfnsound,13,Sun Oct 12 15:53:20 2014 UTC,What about a group of jackdaws?
HeyCarl,2j07l6,Lord_Wrath,14,Mon Oct 13 13:27:33 2014 UTC,"Here's the thing. You said a ""jackdaw is a crow."" Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying ""crow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens. So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people ""call the black ones crows?"" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

I think the people complaining about the Coral thing haven't seen the show? Or never once heard Rick say Carl (which he says like Coral). At least that's why it's funny to me. If people started doing it completely randomly, or because Carl and Coral sound alike then that honestly sort of kills the entire thing for me.

HeyCarl,2gowfo,WifelikePigeon,34,Wed Sep 17 20:37:37 2014 UTC,Don't worry. In comics he loses his hand but Kirkman explicitly stated that he regrets doing it and won't happen in show. Merle's  (lack of) hand became a reference to comic instead.
HeyCarl,2gowfo,kekecadam,11,Wed Sep 17 21:05:48 2014 UTC,I think I remember reading something about how they'll never do it because it would be too difficult to CGI his hand out every scene or something like that.
HeyCarl,2gowfo,xkillerpatx,-2,Wed Sep 17 22:28:25 2014 UTC,that's stupid. they did that for merel and they did that for hershel on a dick-ton of scenes. idk...
HeyCarl,2gowfo,rreighe2,4,Thu Sep 18 09:36:17 2014 UTC,"No with Merle they just put that can shaped thing over his hand and put a knife in there, but for Hershel you could get away with it because they didn't have to show his legs and only show him in crutches to make you think he's missing it. But he finds a prosthetic eventually anyway so it wasn't long that they CGI'd it a few times."

HeyCarl,2b8924,AnorexicBuddha,2,Mon Jul 21 04:40:31 2014 UTC,"Idk why this is being downvoted. Season 3 takes place in a prison, the early half in which Lori is heavily pregnant. Basically prior this episode rick and the group find a group of prisoners after running away from a group of walkers. They help these prisoners until there is an attempt at Rick's life. Rick kills the one prisoner and the other joins them. One runs away. Rick leaves the other one to die to a group of walkers. The next episode that prisoner opens a gate which compromises the prison. An attack occurs. Carl Maggie and Lori are separated. Carl is forced to stand by while a c-section is performed on his mother. However. He proceeds to shoot her in the head to ensure she doesn't become a walker. At the end of the attack they regroup. To where rick learns of Loris death and the child's birth. The scene is pretty heartbreaking but a lot of people think its the funniest shit ever."

HeyCarl,1xnj85,Ranger_X,5,Wed Feb 19 23:36:21 2014 UTC,I stopped watching the show at season 1. Why did he shot her? Walker? (I don't care about spoilers by now.)
HeyCarl,1xnj85,Wardenclyffe56,14,Thu Feb 13 02:04:57 2014 UTC,"Two things were discovered in Season Two. One: Lori is pregnant (presumably with Shane's baby from when everyone thought Rick was dead and she hooked up with Shane) Two: Everyone is infected with the walker virus. Regardless of whether or not you have been bitten, you will turn shortly after you die (unless, of course, you destroy the brain).    This clip is from season three. Lori died during childbirth and Carl had to shoot her in the head so she didn't turn into a walker and eat them. Rick was not present for this, and Carl is breaking the news to him in this scene. They managed to save the baby, which explains the baby that Maggie (a new character as of season two) is holding. They name her Judith."
HeyCarl,1xnj85,konydanza,13,Thu Feb 13 02:35:10 2014 UTC,Little ass kicker.
HeyCarl,1xnj85,moon-jellyfish,3,Fri Feb 14 13:24:32 2014 UTC,Another thing to remember is that Judith might be Rick's biological baby.

HeyCarl,1xnizw,Sensual_Hitler,3,Wed Feb 12 00:53:18 2014 UTC,"The joke could have been portrayed better, but he is referencing the newest episode of TWD where Carl pours a bowl of cereal for both he and Rick, but he discovers Rick unconscious. Carl thinks he's dead and Rick doesn't get his cereal."
HeyCarl,1xnizw,Sample_Name,3,Wed Feb 12 02:19:32 2014 UTC,"Again, it definitely could have been portrayed better. I'd guess drunk-posting as well."
HeyCarl,1xnizw,Sample_Name,0,Wed Feb 12 02:34:55 2014 UTC,Ah. Thanks for the clarification. I'm changing my downvote to an upvote.

HeyCarl,1x1xqe,STEVEOOO000,-5,Wed Feb 5 04:56:03 2014 UTC,"It's funny, because they both kind of regret this scene. I worked on-set as a lightning technician, and got to see the aftermath. I wish I had proof.   Ok, so, they did this scene, and upon finishing, the actor who played Carl began throwing a fit. I guess he was upset because he hated being the annoying kid on the show, and he wanted to start from episode 1 (from scratch) but playing the dad. Obviously this wasn't possible, but he was threatening to quit. The actor who plays the sheriff locked eyes with the crying director, and said, ""I got this.""   He sauntered up to the man baby Carl, and began humming ""what do the fox say?"" You could see Carl's cold, dead eyes flicker for a brief moment. Sheriff began humming louder, holding Carl to his teat, Carl struggling to get away and cover his ears. Finally, sheriff began screaming the lyrics, and Carl's eyes ignited, his power level intensifying.   It made for a fun lunch.   Good pic, OP!"
