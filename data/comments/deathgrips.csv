deathgrips,3e2nyp,ArcheTypeAmnesia,5,Tue Jul 21 14:18:44 2015 UTC,"Its status is questionable. All the tracks have the same 'Album' tag and the same art, and there are track numbers attached to the songs. But, the songs are in alphabetical order instead of release order, and the only place they can be found in that order was a2b2.org when Andy uploaded them.   The 'EP' is just a collection of assorted tracks that aren't on any album, plus early versions of 'Takyon' and 'I Want it I Need it', uploaded in the same .zip because Andy felt like it / thought it was the best way to keep their releases organized when he upload their entire (at the time) discography to his website."
deathgrips,3e2nyp,totesnot1bubneb,3,Tue Jul 21 17:52:04 2015 UTC,There are only one version of each Takyon and I Want it I Need it; the exact same recordings appeared on Ex Military.
deathgrips,3e2nyp,happyparallel,0,Tue Jul 21 20:20:25 2015 UTC,takyon doesnt have the outro included on ex military
deathgrips,3e2nyp,boxenstien,13,Tue Jul 21 21:21:05 2015 UTC,1.cause the EP isn't listed as an album/mixtape so people tend to not even know it exists  2.its not an EP it's a couple singles that they released pre-exmilitary that some fan threw into a zip file and called an EP
deathgrips,3e2nyp,eriFpiiH,22,Tue Jul 21 14:21:20 2015 UTC,*andy threw in a zip file
deathgrips,3e2nyp,mrooww,9,Tue Jul 21 14:25:59 2015 UTC,"Plus, all the files in the .zip file are tagged as an album named 'Death Grips'."
deathgrips,3e2nyp,ATadVillainy,8,Tue Jul 21 16:31:02 2015 UTC,What if they want us to put together the EPs
deathgrips,3e2nyp,Prowler_in_the_Yard,6,Tue Jul 21 19:48:38 2015 UTC,"yeah andy threw them all in a zip, but before that they were all released individually on different days. ""Full Moon (Death Classic)"" (03/08/11 - Third Worlds) ""Where's It At (Death Heated)"" (03/09/11 - Third Worlds) ""Death Grips (Next Grips)"" (03/12/11 - Third Worlds) ""Face Melter (How to Do Impossible Things)"" (03/12/11 - Third Worlds) ""Takyon (Death Yon)"" (03/18/11 - Third Worlds)"

deathgrips,3e2nyp,Kangar0oster,3,Tue Jul 21 22:54:04 2015 UTC,"it's weird that LFDV is even listed on wikipedia, especially as an EP, since as far as i know that's a couple of demos that were leaked by someone else (but i can't remember if that story's bullshit or not). i remember deathbomb arc had both tracks from it in some singles compilation at some point as well, but i don't know if that's before or after they were leaked."

deathgrips,3e2nyp,slushcountry,2,Tue Jul 21 21:47:25 2015 UTC,source?
deathgrips,3e2nyp,boxenstien,2,Tue Jul 21 21:52:32 2015 UTC,"well...4chan. /mu/. two youtube uploads, and the titles ""fyrd up"" and ""poser killer"" were attached, but the name ""live from death valley"" wasn't. it's almost certainly from before the RBT archives were wiped a couple years ago, so source on lots of stuff pre-2012ish (i think) is lost. it was a big thread but it was between ExM and TMS so the fanbase was smaller and less obsessed with cataloging everything as extensively back then. i guess it doesn't really matter in the end."

So many lines stick out for me, especially:   ""MY TERRACOTTA ARMY/DIS-ARMS ME/DIS-OWNS ME""  Something about those lyrics conjure up vivid, haunting imagery for me. There's so many more nuggets within this song that floor you with their intensity alone. Amazingly, I didn't fully appreciate Up My Sleeves until much later. It grew on me."

deathgrips,3dyq3v,QueenCharla,14,Mon Jul 20 17:34:11 2015 UTC,I was shocked at how sweaty he was. It was actually somewhat ironic b/c the band was complaining about it being cold when they first arrived.

deathgrips,3dyq3v,sfwsurfing,11,Mon Jul 20 19:02:49 2015 UTC,in another comment OP talks about how they were able to get in early due to a friend working at the venue. OP was probably just blood creeping on the band as they did their warmup stuff.
deathgrips,3dyq3v,sfwsurfing,5,Mon Jul 20 19:26:00 2015 UTC,Nah. I stayed seated. I didn't want to bother them and risk getting my friend in trouble. I just sat and enjoyed the moment.

DG showed up late but I got to see Zach set up his drums and then they did their sound check.   Edit: Andy is not Zach. Zach is Zach.

deathgrips,3dyq3v,saucylove,2,Mon Jul 20 17:33:26 2015 UTC,Andy put together his drums. Other people put together the rest of it. Some were Trees staff and others were roadies I think.

deathgrips,3e36q6,tseawell,3,Tue Jul 21 16:37:36 2015 UTC,Harsh noise isn't just about distorting something until it sounds blown out.
deathgrips,3e36q6,Getjac,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:53:03 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean, that is about 60% of the genre."
deathgrips,3e36q6,QueenCharla,2,Tue Jul 21 17:02:07 2015 UTC,"But that's all that the video is. There is still a lot of skill involved in the pacing, tone, and progression of noise music. The music is gonna sound dull if it's all just blown out distortion for 4 minutes. There is so much more the creator could have done with this."
deathgrips,3e36q6,Getjac,2,Tue Jul 21 18:26:20 2015 UTC,I was honestly expecting this to be more than just blown out Guillotine; maybe the instrumentation would be noise but Ride's voice would still be audible at least. It would've been so much better if it wasn't just Guillotine coming out of a crappy speaker.
deathgrips,3e36q6,QueenCharla,2,Tue Jul 21 18:40:14 2015 UTC,"What you should've done is take the instrumental stem and bass boost that to hell and then lay the original vocals on top of that, adjusting the volumes accordingly"

We almost didn't get in because my ticketmaster account locked me out (FUCK YOU TICKETMASTER BURN IN HELL), but the people at the box office were kind enough to use my ID to find me in their system I guess and print out our tickets. I hung out in line with a kind friend that I had made a month earlier when I bought my ticket from him for my bestie. Met at least ten really great, fun people while in line who made the long wait worthwhile. Shout-out to everyone there. Being in that line was actually fun thanks to you guys.  Fantano was standing up in the mezzanine. I made a heart sign at him from the pit and he got all flustered.  I nearly died moshing to Break Mirrors. Their performance of that song is in my opinion the best thing I've ever seen them do live. I fell twice during that song and started getting trampled but both times a random stranger grabbed my hand and pulled me out of the chaos.  I drank a good gallon or so of water and was part of this pulsing, enormous bulking mass of sweaty people colliding together and screaming. I was speeding hard so it was all fifteen times more intense in my head than it normally would've been.   Best of all, my bestie and I left that concert with a new friend as well. We met someone right after the show when he bummed a smoke off of me. He had a hotel room nearby so we took him there and chilled for a little while in the city. He claimed to have been a part of the NLDW ARG and to have communicated with Andy in the past. Crazy shit, man."

deathgrips,3dw763,sedentarygorilla,8,Mon Jul 20 04:58:50 2015 UTC,"Inverted cross - upside cross as seen on mayhem albums, etc; sign of the left-handed path recently co-opted by children with blogs. Crossfader - piece of audio equipment most commonly associated with DJs, allows you to control the amount of volume each feed is getting (as seen in OP image). Death Grips frequently have the last line of a lyric play into the next line being said, a kind of lyrical overload that I really enjoy  - see the following line  ""rush balls to da wall bitch slayer rainin blood, burnin paper ""  pause between the Slayer...Rainin' Blood in tune with the melody rules, see the classic thrash track Raining Blood by Slayer. They do that shit all the time though with the seemingly end of one lyric playing into the first word or phrase of the next   edit: this is not a personal critique as I'm sure you are a cool dude but imo websites like genius that offer some official explanation for lyrics are a trespass against art; feels absurd to see people speak about someone else's artistic endeavor with authority - as if there is a ""right"" or ""wrong"" way to derive meaning; it's toxic to apply the same analysis you would give to the functionality of a kitchen appliance on an amazon.com review towards something like a piece of music. my bad for going off-topic just a random thought"
deathgrips,3dw763,eriFpiiH,2,Mon Jul 20 06:05:24 2015 UTC,also a thing some DJ's do(mostly scratch DJ's/turntablists)is invert the crossfader so that the right channel actually is on the left end of the fader which is commonly referred to as Hamster Style

I was under the impression that it was just Bjork's vocal samples and the drum sounds (obviously) that were played by Zach. You hear other sounds that Zach isn't making, such as Ride's vocals and whatever Andy's doing.  It's very impressive though, you're right. I actually didn't care much for NotM for the longest time. It didn't feel very Gripsy to me. It was too repetitive and all that. I preferred their NLDW sound more. These days, though, if I want to listen to DG I will generally put on NotM first.

deathgrips,3du4vh,ajbryant,0,Sun Jul 19 18:48:54 2015 UTC,Have a look down at the bottom of the pill bottle
deathgrips,3du4vh,arleybob,3,Sun Jul 19 19:27:09 2015 UTC,"You picked a hell of an interesting time to get into the band. You listened to what's generally considered their worst album. Most people still generally like it, though. Fashion Week is pretty similar to GP, just all instrumental. Niggas on the Moon, imo, is like a better version of GP with a lot of Bjork vocal sampling.  If you like some of the heavier chaotic moments on government plates, definitely start getting into their less electronic-based albums. The Money Store and Exmilitary are raw as hell. No Love Deep Web has a lot of the electronic influence, but is much more hard-hitting than GP was. Save Jenny Death for last. It's a combination of several styles in a way that is somehow both chaotic and beautiful."
deathgrips,3du4vh,piratecovejoe,3,Sun Jul 19 14:40:07 2015 UTC,"Very nice, thanks for the tips. Why is it an interesting time to get into them?"
deathgrips,3du4vh,rainbowcookies55,4,Sun Jul 19 15:05:37 2015 UTC,They have so much variety in albums at this point that it seems to me it would be pretty overwhelming just now getting into them haha. Many of the readers here have been into them for quite a bit so we've had more time to digest all these weird stylistic changes and big surprises they throw on us.
deathgrips,3du4vh,arleybob,4,Sun Jul 19 15:26:29 2015 UTC,"Probably just because they released what is, for all intents and purposes, to be considered their final album, so ajbryant may think it's a little overwhelming getting into them now vs. following each of their releases as they appear. It almost feels like you can get into them now if you want, but it's not the same as it would be if you were there from the beginning, following Death Grips and trying to figure out what they will do next. It's been a wild ride.  If you're really interested in the band in general, I'd recommend simply listening to the albums in the order in which they were released. I'd personally skip their first EP just because. I'd start w/ Ex Military, go to The Money Store, then No Love Deep Web, Government Plates, Fashion Week, and then The Powers That B (double album). (edit: It would also be cool if you had some kind of a book or video or something to reference which can help you understand the context in which the music was released. Death Grips play a lot with social media and the idea of band/audience interaction, and this interaction really shaped the way we hear the music. Someone made a ""movie"" which might help to explain things concisely. I haven't watched much of it myself but it seems okay, especially for someone who's just getting into DG.)  If I'm having a good listening session, I personally like to have the lyrics handy while I listen. It can be hard to understand what's being said but they have a lot of interesting things to say.  Anyway that's just me."
deathgrips,3du4vh,Gjengjeldelse,3,Sun Jul 19 17:51:55 2015 UTC,I'd personally skip their first EP just because.   except Next Grips. hell of an underrated song.

You're right though. The idea of them making nothing else after the tour is just as likely as them continuing to produce music. We have no idea what to expect at this point."

If you want something like the first four tracks but more aggressive, then head out into No Love Deep Web and see what you like.  On that note, do we have like a flowchart for Death Grips albums yet"

Yes, I am educated, English is my native language, and no I am not a small child. Why you think this extremely small nuance in the English language is common knowledge among English speakers is beyond me, but I suggest you stop pretending that you're smarter than everyone else just because you know this extremely small and unimportant nuance in the English language.   Also, for the record, your condescending ""let me google that for you"" link didn't lead to any explanation of why ""me and my son"" is correct over ""my son and I"".

The thing is he just sounds nothing like Death Grips. Sure, they both have aggressive performances, but then again so do many other rappers. Just because they both use noise in their songs does not mean they ripped each other off. By this journalist's logic Blackie is ripping off the Beatnigs and dalek who both had noise influences in their work. This journalist is just trying to start a beef between Blackie fans and Death Grips fans, even though a lot (if not most) Death Grips fans are Blackie fans and vice versa. Hell, a collaboration between the two would probably be fucking amazing.   TL;DR - Blackie is not a bad rapper, the journo is trying to start a pointless beef which has a bullshit precedent. Blackie sounds nothing like Death Grips."
deathgrips,3dp1q5,StormGaza,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:48:06 2015 UTC,"dont give these fuckers views, heres the article:   If you want to irritate a ride-or-die Death Grips devotee to the point of a conniption fit, watch them stroke out when B L A C K I E’s name surfaces. One of the most tirelessly antiquated and nonsensical arguments concerning the B L A C K I E vs. Death Grips debate is the “It’s just music” fallacy. Death Grips fans dismiss the fact that the band did rip off B L A C K I E. Turning a blind eye to the DIY culture where the Houston noise-rapper cut his teeth takes for granted the esoteric nuances found in his music. Ultimately, the fact that Death Grips became popular falls short of the real issue: they never acknowledged B L A C K I E’s influence on their “art.”  The most obvious indication stems directly from place and environment. B L A C K I E hails from La Porte, a place dubbed “Chem City” for its towers spewing refined petroleum into the atmosphere. During the day, the flames from the plants burn like a dying star. Contrast this scene with the beach vistas promoted by the city’s Chamber of Commerce, and the splendor feels and smells processed. That dismal view pervades itself throughout the production work of B L A C K I E's self-titled EP, Spread Luv and GEN. Nothing is clean within the production. The grime and acridity is not contrived; it is real, and it fills the spaces with the same sharpened strands of toxic air that punctures lungs.  On the other hand, Death Grips’ No Love Deep Web fails to recreate that atmosphere. Each track sounds forced and unspontaneous. Instead of reflecting a distinctly genuine environment, it becomes a disingenuous pastiche of B L A C K I E’s DIY “Fuck the False” sound. “Black Dice” sounds like it was sampled directly from “Who Protects Us from You?” “No love” repulses in its strange karaoke rendition of “The Safety of Poverty,” where MC Ride barks and screams in the same low register while using cadences too comparable not to call bullshit.  Houston’s rich hip- hop culture, especially the sacred tradition of Screw music, also separates the wheat from the chaff. In its infancy, Screw music reflected H-town’s inner-city decay and dispossession. “Big Big Joke Jokes” from B L A C K I E’s Wilderness of North America champions the same ethos found in this region’s most influential art form. “I Write on Money” drags in the same way the earliest manifestations of Screw music before the rest of the world discovered it: it swings low, it flosses, it waits. You can hear Big Moe singing in his signature melodic, yet guttural baritone over the beat.  Hearing “The Fever” from Money Store flashed the first signal of Screw music mis-replication. Like someone putting swangers on a Smart Car, you just can’t front. MC Ride false claims throughout the track with a whopping cough rant. B L A C K I E’s raw cadences make their way into MC Ride’s mouth, but pale in comparison and lack B L A C K I E’s regional authenticity like a b-movie actor histrionically flaunting an embarrassingly phony English accent. Except in this case, MC Ride sounds like a Wesley Willis impersonator attempting to flow like B L A C K I E.   When Death Grips performed on the same bill on the same night as B L A C K I E in 2011 at Fun Fun Fun Fest Nites, their sound possessed an electronic bent that also contained some peculiarities found in B L A C K I E’s music, namely bursts of noise and jagged beats. But it lacked the same grittiness found on most of B L A C K I E’s records. However, when No Love Deep Web was released in 2012, the gloves came off. Their DIY persona was shattered by the news of Death Grips' signing to a major label. To wit, B L A C K I E responded:  @b_l_a_c_k_i_e is tweeting himself & slaying you mainstream acts one by one” — B L A C K I E 10/02/2012  Straddling the majors while playing a disingenuous game of “Look at my DIY cred!” became obvious. B L A C K I E began his adventure in 2005, and everything that has come from him has come out of his pocket. He cannot strike a phony posture. Those who have had integral roles in the DIY noise-rap scene know the truth, and fans of both artists began calling Death Grips out. Their success felt patronizing. With no mention of the man behind the “Fuck the False” credo, they attempted to pass the music off as their own. And as Morrissey wisely stated a long time ago, “Cause there’s always someone, somewhere/ With a big nose who knows/ And trips you up and laughs/ When you fall.”"

I enjoy bother artists, but B L A C K I E is much more of a noise/punk artist than Death Grips which skirts towards more traditional hip-hop styles (well until Powers that b).  I don't see a huge amount of overlap, but again I guess you can't have two black artists doing something similar because ah em gee tokenism.  Not to mention the factual inaccuracies of the article.

deathgrips,3dpmxv,oMINDSPINo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:42:00 2015 UTC,"he takes a really long time but he always delivers (heh) eventually   I don't know why people say this and defend him. If I order something offline, it sure shouldn't need to take half a year, let alone a whole year to get it to me. Period.  If I was told it would take months, that would be very okay but if you receive your package after 10 months of waiting and then go and just say ""Don't worry, he will get it to you"" and believe this guy is running a business effectively and treating his customers with respect (Allegedly deleting comments and never getting back to people's emails), then I don't know what to tell you. (This was not aimed at you /u/berlinwood100, just everyone in general who defends Orm after they get there stuff.)"
deathgrips,3dpmxv,berlinwood100,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:02:14 2015 UTC,"I don't defend him really, I think he definitely needs to contact his customers saying if there are any delays instead of the tape just showing up at your door randomly, but I also think it's unfair to say ""I don't know if I'll ever get it"" or shit like that. Because while he's either really lazy or really busy, he's definitely not a scam artist."

deathgrips,3dnur0,SupremeGrips420,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:31:51 2015 UTC,But have you been to a hiphop show before? With a group as big as DG?  They always amp up security for hip hop shows because there's more violence.
deathgrips,3dnur0,bleachtemple,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:59:47 2015 UTC,"Admittedly, the only other hip-hop show I've been to was a smallish Killer Mike gig, and there was no security there."
deathgrips,3dnur0,icantdecideonausrnme,7,Sat Jul 18 07:12:51 2015 UTC,"Security at the Boston show was more intense than I had ever seen at The Paradise. Empty pockets, thorough pat-down, detector wands, bag searches etc. This is a venue I had once smoked a blunt inside of with 2 friends during RX Bandits, now rifling through my friends purse, went into her glasses' case, found a ride-home-blunt, and threw it away."
deathgrips,3dnur0,bleachtemple,3,Sat Jul 18 18:04:29 2015 UTC,"Ah man, that sucks. At least there wasn't any legal trouble with cops.  People in ATL were still lighting up joints inside, though. I'm assuming they brought them in with cigs or something."
deathgrips,3dnur0,icantdecideonausrnme,5,Fri Jul 17 21:32:30 2015 UTC,Here in Houston they've warned us for pat down. I think your theory might be true.
deathgrips,3dnur0,SupremeGrips420,4,Sat Jul 18 03:06:30 2015 UTC,Maybe during the patdowns one of the security guards will place Jenny Death in someone's pocket.
deathgrips,3dnur0,bleachtemple,5,Sat Jul 18 00:10:55 2015 UTC,I felt so safe when I saw the level of security going on in Asheville. I hope when I see them in Charleston the security level is the same.

deathgrips,3dnur0,Conemen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:06:14 2015 UTC,"Philly here it wasn't because DG is a hiphop act it was because some one called in threats to the venue and had been doing so since june.

deathgrips,3dnur0,NineInchAngels,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:52:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just wondered if it might have been at the band's request and, if so, why? People are mentioning threats, so that could definitely be it."
deathgrips,3dnur0,sfwsurfing,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:29:41 2015 UTC,"I think it was requested by Death Grips themselves.  The situation was the exact same thing in Asheville, NC and the crew were getting trained how to use the metal detectors and give patdowns just before the doors open."

deathgrips,3dounk,ericwilldiesoon,2,Sat Jul 18 04:04:40 2015 UTC,"in your opinion, what is the difference in sound between the vinyl and cd? I personally feel like the low end in the money store + the powers that b are lacking on the cd..could be how they mix though."
deathgrips,3dounk,somelittleboyinblue,2,Sat Jul 18 04:13:17 2015 UTC,Honest to god I've only hard vinyl and mp3 of both the money store and tptb.  What I find with vinyl in comparison to mp3 is that some sounds are balanced differently. On top of that sounds are less clashing / cluttered.
deathgrips,3dounk,ericwilldiesoon,3,Sat Jul 18 04:59:01 2015 UTC,"Nerdy vinyl rant ahead, if you don't like it, don't read it:    I collect a lot of vinyl and actually only buy albums from bands it they have them on vinyl. I refuse to buy CDs anymore. The artwork is always 100x better with the vinyl format.  Having said that, I can tell you that vinyl naturally has a worse sound than digital. It's a dated and frequency-limited format. The only reason it got the reputation of being more ""pure"" is because when digital/CD first came out, it was complete shit and was absolutely worse than records. So it had a tainted reputation that lingers to this day. The truth is, the technology has long since caught up with itself and digital recordings are as ""pure"" as you're going to get now.   What makes vinyl more appealing is that it adds a sound to the recording that you can't get with a pure digital recording. its like adding a squeeze of lemon to your purified water. Hip hop and R&B in particular sound amazing on vinyl and cassette. If you compare modern metal albums on vinyl and digital, it sounds like shit on wax because metal music is so fucking dense and layered with sound, the vinyl format can't properly capture all the frequencies. However, some metal bands know this and use it as an aesthetic to add to the sound, to give it a sort of lo-fi shittiness to it that ends up sounding really good.   I highly doubt that the record version of TMS has more bass because if you mix a vinyl record with too much bass, the needle of the record player literally gets bumped off and skips all over the place. Whenever a band has a digital and analog release (if they know what they're doing) they get two different mixes and masters of the songs for their respective formats.   TL;DR: hip hop naturally sounds badaass on vinyl because reasons  Fun fact: colored records (anything other than black) actually sound even worse because the dyes in the plastic degrades the audio capability of the materials. Bands only make them because they know hipsters will buy them up like hotcakes."
deathgrips,3dounk,ericwilldiesoon,3,Sat Jul 18 07:45:21 2015 UTC,"My copy of TMS (2nd press, 2012, no NLDW/pill sticker/insert besides the lyric inner sleeve and download code) sounds completely dreadful even after a deep cleaning, the labels are also extremely fragile which makes cleaning the records a tedious task. I got a tiny bit of water on the Side 1 label and the last ""e"" of ""I've Seen Footage"" vanished."
deathgrips,3dounk,GoldDeloreanDoors,2,Sat Jul 18 14:01:29 2015 UTC,"wow, yeah fuck that.  Case in point.  Bums me out that it seems like DG don't really give a fuck about the quality of their records - from the mastering to the packaging, I've heard bad stories.  I guess it goes hand in hand with their ""don't give a fuck"" attitude as a band."

To tie in with this, the tracks on Jenny Death are the most ""Death Grips"" songs of their discography, which could be a send off of sorts to the first era of Death Grips, which is more song oriented. As another send off to this first era of Death Grips, they do a huge tour to end it with a bang, complete with all of the ""bangers"" of their discography. Of course, I'm positive that this is almost definitely completely retarded and wrong. It's just a fun little theory I had that doesn't have too much basis."

Hyperbolic example: ""August 7th is the day that Saturn's third most outer ring has a slightly purple tint due to the passing of Spectre 97 Asteroid passing by leaving a shadowed reflection this must be the date that Robert Patterson arrives in the Batmobile with the Death Grips gang and announces their campaign for the 2016 election!""

If the venue is small-ish, be wary of standing in the entire middle front of the stage. When my concert started everyone pushed and essentially the room/space went from bare able to absolutely none. I made it to the front two rows but was smothered. I eventually backed off and leaned towards a wall to my left.  If I didn't forget my plugs, it would of helped a little situation I had. Some chick jumped into my chin and it fucked up my left ear. The vibrations of the bass and everything just continued to sting whatever was wrong with my ear, so earplugs in general would of be a blessing. It was very loud, ringing in my eyes the entire night."

deathgrips,3dj7ik,gigahertz_,3,Fri Jul 17 12:34:55 2015 UTC,"It will make a huge difference where you stand in the crowd. If you're right up front it won't be as loud as it will be if you're further back where the front of house speakers are more likely to face you (pretty obvious). Honestly if you aren't putting your ears through strain with loud music/noise on a regular basis, not wearing ear plugs will not be the end of the world. Also keep in mind a lot of ear plugs will affect how you hear the music; they generally boost the lower frequencies and cut the high end a bit meaning stuff like Ride's screams or the cymbals/snare will be more comfortable to listen to."
deathgrips,3dj7ik,Magicapricot,2,Thu Jul 16 21:56:06 2015 UTC,Can anyone recommend some good earplugs that won't ruin the sound?

It helps prevent tinnitus. And I don't know if you've ever heard the ringing in your ears 24/7, but that shit can drive a person insane. So if you want to protect yourself from hearing loss and tinnitus, I do suggest ear plugs. It's not ""being a pussy"", it's having some respect for the fact that most concerts are loud enough to cause permanent damage."

deathgrips,3dgezk,Toughnutt,14,Thu Jul 16 06:14:24 2015 UTC,"Everything said here is all good, if not great.   Also:  1) Wear earplugs. If you don't have 'em, go get 'em. Even the cheap ones from the dollar store work as well as you need them to, so go for it. You won't be doomed or immediately lose your hearing if you don't wear them, but for the sake of avoiding an annoying ring lasting throughout the evening, buy a pair.   2) You might end up encountering fuckboys and dudebros at points during the show -- don't let this hamper your experience. Unfortunately these types of people are in abundance in the world and they will especially run rampant at these sorts of shows, but it's all up to you as to whether or not you let them affect your night. Chances are the crowd around you are just as annoyed and pissed off at them as you are, so don't let their shittiness make you feel isolated in your perception of them.   3) If at any point in the show you feel like your breathing's getting faint or things are starting to go all tunnel-vision, just move your way towards the back. People won't care about your moving your way through them towards that half of the venue as they'll understand what your deal is. Fainting at shows sucks, and even though you'll get picked up once you drop, it still sucks enough to know you could've avoided it had you just made your way toward a lesser-populated area.   4) If you're getting a tour shirt, get it before the show. Those sell out the quickest and it's very likely you won't be lucky in securing one for yourself should you wait until after the show to make your purchase. Most shirts tend to stay in stock, but that one piece of apparel tends to become scarce due to their value once the tour wraps up."

Even the cheap ones from the dollar store work as well as you need them to, so go for it.   I'd actually recommend not getting cheap ear plugs. I brought ear plugs for the show but they were generic terrible plugs and they just took out the high end and made the entire show sound like shit. It frankly would have ruined my experience so I took them out almost immediately and sucked up my continued hearing damage.  They make much better quality plugs which aim to just reduce general decibel levels though, so invest for the Grips, hearing the show from underwater sucks!"

deathgrips,3dgezk,Conemen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:57:50 2015 UTC,"The ""moshing"" isn't really intense because there was only room for it towards the back of the crowd. The intense part is in the center a few people back from the barricade. That's where everyone is compressed together so tightly there isn't room for any moshing. Its gonna be like 110 degrees while you're being crushed by a hundred people. I personally loved it, but I couldn't hang there for the whole show and I had to move back to catch a breather. I've been to a least 20 metal concerts, and the Death Grips show was much more intense than anything I've seen, but its not because of the moshing."

deathgrips,3dgezk,NietzscheanPopsicle,3,Thu Jul 16 03:49:32 2015 UTC,"1 - Please make sure you drink plenty of fluids before the show. If you plan to be up front in the push pit, you will sweat a lot of it off the duration of the set. I failed to do this and was suffering from dehydration after the show, and my group of friends and I were rushing to the bar to get me a drink. I must of slammed five glasses of water before I felt OK again. Stage security will be nice enough to hand out water bottles to pass around up near the front. I was lucky enough to get a little swig from one of those at least. I should have gone back to the bar, but I managed to squeeze up front and center and didnt want to lose my spot.  2 - Also, I didn't wear ear plugs. I went to to the show in Philly last Friday and I can still hear a slight ringing in my ears. I had ear plugs with me at the time, but was so enthralled when they came out on stage, I totally forgot to put them in. Prepared to experience at least some mild tennitus if you choose not to wear ear plugs, even if you're in the back. The shit is loud.  3 - Keep your phone (or anything else that's fragile/prone to break in water) in a plastic bag. My iPhone was drenched and hard to use after the show (touch screen was all slippery). Took me forever to call my friends and figure out where they were because I couldn't slide the cursor to unlock my phone.  4 - Dress in cool clothing, like shorts, some comfortable shoes, and a shirt you're not afraid to get soaking wet in everyone's BO and possibly torn from moshing. All the body heat in the venue really builds up. You get sticky fast.  5 - And just have fun. Most of the people I ran into were pretty awesome - even the ones I thought were going to be dickheads. Don't be an obnoxious dickhead. There was some dude beside me up at the front, last half of the show, who kept pushing his elbow into the side of my head, but I don't think he realized he was doing it. It gets so packed up at the front, people don't know what to do with their limbs, haha. So don't take offense to it, just make eye contact with the person and let them know you're uncomfortable. As a solution, he ended up putting his arm around me and it's like we were buddies, LOL. Enjoy the show on stage, but also be a little conscious of the people around you.  6 - Also, I felt a little crazy after the show. It might have been all the adrenaline. Don't be surprised it you feel a little outta your head. It's like a little PTSD - but not in a bad way. More just being in a state of extreme awe that you just witnessed one of, if not the best performances of your life.  Apologies in advance if I restated what others have already shared."

Try to crowd-look as minimally as possible (but keep track of your purse/wallet, etc.) You get to see Death Grips LIVE, but only in the moment. Make the most out of this opportunity! -Make sure you do grab that tour shirt. I was lucky enough to snag one in my size, and they're both comfortable as well as hella stylish. But BE WARNED: they are 100% cotton shirts. For safety, turn the shirt inside out before washing; this will further protect the print. Make sure to wash it with cold water. Then let it air dry, perhaps using a shirt hanger or an old-fashioned clothesline. Do NOT use a dryer; it'll be shrunk before you can say ""oh no!!"". This procedure can be applied to all cotton shirts. -Don't frame The Money Store poster you might buy. Your mom/dad/guardian might get mad. -Wearing black is important. Even though no one really cares about how you look, you'll blend in better. Don't be like me and wear a sunny yellow t-shirt while everyone else is draped in black."
deathgrips,3dgezk,lqzypants,2,Thu Jul 16 04:25:26 2015 UTC,I agree with point one 100%. I find myself looking to much at the crowd and then realizing afterwards that I don't even really remember what the band looks like.

deathgrips,3dgezk,Andreslargo1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:31:55 2015 UTC,"I thought about that after I made the post. 😅 Yeah, you'll probably have to do some pushing and squeezing to get back to your spot. But it's not like people are going to go out of there way to prevent you from doing so. They'll probably let you through as long as you make your presence and intentions known. In regards to the merch, if you plan on buying an arm's worth or more, I'd say bring a backpack. You may look a little dorky, but it's the functionality that counts. You don't want to drop your shit and have it trampled. And if you want to get closer to the ferocity, go for it!! It'll be harder to get up to the stage than it would be for the round trip to the merch booth (buy merch first, before making the plunge) but you'll be RIGHT THERE! If you plan on getting closer, be prepared for the mosh, and wear close-toed shoes- trust me. At metal or punk concerts and stuff like that, I'd advise not going into the crowd, as they can get really intense, and often times violent, but you should be safe at Death Grips' concerts. Usually it's a lot of people your age (which initially surprised me), and not kids that will seriously hurt you or be negative to your experience- a lot of the kids there seemed reay happy and positive to be there. But overall, enjoy the band and have fun! Just be safe."

deathgrips,3dh9je,johnsterisboss,3,Thu Jul 16 08:06:24 2015 UTC,its like that on the official release too
deathgrips,3dh9je,boxenstien,3,Thu Jul 16 09:31:58 2015 UTC,What a fucking let down!!!!

deathgrips,3dh9je,sunlips,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:45:09 2015 UTC,Yes!
deathgrips,3dh9je,arleybob,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:38:45 2015 UTC,Yeah the official release doesn't have the sample at the end of Lord of the game either.
deathgrips,3dh9je,baphomet7,3,Thu Jul 16 20:13:13 2015 UTC,It sounds good on a good piece of kit.
deathgrips,3dh9je,PlacidBurrito,2,Thu Jul 16 13:23:09 2015 UTC,Sounds pretty good to me
deathgrips,3dh9je,icecreamboy,2,Thu Jul 16 07:56:53 2015 UTC,Mine has a noticeably loud surface sound at first but it goes well with the loudness of that album. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it sounded if you love dg you will love it
deathgrips,3dh9je,Antipartical,2,Thu Jul 16 12:56:43 2015 UTC,"Mine sounds pretty good, considering it's a bootleg"

deathgrips,3deicy,yksnivarts,3,Thu Jul 16 15:40:18 2015 UTC,It's pretty tiny too. Should be one of their more intimate shows of the tour.
deathgrips,3deicy,OG_Pow,2,Wed Jul 15 18:32:35 2015 UTC,St. Andrews Hall (Detroit) was also tiny. It was fun.

deathgrips,3deicy,Andreslargo1,3,Wed Jul 15 19:22:48 2015 UTC,"I've never been good at defining genres. One review wrote that we sounded like a combination of The Mars Volta, The Doors, and The White Stripes so I've always stuck with describing our sound like that. We also got a shit ton of comparisons to the Arctic Monkeys (probably from all the minor keys we wrote songs in) and Circa Survive (which we were admittedly all massive fans of)."
deathgrips,3deicy,OG_Pow,2,Wed Jul 15 19:27:28 2015 UTC,That's awesome man! What was your band name? I'm in a band now called creamcheese dream. We have no recorded music and have only played one show but were still the shit
deathgrips,3deicy,Andreslargo1,2,Wed Jul 15 19:33:26 2015 UTC,"PMed you the band name. Keep living the dream, man. That's the kind of attitude I like to hear. Always work on perfecting your craft and give reason a people to keep coming back to see you. Don't over saturate your hometown market by playing too many shows. Play sparingly and give people a reason to come out. Build up hype."

deathgrips,3deicy,Andreslargo1,8,Wed Jul 15 22:09:41 2015 UTC,Shit was pretty crazy. Ride's shrieks on WABGL were way more fucked up than i thought they would be. I learned today I'm too fat for the pit and could only stay in that bitch for like 3 songs. I was the dude with the beard and the bear tanktop on if I talked to anyone from here.
deathgrips,3deicy,Nomzee,2,Thu Jul 16 06:01:57 2015 UTC,The shrieks and all of Inanimate Sensation were the best part of the performance I thought. Damn the whole thing was amazing though.

Did ride sweaty waves of ppl. Felt like the inside of a clothes washer. Did leave pre maturely (~11?). No oxygen. Escaped through side door. Was dying. Could not see straight. Was heaving in streets. Met homeless man who gave me water and by all accounts was incredibly generous and kind considering the circumstances. Ended up sharing cigarettes. Thanks Toby. Returned to show that had just ended. Etc.

He had a Tool t-shirt on and so her response was ""Like I'm going to trust the guy with the fucking Tool shirt on (laughs)"" as a total sleight. So his response was ""Whatever, bitch"".

There are a lot of people in the fanbase, to be fair, who do act like that, but most of them aren't real fans of the band; they like the idea and high concepts in their music, not the actual music. I love their stuff, I think the blend of prog rock and alt metal is fantastic, and they have a lot of creative ideas and fantastic songwriting. They need to hurry the fuck up with the new album though."
deathgrips,3deicy,blckgoogle,2,Fri Jul 17 13:34:43 2015 UTC,Intense but not as intense as I thought it would be.

deathgrips,3ddz0f,spoonman1015,2,Wed Jul 15 15:55:07 2015 UTC,"jesus i know. I fucking can't get into Bosnian Rainbows and dare say i HATE Bosnian Rainbows because it ended Omar's solo streak which was SOOOOOO good... and yeah I really hope we see El Grupo again... :(  EDIT: I like Terri and I like Deantoni and Omar but somehow.. I think they're all better doing their own shit and not together... It's so weird.  EDIT2: And i wanna make it absolutely clear I love Terri Gender Bender Mr.Tolstoi is soooo good, she's great. But my god I fucking hate Bosnian Rainbows..."
deathgrips,3ddz0f,jebrinklog,7,Wed Jul 15 15:57:16 2015 UTC,"There is an album by Omar, Zach and Juan called Mantra Hiroshima. I enjoy it even more than Cryptomnesia."
deathgrips,3ddz0f,Villecruz,2,Wed Jul 15 20:06:21 2015 UTC,Its cool you don't like bosnian rainbows. everyone has their taste. Hey if you like teri and le butcherettes come join the subreddit! https://www.reddit.com/r/lebutcherettes/
deathgrips,3ddz0f,Villecruz,2,Wed Jul 15 22:29:50 2015 UTC,"Y'know I don't think I hate them... I don't really hate many things by the pure definition of hate, but I just had this surge of great music from Omar's solo stuff during weird years in my life, during high school. He was a constant source of awesome music for so long and I thought if he'd stop that for something, it'd be something i liked, but now that I think about it he just stopped doing solo stuff entirely and probably would have even with out Bosnian Rainbows.   So I guess I just feel SAD that he hasn't released anything in a while, but I know everyone needs a break sometimes. Just got so use to his prolificness.   And sure! I'll come join, loved Sin sin sin, amazing all around album  EDIT: wow this is a small sub. hope it grows."
deathgrips,3ddz0f,timpturbose,2,Wed Jul 15 22:36:41 2015 UTC,"Awesome. Yeah can't wait what omar means with the ""soon"" post he made. Yeah I try to spread the word of r/lebutcherettes, If you can please refer to the sub if anyone you know likes the band :)"
deathgrips,3ddz0f,Gnalmex,0,Thu Jul 16 01:00:17 2015 UTC,Le Butcherettes opened for the Melvins and they were the most grating talentless trash to listen to
deathgrips,3ddz0f,CleverLyricReference,2,Thu Jul 16 12:46:00 2015 UTC,"Apparently there is one other finished Omar Album with Zach on it but it was never released, although last year Omar said it will eventually get a release."
deathgrips,3ddz0f,GoldDeloreanDoors,4,Wed Jul 15 18:07:11 2015 UTC,"My favorite of Omar's solo albums, got it on vinyl, Shake is for 8th graders into the next song is my favorite of the songs. So fucking good, man. I want the rest of Cryptomnesia. I wish they would've toured too </3"
deathgrips,3ddz0f,kiki2k,3,Wed Jul 15 16:36:13 2015 UTC,This would go down in history as one of the most epic collaborations of all time.
deathgrips,3ddz0f,kiki2k,3,Wed Jul 15 17:28:31 2015 UTC,"Get along?  I'd wager they have never met, and will never meet."
deathgrips,3ddz0f,svies,0,Wed Jul 15 19:38:29 2015 UTC,But how can you know that for sure? Omar and Zach Hill worked on a things for a while.
deathgrips,3ddz0f,mikerallus,2,Wed Jul 15 19:40:40 2015 UTC,"That album came out in 2009, and knowing Omar's propensity for holding onto shit forever, god only knows when it was actually recorded.  Couple that with the fact that no material has come out since, and that talented people are in no way required or even expected to hang out with each other just because you think it would be neat, and I'm calling a 150% chance that it hasn't happened and will never happen."
deathgrips,3ddz0f,tcex28,3,Wed Jul 15 19:44:01 2015 UTC,"god only knows when it was actually recorded.   Summer '06, although Omar & Zach last released material at the end of 2010.   If I had to guess, I'd say Ride and Omar haven't met but Zach Hill has a very ""polyamorous"" and prolific, and even recurring, past with a lot of other prog musicians in his general geolocation. He brought in a prior collaborator for Jenny Death in Reinhart and he very obviously maintains contact with others he's established close musical relationships. Acquaintances meet friends' acquaintances so ruling out them ever meeting seems a little overly confident to me!"

I feel he has to be working on something though. BR and Antemasque aren't touring...but we haven't got any sneak peeks from anyone."

They then repeat the process X amount of times amplifying features from amplified features until faces of dogs are everywhere."

deathgrips,3d6kbm,swangintotomorrow,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:55:56 2015 UTC,"I think of GP as being stuck in a never ending nightmare you can't wake up from. It feels like a wheel, no end in sight. The Whatever I Want music vid where you see Stefan lying on a bed basically confirms it for me."

I would agree with the common feeling that their genre progression feels like an organic lifeform becoming a cyborg. Jenny Death feels like the coalescence of every direction they've gone in their discography, as well as an embrace of rock's sonic palette, the energetic essence of which has always been very present in their sound. They've fused all the aggressive music forms into a new rock, as alien to modern music as rock was when it first emerged."

deathgrips,3d7k1w,zetzo27,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:13:36 2015 UTC,"13 is actually a very important number in certain historical, spiritual, and cultural discourses. The most familiar example of 13 in popular culture is Friday the Thirteenth. This day, which is usually considered unlucky or ominous, has had this reputation since the 19th century, according to Wikipedia. However, the number 13 has this connotation in more general contexts. For example, many buildings omit the thirteenth floor in cultures where this number is considered unlucky. In fact, the fear or phobia of the number 13 is officially called triskaidekaphobia, pointing to the ubiquity of this phobia. The reasons why the number 13 has so many superstitions attached to in Western culture are complicated and polycausal. The main reason, however, is due to the fact that 13 is considered a powerful number as such - one need only observe the presence of the number thirteen in variegated circumstances across cultures divided by time and space, with both good and bad connotations attached to it (one apparently 'good' example is the thirteen fundamental principles of the Jewish faith as set down by the great Jewish thinker Maimonides; another which may be more familiar to the average American is the significance attached to the number thirteen due to it being the number of the original colonies that comprised the United States.) Why the number 13 has such power attributed to it is lost to the mists of time, but for a band which is as obsessed with numerology as Death Grips is, it's plain to see that they would find a number as polysemic as 13 immensely attractive. Having both positive and negative connotations, the number thirteen, like Death Grips itself, is 'Beyond Good and Evil'."

I was close enough to make solid eye contact with Stefan and scream lyrics with him multiple times. He was feeding off of the crowd so much. I saw him smiling, a beautiful smile. It felt like 150° in front of the stage. I went as hard as I do when I see Converge, which is 100% hard. I can't wait for Afropunk.

deathgrips,3d766q,reesermadness,2,Tue Jul 14 15:12:34 2015 UTC,"Eight I believe. So in other words, nine ir nine thirty considering their track record."

deathgrips,3d766q,mahoogie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:06:15 2015 UTC,Yeah they only had 1 guy I heard so me and my buddy just decided to get ours online. The show was so wild!

deathgrips,3d766q,FrostedPoptart,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:46:48 2015 UTC,"First earplug free? So like, you only get literally one earplug, or one pair?  Edit: great username"
deathgrips,3d766q,QueenCharla,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:57:10 2015 UTC,"To those who have been to this venue before, is it clear where one needs to stand to get in line, especially if you're getting there early? Also, how far in advance should you get there if you wanna be against the fence?"
deathgrips,3d766q,Satans-Asshole,2,Tue Jul 14 23:56:31 2015 UTC,"The line usually starts at the gates in the front and wraps around the right side down a sidewalk, so yeah it's clear where you need to go. And people will probably be showing up like an hour or two before the doors open I would say (maybe sooner), so get there kinda early. And even if you aren't in the front of the line, you can always just slither your way up to the front of the crowd without being rude and you shouldn't have a problem."
deathgrips,3d766q,HardRocker180,2,Tue Jul 14 02:06:45 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for the heads up!"
deathgrips,3d766q,Satans-Asshole,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:14:09 2015 UTC,"If you wanna be against the railing then probably at least 3 hours, if not more. Got to asheville about 2.5 hours early, didn't have the opportunity to get against the railing, not that I was looking to"
deathgrips,3d766q,Burpleberry,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:17:41 2015 UTC,Three hours before doors open or three hours before the supposed start time?
deathgrips,3d766q,Satans-Asshole,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:11:16 2015 UTC,Before doors

deathgrips,3d766q,throwaway_2390432,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:15:34 2015 UTC,"Depends on where you wanna be. If you wanna be against the gate, most likely, yeah."
deathgrips,3d766q,Satans-Asshole,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:35:01 2015 UTC,Where are you guys planning to park? I've never been to the venue and I don't know the area that well.
deathgrips,3d766q,mahoogie,4,Tue Jul 14 13:40:52 2015 UTC,Don't park on Ponce De Leon or at Murder Kroger unless you want your car broken into.
deathgrips,3d766q,throwaway_2390432,2,Tue Jul 14 02:26:22 2015 UTC,I knew something was off about that Kroger.
deathgrips,3d766q,foolygrips,2,Tue Jul 14 13:18:26 2015 UTC,"There is a street running along the side of the masquerade, with a dirt lot near the end of the street on the left side. There is a lot of space, but I would still recommend getting there early"
deathgrips,3d766q,Burpleberry,-2,Tue Jul 14 15:34:54 2015 UTC,"Park at murder Kroger, free parking"
deathgrips,3d766q,thenewguy729,3,Tue Jul 14 02:29:13 2015 UTC,Cars have recently been booted there so park at your own risk.

The grabbed and threw me out,  But the fucking bitch ass security guard took it before i could make it to the door."

deathgrips,3d766q,imquittingthecult,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:01:43 2015 UTC,I saw someone with long curly hair exiting the venue with a drumstick that my friend thought was Zach's. I'm curious to find out if someone got it after all.
deathgrips,3d766q,1_0293_8475_6,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:04:08 2015 UTC,"Saw you as well and was hoping you would make it, considering I'd thought of doing the same before the show even started. I was too fucking tired by the end though lol"

Look for the (probably noticeably) crossfaded skinny fuck with a black button down, black skinny jeans and all grey converse. We're a chill group of people, so if we have any left we'll probably smoke someone out. Just don't ask, we'll offer. This'll be my first time seeing DG, so let's make it a wild night!"

deathgrips,3d766q,Eyesakperets,-3,Tue Jul 14 02:05:51 2015 UTC,"Sadly it wasn't too crazy.  Lot of people just standing around doing nothing.  Of course, I think I saw a bit of a mosh up front but I couldn't even see it because the iron wall of people standing still wouldn't let me through.  Come on, people, it's fucking death grips, it's okay to freak out.  Like why even go up front if you're not even going to move your body?"
deathgrips,3d766q,writhinginnoodles,2,Tue Jul 14 23:21:15 2015 UTC,"People were crazy for the first five or so songs, but so crazy it was exhausting. I got tired really, really fast."
deathgrips,3d766q,le_sweetie_man,2,Tue Jul 14 01:39:26 2015 UTC,"That's what happened to me.  Me and this one guy were pushing each other around for a little while but that was the extent of the craziness I personally experienced.  I think he got overheated cause he was sitting out after a couple of minutes into the show, same thing happened to me a song later.  I've never gotten so close to passing out so quickly."
deathgrips,3d766q,writhinginnoodles,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:04:51 2015 UTC,"Don't complain. Everyone there was fucking loving it, whether they were moving or not. That's what counts."
deathgrips,3d766q,Jamanjax18,0,Wed Jul 15 16:42:45 2015 UTC,That's quite a generalization.
deathgrips,3d766q,writhinginnoodles,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:47:37 2015 UTC,"No, not at all. Did you watch the fucking crowd? Everyone was either going crazy or reciting lyrics at the top of their lungs,"

deathgrips,3d766q,Jamanjax18,0,Wed Jul 15 22:17:29 2015 UTC,"lol, ok?  No need to throw a piss fit just because someone disagrees with you.  I enjoyed the show.  All I said was I wished the crowd was more energetic."
deathgrips,3d766q,writhinginnoodles,0,Thu Jul 16 03:50:11 2015 UTC,"It's more the fact that you're bitching because people weren't acting as you thought they should, dumbass."
deathgrips,3d766q,Jamanjax18,0,Thu Jul 16 05:07:47 2015 UTC,"Lmao, why do you give so much of a shit what I wanted from the show?  It's almost like you didn't enjoy the show as much as I did :)"
deathgrips,3d766q,writhinginnoodles,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:07:43 2015 UTC,"Well given that I'm not the one bitching about it, I doubt it."
deathgrips,3d491k,bukkaketrutles,124,Mon Jul 13 11:58:34 2015 UTC,"sometimes i wonder if zach thinks about that when he's drumming a show. just like fuckin' poundin it out on no love when he makes eye contact with some greasy dude in the crowd, and thinks ""that dudes seen my dick"""

deathgrips,3d491k,DieserMann,-14,Mon Jul 13 12:13:17 2015 UTC,That's the gatefold
deathgrips,3d491k,Zinchism,39,Mon Jul 13 12:14:36 2015 UTC,"well, it's still the cover for Niggas in the Moon. Same goes for Jenny Death, whilst in the gatefold it remained blank."
deathgrips,3d491k,Lasifer,-2,Mon Jul 13 12:18:04 2015 UTC,Are they really albums though? They're discs 1 and 2
deathgrips,3d491k,Zinchism,2,Mon Jul 13 14:23:28 2015 UTC,It's a double album. Which is comprised of two albums. Yes.
deathgrips,3d491k,ZubatCountry,32,Mon Jul 13 14:29:35 2015 UTC,"That's not what a double album is, though. Despite the misleading name, it's just a term for when the album is divided into two physical discs. Disc doesn't equal album."
deathgrips,3d491k,ChaosSpeed,4,Mon Jul 13 15:31:21 2015 UTC,Didn't Death Grips call it a double album on the napkin?
deathgrips,3d491k,stokeyou,14,Tue Jul 14 14:03:29 2015 UTC,TIL Pink Floyd's The Wall is two separate albums.
deathgrips,3d491k,Cryotechnician,8,Mon Jul 13 23:24:35 2015 UTC,That's not what a double album is lol
deathgrips,3d491k,Zinchism,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:41:26 2015 UTC,"They're still separate covers, for separate releases."
deathgrips,3d491k,Cryotechnician,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:04:34 2015 UTC,"I mean, Jenny Death wasn't really a release, as it in itself was never officially released."
deathgrips,3d491k,Zinchism,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:31:07 2015 UTC,"Niggas on the Moon was initially released separately from The Powers That B.  It's also worth noting that Niggas on the Moon wasn't technically ""officially"" released on its own either, it doesn't have to be official.  That being said, many people already had Niggas on the Moon separately from Jenny Death, and simply downloaded Jenny Death separately from Niggas on the Moon. Downloaded an unofficial release, if you will."

Make sure he has earplugs and honestly he should probably head out before the show starts and sit in the car and read or something since he'll probably be mega bored"

It's calming to me. RORCAL - La Femme sans Tête Extremely frightening sludge/black metal album with a ton of noise, reverb, and ambient/drone sections. Absolutely perfect recording as well, really perfect for this kind of metal. Monolord - Vaenir Another perfectly recorded heavy piece of metal, though this is of the more traditional doom metal/stoner-doom style, a la Sleep or Electric Wizard. Seriously, this thing is HEAVY. Steve Von Till - A Life Unto Itself One of the main members of post-metal band Neurosis doing another solo album of acoustic folk & americana, which perfectly fits his deep gravely voice. Love this stuff, really nice to do work to. The Hudson Horror - Nemesis Melodic death metal done right; really sounds like At The Gates, though in my opinion a lot more savage with a MUCH better vocalist (it almost sounds like an At The Gates/Cannibal Corpse collab since the vocalist in this group sounds like both Tomas Lindberg and Corpsegrinder, along with the melody + absolute brutality)"

When MC Ride jumped into the crowd I felt the place squeeze as the side railing leaned over to watch, mid railings close to jumping off and joining the pit and the pit pushing towards MC Ride's body! I'm glad you enjoyed it as much as I did, It was one of the best shows I've watched, and the the songs in person are something not from this planet.  P.s. I watch your videos regularly I wish I got to meet you, didn't know you attended until after the show was over :("

I duplicated the track in Audacity, used a feature called Vocal Remover on the second track, which removed the main vocal track and just left the backup vocals, then turned the volume up on them so they go WITH the original Inanimate track, not just the backup vocals on their own..."

deathgrips,3d0tl5,Golemo,20,Sun Jul 12 15:55:19 2015 UTC,I'm sure they're doing great. Not sure about rolling in it but not only are they sold out shows and selling a ton of merch but they're also on tour solo so they aren't splitting the show profits with anyone else so they've got to be doing pretty good.
deathgrips,3d0tl5,joshuahuntkc,9,Sun Jul 12 16:22:53 2015 UTC,"Was just discussing this last night. Most shows have at least 2-3 bands total. This tour is sold-out across the board and they don't have to split with other bands, just venue, promotors, agents, etc. Def reeling in fat cash as far as that's concerned. Who knows how much if any they owe to Epic but this tour is definitely setting them on the right financial direction. They deserve it."
deathgrips,3d0tl5,Kangar0oster,15,Sun Jul 12 20:14:48 2015 UTC,They are probably getting a 8-10 gs  guarantee w /accommodation .  And selling at least 2-3 gs worth of merch a night. ( they have a nightly sales cap) ..  So that. Minus  - 20% management fee  - merch costs (3$ a gildan to print plus 1color setup fee per design 20$ a pop)  - 10% for the booking agent  -  van rental (they are rolling in a sprinter so that's maybe 150$ a day with driver plus an suv ive heard?  - gear rental?  (looks like they are bringing there own monitors)  - merch guy costs.. Maybe 50$ a day plus daily by out for food.  I think they are all gonna come home with well over 10gs each.. Plus of they are selling out the show there will be overages which is money you get from the venue for killing it!    Hope this helps it's vague but you get it

deathgrips,3d1ipg,FlyingPiranha,3,Sun Jul 12 19:45:19 2015 UTC,"I got to Union Transfer closer to 6:45 and was still only one person behind the rail for the entire show. Obviously getting there early gives you a better shot at a good spot, but a lot of it comes down to how well you can work the crowd and taking advantage of gaps.

I came about an hour before the doors opened at the Webster Hall show in NY, so it might not be as comparable to Dallas, but I was probably around the 100th person in line - your results may vary.  As soon as you get in rush to the line for the shirts and you should be fine.  You may have to sacrifice your place in the crowd for a bit, but you won't be able to get a shirt otherwise."

deathgrips,3czaga,swimfellow,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:31:58 2015 UTC,"I went in and out of line for Philly a few times but I was there from 2 hours before doors on -- got to see the band walk in, hear soundcheck,  and had a great view in the pit and at the side the whole time. Highly recommend the bullshit of standing in line -- the pros outweigh the cons."
deathgrips,3czaga,Toughnutt,5,Sun Jul 12 08:45:51 2015 UTC,"5'3"" 18 male, average body -- not too skinny, not too much mass (so some of my advice won't apply to taller people, but here goes) -- I was 2nd row for a while in Philly and it was a fun time -- essentially if you're into moshing, you'll have a decent time.  OP, you won't have this problem, but part of the reason I eventually moved way to the side is because I'm a smaller guy and the pit would've been unsustainably exhausting for the whole show. I did actually move into front row for a little bit (and Stefan screamed directly at me a few times -- was good), but larger people pushed me out of the way, which is expected. If you're not all the way up against the barrier, or if you get pushed out of the way, be prepared to sometimes stand at like a 30 degree angle with the ground -- as long as you can keep your footing and deal with the insanity around you, you'll be ok.  A larger reason I moved to the side though is my other short friend hated the pit and moved directly out -- wanted to be a good friend. Plus, the side was a great place to get some video.  Note that the show is exhausting -- by the end, even though I'd been around calmer people for much of the entire thing, I definitely had lost the energy I had earlier in the show. When I got home I pretty much passed out on my bed.  Oh yeah, also, earplugs are a must up close -- I had them out for a while during the show, and I can honestly say that for me, I could hear it better with 32db earplugs in. Could've been the volume at the Philly show though.  Overall, have fun! I was worried about the pit leading up to the show all the way until it started, but I can honestly say that I had an immense amount of fun and didn't have any worries whatsoever during the show. It was always a blast, and generally just a great crowd to be around. You guys rock."

deathgrips,3czaga,FlyingPiranha,2,Sun Jul 12 05:17:56 2015 UTC,"In Philly the front row was about 80% fighting not to pass out or fall and 20% actually watching the band.

deathgrips,3czaga,Ralouch,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:34:39 2015 UTC,i'm 20 and 5'6. I was in the front and in the mosh pit.
deathgrips,3czaga,swimfellow,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:59:32 2015 UTC,"hey i just got back from the d.c. show. i'm 20, 5'4.5, and weight 105 lbs (i'm also a girl if that makes any difference?). i got to the ""second"" row, if you wanna call it that, before the show started but the split second the first note dropped everyone pushed very very hard so i might as well have been in the front. it will be really hard to keep your spot but if you have good grip strength you should be fine. also, if you really wanna stay in the front all night, BRING WATER. i cannot emphasize that enough, even if you just let the people flounder around you, you will sweat out everything you have so quickly. also be prepared to feel a bit suffocated at times. sorry for wall of text but i'm still post show hype haha. have fun!!!"
deathgrips,3czaga,Ralouch,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:26:01 2015 UTC,Thank you! I definitely plan on bringing some water after hearing that. I'm so fucking pumped
deathgrips,3czaga,swimfellow,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:29:40 2015 UTC,get some ear plugs as well. i decided to buy some at the venue (they were only $1) and i left with no ringing and the show still sounded amazing. :) if you feel bold you should try the pit later in the show once you've seen them up close. it's really fun.
deathgrips,3czaga,Conemen,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:35:40 2015 UTC,I'm sure in the moment I'll feel bold enough! And I have some pretty nice hearos earplugs that I usually bring to shows that I'm for sure going to wear.

deathgrips,3cuvky,Toughnutt,8,Sat Jul 11 04:58:39 2015 UTC,What was the moment last night?
deathgrips,3cuvky,swimfellow,9,Sat Jul 11 05:08:24 2015 UTC,"Zach hit a water bottle against his cymbal in Philly and water went flying everywhere (including onto Andy's laptop and wires surrounding it) and the bottle went into the crowd. The music abruptly stopped (and Andy replaced one of the wires, we think) and there was an intense silence on stage for a bit. It was honestly sort of an incredible moment, and it fit the show really well, IMO.  Partial Video"

Wheres the best place to meet them (some artists hang out at the bar for hours after a show)?   and most of the responses I got were ""death grips hates their fans and dont interact or sign shit.""   I was scared to bring my exmilitary or my government plates.. So I brought the numbered edition of The Money Store."

I made sure that I wasnt holding both when i approached them. i was afraid they were going to think i was trying to flip one.   I accidentally elbowed a kid in the mouth. I felt his tooth dig into my arm and then he held his mouth and ran away. I felt bad, not intentional.   blood stained shirt: http://i.imgur.com/BUtARSr.jpg"

Acid was not quite so chill.  It made me feel really wild and primal during the set and while that was nice, it did leave me with a sense of anxiety and dread that kind of ruined the trip.  After the set I guy I didn't know said ""Dude you were an animal in there.""  I thought to myself, ""I had to be."""

deathgrips,3cw1oc,northernburzum,3,Sun Jul 12 15:11:46 2015 UTC,I totally didn't expect when Ride jumped into the crowd.  The security was so stringent about taking down crowd surfers so I figured he wouldn't either.  But when he did that was fucking amazing.  Does he usually stage dive?  I was in the upper balcony and it was so cool to watch everyone get so hyped and bounce around.  Watching the crowd was nearly as cool as watching the band.  DC impressed me tonight.  I did notice that the crowd was wayyy more hype for Money Store songs than stuff from jenny death not sure what that's about.
deathgrips,3cw1oc,AnnaFreud,3,Sun Jul 12 04:53:07 2015 UTC,Probably too tired from going insane
deathgrips,3cw1oc,ViewtifulDude,3,Sun Jul 12 05:02:49 2015 UTC,"flew in from seattle to catch this show, huge thanks to gordon_freeman89 for the hook-up. actually the best show i've ever seen in my life. part of that is personal: this is a band i believe in deeply, that feels IMPORTANT & truly UNIQUE. i am so grateful to be present while their story is still writing itself. the only other group i have felt this way about is animal collective.  those feelings are going to imbue the performance with some sort of special energy regardless of how well the performance goes. to be completely honest, this is how i felt about the first death grips show i caught during their 2012 tour: important, but not GREAT. great crowd, great music, great energy (zach, in particular, was amazing)... but the backing tracks sapped spontaneity, the sound was muddy & stefan struggled noticeably with breath control.  last night was a different story. stefan has improved substantially as a frontman, both in terms of his vocal performance & also his ability to command a stage. he was mesmerizing to watch throughout, controlled but intense. no disrespect to zach or andy, but he could have controlled that audience all by himself. (that said, the band was super tight & the reintroduction of andy into the band was vital to bringing that spontaneity that was lacking in the 2012 tour) moreover, this kind of music (punk? industrial? hip-hop?) fucking slaps in a live setting.  nobody on this thread will have been surprised by the setlist, but hearing the way that it flowed in concert was revelatory. there were no breaks, quick cuts to the next track, abbreviated versions where appropriate. it sometimes gave the impression of listening to a death grips megamix. the vibe & pacing ebbed & waned, but the pressure & intensity (both from the band & the crowd) never ever let up. i was particularly pleased with the ""big house""/""this is violence now"" interlude, where the show seemed to briefly transition from a punk show to a rave.  i mean fuck, 9:30 club went hard last night! maybe the most intense crowd i've ever been a part of. by far the best moment for me was crowd surfing for the first time to the outro of ""guillotine"". that is a moment i am still hype about, & one i will remember for the rest of my life.  only disappointment was that i wasn't able to grab a tour t-shirt or ""money store"" poster but it's hard for me to get too down on this. i'm still bathing in the afterglow."

deathgrips,3cw1oc,Orgcore,2,Sun Jul 12 02:04:22 2015 UTC,"This show was insane, one of the most energetic shows I've seen in a while! Every time I tried to take a pic of them, it came out blurry as fuck due to them killing it on stage, and constantly moving...iPhone camera couldn't handle it.  Was a little bummed that pretty much all of the merch was sold out when I finally got inside, but I'm glad they're getting paid. Guess eBay it'll have to be to snag that tour shirt. Had a great time with all you guys! Stay noided."
deathgrips,3cw1oc,Gr1ef,2,Sun Jul 12 02:35:58 2015 UTC,This was my first hip hop concert. It was incredible. So glad I went

deathgrips,3cw1oc,Carfrito,2,Sun Jul 12 05:41:50 2015 UTC,"I've watched tons of videos of Zach playing over the years, but to finally see the man play in person was absolutely incredible.  I thought the way they were effected, particularly the snare, really added a different dimension to the songs, along with Ride's vocal echoes.  Andy might also be the only ""keyboard"" player who makes it look cool."
deathgrips,3cw1oc,SheWhoErases86,3,Sun Jul 12 05:47:29 2015 UTC,"Bought tickets for this show the very minute they came out. I called maybe 3 or 4 times the week before they went on sale just to be sure when they were going on sale.I ended up leaving class for 30 minutes to get signal then proceeded to buy them on my phone.   Later, about one week later, I find out that my mom bought plane tickets for a vacation thousands of miles away and I wouldn't even be in the area anymore.   I ended up just giving my tickets to my friend because I couldn't sell them."

deathgrips,3cw1oc,MintyTruffle,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:44:18 2015 UTC,If they do it'll be overpriced. I'd suggest stopping at cvs/Walgreens/rite aid and picking up a pair.
deathgrips,3cw1oc,DC_SHOW_EARLY_PLS,2,Sat Jul 11 19:50:41 2015 UTC,I was overjoyed when the merch dude said they were only $1.

Again, Ialready have a ticket, just want that early access!  It's worth it to me after traveling all this way.  Some kind of proof of you being in is all I require (a pic is fine) and then I'll send the money immediately.  I was told they let those first 30 people in at 5:00PM (19 mins from now) but the venue staff is very chill every time I've talked to them so I bet if you're inside and give your ""early position spot"" up to me"" they'll let you back in the front of the line since that's where you started in order to get in...don't quote me on that though, def would recommend asking staff first if that's a concern for you.  Sorry if this post breaks any subreddit rules!  Not buying or selling tickets, I already have one, literally just a place in line.  PM me quick if you're down!"

deathgrips,3cw1oc,Mammies,2,Sat Jul 11 20:50:27 2015 UTC,"Sorry, it's because this is my last chance at seeing DG and the people at the front against the stage or barricade really don't move and can see and breathe and such but even being a few rows back at my 1 other DG show I'm too short and can't see anything and get squashed and for seeing them at the final show being up front is worth the money to me"

deathgrips,3cw9e6,theharabara,3,Sat Jul 11 08:43:55 2015 UTC,"At 0:04.  I think Drozd's guitar was sampled for the hook, starting with when Ride says ""When you come out, your shit is gone"" in-song.  Edit:  What was the other thing you heard?"

deathgrips,3cw9e6,Tiagulus,2,Sat Jul 11 16:15:35 2015 UTC,"it's not a heartbeat, it's somebody walking down the street, passing a club or concert for which ride is the bouncer (ey no ins and outs)"
deathgrips,3cw9e6,melting_imitations,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:14:25 2015 UTC,"Oh that's true.  Does sound like it, I hadn't noticed.  Definitely makes sense that if they sampled this at least once, there could be others."

deathgrips,3cs1pe,Spooty75,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:03:59 2015 UTC,I agree with Anne Bonny but Whammy or just BRSOTS would probably be the best out of the last half of NLDW. Pop doesn't stand alone too well and ADITW is too weird lyrically.

deathgrips,3cqizk,eyeofnoble,2,Thu Jul 9 23:53:45 2015 UTC,Just get a L. How tall are you? And I'm not sure about downsides yet besides torso length. I'd assume the quality of the material isn't as hot as the real deal though. Hood is a little crinkly also.

I wear a size medium mostly and heard you were supposed to order way bigger so I ordered an XL... fits very slim on me. ORDER ONE OR TWO SIZES BIGGER OR IT WON'T FIT YOU!

deathgrips,3cmwaw,docrevolt,2,Thu Jul 9 13:25:34 2015 UTC,"The pit was kind of ridiculous last night at Webster. I was expecting a regular punk-style pit but there were dumbasses throwing punches, flailing around, windmilling, moshing straight into people who fell down instead of picking them up... Just really stupid stuff. I liked the vibe from a lot of the crowd but the idiots doing that seriously made me mad, they were acting like they were at a fucking metalcore concert instead of Death Grips."
deathgrips,3cmwaw,docrevolt,2,Thu Jul 9 04:46:37 2015 UTC,I felt that more so tonight.. Anything that came from the stage wound the pit up. Seemed to be less falling but more shoving. Strange thing was I saw no one attempt to crowd surf.
deathgrips,3cmwaw,mustbetreeman_,2,Thu Jul 9 04:55:16 2015 UTC,"Huh, really? The no crowdsurfing thing is definitely strange. And moshing can be a lot of fun when it just involves being rowdy and knocking everyone else around, but once it starts involving actively hurting people it gets really obnoxious."
deathgrips,3cmwaw,BornAgainZombie,2,Thu Jul 9 05:55:01 2015 UTC,i saw atleast 2 people try to surf
deathgrips,3cmwaw,mvrinxz,2,Thu Jul 9 06:45:39 2015 UTC,"I was up on the balcony, spotted maybe 3-5 crowdsurfers the entire show. Pretty low given what I've been hearing from other shows."
deathgrips,3cmwaw,Arthurlurk1,2,Thu Jul 9 06:49:57 2015 UTC,"Whats a ""regular punk-style"" pit... enlighten me!"
deathgrips,3cmwaw,selsunblue,6,Thu Jul 9 07:41:17 2015 UTC,Pretty much not deliberately punching people in the face n shit and respecting others so they don't get seriously injured Like if they fall on the floor
deathgrips,3cmwaw,docrevolt,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:11:25 2015 UTC,The few times I fell in the pit at Webster people helped me back up.  I think the people falling over or running into downed moshers were too out of it or exhausted to move in another direction after being pushed.
deathgrips,3cmwaw,FyuuR,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:58:31 2015 UTC,"I know that's vague. I usually call the good kind of pit moshing and the bad kind slamdancing, but I know those terms mean different things in different areas so I didn't wanna confuse anyone. Pits at punk shows (also some metal, some heavier indie, emo, stuff like that) usually involve running around, bumping into each other, shoving, just being rowdy but not causing anyone else serious injuries. Dumbasses throwing punches and aggressively flailing tend to end up hitting everyone around them, and I've seen way too many people get seriously injured in pits like that. I watched a few people get punched in the face or kicked while they were on the ground by people who were doing dumb shit like that, which I really didn't expect to see as a DG show"
deathgrips,3cml7j,blakedanjr,9,Thu Jul 9 02:05:25 2015 UTC,"Bring earplugs. You and I are the same age, and I saw Swans pretty recently; I wore earplugs to that because I don't wanna go deaf before I'm 20/have tinnitus for the next 50-70 years. Death Grips doesn't play quite as loud as Swans based on the concert reviews but few bands do, and Death Grips is still really fucking loud.  Also, drink a lot of water before you go, and if the venue lets you, bring a water bottle with."
deathgrips,3cml7j,QueenCharla,6,Thu Jul 9 02:31:33 2015 UTC,"+1 for water, make sure to really hydrate before the show so you don't have to buy overpriced water from the venue."
deathgrips,3cml7j,wizerd,2,Thu Jul 9 03:36:19 2015 UTC,will do
deathgrips,3cml7j,QueenCharla,2,Thu Jul 9 03:51:22 2015 UTC,"so water and earplugs. got it. any suggestions as to where i should sit/stand? the earl shows' pits were nothing im assuming compared to these. im contemplating standing in the back so i dont get fucked up. even at one of the earl shows, people started falling like dominos and my upper body ended up in the pit and i took a foot to the head."
deathgrips,3cml7j,QueenCharla,5,Thu Jul 9 02:44:08 2015 UTC,I actually haven't gone to any of the DG shows (so many sad cums over that) so I'm not entirely sure as to the best place to stand. If you wanna go home without bruises and such I'd suggest not being near the railing since it sounds like there's a lot of shoving right against that.
deathgrips,3cml7j,QueenCharla,2,Thu Jul 9 02:51:38 2015 UTC,good point. what brand plugs did you buy/use
deathgrips,3cml7j,bmil35,3,Thu Jul 9 02:54:50 2015 UTC,"Can't recall the brand, just got some standard working stuff from an OSH or some other hardware store. They worked perfectly for Swans though; pretty sure they blocked out 32db."
deathgrips,3cml7j,wizerd,2,Thu Jul 9 03:04:05 2015 UTC,"32 dB. ill look for some around there. on an unrelated note, ive been wanting to try swans out recently; what album do you suggest for me to try??"
deathgrips,3cml7j,jadesaddiction,3,Thu Jul 9 03:08:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly, they have so many and so many different sounds, it's hard to be succinct.  If you want something more industrial and noisy, go with Filth. They have some folky stuff, and with that try The Burning World. Their best albums to me are their new stuff, especially To Be Kind or The Seer. If you really want a sampler of almost everything they've done, try Soundtracks for the Blind, though personally it's a little hard to sit through because of how long and disjointed it is."
deathgrips,3cml7j,swangintotomorrow,2,Thu Jul 9 03:27:34 2015 UTC,"gonna try filth first, im a fan of noise and more industrial sounds.  probably check out soundtracks for the blind to see what i like by them to then pick a more specialized abum. thanks!"
deathgrips,3cml7j,jadesaddiction,2,Thu Jul 9 03:50:47 2015 UTC,I wore these to the show at Webster Hall. I was in the balcony as far back as I could get and I'd say the show sounded a little louder than conversation volume. I heard everything perfectly fine but Hearos also has also has high fidelity ones.
deathgrips,3cml7j,infamoushippo,8,Thu Jul 9 03:33:30 2015 UTC,"All these suggestions assume that you're gonna go ham in the pit.    I wore boots and the toe box got pretty thrashed... (But I did have a friend in tennis shoes and he was fine, up to you).  If you wear glasses either secure them well or wear contacts Keep your jacket in the car, and maybe take a change of clothes if you plan on spending the rest of the night on the town. I got so sweaty from the pit that everything in my pocket was soaked (a waitress questioned me why my money was so wet) and I felt disgusting walking around like that. I thought the show was rad without drugs. You may agree, you may not, but definitely don't feel like you should cause it's Death Grips, you'll enjoy it either way."
deathgrips,3cml7j,Golf_wang7890,5,Thu Jul 9 03:42:14 2015 UTC,I brought my eyeglass case and kept them in bag check with my bag. Glad I did that since I got elbowed in the face.   And yeah. Extra shirt (or the tour shirt is fine if you bought it!). I was soaked in sweat and water and it's been 24 hours and it isn't dry yet.
deathgrips,3cml7j,maranon,3,Thu Jul 9 03:51:00 2015 UTC,"like i said earlier, im planning in staying away from the pit this time, maybe once i see how the show is and know what to expect, ill head into it. planning on wearing tennis shoes, they've done me well at other shows. i do wear glasses since my eyesight is ass, not sure what ill do about that issue. i know all too well about the sweat, ill probably pack at least an extra shirt. and like i said before, im 16, i may fuck around with drugs later in life but i have shit to get done rn that they could interfere with. so ill be sober."
deathgrips,3cml7j,boxenstien,2,Thu Jul 9 03:56:14 2015 UTC,"In reference to that last point, I am certain that I had an acid flashback at their show in Toronto. I felt one with the performance and the pit, faced death and felt absolutely no fear. The main hallmark, however, was the intricate 2D fractals."
deathgrips,3cml7j,trashsleeper,6,Thu Jul 9 04:44:25 2015 UTC,"32 decibel earplugs were perfect. Heard everything but it was reasonable and I was all the way in the front and by the speakers at one point.   BRING WATER HOLY SHIT. I was about to pass the fuck out. Drink a lot before the show. Bring enough money to buy water since most venues won't let you bring any in.   Wear light clothing and good shoes. I was a sweaty mess and my feet kept getting stepped on. Be careful.   Bring a portable charger for your phone and charge it before you go in so you can take pics or send texts if you lose friends in the pit.  Eat beforehand please. I didn't and because of that, I almost passed out of starvation and dehydration and it ruined the show for me. Eat enough at least an hour before and eat more afterward.   Most importantly, have fun. You'll make tons of new friends and it's gonna be fun. Stay safe and be prepared!"
deathgrips,3cml7j,Arthurlurk1,4,Thu Jul 9 03:49:29 2015 UTC,"17 year old here, also avoiding tinnitus. Do yourself a favor and check these out. If you're starting to go to more shows, these will come in very handy. I've got a set coming in the mail for the Houston show next Friday!"

deathgrips,3cml7j,boxenstien,12,Thu Jul 9 02:07:52 2015 UTC,confirmed: boxenstien doesn't care about your hearing
deathgrips,3cml7j,sfwsurfing,7,Thu Jul 9 02:25:53 2015 UTC,Wow. He's a mod and supposed to look over all of us and protect us. I feel betrayed
deathgrips,3cml7j,boxenstien,5,Thu Jul 9 03:01:40 2015 UTC,"No; The show will be VERY, VERY loud. Indoor venues are generally louder and death grips will more often than not be mixed and presented more like a metal or hardcore show than anything, so all amps will be turned up to 11. Ear plugs will allow you to enjoy your hearing at a later date without distorting the music.  If you actually think ear plugs aren't worth it, take them anyways. They can be stuffed into a pocket if nothing else, it's not like they cost a lot of money."
deathgrips,3cml7j,CircularUniverse,2,Thu Jul 9 02:52:02 2015 UTC,do you know a good brand to buy? i wanna be confident im not getting ripped off
deathgrips,3cnd3l,D34th5trok3,7,Thu Jul 9 06:28:59 2015 UTC,"Yes you can justify it because it will be fun and worth it. You cannot justify it because Death Grips gave most of their music to is for free – the face value goes to DG, promotors, etc. The rest went to the scalping piece of shit."

deathgrips,3ckjr9,elimars,6,Thu Jul 9 19:13:34 2015 UTC,"There's not much to say about last night's show that's already been said but I can say this. My favorite hat got ruined, my glasses broke, by the first half hour of the show I looked like I had nearly drowned in the Hudson River, and, oh yeah, it was the greatest fucking concert I've ever been too. It was my first time in a mosh pit and that was an experience. I expected to sweat but I never expected Death Grips to actually install heat lamps and turn the whole room into a sauna. That was harrowing in and of itself but when the stage started to glow red and the smoke engulfed the curtain out walked the silhouette of one MC Ride. It was as if the devil himself emerged from the seventh circle of hell. The aesthetic alone was beyond worth the price of admission. The experience of being tossed and pushed by the crowd as if in an angry ocean, just made the experience beyond anything I could have imagined. Broken glasses? oh well! Ruined hat? It happens! Seeing the most cutting edge and sonically relentless bands I've ever heard do what they do live made me feel (Excuse the cliché) beyond alive! 10/10 Would rage again!"

It's one of those rare albums that gets better every time you hear it, because you're always catching lyrics or sounds you never noticed before, or finding new meaning in them. I think it's DG's best album because of that."
deathgrips,3cl18v,FlyingPiranha,6,Wed Jul 8 23:28:19 2015 UTC,The absolute labyrinth
deathgrips,3cl18v,icantdecideonausrnme,17,Thu Jul 9 11:49:45 2015 UTC,why do you think public opinion with this album has shifted so much? Because NOTM is a huge grower; the kind of record that takes many listens to be appreciated for all of its subtle nuances. Typically more experimental music only catches up to the listener with time.
deathgrips,3cl18v,inspire_thefuture,6,Wed Jul 8 19:13:25 2015 UTC,"that goes for all of death grips really. at first everyone is just ""lmao what"" but it's just grown on the people here. notm was just even more experimental than usual"

I remember being suicidal for a few days and feeling like nothing would change, and for some reason this album came along on an especially bleak day and it just shifted my whole perception of shit, it felt like when I listened to the album I just existed in a whole other place and I would just go on walks for hours listening to it"
deathgrips,3cl18v,spoonman1015,7,Wed Jul 8 19:52:17 2015 UTC,"I get in that place, too sometimes my man. Their music always seems to help me because Ride is so honest about his suicidal feelings and it's a reminder that everyone has struggles. stay strong."
deathgrips,3cl18v,inspire_thefuture,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:17:45 2015 UTC,The idea that those feelings can inspire you to scream and smash things instead of groveling is incredibly empowering & a huge part of the band's appeal.

It came at the end of a particularly emotionally exhausting few weeks and then was part of my routine for the next few days.

deathgrips,3cl18v,BornAgainZombie,5,Thu Jul 9 06:46:31 2015 UTC,"I thought notm was the best dg project thus far the day it came out on first listen and i still do. mainly because i'm really into experimental music as it is and i highly respected what they were doing. it just resonated with me on first listen, and it's completely understandable why it took a while to resonate with others."
deathgrips,3cl18v,25-8punkweight,4,Wed Jul 8 20:07:50 2015 UTC,I loved it on first listen and I was always surprised it took so long to click with people. I'm glad opinions are changing on it though
deathgrips,3cl18v,joshuahuntkc,2,Wed Jul 8 19:48:39 2015 UTC,"i think it's my favourite release by death grips, the one that really hooked me up on them (with voila if i remember well). the opinion shifts because it is their most experimental and out there album. there are no big bangers with crazily loud and heavy instrumentals (like in come up and get me), no real rythm that is usually carried by andy morin. there is just zach going crazy, weird bjork stuff and ride that is not even screaming (so it seems less violent and maybe less atractive). long story short it's really different from everything they've done before so fans had to listen to it a lot for notm to grow on them"
deathgrips,3cl18v,thisnamemaybeused,2,Thu Jul 9 00:10:43 2015 UTC,Niggas on the Moon has been my favorite since it came out.
deathgrips,3cl18v,Cryotechnician,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:34:51 2015 UTC,"When I first listened to NotM the thing that stuck out for me was the weirdly bright and bouncy feel of tracks like Billy Not Really, Black Quarterback, Have A Sad Cum and Big Dipper. For once it felt like a DG album that could take place during the sunny afternoon rather than 3.30 in the morning, and sounded just as unique and mystically foreign as that would have to be. I was pretty much instantly enchanted. I don't think I'd have dreamed of calling it my favourite DG album at that point though.  It was over more listens I really woke up to the awesomeness of the other tracks. E.g. Up My Sleeves, which I initially was iffy on to the point of skipping, is now a top 5 - one day somebody pointed out the dead mother lyric that I in my stupidity had never picked up on, and that suddenly blew the whole song open for me, even sonically (the drone Bjork wails annoyed me originally - now I appreciate their amazing existential death march quality, and how well it's paid off when the sound suddenly breaks down into a beautiful maelstrom of glitches).  I guess a lot of experiencing music is down to expectations, and often it takes time/relistening/rethinking to calibrate your expectations to where you really jive with what a song is doing, rather than being unmoved because it's not doing what your brain assumes it should be. I dunno, I pulled all of that out of my ass."
deathgrips,3cl18v,tcex28,2,Thu Jul 9 02:13:41 2015 UTC,I still remember listening to Up My Sleeves for the first time and getting shivers down my back from the instant the Bjork vocals came in. Never has another song done that to me.  EDIT: I should mention it was also the first new release of theirs I was able to digest. I didn't get into them until after GP was released and having absorbed all their early material to the point of obsession. They dropped NoTM out of nowhere and I remember losing my mind.

deathgrips,3cl18v,icantdecideonausrnme,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:32:29 2015 UTC,"<3 that LP - I think it's some of the most forward thinking electronic/hip-hop I've heard for a long time and I was kind of disappointed in the direction Jenny Death went. Was hoping it would build on the production that GP started. I still liked it but it felt a lot safer and way more of a lateral step then NotM did - I really don't get why or how most people didn't get it (6.7lol) , but the first half at least is some of Death Grips best stuff."

deathgrips,3cohs5,wxstx,7,Thu Jul 9 14:32:22 2015 UTC,"Question for everyone (especially for drummers):  Is it even possible for Zach to remember the drum-patterns for each NOTM track?  Also, I think it's nearly impossible to trigger the samples along his V-drumming. He sometimes makes mistakes and changes the patterns (saw it in some live footage) so no one recognizes, but this would be really difficult while re-biulding a track from NOTM.  I think that is mainly the reason. Thoughts?  inb4: live-version, improvised version"
deathgrips,3cohs5,DieserMann,15,Thu Jul 9 15:09:10 2015 UTC,"Drummer here, People don't seem to understand that he obviously didn't play every part at the same time. That would be pretty freaking impossible. He must have done multiple tracks of layering the samples.  But if they play any NotM live he'll just do live drums over top.   Do we remember that he played v drums on all of NLDW? This is no different."
deathgrips,3cohs5,ReallyNotBilly,3,Thu Jul 9 15:34:47 2015 UTC,"drummer here who drums death grips very frequently. honestly, i am a heavy listener of that album, and sitting down and paying attention to the drums multiple times, i memorized all of the general patterns and underlying beats. like i can pretty much play all of it (despite big dipper's solo) without improvising. i mean experienced drummers can pick apart little patterns, and if you do that, you can figure out a lot of the details as well"
deathgrips,3cohs5,25-8punkweight,2,Thu Jul 9 17:32:50 2015 UTC,i'm not sure you could spot the differences if he didn't play it as it is on the album. just like you don't spot the differences of zach's live performance and of the album's drum patterns
deathgrips,3cohs5,thisnamemaybeused,3,Thu Jul 9 16:35:34 2015 UTC,"It's different on NotM, the whole drumming AND instrumentals are done on v drums, so a difference in his drumming would result in a difference in the melody, which imo would be noticeable, though maybe not live since you can't hear every detail."
deathgrips,3cohs5,andykekomi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:14:23 2015 UTC,"of course it could be different and noticable, but if zach hill followed the general melody of the track you wouldn't probably find much difference (plus they get to play really loud and you're too excited to notice or care)"
deathgrips,3cohs5,thisnamemaybeused,8,Thu Jul 9 22:06:02 2015 UTC,"They could very easily just do what they are already doing for the first verse of Up My Sleeves, which is play live drums over the backing track.  I'm sure they have their reasons for not playing much of NotM but that's not one of them."
deathgrips,3cohs5,tcex28,5,Thu Jul 9 15:14:23 2015 UTC,No it doesn't
deathgrips,3cohs5,shenmoki,3,Thu Jul 9 15:34:59 2015 UTC,"As someone else mentioned, there are many different parts to each song, so he could do a new live drum part, as he did with Up My Sleeves on this current tour. They are purposely not playing NOTM songs but I wish they would play the whole album in order."
deathgrips,3cohs5,jebrinklog,3,Thu Jul 9 15:51:54 2015 UTC,"They're playing Up My Sleeves. Also, NotM is far from the first Death grips album to use non-traditional drums."
deathgrips,3cohs5,ajbryant,3,Thu Jul 9 16:40:59 2015 UTC,they're playing 5 songs from each album. niggas + jenny = one album.

deathgrips,3cohs5,SupremeGrips420,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:23:07 2015 UTC,"This isn't the reason. They could play songs if they wanted to, Zach would play normal drums over the tracks. Which is what they do for ALL of their music, which most of them have electronic drums just like NOTM. I don't know if you realized, but their set is just them playing over the album recordings. NOTM would be no different. It's probably their least popular album in general despite this subreddit's odd favoritism for it, and most of the songs would be less enjoyable live. Everyone keeps saying it's because they would need a ""V-Drum"" to play it. Don't you think they've used one to record the shit ton of other electronic drum tracks they have? Why do they play those live instead? It isnt the vdrum, it isn't the complexity of the songs, it's just that NOTM would be shitty live, and they know that."

deathgrips,3cif1f,mellowtooth,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:50:51 2015 UTC,"Yup, they played a few at Boston. Very weird sounds. Kinda makes this particular track seem tame. They were more start-and-stop ish, with the same glitchy rhythms but a lot of weird synth sounds. One of them stuck out like a sore thumb with a thunky, dancy beat that sounded accompanied by muted strings on a bass guitar.

deathgrips,3cgsa3,pxck,6,Sun Jul 12 16:03:58 2015 UTC,"I was considering it, but the crowd was so loud I figured you wouldn't be able to make it out on a shitty iPhone recording. There was a surprising amount of tracks, though. We're talking 5 or 6 entirely new tracks."
deathgrips,3cgsa3,SpiralHam,2,Wed Jul 8 00:37:22 2015 UTC,"Theres a clip of it somewhere deep in this sub, check the early show threads"
deathgrips,3cgsa3,pxck,19,Tue Jul 7 21:55:23 2015 UTC,"It's not remixed jenny death, lyrics over fashion week or any of that.  We had to listen to it for a very long time during the wait at boston and it sounds like production very similar to death grips 2.0 (But it is NOT the song, only similar) with the addition of ride's vocals on the top and at other points his vocals being chopped.  The music sounds very out there and very avant garde.  Some of the weirdest stuff they have made."
deathgrips,3cgsa3,hyperbole_potato,6,Tue Jul 7 20:46:43 2015 UTC,"yup that's where I heard it too. there were so many tracks!! it sounded so finished, like an entire album. I really hope it wasn't just b-sides from the powers that B that will never surface, but it really did sound fresh / new... like a step forwards for them."
deathgrips,3cgsa3,PackieMan,4,Tue Jul 7 22:32:17 2015 UTC,"really? i didn't think it sounded finished. it seemed like 45 minutes of randomly chopped up samples of ride's vocals and zach hill drumming and other noise that they made to play before their show, not an album. imo it'd be the least accessible music (a euphemism for ""worst"") they've put out if it were music they were going to put out."
deathgrips,3cgsa3,Gunmansam,3,Wed Jul 8 03:20:55 2015 UTC,"Saying music isn't easily accessible doesn't mean it's bad. It means that it's harder to appreciate at first glance.  Radio pop is arguably the most accessible music there is, but I feel it's safe to say that by many metrics it's not 'the best'.  Something a bit more out there like Death Grips for example is much less accessible, but many would say is better."
deathgrips,3cgsa3,yayayathecreator,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:42:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with you.  I should've been more clear. I was using ""least accessible"" as a euphemism for worst (imo), not arguing that all uses of least accessible are really just euphemisms for worst."

Lots of bands do it for their shows and it probably took Andy 15 minutes to whip it together and shit it out. As usual, you guys are looking way too deep into this shit.  TL;DR: cud b rael"

deathgrips,3cgsa3,pxck,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:49:47 2015 UTC,In Webster and you peaked my curiosity. Have to hear this new stuff.
deathgrips,3cgsa3,OG_Pow,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:50:11 2015 UTC,I don't know it didn't really sound too much like actual songs. Just very fast and chaotic drumming with vocal samples of ride all over the place and it was just kind of a mess. I thought they just made those to play before the show started to set the atmosphere.
deathgrips,3cgsa3,happyparallel,-5,Wed Jul 8 08:52:59 2015 UTC,"It's not ""new material"" as in ""unreleased material,"" it's something they threw together to have something else to play during the wait.  It sounded like they recorded Zach drumming, used heavy effects/filters, and chopped up a bunch of samples of Ride's vocals.  I doubt the vocals were newly recorded.  While a lot of it was unrecognizable, I definitely heard bits from Up My Sleeves and Spread Eagle Cross the Block.  We're not freaking out about it because there really isn't anything to freak out about.  I was at the second show (in Vancouver), so I hadn't heard anything about it on this site yet.  The reaction of myself and everyone around me was more of a ""holy shit, this is ridiculous.""  It was very much understood that this was a part of the show.  This sub can be kind of cancerous sometimes, and this is a perfect example.  I'm not sure that I can even convince you of how insignificant that mix was, because I can't say ""well, you weren't there"" because you WERE.  If you hadn't read people's comments/speculations on here about it beforehand though, I don't think it would have been as big a deal to you either."
deathgrips,3cgsa3,happyparallel,4,Tue Jul 7 23:11:11 2015 UTC,"""I doubt the vocals were newly recorded""  You seem so sure, yet still express doubt. Rather than be an asshole to the inquisitive fans of this sub, why not just ignore the post?"
deathgrips,3cgsa3,happyparallel,6,Tue Jul 7 23:22:27 2015 UTC,"I wasn't trying to come across as an asshole, so I apologize for that.  I've just seen a lot of discussion about this so-called ""new material"" lately, and I genuinely think it's being viewed out of context.  I expressed doubt because I can't say for sure, but I can make an educated guess based on a few samples that I was able to recognize."
deathgrips,3cgsa3,DravenXX6,2,Wed Jul 8 00:32:50 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I can respect that. I'd still like to hear a quality version of it regardless, especially if it was created by the band (which I'm assuming we're all on the same page about)."
deathgrips,3cgsa3,dragon-farts,-1,Wed Jul 8 01:11:42 2015 UTC,"Disagreeing does not make him an asshole. I had the same thoughts about this material at the Boston show. Yeah, there's the ""you find me intriguing"" lyric or something similar, but as far as I remember most of the vocals were old or plainly unintelligible snippets of speech. I think happyparallel's comment is pretty spot on."
deathgrips,3cgsa3,bbpoltetgiest,4,Tue Jul 7 23:36:09 2015 UTC,"No, but calling the sub ""cancerous"" does. That's great, I didn't think it was. If it's still an original mix, I'm sure the fans would be interested regardless."
deathgrips,3cgsa3,eyeofnoble,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:47:19 2015 UTC,If there were ANY new lyrics at all (which you even admitted there were) that means there is new / unreleased material. Ride stepped into the vocal booth and recorded something new. The production was also new.  I guarantee you are wrong.
deathgrips,3cgsa3,bbpoltetgiest,3,Wed Jul 8 00:36:27 2015 UTC,"Someone mentioned hearing samples from Ride's work before Death Grips in the mix.  It definitely doesn't mean that Ride stepped into the vocal booth and recorded something new for this track.  They could have easily taken vocals from old material or demos.  And actually, what I meant when I said a lot of it was unrecognizable was that a lot of it couldn't be picked out against the backdrop of noise.  Like I couldn't recognize any actual words for most of it."
deathgrips,3cgsa3,Grandmagifsuck,3,Wed Jul 8 00:43:40 2015 UTC,"Why the hell would death grips record track upon track of new beats just to play before they go on stage when they have the entire Fashion Week and ILYs projects to do just that?  I was standing next to the PA and noticed completely new lyrics, 1000%. They were not remixes. One of the songs had a thunky Death From Above 1989 vibe that kinda reminded me of the more punk moments on Fashion Week or I've Seen Footage. Absolutely positive it was new material. Some of the vocal inflections were very strange and one of them included the high-pitched scream Ride has been doing live on this tour that we haven't really heard from him before."
deathgrips,3cgsa3,wxstx,3,Wed Jul 8 00:35:19 2015 UTC,"They played all of Fashion Week and all of I've Always Been Good at True Love, too.  I'm still convinced that this is a weird mix of old practice material/demos/whatever, and that it shouldn't be looked at too deeply.  If you WANT to look at it deeply, the most you could say is that this might be a good indicator of where their heads are at right now."
deathgrips,3cgsa3,mrooww,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:50:32 2015 UTC,"That last sentence is exactly how they described Government Plates and I certainly consider that album worth caring about. It's new Death Grips songs man, of course we care."
deathgrips,3cgsa3,ThoughtlessKoopa,3,Wed Jul 8 02:59:24 2015 UTC,"Well that's not exactly what I meant.  Government plates wasn't thrown together to fill time before a show.  I meant the deepest you could look into this is maybe making educated guesses as to what upcoming actual releases might sound like.  If there even will be any, that is."
deathgrips,3cgsa3,mrooww,5,Wed Jul 8 04:22:40 2015 UTC,"I've been making music for more than 8 years. The material I heard before the show was not ""thrown together.""  I'm a little blown away how musically clueless some of the people in this thread are. You can't make music like what was heard before the show by just sloppily layering old tracks together or stacking existing songs. It sounds like absolute shit. This was orchestrated, carefully produced - with moments where the sounds cut out precisely to emphasize a sample or sound and slam back in in different time signatures. It was nuanced.  We heard new DG music. What do you mean you can't ""look into this deeply""? I'm not saying it's a fucking conspiracy theory, I heard new Death Grips music before the show, plain and simple. It's absolutely bizarre how desperately you are trying to dismiss that concept. Do you really think it's more likely that the band, THIS band, sloppily tossed together some drum recordings that just so happened to sound absolutely perfect together in tempo, rhythmic structure, pitch and dynamics just to ""have something to play before they came out""?  Are we listening to the same fucking band??"

I just know that for me on of the best experiences of seeing death grips live was being able to listen to my gut instinct or whatever you want to call it and not worry about anything else. Maybe that's just my experience though... I know when I saw them in Portland they had plenty of merch and I didn't even pic up a shirt until half way through the show
