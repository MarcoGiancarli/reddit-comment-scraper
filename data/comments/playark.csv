It would have to be only able to attack on the ground and even then it would be stupidly overpowered even if its flight speed was slower than a Rex/Spino's ground running speed simply because it can lift off."
playark,3e2cgp,TheProfessional9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:42:12 2015 UTC,"I think a good solution would be to let it have 2 attacks. A flame/ fire attack in which they introduce a burning DOT mechanic. And a standard melee attack with its base damage being 50. Keep in mind, this thing will have a big vulnerability to guns and projectiles. x4 for being a flyer. Its size should be smaller than A Rex... like Toothless. :D  I think we'd have more variety that way and it wouldn't necessarily turn this game into how to tame your dragon."
playark,3e2cgp,SupaCake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:54:03 2015 UTC,"I really love the concept, but if we assume it would be hard to get.... Imagine people with dragons trying to protect them.  As it stands you can one shot a pterana and it doesn't take many hits from a rifle to kill a bird.  You would have to have a massive base surrounding your dragon or people would just snipe it from the sky or nearby ledges.  Spend countless hours killing the boss dragon and losing many dinos in the process only to have someone carry a buddy overhead with an assault rifle and shoot it"
playark,3e2cgp,TheProfessional9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:56:18 2015 UTC,"Yup. If you're a big tribe looking to get an endgame mount as valuable as this, you better be ready to defend it. Just because it is a threatening presence, it'll be a high priority target for the rest of the server. Completely enclosed so that it can't be cheesed by 1 person airdropped from above. Though I think keeping the flyer multiplier is crucial to keeping them balanced. They'd work great alongside Rexes and other siege dinos. Give Flak another role and make it fire resistant. Give an incentive to break their armor with physical damage before you're able to char them. >:D"
playark,3e2cgp,SupaCake,0,Tue Jul 21 19:27:49 2015 UTC,"This might be one of the cases where balance in the PvP section of the game really impacts PvE players. It would be OP in PvP, but there'd be nothing wrong with it in PvE. Sadly, the game seems to prioritise PvP at every turn."
playark,3e2cgp,MB617,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:11:38 2015 UTC,"Still OP for pve as well, though less so.  It reduces the time spent on any task requiring damage and travel.  It could easily reduce the need for large ground based damage dealers as well as air damage dealers.    Any time a dino has Apex status in more than one category it risks eliminating the value of many other dinos.  For example, the rex has the highest base HP/DMG/Weight for land dinos aside from bronts.  There is no real reason to get a spino at present unless you want a large sprinter or you've built a base in the middle of the one large lake on the map.  Rex needs a nurf, but the dragon would replace the Rex AND replace air dinos as well as potentially replacing fast ground mounts and remove what little danger there is of ground combat since it can simply lift off if things get rough.  Apologize for the long winded explanation, but hopefully it illustrates my point!"
playark,3e2cgp,TheProfessional9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:24:17 2015 UTC,"True, it reduces the time spent, but that's not a bad thing. If you're at the point where you can tame a goddamn dragon, it's a safe bet that you wouldn't mind spending less time travelling and dealing damage. And if you still want to take your sweet time on a Rex, you're free to do so. I've one of every carnivore at the moment and I still use them on occasion, even though I have 'superior dinos'.   Also, the dragon's size might be a downside causing you to use other means of transport and combat. Same reason I use a Carno instead of a Rex for gathering."
playark,3e2cgp,MB617,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:29:28 2015 UTC,"There has to be time sinks.  Otherwise we would /give everything.  The time reduction of tasks is where the value of dinos comes in and thus is a significant factor in their use.  Carnos are faster and can cover more ground, but otherwise there is no reason to use it when a rex is available.  Sure some people will use the lower ones because they like them more, but that isn't how the devs want the game to play out or they wouldn't put SO much effort into developing niches for almost every dino type.  I would love to have a dragon, and if it was released I'd hands down be the first on the server to get one...but for them to balance it would be extremely difficult.  Given that they want to release dozens of other dinos, them spending an excessive amount of time on a rare one like this seems unlikely. I'm not trying to ruin your hopes and dreams, simply explaining why it would surprise me if it happened, and really surprise me if it happened in the next year or so"
playark,3e2cgp,TheProfessional9,0,Tue Jul 21 18:44:26 2015 UTC,"I think a good way to even it out would be one of these....  -High health, but low torpor.  -High speed, but low stamina.  -High damage, but low health.  -High damage, but very slow.  or something along those lines."
playark,3e2cgp,Valus_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:25:16 2015 UTC,"There are ways to balance this, but it would be difficult and time consuming when they have so many other priority dinos and general game development projects.  All of the above methods would be difficult to work in.  High health can result in an unkillable juggernaut.  Low stamina means it can't really fly very far, and doesn't stop it from being OP without a rider.  Low HP and it simply dies during the first half hearted raid resulting in rage from whoever spent the time necessary to get it.  Slow still leaves it as an untouchable killing machine unless you make its turn speed slow, in which case people just kill it with a raptor and much rage is had.  The only thing they could do to truly keep it balanced, is to keep its damage on the low end which kind of ruins the idea of having superawesomesaucedragon because it becomes superawesomesauceWetNoodle.   Or not allow flight, which would make the balancing fairly easy  Cool concept, would be a blast to ride and play on-but the time required to work it in to the current system dictates it is unlikely to be added within the next year or so in my opinion."

One of the major problems is by making an OP dragon tamable, you are making the strongest tribes even stronger.  I love the idea though for sure.  It should only eat prime meat, no regular meat at all.  It should take a week to hatch or something.  That way if people find out about said dragon egg in a base with the potential to hatch, perhaps people on the server would join forces to stop this OP dragon from being born.  It would give some RP to every server as well.Everyone would whisper rumors about who has an egg, who to raid next to check for the egg.  Make a cage/nest that is craft-able, to hatch and keep the dragon in.  Make it extremely expensive like 4000 ingots 500 cement paste etc.  Perhaps put a timer on its life, so it cant just cripple servers.  Make it like lazurus where once it hatches you have like 140 hours to control the dragon until it dies.  There would also have to be a way for people on the server to know the dragon egg is in someones possession.  Like an obelisk would change from red to being on fire or something along those lines.  I like the idea tons, but there would have to be so much done to balance it as well though."

playark,3e2cgp,MortalAngel,-3,Tue Jul 21 16:59:37 2015 UTC,"If you are at the point where you are summoning the dragon you are probably at the point where you have tons of mats anyways, these would most likely go hand in hand.  W/o a shelf life whats to stop that dragon from wrecking the entire server if no force is large enough to stop it, imagine it now-the reddit post:Need help Official Server *(# has been over run with a tribe killing everything and everyone with their dragon, the server is dead now cause no one can kill it."
playark,3e2cgp,SmokeShowRD,0,Tue Jul 21 14:44:57 2015 UTC,"I like this idea a lot, actually. The top Tribe should be rewarded with a top mount for their efforts. Great idea OP."
playark,3e2cgp,StormrayVoice,6,Tue Jul 21 16:43:08 2015 UTC,They're already rewarded by being the top tribe and able to screw over everyone else.
playark,3e2cgp,Conradian,0,Tue Jul 21 16:53:37 2015 UTC,"I have to agree. This sounds like a great idea. I've also noticed that not to many player even seem to care about the bosses. So making it that you receive a special mount seems like a great idea, but I can not agree that it should be stronger then the Rex or the Spino. I believe that placing it on the same level would be great. However it must breath fire to make it worth the effort to kill the boss and hatch the egg...."
playark,3e2cgp,MortalAngel,0,Tue Jul 21 16:57:41 2015 UTC,"I like the idea, but it sounds a bit OP. I'd have to suggest only bringing it's melee up to on par or a bit better than a carno and maybe be about as big, too. It's sky attacks would obviously be a bit less than on par with the argent and it'd be about as fast as a ptera, maybe faster."

playark,3e3877,StormrayVoice,5,Tue Jul 21 16:48:05 2015 UTC,They definitely need to be spiced up a bit.
playark,3e3877,Valus_,3,Tue Jul 21 18:14:35 2015 UTC,"I have done extensive theorycrafting (playing ark at 7 in the morning high af) about Trikes, and their niche. With it already having a pretty good knockback AOE attack, I feel like it would be cool to have the RMB be a defensive ""stance"" where they lower their head, and it makes you take less damage from the front, and hurt dinos attacking the front (like a spiked wall). Having them be immune to knockback and unable to move (or maybe just unable to sprint) seems like some good bonuses/penalties for it, and it could drain stamina (rather slowly). Trikes are my favorite herbivore dino rn :)  EDIT: their they're there"
playark,3e3877,Tyrosoldier,2,Tue Jul 21 18:22:15 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one that actually prefers Trikes to Stegos? Ever since they nerfed berry garthering, I felt like sacrificing mobility and speed for higher range on your attacks is not really worth it."
playark,3e3877,Cydon_Prax,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:28:31 2015 UTC,It's already working in their internal build. They want all dinos to have an alternate attack with different use (think the carno and birds).
playark,3e20tw,the_Yippster,10,Tue Jul 21 10:12:27 2015 UTC,"This sounds interesting and potentially fun.  More options, in my opinion, are always good.  Instead of having the 4 tiers of armor that are straight upgrades of each other have side grades."
playark,3e20tw,insanetwo,5,Tue Jul 21 11:35:18 2015 UTC,"4 tiers of each grade. Winter armor, current line of armor and a lighter chain mail for hot weather.   Also jumping into the ocean with plate armor head to toe should send you directly to the bottom."
playark,3e20tw,Mabepossibly,9,Tue Jul 21 12:11:01 2015 UTC,I'm not sure how well mail would be for hot weather. I'd think the metal would heat up fairly quickly in direct sunlight.
playark,3e20tw,Aeleas,2,Tue Jul 21 12:39:00 2015 UTC,I'm thinking that chain is open allowing air to move.  Much more so than plate armor.
playark,3e20tw,Mabepossibly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:53:33 2015 UTC,"problem is with chain you'd still need to wear some cloth under it, or the chain will get caught on skin and hair, which is painful!   So the gaps wouldn't really help cool you...  Probably better off with baggy cloth over the metal armour to keep the direct heat off it, and airflow between the layers would cool it somewhat. still screwed though. metal and heat don't play nice together..."
playark,3e20tw,FailFailWin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:40:59 2015 UTC,Or even movement advantages for lighter armors.
playark,3e20tw,insanetwo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:51:41 2015 UTC,I forget what game it was that had a really good trade off system for armor weight vs stamina and mobility. Maybe it was Skyrim.  But it made for a lot of strategic planning for character development. Building a heavy armor big sword tank vs a minimal armor mobile archer.
playark,3e20tw,Mabepossibly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:49:54 2015 UTC,I could see using the plate armor to get to the bottom useful. Might be faster to sink down them to have your mount swim down. Just set it to follow and go XD
playark,3e20tw,Uber_Pwnage,5,Tue Jul 21 14:13:51 2015 UTC,"OP, have you been playing Frostfall? That was what came to mind for me, first and foremost.  For the uninitiated, Frostfall is a mod for Skyrim that adds a level of [potentially] exposure to the elements -- and did a damn fine job doing it. Fur cloaks would keep you warm in the colder climes, but would soak the rain in the southlands and would act as a debuff (you're cold and wet you dingus) if worn down there; while, conversely, a leather cloak would shield you from the wet stuff, but didn't provide much protection against the cold.  I think it's a cool idea, and you've got my upvote!"
playark,3e20tw,themumm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:52:55 2015 UTC,No I haven't - but I'll check it out. And thanks ;-)
playark,3e20tw,DungeonDargov,3,Tue Jul 21 15:26:50 2015 UTC,"This is a really good idea, would be nice to see them implement.  From a game design perspective: I think Fur would be an additional drop which only drops in small numbers, much in the manner of Prime meats. Relatively few would be needed to create the armour, and to prevent it from interfering too heavily with current balance of engrams points, the engrams for Fur Hide could be limited to just the main body pieces; Torso and Legs.  From the scientific perspective: Metal is a really terrible thing to wear in terms of insulation, it's low specific heat capacity means it quickly takes on the ambient temperature quickly. However it does have one potentially useful property: the ability to reflect light efficiently.  So in theory a compound armour which combines highly polished metal and hide and/or chitin might offer slightly better protection against heat. But the degree of effectiveness would be largely determined by relative terms; if current metal armour was judged to be particularly bad hyperthermic insulation, I don't doubt you could create substantially better insulated metal armour."
playark,3e20tw,Mushrumz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:47:54 2015 UTC,On engram points: maybe they could implement them as forks of the existing tech tree (e.g. hide enables researching chitin AND fur) so that you don't have to learn all the recipes / can specialise? That would make trading more desirable too.  I'd personally like to see a full set for aesthetic reasons ;-)
playark,3e20tw,DungeonDargov,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:30:09 2015 UTC,"A simple response to the engram problem would be to make the insulation an armor modifier, kind of like the way scopes and such work, learn the engram for insulation and just slot it into whichever armor. Not as interesting lore wise, but a lot more practical."
playark,3e20tw,Brickreative,0,Tue Jul 21 18:04:53 2015 UTC,"On the topic- I haven't had that much of a play around with it yet, is it just me or are humans currently being treated as cold-blooded by the game?  (ie. Your temperature immediately drops to that of the surrounding environment)"

playark,3e20tw,jmknsd,2,Tue Jul 21 15:04:40 2015 UTC,"Once those are in, the environmental effects should be much more deadly.  Also, you could have the base stats controlled by the game, but allow modders to change the look/model of the outfits so that there was variety."
playark,3e20tw,Armigedon,2,Tue Jul 21 15:10:41 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree - rather than the random pockets of warm and cool we have currently I'd like to see a more consistently warm climate on the Island that is contrasted with really deadly cold and dry-hot areas.  That would allow places such as caves and mountain tops to have more of a high risk-high reward dynamic.   And perhaps it could even be useful to make caves less of a desirable base location without swinging the nerf bat at structures?
playark,3e20tw,kestnuts,2,Tue Jul 21 15:26:10 2015 UTC,"So far I can only think of a type of elaborate cloth armour (think Bedouin clothing), but maybe somebody has a better idea?   A (giant) sombrero!  And later in the tech tree, I don't see why we can't introduce synthetic fabric for better cooling/heating.  But overall I wouldn't mind seeing temperatures made more consistent. I can be standing in one place and freezing and move 5 feet away and be fine. I would really like some of these spikes of heat and cold and some sort of season system worked in so there is still need for both cold and hot equipment."

There are areas of the map where farming 1000 stone takes one person maybe a half hour (which isn't a lot considering people are babysitting dinosaurs for +5 hours). Build a thatch foundation with a mortar on it, and process all of your cement paste at location and bring it back to your base."
playark,3e2f0y,giantroboticcat,2,Tue Jul 21 14:34:19 2015 UTC,My issue with it is there are plenty of stones on the ground but apparently they're decorations.

My complaint is why polymer AND paste.... as if I don't have to gather enough paste for the polymer you want me to just throw some extra in on top?  I'd rather the tracking device be 10 more polymer than 30 more paste. Paste is life man. I've got plenty of obsidian, with little uses for it, but everything takes paste."

Currently the game exists in a strange ""you must have a sabertooth"" mode because of the high keratin/chitin cost of many items.  It also leads to a stuck point where you have tons of materials for everything BUT the things that require cementing paste, and a hunt for those materials during a busy hour can result in very little to return with.  Yes, even with the ants.  Yes, the caves are consistently farmed.  Yes, an argentavis saddle requires way too much chitin, too.  No, I don't accept that this is how the game is supposed to be because chitin/cementing paste show up in way too many recipes in way too high of quantities by comparison to all other materials.

There is a simple algorithm which puts a collision mesh ontop an object automatically. Animation wise I see no big impact if you scale thing up to scale. Not quite sure about the textures though.   I'd personally like to see some change in the visuals of a dino too as it grows up. It needn't to be size alone but maybe if you lvl up a Sabers attack you could get bigger claws and teeth so you could tell from a distance how dangerous it is. If it has more stamia it might be more ripped and more health would mean a thicker fur. I hope you get the idea. A little bit of the game ""Black and White"" :)"
playark,3e1p5r,m1k3tv,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:21:55 2015 UTC,I think you're confusing 'reasonable programming hurdle' with 'nightmare'.  Nothing about a dino size would need to change with the animation.  Collision box could easily scale with dino size as well.
playark,3e1p5r,LordXemnis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:17:33 2015 UTC,"Its not too hard to scale the collisions and center them with the dino object.  Might take a few minutes top for each one, some engines even do that automatically.  Besides the collisions need work anyway."

Also if you were able to influence the stat bonus's via ""kibble"" or w/e they come up with to nudge the game into bumping stats in the areas you want increase - this would also be amazing.

playark,3e1p5r,Sherbniz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:51:11 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think it would be okay if they just added 2 size stages for each dinosaur to make the whole process more controlled (the last, 3rd being the fully grown dinosaurs we know).    Baby - Roughly size of the eggs,  short snouts, scaled up eyes to make em look cute. Insects in this state are slightly translucent. Puny but easy to tame, perhaps could even be carried in your hands for smaller ones... If babynapped, it's parents will try to find and end you. Juvenile - Just a scaled down version. Clumsy and may make problems trying to butt heads with others of it's kind. Could perhaps he already ridden, but maybe requires to be broken in? Adult - The Dinosaurs and Creatures that we see everywhere right now. The dinosaur can finally be ridden.   And to make things interesting, Baby or Juveniles can be super easily tamed, but are absolutely puny and can't accept a saddle until fully grown. So even small clans could attempt to get a powerful dino by stealing an egg or newborn from their parents.  Level wouldn't automatically correspond to their growth stage, so you could still have a level 1 adult.  But we certainly can't have Level 100 Babies, so each growth stage corresponds to a level-threshold that must be crossed before the dinosaur will grow.  I'm thinking 1-10 for Babies, 11-15 for Juveniles, 15-Max for Adults."

If you mine the same area / mountain it might be worth your while to build some kind of wooden pen at the base to keep a decent level Ankylo in and up near where you mine build some kind of platform with storage and refining forges so you can take the ankylo up the mountain, fill him up with metal, dump metal into forges, craft structures and place them in storage. You can then take the ankylo back down and put him up, go home and get your argent (or if you brought him over) and go up the mountain and pickup your structures out of storage and transport them back to where you want to build. Quite a bit more work on the front but a great setup for a lot of metal and more efficient transport to your build site.

It seems a bit absurd that paste is so stone reliant and that it is used in almost every high level item.  Not only that, but most items require paste AND polymer, which just double-dips.  Maybe sci-fi will use more crystals, but at the moment I feel I would damn near trade crystals for stone 1:1.  Collecting stone faster with a method like the one posted or the new stone-collecting dinos will be nice, but I still find it odd that most endgame items are driven by the same thing as level 1 items."
playark,3e2hdr,RepostResearch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:12:31 2015 UTC,"Very true. If anything, they should change the bottleneck resource to be higher tier materials, like pearls, oils, crystals, obsidians, etc. I wouldn't mind if the craft costs hundreds more of pearls and crystals while reducing the stone requirement to 1/10th of what they are. It's actually fun/challenging and requires a lot of planning and preparing some of the end game mats, but the most time consuming part of any end game craft is still stone."

playark,3e0cd5,cmaturk,5,Mon Jul 20 23:59:45 2015 UTC,"In the past when Dev's have talked about this, they mention how they want taming to be  a ""You chose to tame here, challenge accepted"" sort of deal.

playark,3e0cd5,Nubsly-,5,Tue Jul 21 02:45:49 2015 UTC,"I understand that idea, but I don't think the reality really bears it out.  You see people raid bases, but not so many find people taming dinos in the wild and attack them.  Organized tribes already lure dinos back to safe areas to tame them.  I think the taming system overhaul should include something like this.  You knock it out and then keep it drugged while you get it to a controlled environment and then you start the real taming process.  What that process is should be interactive and time consuming and there are a lot of suggestions already posted about it.  You could add spawns that attack you on your way back or else just give the unconscious dino a ridiculously large aggro draw to increase the difficulty.  That way you have to defend it as you move it.  There are a lot of ways you could go, but I like this better than taming in the wild.  Realistically, moving an animal to a controlled environment would always be the first step."
playark,3e0cd5,allekatrase,2,Tue Jul 21 03:21:16 2015 UTC,"If they added this mechanic, then perhaps they should also add that the aggro range is increased so it becomes a game of chase and evasion as you lure out every dangerous predator around more easily while towing a dinosaur back to safety. This I would be okay with. DO you leave the dinosaur where you found him/her and chance it being attacked there, or do you draw more attention to yourself over a distance while you tow it back to safety? Hmm, I do like this."

playark,3e0cd5,Mortdredd,2,Tue Jul 21 07:41:33 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of the dinosaur needing to be larger than (or at least strong enough) to drag the dino. This leaves room for the situation to arise so that if the tame is a step up to your current resources, it remains troublesome. But if you have been on, and already have a strong dinosaur, the new one won't tip the scale and become any sort of primary. Excellent idea."

Ultimately you kind of have to make a choice when you see a dino you want to tame. Do I want it bad enough to tame it here or should I just wait and try to tame one later on in a location I am more comfortable with. I personally like the thrill of being in a strange place, trying to tame something with the chance that some crazy dangerous predator might show up and I have to defend it. Granted this option will not change my style of gameplay as I could still choose to do it, but I feel like the option will take away some of the danger element that we are supposed to feel here. I see quite a few suggestions that seem to be trying to curb down the survival aspects of the game, yet the game's second word in the title is survival. I vote - nay."

playark,3e0cd5,SmokeShowRD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:26:24 2015 UTC,"There is a way to bring a Dino to a better spot to tame it. On the server i am on i built a Taming room, it holds everything up to a Trex, (spino and Bronto require a larger door). So what you do is build a Stone 5x12x3 rectangle on one of the 5 block sides you build a rock dino gate, on the other you put down 3 stone foundations and a door on the exterior wall. For this project you need roughly 30 stone fence founds, you can do 2 walls high and stand outside and tranq arrow the trex or whatever you lure in. Trex is only able to step over walls that are 1 High, so 2 high works to save on mats. Im OCD about it so mine is 4 high and has a safe room. So you aggro the Dino and train it back to the spot close the doors and haul ass out. and you are free to tranq in from a safe distance."
playark,3e0cd5,Slevin188,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:39:53 2015 UTC,In either the wiki or the Steam page they talk about your dinos being able to drag a corpse or unconscious animals/humans around. I think it would scale off the dino's max weight and the weight of what your dragging. Would solve your problem.
playark,3e0cd5,Aristotelis1,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:37:16 2015 UTC,These issues will be mitigated with the trackers. Will make it easier to prepare an area for a tame.
playark,3e0cd5,Johnnyonoes,-1,Tue Jul 21 01:30:51 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the dev's have said they don't want to do some thing along these lines. They want to bring ourselves out of our comfort zones.

There's a different type of Kibble for each type of egg in the game, and each of those are the favorite for a different type of dino. (So making a kibble using a Dilo egg will be the favorite of a different dino than a kibble made from a Trike egg, for example)"

I think they should be draggable too."
playark,3e1pup,tom_gore,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:15:25 2015 UTC,I also want to be able to carry around tamed dodos and dilos and I want my Dimorphodon to land on my shoulder when being set to follow.

Maybe make a rope out of all the fibre and use that to drag, or attach it to a trike and pull your ko'd dino.   Also, I would like to be able to pick up dodo's, they are only good as a house pet, yet it's a nightmare moving them. I'd like to be able to pick up a tamed dodo and place it in my house."
playark,3e1pup,McCabe89,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:28:29 2015 UTC,Or you could always just build thatch walls around it.
playark,3e1pup,fallakin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:57:29 2015 UTC,Easy mode. Taming something in its environment is what makes the taming more difficult. I really do worry that the devs will listen to too many suggestions like this and the game will lose it's difficulty.
playark,3e1pup,Lyesalot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:02:48 2015 UTC,"Being able to drag anything small enough to drag would make that whole process a lot easier when it already is easy to tame small things.  Even if a Rex or anything aggressive is nearby, you should always be ready to bring it down or getting it to attack other animals.    Dragging your tame to a safe area seems reasonable and great but it would make taming small things too easy.  I'm against this idea."

But the thing that is wrong here is that the developers don't have any alternatives to metal. That's why we have metal.   This post aims to bring it to the developers' attention, that they ought to at least give us more alternatives, rather than just removing content that wasn't really hurting anybody.

Believe it or not, I'm inclined to side with the defenders in this case; because the amount of effort, resources, etc; to build a base fortified by Metal Spikes is incredible.  Fortifications should not be made to be so easily defeated. Otherwise, what's the point?  In the primitive game - that's the point. You have primitive technology that can't do a lot of damage. Spikes are effective against dino siege, hence why they are used. If you are unable to defeat the spikes - might I suggest flying into the base? Wood and stone doors are easily defeated by spears/time.  Game Balance needs to lean in favor of the defenders - not the aggressors because your stuff/person are vulnerable when you are offline. Raids should be difficult - not easy - to execute. The only easy raid is when you raid a poorly fortified encampment. It's easy by a player's failure to plan."

I was trying to think of a way to import images or at least designs into ark for easy sign paintings. I'm having a hard time painting something decent and wanted some art of a dragon or something so I think I came up with a way. Take a line drawing/clip art (something very simple), convert it into ascii block art, paste it in notepad, set your keyboard up to act as your mouse, use the replace all funtion in notepad to replace all the empty spaces with move mouse right keybinding, replace all blocks with left mouse click. After each line add the equal amount of move mouse left as there is keystrokes. Also add a move mouse down keybinding. So it returns to the next line like a typewriter. Now once you've done all this paste the text into a macro that you setup. Go into the game and go to the sign to start painting. Move into position where you want the painting. Once you're there push your key that you setup to run your macro and watch the magic."

I'm afraid I don't quite understand this statement.  It almost sounds like the ""filter"" would affect the actual materials being harvested, and not the materials you gather in your inventory.    As an example, say a tree has 50 ""resource units""; if you were to cut it down with a Mammoth, say you'd get, on average, 35 Wood and 15 Thatch.  Players right now out to gather strictly Wood would dump the thatch and keep on going.  What the statement seems to imply is that if you hit that same tree with a Mammoth with a Wood Filter turned on, you'd get 50 Wood, instead of just 35 with the 15 Thatch dumped on the ground automatically or vanishing into thin air.  I can see how that might upset resource balance, but I personally didn't want a system like that; I'd never say no to more free stuff, but I'd be totally okay with the same average cumulative amounts of respective resources, I just don't want to have to manually drop thousands and thousands of items I don't want/need or need."
playark,3e0b0z,Arctorn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:43:52 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure what they're saying, is you'd get the wood, but the thatch and others would be immediately dumped onto the ground.  I could be mistaken though."
playark,3e0b0z,Nhiyla,3,Tue Jul 21 01:28:16 2015 UTC,"These devs are pretty intelligent, so I honestly don't think that's it.  Think about it for a second; an automated system that dumps items you don't want doesn't touch ""resource balance"" at all.  It doesn't change how much you get per hit or how much you get per node, the only thing it would do is save players a few seconds of manually dumping extraneous resources every couple of minutes of time spent gathering resources.  This is an effect that already occurs in-game right now, albeit manually, and an automated dump system would again only save a few seconds of inconvenience.  If, however, the filters affect what you can gather from a resource node, then you would have a case where resource balance would be affected, as you would suddenly have more of X per node, and none of Y.  See:   Allowing you to walk up with a Mammoth and get wood-and-only-wood without making you forfeit the Thatch you'd normally get removes the resource balances we're attempting to put into the game."

playark,3e377i,Aischylos,0,Tue Jul 21 16:41:06 2015 UTC,"This seems to be part of their design. Basically - you shouldn't be taming such a high level dinosaur. End of story.  It's a testament to their commitment to player freedom that they don't just buff the torpor max/torpor recovery of these beasts to a point where you could never knock them out.  So, it's like: Yeah, this tame is impossible. If you'd like to dedicate 11 hours of your life to it though, you can get it anyways.  Also, your suggestion is sort of nonsensical. Narcotics are way too easy to get - there's no need to stockpile them. One small crop plot, only one, growing narcoberries can easily net you ~500 narcotics a day. Much more using like four or five small crop plots.  If taming times scaled down per level, instead of up as they do now, essentially it would just be worthless to tame anything but the highest level dino. A lvl 42 Trex hits like a raptor compared to a level 70 Trex, both melee pumped.  Imagine people rolling around with Trex tamed at lvl 90 (or 120 coming up soon,) then also using Kibbles to get the max level buff, which should put it at around lvl 104 (or 134,) approximately. Then you get around another 40 levels on top of that.  The entire time buffing HP and Melee only.  I'll leave the rest to your imagination."
playark,3e377i,crimsonBZD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:31:14 2015 UTC,"Sorry if I was unclear, I didn't mean that the taming times would scale down per level, but that the current scaling would be reduced. The taming times would still increase, but not quite as fast.  By raising torpor it would make knocking the dinos out a feat, something that people would be impressed by, rather than the current system where all it means is that your tribe spans multiple timezones."
playark,3e377i,crimsonBZD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:01:01 2015 UTC,"Yes - I did misunderstand on that part a little. However, understanding now, I still stand behind what I said in my previous reply. I feel that per the dev's design, bascially, such high levels are supposed to be virtually unobtainable.   Basically, I'm against anything that helps people get higher level tames easier. The sheer power of dinos is currently underestimated I believe - for a long time, having a ""dino attack pack"" didn't work because of latency and pathing issues.  I tested this (because this is my favorite part of the game, having a dino pack) and I found that it works again.  Basically, I tamed 5 lvl 1-9 dimorphodons (flying rats,) and they could easily take out a Trex.  Now, whether they should or should not be able to, I'm not commenting on. It's just that, how the game works now, having more dinos is more efficient, and stronger, than having a higher level dino.   So, allowing people to more easily obtain high level dinos will just make dino packs more powerful. Once more of these pathing glitches are worked out, I think we'll start seeing these ""dino packs"" become the meta. At that time - trust me - you don't want ANYONE having a large pack of high level dinos."
playark,3e377i,Daesthelos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:15:19 2015 UTC,"I think we can all agree that as it is now, taming high level dinos aren't so much ""impossible"", so much as boring. While the current time sink makes it ""difficult"" in that you need to have a crap ton of free time, it isn't engaging or actually difficult in term of skill or preparation. I think that OP is (in some way) trying to address the boredom/inaccesibilty of high level tames by decreasing the tame time, but increasing the materials required.  I have personally fallen asleep irl multiple times while taming. Rather recently, i fell asleep while taming a mammoth, got booted, and logged back in a few hours to find it tamed (it was already close to being tamed). Point being: the taming process as it is now simply isn't engaging.  In terms of people having a bunch of high level tames, no lifers/otherwise prepared people already have them. Rather than making the game  ""easier"", I imagine it would probably balance the game, with some tweaks as it were."
playark,3e377i,crimsonBZD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:34:51 2015 UTC,"I think this comes down to how you're doing it and what you're taming.  With the inclusion of Kibbles, and the fact that they tame at 5.4x the speed of Raw Meat (Raw Prime Meat yields 4x speed,) that ""stockpiling items"" to reduce tame times is entirely possible. I'm playing on a 1x difficulty server, and I was able to tame a lvl 29 Trex in about 30 minutes feeding it entirely Kibbles.  Also, it depends on what you're taming and what you're doing in the meantime. Me: If I'm taming a carnivore, here's my order of operations.  1) Max out torpidity on the tame. 2) Ensure it has enough meat that it won't run out. 3) Go out on another tamed creature and hunt for Raw Prime Meat. 4) Gather 3-5 Raw Prime, return to tame and put the meat on it. Return to step 1.  Also, how many creatures are you taming at a time? Taming 3-5 at a time, especially using the method above, is very quick and efficient and requires no preparation of any Kibbles either.  Granted, going to gather Raw Prime does not help with an herbivore. It seems that with Herbivores your only options are ""Berries"" and their preferred Kibble. I also notice that there aren't really any ""fighter"" type herbivores - they are specialized for gathering, which makes sense. So, the tame times are arbitrary on those to ensure that you can't get a mammoth in 1 hour and then farm up 10K Wood in the next few hours.  Basically, an herbivore is a gathering creature, so you can't really seem to speed them up too easily, Kibble being the only way."
playark,3e377i,crimsonBZD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:31:43 2015 UTC,"The problem is that getting a swarm of high level dinos is not harder than taming just one the way it works currently.  Yesterday my tribe had a level 72,78, and 90 Saber all knocked out next to eachother taming. Since we were already checking one it was easy to also check the others.  Getting 3x high level sabers was not 3x as much work as just getting one. If the limiting factor were food or narcotics instead of how often they were checked on then it would be be more difficult the more you were taming simultaneously. Right now my tribe never games just one difficult thing at once, we always have 3 or more going.  Because narcotics are so easy to gather in comparison to hire many you need, these mass tames are very easy and just require people being on for a while."

Secondly, it has nothing to do with more automation. I use my dinos to protect my base when I am offline, why the hell can I not use them to protect another valuable asset.  Your solution is just to out the dinos around it and put them on neutral as to get the same effect in a more tedious way. What the hell would be wrong with the QoL change to have more diverse and useful dino AI.  Your second solution is to build a ring around him... which takes all of 5-10 minutes depending on the dino size. There is no difficulty or skill in that.   The change suggested is not making taming easier as it is already just a time-sink. The suggested change is a simple QoL issue that goes along with the style of the rest of the game.  Tame dinos can be used to protect tribe assets, no reason they should not be able to guard an area."

I think people are saying so and so does better but it is all based on personal dinos which are all different lvls etc. For example out of our dinos our Mammoth gets better wood/berries and thatch compared to all our other dinos because it's stats. It's has upped movement speed and 400% melee dam so it gets tons of crap quick. That being said a lvl 1 might not be as good..

playark,3dzvtv,LukethDragon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:23:00 2015 UTC,Difficulty is what level multiplier you will see dinos spawn at.  With normal difficulty they can spawn between levels 1-30. At 2 difficulty they will be 2-60 (and only even numbers). Right now it is 3 so all dinos spawn 3-90 in increments of 3.  With difficulty 4 they will all be at least level 4 up to 120.

playark,3dzvtv,TrikeHerder,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:12:54 2015 UTC,There's no real way to estimate. It really depends on the size and complexity of the update and how many bugs/issues they find.
playark,3dzvtv,TotesMessenger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:17:00 2015 UTC,"On average it seems to end up about 2 days after live testing begins, usually a day later than their original eta. Well worth it to avoid bugs though."

playark,3e09jh,TelFiRE,3,Tue Jul 21 00:18:06 2015 UTC,I think they should remove the artifacts from caves and either have them as loot drops from Uber Monsters/technological killing machines and/or special supply drops that can be openly contested.
playark,3e09jh,Norlamin,5,Tue Jul 21 03:15:48 2015 UTC,The problem was one or two dominant clans controlled every cave and made it nigh impossible for others to come close to their power this was especially true when they were hyper aggressive and wrecked any biggish looking base they came upon. I suggest just being unable to build in dungeon caves that are important for loot and introducing caves that are ideal for a base but don't provide an economic advantage.

If there's only X amount of slots/spawns for a certain animal, only so many of them can be of higher level. Sometimes none of them are due to different circumstances. It'd take less time to kill 10 dinos than it would to try to talk the devs into fixing something that isn't broken."
playark,3e1yc0,jug_ornot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:37:15 2015 UTC,"I have read it will be the spider kibble but they currently do not lay eggs, obviously the system is not complete and there will be gaps as not all the creatures are in the game yet."
playark,3e1yc0,Kyo_daikun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:42:42 2015 UTC,"Can you confirm where you read that? I haven't been able to find any information beyond ""they added a Bronto favorite kibble""."
playark,3e2gva,Aberdinho,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:17:13 2015 UTC,The server might be updating to v188 and comeback when it is done.
playark,3e2gva,HallBro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:20:37 2015 UTC,"Did you update today with the new patch? I'm betting the server is not showing because it is still on the last patch. Just wait until they update, and it will show again on your server browser list."
playark,3e2gva,jacob902u,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:20:44 2015 UTC,"Ok thanks guys, i'll keep an eye out. Thought it might be something like that. :)"
playark,3e2fto,sterger7,3,Tue Jul 21 13:07:04 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the preferred berry is better than a non preferred kibble from what I tested.
playark,3e2fto,jacob902u,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:21:46 2015 UTC,Yeap. This has been the case for me as well. I tested dodo kibbles on various different dinos and found that mejoberries or regular raw meat were better in every way.
playark,3e2fto,eyoo1109,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:55:07 2015 UTC,"then why even put kibbles in.  eggs are so ridiculously hard to get anyway, makes this whole thing meaningless"
playark,3e2fto,ShakeDeSnake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:47:31 2015 UTC,"I'm up to 17 bronto eggs, and I don't even play that much. I think I need close to 46"
playark,3e2fto,Svieri,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:43:30 2015 UTC,"Not exactly sure what the question is, but yes, it's true that dodo kibble is only useful for taming ichthyosaurs via the no-KO method.  There's no point in giving any dino non-preferred kibble while taming, for that matter."
playark,3e2fto,Jingman,2,Tue Jul 21 13:16:12 2015 UTC,There is no generic kibble. You either get the preferred kibble or youre wasting it. You also don't have to do a full kibble tame if you're struggling to find the eggs.
playark,3e2fto,Taenaebrae,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:31:44 2015 UTC,"You can farm bronto eggs, there is a spot where you can gather 15+ per 30min, with the new patch i would guess even more."
playark,3e2fto,robaldeenyo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:52:05 2015 UTC,where is said spot?
playark,3e2fto,Taenaebrae,2,Tue Jul 21 15:18:52 2015 UTC,"68/28, there are 20+ bronto around the lake"
playark,3e2fto,Svieri,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:27:07 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much where my base is.  Yes, it's nice for a little while after the server comes up, then someone kills all of them for prime, and they don't respawn like that again for many, many hours.  You certainly cannot count on getting anywhere close to 15 eggs in 30 minutes; you'd be lucky to even get 1 on a populated server."
playark,3e2egu,ukdrewuk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:54:18 2015 UTC,The config file was reset on the new 1.88 update. Not sure if they will do again later on so i reccomend adding to the server launch parameters in a bat file. This is outside the game so will nvr be reset except by you.

playark,3e2cmt,Funkoma,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:54:54 2015 UTC,"Same here. The installation of 188 didn't wipe anything other than the config file, so I loaded the server settings portion from a backup."
playark,3e2cmt,dmetzcher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:44:26 2015 UTC,Where are you seeing that unofficial server are wiped with 188. I've only seen a post stating the server custom have been reset.

playark,3e2cmt,bizniach,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:58:44 2015 UTC,Copy the saved arks folder as a backup somewhere safe. There are only few files needed from it but this is the easiest for the non tech savy. :) this can be used to reload the prior unless the new update wont load it but this hasnt happened to me yet.
playark,3e2cmt,jacob902u,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:46:10 2015 UTC,Sweet! Thanks! Will do that.

playark,3e2aqr,Kibbinz3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:40:06 2015 UTC,"Criken's ""Cult of Earthworm Jerry"" is pretty good, only 3 episodes at the moment but they're pretty good. The next episode to be released looks like it will have a large raid and battle in it, so that's cool. If your looking for longer vids with general higher level play, Strippin has his streams saved in the past broadcasts section of his twitch profile."
playark,3e2ak6,chrisono,2,Tue Jul 21 12:14:44 2015 UTC,"Usually when they have given more levels (or engram points), they introduced a tier or a lot more items. It seems since they only gave us three new items, they did not give us more engrams. So you will still have to choose wisely on your engrams."
playark,3e2ak6,jacob902u,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:47:07 2015 UTC,"makes sence, just didnt know if my char was bugged or not, thanks"
playark,3e2ak6,gimboidnk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:51:49 2015 UTC,"You are not intended to be able to learn everything. Sometimes when you suddenly saw you got more points, it's because as part of the balance, they actually decided that X Engram would cost 6 points instead of 9, thus when you logged in you had 3 more."
playark,3e2ak6,Arsenic_Touch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:42:06 2015 UTC,"yeah that makes sense too, thanks"
playark,3e2ak6,ShakeDeSnake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:52:13 2015 UTC,However they have continued to add more levels to somewhat account for the new items being added. They've added quite a few items recently without adding any additional points. That's the point the OP is making.   It was done this way to not screw max level players out of the newly added items.
playark,3e2ak6,Aeleas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:52:40 2015 UTC,Max level is 71... Added with traps+bbq

playark,3e291q,insanetwo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:20:10 2015 UTC,You already can use large dinos as a sort of multi-user saddles. You can even do this on trikes. Just mount one and dismount. Then have a friend mount the trike and drive while you shoot arrows from on top of the trike.
playark,3e28xx,Liquidhex0r,0,Tue Jul 21 11:58:39 2015 UTC,make it clear to the big ass tribe that they're possibly in danger or lure them in to help you with some rewards. 1000 paste if they whipe them out or whatever
playark,3e28xx,Nhiyla,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:39:22 2015 UTC,"I love the idea of a small band of people waging guerilla warfare against a much bigger entity, but they have to be supplied by someone else, as they need to remain hidden.   Hide a wooden base in a forest area out of the direct path between mountains, rivers, obelisks etc. Talk to the bigger tribe, whilst keeping the location of your small hidden base a secret. Try to get them to see that they're in as much danger as you are, and maybe they'll help you out in your efforts in exchange for you sticking your balls in the piranha pool on their behalf."
