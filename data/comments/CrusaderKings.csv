CrusaderKings,3e1prd,ImperialPsycho,7,Tue Jul 21 16:21:32 2015 UTC,They were supporting an autocratic dictator against a democratically elected government. They were also supporting a defender of religious freedom against fanatics. Trying to pick out heroes and villains is usually a mistake.
CrusaderKings,3e1prd,Galle_,13,Tue Jul 21 16:26:47 2015 UTC,"Democratically elected is a strong word. The 'Rump' Parliament was so named as, while it may have once been elected by vote (Of land-holding eligible males), all Royalists and sympathisers had long been purged from it's ranks, and it consistently refused to hold free elections.   Why? Because they knew that any freely elected Parliament would likely mean a return to monarchy. I won't go into the other constitutional settlements that Cromwell tried after he dissolved the Rump, but it's fair to say, 'democratic elections' were in short supply."
CrusaderKings,3e1prd,ImperialPsycho,6,Tue Jul 21 16:50:31 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah, the electoral processes of 17th century England were bullshit as hell, I won't deny that. ""Proto-democratic"" might be better. They were fighting for the principle that the monarch could be held accountable to the people below him, in an age when that was still considered a controversial idea.  It's an important development in the modern democratic tradition.  Like many important steps in the modern democratic tradition, its imnmediate results were mass murder and dismal failure. But the whole ""Evil Cromwell"" thing is kind of one-sided."
CrusaderKings,3e1prd,Galle_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:58:40 2015 UTC,"Parliamentary Oligarchy.   And I agree anyone who slags off Cromwell as this big bad evil tyrant is generally got some personal axe to grind. He wasn't a lovely person but neither were any heads of state at the time.  It is the Napoleon effect. People who don't actually study history and involve in critical thinking just spout whatever the propaganda in their country was at the time.   Notice most of the ""ogres"" of European history were normally only villanised because they were against the political and religious status quo. And it is certainly true in those eras that it really was the victors who wrote history. If the monarchy wasn't restored in England I'm sure many more people would think of Cromwell as a tough man who did what needed to be done for democracy or something like that instead.   If you want to understand history and not just spew a load of bullshit you need to be objective. Anyone who acts like Cromwell stands out as particually evil is either ignorant or has a personal problem with what he did (being Irish, a devout Catholic, etc whatever it is still silly). Objectively he was no worse, and arguably a lot ""better"", than many other rulers in Europe in the same period."

Reinforcement cost of prestige-based retinues is now set to zero if the owner doesn't have any prestige. Various event fixes. fixed bug where army movement arrow would stop showing progress Nomad clans now get their empire title immediately when going independent (previously on daily tick) Shia title now properly claimed from the uprising Fixed bug where european merchant republics could build trade posts in india. Fixed double nomad capital bug A lot of tweaks to diseases to try and naturally clean up overpopulated courts Improved some stuttering issues when running at pseed 5 Will generate a character for the reformed religion if there are no legible religious heads. Fixed the trigger for building trade posts Should now properly call in nomads into a faction war Given kingdoms in Scandinavia some crusader weights for norse pagan reformed Should now only lower the music if background sound is high enough and not by as much as it was before No longer plays a sound when you get money from tributaries Nerfed pillaging holdings The context music can now be controlled in the settings menu   MODDING:   Historical setup errors are now shown in historical_setup_errors.log instead of error.log. Using the launch command fullhistoricalsetuplog will show all the historical setup errors and not just the important ones. The Missing scripted successor will no longer show up in the historical setup log if the history entry is before 1066.9.7. (MISSING_SCRIPTED_SUCCESSOR_ERROR_CUTOFF in defines.lua) The uses_prestige_for_law_change government effect now works the same way as uses_piety_for_law_change. Added government effect builds_with_piety. free_revoke_on_tiers will no longer always state that revocation is allowed on emirates. Cultures are now scripted with a list of graphical cultures instead of just allowing two."

CrusaderKings,3e26v7,smilingstalin,6,Tue Jul 21 14:00:10 2015 UTC,"Unless I've misread the patch notes, this only allows you to move capital from a landlocked province to a coastal one. This is presumably to allow a Merchant Republic who loses coastal provinces and finds themselves on the mainland to transfer back out to the coast so as to join up trade posts to the capital properly.   (Wasn't an issue prior to 2.4 as they'd change to normal Republics immediately upon losing their coastal capital.)"

""The person who will inherit the title belongs to another realm."" is NOT true, there's another notification for that called ""Vassal Inheritance Warning"" and it wil specifically specify that the title will pass away from YOUR REALM.  This notification however, is about a title you hold yourself (in your personal demesne) which your direct heir (the character you will play after your ruler dies) will not inherit. The most likely case is: You have gavelkind succesion and more than 1 son. If your highest title is of a higher tier than the one you will lose the inheritting party will still be the vassal of your main heir after inheritance. (You should probably read up on succesion laws in ck2, it's very important)  The other ones are already answered so I won't try to confuse you."

CrusaderKings,3e2llz,hamdidamdi61,6,Tue Jul 21 17:59:21 2015 UTC,"1)You need to post a photo of the title in question so we can figure it out. The heir to the title might be someone from another realm, thus taking your county when the current ruler dies. 2)Betrothed means the character will marry that girl when she is an adult. 3)Minor titles are titles you give away to keep your vassals happy, like an almoner. Also, commanders are considered minor titles. You give the commander title to someone in your realm/court so they can command armies. They are useful. Say you got a bishop who likes the pope 84 and you 75, which makes him pay his taxes to the pope rather than to you. If you give him a minor title, like that of an almoner, your relation will go up by 10, making him like you more than he likes the pope. That way, he would be paying his taxes to you."
CrusaderKings,3e2llz,bluesolid,2,Tue Jul 21 14:05:28 2015 UTC,"A minor title is one of the special titles like cupbearer and commander, not a county for a duke like in your example. Minor titles make people like you better and commanders can lead armies.  Edit: Said this before OP edited his 3)"

CrusaderKings,3e31zc,seanjohn12117,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:04:09 2015 UTC,"There's many strategies that could be used. For example you can split up your army and use part of your army to hunt down opposing armies while the other part of your army sieges down holdings. You could also hunt down his main army with your entire army and then split up your army in many small armies to siege down holdings.   Opposing armies generally try to flee if they notice a bigger army moving into their location; try to catch them in places where it takes you less time to move in than it takes for them to move away. Going from a small province to another small province doesn't take much time, while going from a big province to another big province takes a lot longer. You can hover over the armies to see what their expected arrival date is. If your arrival date is after their departure date, you won't be able to catch them.  Good targets to siege down: the main holding of each province that's part of the war goal. All holdings in the capital. Any holdings directly owned by the ruler.  If your armies are bigger than the supply of most provinces, start sieging near the border. Sieging castles takes long but reduces the enemies ability to regenerate troops. Sieging cities can be quick and gives more warscore since warscore depends on the income of the holding. Sieging temples of a different religion will give piety and will increase moral authority of your religion.  For ideas on expansions, check the DLC guide. It's missing the newest DLC Horse Lords which lets you play nomadic rulers which have a completely different way of running their lands."

They should be able to band together (like vassals in a faction) to stop paying. And they shouldn't have to join wars. And there should be a limit.

CrusaderKings,3e2nzy,AbeFromanSK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:18:38 2015 UTC,"Nicely done! A couple of pointers for playing as Catholics: you can request a claim on a Catholic ruler's title from the Pope (rarely granted, unless he's your vassal), and if you go to the screen for a title itself (by clicking the title on the character that owns it, or by searching for the title) you can see a button called 'Claimants'. If you invite a claimant for a title to your court, land them, and then press the claim for the title, then they take that title and become your vassal, as long as the title is a lower rank than your primary title.  As an emperor, this is a handy way of snatching kingdoms from other Catholics, and as a king it's a handy way of snatching duchies."

A vassal Pope will merrily grant you claims on all of France, if you order him to. Some people like that, some don't. It's quite long winded to set up.   To set up a vassal pope you need to first be an emperor (because the Pope is a king, so to vassalize him you need to be the rank above him), declare an anti-pope (requires Free Investiture, and a friendly bishop), and then attack the current Pope in Rome and win with the 'Install Pope' casus belli.  As a new player, I warn you: abandon this game now; it will eat all the free time out your life."

CrusaderKings,3dycxx,Petruchio_,6,Tue Jul 21 04:12:04 2015 UTC,"TL;DR It's not actually too bad, with the right micromanagement it can be dealt with, but it is really annoying.  Gavelkind Succession and its pagan counterpart Elective Gavelkind take more micro management. You can't be popping out children with your wife like you can with primogeniture lest you want your kingdom to break apart, or your empire to destabilize and form large claimant factions. That's why it's a joke, because it is objectively one of the worst succession laws. It's possibly the most destabilizing. It slows you down as you either have to reconquer at the least half of your lands back, or you have to deal with brother vassals who want nothing more than to see you dead so they can claim your throne.  It can be controlled by keeping your willy in your pants. It's recommended to not marry, but take the seduce focus to make lots of bastards who you can pick one to legitimize. If you don't have that then maybe concubines offer the best heir producing machine as you can set them aside without the opinion malus of that woman's dynasty.  Some people like it though, and they consider it sort of like a flavor event. Something to break up the constant outside waring that could get dull."

This went well with their Fuedal mentality that some men are better than others. Each level had kings.  Elephant and Lion were thought to be the king of the animals.

CrusaderKings,3e3n8i,b3048099,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:28:57 2015 UTC,"Christian (Catholics and Fraticelli) crusades unlock together with one another. Jihads unlock together with one another. All pagan GHWs unlock together (but can only be launched by the head of a reformed religion) and require that either the crusades or the jihads have begun. Jewish and Zoroastrian GHWs are enabled as soon as the religious head exists. The Indian religions don't get any GHWs.  Depending on the outcome of the first crusade(s), jihad(s) and/or GHW(s), the others might soon fire. Pagan GHWs have a MTTH of 120 months to unlock after the crusades/jihads have begun (if there is at least one pagan religious head), so they should fire rather quickly if there is a reformed religion. If the first crusade is launched and takes (for example) Jerusalem, the jihads should unlock quickly after that (if there is a caliph). The opposite is true if Greece or some other regions fall to a jihad/invasion."

CrusaderKings,3e2n63,BestFriendWatermelon,4,Tue Jul 21 18:48:22 2015 UTC,"Firstly, if they're raiding your vassal's counties, ignore them. They're your vassal's problem, not yours. The raiders will keep your vassals weak for you, so it could actually be considered a plus.  You can reduce the likelihood of them attacking your holdings by building fortifications and walls in your counties. Not just in the barony you control, the cities and temples within those counties should have walls as well.   When you click on a province, there should be an orange bar with a silver/grey line crossing it. This is the loot bar, and it's what the raiders are after. Everything to the left of the silver line is ""protected loot"", essentially representing the wealth of the province that is protected behind the walls of your castles, cities and bishoprics. The raiders are after the unprotected loot, so building fortifications will shift the silver bar to the right and reduce the attractiveness of your province to raiders.  Another thing you can do is strengthen your vassals so they can take care of raiders themselves. In the late game, when you have a large, sprawling empire, you'll have king level vassals that will raise their own armies to drive raiders away without any involvement from you at all. But in the mean time, duke vassals will be able to fend off a lot of attacks, as they control the counties neighbouring the county under attack and after a few weeks will raise their own armies to eject the raiders."

CrusaderKings,3dx7xp,LearnsSomethingNew,5,Tue Jul 21 13:11:14 2015 UTC,"The issue is not cross-posting and the issue is not cross-reddit interaction by individuals. It's a matter of momentum and organisation by groups of users. Whether it's to be the first penguin in Club Penguin to start shouting obfuscated racial slurs (to avoid the swear filter) or to be the first to call into a Christian TV chatshow to troll them, brigading is about getting an audience. The people who actually act (post comments) want to be seen in the frontline of the charge; the paratroopers dropped down within enemy lines. They wouldn't make those comments if they felt their views would be poorly received. And it'd be fine if they were posts calling for moderation but neither posts from pro-FPH or anti-FPH tend to be. A brigade/cross-post also changes the audience, so that upvotes/downvotes do not fairly represent the actual community.   This is not a uniquely SRD issue and I've read over the new rules posted and I'm really impressed. I think we can learn a lot from spez's post last week on deference to a community's values whilst also practising active moderation against harassing behaviour."

CrusaderKings,3e0g2n,eisagi,9,Tue Jul 21 04:27:50 2015 UTC,"For a game called Crusader Kings 2, crusades are remarkably simple. The allocation is horrific, the joining perhaps worse.  There are several mechanics which SHOULD exist, but don't.  1: Interaction with the Greeks Crusader-Byzantine relations were shattered irrevocably at the Siege of Antioch, when Alexius (thinking the crusade had failed, thanks to the deserter Stephen of Blois) failed to uphold his side of the bargain, and marched back to Constantinople. Despite this, Crusaders of the 1st crusade had to march through Constantinople, and the high-ranking princes were given gifts of gold, and were effectively strong-armed into submitting to the Byzantines as vassals. This is completely unrepresented in game.  2: Crusade Commanders Many times high ranking and influential characters assumed de facto command of the crusade, and it's armies. This lended the crusades an array of unity, and in game will prevent them from sending stack after stack unsupported into Palestine to die alone. The Leader should be chosen based on a combination of Diplomacy, piety, prestige and Marshall, with troop contribution factored in somehow.  3: Vows Crusaders had to say vows, and for all intents and purposes forsake their land in Europe unless they were very powerful. One below the rank of king should have to give away their Europe bound counties and duchies, to relatives or not. Then their personal fortunes would depend entirely on the success of the Crusade, and stop people from marching to the holy land just to get the trait.  4: A brand-new title-allocation system. I mean, admit it. The current system is absolutely horrific. For one thing, less should be put upon the de-jure limits of Jerusalem (Or whatever other kingdom) All occupied titles should be taken, causing chaos that certainty existed when some baronies were Muslim held, and some crusader held. The person who occupies them should take them, as was agreed by the Crusaders during the first crusade. The Leader of the crusade should take Jerusalem and the title king of Jerusalem  5: Trade The Crusader states were a linchpin of trade that helped revolutionize the Medieval economy. This should be reflected somewhat.  I had some other Ideas, but now have totally forgotten them (thanks, brain!) If anyone has any other ideas, I'd be happy to hear them."

Pikes led by a scotsman, on the other hand, has the supremely brilliant schiltron tactic, offering gigantic defence and offence bonuses to the pikemen.

The Patriarch of Constantinople + the Eastern Roman Emperor claimed all Christian authority in the East, because the Roman Patriarchy only extended to the West, and the other three Patriarchs were trapped within the Caliphates. The crusades had to be invented by an independent and self-confident Papacy.  Some historians argue that the real split between the churches wasn't in 1054, but in 1096. because that's when the Papacy/Roman Patriarchy asserted its authority in the East and acted without the approval of and against the wishes of the Byzantine authorities, who didn't want unruly foreign armies in their lands with competing claims on former Eastern Roman territory. The Byzantines tried their best to manage the situation, but either failed to control the crusaders or made enemies with them, leading to further antagonism and eventually the Fourth Crusade, after which the split was permanently sealed in blood."

CrusaderKings,3dxr5y,Tuerai,10,Mon Jul 20 14:00:23 2015 UTC,"So you can become English. I haven't checked the event files since they added other melting pot cultures, but to become English, you need to have a Norman cultured ruler (not top-liege necessarily) ruling over an Anglo-Saxon province after the year 1100. This will proc the melting pot event that begins converting rulers and provinces to English culture, and within de jure England, English spreads almost as well as Mongol culture.  Note that you can also quite frequently find courtiers of English culture before the year 1100, and if you can then just get English culture the normal way.  The year 1100 is also important, as once in a 1066 start, I invaded as Willy the Bastard, took every province in England, and installed all high-stewardship Norman rulers. I then accidentally culture converted all of England to Normand before 1100 and the melting pot never fired.  Also, an easy way to keep some Normans around is to give Cornwall to a Norse ruler, as Breton is considered a French-region culture, and will thus spawn Norman culture from Norse rulers. At least unless they updated this to use the new regions."

One GIANT trade zone is better than a bunch of small ones Shoot for republic vassals, that means you want to give counties to mayors not barons (also I'm not sure if it's game as intended it bugged right now, but in my current Venice game the counties keep going feudal after a few years, it's super annoying) You need either high stewardship or high diplomacy to keep foreign lords from torching your trade posts, I don't know exactly what skill level you need but I'm pretty sure it's 10 for the ""you don't want to torch my trade posts"" response to their threats Retinues are your best friend, between the low levies from all your mayor vassals and the inability to hold alliances (thanks seniority...) you're gonna be on your own most of the time"
CrusaderKings,3dzl1p,Mistuhbull,3,Mon Jul 20 23:14:55 2015 UTC,"The problem with the giant trade zones is that your vassals will constantly fight for the zones next to your first one.

CrusaderKings,3dzl1p,RadiantSolarWeasel,4,Tue Jul 21 15:24:30 2015 UTC,Remember that family dues are not just lost to the void you can reclaim part of it through inheritance.
CrusaderKings,3dzl1p,Fernichu,3,Tue Jul 21 01:07:52 2015 UTC,"My thoughts on a merchant republic (as someone who has not played the game much):   get a large family of adult males early to increase your trade post limit; marry them if you want, but only to women who will join your court as opposed to taking the men away from your court upgrade your trade posts as well as your holdings ensure that your vassals are all mayors instead of lords, so that you can get more money from taxes at some point, you may have 'too many' trade posts (i.e. any new trade posts would likely be sacked by enemies).  At this point i wanted to get rid of male dynasty members from my court by marrying them to single female holy women and by giving them conquered land.  This reduced the amount of money that leaves my hands due to family dues.   (edit: formatting)"
CrusaderKings,3dzl1p,belkak210,3,Mon Jul 20 22:11:53 2015 UTC,"Retinues, retinues, retinues. The military warehouse palace upgrades, along with decent military organisation tech will let you have a good raiding force (I use stacks of 3 light skirmish retinues, since only raw numbers really matter for raiding) and a good standing army (housecarl retinues are now one of the best in the game).  Second, abuse the 'designated heir' honourary title along with concubinage to have a massive family and pick the best heir. Keep your family dues low by landing failed family members in baronies in your demesne or newly conquered cities.  Never give land to your fellow patrician families; they pay 50% less tax than normal mayors. Also, when a patrician family is wiped out, their trade posts are distributed evenly among the other 4 houses, regardless of trade post limit, so killing off any family that makes it to 4 trade posts saves you from having to build them.  Ignore levy increasing holding upgrades; retinues and mercenaries will be your bread and butter, so upgrade tax income and build universities."

CrusaderKings,3dzl1p,callanrocks,3,Tue Jul 21 05:39:49 2015 UTC,"Just a few thoughts, since others have been pretty thorough in this thread:   Remember that a successful succession only requires sufficient gold, as you can pour money into your campaign fund until your heir will win the election. Trading posts and Palace upgrades are generally more profitable than holding upgrades (especially since Palace upgrades also boost your stats and will never be lost, as you will own that holding for as long as your republic exists). All of your vassals will ideally be republics, as they pay more taxes and have no opinion penalties. Consequentially, picking options which improve opinion with republics (like the business focus) become significantly more useful The large amount of gold you will be taking in, combined with the relatively small levy size means that retinues and mercenaries will be the bread and butter of your military (Although you will have significantly more ships at your disposal than feudal rulers) Finally, you can leverage the trade post system to strategic advantage as well. While connected posts give more gold with a trade zone bonus, you get a free cb to seize whatever cities you build a trading post in, which can provide interesting opportunities for blobbing expanding your empire, as long as you can afford the increased distance cost.   You might want to consider expanding your trade empire to cover the whole Baltic region/north sea area, given that the white sea is only one trade zone."

Once there is none left then their house will disband and all their trade posts will be split between the remaining families including yours. The new house that replaces them will be extremely small so they'll be easy to wipe out as well after they build enough trade posts.  I haven't tried this yet or read the patch notes for the current patch so Idk if it still works.

If you control 51+% of the posts adjacent to a sea space, then you get a trade zone there as well. You want to connect these trade zones to your capital, because this gives you a 40% bonus to trade power, which increases taxes. One thing you can do to make this easier is to have your capital as far away from the de-jure capital when you change from tribal and switch it to the de-jure after the other families begin to build their posts. This will at least give you a head start in making your trade routes.   Raise your retinue cap as high as possible. The buildings for this are the warehouse and its upgrades in your mansion (+1200 total) and the garrison in your trade posts (+100 each). This will allow you to field a significantly larger army.   Also, have as many children as possible so that you can abuse the designated heir title."

CrusaderKings,3e0om7,blolfighter,3,Tue Jul 21 01:33:50 2015 UTC,"I'll base my advice on my 2.1.6 game as the Hashimids (starting in 867):  Start with a small dynasty; preferably one that only has one landed character (an unlanded son or brother is fine). Marry plenty of women to ensure heirs. When your son(s) get of age, arrange marriages for them as well. Don't let your brother(s) marry unless you desperately need another heir. This will be standard procedure until the end of time.  Anyone who goes decadent should be imprisoned if they don't straighten up (keep a piety buffer at all times). They are never getting out (unless they inherit), even if they are your Strong Genius heir. No exceptions. You want your decadence as close to zero as possible. The only exception I made to this rule was not releasing prisoners during one of the Ramadan events (as it would release all the traitors that currently weren't in any faction). Other than that, there should not be many cases when getting decadence is better than the alternative. If someone asks to join the holy order when it activates, let them do so unless they are your heir (and you don't prefer his younger brother). They will never generate decadence and will give you a piety boost if one of them takes over the holy order. They will also generally avoid (re)marrying, which limits the number of men running around.  Becoming the caliph is a nice long-term goal (especially since it gives you a piety boost and some nice CBs), but don't rush it. Assuming you don't start as the vassal of the Green Blob of Doom, make sure that you grow in different directions and that you constantly improve relations with your chancellor.  If you are a vassal, make sure that you stay on their good side and that you create duchies/kingdoms quickly to prevent the AI from doing it for you and granting the title to one of your vassals. Keep in mind that free duchy revokation is a thing (this is one of the reasons that I would not recommend a vassal). NEVER marry one of your daughters off to someone of the same dynasty as the dominant blob. While the alliance might be nice, the possibility of them getting their hands on even one dynastic claimant is not something you want to risk.  Even though it temporarily lowers decadence, it is counterproductive to give land to dynasty members. Landed characters tend to get more children, and will marry if they aren't already (and will go for more than one wife, usually). This means that they will start pumping out children, who might become decadent in turn. One landed dynast can result in a dozen decadent dynasty members in a generation or two.  Agnatic Open, free duchy revokation, and law changes costing piety (and not requiring vassal approval) makes for a potent weapon against your own vassals (if they are dukes). Get to at least Medium CA (no infighting) and don't give new land to anyone of a major dynasty. As there is no possibility of a title being inherited down the female line, your vassals will not inherit any titles through marriages. If they somehow still get a duchy you don't want them to have, revoke it for free. At worst, you have to fight a brief war against a duke and can then keep him imprisoned for life. I would suggest getting Absolute CA as you can then ensure that your vassals can't expand (barring any titles inherited from another realm, which should not be an issue if you don't give land to great houses).  Also, keep in mind that you cannot ask someone to straighten up during a regency. If you know you are about to die and that there will be a long regency, it might be worth placing your marshal in your capital and imprisoning every adult male of your dynasty who isn't on the council. Sure, your vassals will hate you, but as the alternative is a potential decadence invasion, you should show no mercy."

CrusaderKings,3e0j79,RCHO,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:00:28 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hijack, but how often do the events fire and under what conditions?  I've gone through two rulers with the Rulership focus and I've had precisely nothing come up, aside from the one time I managed to get Stressed (which I wanted because I wanted to die). The focus has otherwise become a no-man's land to me, which is kind of unfortunate because the Scholarship>Carousing>Family>Hunting cycle gets old after a while."
CrusaderKings,3e0j79,Dalewyn,2,Tue Jul 21 02:10:14 2015 UTC,"The short version is that the events each fire roughly once every 23 years, independently of one another, and the common ingredient is that you be a free, capable adult.  There are three categories of Rulership-building events. One event fires for a province you control, two fires for a vassal of yours, and the rest fire for you.  The events that can fire for you each has a 1/280 chance of firing every month, meaning it should fire roughly once every 23 years. They, and their other conditions if any, are   Man is accused of murder A farm has caught fire   You have a free, capable, AI, adult vassal who is neither your close relative nor spouse  A woman is accused of witchcraft   There is at least one province in your demesne  A Drunken Rampage   You have a free, capable, AI, adult, drunkard vassal who is neither your close relative nor spouse    The first vassal event is Feuding Nobles. This can fire for any of your free, capable, adult  vassals, provided you have a second such vassal who is neither your close relative nor spouse. For each such vassal, the event has a 1/280 chance of firing, so it should fire once every 23 years, but each vassal can be involved in only one such feud.  The second vassal event is Brigands. This can fire for any of your direct vassals who is a Mayor, provided you   Are a capable adult, Are not a close relative of or married to the Mayor, and Have an AI non-mayor, free, capable, adult vassal who is also neither a close relative nor married to you.   Every month, each such Mayor has a 1/420 chance of firing this event, meaning it should happen roughly once every 35 years for each such Mayor.  The provincial event is the Architect. If you   Are non-tribal, Are non-nomadic, Have at least 400g, and Have not previously been given this offer,   there is a chance that an Architect will approach you and offer to build a castle. Every month, each province in your demesne with an empty holding slot has a 1/280 chance of generating this event. So if you had only one such province, the average wait would be a bit more than 23 years. With additional appropriate provinces, the wait time decreases because each one gets the chance."
CrusaderKings,3e0j79,RCHO,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:45:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! CK2Wiki only has a cursory summary with no real numbers, so I really appreciate it.  The average wait times of ~23 years suggests to me the Rulership focus really isn't something I should take, unless I was actively role-playing such an individual or something."
CrusaderKings,3e0j79,Dalewyn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:51:42 2015 UTC,"While the average time between each instance of each event is 23 years, it's worth noting that this is calculated monthly and independently for each event. So just with the four events that fire for you, you expect an average time between some event firing of only about 6 years.  If you also have, say, three mayor vassals, including the Brigand events leads to a wait time of just under 4 years.  And then there are the feuding nobles, which can actually be quite frequent if you have a lot of vassals, but the time between such feuds goes up everytime one of them happens, because the two nobles involved are removed from the pool of potential feuds."
CrusaderKings,3e0j79,RCHO,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:22:25 2015 UTC,Ok this makes some sense then.  So my current Emperor is already Diligent and Ambitious.  He is also in the Martial education line.  So the only positive events that could be happening for me are  +15% to Administrator next step +15% to become Just  Thanks for the clarification I guess I'm  just getting Poor RNG on the encounters.  I thought I was just doing a terrible job of guessing the event answers  :)

CrusaderKings,3dxnf9,ProSkink,6,Mon Jul 20 19:11:12 2015 UTC,"It definitely undermines some of the tribal experience, but for a feudal lord I think it's fine (from a balance perspective; as with so much else in this game, I think the implementation is unnecessarily shallow).  How often it happens depends on several factors. It's significantly more likely to fire for a tribal character than a ruler in a feudal realm, for example (explanation is below). It also has a much bigger relative effect on the income of a tribe.  When it fires, if you ignore the traits, choosing to debase the coins will get you 100g, 100 prestige, and a 25% chance of losing 200 prestige after one year. So you expect this choice to be worth an average of 100g and 50 prestige, provided the event fires often enough.  Since a tribal ruler who's dedicated to keeping this focus can expect to get the event every other year, on average, this amounts to a yearly influx of 50g and 25 prestige. Hence, taking the Business focus as a tribal ruler essentially amounts to an extra 4g and 2 prestige per month, which is significant compared to the typical income you'd see (especially as a duke or lower).  Frequency Discussion  Roughly once every other year, a character with the Business focus gets to start one of their event chains. The possibilities are   Become Stressed (15)   Requires not already Stressed  Artisan Workshop (30)   Requires controlled city holding in a demesne province  Sell Land to Mayor (30)   Requires controlled unowned city holding in your capital  Mint Coins (30)   No requirements  Carpenters Guild (30)   As Sell Land to Mayor AND after year 1000  Build a Tower (30)   Non-tribal only Requires never built a tower or hedge-maze Requires no lifestyle traits Requires the ""Trader"" character modifier  The Hedge Maze (30)   As Tower, except tribal allowed  Trade Route (30)   Requires you have a Steward Requires a suitable trade target Requires not currently working on a trade route Requires not already established a trade route    The numbers here are the base relative likelihood of that event being the one chosen. So if all of them are possible, for example, Mint Coins has a 2 / 15 chance of being chosen. This means that, on average, you'd expect to see it once every 15 years or so.  But, not all of these are always possible. For tribal rulers, in particular, several of them are irrelevant. If your realm has no cities and you're already stressed, then the coins, trade route, and hedge maze are your only possibilities. They're all equally likely, so you would end up seeing this event an average of once every six years. Except that the other two can each happen only once. So after you've built your trade route and hedge maze, you're left with only minting coins. Now, every other year or so, you'll be given the option to mint coins."

I pillaged about 50% of Greece and formed a gigantic merchant republic out of what I didn't destroy.   All other gains I formed into super duchies that could form kingdoms since nomads can't give them to feudal vassals.

CrusaderKings,3dyv9q,raiker123,4,Mon Jul 20 17:28:11 2015 UTC,"A great way to expand without using holy war is to pick a target title of lower rank than your primary (e.g. a duchy if you're a king), check the title for claimants (click the button in the title window), invite to you court anyone young-ish who will accept your invitation (the war ends if they die partway through), give them any old piece of land, then press their claim. Since you just made him your vassal, the claimant will still be your vassal when he gains the territory, and he'll love you for pressing his claim. Once you get to emperor tier, this is incredibly powerful because you can take entire kingdoms. Still nowhere near as good as tribal invasion, though."

CrusaderKings,3dyv9q,tirion1987,2,Mon Jul 20 20:04:04 2015 UTC,The best way to get CBs as a feudal lord is to invite claimants into your court. They will accept as long as they are same religion as you. Then grant them a barony or a county and press their claim. Just make sure their claim is for a smaller title (if you are king only press claims for duchies and counties).  Playing as a muslim in Spain is fun. What I also like doing is playing as a Viking and converting to Islam. The option to convert comes up in the intrigue menu as long as you have a muslim concubine. You can imprison muslim women by raiding and razing the coasts of north Africa.

Similarly, if the infidel is closer to home (capital of the strongest supporter of that religion multiplied by some sort of moral authority modifier) and/or if they have been in recent wars with strong supporters of your own religion, they get infidel penalty accordingly.

Also prepare by having a ruler who has that 750 piety and is well loved: Ideally, at the time you convert and reform then demand conversion, your vassals are affected by the opinion boost from both a Feast and a Grand Tournament. Also, get rid of your Zealous vassals beforehand, and preferably fuck up Catholic MA in one step: appoint an Antipope, order the Excommunication of Zealous potential troublemakers, imprison and execute them without tyranny (even their heir won't care daddy was beheaded). Obviously you'll need truckloads of Piety for that. As for your son: Brave, Just and Kind are good, but Short Reign can be brutal and you should keep a few thousand gold in reserve for gifts.

This behavior persists even after replacing the Restoration decision and event with the previous version, so it's not a problem in moddable files.  I don't know exactly what's happening, but for some reason, certain de facto vassals of the Byzantine Empire title are being released when it's destroyed, instead of being transferred to the (now primary) Roman Empire title.  [edit]  I did some looking at the Bug report forums to see if this had been reported there, and came across this report, which is really the same thing. According to rageair, in a comment from two days ago,   By following your steps; starting as Ludwig, giving myself Bavaria & Italy and subsequently changing them to primogeniture and destroying them, I seem to be unable to reproduce your issue. This leads me to believe that this issue has been fixed internally, and should reach you in the next patch.   I've now checked the 2.4.2β patch, and this does appear to have been fixed there."

Your allies and family either hate or barely like you. You are being looted by vikings. Your personal demesne is slightly underdeveloped.

CrusaderKings,3dx8a0,CypressCarter,2,Mon Jul 20 12:01:51 2015 UTC,"Instead of relying on your vassal's troops in wars, you are using your own. This costs gold and in a war of attrition where you lose a few battles, get stacked, or just fight tooth and nail and lose a lot of troops. it allows factions to gain more power. After a certain size, never use your own troops unless you have to. Like in your screeen shot, if you had a civil war, you could barely call up 1500 soldiers from your personal demesne. So that superduke could run through Colchester like a hot knife through butter."

CrusaderKings,3dxroy,commissar_ravek,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:32:06 2015 UTC,"Tanistry works by electors picking the most distant relation of the current ruler. Pretty difficult to fix. voting for your genius son won't work, you have to pick someone distantly related to have a chance of winning the vote. It's not great, but hopefully it's enough to get the 37th kinsman 7 times removed with average stats instead of the slothful, craven detached priest 8 times removed on the throne.  Overall, tanistry sucks. But its one saving grace is that if you want interesting roleplay, it's a pretty good way of preventing yourself from powergaming the best heirs and forcing the game to put flawed characters on the throne for you."

Now, I can declare war on the guy, but the war immediately ends before I can do anything, I can't hand the province off to one of my vassals, and I tried quitting/restarting to no avail."
CrusaderKings,3dvu30,Z0mbiN3,7,Sun Jul 19 23:21:43 2015 UTC,"What negative opinion modifiers do they have?   Personally I started using elective monarchy as my succession law and educated my heir in diplomacy to ensure him being elected. That's a bit gamey though and only happens in my ironman games/achievment runs where I cant afford to roleplay.   Edit:  A few general things to think of:  Keep your realm divided - instead of giving new land to your existing vassals, show how much you love a courtier by giving them that duchy you liberated from the heathens.   Use eugenics to your favour - All heartshaped traits are hereditary, try to find someone to breed the perfect heir with (not recommended for roleplaying),  this will improve your heirs opinion with his future vassals.   Avoid having vassals/land in another vassals de jure duchy/kingdom - transfer vassals to them or give a courtier the county and transfer the vassalage of him to the duke  Improve the relation between liege and vassal - Instead of using your chancellor to fabricate claims (a better way of getting claims is through marriage), use him to improve relations with your vassals. A good chancellor can make even the most unruly vassal worship you. I've had more success with this than with bribing them, which I only use to get vassals to join my plot (with a few exceptions).   Revoking a title after a revolt - Easy way to halt your vassals growth, give the title to another vassal within the title's de jure land or if you have a county within the title hold on to it (given that you dont get the ""too many held duchy titles"" penalty) and give it away when your heir inherits. Dont save the title if you have gavelkind, it will only create a claimant to the throne that has a powerbase.   You shouldn't be afraid to release a vassal from prison - The bonus opinion you get from releasing a vassal is more often than not worth the risk of him/her revolting again and could prevent other vassals from rebelling. If I remember correctly this doesn't stack. Check the % of your realms army that they own in before releasing them (in the realm tree which is on your characters page).   Crushing a revolt modifier - Defeating a rebellion gives you an opinion modifier, use the time you have this bonus to improve the relation betweem you and your largest vassals.   Use your spymaster to ensure loyalty - discourage them from joining a faction by sending him to a vassals capital. Not worth the loss of tech points but can be useful (if he has a relative high success chance) when you've had enough of a vassal joining a faction but you dont have a reason to imprison him"
CrusaderKings,3dvu30,afstockholm,7,Sun Jul 19 23:36:26 2015 UTC,"Welcome to Middle Ages!   Give them lands, give them money, raise my prestige, and all that stuff.   Don't cuddle your vassals. The only thing they respect is power.  Increase feudal taxes as high as possible immediately, then other tax types, and crown authority to at least medium, so you have cash. Never bribe anyone with cash unless you need them to join your plot. And borrow from Jews / expel Jews / write down date on paper so you remember to invite them back in 20 years, only to borrow/expel same day.  For vassal management, if you have new land just give it to content character of right culture/religion, otherwise don't bother.  So what to do with all the money? Sit on it. That's right, investment is overrated, you need a throne made of at least 2000 gold, preferably more like 5000.  If you still have gold after that upgrade your capital duchy (assuming you own everything there, that's the only one that won't gavelkind away), and get some retinue.  What does it all have to do with vassal management? Well, if they rebel, spend gold to hire mercs, crush them, and then you get +25 crushed major rebellion with all vassals, you get money from rebels you feel you can work with, and take away titles of ones you don't like.  The best thing about this strategy is that:   all of your money and retinue goes to your heir your land can get divided in case of gavelkind between your heir and other family members your vassal goodwill is instantly gone   That's why you should prioritize money/retinue > land in capital duchy (which goes to heir barring bugs) > land elsewhere (it's fine if primo, if gavelkind treat it all as temporary) > vassal goodwill"
CrusaderKings,3dvu30,taw,4,Sun Jul 19 23:43:10 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but I realize now that I've been too kind to my bastard vassals, who keep rebelling even though we have good relations. Sometimes you gotta put the hammer down.  Somewhat related to this; Is there any point to ask for big levies from your cities? Right now I just put it at ""min"" and max out on taxes, since even large city levies only give you around 50-100 men."
CrusaderKings,3dvu30,InZaintJohn,6,Mon Jul 20 01:01:49 2015 UTC,"Milk all your feudal and city vassals for troops and taxes. City vassals don't provide many troops, but they provide many ships, and that also uses levy % mechanic.  Temple vassals are the only ones you might want to avoid milking if you're Catholic since they have an option of saying ""screw you I'll pay pope instead, and give you 0 troops while I'm at it"". If not Catholic, milk those too.  None of that matters half as much as having as high as possible feudal taxes, as vast majority of your vassals will be feudal - especially since vanilla nerfed the option to have mixed realm and put some ridiculously low %s on your ability to setup republic and bishop vassals.  The only thing not worth doing is high (assuming you're happy with your current inheritance system) and absolute crown authority. That absolutely infuriates everyone and there are huge modifiers to willingness to join factions on top of relations penalties, and it won't even stop all wars in your realm.  AI is 1.5x willing to join faction on medium (which at least gives you cool stuff) and 2.25x on top of that (so ~3.3x total) on high/absolute.  If you want a demonstration that what I'm saying is true, check any game you've ever played. Muslim blobs super-stable, player blob super-stable, everybody else feudal falling apart all the time, right? You know what's the biggest difference? ai_will_do blocks make Muslim AI go for low feudal taxes so AI has some reserve for bad times, and non-Muslim AI go for zero feudal taxes so non-Muslim AI is permanently bankrupt.  I made those blocks do something a bit more sensible (= ""milk your vassals as much as possible"") and like magic everybody is stable unless they are getting wrecked by pony hordes."
CrusaderKings,3dvu30,taw,3,Mon Jul 20 02:53:42 2015 UTC,"Interesting stuff, I always bought the line in the game about increasing crown authority because high authority=victory for the monarch. It's quite frustrating how a lot of the data and algorithms are hidden from you when playing. I've had the same vassal join the stupid independence faction the last 4 times its been around, and at the same time he's got +70 relation with me and no negative ""desires independence"" modifier.  I'm sick of revolts anyway, feels like they just waste my time in the game. Will try your way and see if it helps, at the very least it would allow me to keep an awesome retinue up at all times."
CrusaderKings,3dvu30,InZaintJohn,3,Mon Jul 20 03:09:47 2015 UTC,"There's nothing too wrong about increasing crown authority, but that more rubs in vassals' face that monarch is superpowerful and they're not than actually makes it happen.

CrusaderKings,3dvu30,taw,2,Mon Jul 20 04:27:42 2015 UTC,I would say that the opinion penalty with the mayor from raising city levies isnt worth it considering thay they give more in taxes the higher opinion they have with you. Use the extra money to build a retinue or as emergency mercemary funds.  Same thing applies to churches as long as you can maintain a higher relation with them than their opinion to the religious leader (dont know if priests of other faiths than catholicism refuse to pay taxes to you if they like their religious leader more)
CrusaderKings,3dvu30,afstockholm,2,Mon Jul 20 01:20:58 2015 UTC,"This is only Catholic mechanic. Or maybe Fraticelli, as they also have popes. Even other Christian religions don't have it."
CrusaderKings,3dvu30,taw,4,Mon Jul 20 02:55:13 2015 UTC,"Elective monarchy and raising all your heirs to have diplomacy traits are the key.  Elective monarchy gives +20 opinion from all your vassals, which is usually enough to stop factions ever getting strong enough to rebel.  High diplomacy helps twice; first it improves the base opinion of you of every character in the game considerably, and second it makes sending gifts increase the amount someone likes you by a greater opinion.   Couple of tips:  1) educate heirs yourself where possible, but keep an eye on their age. Just before they turn 16, send them to be educated by someone with the grey eminence trait (the best education trait, IMO). . If nobody with it is available in your court, send them to a grey eminence in someone else's court. The education trait of a child is decided based on the person who's educating them on the day of their 16th birthday. See here for more information.  2) get familiar with the ""find character"" button, one of the 5 buttons underneath the minimap in the bottom right of the screen. You can search for particular names, traits etc and filter them by gender, religion and various other things. Use them to find genius/strong wives for your family. But more importantly, use it to start inviting talented people to your court. See here for more details.   With a high diplomacy ruler and high diplomacy chancellor (invite one if necessary) you can invite the best courtiers to serve as your advisors/generals. You usually need them to have around 80 points higher opinion of you than of their liege to accept an invite (exact formula in the link I included above), so see how much giving them a gift of 20 gold will improve relations, and if it's enough send the gift and invite them to court.   If you have high diplomacy, and a good chancellor, you'll have advisors with 20+ stats, and generals with 20+ martial, inspiring leader, etc.  High diplomacy rulers turn the game into easy mode. Vassals will like you more and so pay more taxes and contribute more levies, offsetting the advantage of high martial or high stewardship. Other characters will be more likely to join your plots since they like you more, offsetting the advantage of high intrigue. Other rulers will be less likely to go to war with you because they like you more, less likely to answer your enemy's call to arms and more likely to respond to yours.  High diplomacy will also ensure you always win elections under elective monarchy, too.  EDIT: Also, as someone else said, stop making your vassals stronger by giving them more stuff. If you have land to give away, use ""invite holy man to court"" in the intrigue tab, instead of giving land to existing vassals. Never give more than one county to a person. Keep a sizeable warchest (at least 2,000 gold) in your treasure so you can high shitloads of mercenaries in a hurry. Better to fight and crush troublesome vassals than placate them, making them stronger. If you win the civil war, you imprison all the vassals who rebelled, and can either revoke their titles or ransom them for lots of money."

Expanding is a good thing usually, IMO, especially if you use a CB that strips the titles and lets you hand them out to nice, content courtiers. Obviously this doesn't apply to truce-breaking or going way beyond the vassal limit."
CrusaderKings,3dvu30,brightneonmoons,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:23:39 2015 UTC,"Factions aren't built in a day. Try and keep dirt on your vassals so you can imprison them.

If you they evade imprisonment they rebel, alone. Take them down one by one at your own pace. After a rebellion you get a +25 with your vassals, +50 with the guy who rebelled if you ""spare"" him aka white peace him out.  Don't let factions form. Keep your vassals in line.

CrusaderKings,3dwhxz,greatpaperwolf,0,Mon Jul 20 03:18:35 2015 UTC,"You must be right, him not having a proper province must be the problem.   The city doesn't have to be in his de jure duchy.

CrusaderKings,3dwhxz,BestFriendWatermelon,0,Mon Jul 20 03:59:41 2015 UTC,"My best guess is you need to give him the duchy title instead of pressing it. This way it's as if a mayor vassal somehow created a duchy title himself, which I think isn't meant to happen."

CrusaderKings,3duw4h,Fimconte,2,Sun Jul 19 18:37:53 2015 UTC,"I had an easier time by running west to escape the Uyghurs. I went to war with everyone to the west of me, then turned south. By the time I hit Urgench, I was strong enough to break free from the Uyghurs and start the subjugation of Persia. I held off marrying early so I could buy retinue with prestige, but later replaced prestige retinue once I had the money to do so. You'll meet hostility early on, but the Uyghurs themselves probably won't attack you because of your tributary status. So you just need to rush down Khirgiz, Perm, Yugra, or whoever is in the west before they get eaten by Yabguid/Khazars/Uyghurs."
CrusaderKings,3duw4h,cyorir,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:13:19 2015 UTC,"I started by subjugating the Buddhists on the far right, this works since subjugation doesn't need to border your holdings. I then conquested and pillaged my way across Khotan. At the point  you are out of Buddhists you should have conquered enough/built up your yurt enough that you can break the tributary with the uyghurs. Then expand through the mountain pass of khotan or started subordinating the uyghurs.  As for marriage being a tributary works to your advantage, as all manicheans see you as being a part of a manichean realm and not an infidel. So look for marriages among the manichean khans not to the Tengri."
CrusaderKings,3duw4h,aeter777,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:06:55 2015 UTC,"Everyone around you is allied to those Manichaen assholes you pay taxes to, so If you declare war you need to book it to the capital to capture it before you lose your horde in a battle you can't win.  I used my subjugation on the deer-lovers to the West; so long as you keep your stacks around 750 and wipe them out before winter hits you'll be okay.  Once you get out of the corner there are plenty of targets, and once you have a 7k stack or so and manpower in the bank you can take on the Abbasids."

CrusaderKings,3dw8s4,felagund,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:31:58 2015 UTC,"Sometimes in this game, you end up with an heir you might not really like. The game can reward and amuse you for it, just wait until you play a homo or lunatic king.  And unless your heir is really terrible (aka an imbecile) the situation can be salvaged as his skills can be improved with foci over time.  Unless you can change your succession law to something that would suit you better, you have limited options. Remember that the game is about your dynasty not just land grabbing like in say EUIV.   I'm not 100% sure but because of primogeniture you might not even be able to hand out titles to son no 2 and only to other folks. But you will never play him unless (A) your first son dies now or (B) both your son and his heir(s) die after you currently die.  Also you can't abdicate. The easiest way to remove yourself from power is probably to get the depressed trait and then commit suicide. (there's a reading book event for theology iirc that can fail and you can choose to be depressed). Other ways: https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1fqjjf/fastest_way_to_get_your_king_killed/  One more thing, if your grandson is grown up and not inheriting any titles currently you can order him to take the vows to disqualify him from eventual succession."
CrusaderKings,3dw8s4,icecon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:28:56 2015 UTC,"So I am going to assume that you have already changed succession laws or for whatever reason can't change them (the easiest way). I am also going to assume that you are playing ironman/don't want to just load up a game and switch to playing your second son (the second easiest way). And you don't want him dead? Do you have good relations with the Pope, or are you able to set up an anti-pope? You could excom your first son (and kill his kid or otherwise put him out to pasture). I'm not really sure how I would get this done. Personally I would just play as the first son. It's not so bad playing a shitty ruler (Now two, three in a row starts to suck, but one, not so bad). You don't want a revolt, lowers crown authority. You could missionary your first son (make him your chaplian and send him to convert heathens) and hope that your second son becomes regent and role play it that way."
CrusaderKings,3dw8s4,CypressCarter,0,Mon Jul 20 02:50:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm playing ironman, which is the reason I'm asking. So 1) put Son 1's minor son in a temple.

CrusaderKings,3dw8s4,CypressCarter,2,Mon Jul 20 03:03:51 2015 UTC,"I think he has to be a bishop, not sure. And for step 2, yea, if you can't excommunicate him (either through great relations with the pope or an anti-pope) then I think he has to die."

If you can give it it to a kinsman that's the best case scenario because he may at some point make a good doge candidate.  BEWARE HOWEVER, of kinsmen landed in inland provinces.
