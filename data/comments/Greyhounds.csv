Greyhounds,3dxss3,breydons,5,Mon Jul 20 14:12:55 2015 UTC,Ya Fox is the same but the cat loves him - if we're out for a while with the dog the cat will spend just as much time greeting him when we come back as he does greeting us.

Greyhounds,3dyy3z,hugthegoose,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:48:03 2015 UTC,"The ones you're using are better than the ones I use (and came in here to recommend) Paw Tectors by Pedigree Perfection.  From the picture, they look like they are long enough (goes past the dew claw?).  My guess is that if they were causing her real pain or discomfort because of the fit, you would see her limping first, but don't hold me to that.  Make sure they're keeping the heat out (feel on the inside) and double check her pads for any soreness or tenderness."
Greyhounds,3dyy3z,MercuryPDX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:20:19 2015 UTC,"We use Pawz when we need to protect feeties, though normally we use them in the wintertime for salt protection. They are essentially like balloons for the feet and are very thin. Pros: a few minutes after putting them on for the first time, our dog forgot they were there. He refuses to walk in anything that resembles a shoe/boot because it's too thick/bulky. Cons: they break after about a week of use. We apply duct tape to holes make them last longer."
Greyhounds,3dyy3z,littlearson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:23:27 2015 UTC,"We used them too this winter.  One pack survived the whole winter for us, but we keep nails trimmed very short.    I got so sick of putting them on and taking them off twice a day.  I am now dreading winter.  Maybe I'm just lazy."

Greyhounds,3duta2,ByzantineBomb,2,Sun Jul 19 20:23:04 2015 UTC,I don't know how my step son managed it. Perhaps I was holding a treat over his shoulder. I've had her for 8 years now from rescue and in all that time I have never managed to get her to sit that still long enough for me to line up the photos (and he took three!) . Usual problem is her moving her head constantly.

When you visit your parents you will be around significantly more, won't you?  Generally the dogs do fine wherever their people are.    Getting the dog at your parents place, then needing it to adapt to a new environment where s/he is expected to be alone more often might be more problematic, IMO."
Greyhounds,3dqyxh,DannysMom03,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:52:50 2015 UTC,"I don't travel often with my greyhound, but I did just return from a two week vacation at my SO's parents house. I brought along my grey and he did AWESOME. He had no issues what so ever. He also has done well the two times I've visited my mother for a couple days. It really just might depend on the personality of your greyhound.  Edit: Just wanted to add that my greyhound has a super mellow personality (minus his love of food), and I really think that is why he does so well traveling to new places."
Greyhounds,3dqyxh,thecerealdilemma,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:04:12 2015 UTC,"I drive 2 hours to my parents house every few months.  My greyhound  does fine.  She is a bit fussy about the actual travel in the car, but when she arrives she is happy.  I make sure always to bring familiar things for her.  She has the smaller dog bed and familiar smelling blankets with her as well as a few squeaky toys.   My parents have a small non-greyhound and they for the most part don't interact.   The main thing will be that the rest of the ""pack"" aka you, are close by."

We visit my parents and my in-laws with my greyhound, more often than once every two months. He is totally fine with it. The very first night he was at either of those places he was a little nervous/antsy but now all is well. I would get your greyhound in the city you work in, let them get used to your work schedule/life, and after about a month or so you could probably start visiting your parents and be totally okay."

Personally, I'd keep the daily routine the same but increase exercise and mental stimulation (training), especially in the morning. If the anxiety is really bad to severe, I'd be tempted to take the edge off with a little melatonin or pheromone diffuser, a Thundershirt, music and talk radio, lots of food puzzles, Kongs, or food-dispensing toys.   We haven't moved, but we took our greyhound on vacation with us to a new home, with weird and curious sea smells in the air, and we increased the morning exercise a lot and then used that fatigue (and left TV on) to help with our absence in the afternoon."
Greyhounds,3dmp0c,heck_yes,3,Fri Jul 17 14:53:58 2015 UTC,"Spooks come around in their own time.  It could be a couple of months, it could be a couple of years. Positive praise anytime he leaves that 6 foot square, etc are all good things. You may want to try moving their food bowl just a little bit away from their comfort zone.  Just an inch or 2 , slowly moving it further each day to see if that will help with the comfort.   Also, getting a harness for them I've heard does good things as well.  Good luck!"
Greyhounds,3dmp0c,meapet,3,Fri Jul 17 15:21:46 2015 UTC,"Story time! My family had one foster who the vet was considering to euthanize because she was so absolutely terrified of everything that she needed to be carried everywhere she went because she would go up on her claws and refuse to move on any surface. She shook constantly and she needed to be peeled out of the crate by the vet techs. They decided to pick us for foster parents because we had a really big calm hound and my family had success with all of our other fosters. Every morning for like a week my mom would sit at the kitchen table with her tea and read the paper and eventually the little girl decided to come over and put her head in my moms lap. It continued to every day after because we ended up adopting her. She also ended up being in charge of the boys. It takes time, you have to understand the stress of where they came from and what they went through. But they eventually come around, just give him space and let him know its ok."
Greyhounds,3dmp0c,polkaspot36,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:06:46 2015 UTC,"Having another dog (preferably a grey) around for them to emulate can be a positive thing - and then all the focus doesn't have to be on the spook, but they can pretend they are invisible while beginning to participate in things.  Mine lived in my closet for the first few months. Ran to go to the bathroom outside and ran back to the closet. It took time, and a lot of patience and no expectations on my part. My other grey helped show her the ropes."
Greyhounds,3dmp0c,sarcasticwitandsexy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:22:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, everyone! It's good to know spooks are common and that time will heal most of his issues."

I may get a bigger bed and try to convince all 3 to sleep on it with me!"
Greyhounds,3di5in,burntneedle,3,Thu Jul 16 14:29:58 2015 UTC,"I am surprised she took that long to try bed. We have an I.G., an we could not keep him out of bed for 2 minutes.

Greyhounds,3dbmi5,thecerealdilemma,5,Wed Jul 15 00:34:07 2015 UTC,Our first grey figured out how to open the trash can by stepping on the pedal. So we switched trash cans to the one with the locking lid. And then she figured out how to open that by bonking the latch with her chin. Ultimately we sat a cast iron skillet on the lid.   Good luck.
Greyhounds,3dbmi5,geeklantern,3,Wed Jul 15 01:54:56 2015 UTC,Haha we ended up putting a large can of pumpkin pie filling on top of the garbage can so the long nose couldn't open it.

It is right at nose-level for him, but he has never opened it (or if he has, he didn't disturb anything).  I wonder if he's afraid of it because it moved on its own."
Greyhounds,3dbmi5,sixam,4,Thu Jul 16 14:08:52 2015 UTC,That is the most problem solving ability I have heard in a greyhound (outside of procuring comfy bed materials).    Your pup may be on the verge of a greyhound evolutionary leap!
Greyhounds,3dbmi5,windsyofwesleychapel,2,Wed Jul 15 02:56:48 2015 UTC,"For kitchen cabinets you can buy childproofing stuff. It's been ages since I had it, but we had one cabinet for chemicals that could only be opened with a magnet key, and my kid never broke it open. The latches that catch under the cabinet are not that effective.   If the scratching on the bin is constant, I'd remove the whole bin. Dogs will do stuff impulsively when alone although they know they're not supposed to, like countersurfing, so I'd just put the bin somewhere else or put it inside another bin or can."
Greyhounds,3dbmi5,je_taime,2,Wed Jul 15 04:36:09 2015 UTC,"You can try putting a can of pennies on top of the food bin, just in tipping range- so the next time he tries to paw at it, the can of pennies falls and makes a lot of noise.  It should discourage him in the future.  My rescue recommends that for counter surfing too."

Greyhounds,3d55h7,androssfox,7,Mon Jul 13 16:36:35 2015 UTC,"My partner is at wits end with the freezes primarily   This type of freezing or statuing happens a lot with new adopted dogs. I remember when mine did it after the first two or three weeks of not doing it.   But you don't need to get stuck there for hours. You can try to nudge the dog sideways at the shoulder, lead the dog in a circle to get going again, change direction, or do a hop-skip start that someone showed me at the kennel. The hop-skip start requires you to use the dog's collar and go up-forward (never pulling on the throat or dragging the dog sideways), then you break into a run so the dog has to go with you. Then reward for when the dog moves."
Greyhounds,3d55h7,je_taime,3,Mon Jul 13 18:08:36 2015 UTC,"Je_taime is giving good advice.  In a previous post, lots of hound folk mentioned the ability to distract the pup to get them to cooperate, here is my story.   My poor greyhound also would have those same issues of statuing.  It was getting so she would just stop at the drive way with no way to get her moving. Eventually, I discovered a way to get her to cooperate. I distracted her by getting behind and pushing gently on her rump 3 times while saying ""Beep Beep Beep"".  Ok it sounds silly, but she would ""reactivate"" and we could go on our walk.   Also, you both are likely showing some justified frustration with said pup after all this to put up with.  She may be able to pick up on the frustration.  I know mine can, and that would cause her to simply shut down more.   Best of luck, others will likely have better advice to give."
Greyhounds,3d55h7,windsyofwesleychapel,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:03:29 2015 UTC,"The circle is what has always worked for me.  Think about how they load horses into the starting gate before a race: sometimes the horse bucks and the handler does a little loop before trying again.  I've found that if he doesn't want to go forward, he usually wants to go the other way for some reason (maybe he thinks we should be ""done"" and heading home).  After a few steps, I turn him around in an arc and try to get him going the right way.   Sometimes it works; sometimes it takes a few tries."
Greyhounds,3d55h7,sixam,2,Tue Jul 14 14:30:42 2015 UTC,"If I'm reading it correctly, she is more attached to you than your partner. It would probably help to get the greyhound more attached to your partner, bribery with delicious treats (i.e. raw meat or slivers of cheese) worked well for us (My wife goes to university, while I stay home as a telecommuter, our greyhound was initially more attached to my wife, so to help her become more attached to me - to place more of her expectations on me - I would give her little treats, ordinary dog treats don't cut it, it's got to be meat or cheese).  In terms of doing business I think routine helps a lot. Now our greyhound is happy doing her business anywhere anytime (which came with an increasing sense of owning the place ;)), but when we first moved to this city, she didn't want to do her business on unfamiliar routes, also walking her at a different time of day could disrupt her from doing her business properly. A clockwork routine seems to benefit greyhounds a lot - at least until they are settled in.  The pooing and peeing in her crate is actually straightforward enough to explain - it's about scent marking, she is afraid of 'marking' other dogs territories, and only feels safe doing her business in what is definitely her own territory - her crate - so you need to establish a route outside which is ""her"" territory for peeing and pooing in.  Our greyhound normally only freezes when she sees a cat, or sometimes when she knows we are going back into the apartment and feels her walk wasn't long enough. When she gets stuck on a cat, we perform a ""greyhound reset"" by cuddling her head (so she can't see) and turning her around while rubbing her. This seems to distract her sufficiently to normally resume walking. When she doesn't want to come inside, a gentle pat on the butt sometimes helps, and cuddling her always helps. (but we try and make sure she is genuinely satisfied with her time outside)  And I think greyhounds benefit a lot from being constantly praised. Praise them when they're doing the wrong thing, praise them even more when they're doing the right thing. i.e. the moment she starts walking you should praise her for being a good dog. (An example of praising the dog for doing even the wrong thing - when she pooed on the floor right in front of me I praised her mildly, because she didn't poo on something hard to clean and didn't try to conceal it, I believe that was actually the last time she pooed inside - psychology can be funny like that, take away the guilt, take away the pressure, and the problem disappears too; it even makes sense that it'll help if the dog doesn't feel guilty about doing a poo in front of you, as that's what she has to do when on a lead).  My wife likes to say you should always praise a dog when they're doing nothing special, if they're just trotting along beside you, praise them! You should give your dog affection if she is being anxious because reassurance - love and understanding - is so important for overcoming anxiety, but if she receives affection primarily when she is being anxious it can set up the wrong idea, hence it is important the dog is rewarded with lots of affection just for acting normally.  The main point is not really to condition the dog to do what you want, but rather to make sure the dog knows you love her unconditionally. You could say that affection is a lubricant and frustration is grit, the more the dog trusts you (and your partner) to love her no matter what, the easier it will be to work with her. I really liked one place where I read that training a dog is not so much about getting it to do what you want, but establishing communication. Greyhounds are such sensitive dogs, I like to say they have small brains and big hearts, they do want to please you, and the better you can communicate emotionally with her, the easier it will be to get along with her."
Greyhounds,3d55h7,Bliejk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:07:02 2015 UTC,Is your hound food motivated? What about bringing some kibbles of her food or little pieces of treats on your walk to help coax her?
Greyhounds,3d55h7,ifelloffmyunicorn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:22:26 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if it's related or not but one of my greyhounds does this. We found out that he doesn't like the feeling of walking on the cement sidewalk so we got him nylon and rubber booties and now he loves going on walks and will basically run around the block.
Greyhounds,3d55h7,polkaspot36,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:00:29 2015 UTC,"Using food has definitely helped for stairs, although she seems to respond more when I do it rather than my partner :p.  Booties is definitely an idea although I'm unsure as she walked fine elsewhere...perhaps this specific area just ""feels"" different for her.  I'll definitely try that hop move, sometimes circles did work or the shoulder nudge but she seems to listen more to me than my partner in that regard.  I could also see the frustration being an issue..I'm not too bothered by it but when my partner has to wake up at 6 am with me she's certainly not in the mood for statues haha. I'll try some of these suggestions tonight! Thanks everyone."
Greyhounds,3d55h7,hugthegoose,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:11:24 2015 UTC,"You just described our first 2-3 months of walks with our grey. The freezing is normal. They are learning how to be a pet and learning how to walk on a leash. It is definitely infuriating but they eventually grow/learn out of the habits.  Lots of good tips posted so far, but these are things that worked for us when we were training Lucy: -Early on teach them out of pulling on the leash (teach him/her to walk on a slacked leash). Once we were able to teach this to Lucy, she realized that we dictated the walks, not her. We were able to teach her this with a Freedom No-Pull Harness  -Get a Harness: you can provide more encouragement via the leash this method without hurting the dog (as opposed to pulling by the neck). Take note, I'm not saying to pull the dog by the harness, just that you can apply more pressure in a certain direction without fear of hurting the dog.  -let them freeze for a few minutes and just stand there and don't pay any attention to them, eventually they get bored staring at whatever they are staring at and come your direction  -Go the direction your dog wants but immediately come around full circle so you are facing the direction you want to go. This is something I wouldn't do later on once you've taught your dog that you dictate the walk.  -download the sound of a squeaky toy on your phone (or youtube it). This got us out of a few jams early on, but she quickly realized it was the phone.  -Last but not least, you can attempt walking when your partner is at home (or vice versa) and call the other one to come pick you up via car. I would use this as a last resort (ie: you need to get back home to do something/go somewhere, otherwise neither you or the dog will learn to do a proper walk)  Even now and then, we still have to carry Lucy the last 10-20 yards to the house (as she has realized the walk is about to end).  TLDR: It'll take time (months even) but it will be worth it in the end."

Greyhounds,3d3to3,an-awesome-opossum,2,Mon Jul 13 11:39:25 2015 UTC,I would say it's unlikely a greyhound will share his/her bed with another dog.  Both ours are bed possessive to say the least.  Our Greyhounds love round beds that have a doughnut shape.  They love to curl their bodies around inside the thick outer ring.  I never would have guessed they would like this shape but we had a rather large doughnut shaped cat bed that one of them fell in love with.  Now we have 4 of them.  Guessing they are about 32 inches in diameter.
Greyhounds,3d3to3,scottylike,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:07:00 2015 UTC,"I was not figuring on the hound sharing, but the two dogs I have now are both about 40lbs and would both fit on the larger bed (they would probably both fit on the small one considering I've seen Dingo curl up on a tiny throw pillow from IKEA).  I know how important a soft bed is to a bony grey and didn't know if they were as willing to squish onto a small one as my current dogs.

Greyhounds,3d3to3,mnkybrs,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:19:11 2015 UTC,"I'll second Elaine's.  We have 4 in the house and they are the best beds out there.  They are filled with chopped up memory foam, and have a very sturdy fabric (you can choose type/color/pattern) on the outside.  The best part is you can wash all the parts of the bed in your washer (get some lingerie bags for the foam squares and then air dry them)  The Large is 80-something and hte XL is 100, but my girls adore them.  I have costco beds as well, and they are hit or miss on which ones they like laying on.  In my car I have beds from Homegoods because they're cheap, and if they get messed up I can replace them quickly and easily.    For an older dog though, I'd go with Elaines just because they're very comfy.  I really want one for a camping bed!"

He nits us when he wants to play or is happy- basically he nibbles on our arm or hand with his front teeth. He loves to cuddle. Thing is, he is really lazy. He only wants to play a few times a day and stops after a short while. He's not high energy unless he wants to be and that's like 15-20 minutes a day. He is always willing to go for a walk or outside(he has only refused to go out when it was seriously pouring rain out) but he's content laying on the big comfy bed we have for him too. He absolutely loves other dogs and new people (and by new I mean someone he hasn't seen in like, 5 minutes, so that us us too when we go to the bathroom).  They're all different, and we just found one that fit our personality and lifestyle.

Greyhounds,3ctwf7,Matilda__Wormwood,2,Fri Jul 10 19:09:30 2015 UTC,I may be the weird one here but we do have sunscreen for our grey. Background: She is mostly white with black spots and a VERY thin coat with scars from the track (her belly and behind still has little to no hair). We only put it on her if we are going out for a walk (or run) that is longer than just a pee break. She has gotten burned after a short time out. I put it on for our local meet and greets. We don't use it often but we have it on hand if there is any question of how long we will be out.
Greyhounds,3ctwf7,Woz_Corp,2,Sat Jul 11 20:05:21 2015 UTC,"Hmmm good to know. He has a very thin coat too and is completely bare on his belly/underside, with lots of scars on his backside. What kind do you use?"

Sometimes, she goes through bad fazes so I put a cow hoof (which she won't eat) in the bowl with her kibble to give her something to have to eat around (tennis balls work too, apparently).  As far as your dental concerns go: get some soup/marrow bones from your local grocery store. The're only about $0.30/pound and I can usually make one bone last 4-5 1 hour chew fest sessions. They're amazing for keeping her teeth clean. One big caveat though: make sure you buy bones that look like this NOT one that have been cut into smaller sections like this . The smaller sections can get caught on your pup's lower jaw as they dig for marrow and would require a very unpleasant vet visit to get off!"
Greyhounds,3ctqpg,ifelloffmyunicorn,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:03:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the photos!! When do you throw the bone out and how often do you give it to your dog? My dog's teeth aren't good at all (similar to OP).   I had once bought one of the smaller bones and yep, it got stuck on the bottom jaw. I had to come home early from work one day because my husband was certain that our hound would bite him. He held her head and I got the bone off the jaw and threw it away. Never bought anything like it since and that was 3 years ago."
Greyhounds,3ctqpg,Naraven,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:33:58 2015 UTC,"I usually throw it out when I notice that she's getting frustrated because she can't reach any more of the marrow (as mentioned before after about 4-5 times of letting her chew on it for 30min-1hr depending how energetic she is that day). I'm guessing it will be different for different dogs. My girl usually goes after the meat on the outside first, then the marrow, so I don't have to worry too much the first 2 times I let her have at it. I always keep an eye on her and if she seems to really be getting her jaw into the bone or cracking things then I throw it out. I just refrigerate the bone between uses.   Remember not to cook or boil the bone as that will make it more brittle! The little bit of raw meat on the bone won't harm your grey.  Edit: Also, if your store doesn't seem to sell the safer version of the bone, just ask the butcher behind the counter! The usually cut it in-store with their own bone saw, so they'll usually give you an un-cut one if you ask :)"
Greyhounds,3ctqpg,sixam,2,Mon Jul 13 22:31:50 2015 UTC,We have the spiral bowl.  It slows him down quite a bit.  He went from eating 2 cups in about 30 seconds to taking a few minutes.  I have no idea if it's better for him at all.  I doubt he's chewing much either way.  I like it because he can't finish his food before I can get my own from the kitchen and sit down back down.
Greyhounds,3ctqpg,polkaspot36,2,Fri Jul 10 19:47:45 2015 UTC,"I had a little female that did the same thing. Like someone else suggested, water in the food helps. What we did for my girl was put a mug in the middle of the bowl so she had to eat around it. It slowed her down and we didn't have to buy a fancy bowl."
Greyhounds,3ctqpg,bumchuff,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:21:27 2015 UTC,"There really isn't a problem with eating so fast. The problems generally come with choking. Get a bucket and turn it upside down. The raised section of what was the base of the bucket is much the same as a dog dinner bowl. Cut to suit and stand the bowl in it. Now his/ her dinner is 12"" off the floor.  It won't stop your hound gulping his/her food down but it will stop him/her choking.  TIL, I need to refer to dogs as dogs, not boys and girls."

Greyhounds,3ctjuv,Titular_Character,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:24:19 2015 UTC,"Yep. Probably ""happy tail,"" or maybe a really bad fracture.  We've had maybe 3-4 fosters develop ""happy tail,"" including our current one. It's particularly bad with greyhounds versus other breeds because of the length of the tail, and how almost nothing sticks to greyhound fur. Some people will bandage the tip, but if the bandage doesn't ""breathe,"" it invites the chance for infection. Plus, it'll probably come off. Some people bandage the tip, then wrap it along the entire length with adhesive tape. It ends up being more of a Chinese finger trap than anything else.  Another option is to get some of the C-shaped pipe foam insulation, or a ""pool noodle,"" and  tape that to the end of the tail.  We've never had a foster end up with an amputation, fortunately."
Greyhounds,3ctjuv,drugczarbad,3,Sat Jul 11 06:52:46 2015 UTC,"Tail cropping in racers is not common practice. It helps keep their balance (see cheetahs) at top speed.

Greyhounds,3cnlzj,rillrillrill,15,Thu Jul 9 08:29:06 2015 UTC,"I have 2 greyhounds and they both went swimming for the first time in their lives this past week when we were on vacation.  It was actually quite hilarious to watch them.  The first dog learned quickly that the farther you go out the deeper it gets.  Apparently he thought he could walk all the way out to the middle of the lake and suddenly found himself under water.  His solution was to jump off the bottom back to the surface then jump again until he was back in shallow water.  He emerged looking quite embarrassed but OK.  Later, while wading around he decided he was going to sniff the lake bottom and submerged his entire head underwater.  The look on his face when he realized his mistake was priceless.  I wish I had it all on video.  Our other greyhound is much smarter and didn't make a fool out of himself but did go swimming just the same.  Both of them swam out to ""rescue"" us which was surprising and a testament to their loyalty.  Their front legs are so long that they can scrape the hell out of you before you can push them away, as I found out.  They aren't great swimmers though as they sit very low in the water, kind of like a submarine.  I'm guessing it's because of their low body fat, (which doesn't give much flotation), and their dense muscle mass, (which causes them to sink)."
Greyhounds,3cnlzj,an-awesome-opossum,3,Thu Jul 9 12:48:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you for sharing that, definitely giggled aloud at trying to sniff while in the water."

Not entirely sure if she can actually swim though...  All greyhounds must be muzzled by law where I live, despite Issy being incredibly friendly and sweet. Shows no dog aggression at all and tends to scare off people until they meet her."
Greyhounds,3cnlzj,sharjila,5,Thu Jul 9 08:31:48 2015 UTC,Can I ask whereabouts you live that you have to have her muzzled? Do you know the reason behind it?
Greyhounds,3cnlzj,joeyscheidrolltide,6,Thu Jul 9 08:36:00 2015 UTC,"Tasmania. Greyhounds technically fall under the dangerous dog umbrella, which became state law sometime in the 1920s. No one has been bothered to change it since, although hopefully it will be revoked in the near future :) These dogs are also meant to be on lead at all times in public, but I largely ignore that in enclosed spaces.  There's a greenhound program interstate (VIC, maybe NSW) where approved hounds don't have to wear a muzzle. Issy has pre-emptively passed so will go muzzle free once the law changes."

Greyhounds,3cnlzj,je_taime,4,Thu Jul 9 12:47:23 2015 UTC,I think part of it is they are trained to chase a small 'animal' if it runs. So maybe it's so they couldn't chase and kill a squirrel or small cat (though I've never heard of one hurting a cat)
Greyhounds,3cnlzj,jschwe,2,Thu Jul 9 19:13:13 2015 UTC,"Oh, Issy would definitely have a go at cats but so do many other breeds if dogs. Quite a few other breeds are also fast enough to catch cats! So a little antiquated imo"
Greyhounds,3cnlzj,TheNewEnnui,2,Thu Jul 9 22:00:28 2015 UTC,"Did/do they race greys in Tasmania?

It took him a bit to figure out how it worked, though...he really just wants to wade in and lie down, and kept being surprised when his head went underwater. He also has once or twice run himself out past where he can touch, which he pretty quickly learned to avoid. He's not a great swimmer. Greyhounds aren't really shaped for it, he sits super low in the water and his body wants to float sideways. When he has to swim he ends up doing an awkward, snuffly zig-zag dog paddle, where he keeps trying to turn to keep his ears out of the water (but getting one out means the other goes in). He has a very shallow wading pool at our house, which is his favourite kind of water. Also it comes with a pillow!"
Greyhounds,3cnlzj,Postal_Dude1126,2,Thu Jul 9 14:11:16 2015 UTC,"Very cute...I was also surprised at my grey's love of the ocean.       When I took her to the beach, I had pretty low expectations.  My grey hates the bath (you should see the look of betrayal she gives me and how she stands in the tub martyring herself).  She also hates the sprinklers (tried to cool her off a few times while in the park -- see above mentioned betrayal face/passive body). However, she was in heaven when we took her to the beach.   She ran to the water, played, lay down in the water.  We were shocked!"
Greyhounds,3cnlzj,Coji5gt,4,Thu Jul 9 20:48:17 2015 UTC,"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE monitor 'swimming' greys closely. Greyhounds are NOT good swimmers, based partially on their low body fat along with their body types. It's really important. Perhaps consider a lifejacket if this is something you'd like to do regularly with your grey. The LAST thing you want to do is put him at risk of drowning from exhaustion or panic.

Greyhounds,3cmeap,foxlizard,2,Thu Jul 9 13:50:37 2015 UTC,"That was something that I was concerned about as well.  It's really luck of the draw if you'll end up with an active one or a lazy one.  I think he's high on the active side.  He's 5 years old.  The farthest we've gone is around 5-6 miles last year in the woods, with a lot of hills.  I was quite impressed by his stamina.  Sometimes when we get back to the car after a shorter hike, he doesn't want to jump in right away.    The biggest factor seems to be the heat.  Living in Maryland, we actually get all 4 seasons, so during the Spring and Fall he's fine.  In the Summer, even his normal walks have got to be early morning and late evening or he's slow and panting.  Once the summer heat dies down, I'm going to try to take him on a backpacking trip.  First I need to see how he feels about sleeping in my 2-person tent with me."

Greyhounds,3cmeap,Assumer,3,Thu Jul 9 18:16:37 2015 UTC,"I understand completely.  What ended up swaying me to the greyhound side over a more traditionally active breed was the ratio of active days to lazy days.  If I got a mutt or some type of herding dog that was full of energy, that would be awesome for the 40-60ish days a year I can spend outdoors.  During the other 300+ days when I'm working and we're not having fun, he would be bored and that didn't seem fair.    So my greyhound turned out to be the perfect dog during my working life and still a pretty damn good outdoors companion."
Greyhounds,3cmeap,foxlizard,2,Thu Jul 9 20:16:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's part of my issue too - I don't want an energetic, lively dog who will be sad without activity and stimulation all day while I'm at work.

He handled Quandary Peak, Mt. Audobon and Arapaho glacier just fine, though I wouldn't take him on anything more difficult than those. Love of marmots and insatiable thirst are the two biggest difficulties. He has a hard time finding a comfy place to rest at the top of many hikes since they are so rocky, and there's a limit to how much padding can be carried. A large sweatshirt seems to help."

I just did Quandary, Democrat, Cameron, Lincoln, Bross, and Bierstadt last weekend and Quandary was tough - just a steady uphill for...ever. (And I forgot my inhaler) But I can see how the prey drive could be tricky out in the wilderness."
Greyhounds,3cmuqm,Coji5gt,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:24:10 2015 UTC,"Wish Doodad was this excited to ride.  We're still working on her car skills.  Also, is that a Golf/GTI?  Nice choice!  We have a GTI which shuttles our girl around fairly well.  Nice hound!"
Greyhounds,3cmuqm,interpolactic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:27:21 2015 UTC,"Indeed it is a Golf. TDI. Most of the time I put her in the hatch with the rear seats still up. When she's in the front and moving, she gets a bit unstable until she lays down. Obviously loads of fear-shedding hair until she finds her spot. She will also put her entire head between the door and seat, or rest her about on the door handle, pretty odd, but probably because of her awkwardness."
Greyhounds,3ckdt6,butimnotfrommars,4,Wed Jul 8 16:23:17 2015 UTC,Where Did You Get These!!!!!
Greyhounds,3ckdt6,the_doughboy,4,Wed Jul 8 20:27:58 2015 UTC,http://www.nonudehounds.com and they are having a 40% off sale!
Greyhounds,3ckdt6,wombat_thief,3,Wed Jul 8 20:54:21 2015 UTC,Do you have a link for where you got them? Was thinking about getting some for my grey. Thanks!
Greyhounds,3ckdt6,windsyofwesleychapel,3,Wed Jul 8 18:15:30 2015 UTC,http://www.nonudehounds.com :)
Greyhounds,3ckdt6,WIlf_Brim,3,Wed Jul 8 20:55:12 2015 UTC,Hmm pup doesn't seem to think new winter pajamas are the best idea for summer.  I love the greyhound look of impatience!
Greyhounds,3ckdt6,windsyofwesleychapel,3,Wed Jul 8 20:19:20 2015 UTC,"Yea, I was thinking the same thing.    ""Nice going, hoomin.  It's 95 degrees outside, and you put me in fleece."""
Greyhounds,3ckdt6,7minegg,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:55:47 2015 UTC,We ordered them now because they are having a summer sale
Greyhounds,3cl6l9,redthat2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:40:59 2015 UTC,Oh for shame!  Cover up Ron!  This isn't the French Riviera ;)
Greyhounds,3ckp8b,fourbelts,3,Wed Jul 8 17:43:07 2015 UTC,My iggie does that on top of the other iggie. We figured it was a comfort thing to rest his dick on another dog
Greyhounds,3ckp8b,stonepimpletilists,3,Wed Jul 8 18:26:38 2015 UTC,Someone pick that chicken up and put it in the fridge before it spoils.
Greyhounds,3ckp8b,7minegg,3,Wed Jul 8 23:47:41 2015 UTC,"Please give us more pictures! As a huge fan of greyhounds and salukis, this has got to be the most beautiful dog."
Greyhounds,3ckp8b,Kashna,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:22:04 2015 UTC,This is our beautiful girl on a hike. We've only had her a month and she is shy of people and dogs. We're trying our best to get her more socialized but at 3 years old it might be a little late. She is learning for the first time in her life how to run (funny five minutes!) Swim and even how to walk normally on a lead. She is so affectionate and funny once she gets used to you and loves to play and do the classic grey couch potato impression!
Greyhounds,3ckp8b,Kashna,2,Thu Jul 9 09:24:46 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/6CmxpJ9 forgot the pic!
Greyhounds,3ckp8b,rillrillrill,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:25:02 2015 UTC,"Aww, what a sweet looking dog! Good luck with showing her how to enjoy herself. Thanks for posting the other picture!"
Greyhounds,3ckp8b,carmichael561,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:52:37 2015 UTC,My cairn terrier does that too!
Greyhounds,3cn0oq,lexyjane,3,Thu Jul 9 04:19:03 2015 UTC,"What food is he on? Greys are notorious for having bad stomachs. The only food that makes my guys poops not runny is natural balance chicken and sweet potato. It's very common for dogs to have grain allergies. Also look at his poops and see if there are any visible parasites. It is also common for dogs off the track to have hookworms.  As for the foot, bandage it and put a sock or a bootie over the paw. It'll help keep it protected and stop him from licking if he is."
Greyhounds,3cn0oq,polkaspot36,6,Thu Jul 9 04:31:35 2015 UTC,Also it's ok don't panic. These are all normal bumps in the road for a dog owner. You should be able to consult with the rescue group you got him from and with the vet associated with that group.
Greyhounds,3cn0oq,polkaspot36,6,Thu Jul 9 04:33:48 2015 UTC,Welcome to the club of trying to figure out what to feed your grey for the next few years!
Greyhounds,3cn0oq,cerebral_mindset,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:52:34 2015 UTC,And once you get a second one (or more); trying to find one they both/all can eat!
Greyhounds,3cn0oq,Postal_Dude1126,2,Fri Jul 10 03:36:40 2015 UTC,"Our Boston sometimes gets stuck with a course of the runny poos.  We boil chicken and make a big batch of white rice, and feed him only that until things start to firm up again.  We then start introing his regular food back into his diet and add canned pumpkin for some extra fiber."
Greyhounds,3cn0oq,chelc,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:59:53 2015 UTC,"On top of that he cut the pad of one of his back feet today and it's bleeding a good bit. We're trying to keep him off of it, but he's been frequently asking to go out and opening it back up. So what do we do? Any good advice? Or do we need a professional?   If he keeps going out and opening his wound, you either keep him from going by scheduling potty breaks, keeping him on leash, and limiting his walking, or tell the vet and ask them to bandage.   At this point, you probably should take him in for both issues. If he's opened his wound several times, you may need a vet tech to clean the wound thoroughly unless you have the right disinfectant at home and feel fine doing the bandaging yourself and changing the dressing every day."
Greyhounds,3cn0oq,je_taime,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:04:42 2015 UTC,"Don't worry too much about the runny poops -- it takes a while to figure out what to feed them.  Ours do best on http://www.kirklandsignaturepetsupplies.com/natures-domain-brand, the beef and sweet potato (yellow bag) along with some some cooked chicken or turkey burgers.  We tried all really expensive kibbles but I think they were too rich..."
Greyhounds,3cn0oq,kometes,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:00:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think holding back his food ration is a good idea at all.  The amount of food he eats has nothing to do with the loose stool problem.  Give him his full amount.  One of my greyhounds is a nervous Nelly and gets loose stools whenever he is under stress.  Once the stress is gone, everything goes back to normal.  Your dog is still in a new environment so it could be the same issue with him.  I wouldn't worry too much about it, but do ask your vet when you bring him in for his first check-up; bring a stool sample.  As for the cut, I would buy a set of winter booties and put one on the injured foot.  The sets we have are like a little baby sock that is dipped in rubber.  They stay on and really do protect their feet in winter so I'm guessing it may work for cuts too."
Greyhounds,3cn0oq,an-awesome-opossum,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:04:22 2015 UTC,"Feeding a lower volume of food (a supposedly high calorie food with a smaller listed serving size) was the only thing that worked for my grey.*  The problem was, he started losing weight.  As soon as I increased the serving size, the loose stool came back.  I also heard the exact same story from another adopter in my group.  She described it as ""accidentally starving him.""  *Until I discovered the magic carrots (making another post about this)."
Greyhounds,3cn0oq,sixam,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:16:21 2015 UTC,"It could still be adjustment/nerves.  Two weeks isn't that long, but as /u/cerebral_mindset said, this could take a long time to sort out.  Over the course of our first year, we tried everything:    Limited ingredient food Fancy food (Expensive shit you've never heard of that only 1 store in town sold) Cheap food (IAM's Green Bag) Prescription food Pumpkin Deworming Probiotics Prescription probiotics   Nothing worked, except feeding less, which caused him to lose weight.  And then we found THE CARROTS.    Owelo Carrots worked from day 1.  You put 1 tablespoon in hot tap water for 10 minutes to reconstitute them.  Pour the whole thing over their food.  Boom.  Good poops.    For the foot, you need Styptic powder.  You put a pinch of this on it and the blood flow will stop.  This is also useful when trimming nails.  Then wrap it up, as others have suggested.  I'd also recommend stocking your doggie first aid kit with some VetWrap and QuickClot (for really big cuts/scratches)."
Greyhounds,3cn0oq,sixam,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:27:11 2015 UTC,Our grey has always had the runny poop issue.  A nice scoop of canned pumpkin with his meal does wonders for him.
Greyhounds,3cig7g,dr_gonzo99,2,Wed Jul 8 04:00:46 2015 UTC,The people must know! How many goodies did you get for cuddling with that toy!  To be honest though that earns a 1k tummy rubs.
