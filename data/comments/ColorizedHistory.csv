ColorizedHistory,3e2yve,mhaserodt,5,Tue Jul 21 16:37:12 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to find something for you, but not coming up with much.  The photo is by Ben Shahn, who took a number of photos along Route 40 and in Ohio in 1938.  It also appears some of the photos are mislabeled. This one, for example, is noted as being route 40, but is actually US 23 (now n. Court st.) in Circleville, Ohio.   That being said it looks like most of Shahn's photos from Ohio on that trip focused on Columbus, Circleville, Marysville, and Lancaster.    Of those towns, Route 40 only passes through Columbus.  There are, to a lesser extent, photos from other towns on Route 40, so it could have been anywhere between towns or maybe not even on Route 40 at all.  If you know your grandfather lived in central Ohio in '38 it might help to narrow it down."

ColorizedHistory,3daf8e,radonchong,5,Wed Jul 15 17:13:20 2015 UTC,"For those interested in the area and its history, the LS Ranch is well documented:   LS RANCH. The nucleus of the LS Ranch was formed in December 1880 when Lucien Scott, a Leavenworth, Kansas, banker, purchased approximately 35,000 acres in Oldham and Hartley counties in the Texas Panhandle. Although the initials LS originally signified only Scott, their meaning was altered in early 1882 to reflect a new partnership, the Lee-Scott Cattle Company, formed when William McDole Lee joined the enterprise. Lee also owned half interest in an adjoining Panhandle ranch, the LE. By 1883 the LS had nearly doubled its size by absorbing Lee's share of the LE, the nearby Ellsworth Torrey spread, Hispanic plazas, and several original land patents. The LS Ranch headquarters was on Alamocitas Creek until 1886, when it was moved to the Alamosa as a result of an exchange of lands with the XIT Ranch. Satellite ranches existed on a range near the Yellowstone River in Montana from 1883 to 1888 and on several hundred acres adjacent to the Canadian River in New Mexico. Scott also organized stock farms near his residence at Leavenworth, Kansas. Scott's operation, Ridgewood, bred purebred Herefords; Lee's farm exclusively pastured Aberdeen-Angus. In 1881 Lee imported thirty-nine head of Angus, the first of the breed to be pastured west of the Mississippi. Lee was a charter member of the American Angus Association; Scott was an early member of the American Hereford Association.  Lee and Scott maintained their partnership until the fall of 1891, when Lee sold out to Scott. Scott and his wife, Julia, were the principal managers of the LS Ranch until Scott's death in 1893, when Scott's brother-in-law, Charles Whitman, assumed control. On Whitman's death in 1899, his wife, Pauline, and her brother, Will Lingenbrink, continued management of the operation. A new partnership was joined in 1902, when Pauline married Frederick H. Kreismann of St. Louis, Missouri. A division of the ranch came in 1904 when the Landergin brothers leased (with an option to buy) the western half of the business. In 1905 they bought their leased half, and Swift and Company acquired the remainder. In the 1980s divisions of the ranch were controlled by the Ware family of Amarillo, who still used the LS brand, the Quien Sabe Ranch of Lubbock, and the XL organization of Amarillo. LS cowpunchers were active participants in the Cowboy Strike of 1883. The LS subsequently employed Patrick F. Garrettqv to organize the LS Rangers, a vigilante posse, to patrol the Panhandle during the annual round-up. Four LS cowboys were killed during a gunfight in 1886 in Tascosa over issues that related to the earlier strike. Also during this decade the north Panhandle drift fenceqv was built (1881–82), and the cattle trail from the Panhandle to Montana was begun (1883).   You might recognize that name in the last paragraph: Patrick F. Garrett. He (supposedly?) shot Billy The Kid."

I couldn't really find any wool shirts that were woven blue; grey, sure, but never with a tint of blue, so I went with an overbearing amount of brown, out of necessity. :)"
ColorizedHistory,3cy3yz,Netprincess,2,Sun Jul 12 21:37:35 2015 UTC,"It was scattered references in Roughing It which I read about 20 years ago but which really stuck in my mind. Maybe because I never saw any blue woolen shirts in any Hollywood cowboy movies but Twain was, after all, there in person.  A quick google search turned up this  ''It was the end of August, and the skies were cloudless and the weather superb. In two or three weeks I had grown wonderfully fascinated with the curious new country and concluded to put off my return to ""the States"" awhile. I had grown well accustomed to wearing a damaged slouch hat, blue woolen shirt, and pants crammed into boot-tops, and gloried in the absence of coat, vest and braces. I felt rowdyish and ""bully...""  (Chap. 22)   ""But they were rough in those times! They fairly reveled in gold, whisky, fights, and fandangoes, and were unspeakably happy. The honest miner raked from a hundred to a thousand dollars out of his claim a day, and what with the gambling dens and the other entertainments, he hadn't a cent the next morning, if he had any sort of luck. They cooked their own bacon and beans, sewed on their own buttons, washed their own shirts—blue woolen ones; and if a man wanted a fight on his hands without any annoying delay, all he had to do was to appear in public in a white shirt or a stove-pipe hat, and he would be accommodated.""  ""By the door of the station keeper's den, outside, was a tin wash basin on the ground. Near it was a pail of water and a piece of yellow bar soap, and from the eaves hung a hoary blue woolen shirt...""  This next one doesn't say 'blue' but it was woolen:  ""Next we hunted up our boots from odd nooks among the mail-bags where they had settled, and put them on. Then we got down our coats, vests, pantaloons and heavy woolen shirts, from the arm-loops where they had been swinging all day, and clothed ourselves in them—for, there being no ladies either at the stations or in the coach, and the weather being hot, we had looked to our comfort by stripping to our underclothing,...""

Lee.   Photograph was taken in New Orleans as evident from the back of the photograph, meaning this is more or less taken around 1865-70, with 1870 being the most realistic date.   Short Summary of Longstreet:  James Longstreet was born in Edgefield District, South Carolina, the 3rd son of James Longstreet and Mary Ann Dent. He attended United States Military Academy and after graduating became a second lieutenant in the 4th US Infantry. His first two years of service were spent at Jefferson Barracks. He was wounded in the Mexican American war at the battle of Chapultepec.  Longstreet resigned from the US army in 1861 to join as a lieutenant in the Confederate Army. President Jefferson Davis met with Longstreet to appoint him with the rank of brigadier general. Longstreet was then given command of 3 Virginia regiments under brigadier general P.G.T. Beauregard at Manassas.  Longstreet became known for his execution of defensive strategies and tactics. He was also known as General E. Lee’s confidante, who affectionately called Longstreet “His War Horse”."

I'm much younger but I have a lot more grey in my hair, about the same grey in my beard, and more wrinkles in my forehead and around my eyes. How is this possible?

She is best known for her mysteries, a series of novels and short stories set between the First and Second World Wars that feature English aristocrat and amateur sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey, that remain popular to this day. However, Sayers herself considered her translation of Dante's Divine Comedy to be her best work. She is also known for her plays, literary criticism and essays.  Original  I was struck by the...

You didn't fall into the old timey sepia bullshit that a lot colorists tragically go for. Your colorization transports me to that time and place in a way that feels immediate and real. It's like I could reach out and grab one of those sodas.

Whilst I realise that the photo is quite mundane to most people, it represented a huge technical challenge. Multiple light sources - daylight, camera flash, exterior - as well as shiny surfaces makes for some interesting practice for reflections and transparent materials.  Couple that with then adjusting the global hues to match the Kodachrome reference shots, and it becomes complicated.  I've attached some references from my research - it took a while to find enough of the elements from the genuine article to make sure it was authentic.  Thanks again."

ColorizedHistory,39kzvc,msthe_student,22,Fri Jun 12 15:36:39 2015 UTC,Most likely tugs. I was on a beach master's unit. When we would land with the Marines sometimes it would take hours for the landing. Tide would go out. If we could... we would use a few bull dozers to push off the landing craft or lash up on the aft of the craft to another floating nearby. Amphibious assaults are fucking cool.

ColorizedHistory,39kzvc,MGJon,12,Fri Jun 12 19:06:38 2015 UTC,"The ship in the photo is an LSD.  The craft unloading the Humvee's is called an LCU. LSD means DOCK LANDING SHIP and LCU means Landing craft unit.  The LSD had a deep draft so it needs to stay out... and we unload the lcu's (i think it's 5 miles out) and come in tactically.  The lcu's are flat bottomed witht he screws on the back end semi protected by the bottom of the craft.  The army has some lcu 2000s that are MUCH bigger than the ones I posted, and frankly i'm not exactly sure how they bring those bad boys in.  the door on the front of the LCU is really heavy... providing an anchor for the LCU when it comes in so they technically don't have to touch bottom on the whole craft, and still stay stationary to complete the landing."

After about five minutes of listening to this giant computer setup dial phone numbers and make fax machine noises, we got a sort of old fashioned website looking thing with statistics about Nigeria.  I fucking swore that it was stupid, and this internet bullshit would never catch on.  ""IT'll never be a thing!""

The efficiency will absolutely help against a big asteroid, even moreso than the giant dumb pieces of metal from the 60s. Nowdays we can track an ELE asteroid from hundreds of millions of miles away, and could send a small satellite up that could track the asteroid in real time and make thrust adjustments to allow its trajectory to meet up with the asteroid, then latch onto it's surface and propel ions to slightly alter the vector of the asteroid, which being millions of miles out is enough to have it miss the inner solar system entirely. All with minimal if ANY human input from earth.  Back then we made the technology just to show we can. Now we made the technology so useful, efficient, and cheap that it can be used for consumer products."

I believe they were gonna use this on Orion but I'm not sure.   The Space Shuttle is the perfect example of a ""do it to show we could"" mentality.

October 1908 by Lewis Hine, Morgantown, West Virginia, USA  Caption reads, ”Lunch Time, Economy Glass Works, Morgantown, W. Va. Plenty more like this, inside. Location: Morgantown, West Virginia.”  —  There are many well known photographers who have substantial archives in the Library of Congress: Dorothea Lange, Russell Lee, Walker Evans… but less people know about Lewis Hine, a photographer employed by the National Child Labor Committee to document the illegal practice of child labour that was still prevalent in the United States. Hines spent fifteen years documenting child labour in a number of industries, to be then distributed to the general public in the hopes of turning public opinion against the practice which was outlawed in 1904.   Nattily dressed in a suit, tie, and hat, Hine the gentleman actor and mimic assumed a variety of personas — including Bible salesman, postcard salesman, and industrial photographer making a record of factory machinery — to gain entrance to the workplace. When unable to deflect his confrontations with management, he simply waited outside the canneries, mines, factories, farms, and sweatshops with his fifty pounds of photographic equipment and photographed children as they entered and exited the workplace.   In October 1908, Hine visited the Economy Tumbler Company glass works in Morgantown, West Virginia where he snapped these two boys having lunch over the dock doors at the back of the factory. Morgantown was famous for its glassware and the Economy Tumbler Company (formerly the Morgantown Glass Works) produced blown stemware and bar ware, and was in close proximity to the well known Seneca Glass Company.  The clothing is sampled from period clothing of the time and in consultation with a textile conservator, and the siding references were sourced from a National Register of Historic Places Inventory survey conducted in the 1970s for the nearby Seneca Glass Works, which were likely built of the same materials.  The Economy Tumbler Company changed several times and eventually closed down in the 1970s, though its Décor by Morgantown line was highly sought after its endorsement by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy for the White House State dining room.  —  The original image at the Library of Congress  See all 5000+ photographs from the National Child Labor Committee Collection  PetaPixel’s coverage of Hine’s evidence gathering  I’m on Instagram"

Horses and donkeys are different species, with different numbers of chromosomes. Of the two F1 hybrids between these two species, a mule is easier to obtain than a hinny, which is the product of a female donkey (jenny) and a male horse (stallion).  The size of a mule and work to which it is put depend largely on the breeding of the mule's dam. Mules can be lightweight, medium weight, or even, when produced from draft horse mares, of moderately heavy weight.  :85–87  It has been claimed that mules are ""more patient, sure-footed, hardy and long-lived than horses, and they are considered less obstinate, faster, and more intelligent than donkeys.""  :5    Image i     Interesting: MULE | Mule (shoe) | Kawasaki MULE | Mules (train)   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

ColorizedHistory,362sm9,professorpan,9,Fri May 15 21:53:37 2015 UTC,"Section 1. History of article  Jim Beam:       During the late 18th century, members of the Böhm family, who eventually changed the spelling of their surname to ""Beam"", emigrated from Germany and settled in Kentucky.   Johannes ""Reginald"" Beam (1770–1834) was a farmer who began producing whiskey in the style that became known as bourbon. Jacob Beam sold his first barrels of corn whiskey around 1795. The whiskey was first called Old Jake Beam, and the distillery was known as Old Tub. [citation needed]  David Beam (1802–1854) took on his father's responsibilities in 1820 at the age of 18, expanding distribution of the family's bourbon during a time of industrial revolution. David M. Beam (1833–1913) in 1854 moved the distillery to Nelson County to capitalize on the growing network of railroad lines connecting states. James Beauregard Beam (1864–1947) managed the family business before and after Prohibition, rebuilding the distillery in 1933 in Clermont, Kentucky, near his Bardstown home. James B. Beam Distilling Company was founded in 1935 by Harry L. Homel, Oliver Jacobson, H. Blum and Jerimiah Beam. From this point forward, the bourbon would be called ""Jim Beam Bourbon"" after James Beauregard Beam, and some of the bottle labels bear the statement, ""None Genuine Without My Signature"" with the signature James B. Beam. [citation needed] T. Jeremiah Beam (1899–1977) started working at the Clear Springs distillery in 1913, later becoming the master distiller and overseeing operations at the new Clermont facility. Jeremiah Beam eventually gained full ownership and opened a second distillery near Boston, Kentucky, in 1954. Jeremiah later teamed up with childhood friend Jimberlain Joseph Quinn, to expand the enterprise.

ColorizedHistory,34pui9,Captain-Cliche,56,Sun May 3 14:05:23 2015 UTC,"The aircraft in the photo is one of the 8 Handley Page H.P.42's; it's known as 'Hanno.' It was named after the Carthaginian explorer Hanno the Navigator, who explored the Atlantic coast of Africa in approximately 570 BC.   Despite its somewhat shoddy appearance, Handley's were remarkably safe. In the ten years these biplanes were used, no civilian lives were lost. Handley's also offered a lot in terms of comfort; roomy seating, hot meals, a first class saloon, a cocktail area, and even an section designated for smoking were all features of the plane.   By 1940 (a year after the last Handley was decommisioned), however, every Handley had been destroyed in an accident. 'Hanno' was destroyed in a gale on March 19, 1940 over Bristol, England, when it was blown into 'Heracles,' another Handley.

I have seen two different posters with a cutaway diagram of the aircraft that call it a ""wind speed indicator"" but I can't find high-resolution versions online, just unreadable low-res ones.

It may be considered as a lever of the first kind; so much more advantageous, as the hand of the power applied is longer, and the end which raises the weight shorter.  Its fulcrum, which is formed by the united points of the wheels tangent on the earth, may be conceived to be at the lower point of a prop placed under the middle or center of gravity of the axletree; the end which is to raise the weight above the bolster being very near, and the end of the pole, to which the power is applied, very far.  The height of its wheels will procure the greatest facility for drawing the weight, provided the pole be made of such length as to make with the supposed prop, or radius of the wheels, an angle nearly ninety degrees."

ColorizedHistory,33xuh4,joec_95123,30,Sun Apr 26 21:09:05 2015 UTC,"Sherman had four favorite horses in the later part of the war: Duke, Dolly, Sam and Lexington. Lexington was one of the fastest Kentucky racehorses and was the father of Grant's horse, Cincinnati. Sherman lost three other horses at Shiloh in 1862 (when Sherman was a lowly brigadier general in charge of a division), but by the Atlanta campaign around the time this photo was taken, he was a major general in charge of an army. In that position, his horses were in less danger, I think. I think he rode all four in his march to the sea.  Anyway, my question is: does anyone know which one this is? Online I see some claims that it is Sam, Duke or Lexington."

After three and a half months of incessant maneuvering and much hard fighting, Sherman forced Hood to abandon the munitions center of the Confederacy. Sherman remained there, resting his war-worn men and accumulating supplies, for nearly two and a half months. During the occupation, George N. Barnard, official photographer of the Chief Engineer's Office, made the best documentary record of the war in the West; but much of what he photographed was destroyed in the fire that spread from the military facilities blown up at Sherman's departure on November 15."

It just lends itself so well to a TV drama, complete with a satisfying conclusion thanks to his Christmas telegram to the President.     ""I beg to present you, as a Christmas gift, the City of Savannah...""  How fucking epic is that? He gave Lincoln the city of Savannah as a Christmas gift."

Some would wear home-spun clothes, which is where the Butternut color comes from, with the buttons and appropriate ranks sewn on by a someone (Usually a mother or a wife) from back home, while officers would wear a general grey color. Either blueish grey (As in this example that /u/Photojacker colorized), or a more normal, darker grey.   Most Confederate regiments and divisions had uniform regulations, but for most of them, it was harder to follow. Here's a picture from a reenactment, showing the kind of variation you might've seen in the lower ranks of the units, from right to left you can see examples of Butternut and Richmond grey,  as well as light blue pants worn by Union mostly."

ColorizedHistory,32pt3w,Captain-Cliche,35,Sat May 2 22:34:40 2015 UTC,"Original photograph by Alexander Gardner.   The Battle of Antietam, Maryland, on September 17, 1862, was not the conclusive Union victory President Lincoln had desperately hoped for. Still it was enough of a win for him to issue his preliminary emancipation proclamation, which stated that on January 1, 1863, all slaves in states still in rebellion would be free. Yet in the days immediately after the battle, Lincoln became distressed at General George B. McClellan’s failure to pursue Lee’s retreating army. In early October, Lincoln visited McClellan at his headquarters at Antietam to urge him personally to attack. This photograph of Lincoln with McClellan and his staff was one of several taken on October 3 and is a rare view of Lincoln at the front.  Identified officers are, left to right: Col. Alexander S. Webb, Chief of Staff, Gen. George B. McClellan; Scout Adams; Dr. Jonathan Letterman, and Gen. Henry J. Hunt. George Armstrong Custer is on the sidelines, looking at the camera in cowboy hat.  Today is also the anniversary for Lincoln's assassination in Ford's Theatre, in case anybody was wondering."

ColorizedHistory,31x9m8,Captain-Cliche,50,Wed Apr 8 21:42:54 2015 UTC,"Lauri Törni, who was honored with the Mannerheim Cross, the most esteemed decoration in the Finnish Military. North of Lake Tolvayarvi. June 27, 1944.   Lauri Törni, also known as Larry Thorne, was a Finnish army captain who played a role in the Winter War and the Continuation war. Lauri was first noticed by his superiors at the battles of Lake Ladoga, where he took part in the annihilation of encircled Soviet forces in Lemetti. However, his feats in the Continuation War were what really earned him his fame.  In 1943, Lauri was charged with leading an infantry unit unofficially nicknamed 'Detachment Törni.' The unit was renowned on both sides for its combat effectiveness, and often penetrated deep behind enemy lines. During the Battle of Ilomantsi, Lauri's unit inflicted such heavy casualties on the Soviets that the Soviet army placed a bounty on his head for 3,000,000 Finnish Marks. For this, Lauri was awarded the Mannerheim Cross.  The Mannerheim cross, a still active decoration, is awarded for ""extraordinary bravery, for the achievement of extraordinarily important objectives by combat, or for especially well conducted operations."" Only 197 Finns have been awarded with the cross, and no cross has been awarded since May of 1945.   Lauri would later fight under the German flag near Schwerin, Germany. In the final stages of the war, he, like much of the German forces, surrendered to American and British forces. In June, 1945, Lauri escaped from a British POW prison and returned to Finland.  Upon his return, Lauri was arrested by Valpo (the governmental police) and tried for treason for fighting for the German Army. In January of 1947, he recieved a 6-year sentence, but was pardoned in December of 1948.

And very few people knew about the genocides during the time"
ColorizedHistory,31x9m8,nothinbuttherain,21,Thu May 21 08:23:57 2015 UTC,"The alliance Finland had with Germany was part of a separate treaty from the Axis treaty (Tripartite Pact), and Finland wanted to walk a more or less neutral line after the Winter War. They didn't want to ally with Germany, but it was seen as the only really viable option they had if they wanted to remain independent. You also have to remember that Finland was part of the Russian empire up until the Russian Revolution. During the Winter War, Finland more or less showed up how poor of a state the Red Army was in, and peace talks commenced rather quickly, but not before Finland had lost territory. This territory would later be fought over in the Continuation War, where Finland had allied themselves with Germany.  In essence, Finland was between a rock and a hard place. It was either side with Germany and keep the peace, or surrender their independence to the Soviet Union and be reclaimed as a Communist state."

ColorizedHistory,31x9m8,nothinbuttherain,14,Thu Apr 9 20:15:40 2015 UTC,"Simply put. The Communists were considered the bigger bad guy (which is not as inaccurate as we might think today) and the German propaganda was successful in selling their view of their ""Crusade against Bolshevism"".   Less simply put. When it comes to the SS and Wehrmacht volunteers a lot of Scandinavians figured that the Russians were the biggest threat and a lot of them volunteered in order to stop the Russians together with Germany before the Russians came to occupy their home countries. The reasoning behind this was that the Russians talked about liberating the workers of the Nordic countries (all of western Europe really) from the oppressive capitalists while the Germans seemed to be less interested in some sort of long term occupation and more interested in peaceful coexistance with the nordic countries.  Close to the end of the war however people weren't so eager to join so the Wehrmach started conscripting Germans who had previously been passed over for service due to ailments or age. The SS however started conscripting people where they could find them. For example Estonia was occupied for a year by the Soviets and therefore when the Germans liberated them some 10 000 men volunteered for service in the SS (remember that the SS were the only ones who regularly accepted foreign recruits) and when the war turned bad another 10 000 Estonians were conscripted.  The Finns were different however. Since they were not occupied and they were fighting their own war it wasn't very popular to go off and volunteer for the SS however during the interrim peace after the winter war there were quite a few who went to fight for Germany because again they figured it was the best way to protect Finland from another war against the Russians. When the continuation war broke out the Germans tried to create an all Finnish SS regiment with support of the Finnish government but this was rejected by the Finnish government but they did agree to send volunteers to create a smaller battalion sized force. The Finns tried to ensure that the battalion would comprise of people with a wide variety of political leanings because they didn't want to deal with having an bunch of nazi sympathisers and right wing extremist SS veterans in their country after the war was over. And they were somewhat successful in that only some 20% of the battalion were right wing extremists.  When the armastice was signed in 1944 the Finns knew they weren't out of the woods yet and a lot of officers prepared for the worst. Some of them went to Germany to continue the fight there or to recieve training and support and other officers started preparing at home by making sure to stay in touch with their former soldiers and making plans and even going so far as to hide weapons caches in the cities and out in the countryside. And there was cause for concern. The armastice had included that the Finnish army be disbanded as soon as possible, that the communist party (which was taking orders from the Kremlin) be legalised and their leader released from prison, and the Valpo (security police that arrested Törni) had been taken over by communists from the aforementioned communist party. Because the Valpo was controlled by communists whose endgoal was for a Russian liberation of Finland they made sure to find those weapon chaches and arrest the officers responsible.  It all came to a head in 1947-48 when the leader of the Finnish communist party who was also the defacto leader of the Valpo hinted to the chief of the army that the Russians might stage a coup similar to the one going on in Prague if the final peace negotiations didn't go as they wanted. The Finnish army being the Finnish army they decided to prepare to protect against a coup. Before dawn a bunch of army officers with trucks raided the Valpo HQ in Helsinki detaining all Valpo personel for the duration of the raid and seizing all weapons that they had confiscated from the army. Then they unloaded all the weapons at the Helsinki cathedral (among other places) and sent the word around to their former soldiers that if the church bells rang they were to drop what they were doing and get to the cathedral as fast as possible to mobilise the army.  This unwillingness to just give up and die eventually made the Russians very tired. This is one example of the old maxim that war is a contest of will. The Russians being overstreched with keeping their new empire in line didn't have a lot of will to get into a new war with Finland and the Finns showed that they were ready and above all willing to fight again for their independence if they had to so the Russians backed down so they withdrew their support from the Finnish communist party and decided to agree to more lenient peace terms."

It was just well know that he did this type of stuff to create a better image of himself. He had horrible pockmarks due to suffering from smallpox as a child. I just read up on it, it's wikipedia so take it as you should. It reads    At the age of seven, Ioseb (Stalin's original name) fell ill with smallpox and his face was badly scarred by the disease. He later had photographs retouched to make his pockmarks less apparent.    source  In conclusion as the top comment in the linked thread says, either all of Stalin's pictures have been edited and the originals destroyed, or this is in fact a real photo of Stalin. I just find it hard to believe that this picture shows no signs of pockmarks/scars. Granted, this photo is from 1902, and he's wearing a scarf and has a beard. But I personally don't believe this image is an original nor is it untouched. I could be wrong though."

ColorizedHistory,31n13r,Rumrmc,31,Mon Apr 6 22:46:17 2015 UTC,"Original  The February 1945 Yalta Conference was the second wartime meeting of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. During the conference, the three leaders agreed to demand Germany’s unconditional surrender and began plans for a post-war world. Stalin also agreed to permit free elections in Eastern Europe and to enter the Asian war against Japan, for which he was promised the return of lands lost to Japan in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05. Although most of these agreements were initially kept secret, the revelations of the conference particulars became controversial after Soviet-American wartime cooperation degenerated into the Cold War.

The JU-87 Stukas flying overhead are possibly from 1./Schlachtgeschwader 3 (SG 3)  The unit was part of the Detachment Kuhlmey which participated in large battles of summer 1944, during the Finnish-Soviet Continuation War. When the Soviet Red Army launched its fourth strategic offensive on the 9th of June 1944.  C. G. E. Mannerheim asked Germany for help. Among the help that arrived was a Luftwaffe unit that arrived to Finland on the 12th of June. The aircraft landed at the Immola Airfield on the 17th of June. The unit used the whole airfield from there on. They flew some 2,700 missions against the enemy and dropped 770 tonnes of bombs on the enemy. It destroyed over 150 Soviet aircraft, about 200 tanks, dozens of bridges and transport vessels. 23 of the pilots died and 24 were wounded in battle. The unit lost 41 of its aircraft to all reasons.  The detachment consisted of some 70 airworthy aircraft to support the 200 strong Finnish force, but its operational strength varied due to losses, additions and troop movements. The unclear structure is partly explained by the Luftwaffe replacement programs, where obsolete Junkers Ju 87 ""Stuka"" dive bombers were replaced by Focke-Wulf Fw 190 jabo's (fighter-bombers).

In terms of Fw-190s, Gefechtsverband Kuhlmey had 23 such aircraft belonging to the 4th and 5th Staffels of II./JG 54 plus 1./SG 5. This airplane is probably an A-6 variant belonging to the 4th Staffel (white numbers), since the 5th used black numbers.  Also, the tail is clearly not yellow. If you compare the grey tones, you’ll see that the tail is much darker then the yellow band. The yellow engine covers, wing tips, and tail sections varied a great deal from aircraft to aircraft, depending on the pilot’s preferences, so you should be careful when using a different aircraft as reference. The camo is close to being perfect, in my opinion.  Regards"

ColorizedHistory,30pedw,BrandonWhitmore,22,Sun Mar 29 16:32:24 2015 UTC,The dog was even given winter camouflage for his back along with the solidier's full body winter suit. Even though Finland was a relatively new country it had an impressive capability to outfit their soliders with gear and equipment. It showcases the forward thinking of Finland's leadership and the preparation of its generals for invasion.
ColorizedHistory,30pedw,Jenny-Haniver,54,Sun Mar 29 15:42:53 2015 UTC,"Actually that's not really true. For starters this is a picture from 1941, so it does not reflect ""preparation of its generals for invasion.""  Finland was not prepared or outfitted for the conflict. They were still fielding a heavily outdated army in 1939. They lacked any anti-tank guns, modern aircraft, significant armoured presence, and many of the other things that you would expect in a modern (for the times) army.   Finland's leadership was not prepared for the invasion of 1939. They tried to negotiate with the Red Army to prevent an invasion, but refused all offers. This was despite advice from the commander-in-chief of their armed forces, Baron Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, who was so frustrated by the failure of the Finnish government's negotiations that he quit, only to return with the onset of war."
ColorizedHistory,30pedw,BrandonWhitmore,-6,Sun Mar 29 17:04:14 2015 UTC,"I was simply reflecting on their uniforms and personal gear not their entire army's operational status. Simply put the Fins were by far more prepared for winter combat then their Russian adversaries and later the Germans when they invaded the USSR. Even after their defeat in 1940, the Finns rearmed and refitted and won most of their territory back when the Germans invade in 1941. They got of pretty light in 1944 compared to the other Axis nations that invaded with Germany, keeping their independence and leasing land.  On the subject of the Stalin's land grabs you must understand that to have given in would have been a complete disaster and embarrassment for the Finnish Government and people regardless if it were possible to beat the Russians. The the Fins could not of just give up the lands that were asked for since they were all border regions that were already prepared with defensive positions and were military necessary for the protection of the country. I imagine that had the Finns given up the regions that Stalin was asking for, then we would have seen basically what Hitler did to Czechoslovakia: take the well protected and prepared regions of the country and then invade the virtually defenseless nation a year or so later."
ColorizedHistory,30pedw,Jenny-Haniver,15,Sun Mar 29 19:02:08 2015 UTC,"Finland wasn't particularly well equipped for snow combat. Their uniforms were essentially the standard deal for the times. In the case of the Red Army (remember they weren't just Russians, soldiers were drawn from everywhere in the USSR) and the Germans, it was more of a case of under-preparedness because they expected their campaigns to be much shorter. The Red Army soldiers deployed on the Finnish front actually received snowsuits in January 1940, so they would have been equally equipped by the time this picture was taken. The only real advantage they had was that they could use skis, which the Red Army initially didn't bother teaching their soldiers to do.  Actually, Stalin was originally more focused on securing Finnish neutrality than securing land. It is also unlikely that Stalin would have invaded Finland, as he would have simply taken it in the Continuation War. He was more concerned with key areas, such as the Karelian Isthmus, because it was vital that he hold these areas to protect Leningrad."

Cajander was idealist who did not believe yet in August 1939 that Soviet Union would attack Finland. Partly for this reason the Finnish Army was forced to the fight inadequately equipped.  Cajander's name is remembered for ""Model Cajander"", the fashion of many Finnish soldiers in Winter War: the army was poorly equipped, so conscripts were given a utility belt, an emblem to be attached to the hat — to comply with the Hague Conventions — and, hopefully, a rifle. Otherwise, they had to use their own clothes and equipment.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aimo_Cajander"

Most men came and fight with their own civilian clothes on. Snowsuits they had and wore over their civilian clothing were something that could be produced fast and cheaply from the white bed sheets. Then again during that time Finland was mostly rural and the winter clothing of men who worked outdoors like farmers and lumberjacks were probably adequate in winter weather and even better than the flimsy summer uniforms the Russians gave their own soldiers."

Under the command of General Omar Bradley, the offensive sought to take advantage of the German forces' preoccupation with the situation developing in Caen, France. Bradley hoped to break through the weakened German defenses near St. Lo.  The offensive was preceded by aerial bombardment after numerous delays. Thousands of Allied aircraft concentrated their firepower over German forces, who, lacking men and materials, were unable to create any respectable line of defense. It took a day or two for the Operation to gain momentum, but resistance quickly crumbled under the pressure of bombardment and assaults from units of the VII Corps. By July 27, the VII and VIII Corps isolated the Cotentin Peninsula.  The remaining German forces were destroyed by the XIX Corps by July 31, and Bradley's troops could at last leave the bocage country. Operation Cobra indicated an important shift in Allied strategy from concentrated and intense infantry combat to rapid maneuver warfare (a strategy Germany employed in the first few years of the war.)

ColorizedHistory,305yj0,NoxiousDogCloud,8,Tue Mar 24 23:27:42 2015 UTC,Sandbags strapped to the front did provide some added protection against shaped charges like panzerfaust rockets. However it only worked once. The panzerfaust would usually blow the sandbags off the tank.   Against high velocity AP rounds from most any AT guns though the bags were useless.   Bags on the side of the tanks did not help protect against shaped charges.   In early 1944 Patton ordered his troopers to stop putting sand bags on tanks. The extra weight was putting stress on the tanks' chassis.
ColorizedHistory,305yj0,Wingman4l7,2,Wed Mar 25 00:19:41 2015 UTC,"This made me wonder about the muzzle velocity of a panzerfaust rocket, as opposed to rounds from an AT.  The most common one, the Panzerfaust 60, went 45 m/s.  Even the fastest, the Panzerfaust 150 -- which had two-stage propellant ignition -- only went 85 m/s.  That's very pokey compared to the 88mm Flak (820 m/s) or the 75mm Pak 40 AT gun (790 m/s).  Even a slow moving, shaped charge HEAT round used in the Pak 40 went 450 m/s -- still an order of magnitude faster.  (Sources: various Wikipedia entries)"
ColorizedHistory,305yj0,mud074,4,Wed Mar 25 02:22:19 2015 UTC,"The thing is that the speed of a HEAT round (what AT rockets and the round you mentioned used) does not matter in the slightest because all the power is in the aimed explosion. If one could do it hard enough to detonate the charge, you could throw a HEAT round and have the same effect as a fired one."
ColorizedHistory,305yj0,Wingman4l7,2,Wed Mar 25 04:25:26 2015 UTC,"Well, the speed matters a little bit if it's not fast enough to punch through that layer of sandbags before it detonates! :P"
ColorizedHistory,305yj0,mud074,1 point,Wed Mar 25 04:36:24 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that the round detonates on the sand bags. OP says in another post that they were effective on the front of the tank but not the sides. I take that as the sandbag weakening the blast enough to make the armor thick enough to stop it on the front and not the rears. If the shell went through the sandbags, it wouldn't help the front armor at all."
ColorizedHistory,305yj0,Hovsky,3,Wed Mar 25 04:55:43 2015 UTC,"Interesting how much things have changed. An RPG-7 has a muzzle velocity of 115m/s - over 2x the Panzerfaust, and an AT-4 is 6x as fast as the Panzerfaust, at 290 m/s."
ColorizedHistory,305yj0,Jon_Cake,1 point,Wed Mar 25 05:38:32 2015 UTC,Sandbags strapped to the front did provide some added protection against shaped charges  Bags on the side of the tanks did not help protect against shaped charges.   Is this due to the different between the front and side armour of the tank?
ColorizedHistory,305yj0,NoxiousDogCloud,1 point,Wed Mar 25 07:52:52 2015 UTC,Yeah. The armor on the front was both thicker and sloped. The slope increased the chances of a round glancing off the the armor instead of penetrating.
ColorizedHistory,305yj0,yeahgreg,1 point,Wed Mar 25 06:47:53 2015 UTC,"I know it's not the best source of information, but I saw in the film Fury that they had strapped some logs to the sides of the tank. I'm wondering if that would have actually provided any protection against a panzerfaust. I doubt it would provide any real protection against an AT around, or another tanks round but is it possible a hand held rocket would detonate on the log as opposed to sandbags? I would assume it would also be lighter than sandbags, and I presume the main purpose of the logs would be to provide extra traction if a tank were stuck or going through mud, but I figured I'd ask."
ColorizedHistory,305yj0,NoxiousDogCloud,1 point,Wed Mar 25 15:11:17 2015 UTC,"Sandbags work OK against shaped charges because the sand can absorb the heat from the molten jet of the charge. The non-uniform distribution of the material also helps disperse the jet. Wood, on the other hand, doesn't have the same qualities. At best it could provide spacing; the jet can only reach so far, so if it detonates far enough from the armor it's less likely to penetrate. However even the earliest versions of the Panzerfaust could penetrate 140mm of steel armor; that's 5.5 inches. Later versions could defeat up to 320mm of steel. If the logs were strapped to the front, maybe they'd work. But on the sides, it's extremely unlikely.  The M4 Sherman had a number of design... problems. One major one was the tracks were considerably narrower than German counterparts. The narrow track already contributed to the M4's inability to deal with mud. Adding extra weight to the tank would increase the pressure on the treads and suspension, increasing wear and risking mechanical failure, and making it even more likely to get stuck in the mud.  Basically the logs might work, but the minimal protection they could offer would seriously hamper the mobility of the tank."
ColorizedHistory,305yj0,AlasdhairM,2,Wed Apr 29 15:28:21 2015 UTC,"Funnily enough, they often tended to improve the efficacy of shaped charge warheads. They did so by causing the warhead to explode farther away from the armor, giving the jet of copper plasma time to properly form. This idea of a proper standoff distance is why modern shaped charge weapons tend to have a decently large spike sticking out the front, such as the BGM-71D/E and Panzerfaust-3."

Potamac Park, Washington D.C, United States of America  Format 4 x 5 inch glass negative  Source Courtesy of the Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division Washington, D.C. 20540 USA, gifted by Herbert A. French in 1947    Orginal caption “Sumi and Sada Tamura, [3/28/25]”    Pictured are Sumi and Sada Tamura, daughters of Mr. Teijiro Tamura, former Third Secretary of the Japanese Embassy in the United States. From a photomechanical colour postcard I came across and cross referencing satellite imagery, the picture was taken in in the morning of March 28th, making this image nearly 90 years old.  Work has picked up recently and there a couple of projects that are finally completed which means I may be able to get back to posting more regularly, as it happens I ended up staying up all night tracking an eBay auction so I decided to have a crack at a non-work related image. I don’t take colour references in hand coloured or tinted images as set in stone, as often the companies creating prints or postcard etc. are not necessarily the people who take the image so the colour references can’t always be trusted. In this case, much of the location is still around with only minor changes, so everything but the kimonos and umbrellas are fairly reliable. I took a departure from the kimonos on the postcard and instead found other vintage children’s kimono’s I sampled off as I couldn’t find too much information about the Tamura family.  Still, it’s a fantastic shot and it’s always a good technical challenge to attempt convincing landscape work and complex patterns. I’m still working on a huge piece, which I’m just chipping away at every day. Enjoy.    Instagram  Twitter  Facebook"

ColorizedHistory,2y4ur9,TotesMessenger,6,Fri Mar 6 19:26:55 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure the U.S. and Japan had always been allies throughout history, except during WWII."
ColorizedHistory,2y4ur9,DoctorDank,100,Fri Mar 6 20:37:37 2015 UTC,"While we enjoyed a period of friendship, we were far from allies for the bulk of our history leading up to the second world war.    Our modern relationship didn't get off to a good start.    If I'm honest, this event commonly remembered in history is probably overly credited for the ""opening of Japan"" than it deserves. The US was only one of multiple western nations involved in the military bullying of Japan, and the memory of this event was played up by both sides later on, even though the Tokugawa Shogunate realistically caved under persistent pressure rather than specifically as a result of Commodore Perry's actions.    After the Meji Restoration, the Japanese deliberately forged friendly relationships with all of the various western powers.  They modeled their naval practice off of the British, and their army practice off the Germans.  Meanwhile, the US was trying to flex its muscle slightly internationally, but was very far from contesting British primacy on the high seas, and thus didn't seek to make too big of a splash.    This begins to change dramatically with the US victory in the Spanish-American war and the Japanese victory in the Russo-Japanese war. The Japanese viewed the western pacific as their potential sphere of influence, and were actively growing as a new colonial and industrial power with a hungry appetite for raw materials not available domestically, and the US just made themselves a serious potential obstacle.  The Japanese had bigger, more local fish yet to fry, but with the Russians out of the picture, no other western power had a strong hold on a significant holding on the border of Japan's growing sphere of influence.   The US had far less strategic interest in far eastern colonialism.  This was more geopolitical grandstanding from a nation not really interested in being overly involved in the world outside of the western hemisphere.  Up to the end of the First World War, the US had no real interest in directly interfering with Japan's rise.    In short, this period up until the end of the First World War, both sides were aware of the future strategic rivalry, but neither side had any interest in pursuing it, and maintained fairly friendly relations.    This all began to change, starting with the Treaty of Versailles.    The Japanese entered the First World War to pick off the pacific colonial assets held by Germany, and wasn't having any of the national self-determination bullshit that Wilson was trying to serve up. Unlike the United States, who benefited from a vast supply of domestic natural resources, Japan enjoyed no such luxury, and understood expansion as necessary to grow their economy.  While fans of Wilson see his policy as outwardly benevolent, the Japanese felt directly threatened by it.    This alone didn't spoil US-Japanese relations immediately.  Even the Washington Naval Treaty, while not favoring Japan in its final form, was actually something that the Japanese were OK with, as they were fully aware they could not directly outbuild the US in their current state.  With China falling apart, the Japanese strategy was to appease the US while they expanded their influence further on the mainland.  This was not just to cover their strategic backside, this was also to keep up trade with the western allies who still dominated most of the local raw materials market.    By the end of the 1920s, the US had retreated more towards isolationism, especially with the onset of the Great Depression.  When FDR eventually was elected, he was the president of a freshly isolationist nation, even as Japan invaded China in 1937.  FDR wasn't having any of this republican isolationist nonsense, and worked actively to break the country out of its shell.  While he was primarily concerned with Nazi Germany, he poked sticks in all sorts of directions to get the american people interested in the global political situation.    One of these sticks was thrust against Japan, who was looking to capitalize on the fall of France and the Netherlands.  The Chinese coast was not particularly easy to exploit, and not particularly resource rich.  The resources the Japanese really wanted were in the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia), and French Indochina gave them the bases from which to reach this area.  This frightened the British, as it also put the Japanese in striking range of British-held Malaysia and Singapore.  The US took this as the place to put its foot down, piggy-backing on British strategic concern and public opinion against Japan stemming from atrocities in China to commit to a full scale embargo against Japan.    This forced Japan's hand, and put them on the course to military confrontation starting with Pearl Harbor.    TL:DR: ~1850s -> 1905: Not many mutual fucks given ~1905 -> 1918: General friendliness, but acknowledgement of future rivalry. 1918 -> Early 1920s: Power shakeup leading to Washington Naval Treaty, ends largely in US retreat to isolationism ~1930s->July 1941: Japanese expand into china while pursuing western appeasement.  Western embargo starts in July 1941.  Dec 7 1941: Pearl Habor 1945: War ends, US occupation begins.  Any sort of actual political alliance really begins here as the Cold War ramps up."

By the same logic of rights, though, it was also entirely Japan's right to take it as a hostile action given that a massive percentage of imports fuelling the Japanese economy and industrial capacity were stopped by the embargo. Hence they struck out south to the resource-rich East Indies (and also wrecked the US Pacific Fleet to take out their biggest threat, for that matter) as a matter of maintaining what they saw as their rightful place among the great powers of the world."

ColorizedHistory,2y4ur9,allhailkodos,1 point,Tue Mar 10 07:59:04 2015 UTC,"This was more geopolitical grandstanding from a nation not really interested in being overly involved in the world outside of the western hemisphere.   It should be acknowledged that the United States colonized the Philippines in the era (Spanish American War - pre WWI) discussed here.  The 'isolationist' interwar period was more the exception than the rule, and even there, there are examples of U.S. militarism in the Eastern Hemisphere (e.g. having troops in the Soviet Union during its civil war)."
ColorizedHistory,2y4ur9,ituralde_,2,Wed Mar 11 05:37:56 2015 UTC,"This isn't the case at all.    The Spanish-American war was a sharp departure from the way the US conducted itself internationally.    This here is an example of a more common tone of US politics from the period, this from midway through the first world war, right out of Woodrow Wilson's second inaugural address:   That all nations are equally interested in the peace of the world and in the political stability of free peoples, and equally responsible for their maintenance; that the essential principle of peace is the actual equality of nations in all matters of right or privilege; that peace cannot securely or justly rest upon an armed balance of power; that governments derive all their just powers from the consent of the governed and that no other powers should be supported by the common thought, purpose or power of the family of nations; that the seas should be equally free and safe for the use of all peoples, under rules set up by common agreement and consent, and that, so far as practicable, they should be accessible to all upon equal terms; that national armaments shall be limited to the necessities of national order and domestic safety; that the community of interest and of power upon which peace must henceforth depend imposes upon each nation the duty of seeing to it that all influences proceeding from its own citizens meant to encourage or assist revolution in other states should be sternly and effectually suppressed and prevented.   That's basically as non-interventionist as you get, and is reflective of the platform Wilson ran on.    Perhaps this tone was best outlined by John Quincy Adams:   She has, in the lapse of nearly half a century, without a single exception, respected the independence of other nations, while asserting and maintaining her own. She has abstained from interference in the concerns of others, even when the conflict has been for principles to which she clings, as to the last vital drop that visits the heart. She has seen that probably for centuries to come, all the contests of that Aceldama, the European World, will be contests between inveterate power, and emerging right.  Wherever the standard of freedom and independence has been or shall be unfurled, there will her heart, her benedictions and her prayers be. But she goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all. She is the champion and vindicator only of her own. She will recommend the general cause, by the countenance of her voice, and the benignant sympathy of her example.  She well knows that by once enlisting under other banners than her own, were they even the banners of foreign independence, she would involve herself, beyond the power of extrication, in all the wars of interest and intrigue, of individual avarice, envy, and ambition, which assume the colors and usurp the standard of freedom.    There were cases of those who thought differently.  Theodore Roosevelt certainly is the most notable among them, but he was largely an outlier.    In the interwar period, the US recognized itself as the new premier naval power, but rather than leveraging their uncontested industrial might to flex its muscle internationally, they instead pushed the world towards disarmament.  The terms of the Washington Naval Treaty meant that the navies of the interwar world were tiny compared to the likes of the World War 1 era British Navy.  The Second World War was fought in large part with a handful of full sized capital ships, whereas the British fielded nearly 40 at Jutland alone.    Suffice it to say, the appetite for serious global action and power projection along the lines of how the US behaves today simply wasn't there.  What little existed died with the stock market in 1929.  It's certainly the case that the US would never have made it into the Second World War as quickly were it not through FDR's determined effort to sell the people on it as well as making use of every minor tool at his disposal to put the country in a position in which war could be justified."
ColorizedHistory,2y4ur9,allhailkodos,1 point,Wed Mar 11 06:10:39 2015 UTC,"I didn't flesh out my points well.  1) Even during the isolationist phase, there was U.S. military intervention in the Eastern Hemisphere.  It feels a little nitpicky to point this out, but I had to speak up for my Filipino brothers and sisters, given the omission.  They were colonized for fifty years, and it's not noted above.  On an aside, I would be really interested, also, in knowing what the Japanese made of the Western intervention in the Soviet Civil War.  2) I agree that the interwar period was isolationist, relative to what preceded and what followed.  What I was trying to say is that the debate between isolationist strands (including warnings against 'foreign entanglements', etc.) and interventionist strands masks a broader, secular trend of expansionism that starts with Plymouth Rock and extends, through native American territories, the Monroe Doctrine, the Mexican American War, manifest destiny and the frontier and the destruction of native peoples, the Spanish American War, and into the post WWII era of intense global meddling and control.  A time lapse of the territory controlled by settler colonists / the United States is sufficient to demonstrate this - it goes in one direction, territorial expansion from 1608 to WWII.  And after WWII, other means of control were substituted, though you could make the argument that the maintenance of military bases all over the world constitutes a form of expansionism as well."
ColorizedHistory,2y4ur9,ituralde_,1 point,Wed Mar 11 06:32:30 2015 UTC,"I guess I should have made a point of it explicitly, upon further review, it could be unclear that my mention of the spanish-american war placing the US directly in the path of Japanese expansion referred directly to the US acquisition of the Philippines.    Regarding what the Japanese thought of US intervention in the Russian civil war, I'd go to /r/askhistorians.  I'm out of my depth on that, I'm just an average dude.  My understanding in general was that Japan was extremely anti-communist, and specifically outlawed the communist party until the US occupation at the end of the Second World War, and thus find it highly unlikely that there was a significant degree of sympathy for the Soviet cause.    What you have to understand about American isolationism is that it stands in concert with manifest destiny, not in opposition to it.  America saw itself as the sole leaders of the western hemisphere, and framed its sense of isolationism as being specifically being largely politically uninvolved with the regimes of the old world.  As you can imagine, the moralistic attitude at the center of US isolationism was precisely as hypocritical as it seemed.  Any debate that US expansionism and imperialism was in any way morally superior to that of the European nations is splitting hairs at best.    It would not be the first, not the last time that such an apparent contradiction was at the core of a nation's political identity.    [edit] - its worth noting that the entire label 'isolationism' wasn't used at the time, and is largely a product of a post second world war viewpoint, in which intervening globally became the norm.  ""Isolationism"" is used by a lot of 20th century historians almost as a pejorative term, in an era where the US actively pursued and sold its people and its allies on a role as global defender of democracy.  ""Isolationism"", as much as it existed, was carried wisdom dating back to the founding fathers, to avoid problems that needn't concern the american people, not any sort of pacifistic ideal.  The USA still maintained its desires for national greatness, it simply didn't see miring itself in old world conflicts as part of the path for this.  The Monroe Doctrine is illustrative of the American vision for growth at the time - the US had effectively half the planet to itself, and was designed to draw the line between the old world and the US-dominated new world.  As much as this was the path towards political domination over the western hemisphere, it was also drawing a line in the sand to divide itself away from the east."
ColorizedHistory,2y4ur9,daimposter,1 point,Wed Mar 11 07:16:24 2015 UTC,"And on an aside, what do you think of a reading of the W. Bush era unilateral imperialism as a continuation of isolationist strands of foreign policy though.  It really was shocking and interesting to see how insular and parochial attitudes combined with global military and economic dominance to produce a very weird kind of imperialism in the last decade.  You can still hear it today in Republican politicians' rhetoric."
ColorizedHistory,2y4ur9,slurp_derp,1 point,Wed Mar 11 06:36:38 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't characterize it as any sort of continuation of the sort of isolationism that prevailed before the Second World War.  Isolationism in the past was almost the product of a strange ideological arrogance as much as it was pragmatism.  Simply put, America saw itself as above the sorts of petty conflicts that were seen as an inherent part of the broken European political system.    The bits of isolationism you see in modern republican rhetoric carries more a disrespect for the outside world.  This argument echews the moralistic claim at the core of the prior thought in favor of something that waffles between egotism and pragmatism. A pessimistic view of it would suggest racism was also much at the core, but this likely varies by individual.  Either way, my read is that this tone of disrespect for the outside world allows the republican party to swing freely between isolationism (why waste resources on parts of the world that don't matter) and interventionism (they are inferior to us/our way so our intervention is justifiable and their sovereignty is irrelevant) without seeming overly contradictory.    On a separate note, I think the term 'imperialism' gets thrown around too easily.   There's a distinct difference in form and function between traditional imperialism and the sorts of actions the US takes now, and to characterize them as identical I think paints the wrong picture.  That's not to make any sort of argument that anything we are doing now is particularly more honorable, pleasant, or justifiable, just simply imprecise."

The Soviet Union ostensibly sought to claim parts of Finnish territory, demanding—amongst other concessions—that Finland cede substantial border territories in exchange for land elsewhere, claiming security reasons, primarily the protection of Leningrad, which was only 32 km (20 mi) from the Finnish border.    Finland refused and the USSR invaded the country. Many sources conclude that the Soviet Union had intended to conquer all of Finland, and use the establishment of the puppet Finnish Communist government and the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact's secret protocols as proof of this,       while other sources argue against this idea of a full Soviet conquest.     The Soviets possessed more than three times as many soldiers as the Finns, thirty times as many aircraft, and a hundred times as many tanks. The Red Army, however, had been crippled by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin's Great Purge of 1937.  With more than 30,000 of its officers executed or imprisoned, including most of those of the highest ranks, the Red Army in 1939 had many inexperienced senior and mid-level officers.   Because of these factors, and high morale in the Finnish forces, Finland repelled Soviet attacks for several months, much longer than the Soviets expected.   However, after reorganization and adoption of different tactics, the renewed Soviet offensive overcame Finnish defenses at the borders. Finland then agreed to cede more territory than originally demanded by the Soviet Union in 1939; the Soviets, having conquered the areas they demanded from Finland but at a cost of heavier losses in troops than anticipated, accepted this offer.  Hostilities ceased in March 1940 with the signing of the Moscow Peace Treaty. Finland ceded territory representing 11% of its land area and 30% of its economy to the Soviet Union.  Soviet losses were heavy, and the country's international reputation suffered.  While the Soviet Union did not conquer all Finland, Soviet gains somewhat exceeded their pre-war demands. They gained substantial territory along Lake Ladoga, providing a buffer for Leningrad, and territory in northern Finland.  Finland retained its sovereignty and enhanced its international reputation.  The end of the war cancelled the Franco-British plan to send troops to Finland through northern Scandinavia. Some authors would suggest that the official statement by Sweden, Norway and Denmark of February 1940, declaring they would not allow British troops to use their territories on their way to Finland, was a factor in Finland's decision of commencing the peace talks with Russia.  One of the operation's major goals in the projected Franco-British operation had been to take control of northern Sweden's iron ore and cut its deliveries to Germany.  For this reason it was also a major factor in the launching of Operation Weserübung, Nazi Germany's invasion of Denmark and Norway.

Born September 4, 1916, in Ponca City, Oklahoma, Walter ""Waddy"" Young was, from the beginning, bound for great things. Throughout his high school years, Waddy was succesful both academically and on the field, and in 1938 he was chosen as an All-American in '38 by various papers and, more notable, Gartland Rice. Soon after, Waddy was picked up by the Brooklyn Dodgers and entered the professional scene.  Though, he didn't remain in the spotlight for long; in his second professional season, Waddy enlisted in the Army Air Force. He was promptly sent east, serving as anti-submarine patrol in New York, Newfoundland, and Great Britain, accumulating more than nine thousand combat hours.  Still, Waddy wasn't ready to give up the fight. He decided to volunteer for the B-29 Program, and ended up as a captain stationed on the Mariana Islands. One of ""Waddy's Wagon's"" most famous escapades occurred on January 9, 1945; ""Waddy's Wagon"" and 72 other B-29s were ordered to bomb the Nakajima Aircraft Engine Factory near Tokyo. The mission went awry when the Japanese resisted, and the plane to ""Waddy's Wagon's"" right was rammed by a kamikaze fighter. Waddy continued undeterred, bombed the target, and turned back to assist the stricken plane. They crew of ""Waddy's Wagon"" threw blocks down to signal where the downed plane landed.  ""Waddy's Wagon"" and its crew disappeared without a trace 10 miles east of Choshi Point, Japan, while it was protecting B-29 Crew A-46 (the crew that was rammed by the Kamikaze fighter). A search plane was dispatched, but after combing the area, there was no hint as to what might have happened. It is thought to have been shot down during the Nakajima mission.

You know statistically something bad is likely to happen, but the sheer expression in the image makes you hope upon hope that just maybe once there is a happy ending and those faces will keep smiling.  Maybe that's why, as campy as it is, ""The Mission"" from Spielberg's Amazing Stories affected me so much as a kid."

Also tragic to know that these men's job wasn't exactly sunshine and roses either. That raid on Nakajima was an almost complete failure with virtually none of the bombs hitting the factory. The vast majority of the bombs fell elsewhere. Many killing women and children.  They were men fighting in a difficult war. If they did their jobs well they would cause innocents pain and suffering. And if they did it poorly other innocents would have pain and suffering."

ColorizedHistory,2wkavb,chricke,5,Sat Feb 21 01:31:29 2015 UTC,"Sigmund Freud:       Sigmund Freud (/frɔɪd/;  German pronunciation: [ˈziːkmʊnt ˈfʁɔʏ̯t]; born Sigismund Schlomo Freud; 6 May 1856 – 23 September 1939) was an Austrian neurologist, now known as the father of psychoanalysis.  Freud qualified as a doctor of medicine at the University of Vienna in 1881,  and then carried out research into cerebral palsy, aphasia and microscopic neuroanatomy at the Vienna General Hospital.  Upon completing his habilitation in 1895, he was appointed a docent in neuropathology in the same year and became an affiliated professor (professor extraordinarius) in 1902.    In creating psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst,  Freud developed therapeutic techniques such as the use of free association and discovered transference, establishing its central role in the analytic process. Freud’s redefinition of sexuality to include its infantile forms led him to formulate the Oedipus complex as the central tenet of psychoanalytical theory. His analysis of dreams as wish-fulfillments provided him with models for the clinical analysis of symptom formation and the mechanisms of repression as well as for elaboration of his theory of the unconscious as an agency disruptive of conscious states of mind.  Freud postulated the existence of libido, an energy with which mental processes and structures are invested and which generates erotic attachments, and a death drive, the source of repetition, hate, aggression and neurotic guilt.  In his later work Freud developed a wide-ranging interpretation and critique of religion and culture.  Psychoanalysis remains influential within psychotherapy, within some areas of psychiatry, and across the humanities. As such, it continues to generate extensive and highly contested debate with regard to its therapeutic efficacy, its scientific status, and whether it advances or is detrimental to the feminist cause.  Nonetheless, Freud's work has suffused contemporary Western thought and popular culture. In the words of W. H. Auden's poetic tribute, by the time of Freud's death in 1939, he had become ""a whole climate of opinion / under whom we conduct our different lives"".    For the influence of psychoanalysis in the humanities, see J. Forrester The Seductions of Psychoanalysis Cambridge University Press 1990, pp. 2-3. For the debate on efficacy, see Fisher, S. and Greenberg, R. P., Freud Scientifically Reappraised: Testing the Theories and Therapy, New York: John Wiley, 1996, pp. 193-217. For the debate on the scientific status of psychoanalysis see Stevens, R. 1985 Freud and Psychoanalysis Milton Keynes: Open University Press, pp. 91-116. For the debate on psychoanalysis and feminism, see Appignanesi, Lisa & Forrester, John. Freud's Women.

ColorizedHistory,2wfofm,slavik262,13,Mon Mar 2 05:55:20 2015 UTC,"Traditional rifle cartridges are very reliable out to 800-900 meters, if the man behind the rifle has sufficient skill.  It was the Germans, at the end of World War II, that introduced intermediate rifle cartridges, used by all assault rifles today. The rounds are only reliable out to 300-500 yards, but   Most engagements take place at much shorter distances. Smaller rounds mean you can carry more ammo and have less recoil to handle."
ColorizedHistory,2wfofm,Santi871,12,Fri Feb 20 01:51:44 2015 UTC,"I wasn't talking about the rounds' performance, I was talking about the ability to see a person at 800m, zeroing in on them, taking a steady shot and hit them while taking the wind into account. Without a scope. Three times without missing.  Unfortunately seeing someone standing in front of a window 800 meters away sounds beyond what's possible for human beings."
ColorizedHistory,2wfofm,aggie1391,9,Fri Feb 20 01:55:16 2015 UTC,"With Mosin Nagant's, the rear site is adjustable up to 1000m, and while most people couldn't, or barely could, see that far, there are some humans who have better sight and would be able to see that at least enough to have somewhat decent aim.  Obviously luck has somewhat of a role at that distance with irons, but it isn't entirely impossible.  Taking into account that 800m was a rough estimate and humans having a tendency to overstate long distances, I wouldn't doubt that the story is plausible, albeit with the typical human overstatement of distance."
ColorizedHistory,2wfofm,Santi871,4,Fri Feb 20 02:01:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Note that your car's speedometer could go all the way up to 280kph, which doesn't mean your car can reach that speed."

If Iraqi's invaded Texas somehow would he not fight against them and be seen as a savage as well? Anyway I'm a big fan of military nonfiction in general, so I can understand its just one good ole boy from Texas's point of view."
ColorizedHistory,2wfofm,jgeigel,1 point,Thu Feb 19 23:42:35 2015 UTC,"And honestly, the racist charge of the word ""savages"" holds absolutely no water when you look at how and when he employed it.   If the word savages when referring to the enemy is racist and politically incorrect, brother I hope you never go to war. He was referring simply to the enemy. Terrorists of the modern era more thsn deserve the title of savage. Of course, if people who deliberately murder civilians, use their children as suicide bombers and inflict power drills and beheading on captives aren’t savages, then the word has no meaning. Unfortunately, some have become so reluctant to make moral judgments that they are simply unable to see the differences between our troops and the people they’re fighting. Chris kyle saw savagery. He named it, and for that he is a pariah to the American left.  Also, Kyle did offer sympathy and outreach to INNOCENT Iraqis and understood their plight. He did not feel the same about the enemy. How in the world is a sniper supposed to neutralize the bad guys if he's constantly empathic with them? It really makes no sense.   Edit: again, context matters   Savages, despicable evil. That's what we were fighting in iraq. That's why a lot of people myself included, called the enemy savages. There really was no other way to describe what we encountered there."

He did some bonehead things outside his military operations and I think thats why he rubs some people the wrong way.   That last sentence you wrote is why I think Kyle had that black and white mentality. I'm sure its a lot easier to kill when someone is actively trying to kill you, not as easy when the situation is more ambiguous. Easier to call them savages and not worry about what you did is right or wrong,I understand that.   Don't get me wrong by the way. I appreciate the sacrifice given by our boys in service.

ColorizedHistory,2uncbv,BasementSquirrel,8,Tue Feb 3 19:12:52 2015 UTC,"Are the colors you choose for these best guesses, or is there a way you can distinguish colors based on shades of gray and whatnot?"
ColorizedHistory,2uncbv,BasementSquirrel,14,Tue Feb 3 18:13:49 2015 UTC,"To be honest, it is a little bit of guesswork and a little bit of research. For things like the Autopeds, I am able to type into Google Image Search to find photographs of Autopeds that are either restored or need restoration. This can tell me that they have black paint, red rubber handles, and reddish rubber tires. That sort of thing. The uniforms are also kinds of things that you can find with some research. For example, I was able to the current location of this photo today and compare the building and sidewalk to later color photos to determine what color it was.   Then there's the art of adjusting hue for time of day, weather, and lighting.   Lastly, there's some pure guesswork. Specific skintone is often difficult to tell, and things like lettering on non-mass-produced signs is difficult to research. The value in the black and white can sometimes give you clues as to whether the object you're coloring was a ""strong""/warm color (bright red, orange, yellow), but it's not always reliable in itself.  I don't know if technology will ever exist to do this automatically. There's just not enough data in a greyscale image to determine specific colors. It will require a human element."

ColorizedHistory,2uncbv,EightyJay,7,Tue Feb 3 20:44:23 2015 UTC,"Autoped:       The Autoped was an early motor scooter or motorized scooter manufactured by the Autoped Company of Long Island City, New York  from 1915 to 1921.    The driver stood on a platform with 10-inch tires  and operated the machine using only the handlebars and steering column,   pushing them forward to engage the clutch, using a lever on the handlebar to control the throttle, and pulling the handlebars and column back to disengage the clutch and apply the brake.   After riding, the steering column would be folded onto the platform to store the scooter more easily. The engine was an air-cooled, 4-stroke, 155 cc engine over the front wheel.   The bike came with a headlamp and tail lamp, a Klaxon horn, and a toolbox. Developed during wartime and gasoline rationing, it was quite efficient, but was not widely distributed.  An electric version was also available with a motor on the front wheel.   A patent for the Autoped as a ""self-propelled vehicle"" was applied for in July 1913 and granted in July 1916.   An early description of the Autoped described it as having a hollow steering column that acted as the fuel tank.  However, the production version had a fuel tank above the front mudguard.

Kilpeenjoki, now modern day Комсомо́льскоe (Komsomolskoye), Russia, roughly 11 miles from the present day Finnish border  Format Black and White photograph by Vänrikki (2nd Lt.) P. Myllymäki of the Information Company (IC) photographers, TK-kuvaaja. Item #39081  Source Courtesy of SA-kuva, the Finnish Armed Forces, from the Wartime Photograph Archives    Orginal caption “Gabriel Tossu vallatun tykin ja konekiväärin vieressä. Kilpeenjoki 1941.08.20”  Translation: Gabriel Tossu posting next to a captured cannon and machine gun. Kilpeenjoki, 20th August 1941    Pictured is Gabriel Tossu, presumably a war correspondent and Finnish soldier. He is possibly the Finnish author Eino H Ahti whose pen name was Gabriel Tossu, making him 47 years of age in 1941, participating in the Finnish re-conquest of Lagoda Karelia.  One of the less well known conflicts during World War II were numerous hostilities between Finland and the Soviet Union, beginning with the Winter War of 1939 - 1940 and beyond in the Continuation War (also known as the Great Patriotic War) between 1941 - 1944.   The Soviet Union ostensibly sought to claim parts of Finnish territory, demanding—amongst other concessions—that Finland cede substantial border territories in exchange for land elsewhere, claiming security reasons, primarily the protection of Leningrad, which was only 32 km (20 mi) from the Finnish border. Finland refused and the USSR invaded the country. (source)   Finland eventually ceded just over 10% of its former land to the Soviet Union, now modern day Karelia in the Moscow Peace Treaty, preserving Finnish independence.  Though there was a small period of tenuous peace, hostilities resumed the following year in the tumult of both Nazi and Soviet expansion in Europe. Following its restoration of diplomatic relations with Germany who intended to use Finland as a base of operations against the Soviet Union from the west, the Finns changed their strategy from one of defence to re-conquest against their continued subjugation from the Soviet Union.   Letting the Nazi’s begin the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, a month later the Finns initiated a major offensive on the Karelian region and northern Lake Lagoda - the area which this photograph was taken - re-capturing their ceded territories. At the end of the war, the Finns conceded the same territories as part of the Moscow Peace Treaty, but avoiding occupation by the Soviet Union.  Tossu is posing with captured Soviet field artillery, a Russian Maxim 1910 HMG on a Sokolov mount, and the larger Soviet 76 mm regimental gun M1927 (76-мм полковая пушка обр. 1927), known to the Finns as a 76 RK/27.

I get that it's was probably a photo taken in full sun with stark contrast, so, besides his pupils being tiny pin pricks, they adjusted the print to have detail in the shadows and highlights, and that affected the contrast in his eyes.  Still, the eyes sort of look like he's a sculpture. I'd like to see a little burning right in the middle of his eyes... nothing extreme like making them full on black, just a 1 to 2 shade difference.  Sorry for the nitpicking. It's a really gorgeous job with very subtle color that works with the slightly under exposed photo.  I've noticed that it's difficult to nail the color on the under exposed photos, probably because if it was similarly exposed on actual color film the exposure would be unusable. Color film seems to have far less leeway than black and white."
ColorizedHistory,2uiiay,Aleforge,5,Mon Feb 2 15:28:20 2015 UTC,"I'd probably make a guess and say the subject had incredibly light coloured blue eyes and as a rule I generally don't modify the exposure too much on individual areas unless I know it's an orthochromatic image to begin with. You're probably right, the image is extremely grainy too at 100% detail. When I do any restoration work, one of the first things I do is correct the exposure globally.  Cheers!"

Separately, some soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army continued to fight on isolated Pacific islands until at least the 1970s, with the last known Japanese soldier surrendering in 1974. Intelligence officer Hiroo Onoda, who surrendered on Lubang Island in the Philippines in March 1974, and Teruo Nakamura, who surrendered on the Indonesian island of Morotai in December 1974, appear to have been the last confirmed holdouts.

EDIT: That was a poorly worded and insensitive comment. I was attempting to make a point but I clearly did not deliver it in a proper manner."
ColorizedHistory,2tik8i,dbx99,3,Sat Jan 24 18:30:06 2015 UTC,"Lol, ya, because dropping a nuclear weapon on inhabited cities, and levelling them was not an atrocity that anyone got off the hook for.  I'm not sure if you're familiar with war. It's nothing but atrocities."
ColorizedHistory,2tik8i,Akoustyk,11,Sat Jan 24 19:05:07 2015 UTC,"War is often plagued with atrocity, this is true, but hear me out:   The casualty count for the Americans alone, depending on the degree of fanatical and often suicidal resistance from Japanese soldiers and civilians alike ran into the millions. The estimated KIA count for the invasion (dubbed Operation Downfall) were considered to be upwards of 50,000 in the first month alone, and that's JUST American troops so this would exclude British, Canadian, and Russian troops and their individual landing sites and operations. The Japanese casualty count was considered to be anywhere upwards of ten million; compared to the 80 000 who died in Hiroshima blast, or the roughly 70,000 in Nagasaki. So the dropping of the bombs, while unfortunate, was needed to break the unwavering and fanatical support the Japanese would have given to their emperor in the case of an invasion. The atomic blasts were not only a tactical decision, but a moral one that saved millions and millions of lives, Japanese and Allied.  The Japanese were notorious for the atrocities committed freely and unchecked from the second sino-japanese war to the end of the second world war. From Korea to the islands off the northern coast of Australia the Japanese raped, pillaged, beheaded, tortured, and imprisoned on a scale that is nearly unimaginable. Human experimentation, the execution of civilians and soldiers alike, cannibalism, and forced labour were common and encouraged.   The individual Japanese soldier, depending on his length of service, would most certainly have been guilty of, or a witness to, horrendous crimes. This differs slightly to the common image of Nazi high command (Generals and such) bearing much of the backlash for criminal acts during wartime. The common Japanese infantryman was often the catalyst for much of their committed horrors. However, some often think out of reparation for the atomic bombs, many Japanese war criminals were given lenient sentencing; if any. By 1958 all Japanese war criminals were freed. The Japanese educational system completely ignores and even denies that ANY atrocities took place even today. This denial has been seen by many as an actual admission of guilt.  As far as my familiarity with war goes I feel my 10 years of Military service, half with an Infantry unit and my continued service in a Armoured Reconnaissance unit familiarized me a little bit with warfare.      EDIT: Interesting side note that is often found on TIL: The American military created so many purple hearts in preparation for the invasion of japan and its MASSIVE casualty count that through the remainder of the war, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan and america's other various conflicts the military is STILL using purple heart medals from that stock pile."
ColorizedHistory,2tik8i,dbx99,6,Sat Jan 24 19:43:21 2015 UTC,"The idea in education that none of the atrocities are mentioned isn't enitrely true. At least, most people there know that they were committed.  The problem is in Japan, a large part of the population are aged over 65 years, which means they would have been alive during the imperialistic Japan of WWII. This is reflected by the governing body, led by Shinzo Abe, who's a far-right nationalist.   Alot of the younger people in Japan have the same problem as they do in the United States, where they don't vote in large enough numbers. As a result, most of the people who hold positions in the government are often old, bitter nationalists who hold rather conservative ideals.  If you were to talk to a random adult in Japan, they would most likely not deny the crimes committed during wartime, but of course, nobody is going to sit there and enjoy talking about that kind of issue.  I don't excuse any of the acts by the US or Japan, since both sides did horrible things throughout history, but to think that the Japan of today is the same as the Japan of 70 years ago is inane."
ColorizedHistory,2tik8i,Akoustyk,2,Sat Jan 24 20:35:39 2015 UTC,"Not defending the atrocities of course. But blatantly comparing the Japanese soldiers of the time with German soldiers is not possible. You have no idea how much of a role cultural background and indoctrination plays. They did horrible, horrible things but large scale punishment of all the Japanese soldier would have brought them nowhere. I'm no expert, but I think it would have caused great problems in the year after the war if 1000s strong, fit men where prosecuted. And don't forget that it's still 1946. Human rights for the citizens of (former) colonies isn't really a thing yet. The Dutch for example where busy killing Indonesians after the war.  Your professions training is in no way comparable with how it was to be a soldier in the Japanese empire. And that is a (very) good thing."

ColorizedHistory,2tik8i,gaegagr,-3,Sat Jan 24 23:43:34 2015 UTC,"The reason the americans dropped their bombs on the cities was to be able to properly measure the amount of destruction they would cause.   I would find it hard to believe that a warning shot of such devastating weaponry, would not have been convincing enough a persuasion for surrender.   And if it wasn't, then you could always last resort to dropping a more effective one.   Look at it this way. It would be a safe bet to say that there will be more raping and pillaging, and beheading in war, and experimentation. Not that these are good things by any stretch, obviously. But there may never be anything as devastating as hiroshima and nagasaki ever again. Like you said, those atrocities were the soldiers. Men at war, obviously in war, especially of those sorts, on that scale, it will drive men to do crazy things, and they were probably highly influenced by propaganda as well. But ordering nuclear destruction of entire cities was a comfortable calculated and level headed decision."

At least the guys raping can at least justify it in some capacity due to their emotional states. The guys that decided to level entire cities with nuclear explosives were people like you and me, working in their office, making that calculated, deliberate decision, and planned it for a long time. One crazy soldier rapes one woman. I mean, none of it is in any way good, but nuclear devastation was a couple guys in a board room, deciding to unleash this atrocity on entire cities.   It's not like there wasn't blanket bombing already, but still.   I mean, it's all atrocities. But no, soldiers raping women in a state of warfare does not seem to me worse than destroy an entire city with one bomb which will also unleash large amounts of radiation."

ColorizedHistory,2t6jpa,trifelin,50,Sun Mar 22 17:08:13 2015 UTC,"I'm alright with some constructive criticism. I think most of the painting feel comes from the fact that the people in the back are less contrasted in the photo. The further back they got, the more the color seemed to lay flat. I tried a few things but eventually just ended up with this. It's a subtle change in contrast, but one I was noticing when I was working on it as well. The guys near the bronze star parts stand out to me the most for that reason (blue and bronze are very contrasting). In retrospect I would have gone back to fix that stuff, but I didn't feel like spending a ton of time to do so."

ColorizedHistory,2t6jpa,best_of_badgers,12,Wed Jan 21 19:23:30 2015 UTC,"Mainly for indoor shooting, where an exposure could be several seconds long and people had to hold the pose. Shooting outdoors in full sunlight, the shutter can be a lot faster. These guys were posing, but not holding still for several seconds.  This was probably shot with a field camera. By 1899, cameras had evolved to the point where they used a mechanical shutter behind the lens (same as modern view cameras). The shutter was probably a black card with a slit aperture that used gravity to slide the opening across the field of view for a fraction of a second, top to bottom, as it dropped down. Resulting shutter speed would have been around 1/4""."

It cost $1.   This shot is obviously taken on some higher-quality medium, but you wouldn't need that fancy of a camera for a shot like this. When hand-developing film / glass plates, you can also spend as much time as you want lightening or darkening different areas of the shot (dodging and burning).

Before that bare knuckle boxing was the norm for sanctioned fights. A lot of the techniques and forms had begun to adapt to gloves, but the teaching basis and fundamental image of the boxer was still that of the bare knuckle boxer. The bare knuckle boxer had the low guard with a heavy bladed stance and weight on the rear foot to help protect his body from the opponent because it was incredibly risky to punch at the head without something to support your hands (wraps and gloves.) That's the big reason why you see the lean back posture. If you watch Vale Tudo fights, you see a lot less head shots compared to UFC due to the risk it poses to the hands as well."

I could go buy a shit ton of the cheapest, most nasty (but probably great tasting) hot dogs, some cheap buns and a Costco barrel of mustard and sell hot dogs all day for 82 cents and turn a profit.

The CPI is a statistical estimate constructed using the prices of a sample of representative items whose prices are collected periodically. Sub-indexes and sub-sub-indexes are computed for different categories and sub-categories of goods and services, being combined to produce the overall index with weights reflecting their shares in the total of the consumer expenditures covered by the index. It is one of several price indices calculated by most national statistical agencies. The annual percentage change in a CPI is used as a measure of inflation. A CPI can be used to index (i.e., adjust for the effect of inflation) the real value of wages, salaries, pensions, for regulating prices and for deflating monetary magnitudes to show changes in real values. In most countries, the CPI is, along with the population census and the USA National Income and Product Accounts, one of the most closely watched national economic statistics.

A century later, American schoolchildren are still being taught a simplistic and romanticized version of this history. For many young people, The Jungle is required reading in high-school classes, where they are led to believe that unscrupulous capitalists were routinely tainting our meat, and that moral crusader Upton Sinclair rallied the public and forced government to shift from pusillanimous bystander to heroic do-gooder, valiantly disciplining the marketplace to protect its millions of victims.

Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.  Gilbert: There is one difference. In a democracy, the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can declare wars.  Göring: Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy.

Would HFCS be better if it was in crystalline form?  Why do you think that sugar from beets is necessarily more natural or better than sugar that comes from corn?  I'm just saying.  It's worth more investigation but I'm honestly not sure.  There are other things that it could be too:  -more vehicle use, therefore less walking  -more refined carbohydrates  -GMO potatoes  who knows. But it's super clear there's a difference in the last 40 years.  Rewatch the French Connection or any other movie from the 70s--there are virtually no fat people, and no one we would consider obese."

ColorizedHistory,2pq5wu,UniversalSnip,16,Wed Dec 24 20:03:15 2014 UTC,"Ok, incoming drunk comment.  Here's why It's a Wonderful Life is the most inspirational movie I know of.  This is a movie in which the protagonist is honorable, is loving, is intelligent, and is beaten down by circumstance and reality at every turn. You may have the belief that things turn out well for Stewart's character, George Bailey. You would be wrong. Think critically about how the movie will continue after the cameras are off. He is still in his airless marriage, Potter is still ascendent, and ultimately, nothing has been solved. That's why the movie is legitimately inspiring. It doesn't pretend that things will turn out well if you Do the Right Thing. It says that doing the right thing is itself the object, and that life will continue to harass and ruin you despite your moral fortitude, and that when you receive the respect of those who benefit from your conduct, if you are truly righteous this will be sufficient reward.  That's the cold truth of the matter. That's why even a hardened sufferer of circumstance will recognize something really beautiful in this film. Capra says: when incentives and ethics conflict, choose ethics every time. You will lose. You made the right choice anyway. How many movies are ballsy enough to say good choices are worthwhile even though they fail? Contrastingly, how many movies have you seen in which the ethical protagonist ""wins"" against the odds? In the next few days, after the camera is off, Bailey will continue his battle against all powerful evil, and be no more likely to defeat it than he ever was. And yet, like him, we struggle on, trying to be the best people we can be, even though we know that ultimately we may destroy ourselves in doing so."

ColorizedHistory,2np1yq,noahboah,7,Sat Nov 29 10:34:39 2014 UTC,"It mostly has to do with how so many of the indigenous Chamorros on Sapian helped Japan and the Japanese occupation during the war.  Ask any of the older folks on the island and they'll tell you that Saipanese were considered traitors for a long time, as they either indirectly or directly helped the Japanese occupy the island during the Pacific conquest.  Japanese influence on Saipan also touches base on the Chamorro language. It's the reason why Saipanese Chamorro is significantly different than Guamanian Chamorro. While we have some words adopted from Nippon, like Zories, the Saipanese variation has much, much more (Don't ask me for examples, I wouldn't know).  I may have exaggerated; it's actually not that bad anymore. But ask anyone for a quick run-down of the history and they'll tell you something similar to this (and probably better worded and less ass-talk lol)."

ColorizedHistory,2nemrt,Captain-Cliche,13,Tue Nov 25 20:23:56 2014 UTC,"Stealing this summary (by Doug Banks) from the WWI page:   The 3rd Light Horse Regiment was raised in Adelaide on 17 August 1914. Although most of its recruits were enlisted in South Australia, one of the regiment’s three squadrons was composed of Tasmanians and was raised and trained in Hobart. The two components sailed from their home ports in late October 1914 and arrived in Egypt in the second week of December. Here, they joined the 1st and 2nd Regiments to form the 1st Light Horse Brigade.  The 1st Light Horse Brigade deployed to Gallipoli without its horses and landed there on 12 May 1915, joining the New Zealand and Australian Division. The 3rd Light Horse played a defensive role throughout the campaign and was in reserve when its sister regiments attacked as part of the August offensive. It left Gallipoli on 14 December 1915.  Back in Egypt, the 3rd Light Horse joined the ANZAC Mounted Division. Between January and May 1916, the regiment was deployed to protect the Nile valley from bands of pro-Turkish Senussi Arabs. On 18 May, as part of its parent brigade, it joined the forces defending the Suez Canal. The 1st Light Horse Brigade played a significant role in turning back the Turkish advance on the canal at the battle of Romani on 4 August. In ensuing days the regiments of the brigade participated in the immediate follow-up of the defeated Turks, but were soon withdrawn to rest.  The 3rd Light Horse rejoined the Allied advance across the Sinai in November and was subsequently involved in the fighting to secure the Turkish outposts on the Palestine frontier - Maghdaba on 23 December 1916 and Rafa on 9 January 1917. A stint of protective duty along the line of communications through the Sinai followed. The 3rd’s next major engagement was the abortive second battle of Gaza on 19 April. Gaza finally fell on 7 November, after a wide outflanking move via Beersheba, in which the 1st Light Horse Brigade played a part.  With the capture of Gaza, the Turkish position in southern Palestine collapsed. The 3rd Light Horse Regiment participated in the advance to Jaffa that followed, and was then committed to operations to clear and occupy the west bank of the Jordan River. It was involved in the Amman (24-27 February) and Es Salt (30 April-4 May) raids and the repulse of a major German and Turkish attack on 14 July 1918.  The final British offensive of the campaign was launched along the Mediterranean coast on 19 September 1918, with the ANZAC Mounted Division taking part in a subsidiary effort east of the Jordan aimed at Amman. Turkey surrendered on 30 October 1918. The 3rd Light Horse Regiment sailed for Australia on 16 March 1919 without their horses, which were either shot or transferred to Indian cavalry units.

The soldiers who served in the Lighthorse took this very hard, here's a poem that one of them wrote about it:    I don't think I could stand the thought of my old fancy hack  Just crawling round old Cairo with a 'Gyppo on his back.

Like all poor, Negro and white, they have many unwanted children. This is a cruel evil they urgently need to control. There is scarcely anything more tragic in human life than a child who is not wanted. That which should be a blessing becomes a curse for parent and child. There is nothing inherent in the Negro mentality which creates this condition. Their poverty causes it.

The concept of planned parenthood was based around immigrant and poor families, but that was because they received less education and were the ones harming themselves with illegal and harmful abortions.

ColorizedHistory,2mziij,PhazonZim,2,Sat Nov 22 12:01:16 2014 UTC,"Very true. As someone who considers themselves a feminist, it is harder to hold my head up high with the anti-feminist propaganda, articles, and backlash. There is an article going around facebook titled, ""I am the mother of two children and do not(will not) support feminism"". Essentially, this mother discusses the importance of chivalrous men, respect, and paying the bill without expecting anything in return. These points are excellent, and wanting to raise nice boys is so important. At the same time, this article overlooks large aspects of feminism and puts it in the box of ""radical feminism"". Being aware of how women are sexually assaulted should not make her boys feel ashamed of their penis; it is not the penis' fault, it is the societal expectations of gender. The reason I am a feminist is because of gender performativity, gender expectations, and gender differences. I believe by clumping everything together into humanism, some aspects are missing to each group. Ultimately, I do believe in humanism, but I am not ashamed to say I am a feminist. I believe in women's reproductive rights, I am opposed to rape/sexual assault, and beleive women should not need to ""perform"". At the same time though, I believe men should have fair rights in the court over custody,should have free gender expression, and should not be put in a box of masculinity.  I believe that women should not take advantage of men and recognize that not all men are out to get them. My beliefs truly come down to the social gender constructs of masculinity and femininity. The problem with the article is that she said she wanted her boys to be men, she is reinforcing masculinity and shying them away from feminine attributes. She is agenda setting at a young age. I want to raise my children to respect everyone, whether that be male, female, gay, black, or transgender. It should not matter that they are men, it should matter that they are good people fighting for the greater good."

The most merciful thing that a large family does to one of its infant members is to kill it.   This quote is actually part of a commentary on the dismal infant mortality rate in large families.  A comment on family planning, not a call for child murder.  In context:   Thus we see that the second and third children have a very good chance to live through the first year. Children arriving later have less and less chance, until the twelfth has hardly any chance at all to live twelve months.  This does not complete the case, however, for those who care to go farther into the subject will find that many of those who live for a year die before they reach the age of five.  Many, perhaps, will think it idle to go farther in demonstrating the immorality of large families, but since there is still an abundance of proof at hand, it may be offered for the sake of those who find difficulty in adjusting old-fashioned ideas to the facts. The most merciful thing that the large family does to one of its infant members is to kill it. The same factors which create the terrible infant mortality rate, and which swell the death rate of children between the ages of one and five, operate even more extensively to lower the health rate of the surviving members.   She was an advocate of negative eugenics (which does not include euthanasia or extermination), which no thinking person can advocate, but posting quotes out of context that imply she wanted to murder babies or exterminate black people is an intentional lie."

The fact that you don't see the mercy in that is frankly disturbing to me.   EDIT: She had many disturbing views, and there are much better quotes to pick to actually vilify her.

From her own mouth, Sanger was a racist. From any reasonable perspective, she was a charlatan. 'Negative eugenics' is exactly what people are criticizing all over this thread. There is nothing acceptable about it. For one to be supportive of nazi eugenic programs, you have to be a 'negative eugenicist'. That says nothing at all in her favor.  I also do not give her credit for starting a conversation about reproduction rights, economic disability, feminism in general, or health.

There's nothing 'right wing' about the notion that eugenics, 'positive' or 'negative', sinks your entire political platform. That boils back down to the most insidious notion that all fascists and eugenicists share, that one can be condemned or at least categorized by the circumstances of their birth. You can say she is a product of her time and culture, which is certainly true.

ColorizedHistory,2minhr,Schuultz,9,Mon Nov 17 02:32:17 2014 UTC,I assume if they were white it would be a discernably different shade of grey.  Red is more likely since they match the shade of grey of the uniform.
ColorizedHistory,2minhr,ww2colorizations,8,Mon Nov 17 04:31:17 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I'm not 100% convinced that the artist got the color of the uniform right. Looking at the original, I'm actually more inclined to think it was the standard field grey, rather than the tropical khaki. The khaki looks a lot paler in black & white. Here's a picture of a German POW clearly wearing tropical khaki, also taken by Capa  With that in mind, it might just as well be Jager (green), Panzergrenadier (light green), or even logistics (blue). My money would be on the latter two."
ColorizedHistory,2minhr,misterbrisby,2,Mon Nov 17 06:47:25 2014 UTC,"the artist colored (I believe) a second pattern tropical tunic. It should be a little less brown, but he is close. The thing w/ trop tuincs is that the sun faded them (and soldiers even bleached them in afrika), so colors are hard to tell in photos. But this tropical tunic certainly should not be field grey.  The waffenfabre seen is for artillery, but he forgot to color the litzen too. Overall it Is very difficult to tell the correct waffenfabre in photos like this where no other info can be gained. Arty red is a safe bet in this case"
ColorizedHistory,2minhr,autowikibot,2,Mon Nov 17 06:57:40 2014 UTC,"That's the general idea I was going for, I thought red fit the uniform too.  The problem was I couldn't find any information.

As for the artillery color, I did my hardest to find any information on the image, and all I could find was the source for the image - the Daily Mail/Huff Post article, and even then, they didn't give more information than the title itself, so it was hard.

ColorizedHistory,2ltyae,DanAtkinson,4,Mon Nov 10 06:30:33 2014 UTC,Usually yes. This was because pilots tended to move on to training new pilots after so many missions. However early on in the war there was a lack of pilots for this to happen. But if you were a bomber crew that flew over Germany you much less likely to survive the war.

ColorizedHistory,2lh67y,iwasnotarobot,6,Thu Nov 6 20:01:37 2014 UTC,"Great colouring job!  People don't know what kind of a badass Pasteur is.   His son was killed during the Franco-Prussian war. And Pasteur was quite upset about this. He decided to get revenge on the Germans... with Science! Pasteur's great discoveries as we know are the founding of microbiology. He discovered bacteria and noted that they can invade the body with overwhelming numbers. What did he call these tiny invaders? A name we still use: Germs! And what was the first thing Pasteur set out to do? Kill the germs! The process we now know as Pasteurization--which doesn't completely wipe out all germs--but only mostly kills them is Pasteur's namesake. To this day, more than a hundred years later you'll hear ""disinfect to get rid of germs!""  But we aren't done yet. At the time, Germany had a booming beer export industry, and for good reason. Pasteur studied the little germs carefully. He discovered the role yeast play in the brewing of beer and making of wine. But he know something that the Germans didn't--anything about microbiology. He went on to use his science to identify ideal ways to care for and or manipulate yeast cultures in brewing. Then, once his research was complete he had it published and allow for translations to be made freely in every language EXCEPT German. This meant that other countries suddenly had an advantage over the brewmasters along the Rhine. And it worked! Germany's beer exports actually dropped for a few years. Pasteur had used germs, to screw over the Germans.  tl;dr: don't mess with Pasteur.   Edit: It's been some time since I was in school. And I mixed up some details.  Indeed, Pasteur didn't like Germans much. It was his daughters who died of infection. And not his own son killed by the Germans, but the sons of his countrymen.   Pasteur's scientific triumphs coincided with personal and national tragedy. In 1865 his father died. His two daughters were lost to typhoid fever in 1866. Overworked and grief-stricken, Pasteur suffered a cerebral hemorrhage (a bleeding caused by a broken blood vessel in the brain) in 1868. Part of his left arm and leg were permanently paralyzed. Nevertheless, he pressed on.  Pasteur saw the trains of wounded men coming home from the Franco-German War (1870–71; war fought to prevent unification under German rule). He urged the military medical corps to adopt his theory that disease and infection were caused by microbes. The military medical corps unwillingly agreed to sterilize their instruments and bandages, treating them with heat to kill microbes. The results were spectacular, and in 1873 Pasteur was made a member of the French Academy of Medicine—a remarkable accomplishment for a man without a formal medical degree. Sauce   In working with brewing, Pasteur was employed by the Carlsberg Brewery to improve their beer.   In the 1870s, he began studying the brewing industry to try to help French beers become more competitive against increasing German imports.  His Études sur la bière, published in 1876, demonstrated that the yeast used for beer contained impurities, such as bacteria, moulds and various wild yeasts. sauce2"

EDIT - I was interested in the germ and Germans link. I looked up the etymology of the word germ and it goes back as far as 1640, basically a 'seed'. If Pasteur was using it to refer to Germans, he could have been punning."
ColorizedHistory,2lh67y,iwasnotarobot,4,Thu Nov 6 19:35:39 2014 UTC,"I studied the history of science and technology and the history of beer and brewing was a class there. This came up a couple of times. Once breweries came to understand how important it was to have a biologist around everyone started doing it. It was at the Carlsberg brewery's science lab where Niels Bohr and Verner Heisenberg met. The two went on to become important to the atom bomb research in Germany and at the Manhattan project...

ColorizedHistory,2ldhsp,ZodiacSeven,21,Wed Nov 5 18:18:11 2014 UTC,"On the note of gloves and such, I must say, this photo looks like a staged shot rather than a candid work in progress.  The tattoo area looks incredibly clean - no blood or ink smearing at all around the area, no noticeable swelling or darkness in the original photo either - which is basically an impossible feat.   No matter how you do it, the person getting tattooed is going to bleed, which creates a mess and doesn't look like clear white skin.   You also don't see any wipes or anything else handy, and any tattoo artist (even an OG) would have something around to wipe as he laid ink to skin. When you're tattooing, you end up with ink mixed with blood basically just going everywhere, constantly, so the artist ends up doing a line and then wiping (blotting, really) the fresh line to collect the blood released. That dude has exactly zero blood on his hands, which makes a lot of sense: In a promo shot for some luxury thing, you don't really want to remind the audience 'by the way, this is going to hurt and bleed, a lot'.  On that note and finally, that woman looks far too relaxed. She's not in any apprehension any more because the tattoo is done and healed."
ColorizedHistory,2ldhsp,itty53,6,Thu Nov 6 01:44:45 2014 UTC,"i have never had a tattoo and don't consider myself an expert, but couldn't the artist be doing some minor detailing or touching up after its healed a little?"

Think about it: This is a needle going up and down into your skin at a very fast pace.. but it's not exactly like the tiniest little needle ever. It's big. It's piercing your skin over and over and over.  Take a small safety pin. Poke yourself in the arm with it. It bled, right? Same with a tattoo. It's gonna bleed every time. Sometimes it won't be as much (my artists commented all the time that I didn't ever bleed much) but it's gonna bleed. It gets so that the artist can't see the lines; there's too much blood and ink everywhere. It gets like that quick. So it's a constant battle against that in the form of paper towels.   As a side note, you wouldn't touch up a tattoo after it healed 'a little'. You want to let the whole thing heal completely before going at it again, else you risk scarring and other nasty side-effects."

Intended to serve as a liberation force for British-ruled India, it was made up of Indian prisoners of war and expatriates in Europe. Because of its origins in the Indian independence movement, it was known also as the ""Tiger Legion"", and the ""Azad Hind Fauj"". Initially raised as part of the German Army, it was part of the Waffen-SS from August 1944. Indian independence leader Subhas Chandra Bose initiated the legion's formation, as part of his efforts to win India's independence by waging war against Britain, when he came to Berlin in 1941 seeking German aid. The initial recruits in 1941 were volunteers from the Indian students resident in Germany at the time, and a handful of the Indian prisoners of war who had been captured during the North Africa Campaign. It would later draw a larger number of Indian prisoners of war as volunteers.

ColorizedHistory,2l9blc,hawtdawgspudder,10,Tue Nov 4 16:06:36 2014 UTC,These guys totally had a choice; India had the world's largest all-volunteer army at the time. You couldn't be more wrong.
ColorizedHistory,2l9blc,graspedbythehusk,17,Tue Nov 4 16:24:22 2014 UTC,"You're not wrong that India had the largest volunteer army during world war 2, but you have to consider the factors behind it. Churchills policy was to move all rations and food stocks to Europe to feed the British and their soldiers. Due to this policy millions, literally, starved. Those that lived off the land; farmers, produce exporters, accountants and bookkeepers in farming villiages, or anyone who had menial jobs that relied on the land were forced to find another job. Lo and behold the military was there as an everlasting option.   As far as the Sikhs go, a lot of land was taken the Punjab by the Brits during the canal program and due to the Land Alienation act of 1900, which took land away from specific castes. This land was now leveraged as pension for any Sikh who went abroad and fought. Lump that together with the fact that the Sikh Khalsa army wasa broken up in the late 1800's. Families in India often continue the work of their predecessor, so if your father was a soldier, you're going to be a soldier. After the break up of the Khalsa the soldiers we jobless and forced to take on menial police, guard, or mercinary jobs all over the british kingdom(interestingly the reason there are many Sikhs in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Singapore, and Egypt). So the two world wars were one of the few oppertunities they had to work their real profession.   Charged_Upward is not wrong. The collapse of the British in India came from many fronts; WW2, The Hindustani Socialists, the INC, Gandhi and his fellows, but one of the most important fronts of revolution was the Indian National Army. These were WW2 soldiers who fought in the pacific campiagn and started to realize that they were freeing areas under Japanese control that would be under the same harsh conditions under British control. They realized they were fighting of one form of imperialism for another. So they revolted and it set off a lot of events. Sikhs were very prominent in the revolution with a 1/3 -1/2 of the INA made up by sikhs and most of the Hindustani Socialist party too.  TL;DR They knew they were fighting for imperialism to continue, but British policies forced them to take the job anyway. Sikhs were very active in revolutionary activities too."

There were dozens in the state of Washington, hundreds throughout the country, each testifying to the housing crisis that accompanied the employment crisis of the early 1930s. ""Hooverville"" was a deliberately politicized label, emphasizing that President Herbert Hoover and the Republican Party were to be held responsible for the economic crisis and its miseries. Seattle's main Hooverville was one of the largest, longest-lasting, and best documented in the nation. It stood for ten years, 1931 to 1941. Covering nine acres of public land, it housed a population of up to 1,200, claimed its own community government including an unofficial mayor, and enjoyed the protection of leftwing groups and sympathetic public officials until the land was needed for shipping facilities on the eve of World War II.

ColorizedHistory,2kdc2b,autowikibot,2,Sun Oct 26 21:27:33 2014 UTC,"Section 15. Work of article  William Morris:       William Morris was a prolific writer of poetry, fiction, essays, and translations of ancient and medieval texts. His first poems were published when he was 24 years old, and he was polishing his final novel, The Sundering Flood, at the time of his death. His daughter May's edition of Morris's Collected Works (1910–1915) runs to 24 volumes, and two more were published in 1936.   Morris began publishing poetry and short stories in 1856 through the Oxford and Cambridge Magazine which he founded with his friends and financed while at university. His first volume, The Defence of Guenevere and Other Poems (1858), was the first book of Pre-Raphaelite poetry to be published.  The dark poems, set in a sombre world of violence, were coolly received by the critics, and he was discouraged from publishing more for a number of years. ""The Haystack in the Floods"", one of the poems in that collection, is probably now one of his better-known poems. It is a grimly realistic piece set during the Hundred Years War in which the doomed lovers Jehane and Robert have a last parting in a convincingly portrayed rain-swept countryside.  One early minor poem was ""Masters in this Hall"" (1860), a Christmas carol written to an old French tune.  Another Christmas-themed poem is ""The Snow in the Street"", adapted from ""The Land East of the Sun and West of the Moon"" in The Earthly Paradise.   Morris met Eiríkr Magnússon in 1868, and began to learn the Icelandic language from him.

Inherited a multi-million dollar estate, and kept most of it and lived comfortably until 1993 when she died.   Growing up I had a friend who had mild to moderate asthma. His mom was crazy. Always kept him and his brother from their dad after they divorced. Her dad was a doctor who thought asthma was not real, and always took away his inhaler. Finally the grandfather died and my friend finally got to breathe again. I'm sure my granddad would probably look at some of things we diagnose today and think WTF?"

General Swift instructed General Mullins to drive on through Balete Pass, two and a half miles north of Kapintalan and two miles south of the junction of the Villa Verde Trail and Route 5 at Santa Fe.9. Because of its own success and the concentration of the 2nd Tank Division in front of the 32nd Division, the 25th Division was now responsible for a large part of the area Swift had originally assigned to the 32nd. So far the 25th had not encountered the type of opposition or terrain facing the 32nd. The Puncan Sector Defense Unit had collapsed rather rapidly, and the 85th Division had met no significant resistance between Puncan and Putlan.  The advance was stalled until the 10th of March when the 27th and 161st relieved the 35th and cleared the Japanese from the area. On the 13th of March, I Corps ordered 'Tropic Lightning' to continue its successful advance up Highway 5 to seize the town of Kapintalan, then attack through Balete Pass to the town of Santa Fe. The area was a series of rugged ridges and thick forests, making progress against a determined, well fortified enemy extremely difficult. The Battle of Belete Pass was to prove to be one of the toughest fights the 25th Division faced in WW II, with all three regimental combat teams seeing heavy combat.  (note: the 25th Division, was given it's name, 'Tropic Lightning Division' for its swift combat actions on Guadalcanal)    Original: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Baleta_Pass%2C_near_Baugio%2C_Luzon.jpg  More of my work: https://www.facebook.com/JenosColor"

They were mostly white African normal people who volunteered and knew how to operate vehicles in harsh conditions with no support.  Col. David Stirling came up with the crazy notion that small 4 man self sufficient teams could operate well behind enemy lines to strike key targets, and influence Germany's decision making process.   And so the SAS are born.  The LRDG and SAS reaked bloody havoc in the run up to Tobruk. So much so it turned the tide. Some debate it but the fact Special Forces teams now exist within all modern forces speaks volumes.  The LRDG was disbanded after they took back Northern Africa. A good bunch of the LRDG Officers and Soldiers got recruited into the Special Operations Executive or SOE.  My Grandfather was one of those that was selected to Soldier on with the SOE.   My Grandfather earned his military cross either in Burma or norther Italy. I want to read what he did. I served and know what an MC means.

Public Domain recording, courtesy of Project Gutenberg   Jug ‘Jammie’ Reynolds, also known as ‘The Human Fly’ balances precariously over the edge of the Lansburgh furniture building on 9th NW, Washington DC, 1917 as part of a wider routine including acrobatics. Reynolds toured his daredevil act across the USA, and began his routine by climbing up the building like Spider Man before his acrobatic and balancing displays. Whilst the date of this particular image is dated around 1917, a similar showcase in Carlisle, PA in October 1915 drew a crowd of 1,500 people. The local paper covered the stunt, Reynolds “starting at the awning and landing on the high tower… after reaching it successfully, he placed two tables and on them several chairs,” the article reads. “Then he balanced himself on a chair while people held their breath.”  The restoration took several days on and off, with the glass plate negative itself showing extensive damage to the original coating which needed a lot of care and attention. Often with restoration, the aim is to fix the blemish while retaining the overall shape and texture of the undamaged surroundings. Colour references are taken from modern day images of buildings that have survived and coloured postcards from the time.

No one has ever seen one of these NINA signs because they were extremely rare or nonexistent. The market for female household workers occasionally specified religion or nationality. Newspaper ads for women sometimes did include NINA, but Irish women nevertheless dominated the market for domestics because they provided a reliable supply of an essential service. Newspaper ads for men with NINA were exceedingly rare.  The slogan was commonplace in upper class London by 1820; in 1862 in London there was a song, ""No Irish Need Apply,"" purportedly by a maid looking for work. The song reached America and was modified to depict a man recently arrived in America who sees a NINA ad and confronts and beats up the culprit. The song was an immediate hit, and is the source of the myth. Evidence from the job market shows no significant discrimination against the Irish--on the contrary, employers eagerly sought them out.  Some Americans feared the Irish because of their religion, their use of violence, and their threat to democratic elections. By the Civil War these fears had subsided and there were no efforts to exclude Irish immigrants. The Irish worked in gangs in job sites they could control by force. The NINA slogan told them they had to stick together against the Protestant Enemy, in terms of jobs and politics. The NINA myth justified physical assaults, and persisted because it aided ethnic solidarity. After 1940 the solidarity faded away, yet NINA remained as a memory.""  Source.  TL;DR: NINA is not an example of something that used to be common discrimination, especially not in America."

It is traditionally rooted in the medieval period, and is also evidenced in Irish emigration to other countries like the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Anti-Irish feeling can include both social and cultural discrimination in Ireland itself, such as sectarianism or cultural religious political conflicts in the Troubles of Northern Ireland.  Discrimination and racism towards Irish Travellers, an Irish minority group, is evident in both the Republic of Ireland   and the United Kingdom.  Such racism is open and can be compared to that experienced by the Irish diaspora politics of the 19th century, with the hanging of signs in private establishments in Ireland stating ""No Travellers"" in the same style as ""No Irish Need Apply"".   The European Parliament Committee of Enquiry on racism and xenophobia found them to be amongst the most discriminated-against ethnic groups in Ireland.

These brothers came from a family of paper manufacturers and had noticed ash rising in paper fires. The Montgolfier brothers gave their first public demonstration of their invention on June 4, 1783. After experimenting with unmanned balloons and flights with animals, the first tethered balloon flight with humans on board took place on October 19, 1783 with the scientist Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier, the manufacture manager, Jean-Baptiste Réveillon and Giroud de Villette, at the Folie Titon in Paris.

ColorizedHistory,2irboq,Aleforge,2,Fri Oct 10 06:57:59 2014 UTC,"Something that may not be remembered well is that alot of households didn't have color TV until the late 70's or early 80's.  It wasn't until that era that they ""perfected"" color TV.  It used to be a fussy, complex monster and people with green faces on your screen was common in the US (due to NTSC transmission methods, aka Never Twice the Same Color).  And when you switched from one station to the other, often the phasing was a little bit different and your color settings would change from channel to channel.  Since NTSC is phase-dependent for color decoding, whoops! you have to reset your color adjustments again.    A lot of people preferred not to fuss with it and just stayed with black and white until the end.  Would you believe they sold 25"" black and white console sets as late as 1981?  Another added benefit was that B/W sets were more sensitive in rural areas and less prone to interference."

ColorizedHistory,2irboq,scyther1,4,Thu Oct 9 16:11:10 2014 UTC,That just speaks to the rarity of tvs. I still find it implausible that this kid had never seen tv ever before.

When I was a small boy my dad saw me running around pretending to shoot at people because I was mimicking what I saw on tv, and he didn't like that violence was being absorbed by me at such an early age--so he and my mom got rid of the tv.  We didn't get a tv back in the house until I was 13 or 14. Yet whenever I went over to a friend's house and the tv was on I kind of stared like this boy did.

ColorizedHistory,2irboq,BySumbergsStache,1 point,Thu Oct 9 19:55:23 2014 UTC,"Could be that they didn't have TV in their area until 48.  TV reception didn't proliferate to some rural areas until the mid 50s.  Early TV transmitters weren't that powerful, nor were the receivers very sensitive, and the Korean war caused a freeze on new TV station permits for a while too.    My dad was born in 46 and tells of seeing his first TV about 1952.  It was a western and the picture was very snowy.  The owners were only able to get reception because they lived on top of a mountain.  Even to this day the nearest TV station is 140 miles away, over mountainous terrain so you can imagine how tricky reception was back then.  The nearby ""large"" town, about 40k population similar to where I'd imagine this picture taken, is 70 miles from those transmitters.  Until DBS satellite in the late 90s, to get any TV you had to have a gigantic 10-12' long fringe-area outdoor antenna on a tower about 40' in the air or better, and that was for VHF only, the three major networks plus PBS.  Forget trying to get either of the independent UHF stations, those frequencies just don't travel as well."

There was no sanitation department, and trash was thrown in the street and left there until rain slowly pushed it towards the Hudson. That included sewage, household trash, broken furniture, and dead horses that were left to rot where they fell. Poor children would stand on street corners with brooms, and literally sweep the shit out of your way in exchange for a penny.  The bridge stayed relatively clean because a strong breeze would push trash into the river.   1905 NYC wasn't cleaner because people didn't have iPods or McDonalds wrappers to throw away. It was about as filthy as modern NYC, which was a massive improvement over the filth people lived in a decade earlier, thanks entirely to the establishment of the Sanitation department. People littered far more back then, because WTF else were they supposed to do with their trash? No one was coming to take it away, so they threw it in the street and forgot about it."

For instance, a dress shirt would be worn several times, with just the collar and the cuffs removed to be cleaned.

ColorizedHistory,2ht2u0,damageddude,8,Tue Sep 30 18:40:49 2014 UTC,"That view is towards Manhattan. The building with the two domed towers you can see on the left is the Park Row building.  EDIT: BTW, amazing job."
ColorizedHistory,2ht2u0,boinger,5,Mon Sep 29 18:39:04 2014 UTC,"Huh. They had stairs back then. I'm a bit confused what reconstruction did they do that makes the whole walkway stairless now (after all, there is a bike lane). There is a noticeable change in elevation but I'm curious how the whole thing came about."
ColorizedHistory,2ht2u0,thelastemp,2,Mon Sep 29 19:16:43 2014 UTC,The city either put a ramp over the stairs or removed the stairs entirely and rebuilt that part as a ramp. There was work done in the late 70s/early 80s to the bridge when a cable snapped and killed a jogger but I don't know if that was when the steps were replaced.

ColorizedHistory,2ht2u0,TheElbow,8,Mon Sep 29 19:11:33 2014 UTC,I imagine it is because they were out of focus in the original
ColorizedHistory,2ht2u0,SepiaBubble,1 point,Mon Sep 29 19:15:23 2014 UTC,You are probably right. You can see that the background is actually the part in focus. Plus the photographer was probably using large format film
ColorizedHistory,2ht2u0,xproofx,3,Tue Sep 30 12:10:12 2014 UTC,"This is an experiment that I'll share.  You wake up and you hear the humming of machinery in the distance. You turn to your right to see the dimly lit bulb and you turn it off. No phone. No alarm clock. You get up and shower - interacting with no electronics or information from the outside world. You dress and eat, where you find the news paper delivered possibly to find out what has gone on in the world since you came home the night before.   I mean , maybe they had radio then, but it was not like the radio we know today. It wasn't a simpler time, but it was a less distracted time."

ColorizedHistory,2ht2u0,spattem,1 point,Mon Sep 29 20:42:21 2014 UTC,"it still  kind of like that now except half of the available walkway space is reserved for bikes. I think they should close this bridge to bikes - the manhattan  and the williamsburg bridges, on a bike, are not far away and also have bike lanes."
ColorizedHistory,2ht2u0,IClogToilets,0,Mon Sep 29 18:55:43 2014 UTC,Close the Brooklyn bridge to just bikes. Okay...
ColorizedHistory,2ht2u0,IClogToilets,2,Mon Sep 29 19:54:23 2014 UTC,my comment says the opposite of what you just said.
ColorizedHistory,2ht2u0,damageddude,2,Mon Sep 29 20:23:49 2014 UTC,"Whoops my bad. I read it as ""close the bridge for bikes."" Long day.   I agree, that bridge gets the most foot traffic especially with all of the tourists."
ColorizedHistory,2ht2u0,ShinFuYux,1 point,Mon Sep 29 20:42:09 2014 UTC,So the Brooklyn Bridge carried foot traffic exclusively?
ColorizedHistory,2ht2u0,donkeybuns,3,Mon Sep 29 20:46:04 2014 UTC,the footpath deck looks to be above and between the road decks
