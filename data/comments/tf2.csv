tf2,3e24hg,Armorend,7,Tue Jul 21 14:01:16 2015 UTC,"I had someone tell me the seemingly-high crit ratio of the Half-Zatoichi comes from the fact that your healing is also counted as part of the crit ratio due to the way it's calculated for Medics. So killing people AND healing contribute to it.  Can anyone actually confirm or deny this? It sounds accurate in THEORY, but..."
tf2,3e24hg,neoslith,4,Tue Jul 21 14:36:36 2015 UTC,"I know that every weapon has a set ratio.  As you do more damage, your chance to get a random crit increases. A Soldier who dealt several hundred damage will have more of a chance to deal a random crit than a Heavy who has done no damage.  This is why the Demoman in the clip was getting so many. Sure, that first Sniper kill was a random crit, but there's 195 damage. Second hit wa standard, 65, so we're at 260 damage. Another crit is now at 355 damage dealt.  I don't know the math that goes into it, but that's the basics. But hey, that's what the Snipers get for not running Huntsman or Jarate+Bushwaka."
tf2,3e24hg,Armorend,2,Tue Jul 21 14:42:15 2015 UTC,"No, I am aware that you get a higher crit ratio based on damage done.  But what I'm saying is, the Medic gets higher crit ratio off healing. Not sure if Engi does with dispenser. I'm asking if the same thing happens with Demoman, regarding the full HP given by the Zatoichi."
tf2,3e24hg,Trotim-,9,Tue Jul 21 14:43:44 2015 UTC,Crit chance is not based on healing done. The reason Medics have a higher chance is that the damage done by a healed patient is added to their own damage.

tf2,3e24hg,Armorend,3,Tue Jul 21 14:46:02 2015 UTC,It's the same reason Engineers always crit with the wrench. Crit ratio is based off sentry damage as well as their own.
tf2,3e24hg,Trotim-,2,Tue Jul 21 14:48:06 2015 UTC,"iirc for crit chance calculations, only base damage counts. A random crit melee still only adds 65 damage. That's also why headshots don't make Sniper's SMG or melee crit constantly."

tf2,3e24hg,FrogInShorts,7,Tue Jul 21 14:29:27 2015 UTC,Persian persuader is amazing for maps that have lots of close by supply lockers. It's basically a direct upgrade if you use ammo sparingly.
tf2,3e24hg,TheFlameAlpha,2,Tue Jul 21 16:00:51 2015 UTC,Or use a full Demoknight set.
tf2,3e24hg,FrogInShorts,2,Tue Jul 21 17:20:58 2015 UTC,If you use a full demoknight set then there are better options like eyelander. I'm talking about default demomen using the bottle vs other melees. You aren't going to get close to any melee kills as a true demoman so the passive of extra health for ammo is the bufff vs bottle.
tf2,3e24hg,veggiedefender,5,Tue Jul 21 17:51:34 2015 UTC,Yeah but that's usually not a huge deciding factor. But getting full health after 1 lucky swing at an enemy is kinda broken

tf2,3e24hg,Hellknightx,3,Tue Jul 21 15:10:40 2015 UTC,"It's not just the Zatoichi, but any melee weapon with random crits. The Zatoichi just makes the problem more apparent by giving enormous sustain.   But basically, the problem is this: if you deal 800 or more damage in the last 20 seconds, your melee crit chance goes up to 60%. Crit damage counts towards this number, so the more random crits you get, the faster and higher your random crit chance rises. It's a vicious snowball cycle that can make you an unstoppable juggernaut, especially if you're say... healing to full life after every kill."
tf2,3e24hg,The_MAZZTer,2,Tue Jul 21 15:31:22 2015 UTC,"Look, I know it's considered courteous to melee fight other players with their melee out, but if you see a demoknight coming at you with a bloody Zatoichi and you decide to NOT hit him at a distance but close in with a melee you shouldn't be surprised at the outcome.  Me? I'm tossing some grenades in his face."
tf2,3e24hg,Hellknightx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:37:27 2015 UTC,"I can agree with that. If I see one getting close to me, I'll do my best to not fight him in melee range."
tf2,3e24hg,neoslith,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:06:30 2015 UTC,"But this makes the HZ over powered and un-balanced, in my opinion. For the Demoknight the Honor Bound mechanic means nothing; they don't have any other weapons to switch to.  Going from 32 and then to 175 is insane. Plus if you're a Demoknight, your shields grant you some damage resist (explosive and fire, but not bullet) so you're lasting even longer. Tack on a speed and HP boost from your boots and you're harder to catch.    Granted this is if the player is running a Demoknight, but I rarely find a standard player using the HZ."
tf2,3e24hg,Hellknightx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:58:00 2015 UTC,"True, but this just makes them essentially bigger, less mobile scouts with shorter range and more sustain. They're still hard countered by sentries, so they have to sacrifice the demo's strength at killing sentries for an objective disadvantage."
tf2,3e24hg,neoslith,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:08:50 2015 UTC,"In pubs, people rarely play objectives.  I play 2Fort a lot, I use it as an arena mode. Too often are Demoknights roaming around, swinging at anything that moves.  If my team has a Sentry set up in the Intel Room, that's great! But too often is the courtyard and spawn unprotected so enemies can get up into the base.    I play a lot of Sniper, I love the Huntsman. It's great when Demoknights charge at me and I shoot them in the face. Though the new turning ability makes it a bit harder."

tf2,3e24hg,TeaDrinkingRedditor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:54:16 2015 UTC,Especially when you compare that bonus to the negative effects of something like the eyelander.

tf2,3e24hg,TanningBed,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:10:29 2015 UTC,"What you're looking for is custom HUDs, check huds.tf for those.  The arms are from the console command viewmodel_fov [number]. Usually, viewmodel_fov 90 is a good place to start, but I prefer having it all the way up to viewmodel_fov 120. Just try some different values and choose what you prefer."
tf2,3e24hg,STIDDmuffin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:36:25 2015 UTC,"He probably altered his viewmodel_fov in console. It makes it so that your weapon model takes up less of the screen and is almost like moving the player's eyes back in the merc's head.. All you have to do is open your console and type viewmodel_fov <x> and then enter. The default value is 54, and you can change it to any number I believe (it should be noted that things tend to get pretty distorted at about 120+). It takes some getting used to, but once you raise it you'll never go back. You should also keep in mind that it introduces a few visual anomalies such as spies having three hands and soldiers having rockets magically adhered to the handle of their rocket launcher."

tf2,3dz7vh,seavord,15,Mon Jul 20 22:16:32 2015 UTC,"People like to be able to see more on their screen, or want their health and ammo in a better spot for their eyes."
tf2,3dz7vh,oCrapaCreeper,6,Mon Jul 20 22:46:57 2015 UTC,"Also because some people sit really close to large, high resolution screens, and want to see their health and ammo without moving their head."
tf2,3dz7vh,mechroid,4,Tue Jul 21 01:23:47 2015 UTC,"Because for some people, looking at the bottom right and left of the screen is hard."
tf2,3dz7vh,SileAnimus,7,Mon Jul 20 22:56:20 2015 UTC,"It's more about moving the HUD information more toward the center of the screen.  For most of your gameplay you focus on a very small portion of the center of the screen, and particularly depending on your monitor size and how far away you sit, glancing down to see your health could cost you a fraction of a second which, in an intense and evenly-matched game, could cause your death.  Having the information closer to your crosshair allows for more immediate inspection of your health and ammo levels, without the potential for mis-reading that using your peripheral vision brings (which could also cost you a life)."
tf2,3dz7vh,KoboldCommando,-16,Mon Jul 20 23:30:53 2015 UTC,"It's a placebo effect. It takes you relatively just as long to notice something 5 inches away as something 3 centimeters away on your monitor due to how fast your eyes move. Your eyes do not have a significant difference in speed travelling back and forth between both areas has a significant, noticeable difference due to the human reaction time. It'll still take you .15-.4 seconds to process the data, regardless of the .001 second you save."

tf2,3dzp4h,Nukertallon,14,Tue Jul 21 04:11:53 2015 UTC,"problem is, nobody can really think of any idea that would be both beneficial to the players and valve. I think Valve would have to make an entirely new sought-after item that you can only use refined to craft and you can level it up by adding more ref or something.  who knows, it's unlikely to happen because it's such a complicated issue"
tf2,3dzp4h,Shady_Tradesman,6,Tue Jul 21 05:01:12 2015 UTC,I feel like adding in a couple new usual effects that can only be obtained by crafting hats from metal would be beneficial. Like have a very small chance of getting a hat with a new effect when you craft one from 3 ref.
tf2,3dzp4h,imthescatguy1,7,Tue Jul 21 05:14:30 2015 UTC,The scrap -> unusual thing would be possible!
tf2,3dzp4h,Hellknightx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:05:20 2015 UTC,I like that idea. Although the chance would have to be super low to balance it out. The problems are making something someone wants to sink into and making sure that people will keep sinking metal into it later on.
tf2,3dzp4h,just_a_random_dood,6,Tue Jul 21 07:41:25 2015 UTC,"i thought of turning a few refined metal and a battle scarred weapon into a well worn weapon, repeat for higher quality, and the higher the quality the more metal it takes."

tf2,3dzp4h,SpaghettiJunction,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:42:44 2015 UTC,"Those prices would be going down anyways. Muselk recently did a Gun Mettle unboxing where he kept on saying that ""I'm throwing away hundreds of dollars."" but if he had waited, he could bought a crate and key for the same amount of money he spent on a single case alone.

""M-My computers acting wierd....""  ""What do you mean?""  ""I'm seeing things, that are just not normal. I'm honestly scared for my life, and my parents are out at a halloween party. Can you please come over?""  I head over and knock on Matt's door three times. I could hear panicked person reach the door. Matt answered, and motioned me inside. ""Get in here quick, man.""  I was then pulled inside, as he grabbed my sleeve. He pulled me along to his living room, where he had his pc set up in the corner.  ""Okay Matt, What the fuck's going on with you.""  ""I'm telling you man, I'm seeing things.""  ""Where? What is it?"" He silently extended his arm outwards and pointed at his computer monitor. I took a couple steps toward it and took a good look.   ""W-What is this? Is this Team Fortress Two?"" I asked. I turned my head back to see Matt silently nodding.  It was koth_harvest_event and the computer was left on spectator mode. But there was something odd about it.  My eyes widened. I saw it, right there on the screen. A BFB scout, with full boost, running across the map, IN 560 FPS. There it was again! A rocketjumping soldier soared through the sky, clear as day, with absolutely NO FRAME SKIPS. I could see everything happenning in the game so clearly.   Every fight, every player, every detail in the game, in crisp, clear, and glorious 500+ fps. I stepped backwards.  ""I-Is this.... Source 2?""   ""......No...""  I remember Matt always complained how crappy his pc was when we talked on mumble. There's absolutely no way his pc was like this before.  I grabbed the chair, and quickly tabbed out of the game. I checked TF2's news page through the Steam client, and saw something I will never forget.  October 31, 2015: Patch notes  Team Fortress 2 The Optimization Update!  General :   Updated the localization files Team Fortress Two has been optimized for the first time since release! Every computer potentially will be able to run the game with no more issues.   Gameplay :   Fixed a bug where player's models would cease to render due to Alt+Tab shortcut to the Steam Overlay Fixed a bug where classes could potentially appear to have all of their weapons equipped at the same moment  Fixed a bug where players could appear to use the Conga or Kazotsky Kick Taunt and still be in first person control Fixed a bug where the spy could appear to have 3 arms while reloading and toggling the Dead Ringer Fixed a bug where scouts could outrun their hitbox when using the Baby Face's Blaster and running at full boost Fixed a bug where the Engineer's crotch area lacked a hitbox   I stopped reading after that point. It had appeared that Valve had finally patched everything that wronged this game. And it appears that they have actually done so. I sat back, speechless.  Matt spoke up from behind me. ""We're going to die, aren't we.""  I sighed, and accepted my fate.  I spent the rest of my life at Matt's house, as we moved his computer to the basement, and played for a straight week. We both died from malnutrition and lack of REM sleep."

It's a rumor made by people who don't know how the lag compensation works.  It was created back when the sv_showhitboxes command existed. But the issue with the command was that it showed the server-side hitboxes, but still applied lag compensation. Which made the results for the command extremely easy to misinterpret. See this video for an example of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4RXsDj8bkY This is why the command was later removed from usage.  If you don't believe this, think of how the hitboxes in games such as Team Fortress Classic were rather accurate, even though in that game everyone ran at BFB speed. Yet the game ran an even older version of the Source engine. The whole ""bfb breaks hitboxes"" rumor is false."

tf2,3e0a9s,Zynismus,2,Tue Jul 21 17:43:19 2015 UTC,"I found the rest of the changelog!    Fixed any exploits that could be used to cheat. All hacks are no longer effective. Forever. Fixed framerate hitching caused by Just-In-Time resource loading system (example: weapon skins, sound effects and voice lines) that could potentially interfere with gameplay. Fixed teleporters in the process of building not always being at the proper point of animation if you're looking at them for the first time (they appear to finish building too quickly). Fixed being paired with brain-dead teams in MvM mode if you are a talented player. Reduced file system space requirements by 50%, which will also improve loading times. All custom maps will be converted to new, more efficient file formats when they are first loaded to save disk space. Improved loading process and initial server connection processes. In most cases the loading screen will no longer appear now as the loading process is much faster. Improved netcode. Ping times and bandwidth requirements should be lower across the board. Added training mode for remaining classes. Added training for unlockable weapons that are not stat tweaks of other weapons. Steam trades can now be optionally verified via the mobile app instead of e-mail, to help protect your inventory from account hijacking. You can no longer exploit custom payload maps with dropped weapons to end the round early. Added a new Disguise Kit unlockable item: The Surprise Kit. Spies can now disguise as dispensers. Works like the Box Trot taunt. Disguised dispensers give out no health or ammo or metal, and in fact will leech health, ammo, and metal from targets in range, including sentries. The Spy dispenser cannot bring targets lower than 1 hp. When targeting a Spy dispenser in your reticle, the tooltip indicates it was built by a random Engineer on your team. When in Pyrovision, a new voice response is active: Scouts will randomly cry upon seeing a rainbow. Assists while dueling now only count for half a point, just like in normal gameplay. In an MvM match, if there is at least one low-tour player, all players have a slightly higher chance of getting better loot if they win the match. This encourages veteran players to help new players. Added support for custom announcer packs.  Announcer packs may be purchased from the Mann Co store in Unique quality, or awarded rarely in Strange quality from crates. In the latter case they will track the number of matches won under the guidance of that announcer. Added Redmond/Blutarch Mann, Saxton Hale, and Ms Pauling announcer packs. These are the only packs available for use outside of Halloween/Full Moon/Eternaween mode. Added GlaDOS announcer pack. Item has been awarded in Genuine Strange quality to owners of Portal. Added Cave Johnson, Wheatley, and Corrupted Cores announcer packs. Owners of Portal 2 may choose to receive one of these packs in Genuine Strange quality when starting TF2. Added Stanley Parable announcer pack. Item has been awarded in Genuine Strange quality to owners of the Stanley Parable. A 50% discount on the Mann Co store is available to non-owners who have played the Stanley Parable demo before today.  Added custom hud support to the workshop. Huds can now be automatically updated like any other workshop resource. Added ""Kill Counter"" Strange Part, which can be attached to any strange weapon and shows a kill counter similar to strange painted weapons. This does not take up a Strange Part slot. Action items with visible components can now be used as cosmetics. They cannot be activated with the action slot hotkey in this mode. Canteens used as cosmetics cannot be used in the upgrade center. Added an advanced option to allow the grapple hook to always remain equippable and visible in loadouts even when it cannot be used. Users can now choose at any time to convert old specialized keys into standard keys. This is a one-way conversion and cannot be undone. Added ""Random Defective Product Exchange"" recipe: 3 crates for a Mann Co Bag (same as the one awarded for a $20 Mann Co Store purchase). Open to receive a random item drop. Added ""Bulk Defective Product Exchange"" recipe: 6 crates of the same series for a Mann Co Deluxe Bag (better chance of a rare item).    [Edit:    Added ""Sniper!"" voice command that reuses the voice lines from MvM.    ]"

I'm walking with 2 allies (something like pyro and demo) and in the middle of the map there are rockets flying out of the door on the left. What are my 2 allies doing? Completely ignoring it and are walking to the enemy side. That enemy soldier comes out and attacks me from behind while my 2 allies still ignore it and walk away leaving me dead to some rockets.  I guess it was my fault for stopping for a moment thinking one of the 2 would go in.

Sadly, most of the teams I'd bail on aren't interested in being a team so much as continuing to be the internet's special little snowflake (I'm not changing class, I came to play sniper and don't care about the rest of you, blah blah blah). ""Team"" fortress 2 indeed.  I've tried arguing, reasoning, pleading, cajoling, and even a little well-directed and well-worded raging. It's easier (effort as well as impact on me) just to switch teams and stomp them until the goo runs dry, because apparently object examples directed at their faces are more prescient than listening to the guy with 2k hours tell you that five snipers and four spies is a guaranteed loss against a decent (even mediocre) team.
