GunPorn,3e3eys,axis_z,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:36:55 2015 UTC,How quiet are these?  I've been tossing around the idea of a suppressed .22LR handgun and am not sure if I should get a small semi-automatic like this or a Ruger that I can turn into a single-shot by pressing my thumb against the bolt/slide assembly.
GunPorn,3dyayy,RIAuction,3,Mon Jul 20 15:03:25 2015 UTC,How do you hold one of those? The trigger seems like it's below where your index finger would naturally want to sit.
GunPorn,3dyayy,DarthGuy101,3,Mon Jul 20 18:17:16 2015 UTC,"Just like a regular handgun.  The Bisley's origination is actually that it was designed to be a target pistol.  It's named after a famous gun range in Bisley, England, which still is home to several shooting organizations to this day."
GunPorn,3dyayy,BcookieOmonsterB,3,Mon Jul 20 19:45:25 2015 UTC,Exactly like so.
GunPorn,3dyayy,random_geezer,2,Tue Jul 21 00:30:26 2015 UTC,"The typical SA ""plowhandle"" is designed to roll up in the hand after the shot. The idea was to alleviate some of the recoil. Of course, by modern standards, there wasn't all that much recoil - you can only push a lead bullet so hard before the gases blow by it. In any case, the Bisley was designed to remain in position in the hand which is good for target shooting since you would not have to reposition the grip in your hand after each shot. Or so I""ve been told ..."
GunPorn,3dyayy,chancellorhelmut,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:06:41 2015 UTC,I own an original Bisley (not a flat top unfortunately) the main difference IMHO is that the hammer spur is  lower and you don't have to reposition your hand as much between shots

The company is a whopping 489 years old!! In 1526, the Arsenal of Venice ordered 185 arquebus barrels from Bartolomeo Beretta who was located in Gardone which is about 160 kilometres (approx. 100 miles) from Venice. This makes Beretta the oldest firearm company in the world with its corporate headquarters still in Gardone. The original purchase receipt from 1526 is still said to be stored in the archives of Beretta, by the way.      In this context I should probably rather show a Beretta 92 or a M1915 but I chose the Beretta Cougar 9mm.

GunPorn,3dkfam,bzdelta,4,Fri Jul 17 15:57:46 2015 UTC,"I wrote this post for another thread on the Vickers K in HistoryPorn but I might as well post it here too.    Okay here is an interesting sight. Look at the machine gun on that jeep, if you know WW2 machine guns you'll right away notice it isn't the usual fare like a Browning. No this is a weapon made by the Vickers company, the one that made the famous water cooled gun, this weapon is called the Vickers Gas Operated or GO, sometimes known as the Vickers K.  So what was it used for and why is it on the jeep? Well first off it was an aircraft gun chambered in the standard rifle cartridge .303 and used in by defensive gunners in a flexible mount on ground attack and bomber aircraft. You will notice it uses a pan type drum magazine similar to the old Lewis Guns pan. An excellent way to contain cartridges on a Flexible Gun without mucking around with a belt in a confined space. It's magazine was overly heavy but meant to be stored in vehicles and not carried. Like most aircraft guns it was designed to fire very fast (1200rds/min or 20 per sec) and had no cooling system like water or a changeable barrel because the low temp and high wind at altitude cooled the gun.  Okay so that jeep lacks wings so why is it on it? Well in WW1 aircraft were made with the lightest material available, flew slow and had little margin for extra weight. With new more powerful engines the planes developed towards the Second World War had much more leeway in terms of weight. Air Forces began armoring the most vulnerable parts of the aircraft and with old planes being replaced through attrition with new ones the number of planes vulnerable to small caliber bullets fell. Rifle caliber rounds not only lost their punch but with planes flying faster their range became to short as well. The solution was for planes to up gun, 12-20mm cannons became the new norm.  Interesting right... so why is it on the Jeep? While the Air branches of the waring nations were ditching these rifle caliber guns left and right, they were still embroiled in a massive war and were not about to throw expensive machine guns in the trash. So despite being inferior in many ways to purpose built infantry weapons they began handing them out to troops on the ground because with shortages a poor but working gun is better than none. The Vickers GO along with WW1 left over Lewis Guns armed British jeeps and trucks as well as units that needed to be armed but didn't expect much combat got them like this bipod mounted model used heavily for airfield security and other back line roles, this freed up Bren Guns for the front line.   The British were not the only ones either, most of the waring powers did similar conversions. One well known one was the German MG 15 like the GO it was a high capacity drum loaded (75rd) gun with a high rate of fire and no cooling system. It was fitted with a bipod and stock and saw use in the Germany military and by its allies who had a shortage of guns. Some were even converted to water cooling for Romania.  The World Wars are full of lessons about the importance of Recycling, there are many more than just this, guns, artillery vehicles. I find this aspect of war utterly fascinating but my fingers are tired so maybe another thread."

Together, these elements provide a very large internal volume, easy maintenance on the removable stack, and excellent heat dissipation, all in a package adding less than 3 inches to the already short bullpup.

GunPorn,3ddd87,Laruik,-1,Sat Jul 18 16:59:20 2015 UTC,I never understood suppressed 9mm. Wouldn't 45 be far superior?   I love the look of this though. I would buy it if they made it in 300blk.
GunPorn,3ddd87,dinosaurs_quietly,10,Wed Jul 15 16:13:19 2015 UTC,"It depends what you would define as superior.  The .45 makes a slightly bigger hole, 9mm recoils a bit less.  They both have the same sectional density in terms of ballistic coefficient for the subsonic loading, but for the same weight you can carry considerably more 9mm cartridges.  .300 Blackout would wipe the floor with both of course, same weight and energy as the .45 for the subsonic but a much better ballistic coefficient making it easier to shoot accurately out to longer ranges.  There are conversion kits out there for the Tavor in this caliber."
GunPorn,3ddd87,Laruik,3,Wed Jul 15 16:35:44 2015 UTC,"Does 45 not have considerably higher energy than 9mm at subsonic speeds? It should, considering the weight."
GunPorn,3ddd87,C-C-X-V-I,10,Wed Jul 15 16:55:02 2015 UTC,"Yes - but practically, does it make a difference?  I don't want to get into a 45 vs 9mm debate but I will link to this study that to me shows that when shot placement is taken into account, there is no significant difference between handgun calibers, meaning you're better off choosing the 9mm which recoils less and is therefore easier to shoot accurately."

People should know that what makes the shotgun so powerful is the fact that's it's around 6-8 small caliber balls hitting you, there's a reason why we put so many pellets in a shell instead of something like 3 .45 pellets."
GunPorn,3ddd87,FubarFreak,2,Thu Jul 16 06:59:11 2015 UTC,"Obviously I'm not blaming/accusing you, OP, or necessarily anyone in this thread, but I like how I made a post here once about using a .22 for protection and everyone jumped down my throat that it was the fucking dumbest possible idea, even though I used the same reasoning and guessed the same conclusions that this studies proves to be true: it doesn't really matter what caliber all that much - people don't want to be shot; bullets are deadly and I could squeeze off more rounds; If I wasn't (and I'm not) concerned about a particularly aggressive recipient or barriers, my accuracy and rate of fire would be high and increase the likelihood I could hit a vital, etc... But no,  I was a moron, I didn't know anything about guns, etc.  Still butthurt about it, obviously haha. I've never had such a negative reception anywhere, on any sub... Fuckin internet, man.

GunPorn,3ddd87,dinosaurs_quietly,2,Thu Jul 16 05:14:03 2015 UTC,"Alas internet users are fickle, sometimes it doesn't depend on the content but how and where you present it.    The logic of shot placement being paramount is hard to argue with however.  Shoot someone in the head with a .45, they're dead.  Shoot someone in the leg with a .22, they will probably live.  Keep the same bullet paths but exchange bullets and the results will probably be the same, headshot dies, legshot lives.  By that logic, in terms of tissue damage there is no denying that a single .45 ACP hollowpoint will do a lot more than a humble .22, but how that will affect the target depends 100% on where the shot hits.  This means that say a Five seveN with its 20 round magazine of low recoil flat trajectory ammunition makes it more likely that you will hit your target than a 1911 with its 7 round magazine of high recoil slow slugs, and even though it doesn't feel more powerful, is a better choice for self defense."

Given their use in the military and all the oper8r excitement over ""dis is da gun da seelz use,"" people think that they need military grade equipment. Some have the genuine concept in their mind that they'll actually NEED a SCAR or DMR AR15 in real life to use in combat as a civilian.   Most practical gun accessories and hardware can be had for a reasonable price. Vortex is a great example. You can get a sparc for half the price of an aimpoint micro. The only crucial difference between the two is that the aimpoint micro has been overengineered to the point that it can withstand a fucking direct hit from an RPG. If you're not actually thinking you'll be battling it out with ISIS in your back yard, there are few practical reasons to buy equipment that craz durable.  UNLESS: You are a buy-for-lifer (Vortex has a great warranty, so in terms of optics, this isn't applicable) or just have the cash to spend on that kind of thing. My point is that you don't NEED it."

GunPorn,3dagr0,Noveske,6,Tue Jul 14 20:46:00 2015 UTC,"Yea, I agree to a point with others. It's definitely not a bubba-rifle. Everything is on there proportionately. There's only a couple things I just don't understand. You have a nice Midwest side mount with a rail and a nice Gen 2 Vortex Strikefire with a 30mm ring. Why not just get the midwest 30mm mount? It puts it in the same exact spot as what you have but with less weight.  You put polymer rail covers on a polymer handguard. Why not just get the new MagPul MOE AKM handguard set which is definitely bulged out already like you have on there but actually contoured to your hand?  Finally, you should put this on your barrel.  http://www.kingarmory.com/ka-1230_brake_suppressor_m14x1lh.html"

GunPorn,3dagr0,Noveske,3,Wed Jul 15 02:07:42 2015 UTC,"Yea, but what ""optics"" are you going to put on an AKM, especially a WASR. What you have on there is just fine the way it is and for the concept of a WASR, you shouldn't do anything more. Go ahead if you want to but you're not gonna be gaining anything past what you already have on here.  If you're looking to get a keymod handguard, FUCK the Krebs rail. I don't understand why all these companies make you put a clamp on the barrel. It's a piss poor design if you ask me. I'd want to keep the ability to field strip everything without loosing hex cap screws. Take a look at the Manticore Alfa rail. It is bar none the best rail out there for an AK for how it was intended to be used.  Please don't take this as bad. I'm just saying, that there are better ways to do things."

GunPorn,3dag0a,KamikazeWarDog,3,Tue Jul 14 21:44:45 2015 UTC,Thanks man. I cannot recommend the stock enough. It is fantastic. I mainly got it to begin with because I messed up the original stock somehow while I was taking it apart and needed a new one. I'm glad that I did that because to me the ACR stock feels better and I prefer the way it splits apart to adjust. It also looks quite a bit better I think and drops right into the back of the gun like the regular stock does. I've fallen in love with it and it has made me want to try out their SCAR MREX rail system so I may do that at some point.
GunPorn,3dag0a,KamikazeWarDog,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:12:13 2015 UTC,My next piece is going to be the super scar trigger since I have it setup as a dmr right now but I think the stock is in its future. I had a rail extension on mine but ended up taking it off after a boar hunt and realizing aside from at bench rest I wasn't properly utilizing the weight. All that to say let me know how you enjoy their rail if you get it.

GunPorn,3d9wqa,WyattDerpp,2,Tue Jul 14 20:02:40 2015 UTC,How do you like your P-09?
GunPorn,3d9wqa,HemHaw,2,Tue Jul 14 21:23:53 2015 UTC,"Speaking as someone who is not really a fan of 9mm in general:  I absolutely love it.  Somehow they made it more comfortable than the 75B that I loved, and managed to cram 19+1 rounds in it.  I love shooting what feels like a full mag and still having another 8 rounds to go!  The slide serrations are aggresive, and the controls are perfect.  The trigger is the only thing I'd like to improve, but even that is pretty good as is, and will likely get better with time.  The ergoes aside, I did end up having to make a bit of a unicorn out of mine.  I wanted the FDE version (because I don't prefer all-black guns), but I needed a threaded barrel, and I wanted night sights!  Since they don't sell just the threaded barrel, I got the FDE gun AND the suppressor-ready model and just swapped barrels, selling the suppressor-ready model with the normal barrel for the cost of the normal model.  I shoot it with my Osprey 45 hanging off the end of it, and although it's louder than my FNX 45 Tac (thanks to the supersonic 9mm rounds), it shoots straight as an arrow and handles perfectly.  I couldn't ask for a better gun, again, except the trigger."

GunPorn,3d9wqa,HemHaw,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:36:38 2015 UTC,"It was pretty low effort. I had my Smith do it and it took him only about an hour.  I didn't want to sell something that wouldn't perform because I did it wrong.  The 97 is nice and handsome, but it is heavy as fuck, has no rail, and holds only 10rds. Not sure if they make a threaded barrel for it either, but I am satisfied with my FNX-45. Plus it had a slot for me to spend more money on! (An RMR).  Here are some photos of the P-01 with the can in shitty light:  http://imgur.com/a/Te4HK"
GunPorn,3d9wqa,silentmunky,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:06:23 2015 UTC,"Looks great! I love that frame color too. True, I wish they would change the 97. Tangfolio 10mm witness models look pretty sweet too."
GunPorn,3d9wqa,mrpolarbearman,2,Wed Jul 15 16:22:49 2015 UTC,"I had an EAA Witness 45 with a 22 conversion slide/magazine that I really liked. It was an excellent range gun that worked very reliably. The only flaw was that there was no slide lock back on empty with the 22 slide, but that was forgivable.  The problem was when the slide got a hairline crack starting from the back of the ejection port that was maybe 3/4ths of an inch long.  I had never fired anything other than factory ball ammo (no +P or anything in it) As soon as I noticed it, I sent it in to be replaced. The minute I got the replacement slide back, I sold it.   The good news is I sold it for pretty much what I bought it for over 5 years ago. Paid $509 new, and sold for a cool $500. I gave full disclosure to the new buyer as to why I was selling it.  The bad news is that the new owner put 100 rounds of 45 WWB through it, and the same crack appeared.  As much as I want to love the Witness, and drool uncontrollably at the sight of a Witness match, I can't trust one enough to fire one again without a remote trigger."
GunPorn,3d9wqa,silentmunky,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:20:45 2015 UTC,"I have heard similar stories about the older Witness's as well. I think they have corrected it since then, but WWB is probably not wise haha. I would love a Witness Match in 9mm myself. The platform is great overall.  I have a kadet kit II for my pre-b cz-75 and it is great. I would recommend anyone that can train their ccw get a .22 slide conversion. Hell, it is a great deal even for a range gun lol."

GunPorn,3d9xlf,RAW110,2,Tue Jul 14 17:22:01 2015 UTC,Is that one shell upside down for a specific reason?
GunPorn,3d9xlf,Ddickerson03,2,Tue Jul 14 19:08:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, two reasons; 1: I keep 00 buck in the chamber, and magazine, and the rear 4 slots of the side saddle. The front 2 slots are slugs. Having the second upside down helps me differentiate the slugs in a high stress situation.   2: If I need to do a double slug changeover without using either the buck shot in the chamber or the buck shot 1st out in the magazine, it's easiest for me to to chamber that upside down round and magazine feed the round right side up.  Edit: A video of said double slug changeover without having the rounds opposite directions. Note it's a little sluggish and fumbled.  https://youtu.be/4BvYwzFmn40"

GunPorn,3d9m8s,HemHaw,2,Tue Jul 14 17:58:06 2015 UTC,"If you have no qualms with 380, I really can't recommend this gun enough.  I sold mine when the P938 came out to upgrade to 9mm, and I almost regret it.  The 938 is a good gun too, but it's not as soft shooting or as laser-like as the 238, and the dimensions are not quite as comfortable either.  I have huge hands, and such a tiny gun as the P238 has no business being so comfortable, even without the mag extension."

Not only did it function flawlessly, it was competitively accurate with dedicated competition guns. Light recoil, excellent sights, and a decent trigger really make it, in my opinion a excellent pocket gun. I carry mine 90% of the time in a desantis pocket holster ($25). It is great to throw in the pocket when other guns are not practical. I also have an IWB hybrid and ankle hosted that both see limited use. I highly recommend them. An expensive .380, but worth every penny."

That way I've got at least a fair amount of useage started before I really judge the gun all the way. I've only been able to shoot somewhere between 2-250 rounds as of now. So far though, its been a great starter 1911."
GunPorn,3d68a4,Green_Three,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:14:12 2015 UTC,Cool. I was curious about whether I should start here or at a higher level. Had my eye on an MC Operator.
GunPorn,3d68a4,Magdumped,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:31:15 2015 UTC,"This model is a good starting point to get into 1911's in my opinion. Though like I said, I haven't been able to take it out too much yet. The only thing that isn't great about this out of the box is that the factory magazine could be better. I'm going to pick up a few new ones before my next range trip though so that's not a big deal.   If I were you I would look into a RIA 1911 like mine or maybe a Ruger SR1911 and save yourself a few hundred dollars. Unless you're really desperate for a railed 1911, then I don't see any reason to get that model Springfield."

Recoil is nothing and double stack means the grip is easier to hold on to.  Plus the ability to run a 17 round magazine is useful"

GunPorn,3d4z9c,XA36,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:53:54 2015 UTC,I love this gun. But I am finding the slimness of the grip can be a bit funky to get use to. Since its so rectangular I have a bit of a problem with turning the gun when I pull the trigger. Its something that can be fixed with practice. I'm looking at a glock 19 or Kimber Custom TLE II next.

GunPorn,3d0eye,glitchstutter,7,Sun Jul 12 13:18:01 2015 UTC,Very impressive overhaul of the F88/AUG system.  If only they got rid of that 2-stage trigger.
GunPorn,3d0eye,jinqsi,18,Sun Jul 12 14:06:47 2015 UTC,Instinctively it seems to make sense.  That moment when you need full auto you squeeze harder.
GunPorn,3d0eye,hillbilly_dan,10,Sun Jul 12 14:54:57 2015 UTC,I have never used a two stage trigger so I wouldn't know the downsides I guess.
GunPorn,3d0eye,LooneyDubs,44,Sun Jul 12 14:37:05 2015 UTC,"Ex ADF here  I never had an issue with the two stage trigger on the older F88. The difference in pull between the 2 stages is kind massive so to accidentally go auto is a bees dick away from going full retard. The other thing I liked about it was that it meant the safety was on or off, no 3 position switch. The standard for us was when the rifle was placed on the ground it was right side up and easy to check for the white dot on the back of the safety without needing to move it.  I know the variable trigger (and even quite variable between different rifles) doesn't make for super accurate shooting most of the time but when used with the fairly poor 1.5x built in optic centre of mass was the target rather than being choosy about where to hit them.  there was also a lockout button on the bottom of the trigger (use a round or leatherman to pull it down) which would stop the trigger going to the second pull if you were nervous about it"
GunPorn,3d0eye,The_Canadian,12,Sun Jul 12 16:07:51 2015 UTC,a bees dick away   Easily my new favorite phrase
GunPorn,3d0eye,hillbilly_dan,2,Mon Jul 13 03:30:22 2015 UTC,That actually seems pretty logical. I had no idea that's how the trigger was set up.
GunPorn,3d0eye,The_Canadian,2,Mon Jul 13 02:30:33 2015 UTC,"if you really zoom in on the trigger in that pic you can see a slight cut away on the side near the bottom of it, there is a little black lip there, that is what you pull down with the round or leatherman to engage single shot lock out"
GunPorn,3d0eye,handym12,2,Mon Jul 13 05:03:32 2015 UTC,That's really cool.
GunPorn,3d0eye,Teeth_Paste,-11,Mon Jul 13 05:05:07 2015 UTC,"Neither have I, but I can guess.  The first trigger stage fires in semi- while the second fires in full-auto. I suppose, if you weren't quite sure on the trigger pull you could accidentaly fire in full-auto. Same thing probably applies if you aren't expecting the kick.  Sounds like it's awesome in theory, terrible in practice."
GunPorn,3d0eye,Hovsky,21,Sun Jul 12 14:55:01 2015 UTC,From what I've heard people like the two stage trigger the only problem comes in on the civvie versions where the 2nd stage is just dead trigger movement.

GunPorn,3cy5iv,Michael_Bloomberg_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:10:43 2015 UTC,"My M&P is considered a double action and in no way functions like you have claimed.   By your definition,  my M&P is a single action, yet they clearly market it as a double action."
GunPorn,3cy5iv,theyoungthaddeus,2,Sun Jul 12 17:12:08 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure that's why they call it a double action plus  Edit: To clarify, Double action refers to the hammer. Revolvers are double action because on the first half of the trigger squeeze, it draws the hammer back. The second half of the same squeeze is releasing the hammer. When you rack the slide on a semi it puts the hammer back for you so when you pull the trigger, it's only purpose is to release the hammer. It goes from being double action before the slide is pulled back to single action after. This is how your M&P works (You already knew this) but what makes the LH9 unique is the fact that you can go from double to single action and back just by pulling or pushing the hammer. You cannot do this on your M&P without first pulling the hammer all the way back THEN pressing the trigger while still holding the hammer and slowly letting the hammer forward.   Sorry if i'm misunderstanding and coming off as condescending. I'm just not 100% sure what you mean"
GunPorn,3cy5iv,Michael_Bloomberg_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:03:19 2015 UTC,"You're not,  it's fine.  I still consider it a single action,  as you can't pull the trigger to bring back the firing pin,  and must manually have it already back.   I'm just confused why the industry doesn't specify this further and call it something else. It's always slightly been confusing,  even some people at gun stores didn't understand what it meant."
GunPorn,3cy5iv,theyoungthaddeus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:06:46 2015 UTC,"Is your M&P striker fired? The trigger is supposed to pull the hammer back, not the firing pin. Also, it's considered double action because it is double action capable. Your first shot is double action and your follow up shots are single action. That's how every double action semi works"
GunPorn,3cy5iv,Michael_Bloomberg_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:42:02 2015 UTC,"No,  it absolutely does not work that way.   Not even close.  It is identical to a Glock.  It only releases the triker, it does not pull it back.   It does not function like a Walther double action striker.    Without the striker being back,  the trigger does nothing."
GunPorn,3cy5iv,reddit_is_filth,0,Sun Jul 12 10:56:00 2015 UTC,More commonly referred to as DA/SA or Double Action/Single Action.
GunPorn,3cy5iv,wittewewic,0,Sun Jul 12 22:59:44 2015 UTC,DA/SA is when the first shot is double action and after the gun fires the slide moves backward and cocks the hammer so the rest of the rounds are fired in single action.

GunPorn,3cy5iv,touji,2,Sun Jul 12 06:42:26 2015 UTC,"I ordered the INCOG ECLIPSE IWB from their site. It doesn't have space for an accessory, but it conceals very well. I'd recommend using a 13 round magazine over the 15 since the 13 is flush  The gun does like to stay in the holster. I can hold the holster upside down and I have to give it a hefty shake before the gun to fall out."

GunPorn,3cy5iv,XSlevinn,2,Sun Jul 12 13:47:47 2015 UTC,This gun has been on my want list for a couple of years since I saw it on MAC. I dry fired one in a local store and I HATED the trigger. It was SO LONG. Is it different when firing live ammo? Or is it just the nature of the beast? It just seemed unpleasant and has kind of soured my desire for it :(
GunPorn,3cy5iv,XSlevinn,2,Mon Jul 13 13:34:44 2015 UTC,"The double and single+ triggers are the long modes. Straight single action is short and crisp. Comparing it to an m&p shield is night and day trigger wise, I hate that should (not mine).  In single the trigger pulls a little less than a cm before hitting.. Uh the break? Where it snaps and the hammer falls."
GunPorn,3cy5iv,XSlevinn,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:23:35 2015 UTC,Interesting. Can I mimic the single action in a dry fire? I am not too familiar with their mechanics so when I handled one at my LGS I wasn't aware of how the different functions could be used. If I can mimic it in dry fire then I will go try it again and see if I like it.

This is my Ruger Mark II Target with the bull barrel. Probably my favourite gun to shoot. Little recoil, pinpoint accuracy, versatility, reliability and low ammunition cost make this pistol a winner. I do personally enjoy its classic design a lot too which is basically a mix between the function of the Japanese Nambu pistol coupled with the timeless aesthetics of a Luger Parabellum.  The muzzle device is an own construction, by the way. It doesn’t really reduce felt recoil by a lot. How would it, on a 22? It’s more meant as a fancy, more or less useful thread protector. We do not sell this item but the company Tactical Solutions offers a very similar product if you’re interested.  For more firearm, knife and gear pics check out Sveenys Armory"

As in ""why not just buy M4's"". I'm all for personal freedom and modifying things however you want too, but I can see why this trend is confusing and seems asinine to some.

GunPorn,3cjpyt,The_Canadian,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:37:54 2015 UTC,You're wrong. Most ar15 piston systems only swap the gas key for a cup and the piston has a push rod that pushes against it. They still use the full size bolt carrier group and rely on the buffer and buffer spring to return the bcg to action.  Piston guns that aren't ar15s are more like what you say....

The barrel is very interesting its 3.5 so its like a hybrid Commander/officer and its coned so its not uber heavy. For a small 45 it does not kick too badly so the 9 should be a dream go shoot. The sights are the shit and the stock grips are nice as well.   In short you will love it.

GunPorn,3caymu,SveenysArmory,11,Mon Jul 6 14:20:35 2015 UTC,"May I present you my newly acquired MP5A3 type weapon? It’s a BT96 by Swiss firearm and suppressor manufacturer Brügger & Thomet. These semi-auto rifles are not available for purchase anymore and very sought-after on the used-market, even here in Switzerland. That’s why I instantly purchased it when it showed up.    Actually, B&T didn’t really produce them, that’s why they don’t appear on the list of certified licensed copies by HK. But they still are licensed copies. Why? Because they’re in fact made by MKE in Turkey (and still being produced there to this day) and were imported, refinished and rebranded by Brügger and Thomet. Some had the grey „Ilaflon“ finish known from the SIG 55x type rifles. This one is obviously not one of them as you can see on the picture. I don’t know of any other modifications made by the Swiss company other than rebranding and refinishing. If you know something I’d be highly interested in hearing it.     If you’re interested in more cool firearm pics please check out  Sveenys Armory for more!"
GunPorn,3caymu,pallantides,5,Mon Jul 6 14:21:19 2015 UTC,"Mind if I ask how much it was? Can't check the link at work unfortunately. Been looking for something like this for a while and leaning towards the SIG MPX but if I had the chance to get an MP5 type, that would make me much happier."
GunPorn,3caymu,pallantides,4,Mon Jul 6 15:23:10 2015 UTC,About the equivalent of 2400$ but I dont think its available in the US.   The Zenith Z5P (also made by MKE and available in the US) is basically the same thing and I think it can be SBR'd.
GunPorn,3caymu,Skyrick,3,Mon Jul 6 17:27:32 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, thank you!"
GunPorn,3caymu,pallantides,3,Mon Jul 6 19:16:30 2015 UTC,"Zenith currently imports MKE MP5 clones into the US.  POF also offers a clone made in Pakistan in the US.  Both use HK tooling.  If you want it to look like that one, it would be a SBR and their is a stamp and waiting period.  If you buy a Zenith rifle it will most likely have a modified mag well so that it can't accept more than 10 rounds, but the pistol version (no stock) can use any magazine compatible with the MP5.  But if you are in Switzerland and want that version it will be pricy because of the rarity of it because of the rather small numbers B&T made."
GunPorn,3caymu,superdude4agze,2,Mon Jul 6 15:49:56 2015 UTC,Yeah I sure need to check out Zenith. I might go for double stamps on it (if I ever can afford it).

GunPorn,3c6etz,hotsizzlepancakes,12,Sun Jul 5 16:44:41 2015 UTC,"Cabelas is literally the second-worst representation of the cost of these things, behind only the Springfield Armory MSRP itself.

If you don't care about used, want it broken in already, you can find Walnuts for 1100 on 98% condition.I have never understood why people buy firearms over the counter at places like Cabelas or Dicks.

GunPorn,3c6etz,hotsizzlepancakes,2,Sun Jul 5 18:34:36 2015 UTC,they will negotiate with you and because it's retail where as gun broker you have to take a small leap of faith (yes i understand the verification process's etc) its still a pain in the ass.

Their Scouts are more expensive than where I got mine on gunbroker by 150.00+. And I ordered from a big store.

GunPorn,3c0iy4,Winifreth,8,Fri Jul 3 21:47:55 2015 UTC,It's the designation for the final sniper revision. They made an M1C at the very end of WWII but it had some issues with the scope mount/receiver that affected accuracy. They resolved them and came out with a new sniper called the M1D that primarily saw action in Korea and the beginning of Vietnam.

GunPorn,3bviwp,Styrak,4,Thu Jul 2 16:11:22 2015 UTC,"Good question, I'm guessing it's the US made one but I'll check when I get home."
GunPorn,3bviwp,Sturmgewehr90,2,Thu Jul 2 21:59:04 2015 UTC,If you live in the US and it was less than 10'000$ it was probably a US made one...
GunPorn,3bviwp,eyferrari,4,Fri Jul 3 07:55:23 2015 UTC,that carpet though. I mean damn where can I get one of those to use it as a blanket.

GunPorn,3bwdeo,atomiccheesegod,7,Thu Jul 2 18:19:05 2015 UTC,dat chin weld...
GunPorn,3bwdeo,merkon,2,Fri Jul 3 02:22:32 2015 UTC,when can I get one

GunPorn,3bwdeo,ObviousLobster,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:11:27 2015 UTC,Is Kalash USA going to produce these here in their new US plant?
GunPorn,3bwdeo,malacovics,3,Fri Jul 3 02:13:04 2015 UTC,"Nope, 2 completely different companies"
GunPorn,3bwdeo,AdmiralAckbar86,0,Fri Jul 3 02:32:45 2015 UTC,Really? I also heard that they opened a local US based shop to bypass the import ban.
GunPorn,3bwdeo,pipechap,4,Fri Jul 3 07:40:14 2015 UTC,"No, the US based importer basically just stole their name and is making another shit US AK."
GunPorn,3bwdeo,pipechap,-3,Fri Jul 3 14:32:18 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that. The AK-12 is listed under the series of rifles that Kalashnikov Concern makes, and they are the ones behind Kalashnikov USA.   Izhmash manufactures them, and they are now merged into Kalashnikov Concern."
GunPorn,3bwdeo,pipechap,5,Fri Jul 3 03:12:50 2015 UTC,"Not true. They are 2 completely different entities that have no relation with each other. Kalashnikov Concern was banned by name, it would be extremely illegal for them to simply open a USA branch and call it good. If that was the case im sure Norinco would have opened at least one U.S based plant in the last 20 years to get past their sanctions.  Edit: if you don't believe me you can hear it right from the CEO of KC, he doesnt seem happy that another firm is using the Kalashnikov name however.  http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2015/04/08/exclusive-alexey-krivoruchko-the-ceo-of-the-kalashnikov-group-has-answered-your-questions/"
GunPorn,3bwdeo,PierogiPal,3,Fri Jul 3 03:16:00 2015 UTC,"You'd have to be an idiot to directly affiliate yourself with the US branch, so yes, while there is no ""official"" link between the two companies, Kalashnikov USA is using Russian tooling, they're also using verbatim Saiga designs that came from Kalashnikov Concern.   According to Kelly, Kalashnikov USA plans to manufacture roughly “80 percent” of the firearms currently produced by the factory in Russia.   The official press service of Kalashnikov Concern has announced that they will not be working directly with RWC Group and Kalashnikov USA.    If they actually had nothing to do with each other, they would not have stated very explicitly ""directly"". Just as well, if there wasn't any connection, I'm sure Kalashnikov would try and sue them for using the name, as well as directly copying the Saiga designs, much like Mauser did over the 1903."
GunPorn,3bwdeo,nuclear_ebola,-1,Fri Jul 3 03:23:34 2015 UTC,RWC (now Kalashnikov USA) has been a importer of Russian weapons for years. They have and have had warehouses full of Saigas that they slapped some CAA furniture on and sold for $1000 a piece. And your other points arent even worth contesting because they are so absurd.

GunPorn,3btdrv,rdkingrebel,4,Thu Jul 2 00:36:08 2015 UTC,You could have actually posted a picture of the gun and not just the ground.

GunPorn,3btdrv,mattycakes1077,2,Thu Jul 2 05:11:28 2015 UTC,That's awesome! I've always wanted to see this pattern on an AK since I figured out Partizan existed. Do you know who did the cerakoting?

GunPorn,3bucj8,JakesGunReviews,4,Thu Jul 2 05:40:37 2015 UTC,"I have a question about these.  Carry handle optics, are they extremely limited in what they use? How do you shoot with one?   The a1 is a favorite of mine, but I heard it's a crap rifle to build if it's your only AR (as it would be for me). Thoughts on that?  Looks incredible btw!"
GunPorn,3bucj8,Meziroth,6,Thu Jul 2 12:08:39 2015 UTC,"The a1 is a favorite of mine, but I heard it's a crap rifle to build if it's your only AR (as it would be for me). Thoughts on that?   It really depends, I'm sure the person who told you this probably had an AR with accessories hanging off every inch of his rifle.  If you don't really care about that stuff and just want a simple rifle with iron sights then A1's are great, they are very light, accurate, and fun to shoot.  They can also be built for really cheap, you can basically build one for less than 600 bucks which is amazing for a rifle that will be mainly using Colt parts."
GunPorn,3bucj8,AdmiralAckbar86,2,Thu Jul 2 13:20:29 2015 UTC,"Wow 600? I'll jump on that asap... what's your build sheet look like?  My only concern is I have terrible eyesight, so optics are a must. Any recommendations?  Thanks for the reply.   I use a PSOP on my AK for the rangefinder mostly."
GunPorn,3bucj8,Meziroth,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:34:34 2015 UTC,"The optic on this rifle is a cheap Barska-made optic, 4x with mil dots.  I can look underneath the optic to use the iron sights, which makes zeroing the optic easier.  Once you have the irons zeroed (I zero at 25m for a 25/300m zero), you can put the rifle on a rest/sled, then aim it at a target, say, 50m away or something.  Once you've got the rifle immobile and with its irons resting on the target at 50m or whatever, just adjust the optic until the crosshairs are aiming at the same point the irons are aiming at.  Should get you very close to matching their zeroes.  For some reason, when /u/ok_but and I zeroed this optic at 25yds., we were ~24in. high at 100yds.  After a bunch of retardation on my part, I finally did the ""move the crosshairs to the irons"" technique at 50yds., and now the irons and optic are zeroed to the same distance.  It's kind of like boresighting, but by using the irons instead of looking down the barrel."
GunPorn,3bucj8,TXRazorback,2,Thu Jul 2 15:03:42 2015 UTC,"The gun is cool, but that range is fucking sweet."
GunPorn,3bucj8,TXRazorback,3,Thu Jul 2 12:21:05 2015 UTC,It is one of the better public ranges I've been to.
GunPorn,3bucj8,ok_but,2,Thu Jul 2 15:03:56 2015 UTC,Where is this place?
GunPorn,3bucj8,adirtygerman,4,Thu Jul 2 16:46:02 2015 UTC,"Sugar Creek conservation area in Kirksville, Mo. I'm there every other weekend, in the summers at least. Always fresh paper targets to hand, usually vary little in the way of crowds, and really nice concrete benches."
GunPorn,3bucj8,FroggerCP,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:15:54 2015 UTC,Thats a sweet spot you have there.
GunPorn,3bucj8,FroggerCP,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:56:22 2015 UTC,I remember the A1's with the solid handguards having the 3 pronged flash suppresor.  I don't think the suppresor you have on there was used until we started using the ventelated handguards....  but i could be wrong....  nice gun btw
GunPorn,3bucj8,FroggerCP,0,Sun Jul 12 22:41:10 2015 UTC,M16A1 used a birdcage.  Pre-'A1s used three-prong.
GunPorn,3btzp3,atomiccheesegod,4,Thu Jul 2 03:27:00 2015 UTC,"The stamped body always looks off to me when next to the very high-tech materials/manufactured bits.  I'd love to see a milled AK upper/lower, I've never seen one."
GunPorn,3btzp3,boundone,8,Thu Jul 2 05:15:44 2015 UTC,"AKs use a one piece receiver, not a 2 piece one like a AR15/10. so there isn't a upper or lower technically. and a modern milled AK looks like this"
GunPorn,3btzp3,boundone,2,Thu Jul 2 05:21:22 2015 UTC,"Nice. Thanks, both for the pic and the clarification.  I've never paid much attention to AKs, I just figured the top piece and lower block would fall under 'upper' and 'lower'."
GunPorn,3btzp3,AdmiralAckbar86,3,Thu Jul 2 06:20:07 2015 UTC,"You have probably seen more milled AK's than you realize.  The original AK 47's were all milled, they changed to the stamped receivers in the 60's because it was cheaper and easier to produce and the milled receivers didn't really offer any noticeable benefits."
GunPorn,3btzp3,ghostdigga,4,Thu Jul 2 13:23:16 2015 UTC,When done right I call them AR-47s and AR-74s... this is clearly an ARKomrade-fifteensevenstroika.
GunPorn,3btzp3,UmbrellaResearchCorp,3,Thu Jul 2 03:45:11 2015 UTC,"Even the FSB and other Russian agencies are moving away and have moved away from the traditional ""AK"" look/functionality.   Slapping a rail/keymod/red dot sight is more about making your weapon more effective in a combat situation, than it is about being a Gecko45-esque mall ninja."
GunPorn,3btzp3,alc6379,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:15:32 2015 UTC,I really dig this rail. It makes me want to get a non-Yugo AK variant to open up some of these possibilities to me.
