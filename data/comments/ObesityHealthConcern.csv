ObesityHealthConcern,3a2796,RAndrewOhge,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:28:17 2015 UTC,"TRANSPLANT DRUG HELPS OLD RATS SHED BODY FAT UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA  Original Study: http://biomedgerontology.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/01/22/gerona.glu230.abstract  Posted by Doug Bennett-Florida on June 16, 2015  You are free to share this article under the Attribution 4.0 International license.  A drug commonly used to prevent rejection of organ transplants appears to reduce body fat and appetite in older rats.  The findings have intriguing implications for humans, researchers say.  Aging can cause many changes to the body, including obesity and a loss of lean mass.  With an elderly population that is expected to reach 73 million in the United States by 2030, developing anti-obesity treatments is critical.  While the current findings are limited to rats, the drug rapamycin has potential as a treatment for age-related obesity because it is already used to treat other conditions in people.  “We need to be able to intervene with treatments for older adults,” says Christy Carter, assistant professor of aging and geriatric research at University of Florida.  “They’re going to have health care issues, and not everyone can get up and exercise. So if you can give them a jump-start or combine rapamycin with other therapies, you could have better health outcomes.”  OLD RAT, YOUNG BODY  Obesity among older adults has increased dramatically in the United States during the last 20 years.  More than one-third of people over age 65 are obese, according to a study published in 2012 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  In the first of two studies, published in the Journals of Gerontology, researchers show rapamycin reduces food consumption and body weight.  After being treated with the drug, the body weight of 25-month-old rats—about the equivalent of 65-year-old people—dropped by approximately 13 percent.  The drug works by targeting how the body makes leptin, a hormone produced by fat cells that affects hunger and metabolism.  The researchers hypothesize that the reduction in eating is due to normalizing the typical age-related spike in leptin.  Rapamycin’s ability to stabilize the rats’ leptin level made them lighter.  Overall, there was a dramatic body metamorphosis: rapamycin selectively targeted the fat, allowing the animals to retain lean mass.  It worked so well that the older rats ultimately developed a lean-to-fat ratio similar to that of their younger counterparts.  “In this case, we feel like we restored the body composition to that of a young animal,” Carter says.  DOSE SWEET SPOT  In the second paper, researchers found that small, intermittent amounts of rapamycin produced the desired slimming effect in both young and old rats.  While rapamycin works best in older, obese rats, researchers were encouraged that it also had an effect on certain younger animals.  “One point that is common is that it seems to work better in animals, old or young, that have more fat,” says lead author Philip J. Scarpace, professor of pharmacology.  Getting the correct dose was crucial: Too little of the drug did not reduce obesity, but too much of it caused elevated glucose and fat levels in the blood.  Carter hit the sweet spot in the rats, picking just the right intermittent dose of rapamycin to deliver all of the benefits and none of the unwanted side effects.  The drug works by inhibiting a signaling mechanism known as mTORC1, a protein complex that is an energy and nutrient sensor.  This in turn triggers a response in the brain that curbs eating, effectively reducing age-related fat until the older animals resemble much younger ones.  While rapamycin has yet to be tested in people, the rats were chosen carefully to resemble the aging and obesity pattern of humans, Carter says.  “We’re looking at similarities in longevity, changing body composition and declining physical function—and we’re looking at the same trajectory of age-related obesity.”  Researchers remain unsure whether rapamycin is working in the brain or another part of the body.  Next, Carter says she plans to study whether factors released by muscles play a role in fat metabolism.  The National Institutes of Health and the Medical Research Service of the Department of Veterans Affairs funded the work.

ObesityHealthConcern,39l7jt,Dread_Pirate,15,Fri Jun 12 17:39:12 2015 UTC,"I was a FPH regular.  One thing that FPH showed me, however, that some of the best content wasn't necessarily the ones where fat shaming was central, but those that focused on the serious side of the health issues.  I particularly enjoyed posts by physicians and nurses describing some of their ""in the trenches"" views of the obesity epidemic.  While I suppose the kid in me will always enjoy a good fat joke or even outright shaming, I can easily tone that aspect down to get to the more serious discussion on the health end.  Another thing that fph had, whether you agree with it or not, was some excellent mods.  They worked around the clock to keep the rules of the subreddit and stripped it of content that wasn't appropriate for its purposes.

Resorting to one-up-manship with who can come of with the most clever name for the obese tends to get dull over time.  Fat shaming as a tool to help people is of dubious worth.

The went against society by saying it's not acceptable to be fat, and that those who are fat should be embarassed.   The reddit admins say they aren't censoring ideas, yet they will delete any sub that promotes that idea. This sub only addresses part of the issue, at least in my mind. FPH had a brutal honestly about the issue that isn't replicate elsewhere on reddit. Hopefully we will find a replacement that serves the same purpose."

Only you can do that, too, like /u/Fat_People_Hydra and /u/GenevieveJenkins said. Always remember to burn off what you take in, otherwise things can get out of hand real fast. Exercise can be as simple as taking a walk every day (I like to exercise around dusk) and can last as long as a couple of episodes of your favorite show (I didn't believe it until I did it).   As far as your bf's mom goes, you could start by jokingly telling her your weight has gone up with your proximity to her. She may take it as a compliment bc mothers just love to feed, but at the same time she should know you have limits. I'm sure she'll respect your choice if you tell her you're serious. Left unchecked this could lead to something much harder to reverse.  I like your spirit though! Good luck to you and your fam, cheers to good health :)"

His mother's food is tasty, so you eat too much, and you're not exercising enough to make up the difference. Push the plate away sooner, don't go back for seconds, monitor your portions better, and when you add exercise into the mix (even something as simple as walking for half an hour after work) you should see some weight start to come off. Blaming his mother isn't going to help you lose it. ANY food is bad for you when eastern to excess.

If you tell her that you are trying to eat healthier I'm sure that she will be understanding. Be direct, it's your body, your health, and your life! Make sure to tell her that you love her cooking first, so she doesn't get the wrong idea. If she's a great cook I'm sure she would be more than happy to prepare you healthier meals. Goodluck OP!"

ObesityHealthConcern,39h6j0,Falcrist,722,Fri Jun 12 03:29:10 2015 UTC,My thin husband has genetic hyperlipidemia. The condition is not obesity related.
ObesityHealthConcern,39h6j0,joeythegingercat,238,Fri Jun 12 03:35:14 2015 UTC,"You are correct.  Blood samples like this are not taken from patients with obesity related hyperlipidemia, they are taken from people with genetic hyperlipidemia when triglyceride levels get into the thousands. A normal triglyceride level is around 50-150.  Obese people will generally have levels 200-400.  People with genetic hyperlipidemia >1000."

ObesityHealthConcern,39h6j0,Whoviantattoo,9,Fri Jun 12 00:53:14 2015 UTC,I actually thought FPH was very similar to the anti-smoking ads all over the place in the 90's and 2000's. They showed quite a lot of pretty graphic smoker stuff on TV and it definitely had an effect.
ObesityHealthConcern,39h6j0,gooddaysir,2,Fri Jun 12 02:05:05 2015 UTC,"What I do, and I know all smokers do this.

ObesityHealthConcern,39h6j0,Zebrog,-1,Fri Jun 12 02:02:51 2015 UTC,"There are other subs for motivation. Whatever people claimed about trying to motivate fat people to lose weight is false. The purpose of that sub was to make fun of fat people and release frustration of having to be exposed to extreme cases of entitlement and fat acceptance in our day to day lives. It was basically a place to vent and make jokes in a safe environment where we wouldn't be persecuted for hurting anyone's feelings, because today everyone seems to have the ""everybody gets a trophy and everybody is a winner"" mentality. Apparently being fat to SJW's is equivalent to being homosexual or a minority. It's literally laughable how entitled the tumblrinas are that we made fun of.  But look at yourselves before you damn FPH and our ideals. Ask yourself: how can you not want to live as the best version of yourself. How can you try and have the WORLD accept YOU instead of changing yourself for the better. It's the ""everybody gets a trophy"" mentality hard at work. You don't  think it's disheartening and pitiful that a wonderfully complex human could willingly trash his/her body and, instead of getting the fire in their heart to snap out of it and change their situation, they instead put effort into having the world fit them. ""I am beautiful because I say so!"" That's what we make fun of. We make fun of the shit lives they lead because they try and force it upon us and make it something that it's clearly not.  And I know someone will throw out the classic fat sympathizer comeback: ""but shaming isn't helping anyone. It's not encouraging."" So what. It was never our purpose. And besides, even if we were trying to get them motivated, they're fucking weak. They want the world to accept them? fucking fight for it. Oh you're working on it? You're currently losing weight? Fuck you, we don't care. You're not a millionaire at half a million dollars. You're not a champion in the middle of playoffs. Just lose the weight and respect your body enough not to trash it again. You may think we're harsh, but society is suffering and buckling under the weight of fat people and we're sick of it."
ObesityHealthConcern,39h6j0,DangerousDetlef,2,Fri Jun 12 01:19:12 2015 UTC,"It's not only the shaming part and it's not about ""everyone is a unique snowflake and should be liked as he/she is"". Most people know that this is bullshit, that HAES is bullshit, and so on. No, being fat is not healthy, even most obese persons know that.  But what FPH is doing is just hating on a group of people, literally dehumanizing them for being fat. Posting pictures of fat people they know nothing about, shaming them, hating them in the comments. Recently this went even as far as posting pictures of fat people exercising (one on a bike, one swimming as far as I remember) and making fun of them.  What most FPHlers don't see is the damage they're doing by this. Imagine how a fat person who tries to exercise and lose weight would feel about being publicly ridiculed for doing so. Motivated? I think not.  The point is also that, yes, everyone is responsible for his weight and the trying to explain obesity with ""genetics"" and ""big bones"" is utter crap. But when looking into the background of an obese person, there's often more to it than just laziness and stupidity. An eating disorder is a medical condition often caused by psychological problems, for example depressions or anxieties. Being anorexic is just them same on the opposite end with a psychological malfunction being the cause more often than not.  Obese people (and people in general) need to be educated about that and, if necessary, get professional help treating that. More often than not it is also something that runs in the family and they don't know better because it always was this way since they were children. There's nothing to be gained in ridiculing and dehumanizing them. It demotivates people, it even encourages active resistance because of the attitude and yes, it even promotes HAES (never heard of it before FPH, at least here in Germany).   Even setting aside all that, it's a dangerous route to travel down. Making a politically incorrect joke just to shock or laugh is one thing but using this to create general hatred against other humans is dangerous."
ObesityHealthConcern,39h6j0,QUSHY,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:26:15 2015 UTC,"Yea, right, most people know it's unhealthy. But we are openly mocking those that DONT (aka those ""special snowflake"" characters you mentioned) because they're the ones rubbing it in our face.  And if you were to read my comment you would see that MOTIVATION IS NOT OUR JOB AND NOT OUR INTENTION. since when did fat people all start coming to r/fatpeoplehate to seek out motivation? If you don't like what we have to say, don't expose yourself to it. EVERYONE is entitled to their opinions.   And yes, we mocked people from social media and in gyms and whatnot. But guess what? Every post was monitored and our mods had strict rules against showing identifying information and brigading and threatening people.  It was about expressing our frustrations and making jokes. It feels like you're making us out to be a hate group who was hell bent on exterminating the fats. You're basically saying its a slippery fucking slope because you must think we're sociopaths or something. Have you seen a post in FPH where our members were assaulting or physically harming any fat person? Because as a subscriber, I have personally never seen anything like that and would honestly dislike it.  IT WAS OUR SAFE HAVEN TO EXPRESS HOW WE FEEL. it was contained. It was in a place where everyone could see it, but choose not to dwell if they were uncomfortable. And here's the difference about us and hate groups. We hate a group of people that are willfully destroying their own lives (even you admitted you knew it wasn't healthy, so wtf are they doing? How can you not see the ridiculousness), trying to change society's view on obesity (so an attempt to brainwash everyone into thinking fat = beautiful and healthy and strong), and have the ability to lose weight but are too lazy/too stupid to realize how fucking easy it is to close your fucking gullet and move around more than usual.  I can't believe people still compare us to hate groups. Do you realize how awful that is? SJWs compare fat shaming to racism or sexism or homophobia. Is that a fucking joke? Those groups CANNOT CHANGE those qualities about themselves. Fatties on the other hand have the power to, but choose it'd be easier to just whine and shit all over the Internet about the things they're entitled to. I don't fucking care for em. I will ridicule them til the day I die because they're making our species look like a fucking joke. They disrespect our wonderful, complex, and useful bodies by making them bloated and unusable. They take up room, weigh shit down, hold people up, and get in the way. They're a hazard to society.  They have the power to make society better for everyone but many of them choose to be dumbass HAES enthusiasts. So until they get it through their fat skulls that they can help society I'm going to mock them and laugh at how they try to force their beliefs on others  Edit: on mobile so I couldn't reference your post while writing so sorry if I get a little off topic haha. I saw you mentioned eating disorders. Every fatty and their fat mothers claimed they have eating disorders. While eating disorders are awful and many of our FPH subscribers even dealt with them, how many people can you honestly say has one. Can you honestly say that the 2/3 of America who are overweight has an eating disorder? Even the 1/3 of the obese? While I respect that there are people with eating disorders who struggle with weight:   It's certainly not the majority of people who are overweight who have them Preventable with treatment. And that's not an asshole comment. I'm not making a joke or trying to invalidate eating disorder problems. You can get treated for it."
ObesityHealthConcern,39h6j0,poopsmith666,-4,Fri Jun 12 04:27:43 2015 UTC,Honestly they couldn't give a shit less if people lose weight. They probably don't want fat people to lose weight cuz then they couldn't make fun of them.

ObesityHealthConcern,39h6j0,exadrid,14,Fri Jun 12 04:56:16 2015 UTC,"The fat acceptance movement is just plain not understood on reddit. The whole point of it is just that fat people are people and you should be as nice to them as you are to anyone, not that it's healthy to be fat. Even the much maligned Health At Every Size movement is about making lifestyle changes for your health as opposed to because you feel pressured by society. The number of people who legitimately think it's perfectly healthy to be fat could probably fit in a high school classroom."

ObesityHealthConcern,39h6j0,Treyantula,2,Thu Jun 11 23:45:56 2015 UTC,"It can be - LDL receptor mutations are associated mainly with the genetic forms of high cholesterol (which are technically a type of hyperlipidemia).  In general, the mutations that cause high lipids, triglycerides, and cholesterol are associated with the transport of fat from the intestines where  they are first absorbed into the liver where they are processed.  To simplify, the mutations lock the fats (inside  a carrier molecule) into a confirmation that is not readily broken down by the liver and therefore cause accumulation in the blood stream."

They were really abusive to their cars and had to get a new one every year or two but they financed them and would get the most basic automatic they could get. One day we went on a trip with them and of course, we were riding in the back seat. You know when you go over a bridge on the interstate at high speeds and you hear a little thud as you hit the first part? Well I wasn't hearing a little thud, I was hearing and feeling a ""wham!"" each time. So halfway home I peak over her shoulder and see that she's doing 90mph. After this, I started getting really scared that we were going to have an accident, their seats would break, and they would crush us. Each time we came to a bridge, I would brace myself, worried that one wham would eventually result in a blown tire and kill us. We didn't ride in the car with them after that."

It is true that old age medical care is expensive, and the obese will die before reaching this stage. However the question is whether or not, due to their unhealthy living, their mid age costs are comparable to the old age costs of the healthy. The obese often will become diabetic, for example and many develop serious instances of necrosis or other such problems.   So while old age cost is extremely high, perhaps the obese are not any less expensive despite their shorter lifespans."

I dont  think you're right.  It looks like the number is there, regardless of lifespan.  If anything, we need to look at their lifetime costs.  Even at, say 50 yrs max, needing obesity health coverage starting around age 18, so 32 years of obese medical care that would otherwise not be spent on a healthy sized person.  People choosing healthy lifestyles can get other diseases like cancer.  these usually show up late in life, and either quickly kill the poor affected person, or they are quickly cured (whatever the medical term is....remission, something like that).  Once cured, that healthy  person still wont need the 'health' support a fatty would need.  So, fatties and normies both need some parts of medical services, so we'll ignore that (cancer care, infectious disease, flu, the like).  Only the fatties, however, need medical services to counteract their poor lifestlye choices causing bone and joint failure/pain, bad backs and necks, and poor circulation and affected ailments due to Type 2."

ObesityHealthConcern,39dymx,Nayr747,-2,Thu Jun 11 11:13:27 2015 UTC,Whole grains are not insanely high in calories. Carbs have the lowest calorie density of any food at 4 calories per gram. Fat has more than double that.
ObesityHealthConcern,39dymx,flacciddick,2,Thu Jun 11 15:19:21 2015 UTC,Protein does after calculating the metabolic rate needed to process it. Pure protein is as high as 30% of intake energy.
ObesityHealthConcern,39dymx,xitssammi,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:13:43 2015 UTC,"Processed food of any type will always be higher in calories than the amount of nutrition and energy it delivers. Also, the energy acquired from carbs will be burned off very quickly, thus making you much hungrier.   Imo, we need to teach kids how to eat to their needs. If they are very active, carbohydrate is okay (55% of calories). If they aren't active, energy should come from fats because they are slow burning (carb % would be at around 30% in this case, fats 45% or so). Protein should always be in every meal because it is necessary for building amino acids &amp;amp; proteins in your body, and a ton of other functions."
ObesityHealthConcern,39dymx,Nayr747,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:48:20 2015 UTC,"Processed food of any type will always be higher in calories than the amount of nutrition and energy it delivers.   I'm not sure what you're trying to say here. Food energy is calories. A Calorie is just a unit of energy. 4 calories of potatoes provides the same energy as 4 calories of steak.  Activity level changes should be matched with calorie intake, not macronutrient changes. If you expend less energy you should intake less energy. That should just naturally happen. You shouldn't feel as hungry if you don't do as much work.  I think people should just eat whole foods which provide the combination of macronutrients, vitamins, minerals, etc. that we've evolved to eat. Carbs, protein, and fat don't exist in isolation naturally. Even things like bananas, tomatoes, spinach, etc. have a combination of carbs, protein, and fat. Most people just assume they're one or the other though."
ObesityHealthConcern,39dymx,xitssammi,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:57:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly I am relaying information that my personal trainer relayed to me that worked the best, as well as a lot of the information I've learned from doing my own research. This method works very well too, but the way that I see it, managing your macronutrient intake to energy needs works a lot better as far as making you feel better and also aiding in weight loss. You need to be able to make it through the day without insane blood sugar drop offs or spikes.   Saying that the macronutrients don't impact your body differently is off because your body NEEDS fat and protein, too, and people on low calorie diets tend to overly ignore both of those categories. That is the only reason why I encourage people to count macros based on a caloric baseline.   MyFitnessPal will let you put in a calorie goal and you can edit your macros to make sure you're eating enough of each item."
ObesityHealthConcern,39dymx,Nayr747,2,Thu Jun 11 13:05:00 2015 UTC,"The highest RDI for protein in the US, Canada, and Europe is 56 grams per day (224 calories). You'll need more if you're actually trying to build muscle since that's what it's used for, but you really don't need as much as most people think. There's a big protein fad going on right now, but Americans have been getting way more protein than recommended for a long time. If you eat enough whole foods to meet your calorie needs you're guaranteed to get enough of every macronutrient. You could eat nothing but plain potatoes and you'd not only get more than that 56g protein, but more than enough of every amino acid too. The food recommendations of every developed country are generally the same: mainly veggies, fruits, and grains, with some meat and dairy or soy milk, and minimal fats with a high percentage of that unsaturated fats (mainly from plants). That's the diet that the long-standing science supports as healthiest for the average person."

ObesityHealthConcern,39dm6b,SmoothPrimal,11,Thu Jun 11 11:45:11 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for others, but personally I hate that it's an ""acceptance"" movement.   Like everything has to be ""fixed"" to accommodate obese people. Otherwise it's discriminatory. It's treating obesity like a gender or skin color (or un treatable handicap).   Yes very few people can't help it, but for the vast majority it's ""I tried a diet for a week, it nearly killed me, and I didn't lose weight. I just can't do it, I've tried"".   Losing weight is a bit (and only a bit) like treating an addiction. There are similarities. Of course the two are vastly different, but you can draw a few parallels.   Anyway obesity is entirely fixable (in almost every case), it just comes down to the persons lack of effort and lack of support around them.   So yeah, I won't treat you any differently because you're fat. I will treat you like any man woman, black, gay, trans or anything. That is, not specially. (Of course with the way the world is moving, you have to treat them specially otherwise it's discriminatory)  On top of that, as I said, you can lose weight. You can't easily and practically change gender, skin color, or sexual orientation.   So the question is, why do people make such a big fuss about being politically correct towards obese persons? Tact should be a basic courtesy, but should we really say it's okay and totally fine to be fat? It carries many negative health effects, and really we shouldn't be touting it as ""okay"" (or normal, which ever word you prefer).   These people are still human and deserve to be treated as such. But I don't believe we should say ""oh yeah it's totally fine (as in healthy and not negative) to be obese"" especially when it's easily fixable and avoidable.   Beyond this point it becomes a rather deep and sophisticated issue I don't want to talk about (and quite frankly don't know how to), about societal opinions, food, raising children, the state of education and easy access to refined sugary nutritionally worthless meals etc."

ObesityHealthConcern,39dm6b,Lepontine,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:47:16 2015 UTC,"I wish people made as many accommodations for autistic people as they do for obese people. I don't think it's okay to go around insulting people for being overweight or obese with no empathy for their situation, but when any comment even to friends and family on the health problems resulting from it (like you would for those which result from alcoholism and anorexia) are taken as ""hating"" them it's just ridiculous. I think that pushes some people to toxic places like the subreddits recently banned, like (but not equivalent to) when working class people worried about immigration are told they're racist so they eventually turn to actual racist groups (though obviously some people are just hateful).  I'm autistic, I was born that way, I'm openly ridiculed all the time and expected to just get over everything by myself and adapt to function in our society as it is (not the other way around).  Fat people shouldn't be ridiculed. But it frustrates me when some of the people who fall into the subcultures like ""HAES"" demand, and get, so many accommodations that people who are born with disabilities or became disabled as a result of an accident or severe illness don't get.  And I've been told multiple times that I'm not a ""real woman"" because I'm a healthy size, I don't like that any more than they like being insulted, but apparently ""skinny shamming"" is impossible because I'm just ""privileged""."
ObesityHealthConcern,39dm6b,DragonTamerMCT,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:56:57 2015 UTC,"You manage autism, you 'cure' obesity (by managing weight, yes, but you fix the problem).   There's an inherent difference.   As to being ridiculed for being too thin, well body image is a tricky human concept (for both genders). But in general people will always find a way to be dicks to you. Don't let it get you down. Even if it's hard."
ObesityHealthConcern,39dm6b,Mat145,2,Fri Jun 12 14:52:05 2015 UTC,"You manage autism, you 'cure' obesity (by managing weight, yes, but you fix the problem).    Yeah that point I was trying to make. Obesity is largely a lifestyle problem, but they get so many accommodations, and some people are so demanding about being accommodated to because of their weight while people with other disabilities (not self inflicted) are expected to adapt.  It doesn't get me down, I'm well aware of how terrible people, I just find it annoying.  I understand that our food industries etc are unhealthy and make it more difficult for people, it's also a social problem, thats why so many people are obese now, human nature didn't suddenly change in the last few generations, but for something that can be ""fixed"" that is literally caused by putting too much food in their mouths while the rest of us get almost nothing, is frustrating. I get social pressure to change as well, but you wouldn't think that from how ""HAES"" people (who don't represent all fat or obese people) talk. There should be a huge public health effort to fight the problem and help people, not acceptance of it (which won't happen of course, because there's too much money to be made the way things are)."

The difference in presence of myelin in white and gray matter is actually quite important for MRI imaging  Edit: word

There's a whole host of subreddits devoted to just posting stuff other people post online, and then making fun of them.

Or posting about losing 1kg in 2 months, which clearly shows no effort was made and they just want the praise for trying.

ObesityHealthConcern,39dn2k,RubberDuckDown,11,Thu Jun 11 12:49:42 2015 UTC,"I think OP's point (hopefully) is that fighting against the ""fat acceptance movement"", even in a stupid, extremely toxic way like FPH, is important because societal acceptance of something as unhealthy as obesity if not good for humanity. Because honestly, from an objective, medical perspective  the ""fat acceptance movement"" is on par with smoking being socially acceptable, a great way to perpetuate and reinforce unhealthy behaviors within society.   Also, no one will literally force you to be skinny in a more neutral society, but shaming is an important tool for reinforcing healthy behaviors within society. However, the opposite end of the spectrum is equally bad, so although we shouldn't have ""fat acceptance"", we also shouldn't go too far in the other direction."

ObesityHealthConcern,39dn2k,sbowesuk,0,Thu Jun 11 06:56:36 2015 UTC,"The ""fat acceptance"" movement is much larger, I don't know what type of media you consume but the general media, namely the vast majority of the Associated Press, is solidly behind ""fat acceptance"".   Obviously FPH was a very toxic way to address the ""fat acceptance"" movement, but its simply an extreme reaction to the extreme elements of ""fat acceptance"", like saying being morbidly obese is OK and even beautiful. The truth is the extremists of the ""fat acceptance"" movement and the haters on FPH are both on different ends of the spectrum and equally illogical and terrible. We shouldn't tell people it's OK to be fat because it encourages unhealthy behavior, but we shouldn't hate them either, I think there is a healthy median that our society is unfortunately sliding away from."
ObesityHealthConcern,39dn2k,GrammerNaziParadox,2,Thu Jun 11 20:38:30 2015 UTC,"I agree, the purpose of FPH I feel wasn't to motivate any individuals or to spiral out of control the way it did. The purpose was, to me, to bring a viewpoint which exacerbated the HAES movement. I understand about the hurting people, but I also think certain things need to change in our society. For instance, everyone being so PC that people actually print HAES bullshit. This happens everywhere now, the lack of discussing matters that might hurt someone's feelings. FPH was fucking retarded, but it was so because HAES and the general overly tolerant nature of our society today is equally fucking retarded."
ObesityHealthConcern,39dn2k,Axxcess,2,Thu Jun 11 08:47:48 2015 UTC,"Unhealthy eating habits are often fueled by things like stress, depression and low self esteem.  ""Shaming"" someone isn't helping anyone.  If anything its making things worse for them.  People aren't stupid.  Nobody thinks being fat is healthy and nobody decides to be overweight.  I used to smoke.  I started when I was a young stupid teenager and it took me 20 years to quit.  I have probably been told 100,000 times ""those things will kill you"".  I'm not fucking stupid I know that.  Repeating it to me didn't make me more likely to quit.  And people aren't being as cruel as they can to someone about their weight because they're worried about their health and want to fight against the ""fat acceptance movement"".  They are just mean bastards and bullies that enjoy hurting people.  Don't try to justify that behavior.    p.s. Reddit shouldn't censor anyone and shouldn't be removing whole subreddits.  Its reddit.  The whole idea I thought was that this was a totally free place as long as its legal.  And the way it works you can subscribe to just the content you want to see and customize reddit anyway you want.  Nobody has to look at the offensive stuff if they don't want.  The only reason I even know any of this is happening is I click ""all"" every once in a while.  None of my subscribed subreddits are talking about any of this."

There are people that BELIEVE in that stuff! /s  Despite the fact, of course, that people who believe obesity can be healthy are very obviously in denial, and constantly berating someone who's stubborn enough to subscribe to such ridiculous bullshit is obviously just going to cause them to burrow even deeper into their own denial.  /r/fatpeoplehate literally just wanted someone to hate.

ObesityHealthConcern,39dn2k,Moonchopper,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:41:56 2015 UTC,"Shaming is a pretty effective tactic to prevent negative behavior in society, maybe you don't think so, but most people care about the opinions of their peers and will alter behavior that gets berated with negativity. Even if you think shaming is an ineffective tactic for preventing bad behavior, encouraging it like the ""fat acceptance"" movement does is certainly not the answer. Maybe we should not shame fat people, but there is no way that we should glorify them and say that living in such an unhealthy way is all fine and dandy. Instead, there should be objective interpretation of the pros and cons of peoples' health decisions instead of tip-toeing around their feelings. Because honestly, I would rather have my feelings hurt as an obese 30 year old than die of a heart attack at 45 because people said it was fine for me to be fat."

If FPH wasnt about posting candid pics and making fun of people by insisting they are subhuman and should die instead of trying to lose weight (seriously guys?) then maybe just maybe your stupid sub would still be up. But no. You guys would literally say fat people should be rounded up en masse and murdered, and that's not even what got you banned. What got you banned was the doxxing and the idea that threatening the sister site of reddit would be a good idea.   Blame your retard mods and their failure to keep the sub in check.

ObesityHealthConcern,39dn2k,WowzaCannedSpam,22,Thu Jun 11 06:21:41 2015 UTC,"I was subbed to FPH, and I agree with you. It started out as more of an anti-HAES/fat acceptance subreddit (like a more aggressive Fatlogic), but as it grew, it changed into something more sinister. It went from people venting their frustration at the ever-increasing FA movement/thin-shaming/obesity epidemic to people bragging about how fit/healthy they are and making Tess Holliday jokes.  When people started posting the candid pics, and frequently hating on people actively attempting weight loss, I started to lose interest. I never hated fat people. I hate what obesity is doing to this country, this world. I hate people who actively promote obesity and spread lies that one can be healthy and fat. Most of my family is fat. I love them. I HATE watching them destroy themselves.   The mods were actually usually really strict about doxxing/brigading/personal info (granted, things are bound to slip under the radar with such a huge subreddit) though.

ObesityHealthConcern,39dn2k,goofball_jones,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:44:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree with you how was a subreddit that literally stating in it's title hate trying to help fat people. Honestly I would love a subreddit that was trying to help fat people and make a change. There should be an r/fatepeople help. All the people who were on r/fatpeoplehate  were just making fun of fate people and degrading them which would make things worse because eating disorders are fueled by insecurities caused by negative comments. If they truly wanted to help change fat people talk to them and try to help them. As a fat guy who use to be fit and health I can honestly say the people who are hating on fat people have no idea the struggle that is losing weight. It was so easy to keep weight of and maintain a weight then it has been to lose weight. This past summer I worked my ass off steadly increasing the difficulty of my routine and eating healthy I lost 30lbs in two months and after that I didn't lose a single pound even though I put up a good struggle for 4 months. The reason I say for months is I'm a student during the summer I had time to work a laboring job(construction) and go to the gym for 2 to 5 hours. After the 4 months I didn't have time to be that consistent. I know what you're thinking did he really try that hard and my answer and I don't care if you believe me is yes. I use to be on sports teams and exercise constantly before I gained weight and I never had to work as hard as I did this past summer to loose that 30lbs. Now this summer I am attempting to lose another 30lbs. My point is that I have tried my hardest to lose weight and I am still fat and still trying but now honestly I can sympathize with those who don't try and lose weight. It's hard and not only that it's hard to find help and don't go thinking fat people want an easy way out they understand there isn't any short cuts. They just don't want to be trying and never see any results especially if it's because they aren't doing it properly. These people just need help find out proper and helpful information. The hardest part for me is finding a routine that works, how to make/change a routine and what to eat that I would like to eat. I can eat just about anything but telling people to diet on shitty food just make them feel like they will have eat nothing but awful food to stay thin which isn't true. If I could find out how to properly do these things I would probably progress faster. Meaning someone else who is fat would probably benefit from similar help. Basically if these people actualy wanted to get rid of fat people so they can look good and stop being a burden on the health care system they would actually try and assist them not moan and groan while insulting people. all r/fatpeoplehat was is a place of people who have huge insecurities getting together to release some of those insecurities and I have no problem with that just don't claim you were trying to change or help people.

In fact, those 150k+ subscribers and those millions of visitors all hold very different views and they all utilized the sub and its ideals differently in their lives. The fact that so many different kinds of subreddits created during this event is straight evidence of it. Look at the creativity of it all driven by straight passion.

Some inarguably good things have arisen from this, such as the re-awakening of discussion about online censorship. To set it all aside as just some nonsense is downright irresponsible thinking.

Yes it's bad, and yes, people may take offense, but, it has done good. I love all of the FPH content coming back right now. It was ""fat shaming"" yes, but so? If I made a sub about smokers and harassed them because of an unhealthy life choice people would be fine with it. As a matter in fact, it would probably help people quit smoking after seeing all the pictures of the sad, dirty, disgusting smokers. It made me want to go exercise after seeing all the fat, sweaty, sad people posted on fph, and the best part? They were mostly feminists. So it made me laugh, and get motivated."

You are fighting for the right to hate, abuse and bully those who are obese. You are not trying to understand those people or provide them with information on a healthy diet, no, you are trying to marginalize them and dehumanize them.  Granted, there are people who are fat and are strangely proud of that. However, instead of having a civilized discourse with them you banish them from the very same forums that you are now trying to reinstate. You take away their right to defend themselves or provide their perspective and you call them either fatties or fat sympathizers. But when the very same ability, the one that allows you to voice your hatred and your vitriol, is taken away from you, you rise up against ""censorship"" and ""oppression"".   Do not kid yourself, you are nothing but a hate group, a cult and you allow no dissent or discussion."

ObesityHealthConcern,39dn2k,pjpjr6,3,Thu Jun 11 04:24:29 2015 UTC,"I asked a fatty hater one time and he sent me a lengthy PM explaining everything. He compared it to when he was a smoker and the public started shaming smokers and eventually more and more people stopped smoking because shaming works.   The difference here though is that people can't quit being fat cold turkey (no pun intended) so I guess if shaming does work on fat people, it will just happen slower because it takes a lot of time to lose weight.  Honestly I think the root of the problem is not educating kids about the dangers of processed foods or overeating in general. So kids grow up with these addictions and health problems and it's not even their fault.  Obviously this doesn't apply to everyone but I think it's a step in the right direction. I personally hate to see all the shaming, I think it's awful but in the end it's for a good reason. It's for the overall health of the human race.  HOWEVER I'm sure the are a lot of people, mainly kids, who don't have this in mind at all and they just want to be cruel to people for whatever reason. That's not a good thing, that's bullying."
ObesityHealthConcern,39dn2k,wearsshorts,2,Thu Jun 11 04:56:54 2015 UTC,"The problem is parents overfeeding their kids and feeding them crap. There is plenty of healthy eating education in school, but when they get home and have food shovelled down their throats they see that as normal.  Shaming isn't good, I don't think you should target the person, but I think acceptance and the fat acceptance movement is a hundred times more damaging in the long run. There are no ""smokers acceptance"" campaigns, or any other acceptance movements for destructive habits, I'm genuinely confused as to why we're supposed to accept obesity when the same people will openly deride other addictions."

Adults have the right to make their own life choices without anyone else having a say.  That being said, it is completely reasonable to make assumptions about a fat person's diet (they eat too much) and health (not good) based on their size. It's also perfectly normal and acceptable to find someone like Lindy West highly unattractive based on their weight.  I view obesity sort of like smoking. If an adult is doing it that's their businesses and I have no right to comment or be nasty to them as long as they aren't blowing smoke in my face.   If you're a parent who lets your kid smoke you are a piece of shit though, just like a parent who allows their kid to turn into a porker. No one pretends that smoking isn't unhealthy and we shouldn't pretend that about obesity either. Finally, anyone who became a ""pro-smoking activist"" would be relentlessly criticized and mocked for their promotion of terrible health.

Run hard hitting commercials that show the medical reality on tv with stats. Charge higher insurance rates where BMI hits a certain threshold, and consider packaging warnings.  Another options is to take industry's like air travel and start charging by individual weight.  Have a baseline price for BMI to a certain point and then charge a few $ a pound over that.  It will help them recoup fuel costs, and make it more of a social issue on non acceptance  such as private areas for smokers. If common sense was going to win this one it wouldn't of gone this far.  The food industry could also help out with less sugar and more healthier choices but again people will just chose to buy what they want not what's good for them.  Have celebrity and athletes do talks about the dangers of obesity, public outreach is needed as well.

There's no heart. No connective tissue holding it in place, no connections to anywhere, actually, muscular or otherwise. No deoxygenated blood being sent to the lunges, and what oxygenated blood was left, coming from the lunges, is likely going into those installed tubes in the interim. And what are they doing about the blood the heart should be pumping? My best guess is that the aforementioned pumps are pressurized and keeping this person alive, Dr. Octopus style. By the way, they probably used scissors to cut through that person's sternum. It's crazy.  They have taken out the busiest highway's exits and intersections of this person's body - no detours, and are going to put in a new highway with the same intersections and exits but with less pot holes and hullabaloo.   And then the body's ecosystem can either be like ""yup this road is legit let's agree to keep it safe"" or ""YO WHO PUT THIS ROAD HERE? WHERE'S OUR OLD ONE? RIOT!""  Heart surgery is cool as fuck."

A great way to help prevent this is to regularly exercise. Eat a diet LOW in sugar and fat. One of the signs you may be suffering from a fat problem such as that shown is to measure the difference between your waist and hips. The ratio of your waist to hips (waist/hips) should be around 0.8 or less for women and 0.95 for men, this is the low risk range. Anything above a 1 for men or 0.85 for women is considered high risk. We really need to help those who can't control what they put in their mouth by spreading our concerns about their health.   Edit: this is also meant to be read sarcastically.

ObesityHealthConcern,39g2h8,eatporkplease,6,Fri Jun 12 00:07:59 2015 UTC,"When you body build, this is correct, but for the average person, BMI is a great indicator for the ""average person."" For me all I care about is body fat percentage, like this shit says I'm 22.0 bmi (normal) but fuck that I'm still about 16-18% body fat, still have a long way to go before I'm happy, but when you're trying to educate the average overweight person, this is a lot easier and regularly accepted"
ObesityHealthConcern,39g2h8,HappyGerbil88,5,Fri Jun 12 01:08:36 2015 UTC,"I just don't like BMI because even for normal people, it discourages them from building muscle and even encourages them to lose muscle too. Building and maintaining muscle is important for long-term health, and relying on BMI teaches people that muscle and fat are the same thing and are both bad."

ObesityHealthConcern,39g2h8,emceegyver,2,Fri Jun 12 01:18:44 2015 UTC,"I disagree with you. Even a moderate amount of resistance training can throw your BMI out of whack and make you ""seem"" fatter than you are. It doesn't take body building for it to become a bad measurement.  On the other hand you are correct, it is an alright measurement for the CURRENT average person. This is my problem though, the current average person is not fit at all and considers walking from the car to the store to be exercise. The current ""average"" is pretty low, if the ""average"" person actually went to the gym and did a half decent routine even ONCE a week, yeah you heard me, not 5 or 4, not even 3 or 2, but even just ONCE A WEEK they would have a higher lean body mass and lower body fat percentage. But the average person doesn't go near a gym, even when they are offered for free.   but when you're trying to educate the average overweight person, this is a lot easier and regularly accepted   No, I disagree with this the most. I honestly believe it's easier to understand the concept of bodyfat% and lean body mass. It's better on every level except one, it's harder to determine. Since when did we decide the easiest way was the most accurate?  Most accepted yes, but without raising a stink over how dumb it is we will never get it changed to the better measurements."
ObesityHealthConcern,39g2h8,eatporkplease,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:34:04 2015 UTC,"Again, while I personally can't argue here and agree completely for myself. Educating people, especially delusional ones at that is a daunting task. Keeping it simple is great to start with and baby steps first, then to better more detailed measurements as they realize 30+ BMI is not ok even if its not the absolute best measurement"
ObesityHealthConcern,39g2h8,emceegyver,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:39:44 2015 UTC,"I am a pretty active person. Not the leanest or most fit, not even close. However, at 160lbs body weight and 5'9 tall I am a bmi of 23.6 however my body fat percentage is closer to 18-19% bodyfat (last time I checked my Lean Body Mass was around 130lbs).   Now lets make up some random person. A 5' 3"" person who weighs 200lbs is reasonable so lets go with that. Let's assume they are reasonable active and maintain a LBM close to mine. Let's say 110lbs LBM. That means while I am 30lbs fat/160 = 18.75% BF the other person is 90lbs fat/200 = 45% BF but the BMI would have been 200/5' 3"" = 35.4  My point is, for active people: BMI is scarier (and also garbage) and for sedentary people, Body Fat % is scarier. 45% bodyfat sounds worse to me than 35.4 BMI.  I was a personal trainer for a little while, and when I told a couple of the ladies they were 40% fat, they just stopped. It was like they stopped registering anything. I felt bad at this point telling them the cold hard truth, but it hit them hard, and they came back. When someone hears ""BMI"" they need it explained to them, ""what is bmi again?"" ""why does height/weight matter?"". Vs. ""Your body made up of 40% fat. you want 20%."" it registers with them instantly and they don't ask any questions other than ""how do I lower it?""

It appears that healthy obesity is mostly not possible. Technically, according to a specific definition of ""healthy"", it does exist in a small population.  Keep in mind that this is how ""healthy"" is being defined:   In the best case scenario, “health” in an obesity context relates only to the relationship between obesity and metabolic health, meaning the link between excess fat and the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Other obesity-related health complications, like cancer, arthritis and respiratory disease remain risks.   Besides metabolic health, there are other factors to be mindful of:   “Even though obese people who are metabolically healthy will probably not get much metabolic health benefits by losing weight, weight loss could reduce their risk of cancer, allow them to get pregnant, improve their arthritis, enhance their physical function and improve their quality of life,” said Klein.    In Conclusion  Healthy obesity technically exists, according to a poor definition of healthy, and in a very small number of people.

Let's not pretend /r/fatpeoplehate was some altruistic sub with the purest of intentions - it was a haven for people to justify their hateful attitudes, and somehow delude themselves into thinking they're making the world a better place. These people wanted someone to hate so that they could vent their frustration, so why not pick on fat people? Don't they deserve it, since they're 'ruining the tribe?!' RABBLE RABBLE.

I am a firm believer in constructive criticism, and trying to continually shame someone who is very obviously in denial will only reinforce their denial and push them in the opposite direction. It is absolutely astounding that anyone would genuinely believe that fat-shaming would be an effective method on a global scale to somehow improve the obesity epidemic.  Simply put, human beings are stubborn creatures by nature. This is evidenced by the fact that many people on Reddit will argue about nearly anything. Including these very posts. You will never, ever convince someone that your belief is the correct belief by bashing them over the head and spewing hateful garbage. Even if they finally agree with you, it's only because you have broken them - you have not convinced them of anything, only worn them down to the point where they no longer care to fight back. Ultimately, the only people you are convincing of your belief is people who already believe what you believe.  As a side note, at the risk of falling into the /r/iamverysmart trap, I believe that people who believe that fat-shaming is somehow 'the way to go' to battle the obesity epidemic are those who are too dimwitted or otherwise damaged to know better.

ObesityHealthConcern,39dta1,MisanthropeCounselor,3,Thu Jun 11 06:41:14 2015 UTC,"Here's a perspective from an ethicist and a Catholic priest in training, take it as you will...  The power of human beings to delude themselves is incredible.  We all have a tendency to do things that harm ourselves, which includes the desire to justify and minimize the harm we do ourselves and others.  This expresses itself in many ways in different people, but always follows the same pattern - I did some things I don't like, but don't want to feel bad about myself, so I'll adopt excuses and small lies in order to justify my actions.  In the case of obesity, which is clearly a health risk, a burden on public health care and funds, and, frankly, annoying to people who have to deal with it in public, people believe false things and develop a skewed view of health and society in order to protect their self-image.  Subs like r/fatlogic have tried for a while to show that these false beliefs are easily disproved, and this works for some people, but it doesn't always work.  The fantastic 20th century author Flannery O'Connor put it this way: when people have blinded themselves, we need to write in bold lines to get the message through.  She wrote violent stories about the effects of sin in culture in an attempt to get through to people who deluded themselves.  Although I can't condone the bullying that went on in fph, some of their ""altruism"" comes from the same place as O'Connor's writing, and is necessary in some cases in order for self-deluded people to realize their errors.  We absolutely should support all of our opinions and practices on solid knowledge of reality, and reasoned discussion of facts is a great way to accomplish this.  But sometimes, we need an earthquake to bring down the bad before we can rebuild the good.  Sometimes, we have to call a spade a spade, or a fat person a fat person, in order to get the message through - always in authentic charity and a true desire to help people have happier, more fulfilled lives.  Is fph the right way to go about that?  Maybe not.  But a bit more than simply stating the facts is necessary if we're going to get over the obesity crisis."

The delusions that some people will wholeheartedly hang on to at all cost are astounding.    The arguments back and forth of people saying 'i only eat x # of calories a day' or 'weight loss is different for everyone' or 'i eat properly and excercise and STILL dont' lose weight' or 'I'm big boned' or 'my genetic' - the list is endless.  Nothing you can say or do will change these people's minds - they will delude themselves to the day they die of diabetes or heart failure.  Also, why is it OK to shame and shun smokers?  this falls into the same category.  Someone please explain how smoking is different than obesity.  The way i see it - both are self inflicted - both are optional - both can be eliminated by the user - and both will kill you slowly - also, although arguably, both are addictions."

ObesityHealthConcern,39dta1,minibabybuu,0,Thu Jun 11 10:42:50 2015 UTC,"I personally think it works, and if you want to argue it doesn't work then we need to educate people.  HAES and fat acceptance is not education, weight gain is simple physics calories in calories out, genetics, thyroid and other conditions are all such minor contributors they are not points.( 5-10lbs) doesn't make you obese. If you refuse to shame people or make It a social responsibility issue than you need to educate and eliminate those false ideas and dangerous acceptance for fat in society."

I've tried helping people by exercising with them, showing them what to eat, and informing them. They stick with it for a week, at most. Before they ""teehee it's too hard"" and get even worse.  Fatshame a friend and he's actively exercising and working out. You can't coddle people and expect results. You need to push them. Fatshaming works."

I'm very much a product of my environment, and that is a combination of the best the Scandinavian school system has to offer (not in the ""elite school"" sense of the phrase) and loving parents.  Positive reinforcement for getting on the horse, whether for the first time or after you got thrown off, is so much better than negative reinforcement for falling off or refusing to get on.  HAES is a danger because it hides and obfuscates scientific truths in order to glorify mediocrity and ""feel good"" at the expense of uncomfortable truths.  Significant weight loss is not an easy battle, and requires dedications and in many cases restructuring one's life. It should be held up as a goal worthy of striving towards and something where we should be willing to offer a helping hand. It should not however, be held up as something you need to do on your own if you don't want to be ridiculed.  People are different, and as a result different strategies works best for different people. However, my personal experience is that if you want someone to get up, it helps more to give them a hand than to kick them while they are down."

I don't know if they're stupid enough to believe it, but they're stupid enough to promote it and distribute it, and now they're trying to teach it to children, too.  Because they want everybody to be obese, everybody to be fat - then there would be no more jalousy of the 40-years old mom who had three kids and fought her way back to a fit body.  There would be no more jalousy of the formerly fat teenager who exercised and changed his alimentation so he could say ""ma family is fat, but I used to be fat - I'm not any more"".  There would be no more jalousy of the active girl who can run and jump and play all day long while their own fat and abused children need to eat and drink and eat and drink again before being able to run a few years.  People are talking about the ""crabs in a bucket"" phenomenon, but it's more perfidious that that. We're human beings, god dammit. We should be able to think and be better than animals.  HAES and it supporters shows everyday that everything they believe in stems from jalousy, from envy, from regret of their own actions, but they're unable to change in any way.  Sorry for the rant.

At first I was mainly subscribed to FPH for shits and giggles, but the longer I browsed the subreddit, the more I realized there was one big message going on there: fat acceptance isn't the way to go! It truly is disgusting that people are supporting others because they are living a very unhealthy lifestyle.   Obesity is a real epidemic and it needs to stop right now. To me it's a bigger problem than smoking ever used to be, and I hope governments will try to stop it just like they did (and are still doing) with smoking by educating people & taxing fatty/sugary foods. IMO they would've done so a very long time ago if the food industry wasn't this powerful and wealthy. Lobbying sucks."

Anyone can google ""consequences of being fat"" and be deluged with the same awareness content subscribers are attempting to provide here. As someone who has had trouble controlling their appetite and weight over the years, this sub isn't what I need. I've been well aware of the dangers of being overweight or obese for years. My father had just turned 46 when he died, basically from complications of being a fat ass himself. Knowing it's a terrible thing all these years didn't make a difference. I just kept on stuffing my face and deluding myself. Then I found FPH. Somehow, it immediately had an impact on me like nothing else ever has before. I think the personal shaming being doled out was exactly the daily slap in the face that I needed to wake me up from my complacent slumber. I only wish I had found it sooner, before the idiot admin brigade tore it down. I've been on this site for almost 9 years now. I'll be leaving as soon as I find another similar aggregator."

This sub is meant to be educational as to the effects of obesity, not the cultures that surround it.   We all got problems, some are physically more self-evident than others. I'm not here to love or hate but to understand this growing affliction cuz it affects me and my people. If you care about the outcome of your country and your fellow man then you should concern yourself as well. I understand everyone will be who they want but posting pictures and laughing is about as good as tar-and-feathering. It's not motivating, not stimulating, not anything for the age we live in. The only thing I commend FPH for is the endurance to keep running with the same played-out joke for so many years without tiring. That's really something.  Edit: With all that being said I'm sorry but I'm close to shutting down this thread because it's made completely irrelevant by the fact that we have a description for this subreddit. We have no affiliations with the ongoing conflict between Ellen Pao and FPH and would like to keep it that way. No hard feelings, it just doesn't serve to be constructive as we've seen.  Cheers"
