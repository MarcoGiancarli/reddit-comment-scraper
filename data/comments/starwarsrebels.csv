starwarsrebels,3dz163,TradocTanker,6,Mon Jul 20 18:08:43 2015 UTC,It looks like one of the ships you flew in Star Wars: Starfighter
starwarsrebels,3dz163,Payne_N_Diaz,4,Mon Jul 20 19:29:48 2015 UTC,Interesting design. Looks large enough to fit a small crew of bounty hunters to assist her and seems well armed.
starwarsrebels,3dox5s,darthbanana94,8,Sat Jul 18 01:32:12 2015 UTC,If you are looking for worthwhile to purchase:  Servants of the Empire quartet junior novels  The Rebellion Begins junior novel (has extra scenes set before the movie event Spark of Rebellion)  Ezra's Gamble junior novel  Kanan comic series  A New Dawn novel  Sabine's Sketchbook as a maybe  The chapter books lack the charm of the show due to cutting so many moments from the show to fit in the story.
starwarsrebels,3dox5s,Sapitoelgato,5,Sat Jul 18 01:56:48 2015 UTC,"Sabine's sketchbook is great. Worth it for Sabine's sketches alone, but there are some interesting insights in there as well."
starwarsrebels,3dox5s,Ginko164,3,Sat Jul 18 11:40:16 2015 UTC,"(has extra scenes set before the movie event Spark of Rebellion)   Could you some these up?  I was wondering if the junior novel editions of the show had any extra scenes, is this the only one worth bothering with?"
starwarsrebels,3dox5s,SKLKNKR,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:13:05 2015 UTC,"The chapter books don't add enough extra content to warrant a purchase, but The Rebellion Begins has an interesting set up to the movie. I haven't read it all. I stopped where the beginning started to sync up with the movie since I am reading Han Solo at Star's End."
starwarsrebels,3dox5s,Sapitoelgato,2,Sat Jul 18 03:33:05 2015 UTC,"Man, I own those. Maybe I should dust them off for a quick read. They were fairly good iirc."
starwarsrebels,3dox5s,5aucy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:04:45 2015 UTC,"As a first time read it is awesome. Fun Fact: Both Jason Fry and Pablo Hildago highly praise that book, and it shows from the writing."
starwarsrebels,3dox5s,Sapitoelgato,2,Sat Jul 18 13:15:37 2015 UTC,"If Pablo Hidalgo loves it, then I wonder How likely it is to influence the Han Solo movie.  Is there anything established about how the story group works, are they just sort of this mystical council?"
starwarsrebels,3dox5s,5aucy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:40:36 2015 UTC,"They mentioned somewhere most of the people, who are apart of the group. I believe it takes a majority vote on decisions. For example, Filoni stated he hoped a certain character would return in Rebels, and the character did because the group voted for it.   Fun Fact: in The Rebellion Begins they make Lord Tion canon again by mentioning him in the story. He played a role in the A New Hope Radio Drama."
starwarsrebels,3dox5s,Sapitoelgato,2,Sat Jul 18 15:23:29 2015 UTC,I just listened to the radio drama recently. It was AMAZING. The only thing that didn't match up with current canon was the bit with Jabba and Heater.  The but about Obi-Wan reaching Luke from a Kryyt dragon was actually lifted directly.
starwarsrebels,3dox5s,5aucy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:45:49 2015 UTC,A lot of the radio drama should pop up in the retelling of A New Hope coming out this year.
starwarsrebels,3dox5s,Sapitoelgato,2,Sat Jul 18 15:50:04 2015 UTC,"I didn't know that was happening. I'm super excited now. I love A New Hope, but the radio drama was like... What a Netflix miniseries of A New Hope could be."
starwarsrebels,3dox5s,5aucy,7,Sat Jul 18 17:06:40 2015 UTC,"A New Dawn is set before Rebels, but gives a ton of great insight into Kanan and Hera. Start there.   Also heard good things about the Servants of the Empire series. Haven't read them, I think they skew a bit toward younger readers.   Edit: the comic series Kanan: The Last Padawan is also really good!"
starwarsrebels,3dox5s,NailingIt,2,Sat Jul 18 01:43:26 2015 UTC,I'll also recommend the Kanan comic book. I'm really enjoying the writing and the style.
starwarsrebels,3dox5s,cbrunet,2,Sat Jul 18 13:09:02 2015 UTC,All of the books and comics since the Disney purchase are canon.
starwarsrebels,3d90h3,ahsfan666,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:11:19 2015 UTC,"Maybe. But I found this sentence from the author interesting:  The Servants of the Empire series would include Zare’s appearances on the show, but I’d have a free hand with the rest of his story, assisted by the Story Group and the Rebels team.  http://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-rebels-edge-of-the-galaxy-and-the-grav-ball-gridiron  I hope we see Dhara or Merei on the show!"

starwarsrebels,3d90h3,CommanderVisor,2,Fri Jul 17 06:35:41 2015 UTC,Where'd you hear that? Jason Fry said on Twitter that book 4 takes place after season one.
starwarsrebels,3d90h3,Cevan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:19:11 2015 UTC,"Well then, I stand corrected. I forgot where I read it."
starwarsrebels,3d90h3,CommanderVisor,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:28:13 2015 UTC,I'm still holding onto the theory that the mysterious female Inquisitor we see in the Rebels season 2 trailer with her face covered by a hood is actually Dhara Leonis. Why else would the Inquisitors have been hunting down force sensitive children if not to convert them into more Inquisitors?
starwarsrebels,3d90h3,dompeace24,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:47:40 2015 UTC,"I would say to kill them, but the Emperor always had plans. I would like to see Barriss Offee return, though."
starwarsrebels,3d90h3,returningtheday,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:40:14 2015 UTC,"I think you mean covered by a mask, and we've seen the new Inquisitor's face; they're not dark-skinned at all."
starwarsrebels,3d90h3,Cevan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:35:29 2015 UTC,I think StarWars.com confirmed that she's a Mirialan.
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,iowajaycee,39,Sat Jul 11 13:29:04 2015 UTC,I can't imagine the two will be connected very much. They're set like 40 years apart.
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,Jangwin,-21,Sat Jul 11 14:37:28 2015 UTC,Even species and things though.
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,swankmotron,17,Sat Jul 11 15:15:07 2015 UTC,Rogue One might have more direct connections.
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,AndISaidHey27,5,Sat Jul 11 18:40:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the screenwriter of Rogue One is going to write an episode of Rebels, so most likely there's going to be a tie in."
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,Chewblacka,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:43:52 2015 UTC,I get what they are going for with Rogue One. However I feel it has the most potential to fail of all of the anthologies. No Jedi?? That is taking some risk.
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,pheylan-cavanaugh,2,Sat Jul 18 22:09:27 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about? I'm more excited for Rogue One than I am for Episode 7, and I'm not alone in that. No Jedi is an excellent thing. Finally our good guys will be in some legitimate and real peril, and their surviving is not guaranteed.  The Empire can finally actually kill the good guys."
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,bobafoot17,27,Sat Jul 18 23:18:20 2015 UTC,Haha why on earth would we believe the characters of the rebels show would be involved in Ep 7 at all. There is no reason whatsoever. That's one pipe dream that'll never happen
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,Red5iveStandingBy,-31,Sat Jul 11 15:07:30 2015 UTC,"Because it is Star Wars, and everything is related and connected. Greedo and Anakin were friends as children. Chewbacca and Yoda. Lando and the Rebels crew.  Not to mention it could help weave the story together without having to actively retccon the OT"
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,EveryGoodNameIsGone,20,Sat Jul 11 15:14:56 2015 UTC,That is not Greedo. It is another Rodian named Wald.  http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Wald
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,EveryGoodNameIsGone,5,Sat Jul 11 16:01:29 2015 UTC,Greedo is also there  http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Greedo
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,CommanderVisor,3,Sat Jul 11 16:11:34 2015 UTC,"Because it is Star Wars, and everything is related and connected. Greedo and Anakin were friends as children. Chewbacca and Yoda. Lando and the Rebels crew.   And this has been one of the biggest problems with the series ever since Leia was revealed as Luke's sister in Jedi, and it's only gotten worse since then. I sincerely hope the sequel trilogy team does everything they can to make the galaxy feel bigger again and not making connections between characters that don't have any good reason to actually be connected."
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,Ginko164,3,Sun Jul 12 02:44:23 2015 UTC,"Not saying it's the way I'd prefer it to be, just that it's the way it is."
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,chewee123,3,Sun Jul 12 03:35:03 2015 UTC,"No, that's the way it was. Since the Disney buyout and canon purge, that isn't necessarily the way it will continue to be (though Lando on Rebels is walking a thin line there)."
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,Ginko164,4,Sun Jul 12 03:36:58 2015 UTC,"And the Clone Troopers we are about to see in Rebels...and the fact that Hera is related to Charm Syndula from TCW (Rebels and the first book which escapes my mind). And I haven't even read that much of the new material but it seems Disney is keeping the universe plenty tight, especially if even a quarter of the rumors about lineage in TFA come true.   And I'm not just talking about specific characters. Rebels and Clone Wars introduced a lot of species, ships and locals that could show up, but I haven't seen anything like that yet."
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,pureparadise,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:43:33 2015 UTC,Seems that the only reason how the crew meets the clones is through their connection with Ahsoka
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,mrpiggywinkles52,3,Thu Jul 16 20:40:21 2015 UTC,"Well its just about 40 years later, so I wouldn't imagine there would be a major tie in. Unless I'm right and Kylo Ren is directly connected to Ezra somehow."
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,Ginko164,3,Sat Jul 11 21:42:55 2015 UTC,Unless Kylo Ren was Ezra!
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,mrpiggywinkles52,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:19:47 2015 UTC,"I have thought about this, and it's possible but there would need to be some serious cryo or something- Ezra is to the day the same age as Luke. I honesty just think the parallel between Ezra and Luke is too strong to not do something with it. I've thought this ever since I saw the first episode, with Ezra looking longingly over Lothals two moons."
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,Its_just_ham,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:33:38 2015 UTC,I think the actor who plays Kylo looks a bit like Ezra if he ditched the blue hair.
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,Payne_N_Diaz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:16:09 2015 UTC,Don't they just have to freeze Ezra in Carbonite? I assume that stops aging right?
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,hozboo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:28:06 2015 UTC,"Personally I think it's more likely that the ""collector"" from the concept art is Ezra. In the trailer it is likely him holding the charred remains of vaders helmet. For a kid who collects helmets, that's a pretty sweet prize."
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,blink5694,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:22:49 2015 UTC,Holy shit that would be AMAZING. It would be such a cool connection. Makes sense as well. It might add some extra amazingness if Vader kills kanan at some point and Ezra sees this as revenge.
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,RealVoltar,3,Sun Jul 19 13:30:22 2015 UTC,"Uhh, no."
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,xChuddy,2,Wed Jul 15 05:26:44 2015 UTC,It leaves open the possibility that any of the cast can be killed off and it makes the universe seem like a larger place where not everything has to be connected.
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,ChampionLiar,-8,Sat Jul 11 16:07:03 2015 UTC,"I agree the universe should seem bigger, but it almost unilaterally has not been the case in this media empire."
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,BurningBushJr,2,Sat Jul 11 16:12:12 2015 UTC,"The youngest character in Star Wars Rebels is the same age as Luke and Leia, so any characters directly showing up would be very old, which in my opinion makes it unlikely. I do have a feeling that we may see some hints to tech and locations somewhere down the line though."
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,Chewblacka,2,Sun Jul 12 08:09:15 2015 UTC,They will maybe name drop some stuff like Lothal or something just to tie it over but we probably wont see any Rebels characters in ep7.  And if we were going to it would be a big twist for both Rebels and Force Awakens so they won't reveal that in any of the small teasers we have had.
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,thesynod,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:39:58 2015 UTC,"If they really tie it together, yes, it will be a reveal. But I'm thinking why not larger use of Torguta's or Twi'leks, a rando in Mando armor, things like that which we have become familiar with because of Rebels."
starwarsrebels,3cwsom,JSK23,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:42:17 2015 UTC,I'm assuming that the 30 year gap between E6 and E7 will take care of that...mostly Kallus.

starwarsrebels,3clrvi,Red5iveStandingBy,22,Wed Jul 8 23:05:32 2015 UTC,"The Alderaan would be the best bittersweet ending. Massive drama and episodes that are very intense. Our Heroes pull through and save the day. The camera pans out of our Heroes celebrating in a building, the camera starts to pan up to the sky as the credits roll, Cowboy Bebop finale style. At the very end, you see the Death Star and you hear Tarkin say ""You may fire when ready"" and it fades to black."
starwarsrebels,3clrvi,DDA7X,14,Wed Jul 8 23:50:39 2015 UTC,I say just do a big celebration ROTJ style and end it there. The people paying attention will know what them settling down on Alderaan will mean.
starwarsrebels,3clrvi,leftshoe18,21,Thu Jul 9 01:04:59 2015 UTC,"I agree. Let their fate be known to those who knowww star wars. That way when kids who start with rebels eventually see ""a new hope"".....  I can't even finish this thought its too evil xD"

""Hey Billy, now that you've finished Rebels, you should watch the movie that started it all!""  ""Oh boy dad, this will be great!""  That's like getting you kid to enjoy the first few seasons of Transformers, and really get him to love the characters, then make them watch the 86 movie. That's just cruel, lol."

starwarsrebels,3clrvi,Blackfire853,2,Fri Jul 10 00:16:36 2015 UTC,"Filoni made us love the Jedi Order   I'd argue the opposite, really. I think they did a good job making us feel more attached to our main heroes Obi-Wan and Anakin, as well as Ahsoka, but really exposed how flawed, arrogant, and short-sighted the Jedi Order as a whole was. Not that they should have all been brutally murdered, but they sort of had what was coming to them."

At the very least they'd need to have some people off world, just so we don't all slit our wrists.  I feel like both Hera and Kanan would need to die. Leaving one alive would hurt.  I guess maybe they could save Zeb and Sabine? Be the easiest thing to work into the overall story - they could go off to work a small scale cell on another planet (like Mandalore or something)."
starwarsrebels,3clrvi,grogleberry,3,Thu Jul 9 16:59:58 2015 UTC,"That's the problem, Zeb, Sabine, Chopper and Hera are the only survivors of the series that makes sense to me. Kanan and Ahsoka seem like they won't survive. Ezra is a maybe, but he would either be captured by the Empire and spends OT locked up or gives up on being a Jedi and becomes just another rebel."

Perhaps they do something critical for the Bothans, smuggle someone important somewhere. Meet luke between EP 4 and 5 while they stop off at hoth. The potential for this show is amazing and has me giddy."

Kanan has already expressed discontent in the season 2 special about being part of a larger Rebel movement. He just wanted to help people by getting them food, and loosen control of the Empire. I can see ""Fulcrum"" and Kanan not wanting to be a part of another giant war."
starwarsrebels,3clrvi,Divine_E,3,Thu Jul 9 01:48:18 2015 UTC,"Fulcrum is part of the greater alliance as it seems, she's in close contact with bail organa, so maybe a war to bring down the empire might be what she wants."
starwarsrebels,3clrvi,omarh14,7,Thu Jul 9 03:21:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but for all we know she was doing all this because, ""This is what Anakin would have wanted me to do.""  now that she knows who Vader is, she may distance herself from the cause."

starwarsrebels,3clrvi,Guyote_,4,Thu Jul 9 15:18:52 2015 UTC,"Ahsoka dies relatively early in the series, maybe Season 3, or even Season 2 at Vader's hand.  Hera dies towards the middle of the last season, again by Vader's hand. This leads Kannan to fall to the Dark Side and try to kill Vader himself, he does not.  Ezra, completely broken by their deaths, abandons the Rebels. The last episode is a montage of Ezra's life in the years after, eventually going over the Original Trilogy, with Ezra slowly getting hope back after hearing of what happens in the OT. The final scene is Ezra struggling to hope again, when the surviving crew of the Ghost show up, having tracked him down after RotJ. They tell Ezra that they want to introduce him to somebody. In walks Luke Skywalker who tells Ezra something along the lines of ""Even with the Emperor dead, I have a hard task ahead of me, care to help?"" And he hands Ezra his old lightsaber, Ezra takes it, studies it for a moment. then ignites it. Cue credits."
starwarsrebels,3clrvi,Dorkside,5,Fri Jul 17 02:17:55 2015 UTC,I think they need to die before IV
starwarsrebels,3clrvi,Xeriel,4,Wed Jul 8 22:53:50 2015 UTC,I'll be pretty surprised if we see any of the main characters die on this show.
starwarsrebels,3clrvi,VaultBoy42,3,Thu Jul 9 01:06:21 2015 UTC,"They could easily continue through to the events of ROTJ. Maybe we'll get to see some of the major events in the OT from a different perspective?  It's not like we met every member of the rebellion in the movies. The only really glaring detail would be that we'd certainly have heard of other force users. Either they need to splinter off from the main group, or start to keep their abilities secret or some such hand wavery.  They handled Ahsoka not being in Episode 3 without writing her entirely off; I don't see why they couldn't do it again."
starwarsrebels,3clrvi,Tsubodai_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:21:21 2015 UTC,This was my thought too. They won't kill off the entire cast on Alderaan or something because 1. Show is more marketed to kids than even the normal movies. 2. They've clearly hit on some great characters that they can make so many more stories (and more money) with.
starwarsrebels,3clrvi,ddrober2003,4,Sat Jul 11 00:22:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think only Ezra needs to die. He's too idealistic, combined with too powerful - like a younger Luke. Kanan can easily become disillusioned and go off to be a hermit somewhere, Hera and the rest can follow him or stay with the rebels or die some other way, I don't think it matters (they're not so good that their absence in 4,5,6 would be missed). Ahsoka is the most challenging, but I can think of a few ways to pull her out of the fight.   Ahsoka ending possiblity: A really easy way would be for her to, under extreme duress, turn fully dark - force choking, force lightning, torture, executions, full 9 yards - and then upon realizing what she's become, retreat from the larger galactic arena. A good source of duress (aside from obvious vader) would be inquisitor'd barris offee. You might even be able to work ventress in there somewhere too, as friend or as foe.  Also, if we want to get really dark, we can have Ezra's death be the catalyst to Ahsoka turning dark - an entire season could become everyone reacting to the removal of this bright hope for the future.  Or, if we're sadistic maniacs who like scarring kids for life, Ahsoka could be shocked back from the dark side when she kills Ezra as part of her quest for vengeance, precipitating her withdrawl from galactic affairs.   The next section contains a really awful idea that I do NOT want to nor believe we will ever see. However, given how dark this post has gotten, i figure i might as well go all the way. If you don't want to be shocked and horrified, stop reading now"
starwarsrebels,3clrvi,ChiliManiac,2,Thu Jul 9 23:12:58 2015 UTC,"Man people are wanting dark as hell endings to the series. I think that if they remain part of the Rebel Alliance, they will simply be elsewhere. Why did no one mention Kanan or Ezra to Luke? Because Luke kinda kept it on a down low that he was a Jedi. I imagine overall, Ezra and Kanan would do that as well. Why don't they show up? Because while the movies showed some of the most important battles in the Civil War, they certainly aren't the only ones."

Perhaps they do something critical for the Bothans, smuggle someone important somewhere. Meet luke between EP 4 and 5 while they stop off at off. The potential for this show is amazing and has me giddy."
starwarsrebels,3clrvi,tommmytom,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:13:52 2015 UTC,"Sabine, Hera, Chopper, and Zeb could manage to be under the radar during the movies and so they don't have to have an ending.  Kanan and Ashoka are doomed. They are too big to not have something happen. This could come in a few ways. First off, they could be killed, hopefully by Vader. Second they could be turned to the dark side, especially if some or the rest of the crew is killed. Third they could lose their connection to the force. While I don't know of a cannon example, they could end up walking away like the exile before KOTOR 2. This would be able to have them vanish without killing them.  I would say that most likely some will be killed off, Ashoka and Kanan being primary targets, but Chopper could be a less traumatic death. The remainder could leave the war behind and leave for Alderaan.  Ezra I expect to turn to the dark side and either be set up as a movie villain or an inquisitor. Especially with the death of Kanan, Hera, or Sabine to push him over the edge."
starwarsrebels,3clrvi,burning112,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:48:01 2015 UTC,"The Rebel Alliance could be bigger than what we see in the movies; the heroes in the show could be off somewhere else. Will it be all of them? What will happen to Kana, or Ezra, or Ahsoka? A lot of people say they must die in order for it to fit in with the events in ROTJ (Luke being the last Jedi), although Yoda's line could be open to different interpretations (last Jedi....... who can defeat Vader)."
starwarsrebels,3clrvi,DFKatarn,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:48:31 2015 UTC,"I think it's sort of obvious. Next season someone major dies, Ezra goes dark but is redeemed in the end.   Then the crew of the ghost goes out in a blaze of glory to do something VERY important that links it with the OT, maybe steal the death star plans? Maybe found the rebel alliance? Something like that."
starwarsrebels,3clrvi,ChampionLiar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:11:31 2015 UTC,"OK. I have a long shot theory but hear me out. First a few points.   A while back it was announced that Rebels has an end date already because they wanted to transition after IIRC 4 season into a show set in the sequel era. Makes sense from a marketing stand point, it's how we got to rebels from Clone Wars in a way. Keep the creative team and make an easy jumping on point for new fans.  To the best of our knowledge Yoda is saying Luke is the Galaxies last hope. In the Legends EU the Yuuzhan Vong are established as being outside of the force (more or less) and from outside of the Galaxy. They also almost sort of showed up in a Clone Wars episode, so they're almost not really canon. They're an idea people are aware of but nothing about them (including there existance) is actually set in stone. I told you this was a long shot. Lots of Clone Wars characters ""Had to die"" cause of 4,5,6. They're back in Rebels. Still before 4,5,6 but it shows a tendency to kick the can down the road.   So. My Theory? Kanan and Ezra (and others, Chopper probably) pull a Ghost (see what I did there?) and peace out of the Galaxy by the end of the last season; right before the start of A New Hope. Rebels ends with them leaving it all behind and making a break for the Unknown Regions. Sure it might be called the Regions of Little Knowledge ala Morriban/Korriban but same thing, out past the galaxies edge.  Then, when the new show starts up. It takes place 30 years later with an adult Ezra an aged (or dead) Kanan and new set of allies out fighting a loosing battle against the Vong. Desperately trying to slow their advance towards the Galaxy.   Will any of this happen? A long long shot in a Galaxy far farther away. Still, it'd solve a lot of issue, keep some beloved characters and if they're going to do the Vong I'd rather they tone them down and stretch them out on TV rather than try to do Episode X Vector Prime. Tossing CGI moons around the joint.  So that's what I think will happen to the Ghost crew. Run away, then Vong."
starwarsrebels,3clrvi,platinumrug,0,Tue Jul 21 22:35:03 2015 UTC,The characters on rebels are just cartoon/video game types. I can't believe anyone who thinks they should be included in the live action movies as real characters.

starwarsrebels,3cd8ja,feebos,4,Tue Jul 7 17:19:44 2015 UTC,"Since your original question was answered, I'm gonna bring up the new Ahsoka. People have mentioned the awkward character animations a lot, but I think for the most part you get use to is. I eventually stopped thinking about it as the style of the show sank in and I kept watching. But something does still feel kind of off about Ahsoka. I understand that it's a totally different show than TCW, but it seems weird to change her markings the way they did. The different animation styles felt like enough of a change with her big, bright Disney eyes now. I've been very happy with the show, but seeing Ahsoka is still very jarring to me."
starwarsrebels,3cd8ja,TeutonJon78,2,Tue Jul 7 02:56:08 2015 UTC,I feel like her head tails feel more like a hat in Rebels than a part of her head. Something about it just feels off.

starwarsrebels,3bkmi3,Waddles77,12,Thu Jul 2 23:56:17 2015 UTC,"It would only benefit you to watch the show to get a better appreciation to the characters new and old from The Clone Wars. For example, if you want to see the best representation of Anakin Skywalker, The Clone Wars has it. Sure there are goofy moments in the show, but that is also true, with all the movies. The catch is the people, who did not like the prequels or got heavily invested in the EU Clone Wars multimedia project had a disconnect, with the show. The influence of the show will play an impact in Rebels, but in different ways as you might enjoy TCW.  If you do watch TCW, which is on Netflix, I suggest watching in either Chronological Order or the Ultimate Order:  https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/35ex94/the_clone_wars_ultimate_episode_order/  The difference of the Ultimate Order is it takes the Chronological Order and fixes the pacing, for binge watching.

starwarsrebels,3bhwy9,emil-p-emil,2,Mon Jun 29 10:45:15 2015 UTC,He's telling us something....
starwarsrebels,3bghbu,Mithrandir77,19,Mon Jun 29 00:40:08 2015 UTC,"Individual Jedi have little propaganda value to the Rebels, being long-dead heroes from the previous war. Those who fought on either side of the Clone Wars need to look past the Jedi. They are respected because of their historical role of keeping the peace in the Galaxy, but it's obvious they failed and are, to the common person, no longer relevant. For the younger generation, they know next to nothing about Jedi, since the Empire has actively suppressed knowledge about them, and in various books, we see that citizens have learned not to talk about Jedi.  For Luke, very few people know he's Anakin's son. Luke's a humble guy, he doesn't go around bragging about what he's done or who he is (See Heir to the Jedi). Besides maybe his close friends (and R2D2 who knows the truth anyways), Luke probably doesn't feel the need to tell about his heritage. And apparently Skywalker is a common enough name that few people make the connection. Vader only does so because he felt the Force connection during the DS trench run and later learned about the pilot's name.  You didn't mention Bail Organa. He definitely knows who Vader is, having seen Anakin's 501st torch the temple and learning about it from Yoda and Obi Wan. As the leader of the Alliance, he would steer away from mythologizing Anakin. Talking about dead Jedi heroes is probably a bad move anyway for morale. When telling stories about the feats of Jedi, you'd be hard pressed not to include their many uses of the Force. These tales sound great, but the sobering reality kicks in when you realize that none of that wizardry won the Clone Wars, or kept the Emperor from killing them all. The few surviving Force-sensitives are being hunted down, and they don't even want to talk about the Clone Wars. The current war is hopeless enough. Why regale your soldiers with tales where even super-beings couldn't defeat the Imperial war machine?  When Luke comes onto the scene, he does something absolutely amazing, but even then, he's not expected to end the war on his own. He's just another Force-sensitive to the rest of the Alliance, even if he's currently the only one they have. The audience knows he's the ""New Hope"", but the Rebels have learned not to rely on the Jedi as their hope."
starwarsrebels,3bghbu,legendarymoonrabbit,13,Mon Jun 29 01:40:08 2015 UTC,"For the younger generation, they know next to nothing about Jedi, since the Empire has actively suppressed knowledge about them, and in various books, we see that citizens have learned not to talk about Jedi.   Even Han, who would have had been 10 (going by the old EU) during the CW doesn't believe in the force. That really shows how mythical the jedi were."
starwarsrebels,3bghbu,Tuskin38,12,Mon Jun 29 04:01:27 2015 UTC,"As far as the separation of Vader and Anakin, this isn't Episode V Vader, he goes through a significant amount of growth between then and Rebels and he doesn't actively starting changing until ESB BECAUSE of his son's refusal of the dark side. As seen in the comics, when he learns the ""rebel pilot's"" identity as Luke Skywalker, he has a strong reaction. The between trilogies Vader IS a different person as far as he's concerned. He actively starts suppressing that identity fairly early and this experience is explored fairly well in the last canon book, ""Lords of the Sith"""
starwarsrebels,3bghbu,RVierra327,7,Mon Jun 29 04:10:25 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of your questions are answered by the Darth Vader (and Star Wars) comic coming out now, specifically addressing the duality.  That's also a central theme of Lords of the Sith and touched on more in Tarkin.  Also, I got the impression in the PT and Clone Wars that the galaxy is so vast that people don't latch onto the name of specific Jedi.  There are specific people that remember the names of some Jedi, but it's far from household names.  Also, the official narrative is that the Jedi turned on the republic.  While the rebels don't necessarily embrace that as truth, the downfall of the Jedi was very suspect and sudden.  18 years later, I don't think the average person is exactly idolizing them."
starwarsrebels,3bghbu,5aucy,4,Mon Jun 29 13:46:35 2015 UTC,"Besides the points stated I do feel Vader is somehow ashamed of his defeat from his battle with Kenobi, so he prefers not to associate himself with the failure that was Anakin, and instead embrace the Vader identity. He later says that he is Luke's father as he probably wanted to demoralise Luke and/or bring him to the Dark Side."
starwarsrebels,3bghbu,RyeDraLisk,5,Mon Jun 29 12:59:19 2015 UTC,"I answered what I could (mobile) let me know if it makes sense and if you have trouble matching topics to questions, only had attention to mark first one  A/g)its a big fucking galaxy, a large number didn't even know about the rebellion so why link the Skywalkers?  Because the emperor labeled the Jedi as traitors who made an attempt at assassinating him the general populous didn't use them for inspiration   however the rebellion are aware what the empire is evil, I dont believe many know fully what happened other than the jedi were betrayed  there are times you hear them reference force (death star attack planning for example) and considering they are associated with rex, ahsoka, and organa they are likely to have heard stories of fallen jedi...  as to why the rebellion doesn't veiw them as martyrs is because Jedi wouldnt want to be veiwed that way  To why they were never told about vader? Part is morale but also protection for luke and leia, and by defacto the last 2 known surviving members of high council and obiwan"
starwarsrebels,3bghbu,Bluenite0100,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:15:41 2015 UTC,"I'll bite!  a) Probably not a ton. It's not like the events of the battles during the Clone Wars were public knowledge. And keep in mind that any media that WOULD cover it went through the lense of propaganda that Palpatine started to put into place to make the Jedi seem distant and alien to the people of the Republic.  b) A LOT happened on Mustafar. Mainly, he ""killed"" his wife and failed to defeat his old master. Had none of that happened, he'd probably be totally OK with being called Anakin. That said, ""Anakin Skywalker"" is just a reminder of everything he lost, so he pushes it away and deep down. (The Vader comics really give a great glimpse at just how much his attitude changes upon learning that he has a son. Anakin is still in there, just deep DEEP down.)  c) See answer b. I'd also highly suggest you pick up the recent Darth Vader comic series made by Marvel.  d) Anakin ""died"" with the rest of the Jedi. But perhaps more importantly, some of the founding members of the Rebellion (Bail Organa) knows exactly who Anakin is and what he's done. I don't know about you, but I'd keep those kinds of secrets close to my chest (as we are seeing Ahsoka do now in Rebels). Also see answer a as to why more Jedi aren't revered.  e) It's possible. It's also possible that he would continue to see ""Anakin Skywalker"" as a failure and see anyone who honors that old name as a failure as well. ""Anakin Skywalker was a weak fool who did not know the true power of the dark side. Here, let me show you the error of his ways...""  f) I imagine people would be hesitant to get to know him, or fear him. But would clearly get over it if they got to know him. They might also rally around him as a symbol or anti-Vader (think the ""The Girl on Fire"" from the Hunger Games.)  g) Skywalker was the name of a slave. I can only assume that more people share the name (even if we never see them). Also, the number of people who knew that Anakin came from Tatooine or was a slave is VERY low (you see this during the Clone Wars, as even Ahsoka doesn't know about his slave past until the slave arc). So I would imagine that Luke and Anakin sharing a name would be no different than you meeting someone named Patton. An odd coincidence, but since Anakin was a Jedi and would have grew up in the temple and never have children and Luke is very open about growing up on Tatooine; I don't think people would make that connection easily.  h) Is the question how would Vader react if he found out he had a son? The answer is he'd try to get his son to join him and overthrow the Emperor, just like he did in the movies. lol  i) I imagine both Ahsoka and Obiwan would put their secret aside unless they feared the Emperor using that secret to demoralize the troops. The real question in this scenario is why aren't the troops inspired by Obiwan and Ahsoka?  j) The Rebels fight for the people of the galaxy, just like the Jedi Knights of Old. While they would hold the order up as a heroic thing to aspire too, I don't think they'd focus on any one Jedi or Jedis as heroes.  Also, you say that there isn't a double identity for Tyrannus or Sidious; but that is just factually incorrect. The number of beings in the Galaxy that know of the names ""Tyrannus"" or ""Sidious"" can be counted on one hand. Heck, Palpatine's secret identity is a MAJOR part of his character! So I guess I don't understand your point here. People knew Dooku was a Sith Lord and SOME suspected he had a master. But Palpatine's identity was a complete secret and Dooku was specifically a pawn Palpatine used to BE a public face. So... shrugs"

starwarsrebels,3b7qis,diamondcreeper,5,Fri Jun 26 23:23:47 2015 UTC,"Ahsoka doesn't have lekku, that's something specific to Twi'leks. Ahsoka is a Togrutan, she has just headtails. Hers are more stiff than Hera's. -StarWarsNerdFactoftheDay -Nottryingtobeabutt  I think they're very well done. They are slightly distracting, granted, but that's part of the Twi'lek's allure, and why they are sex-slaves galaxy-wide (which also explains why Hera wears loose clothes). In addition to this fact, that's how they're supposed to move.  Overall, the lekku are animated like they are supposed to act, and they are distracting. :)"

I was so looking forward to adult Ashoka, but her appearances so far have been poorly animated and she hasn't done anything, so I'm starting to struggle. Ezra also is a bit over the top sometimes, but not too bad.  I think that the mandalorian girl is probably the best facial animation wise, only because I don't recall ever noticing anything wrong with it."

He might have intended to kill everyone but the force sensitives, but that changed when he sensed Ahsoka.

starwarsrebels,3b2ivs,Drumada,11,Mon Jul 6 05:37:50 2015 UTC,"Well he didn't kill the Ghost crew when they first met cause he wanted them to lead him back to the other rebels. (the fleet) When he finally pushed them far enough that they ran back to the fleet he proceeded to trying to kill them all. He did Destroy their command ship and kill all but 2 of the A-wings. He would have finished them off but when he sensed Ahsoka his priority shifted to the ghost which gave the other rebels time to escape.   He was correct that the rebels on Lothal were broken, only thing they could do is run and hide."
starwarsrebels,3b2ivs,Dakkon_B,2,Thu Jun 25 21:46:22 2015 UTC,What kind of ship was that anyway? I don't see anything like it in past concept or fan artwork: http://imgur.com/nOQThoQ  Edit: spelling
starwarsrebels,3b2ivs,bluegrassgazer,3,Fri Jun 26 13:31:58 2015 UTC,The command ship? It looked like a heavy corellian corvette.
starwarsrebels,3b2ivs,Dakkon_B,3,Fri Jun 26 14:34:26 2015 UTC,"No it was the republic medical/supply frigate from the Clone wars, Pelts class"
starwarsrebels,3b2ivs,The--Comet,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:33:00 2015 UTC,Gotcha. Still looks like a Modified corvette :)
starwarsrebels,3b2ivs,Dakkon_B,2,Fri Jun 26 15:39:02 2015 UTC,"Well let's be honest here, they probably based the class design on the CR 90 Corvette"
starwarsrebels,3b2ivs,The--Comet,5,Fri Jun 26 15:42:23 2015 UTC,Vader was trying to kill everybody.  I'm pretty certain the only reason he didn't kill them all was that he sensed Ahsoka.
starwarsrebels,3b2ivs,Zammin,7,Thu Jun 25 21:09:31 2015 UTC,^ This. To add to that: they now want to capture Ahsoka because she might know where Obi-wan and other surviving Jedi are.
starwarsrebels,3b2ivs,Nihillo,2,Fri Jun 26 01:22:34 2015 UTC,"Initially scare the rebellion off Lothal to protect whatever secret they're keeping then use them to find the bigger group.  While in the middle of destroying them, he realizes that he may have a link to find other surviving jedi and consults Sheev."
starwarsrebels,3b2ivs,RealVoltar,2,Fri Jun 26 13:51:08 2015 UTC,Cripple them so they stop effectively hampering the empire.  Drive them away from Lothal.  Reduce them to a manageable annoyance and position them so they seek help. Turn them into bait and allow other imperial agents to use them to find any remaining enemies of the empire.  Mission Accomplished.

starwarsrebels,3atkob,Blackfire853,9,Tue Jun 23 13:17:38 2015 UTC,"It's what we were used to for decades. For me, something like this is similiar to when Pluto was demoted from being a planet. You think something is one way your whole life then someone comes along and makes changes. Takes a while to get used to it and the changes aren't always better."
starwarsrebels,3atkob,eawhite,7,Tue Jun 23 16:20:25 2015 UTC,Would you prefer no more dog fights in rebels involving A-Wings?
starwarsrebels,3atkob,Blackfire853,3,Tue Jun 23 16:23:59 2015 UTC,"Well, they've already been shown, no point in not using them now. But they weren't the exact same as the A-Wings in RoTJ so I'm fine with them being earlier variants. But yeah, I would have preferred fighters that were already established as being used during that time period. Plus, if they're already being used by the rebels, why weren't they at Yavin base during Episode IV. A-Wings are supposed to be the fastest fighter, would have been extremely helpful in attacking the Death Star. Unless they change that too and they're no longer super fast. It makes no sense to show A-Wings and B-Wings (from the trailer) in possession of the rebels so early on when they don't show up again until Episode VI."
starwarsrebels,3atkob,eawhite,2,Tue Jun 23 16:36:01 2015 UTC,"The A-Wings we see are the same type, starwars.com verifies that by making no distinction. We only see A-Wings used so perhaps those are the only fighters this cell has, and they don't join the main Rebel Alliance until after Empire"
starwarsrebels,3atkob,Blackfire853,4,Tue Jun 23 16:42:15 2015 UTC,"There are some visual differences but if they're officially the same, can't argue that."
starwarsrebels,3atkob,eawhite,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:59:55 2015 UTC,Maybe the A-Wings weren't that good at that point and the rebels improved them later.

starwarsrebels,3atkob,otoshimono124,8,Mon Jun 29 08:01:00 2015 UTC,"A-Wing was a nickname to multiple models of ships. The ones in Siege of Lothal are a not the same ones you see later. Keep in mind that Legends material is different from canon material.  For example, Admiral Ackbar was at the Medal Ceremony in A New Hope. He was not present, for the ceremony, as he was busy overseeing the relocation of the compromised rebel base. After the ceremony, you can see him barking orders, as Leia is talking to the Commander. In addition, the Empire had relocated the Mon Calamari before the destruction of Alderaan.  And yes. People have discussed the A-Wing ships since they were first announced."
starwarsrebels,3atkob,Sapitoelgato,3,Tue Jun 23 12:20:30 2015 UTC,"Apparently from the other comments they are the same one, and I just noticed from Wookiepedia the A wings were retconned to have arrived 5 years earlier.  Thanks for your response :)"

starwarsrebels,3atkob,The--Comet,4,Wed Jun 24 07:18:32 2015 UTC,"Well in the ""Original"" Star wars timeline, the A-wing class wasn't developed by Jan Dodonna, the old general in ANH, until sometime after the battle of Yavin, and all the A-wings lookalike that appear before ANH are classified as the R-22 Spearhead. But in the ""New"" Star wars timeline, A-wings are already developed even though the rebels does not seem to have either enough resources and the manpower to develop a new class of fighter craft.   Terms:  ANH = A New Hope Jan Dodonna: The old general in the new hope, also commanded the Victory Fleet back in the Clone wars"
starwarsrebels,3atkob,SKLKNKR,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:41:17 2015 UTC,"Ah, just checked on Wookiepedia, apparently the A-wings were retconned to have arrived 5 years earlier. Thanks."
starwarsrebels,3atkob,countjared,3,Tue Jun 23 17:12:47 2015 UTC,"Even in legends they retconned a craft called the R-22 spearhead because some writers didn't know the A-wing should not have been present in the timeframe they were writing.  These are full up A-wings though, just an older variant compared to the ones we see Green Squadron flying."
starwarsrebels,3atkob,SKLKNKR,3,Tue Jun 23 14:38:33 2015 UTC,It wasn't just writers. The biggest example of pre Battle of Yavin A Wings was in the Star Wars Droids cartoon. That predates any stories of the A Wing development by several years.
starwarsrebels,3atkob,RealVoltar,3,Tue Jun 23 14:55:16 2015 UTC,"I meant for writers to include those that wrote for shows and video games, even though they likely aren't to ""blame"" for the mistake."
starwarsrebels,3arn1i,mutually_awkward,23,Mon Jun 22 23:18:52 2015 UTC,"I like to think of him as ""villain captain Rex,"" and I think that's an appropriate description of his role in the story.  He will always be there, standing by the side of powerful military figures, as their silent subordinate, if they enter combat, we will see him participate as well, but otherwise he will be mostly in the background, unless they decide to have an Empire-centric episode, but I doubt we will be seeing that any time soon, the series will have to mature a bit more before we can start seeing things from the Empire's perspective."
starwarsrebels,3arn1i,Nihillo,5,Tue Jun 23 00:19:18 2015 UTC,Don't forget the full on grudge Zeb has with Kallus for participating in the extinction of his people.   I think there is going to be something more intense and personal in the future after all is said and done than the generic position you lay out here.
starwarsrebels,3arn1i,nihilance,3,Tue Jun 23 04:33:28 2015 UTC,"I imagine Kallus would die in such a confrontation, so that might be someting for a season finale."
starwarsrebels,3arn1i,Nihillo,5,Tue Jun 23 05:29:51 2015 UTC,Or Kallus killing Zeb...  That would be a pretty big deal - killing off a major character and another member of that race.  A moment like that would surely add to the stress and hopelessness of the rebellion for the main group.
starwarsrebels,3arn1i,lomis,5,Tue Jun 23 20:40:11 2015 UTC,Perhaps Kallus killing Zeb will cause Ezra to have a struggle with the dark side (seeking revenge)
starwarsrebels,3arn1i,slvspartan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:46:46 2015 UTC,As far as Rebels is concerned I 100% agree.  He's building Vader and Tarkin cred for a future project.
starwarsrebels,3arn1i,RealVoltar,6,Wed Jun 24 06:35:15 2015 UTC,"I feel he will take a back seat again to the inquisitors but will be in more of a ""Tarkin"" role this season.  I don't see Tarkin or Vader leaving Lothal for any extended amount of time, and I don't think we will see the Rebels return anytime soon."
starwarsrebels,3arn1i,SKLKNKR,7,Mon Jun 22 23:50:28 2015 UTC,He doesn't like being left out of the loop though. That could make for some interesting plots. You'll see what I mean when Vader demands the room to be cleared. Kallus had a disgruntled glance as the door closes.
starwarsrebels,3arn1i,Binturung,6,Tue Jun 23 05:31:51 2015 UTC,I noticed that! And feel like (or hope) that leads to something interesting.
starwarsrebels,3arn1i,Payne_N_Diaz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:36:25 2015 UTC,I noticed that as well. In the finale of season 1 he gives Vader a quizzical look behind his back when Vader steps off the ship. I half expected Vader to choke him for it.
starwarsrebels,3arn1i,avatarfire,5,Thu Jun 25 13:02:48 2015 UTC,"I feel that Vader may not listen to the Emperor and go after Ahsoka personally, and the Emperor would command Agent Kallus to keep an eye on him.   We may even see a scene of the Emperor punishing Darth Vader for an act of insubordination at some point.   I really fear for the Ghost crew. Vader may hesitate even if he hates his former student, but the Emperor would not be forgiving at all if Ahsoka refuses to join the dark side. It would make the conclusion of ROTJ all the more powerful if the Emperor kills her."
starwarsrebels,3arn1i,avatarfire,2,Tue Jun 23 07:29:05 2015 UTC,"I didn't even think about that! It could just like Jedi but without Vader intervening.   But does Vader even want to try and turn her? It seemed as soon as he realized she was alive, he turned his attention from the command ship to The Ghost and was going to straight for the kill."
starwarsrebels,3arn1i,NC16inthehouse,2,Tue Jun 23 08:06:13 2015 UTC,Vader before ROTJ was kinda like Reek in GoT HBO version. And Vader was not trying to shoot down the Ghost - he wanted the rebels alive and commanded the Star Destroyers to cut off their escape route.
starwarsrebels,3arn1i,Draiko,2,Tue Jun 23 08:54:31 2015 UTC,"Well, both Anakin/Vader and Ahsoka shares some similarities in a way, were betrayed by the Jedi Council. So Vader might try to exploit that since she was his former student and all."

starwarsrebels,3arn1i,usernameshmoosername,2,Wed Jun 24 05:16:29 2015 UTC,"Cast Members at Disney Parks are instructed to never point with one finger as some cultures consider it rude, so when ever they are giving directions they will point the way with two fingers instead of just one. I think it was a rule Walt made back when Disneyland opened in the 50's. When Kallus directs the droid to follow Tua, he does so with a Disney Point."
starwarsrebels,3arn1i,Lurkndog,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:34:01 2015 UTC,"Oh that's really interesting. I've heard of this ""pointing can be considered rude"" thing before, but more in the context politicians and how they have their own version of the Disney Point. I think they use their thumbs or something, I can't remember exactly. Cheers :)"
starwarsrebels,3arn1i,RealVoltar,2,Wed Jun 24 06:00:24 2015 UTC,"Kallus is competent enough that his superiors haven't killed him yet. He's also been unquestionably loyal to the Empire so far.  The next question is: what does Kallus want for himself, what will he do to get it, and when will he make his move?"
starwarsrebels,3arn1i,themenace95,3,Tue Jun 23 04:23:54 2015 UTC,It looks like he's living the dream at the moment and is currently amazed at how well Vader's plan works.  I get the feeling he's in an AP bad guy class and will want to learn everything he can from them.  I get the feeling he's being set up for some pre-E7 storyline in the future.

starwarsrebels,3am8y6,LichtbringerU,7,Sun Jun 21 17:55:11 2015 UTC,"Upvote for the best in-universe explanation I've heard yet.  I still think the show would be better with some turbolaser fire, though."
starwarsrebels,3am8y6,eyybronbron,9,Sun Jun 21 18:56:51 2015 UTC,I seem to remember somewhere that Star Destroyers can't fire at fighter planes because the smaller fighter planes move too quickly and they're impossible to hit. Might be the case why Phoenix Home doesn't fire at Vader. He's in a small fast ship and that the bigger capital ships can't hit fast moving targets.
starwarsrebels,3am8y6,Binturung,8,Sun Jun 21 17:52:05 2015 UTC,"This. It's pretty common in most of SW books, movies, TV shows, games, etc that Cap ships are not very effective at shooting down smaller craft. It's why Starfighters are still widely used in the Star Wars setting.  Also, Vader wanted to take the rebels alive, likely to learn more about their organization so it can be completely crushed. Much like they wanted to take the Falcon intact and the crew alive in ESB, where Star Destroyers were also not firing on the Falcon."
starwarsrebels,3am8y6,Binturung,2,Sun Jun 21 18:11:32 2015 UTC,"Vader only wanted Ahsoka alive, I'm pretty sure."
starwarsrebels,3am8y6,Mozerath,4,Sun Jun 21 18:58:09 2015 UTC,"He quite explicitly said he wanted the rebels alive when the Star Destroyers showed up. Otherwise, he would've ordered them to obliterate their ships."
starwarsrebels,3am8y6,BurningBushJr,3,Sun Jun 21 19:02:09 2015 UTC,"Fair point. I'm pretty sure that what Vader wanted was Ahsoka alive, but the order he actually gave was to hold all fire.  I'm just not sure why he gave that order, when he clearly had absolutely zero intention of keeping the Rebel ships intact up until that point."
starwarsrebels,3am8y6,bmxcaleb,2,Sun Jun 21 19:10:39 2015 UTC,"Right, and he didn't want the Rebels alive until he found out that Ahsoka was alive.  I mean, if he did want to keep the Rebels alive, he was doing a terrible job of it what with destroying their ships and all."
starwarsrebels,3am8y6,SKLKNKR,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:06:41 2015 UTC,"Fairly sure he ordered his fleet to block the escape of the Rebel corvettes. Instead the incompetent commander, misunderstood his command when he saw him singeling out the Ghost.  In the end they failed to capture or destroy the rebel ships and caught Vader, preventing him from following the Ghost into hyperspace."
starwarsrebels,3am8y6,SKLKNKR,10,Mon Jun 22 00:25:32 2015 UTC,"They can't reliably hit small, fast moving targets, but that's not the same thing as not even shooting at them. Throughout the movies, we see capital ships firing on starfighters with their turbolasers all the time. They usually miss, sure, but at least they're doing something. And it looks exciting!  This also doesn't explain why Star Destroyers never fire on corvettes or the Ghost (we know they can hit a target the Ghost''s size at a respectable range from A New Hope, let alone point blank) or why the corvettes never fire on the Star Destroyers.  Or, for that matter, why anybody bothers with real ships in the Star Wars universe to begin with."
starwarsrebels,3am8y6,SKLKNKR,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:22:37 2015 UTC,"Throughout the movies, we see capital ships firing on starfighters with their turbolasers all the time.   You sure about that. Because I think you might want to go back and re watch the movies."
starwarsrebels,3am8y6,RadicalFire,3,Sun Jun 21 18:56:22 2015 UTC,"You go back and rewatch the movies. The Death Star attempted to shoot down Red and Gold squadrons with its turbolasers, and the Star Destroyers at the Battle of Endor put out some anti-air fire as well. It didn't do either much good, but it did happen."
starwarsrebels,3am8y6,bmxcaleb,16,Thu Jun 25 01:50:50 2015 UTC,"Well, first off against a single fighter engaged by friendly fighters, you're likely to do more harm than good if you're shooting at them. In such close proximity you're not likely to be able to miss your own fighter AND the target. As to why the Star Destroyers weren't fighting the corevettes, I think its best assumed that they were out of range for weapons. The Rebels didn't move to engage because... well... they're not exactly a challenge for star destroyers."
starwarsrebels,3am8y6,IAMA_Drunk_Armadillo,10,Thu Jun 25 02:47:38 2015 UTC,"I'd accept the friendly fire point if we hadn't see capital ships putting up anti-aircraft fire in the movies - the Death Star in particular was quite happy letting its AA turrets fire into the dogfights at Yavin. The Rebels also continued to hold their fire even after the A-wings were destroyed.  In Fire Across the Galaxy, the Rebel ships were clearly within weapons range. That's about the range the opening engagement in A New Hope takes place at, and during the escape from Mos Eisley two Star Destroyers manage to hit the Falcon at an even longer range (for some reason I can't find any screencaps of a frame with both the SDs and the Falcon in range).  The engagement in Siege of Lothal takes place at about the same range. And on at least one occasion, the Ghost basically buzzed a Star Destroyer's conning tower without attracting a single shot. So range is clearly not the issue here."

While I agree with you mostly, I don't think we ever see capital ships going to town where friendly fire wouldn't be ""acceptable losses"".  Coruscant and both Death Stars are so important of targets any friendly fire would be negligible.  Also, not all of the A-wings were destroyed, we see a few jump away."

I am still waiting for the first new canon RTS, and I'm nerding out over all the new ships and variants."
starwarsrebels,3am8y6,DangerousDac,3,Sun Jun 21 19:17:52 2015 UTC,"The CR-90 is a CEC design, so perhaps the turret hardpoints are designed to work with multiple different weapon types?

So we now have Canon confirmation that A, the Alderaanian uniforms are not standard issue across the Alliance and B, the idea that Corellian corvettes are exclusively operated by Alderaan is wrong)"

And not only that, but I think the rebels would hold their pilots lives in higher regard than the empires. And thats not to say that the empire doesn't. During the trench run, the turbolasers stop firing when Vader enters the trench..."
starwarsrebels,3am8y6,pyromaster55,6,Tue Jun 23 16:08:50 2015 UTC,"Point. But on the other hand, the trench was a narrow environment where friendly fire was a much higher risk - the guns didn't stop firing when the TIEs first engaged the X-wings. And I'm not sure why Vader ordered his Star Destroyers to hold all fire, when it was obvious the only rebel he wanted alive was Ahsoka (as evidence, see what he just did to Phoenix Home).  Furthermore, this still doesn't explain the lack of turbolaser fire at Mustafar (where we can clearly see that they were in range), or why the Rebels didn't open fire on the Destroyers during the retreat, or why the Ghost is allowed to fly circles around a Star Destroyer's conning tower with complete impunity so long as the TIEs don't hit it.  Or why, if fighters are so devastatingly effective that they can knock out a capital ship's shields and be completely immune to return fire, anybody in the Star Wars universe uses capital ships at all."
starwarsrebels,3am8y6,avatarfire,4,Sun Jun 21 19:07:24 2015 UTC,That would have made that scene in Fires across the Galaxy so much more bad ass! Having the capital ships just open up on the Star Destroyers soon as they dropped from hyperspace. Fuck I wish they'd have done that now.

starwarsrebels,3am8y6,RyeDraLisk,2,Sun Jun 21 20:58:16 2015 UTC,"My point is that the Star Destroyers held their fire for no good reason. The fact that Vader ordered them to hold their fire for no good reason doesn't remove the problem, it just displaces it."
starwarsrebels,3am8y6,The--Comet,0,Thu Jun 25 01:47:24 2015 UTC,"What. Go watch episode four again. They make specific note that the guns stop firing, and THEN the TIE Fighters come out. Not before."
starwarsrebels,3am8y6,BurningBushJr,3,Thu Jun 25 02:48:37 2015 UTC,"Two separate waves of TIEs were launched at Yavin - you're conflating them.  The first wave was launched soon after Vader was informed that the Rebel fighters were evading the Death Star's AA fire. (""We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the men to their fighters."") This wave did not include Vader himself, and engaged Red Squadron in the ""skies"" above the Death Star's northern hemisphere. The turbolasers continued to put out AA fire throughout this part of the engagement, even while TIEs were dogfighting Rebels.  Shortly afterward, Gold Squadron began their attack run. Vader noticed this and launched with his two wingmen to begin his trench hunting. (""Several fighters have broken off from the main group. Follow me!"") At this point, the turbolasers in the trench stopped firing to avoid friendly fire (""The guns... they've stopped!""). We don't know what the turbolasers on the surface did.  At least one turbolaser was still firing as late as Luke's final trench run (""What about that tower?"" ""You worry about those fighters, I'll worry about the tower!"")"

starwarsrebels,3am8y6,Vratix,9,Thu Jun 25 02:45:39 2015 UTC,"The thing that bothered me most was the fact that a single tie advanced (even with vader at the helm) was able to wreck a capital ship without some kind of secondary munitions.   I know it's not accurate, but I play the x-wing mini game, and it would take AGES for a single fighter to drop even the CR-90's shields, dude does it in like three passes. :|"
starwarsrebels,3am8y6,JMoc1,6,Thu Jun 25 03:40:52 2015 UTC,"Deploying Phoenix Squadron required Home Base to drop shields. It wasn't a lot of time from dropping shields to Vader's strafing runs. He also made two passes with presumably weapons at the highest power setting for his TIE Advanced to deliver lots of pain.  Another in-universe explanation would be that Vader shot at the weakest shield arcs of the ship when the shields have not yet been fully restored. Vader used bombs or missiles to further cripple the ship.  In WWII dive bombers dealt extra damage because their bombs were delivered almost vertically on an enemy vessel. I would assume that similar physics were at play if you deliver a high-speed payload at a weakly-armored section of the ship, like Vader did against Home Base.  In fact, in the prequel era it is established that capital ships have weak armor and shield in certain sections such as the bridge, hangar bay, and shield generators. In TCW Anakin destroyed Trench's flagship by guiding Trench's missiles directly at the bridge with a ""diving"" manuever. In ROTS Anakin crippled Greivous' ship's hangar bay shields with a well-aimed shot. In ANH Luke penetrated the plasma shielding near the Death Star's vent with a well-placed torpedo volley.   So I would assume that Vader's well-placed heavy shot crippled Home Base."

Beside this class of ship are never meant to be designated as a capital, it was designated as a medical transport and a cargo vessel. Also the strongest weapon this class of ship have are just two light turbolaser batteries and 3 sets of light point-defense laser cannons, so of course it won't hold off against any ships the Imperials throws at them, especially a TIE advanced flown by Darth Vader himself. In conclusion it is just the class that the rebels use as capital ship sucks, and it will get better once the rebels get their hands on better ships like the providence class or the even the old republic vessel like the Venator or the acclamator class ships."

First, Vader stated on open comms that the Ghost was his.  That alone puts an end to the other ships firing. Second, Vader jumped out among the other ships even before that to strafe the rebel command ship.  With him zipping along right next to the rebel capital ships, the large guns from the Star Destroyers could not open up without risking hitting Vader."

I like Dark Troopers, they were iconic figures that were often associated with the Empire in many works of the EU (especially games), and I think they would add an interesting touch to the show, as a grim reminder of the Clone Wars, either as clone cyborgs or as battle droids (following on the concept of the droid army)."

Everything's further muddied by KotOR II's more charismatic and relatable characters being emphatically wrong about the nature of the Force compared to most other sources.   As for the downvotes, I think it might be because Revan's story, as it was originally in KotOR and as it has been since, related primarily to the Jedi, and Rebels isn't really about about how Jedi conduct themselves. Whatever one thinks of his story, I'd argue it's irrelevant to Rebels."

starwarsrebels,3allpa,comet997,7,Mon Jun 22 09:06:54 2015 UTC,"So what you'd like is for the writers and/or artists to go out of their way to name or face drop a character totally irrelevant to the current proceedings; a character only recently given any canon definition, and controversially at that; a character whose primary contribution was a heretical view of the Force that he himself would eventually recant and that runs in pretty stark contrast to OOC accepted definitions of the Force. And the main reason to do this is to touch on none of these, just to point at this guy so that people that like him can feel better.  I mean, I guess, but there are way better things to name drop."

But that's not necessarily true for canon, as they've stated (and shown) that they're willing and able to change any details they wish. You can even see that in Rebels, where Phoenix Squadron was comprised of A-Wings, something that Legends didn't have come about until after Yavin.  Fact is, we know that Fett clones, in canon, have been pushed out of active service starting shortly after the Clone Wars ended, with Vader expressing surprise to see one in service on Murkhana just five years after the Clone Wars ended."

starwarsrebels,3akhqe,SKLKNKR,8,Sun Jun 21 06:12:47 2015 UTC,I really hope that they see some role in the rebellion. The show would really benefit for having more rebellion characters and recurring background characters in general. I mean this episode the imperial governor was killed off. So the cast is shrinking a bit. Rex in particular should play a role. It'd be a disservice to fans of such a large character in TCW and to the character in general to leave him rotting on an ice cube.

starwarsrebels,3alhr3,AHMilling,5,Sun Jun 21 11:16:54 2015 UTC,"Not really. But it wouldn't hurt. Be warned though... season 1 - 3,5 can be hard to get throught at some points.  The show matured alot over the years, so as long as you accept that, and just blaze through the early parts you'll be fine.  I'm 21. I started plowing through it a few years ago, when season 4 was airing in the US.  I started watching because I wanted to know more about who this Anakin whom old Ben spoke of in EPIV truly was. It was kinda glossed over in EPIII (he went depressed/afraid/dark pretty fast), but you get to really see that man here, with both his good sides and bad sides.  I also could not stand Ahsoka at first, but by the end of the show she became my favorite character in all of Star Wars (a title previously held by Luke).  And hey... it's all canon, so might as well educate yourself on the lore ;) (season 6 in particular has some big impact on the canon... directly from Lucas too)  PS... After watching the show, rewatching EPIII had a lot bigger impact on me. When order 66 went down... oh man... all those people flashing before my eyes.  And whenever Kanan mentiones something about the old Jedi Order, in Rebels. My go to mental images are of the Clone Wars, not the movies... so, yeah... it did have an impact on me."
starwarsrebels,3alhr3,pufferpig,2,Sun Jun 21 11:39:28 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot for this long and quick reply! I will check out clone wars first then.  I'm 22 so i grew up at the start of the prequels (watched the originals first).
starwarsrebels,3alhr3,pufferpig,2,Sun Jun 21 11:55:53 2015 UTC,"Heh, same here. One of my first memories is watching episode IV ;) And the only Star Wars film I remember watching in the cinema is ep III.   Pumped for ep VII!!!  (also,  I was a little bastard who laughed when that little boy asked Anakin ""what are we gonna do?"")"
starwarsrebels,3alhr3,Guyote_,3,Sun Jun 21 12:15:20 2015 UTC,I was 6 when Ep I came out. I still remember walking into the cinema and seeing the life-size cutout of Darth Maul and shitting my pantaloons.
starwarsrebels,3alhr3,divinesleeper,3,Mon Jun 22 06:29:33 2015 UTC,"There's a useful ""vital episode"" guide if you don't feel like watching them all.  Some personal comments on that guide (I didn't make it):   The Mortis arc on season 3 is also pretty good imo...it just delves deeper into the lore in a way that some people dislike. But I liked it, and I advize to watch it. Personally not too fond of the hostage crisis episode. Cad Bane is a cool character but he shines more in other episodes. I didn't watch the Maul's Empire arc because I think his return after Phantom Menace was bs, and it didn't seem relevant to the over-arching plot. But it's supposed to be good so if you like Maul you might still wanna watch it.  The most important arcs for getting the Ahsoka Anakin dynamic are Citadel Arc, Kadavo Arc and Ahsoka Framed Arc."
starwarsrebels,3alhr3,Sapitoelgato,3,Sun Jun 21 14:20:37 2015 UTC,"You don't have to watch The Clone Wars to understand Rebels, but you will get so much more out of the show if you do.

starwarsrebels,3alhr3,gtfomyinternets,2,Mon Jun 22 04:14:26 2015 UTC,"It's still worth it to watch it chronologically. Trust me, so many things just don't make sense if you watch it by release order. For example, you'll hear characters talk about previous battles that you've never seen. Then 10 episodes later you see that battle but not even sure if it's the same one or remember the connection. In your case I would watch 301 Clone Cadets 105 Rookies , then follow chronologically from season 2 onward.

The only S2 episode premiering this weekend is the hourlong opening movie. The rest of the episodes aren't premiering until fall. It's likely a mislabeling from Verizon."
starwarsrebels,3af89p,RVierra327,3,Fri Jun 19 17:49:29 2015 UTC,"Yep. Just like season 1, there is a special movie event coming out tomorrow, which is two episodes worth in length. The first episode of season 2 will begin in the Fall.  Both listings are Siege of Lothal, which is the movie event between season 1 and 2."
starwarsrebels,3af89p,Sapitoelgato,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:52:50 2015 UTC,Siege of Lothal is 1 hour. it counts as two episodes.
starwarsrebels,3adn16,darexinfinity,24,Fri Jun 19 07:00:46 2015 UTC,I think there's a very good reason why the heavy weights are now involved - Lothal appears to be rich in the crystals required for the Death Star beam.
starwarsrebels,3adn16,Nevr_Surrendr,5,Fri Jun 19 07:31:15 2015 UTC,I hadn't heard that before.   Very cool!
starwarsrebels,3adn16,Matsuyama_Mamajama,2,Fri Jun 19 12:57:40 2015 UTC,"That's a really good theory. I get they are the main characters of the show, so plot's a pretty good reason, but in-universe, why would the Lothal rebel cell be so... special? Other than they have a Jedi and a Force-sensitive being trained by the Jedi, of course... I would like to see the other cells as well."
starwarsrebels,3adn16,tommmytom,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:10:38 2015 UTC,....  ..........  Uh oh  So how much time has passed in universe since the end of season 1? Basically no-one is safe until we found out if any of the characters will be in the rogue squadron spin off film.
starwarsrebels,3adn16,Sithsaber,2,Sun Jun 21 16:46:39 2015 UTC,Rogue 1 is not about Rogue Squadron.
starwarsrebels,3adn16,SuddenlyFrogs,3,Mon Jun 22 11:00:27 2015 UTC,I saw the leak. Don't say it.
starwarsrebels,3adn16,Sithsaber,6,Mon Jun 22 12:54:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's too much. I don't think you could really just have it be them doing random missions for 3 seasons, they had to have higher stakes and bigger villains. We'll see this weekend, but I have a feeling they are just going to be chased out of Lothal and we won't see the Emperor or Vader again for awhile. But the inquistor's that have been harvested will most likely be their villains for the rest of the season and then have Vader and the Emperor come back at the end of the season. I have faith in the writing team to have more twists for the next few seasons. I expect it to go 4-5 seasons until it catches up with A New Hope."
starwarsrebels,3adn16,fringyrasa,2,Fri Jun 19 10:20:15 2015 UTC,"So, you think they will show how Kanan and Ezra get taken out? It has to happen before Episode 4."
starwarsrebels,3adn16,Umlaut69,3,Fri Jun 19 16:43:50 2015 UTC,"Maybe, idk. Since the show mirrors Episode IV so much, I expect Kanan to die in order to protect Ezra. But considering how we all thought Ahsoka was going to die and still lives, I could also see them saying Ezra and a few other members were still with the rebellion and were off doing something during the original trilogy.  Either that or the show could end with them arriving on Alderaan and well...we know how that ends."
starwarsrebels,3adn16,fringyrasa,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:31:36 2015 UTC,Does it?  With the new canon they could easily have these characters live on though the OT and into the New Trilogy.
starwarsrebels,3adn16,idejmcd,3,Fri Jun 19 17:22:46 2015 UTC,"If they stayed on Lothal, the show would have a very quick conclusion, the point of Vader is that he puts such a tight grip over the planet that he forces them to leave. I can only speculate but I highly doubt that Vader will be personally dealing with them after the episode tomorrow. I'm sure the two inquisitors and all the other new characters will allow the show to continue for a very long time"
starwarsrebels,3adn16,Blackfire853,2,Fri Jun 19 17:45:20 2015 UTC,"Well we could see Biggs and Wedge, Han and Chewie, Jabba, Boba. Plus it looks like they're using this show to bridge CW to the OT so Cad Bane and Ventress aren't out of the picture either. Not sure where Maul is."
starwarsrebels,3adn16,electrikyle,3,Fri Jun 19 10:59:09 2015 UTC,"Dave has said there is no plan for Cad Bane, but he did mention Embo.  I can't properly tag this without giving it away, sorry."
starwarsrebels,3adn16,SKLKNKR,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:40:14 2015 UTC,"Did he say there are no plans for Cad Bane in Rebels, or no plans at all? Because that's kinda disappoinf to be honest, if the latter."

starwarsrebels,3adn16,SKLKNKR,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:57:16 2015 UTC,This comment just made me even more excited than I already was.
starwarsrebels,3adn16,zakfennie,2,Fri Jun 19 15:14:46 2015 UTC,Lol every person complained rebels season 1 was too slow and this guys shows up says its too fast without even watching season 2 first. What a great time we live in
starwarsrebels,3adn16,triarii3,2,Sat Jun 20 23:13:33 2015 UTC,"Due to the storytelling we've seen in Rebels, I suspect the show's ending has already been determined (roughly, they might not know every single specific but the general gist) and they've probably mapped out how many seasons it'll take to get there. So it's not like some other TV shows that just keep going. This show is gonna end, and it may end sooner than some people think. I'd guess 3-5 seasons. So personally I don't think the show is going too fast, it seems to be going at the pace it needs to.  And before anyone gets too depressed that Rebels may be ending earlier than they wanted, I'm sure when Rebels end, there will be another animated SW show that Filoni and his crew will create and jump onto just like they did from Clone Wars to Rebels. Animated Star Wars shows won't be ending anytime soon."
starwarsrebels,3adn16,BaconKnight,4,Tue Jun 23 02:12:31 2015 UTC,I can give you one reason: A lot of people that are working for Rebels  (mainly story) working also on StarWars 7-9 and the anthology films. They expand the universe and set-up some characters for the upcoming movies. StarWars 7 is coming in 5 month. I heard 1 character from Rebels is walking through the screen in StarWars 7.
starwarsrebels,3adn16,bifi85,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:13:37 2015 UTC,I would love to see a grizzled clone trooper walk by the camera and look right at us. Where did you hear this?
starwarsrebels,3adn16,ChaseDFW,2,Fri Jun 19 14:09:10 2015 UTC,Clones are all dead by now. They age faster than normal.
starwarsrebels,3adn16,Umlaut69,2,Fri Jun 19 16:45:06 2015 UTC,I'm sure the writers could invent a reason why this isn't 100% true if they wanted to.
starwarsrebels,3adn16,idejmcd,0,Fri Jun 19 17:24:11 2015 UTC,I always thought they were made to age faster until they reached maturity after which aging would happen at a regular pace.
starwarsrebels,3adn16,bionix90,2,Sat Jun 20 14:15:43 2015 UTC,Rex looked old as fuck in the trailer for season 2

starwarsrebels,3ab0rb,FlyinWhee,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:59:58 2015 UTC,I had a hard time visualising Vidian as well. I actually made a thread about it haha
starwarsrebels,3ab0rb,hyperlancer,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:08:45 2015 UTC,"I do the same thing, and as others have said here I too struggled with Count Vidian from A New Dawn. Another thing that's hard for me is keeping a consistent ""art style"" in my head. I'm reading Lords of the Sith right now, and I picture everything in live-action for Vader and Palpatine, but then my mind always goes to an animated style for the Ryloth scenes. Between Cham being in TCW, and watching a ton of Hera in Rebels, my mind just won't allow for live-action Twi'leks, and it's really annoying.  Also, when I read Darth Plagueis last year, it was extremely difficult to picture teenage Palpatine. I even googled images of a young Ian McDiarmid but it didn't help much. Palpatine pretty much looked like a 60 year old man for his entire life in that book for me."
starwarsrebels,3ab0rb,hyperlancer,2,Tue Jun 23 14:29:40 2015 UTC,"I actually have the exact same problem with art style! Too many different Star Wars mediums clashing in my head, live action, clone wars and the comics. Imagining Cham was especially hard, I agree. In regards to Vidian, i actually posted a thread about his appearance in this sub while reading the book. Still haven't found any decent art of him to this day haha, which sucks cause I thought he was a pretty cool villain.   Imagining a red-headed Palps was definitely a struggle. I pretty much just looked up okay-looking red-headed actors to sub in for Ian McDiarmid in my mind.   I feel like there should be a sub dedicated to star wars character art for EU readers."
starwarsrebels,3a6v92,Cevan,11,Wed Jun 17 18:15:18 2015 UTC,I'm really excited for the moment Vader sees Asoka. Really curious about how he is gonna react to seeing her alive.
starwarsrebels,3a6v92,Berzerkerwar,7,Wed Jun 17 22:59:00 2015 UTC,"I saw a behind the scenes video talking about Vader and Dave Filoni says that he views Asoka as something he ""needs to destroy"" because she reminds him of who he used to be.   Sorry, I'm on mobile so I can't link the video"
starwarsrebels,3a6v92,pd336819,2,Thu Jun 18 09:49:46 2015 UTC,"I remember seeing something similar. Filoni said at this point in Rebels, Vader is at his darkest. Pure evil with no sign of the light Luke sees a decade later.   I'm torn because on one hand I agree Vader should be at his most menacing, but I also want to see that good come out for just a moment with Ahsoka.   I can't wait to see how this plays out!"
starwarsrebels,3a6v92,Nevr_Surrendr,4,Thu Jun 18 10:53:35 2015 UTC,"After reading Lords of the Sith, that argument makes a lot more sense.  Anakin's transition from good to bad and back again has been MAJORLY bolstered by new canon.  He's driven to the dark side by fear, but he clings to it out of hatred of what Anakin Skywalker was and wants to destroy all ties to him.  It's almost out of shame.  It's very sad.  It's amazing, considering it was a relatively shallowly established transition in the movies."
starwarsrebels,3a6v92,5aucy,2,Thu Jun 18 14:51:27 2015 UTC,"Also in the new Vader comics, there's a lot of references to him having trouble dealing with the memories of his past."
starwarsrebels,3a6v92,usernameshmoosername,2,Thu Jun 18 17:13:30 2015 UTC,Yeah. New canon has been awesome at improving existing canon without being too limited or overshadowing events already in place. Especially with Vader.
starwarsrebels,3a6v92,5aucy,0,Thu Jun 18 17:38:20 2015 UTC,"Weird i posted this 10 minutes ago, am i banned or something? Because it's not showing up at all on this sub but it is showing up on my user feed."

The mods remove one post for  incorrectly tagging spoilers and then let another user go on and do the exact same thing. I wasn't even mad. I made a mistake.

starwarsrebels,3a1xmi,mrpiggywinkles52,19,Tue Jun 16 17:02:49 2015 UTC,"well, if we go by regular bullet physics, a recoiled shot has less force than a direct hit, if her armor can withstand a direct hit, then a recoil shot will probably knock her down, but not out.. i guess.. it's all fictional physics."
starwarsrebels,3a1xmi,cebt,6,Tue Jun 16 17:09:24 2015 UTC,"I guess...I think they could have captured the same sense of threat from Vader if they just shot Sabine in the arm, then you don't have people screaming bullshit."

starwarsrebels,3a1xmi,BurningBushJr,7,Tue Jun 16 21:22:45 2015 UTC,Nobody was picking it apart though. It was blatant and on screen. It's a TV show where your meant to care about the characters and get into the adventure and fear for them  When someone takes a shot to the face and lives it removes that aspect from the show

starwarsrebels,3a1xmi,Kings_Gold_Standard,3,Wed Jun 17 05:10:29 2015 UTC,Mando Armor.
starwarsrebels,3a1xmi,Its_just_ham,5,Wed Jun 17 03:19:42 2015 UTC,"Well remember what Tarkin said: No casualties. She and by extension the Ghost crew use only as much force as they need. So the blasters are probably set to a lower setting.   It's the best I got. If not that, then plot armor."

The problem I have with the story is the plot armour that the main characters have. Rebels isn't the only one to have that problem but it is frustrating to watch Stormtroopers missing from literally 10metres away."
starwarsrebels,3a1xmi,gabed-em,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:40:41 2015 UTC,I came from TCW but I loved the Art style of rebels from the start. I didn't see it as Star Wars Disney edition. IMO it just fit the show really well. It felt Star Wars from day one. Whilst it wouldn't fit the prequel era (or the sequel one by the looks) it fits the OT well.

starwarsrebels,3a1xmi,jcrave,4,Tue Jun 16 18:40:35 2015 UTC,I think this helps communicate that Vader really is on a whole other level. He was apparently hit with a giant piece of metal and he was fine and then he just calmly advanced while the rebels were turning tail and running.

starwarsrebels,3a1xmi,SollyJoe,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:21:22 2015 UTC,But it is different armor. Storm Trooper armor is mass produced cheap stuff and Sabine is only seen killing them occasionally. Her helmet and chest piece are made of different material and the chest piece was already absurdly small. Her getting hit in the two armor points is better than her getting hit somewhere on her suit and getting back up.

Mara Jade would have too much impact to be included directly, especially with episode 7 coming out.  Thrawn might appear eventually but I doubt he will in Rebels.  Dave is smart enough not to re-canonize things that don't make sense or would confuse younger watchers.  That's not to say we won't get similar characters, but they will be developed as needed."
starwarsrebels,39ub23,SKLKNKR,2,Mon Jun 15 16:16:17 2015 UTC,"Have you seen the season 2 trailer yet?  What I liked:  The consistent cast was a major plus for me over TCW.  I also love the character interactions and the enemy escalation.  I love that they used a bunch of unused OT concept art as well.  My favorite scene would have to be Tarkin's ""You don't know how to win a war"" interplayed with Ezra's stand up and fight speech.  The lighting of the scene and the destruction of the tower are just great.  What I didn't like: How Kallus got 15 minutes of fame and then it was the inquisitors turn.  I know this is going to change for the season 2 opener, but I didn't like it in S1.  I think Chopper is a little too childish, but I love the cast otherwise.  I didn't really like how mundane the plots to some episodes were either, but that's a minor gripe.  Season 2: Backgrounds, lots of character background development, other than that there really isn't anything I am longing to see plot wise, I'd love to see more unused OT concept art though.  Basically they have already confirmed everything I wanted to see in season 2."
starwarsrebels,39ub23,SKLKNKR,3,Sun Jun 14 21:38:51 2015 UTC,Hell yeah I have! :D  I think the female Inquisitor is Barris. :)
starwarsrebels,39ub23,SKLKNKR,3,Sun Jun 14 21:48:06 2015 UTC,"Seems to be the common consensus, especially after the concept art."
starwarsrebels,39ub23,benjammin29,2,Sun Jun 14 21:53:47 2015 UTC,AHSOKA!!!!  Literally my favorite part of the show.  I hated that her story wasn't completely finished and I'm definitely looking forward to her joining the crew.  Hoping they don't kill her off.
starwarsrebels,39ub23,Matsuyama_Mamajama,2,Sun Jun 14 23:32:39 2015 UTC,"I loved it for the same reason you did--it feels so much like the originals. And they aren't afraid to go places with the story that are a bit dark for what's considered youth television. It reminds me of the Avatar series' in that regard. I know a lot of people don't like Chopper, but I've always been a sucker for the droids. He's a jerk and I think its hilarious.   My only real gripe with the show is the animation style. I don't care for it too much. Although it has grown on me since the pilot. But hey, if all I have to bug me is the animation, I guess that says the show itself is pretty good.   Since they're re-introducing Ashoka I've started watching Clone Wars, but because the setting is the prequels its been more difficult for me to get into it. People say its takes a few seasons to take off though, so I'm sticking through it. And I just want to be familiar with Ashoka. I feel like I won't be able to enjoy some scenes as much as everyone else in season 2 of Rebels if I don't know her whole back story or if I'm less attached to her as a character."
starwarsrebels,39ub23,SKLKNKR,3,Mon Jun 15 00:34:17 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that TCW skips around.  There is a chronological list available that you can google.  Personally, I watched everything with Anakin, Ahsoka, and major clone battles, and loved them.  I was not a fan of any Padme or Jar Jar episodes.  In short, I felt justified in skipping some episodes.    I thought General Grievous was a great villain and much more of a danger than in Ep III.    I loved Honda and Cad Bane.  Great characters.  The Umbaran episodes were my absolute favorites.  In season 3 or 4, all about the clones, especially Captain Rex.  You'll want to get to know Rex as much as Ahsoka."
starwarsrebels,39ub23,HalcyonWind,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:12:23 2015 UTC,"Yep, I've been making sure I follow the chronological order. I'm somewhere in the middle of season 2, so I'm not that far in yet and I do believe people when they say it gets better. I've watched plenty of shows to know that sometimes you just have to hang in there till it hits its stride.   I liked Grievous in Episode III, and I like that they're including him in the series and they're in constant pursuit of him. I'll have to rewatch episode III after this series, mainly because everything is going to hit so much harder.   I like Rex quite a bit so far. Another reason to watch since he and his group are all in Rebels now. Just too many characters I need to get acquainted with before the series starts."

starwarsrebels,39yxnq,jeobleo,3,Tue Jun 16 15:45:47 2015 UTC,"There is no official designation like ""T-65B"" or ""TIE/ln"" they just refer to them as ""Lothal TIEs"".  While I haven't looked over them very distinctly, I believe the ISD models are ISD-1s, same as the one from the opening of ANH.  The Gozanti's are different models/versions, the Arquitens are different models/versions, I'm willing to bet the AT-ATs and A-wings from season 2 will be different variants than their OT counterparts.  The AT-AT is a fun case, as it seems to have neck armor, leaving me to wonder why the AT-ATs on Hoth were different, it seems like a step back.  So I guess you should treat everything but the vehicles as the same.  Vader is obviously Vader, the stormtroopers don't look spot on... etc."

They didn't change her appearance!  I know this was in the interim between Ep 2 and 3, and there was a gap, but during that time, Ashoka never grows.  Fast forward to a couple of years, if that, after Ep 3 and she's a 30 something woman.    But to OP's remark, yes, she should have grown into her eyes, her face should have been longer and fuller with the same exact eyes, you know, like how it happens everywhere in nature."

The shape, size, ""personality"" etc of her eyes is the biggest difference for me.  I can't really say I'm upset or disappointed....but it's not quite right."
starwarsrebels,394b1r,Matsuyama_Mamajama,7,Tue Jun 9 05:07:02 2015 UTC,"A lot of people here have attractions to aliens. But seriously, I'm not judging. If you knew me personally.... ho boy. Anyway, jokes aside, I much prefer the art style of TCW in general over Rebels. Being born in the prequel generation, this could partially be due to bias, although I truly do enjoy the style of TCW and my first impression of Rebels was that it was a little... worse. However, I very much enjoy they're respecting the original trilogy with this change of style, which is something I can understand. I think I can live if the art style is different. The only thing that really bugs me are the ultra-thin lightsabers, but it's fine.   With Ahsoka... I recognized the voice (and her), and I like the style overall. The eyes threw me off at first, but I guess they're trying to make them more ""realistic"" (aka human-like). I'm not disappointed though, I am used to it."
starwarsrebels,394b1r,tommmytom,5,Wed Jun 10 17:58:05 2015 UTC,"I think the main reason is the art style. The whole OT and that era is meant to be sharper and less stylised. There is a paragraph in Tarkin about it and about how he loves everything being less exagerated. I think that is the main reason, but I mean I don't think it's a big issue, you can definetily lose a jaw line like that later in life."
starwarsrebels,394b1r,DunnPounder,5,Tue Jun 9 09:49:14 2015 UTC,I'm not a fan of Rebels' visual style at all. But I realize these things aren't made for me so I don't really mind. Same with TCW but I think their look is a little more realistic.
starwarsrebels,394b1r,cultstatus,3,Tue Jun 9 07:57:35 2015 UTC,You really think this is more realistic?
starwarsrebels,394b1r,ImNotASWFanboy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:42:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can't wrap my head around people thinking TCW had a more realistic style when you have examples like Dooku. While Rebels is clearly stylized, it pales in comparison to the stylization going on in TCW.   It's almost like the Rebels style is a melding of TCW and real life, possibly to make it easier when they have movie actors like Billy Dee Williams and Jimmy Smits appear to look like themselves rather than caricature."
starwarsrebels,394b1r,nihilance,4,Mon Jun 22 13:04:19 2015 UTC,"As for the general visual style of Rebels, I kinda wish their torsos had a little more texture than the flat designs they have.  Also, their feet seem to be able to perfectly stick to the floor to be used as leverage when sitting down. nobody leans forward when sitting down to keep their center of gravity like we do naturally in real life. If we tried to sit down like they do in Rebels, we'd be knocking our chairs over backwards or sitting down rather heavily."
starwarsrebels,394b1r,Vlinux,6,Wed Jun 10 03:02:11 2015 UTC,"I like TCW-Ahsoka more, she was a bit more sexy. The TCW style has a craggy featured comic look. The Rebels Ahsoka looks for me a bit more human ""normal"". Overall we know that the creators of Rebels are big StarWars fans by themselves and everybody loves Ahsoka. So their could be some reasons why she looks like this beside the different artstyle: Maybe they aged her face on the computer and that was the realistic outcome. Maybe they prepare Ahsoka for a real movie so that she can be played by an actor without CGI. Ahsoka style: TCW-future / Rebels / TCW-polished"
starwarsrebels,394b1r,bifi85,4,Tue Jun 9 10:21:54 2015 UTC,TCW had facial features which were more nebulous in terms of earth race which was a plus for non-white fans.  I definitely prefer Rebels to the Mortis future vision but she did lose a little of that universality in the translation.
starwarsrebels,394b1r,RealVoltar,4,Tue Jun 9 06:27:21 2015 UTC,I prefer her look in Rebels. Something about that vision of her as an adult in TCW bugs me.

starwarsrebels,38vbx0,RealVoltar,5,Sun Jun 7 18:31:49 2015 UTC,"Sooo... Judging by the gray lines circling around her... Force Vision?  http://i.imgur.com/qXxRpi5.png  But who is having the vision? Is it a vision off Ahsoka, or the end reaction of Ahsoka's vision? SO MANY QUESTIONS!!!!  Edit:  Dat face doe... So many possible innuendos xD  Edit 2: Better screenshot http://i.imgur.com/UZTqhQh.png  Edit 3: Elaboration  Judging by the second screenshot, it seems that it is in fact Ahsoka getting a vision, and that the reaction is at the beginning, not the end.  Either she got a premonition of something bad going down (like she did when seeing Padme get assassinated), or she sensed Vader / her old Master.  My bet is on her having a vision of the Delta Zero happening.  Edit 4: Edit harder...  It's cool that Dave Filoni rethreads this theme of Ahsoka and Anakin being very powerful force users, getting visions etc... Filoni also said ""Ahsoka is powerful because of her connection to Anakin"" in the recent ""The Padawan Lives"" video on the Star Wars YouTube channel...   It'll be interesting to see where that goes."
starwarsrebels,38vbx0,pufferpig,2,Mon Jun 8 07:23:24 2015 UTC,I've begun to think that the bdz isn't happening.   There's apparently something important about Lothal to the Empire and I don't think they'd torch the whole planet.
starwarsrebels,38vbx0,RealVoltar,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:36:43 2015 UTC,Yeah... Makes sense
starwarsrebels,38vbx0,pufferpig,2,Mon Jun 8 07:22:54 2015 UTC,I think maybe she realizes who vader is and shes in shock

There are like no more major, show-original Imperials in this show besides the Inkies that have yet to appear.  EDIT: Or he could be talking to Vader... 'He' could be Tarkin or Vader."

I guess that's good, though, seeing as their past teasers have given away some of the best moments and twists in the first season."
starwarsrebels,38vbx0,BlueSmoke95,11,Wed Jun 17 22:15:13 2015 UTC,It is a teaser after all. I have high hopes for the premier.

starwarsrebels,38vbx0,SKLKNKR,2,Sun Jun 7 15:05:40 2015 UTC,If you liked Rebels you'll likely enjoy TCW as well.  It's fundamentally different but it's Star Wars through and through.

A shady underworld organization whom we know little about (canon wise)? Sounds awesome. Personally, I think the Rebels will attempt to strike a deal with them to get food, water, medical supplies and the likes, only to have it be a trap or something. Sounds like an interesting episode/arc , in my opinion."

Taking advantage of the chaos and rioting in the city after the planet’s sacking, several gangsters joined forces and began seizing control of lower-city neighborhoods. The origin of the syndicate’s name is unclear, but a common phrase among despairing Coruscant citizens was “better a black sun than none.” Alas, hopes that Black Sun would bring order instead of anarchy died quickly. For Black Sun, the rioting and looting never really stopped. Although the gangsters have profitable spice- and weapons-trafficking operations, their members, almost to a man, have an extraordinary taste for violence. Civilians are extorted until they have nothing left to extort; afterwards, they’re used for target practice. City blocks are incinerated for the pleasure of demolitionists. Despite the efforts of the Justicars’ Brigade, Black Sun has become a force to be reckoned with. The Republic Senate has begun to realize the threat Black Sun represents, but with the syndicate’s influence already beginning to stretch beyond Coruscant, stopping it may be impossible.""

starwarsrebels,385mh0,Larfox,6,Tue Jun 2 00:47:38 2015 UTC,Wanted to like the panel but they spent too much time (like 5 minutes!) on the stupid 1-10 level of excitement. About 2 minutes of actual discussion of the show. Still pumped for season 2 though!
starwarsrebels,385mh0,DrGreenlove,3,Tue Jun 2 18:02:16 2015 UTC,There are a lot of cast interviews on youtube that go more in depth into season 2 than this does.

starwarsrebels,37nah6,SKLKNKR,4,Thu May 28 23:22:59 2015 UTC,"I feel Offee is too powerful to be an Inquisitor, and would be a threat to Vader, which Vader in Legends was good at eliminating competition. I hope they do a novel on Offee, as they took an interesting turn at the end of the series."
starwarsrebels,37nah6,Sapitoelgato,5,Thu May 28 22:55:54 2015 UTC,"I think that's what everyone thinks, yo.  Problem is that Barriss is too skilled for an Inquisitor and there's no way Vader is going to allow the person who started a domino effect on Ahsoka to be in his ranks."
starwarsrebels,37nah6,CommanderVisor,2,Thu May 28 23:01:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think I'd worry about this becoming ""Clone Wars 2."" I thought I read somewhere that Ahsoka and Rex are just ancillary characters who won't appear in every episode, and I doubt Hondo is in more than one episode. I also thought I saw that Vader also was not in every episode.  Sounds to me like the focus is still on the Ghost and its crew, the scope is just going to be a little wider than season 1."
starwarsrebels,37nah6,HecticEpic,1 point,Sun May 31 20:41:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Rex and the clones are probably just going to stay on that planet, while Ahsoka has to deal with other rebel cells and spoilers for S2 premiere.

starwarsrebels,37nah6,SKLKNKR,1 point,Sun May 31 23:32:51 2015 UTC,What I meant is that they're probably going to stick around that planet for now. The planet they were fighting over was the same one they were living on (the white stone surface).

Kanan isn't even technically a fully trained Jedi and the clones slaughtered his master right in front of him.

starwarsrebels,37h7ev,FrankiePoops,22,Wed May 27 16:42:34 2015 UTC,I wonder if this'll tie in to Rogue One. That would be AWESOME if they're all working together to create cross media (?) stories.   Maybe we'll even get to see the Ghost crew on the big screen one day.
starwarsrebels,37h7ev,brace4impact93,12,Wed May 27 18:43:33 2015 UTC,"Aren't we still ""five years out"" from the events of Rouge One? Unless they introduce us to Felicity Jones, Ben Medelsohn, Diego Luna, or Riz Ahmed's character I don't see how we could have a tie in for season 2 and/or 3 with Rouge One. By season three, we would still be three-two years out from the battle of Yavin. If we assume that Rogue One happens slightly before the start of Ep. IV  However, It wouldn't be the first time Disney has done something like that. Look at Agents of Shield/Agent Carter those both flow in and out of the movies."
starwarsrebels,37h7ev,OSUTechie,7,Wed May 27 20:01:06 2015 UTC,Maybe there could be a time skip?  I read somewhere that Rebels was only ever supposed to run three or four seasons or something like that.
starwarsrebels,37h7ev,brace4impact93,2,Wed May 27 21:05:18 2015 UTC,"They could easily tie it in by just introducing one or two characters, or even characters related in some way to the those characters, similar to how Hera is related to Cham Syndulla and he appears in TCW and Lords of the Sith. Still a tie-in in some form that fleshes out the character, but not enough that people seeing/reading one will be completely removed and confused if they haven't read/seen the other.  It's not like the characters of Rogue One ""pop"" into being at the beginning of the movie and have no backstory before."
starwarsrebels,37h7ev,RVierra327,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:15:01 2015 UTC,"I agree, that is why I said they could introduce us to the characters. But there is no way Rebels can lead directly into Rouge One in season 2. Season 3 maybe, if they give us a time jump."

starwarsrebels,37h7ev,Pingonaut,2,Wed May 27 20:56:10 2015 UTC,"In a very real way, they already are working together to create transmedia (that's the word for it) stories. And those stories take place in our heads and here, in social interactions, as much as they do when we sit down and watch the show/movie. Check out Henry Jenkins' ""Covergence Culture."" It's a few years old, so there's no mention of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (which is the big transmedia titan these days) but he does discuss The Matrix and its early use of anime and games to help tell a larger story than the films alone."
starwarsrebels,37h7ev,Tularion,6,Thu May 28 04:08:25 2015 UTC,"I could easily see characters from Rogue One having cameos. Probably won't be a tie-in time-wise, if Rebels is planned to go on for a while."
starwarsrebels,37h7ev,CommanderVisor,3,Thu Jun 11 04:51:02 2015 UTC,It's been rumored that Felicity Jones was cast to play the role of an older Sabine.
starwarsrebels,37h7ev,suss2it,6,Wed May 27 20:28:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't want any Rebels cameos in any of the movies that take place chronologically after it, because it just ends up ruining the tension with that character, since then we would know that that character would survive the show."
starwarsrebels,37h7ev,CommanderVisor,2,Thu May 28 04:13:13 2015 UTC,"Rebels could be over by the time Rogue is in theaters, or it could even have a time skip and be set post A New Hope."

A Padawan braid was a type of braid worn by Jedi Padawans who were of species that grew hair on their heads, although some hairless Padawans fashioned braids out of silka beads and other materials. When a Padawan was declared a Knight, the braid was shorn off with a lightsaber. If a Padawan was instead expelled from the Order, the braid was ripped off, as happened to Ahsoka Tano. In the New Jedi Order, the practice of apprentices wearing braids was all but forgotten, though Ben Skywalker revived the old tradition for himself when he was unofficially apprenticed to Jacen Solo.

I really don't see the team killing off their baby until at least season 3's finale. In fact, I bet that Ahsoka won't die at all in Rebels. Is that unlikely? Yeah, but everyone said she had to die in Clone Wars, too. Death isn't the only option, folks! Though it is the most likely. Hmm, we'll see! Florrum. We better see Hondo's pirate base again, damnit! Who knows, maybe we'll see the young Jedi-turned-pirate Katooni? The Three Clones. How much of these boys do you think we'll see? I hope they play a big role in the season, because Clones >>>>>>>>>> Imperials. Anyone have any idea what species the new male Inquisitor is? He looks like Frankenstein."

The show will still focus on the core crew of the Ghost."
starwarsrebels,37fii5,Tuskin38,3,Wed May 27 15:20:01 2015 UTC,"I dunno. iirc, in ROTJ, Yoda did say Luke was the last Jedi. I'm pretty sure when they were writing the movie, the obvious implication was the actual one. However, stories like that are changed sometimes, and I can see them turning from ""Luke was actually the last Jedi"" to having some plot-twist, like ""Luke was the last Jedi........ that could defeat the Empire"", or Yoda just thought he had to tell Luke that to get him motivated. My point is, there could be multiple interpretations to what Yoda said in ROTJ, and I don't think what he said necessarily means that Kanan, Ezra, Ahsoka, and any other Jedi that appear have to die.   tl;dr - What Yoda said in ROTJ could have multiple interpretations, and some of the og Jedi and the new ones could live."

starwarsrebels,37fii5,MadMan2012,4,Wed May 27 15:30:07 2015 UTC,"Would he? I mean during TCW clones were around 13-15 by the end. Rex was I believe on Geonosis. So he's probably around 14. Which in Clone years makes him 28. 19 years later we have ANH so he'd be 66. I believe the OT takes place over the space of 4 or 5 years. So doubling that  he'd be 76 or so by the battle of Endor. Whilst it is a stretch for him to be fighting at that age he is essentially a soldier. That's who Rex is. So it does make some sort of sense.  76 really isn't old. Most people in our time live beyond that. In a galaxy where there's hyperspace travel I don't imagine it's too unrealistic for them to have people living at 76.  I think they age at twice the normal rate, wasn't that said in AOTC?"

starwarsrebels,37fii5,mrpiggywinkles52,3,Wed May 27 16:45:10 2015 UTC,"But it does give us a cool story. It gives continuity between the prequels and the OT in a new way, it's cool for someone like me who idolized Rex growing up to think he was a rebel fighter and didn't just die on some stupid planet in a rotting AT-TE. That's not what Rex would have done. It's true to his character. He was a soldier,loyal to the republic, so it stands to reason he'd fight to restore the Republic in the rebellion.  Hell you could argue Vader being in Rebels is unneeded fanservice. I mean really, the galaxy is full of inquisitors. Yet they sent Vader to hunt down essentially 2 jedi padawans and a bunch of misfits. They COULD have just sent more inquisitors. Now I understand why they decided to have Vader instead (in-universe and in reality) but it is to an extent unneeded fanservice."
starwarsrebels,37fii5,RealVoltar,2,Wed May 27 22:18:21 2015 UTC,"We don't know that the galaxy is ""full"" of inquisitors.  As of now, we know of three.    And personally, I would have no issue with Vader not being in this series, at least not in this role.  He's too OP for these guys.  If they end up with multiple confrontations and they escape repeatedly like the last inquisitor its going to make Vader look like crap.  So I hope we only get a couple scenes with him.  And you can think of Rex however you like, even if they end up contradicting it.  Personally, I'd rather wonder and guess what he got up to than find out he only became a random background character."
starwarsrebels,37fii5,CommanderVisor,2,Wed May 27 22:23:51 2015 UTC,Vader seems relatively dedicated to hunting the Rebel Alliance by the time E4 comes along.

On a side note, I just realized we still don't know why the Ghost crew came to Lothal anyway, and it seems that they weren't in contact with Fulcrum until after DoD. There's also another thing that further makes me question it in the S2 premiere, but I won't give spoilers here."

starwarsrebels,37fii5,iowajaycee,3,Wed Jun 10 17:06:59 2015 UTC,"Well, some of these clues are not necessarily in the show, looking back at my post, but if you pay enough attention to some stuff, you can figure it out.  According to the Crystal Crisis on Utapau arc from TCW, kyber crystals pack quite the punch when they explode. The writers (IIRC) confirmed that they are involved in the making of the Death Star. (I have to watch that arc again...)  It is also worth noting that the arc was released around the time Breaking Ranks aired. In that episode, they never bother explaining what kyber crystals do, but the explosion is pretty big. This ends up getting expanded on in Path Of The Jedi.  In PotJ, we find out about the temple on Lothal. The writers also confirmed that the reason why the temple is on Lothal is because of the abundance of kyber crystals...  There are also some references to Lothal's mining industry and the 5-year plan will end right into the time of ANH."

I can't wait to see exactly what planet the clones are on or why Hera needs the B-wing.  As I said in my post about it a while ago, maybe she needs it instead of just test piloting it.  I hope an interdictor cruiser forced the Ghost out of hyperspace and they need the B-wing in some way.  I also can't wait to see who the female inquisitor is, who she is voiced by, and what ship she flies.  Dave said in the ""Untold Clone Wars"" panel at celebration that they created a ship for Ventress to use, and it would be returning in Rebels (he hinted at an Imperial color scheme).  If you look closely at her arrival, you can tell it isn't a Sentinel class landing craft the male inquisitor uses.  Considering the design of the ship was based on concept art for the Republic gunship, this could also point to her identity being Barriss.

Also, Kinberg is wrote the premiere (IIRC), and earlier this month, he said that he was working on the season finale and he already wrote another 3rd episode in between.  Kinberg also said that by the time half of S1 aired, they were already in the middle of writing S2's story and scripts.  Plus, the clip where Hera pilots the B-wing hadn't been fully rendered yet at the time it was released (Celebration), so there's that.

starwarsrebels,37fii5,CommanderVisor,2,Thu May 28 04:50:13 2015 UTC,"Personally I'm hoping for a more threatening Empire. Up til now, the stormtroopers have been comically inept. I still recall how their walkers were unable to hit the one stolen by the cast in EP12 despite being less than a few meters behind it. I understand that this is a kid's show, but that level of ineptness takes me out of the action.   Action sequences aside, they come off as mustache twirling villains when they do obviously ""bad guy"" things like stealing fruit from a merchant, or forcing a family off it's land. Its not really the cold, emotionless, iron-fisted Empire that everyone is expected to fear. Not the one that supposedly wiped out entire races just because they refused to submit.  I hope we see some of that terribleness first hand, because as it stands the Empire resembles an inept street gang with a bunch of thugs in white plastic rather than the most terrible dictatorship the galaxy has seen since the Old Sith Empire.  I want to feel scared of seeing the white armor of a stormtrooper, of the sucking/hissing sound of Vader's mask. I want them to recapture the feeling you got when you saw Vader walk into the body-filled corridors of the Tantive IV.  Just a disclaimer: I like the series, despite what my opinion above may suggest. I love the way they go into the spirituality of the force. I like the way the show reminds me of Firefly. I like the main characters personalities, and how they come out in their dialogue. I hope I didn't give the impression that I believed the show to be bad."
starwarsrebels,37fii5,Its_just_ham,6,Fri Jun 5 13:55:28 2015 UTC,"The stormtroopers were never scary in the OT. There's a whole trope and meme about how shitty they were actually. But it would be better if Rebels changed our impression of them instead of continuing that trope. And Vader does seem appropriately threatening and badass in the season 2 trailer, so I'm not worried about that."
starwarsrebels,37fii5,SKLKNKR,3,Fri Jun 5 18:02:41 2015 UTC,"If the season opener doesn't please you, I'm not sure what will.

If you listen to everything in the show you can hear propaganda about using the ""Base Delta Zero initiative"" on a rebellious planet.  While it isn't shown, we all know what happened.

An artist (for lack of a better word...) that works on Rebels revealed an image of a place called Takabo City, and its landscape looks very similar to the one the clones have been living on this whole time.  I theorize that Hera and Ahsoka (and Chopper, yes) are maybe busy with something in Takabo City, so the rest of the crew goes to meet with some old friends of Ahsoka to help them out. At some point at night, the two Inquisitors confront Ahsoka. These episodes might also end up being more than one episode, but that's just me."

starwarsrebels,376gkn,Waddles77,11,Tue May 26 04:28:25 2015 UTC,"As for rumored, we might get to see Embo!  Oh, about Ventress, her book Dark Disciple comes out in July, and can be a game changer for her. It is based off of 8 unaired episode scripts from TCW."
starwarsrebels,376gkn,Sapitoelgato,8,Mon May 25 12:15:17 2015 UTC,It's crazy to think they planned out eight episodes for her. That's a third of a 24 episode season.
starwarsrebels,376gkn,Fourteen_of_Twelve,7,Mon May 25 21:23:03 2015 UTC,"No, the 8 episodes weren't meant to be told in a row. Half of them were for Season 7 and the other half was for Season 8, IIRC."
starwarsrebels,376gkn,CommanderVisor,5,Mon May 25 21:29:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the interesting thing, when you add up all TCW Legacy material released so far it is 8 from story reels, 4 from a comic, and now 8 from the novel, which adds up to 16 episodes worth of content! That is more than the Lost Missions."
starwarsrebels,376gkn,Sapitoelgato,1 point,Mon May 25 22:04:28 2015 UTC,Only the story reels are official though. The clips are glimpses into the behind the scene. I hope they one day get to officially release the stories in whatever medium. They all looked really interesting. I can only wonder how epic the series finale would have been if it wasn't canceled early.
starwarsrebels,376gkn,Sapitoelgato,7,Wed May 27 13:54:08 2015 UTC,"Saw Gerrera has been pretty much confirmed; the same rumor that said a while back that Sam Witwer was involved in Rebels also said that Andrew Kishino (Saw's voice actor) was also involved in Rebels. Since we now know that bit about Sam Witwer's involvemenf turned out to be true, Saw is almost certain to make an appearance at some point as well."
starwarsrebels,376gkn,Cevan,5,Wed May 27 14:03:20 2015 UTC,"I forgot about him.  This starwars.com post tells us the Onderon rebels are likely to make an appearance as well so it's possible we see Lux.   The Onderon arc, episodes 502, “A War on Two Fronts,” 503, “Front Runners,” 504, “The Soft War,” and 505, “Tipping Points,” shows us one of the groups that will play a role in the Rebel Alliance down the road."
starwarsrebels,376gkn,SKLKNKR,4,Mon May 25 15:02:55 2015 UTC,"That too; Saw along with the other Onderon rebels will almost certaintly pop up at some point in season two. I wonder if they're already part of the rebel network, or if they go to Onderon to recruit them. Ahsoka was on Onderon with them in the Clone Wars, so that connection is probably how they'd find out about them."
starwarsrebels,376gkn,Cevan,2,Mon May 25 15:41:40 2015 UTC,"This would interesting as Heras VA is his ex. Also, if he's back then maybe we'll see Ahsoka and Lux again. Or with Saw to further complicate things."

I'd like to see Barriss, but thats it, all the other characters can get their own book or comic or something to tie up their loose ends. From the OT tho, Boba definitely, and I feel Leia will show up eventually. Oh and hopefully an early form of Rogue Squadron (maybe to tie into the movie)"
starwarsrebels,376gkn,omarh14,7,Mon May 25 13:14:07 2015 UTC,I'd say Obi Wan is almost inevitably going to appear at some point.

I want to see them go to Tattoine and visit a ""fallen"" Jedi in a small hut and try to convince him to come out of retirement. This said person declines and says his time to get back in the good fight will come but he has unfinished business on Tattoine first!"
starwarsrebels,376gkn,hyperlancer,6,Mon May 25 13:53:25 2015 UTC,"I've played out a similar scenario in my head, but only with Ahsoka. Perhaps she has just learned a certain something terrible about Vader, and she needs to seek the truth and whole story from her old friend. Assuming Bail is sworn to secrecy about Obi-Wan's location and probably even his fate, I feel like this is one circumstance in which he would give it up, but only to her."
starwarsrebels,376gkn,Lurkndog,3,Mon May 25 21:26:59 2015 UTC,"I wasn't counting the holocron message, especially since it was 15 years old when we see it in Spark of Rebellion.   I am hoping for James Arnold Taylor to get a chance to bridge Ewan McGregor with Alec Guinness. And maybe to show that old Ben Kenobi was doing more than just languishing in exile on Tatooine."

starwarsrebels,376gkn,greggs92,2,Thu Jun 4 02:29:50 2015 UTC,"We've seen concept art for her and she's clearly female, and spoiler.  The guy you are talking about, Zare, also has his own young reader novels in which he is against the Empire.  While it's still possible it's his sister, it's much less likely than Barris or a new character due to the concept art."
starwarsrebels,376gkn,Lurkndog,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:23:35 2015 UTC,"I havent read the youhg novel, seems like I got a few stories to add to the reading list.  Also I havent looked at muxh concept art do thanks for exposing me to that.  However I think she is somehow important and having her as an inquisitor and the possible redemption or brother/sister duel is just too good to pass up imo.    Or lets say she is completely darkside and the ghost crew has to kill her and now zare finds out and swears revenge on the ghost crew and that is whqt turns him to the darkside.    Maybe im wrong but j think something like that would be more compelling that barriss coming back, although she does hsve unfinished business with ahsoka.  Imagine if bariss is somehow in a position to help the rebels but  will ahsoka fprgive her for the greatee good?But with all that being said what do i know, regardless im dure itll be excellent and entertaining so whatever happens happens."
starwarsrebels,376gkn,Tuskin38,2,Wed Jun 10 16:40:07 2015 UTC,"Boba Fett is almost guaranteed to show up at some point, but they may be keeping him in reserve, or waiting until the details of the standalone movie are finalized."

starwarsrebels,36p764,electrikyle,9,Thu May 21 09:19:19 2015 UTC,"To add to this, you get to see imperial cadets in the show. One is working undercover against the empire, but to find out more of his story, you need to read the junior novels involving him and his girlfriend.   Another character outside the show is in the canon novel A New Dawn, which is set 5 years before the show Rebels. Her name is Rae Sloane and she is in temporary command of a Star Destroyer. You learn a little bit about her throughout the book, and she puts a humane twist on that role of the empire.  Other than those two characters, the show doesn't give you a chance to see the Empire characters in a positive light. You do get to see a TIE Fighter pilot get the short end of the stick repeatedly."
starwarsrebels,36p764,Sapitoelgato,4,Thu May 21 01:09:35 2015 UTC,"I haven't read the books, but wasn't that his sister, the one that went missing, in the Imperial Cadets episode?"
starwarsrebels,36p764,Vendetta476,7,Thu May 21 01:26:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, Zare Leonis joined the Academy to find out what really led to his sister's disappearance. Between him and his girlfriend they work to find out more information (Zare by being in the Academy and his girlfriend Merei hacking into the system to find more information). You also get more of his story of events that lead into the episode he first appears in, and you get to read the interrogation scene. There is a lot more to his story that shows up in Rebels, and the second junior novel sets up a great conspiracy story (the first one has not as good)."

I've noticed that they aren't showing any confirmed kills on the ground, but I highly doubt a parachute would help a TIE fighter who just exploded into atoms.   Also note: 'Ever seen a Jedi Sir?' credit to u/Combine99100"
starwarsrebels,36p764,sweaty_wombat,4,Sat May 23 04:43:59 2015 UTC,"I remember that line now. But what about the times where they shoot, or blow up, Imperial military? I could understand why the rest of the crew has no problem with that, because they'd been doing it for a while, but I find it odd that Ezra was totally OK with it from the beginning."
starwarsrebels,36p764,CommanderVisor,5,Thu May 21 01:05:32 2015 UTC,"They actually stun most of the stormtroopers. Ezra's gunsaber apparently stuns, for example, and if you look closely at the 'corpses', they're moving."

They'd rather keep the Imperials alive, but apparently they won't hesitate to kill them if it is necessary to complete the mission. I'm interested in seeing how this theme will develop as they get involved with the rest of the Alliance, and as the situation escalates and they are confronted with the gritty side of war."

starwarsrebels,36p764,Iron-Shark,8,Fri May 22 15:46:41 2015 UTC,I hope eventually they make friends with a stormtrooper who changes sides. I know Ezra did with a couple youngin's but someone who actually is a trooper would be cool.
starwarsrebels,36p764,MadMan2012,4,Thu May 21 02:29:39 2015 UTC,"But in Clone Wars they made the attempt to humanize the clones and give them each different personalities. Also Clone Wars was made to appeal to a slightly older audience and it looks like season 2 is going to be slightly darker too.  Death in cartoons these days is actually pretty common(adventure time,transformers prime,etc). Unlike say in the 80s or early 90s when they censored the word kill with destroy."
starwarsrebels,36p764,Ray3142,4,Thu May 21 04:36:16 2015 UTC,"In TCW they set Geonosians on fire, with flame throwers. So shooting a few stormtroopers and having Zeb beating them up and the Jedi wannabes doing their best not to actually hit anyone with a lightsaber makes it work out. So what if Sabine shoots a stormtrooper every once in awhile, it's okay because Ezra's lightsaber shoots stun bolts not lethal ammo.  Also so were the clones in TCW and they got shot all the time."

starwarsrebels,36p764,artycharred,2,Sat May 23 00:22:36 2015 UTC,"For some reason, that title was hilarious to me but it is an interesting question.  I'm guessing the faceless stormtroopers are going to continue to serve the same purpose as the droids.  I'm also guessing the murder morality will also continue to play out like it did in the movies (and the finale from season 1 when Kanan was ready to kill the Inquisitor...with the red ""clouds"" behind him) but chose to deactivate his sabers."

starwarsrebels,36py2l,LurkLurkleton,6,Thu May 21 17:17:47 2015 UTC,As I understand Ventress was a Dark Jedi and she's canon.
starwarsrebels,36py2l,sweaty_wombat,3,Thu May 21 08:22:19 2015 UTC,But they never say the words Dark Jedi.
starwarsrebels,36py2l,woodbear,7,Thu May 21 17:17:18 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling that the new Imperial Empire is doing everything it can, including altering terminology, to erase the 'Jedi' (both light and dark) from living memory. From what I've read (not a lot) the Empire tended to keep 'Sith' or 'Dark' force users pretty classified. On the other hand you have Darth Vader, a bloody frightening reminder of what was. Also 'dark' implies that there is a 'light'."
starwarsrebels,36py2l,LurkLurkleton,4,Sat May 23 04:38:36 2015 UTC,"Imperial Empire, thats pretty heavy ;)   But yeah, Ventress is mostly talked about as an assassin. Since the title of Sith is reserved for only two, the others are simply force users. I believe you are quite right, and that the title of Dark Jedi is very unnatural.   I think the inquisitors should be considered a bit closer to a soldier, than a dark jedi/assassin. Sure they can do assassinations, but they also command troops and play a official role in the Empire. I really really love the fact that they have introduced force users who are not sith in the Empire. It really helps expand the universe, and also allows for a playfull approach from the audience. Now, people can make fan films and stories where they have a good force user fight a dark one, without it having to be Vader. I really look forward to getting to know the Inquisitor's order. I hope they behave in a cult like way, and that we get to see some kind of academy or something."

starwarsrebels,36kbh2,SunsFenix,8,Wed May 20 01:04:05 2015 UTC,According to a Rebels recon episode it seems he has already lost the Falcon.
starwarsrebels,36kbh2,Ridkidjory,2,Wed May 20 01:09:44 2015 UTC,I guess it makes sense since he needed a ride in his episode and Han solo could have been old enough in the new canon.
starwarsrebels,36kbh2,Cevan,0,Wed May 20 01:20:45 2015 UTC,But when he lost the ship he just lost any ship on his lot. He still had a bunch of other ships that he would be able to use.

starwarsrebels,35ujnu,5aucy,3,Wed May 13 17:29:51 2015 UTC,I'm a last-semester drop-out from a BM in composition degree (so I'm totally a legit though non-practicing composer in my head-canon) and I'm a fan of Williams over Wagner for tone poem expression.  I get super into listening for things like the two-part counterpoint that ends on unisons during the scene in Palpatine's office with Anakin...spend an hour listening for Yoda's theme in Ahsoka's theme...silly shit like that.
starwarsrebels,35ujnu,jeobleo,5,Thu May 14 09:09:56 2015 UTC,I had a friend that was a music composition major and when he got drunk he would re-enact all of Star Wars by singing the music.  Throwing in movie quotes and pointing out places where the music tells the story or ties together themes.  It was magical.

starwarsrebels,35ocak,Combine99100,25,Tue May 12 04:30:45 2015 UTC,"I was worried when this show was announced that Disney would prevent stormtroopers from dying on screen. Nope, instead they kill them for comic effect."
starwarsrebels,35ocak,ethicaldilemna,10,Tue May 12 08:10:44 2015 UTC,"And some of them are pretty brutal deaths too. Sabine shoots several in the face right on screen. It reminds me of when I watched TCW with my roommates. Every time there was extreme violence or sexual content, we'd all quickly say ""kids show."""
starwarsrebels,35ocak,jgrey12,13,Tue May 12 17:07:34 2015 UTC,Did you say it six times really really fast when Savage decapitated that entire boardroom of Black Sun?
starwarsrebels,35ocak,Blackfire853,2,Tue May 12 20:07:39 2015 UTC,I wonder what it sounded like during the helicopter decap.
starwarsrebels,35ocak,Hagathor1,2,Thu May 14 06:48:08 2015 UTC,What? The violence in this show has been pretty tame. The most brutal deaths in the first season with the Inquisitor killing those two imperials wasn't even that violent since they were both killed offscreen.
starwarsrebels,35ocak,CovertCarpet,5,Tue May 12 22:43:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's still kind of mature for a kid's show though. The kids probably don't get it if they aren't paying too close to detail, but for the older audience, i.e. teens and possibly any adults(? - I've heard adults watch these shows, quite frankly I would too regardless of my age), while it's not particularly ""violent"", it definitely gives you an image. I can't help but think... poor Imperials."
starwarsrebels,35ocak,tommmytom,4,Wed May 13 02:52:00 2015 UTC,"Truth be told when I was a kid I never paid violence, sexual content, ECT much attention. I see a character die, I know he's dead but it doesn't destroy my fragile little child brain. as for sexual content. hell I was a stupied kid. I did not get the jokes until I grew up and watch the Alvin and the Chipmunks movie (the one where they fly around the world in a hot air ballon) and Said ""Damnnnn! this is a kids movie!""  TL;DR: Kids brains are not as fragile as most people think Edit: added TLDR"
starwarsrebels,35ocak,Desparoto,4,Wed May 13 03:33:14 2015 UTC,"This exactly.  I watched Dragonball Z at 9-10 years old?  None of the deaths scarred me or anything lol.  Definitely didn't make me violent, just thought it was super entertaining."

starwarsrebels,35j00m,IfinallyhaveaReddit,4,Mon May 11 00:37:06 2015 UTC,I agree. but i would have loved it!
starwarsrebels,35j00m,badass2000,12,Mon May 11 13:03:44 2015 UTC,"I didn't care for TFU's story. So I, personally, won't miss it not being in Rebels. They have a lot to work with as it is, they don't need TFU's content, IMO."
starwarsrebels,35j00m,Binturung,7,Sun May 10 23:34:39 2015 UTC,"Eh, I would honestly like Starkiller as an Inquisitor, but don't make him OP or a Gary Stu or anything like that. Just put him on the same tier as an Inquisitor. I'm thinking like we see the rest of the Inquisitorius, then one of them does something, and he looks a lot like him... leave the rest to the fans. Idk, just brainstorming.   I want to see what Rebels does first, because we have yet to see how it handles the start of the Alliance. THEN I'll ask for some TFU stuff. Prinze Jr.'s been bashing it whenever he can so I don't think there'll be any TFU this season yet lol."
starwarsrebels,35j00m,CommanderVisor,5,Sun May 10 22:34:17 2015 UTC,"One interesting thing I am noticing, and they have been hinting at is the ghost crew (mostly Kanan) do not want to join the rebellion. For example they all want to fight the Empire, but as soon as things get brought up about Hera's connections, the less inclined Kanan gets. I am really excited to see how that plays off next season, when they meet up, with parts of the Rebellion, and demons from Kanan's past (Even angels can seem like demons).  Now, how they can tie in elements from TFU? I don't know. I am glad the route they are taking so far, and am excited to see where the build it all toward."
starwarsrebels,35j00m,Sapitoelgato,1 point,Sun May 10 21:13:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, I just somewhat think it is a good story wasted. While I think there are many flaws with TFU, I thought the last half of it was pretty decent in terms of story (for the first game, following what was canon).  The cross-over could be simple, as in introducing Starkiller and just incorporating him with the current Rebellion movement, secretly the apprentice of Vader, then some of the ""senators"" or leaders (not all of them) are captured, they have to go rescue them, maybe one of the Jedi die since we have a handful of Jedi now (would be emotional and build up tension for Luke being the ""last Jedi"", at least how Yoda thinks of it - Yoda may just think all the other Jedi died), and we go on from there.  Hard-to-read reply, my apologies for that."
starwarsrebels,35j00m,BCM_00,4,Sun May 10 22:14:28 2015 UTC,"As much as I would love to see that happen, I fear it would be difficult to incorporate that story without it simply retelling TFU's story.  The show is supposed to focus on the crew of the ghost, but telling the convoluted story of ""a Secret Sith organizing a rebellion and getting leaders captured only to flip and try and rescue them"" would be too difficult without losing focus on the Kanan et. al.  Please don't misunderstand, I would love for them to tell that story, but I fear it simply wouldn't be in service of the greater show."
starwarsrebels,35j00m,JCreazy,4,Mon May 11 05:40:42 2015 UTC,"It would be really easily for them to bring Starkiller into Rebels especially since Sam Witwer did voices on Clone Wars.  I would like to see him, maybe not have a big part but enough to bring him back into canon."
starwarsrebels,35j00m,omarh14,3,Mon May 11 02:09:46 2015 UTC,Fun fact: Sam Witwer is doing the emperors voice in rebels season 2
starwarsrebels,35j00m,Oct2006,2,Mon May 11 06:22:41 2015 UTC,He also did the emperors voice in TFU.
starwarsrebels,35j00m,BCM_00,7,Mon May 11 14:19:41 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm in the minority, but I loved the story to TFU.  I would love it if they brought Galen Marek into the Rebels universe and recanonized him.  His was a great story of redemption, and it had all the hallmarks of great SW lore:  A Jedi mentor, a romantic interest, a comic relief droid, exciting combat in exotic locales, and above all the battle between light and dark within one's soul.  On top of that, he had a hand in sparking the Rebel Alliance into existence, and it feels like it truly belongs to the story.  I know it bears little weight now, but Lucas himself was consulted regarding the story and personally approved of it.  I would be on board with ignoring the sequel, though.  How would this fit with Rebels, though?  That might be a tough question.  While we don't know the state of the greater rebel movement yet, it seems that Bail Organa is already pretty involved, so trying to have Marek include him in organizing the original rebellion him like he did during the game's story seems out of the question.  Perhaps they could tinker with his timeline a little and have him be involved with another rebel cell or something.  I think seeing him interact with Kanan and Ezra would be a great opportunity.  His past hunting down Jedi could be a point of tension with Kanan, and his struggle between the light and the dark could be a good point of contact with Ezra's own walk with the Force.   An alternative approach could be us seeing him while still in service to Vader.  Maybe he could be dispatched, like the Inquisitor, to handle Kanan.  Personally, though, I would actually be most excited about seeing Rahm Kota, Marek's Jedi master.  In contrast with the contemplative and complacent Jedi bureaucrats from the TCW era, he was battle-hardened and militant, and it would be a lot of fun to see him involved with some Rebel stories.  Side note:  A key thing I feel the need to bring up when talking about TFU, though, is the disconnect between lore and gameplay.  People often criticize the game because it makes Starkiller too powerful.  But that was simply the core game mechanic.  Everyone in that game was supercharged with the Force, including Vader and Luke.  It doesn't mean that the Secret Apprentice was actually lore-breakingly overpowered.  TL;DR:  TFU had a great story and characters, and I want to see them in Rebels.  However, there would be complications with the timeline and new canon."
starwarsrebels,35j00m,RealVoltar,2,Mon May 11 05:33:28 2015 UTC,It's already pretty much going.  They might have a slight Starkiller vibe to Ahsoka's involvement but the most TFU we're going to get is probably Witwer playing Palpatine.
starwarsrebels,35j00m,The_Lotto,2,Tue May 12 06:48:24 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind a few subtle cameos but I don't want the force unleashed characters becoming main characters.
starwarsrebels,35j00m,LionFox,4,Tue May 12 14:47:56 2015 UTC,"Just wondering, what makes you guys not like the TFU story?"
starwarsrebels,35j00m,nightmare901,10,Mon May 11 00:48:16 2015 UTC,"The thoughtful and sober recognition that wish fulfillment and power fantasy (while they can be fun) might not actually be the best thing in terms of having characters and actions that make sense.  (I feel similarly about Revan and his following---though there were far fewer implications for the old ""G"" canon from stuff that happened during the old republic.  And now the canon starts at Phantom Menace, so....)  Also; it seriously defanged Darth Vader.  And I find the notion of ""Schrödinger's Shaak Ti"" to be highly amusing."
starwarsrebels,35j00m,Stained_Panda,1 point,Mon May 11 05:30:16 2015 UTC,"It just doesn't fit with the new Star Wars universe. TFU is like a Tarantino flick in terms of ridiculousness, and Starkiller, while a good character, is moronically overpowered. The only reason he ultimately loses is because the plot demands it. TFU was a fun game, but I'd be fine with shelving the story, right next to the Yuuzhan Vong and Palpatine clones."
starwarsrebels,35j00m,yurklenorf,2,Wed May 20 09:03:31 2015 UTC,"The biggest gripe I have with Rebels at the moment, in terms of story is the prevalence of Jedi in the Rebellion! (ok ok Kanan, Ezra and Ahsoka are not technically Jedi but you get what I mean)  I don't know to me in the original trilogy it felt like any force users apart of the Rebellion were gone, Like noone came up to Luke and was like ""Oh you can use the force yeah this Garen Marek guy could use it as well he could do some pretty cool stuff with it""  It would detract from how special Luke was to the rebellion and the role he will play in the future trilogy.   So no I really don't want a cross-over with The Force Unleashed, they were fun games and I did enjoy the story but personally I did not like how powerful Garen was.  I mean it was cool how you got to watch the creation of the rebellion but I feel that Ahsoka/Bail might be taking over Garens role in the show."
starwarsrebels,35j00m,5aucy,1 point,Mon May 11 16:01:50 2015 UTC,"There were several involved with the Rebellion in Legends as well. At least four or five off the top of my head, not including Luke.

starwarsrebels,35f37e,Whatsheordered,12,Fri Jun 26 05:06:48 2015 UTC,"You still need to read Son of Dathomir then. Yes it is canon; it's the only Dark Horse comic that is still canon, and it's based on unused scripts for Maul's arc in later seasons.  Spoiler alert: Maul got free again and has a few Mandalorians still loyal to him."
starwarsrebels,35f37e,GodotIsWaiting4U,24,Sun May 10 00:34:29 2015 UTC,"Nah, inquisitor's aren't Sith, I don't see that happening."
starwarsrebels,35f37e,JSK23,15,Sat May 9 19:55:46 2015 UTC,"Yup, and adding on to this, the reason why the Inquisitors are never fully trained to be Sith or trained for anything else besides hunting Jedi is so that they don't overthrow the Emperor or anything like that. In addition, even if that wasn't the problem, Maul is on a higher tier than these Jedi hunters. That would make him something like Grand Inquisitor (if that's canon), and personally, I wouldn't trust a loose cannon like Maul to lead one of my personal armies..."
starwarsrebels,35f37e,CommanderVisor,15,Sat May 9 20:12:30 2015 UTC,"Plus, Vader has a tendency to eliminate competition to his status as number two.  Lastly, Palpatine fully rejected Maul in TCW."
starwarsrebels,35f37e,Sapitoelgato,7,Sat May 9 20:14:57 2015 UTC,"I doubt as an Inquisitor, but much more likely as an example as to what the price of failure is. Remember the Inquisitor's last lines during the finale? I think it was more referring to what could be done to him."
starwarsrebels,35f37e,MadMan2012,7,Sat May 9 22:19:01 2015 UTC,"I think if Maul doesnt end up facing Obi Wan in a spinoff film, they should have Maul show up on Rebels and get taken out by Vader."
starwarsrebels,35f37e,metallicabmc,5,Sun May 10 08:15:16 2015 UTC,Or even Ben! The fact that Leia knows to contact him makes me think he may have had some sort of involvement in the Rebellion beyond just sitting in a hut watching some kid grow up. I'd love if Ben Kenobi made some sort of appearance at some point.
starwarsrebels,35f37e,dacalpha,2,Sun May 10 20:48:56 2015 UTC,"Kenobi has no chance of beating Maul anymore. He's an old man now, and Darth Maul was his superior through the entire franchise. He's far past his prime and would be decimated. Ben is definitely staying out of this. And I would think Zabraks have a longer lifespan than humans."
starwarsrebels,35f37e,JarJarBinks590,4,Tue May 26 10:36:10 2015 UTC,I doubt they'll slow maul in any sort of film... It would confuse the hell out of most fans that don't read the comics or watch clone wars/Rebels
starwarsrebels,35f37e,ArcticTerrapin,4,Sun May 10 14:55:26 2015 UTC,"Why not? Theres not much explanation needed really. They see his robot legs, and he throws out some kind of line that says he's survived on hatred or something. That's all they really need...that's all they did to explain it on Clone Wars anyways.  I hate this idea that people are too stupid to understand something unless it's shown in the movie or explained to them. It cheapens the whole idea of everything in Star Wars being canon now."
starwarsrebels,35f37e,metallicabmc,8,Sun May 10 19:56:57 2015 UTC,Darth Maul escaped  Sidious in the comics which are now canon. Nor would he ever ally with Sidious again. He's probably Anti-Empire at this point after the horror Sidious put him through. He'd be a fool to become part of the Empire.
starwarsrebels,35f37e,ShadowEye37,2,Sat May 9 21:25:37 2015 UTC,"They can't really bring in Darth Maul in a way that works. He is on a much higher level than any of the Inquisitors, so that would be a serious nerf and insult to him. Palpatine already rejected taking him back, and he would likely have an Anti-Empire mindset, and perhaps set out on a personal revenge quest. He and the Death Watch would be a third faction at best. But at the same time there's no way he'd work with the Rebels. If he met Kanan, Ezra or Ahsoka, a duel would be inevitable, and I don't see any way for any of them to beat Maul."

No one on board knew the whole thing would explode. If Tarkin knew, he would have ordered the evacuation."
starwarsrebels,35d8xz,NextArtemis,3,Sat May 9 06:01:43 2015 UTC,Plus if they evacuated they'd be outside of what was supposed to be the most indestructible structure in the galaxy. He probably believed it was the safest place to be
starwarsrebels,35d8xz,raerdor,8,Sun May 10 04:07:25 2015 UTC,"I recognized it as a nod.  Tarkin strikes me as a man willing to take calculated risks.

starwarsrebels,35d8xz,RealVoltar,3,Sat May 9 14:27:22 2015 UTC,"True.  Another weird thing is that in the Radio Drama (which is not officially canon, of course) he originally does seriously consider evacuating during the rebel attack but then somebody suggests that he might ""lose face"" if he ran and then, when asked again, puts on his bravado and refuses to leave."
starwarsrebels,35d8xz,RealVoltar,2,Sat May 9 14:33:35 2015 UTC,I think the whole season parallels E4. It does start with Organa putting a disc in R2 and ends with the Rebel Alliance (as it is) blowing up Tarkin's SD.  Be prepared for E5 references next season (and E2 as well but that's not explicit)..

Like if Kanan met Ahsoka or Bail at some point beforehand, that would be an epic oversight, for sure.  First, Billaba's last words to Kanan can easily be interpreted as Kanan recalling her last meaningful thing said to him while being interrogated by the inquisitor, and thus the disparity.  The homeworld thing is a little bad, I admit, but he's not technically wrong... he did go straight from Coruscant to the Jedi Temple, haha.  Unless they're referring to another temple in another system?  I dunno, like I said, I haven't read #2 yet.  Re Obi-Wan's message, I'm not sure I understand what happened between the novel, the comic, and the tv show -- doesn't Obi-Wan send only the one message in the holocron, or are there multiples now?  Varying lengths of the message can almost be excused considering the different mediums.  A easy explanation could be that the show edited out part of the message, no?"

starwarsrebels,353tjb,sageleader,5,Thu May 7 16:49:10 2015 UTC,"I agree. This has been cross-posted to a couple of different Star Wars subs, and most reactions are in line with yours (and mine). I'm a little surprised you've been downvoted like this, honestly. None of these are continuity errors. They're interpretations. That's going to happen. Highlighting these innocuous details in a negative light is either (1) missing the point of the nature of a self-contained narrative within a larger franchise, or (2) antagonistic toward the new canon and latching on to whatever OP can find."
starwarsrebels,353tjb,CommanderVisor,4,Fri May 8 09:23:33 2015 UTC,Honestly you should tweet this post to @holocronkeeper and see what Leeland Chee has to say. He just might respond.
starwarsrebels,353tjb,TheDidact118,5,Thu May 7 11:38:25 2015 UTC,"The last word one is stupid, unless she ends up sending him a message or he has a dream or something and mixes it up.  Whatever, I doubt that these things will pop up again, because Kanan probably won't go to his homeworld (I'm guessing that it meant that they took him when he was young and he's grown up on Coruscant, so it's considered his homeworld?) and the message won't change in the show so that non-comic readers don't get confused.  On a side note, there was a magazine comic about Kallus and an old academy rival. Kallus explains that he and his rival arrived on Coruscant at about the same time, even though the guide books say that Kallus's homeworld is Coruscant. The comics in the magazines are apparently checked by the Story Group too, even though the stories aren't likely to be talked about in the actual show. They need to step up their game unless Filoni and co. are up to something.  EDIT: nvm about the message thing, because apparently she dies before his eyes, but it might be something he sees in his dreams or whatever."

Star Wars: Kanan - The Last Padawan #2     arms down by his side. This is Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. I regret to report that both our Jedi Order and the Republic have Fallen with the Dark Shadow of the Empire Rising to take their place.

Avoid Detection Be secret... We will each be challenged: Our trust, our faith, our friendships. But we must persevere, and in time I believe A NEW HOPe will emerge. May the Force be with you... always.    Three messages, only two that are really different. The ""avoid Coruscant"" that was included int he comic, but not the show I think is just an editing thing. As for the two distinct messages who know. We do not know the context of the message from A New Dawn. It could have been later. The Empire found out about the ""changed"" message and altered it again, so Obi sent out a different message that was hi-jacked on the Holonet. Who knows. I think you are over analyzing this.   Honestly, as for the homeworld, maybe Coruscant is Kanan's homeworld as that is where his new identity is formed, but Caleb's homeworld is somewhere else.   Also, if you really want answers you could tweet the keeper of the Holocron, Leland Chee, and see what he has to say."
starwarsrebels,353tjb,CommanderVisor,0,Thu May 7 14:36:57 2015 UTC,"So Caleb will go back to Coruscant, even though Obi-Wan's message blatantly said that there's nothing more for them there and that you'll be screwed? I'm sorry, but lol, since the speech came right before you said that.  If anything, it probably just means he grew up there. I doubt that Kanan cares about his birth world anymore anyway, like a ton of other Jedi like Ahsoka."

starwarsrebels,353tjb,Mackadal,2,Thu May 7 16:27:34 2015 UTC,"Billaba's Last Words: Now, you're asking questions on someone who has been (1) undergoing torture for days if not weeks, (2) very likely been denied sleep, and (3) also likely denied food. Do you expect such person would be able to recall every single words of a particularly traumatic event in his life?  No, he would recall only the most significant events. And, in Kanan's mind, it's Depa's instruction for him to ""run"", which sent him down a survivor's guilt trip for years.  Obi-Wan's message: It can be argued that the version in A New Dawn would be delivered to devices incapable of delivering a holoimage. So, it is possible that Obi-Wan sent the longer, holoimage one, then thought, ""Ahhh, crap! Those without devices capable of delivering holoimages will not be able to receive my message!"" Then proceeded to send the text-only shorter version.  Kanan's homeworld: That's an unfortunate slip, but really trivial. Should be ""straight from my home to the Jedi Temple."" It will be fixed in the next imprint :-)  All in all, nothing fatal. Not enough to get riled over anything."
starwarsrebels,353tjb,RichieAppel,2,Wed May 13 02:53:23 2015 UTC,"The error that bothers me is the timing of the beacon.  Kanan/Caleb says that he spends ""days"" on Kaller after the clones' initial betrayal. He then sleeps for ""a full rotation"" on Kasmir's ship. Then he steals the ship and travels from Kaller, ""deep in the Outer Rim"" to Coruscant. That should take at least several hours, probably closer to a full day. It's only minutes away from Coruscant that the beacon changes to the repelling warning.  For this to mesh with what we see in Revenge of the Sith, several days would have had to have passed between Palpatine's initial order to Commander Cody and his address to the Senate, the point at which Obi-Wan changes the beacon. Not only does it seem highly unlikely that Palpatine would wait so long before unveiling the Empire or that it took days for Anakin to finish at the Temple and head to Mustafar, a civilian in the comic mentions the Jedi ""revolution"", ony shortly after Caleb's escape from the clones. A civilian in the Outer RIm couldn't have known about that before Palpatine's speech to the Senate.  By that logic, several days pass between Palpatine's speech to the Senate and the very next scene where Obi-Wan resets the beacon. During which Anakin must have gotten seriously lost on his way to Mustafar thus allowing him to arrive only minutes before Padme and Obi-Wan in order for the timeline of Kanan to make any sense."

starwarsrebels,353tjb,triarii3,-1,Fri May 8 02:17:06 2015 UTC,"Huh? The comic takes place before that, and it takes place while he's a KID. Kanan's having his flashback while on the Ghost and he's over his drinking problems by then, and I don't see why Kanan would lie if he's actually telling this to someone and you don't easily forget experiences like Order 66... maybe certain parts, but one would probably remember their parent/guardian's last words to them..."
starwarsrebels,353tjb,JCreazy,1 point,Fri May 8 05:45:13 2015 UTC,"I don't view the entire comic as a flashback.  The reason for this is because it is a -very- detailed and -very- long flashback to have while you're sitting in the cockpit of the Ghost.  Now, if the comic popped between the story of the past and the story on the Ghost, then sure I'd treat it as a flashback.  If it were purely a flashback it'd end with the traumatic events of what happened on the planet, given that that is the trigger of the ""flashback"" and the really the scope of its relevancy (if the story were about the ""present"" time mission, and not just a telling of Kanan's post-Order 66 history)."
starwarsrebels,353tjb,CheezeCaek2,4,Sat May 9 08:18:11 2015 UTC,"I think his birth world is different from his homework. I was born in one city but grew up in a nearby town. That never bothered me.   The last words thing stuck out to me, but obviously it's not a big deal. Either kanan remembers the last meaningful thing she said to him or he remembers it wrong because it was so intense. He probably wasn't even listening as he sprinted away.  The message thing really bothered me though. I hope they explain it."

It would be neat if he either died a martyr for the rebel cause, or, was about to rat the heroes out, forcing them to kill him. Jar Jar's pretty deferential to authority; I wouldn't be surprised if he had embraced the Empire without knowing the facts. Then we'd see one of the protagonists dealing with the guilt of killing someone who was a fool and a threat, but who earnestly thought he was doing the right thing.  Also, people need to stop hating on Jar Jar for the whole giving the Chancellor executive power thing (they can hate him for other reasons).

starwarsrebels,34tzdd,CommanderVisor,7,Mon May 4 16:32:55 2015 UTC,Yes. You should watch clone wars.
starwarsrebels,34tzdd,BurningBushJr,3,Mon May 4 16:41:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I recommend TCW to anyone. It's my favorite TV show ever.... :)"

starwarsrebels,34tzdd,st3ph3nk1ng69,2,Wed May 6 20:15:45 2015 UTC,I'm not sure... I just really liked TCW. I personally liked Seeing Ahsoka and her journey and stuff :)

starwarsrebels,34tzdd,platinumrug,7,Fri May 15 16:17:27 2015 UTC,"I would look into an abridged viewing to the Clone Wars.  But the whole thing is worth watching.  Oddly enough, my least favorite arc in the entire series (the 4 episode droid arc) might have become relevant...  There are lists out there, but they aren't exactly organized around what is relevant to Rebels.  And my guess is that once we know a bit more about one of the main cast, other material (and some of my favorite material in the show) will become quite relevant.  And the season 2 trailer has also made some other stuff relevant..  That said, this list is based on relevance for the moment.  People who have seen both shows will probably have some idea of what I am trying to ""extract"" from these episodes.  I've taken a minimalist approach to the Mandalore plot threads because of all that it ties into.  33 Episodes:  Domino Squad 3.01 – Clone Cadets 1.05 – Rookies  Holocron Heist 2.01 – Holocron Heist 2.02 – Cargo of Doom 2.03 – Children of the Force  ""Second Battle of Geonosis"":  2.05 – Landing at Point Rain 2.06 – Weapons Factory 2.07 – Legacy of Terror 2.08 – Brain Invaders  {2.10 – The Deserter}   2.12 – The Mandalore Plot  3.02 – ARC Troopers  3.10 – Heroes on Both Side  The ""Citadel"" Trilogy: 3.18 – The Citadel 3.19 – Counter Attack 3.20 – Citadel Rescue  The ""Umbara"" Arc: 4.07 – Darkness On Umbara 4.08 – The General 4.09 – Plan of Dissent 4.10 – Carnage of Krell  4.14 – A Friend In Need  The ""Onderon"" Arc: 5.02 – A War on Two Fronts 5.03 – Front Runners 5.04 – The Soft War 5.05 – Tipping Points  ""Sabotage"": 5.17 – Sabotage 5.18 – The Jedi Who Knew Too Much 5.19 – To Catch a Jedi 5.20 – The Wrong Jedi  ""Order 66"" Arc: 6.01 – The Unknown 6.02 – Conspiracy 6.03 – Fugitive 6.04 – Orders  ""Orders"" is a very nice place to end if you started back with ""Clone Cadets.""  TCW never really got a proper ending: 5.20 was the broadcast ending while the last 4 episodes on Netflix also offer an ending of sorts."
starwarsrebels,34tzdd,LionFox,5,Mon May 4 20:16:02 2015 UTC,The problem with these lists is that it's like a cliff notes for dummies version which doesn't allow the viewer to create an emotional connection to the characters. The end result is that anyone watching rebels will understand the gist of certain things and why they are relevant but will be denied the emotional rewards that made certain scenes in rebels so great.
starwarsrebels,34tzdd,BurningBushJr,5,Tue May 5 02:09:59 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree that these lists are limited compared to watching the whole thing (and rewatching your favorite arcs), but I had in mind creating an emotional connection with certain characters as I wrote it.  The sentiment here is ""if you really can't watch the whole thing, with this goal in mind, watch these.""  In TCW, even the smallest moments can pay off.  The Jedi Orders small compromises in The Zillow Beast episodes (which were never continued because Zillo beasts eat money), for example, becomes a small step to far larger compromises that more overtly betray their values."
starwarsrebels,34tzdd,LionFox,2,Tue May 5 03:16:38 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I must say in that regard,  it is a spectacular list. I just love clone wars so much so I always try to convince people to watch the whole thing.  :)"
starwarsrebels,34tzdd,BurningBushJr,2,Tue May 5 03:52:40 2015 UTC,"There are also the unfinished renders, the ""Crystal Crisis on Utapau"" arc and ""Bad Batch"" arc on the Star Wars website."
starwarsrebels,34tzdd,CommanderVisor,2,Mon May 4 22:54:29 2015 UTC,"True, but I wanted to give it something of an ending.  Bad Batch was fairly self-contained, IMO, even though I did include the Citadel.  Crystal Crisis, however, has two very nice scenes that deal with the fallout of the ""Sabotage"" arc and Anakin's reaction to it, but it's a pretty long arc to get just that.  I suppose there are the kyber crystals but, it is not the most necessary of things.  I was trying to keep it short when I could.  I only included ""The Mandalore Plot"" and ""Heroes on Both Sides"" because they were needed for ""A Friend in Need,"" which not only has that move but is useful to the Onderon Arc, which is more directly relevant to Rebels."
starwarsrebels,34tzdd,LionFox,7,Mon May 4 23:57:28 2015 UTC,"You can go in blind, but if you have seen TCW, you will notice little things."
starwarsrebels,34tzdd,Sapitoelgato,18,Mon May 4 15:50:29 2015 UTC,"If by ""little things"" you mean pivotal plot elements, then yes."
starwarsrebels,34tzdd,kipperson,2,Mon May 4 16:02:52 2015 UTC,"Like others said, watch TCW.   I personally had difficulties with TCW initially, but it is worth it. Just continue watching until the characters become likeable who were annoying initially.  I liked Rebels from the start, but liked the characters grew on me once I read the book and during the second half of the show I loved it. So I so recommend reading the book as it adds some more depth to the characters."
starwarsrebels,34tzdd,jlo80,3,Mon May 4 22:30:01 2015 UTC,"I didn't think there was a place in my heart to love another Jedi, but I was wrong. Familirize yourself with the female Padawan from TWC who has been the face of obsession for this sub."
starwarsrebels,34tzdd,teachrhomb,5,Mon May 4 17:22:34 2015 UTC,"You can watch the majority of it without any prior knowledge, but the Season Finale has a much bigger impact on you if you've watch the Clone Wars. Minor details become more apparent as well. Season 2 will bear a lot more links to the Clone Wars though. All I'll say is that during the Clone Wars, Anakin took an an apprentice named Ahsoka Tano, who goes with him on tons of missions and bonds with him pretty well. I won't say how it links into Rebels though, you figure that out."
starwarsrebels,34tzdd,JarJarBinks590,1 point,Mon May 4 17:25:22 2015 UTC,"EDIT: Well, it looks like I'm watching The Clone Wars first. Plus my buddy's been bugging me to watch it for the past 2 years. Thankfully its all on Netflix.   What order do you plan on watching it?"
starwarsrebels,34tzdd,SKLKNKR,1 point,Tue May 5 04:13:12 2015 UTC,"All 6 seasons, then Rebels."
starwarsrebels,34tzdd,SKLKNKR,2,Tue May 5 10:36:38 2015 UTC,"The Clone Wars actually aired out of chronological order.  I recommend watching it in chornological order as release order can be quite confusing.  The chornological order isn't perfect though, as it chops up some character development."
starwarsrebels,34tzdd,SKLKNKR,2,Tue May 5 15:44:17 2015 UTC,So this is pretty much the way it was meant to be watched I guess?
starwarsrebels,34tzdd,general_nuisance,2,Tue May 5 16:48:29 2015 UTC,Which way?
starwarsrebels,34o2ho,diamondcreeper,11,Sat May 2 23:02:52 2015 UTC,"My bet would be she was part of a Death Watch cell that engaged in slaving, or at least transporting prisoners or slaves there.   Secondary theory, a friend or family member are imprisoned there."
starwarsrebels,34o2ho,MadMan2012,8,Sun May 3 14:04:30 2015 UTC,"In the Sabine's Rebel Sketchbook, she talks about her armor and mentions how the helmet is like the ones Bo-Katan's squad in Death Watch wore. If she was angry at the group, I doubt she would be speaking fondly of them or wearing anything that could let her be associated with them."
starwarsrebels,34o2ho,Lanuria,5,Sun May 3 15:32:37 2015 UTC,Really love how some Mando'a is getting recognized through Sabine
starwarsrebels,34o2ho,Skyskinner,3,Mon May 4 01:19:02 2015 UTC,"If she is Mandalorian, that would make it a cultural armor. To be honest, I figured Mandalore would have left their pacifism that Satine(very close name) was a champion of. That maybe many other Mandalorians started other groups after Satine was removed from power and Death Watch took power. With pacifism no longer being mainstream, I could see a number of groups popping up using Mandalorian armor. Sabine could have been affiliated with one of those groups."
starwarsrebels,34o2ho,MadMan2012,6,Mon May 4 17:17:09 2015 UTC,Maybe Bo-Katan's death watch was the faction that refused to recognize Maul's rule.
starwarsrebels,34o2ho,RogueLieutenant,9,Sun May 3 16:35:22 2015 UTC,"They were, and Dave said there was a story arc planned in which Ashoka helped Bo take over Mandalore.  I don't even know if I should spoiler tag this or not, because that might very well be something introduced."
starwarsrebels,34o2ho,SKLKNKR,3,Sun May 3 16:46:13 2015 UTC,Ahsoka was gunna go up against Maul? Or was maul perhaps just hiding after the events of Son of Dathomir?
starwarsrebels,34o2ho,RogueLieutenant,7,Sun May 3 17:39:08 2015 UTC,"That wasn't said at all.  I have no idea what the plan was, and I really wish I did.  All of the untold Clone Wars episodes sound awesome, hopefully Rebels touches on a few and they get the rest out in some form."
starwarsrebels,34o2ho,SKLKNKR,3,Sun May 3 18:44:44 2015 UTC,"It also gets mentioned somewhere (profile or book, idr) that she ""inherited"" the helmet and did not decorate it, because it was already like that when she got it."
starwarsrebels,34o2ho,CommanderVisor,2,Sun May 3 18:55:02 2015 UTC,"I can't wait to go into her backstory.  She is the least developed character in that sense right now, and I can't wait to see what happens (or rather, ""happened"")."
starwarsrebels,34o2ho,SKLKNKR,1 point,Sun May 3 19:18:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, some of these stories could be more than touched on in Rebels and still be fine.  Depending on the level of work put in already and the ease to link it into Rebels they could just finish the episodes and put it within the framework of Ahsoka telling the story."
starwarsrebels,34o2ho,HalcyonWind,5,Sat May 9 08:16:16 2015 UTC,"The Han Solo part is a bit of a jump to conclusions. It might also just be an ""oh crap"" reaction like everyone else's. Nice find, though"
starwarsrebels,34o2ho,CommanderVisor,1 point,Sun May 3 00:34:59 2015 UTC,"IDK about that, in the EU Han had hooked up with the rebellion before ANH. It didn't go well with the rebels screwing over the smuggler group that they had hired. It was pointed as what Lando was PO'ed about when he's messing with Solo at the landing pad on Bespin during ESB."
starwarsrebels,34nfuh,durtycurdy,24,Sat May 2 19:34:24 2015 UTC,Lasats don't pull arms out of their sockets when they lose. Wookiees have been known to do that.

starwarsrebels,34nfuh,HossmanWC,17,Tue Jun 2 15:15:25 2015 UTC,*Wookiee
starwarsrebels,34nfuh,Sapitoelgato,13,Sat May 2 19:47:42 2015 UTC,I think Wookiees are still the generally stronger species. Lasats may be more agile though. I think it really comes down the the individuals in the fight though.
starwarsrebels,34nfuh,The_Lightkeeper,7,Sat May 2 20:14:12 2015 UTC,Well the Empire decided to wipe out the Lasat but enslave the Wookiees. Not sure what conclusions could be drawn from that but it's worth mentioning.
starwarsrebels,34nfuh,RogueLieutenant,9,Sun May 3 16:37:49 2015 UTC,"Possibly because Lasats speak basic and therefore come across as more intelligent or closer to humans?  Chewie is a giant dog/mechanic/pilot. Zeb is a member of the team and a friend.  I'm not trying to downplay Chewbacca, but could you see Kanan or Ezra scratching Zeb behind the ear like Luke did to Chewie on Hoth?"
starwarsrebels,34nfuh,aatencio91,3,Mon May 4 06:24:33 2015 UTC,"I think Chewie would win.  I may be a bit biased but the only time we've seen Zeb in a straight fight he spoiler.  I very well could change my answer after season 2, but we will have to wait and see."
starwarsrebels,34nfuh,SKLKNKR,2,Sat May 2 20:15:28 2015 UTC,"When have we seen Chewie in a fight at the same calibre as the one Zeb was in? IIRC, he hasn't been in anything that serious in canon."
starwarsrebels,34nfuh,returningtheday,3,Sat May 2 22:57:28 2015 UTC,"No where in the new canon.  Honestly though, I really don't know which species is more powerful."
starwarsrebels,34nfuh,SKLKNKR,2,Sat May 2 23:09:31 2015 UTC,"That wasn't a straight fight.  If it was a straight fight, then like how The_Lightkeeper said, Lasats are prob more agile and different individuals in the same species have a different amount of strength."
starwarsrebels,34nfuh,CommanderVisor,3,Sun May 3 00:40:30 2015 UTC,"We don't know much about Lasats. We've only seen Zeb, and he may be atypical.  The really big Wookiees seem to be much bigger than Zeb."
starwarsrebels,34nfuh,Lurkndog,3,Sun May 3 12:33:53 2015 UTC,There was a Lasat in an old west end games RPG named Puggles.
starwarsrebels,34nfuh,RogueLieutenant,1 point,Sun May 3 16:37:03 2015 UTC,"In Rise of the Rebels:   Given the similarities in their size and strength, Zeb could identify with Wookiees. He felt compassion for those brawny tree-dwellers of Kashyyyk... But he didn't think any comparison did his own species justice. Because he knew he was stronger than any Wookiee.   (boldfaced part mine)  Make of that as you will."
starwarsrebels,34nfuh,pepoluan,1 point,Wed May 13 03:04:42 2015 UTC,"Also remember that Wookies can live to be over 400 years old. I don't have any info regarding Lasat lifespan, but a much longer lifespan leads to more experience and wisdom. An example, Yoda is."

starwarsrebels,34aszl,CommanderVisor,3,Thu Apr 30 03:05:42 2015 UTC,"This. It was in production for quite some time, so I've heard."
starwarsrebels,34aszl,Sapitoelgato,2,Thu Apr 30 03:23:01 2015 UTC,Animation took the guy over 4 years to complete.
starwarsrebels,34aszl,SKLKNKR,2,Thu Apr 30 15:00:27 2015 UTC,It won't be.
starwarsrebels,34aszl,Redditastrophe,-1,Wed Apr 29 20:53:44 2015 UTC,"At Celebration, Dave Filoni said it wasn't canon, I thought."
starwarsrebels,34aszl,CommanderVisor,8,Wed Apr 29 23:27:27 2015 UTC,It is canon.
starwarsrebels,34aszl,BCM_00,3,Wed Apr 29 23:34:29 2015 UTC,"At the panel following this arc's debut, Dave gave a very guarded answer on the subject.  He is fine calling it canon, but he didn't quite commit to it.  Source"
starwarsrebels,34aszl,Sapitoelgato,5,Thu Apr 30 09:48:09 2015 UTC,"This is also before it officially released on the Star Wars website, and all the characters are now in the canon databank. If you watch the three questions asked about 3 particular clones all of them had very telling expressions on their faces, before they dodged each question."

starwarsrebels,34aszl,SKLKNKR,7,Thu Apr 30 14:53:26 2015 UTC,That panel was hilarious.  What happened to Rex? We'll have to wait and see.  What about the Wolfpack and Wolffe?  We'll see.  Gregor? We'll see.

starwarsrebels,34aszl,CommanderVisor,3,Wed Apr 29 23:33:56 2015 UTC,Bad Batch is also a Rex-centric episode arc and this spoiler is actually part of the reason why this arc was much anticipated

(Also I'd like to know more about Kallus's past, because his homeworld is apparently Coruscant.) Arkanis (For Zare) Alderaan (If they're gonna make the crew closer to the high command than we thought) Mon Cala (Where and how are they gonna get the swimsuits, is different matter) Orto Plutonia/Pantora (I liked Chairman Papanoida and Senator Chuchi tbh and I can see them being pro-Rebels) Dantooine (That rebel base) Hoth (same thing as above) Mustafar (or not, idc. They should go back in Season 3 unless something happens in Season 2 that has them go back again tbh.)   No planets like Mortis (not that there's anything there anymore...), Dagobah, Korriban, etc. pls, that stuff wouldn't fit with Kanan, Ezra, and maybe not Ahsoka anymore tbh. Also, maybe no Tatooine, because I don't want them that close to Obi-Wan and Luke. There's nothing for them on some planets like Geonosis and Kamino, so yeah, no.  EDIT: Orto Plutonia was where those tribal aliens came from, while its moon Pantora was where PAPANOIDA and CHUCHI came from."
starwarsrebels,34cecz,CommanderVisor,11,Thu Apr 30 01:04:44 2015 UTC,They do have to wrap up Mandalore sooner or later anyway.
starwarsrebels,34cecz,Darth_Kyofu,7,Thu Apr 30 03:57:28 2015 UTC,There's nothing for them on some planets like Geonosis   Except the construction of the Death Star.
starwarsrebels,34cecz,Morbuzaan,3,Thu Apr 30 07:24:11 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I forgot about that lol.. but if they went on the planet itself, then they would have to deal with those Geonosians and the worms and stuff IIRC."
starwarsrebels,34cecz,CommanderVisor,3,Thu Apr 30 14:51:16 2015 UTC,"No spoilers, but the Geonosian thing us wrapped up very nicely in the new Vader comics."

I didn't use any refs at the time, so yes? That's not a lot of planets imo.  EDIT: Well, I screwed up the planet where Papanoida and Chuchi came from and I didn't realize it until I was browsing through TV Tropes."
starwarsrebels,34cecz,CommanderVisor,11,Thu Apr 30 01:44:44 2015 UTC,Corellia and Dantooine.
starwarsrebels,34cecz,ReboZooty,4,Thu Apr 30 02:03:49 2015 UTC,Yes on Corellia.  Has it ever been shown in the films or clone wars?  My only idea of what it looks like comes from playing Rogue squadron.
starwarsrebels,34cecz,CommanderVisor,4,Thu Apr 30 01:15:14 2015 UTC,"Nope, I don't think so. It's always been talked about, but never seen in canon."
starwarsrebels,34cecz,Nihillo,6,Thu Apr 30 01:17:36 2015 UTC,"We will probably see Mandalore, given that a Mandalorian is on the crew and she still has a lot of character development to go through.  I would like to see Nar Shaddaa, it would provide some nice vistas and it would be appropriate for them, since it's Hutt space and a place for scoundrels to hide.  And here's a bold one: Jakku."
starwarsrebels,34cecz,blusuedetb,3,Thu Apr 30 01:28:16 2015 UTC,is Nar Shaddaa canon again? I loved that planet! Shame we haven't seen it on screen yet.
starwarsrebels,34cecz,Nihillo,1 point,Thu Apr 30 07:22:20 2015 UTC,"I suppose it is, I mean, did they un-canonize every planet when they reset the canon?"
starwarsrebels,34cecz,blusuedetb,2,Fri May 1 03:46:12 2015 UTC,"I think so, unless it was in The Clone Wars, Rebels, the movies or any of the new books/comics that have come out since."
starwarsrebels,34cecz,Nihillo,2,Fri May 1 05:55:49 2015 UTC,"Well, Nal Hutta was in The Clone Wars, I think they show Nar Shadda in the background."
starwarsrebels,34cecz,Galle_,3,Fri May 1 06:19:46 2015 UTC,"Nar Shaddaa never appeared in The Clone Wars, but it's apparently been mentioned in the Canon comics."
starwarsrebels,34cecz,Shezarrine,4,Fri May 1 07:00:50 2015 UTC,"Definitely Mandalore.  Given that Sabine wears a modified Nite Owl helmet and mentions them and Bo-Katan in her (canon) sketchbook, I'm quite curious about its current state"
starwarsrebels,34cecz,laser-fox,2,Sun May 3 00:40:59 2015 UTC,"If I had to choose 1, it would be Corellia. Despite it being so important in the lore, there has only been 1 visual representation of it, in KOTOR"
starwarsrebels,34cecz,blusuedetb,4,Sat May 2 01:55:51 2015 UTC,"That was a non-canon appearance, unfortunately. It was also in Star Wars Galaxies, the mmo. I would love to see what they would do with it in Rebels."
starwarsrebels,34cecz,RogueLieutenant,2,Thu Apr 30 18:56:56 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see Sullust (We just saw it in Leia #3 from Marvel)  Maybe Onderon Mandalore  Planets I don't want to see: Hoth. I love Hoth, but c'mon. The Empire Strikes Back was probably the first time more than 20 people have been on that planet in centuries."

If we do see it, I would rather be it with a scene involving Vader or Tarkin but I definitely do not think the Ghost Crew should go there. Hell, the Rebel Alliance stayed on remote planets even in their prime, going to those planets at its very beginning would not make sense.  To answer OP's question, I want to see Dantooine. Maybe we can see that rebel base that's eventually ""abandoned for quite some time."""

starwarsrebels,34cecz,chewee123,3,Fri May 1 06:33:53 2015 UTC,Yavin IV (no particular reason) and Tattooine (maybe have a teenage Luke Skywalker or old Obi Wan make a cameo). Or even have them go to Kashyyyk and have the Ghost crew meet Chewie and other Wookies. They could even give Ashoka and Chewie a reunion.
starwarsrebels,34cecz,Darth_Kyofu,6,Sun May 3 16:38:27 2015 UTC,"I think Luke would be far too much fan service. Obi-Wan would be nice, but he talks in ANH as if he hadn't done anything the last few years. What I would like to see, though (and they missed a chance to do that on the debut film), is reincorporating the story of how Han met Chewie by saving him while he worked for the Empire."
starwarsrebels,34cecz,chewee123,2,Thu Apr 30 02:30:19 2015 UTC,Maybe Han Solo could pull a Lando and hitch a ride with them and they some how get to Kashyyyk.
starwarsrebels,34cecz,chewee123,2,Thu Apr 30 03:55:30 2015 UTC,"Yavin IV, to show how it became an important base?  I'd like to see Ahsoka ""need help from an old friend,"" and bring our heroes to see Obi-Wan on Tattooine."
starwarsrebels,34cecz,darklordoftech,2,Thu Apr 30 11:43:19 2015 UTC,Those are both good ideas.
starwarsrebels,346hbo,mintberrycrunch92,13,Tue Apr 28 18:07:20 2015 UTC,"No life support is no longer canon, so I guess we can assume TIE's have life support systems."
starwarsrebels,346hbo,SKLKNKR,9,Tue Apr 28 18:11:04 2015 UTC,This or at least a limited time life support system.
starwarsrebels,346hbo,Sapitoelgato,4,Tue Apr 28 18:15:39 2015 UTC,I believe in Tarkin it is mentioned that they have no life support.
starwarsrebels,346hbo,SKLKNKR,2,Tue Apr 28 20:02:47 2015 UTC,Then someone needs to edit the Wookieepedia page.
starwarsrebels,346hbo,RealVoltar,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:14:36 2015 UTC,I get the feeling their to-do list has gotten pretty long in the last year.
starwarsrebels,346hbo,cebt,2,Thu Apr 30 10:05:19 2015 UTC,Wait.. It WAS canon? We see tie fighters in Space in episode 4 for crying out loud  edit  Oh right... They wear masks in that..
starwarsrebels,346hbo,Sheikah_Benji,23,Tue Apr 28 18:38:39 2015 UTC,"i assume they were able to breath the air that was inside the TIE with them. Since they were making a short trip, it was probably enough for them."
starwarsrebels,346hbo,BlueSmoke95,9,Tue Apr 28 19:45:29 2015 UTC,Id have to say this is probably the most logical answer.
starwarsrebels,346hbo,KISSOLOGY,7,Tue Apr 28 20:04:20 2015 UTC,The bigger question is this: TIE fighters are for too small for any kind of artificial gravity generator.  How were they all standing upright in a single-person fighter?
starwarsrebels,346hbo,CJdaELF,5,Tue Apr 28 22:03:49 2015 UTC,Because TV
starwarsrebels,346hbo,BurningBushJr,2,Wed Apr 29 10:46:25 2015 UTC,Oh geez i didnt even think about this!
starwarsrebels,346hbo,memphislynx,4,Tue Apr 28 23:58:16 2015 UTC,Gravity felt from the planet below them maybe. It would have a pretty significant effect
starwarsrebels,346hbo,ladaron,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:00:02 2015 UTC,Really? You think so?
starwarsrebels,346hbo,CommanderVisor,5,Wed Apr 29 16:16:05 2015 UTC,"There is a popular misconception that distance from Earth allows astronauts to float during missions or on the ISS. Gravity is actually almost as strong as on Earth's surface, but, since they are in a stable orbital pattern, the astronauts are in a constant state of free fall. Look at point 2 here.   Realistically, this still wouldn't explain them being able to stand up in the TIE fighter unless it is moving at a constant speed and direction (no acceleration) tangental to the planet."
starwarsrebels,346hbo,triarii3,4,Thu Apr 30 00:08:38 2015 UTC,I'm going to guess that it was modified by Sabine and/or Ezra. There was an article recently about how the painted TIE was suppose to be a secret project of those two that was shown throughout the seasons.
starwarsrebels,346hbo,Skunkman76,2,Wed Apr 29 03:01:10 2015 UTC,Really? Do you have the link?
starwarsrebels,346hbo,pepoluan,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:16:06 2015 UTC,Yes I saw this too. They secretly has this TIE for a while now. They could have added life support.
starwarsrebels,343yv6,SKLKNKR,7,Tue Apr 28 02:50:25 2015 UTC,"The B-wing was in Heir to the jedi as well so apparently they moved up production on it and the A-wing from being around the time of endor to being before Rebels. Also Admiral Ackbar didn't have anything to do with creating it this time from what i can tell, instead it was made by a verpine corporation and even some pirates have gotten a hold of it to use. so now the B-wing has been turned form a rebel designed ship into just another standard ship in the universe. So i am going to say she will need it for a real task since its apparently being sold on the market. Also i love how much of the old EU cannon stuff was stuffed into Tarkin and Heir."
starwarsrebels,343yv6,roninjedi,2,Tue Apr 28 06:11:06 2015 UTC,So i am going to say she will need it for a real task since its apparently being sold on the market   Any guess on what that might be?
starwarsrebels,343yv6,roninjedi,3,Tue Apr 28 06:16:44 2015 UTC,Well in the long preview we saw a bunch of rebel ships being blown skyhigh so maybe there is an Immobilizer 418 cruiser or a Detainer CC-2200 interdictor cruiser (if either are still canon) in the system pulling rebel ships out so the fleet can take them and their mission is to take out the ship to allow the rebels or escape.
starwarsrebels,343yv6,roninjedi,3,Tue Apr 28 06:22:40 2015 UTC,Tarkin canonized both.
starwarsrebels,34635l,dash_star,2,Tue Apr 28 16:24:51 2015 UTC,What tools do you use to make a reaction video like this?
starwarsrebels,34635l,StealthRabbi,2,Tue Apr 28 17:11:22 2015 UTC,"Well, myself being the biggest tool... dammit - no I use Adobe Creative Cloud - primarily Prem Pro a logitech webcam and a condensor mic is about it! If you have any other questions - don't hesitate :0"

starwarsrebels,343ons,Sapitoelgato,1 point,Tue Apr 28 01:48:47 2015 UTC,"According to Tarkin there is at least one clone still in service, so I don't think it is entirely unreasonable to assume there are a few more."

At that time, he clones were already mostly out of service due to aging and the one that was featured was having a hard time keeping up. Nine more years of accelerated aging, and it's safe to assume that none would be left fit for service."

starwarsrebels,343ons,Pompsy,7,Thu Apr 30 15:04:34 2015 UTC,"It's ~15 years after the Clone Wars. The accelerated aging means the clones that survived the war are pretty much old men at this point. The stormtroopers by this point are almost entirely not clones - they're volunteers and draftees.  Without spoiling too much if you haven't seen trailers for season 2, you'll learn more about the status of the clones next season."

starwarsrebels,343ons,xzenocrimzie,1 point,Fri May 1 00:17:50 2015 UTC,That actually explains why the magazine for their DC-15S blasters were on the right side. It helped for left handed reloading.

starwarsrebels,342xr0,Bananasonfire,5,Mon Apr 27 22:00:19 2015 UTC,"I'd compare it to the first couple of seasons of Clone Wars. It's a bit childish at the beginning, but the characters grow on you and you begin to get invested in the stories of the characters. I think the finale of Rebels Season 1 is at around season 3-4 level quality in Clone Wars, so I can't wait to see what happens next."
starwarsrebels,342xr0,MilkManX,6,Mon Apr 27 22:40:02 2015 UTC,Rebels to me feels like Episode 4 just minus the severed arm. Good show and although I enjoy Clone Wars I find REBELS to be more to my liking (OT>PT any day....)
starwarsrebels,342xr0,HybridS9ldier,5,Mon Apr 27 22:06:38 2015 UTC,"It's Star Wars. What I mean is it appeals to both children and adults. It does take a few episodes before it really feels like a show adults can watch. But when it has death and mentions an alien genocide, I wouldn't really consider it childish."
starwarsrebels,342xr0,Binturung,4,Mon Apr 27 23:44:32 2015 UTC,"It has it's light hearted moments, but for the most part, I'd say it's mature without being exclusionary to kids."
starwarsrebels,342xr0,thatstarwarsdude,3,Mon Apr 27 23:53:47 2015 UTC,"Childish? No. For kids? Yes, but not much more than most Star Wars things are. You should absolutely watch the Clone Wars first because they did a sixth season (on Netflix) that does a better job of directly leading into Episode 3, and also the second season of Rebels will have some elements from the Clone Wars show up in it."
starwarsrebels,342xr0,thatstarwarsdude,2,Mon Apr 27 22:38:42 2015 UTC,"Wait a minute.  The 6th season on Netflix completes the story?  I just heard that there were these unfinished Clone Wars episodes floating around, and that they were just going to make them into comic books or books instead of airing them, since they were only half-done."
starwarsrebels,342xr0,Brookslangford,2,Mon Apr 27 22:53:35 2015 UTC,"Well the Clone Wars is not a single story but rather a collection of story arcs that focus on different characters and different situations. Some arcs didn't make it and were cut. Some stuff like with Darth Maul got covered in comics. However, the final arc of the sixth season of the Clone Wars is directly related to the events of Episode 3. It's not like it ends the day before Episode 3 starts, but it certainly sets it up. If you are a Star Wars fan and do not mind cartoons then there's no reason not to watch it"
starwarsrebels,33x70o,NightFire19,22,Sun Apr 26 14:27:41 2015 UTC,"I feel like the slower style had to do with the fact that the duelists were out of practice, but that breaks from what kanan did against the inquisitor.  I have a feeling the third trilogy will have more fast paced combat because it's more entertaining.  Perhaps Vader will retain the slow pace and simply use the force more in fights?"
starwarsrebels,33x70o,FrankiePoops,11,Sun Apr 26 15:40:37 2015 UTC,"I liked the original trilogy style of fighting, how the atmosphere of suspense lingered between every strike."

starwarsrebels,33x70o,nightmare901,7,Sun Apr 26 18:43:07 2015 UTC,"I think the animation has actually captured this pretty well. They look like real sword fights, but at much faster speeds."
starwarsrebels,33x70o,FrankiePoops,2,Mon Apr 27 00:23:38 2015 UTC,"This is the best option.   Allows for dialogue and intense moments of drama, but with fancy swordsmanship in between."
starwarsrebels,33x70o,aatencio91,2,Mon Apr 27 01:19:11 2015 UTC,"That's how RotJ was, kinda. Some really intense fighting (not Mustafar flipping around or anything, but intense) and more emotion than any other time in Star Wars."
starwarsrebels,33x70o,BurningBushJr,0,Mon Apr 27 19:06:18 2015 UTC,"How do you rank Obi Wan vs Annakin in episode 3? I feel like that was pretty close to what you're talking about,  no?"
starwarsrebels,33x70o,Guyote_,1 point,Mon Apr 27 08:06:20 2015 UTC,It was a step in the right direction. The poor dialogue took away a lot from the slow emotional side.
starwarsrebels,33x70o,luckyloser62,18,Mon Apr 27 14:05:15 2015 UTC,"I figure the pace of duels in the original trilogy came from the fact that Luke was inexperienced, and had not fully figured out what he could do yet coupled with Vader purposefully tempering his own movements. I don't think Vader ever wanted to kill Luke, just defeat/ convert him. I think Vader is still capable of much more than his OT performance would lead us to believe. I am pretty sure we will see some intense duels in the coming season."
starwarsrebels,33x70o,tlor180,12,Sun Apr 26 21:24:42 2015 UTC,I feel like the technological limitations of filming in the 70's had something to do with it as well. As technology improved they were better able to render lightsabers and other visual effects that came as a result of using the force.
starwarsrebels,33x70o,mutually_awkward,2,Sun Apr 26 23:58:43 2015 UTC,"Idk.... I felt like the saber battles in the original trilogy felt like actual dueling techniques, while in the prequels it was just crazy spins and mad slashing."
starwarsrebels,33x70o,frozenchimp,2,Tue Apr 28 07:57:13 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go that far, when Vader provokes Luke he disarms him while swinging the saber like a baseball bat."
starwarsrebels,33x70o,FrankiePoops,3,Sat May 9 02:44:54 2015 UTC,"Obi-Wan vs. Vader was pretty slow paced as well, I don't think Vader ever had the intention of keeping him alive."

starwarsrebels,33x70o,sorcerer165,11,Tue Apr 28 21:12:51 2015 UTC,"Actually, if you look back at season 1, you'll notice that the lightsaber fights weren't THAT fast-paced, compared to earlier canon. In truth, there are actually a lot of longer engagements, and the use of flips and acrobatics is fairly minimalistic. There are some exaggerated movements, but I'd chalk that up to the animation more than anything else. I think this makes sense, with Kanan and the Inquisitor's lack of experience. As for your question, I figure that the Ahsoka vs Vader duel will probably be fairly minimalistic. Ahsoka IS older, and bigger, than she used to be, so I think it would make sense that her fighting style would evolve."

starwarsrebels,33uyu4,CommanderVisor,7,Sat Apr 25 21:48:33 2015 UTC,"I think a bookend ending to the series would leave too much room for speculation. The people behind Clone Wars and Rebels have been clear that they don't want to leave character endings untold (at least the end of their journeys, not their fates)."
starwarsrebels,33uyu4,Pingonaut,3,Sun Apr 26 11:53:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I thought about that. This is only an example of what could happen."
starwarsrebels,33uyu4,pepoluan,2,Sun Apr 26 18:19:59 2015 UTC,"There is also possibility of the characters 'graduating' from an animated TV series into a full-blown Live Action Movie series.  Boba Fett actually made that jump. He first appeared in the animated ""Star Wars Holidays Special"" (though not a series)."
starwarsrebels,33uyu4,Pingonaut,1 point,Tue May 5 21:33:35 2015 UTC,"That's unlikely, and the idea isn't all that appealing to me. Also, you really can't count being in the holiday special as a good thing, or as an accomplishment."
starwarsrebels,33uyu4,aatencio91,7,Wed May 6 00:43:37 2015 UTC,"I like this if only because it keeps Kanan alive. I watched Rebels in about two weeks and I'm now reading A New Dawn, and Kanan is creeping up with Han Solo and Obi-wan Kenobi as my favorite Star Wars character. I want him to live a long and happy life of sticking it to the Empire."
starwarsrebels,33uyu4,TheLogicalErudite,3,Mon Apr 27 19:10:04 2015 UTC,"He has a comic out too. The first one was this month, and next month will be #2. I like the direction it's taken so far."
starwarsrebels,33uyu4,RealVoltar,3,Tue Apr 28 13:37:39 2015 UTC,In just one issue I like it even more than the Vader comic...and I'm really liking the Vader comic.
starwarsrebels,33uyu4,TheLogicalErudite,3,Wed Apr 29 13:34:40 2015 UTC,The Vader is so good. The most recent one definitely has me sold on buying them until they stop.
starwarsrebels,33uyu4,RealVoltar,2,Wed Apr 29 14:06:22 2015 UTC,They pull off the compelling and hilarious combo pretty well while watching Vader torture himself in his mind throughout.  I still think the one issue of Kanan is that +1; just for Billaba.  Before that she was just that chick who sat in that one scene and stood in that other scene and made a darkside derpface for most of a book.  Seven or eight lines out of her and she's up there with Obi Wan and Yoda on my favorite masters shortlist.  That is incredibly sad that we're going to miss out on one of the most articulate jedi masters of her time but it's incredibly interesting to see how that short of a time together plays into who Kanan becomes in season 2.
starwarsrebels,33uyu4,aatencio91,2,Wed Apr 29 15:16:06 2015 UTC,The first one was pretty cool. I'm eagerly awaiting the second.
starwarsrebels,33uyu4,pepoluan,2,Tue Apr 28 16:14:16 2015 UTC,"I do agree that the ""Mentor-Dies-Apprentice-Grows-Up"" is severely overused.  That, plus the fact that outside of the OT characters, Kanan is the only character with three media: A TV Series, a novel, and a comics series. Kanan's backstory has been developed to a significant degree that it's just illogical (for me) to kill the character. You don't want to spend much money and effort for a disposable character.  Finally, Kanan #1 had some 'hints' on Kanan's importance: Depa had chosen him to be her Padawan precisely because of his essence: Caleb's questioning nature. Depa had left important teachings to him, notably about ""attachment"" and ""emotions"". Finally, there's that Holocron.  TCW S2 ""Holocron Heist"" episode had canonically established that Holocrons are Very Important and Very Valuable that only members of the Jedi Council were allowed access. Now, for Depa to actually give Caleb, a Padawan, an important and very valuable treasure of the Jedi..."
starwarsrebels,33wd9j,Xorama,43,Sun Apr 26 06:52:47 2015 UTC,"The Inquisitors aren't Sith. They use the dark side, but that doesn't make them Sith. Any force sensitive person can tap into the dark side, but the Sith are a cult that follow a code and specific teachings. The Rule of Two applies to the Sith, not dark side users."
starwarsrebels,33wd9j,TrueMarksmens,1 point,Sun Apr 26 07:07:48 2015 UTC,"Doesn't that seem like a major cop-out though? Ventress was trained in the ways of the dark side, and she was referred to as Dooku's apprentice. Apprentice what? Apprentice Dark Jedi? Dooku identifies as a Sith, so logically, his students should become Sith as well. I mean, yes you are right, she was technically not a Sith, but it still feels like a copout."
starwarsrebels,33wd9j,dacalpha,3,Tue Apr 28 07:14:08 2015 UTC,A sith master takes on an apprentice.  The goal of the apprentice is to become powerful enough to kill his master and take their place.  The goal of the master is to remain powerful enough to keep everyone else in check. All dark force users under the sith master are supposed to fight to eliminate the weak so that only the strong remain. Only the strong serve the master.  The apprentice can either work with an underling to overthrow the master or kill the underlings that become powerful enough to become a threat.  The sith apprentice and master can train dark side force users. The most talented become sith apprentice candidates. The candidates choose either to work with the apprentice to overthrow the master or kill the apprentice to take their place.  Watch Afro-samurai for a good non-star wars example of how the Sith work.
starwarsrebels,33wd9j,Draiko,2,Tue Apr 28 09:37:59 2015 UTC,I've wondered about this too. What's the difference between a Sith and some random who uses the dark side? Is it that the latter just can't do the force lightning attack?
starwarsrebels,33wd9j,mutually_awkward,1 point,Tue Apr 28 07:55:18 2015 UTC,This was the bases of the question. What do the apprentices of sith apprentices identify as?
starwarsrebels,33wd9j,Mister_Mayor,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:17:26 2015 UTC,"Think of the Sith as a ruling class consisting of only two Darths. You can train with them and even surpass them in skill, but you are not a Sith until you are ""knighted"" as a Darth by an existing Sith."
starwarsrebels,33wd9j,kickassbandgeek,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:22:04 2015 UTC,"The rule of two was never followed to explicitly. Throughout Legends, Sith Lords have trained secondary apprentices in case their primary one failed.   In Dooku's case, Ventress would (this is speculation) eventually help him overthrow Darth Sidious.  In the Force Unleashed, if I recall, Starkiller was supposed to help Vader do the same thing."
starwarsrebels,33wd9j,JCreazy,10,Sat May 2 19:20:16 2015 UTC,The inquisitors aren't sith so they don't qualify.
starwarsrebels,33wd9j,JamesKMaxwell,9,Sun Apr 26 07:08:05 2015 UTC,Exactly. Anyone who watches the show can tell they are Seventh.
starwarsrebels,33wd9j,Fourteen_of_Twelve,7,Sun Apr 26 17:47:53 2015 UTC,"It's the same situation as Ventress and Grevious during the Clone Wars, I believe. They're not true Sith, they just happen to use the Dark Side."

starwarsrebels,33wd9j,hyperlancer,2,Tue Apr 28 07:14:04 2015 UTC,"People like Ventress and the Inquisitors aren't technically Sith so it doesn't break the rule. They are mere servants of them and are treated as disposable. When you look at the rule from a literal sense it seems like a major cop-out, but the idea is still there. While it's no longer canon, Darth Bane despised the idea of an entire organization of numerous people to share that kind of power. He felt that it made the Sith weak and lose their way, and that only the strongest was fit to wield it, which lead him to establish the Rule of Two. It was the Master's duty to train an apprentice worthy enough to inherit this power and keep the legacy of the Sith alive. I've only read the first Bane book so far so anyone feel free to correct me or elaborate on that if needed.  Basically, Palpatine/Maul/Dooku/Vader would never share the true knowledge and secrets of the Sith to these dark acolytes. They are meant to only serve as pawns for the Sith's ultimate goals."
starwarsrebels,33wd9j,Mozerath,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:35:44 2015 UTC,"Vader and Sidious aren't teaching them ancient sith lore or overly advanced force techniques, this way they'll never be able to become contenders, only tools."

starwarsrebels,33wd9j,Radijs,-1,Tue Apr 28 02:11:17 2015 UTC,"The 'rule of two' was something Sidious dispensed with as soon as he had the emperor's throne. In fact he did so while he was still involved in his plot to take the republic. During this time Sidious had at least 2 apprentices. Maul and Dooku both referred to him as Master.  The Inquisitor, Ventress and others are indeed Sith though it's unlikely Sidious enlightened them with a lot of what he knows. Enough to be dangerous to his enemies, not nearly enough to be of any concern to himself."

There's a few words he says in the trailer that just aren't said the same by the imitators... like the word ""someone"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av8GjpGK98A, go to 1:00). You can just TELL it's him. : )"

starwarsrebels,33lihg,slumlord,4,Thu Apr 23 14:41:02 2015 UTC,"It's very strange; I think we automatically compare all of the dialogue to ones we know from the OT. So unless he specifically repeats something from those films, you have to find a spot where he enunciates PART of a word the same way.   For me at least, it was the same with his brief speaking cameo in the ""Spark of Rebellion""... didn't sound like him until I really listened to how he said ""desTROYYYed"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc_G03kx0A4).  I spend way too much time thinking about these things... !"

starwarsrebels,33da6w,Draiko,-4,Wed Apr 22 06:08:17 2015 UTC,Season 2 is going to be great.  I have a strong feeling Sabine is going to be Obi Wan and Satine's grand daughter.  I bet Korkie was their son.  Fan jimmies will be rustled.
starwarsrebels,33da6w,Lanuria,6,Tue Apr 21 19:52:42 2015 UTC,Satine and Obi-Wan never had a sexual relationship or even a romantic relationship that wasn't childhood crushes that continued into adulthood.
starwarsrebels,33da6w,Draiko,-3,Wed Apr 22 01:35:49 2015 UTC,We don't know that.  A deeper relationship was heavily suggested in tcw. Obi was definitely of age to have a few hot nights with Satine.
starwarsrebels,33da6w,ZebZ,6,Wed Apr 22 15:24:39 2015 UTC,Filoni has already flat denied it.
starwarsrebels,33da6w,Draiko,-2,Wed Apr 22 00:49:55 2015 UTC,He denied a tie between Satine and Sabine.  That could exclude direct ties to Bo-Katan and Obi wan or Korkie and whomever he ended up with... From a certain point of view.  Filoni and Lucas like to play with semantics and perspective. Vader killed Anakin... until he didn't.
starwarsrebels,33da6w,CommanderVisor,2,Wed Apr 22 15:25:49 2015 UTC,-_- I have yet to see a Caucasian couple that has spawned an Asian child.
starwarsrebels,33da6w,Draiko,-2,Wed Apr 22 19:58:36 2015 UTC,"Theory  Obi + Satine = Korkie  Korkie + Asian looking woman = Sabine  Obi died when he was 57 and would've been in his 20's or early 30's around the time he met Satine. He was in his mid and late 30's during tcw. He's 52 during the rebels time frame.  Filoni did say he was going to do something with Sabine in season 2 that would rustle fans up quite a bit. Her back story is supposed to ""cause some people to flip"".  That's the only thing I can think of that would use a 16 year old mandalorian girl to rustle fans up.   How else can one use Sabine's back story to cause some people to flip?  Making her an imperial spy is too cliche.  She could probably split off and join a more vicious and unprincipled deathwatch-type rebel cell but that isn't going to rustle fans very much and definitely doesn't involve her back story."
starwarsrebels,33da6w,CommanderVisor,2,Wed Apr 22 20:09:50 2015 UTC,"Sigh...  Sabine was 2 years old at the end of the Clone Wars. This means that she was born around the beginning of it.  TCW starts a bit after the the war starts. Korkie, who debuts in S2 and before the timeskip, is younger than Ahsoka IIRC. That would mean that Korkie banged up some Asian girl WHEN HE WAS A KID."
starwarsrebels,33da6w,Draiko,-2,Wed Apr 22 21:25:34 2015 UTC,"Sigh...  Korkie's age was never stated.  He looked ""of age"" during his last appearance in TCW which was around 20 BBY... before Sabine was born."
starwarsrebels,33da6w,CommanderVisor,1 point,Wed Apr 22 22:12:41 2015 UTC,"Well through Sabine's back story, we're obviously going to learn about what happened to Mandalore after all that Death Watch stuff... Sabine seems to have been an everyday Mandalorian girl who wasn't  In some other interview (either with Filoni or Prinze Jr, idr), I believe it was mentioned that her backstory was like something out of Hunger Games, but I'm going to look into this in case it's a rumor, but it's probably legit. It is also worth mentioning that the Death Watch insignia looks similar to her Starbird symbol, so DW is definitely connected to her. Also IIRC, it was also implied in the Visual Guide or journal that she inherited her armor and her helmet was like that before she got it, so either a parent, both, other family, or a surrogate were part of DW and gave them to her.  If she's an Imperial spy, then yeah, it would be stupid, but not cliche. It would also be stupid for her to be related to Satine/Obi-Wan somehow, and it would ALSO be even more stupid if it wasn't direct, because of the aforementioned confirmation by Filoni that she wasn't related.   It's not good if you lie to your fans about something important and serious. It's even worse if you use exact words in this type of circumstance, because if Sabine was related to the Kryze family in some way, then it would be a shoehorn in the story, and that is bad storytelling. It would hurt Filoni's credibility.  If Filoni made it that Ezra's dad or mom or both of his parents were Jedi, but left for one reason or another, that would be a shoehorn.  If Filoni made it that Chewie was one of the Wookiees saved in the premiere, that would be a shoehorn, because like humans, not every wookiee is somehow closely related to each other. The galaxy is HUGE.  If Filoni made it that Zare is related to Finn, that would be a shoehorn, because the same reasons as above.  The last two are pretty much the same reason why Sabine is probably not related to the Kryze family besides being Mandalorian. Sabine was probably an average Mandalorian girl who realized she was being manipulated and decided to do something about it."
starwarsrebels,33da6w,Draiko,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:26:05 2015 UTC,"Filoni likes to shoehorn.  Asohka as fulcrum? Shoehorn  The empire always setting the same type of trap every few episodes? Shoehorn  Even in TCW, we saw some really cringe-worthy writing and direction.  He and his team aren't beyond cliche."
starwarsrebels,33da6w,CommanderVisor,0,Fri Apr 24 15:47:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but if Filoni lies about something that serious, then it will ruin his credibility, which is BAD, so he probably isn't lying about Sabine not being directly related to the Mandalorian conflict besides being one of the citizens affected.  And like I already said, it would also screw up the logic with the Caucasian + Caucasian/Asian thing, because that makes no sense and about 90%-ish of what Filoni and co. have done was comprehensible.  Fine, I'll make this clear: Shoehorn =/= Cliche. Shoehorn means that it feels forced, cliche means that it's been through and done.  The Ahsoka thing is different for everyone. There was a subtle hint to who she was in Out of Darkness.  Yeah, Filoni and co. aren't strangers to cliches, but they're not idiots either. Which is why FILONI ISN'T LYING, because he knows that it will HURT HIS CREDIBILITY + REPUTATION."

starwarsrebels,33900v,brownrc5,41,Mon Apr 20 16:38:47 2015 UTC,"Inquisitor's aren't all that powerful when it comes down to it. They know just enough to give trouble to a certain set of Force sensitive people, but they wouldn't last five minutes against say, Obi-Wan. The double bladed, spinning lightsaber gives them an advantage that their skills do not. It is by design. The last thing the Emperor and Vader want is a Sith challenge from an Inquisitor."
starwarsrebels,33900v,teachrhomb,15,Mon Apr 20 16:53:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is the answer.  The Inquisitors are not the Sith version of Jedi Knights or even Padawans.  They are Dark side acolytes, meaning they will never be Sith but are trained for specific jobs by their Sith masters.  In TCW, Asajj Ventress was definitely a Dark side acolyte, not a Sith.  So the spinning double-bladed lightsaber is meant to give them an edge and (from what we've seen so far) could be considered a ""trademark"" of the Inquisitors."
starwarsrebels,33900v,Matsuyama_Mamajama,15,Mon Apr 20 18:26:35 2015 UTC,"I agree about the inquisitiors but I think Ventress was a lot more talented than the Sith trained inquisitiors. Considering her beginnings dathomir witch, found and trained by a jedi, then trained by Dooku in the dark side. You get the feeling she was trained a lot by Dooku. Even her lightsaber technique was form 2 like Dooku. I think she was definitely on the road to becoming Sith had Sidious not commanded Dooku get rid of her."
starwarsrebels,33900v,Calculated,9,Tue Apr 21 02:28:40 2015 UTC,"Ventress was an Acolyte only because Dooku couldn't train her officially. We do see that was always his plan and she was an exceptionally powerful Dark Jedi, being able to defeat Jedi Masters and hold her own against Dooku. Frankly speaking, now that Vader hath cometh only Ahsoka can face him squarely. Kanan, Ezra (obviously), and the Inquisitors would in no way be able to handle Vader, much less Ahsoka or Ventress (who I would consider equals). For this reason people should stop believing the new Inquisitor is Ventress (or Maul who held his own against Kenobi and briefly Sidious); furthermore, believing it is Bariss Ofee would also be unrealistic. She was a far better trained padawan than Kanan so she'd dice him too. I don't mean to downgrade Kanan but he is not at the levels these notable characters are"
starwarsrebels,33900v,DrStunJosh,1 point,Tue Apr 21 04:51:30 2015 UTC,"It seems to me like Season 1's Inquisitor (or The Inquisitor for future reference) was probably one of the best of the bunch. I'm not sure if the others will be as competent as him. Remember he kicked ass in almost every fight. Kanan and Ezra only ever escaped with outside help (the rest of the crew in Rise of the old Masters, the giant creature in Gathering Forces). Since in Season 2's trailer it is Ezra, not Kanan, fighting the female inquisitor, I feel like these ones are probably not as good, seeing how a 15 year old boy can stand up to them. This is also a good showing for Ezra though, regarding how ridiculously fast he's improving. But if he tried to fight The Inquisitor at that point, he would still be rather doomed.  Also, Darth Maul doesn't just hold his own against Kenobi, he kicks his ass in every fight after The Phantom Menace."
starwarsrebels,33900v,JarJarBinks590,8,Sat Apr 25 10:47:33 2015 UTC,"I would love to see a older Obi-Wan a few seasons in. He would seriously spank the Inquisitors, shit Ahsoka could probably take on both of the new Inquisitors on her own. I just think of Inquisitors like this, they're a little above Padawans but far below full fledged Knights."
starwarsrebels,33900v,Jason-G169,8,Mon Apr 20 18:47:36 2015 UTC,I mean Ashoka went against ventress and i feel like she's a lot more powerful than these inquisitors so I think Ashoka wouldn't have much of a problem
starwarsrebels,33900v,moon_man97,2,Mon Apr 20 22:06:32 2015 UTC,"I think he won't become involved, since he's tasked with keeping an eye on Luke and the family. If he gets involved with the rebels he's compromising his mission of keeping Luke safe by bringing attention to himself."
starwarsrebels,33900v,divinesleeper,1 point,Wed Apr 22 12:11:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah that makes sense, it's very unlikely he will be in Rebels but what if something happens with Ahsoka, and Ahsoka knows where he is? He could show up but like i said above it's very unlikely."
starwarsrebels,33900v,Jason-G169,3,Wed Apr 22 19:44:24 2015 UTC,"That's one of the main points in rebels.  Keep those who are talented enough to serve, eliminate those who are powerful enough to challenge."
starwarsrebels,33900v,Draiko,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:49:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  If it turns out that Barriss is an Inquisitor next season, it'll be interesting to see if she uses the same lightsaber or not, given her training (Though she did dual wield at the end of TCW too...)"
starwarsrebels,33900v,fablerabble,1 point,Tue Apr 21 13:13:15 2015 UTC,"That makes total sense. If you look at the minor baddies they have all had dual blades. Maul, Savage, Ventress, and all three inquisitors we've seen so far. Its definitely quicker and less dangerous than teaching them to be strong in force techniques. It also helps that it looks intimidating."
starwarsrebels,33900v,eth6113,1 point,Tue Apr 21 14:49:48 2015 UTC,"It's been stated multiple times that double-bladed lightsabers (in general, not to mention this spinning variant) require greater, not lesser, skill to wield properly Their connection to the force must be stronger and they must be more dexterous in order to wield one without killing themselves."
starwarsrebels,33900v,DarthPneumono,14,Sun Apr 26 03:47:25 2015 UTC,"It's probably a 'Baby's First Lightsaber' kind of deal. Not only do they function both as a single or double-bladed saber, but they also spin around the hilt at high speed. That alone allows them to not have to focus on deflecting blaster bolts.   I'd say their sabers make up for what little in the ways of Force expertise they have, especially if they're hunting down the stragglers of the Jedi order and rebels."
starwarsrebels,33900v,Riceatron,11,Mon Apr 20 18:28:33 2015 UTC,"Well, SWTOR isn't canon, but Sith Assassins in that game all carry double sided sabers. Maybe the writers took some inspiration from that?"
starwarsrebels,33900v,Bananasonfire,9,Mon Apr 20 16:44:32 2015 UTC,I think that class was based off Darth Maul who originally worked as an assassin if I'm not mistaken.
starwarsrebels,33900v,Sgs36,3,Tue Apr 21 00:14:20 2015 UTC,"The inquisitors were probably all trained by the same person and it was probably done quickly.  Imo the spinning saber is to produce fear in the untrained.  Remember when we first meet the inquisitor vader sends him after fprce sensitive children,  also remember ezra and kanans expressions when the inquisitor started spinning his lightsaber.  Imo palpatine probably thinks most jedo are dead or in hiding at this point and the inquisitors are there for intimidation,  they don't expect to face a true jedi or anyone that could fight them equally so they trade some practacility for intimidation.    Also maybe vader/palp was worried about the inquisitors rising against them so they gave them this weapon with a flaw that a skilled duelist could easily exploit.    The empire is knkwn for making weapons with flaws"
starwarsrebels,33900v,greggs92,3,Wed Apr 22 06:09:33 2015 UTC,"Regarding the female inquisitor, I have my doubts that it's Barris Offee. I'll say that again, I don't think it's Barris. More likely it's going to be Zare's sister, who was taken from the Imperial Academy due to her force sensitivity. It would also explain Ezra holding back, rather than trying to attack her in the clip - he doesn't want to hurt his friend's sister unless he has to."
starwarsrebels,33900v,JarJarBinks590,2,Sat Apr 25 10:50:20 2015 UTC,"Every time I see the fight at the end of season 1 it is painfully obvious that the lightsaber is not some huge crutch.  In fact, hold a spinning blade that can cut you to shreds requires oodles of precision."
starwarsrebels,33900v,HalcyonWind,3,Tue Apr 21 18:21:39 2015 UTC,"However, as a tool to take down an untrained Force-wielder, it does the job well. I like it because it emphasizes the doctrine of intimidation over pure practicality that the Empire adopts. Against a (decently) skilled jedi(ish) though? He didn't do so hot."
starwarsrebels,33900v,The_Last_Minority,2,Tue Apr 21 21:59:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it worked well enough against Ezra. He was lucky to get away with just a scratch."
starwarsrebels,337qzf,Super_Inuit,21,Mon Apr 20 08:49:40 2015 UTC,"At 2:50 of the trailer, he gets struck in the shoulder by Vader.   I predict Ahsoka's ""They'll all be coming now""  line comes right after she saves Kanan and Ezra from Vader. In the same  scene (or scene immediately before/after), Kanan talks about how lucky they were to escape. And that's why Vader sends two inquisitors to hunt them down while he tracks down Ahsoka himself (hence the absence of Ahsoka and Vader throughout most the season)."
starwarsrebels,337qzf,mojave955,9,Mon Apr 20 09:20:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it sounds like that is what will happen. I'm completely ok with that unless we don't see Vader or Ahsoka through out the whole of season 2. The Ahsoka/Vader fight is hyped up like crazy, the only thing i can compare it to is like waiting for Guts to finally get his revenge on Griffith. The wait is killing me."

starwarsrebels,337qzf,mojave955,3,Tue Apr 21 16:28:48 2015 UTC,So does this mean his hands are intact? At 1:16 he seems to have the mark already but his hands are intact so I think he is not handless yet. Yeah he still has his hands just looked at 2:10 as well. Tons of shots where he still has his hands and the mark so hooray Kanan still has his hands.

starwarsrebels,337dda,ShadowEye37,18,Mon Apr 20 05:32:10 2015 UTC,I'm guessing it's going to be a scenario where Zeb was safe the entire time. Poor Gregor though. That explosion must have screwed him up good.

starwarsrebels,337dda,mojave955,5,Mon Apr 20 09:22:53 2015 UTC,Well he's already lost his mind once...
starwarsrebels,337dda,Jawzilla1,10,Mon Apr 20 16:58:23 2015 UTC,Gregor looks like... He's off the rocker.
starwarsrebels,337dda,shikhargpt,7,Mon Apr 20 07:00:50 2015 UTC,Yeah im guessing Gregor is going to be the only crazy one out of the group. Probably just some comic relief. If you look at Wolfee or Rex in the trailer those two dont look like their playing around while Gregor kinda looks a little out there when Rex makes the comment about stormtroopers.
starwarsrebels,337dda,Raptor665,5,Mon Apr 20 16:54:15 2015 UTC,"Gregor seems to have lost it, a mix of the near isolation and shellshock perhaps?"

starwarsrebels,3369vu,coal8,10,Mon Apr 20 20:55:56 2015 UTC,They're way skinny like that as a nod to McQuarrie's original artwork.
starwarsrebels,3369vu,aatencio91,5,Tue Apr 21 01:30:49 2015 UTC,It's that skinny in ANH. It looks like they got a bit fatter by ROTJ. I don't have the special edition so I don't know if they made them wider in that version.
starwarsrebels,3369vu,Pabst_Blue_Gibbon,4,Mon Apr 20 21:49:05 2015 UTC,"I think it adds finesse.  Especially when you see them used one-handed, since they give off an epee vibe (as the Inquisitor occasionally does, as did Dooku in CW).  But it did take a little getting used to, yeah."
starwarsrebels,3369vu,fablerabble,3,Tue Apr 21 15:30:20 2015 UTC,"It makes sense, in a way. The saber basically focuses energy through a crystal, right? So it should get thinner towards the end, rather than being like a bar."

I know right, it's actually kind of adorable, maybe with Ahsoka being part of season 2 he will pick some stuff up from her, she knows how to throw down better than Kanan and Ezra put together, i want to see if she got better than she was which i think is pretty reasonable. That ending scene to the trailer was pretty horrible Saber skills on Ezra's part, but then again it is Vader. Really hoping Vader does something horrible to Kanan so the kids who watch the show know how much of a monster Vader really is."
starwarsrebels,3369vu,Jason-G169,2,Mon Apr 20 02:21:01 2015 UTC,"Ezra's lightsaber is cool and unique only to him, and yet Kanan can use it way better. Kanan should just permanently take it and use it alongside his and just bench Ezra, but he's too cool of a guy to do that."
starwarsrebels,3369vu,suss2it,1 point,Thu Apr 23 01:24:22 2015 UTC,"Well, after seeing how to use it like a boss, hopefully Ezra follows suit."
starwarsrebels,3369vu,MasterMac94,3,Thu Apr 23 01:27:42 2015 UTC,I think its funny that he never thought to use it like that even tho he's the one that built the damn thing.
starwarsrebels,3369vu,suss2it,1 point,Thu Apr 23 01:32:35 2015 UTC,"Perhaps but it'd be moving too quickly if he was already good enough to duel other saber wielders. Let's see him make original use of the blaster he incorporated in his saber, though."
starwarsrebels,3369vu,divinesleeper,1 point,Wed Apr 22 11:51:00 2015 UTC,Months later and I still love that fight scene. I mean we had Kanan using Ezra's lightsaber than Ezra using his and then finally Kanan dual-wielding both. Definitely one of the best we've gotten in the animated series so far.
starwarsrebels,3352z3,twilly13,8,Sun Apr 19 17:04:48 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I heard that Rex and Ahsoka would've had an epilogue arc if TCW got all the way to Order 66 and RotS. I think it was said by Filoni at the Clone Wars Untold panel or something at Celebration.  I wonder if Rex and/or the other clones will get into a battle with Vader... although then again, they'd probably be screwed."
starwarsrebels,3352z3,CommanderVisor,10,Sun Apr 19 17:30:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah Vader would wipe the floor with Rex, Wolffe and Gregor. But Rex was kind of like Ani's brother which would be very cool to see how Rex reacts to Vader. Same thing goes with Ahsoka. I wonder if they will know Anakin is no longer the Anakin they knew and they have to kill him or will they try and talk some sense into him. It's gonna be a gooooooooood series from here on out."
starwarsrebels,3352z3,Jason-G169,6,Sun Apr 19 21:27:37 2015 UTC,"Well, same reason but another example of it, yeah.  Dave did say that the Fives' storyline in season 6 was significant to the reason Rex is in the position he's in.  edit: I should also say because it's seriously slick, Dave also started suggesting scenarios that involved the attractiveness of the idea that knowledge can defeat programming and that during a situation where someone didn't respond to their programming, they would then become the enemy too."

The only two dark things that happened so far are a double beheading and a bad guy committing suicide. Oh, and the Inquisitor murdered the crew in Ezra's vision. It has a long way to go before it's darker than TCW.  It would be nice to see a reference to the show though. I don't think it'll have a main character from the show, but someone like the Pheonix Commander Sato appearing is likely. Assuming he doesn't die, of course."
starwarsrebels,336xmt,TrueMarksmens,2,Mon Apr 20 02:53:05 2015 UTC,Certainly much darker than the first 13 episodes of clone wars.
starwarsrebels,336xmt,BurningBushJr,1 point,Tue Apr 21 06:42:10 2015 UTC,"Oh, definitely. The only dark thing about the first 13 episodes of Clone Wars that I can remember are... well, it's actually from TCW movie. Jabba's guards bring him the heads of his (5? 6?) bounty hunters who were trying to find his son. That's pretty gruesome."

Mostly because it will will keep the show from watering down it's purpose. The stakes have gotten really high from that season 2 trailer, and that is only the tip of the iceberg! The difference from this show and TCW is TCW was leading down an inevitable betrayal in Revenge of the Sith, and this show will lead into or set up key elements into the Rebellions first major victory over the Empire, which will ultimately happen in Rogue One."
starwarsrebels,335y2w,Sapitoelgato,1 point,Sun Apr 19 22:05:26 2015 UTC,I can totally see this show ending around the time of Rouge One and even help set up some things for that film
starwarsrebels,335y2w,mrdefoster,4,Mon Apr 20 01:02:01 2015 UTC,I have a feeling this show is going to end with some key rebel characters on Alderaan cheering the successful acquisition of the death star plans right before they look up to see the death star in the sky.
starwarsrebels,335y2w,Draiko,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:33:43 2015 UTC,"I seem to think Dave said he was pacing it based on the OT movies so I'm actually expecting 3 seasons and this is the Empire Striking Back.  They did blow up Tarkin's SD at the end of last season and it looks like Vader's hunting them down to their base on Lothal so they have to flee which is pretty familiar.  It's kind of hard to not expect an, ""Obi Wan never told you what happened to your master,"" moment near the end of this season."

Do you guys think that planet they're on in the trailer is the same flat planet Gregor was on? Maybe he sent out a distress signal after order 66 and an awol Wolffe and Rex show up and hide out there!

They need to kill Kanaan or something with Vader. Obviously Ashoka and Vader is coming eventually, but they can't just keep evading Vader."
starwarsrebels,331ryt,Coovyy,40,Sat Apr 18 18:21:42 2015 UTC,Nothing about that trailer made him seem weak to me.  I imagine they will just barely escape a few times.
starwarsrebels,331ryt,HalcyonWind,20,Sat Apr 18 18:49:49 2015 UTC,I'm hoping he chops both kanan's hands off in one blow after that scene in the trailer fades to black.
starwarsrebels,331ryt,kaptenjei,4,Sat Apr 18 19:14:04 2015 UTC,That'd be pretty sweet.
starwarsrebels,331ryt,HalcyonWind,2,Sat Apr 18 19:22:33 2015 UTC,"But still, think about all the Jedi he killed. If we keep getting away all the time, that'll be eh. And think about how pissed Palpatine would be. He needs to be dangerous, somehow."
starwarsrebels,331ryt,Coovyy,9,Sat Apr 18 18:59:17 2015 UTC,I would recommend looking into the Darth Vader comics that have been coming out.  I think it will satisfy a lot there.
starwarsrebels,331ryt,HalcyonWind,2,Sat Apr 18 19:22:14 2015 UTC,"I've read the first two, and I like how that's been, but in those two he's (mostly) been pretty successful and menacing so far. Don't tell me what happens beyond the second comic please. I might pick up the others today though."
starwarsrebels,331ryt,Coovyy,7,Sat Apr 18 19:24:18 2015 UTC,Well from those two you certainly have already seen that Vader does get crapped on by Palpatine.
starwarsrebels,331ryt,HalcyonWind,3,Sat Apr 18 19:26:54 2015 UTC,Not for everyone at least
starwarsrebels,331ryt,ImNoBatman,27,Sat Apr 18 21:25:02 2015 UTC,"Vader doesn't have to kill everybody to seem threatening.   When Luke faced Vader in Cloud City he barely escaped by the power of luck and The Force. That made Vader seem like a massive threat that Luke wasn't even close to ready to face.   The characters in the original trilogy barely escaped Vader's grasp a few times and nobody can say they watched Empire Strikes Back and thought ""wow that Vader guy is weak!"""
starwarsrebels,331ryt,blink5694,9,Sun Apr 19 01:01:21 2015 UTC,"This is probably the best comment here as a rebuttal to what I said. This makes sense. They can totally get away as long as it doesn't happen too often.  I never said I thought they'd make it horrible for sure, I just voiced my concern for that possibility.  Thanks!"
starwarsrebels,331ryt,Coovyy,13,Sat Apr 18 20:08:05 2015 UTC,"They don't need to make him look weak. Since they are now a Rebel cell, he may use them to find and eradicate the other cells, kind of like his plan in A New Hope with Luke, Han and Leia."
starwarsrebels,331ryt,LordKurst,2,Sat Apr 18 21:14:09 2015 UTC,Hm. This makes sense. Okay. I really hope it works out well. Watering down Vader wouldn't ever be good.

starwarsrebels,331ryt,chewee123,8,Sat Apr 18 19:24:51 2015 UTC,Sorry for being the third person chiming in on Vader. But the Rebels escaping just barely with their lives and being forced to leave Lothal wouldn't make Vader look at all weak. There is no need to kill a character to make someone look dangerous and kinda seems like a cop out way of doing it.
starwarsrebels,331ryt,ddrober2003,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:26:08 2015 UTC,"I mean, I suppose. But like I said to a few other people, Vader is a Jedi killing machine, and a DARK LORD OF THE SITH. I'm just afraid he won't be as dangerous as he should be. It's true he doesn't need to kill people, but if his mission is to capture the Lothal rebels and he keeps failing, that's no fun.  I feel like Dooku failing in the clone wars is different than Vader failing."
starwarsrebels,331ryt,Coovyy,5,Sat Apr 18 18:52:56 2015 UTC,"I have no link to it, so I hope I am remembering this right, but I believe one of the main people working on it, maybe even Dave Filoni, talked about Vader showing up and being aware of the problems of them constantly escaping Vader taking away from him. I imagine Vader will be a major source of conflict at the beginning of the season and be the very reason the Rebels have to leave Lothal, with Ezra being against it and then soundly defeated by Vader who wasn't even trying.  I just don't think Vader is going to be a long reoccurring character and maybe Lothal even suffers that Base Delta Zero order, leaving Tarkin and Vader assuming the Rebels are dead."
starwarsrebels,331ryt,ddrober2003,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:04:17 2015 UTC,"That's a possibility! And Woah, that would be intense if something like that happened."
starwarsrebels,331ryt,Coovyy,3,Sat Apr 18 19:10:58 2015 UTC,"He needs to atleast damage the Jedi, leave Ezra and Kanan with a scar or something."

starwarsrebels,331ryt,Coovyy,5,Sat Apr 18 19:30:10 2015 UTC,Looks like Kanan gets beat but I think Ezra is about to use his secret blaster on his lightsaber to catch Vader off guard.

starwarsrebels,331ryt,BlueSmoke95,32,Sat Apr 18 19:01:40 2015 UTC,"It is James Earl Jones though... it was a little off. It almost seemed younger with more energy though. Maybe a slightly more ""enthusiastic"" Vader, before the years of bitterness fighting the rebels?"

starwarsrebels,331ryt,MasterMac94,4,Sat Apr 18 21:45:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed, it sounds way off. It sounds like a person with a normally bright voice trying to do a dark voice.   edit: huh, apparently that's James Earl Jones. Either it's badly recorded or his voice got real weak with age."
starwarsrebels,331ryt,Galactic_kitten,4,Sat Apr 18 23:04:48 2015 UTC,"I would expect them to pitch shift his recordings down a bit for the final product. Given his age, it can't be easy to get to that type of voice. It would make more sense to deliver it in a slightly higher register and then shift the best takes down. Maybe put some effects on for a more mechanical tone."
starwarsrebels,331ryt,JVAFD,3,Sat Apr 18 21:45:17 2015 UTC,"It sounds more similar to how he sounded in ANH, to be honest.  He sounds different in each of the movies he is in."
starwarsrebels,331ryt,ZEB1138,-7,Sun Apr 19 00:23:54 2015 UTC,I would have preferred it if they got the actor who played anakin in TCW and just kind of warped his voice. It would have made a smoother transition I think.
starwarsrebels,331ryt,RIP_Porkins,15,Tue Apr 21 02:32:34 2015 UTC,VADER IS FUCKING TERRIFYING
starwarsrebels,331ryt,Thequadratus,11,Sat Apr 18 22:40:28 2015 UTC,Hahaha! Did you see how he just fended off Kanan like that? That initial blow just shows how strong he is!
starwarsrebels,331ryt,Jonny004,14,Sat Apr 18 19:42:52 2015 UTC,"Wow Rex!  Man so excited, I can't wait to see what stories they tell.  Not really a fan of how the clones look though but maybe it will grow on me, like they looked too cheery like Santa Claus.  I really want to see them touch on how Rex felt about Order 66. What happened? Did he carry out the order but somehow came to his senses after? Was he marching on the temple with Vader? What happened to Cody?   We also saw 2 new Inquisitors. I wonder if the female one could be Barris, it's possible.  What I am really looking forward to is the inevitable Ahsoka v Vader showdown.  I really hope they can pull it off.   It will be hard though, the fight between Ahsoka and Vader in my mind will be hard to repeat if Ahsoka survives the first battle.  In my mind either 2 things will happen this season if Ahsoka and Vader do fight. This fight will most likely occur because Ahsoka will need to stall Vader from catching the group or something similar so either   Ahsoka finds out that Vader is Anakin but will die   or   Ahsoka does not find out who Vader is and manages to escape with the group.    But at anyrate I'm binge watching the Clone Wars now and this trailer gave made me extremely cheerful, maybe not as amazed as say the trailer for Episode VII but close"
starwarsrebels,331ryt,Stained_Panda,16,Sun Apr 19 00:26:39 2015 UTC,"I watched the panel and a kid asked about Rex and how he survived and didn't kill anakin.

starwarsrebels,331ryt,zeitzeph,10,Sat Apr 18 19:07:33 2015 UTC,"Guess who else Fives warned? Kix. And guess what else? Kix is bald, just like the clone standing left to Rex during the trailer."

By the way, these AT-ATs might be prototype versions. Compare then to these prototype Legends AT-ATs. Both are much more square than in ESB, have a thinner head and a piece of metal covering it. Also, the Rebels one features a rear turret (which, now that I come to think of it, would have really helped the Empire back in Hoth), while the ESB ones don't."

starwarsrebels,331ryt,Random_Shadowscale,6,Sat Apr 18 19:31:50 2015 UTC,"As someone pointed out earlier, one of them is most likely Kix, since he was with Rex when Fives warned them"
starwarsrebels,331ryt,RIP_Porkins,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:46:27 2015 UTC,"It'd be great to see Kix again, also he doesn't have a tattoo on his head like Jessie."
starwarsrebels,331ryt,Random_Shadowscale,5,Sat Apr 18 22:43:18 2015 UTC,IS JEJ returning to do the voice for Vader?
starwarsrebels,331ryt,Art00D2,9,Sat Apr 18 23:44:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, they recorded his dialogue back in S1"
starwarsrebels,331ryt,Wilhelm_Screamer,5,Sat Apr 18 19:11:13 2015 UTC,O thank The Maker!
starwarsrebels,331ryt,Art00D2,2,Sat Apr 18 20:09:10 2015 UTC,"Nope, it was probably recorded after the season was finished. Season 2 got greenlit right before the show premiered though, but I imagine that the scripts weren't finished that early, so JEJ probably came back later when Season 2 was done writing. UNLESS the extra scene was done ahead of time."
starwarsrebels,331ryt,CommanderVisor,-2,Sat Apr 18 20:30:32 2015 UTC,I don't think so. Doesn't really sound like him.

starwarsrebels,331ryt,Practicalaviationcat,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:19:35 2015 UTC,I didn't notice it. What changed?
starwarsrebels,331ryt,Jonny004,2,Sat Apr 18 22:59:36 2015 UTC,Her hair is blue in a few of the shots. 1:13 is one.
starwarsrebels,331ryt,Practicalaviationcat,2,Sun Apr 19 00:25:19 2015 UTC,Oh wow! I didn't notice! Thanks for pointing that out! What do you think of it?
starwarsrebels,331ryt,Jonny004,2,Sun Apr 19 00:28:04 2015 UTC,I don't like it as much as the season one hair but it's still pretty good. I do like any show that is willing to change character designs though.   Potential spoiler: Here is a statue of her design
starwarsrebels,331ryt,Practicalaviationcat,2,Sun Apr 19 00:30:23 2015 UTC,Yeah I just saw in the Star Wars subreddit. Insteresting. Wonder if it's just the statue or she's going to look that much older in the show.
starwarsrebels,331ryt,Jonny004,1 point,Sun Apr 19 00:34:38 2015 UTC,If the series is building up to episode IV I think the younger characters will defiantly age.
starwarsrebels,331ryt,Practicalaviationcat,1 point,Sun Apr 19 00:36:32 2015 UTC,That...looks really creepy.

starwarsrebels,331ryt,fallopian_pancake,4,Sun Apr 19 14:13:15 2015 UTC,Holy shit Filoni. You almost outdid JJ.
starwarsrebels,331ryt,denselross,4,Sat Apr 18 19:19:46 2015 UTC,"Man ... as someone who never watch TCW, I feel like I'm missing out a lot."
starwarsrebels,331ryt,bluegrassgazer,6,Sun Apr 19 09:18:50 2015 UTC,You now have your summer assignment. Be sure to watch in the correct order.   http://m.ign.com/articles/2014/03/18/star-wars-the-clone-wars-how-to-watch-in-the-right-order
starwarsrebels,331ryt,AthasDuneWalker,13,Sun Apr 19 10:41:46 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I'm a little concerned about all of the Clone Wars characters that are returning.  I hope that they don't end up overshadowing the actual main cast."
starwarsrebels,331ryt,mrpiggywinkles52,9,Sun Apr 19 16:41:14 2015 UTC,Theyre expanding to show the wider rebellion so it makes sense we'll see more characters from TCW and the rebellion itself cycling in and out between episodes as  recurring characters whilst others like Hondo will probably only be around for an episode or two.
starwarsrebels,331ryt,blue_charles,19,Sat Apr 18 20:10:21 2015 UTC,"I trust Dave and his crew can balance these characters. We've had a season to get into the Ghost's crew, and they've established themselves as characters. With that, they're now blending the two shows together. This trailer feels like rebels in all the good ways and feels like clone wars in all the good ways too. Most of all though, it feels like some awesome, awesome Star Wars. I'm so hyped."
starwarsrebels,331ryt,tonuchi,6,Sat Apr 18 21:04:16 2015 UTC,And we don't have to waste too much time establishing these old characters.
starwarsrebels,331ryt,grogleberry,9,Sat Apr 18 20:20:49 2015 UTC,"It's going to be a longer series this year.  We don't know what role individuals are going to have yet, do we?  Presumably Ahsoka is going to be fairly major, but the likes of Hondo or the clones might just be 1 episode or one 2-4 episode arc.  It's still the same universe so if anything, there needs to be a fair bit of crossover. This series is, after all, supposed to bridge the gap in the canon."
starwarsrebels,331ryt,raknor88,2,Sat Apr 18 22:22:06 2015 UTC,Damn. I was so hoping for just a half second shot of Snipps v Vader.
starwarsrebels,331ryt,Raptor665,2,Sun Apr 19 10:21:31 2015 UTC,"Im scared for Wolffe and the other clone. I feel like all three of them obviously wont go onto the ghost, but where will the other two be when Rex is on it?"

starwarsrebels,331ryt,hozboo,18,Sat Apr 18 18:33:10 2015 UTC,That's definitely James Earl Jones but I will admit his voice has changed in the last 30 years or so

starwarsrebels,331ryt,BurningBushJr,1 point,Sun Apr 19 05:13:15 2015 UTC,Hondo was one of my favorite characters in TCW. His return has definitely been underappreciated.

starwarsrebels,331ryt,do_u_even_gif_bro,1 point,Sun Apr 19 12:42:34 2015 UTC,"So Hondo, ventress, and the clones return. It sounds like filoni really just wanted to get the band back together.   This could be great but I'm worried they will overshadow the ghosts crew. I'll give filoni and co the benefit of the doubt at this point but I'm a bit skeptical. I just hope this doesn't become the clone wars in all but name. Don't get me wrong I loved clone wars too but Part of rebels' strength is that it's a new setting with new characters."
starwarsrebels,331ryt,suss2it,1 point,Sun Apr 19 15:38:23 2015 UTC,"Where did you see Ventress, or was that mentioned at a panel or something?"
starwarsrebels,331ryt,do_u_even_gif_bro,-1,Sun Apr 19 16:24:17 2015 UTC,Female in mask with red light saber. Im willing to bet it's ventress.
starwarsrebels,331ryt,ganthetjr,1 point,Sun Apr 19 22:17:41 2015 UTC,That doesn't really fit with the latter portion of her character development. I'm thinking either a new character or Barriss Offee.

starwarsrebels,331ryt,Wilhelm_Screamer,9,Mon Apr 20 17:18:32 2015 UTC,Accelerated aging does that to you
starwarsrebels,331ryt,Tizzlefix,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:32:50 2015 UTC,Sorry for late reply but if he had accelerated aging past how he looked in the TCW then he'd look older or even be dead. Not saying I'm correct but this somewhat confirms they only had accelerated growth from the younger age group and it just stopped once they became fully developed adults (probably around 20 years old).
starwarsrebels,331ryt,Wilhelm_Screamer,1 point,Sat Apr 18 20:09:32 2015 UTC,"They are 20 at the time of the clone wars, it's 15 years after, so they would physically be at 50 years old.  Certainly NOT on death's door by any means.  And you could very easily have greyed hair by that age."
starwarsrebels,331ryt,Tizzlefix,1 point,Sun May 3 18:07:52 2015 UTC,But they didn't look nearly that old in the trailer.
starwarsrebels,331ryt,Wilhelm_Screamer,1 point,Sun May 3 19:09:02 2015 UTC,What do you mean?  A beard like that can be done in the timespan and the hair can certainly be that grey
starwarsrebels,331ryt,Tizzlefix,1 point,Sun May 3 19:44:57 2015 UTC,I'd say you have more evidence on your claim but who knows if they actually die earlier than natural beings... Maybe I'm just optimistic.

starwarsrebels,33239c,GodotIsWaiting4U,16,Sat Apr 18 21:18:36 2015 UTC,"We don't really know yet. It looks to me like their AT-TE is on Abafar. They might have gotten stuck there when it went down and missed the order. Dave Filoni said that Rex was listening when Fives warned him about the chip, and Rex would have looked into it afterwards because he knew Fives well enough to know he wouldn't have just lost his shit completely for no reason. Rex might have found a way to resist. Or he might have had his taken out."

starwarsrebels,33239c,Jonny004,2,Wed Apr 22 06:26:40 2015 UTC,"True, but ARC troopers were bred to be more independent, so maybe that had a role in this."
starwarsrebels,33239c,BCM_00,5,Sun Apr 19 00:19:55 2015 UTC,"Does that still apply?  In the ""new canon,"" ARC seems to be entirely based on retraining, rather than different breeding techniques."
starwarsrebels,33239c,BCM_00,5,Sun Apr 19 05:41:43 2015 UTC,Fives and Echo is an example of that.  They where normal troopers but was later promoted to ARC Troopers.
starwarsrebels,33239c,Jonny004,2,Sun Apr 19 09:36:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I am curious, though, if ""Alpha"" ARCs and ""Null"" ARCs (which had less genetic tampering for loyalty and obedience) are still canon, or if all ARCs were promoted from existing clones.  We don't have any canon examples of those to my knowledge (although they still exist in my headcanon)."

starwarsrebels,33258o,CakeLicker,10,Sat Apr 18 23:48:20 2015 UTC,I was expecting Ahsoka to show up and tell Vader to stop in the last couple seconds.
starwarsrebels,33258o,Jason-G169,13,Sat Apr 18 22:40:45 2015 UTC,I'm guessing that's exactly what will happen when we reach this point.
starwarsrebels,33258o,IfinallyhaveaReddit,10,Sat Apr 18 23:05:50 2015 UTC,It looked like Ezra was about to shoot him with the secret blaster. Might be enough to catch Vader off guard.
starwarsrebels,33258o,Mr_Thunders,5,Sun Apr 19 11:27:56 2015 UTC,"Lol, no. This is Vader at his peak. Ezra isn't going to get the drop on him."
starwarsrebels,33258o,Skeezypal,1 point,Thu Apr 23 12:16:31 2015 UTC,It could also be Vader at his most arrogant. I don't think he would even consider a blaster built into a lightsaber. Chances are though he will fire it but Vader will deflect it letting someone else save the day.
starwarsrebels,33258o,Mr_Thunders,8,Thu Apr 23 12:41:15 2015 UTC,"honestly man. when vader appears...the music stops...and all you can hear is this slight ringing, a lightsaber hum and his breathing. dude thats terrifying"

starwarsrebels,33258o,Jonny004,15,Sun Apr 19 00:21:20 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that he is voiced by James Earl Jones and the reason it sounds off is just because of the fact that James is older now.
starwarsrebels,33258o,HyliasHero,7,Sun Apr 19 01:18:10 2015 UTC,Huh I'm really curious as to why you're not a fan of this Darth vader. I would assume James Earl Jones is most people's favorite Darth Vader. Do you prefer a different voice?
starwarsrebels,33258o,ImNoBatman,3,Sun Apr 19 01:11:39 2015 UTC,"Lol, no. I'm a huge fan of his! Idk, just sounded different on the trailer for me. Maybe it's my headphones or something..."
starwarsrebels,33258o,Jonny004,1 point,Sun Apr 19 01:26:14 2015 UTC,"Compare these: 1, 2, 3, 4 to how he originally sounded  He sounds very similar to the original ANH, but with him probably lacking the frustration over losing the Death Star plans driving him.  We never see him quite so angry as when he orders the search of the Blockade Runner."
starwarsrebels,33258o,ZEB1138,2,Tue Apr 21 02:43:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed, it's weird. I can definitely tell it is James Earl Jones, but it sounds...too electronic. Maybe they had to overcompensate due to his age."
starwarsrebels,33258o,ZTHerper,2,Sun Apr 19 03:45:55 2015 UTC,"Okay, I thought I was crazy for thinking that his voice sounded a little off. How could James himself sound any less than perfect? I'm glad I'm not the only one. I don't hate it by any means and wouldn't want anyone else voicing him. He just sounds a bit different from OT Vader for some reason."
starwarsrebels,3339mx,TrueMarksmens,20,Sun Apr 19 02:41:57 2015 UTC,Does this mean that the episode numbering madness continues?
starwarsrebels,3339mx,LionFox,9,Sun Apr 19 08:29:15 2015 UTC,"so... ""begins in the summer and continues in the fall""... god dammit! I almost wish they'd wait so we don't have to wait for the continuation for so long :/ But oh, well... we're getting more Rebels real soon! YAY!"
starwarsrebels,3339mx,pufferpig,7,Sun Apr 19 13:14:31 2015 UTC,"so i'm guessing that vader will either show up in the beginning of the series in this movie to start the season with a bang, or will either be the finale."
starwarsrebels,3339mx,LeDuc725,16,Sun Apr 19 06:35:37 2015 UTC,"It probably means 44 minutes and not actually an hour: Rebels Season 1 Premiere was advertised as an hour long, but it's only an hour long when it has commercials."

starwarsrebels,3339mx,CommanderVisor,3,Sun Apr 19 03:19:52 2015 UTC,"Spark of Rebellion was actually a two-parter, so by that logic, The Siege of Lothal is a two-parter too."
starwarsrebels,3339mx,WanderingWindward,1 point,Sun Apr 19 04:23:36 2015 UTC,"uh, Spark of the Rebellion doesn't actually count as an offical part of season 1.  Droids in Distress is episode 1 of season 1.  Spark of the Rebellion is a made-for-tv movie which stands on its own.  Sounds like Siege of Lothal might count the same way?  Especially if there's such a long gap between it and the rest of the episodes..."
starwarsrebels,3339mx,CommanderVisor,1 point,Sun Apr 19 11:06:19 2015 UTC,"Well IIRC, before the series aired, one of the people working on the show said that there would be 16 episodes, so there are:   The Shorts (counted as 1 episode altogether) Spark of Rebellion Part 1 Spark of Rebellion Part 2 Droids in Distress Fighter Flight Rise of the Old Masters Breaking Ranks Out of Darkness Empire Day Gathering Forces Path of the Jedi Idiot's Array Vision of Hope Call to Action Rebel Resolve Fire Across the Galaxy   Even if Spark of Rebellion doesn't official count as part of Season 1, it was produced as part of it, so it doesn't matter.  Yeah, the gap doesn't make much sense to me either."

He was the mastermind behind Castle in the Sky, Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, among other things.   Very beautiful movies, in music, animation, and story. You should watch one when you can.  The tank also being a home is a reference to... well, how Howl's castle home moves by walking."
starwarsrebels,332i67,Pompsy,21,Sat Apr 18 22:09:56 2015 UTC,At least we know that Inquisitor from season one's type of lightsaber lives on.
starwarsrebels,332i67,Sapitoelgato,13,Sat Apr 18 22:13:45 2015 UTC,It is a ridiculously cool lightsaber. I've always been a big fan of Sith/Dark Jedi/Inquisitors.
starwarsrebels,332i67,frodofappins,18,Sat Apr 18 22:15:40 2015 UTC,I think the female is Zare's sister.

starwarsrebels,332i67,Literally__Shitler,9,Sun Apr 19 00:13:25 2015 UTC,"Also, Barriss can totally show up as something else. Maybe an extremist rebel, fighting against the Empire but using terrorism? Attacking civilian infrastructure, murdering suspected collaborators, trying to bait the Empire into retaliating in ways that will inflict civilian casualties to garner support for the rebel movement. (It's a very effective real-world tactic and the Empire would absolutely fall for it. Would also be funny if she pushes them too far and they BDZ her planet.)"

She bombed the temple because she believed the Jedi order had become an army of the dark side. I don't think she would willingly join the Emperor. She did not want the Republic to fail. I'd rather think she would be a rebel... Or a bounty hunter, like Ventress... Or dead... :/"
starwarsrebels,332i67,pufferpig,10,Sun Apr 19 03:33:12 2015 UTC,"Funny how all of them having the same lighsabres means Disney can keep selling the ""inquisitor lightsabre""... as they are all ""inquisitors"".

starwarsrebels,332i67,Eggleston,5,Sun Apr 19 20:18:34 2015 UTC,"Is it likely that the person you've labelled 'Inquisitor 1' here is Sarah Michelle Gellar's character? Obviously without having any information on the character and/or hearing the voice it's just a stab in the dark, but of the fair few characters they introduced in the trailer this is the only one that fits the bill."
starwarsrebels,332i67,HalcyonWind,3,Sun Apr 19 01:21:12 2015 UTC,Pretty sure 1 and 3 are the same.  The hat's long tip is just a perspective thing.  Neither of the first two screen's angles provide the ability to see how far back it goes.

starwarsrebels,3326an,turntrout101,5,Sat Apr 18 20:18:39 2015 UTC,"You have a point.  It was pretty nicely lined up, and the fact that one of the shots was framed to show that it was lined up indicates that it is a definite possibility.  Vader in the OT was arrogant enough (i.e. Re: Luke ""He's just a boy.  Obi Wan can no longer help him."")  that you could probably get away with a trick like that once by the skin of your teeth.  If you have mind to pull a trick like that.  If Vader has been an enforcer swatting down the remnants of the Jedi Order, my guess is that this is Tuesday for him even though it will be an exceptional encounter for the Lothal rebels.  Incidentally, it is reasonable to assume that those Jedi remnants that he's dealt with before were ""classically trained"" at the Temple and therefore, in a way, predictable.  Because he is not classically trained, Ezra might be able to pull one on him.  Once."
starwarsrebels,3326an,LionFox,5,Sun Apr 19 03:18:46 2015 UTC,"I think Vader would block the blaster shot, but would have to lower his grip, allowing Ezra to force jump away - which we've seen Ezra is very proficient at. The trailer overall shows us that Ezra is improving his skills and powers very quickly - I think Ezra will be better than Kanan by Season 3."
starwarsrebels,3326an,JarJarBinks590,3,Sun Apr 19 21:00:26 2015 UTC,"Regardless of what happens, I expect to hear an ""impressive"" from Vader after it happens."
starwarsrebels,3326an,bluestaples,1 point,Sun Apr 19 14:55:11 2015 UTC,"That wouldn't work very well.   Vader has a good hold on him and would so easily block that measly attack.    This would probably enhance his ""big bad guy"" feel    Story-wise that would be a terrible decision. Having Vader get caught off guard so easily by a Padawan of a Padawan after killing so many Jedi would be a terrible decision.   I predict someone will intervene, be in Kanan or Ahsoka."
starwarsrebels,3326an,Pingonaut,4,Sat Apr 18 21:00:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, because the fact that it's a blaster/saber combo. It's a thing that would work on Vader once. Plus, Vader underestimating threats is a consistent weakness for that character."
starwarsrebels,3326an,HenryChinaskiForPrez,2,Sat Apr 18 23:11:54 2015 UTC,"This is what I'm talking about, vader is an unstoppable juggernaut compared to Ezra but a cheap unexpected trick might work just once."
starwarsrebels,3326an,Sea_horse_,3,Sun Apr 19 02:42:52 2015 UTC,i think its too obvious not to happen while vader is moving the saber he rotates and elevates it into a perfect firing position.

starwarsrebels,3326an,triarii3,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:23:38 2015 UTC,the force doesnt just control Ezra's arms. Ezra will have no control of his fingers to switch to gun mode. he has to concentrate all his mental powers to resist vader's force control.  ezra will either have to break that force control from vader completely or someone will have to interfere.   again this is all speculation right here. it could even be Chopper ramming vader with wrench to distract him.  more events will come to light when the show starts.

starwarsrebels,32w2tv,CommanderVisor,4,Sun Apr 19 02:12:43 2015 UTC,A new look for Sabine next season?  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CCwTosuVAAETpLP.jpg
starwarsrebels,32w2tv,thatoneguy889,2,Sat Apr 18 09:47:58 2015 UTC,So I showed up to the queue 3 1/2 hours before it was supposed to start and was told the room was already at capacity.
starwarsrebels,32w2tv,thatoneguy889,2,Sat Apr 18 21:22:10 2015 UTC,That's pretty nuts. Was that also the same panel showing the first 2 eps?
starwarsrebels,32w2tv,datix,2,Sat Apr 18 21:37:42 2015 UTC,They're separate panels. The screening is the one I'm referring to.
starwarsrebels,32w2tv,datix,2,Sat Apr 18 21:52:50 2015 UTC,"We showed up at 2:05pm (Screening is at 5) and are about 15 people from the front of the ""overflow room."" Apparently if enough press/other people bail we get in, but not guaranteed. The Force is strong with Rebels."
starwarsrebels,32w2tv,FilipinoPhil,2,Sat Apr 18 23:11:59 2015 UTC,"You should have joined the ""overflow"" room. We were told that same thing and they ended up fitting all of the overflow in (about 200 people). I don't know why they were so conservative and telling people it was a long shot for overflow."
starwarsrebels,32w2tv,WanderingWindward,1 point,Sun Apr 19 02:22:35 2015 UTC,There were a fuckton of seats reserved for media and VIPs. When it turned out that they weren't going to show up they opened them up to the overflow queue.
starwarsrebels,32w2tv,WanderingWindward,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:24:21 2015 UTC,"For real? I was turned away 3 hours before it started. Nobody even said there was an overflow room, I totally would have waited.  Ugh, this screening was such a massive SNAFU"
starwarsrebels,32w2tv,mathemon,2,Mon Apr 20 21:29:13 2015 UTC,"I'm so upset! I didn't get in to the season 2 premiere!  Apparently the line was at max by noon, I didn't realize people could line up that soon."
starwarsrebels,32w2tv,WanderingWindward,1 point,Sun Apr 19 00:52:05 2015 UTC,Me neither. It was this event that made me realize there's no limit to the waiting people will do for new Star Wars. I will never underestimate it again.
starwarsrebels,32w2tv,co_rinn,1 point,Mon Apr 20 21:20:22 2015 UTC,"The other big convention I do every year doesn't allow people to line up that early. If a line starts forming, they will walk through and chase everyone off. And then when they do open up the line, they'll purposefully open it in a spot so that the front of the not-line doesn't get in first.  Like, they do everything they can to prevent people queuing up too early.  It never occurred to me that Celebration wouldn't do something simular."
starwarsrebels,32w2tv,Mr_Chance,1 point,Mon Apr 20 21:35:20 2015 UTC,Awesome! I'm hoping to get into the two panels they're having on Saturday.
starwarsrebels,32sc90,xophib1,9,Thu Apr 16 09:10:29 2015 UTC,"I think it will be considering Netflix and Disney announced a deal last year. But I have no Idea when. My guess is later this year maybe, But I can't remember for sure if the Deal starts this year."
starwarsrebels,32sc90,linusnc,9,Thu Apr 16 11:54:42 2015 UTC,"Considering Marvel has the same relationship with Disney as Lucasfilm does, and a lot of Marvel stuff has popped up on Netflix, I say there is a good chance."
starwarsrebels,32sc90,WhoahCanada,3,Thu Apr 16 14:19:07 2015 UTC,"I would guess yes, probably before the S2 premiere."
starwarsrebels,32sc90,rex_dart_eskimo_spy,3,Thu Apr 16 14:20:47 2015 UTC,I know that's when CW's shows are released on Netflix is about a month or so before the new seasons start.
starwarsrebels,32sc90,raknor88,1 point,Thu Apr 16 23:27:54 2015 UTC,Im guessing close to the movie release
starwarsrebels,32sc90,LeDuc725,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:39:09 2015 UTC,"~1 month before S2 starts, very common with Netflix, sometimes it can be the same week as the next season starts for some shows, annoyingly."
starwarsrebels,32rxu0,CommanderVisor,12,Thu Apr 16 05:47:26 2015 UTC,"Season 2 is going to be analogous to Empire Strikes Back. So I think the Empire will make a strike back against the rebel cells. I think the rebels will suffer some defeats in season 2.   Because the Inquisitor is dead, the Empire is aware of the Lothal rebels. So there's going to be a bounty on them. Bounty hunters are going to come back in season 2 I believe. So we might see Boba Fett or Cad Bane.   Lothal is going to be a dangerous place, because Vader is there. So some bad things might happen to our Lothal rebel cell. There might even be a death from the hands of Vader. Maybe Kanan or Ahsoka might fall to Vader in this season.   I would really like for our rebel cell to visit other planets. Like Mandalore and Onderon. Maybe Lux is leading the Onderon rebels and Bo Katan is leading the Mandalore rebels. I also would like our rebels to visit Alderaan and Coruscant. We never saw what was going on in Coruscant during Imperial rule in the movies. It would be interesting to see Alderaan just to know what was going on there before it got destroyed in Episode 4."
starwarsrebels,32rxu0,curio03,9,Thu Apr 16 06:20:15 2015 UTC,"I think the show will take some dark turns in season 2. Ahsoka will probably get involved with Ezra's training and I think through her guidance both Kanan and Ezra will get more powerful.   Ahsoka and Vader's destiny are intrinsically connected, and when Vader finds out Ahsoka is leading a rebellion against the Emperor he's going to be PISSED.  In a lot of ways Ahsoka is an even bigger threat to Darth Vader than Luke was because Ahsoka actually knew Anakin before he turned. She knows that there is still good in him, much like Luke did, but the difference is that Ahsoka is a massive link to Vader's Jedi past which is a very real threat to his allegiance to the Sith. Ahsoka has the power to weaken Vader by using his love and attachment for her against him.   In my opinion Vader doesn't truly become Vader until he destroys all links to his Jedi past and Ahsoka is the biggest representation of that. It's unavoidable, because any other alternative would be a let down honestly. Ahsoka deserves a proper hero's death, a sacrifice for the greater good and her death would serve as the last step to Vader becoming the dark lord we all know and love."
starwarsrebels,32rxu0,fallopian_pancake,2,Thu Apr 16 09:13:37 2015 UTC,"I think Vader letting Ahsoka live is an alternative that would be far better than killing her off.  I see Darth Vader as a sort of Empire's Erwin Rommel: he's a nazi, he's a genocide, he's the enemy in every sense, but he has codes of honor, and he can have respect for his adversaries. Ahsoka Tano is not a Jedi. And is someone who always understood Anakin, and Vader is Anakin. I don't like the whole double-personality approach on Vader. And I totally see Anakin/Vader's secret being safe in Ahsoka.  Why? Just wishing, but I think it could be GREAT TV writing if they took a Nolanish Harvey Dent approach with Anakin Skywalker's story. The Rebellion is just being born and they probably need figures of hope, and who better than the Hero with no Fear of the old Republic? The valiant jedi who officially died defending their flag? I want to know what the Rebels think or know of Anakin Skywalker.  I totally see Ahsoka keeping the truth for herself, even having found out for years, and even telling this to Vader: I won't speak. And I see Vader letting her go since she wouldn't represent a threat to himself but the Palpatine's Empire. And this wouldn't certainly diminish him one inch as a villain, but it could consolidate him as the AntiHero we know he is."
starwarsrebels,32rxu0,Mithrandir77,1 point,Sun Apr 19 03:59:03 2015 UTC,"I can definitely see what you mean with the Vader double personality thing. It does feel cheap, and I think that's why the youngling thing in ROTS doesn't work well, even though I fucking love that movie.   What you're saying all makes total sense but here's my problem with having Ahsoka live on through the OT:  -she wouldn't turn her back on Anakin, and she would even outright confront him as much as she could until he turned back to the good side.  -Vader knows that Ahsoka would be a continuing threat to his power and dedication to the darkside, and she would feel a never-ending personal vendetta to reawaken Anakin, much like Luke did. She would even die trying to convince Anakin to turn away from the dark side, again just like Luke.   there is nothing more heroic than self-sacrifice and Ahsoka deserves that kind of death. That's what defines a real hero in my opinion. Remember that the death of a Jedi is not always a bad thing, and certain Jedi are known for that kind of thing ;)   -Darth Vader, despite being good deep down, still does evil things even if he regrets it later. He has killed hundreds of Jedi in cold blood, including younglings. Maybe if Vader ends Ahsoka's life we will see  a moment of regret and anger come out of him, beginning his path to eventually saving Luke."
starwarsrebels,32rxu0,fallopian_pancake,1 point,Sun Apr 19 09:43:40 2015 UTC,"While I agree that self-sacrifice is the kind of death she deserves, she doesn't have to die. I think that out of lineality, they will kill her. But having her live all througout the saga up to the force awakens would have been good.  Ahsoka being the main source of information for Luke about his father's past and glory is an excellent plot device to tie the three trilogies and not having to appeal to Anakin's-always-polemic force ghost.  Besides, we don't know if this Ahsoka is the old Clone Wars Ahsoka. I believe we will see a rather gray character, with no filliation. I don't see her recurrently trying to bring Anakin back.  But again, the focus of my post was how the rebel alliance approaches anakin's figure. And how does Anakin react to this. And what is Ahsoka's role in this, because you can even imply for the trailer that she knows who is behind the mask."
starwarsrebels,32rxu0,Mithrandir77,1 point,Sun Apr 19 15:00:03 2015 UTC,Would Ahsoka even know that Darth Vader is Anakin? I can imagine a scenario where Vader reveals himself to be Anakin right before killing her or something like that.
starwarsrebels,32rxu0,Space_Dorito,0,Fri Apr 17 14:52:32 2015 UTC,... yes... love. That felt so out of place in that last sentence XD
starwarsrebels,32rxu0,pufferpig,0,Thu Apr 16 11:49:47 2015 UTC,"I hope the show takes some darker turns, i know there will be atleast one, Freddie teased one on a podcast not long ago. I personally think Kanan will die this season, or Ahsoka, those two are my top choices for death. Ahsoka being the obvious one with Vader,we have all been waiting for it, and it will be amazing. Now Kanan is less likely but i think it would make for some good TV, with Kanan dead we could see Ezra grow into a leadership role and him learning force powers on his his own or with Ahsoka, i'm gonna assume that Kanan would be killed by a new Inquisitor or Vader either one i'm fine with. But it's doubtful to think Kanan will die, i just personally want him too, i love the character and Freddie but it would make for some great TV."
starwarsrebels,32rxu0,Jason-G169,2,Thu Apr 16 19:39:44 2015 UTC,"Expanding on other ideas, i can see the ghost crew on the run from the empire, when they get attacked and captured by everyone's favorite pirate: Hondo who might try to sell them to the empire.  The empire could just decide to kill the lot of them and the Hondo pirates might have to let the rebels free to escape."
starwarsrebels,32ld14,hyperlancer,3,Tue Apr 14 18:41:46 2015 UTC,"The announcement does not mention Rebels specifically, but this quote gives me hope.   highlights and more than 30 hours of exclusive video content from Star Wars Celebration Anaheim will be officially live streamed to a worldwide community of fans on StarWars.com"
starwarsrebels,32ld14,RealVoltar,5,Tue Apr 14 18:43:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know that things like the premier and w/e clips of E7 they've got will make it to the stream.  From watching old panels on Youtube, they seem to want content to be limited to the people there.  We'll definitely get the panels though and that's all I was hoping to get from Youtube before this announcement."
starwarsrebels,32ld14,fallopian_pancake,-5,Wed Apr 15 05:28:50 2015 UTC,What the hell's the point of the livestream then?
starwarsrebels,32ld14,RealVoltar,3,Wed Apr 15 09:07:27 2015 UTC,The stuff that isn't a 2-minute trailer.
starwarsrebels,32ld14,fallopian_pancake,-3,Wed Apr 15 13:30:04 2015 UTC,What a giant waste of resources that would be.
starwarsrebels,32ld14,gamerslyratchet,3,Wed Apr 15 21:03:01 2015 UTC,"We'll probably see a sneak peek or trailer of season two, but not the whole episode."
starwarsrebels,32ld14,sageleader,2,Wed Apr 15 08:27:35 2015 UTC,It is confirmed to NOT be streaming today. Check out Star wars.com to see the schedule they posted. Sorry everyone!

starwarsrebels,32ld14,BlueSmoke95,1 point,Thu Apr 16 01:28:22 2015 UTC,"Possibly.  I remember reading that the first episode of Season 2 will air in April, but that is at Celebration.  The actual season may not start until later in the year.  I would expect it to be over the summer, or starting in autumn, as a way to keep hype up for Episode 7."

starwarsrebels,32lr5x,Red5iveStandingBy,4,Tue Apr 14 21:01:45 2015 UTC,"In the context of the thread I get that but I can't stop thinking, ""Friggin say it, Skywalker.  Your sister has it,"" while watching."
starwarsrebels,32lr5x,RealVoltar,4,Wed Apr 15 05:47:07 2015 UTC,"if your serious this isn't right. The only thing able to make Vader good or merciful was Luke, that's what this needs. He needs to savagely cut Ahsoka down, or they could fight once and he be about to kill her when he hesitates just for a second and swings down just as she escapes then fight again and he kills her.   As for her discovering his identity I think it should happen and she should escape before she fights him again. Because that way we better see the grief she will be going through. Also does she even know Obi-Wan is alive?"
starwarsrebels,32lr5x,mrpiggywinkles52,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:31:29 2015 UTC,Im pretty sure this isnt serious... because well you should know for ehrm obvious reasons. :)
starwarsrebels,32lr5x,Schadenfreudenous,-2,Tue Apr 14 22:03:07 2015 UTC,She should know Obi-Wan is alive - they're both active members of the rebellion.
starwarsrebels,32lr5x,RealVoltar,5,Wed Apr 15 00:41:38 2015 UTC,Obi Wan's talking to dead people on Tatooine.  Idk that he's actively doing anything for the RA beyond looking after Luke.
starwarsrebels,32lr5x,Schadenfreudenous,1 point,Wed Apr 15 05:45:06 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming he's at least keeping in touch - there's probably plenty he can still teach others, and drinking in seedy bars would keep him informed enough to give information.  EDIT: and since Bail and Leia know where he is, it's likely they've had SOME form of communication."
starwarsrebels,32lr5x,RealVoltar,2,Wed Apr 15 14:13:36 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking that Dave was pretty careful with Yoda and it would be interesting to see how they go with it.  Leia makes it sound like, ""Hey, remember that one time in the Clone Wars?"" but Leia's been known to say interesting things too."
starwarsrebels,32lr5x,mrpiggywinkles52,2,Wed Apr 15 16:09:00 2015 UTC,Since when? Did I miss something? The holocron was done by Obi Wan In ROTS as far as we know.Obi is training to be a force ghost and watching over Luke on tatooine
starwarsrebels,32lr5x,Schadenfreudenous,0,Wed Apr 15 07:23:50 2015 UTC,"Leia seems to know all about Obi-Wan, I'd assume they've met before - at least over hologram. Bail Organa 100% knows he's alive, and also knows exactly where he is(well, the planet, at least). I'd say there's a pretty good chance that he would have told Ahsoka, since she's bound to be a leading member of the rebellion like he is."
starwarsrebels,32lr5x,mrpiggywinkles52,5,Wed Apr 15 14:12:25 2015 UTC,"I always assumed Bail just told her if she ever got In trouble to contact him. Or he told her just before she left for the plans. Or even she just heard stories of him from her dad and took the opportunity to get in contact with him. They don't have to have met. Leias address to him ""years ago you served my father in the clone wars"" doesn't sound like something you'd say to someone you'd met before. And she used his full name instead of just calling him Obi Wan which makes me think they never met.   Bail knows but that doesn't mean Leia actually met him. If he is part of the rebellion I'm sure he told Ahsoka. But we havent much of a reason to believe he is?"
starwarsrebels,32lr5x,Schadenfreudenous,1 point,Wed Apr 15 14:32:56 2015 UTC,"You have a point, but I'd just find it extremely unlikely that he did absolutely nothing to help them out for 20 years. Yeah, protecting Luke is important, but couldn't he at least keep in contact?  I'm sure Ahsoka at least knows he's alive - Bail would have told her if there was another Jedi around.  EDIT: Sadly, The Force Unleashed is no longer canon, but when it was, it established that Obi-Wan was around helping out - he projected his physical image over a droid body. So, still on Tatooine, but using the force to visit important meetings."
starwarsrebels,32lr5x,mrpiggywinkles52,3,Wed Apr 15 15:05:06 2015 UTC,"I think overall it's a good thing TFU isn't canon but I do like the idea of Obi Wan being involved in the rebellion more, not going too far from tatooine but I love that idea."
starwarsrebels,32lr5x,ZTHerper,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:09:27 2015 UTC,"I don't remember that, are you referring to Proxy? That was just an ""Obi-wan model"", one of the many fighting style programs used to train Starkiller."
starwarsrebels,32lr5x,CommanderVisor,2,Sun Apr 19 15:05:51 2015 UTC,I'm getting really tired of these Luke-esque parodies.
starwarsrebels,32lr5x,Fourteen_of_Twelve,2,Tue Apr 14 21:52:13 2015 UTC,... No.
starwarsrebels,32lr5x,RealVoltar,1 point,Tue Apr 14 23:52:37 2015 UTC,"All jokiness aside, I wouldn't be surprised if there was some kind of foreshadowing of Vader's redemption.  I also wouldn't be surprised if Luke wasn't the first person Vader used to try to overthrow the Emperor either.  I think I heard that Anakin really built up a resentment for Ahsoka though prior to going darkside anyway so I'm not sure that he would be amiable to recruiting her."
starwarsrebels,32lr5x,5aucy,1 point,Wed Apr 15 05:43:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she'll very likely try to turn him."
starwarsrebels,32l0c6,deweysizemore,1 point,Tue Apr 14 17:12:26 2015 UTC,There's a new trailer soon?
starwarsrebels,32l0c6,tonuchi,1 point,Tue Apr 14 17:59:13 2015 UTC,Hopefully this weekend at Celebration!
starwarsrebels,32mvbb,Schadenfreudenous,3,Wed Apr 15 01:38:24 2015 UTC,"Well, for starters the two shows have a different art style. Beyond that, though, Ahsoka is over 15 years older than she was the last time we saw her - do you look the same as you did 15 years ago? I don't. Her eyes are the still bright blue. I don't even know what you mean when you say the light sabers have no glow. I'm looking at an episode right now, and there's plenty of glow. The light sabers look better, IMO. They've tried to recapture the way light sabers originally looked, and I think they've done a great job."
starwarsrebels,32mvbb,cyborgSnuSnu,0,Wed Apr 15 02:46:03 2015 UTC,"I'd agree the art style would have something to do with the facial differences, but not the others. There was no need to change her eye color(they're now a very dark blue, instead of a light blue), or the pattern on her headtails (they look like lightning bolts now, it's sort of cheesy). The lightsabers I could understand. I really like the flowing motions they now have - that was missing in TCW - but the extra thin-ness that was added still bothers me. It's mainly coming from TFA teaser, but it seems to be slightly present in the show."
starwarsrebels,32mvbb,cyborgSnuSnu,3,Wed Apr 15 03:04:32 2015 UTC,"The color of her eyes from one show to the other look essentially the same to me. http://i.imgur.com/fX0JROL.jpg vs. http://i.imgur.com/HVccNPI.jpg. I think the changes in pattern for her horns and headtails can be explained as easily by the art style as facial features. Perhaps as they elongated, the patterns distorted somewhat. There were differences in the patterns when she saw her ""future self"" on Mortis, though not to the same degree."
starwarsrebels,32mvbb,cyborgSnuSnu,0,Wed Apr 15 03:44:03 2015 UTC,"Her future self on Mortis had round patterns, just like her younger self did - only difference was a slight point in the center of each one. They just look a little too extreme now - it's distracting."
starwarsrebels,32mvbb,BlueSmoke95,2,Wed Apr 15 14:16:36 2015 UTC,"As I said, ""though not to the same degree."" My point was that aging can alter their appearance. Combined with the different art style, the difference is not inexplicable."
starwarsrebels,32mvbb,RealVoltar,2,Wed Apr 15 16:15:11 2015 UTC,"Unless I am mistaken, we only see the Great-Saber in the teaser.  That one is long, but not really all that thin.  It also has a killer flame effect on the blade."
starwarsrebels,32mvbb,Waldorf_,3,Wed Apr 15 03:25:39 2015 UTC,"She's 15 years older and show has a significantly different art style.  Like TCW Ahsoka, this one has a little Eckstein face in it.  She's also a few year older.  The only thing that bothered me at first was her hat...which I didn't realize was a hat at first...then her head didn't look as odd to me after I realized that."
starwarsrebels,32mvbb,Waldorf_,2,Wed Apr 15 05:24:16 2015 UTC,I don't think Ahsoka's anatomy allows her to wear a hat. Do you mean her headdress?
starwarsrebels,32mvbb,Waldorf_,2,Wed Apr 15 14:15:12 2015 UTC,"The thing that gets me the most is the pattern changes, I didn't know her species did that.. Unless they're just trying to distance themselves as far from TCW as they can get, but still use the same characters?"
starwarsrebels,32mvbb,Sapitoelgato,3,Wed Apr 15 03:05:43 2015 UTC,"The wiki says that Togruta headtail patterns may change color slightly when they experienced extreme emotions (anger, embarrassment, love, etc) - which would have been cool if put in TCW (too much effort to animate, maybe?), but the actual pattern on the headtails shouldn't change.  It's the only thing that truly bothers me, really."
starwarsrebels,3235zj,Xelossian,23,Fri Apr 10 05:01:22 2015 UTC,"I assume it was because the trip was so short, and the cockpit is airtight."
starwarsrebels,3235zj,Karriz,32,Fri Apr 10 12:54:22 2015 UTC,"It's plot convenience and armoring that allows them to survive, plus explain how a standard TIE could hold three people. Some viewers decided to make it their headcanon that The Inquisitor's TIE had a built in life support after an off-screen upgrade, while the rebel's stolen TIE also had modifications. Whatever floats your boat."
starwarsrebels,3235zj,Fourteen_of_Twelve,8,Fri Apr 10 05:14:22 2015 UTC,I find your lack of faith disturbing
starwarsrebels,3235zj,YodasMaster6,14,Fri Apr 10 20:23:32 2015 UTC,Maybe in the new canon they do have life support and the helmets/oxygen are used similar to Air Force pilot when they are in high speed maneuvers and use oxygen.
starwarsrebels,3235zj,smokey_sunrise,5,Fri Apr 10 05:28:22 2015 UTC,They still lack Oxygen according to one of the new novels.
starwarsrebels,3235zj,Tuskin38,14,Fri Apr 10 19:30:42 2015 UTC,There was enough air for them to operate until they got docked. Any longer then they would run into higher levels of CO2 and hypoxia.
starwarsrebels,3235zj,nighthawke75,7,Fri Apr 10 09:55:59 2015 UTC,Same reason why those 4 other Star Destroyers didn't open fire on the rebel ships at the end.. plot device.
starwarsrebels,3235zj,Lumberj,4,Fri Apr 10 14:16:04 2015 UTC,Or why an Imperial Star Destroyer was inside Lothal's atmosphere in the first episode. It's the little details like that that bug me the most.
starwarsrebels,3235zj,eawhite,4,Fri Apr 10 14:45:17 2015 UTC,"Agree, but I stopped letting little things like that bug me.  I just go along for the ride and try to enjoy myself.  It's much more fun this way.  :)"
starwarsrebels,3235zj,Lumberj,0,Fri Apr 10 15:07:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so far they haven't done anything really big, story-wise, that would drive me crazy, unlike TCW."
starwarsrebels,3235zj,eawhite,2,Fri Apr 10 15:42:39 2015 UTC,What's it like letting such little details bother you? Do you get to even enjoy anything? I imagine it must  be terrible.
starwarsrebels,3235zj,BurningBushJr,6,Fri Apr 10 22:11:32 2015 UTC,Star destroyers can go in atmosphere. Basically all ships up to a SSD can.
starwarsrebels,3235zj,roninjedi,2,Fri Apr 10 15:35:41 2015 UTC,"Victory-class Star Destroyers could enter the upper atmosphere of a planet but the larger Star Destroyers could not. Of course, this is all from the EU, so I guess it's a moot point."
starwarsrebels,3235zj,eawhite,3,Fri Apr 10 15:40:37 2015 UTC,I was sure the ISD could though I think it was only ever shown on the trading cards and like one book. Not to mention issards SSD that made it off coruscant
starwarsrebels,3235zj,roninjedi,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:48:03 2015 UTC,"This was one of those things we were all sure of in the 90s but never knew the source for. All my nerd friends thought ISDs could enter atmosphere, but only VSDs could actually land."
starwarsrebels,3235zj,mdp300,1 point,Fri Apr 10 17:51:25 2015 UTC,"It's possible I missed something, but from my recollection, an ISD could not enter an atmosphere. And the Lusankya had a repulsorlift cradle that helped it reach space. Oh well, it is a minor thing after all."
starwarsrebels,3235zj,eawhite,2,Fri Apr 10 16:13:37 2015 UTC,now that you mention it the lusankya did have a cradle. I remember them talking about how when it broke away it caused more damage on the city. But yeah ohh well. Its one of the more minor things they have changed and something that im actually not that upset about.
starwarsrebels,3235zj,roninjedi,0,Fri Apr 10 16:21:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it annoyed me at first, but like you said, it's a minor change. Sometimes I just get hung up on the little things."
starwarsrebels,3235zj,eawhite,3,Fri Apr 10 16:25:16 2015 UTC,I was super happy in Tarken when they mentioned Yaga-minor and some other ship yards. It felt like the author was trying to work as much of the old stuff in as he could.
starwarsrebels,3235zj,roninjedi,2,Fri Apr 10 16:31:01 2015 UTC,"I got this off the wiki for the imperial class   Like most other Star Destroyer models, the Imperial-class was capable of entering atmospheres and supporting ground operations directly"
starwarsrebels,3235zj,NextArtemis,3,Sat Apr 11 08:34:39 2015 UTC,"Lack of life support != not pressurized.  Only that there's no system to 'scrub' CO2 from the air.  TBH, the ""life support"" system carried by TIE Fighter pilots look really similar to Momsen Lungs, hence, a rebreather system."
starwarsrebels,3235zj,pepoluan,2,Sat Apr 11 14:35:27 2015 UTC,"Perhaps they're pressurised, they could last a few minutes in it but any longer and they'll run out of air"
starwarsrebels,3235zj,Blackfire853,2,Fri Apr 10 12:53:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if the lack of life support is in the canon, I know that was in the EU, but I don't believe it has been clarified  in canon yet. Either way they were only in it for a short run, easily survivable"

starwarsrebels,3235zj,Tuskin38,1 point,Fri Apr 10 21:06:21 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it will be clarified down the line, but a lack of life support is odd, even for a short range fighter. Though it is established that way in the EU."
starwarsrebels,3235zj,Shadou_Fox,3,Fri Apr 10 21:15:14 2015 UTC,"Saves space, power and money, like the lack of Hyperdrive"

starwarsrebels,3235zj,dimagasa,1 point,Fri Apr 10 14:55:04 2015 UTC,I don't recall TIE fighters life support ever being addressed in any novels or sourcebooks. Is that something recent from the newer books? The thought caught me off guard and I was pretty current on SW media for a long time. (much less the last several years admittedly)
starwarsrebels,3235zj,countjared,1 point,Sat Apr 11 01:46:27 2015 UTC,Apparently TIE fighters have life support and are somewhat roomy.
starwarsrebels,3235zj,El_Ejcovero,0,Sat Apr 18 02:11:36 2015 UTC,I find your lack of faith disturbing
starwarsrebels,31qk6z,thenewstampede,7,Tue Apr 7 11:36:50 2015 UTC,"For the junior novels read Edge of the Galaxy first. I am not a big fan of sports stories, but this one wasn't too bad, and only was in the plot to show Leonis' leadership skills. The author say he channeled Friday Night Flight vibe. There is a good introduction of the characters in here.  Next read Ezra's Gamble  as the story ends close to the show. The story was fun to read, because you have Bossk teaming up, with Ezra due to unforseen circumstances.  Lastly, read Rebel in the Ranks. This is the second out of four Leonis book, and about 74% of the way through the story they get to the episode Breaking Ranks from his perspective. This is the best out of the three, and builds up greatly at the end."
starwarsrebels,31qk6z,Sapitoelgato,7,Tue Apr 7 12:28:11 2015 UTC,"A New Dawn is good, but there's really no ties to the show.  It's just some backstory/world building.  So, I wouldn't consider it ""mandatory,"" but I would recommend it if you are looking for something."
starwarsrebels,31qk6z,5aucy,5,Tue Apr 7 15:02:05 2015 UTC,"Well, funny thing is the prologue in A New Dawn has a higher impact to the overall story of Kanan than the rest of the book. If you read the prologue, then read the Kanan comic, and then start reading the book, it has a better impact. The book was only a ""When Hera met Kanan"" story, so nothing earth shattering happens, but is a good character development."
starwarsrebels,31qk6z,Sapitoelgato,2,Tue Apr 7 18:50:45 2015 UTC,Are the kids books pretty quick reads?
starwarsrebels,31qk6z,ghornett,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:04:43 2015 UTC,Yeah. The average is 160 pages.
starwarsrebels,31qk6z,Sapitoelgato,2,Tue Apr 7 19:37:42 2015 UTC,"Idk that there's any crucial materials out now though the Zare stuff does give insight into season 2's direction.  I liked A New Dawn which follows all the tropes of JJM's other books (I still liked Kenobi more) but doesn't give any special insight into the show (that I can tell at this point).  There's actually reason to assume that the upcoming book, Lords of the Sith will have relevant backstory for Hera but not much more than that is known.  The Last Padawan is definitely impressing me so far."
starwarsrebels,31qk6z,RealVoltar,2,Thu Apr 9 05:48:25 2015 UTC,I'm excited about The Last Padawan. I ordered it and it's still in the mail :-(
starwarsrebels,31m9g8,Chap82,17,Mon Apr 6 11:38:43 2015 UTC,Not every black person is related. Not every white person is related. Not every human is related.
starwarsrebels,31m9g8,CommanderVisor,8,Mon Apr 6 15:38:04 2015 UTC,space is pretty big
starwarsrebels,31m9g8,MordorsFinest,2,Mon Apr 6 16:31:33 2015 UTC,Technically I think we're all at least 16th cousins or something.
starwarsrebels,31m9g8,RealVoltar,-4,Tue Apr 7 06:35:47 2015 UTC,"But you can't deny legacy is a big theme within the Star Wars movies Jango Fett and Boba Fett, Anakin Skywalker and Luke Skywalker, Obi Wan and Qui Gon plus the Sith rule of two  I'm not saying everyone is related but if this theme that has been in all the Star Wars movies why wouldn't it be in the new?"
starwarsrebels,31m9g8,CommanderVisor,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:04:09 2015 UTC,"Because the general audience that just watches the movies and doesn't care about supporting materials such as the shows and books wouldn't know who Zare is.  For example, in the Marvel movies, does the average moviegoer know who Cosmo the Space Dog is? There's a black Spidey? Not unless they read the comics or heard from another source."
starwarsrebels,31m9g8,RealVoltar,4,Mon Apr 6 23:52:03 2015 UTC,"That's a ridiculous argument.  If you put a dude in the movie, then the general audience will know who he is.  No secret knowledge is required."
starwarsrebels,31m9g8,CommanderVisor,1 point,Tue Apr 7 06:37:36 2015 UTC,"Ok yeah, looking back right now, that's a terrible argument. I don't really remember what I was thinking of at the time either. I meant that the name ""Zare Leonis"" wouldn't mean anything to people who don't watch SWR and he would just be known as Finn's daddy-o. Anyway, if Zare's his dad, then that would make any tension with Zare in the show zero, because then we would know that he survives through it all.  The point is that it would be terrible storytelling if they did that. If Sabine is the daughter of Satine, then that would be forced, because the only similarities they have are their Mandolorian heritage, similar names, and it makes NO SENSE since one is white and the other is Asian, among other things."
starwarsrebels,31m9g8,RealVoltar,2,Tue Apr 7 20:24:04 2015 UTC,That I 100% agree with.
starwarsrebels,31m9g8,ReboZooty,4,Wed Apr 8 02:38:16 2015 UTC,but where did we get that information from?   http://www.starwars.com/films/star-wars-the-force-awakens-digital-trading-cards
starwarsrebels,31m9g8,RealVoltar,-2,Mon Apr 6 12:34:39 2015 UTC,"Oh thank you, I'm guessing that was a marketing slip?"
starwarsrebels,31m9g8,TotesMessenger,3,Mon Apr 6 21:04:48 2015 UTC,"The only reason I like the idea would be that Abrams isn't trying to make Star Wars by ignoring Star Wars which is what I kind of expect that he's doing.  Without knowing more about Zare it's really hard to make the connection beyond, ""sympathetic stormtrooper,"" or, ""black guy,"" or w/e connection may or may not be there.  I think we'll definitely be getting some Arkanis next season though and SMG may be playing Dhara."

starwarsrebels,3169pe,RealVoltar,4,Thu Apr 2 09:11:46 2015 UTC,"Some interesting insights from Freddie Prinze Jr. on characters, concepts and the force on the Coffee With Kenobi podcast.  I think I actually linked to the current episode instead of this specific episode.  If so, it's episode 91."
starwarsrebels,3169pe,NoCleverNickname,5,Thu Apr 2 09:13:58 2015 UTC,"Well, that was actually ridiculously entertaining and enlightening!  Freddie Prinze Junior is probably the biggest surprise to me about Rebels.  I'm a guy in my mid 30's, so the only time he had any real exposure up to this point, in my mind, was the late 90s and early 00s.  At which point, he was in a number of very bad looking movies aimed at teenage girls.  Not my demographic at all.  Now when I heard that Disney was doing an animated Star Wars show mainly aimed at kids, I assumed that the characters would be so lame they'd make Jar Jar look like Shaft.  And then I heard that FPJ was cast, I thought, oh, that washed up has-been.  Well, the fact that I'm here talking about it means I obviously dig the show.  I loved Freddie's performance as Kanan,  It's certainly raised my perception of the guy.  It's an interesting character, basically a cowboy Jedi with no master, and the dude owned that role.  And hearing Freddie talk about it at length was really fun.  It's obvious that he's put a lot of thought into it.  The fact that he can go on about the Force, Bruce Lee, elements of storytelling, and all these other cultural, spiritual, and philosophical touchstones really make me like him as an actor and a person.  I was definitely wrong about the guy, and I'd love to be able to hang out and just talk about anything with him.  /u/RealVoltar, thanks for sharing that."
starwarsrebels,3169pe,polyphenus,4,Thu Apr 2 16:07:38 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest. I, too, gave the show a quick pass based solely on the character art and what seemed to be an obvious cash-in set between trilogies. I am not a fan of the prequels or The Clone Wars so I was sure I'd skip this, as well.  After watching the premiere episode with my son, I was instantly hooked. The show is a great call-back to the original trilogy and makes the transition between trilogies pretty seamless. I really like the humor and the characters, not to mention the great voice work. There are enough nods and Easter eggs to make even the most die-hard Star Wars fan (well, at least me) do a double take.  I was totally surprised when I learned that FPJ did the voice of Kanan. His voice sounds mature and he speaks with an authority that rivals that of any Jedi who came before his character. After watching the Scooby Doo movies, I can attest to FPJ making some clunkers after his brief fame in the last 15 years.  After finishing the season, I am very excited for all things Star Wars once again. Season 2 and Episode VII can't get here soon enough!"
starwarsrebels,3169pe,Sapitoelgato,2,Fri Apr 3 14:03:53 2015 UTC,"Have you read Kanan The Last Padawan yet? The first issue came out on Wednesday, and is the best of the new comics. It starts with Depa and her Padawan on a mission to take back a planet from Separatists."
starwarsrebels,3169pe,Jason-G169,2,Fri Apr 3 22:46:59 2015 UTC,Idk if it's still the juice from the finale or not but I'm liking that one a little more than the Vader series now just from one issue.  It's a shame we're only getting 5 more from Weisman.
starwarsrebels,3169pe,RodianFace,3,Sat Apr 4 01:59:32 2015 UTC,"I appreciate that.  Yeah, in the same way I see Dave as the apprentice George, I'm seeing Prinze and Witwer as the next Hamills; at least as far as they're curious about the lore and really inhabit the characters.  I thought this was a helpful interview because he's surprisingly candid about a lot of shit in season 2 without really spoiling anything. It gives expectations realistic focus and mad teased some interesting sub plots."
starwarsrebels,3153dj,lamagawa,20,Thu Apr 2 01:39:45 2015 UTC,"I thought it was pretty good tbh, especially the ending. Them all joking around by the fire and then the transmission from Palpatine, my heart sunk when he said to go through with order 66. All in all i liked it alot."
starwarsrebels,3153dj,Jason-G169,10,Thu Apr 2 03:48:32 2015 UTC,I think it is cool to see how easily the Clones went from joking with a jedi to trying to slaughter the guy they just shared a laugh with two minutes ago.
starwarsrebels,3153dj,Brookslangford,9,Thu Apr 2 06:39:11 2015 UTC,"I always felt bad for the clones.  With those chips in their heads I don't think they knew what they were doing.  In the Clone Wars, one clone has his chip activated early by malfunction.  He killed a Jedi and before he died talked about how he was being freed from a living nightmare.  That sucks..."
starwarsrebels,3153dj,Damonstration,8,Thu Apr 2 20:50:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that dramatic change of atmosphere was really effective I thought, too.  I like the cliff-hanger where you simultaneously do and don't know exactly what's going to happen."
starwarsrebels,3153dj,RealVoltar,10,Thu Apr 2 06:41:43 2015 UTC,"I like the dialogue, it flows pretty well. The relationship between Kanan, his master, and his clone officers gets established fairly quickly as well. The art is really good. Nothing much happens yet in the first issue but I think shit will hit the fan in the next one. The Kanan here is consistent with the prologue Kanan in A New Dawn, which I like."
starwarsrebels,3153dj,Sapitoelgato,12,Thu Apr 2 01:57:52 2015 UTC,"Super exciting read. The best out of all the new comics so far. I just hope they can keep the momentum all the way through. I was hoping for more back story to Depa, but I guess they sidestepped her novel Shatterpoint. I have it still on my list to read. I am curious to see how much present scenes we will get. I think I understand what Freddy Prince Junior meant, when he answered about season two of Rebels:  F:  What can I tell you about his future … Without getting force choked by Filoni from afar … At the end of season one Kanan will know what it means to be a Jedi. The selflessness necessary to be considered a master. Season 2 he learns how to let go. You’ll learn his pain, in detail, in a scene Dave and I recorded in private. Kanan breaks down and gives you everything you’ve been wondering (unless you get the comics but you don’t get to hear me lose my $@&! Without watching)  So from what I can gather is that the ""present"" day story will unfold as the comic goes forward, or it will unfold in season 2, when their is an episode arc involving that planet. Either way that would be awesome to see. You would get to know what he remembers by reading the comic, and see his visual reaction to going back. At least I hope it plays out that way. Plus, I hope we get to see older versions of some of the new alien characters returning.  Link to the article:  http://www.yodasnews.com/10-questions-freddie-prinze-jr/"
starwarsrebels,3153dj,Razmosis,3,Thu Apr 2 02:22:30 2015 UTC,"I really liked this one. Loved the art. I was thinking though, do you guys think when Kleeve said ""we were told she was unstable"" (referring to depa) it was a small reference to the ""shatterpoint"" novel?   Spoilers below if you guys haven't read the book  I read that book years ago but if I remember correctly wasn't Depa in some kind twisted mental state? She was acting strangely or something and mace went to haruun kal to investigate what happened to Depa? She ended up in like a comatose state by the end of that book or something too I think.... What do you guys think?   Looking forward to future issues!"
starwarsrebels,3153dj,Mandolph_Rantooth,5,Fri Apr 3 05:02:32 2015 UTC,"The thing is, that reference doesn't mean the whole backstory has been brought into canon. They could have just kept that aspect of her character in some form. I think that's going to be problematic canon-wise from now on. Writers will slip in some EU reference and folks will assume (not saying you were) that means that the whole source referred to is canon now."
starwarsrebels,3153dj,Sapitoelgato,3,Fri Apr 3 12:09:39 2015 UTC,"They side stepped Shatterpoint, with that comment, and Caleb making a reference as well.  Caleb: Then a few months ago. Master Depa Billaba emerged from-- Well, whatever it is she emerged from.  I am super curious to find out if they will release a story that explains how she became no longer comatose, or what they will do.  I do want to say that after rereading A New Dawn's prologue that I am starting to see the pieces come together of the all canon between mediums. The prologue had a bigger impact this time, and I want more..."
starwarsrebels,3153dj,RealVoltar,6,Fri Apr 3 12:48:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've been favoring the Vader comic so far until today.  I really like that they're giving the Shatterpoint fans a little something (though honestly I think the one issue of the comic made her a more interesting character than E1 and Shatterpoint combined).  Suddenly after a few lines of dialogue, Billaba's one of my favorite masters?  WTF just happened there?"
starwarsrebels,3153dj,Sapitoelgato,3,Thu Apr 2 06:46:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I felt it was an odd choice originally, when it was discovered that his master was Depa, but they have knocked it out the park, with the prologue in A New Dawn and this comic."

starwarsrebels,3153dj,feartherex,2,Thu Apr 2 23:12:22 2015 UTC,I enjoyed it. The cliffhanger was good. It's going to be interesting to see how Caleb and Billaba react to Order 66.
starwarsrebels,3153dj,klaxterran,2,Fri Apr 3 13:56:41 2015 UTC,"Just read this yesterday and really loved it. Between A New Dawn and Rebels already giving us a lot of Kanan, I didn't go into this comic overly excited or anything, so I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The relationship between Kanan and Depa starts off well, the clone banter was great, and the Order 66 cliffhanger was a really dramatic change in tone. Can't wait for the next one."

starwarsrebels,30gjdk,NoCleverNickname,13,Fri Mar 27 14:07:45 2015 UTC,"A good question is, what does the Jedi Order even mean post Order 66? Luke was never part of the old Jedi Order. Yes he was briefly trained by Obi-wan and Yoda, but he was never a member of the Order. Also, the Jedi Order did not always exist either. So looking at it this way, Kanan, Ahsoka, and Luke are not technically Jedi. I'll admit, adding in Kanan, Ezra, and now Ahsoka being alive... it just makes the whole Luke being the last of the Jedi a bit confusing. Unless of course they are all killed before the events of Episode IV. That would be the only way to make Yoda's words clear. You could argue that Yoda just didn't know of any others alive, but if Yoda could seek out and talk to Kanan/Ezra from Dagobah to Lothal through the Force... well I'm sure you get the idea.  Something else that is confusing to me and has never made sense, is why confronting and defeating Vader is what will make Luke a true Jedi Knight. Luke has barely any knowledge of what it means to be a Jedi. Heck, they didn't even teach him the Jedi Code! Isn't that Jedi Training 101? They form the building blocks of how a Jedi is suppose to live their life? Instead, Yoda and Obi-wan only taught Luke what was necessary to defeat Vader, nothing else. I don't think this was the original intent, just a result of how Star Wars has evolved since A New Hope released."
starwarsrebels,30gjdk,boomkinburger,12,Fri Mar 27 10:38:12 2015 UTC,"Something else that is confusing to me and has never made sense, is why confronting and defeating Vader is what will make Luke a true Jedi Knight.   To defeat Vader Luke had to resist his fears, the temptation of the dark side and overcome the conflict of ""father-son"" relationship. So Luke needed to confront Vader in order to find peace within himself. It was the ultimate test that decided what his future was going to be like.  At least that is how I see it."
starwarsrebels,30gjdk,Yerome,3,Fri Mar 27 12:41:22 2015 UTC,"Isn't it explicitly stated by Yoda that this is the case?  He says Luke has nothing more to learn, but that in order to be a true Jedi he must face Vader (not necessarily defeat him, I might add.) Once he does this, he needs to pass on what he learns.  If he managed to lose his confrontation with Vader, he still could have escaped and expanded the Jedi Order through teaching Leia, Ezra, and whom ever else pops up.  Unrelated side note: Kanan and Asoka could theoretically still be alive, and would only need to pass their trials to become Jedi considering their extensive experience. They'd be pretty old by this point though. Pure speculation is that they just don't make it to see Luke start the new Jedi Order. If she does, I don't see Asoka becoming a Jedi regardless."
starwarsrebels,30gjdk,lolzycakes,1 point,Sat Mar 28 17:16:45 2015 UTC,"The way i look at it is like this: Luke is the last of the Jedi because he is dubbed a Jedi knight by the grand master (Yoda). Once he passes the test, he is a full Jedi knight. Their are certainly flaws in my theory but i like to think of it that way. You could also state that because of this; if Kanan, Ezra and Ashoka wished to be part of the new order, Luke would be the one to allow them to become Jedi again.   Unless during the events of episode IV they're on aldeeran."
starwarsrebels,30gjdk,dante_barton,9,Tue Mar 31 23:46:56 2015 UTC,"I think Yoda and Obi-Wan intentionally didn't teach Luke the code, leaving him to start a New Jedi Order from scratch.  If we learned one thing from the prequels and TCW, it's that many Jedi and the Jedi order itself were very flawed.  Ahsoka's leaving the Jedi order exposed some of that.  It could even be argued that the Jedi Order created Darth Vader.  If they had allowed Jedi to have attachments and welcomed Anakin and Padme, would he have been pushed down that same path?  You could even say that the reason the Jedi failed to prevent Palpatine's rise was because they alienated Anakin, giving Palpatine leverage to turn him.  Those are some REALLY cool concepts to explore in new canon, especially since those are the exact types of decisions Luke will be faced with as he starts a new order."
starwarsrebels,30gjdk,5aucy,6,Fri Mar 27 21:05:10 2015 UTC,"Interesting, and well-put.  Basically, Obi-Wan and Yoda were the 'last' of the Old Jedi Order. They tried to mold Luke at the very least to be able to face -- and defeat -- Vader. But deep inside, I do think they understand that the Old Jedi Order dies with their deaths.  And even though Obi-Wan and Yoda continued to 'exist' as Force Ghost, Anakin also continued to exist, and as Luke's father, would have the perfect viewpoint on the flaws of the Old Jedi Order.  Nice thoughts, thanks for sharing!  (And yeah, I'm very excited with New Canon.)"
starwarsrebels,30gjdk,pepoluan,9,Sun Mar 29 21:09:14 2015 UTC,"I see this a couple of ways when I try to consider canon.  First, characters are flawed and are allowed to be wrong.  Obi-Wan and Yoda have no idea what they're talking about.  Tarkin also said that all the Jedi were dead, but Obi-Wan (and Yoda's reveal in the next movie) proves him wrong.  The official Jedi order has fallen and any surviving Jedi are in hiding, so Obi-Wan and Yoda have no way of even knowing.  Odds are Ahsoka and Kanan are not the only surviving Jedi/quasi-Jedi.  Second, after reading ""Heir to the Jedi,"" written from Luke's perspective between ANH and ESB, he is focusing on learning how to be a Jedi without any teachers, but that means that (eventually), he'll also have to recreate the Jedi order without any guidance (sure, maybe the opinion of some force ghosts).  The events of the prequels clearly demonstrate that the old Jedi order was very flawed.  It's self righteousness and subservience to the government had rendered them blind and was eventually their undoing.  So, it brings into question ""what is a Jedi?""  In the prequels (and before), the Jedi were very hierarchical.  Younglings were found and trained until they were accepted as Padawans, until they could pass the trials, where they would become Jedi, and eventually (maybe), they'd become a Jedi Master.  Is someone a Jedi if they learn to use and master The Force and serve the light side, but don't subscribe to the ""Jedi order?""  Just like any religion.  Do you have to be a member of a certain house of worship in order to be considered a part of that religion?  What if you are Catholic, but stuck on a desert island and cannot attend Mass, participate in Communion, or go to Confession.  Can you still call yourself a Catholic?  Anyway, I think/hope a lot of the new canon is going to explore that.  What makes someone a Jedi?  How clear are the lines between the light side/dark side?  Do the Jedi only serve the ""good"" side government?  tl/dr: There's a lot of potential in exploring the concept of Jedi separate from the Jedi Order and Rebellion/Republic."
starwarsrebels,30gjdk,5aucy,7,Fri Mar 27 15:26:33 2015 UTC,"I tend to see it as: None of Ahsoka, Kanan, or Ezra will be Jedi Knights as defined by The Jedi Order.  But they are still Jedi. Quasi-Jedi, if you prefer.  EU was full of quasi-Jedi. Two significant examples: Corellian Jedi and Gray Jedi. They are totally Jedi in their force-alignment... but the Jedi Order considered them heretics. (And with great hypocrisy... Corellian Jedi were known to come to the aid of Jedi Order when the latter was in great distress, only to be shunned and even branded heretics when the danger had passed)."
starwarsrebels,30gjdk,pepoluan,7,Fri Mar 27 11:07:03 2015 UTC,"I see Ashoka as a grey Jedi for her use of dark and light side attacks, the whole force grab and choke thing isn't a light side attack in my book, and she's good at that.  But outside of the formal structure, if in our world Rome fell, and the papacy ended, then there would be no more priests, nuns, monks, etc., but there would still be Catholics.  Anyway, Kanan identified his fear, and then confronted it, the fear of losing his padawan.  In his fight against the inquisitor I feel he passed the test to be a Knight.  With Ashoka, she had a literal trial, which she also passed.  I feel that earned her the rank of Knight, more so because she had tue strength to leave.  Ezra made the cut to be called Jedi as a padawan, and earned his light saber.  Ultimately the force is working through everyone, and the ranks and titles are constructs around the natural progression of Jedi.  Its between the force and the individual to pass those trials, and the council merely rubber stamped those outcomes."
starwarsrebels,30gjdk,thesynod,4,Fri Mar 27 15:04:11 2015 UTC,"That's a good point about Kanan's fight against the Inquisitor being his trial.  And I believe that Mace Windu called Ahsoka's quest to prove her innocence to be her ""Great Trial.""  However, I feel like even though they both may have the skills, power, and compassion of a jedi, since there isn't a true jedi order, they aren't included in Yoda's comment."
starwarsrebels,30gjdk,HecticEpic,7,Fri Mar 27 17:15:53 2015 UTC,"I have a couple interpretations that I think are possible.  One is that Luke is the last Jedi in the sense that he is the last one left powerful enough to defeat Vader and restore light to the galaxy.  In the Clone Wars finale, Yoda is shown that the way back to the light is through the next Skywalker, Luke.    Yes, Ahsoka, Kanan, and Ezra are force sensitive, and Luke doesn't go through any real formal Jedi training either, but only Luke has the potential to become such a powerful Jedi that he can defeat Vader.  That's what separates him from the other quasi-Jedi.  Alternatively, Luke may be seen as the last Jedi due to the fact that only he is really malleable.  Ahsoka eventually rejects the Jedi Order.  Kanan never finishes his training, and at this point is not naive enough to truly adhere to the strict Jedi code.  Ezra, learning from Kanan, will never be able to truly fulfill the values of the Jedi Order.  Luke, begins his training with Obi-Wan, and learns of the Force through only Obi-Wan and Yoda.  They are the sole influences on Luke's training as a Jedi, and thus can effectively mold his mind to follow what they see as the path of the true Jedi, and to them, only the truest of Jedi is able to defeat Vader and bring back the light.  I lean towards the second of the explanations.  We have seen that neither Yoda nor Obi-Wan are above manipulating others for what they see as the greater good, and it makes sense from their point of view that they see their Jedi ways as the true ways to run the galaxy.    But that's just my two cents."
starwarsrebels,30gjdk,hyperlancer,6,Sat Mar 28 02:28:24 2015 UTC,"I honestly can't see them killing off all three characters. I know people hate the argument, but it just wouldn't feel right for a Disney show. I absolutely think that Kanan will die and will be the first to go, but I think Ezra may go into some weird self-imposed exile where's he's slightly overtaken by the dark side and removes himself from the people he doesn't want to hurt. After years of torment he may once again make an appearance (maybe in the new movies?). As for Ahsoka, I haven't really made a prediction yet, but I don't think she's safe."
starwarsrebels,30gjdk,thesynod,4,Fri Mar 27 13:15:25 2015 UTC,"Outside of the many Bothans who died, we really don't know the behind the scenes of how Leia got those stolen data tapes except a transmission was beamed to Tantive IV.  Maybe that mission is where the whole story ends, until we see a grown up Ezra in Episode VII?"
starwarsrebels,30gjdk,ddrober2003,4,Fri Mar 27 15:07:32 2015 UTC,"Is it too much to hope for a defecting Stormtrooper by the name of Kyle Katarn who feels a ""connection"" to the Ghost crew to be involved in this multi-episode series finale plot? Or I mean, it could be a season finale and have the series run parallel to A New Hope and the other movies in the OT but at different locations. I could live with that too."

starwarsrebels,30gjdk,RealVoltar,2,Wed Apr 15 01:11:39 2015 UTC,I think you're safe to assume that there's more to being a jedi than just being a force-sensitive nice guy.  I think they're relatively explicitly saying that Ahsoka's not a jedi anymore either.  We've actually already seen other force-sensitive traditions with the Nightsisters and those Howard-the-Duck people that love Jar Jar and hate jedi.  It's not unreasonable to assume that Kanan and Ezra may find their own path.

Dave said something about organizing the seasons like the OT movies so consider us at that E4 point and all the good stuff that could be written right now would spoil some E5 and E6 stuff.

FPJr in the Rebels Reactions #91 mentioned that these two will get their backstory filled in in S2.  So, probably not until they wrap up the storyline for S2 will we see more novels in the Dark Times (i.e., between ROTS/Order 66 and ANH)."

starwarsrebels,306vsm,MasterMac94,-7,Fri Mar 27 17:18:00 2015 UTC,I feel like the Inquisitor's last words may have some ramifications for episode 7
starwarsrebels,306vsm,countjared,7,Wed Mar 25 06:55:58 2015 UTC,I think they're intended to be foreshadowing for season 2.
starwarsrebels,306vsm,aatencio91,2,Wed Mar 25 22:01:50 2015 UTC,I think they were foreshadowing the appearance of a certain someone at the end of the episode

starwarsrebels,306vsm,aatencio91,4,Wed Mar 25 23:22:09 2015 UTC,"It might've also meant that not just that certain person will be on their ass now, but a more larger (but not too large) part of the Empire will be too."
starwarsrebels,3084as,tdpriest71,7,Wed Mar 25 05:57:52 2015 UTC,"I think it'll be a familiar face. I don't think that they'll show up until maybe the midseason finale.   Barriss Offee (although if anything, she's the anarchist to the Empire's fascism, so she could be a neutral, but then that's too many force users in the show imo?) Jerek (Maybe to imply that later on that Kyle Katarn and his story will happen in the Disneyverse?) I'm tired, so idr any others.   It doesn't have to be an Inquisitor, though... * Mara Jade. Maybe age her up by a year, like Sabine's age. She doesn't have to be named ""Mara Jade"" or the exact same character. If they rename her, then I feel that people will be less likely to complain, because the character =/= MJ, so the writers can take creative liberties and have less negative reception from the EU fans. This might just be me, though. Maybe the Emperor sends her to Lothal to watch over Lothal's garrison on a stealth mission? If she stays incognito, like she's some red-haired technician in the background acting strangely, like throwing glances as if she's eavesdropping. Then she can keep her eye on people like Kallus or Tua and take them out if they 'misbehave'. She could also try and ninja Kanan or Ezra (idk how skilled she is, honestly, but she must be really good to be the/an Emperor's Hand)"
starwarsrebels,3084as,CommanderVisor,5,Wed Mar 25 06:25:37 2015 UTC,"I still see good things for Kallus.  He's bright and ruthless enough for Tarkin to almost console him in that last scene (Not to worry, Agent Kallus).  In the same way I can't unsee the chiss concept art of Kallus and think he may be a canon reimagined Thrawn in the future, There's a canon character who was abducted off to Inquisitor school whose first name rhymes with Mara.  I'm most certainly not saying, I'm just saying."
starwarsrebels,3084as,RealVoltar,5,Wed Mar 25 15:48:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the Inquisitor tended to fail through his inability to make use of his resources or value those under him, insisting on leaping into every fight alone and treating his troopers like worthless canon fodder. His arrogance is why he fucked up.  Kallus would always make full of use of the stormtroopers under his command and often got very close to victory only to have it snatched away by circumstances beyond his control. He's the more capable of the two, even if he's not as nightmare-inducing."
starwarsrebels,3084as,GodotIsWaiting4U,3,Thu Mar 26 23:45:39 2015 UTC,"Yup, exactly what I was thinking.  I hope Kallus gets proper assets, since he implied that he only had local ones and according to Ezra's Gamble, there were a few ISB agents (lower ranked probably) stationed on Lothal prior to the series."
starwarsrebels,3084as,CommanderVisor,2,Fri Mar 27 00:29:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they better not kill him. He has potential.  Clara? Nara? Jara? We'll probably see Dhara on Arkanis."

starwarsrebels,3084as,Revangeance,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:15:24 2015 UTC,Making a character exactly like Mara Jade and renaming her makes zero sense. What do you really accomplish with that? A more likely scenario is if they use the name and her character is altered
starwarsrebels,3084as,fallopian_pancake,1 point,Mon Apr 13 03:14:04 2015 UTC,"I meant that there would obviously be changes to the character. Imo, if they made a character similar to MJ, but retained the name, then a bunch of EU fans would complain (""they ruined mj with rebels stupid"" or whatever).  If they changed her name, then the complaints would be a little less, I mean it'd still be there... like it would allow for creative liberties for the writers with the possibility of a little less backlash from EU fans.  Idk, idk how EU fans would react, whatever. I don't care, but it's just a theory."
starwarsrebels,3084as,CommanderVisor,1 point,Mon Apr 13 04:10:21 2015 UTC,"If they got rid of the name and altered her character that would make her an entirely different character.... A name is a thousand more times recognizeable than the red hair and purple blade. If fans saw a character with the trademark MJ look and her name wasn't MJ that's when they'd go nuts.  The problem with Mara Jade is thing that makes her cool is her character arc which is going from a badass hard nosed jedi hunter to finding enlightenment/love/power with Luke Skywalker. She was an essential part of Luke's journey to becoming a Jedi master. Anything less than that and she's not Mara Jade.  There's rumors that another animated TV show may happen that takes place after ROTJ and serves as the final part of the ""trilogy of tv shows"" that are Clone Wars, Rebels, and the (probably Filoni-directed) third show that bridges the gap between ROTJ and TFA.   I however believe this probably won't happen and the rumored live action X-wing (or tie fighter?) tv show similar in budget and production design with battlestar galactica (lol I know VERY ironic) will tell the story in between ROTJ and TFA instead of a third Filoni animated show."

It'd be sooooo cool if somewhere in the new trilogy someone like Rey asks Luke if he ever married and he replied with something like ""Mara was a good wife... and a good Jedi. Anyways, we should get on with your training."" and eventually it turns out Rey is not a Solo but actually a Skywalker who was adopted by the Solos after Luke disappeared. Luke could then be the one to say ""Han and Leia are not your parents, no...I am your father"""

starwarsrebels,3084as,CommanderVisor,3,Tue Apr 14 00:57:20 2015 UTC,Vader is not way too big. Grand moff Tarkin way overshadows Vader interms of position. Yet he's here catching a small band of rebels?
starwarsrebels,3084as,triarii3,4,Wed Mar 25 13:50:47 2015 UTC,"I'm saying in the sense of hunting the rebels like kallus or the inquisitor. Vader is now in like more of a command position like Tarkin is, instead of his old jedi slayer self 15 years prior"
starwarsrebels,3084as,RealVoltar,3,Thu Mar 26 06:13:22 2015 UTC,I think Vader was brought in more as a counterbalance to the Rebel Alliance showing up than as a replacement for the Inquisitor.  I'm thinking we'll probably get a Vader or a Tarkin or both in episodes with heavier RA involvement.  My guess is SMG is playing the replacement for the Inquisitor.  I'll go further out on a limb and suggest Dhara Leonis as a possible role.  You could speculate on Legends overtones in that character too if you want but at some point it may not be wise.
starwarsrebels,3084as,GoldenRy007,7,Wed Mar 25 15:33:01 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the Inquisitor will return in season 2 with robot legs and fight the Jedi with his brother.
starwarsrebels,3084as,boomkinburger,2,Wed Mar 25 22:25:17 2015 UTC,"It just makes me wonder what the point of bringing Darth Vader in at all was if he isn't going to be the next bad guy for Season 2, other than for gaining viewers on the finale because oh sh** Vader! I'd have to have had that happen just for him to do next to nothing in the next season. What I'm expecting, though, is for us to have a new antagonist, maybe Kallus trying to redeem his failure, while Vader is going to play the role of the roaming Nemesis in Resident Evil 3. He'll be the overall villain but there is nothing you can do except GTFO as fast as you can and hope you live to talk about it.."
starwarsrebels,3084as,mojave955,6,Wed Mar 25 09:35:16 2015 UTC,"I presume they'll be on the run from Vader throughout good portion of next season (setback after setback for the Rebels and continuous victory for the empire) until they make a dramatic stand in the finale or something.  Or, rebels could score multiple major victories and it turns out to be an elaborate trap set by Vader and they fall right into it in the finale."

His spinning dual-lightsabre will likely be built into his arm/hand.  His return will be marked with the stolen advanced Tie fighter (his fighter) going missing.  Barriss will likely show up in Season 2 as a new Inquisitor. Vader will call her into action after learning about Ahsoka's involvement with the rebels. Ahsoka will have to deal with Barriss before she eventually comes face to face with Vader.  We're also going to see the Rebels set up a huge HQ on Dantooine.  The easiest way to end this series would be to put them all on Alderaan right before the Death Star destroys it.  The rebels are having some kind of hopeful meeting on Alderaan (probably learning that the plans for the Death Star have successfully been stolen), look to the sky, and see the Death Star.

starwarsrebels,3084as,dbutlerjr,1 point,Mon Mar 30 15:49:51 2015 UTC,"Bringing him back was sort of an interesting idea but they really should have resolved his story in TCW or, at least, in SOD.

If not... get creative people... I liked it though. I just wish it was longer. However, I couldn't help but wonder how in the world Kanan did not realize Ezra was alive and safe. I mean... he was right there! And how was he not able to sense him? I dunno. I might be over thinking it. Regardless it was the best episode to date."
starwarsrebels,2zziwh,boomkinburger,7,Mon Mar 23 15:05:34 2015 UTC,"However, I couldn't help but wonder how in the world Kanan did not realize Ezra was alive and safe. I mean... he was right there! And how was he not able to sense him?   Practical reason for story telling purposes - It adds drama to the scene and propels Kanan past his fears, pushing him into the state of mind needed to win the fight.  In-universe, Star Wars reason - Since Kanan was only a padawan when Order 66 happened, his training and focus in the Force aren't as strong as they probably should be.  I imagine all his focus was on combat, and not reaching out in the Force to sense for others' presence(s).  For that matter, if he had been trying to do just that (sense others) earlier, he would've known the Inquisitor was waiting behind that door to fight them to begin with.  And yes, definitely the best episode so far.  I totally love this show."
starwarsrebels,2zziwh,NoCleverNickname,3,Mon Mar 23 19:30:33 2015 UTC,"That does actually make some sense. He was being trained during a time when combat skills were likely more desired than the focus and sense type abilities- at least some jedi masters may have seen it that way.  And then, I guess his training was abruptly ended."
starwarsrebels,2zziwh,rsixidor,1 point,Tue Mar 24 13:47:06 2015 UTC,"Well, Ezra's not moving / unconscious. I think that dims his ""Force signature"" to the level Kanan detected of Luminara in ""Rise of the Old Masters"". Hence: dead.  Also, Ezra's head was tilted to one side. For all Kanan knew, Ezra might have snapped his neck hitting the lower walkway. Hence: dead."

I think Kanan most certainly knows who Ahsoka is. You're correct about Ahsoka having been a high-profile Jedi.  Kanan and Ahsoka probably will have a talk or two, with Ahsoka giving him advice and helping out with Ezra a couple of times. Kind of like how back in the early episodes of TCW, there was usually a Jedi of the week they teamed up with, like when they were stranded on a remote planet, Anakin was injured and Aayla was there for Ahsoka. I think something along the line will happen with Ahsoka and Ezra."

He is only about 3 years younger than Ahsoka, so they likely would have been at the temple at the same time. Anakin and Obi-Wan (and we know that Kanan and Kenobi interacted) were famous within the order, as was Ahsoka. Even if he somehow didn't know her personally, it's difficult to imagine that he wouldn't have at least known of her."

starwarsrebels,2zyvz4,pufferpig,4,Mon Mar 23 02:14:05 2015 UTC,"This! I want this so bad!  I'm really excited to find out how much the two of them know about order 66... I'm halfway through ""A New Dawn"", so I don't know if Kanan touches upon where he was when his Master fell, and if he managed to flee the temple itself or if he managed to flee because he simply wasn't at the temple. (e.g. less Clones to worry about, since the majority of them was sent to the temple)  on that note... I just watched the ""temple march"" scene again, and it shot trough me how many of the Jedi etc we got to know on Clone Wars who died there... so many faces flashing before my eyes :/  and what happened to the temple workers? There were alot of non-droid workers at the temple as well (seen in the Ahsoka Arc episode, where a technician is suspected terrorist and so on). I guess they were ""acceptable losses"""
starwarsrebels,2zyvz4,stomlino,3,Mon Mar 23 14:02:12 2015 UTC,Those temple workers must've just been told look they're the bad guys we're taking care of it. At this point with them introducing Vader and Ahsoka for season 2 they HAVE to tackle that subject of how much does everyone know and eventually come to Ahsoka and Vader confronting each other. Pretty much what the season 1 finale did was introduce Rebels as being Clone Wars Part 2 where everyone's questions will be answered and the show is about to get beyond intense. Unfortunately we know that not every episode will be as intense as we want just like in Clone Wars but the episodes that touch the subject of connecting back to Order 66 and Ahsoka/Vader will be pretty much everything a Star Wars fan is looking for

Dentist appointments = run to ""Outland"" (big geek/comic book store) and stock up on recent Star Wars books/comics ;D  I could always buy the single issues flimsy paper comics online (I guess they're flimsy), and get them sent in the mail. but I'd rather collect the bound/book issues, seeing as they're probably a lot more durable (and judging by the state of the  30 or so years worth of Donald Duck comics that my family has amassed over 2-3 generations, I'd say it's a wise move)"

I think Kanan didn't say anything when Ahsoka came down the ladder because he couldn't believe he was actually seeing her.  Here, right in front of him, was a great warrior from the Clone Wars.

starwarsrebels,2zyvz4,mjsmith1223,1 point,Mon Mar 30 15:14:29 2015 UTC,"Right.  Everyone would have known who Obi Wan was.  He was a prominent Jedi and hero of the Clone Wars.  However, as Obi Wan was showing the younglings how the temple communication gear worked, a young Kanan piped up with a question about how if the communication gear can call Jedi to the temple, can it also warn them away?  Obi Wan was impressed with this youngling thinking outside the box a little and took some time after ""class"" to speak with Kanan individually.  Kanan most assuredly knew who Obi Wan was and maybe even knew him a little beyond what everyone knew from the holonets.  I'm hoping the comic series will address how Kanan came to be in possession of a holicron with Obi Wan's message on it."
starwarsrebels,2zyvz4,RealVoltar,3,Mon Mar 30 17:42:57 2015 UTC,I think he doesn't know her based on vague memories from a FPJ interview but I'd really be surprised if the name didn't ring a bell with him.

starwarsrebels,2zyvz4,PrimordialDragon,2,Mon Mar 23 19:09:17 2015 UTC,Well she was probably pretty well-known among the jedi due to her accusation and some of her exploits so maybe he does know her.Or maybe he just recognizes how she looks but not her name
starwarsrebels,2zyvz4,mastersword130,1 point,Tue Mar 24 17:42:39 2015 UTC,"Probably, probably not. By the time he was a padawan she already left the order and order 66 and being on the run for a decade would probably put her out of his mind."

starwarsrebels,2zyd6q,CommanderVisor,10,Tue Mar 24 02:42:56 2015 UTC,"I agree. I also believe that Ahsoka won't last into the second season. Maybe she might, but I feel there is potential for an incredible season finale. Imagine, if you will, Vader and Ahsoka clash maybe three times. The first time, Vader recognises her, she does not (she only knows of this Lord Vader, not who he is), causes major damage to the group, but they flee. Vader ponders on their interaction, and conjures a plan to bring the non-Jedi to the dark side. The second clash has them duel again, but this time, Vader manages to get one on one with Ahsoka. Parallels with the ESB duel with Luke are felt here. He reveals himself, surprises Ahsoka, and she is near defeat. He tempts her with the dark side, reminding her of the way she left the Jedi Order. She is very close, but she is reminded of her new friends and what she has been fighting for, rejects him, and manages to flee (perhaps rescued by the crew). This frustrates Vader, and hopes to try one more time. The final time (the finale, I presume) they meet, he'd give off his classic ""you will join us, or die,"" and when Ahsoka rejects a final time, Vader is fuelled with hatred, and engulfed with the dark side. I feel like she sacrifices herself to save the group. I try to imagine how she dies, but the best way I can imagine is for Vader to disarm her and come in with a stab. This way, he is up close, sees her reaction, and Ahsoka can give an amazing line or small dialogue with Vader with her dying breath. Something that would really make Vader think about what has happened, but ultimately fully embracing the dark side. I think that'd be an interesting way of them interacting."
starwarsrebels,2zyd6q,CommanderVisor,13,Tue Mar 24 19:13:46 2015 UTC,"Ahsoka is only gonna be a major recurring character and if they had some big reveal moment, then it might take away the spotlight from the Ghost crew. I mean, I like Ahsoka and all, but I'm considering the possibility that she might not know who Vader is and NEVER will, or at least onscreen. Think about it.  Or maybe she recognizes something about Vader, but Vader refuses to acknowledge anything and says nothing, and Ahsoka makes her getaway while still wondering what that was. Vader's pretty sour about his past. Imo, I don't think he will treat Ahsoka the same as Luke.   Maybe his encounter(s) with Ahsoka also have some influence on how he treats Luke too, like Ahsoka ends up dead when she gets cornered or something in another area nearby and Vader's not fast enough to tell them to not shoot, but it's too late. Vader's like ""Never again..."", but of course, the contrary happens.  Yeah yeah, bullshit I know, but hey."
starwarsrebels,2zyd6q,CommanderVisor,3,Sun Mar 22 23:56:59 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying, so do you think she knows?"

I really can't wait to see how Vader will treat her, as of right now she's probably the closest to him. Maybe more than Obi Wan just because of the nature of their last encounter. And I wonder if she'll feel any guilt toward what happened, Anakin's fall to the dark might have been very different if she were there"
starwarsrebels,2zyd6q,Whatsheordered,7,Mon Mar 23 00:12:41 2015 UTC,"But remember, in the same scene when she finds out in person, it's very likely that she will die too."

starwarsrebels,2zyd6q,TeutonJon78,2,Mon Mar 23 05:38:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't want her to die either. It would feel like a waste :( I wonder if she would just let Anakin go or try to redeem him (obviously this would end badly in so many ways.)."
starwarsrebels,2zyd6q,MadMan2012,2,Mon Mar 23 05:48:14 2015 UTC,"I mean we all agree that Vader would totally wreck Ahsoka right?  Like she has no shot in hell, she never even became a knight if iirc.  And the same way Ob-Wan was able to beat his pupil, Vader would do so as well. If Vader goes easy on Ashoka at all, I would say that it breaks the character and importance of Luke."
starwarsrebels,2zyd6q,shikhargpt,2,Mon Mar 23 15:33:47 2015 UTC,She earned the rank of a Knight in TCW at the very end of s5. Mace says she passed her trials and if she stays in the order she would be a knight.
starwarsrebels,2zyd6q,metallicabmc,1 point,Tue Mar 24 07:30:20 2015 UTC,"I would love it if she found out and had to ponder it for awhile. If they want to throw another Obi-Wan cameo into the show, I think this is the perfect way to do it. Realizing that Ahsoka is confused and distraught by the reveal, Bail has sympathy and trusts her with Obi-Wan's location, and she makes a lone trip to Tatooine to confirm the truth.  It sounds cool in my head at least."
starwarsrebels,2zyd6q,triarii3,2,Fri Mar 27 20:09:49 2015 UTC,"Remember that the TCW takes place between Ep 2 and 3. So, there was a lot more time for Anakin to be back around Obi-Wan before their final showdown. I'd have to guess he was closer to Obi-Wan over all."
starwarsrebels,2zyd6q,metallicabmc,2,Mon Mar 23 00:29:35 2015 UTC,I figured it might be a last second realization for her. Like right before Vader brings his lightsaber down on her he calls her Snips. It would push how far Anakin had fallen and reinforce the redemption that Luke gives him.
starwarsrebels,2zyd6q,Rogue-3,4,Mon Mar 23 11:51:18 2015 UTC,Bail knows.
starwarsrebels,2zyd6q,GodotIsWaiting4U,4,Mon Mar 23 09:00:45 2015 UTC,"Im pretty sure Bail knows exactly who Vader really is. Yoda and Obi Wan certainly told him. Whats not clear is if Bail knows that Vader is still alive because as far as he knew. Obi Wan had killed him on Mustafar.  In the old non canon EU. Bail loses his shit immediately when he overhears a clone trooper say ""The emperor is waiting for you Lord Vader"" to a mysterious black masked figure.   He probably knows though since he is a senator and probably has had a few meetings/run ins with him already."
starwarsrebels,2zyd6q,rsixidor,1 point,Mon Mar 23 09:10:42 2015 UTC,Well i dont think in the films we saw Yoda or Obi Wan speaking to Bail about Anakin being vader.   So officially does Bail know? nope.  Does it make sense that Yoda would tell Bail about Anakin? Nope. This is to protect the identity of Leia.
starwarsrebels,2zyd6q,CommanderVisor,3,Mon Mar 23 16:28:21 2015 UTC,"It makes perfect sense that he would tell them.    None of them knew Padme was pregnant until the end of the film. Bail had already been helping Yoda and Kenobi out for a while and they could have told him then. (Bail would be questioning what the hell was going on and why Clones were killing Jedi at the temple).  Obi Wan and Yoda assumed Vader was dead. No need for them to keep it a secret.  The scene where Bail, Obi Wan, and Yoda discuss hiding the children so the Sith can't detect their presence. Surely if Bail didnt know that Padme's children were Anakin's he would have questioned why the Sith would be interested in the children of a random senator."

I could see him not recognizing her, too, since it's been 15 years, and only realizing at the last minute during their duel, WHILE striking the killing blow, too late to hold back."
starwarsrebels,2zyd6q,rex_dart_eskimo_spy,3,Thu Mar 26 23:52:56 2015 UTC,I think it's far more interesting if no one knows

starwarsrebels,2zyd6q,Clonetrooperkev,3,Mon Mar 23 05:43:39 2015 UTC,"According to Tarkin, Vader's dislike of Tarkin is a bit obvious, almost certainly because of him just wanting to get the job done back when Ahsoka was framed. IIRC, Tarkin didn't care who bombed it, as long it was a Jedi, since he doesn't like the idea of pacifist warriors as figures of authority in a war as we all know.  I don't know the exact details, since I don't have the book."
starwarsrebels,2zyd6q,CommanderVisor,1 point,Thu Mar 26 18:49:13 2015 UTC,"Hmm that's really interesting, it would be cool to see some sort of disagreements between them over Ahsoka, or Vader almost defending her at some points"
starwarsrebels,2zyd6q,Clonetrooperkev,9,Fri Apr 3 22:03:45 2015 UTC,"Here's my chance to make a prediction.  During their final showdown, or perhaps their only showdown, Vader will remember her and call her ""Snips.""  She'll realize he's Anakin just before he kills her."
starwarsrebels,2zyd6q,CommanderVisor,9,Mon Mar 23 00:41:23 2015 UTC,"Tbh, the thought of hearing Vader say ""Snips."" sounds kinda narmy. But that could be just me."

starwarsrebels,2zyd6q,Clonetrooperkev,3,Mon Mar 23 02:19:02 2015 UTC,"Point taken. However, the people behind Rebels know what they're doing and after SOME events in TCW, I think they know better than that now.   They're well aware about what Vader will do, and they've even said that  Vader will not show her the same mercy he showed Luke. I think they said that in the finale's Rebels Recon? Or a tweet, I don't remember?  Then again, if they still go ahead with ""...Snips."" being a wham line, then it depends on the execution of it. Vader's a sour apple when it comes to his past, though."
starwarsrebels,2zyd6q,GodotIsWaiting4U,4,Mon Mar 23 02:34:44 2015 UTC,"Personally, I've been reminded of this comic recently.   Showing some Vader emotion.  It just has to be simple. Ahsoka dies in front of him. One of his last few friends, in a history filled with pain and sorrow. Snips never wronged him like Obi Wan, or the Emperor, or the Jedi Council, or anyone else. Ahsoka was like Padme, a good friend taken from him.   It would be a very simple, ""Snips."" Something that would be said that no one could hear. Maybe he'd go back to his meditation chamber, sit down, and grieve."

Whether she knows who he is,  is another question."

Yoda and Obi-Wan knew Anakin is now know as Darth Vader. The only gap here is if these two Jedi masters told Bail about Anakin. If yes...then Ahsoka should know Vader is her Anakin. If not..then Ahsoka will have have no idea

starwarsrebels,2zysqt,Pete_Iredale,9,Mon Mar 23 01:40:15 2015 UTC,Ezra used the dark side to make the big one fight the inquisitor. He used his anger and fear.   It’s all about intent. The intent with the small ones was defense but with the large one was attack.
starwarsrebels,2zysqt,DandalfTheWhite,3,Mon Mar 23 02:01:13 2015 UTC,"Yep.  The Inquisitor was goading him on.  Ezra responds first with defiance, then anger, and then fury.  You can see the hate in his eyes when he summons the big beast, or whatever it's called.  Flash back to a previous episode, when Kanan tries to find the other Jedi Master to each Ezra.  A very telling moment to me, was in the first fight between Kanan and the Inquisitor.  The Inquisitor tells Ezra about (paraphrasing) ""another path you can take, the Dark Side.""  Ezra tosses it back saying, ""Never heard of it!""  And the Inquisitor then says to Kanan, ""Have you taught him nothing?""  That last line right there, it gets straight to the core of Kanan's early failures not only as a Jedi, but simply as a man in a protective role.  He's taken this kid aboard as one of his ship's crew, but very reluctantly.  That reluctance is much greater where it concerns Ezra's training in the Force.  At the time, he was so eager to pass him off to another, more experienced Jedi for training.  He was so eager to be relieved of that responsibility, he hadn't taught Ezra even the most basic stuff that a Force user needs to know in order to survive.  To not even give him the most basic, condensed ideas of what the Light Side and the Dark Side are all about?  That's what they'd go over in the very first day of Jedi Life 101.  Flash forward to Ezra summoning the beast.  Despite the Inquisitor pointing out the severe flaws in Kanan's teaching earlier, Kanan apparently still hasn't had the chat with Ezra about not using the Force with hatred and aggression in your heart.  So during battle, Ezra instinctively taps into it.  Thankfully, that whole episode shocked Kanan into realizing that he needed to do one of two things.  Decide whether he could be a worthy teacher, and really get serious with Ezra's training.  Or, stop training him altogether.  Hence, their visit to the Jedi Temple was a necessary task for both of them.  Kanan learned to trust himself and understand his motivations.  And Ezra learned from Yoda that revenge was not the Jedi way."
starwarsrebels,2zysqt,NoCleverNickname,3,Mon Mar 23 19:14:43 2015 UTC,"^  And then it caused Kanan to be worried if he was worthy to be a Jedi, so it lead to Ezra gaining his kyber crystal -> gunsaber."
starwarsrebels,2zysqt,CommanderVisor,5,Mon Mar 23 02:36:51 2015 UTC,"I’m not sure I’d say Kanan was worried about Ezra’s worth but rather his emotional state. The Jedi wouldn’t have kicked a kid out for touching the dark side, they’d try to help them overcome the root causes. I think he worried for his Padawan and not sure how to teach him to move beyond the incident. I imagine that the whole situation made Kanan worry more about his own worth as a master before he thought of Ezra’s potential unworthiness as a Jedi."

starwarsrebels,2zqnqd,omarh14,10,Fri Mar 20 20:52:28 2015 UTC,"Very interesting perspective. Regarding Ahsoka, I think that her biggest impact in the Skywalker Saga is being one of the biggest reasons why we even have Darth Vader. The way that the Jedi Council treated Ahsoka emboldened Anakin's dissatisfaction with the Jedi and eventually led him to become Sith. Anakin is the chosen one and brought balance to the force when he killed Darth Sidious. Luke was important to bringing balance as well but he was not the chosen one and Anakin is the one that really set it all in motion by banging Padme. I love Asohka and her relationship with Anakin during TCW was very enjoyable to watch develop.   Darth Vader was necessary to bring about balance. Darth Vader exists, in my opinion, for two main reasons, or women I should say. Padme and Ahsoka. I predict that Darth Vader must kill his former padawan reluctantly in the presence of Darth Sidious and causes Darth Vader to become susceptible to killing Darth Sidious later on. Anakin is a very complex character and I can't wait to see Darth Vader develop in Rebels.   As far as Ezra, I have no stinking clue. I think Vader will kill Kanan and Hera."
starwarsrebels,2zqnqd,R2-Dtoo,5,Fri Mar 20 21:15:09 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with you that Anakin/Vader is the chosen one who brought balance to the force, its Star Wars 101. However I think Luke and Ahsoka actually set in motion Anakin's redemption and thus bringing back ""The chosen one"" who's role was previously lost to the darkside. Thus without Luke and Ahsoka (assuming she gets killed), balance would've never been brought.  Great points, I feel Ezra's stance on the future of the galaxy will be fleshed out this season."
starwarsrebels,2zqnqd,spron,8,Fri Mar 20 22:06:52 2015 UTC,"Also, I seem to recall Lucas saying ""balance"" isn't light vs. dark but rather always only light, as ""dark"" is a corruption of the force in its natural, balanced state. So. Not equal parts dark and light. Just light."
starwarsrebels,2zqnqd,IAMA_Drunk_Armadillo,3,Sat Mar 21 06:32:07 2015 UTC,"That's not balance though, even if he did say that it was changed in canon by the Clone Wars episode where they find the nexus where the dark and light sides are kept in check by the father, until his son the embodiment of the dark side gained dominance. Also Anakin was meant to take the father's place as mediator between the light and dark side avatars."
starwarsrebels,2zqnqd,spron,4,Sun Mar 22 14:03:51 2015 UTC,"Wasn't the whole ""balance"" thing retconned to literally mean that Anakin was to balance the force manifestations on Mortis? Unless that episode arch was just a big old metaphor and wasn't meant to be seen as actually having taken place."
starwarsrebels,2zqnqd,RealVoltar,3,Sat Mar 21 06:29:46 2015 UTC,"That arc was a big ol' string of metaphors, yes.  I think all three of them experienced it but it wasn't a thing that happened and it's not a place you can go.  It's pretty much all 6 movies in metaphor though; really beautiful take on order 66 in it as far as I'm concerned."
starwarsrebels,2zqnqd,IAMA_Drunk_Armadillo,6,Mon Mar 23 10:28:07 2015 UTC,"Actually if you think about what balance is he brought it when he killed the Jedi, 2 Sith and 2 Jedi remained. What's interesting to me is the name fulcrum which is the pivot point of a lever, implicating she's aware of her role in altering the balance."
starwarsrebels,2zqnqd,Metzky,6,Fri Mar 20 22:34:16 2015 UTC,"I have never really understood that, there were more than 2 Jedi that survived order 66, they hunt down the survivors prior to ANH but I'm sure more than 2 were still alive by the time the movies roll around, we just don't get to see them on the big screen"
starwarsrebels,2zqnqd,Iokuas,3,Sat Mar 21 12:34:48 2015 UTC,"Most of the Jedi who survived Order 66 were either killed off by Vader and the Inquisitors or were not truly Jedi. Ahsoka could survive through to the movies and the statements about Luke being the last remaining Jedi would be true, as she is not actually a Jedi. She left the order even if she advanced her skills on her own enough to be considered a Knight or Master, she is not one. When the dust settles after Order 66 most Jedi left alive turn off their blades, they give up and go into hiding. From there they were either hunted down and killed or were no longer Jedi. By the time of the Emperor's defeat Luke is the torchbearer, he's the only one standing up with a lightsaber in his hand saying ""I am a Jedi."""
starwarsrebels,2zqnqd,IAMA_Drunk_Armadillo,1 point,Sun Mar 22 05:50:08 2015 UTC,"As an organization the Jedi no longer existed, the survivors were either driven into hiding or stopped using the Force. For all intents and purposes, Yoda and Obi-Wan were the only two that maintained a connection to the Force and continued to follow the Jedi philosophy. As of now they are the only two official Jedi in canon. Kanan and Ahsoka were both padawans and never granted the title of Jedi. Same with the inquisitor, while he used the dark side and a red lightsaber he wasn't a Sith since that requires following a specific philosophy. It's really early here so hopefully that makes sense lol"
starwarsrebels,2zqnqd,Mandolph_Rantooth,1 point,Sat Mar 21 13:01:08 2015 UTC,"Listen to the Revenge of the Sith commentary, Lucas is fairly explicit in explaining that the ""balance"" isn't numerical parity, but the destruction of the Sith. Jedi aren't just warriors of light, they balance the light and the dark. The very presence of the Sith is like a cancer on the Force."
starwarsrebels,2zqnqd,IAMA_Drunk_Armadillo,2,Sun Mar 22 12:59:16 2015 UTC,That implies that Jedi are grey by nature then.
starwarsrebels,2zqnqd,Mandolph_Rantooth,3,Sun Mar 22 14:11:24 2015 UTC,"In a sense, yes, in so much that harmony is balance. I think it is the difference between using the force and allowing yourself to be a vessel for the force."

starwarsrebels,2zqnqd,hyperlancer,2,Sat Mar 21 14:38:28 2015 UTC,"I still think there's a very slight left field to the moon tap dancing buffalo's chance that Kylo Wren in TFA could be a fallen Ezra. I don't really expect for it to be true, but I personally think it'd be awesome. At the very least, my gut tells me that SOMEONE from Rebels has to show up in one of these new movies."
starwarsrebels,2zqnqd,RealVoltar,2,Thu Mar 26 12:54:35 2015 UTC,"I've been watching SW for decades and I'm still finding new shit so there's no worry that you're reading too much into it.  Since Ahsoka (a name Dave said came directly from the word, Ashla which was the original name for the light side) was Anakin's apprentice and knew of the Chosen One prophecy, my take is that she senses he's not dead and is yet to play his part.  Considering she's one of the few jedi to have visions, I wouldn't be surprised if she's seen some hint of Luke's future role in helping Anakin fulfill his and may be mistaking Ezra for Luke.  Some of this is just based on the fact that Ezra is being presented as the hope for the galaxy...making Luke a New Hope if it wasn't obvious already where I was going with that.  Regardless, I'm seeing Ezra as an inadvertent pretender to Luke's destiny."
starwarsrebels,2zqnqd,boomkinburger,2,Mon Mar 23 10:10:51 2015 UTC,"The whole Luke/Leia and Ezra being born on the same day reminds me a lot of Harry Potter. In the books, Harry and Neville are born either on the same day or just around the same time and one of the two were suspected of being the ""prophecy"" based on this. While Harry was the ""savior"", Neville was a key figure in stopping Voldemort. I can see something similar happening with Ezra. He might not be the one striking the killing blow against the Empire, he is going to have some sort of important role in the Empire's demise. That's just my thought though."
starwarsrebels,2zqnqd,Mackadal,1 point,Mon Mar 23 15:33:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I prefer to think of the twins as the centre of the ""bigger (or biggest) picture"". I think Ezra has a smaller, more basic role in the Force, i.e; he's a ""regular"" Jedi inasmuch as Jedi can be regular, though he might grow to be quite powerful. I think that fits with the smaller, underdog atmosphere of Rebels vs the movies or Clone Wars.  Regarding Ahsoka's role, I think she might/should end up as basically Leia's Obi-Wan. A Jedi mentor who watches over her and maybe subtly tunes her into the Force without her knowledge. And I was going to say that as important as his role is, Bail can't really fill the same role as Obi-Wan since he's not a Force user. But now I'm thinking that it's kind of a beautiful thing, that a non-sensitive should have such a key role in the Force's bigger picture. And I'm thinking that the same thing could hopefully apply to Han in both TFA and the original picture.  tl;dr: We know fuck all until season 2/The Force Awakens."

(without actually training her, since she knows nothing of her Force potential prior to ROTJ).  Just the thought of Anakin's children being protected by his former master and his former padawan is too good for Filoni to pass up. If anyone could save them from Vader, it would be those two.

For example, Bail might not have told her about Obi-wan and Luke, or even who Leia is the child of, just that she needs a ""nanny"", so to speak ha. After Order 66, I'm sure Ashoka got out of Coruscant and tried contacting Anakin and Obi-wan to no avail. She did know Bail, so it's not a far reach to think she got in contact with him, got a general overview of what happened in the Senate, and then high-tailed it to Aldeeran, where she grew up."

It's clear from Ep IV that Leia has a history with Tarkin and Vader so I could see her showing up.  SWR starts 3 years before Ep IV correct?  So Leia is 14 just like Ezra....  Convenient.   ;)  I'd also love to see something in Alderaan now that Bail Organa is a character.  Speaking of Bail...in the prequels he is the Senator from Alderaan.  In Ep IV Leia is the Senator, isn't she?  So I'm wondering if Bail retired to give Leia the position?  Maybe to get more active with the Rebellion?"
starwarsrebels,2zoz00,styxtraveler,3,Fri Mar 20 13:06:16 2015 UTC,"this is what happened in the legends chronology. so it's likely the same thing, We know that by the time she is arrested by Vader in ANH, she has been a Senator and a thorn in his side for quite some time."

starwarsrebels,2zoz00,Chewblacka,3,Fri Mar 20 15:37:36 2015 UTC,"I think there would be a good chance. The problem is Leia is in the new movies. So you risk creating a violation of the canon or at least some inconsistency. So I will say ""no"" she will not appear in the series. At least until TFA is out and possibly the sequel to that. Or until Leia's character has run its course.  I think Vader will be in the series a lot less than people think. He is too powerful of a character. He would annihilate the rebels almost instantly in a 1 on 1 situation."
starwarsrebels,2zoz00,Skeezypal,6,Fri Mar 20 14:11:55 2015 UTC,"I don't understand.  How does Leia being in the new movies mean that she can't also be in Rebels?  Both are cannon, and each take place at completely different times.  I don't understand how that would create an inconsistency.  Are you suggesting that being in both would be too much work for Carrie Fisher?  While it would be awesome, I don't think she'd have to do the voice work.  Because she's what, 40 years older than Leia should be in Rebels?  With that kind of age difference it wouldn't be weird for them to cast a different voice actor.  Heck, maybe her daughter could voice young Leia.  You know, if she proves to be a good enough actor.  I think you're probably right about Vader.  It seems pretty likely he will be held in reserve for special moments."

starwarsrebels,2zoz00,tonuchi,0,Fri Mar 20 20:57:04 2015 UTC,No no not my point at all.   Unless the rebels team gets the screenplays to the new movies - which they certainly might - they risk causing a problem if they use characters that are in the new movies.  Let me give a stupid example. What if Leia says in the force awakens that she had never met a Jedi other than obi wan? Well this would cause a massive plot hole if rebels has her training with Ashoka.  Bottom line rebels team needs to be in the loop for the new movies if they are using any of the major characters
starwarsrebels,2zoz00,RealVoltar,5,Mon Mar 23 10:33:06 2015 UTC,But... that's exactly what Leland Chee and the Lucasfilm Story Group does.  It's their job to review and approve all content to be made cannon before it's published specifically to be sure that it is all consistent with each other. Filoni and the Rebels team have been working with the Story Group this whole time.  They are in the loop.

starwarsrebels,2ziqeg,ddrober2003,3,Mon Mar 23 10:56:30 2015 UTC,"Well I could see them working Maketh Tua as a morally gray character. I would say Kallus might be too, except his background with the Lasats and punting a stormtrooper to his death, since they both seemed disturbed by spoiler actions and Tua hasn't done anything super evil yet.  I would like to see some rebels who aren't as ""noble"" as the Ghost crew, the ones spoiler seems to refer to when he mentioned how much less violet the main characters are. So maybe one who is willing to bomb a civilian office working for the Galactic Empire as they're collaborators anyways and the ends justifies the means. Seeing some non-mustache twirling villain Imperials would be great too. Maybe even have it a point of conflict, where the rebels the Ghost crew are sent to help are hurting the common people and the Imperial governor (of the non-Tarkin variety) is genuinely trying to help the populace. Edit: In my vain attempt to keep it spoiler free, lets see if it works this time.  Edit 2: Nope, still doesn't show my spoiler, just puts spoiler tag there. So since its not showing up....tl'dr, I think some already shown Imperial characters could have a chance of not being all evil, and hope to see some darker rebels and non-evil Imperials."

starwarsrebels,2ziqeg,Plug-In-Baby,4,Thu Mar 19 00:18:16 2015 UTC,I would love to see characters like Kreia and Jolee Bindo appear in the show. They say so much wisdom that is necessary to process the mindset of changing the galaxy. Very interesting.

starwarsrebels,2ziqeg,HalcyonWind,1 point,Wed Mar 25 13:47:37 2015 UTC,The show and star wars is fundamentally about light vs. darkness.  The obsession with gray individuals is silly.  Krell was evil and his actions were essentially an audition for the Sith.  The Bonteri's were good characters caught on the wrong side.  Neither example characters are gray in any sense of the word as typically applied within what people mean by that in Star Wars.  They just do not fulfill your normal expectations for a particular side.
starwarsrebels,2ziqeg,otherpeoplesmusic,1 point,Thu Mar 19 11:12:51 2015 UTC,"The gray characters from TCW would be the pirates, if anyone. Their interests are aligned with profit and they often fight against and help the jedis to serve their own interests.   I think part of TCW 'grey' characters that he may be thinking of were more to show that the separatists were just as senate-locked as the republic, with the Chancellor on one side and Dooku on the other, both corrupting and dismantling the systems to eventually become the Empire down the line.  I agree, though, it's more about light vs darkness and the grey areas that were (partially) explored in TCW wouldn't fit with the current state of affairs, ie, shit has exploded into a good vs evil battle as the separatist and the republic merge into The Empire. With the introduction to Vader (and Tarkin) in the last episode, I imagine anyone trying to do anything 'good' within the Empire will be destroyed. I mean, shit, in ANH Vader would kill you if you questioned him. Everyone is too afraid to do anything that might be seen as going against the Empire. Shit has truly gotten bad."
starwarsrebels,2zg1l5,PrettyLilFlyers,9,Wed Mar 18 07:22:05 2015 UTC,There is also a scene later in the show where bunch of bounty hunters use holograms to disguise themselves as senate guards. I guess it's not that hard to mess with holograms.
starwarsrebels,2zg1l5,mojave955,8,Wed Mar 18 08:58:06 2015 UTC,"Man I didn't notice it till now but are they referring to Ezra as a hope? Maybe Ahsoka and the rebels cells are trying to find new ""hopes"" that Kenobi was talking about in his hologram. Obviously Ezra doesn't become the one but maybe this is almost a countermeasure against Vader's plot to find young force users."

You'd think he would get some new duds provided by the larger rebellion he's now joining.   One curious thing worth noting is this image that was on a wall in the background of a Rebels Recon video. A lot of it can be chalked up to an artist's interpretation of the character, but his jacket is different than what he wears in s1. We'll see."

starwarsrebels,2zb9y9,Darth_Kyofu,1 point,Wed Mar 18 17:09:10 2015 UTC,"So far in interviews, Filoni has stated that there are episodes like the Utapau arc put together, but in fragments, with temp voice acting, etc, and he would hope that there would be a way to release the content, with still doing justice to the material. He also teased that there might be something nice announced at celebration."
starwarsrebels,2zb9y9,Sapitoelgato,8,Wed Mar 18 18:09:23 2015 UTC,I'm hoping they age up the characters slightly at some point during the series like in clone wars. Give an excuse for updated more detailed character models.

Her journal and intro video talk about her fashionista side like her hair and clothes, so I wouldn't mind if she had a costume change or two. This might screw up missions, though?  Have Ezra cut his hair like how Korra did.  Like maybe it's the aftermath of Kanan's death, so Ezra has Heroic BSOD, so he ends up going solo for some time to figure things out. Cuts his hair, then ties it up like Kanan's. This prob won't happen until like the 3rd season. Just an idea..."

I'd expect Rebels to be the same.   I'd like to see Hera wearing different outfits more, simply because she's a spy and would tend to change her outfit to fit in better and look less like herself. Of course, that assumes we'll see her get out of the ship more, which I hope we do."
starwarsrebels,2zb9y9,Lurkndog,0,Wed Mar 25 14:04:10 2015 UTC,I wouldn't think so as Disney just like Nintendo are known keeping their characters recognisable for branding.

starwarsrebels,2z9rph,Perdikkas,6,Mon Mar 16 20:22:22 2015 UTC,I like the method of simply marking in the title the most recent spoilers in the post. For example if I want to talk about season one episode eight I'll just pop a [s1e8] in the title. That way if someone has seen up to that episode they know not to read that post or comments.
starwarsrebels,2z9rph,fearnotthewrath,8,Tue Mar 17 17:51:35 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think that a post should have a Spoiler tag on it, via the mods or in the OP title.  The reason being that someone who has not heard of Rebels, may start watching it for the first time and come here looking for community, would you want to ruin it for someone who watches it when season 3 is out?  I mean using the ""example"" in the sidebar, funny that you use that one, but it's true.  Do you really want to ruin that for someone who has yet to watch any of the movies?  No, and that was nearly 40 years ago...   I just think all spoilers no matter how big or small should be marked as such, with no specific time frame...  Just my 2¢"
starwarsrebels,2z9rph,twilly13,2,Mon Mar 16 20:45:01 2015 UTC,"Appreciate the input, and actually, I removed that same spoiler from r/StarWars. It should probably be removed here."
starwarsrebels,2z9rph,comet997,9,Mon Mar 16 20:53:23 2015 UTC,"Idk, my rule of the thumb is this: If I am not caught up on a tv show, I dont go poking around that subreddits comments. If I start going through a subreddit the day after a show airs and everything gets spoiled its my own damn fault. People want to discuss things. The issue I run into with spoilers is when people put them in the titles of posts, and I am scrolling through my front page and get one."
starwarsrebels,2z9rph,thekenzo,0,Tue Mar 17 01:45:37 2015 UTC,"This! I would still put spoilers on major events myself. But I don't poke around wiki, reddit or anything else until I am caught up. Anything else revealed is my own fault. Someone may be in season 1 and Google a character when we are in season 3 and find out spoilers in season 2 regarding that character. It is their fault. No amount of walking on eggshells can protect someone poking around.  It will eventually just be threads with spoiler tags :)"
starwarsrebels,2z9rph,ilikecakeeating,2,Tue Mar 17 10:54:54 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think once we're to season 3, season 1 is fair game. We can't walk on egg shells for everyone. Most of the discussion will be about the new episodes anyways. A 2 year buffer should be more than sufficient."
starwarsrebels,2z9rph,twilly13,2,Tue Mar 17 00:07:39 2015 UTC,"I don't see why it's a big deal to mark spoilers and leave them like that. I don't feel time frame should matter much. That doesn't mean that we can't discuss things, just that they can be marked as spoilers. That prevents people late to the party from having things ruined for them."

starwarsrebels,2zaqye,Nihillo,15,Tue Mar 17 01:43:48 2015 UTC,"Well, did you read Son of Dathomir? They didn't kill him (by that point) but he lost most of his forces and political power (that includes Mandalore).   As for the reason why I believe he's dead: it has been 15 years, and even though he's lost and weakened, they wouldn't just let him go, Palpatine doesn't spare anyone, the Empire would have hunted him down like they did with all force users, and unfortunately for Maul he's not a low profile padawan who was expelled like Ahsoka.  They are still going to expand on the ""Clone Wars legacy"" series (which is based on the unreleased episodes of TCW), so if we ever get to see how Maul's story ends, it will probably be in a comic book."
starwarsrebels,2zaqye,Cevan,7,Tue Mar 17 02:30:11 2015 UTC,Except those purposes HAVE been told; read Son of Dathomir.
starwarsrebels,2zaqye,RealVoltar,7,Tue Mar 17 02:37:49 2015 UTC,I agree about Sabine but I think the Empire has a pretty solid hold on Mandalore.  There's an Imperial academy there after all.

If he's alive he could be training Sith assassins, like the Inquisitor for the Empire if the emperor pardons him. Maybe Bo-Katan and Satine's nephew are leading the Mandalore rebel cell."
starwarsrebels,2zaqye,RealVoltar,4,Tue Mar 17 19:17:23 2015 UTC,I'd love to see Korkie and the white kids gang as well as Bo again. I'm wondering if the similarity between Bo and Sabine's visors is a coincidence or if there's some significance.
starwarsrebels,2zaqye,curio03,2,Tue Mar 17 05:19:08 2015 UTC,That's a good point. Their visors do look very similar. I really hope we get to see more Clone Wars characters return in Rebels so we can understand what happened to them. I heard that Hondo is coming back.

Why would well-off citizens on Alderaan, Naboo, and other urban worlds support an armed insurrection that would potentially lead to their own demise?

They seem to be lifting plot elements from the EU without lifting directly.  It could also have to do with copyright. In Star Trek they had a cameo character in TNG that they wanted to reuse in Voyage, but if they did that, each mention of his name would require paying something to the original writer for creating the character (since he wasn't a staff writer or whatever). So, they took the character and gave him a new name (Lt. Paris) even though using the same actor. Could be something similar here too, depending on the agreements authors sign when they write the books."

starwarsrebels,2z81rg,darthironicmemes,24,Mon Mar 16 11:49:18 2015 UTC,"The show itself was fine, but they could have not spoiled every 'big reveal' with teaser trailers."
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,BlueSmoke95,13,Mon Mar 16 11:51:33 2015 UTC,Honest question: why do you watch the trailers? You could just avoid them and be pleasantly surprised.
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,Nihillo,8,Mon Mar 16 13:05:39 2015 UTC,Because I am stupid.   Ooo! New teaser trailer!  Must watch!  But I think the point remains.  Fire Across the Galaxy was a 22 minute episode with several teaser trailers.  The teasers showed much of that episode.
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,BlueSmoke95,5,Mon Mar 16 15:07:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I didn't watch any trailers and the only thing I had spoiled was Lando and that was from seeing it here"
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,UpliftingTwist,3,Mon Mar 16 13:42:22 2015 UTC,"You're right, but he is too.  Disney should've saved the Darth Vader promos till after the show had aired."

starwarsrebels,2z81rg,mrpiggywinkles52,3,Mon Mar 16 18:29:31 2015 UTC,Disney got greedy and wanted ratings. I agree it was a shitty moved. I think if I saw vader at the end as a true surprise i might have peed my pants
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,Chewblacka,3,Mon Mar 16 23:10:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed, it's so obviously a decision made by a Disney accountant somewhere as they know it will boost ratings"
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,Blackfire853,8,Wed Mar 18 22:00:48 2015 UTC,Yes. I would have shit bricks at the end of Fire Across The Galaxy if I didn't know Vader was coming. And if the Frank Oz thing was secret it would have been really mind blowing to come on here and see the reaction when someone read the credits or whatever.
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,DandalfTheWhite,4,Mon Mar 16 12:44:39 2015 UTC,"I shat bricks when Tarken arrived by shuttle, just because I didn't see it coming. However they ruined it by showing Vader."

I've gotten to so used to whatever voice actor they used in TCW that hearing the real voice with the slight processing just didn't sound right.  Of course, Oz is 30 years older as well, so that probably has something to do with any differences in tonal quality."
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,TeutonJon78,13,Fri Mar 20 06:56:56 2015 UTC,How about simply fixing the release dates so they are not so random.   Also giving more episodes would be nice.  Sabine needs some work as a character I think.  TOO MUCH CHOPPER IS NOT ENOUGH :)
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,Chewblacka,4,Mon Mar 16 16:09:05 2015 UTC,I really did enjoy the early episodes which dove into the characters other than Ezra Kanaan. But there weren't enough. I would like to see more mixed pairings on screen like Hera/Sabine's episode.
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,tonuchi,2,Mon Mar 16 16:47:01 2015 UTC,You will get more Kanan and Hera love story
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,Chewblacka,11,Mon Mar 16 23:11:14 2015 UTC,"The Ezra intro really pissed me off.  Other than that I felt they gave Kanan and Ezra a bit too much screentime. I understand the show is about Ezra but Sabine and Zeb NEEDED more screentime. Heck even chopper got more screentime than those two.  Also the stormtroopers. I feel like they need work. They can't hit sure but the thing I despise about the OT is how troopers will stand pointing at fleeing rebels to get their squad to follow rather than just pulling the bloody trigger. It'd be nicer if they came a little closer to hitting the Rebels as well. Say a blaster shot hitting the wall just behind them instead of flying into the sky.  Finally I never felt like any of the crew were in danger except for in Fire across the Galaxy. So I'd like to see Sabine, Zeb or Kanan get shot next season (someone that could survive it, two of them are wearing armour and Zeb is just big and muscly) not killed. Just wounded and perhaps an episode about them trying to save their friend."
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,mrpiggywinkles52,-3,Mon Mar 16 18:26:35 2015 UTC,"The Ezra intro was only if you watched online, doofus."

She's grossly underwritten.  Also, her powers and abilities make the enemies seem incompetent and the Jedi seem very regular.  Her presence hurts the show, as is -- they need to correct this in season 2, by either toning down or explaining her super-human abilities, as well as giving some depth, weakness, vulnerability, or motivation to the character."
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,davebgray,15,Mon Mar 16 18:04:35 2015 UTC,"While I certainly want more of her history, what we've gotten so far more than explains her ability.  She's ex empire and she's Mandalorian.  We don't know the extent of her training in either, but it's never felt at all like a stretch of the imagination.    Interestingly though, I felt like she was more likeable in the first half of the season than the second."
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,zackmanze,9,Mon Mar 16 19:00:09 2015 UTC,"Maybe it was just me but I really wasn't as bothered by her doing her flips and such and not getting shot as others seem to be. Part of it is that I know its ultimately a kids show, so its going to have stuff like that. Also its that the rest of it is so good that I don't dwell on it. Not saying it shouldn't be addressed, I just don't think its a priority."
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,ddrober2003,4,Mon Mar 16 19:20:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it never bothered me either.  I mean, on top of that the physics of the show are defined so well that it just doesn't feel odd or out of place.  Kanan's acrobatic as hell too."
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,zackmanze,5,Mon Mar 16 19:28:35 2015 UTC,"BUT KANAN IS A JEDI!!!!   He's supposed to be magically gifted.  Ezra too.  When non-Jedi characters can dodge laser-fire, it is no longer special when Jedi do it."
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,davebgray,2,Mon Mar 16 20:28:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not considering their acrobatic ability a part of that though.  I'm not talking about like, super human skills, I'm talking about her ability to backflip and stuff, and Kanan's non jedi stuff.  His acrobatic kicks and leaps and things."
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,zackmanze,8,Mon Mar 16 20:38:37 2015 UTC,I feel like she didn't really do much in the second half of the season. early on Ezra is crushing on her but then that all but stopped and after the episode with Hera on the asteroid Sabine popped up now and again to paint something or give a quip.  Maybe I'm off base. I need to re watch the season already.
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,aatencio91,6,Mon Mar 16 19:18:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think this is it actually.  The last thing she really did was restore that picture of Ezra's parents for him.    More Sabine in Season 2 pls Dave"

starwarsrebels,2z81rg,matty25,4,Mon Mar 16 19:09:11 2015 UTC,Hera and Kanan will get more love time I think

I think the tech models look really good though, and honestly, the stormtrooper model is good too, even if their actions aren't."

starwarsrebels,2z81rg,I_need_that_bacon,3,Fri Mar 20 00:04:08 2015 UTC,"I felt like the characters all had impenetrable plot armor for the majority of the first season. This was brought up on this sub before: every episode ends with the rebels escaping without any trouble, up until Call to Action. That arc was great, because there was some serious weight to it. I feel that if the next season can replicate that, make the threat seem real, it would vastly improve the show."
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,nightmare901,1 point,Tue Mar 17 22:25:45 2015 UTC,"Most likely because they're so eps-limited in Season 1, no time to actually make multi-eps arcs. Season 2 should have the much needed breathing room to develop the plots."
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,pepoluan,9,Sun Mar 22 15:53:37 2015 UTC,"I felt that they did not need to have the ezra intro to every episode. it didn't add anything and was more of an annoyance than anything else. if they wanted a sweet little intro piece they could have used something along the lines of rebel transmissions to raise the people up, much like how Clone Wars used those holonet transmissions at the beginning of each episode.   As for the Kanan/Ezra thing in the ""Big Reveal"" it felt pushed, but they probably needed it out of the way quickly in order to push the story along. Hopefully season 2 will be longer with more in depth story arcs.   I also felt that the series got dark really quickly, especially in the last couple episodes. with Kanan's kidnapping and ultimate torture. That's pretty dark shit for an animated series."
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,AmunRa666,13,Mon Mar 16 13:15:10 2015 UTC,Apparently the Ezra intro is just on the Disney XD app.    I haven't seen it since they came back from winter break.

It's weird, doesn't really have anything to do with any of the story and after awhile just became an annoyance to be skipped past."

starwarsrebels,2z81rg,Skyskinner,2,Mon Mar 16 23:51:35 2015 UTC,"I think they could have done the cycle better. By that I mean  the cycle of one or two kid friendly episodes followed by a darker themed episode. It's a challenge of the medium for sure, but you can't be so cut and dry. I wish the episodes exhibited more unity in this regard. As it stands now there is a clear split between the episodes obviously aimed at kids compared to the ones that are aimed at the adult fans. I think we're all kind of carefree - I don't see any problem with intertwining these ideas more."
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,sorcerer165,4,Mon Mar 16 18:37:57 2015 UTC,"I think you're mistaking this with filler vs story episodes.  Every third episode we got a main story arc one, and it's not that they're ""more targeted to adults"" as much as it is they've got a lot of story to tell in twenty minutes."
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,zackmanze,1 point,Mon Mar 16 19:03:25 2015 UTC,"Except that all episodes are 22 minutes so they have a lot of story to tell every episode, not just the ones that we value more than others. What I'm asking for is more unity in each episode, as in less of an episode by episode format, instead I wish every episode was integral as opposed to some being what you called filler."
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,sorcerer165,2,Mon Mar 16 20:02:52 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's one of my favorite scenes. The line delivery, the way he just jumps out and casually dodges blaster fire like it was never an issue...that's the first of many  moments that is cementing Kanan as my second favorite Jedi, next to Kenobi. He has the benefit of  having a badass, Han Solo-esque attitude (with all the stealing and smuggling) and obviously has knowledge of and believes in the Force. Plus, he's a survivor. Who else besides Obi-Wan, Yoda, and now Ahsoka survived Order 66? Can't wait to read his new comic."

starwarsrebels,2z81rg,pepoluan,1 point,Sun Mar 22 15:57:58 2015 UTC,"Something IS very off, but I don't think Kanan's reveal is it.  What I'm missing in Rebels is the Lucas touch. He's not involved, and it kind of shows. Now, yes, when you have Lucas with absolutely no restraints, it can sometimes be bad, but when you DO keep a careful watch over him he brings that old-fashioned pulp adventure style to what he's doing, which Star Wars needs so very badly.  So Rebels' sense of humor seems to have largely been confined to very tame jokes like ""How did you know? Could you sense it?"" ""No, I could hear you two YELLING outside the door."" Or fat jokes with Azmorrigan.  The Lucas sense of humor, un-filtered, gave us the scene in Attack of the Clones where that one Geonosian guard jabs the Nexu with his shock pole and the Nexu responds by pouncing and murdering his ass. Which was actually funny; I remember a few people laughing in my original theatrical viewing, but it's a little too grim and the scene it's in is pretty serious, so despite being funny it doesn't work very well in context because Lucas didn't know how to make it work properly.  Whereas that old Lucas touch, with appropriate filters, managed to make Jar Jar actually HILARIOUS by putting him in the same room as General Grievous and sitting him down in an adjustable chair in ""Shadow Warrior"".  There's this nostalgic wish for the days of Flash Gordon that shines through in Star Wars works that Lucas is involved in, and it just isn't there without him. Rebels feels like it's paying lip service to it but doesn't genuinely have it. Rebels never felt like it upped the stakes enough until Tarkin showed up, so the Nexu scene wouldn't have worked for Rebels either but not because the context was too serious: because the context was too tame. The Nexu scene would feel WAY too brutal in Rebels. But if the same thing were done in The Clone Wars, it would have been done PERFECTLY, breaking the tension in exactly the right way at exactly the right time."
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,GodotIsWaiting4U,10,Mon Mar 16 15:32:02 2015 UTC,"The jokes in rebels are a bit hit and miss.  More hits than misses though, I think.    Loved Ezra's ""How you doin?' in Rebel Resolve (?)."
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,zackmanze,7,Mon Mar 16 19:02:00 2015 UTC,"The Ezra/Sabine thing in general has been pretty great I think. If he'd kept up the terrible come-ons and pick-up-lines throughout the season, it could've grated, but he gradually toned down as they spent more time together. Sure, there's still the occasional instance of his trying to show off, but it feels natural. Organic, even. I'm really curious if they continue exploring that interaction, or if it's eventually going to peter out entirely where the two of them are casual friends and colleagues, but never develop anything closer than that. Personally, I'd really like to see the two of them develop into close friends. The Kanan/Ezra mentor relationship and the Kanan/Hera pseudo-romance are both great, but I think it'd also be cool to have a strong personal friendship represented on the show."
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,Skyskinner,4,Mon Mar 16 22:20:03 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Lucas paints best with a wide brush and let others fill in the details. I never thought I'd say it but Jar Jar was borderline hilarious when he had his interaction with Grievous but we just need to make sure someone can just tell him something is a bad idea"
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,Blackfire853,5,Mon Mar 16 16:36:16 2015 UTC,The scene with Grievous redeamed Jar Jar for me. TCW in general handled Jar Jar fairly well imo. Made him semi likeable.
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,mrpiggywinkles52,2,Mon Mar 16 18:24:41 2015 UTC,Respectfully I disagree. The Mortis arc and D squad arcs (100% Lucas) were terrible   The jar jar and grievous arc was terrible. They captured grievous and sky walker and let them go? Come on man. Grievous would carve jar jar like a cake (barriston)
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,Chewblacka,1 point,Mon Mar 16 23:14:44 2015 UTC,"The Mortis arc was awesome, I don't know what you're talking about. As for D-squad, yeah, that was pretty bad."

starwarsrebels,2z81rg,Chewblacka,1 point,Thu Mar 19 22:40:22 2015 UTC,"It didn't bother me that much, but still my greatest Issue is the much mentioned Trooper accuracy, and overpoweredness of our Heroes (Sabine).  I especially remember one scene where they are running on a rooftop and get chased by Troopers who are parallel to them. Every shot hit the edge of the building, in the same way... How about some shots that go over them /before/behind them? Is that too much asked? :D  Also, in other adaptations, they had no problem with making badass non Jedi charakters. They couldn't do superlong jumps, or dodge fire in an open field. What made them so cool and badass was exactly that. In a world with Jedis, they would use cover, gadgets, their brain and other skills.  Also I agree that in general the not Ezra/Kanan charackters could use more exploration of their backstorys. Season 2 seems to get busyer with Rebel stuff, so Season 1 would have been perfect for some flashbacks or old friends that appear and make them confront their past /whatever.  I just don't get that feeling from Sabine. Also, her explosives feel lame. I am not generally against the Idea of explosives (Bobafett didn't feel lame with his rockets :D), but with Sabine I don't feel it."
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,LichtbringerU,1 point,Fri Mar 20 23:36:30 2015 UTC,"Art style and detail. Clone wars looked so much better and rebels didn't need to look worse, clone wars was cartoon enough looking.  And the silly kid no point chases and jokes."
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,-spartacus-,1 point,Tue Mar 17 11:13:13 2015 UTC,"Personally, I agree about the art style -- too simplified down.  However, the animation itself is so much better than TCW. Go back and watch S1 and watch how bad the walking animations are -- Anakin and Asoka kinda shuffle/skate everywhere. It got much better as the show went on, and it shows in Rebels."
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,TeutonJon78,-2,Fri Mar 20 07:06:02 2015 UTC,"This entire season has been more of a filler than anything. I actually expected more from Greg and Dave. I mean there were so many plots that could have came just from characterization. I mean for instance Ezra has a (huge) crush on Sabine. Through the season it felt like more and more she'd reciprocate it. I was hoping for a story line relating to attachments or something. Then the issue seemed to fall into a black hole, almost like it didn't happen. I haven't even heard anything about Jedi training with regards to Ezra."

Non spoiler, Kanan doesn't really care about the non-attachment part of the code.   I haven't even heard anything about Jedi training with regards to Ezra.   There was a lot of that crammed into the various episodes."

starwarsrebels,2z81rg,JMoc1,1 point,Sat Mar 21 06:03:15 2015 UTC,"From the public's perspective, probably. From the Jedi's, probably not.  But then is Luke truly a Jedi either? He only trained for a few months total, even if under Obi-Wan and Yoda."
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,TeutonJon78,3,Sat Mar 21 06:29:23 2015 UTC,"Actually the events of the OT are spread out over three years. For all we know, Luke could have contacted Obiwan and trained himself through the Force. However you do raise an interesting point, is Luke a true Jedi?"
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,JMoc1,2,Sat Mar 21 18:01:10 2015 UTC,"I guess I didn't think it was than long of time, but Wookeepedia seems to agree with it (3-4 years).  But, he wasn't even training that much from what we know. He was only with Ben for like a few days on Tatooine, unknown time  between Tatooine and Alderaan (only real training under Ben), and then it wasn't until getting to Yoda that we have any proof of additional training, although he was obviously practicing/reading books, since in ESB he had way more skills than he did in ANH.  He couldn't have been training that long with Yoda, because it was only the time for the rest of the main group to make it Cloud City, hang out for a bit, and then get captured minus his own travel time back and forth. The next time Luke makes it for some formal training, Yoda's dying.  So it would seem he's only had a couple of months of direct training at MOST.  Now, as to if he's a Jedi, it again goes back to whose definition. Buy Yoda, Darth Vader, and the Emperor all seem to consider him one, who were really the only living authorities on the matter. The canon answer would probably have to be yes."
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,TeutonJon78,0,Sat Mar 21 20:45:45 2015 UTC,"Wow, we have gotten into a big plot hole haven't we? What actually defines a Jedi? This requires research!"
starwarsrebels,2z81rg,JMoc1,1 point,Sat Mar 21 21:56:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, depending on how long the journeys actually take, Luke may have only had formal training for like a week total, too.  So, in the OT, either Luke was just that great, or Jedi weren't as crazy overpowered as shown in PT. Some of it probably has to do with Lucas not having fleshed them out as much -- and having them be more like warrior monks, rather than this giant peacekeeping force. All the talk in the OT makes it seem like there were only a few of them anyway, rather than having 10k of them only 19 years ago. Which of course, isn't a lot on a galactic scale, but still, that's a lot for them to have been basically forgotten about."

starwarsrebels,2z3i9u,FLYNN82,5,Sun Mar 15 05:15:57 2015 UTC,This doesn't have to do with Force Fairies (TM) but I noticed a new vehicle in both Clone Wars and Rebels.  It looks like a cross between a Republic Gunship and an Imperial TIE Fighter.   It shows up near the beginning of Season Six when ARC Trooper Fives is questioning the biochip in every clone's brain (the Order 66 chip).  I believe Anakin takes one while searching for Fives.  And the in Rebels when Tarkin comes to Lothar he is in one as well.
starwarsrebels,2z3i9u,Matsuyama_Mamajama,3,Sun Mar 15 12:48:42 2015 UTC,Are you talking about the Republic Police Gunship/Imperial Patrol Transport?
starwarsrebels,2z3i9u,rsixidor,3,Tue Mar 17 17:49:18 2015 UTC,Bingo!  That's it.
starwarsrebels,2z3i9u,Matsuyama_Mamajama,2,Wed Mar 18 03:01:09 2015 UTC,"Police gunship (from Starwars wikia):       Police gunships patrolling the Coruscant underworld The Republic police gunship was the civilian model of the Republic attack gunship and was sleeker, smaller, and less heavily armed. The police gunship possessed a spoked cockpit and solar gatherer panels which acted as the power generator for the ship. Two ball-mounted laser cannons were underneath the cockpit and one laser cannon was mounted on the rear of the ship which were better suited for patrolling the city scape as well as having a lower risk overall in causing collateral damage.  The police gunships were also equipped with searchlights in the event that they had to conduct searches at night or in areas of Coruscant where visibility was low, such as the underworld. The gunship's cockpit also had two seats for the pilot and gunner, with the pilot being slightly behind of and elevated over the gunner. The side hatches opened for entry, and had a ramp near the rear in the event that the circumstances required rapid deployment of its personnel.

starwarsrebels,2z3i9u,autowikiabot,2,Tue Mar 17 17:49:57 2015 UTC,"I just finished a chronological viewing, and I know exactly what you're talking about. Another thing that Rebels recycled was the ""cat-rat"". You know, the creature from the opening of Empire Day? It appears in the second-to-last episode of season 5."
starwarsrebels,2z3i9u,nightmare901,2,Sat Mar 21 14:32:37 2015 UTC,Ok maybe that's where I saw it.  I watched a LOT of TCW episodes!
starwarsrebels,2z3i9u,Matsuyama_Mamajama,9,Sun Mar 15 13:11:15 2015 UTC,Yep it's been pointed out before. However it does show how deep the connection between Rebels and Clone Wars are.

starwarsrebels,2yzido,bman3k,20,Sat Mar 14 03:38:22 2015 UTC,"Actually, I don't think they have been killing many.  They might be incapacitated, but Tarkin himself pointed out the lack of causalities, and that the Ghosts cell are not interested in violence.  I think the important thing to remember that just because they've been hit, and went down, isn't necessarily a kill shot. Even today, shooting someone with a gun isn't assurance that they'll die. People often survive gunshots, even in vital parts like the head.  So maybe, just a crazy thought, but maybe the Troopers armors are tougher then we've believed all these years, combined with shooting to stop threats rather then to kill, many could very well be alive. Hurt badly, sure, but alive.  And this is something they've clearly given thought to. Tarkins dialogue there, the question on that one Rebel Recon about the Stormtroopers getting sucked out into space, and whether or not their armor was airtight. The answer was yes, but they would have very limited amount of air. Given how quickly the Ghost leaves after that and isn't pursued, it's very possible (and dare say likely) that they were picked up.  One of the best examples by far, however, is about a minute and half into Rebel Resolve. One of the troopers gets hit by the Walkers shots, and as the camera focuses on the squad leader calling in, you see him slowly rolling over. Not dead despite taking a shot from a friggin' Walker. They took the time to make sure the viewer could see that Trooper, and that he wasn't in fact dead.  I don't think there's zero deaths. Tie Pilots who were shot down, for example, are likely dead. But I don't think the death toll is nearly as high as we may think it is."
starwarsrebels,2yzido,Binturung,6,Sat Mar 14 07:46:26 2015 UTC,"I forgot about what Tarkin said, that is a good point. I would also like to believe that while blaster shots incapacitate Troopers their armour gives them a decent chance of living.  So hopefully there aren't too many of our favourite red shirts dying off."
starwarsrebels,2yzido,Nihillo,2,Sat Mar 14 17:55:22 2015 UTC,"They have been incapacitating them as of late, but I'm pretty sure they killed some troopers in the first few episodes of the series. One very clear example that comes to mind is when Chopper jettisoned a whole fireteam into space, their suits were sealed and they could survive in the vacuum, sure, but they didn't have an infinite supply of oxygen, those guys are 100% dead, there's no skirting around this fact.  I think Tarkin was incorrect, they try to avoid killing, but sometimes their hand is forced, and they are not afraid to kill. I can appreciate that, they have principles, but they are not limited by them, they are willing to put them aside temporarily in order to complete the mission."
starwarsrebels,2yzido,Binturung,6,Sat Mar 14 11:19:34 2015 UTC,"One very clear example that comes to mind is when Chopper jettisoned a whole fireteam into space, their suits were sealed and they could survive in the vacuum, sure, but they didn't have an infinite supply of oxygen, those guys are 100% dead, there's no skirting around this fact.   Their fate is a little vague going by Pablo Hidalgo comments here, IMO. They'd have a brief window for being rescued, and given the Ghost made such a quick escape, I wouldn't rule out those poor saps being picked up.   I think Tarkin was incorrect   HERESY!"
starwarsrebels,2yzido,Darth_Kyofu,2,Sat Mar 14 18:42:29 2015 UTC,"While the crew has principles and tries to not kill as much as they could, I don't think that applies to Chopper."
starwarsrebels,2yzido,Horst665,11,Mon Mar 16 02:11:21 2015 UTC,"I am not sure about the Troopers, but yeah, I also think the Clones are the best in TCW (I am still in season 4, so no spoilers please!)  The Troopers are usually displayed as part of an oppressive military force, especially on Lothal. I'd also agree with /u/ImNotASWFanboy and say they know what they are doing. That doesn't mean they are always completely free to choose. Ever thought why they are missing so many shots? Maybe they plainly (subconsciously) don't want to kill.  Edit: It bugs me a lot more, how the Clones are wasted and sacrificed in TCWs! ""Oh, just another batallion wasted, because Anakin had to show off before Asoka LOL"" All the jedis are always saving themselves with their super powers, but the regular Joe Clone just gets wiped out :("
starwarsrebels,2yzido,ArmyDoc68251,7,Sat Mar 14 04:28:15 2015 UTC,"This to me was hard. I mean in some ways the Jedi really just sent them through the meat grinder.  Obi wan was a real prick in this regard. Episode three when the clone pilots are dying, he basically says fuck em.  I really felt for the clones, who shouldn't be fighting in the open. They just charge into droids because these idiots with laser swords have no ranged combat. I actually resented the Jedi by the end of TCW and felt like they deserved to be wiped out. They weren't good anymore, or at least how I interpret good to be."
starwarsrebels,2yzido,mrpiggywinkles52,6,Sat Mar 14 11:20:59 2015 UTC,"I noticed throughout the series that differnent Jedi treated their clones differently. Obi-Wan only seemed to really give a shit about Cody. Whereas Anakin, Plo Koon and Ahsoka genuinely cared about the lives of their men."
starwarsrebels,2yzido,Darth_Kyofu,1 point,Sun Mar 15 00:37:25 2015 UTC,"Even Vader still cared about his man in old canon. I mean, the ones that used to be in the 501st. He couldn't care less about the new ones."
starwarsrebels,2yzido,mrpiggywinkles52,3,Mon Mar 16 02:13:52 2015 UTC,"I was hoping we'd see that in Rebels. Not necessarily Vader caring about his men, I feel like at this point in the story that'd weaken his character. But interaction between the old clone vets and the new conscripts. I'd love to see an old bitter Rex, Cody, Fox or whoever just throwing conscripts into the meatgrinder whilst trying to preserve the clones."
starwarsrebels,2yzido,Darth_Kyofu,1 point,Mon Mar 16 18:23:02 2015 UTC,I remember reading on Wookieepedia about old Cody complaining about the conscripts after one hit his head on the wall.
starwarsrebels,2yzido,otherpeoplesmusic,3,Mon Mar 16 22:05:00 2015 UTC,"I feel ya, but the clones are basically meat robots. It's kind of a weird war in that respect - robot vs robot but one is made of flesh - both are essentially programmed to kill, obey orders etc etc but the fault is that during TCW we see that the clones have a lot of personality, individuals even whereas all the droids, the spiny ones anyway, have a very base personality which is for some reason usually hilarious. I like funny people, so sometimes seeing the robots die I'd still get some feels but not as much if it was a clone with a name and a jazzed up haircut."
starwarsrebels,2yzido,Horst665,2,Sat Mar 14 14:17:52 2015 UTC,"I actually resented the Jedi by the end of TCW and felt like they deserved to be wiped out. They weren't good anymore, or at least how I interpret good to be.   Yes!"
starwarsrebels,2yzido,ArmyDoc68251,2,Sat Mar 14 13:58:51 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that was Anakin, not Obi Wan, disregarding the Clone Pilots.  I began to feel the same way as TCW went on, especially since most of the Jedi had plot armour or showed up in RotS."
starwarsrebels,2yzido,ArmyDoc68251,5,Sat Mar 14 18:19:07 2015 UTC,"Depends on the context you're thinking ... In episode threes intro, ""I'm going back to help them!"" Then obi is like ""No! They're doing their job so we can do ours."" Right after that the last clone gets blown away.   In TCW Anakin seems to consistently forget everyone can't keep up with him. Seems more productive to break formation and fight rather than use ships as human shields."
starwarsrebels,2yzido,Snorhax,2,Sat Mar 14 21:00:03 2015 UTC,"Oops, I thought you meant in TCW Episode three, not RotS."
starwarsrebels,2yzido,Jawzilla1,1 point,Sat Mar 14 21:36:20 2015 UTC,"Stormtroopers's haven't really been characterized in Rebels as the Clones were in TCW (yet?). So if you're on Season 4 you've got a ways to go, one of the best (IMO) Clone Trooper stories is in Season 5."
starwarsrebels,2yzido,Chap82,6,Sat Mar 14 18:17:39 2015 UTC,Super valid point lots of people miss: CONSCRIPTS   basically the empire is pressing people into service via draft.  For all we know it functions like North Korea: oh you don't want to fight? Well hope your family enjoys mining minerals to death.
starwarsrebels,2yzido,Horst665,6,Sat Mar 14 11:25:23 2015 UTC,"Well this is what I liked about the old EU, sometimes they were portrayed as evil, but at other times the Stormtroopers were just normal guys who either were forced to enlist or thought they were doing the right thing by serving the Emperor."
starwarsrebels,2yzido,Darth_Kyofu,3,Sat Mar 14 15:18:44 2015 UTC,"I completely agree! Especially after ""Breaking Ranks"", where we see young kids training to be stormtroopers. Every time a trooper is gunned down in the show I imagine how it was probably some young dude who didn't really want to be there.  My theory is that the stormtrooper armor actually does protect them against blaster shots, so when they get hit they're only knocked unconscious for a few hours. But even if that's true, there are still times when the Ghost crew has killed people, like Chopper opening the airlock or the numerous explosions they've caused."
starwarsrebels,2yzido,Azazel_fallenangel,4,Sat Mar 14 15:12:56 2015 UTC,What bugs me about Stormtroopers is they are such a bad shots. I know they are the 'bad guys' after the clones wars but how did empires marksmanship degrade so much?
starwarsrebels,2yzido,USSZim,5,Sat Mar 14 12:50:44 2015 UTC,"Someone once wrote about it, that it can be a psychological thing - there was another write up like this and I think even better worded, but you get the meaning.   There's also a theory, that at least in the movies they were instructed to keep Luke alive at all costs, because Vader had the plan to turn him to the dark side. So all these shots fired at Luke were meant to intimidate / herd along but never to hit."
starwarsrebels,2yzido,Captain-Rex,1 point,Sat Mar 14 14:07:46 2015 UTC,"Due to the accelerated aging, the clones got old pretty fast, and became inadequate for combat. Then you ask, ""why didn't they just make more?"". Well, I don't have an answer for that anymore, but in old canon, they had to attack Kamino and destroy the facilities because they were making an army to attack the Empire. However, the Empire did start recruiting normal people, and if in the new canon there are still clones in the Empire, then we can just assume that the stormtroopers with bad aim are normal people."

starwarsrebels,2yzido,ImNotASWFanboy,2,Sat Mar 14 08:51:57 2015 UTC,"I'm the opposite: I was actually surprised at the amount of stun guns being used! I know it is a predominately kids show, but in TCW there were a lot more casualties (granted, they were also in active war zones). In Rebels, it seems like Hera is the only one who actually kills stormtroopers (like when she season finale spoiler)  Sabine, Zeb, and Ezra all use stun weapons half or all of the time and knock out troopers often."

starwarsrebels,2yzjr7,diamondcreeper,4,Sat Mar 14 03:52:27 2015 UTC,"See, the reason why I prefer OT Yoda over PT Yoda is just the possibilities he presents. And I don't blame it on the PT sucking. Rather, it's just that at the time, Yoda was very limited. At this point he's stronger than ever. Reaching out, guiding people, showing them what they're capable of, and leading them towards a better path.   I'm writing a Star Wars story currently and one of the things people often complain about is how black and white Star Wars is. While I can agree it's like that, I think it's like that for a good reason through my experience. Like Yoda, the story is teaching us a lot about our actions. A good deed could lead to disastrous results. We saw that in two cases with Luke and Anakin respectively. And while great evils exist with the worst of intentions, great good exists in a world that is grey.   If we look at it, the world of Star Wars is pretty grey. Han isn't your clean hero. He's a scoundrel. And Leia isn't perfect either. She'd sacrifice a lot to take down a villain. We see a world that can be filled with all sorts of possibilities. Good and bad.   And Frank Oz is just amazing."
starwarsrebels,2yzjr7,Clonetrooperkev,4,Sat Mar 14 04:52:06 2015 UTC,First off you simply cant have enough Frank Oz. That was a coup to get him in this show.  Secondly I agree. The worst thing ever was to see Yoda flipping around with a lightsaber.
starwarsrebels,2yzjr7,Chewblacka,3,Sat Mar 14 17:50:58 2015 UTC,"I didn't really like or dislike the lightsaber stuff. It's just the choices he made that made it all questionable. But like I said, that's because he didn't know. Now in the OT he has so much power and wisdom, but there's nothing he can do."
starwarsrebels,2yzjr7,Clonetrooperkev,2,Sat Mar 14 17:53:55 2015 UTC,Saw it opening night with theater full of die hard fans.  Was the best experience I ever had.  The group let out a collective cheer. It was awesome.  I still get goosebumps all these years later!!!
starwarsrebels,2yzjr7,Captain-Rex,1 point,Fri Mar 20 00:32:52 2015 UTC,"I saw Ep2 at a pre-release (movie theater screening for employees testing the reels). And Yoda is my favorite.  When that scene hit, I figured I would be jumping around in my seat. Instead, I just sat their quiet, kind of disappointed. Even then Yoda was supposed to be a master of the Force and one of the strongest users.  When he absorbed the lightening from Dooku, that is in line. Then he whips out his saber and hops around -- totally not in character. He should have been nonchalantly whooping on Dooku, not just barely holding even."
starwarsrebels,2yzjr7,TeutonJon78,2,Sat Mar 14 18:54:26 2015 UTC,"At the theater I was at, people started laughing really loud when Yoda started flipping around like that. I was disappointed too."
starwarsrebels,2yzjr7,matty25,1 point,Mon Mar 16 19:16:45 2015 UTC,"Yoda during the prequels was a different character. He was the Grandmaster of an order losing its ways. His 22 year exile on Dagobah made him rethink his ways, which is why he's different in the OT."

starwarsrebels,2yv3i8,callmeon,8,Fri Mar 13 01:39:33 2015 UTC,This is the only answer. I don't know why you would want to watch something out of order unless you are too lazy to navigate it on Netflix.

I'm in the midst of season two now I think, that or at the end of season one.   Where ever I'm at its good now. I used to just put it on for background noise and look up occasionally. But the last 3 or 4 episodes have been non-stop action. I can't pull my eyes away from the screen."

starwarsrebels,2yv3i8,SpaceVX,1 point,Fri Mar 13 10:07:30 2015 UTC,"Disagree, it is most definitely NOT the only answer. The release order is the way the show was meant to be watched, jumping into different stories at different times in the Clone Wars.

starwarsrebels,2yv3i8,mutually_awkward,1 point,Mon Mar 16 06:45:19 2015 UTC,"You can disagree all you want.  But there release order was done for episode, season-based network TV, where finales and premieres are important both for ratings and for hype purposes.

starwarsrebels,2yv3i8,FrankiePoops,2,Fri Mar 13 01:42:30 2015 UTC,Slightly different question: What parts of Clone Wars don't suck? When does it get good?
starwarsrebels,2yv3i8,Momojo,3,Fri Mar 13 02:11:56 2015 UTC,"Season 1 has some standout masterpieces, lots of bland/blah episodes, and a few garbage episodes (NUVO VINDI, TAKE YOUR ""BLOO SHADOW WIRUS"" AND GET OUT).  Season 2 has almost no garbage, some bland/blah episodes, quite a few solid episodes, but the only really strong standout I can think of off the top of my head is ""Landing at Point Rain"". It's better than Season 1 on average and has a much more consistent quality, but when Season 1 was good (which was rare) it was AMAZING, while Season 2 just doesn't hit the same peaks.  Season 3's first half is spent wrapping up loose plot threads from 1 and 2, and it does a very good job of it. The first two episodes frame ""Rookies"" from season 1 and are very good, and while ""Sphere of Influence"" had a lukewarm reception at broadcast due to being a very different kind of episode from what came before, it's generally seen as one of the best of the season nowadays (kind of like how popular opinion has shifted for Empire Strikes Back). It marked a turning point for the show in a lot of ways, too.  The second half of season 3 abandons the whole achronological anthology approach and switches to consistently doing multipart arcs and going in chronological order. It also saw a huge improvement in character models and animation quality, as well as generally much better writing. Personally, I think it's because Lucas's daughter Katie got on the writing staff, because she's turned out to be REALLY good at this."
starwarsrebels,2yv3i8,GodotIsWaiting4U,2,Sun Mar 15 16:57:47 2015 UTC,"Gets better as time goes on but there are a few bogus story arcs throughout. But if you really can't handle the early episodes, I say start with season one episode 19.  That was the first big event on the show."
starwarsrebels,2yv3i8,electrikyle,2,Fri Mar 13 05:57:46 2015 UTC,Start at Season 2.
starwarsrebels,2yv3i8,zackmanze,-1,Fri Mar 13 21:10:54 2015 UTC,"Doesn't get as good as Reebels, but it has its moments."
starwarsrebels,2yv3i8,zackmanze,7,Fri Mar 13 21:11:46 2015 UTC,Highly debatable. Thus far I've found the later seasons of TCW to be better than rebels. IMO Rebels ranks around the start of TCW season 3 or 4. However it is doing that with a much smaller budget which is highly commendable.
starwarsrebels,2yv3i8,mrpiggywinkles52,-1,Fri Mar 13 22:54:58 2015 UTC,"I've watched all but Season 6 of TCW.  Season 2 and 5 were the highlights for me.  Clone Wars had it's moments, for sure.  Boba, Satine.  But it's simply not as good a story as Rebels.  I mean hell, Clone Wars isn't even really telling a story so much as it is just spinning wheels.  Nothing changes, nothing is of consequence.  It could be interesting, sometimes very interesting, but I was never once emotionally engaged by it.  That's a pretty big shortcoming.    I was immersed in Rebels within 15 minutes.  I care about the characters.  I'm excited to watch the next episode.  I never felt any of those things with Clone Wars."
starwarsrebels,2yv3i8,zackmanze,1 point,Fri Mar 13 23:02:35 2015 UTC,"They are two different kinds of series. I agree with you that Rebels is far better at telling a story. TCW for me was more about fleshing out aspects of the prequels rather than telling the story. I feel that deaths of characters are purposefully made to have no effect to show how insignificant everyone (particularly the clones) are in the grand scheme of the war.  Rebels is far more immersive but I worry at some point it might become tiring to have watched the ghost crew for so long. TCW had the option of setting different stories with different characters, so one week we had Anakin and Ahsoka taking out the Malevolance and the next week an Order 66 arc with Fives, and the week after that we have Darth Maul and Savage ruining pirates. Rebels may evolve that way but I agree with most of your points, TCW will have a special place in my heart for growing up in the prequel area which without TCW is pretty terrible."
starwarsrebels,2yv3i8,mrpiggywinkles52,1 point,Fri Mar 13 23:46:14 2015 UTC,"I guess that's another place where I kind of disconnect; to me TCW and the Prequel movies aren't drastically different experiences. TCW to me was just ""Prequel Trogy Plus"""
starwarsrebels,2yv3i8,zackmanze,3,Sat Mar 14 05:39:21 2015 UTC,"I agree it was, but it fleshed out aspects of the prequels. Sure the prequels had bad scripting and directing, sure the writing was pretty bad and aspects of the movie weren't fleshed out. But TCW fixed that, sure the scripting made you cringe in the first two seasons, but overall the show had decent scripting and directing, it fleshed out things like the clones and jedi that fought in the war and made anakin an actually likeable character. I mean if you watched the prequels for the first time and watched TCW before ROTS you'd legitimately feel sad about Anakin's fall because he is such a likeable character in the show, you'd understand his reasons for not trusting the council because of what happened to Ahsoka, You'd feel the weight of the Order 66 scene because you KNOW all the Jedi and most of the commander clones in it."
starwarsrebels,2yv3i8,mrpiggywinkles52,0,Sat Mar 14 09:09:14 2015 UTC,"See, for me it didn't have that impact.  Maybe it's because I watched it all on Netflix, maybe it's because I was a kid when the prequels came out, and liked them, so Clone Wars wasn't as good, to me.    But for me it just felt like, ""hey, here's extra stuff.  Deleted scenes. Fun action stuff.  Buy toys!""  And Season 2 was actually by far my favorite.  The first Satine arc and the young Boba arc were the only ones I found to be really, really cool."

So while that show is quite entertaining, you're not missing anything lore-wise. There's a The Clone Wars movie that you should watch to get the full story, just don't expect a great movie. You should have no problem going in release order from there, the show starts picking up in season 3 but seasons 1 and 2 do still have some great episodes here and there."

starwarsrebels,2yv3i8,Skeezypal,1 point,Fri Mar 13 12:22:04 2015 UTC,I second this. It's the way the show was meant to be watched - jumping into different stories at different times in the Clone Wars.

I'm not usually one for changing the order of things in Star Wars but I think the chronological order makes a lot more sense for Clone Wars.  It is a much larger scale series than Rebels has been and doesn't have nearly as much focus so I think going in this order makes it more enjoyable."

starwarsrebels,2yv3i8,elljawa,1 point,Fri Mar 13 22:45:01 2015 UTC,"Release order is easy. All you have to do is remember that some episodes in season 1 got prequels and/or sequels in seasons 2 and 3, and season 2 episodes likewise got prequels/sequels in season 3, so sometimes you'll tune into an episode and you'll see characters who already died in episodes you've already seen. This is because that episode hasn't happened yet. For the most part, this is actually pretty easy to disentangle just on the fly, because only GOOD episodes got prequels or sequels, so it'll be pretty memorable. The exception, I guess, is that the movie got two prequel episodes, but they're damn good ones.  Chronological order is good if you just can't deal with that, but takes more work to do because you have to jump around so much in the early seasons. Honestly, release order was good enough for us vets at the time, it's not going to wreck the show for you to just do it that way, but chrono order exists if you REALLY want it, but to me chrono order just seems like a lot of work for minimal added value."

The first couple of seasons aren't as good as the later ones though, which have bigger budgets, better story, and better characterization +  additional EU lore(which is really cool). The first two seasons are mostly filler, but they're still worth watching.   Also, if you plan to watch it all, you really SHOULD watch it in chronological order. Otherwise there's no impact to several episodes - you'll end up watching the last episode of an arc first, which gets weird."

You can easily decorate the pool noodles with duct tape to make it look like it has a handle. We actually had a balance beam and did this.  It worked great!  The first one to fall off lost.  We had a round robin tournament to find the winner.  If you don't have a balance beam (I mean who does?  We only had it form a previous party that we made it for) you can do this: Tape a square on the ground and have two kids step in, they battle, the first one out of the square or hit on the side three times looses.  Or tape a wide line on the ground and the same thing applies, if you step off you lose.  I think it was for my sons 7th birthday so it's not too far in ages.  There will be one child in tears because they lost.  Just prepare for that.  A treasure hunt works great too.  We did it for a Pirate Party and the prize was the goodie bags.  We had a bout 8 places they had to go to.  Some were out in the backyard, some out front, some inside (both 1st and 2nd floor), and our neighbors house (their backyard).  Each spot had a clue to the next place.    For Snacks: Light Saber Treats: Pretzels or red vines dipped in chocolate as the handles were fun.  We had both. Tie Fighter Treats: Marshmallows (Little ones) sandwiched between graham crackers and held together by melted chocolate.

It would be nice if they dealt with this issue at some point, either in this series or in a novel, I imagine it would be a similar situation to what happened after the IRL cold war, the soviet union ended, and arms dealers were all over their stuff, selling it to anyone who had the money."

I see no reason that within the context of the discussion with Obi Wan that Ashoka would not ""fit the bill"" for what Vader needed to turn back from the dark side.

Obi Wan was not struck down. Like Yoda he became one with the Force and left no physical remains.  He just did it in a split second so that Vader's saber hits an empty robe.

I know why Ahsoka would be the logical choice given the history with Anakin but you never know with Ezra or what his fate will be, maybe his heart has just the right purity to it and potential for a successful confrontation with Vader and by extension the Emperor.  Obviously we've seen a few displays of the darkside in Ezra that might count against my previous comment of a pure heart and perhaps that's why he ultimately ends up failing but i can see how he could look like the next best option even out of desperation."

starwarsrebels,2yqq46,kipperson,2,Sun Mar 15 02:32:26 2015 UTC,"Well, if you assume ""There is another"" means there's only one other that Yoda knows of, then it would probably make sense for it to just be Leia. For all we know atm, Yoda may not know if Ashoka is even alive or not. He does know that Leia is alive, though. I guess we'll see what happens in the show, but considering it's the OT I'd say it's most definitely Leia. That's an interesting theory though."
starwarsrebels,2yqq46,Sithsaber,3,Thu Mar 12 07:55:02 2015 UTC,There is no doubt that Yoda meant Leia in the context of the original screenplay. I am sure it would be a retcon but the fact is he never explicitly says LEIA. Therefore although a technicality my point is it at least leaves the door open that some characters from Rebels don't necessarily have to die before ANH.

starwarsrebels,2yqq46,thomashush,1 point,Mon Mar 16 06:11:55 2015 UTC,"I have never liked the idea of the OTHER being Leia. If the Princess presented a remotely possible talent in the force, someone on Alderaan would have picked up on it and she would be trained or hidden better. Even in ANH we know Vader can sense the force in people from some distance (Luke in the trench) and yet had no sense of Leia on the Tantive V? While that may in the real world be because Lucas hadn't hashed out the whole idea yet, that's fine, because it also gives an out to that line about an OTHER, and the Skywalker line was just Yoda beings nice guy and enlightening Luke on this family.  Leia not being a JEDI would also stand to refute that JEDI making babies automatically make Jedi Babies. If theat were the case, the SITH would have been operating breeding programs long ago.   I don't know the OTHER has to be a character we have seen yet, though. If it really is meant to refer to someone who could defeat Vader, then it could be Yoda felt the living force creating a new force-born person strong in the lightside meant to balance the force-tumor that is Anakin. And this would give us a strong new Jedi in TFA."
starwarsrebels,2yqq46,thomashush,1 point,Mon Mar 16 17:56:31 2015 UTC,"I don't see how Ashoka could still be alive by the time of A New Hope.    ANH opens with Leia sending a desperate message begging for help to Obi-Wan.  She clearly has never meet him, but knows this Jedi exists and was last known to be on Tatooine because Bail told her.  Obviously Bail has this knowledge, because he was there when Obi-wan took Luke and left, and he has shared it with Leia.  But if Ashoka is Fulcrum, then she's part of the Rebel alliance. She's working with Bail, who knows she was a Jedi.  Why would Bail have told Leia about Obi-wan, but not about Ashoka, who's right there, and has probably even meet and possibly even worked with Leia.    If Leia is desperate for Jedi help, why would she send droids to Tatooine to look for an old Jedi who she's never met, who may not still be alive, and who may have long since left Tatooine.

In the Onderon Rebels arc of season 5, Lux said that he was going to represent Onderon as a senator for the Republic.

starwarsrebels,2ylo86,davebgray,15,Tue Mar 10 20:58:43 2015 UTC,"Sabine is a Mandalorian, and they are generally thought to be the best non-Force using warriors in the galaxy, she's (suppposedly) at top athletic condition and trained in basically everything that has to do with combat (even though we never get to see her training or anything, for all we know, she could have been a cosplayer). I don't know if that justifies her agility in the finale, I guess it depens on your suspension of disbelief."
starwarsrebels,2ylo86,Nihillo,8,Tue Mar 10 22:47:38 2015 UTC,"She also had Imp training i believe for whatever that's worth lol  I think it's just that what we've seen so far of Mandalorians in canon suggests they rely a lot on gadgetry, look at Jango Fett's fight with Obi-Wan.....it was all jetpack and tricks. So i don't know if saying ""she is a Mandalorian"" is really cutting it at this point but hey if they give us some more backstory on how she got her skills or who her mentors were that might go a long way in making her feel more legit.  ETA: Thinking the same when i watch the Maul vs. Pre Vizsla showdown, i don't see anything that really supports what Sabine can do all i see is jetpacks, flamethrowers, projectiles and explosives... and even when Vizsla loses his jetpack is he coming up with some awesome evasive maneuvers at all? not a one."
starwarsrebels,2ylo86,thelastdisciple,9,Wed Mar 11 01:57:01 2015 UTC,"Well hey, the imperial cadets seem to be more competent than the actual Stormtroopers, so who knows, maybe the training is worth something. Maybe Stormtroopers don't even get training, and the cadets were actually receiving commando training or something. Throwing them in a pit and having them parkour their way up sure does seem a tad hardcore for a Stormtrooper, at most I would expect them to teach them how their equipment works and tell them to try to not shoot each other."
starwarsrebels,2ylo86,Nihillo,6,Wed Mar 11 02:52:27 2015 UTC,"I believe the cadets in Breaking Ranks were a more advanced group that had been set aside for additional training. We know that Ezra had been at the academy for a few weeks already, so they probably started out in a larger group and split them up later to further train the more skilled cadets. Plus there's the fact that separating the skilled ones allowed for possible Force-sensitives to be identified easier."

For me, Sabine represents the return of the Mandalorian spirit, that of independence, and almost Jedi level of martial prowess.

starwarsrebels,2ylo86,Nihillo,7,Wed Mar 11 12:07:55 2015 UTC,"Would we agree that there's such a thing as too much of that effect and just disagree on the line?  She does plenty of cool shit without having to lay it on quite so thick.  She's definitely reminiscent of Bo Katan beyond the stylized vizor and quick-wit remarks and Bo Katan was reasonably badass.  You could chalk up the demolitions prowess to Imp training or Mandalorianess; maybe also some ability to slice though with prowess attributed to characters who are, ""the slicer,"" in other stories.   Tell me what her major flaw is and I'll happily consider it.  If I didn't like the character I wouldn't be frustrated with her being framed as the attractive, hyper-intelligent and artistically sophisticated super-soldier/gymnist, explosives and computer expert who always remains clear-headed and emotionally intelligent (providing Ezra with subtle guidance back from the dark side) and humorous...teenager.  Granted the first season focused more on Kanan and Ezra, they could've done a call-back to Art Attack without quite so much of the tongue in cheek.  I didn't invoke the Mary Sue for no reason.  tl;dr: Plenty of notches left to tone it down."
starwarsrebels,2ylo86,RealVoltar,2,Wed Mar 11 15:21:21 2015 UTC,"She's underdeveloped as a character, I know, I was just pointing out that the Stormtroopers in this have been established as incompetent, they will miss and fail in general. That's not even something exclusive to this show, as they were like this in the original trilogy as well."
starwarsrebels,2ylo86,Nihillo,4,Wed Mar 11 21:27:52 2015 UTC,", as they were like this in the original trilogy as well.   They certainly were not.    With the exception of the ground battle on the forest moon of Endor, the Stormtroopers are perfectly competent in the OT.  Let's look at their track record:  Star Wars   the Tantive 4 is overwhelmed quickly and efficiently despite the Rebels being entrenched against them.  Very few stormtroopers fall compared to the rebels. Murder a bunch of people and do a pretty darn good job blaming it on others. Obi-Wan knows what's up but he's a Jedi, so he oughta know. they are under orders to let our heroes escape the Death Star.  They do an excellent job of convincing everyone but Leia, who knows how 'easy"" it was for them. The TIE pilots seem as capable asthe rebel pilots. Possibly even a bit better, considering they were winning even before Vader showed up to hasten things along.  Luke saved the day via will of the Force.   Empire Strikes Back   Battle of Hoth, 'nuff said. Han manages to evade some TIEs.  But they give a hell of a lot of trouble.  Their inexperience with flying through hazardous places allows him to escape, whereas if they hadn't lucked into the ""asteroid field"" (quotations because asteroid fields are nothing like that) Han was praying he could make repairs quickly enough to save them... an unlikely event. Cloud city, they had orders to corral Luke to meet with Vader.  They succeeded. Due to the betrayal of Calrissian, the outnumbered (and ambushed) stormtroopers allowed Leia and the wookie to escape.   Return of the Jedi   ... okay.  They pretty much suck in this movie.  Apparently, stormtroopers just can't handle being close to Ewoks.  They actually do really well when they are only contending with the Rebel strike team, but the fucking ewoks save the day.   Regardless, RoJ aside, the stormtroopers did their job and they did it pretty well throughout the OT."
starwarsrebels,2ylo86,Vratix,2,Sat Mar 14 22:03:11 2015 UTC,"Tantive 4: that's the 501st, they are the elite division of the Empire, there is a difference between troopers garrisoning a backwater outer rim planet and the ones accompanying Darth Vader on an assault. Besides, there weren't any main characters on scene, apparently their chances to miss are increased when aiming at a main character.  Death Star: are you saying they intentionally missed every shot on Han, Luke and Leia because they wanted to let them go? I'm sorry, but I don't believe that, you don't need 5 people to fly a ship, they could have easily just killed most of them and let one or two escape so that they would lead them to the Alliance's base. That is definitely a case of incompetence, in fact, that's where the term ""Stormtrooper effect"" came from.  TIE pilots: I never said they were incompetent. I agree that they are pretty skilled, all things considered.  Hoth: it was the walkers that won the battle, not the troops, we barely even get to see the Snowtroopers.  Cloud City: they seem pretty incompetent to me.  Endor: I'll even help you out on this one, they hit Leia pretty good and stopped her and Han from breaking into the bunker. They were also supposedly 501st, but that didn't stop them from failing horribly, which means that everything that I said at the beginning of this comment is kinda meaningless. That whole battle is pretty inconsistent with the rest of the movies, regardless of what our stance is."
starwarsrebels,2ylo86,Nihillo,3,Sat Mar 14 23:54:57 2015 UTC,"Tantive 4: that's the 501st   I don't think there's been any sort of confirmation of that since the disney reboot.  On top of that it's unlikely.  Clones aging the way they do, since Anakin's unit was specifically called out as the 501st in TCW (only official existence of the 501st, afaik), they would be the equivalent of regular humans in their late 60s. Much more likely they were just part of the crew of that Star Destroyer.   are you saying they intentionally missed every shot on Han, Luke and Leia because they wanted to let them go?   I'm not saying it.  Tarkin said it. Explicitly.  It's not like any of the imperials knew which one the pilot was, and since being a pilot-for-hire is a job here they can't assume that more than one of them is a capable pilot.  Do you really want to be the guy that fucked up Vader's plan by killing the only pilot?   Cloud City: they seem pretty incompetent to me.     For the most part, they're trying to charge down an open hallway against trained opponents firing from behind cover.  Yes, they lose some men (I think 4-5), but they continue advancing at a pace faster than our heroes are retreating.  You really can't expect much more from anyone in that scenario (anyone who doesn't have magic powers)."
starwarsrebels,2ylo86,Vratix,1 point,Sun Mar 15 00:14:59 2015 UTC,"501st: actually the 501st stopped being a clone legion once the Empire stopped cloning people on Kamino, by 0BBY they were naturally born humans who excelled at their job, and were assigned to Darth Vader's command. That's the old canon, I'll concede that much, but there are elite troops in the new continuity, Tarkin brought his own when he came to Lothal (they can be easily identified by the black pauldrons they wear), so it is likely that Vader would be accompanied by his own elite.  Death Star: every single one of them can pilot a ship though, it's like the Star Wars equivalent of driving a car, it's just that neither Obi-wan nor Luke owned a ship, that's why they needed Han. I insist on my point that the imperials didn't have to spare all of them, Vader himself killed Obi-wan, and for all they knew, he could have been the pilot, he was known to fly a fighter in the Clone Wars after all. Even if they didn't know he was Obi-wan, they surely figured out that he was a Jedi once the lightsaber came out, and Jedi are pilots. Vader fucked up the plan, by this logic.  Cloud City: they didn't check their corners, they displayed poor marksmanship (as always), they didn't intercept the rebels in the Falcon's landing pad, they advanced in a fast pace towards their deaths."

starwarsrebels,2ylo86,pepoluan,7,Sun Mar 22 16:10:04 2015 UTC,"Good assessment, covers pretty much all the bases.  On Ezra, I'd say it's okay for him to be a bit underdeveloped at this point. You have to remember he's 14, I feel like his personality and expressiveness have matched up to that. I'd also say that so far this show is really about him, in much the same way The Clone Wars was about Ahsoka, we'll be watching him develop and grow and likely end up with a very fleshed out and mature character at the end of this.  Sabine definitely needs some work, as stated her abilities probably need to be toned down a notch and she needs more to her than just ""punk Mando chick"". We learned that she was in the Imperial Academy and that something happened that made her not only leave, but also develop some tough trust issues. I imagine that was planted for the purpose of diving into more of it later on, but with Season 2 already looking busy I hope there's time for it. Also as a side note, I'd actually like to see Ezra and Sabine have a thing. (Again drawing parallels) It almost happened with Ahsoka, but stopped because she was a Jedi. With Kanan as his master it's obvious Ezra's learning has been different so far, and we all know Kanan doesn't exactly follow the whole ""no attachments"" thing very well. Students often reflect their masters.  Totally agreed on Hera, Chopper, and Zeb, though I'd like to see a bit more getting really into Zeb. He works well as Star Wars Jayne, but I think he can be more. I'm hoping for Kallus to get some development because he has that aura of cool about him and I think it'd be a waste for him to just be ""asshole antagonist commander"". Also really hoping Tarkin and Vader have some power house moments. Tarkin was handled really well in the few episodes we got at the end of this season, I'd love for the two of them to seriously wreck things up next season as well (which I feel is being alluded to with all the Delta Base Zero references)."
starwarsrebels,2ylo86,Revangeance,1 point,Wed Mar 11 02:21:49 2015 UTC,"Okay you touch on something I've been wondering. I've gotten the impression that Kaanan and Hera are in a relationship (pretty sure she called him ""Love"" a couple of times) but they haven't been obvious enough with it for me to be positive. They don't seem very affectionate; I would have expected her to be all over Kaanan in the finally after they escaped for example."
starwarsrebels,2ylo86,durtycurdy,12,Sat May 2 19:28:05 2015 UTC,"100% agree with your assessments of Sabine and Ezra.  Sabine's acrobatics in the finale were definitely Jedi-level and silly, and that does make the actual Jedi a little less special.  I generally like her character and love the idea of a female Mandalorian, but she needs development and growth.  Yes, Ezra looks and acts too much like Aladdin.  I keep expecting him to sing ""One Jump Ahead"" or ""A Whole New World"".  Hoping to see a more mature side of him in S2, and I think that's reasonable/expected."
starwarsrebels,2ylo86,Matsuyama_Mamajama,4,Tue Mar 10 21:39:35 2015 UTC,"I'm more or less with you on most of that.  Mary Subine is a wasted character and even though I don't share the Ezra aversion, he seems redundant in the saga overall (maybe Ahsoka had a vision of Luke and is mistaking Ezra for him, who knows).  I'm hoping Kallus gets something out of Tarkin to expand his character.  Chopper sometimes goes a little too far with the, ""loveable psychopathy.""  Zeb's just a filler character to me atm (I don't entirely buy the correlation but I wasn't a big fan of Jayne, either).  Hera's being weirdly handled.  I'm sure we'll get something more after Lords of the Sith comes out.  I suppose it's possible they were saving her for season 2 but...ya know...make an action figure and put her in group shots and shit.  Weird.  This last episode definitely got me excited for Last Padawan."
starwarsrebels,2ylo86,RealVoltar,3,Wed Mar 11 08:17:48 2015 UTC,"Sabine - I think that this character needs a lot of work. Her powers are all over the place. She's basically got Jedi powers, which weakens the threat of the Stormtroopers and makes the Jedi not special. She jumps around and performs physical acts that are unnatural and jarring. This was worst in the finale where she's dancing through blaster fire while insulting the ""bucketheads"".   Spot. The Fuck. On.  I had the same reactions.  Hell, I almost turned the episode off at that point (even worse, if you look at where the blaster bolts impact, some of them would have had to pass through her).   The Inquisitor - I think he's one of the best villains the series has created since Cad Bane and Hando and one of the best straight-threats since Darth Maul.    Don't you put those other talentless fools on a level with my boy Hondo.  The episodes featuring Hondo were, imo, the most enjoyable TCW episodes.  Otherwise, I also am glad he's dead rather than losing over and over the way Kallus does.  I really liked Kallus the first few episodes, but then they neutered him into a mutton-chopped stormtrooper.  I basically agree with the gist of everything you said, I guess I just felt those needed replies for emphasis beyond a mere upvote."

Some minor observations:  At 45 seconds in, I see you showed the Jedi Temple, because of the song, but I would suggest showing the Lothal temple instead. Only because during that time in period, the former Jedi temple on Coruscant is the Emperor's Palace. After the Clone Wars he transformed it, and made his throne room in the council chamber...  Second, interesting choice of music. I have not heard it before.  Lastly, the audio at the very end, where Kanan speaks to Ezra is really quiet, and I couldn't hear it. I could hear Ben talking.

The first time I noticed it a few years ago I was simply amazed that it wasn't reduced to a pile of bricks http://www.dvdcc.com/images/misc/swdvdcaps/rotj-jeditemple.jpg)  And yes, the audio at the end got f***ed somehow... I could hear it ok with headphones on, and it was deacent in the original file.

All that remained of the original temple was its quincunx of skyscraping spires, which crowned an amalgam of blockish edifices with sloping façades. (...) However, some nine years later, the former Jedi Kanan Jarrus recalled that nothing of the Temple remained, and that the Empire had reduced all its brick and steel to dust.[11] Nonetheless, the Jedi Temple remained intact after the death of Darth Sidious during the Battle of Endor.[12]"

starwarsrebels,2yjjls,rsixidor,2,Tue Mar 17 19:56:11 2015 UTC,CONFIRMED Plot for Star Wars Episode VII
starwarsrebels,2yjjls,diamondcreeper,13,Tue Mar 17 20:10:27 2015 UTC,TCW was cancelled at the buyout because Cartoon Network owned distribution rights.  Why would Disney pay for another network to air its shows?   Rebels is very well done.  Watch the first few episodes.  Then decide.
starwarsrebels,2yjjls,BlueSmoke95,3,Tue Mar 10 13:30:11 2015 UTC,"Originally I was turned off by the art style but I kept seeing images and clips of the show and that got me interested and since I am a ""sucker"" for star wars I decided to watch it and now I absolutely love it. I agree with the suggestions in other comments but one thing that I would suggest would be to show them a clip of rebels that shows why people should give the show a shot because people may not want to watch a few episodes to decide whether of not to continue the series."
starwarsrebels,2yjjls,legoadam,3,Tue Mar 10 14:58:11 2015 UTC,"You tell them that there are plenty of Star Wars (not just Clone Wars) references and appearances for them to enjoy.  Like the cameo in ""Idiot's Array"", and the hints on advancing the Empire's tech toward Episode IV levels.  Very fun to watch as a fan of Star Wars in general."
starwarsrebels,2yjjls,Panoramic_Vacuum,1 point,Tue Mar 10 14:39:23 2015 UTC,I for one got excited every time the republic police gunship/imperial patrol gunship and the Gozanti Cruisers.  There's also a bit where you can see the very front part of a republic gunship.  If they like ships from The Clone Wars maybe that will help them. I enjoyed the character cameos but also immensely enjoyed this sort of cameo as well.
starwarsrebels,2yjjls,rsixidor,3,Tue Mar 17 19:13:06 2015 UTC,It is hard if not impossible for me to imagine someone loving clone wars and not watching Star Wars rebels

Tell them how much it sucks and how fun it is to watch how bad it is, and let the epiphany come to them on its own."
starwarsrebels,2yjjls,suss2it,3,Tue Mar 10 21:23:42 2015 UTC,Makes sense that the best way to trick Star Wars into watching something is telling them how awful it is.
starwarsrebels,2yjjls,zackmanze,1 point,Thu Mar 12 01:44:29 2015 UTC,"Can't really read the tone of your response, but I'm referring to the really bizarre Clone Wars fans I've seen on Reddit.  The kind who hated Rebels before they ever saw a minute of it, and probably initially did the same thing with Clone Wars.  The kind of people who want something to suck so they can feel vindicated somehow."
starwarsrebels,2yjjls,suss2it,2,Thu Mar 12 02:58:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was sarcastically referencing those types."
starwarsrebels,2yjjls,ImNotASWFanboy,2,Thu Mar 12 03:17:33 2015 UTC,Because Rebels has better written characters and is more fun?  I have yet to get mad at Rebels in the same way that I got mad about TCW at times.

starwarsrebels,2yjjls,Ashe_SDMF,2,Fri Mar 13 03:16:00 2015 UTC,"It's no worse than rocks being hurled at Stormtroopers on Endor in slings. At least it's electrical, or seems as if theres some sort of other power behind it. And besides, his Sling shot is pretty much disregarded by any enemy that isn't a stormtrooper."
starwarsrebels,2yjjls,Ball-Blam-Burglerber,2,Fri Mar 13 03:20:05 2015 UTC,I tell them it feels like Starwars. Where as the Clone Wars feels like the the NT with all the political stuff going on Rebels feels much like the OT.
starwarsrebels,2yjjls,RealVoltar,2,Sat Mar 14 20:11:05 2015 UTC,Go ahead and tell them who Fulcrum is.
starwarsrebels,2yjjls,Shackled_Form,1 point,Tue Mar 10 21:05:17 2015 UTC,I even gave up on trying to get friends into TCW.  It's true that it would be nice to have that to talk about but it' not like they're hurting you by being obstinate.

starwarsrebels,2yigb8,AnEwokRedditor,13,Tue Mar 10 02:54:28 2015 UTC,"You can't have Star Wars without the main protagonist getting at least one permanent injury, so yeah, it's here to stay. I wouldn't be surprised if he had a gauze pad or something on for at least part of the season 2 premiere."
starwarsrebels,2yigb8,quodpossumus,8,Tue Mar 10 03:54:07 2015 UTC,"Didn't Anakin get his scar from a lightsaber injury as well? That would be a credible precedent, so I would say yes.  I wonder what the scar will mean to him, he could have died then (if we ignore the fact that he is the protagonist), what could have he done differently? When Qui-gon Jinn was slain by Darth Maul, Obi-wan completely dropped the aggressive fighting style preferred by his master, and specialized in the defensive Soresu instead, that fight clearly had a profound effect on him, so I wonder if this duel will affect Ezra's choices as he develops as a Jedi."
starwarsrebels,2yigb8,Nihillo,3,Tue Mar 10 07:50:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, from Asajj.  Not sure if that's still cannon."

starwarsrebels,2yigb8,HarveyRSpecter,1 point,Mon Mar 16 06:12:53 2015 UTC,Basically no. The novelizations are canon where they line up with the movies.
starwarsrebels,2yigb8,TheDidact118,2,Mon Mar 16 06:30:07 2015 UTC,where can you see the spec sheets?
starwarsrebels,2yigb8,smokey_sunrise,6,Tue Mar 10 06:25:57 2015 UTC,"When you think about the color scheme + disney, Ezra does have a lot in common with Scar..."
starwarsrebels,2yigb8,FrankiePoops,1 point,Tue Mar 10 14:43:47 2015 UTC,Hahaha.  Nice.
starwarsrebels,2yigb8,zackmanze,5,Tue Mar 10 13:47:17 2015 UTC,"I care less about the scar and more about your amazing idea of time advancing. Imagine that. Less filler, and jump to say a year or two later, a semblance of a rebel fleet, a rebel council with Mon Mothma and whomever they deem de or recanonized. Winning some battles, losing some more.   Perhaps they could avoid retreading some of the Death Star plan stuff, focus on bolstering the rebel ranks. Sympathetic but somewhat dodgy exseparatists from CW anyone?"
starwarsrebels,2yigb8,iscarioto,13,Tue Mar 10 21:32:34 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree.  Rebel cells do not a rebellion make.  I expect season 2 will focus on them becoming the rebellion: what unites them, what divides them, who risks what and for what, and for those who fought in the last war... are they ready to fight the next one?  Oh yes.  And they do not know how to win a war.  Tarkin was quite right, and the Ghost crew's course of action in the finale, while admirable and all, does demonstrate that.  The great difficulty is this: the rebels will need to learn how to win a war without becoming the thing they seek to destroy or destroying the thing they seek to protect.... (It was easier with rebellions like the one in Onderon, where it was one world and the goal was restoring what was there before.  This rebellion involves a galaxy of deeply divided planets, and the republic did a less than brilliant job at managing their common interests.)  This seems like the next place to go, honestly.  A time skip might, ironically make it feel more like filler.  Better we learn these new relationships with the crew through action and struggle than them already be established by years of ""stuff"" and thus have more dedicated ""group dynamics"" episodes like Fighter Flight and Out of Darkness so that the audience can learn them too."
starwarsrebels,2yigb8,LionFox,1 point,Tue Mar 10 04:44:06 2015 UTC,"I think you're right about a lot of this. I think we can absolutely expect an empire like shift in scale, scope, and tone, and that a time jump of some extent is a very safe bet."
starwarsrebels,2yigb8,zackmanze,2,Tue Mar 10 06:26:42 2015 UTC,"Ever since Mark Hamill had his car accident and jacked his face up, it's become a SW thing for the hero character to wear a scar as evidence of passing trials."
starwarsrebels,2yigb8,RealVoltar,2,Wed Mar 11 02:04:57 2015 UTC,"I hope and think so, yeah.    I also expect the character's costumes, and potentially hairstyles to change with each season.  Along with Color Palette.    Basically, expect Empire."
starwarsrebels,2yigb8,zackmanze,2,Tue Mar 10 07:48:37 2015 UTC,"I can't be certain, but I think that one of the scars came from the Inquisitors blade and the other from Kanan's blade which of course Ezra is holding at the time. He has literally been marked by both the Light side and the Dark side alluding to the fact that both paths will come with inherent danger. Live by the saber, die by the saber?"
starwarsrebels,2yeva1,curlytoot,7,Mon Mar 9 05:05:07 2015 UTC,"One of the first things about the season finale that jumped out to me was Kiner's musical reference to the 2003 CW series! The title of this episode is a direct quote from Yoda's opening monologue in the 2003 series, and the music (""Bounty Hunter's Pursuit"") that accompanied that first episode all those years ago was reprised here. Brilliant work on Kiner's part."
starwarsrebels,2yeva1,Lambent_Light,7,Mon Mar 9 05:07:19 2015 UTC,Did anyone notice Bariss? What I loved about this show is how powerful they made Grievous appear and how feared even jedi were of him.
starwarsrebels,2yeva1,Matsuyama_Mamajama,4,Tue Mar 10 00:50:46 2015 UTC,"I remember watching this when it first came out, because I loved Genndy Tartakovsky from Dexter's Laboratory and especially Samurai Jack.

starwarsrebels,2ygxoq,Teletoa,6,Mon Mar 9 18:59:37 2015 UTC,I don't quite understand. Mind explaining a little bit?
starwarsrebels,2ygxoq,GobbleBotGaming,3,Mon Mar 9 19:14:17 2015 UTC,"Sure, and it may be far fetched, but the design of the Tie's windshield in addition to its centered placement behind Hera during much of the speech mirrors imagery of Mary and her halo. There's probably no deeper meaning, but I thought the imagery was worth discussion."
starwarsrebels,2ygxoq,Brownling,6,Mon Mar 9 19:19:01 2015 UTC,"If intentional, then props to the Rebels team for the most creative use of a Tie's windshield I've ever seen."
starwarsrebels,2ygxoq,SharkMassacre,3,Mon Mar 9 19:03:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think this was intentional, but it does make for some interesting discussion. I'm sure you could pick through Rebels and find all kinds of similarities and inspirations from other books, games, movies, etc. Unlike more mature shows though, I don't think there is any true deeper meaning in the way the characters and the scenes are presented."
starwarsrebels,2ygxoq,RealVoltar,9,Mon Mar 9 19:14:10 2015 UTC,"Obviously I can't be 100% certain they were alluding to the depiction of Mary shown, but I'd say this was an intentional framing of the character to emphasize her role as a 'Mother of the rebellion.' People forget that every single detail in an animated production is the result of calculated planning and all the imagery has a purpose in relation to the story. The group at Rebels is masterful in how they speak volumes without saying directly. Do not underestimate the power of Filoni."
starwarsrebels,2ygxoq,Clonetrooperkev,2,Mon Mar 9 19:41:44 2015 UTC,Marvelous way to put it. Excellent input.
starwarsrebels,2ygxoq,Matsuyama_Mamajama,1 point,Mon Mar 9 19:50:00 2015 UTC,"I agree, I would not bet on some deeper meaning. In terms of intention though, I can't help but enjoy imagery connecting ""the mother of the Rebel team"" to a ""holy mother."" I thought it was a very flattering and fitting depiction of hera's character and responsibility. Thanks for the input!"
starwarsrebels,2ygxoq,capncoke,2,Mon Mar 9 19:24:47 2015 UTC,I completely missed it and I'm not familiar with other SW Madonna imagery either; interesting idea.

starwarsrebels,2yd7b8,JSK23,3,Mon Mar 9 03:17:22 2015 UTC,I've heard May or October.  Not sure which as nothing official has been announced that I know of.
starwarsrebels,2yd7b8,BlueSmoke95,2,Sun Mar 8 20:16:02 2015 UTC,They announced months ago that they were going to show the two part finale followed by the season 2 premier at Celebration this year.
starwarsrebels,2yd7b8,FrankiePoops,2,Mon Mar 9 11:41:56 2015 UTC,"Something like that, yeah. There is no confirmation, but they have often compared the show to the original trilogy, in terms of narrative structuring (each season is equivalent to one of the OT movies) so it would be at least 3, and I'm pretty sure I've seen Dave Filoni mention 4 seasons when talking about how many they have planned."
starwarsrebels,2yd7b8,Nihillo,1 point,Mon Mar 9 02:58:01 2015 UTC,So season 2 will be Empire Strikes back.

starwarsrebels,2y8265,tonuchi,1 point,Sun Mar 8 22:03:05 2015 UTC,I wonder if maybe he was the first character modeled and they improved their process but felt they couldn't go back and update him with all the marketing material out there. Maybe season 2 they can circle back on it.
starwarsrebels,2y8265,zombiejeebus,1 point,Sun Mar 8 22:29:05 2015 UTC,"I'll admit I like the way there bodies move more: hair, face muscles, etc. TCW's static bodies were sometimes jarring- especially in the earlier seasons.   But his hair seems tentacle-y. Sabine's however is much more controlled.   I hope they find someway in transitioning his character model in a way that it still looks like him.   Hmmm... I hate the padawan braid but it might be an easy way for a haircut."
starwarsrebels,2y8265,tonuchi,1 point,Sun Mar 8 23:40:57 2015 UTC,As with a lot of CGI TV shows the people look kinda iffy at best but the scenery and vehicles tend to look real good

starwarsrebels,2y8265,NarcolepticDraco,9,Sun Mar 8 01:41:56 2015 UTC,"This right here. Immediately when comparing shots from TCW and Rebels, you feel that the TCW characters look more real in their skin tone, lighting and mannerisms. And this applies especially for the stormtroopers. The bloody armor lights up like a snowy afternoon and looks waayyyyy too shiny."
starwarsrebels,2y8265,shikhargpt,8,Sun Mar 8 01:50:23 2015 UTC,"I also dislike the lack of detail on a lot of the world models. TCW models were so detailed, intricate, and gritty looking that they looked like they could be part of a real environment. Just like the movies. In SWR everything looks so clean and shiny. Compare the Republic star destroyers and cruisers to the Imperial star destroyers and cruisers for example.  Republic star destroyer in TCW  Imperial star destroyer in SWR  I didn't like everything about the TCW art style but I felt it captured the visual essence of the Star Wars movies in a way SWR hasn't."

starwarsrebels,2y927m,Sapitoelgato,9,Sat Mar 7 17:18:04 2015 UTC,"Reasons to still be located on Lothal in addition to what you stated:   They know Lothal. They know how the imps there operate and can exploit that They care about the locals. Why just abandon them to the Empire now? They have always been in contact with Fulcrum all along. At least I see it as Hera had been. I might be wrong, but she has been in contact and taking missions from Fulcrum then it's possible is where the greater Rebel movements need them. They are the Lothal cell.   I would like to see them spend more time off Lothal, but I'm really happy for it to be a home base so speak."

starwarsrebels,2y927m,Nihillo,2,Sun Mar 8 22:52:21 2015 UTC,"The true, IRL, ""out of universe"" reason? Because most of the assets (models, textures, effects, ambient lighting, and so on) that they have developed so far were made to fit Lothal, that's also one of the main IRL reasons why season 1 took place almost entirely on Lothal.   They probably have developed more stuff since the start of the series, so we will probably see new planets soon, but I wouldn't be surprised if they re-used some of the Lothal stuff in other planets too."

starwarsrebels,2y927m,RealVoltar,2,Mon Mar 9 12:40:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for pointing that out.  Yes I believe the civil unrest will be dealt with swiftly.  Is that the primary reason for Vader's visit, or because of Kanan and Ezra?"
starwarsrebels,2y927m,TheTurnipKnight,1 point,Mon Mar 9 15:30:15 2015 UTC,"I think the primary reason for Vader's visit is to become the guy that seems to be leading the military against the RA in a few years, now that the RA has appeared.  I don't think Vader's a replacement character (there's rumors about that already) so much as he appears as a counterbalance to the Alliance part of the RA.  So we'll likely not see a whole lot of coordination between the rebel cells but when we do, there will be a Vader or a Tarkin (or both if we're lucky.  Don't deny the bromance, it's real)."

starwarsrebels,2y6st2,brew_,11,Fri Mar 6 23:31:23 2015 UTC,"If this is true, and she is a new character based on a popular old one, then it gives credence to the whole ""Kanan is Kyle Katarn, and Hera is Jan Ors"" theory. I'm cool with that, can't wait for the new Thrawn."
starwarsrebels,2y6st2,Nihillo,6,Sat Mar 7 02:05:24 2015 UTC,"Some concept art a while back had agent Kallus with blue skin. If he is being set up to come back in the new movies as a thrawn-like villain, I might splooge all over the movie theater."
starwarsrebels,2y6st2,Vidiculous,5,Sat Mar 7 02:23:04 2015 UTC,"I always felt like Kanan was closer to a younger, inexperienced Rahm Kota. Especially with Ezra's Force-potential and struggle between light and dark."
starwarsrebels,2y6st2,nightmare901,4,Sat Mar 7 02:31:11 2015 UTC,"I don't know how to feel about this. I adore Mara Jade, so any chance to see some version of her carried on into canon is welcome, but on the other hand I don't know if I really WANT that. I loved Mara Jade as she was, not sure what to think of some twisted new adaptation of her character...  Then again, I wasn't sure how I felt about the introduction of Ahsoka back with Clone Wars and now she's, by far, one of my favorite characters. A badass Lady Inq inspired by Jade could be awesome."
starwarsrebels,2y6st2,The5Virtues,4,Sat Mar 7 15:35:58 2015 UTC,"I think it'll really depend on how they portray the character. If she shows up and she feels like a cheap Mara Jade copy/imitation, then it'll definitely suck. If she shows up and can stand on her own two feet as an interesting character with concepts and ideas adapted from the Mara Jade story for the new canon, I think it'll feel ok =)"
starwarsrebels,2y6st2,Skyskinner,2,Sun Mar 8 08:54:33 2015 UTC,"It just doesn't really seem necessary to me. Part of what I really enojyed about Mara Jades character was her relationship with Luke Skywalker in the Thrawn books. She's still a bad ass character on her own, but I feel like if they just have a wild redhead with maybe a purple lightsaber I'd be a little let down. I'd rather just be introduced to a brand new character and leave Mara out. Maybe they'll be able to pull it off, so I'll reserve my doubts. I've definitely enjoyed the characters so far."
starwarsrebels,2y6st2,feebos,3,Mon Mar 9 06:50:31 2015 UTC,"This is somewhat unlikely, keep in mind that if they do intend to make her Mara Jade, then she's too young to actually be that character. Mara would be 12 years old during Rebels. I highly doubt Palpatine would be sending preteens out to do his bidding, so it's either not Mara Jade, or it's a character so loosely based on her that it might as well not be her."
starwarsrebels,2y6st2,Iokuas,4,Sun Mar 8 15:19:00 2015 UTC,That would be absolutely awesome if they made Mara Jade canon again. She's one of my favorite characters from the EU.
starwarsrebels,2y6st2,TradocTanker,2,Sat Mar 7 00:08:20 2015 UTC,"I have no major complaints about the idea but I'm just curious what it is about the character that makes her an adaptation of Mara Jade. I don't think red hair and a purple lightsaber would be enough for me to consider her related.  If Kanan and Hera are the reimagination of Kyle Katarn and Jan Ors for instance, that's not close enough to consider this the same character.  Even though Vanessa voiced both."
starwarsrebels,2y6st2,RealVoltar,-3,Mon Mar 9 12:48:01 2015 UTC,"Umm... no. If you want to do Mara Jade, then just DO Mara Jade. The only way I like this is if she is just using an alias and is really Mara Jade. Otherwise it feels like a slap in the face to the Legends EU."
starwarsrebels,2y6st2,ilikecakeeating,14,Sat Mar 7 02:24:56 2015 UTC,"Well, think about it this way, if you just bring a character from the original EU in, then you're also bringing all of the expectations involving her to the story, people will wonder ""well, will she marry Luke? Is the Emperor an ever present force in her thoughts? Will she be killed by one of the Solo children?"" It would create an incongruence, which would be very similar to what we had previously in the Clone Wars series, and I get the feeling that they want to prevent that. This is a new canon, a new story, which needs new characters."
starwarsrebels,2y6st2,Nihillo,7,Sat Mar 7 02:58:36 2015 UTC,"I can't find it, but shortly after the ""new canon"" was announced, once of the producers of VII or even maybe Leland Chee said something very similar to why we most likely won't see some of the EU characters in the new canon. He also mentioned that it is very possible we may see characters INSPIRED by some of our favorite EU characters. So we might see someone who resembles Mara Jade, but NOT Mara Jade."
starwarsrebels,2y6st2,OSUTechie,4,Sat Mar 7 03:18:13 2015 UTC,Imagine how much of a downer it'd be if Jacen Solo was in the new films.  Every fan who knew about the EU would be waiting for him to turn which would either lead to a bunch of fans being disappointed when he doesn't or the most lacklustre plot twist in history.  Jacen Solo went evil?  Who could have seen that coming except every fan of the EU...  Also means people are going in with certain expectations of certain characters which can only be a bad thing.
starwarsrebels,2y6st2,MintyFreshNipples,2,Sun Mar 8 21:04:37 2015 UTC,"I do understand what you mean about the expectations that would go along with a Legends character. And I think what I would rather see is that they just leave those characters that can't be brought into the new story group canon just be left alone. OR bring in characters based on them but DON'T let it be known that they are based on them. Then any simililarities seem like cool little nods to legends. Saying the character is based on Mara Jade will make me think about Legends Mara Jade every time she is on screen and detract from the new character.  All that said, I look forward to seeing what they do with the character. Oh, and my daughter is named after Mara Jade!"
starwarsrebels,2y6st2,ilikecakeeating,1 point,Sat Mar 7 16:10:22 2015 UTC,"OR bring in characters based on them but DON'T let it be known that they are based on them.    Yeah, if this rumor is true, then someone effed up by revealing that she's supposed to be Mara Jade. I wish I didn't read the spoiler about how she is introduced to the series as well, should have stopped reading once I knew what I wanted to know."

starwarsrebels,2y59bb,binarycoder,7,Fri Mar 6 23:34:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with Filoni on this one, I just can't see him saving the Inquisitor, he's a Jedi and he's supposed to have compassion, but that just wasn't going to happen. Kanan helps him up and then what? They can't imprison him, that would attract attention, he's not going to join the rebellion either, and letting him go is a stupid idea for a variety of reasons.  I was more curious as to whether he was going to kill him or just kind of... stand there, waiting for him to get tired and fall on his own. That would have been awkward."
starwarsrebels,2y59bb,Nihillo,15,Sat Mar 7 02:17:42 2015 UTC,If I had to guess? Vader and the Emperor. They aren't exactly kind to those who fail them.
starwarsrebels,2y59bb,nightmare901,13,Fri Mar 6 19:25:18 2015 UTC,It's probably having your force ghost turn into Hayden Christensen - jk
starwarsrebels,2y59bb,smokey_sunrise,7,Fri Mar 6 17:53:26 2015 UTC,What would be worse than death?  Being killed and cloned and killed and cloned again for repeated failures.   See Bevil Lemelisk (sp?). Guy helped develop super weapons for the Empire.
starwarsrebels,2y59bb,AusSco,2,Fri Mar 6 19:32:43 2015 UTC,"Just after Ezra falls off bridge and Kanan believes him to be dead  Kanan: ""that was a mistake""  Inquisitor: ""why? because you have no one left to die for you?""  Kanan: ""no, because I have nothing left to fear!""   Later, while Inquisitor is hanging from the platform  Inquisitor: ""there are some things far more frightening than death""   I took this this to mean that while Kanan was only focused on his fear of death or death to those around him, eluded to while being interrogated and reminded of Billaba's final words to him, that he has yet to realize the powers of the dark side.  The inquisitor's death serves as a reminder that those who know, would rather die than face Vader, or even worse, the Emperor, and fear of death is the last thing to be concerned with."
starwarsrebels,2y59bb,capncoke,2,Sun Mar 8 18:43:13 2015 UTC,Anyone noticed that the quote is a reference to Jafar from Aladdin?

starwarsrebels,2y59bb,VegetaLF7,3,Sun Mar 8 03:15:11 2015 UTC,stahp.
starwarsrebels,2y59bb,Cern_Stormrunner,2,Sun Mar 8 03:59:16 2015 UTC,Maybe he means losing the ones he loves?  He probably knows that there are tons of Inquisitors out there and that Vader/Tarkin will use all their power to hunt down the Rebels.  He's probably aware that they are about to face a much bigger threat now that the Empire has began to fully recognize them.
starwarsrebels,2y59bb,blink5694,1 point,Fri Mar 6 22:06:47 2015 UTC,"That bit bothered me slightly, Isn't  the Inquisitor supposed to be some kind of sith or something (a bit like asajj ventress) and isn't one of their guiding principles that they fear death more than anything?  I can see why that is a good death for him from a storytelling perspective (to give him a death on his own terms, to avoid the moral dilemma of the Jedi killing him while telling the audience 'shit is about to get real in season 2 with Vader') but to me it felt a bit anti-climatic, as well as the 'you can't hit me' whirlly move he does right before his lightsaber get's busted. I understand the storytelling need to do that but it felt a bit cheap."
starwarsrebels,2y59bb,lurker093287h,3,Sat Mar 7 16:56:29 2015 UTC,"Inquisitor isn't a Sith. As of right now, the only active Sith are Vader and Palpatine. Asajj, despite her declaration of being a Sith in the 2D Clone Wars, isn't either. Both would be classified as Dark Jedi. Badass and evil, sure, but that's it. Ever Sith is a Dark Jedi, not every Dark Jedi is a Sith."
starwarsrebels,2y59bb,VegetaLF7,1 point,Sun Mar 8 03:14:44 2015 UTC,"Well fair enough, but wasn't ventress basically Dooku's apprentice? I mean until he tried to have her killed.   Also do dark jedi  hate and fear death and seek power like the sith.  Even if he's not technically a sith, going out like that kind of felt out of character from all the stuff he's said previously."
starwarsrebels,2y59bb,lurker093287h,3,Sun Mar 8 03:29:08 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. Dooku was teaching her, but basically was making her into his personal assassin. He never intended for her to become a member of the Sith. Yes, Dark Jedi do have the beginnings of what makes the Sith Sith, but the Sith generally aim for bigger things. To use the Sith Code as an example, power is only the halfway point.  ""Peace is a lie, there is only passion. Through passion I gain strength. Through strength I gain power. Through power I gain victory. Through victory my chains are broken. The Force shall free me.""   Dark Jedi basically just crave power. Sith realize that power for power's sake is useless until you focus it on something. A Dark Jedi will do things for themself. A Sith will do things for the grand plan.  As for the Inquisitor, I feel like his lines there shows that he realizes just how royally screwed he is when Vader and Palpatine find out about his failures. To him, death is preferable than whatever they would do to him. Honestly, I felt it was a great way to remind people just how dangerous Vader and Palps are. Basic storytelling method of introducing an even greater villain is have a lesser one be terrified of crossing them"
starwarsrebels,2y2sah,Mr_Chance,21,Thu Mar 5 23:14:03 2015 UTC,"The whole fight reminds me of the Phantom Menace fight. You've got the platforms, the master and apprentice getting separated, a sith user with a double bladed lightsaber, etc."

starwarsrebels,2y2sah,shikhargpt,2,Fri Mar 6 09:21:48 2015 UTC,"I just literally re-watched that scene, and yeah Obi sees Qui go down, Kanan sees Ezra go down, they both pop off."
starwarsrebels,2y2sah,Lyndell,1 point,Sat Mar 7 05:59:14 2015 UTC,That was the first thing I thought of when I saw this. I just wish there was a little more of Ezra & Kanan fighting the Inquisitor together rather than one being pushed back and then the other fights then rinse and repeat.
starwarsrebels,2y2sah,SmokeyPeanutRic,5,Sat Mar 7 22:12:12 2015 UTC,This is great. It adds some gravitas to what was an already powerful scene and it got me all worked up for Episode VII for about the millionth time this year!
starwarsrebels,2y2sah,wfree,4,Fri Mar 6 00:25:00 2015 UTC,"Your sound mix needs work, but otherwise, it's fantastic!"
starwarsrebels,2y2sah,nightmare901,4,Fri Mar 6 06:49:55 2015 UTC,"Cool idea and the execution itself isn't half bad - considering how hard it would be to completely isolate the dialogue and sound effects from the episode footage.  The music for that episode was already quite impressive - it even included a few hints to Duel of the Fates during that fight (mostly just swelling strings and choir, but still). I think that, once again, the goal was to stick to the music of the Original Trilogy, and quite successfully. I always really liked the amped up version of the Force motif and it's put to good use here."
starwarsrebels,2y2sah,FlyinWhee,5,Fri Mar 6 02:50:23 2015 UTC,"Yea, you're right. The original was really good. I loved every second of it. That song was just in my head while I was watching it because the fight was so reminiscent of that epic Darth Maul fight."
starwarsrebels,2y2sah,crazyjackal,4,Fri Mar 6 03:39:47 2015 UTC,"I just realised from this that Kanan is blind (or wise). He is looking directly where Ezra landed, which wasn't that far down, but he either doesn't see him (blind) or does (wise) and knows he no longer has anything to fear because Ezra is safely away."
starwarsrebels,2y2sah,Revangeance,7,Fri Mar 6 11:00:40 2015 UTC,"I can only think of one excuse for that part of the scene. From his angle all he saw was Ezra getting hit with the flying, spinning, double bladed lightsaber and then falling down motionless."
starwarsrebels,2y2sah,Fourteen_of_Twelve,2,Fri Mar 6 17:10:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly, he sees Ezra fall and hit the bridge. Ezra doesn't start moving around until after Kanan has reengaged."

starwarsrebels,2y17u3,5aucy,25,Thu Mar 5 17:43:43 2015 UTC,"In a galaxy that big having only 2 survive the purge was hardly believable and it seems logical that they would be drawn to a rebellion.  I would agree with the OP if they start popping up in timelines that are concurrent with Luke becoming a Jedi - he should be the last hope for the Jedi (more or less).  They need to die, disappear, be shown to be too weak or incompetent to help or in some other way need to be kept away from Luke's turf.  So long as they do that, they can Jedi up the place as much as they like."
starwarsrebels,2y17u3,grogleberry,16,Thu Mar 5 18:02:03 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Yoda and Obi-Wan make sense in the OT.  Kanan, Ezra, and Ahsoka need to be in a similar place by then.  Hanging out with Bail Organa (Leia's adopted father) all the time starts to create some plot holes, especially if they're known as still alive by ANH.  Fortunately, there's some time and it's a big galaxy, so I think it'll be ok."

starwarsrebels,2y17u3,5aucy,3,Fri Mar 6 01:26:11 2015 UTC,That would be too late. If Obi-Wan is Bail and Leia's last hope Kanan/Ezra/Ahsoka all need to be out of the way before then. Cool idea otherwise.

It'd also be a good show of force for Vader and a defining character moment.  If he can kill her it'd show you how far gone he is.   I also imagine Kanan being dead by the final season.

starwarsrebels,2y17u3,Zach_Attack,15,Mon Mar 9 16:20:31 2015 UTC,"It makes sense.  I am going to sit back and see what happens with season 2 first though.  They have already said Ahsoka is unaffiliated, neither Jedi nor Sith.  Maybe Kanan and Ezra will take that same path eventually.  They will be unaffiliated force users no where near trained enough to take on the likes of Vader and Sidious.  Luke is trained by Yoda himself in a Jedi crash course in order to be up to that challenge."
starwarsrebels,2y17u3,mjsmith1223,3,Thu Mar 5 18:49:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, If you read a new dawn Kanan is hardly a Jedi. He may have the force and a saber but his personality and attitude is one not of a Jedi."
starwarsrebels,2y17u3,mastersword130,40,Fri Mar 6 02:12:30 2015 UTC,"Calm down. The Jedi in Rebels are not superheroes. Neither Kanan nor Ahsoka even made it to full Jedi Knight. They're barely scraping by and struggling to defeat two-bit villains. The Inquisitor was a barely-trained lackey who relied on his high-tech saber to give him the advantage, and he was the main villain of the season. Lots of the plots have focused on outwitting small-time criminals and cannon fodder stormtroopers in order to get enough to eat for the day."
starwarsrebels,2y17u3,Mackadal,6,Thu Mar 5 17:26:19 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with barley trained, he not only was able to pick out Kanan's fighting style in about 3 seconds, he was able to tell who trained him. He was well studied in the Force. Vader was presumably his Master, I think the spinning Saber is because most Sith never had an affiliation with the Jedi, they just don't care about traditions or Honor."

He makes it clear that Ahsoka knows how dangerous her position with the Rebellion is. He says she knows when to fight and when to run. He also makes it clear that Ahsoka and Vader will be making in and our appearances for the rest of the series. As far as Kanan is concerned, I don't think the Ghost crew aren't going to be made out as leaders of the rebellion (at least not for awhile). Throughout season one, he is still really hesitant to pull out his lightsaber unless the Inquisitor was around. They didn't even realize there was a larger rebellion until the finale.   I really like there are some Jedi left. There were 10,000 throughout a massive galaxy during the clone wars. Even with Order 66 and 14 years of purging, there has to be a few Jedi that made it into hiding.  Plus, there is something like 9 years before RoTJ takes place. Plenty of time to kill off Kanan, Ezra, and Ahsoka."
starwarsrebels,2y17u3,eth6113,12,Thu Mar 5 19:20:31 2015 UTC,"you make some good points here but remember in ANH the rebellion slogan is ""may the force be with you"" so its obvious they have some jedi roots"
starwarsrebels,2y17u3,thebanester,3,Fri Mar 6 00:40:36 2015 UTC,That exactly what I was thinking. It actually makes a LOT of sense for there have been Jedi help found and form the Rebellion and that that slogan carried on from that.
starwarsrebels,2y17u3,ilikecakeeating,5,Sat Mar 7 17:23:54 2015 UTC,What do you mean Jedi centric rebellion? The only two Jedi we know are in Hera's rebel cell. Neither of them are leading the team. No one else knows Kanan and Ezra are Jedi but the crew.
starwarsrebels,2y17u3,triarii3,4,Fri Mar 6 03:58:46 2015 UTC,"and that one pirate and his crew, and didn't that one holo of them get out?"

starwarsrebels,2y17u3,triarii3,1 point,Sat Mar 7 19:32:27 2015 UTC,I was under the impression he meant Ahsoka.
starwarsrebels,2y17u3,RealVoltar,5,Mon Mar 9 12:57:17 2015 UTC,"What I do like about the Rebels-era Jedi are that they act far less Jedi-ish than the Clone Wars ones swinging lightsabers all over the place and whatnot. Kanan very rarely uses his lightsaber outside of Inquisitor fights and training, and Ezra's lightsaber has gotten far more use as a blaster than it does as a saber. We have yet to see how Ahsoka will act in the show, but judging by her outfit and actions I feel she will be in the same mold. It's likely very few in the fledgling Rebellion (possibly the Ghost's crew included) even realize she's a Jedi. Obviously Bail is an exception."
starwarsrebels,2y17u3,SceptileMasterr,6,Fri Mar 6 03:48:11 2015 UTC,"Just a minor point, didn't the Jedi Council offer Ahsoka a spot back in the order and ascension to Knighthood following the ordeal with Offee, counting that as her trials?"
starwarsrebels,2y17u3,SlowMotionSprint,14,Thu Mar 5 21:44:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, but she said ""Screw you, I'm going to create my own Jedi Council with Hookers and Blackjack! In fact, Forgot the Council!""  /s  But in all seriousness, they did offer her a spot back, but she turned them downing saying they couldn't be trusted."
starwarsrebels,2y17u3,OSUTechie,4,Thu Mar 5 22:39:24 2015 UTC,"Brings up an interesting potential plotline.  Kanan's desperate to lead Ezra down the path of the Jedi but Ahsoka left the Jedi because she didn't trust them.  Anyone thinking there might be some conflict?  Also, I wonder what Ahsoka considers herself to be.  I doubt she thinks of herself as a jedi."
starwarsrebels,2y17u3,MintyFreshNipples,7,Sun Mar 8 21:15:35 2015 UTC,Yup but she told them to shove it right up their Jedi a holes.
starwarsrebels,2y17u3,mastersword130,5,Fri Mar 6 02:13:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's much of a problem. Think about it, neither Kanan nor Ahsoka ever finished their apprenticeship. We've already seen how this affected Kanan; he's insecure, unsure of his abilities, and he doesn't feel qualified to teach the new order of Jedi. He thinks himself a coward for abandoning his Master, and, in many ways, he doesn't consider himself a Jedi. Look at the sabers that he and Ezra use. Ezra's got a gun on his, and Kanan carries his in two pieces. Plus, in the fight with the Inquisitor, he uses tactics no Jedi would ever use, shooting at the Inquisitor. They aren't Jedi, they are just force-users who use lightsabers, and try to help people. Now think about how it must be for Ahsoka. She was, for all intents and purposes, betrayed by the Order, then left to do God knows what for ~16 years. And from what we've seen, she no longer uses her old lightsabers, instead using white-bladed sabers. I don't think she considers herself a Jedi, either. Ultimately, from what we know so far, the force-users in Rebels are more akin to Luke between Episodes 4 and 5. They are a bit more capable than regular soldiers, but the Rebellion doesn't necessarily revolve around them or the Force until Luke gets involved."
starwarsrebels,2y17u3,nightmare901,4,Fri Mar 6 20:28:52 2015 UTC,"nah, I think it's ok so far. If order 66 was the jedi apocalypse, then this is the post-apocalypse jedi waste land."

starwarsrebels,2y17u3,RealVoltar,3,Mon Mar 9 14:33:01 2015 UTC,"I agree with your concerns but I'm willing to take a wait and see attitude. Most of the media depicting the early Rebellion, like the Xwing games, did a great job of showing the Rebels as a group of dedicated individuals from normal backgrounds fighting for freedom. And I think that is very inline with the OT. Making Jedi the heart and leadership of the Rebellion undercuts the main thrust of the struggle. The OT isn't about Jedi vs Sith (not least because no one knew who the Sith were). It's about people fighting for freedom against tyranny. I think if the show remembers that, uses Ashoka sparingly, and most importantly kills her off in this season, we'll be OK."
starwarsrebels,2y17u3,countjared,1 point,Thu Mar 5 22:11:06 2015 UTC,"They're not going to kill her off. No reason for it, she isn't a Jedi nor does she want to be."

Also, we have 3 Jedi on the Rebels side and technically none of them are Jedi masters, but yeah I do get your point that it cheapens the Rebellion story and Luke's a bit, but IMO its worth it for that Kanan vs Inquisitor fight alone."
starwarsrebels,2y17u3,suss2it,6,Thu Mar 5 16:40:05 2015 UTC,"Kanan, ashoka and Ezra aren't Jedi though... Like at all.  Ashoka left when they offered her the Jedi Knight title and told them no. Kanan was a padawan when order 66 happened and spent decades of not using the force and just being a drifter and just drinking and banging a women on each planet and now he's just training a kid to use the force as well.   None of then are Jedi."

starwarsrebels,2xzlra,oakley_fan,2,Thu Mar 5 19:19:21 2015 UTC,The clone wars showed Sidious kidnappings force senstive children and tried to make them his minions. This also comes into Vader's holocall to the inquisitor about turning force sensitive kids or kill them. All these clues scream to me that there is more than just one inquisitor.

Vader would anhilate the Ghost team. Also they are going to be careful to stay true to his character as presented in ANH. Very interesting.  I like that he alludes to the fact that he would really love to have Ashoka appear in a future live action film. I would bet that Disney's approach to that would greatly impact her ultimate fate in the show.

If there's anybody out there who knows what makes Star Wars tick, it's Dave. He bleeds passion for it and it easily shows in both TCW and Rebels. I'm glad that he nixed any crazy Inquisitor survival theories and also the fact that Vader would easily wipe the floor with the Ghost crew. We don't want him being overused and outplayed in season 2. I also laughed at his acknowledgment of the fans who tweaked Fulcrum's voice months ago to get the Ahsoka hype train rolling."

starwarsrebels,2y1dck,joeyesposito,8,Thu Mar 5 16:59:55 2015 UTC,"Hm.  Interesting to speculate.  I don't think it will happen though.  I see Ahsoka as more of a mentor for Kanan that can help him grow as a force user.  Their conversations might be something like this:  Kanan:  So, I'm trying to teach Ezra about xyz.  My master never got around to teaching it to me and what I found on the holocron makes no sense.  It says to ""something something..."".  Ahsoka:  Yeah, about that xyz.  Over the past few years I've learned it's maybe not the best idea.  Maybe focus on abc instead.  Oh, and that stuff on the holocron, take it with a large grain of salt.  It's not all correct.  The Kanan and Hera thing is nice and I see it continuing to grow.  They have history together which draws them closer.  The way Kanan looked at Ahsoka was more surprise that there is someone else out there that survived order 66.  Then, his thoughts may have turned to the question of who else survived if she did?  Really, to complete her training, Ashoka needs a padawan.  She was far ahead of Kanan at the time of order 66 in terms of jedi training, but she still never had a padawan that we know of.  Maybe Kanan will be that padawan.  Kind of like Obi Wan to Anakin while Anakin was teaching Ahsoka."

starwarsrebels,2y1dck,Lanuria,5,Thu Mar 5 19:00:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think Ahsoka would be interested in romance, especially with another (former) Jedi like Kanan."
starwarsrebels,2y1dck,FrankiePoops,2,Thu Mar 5 17:20:45 2015 UTC,"But she was interested in romance, with Lux Bonteri. So it is possible.   Side note, we got FPJ's wife (Sarah Michelle Gellar) joining the cast. Could that be a third love interest?"
starwarsrebels,2y1dck,Lanuria,4,Thu Mar 5 17:46:58 2015 UTC,She was also sixteenish at the time with Lux.   I doubt Ahsoka is concerned with romance at the moment since she's doing stuff with the Rebellion.   And just because they are married off screen doesn't mean they have to play romantic interests on screen.
starwarsrebels,2y1dck,FrankiePoops,0,Thu Mar 5 20:27:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but it'd be fun if they did put Kanan in the middle of a bunch of different women that could be interested in him being that he's a horn dog."

starwarsrebels,2y1dck,Sapitoelgato,2,Fri Mar 6 04:22:12 2015 UTC,"I won't say they will, but I highly doubt it. However, they sort of created love triangles in the other trilogies in a way... For the OT they had Han, Leia, and Luke; however, Lucas made Luke and Leia siblings in the third one to explain the connection they had. For the prequels it was a little more complicated. There was Padmé and Anakin together, but Obi-Wan had a bond between him and Anakin. Nothing sexual, but a strong bond more than brothers. Anakin also lost his mind in Revenge of the Sith and thought Obi-Wan and Padmé were up to something, but that was just his jealously.  I know Kanan thinks strongly of Hera (evident in A New Dawn) and Hera has a connection with him. However, she has more important things to do than entertain those feelings, because anytime any of them can be gone.   As for Ahsoka we don't know anything about her since TCW other than she is a samurai leader type character."
starwarsrebels,2y1dck,Solidan,1 point,Thu Mar 5 17:51:23 2015 UTC,"Not too big on the romance aspect of the show, but I always hate when people (even Vanessa herself) say they are too busy with the rebellion to be a couple. If you can die at any moment, isn't it better to not have any regrets?

starwarsrebels,2y1dck,NoCleverNickname,2,Mon Mar 9 03:57:38 2015 UTC,"I think Kanan and Hera will be OK.  But one thing that isn't being mentioned here is that Ezra totally has the hots for Sabine, but she obviously doesn't feel the same way."

starwarsrebels,2y1dck,Iokuas,2,Fri Mar 6 17:42:36 2015 UTC,I wouldn't expect any love triangle crap. It will probably more of a mentor relationship as Ahsoka was essentially a full fledged Jedi when she left the order. I would expect her to be more of a leader and mentor than anything else.

starwarsrebels,2y03hm,ImNotASWFanboy,4,Thu Mar 5 08:12:05 2015 UTC,"This. And if you read any on the star wars wiki regarding inquisitors, (although I can't remember if that is still canon) they explain that they're kind of a tool to be used by the Sith. They have some of the abilities of a Sith, and in practice they are a Sith in the way a lot if people think of a Sith as someone who uses the Dark Side of the force. But they are not truly Sith due to the rule of two."

starwarsrebels,2y03hm,mastersword130,2,Thu Mar 5 12:47:03 2015 UTC,They are force users and agents of the darkside. Not sith.
starwarsrebels,2y03hm,triarii3,7,Fri Mar 6 04:01:11 2015 UTC,"The inquisitor was trained in the dark side of the force, he was a force sensitive. What is making you confused is that he isn't a sith, there is the rule of two in play and only Vader and Sidious are the sith.  What this means is that the inquisitor won't be taught too much into the dark side and nothing of sith teachings which includes force lighting.  Exactly how he isn't a sith the same can be said about Ashoka, Ventress, Ezra and Kanaan aren't jedi or sith either."
starwarsrebels,2y03hm,mastersword130,3,Thu Mar 5 12:45:42 2015 UTC,"Force lightning is supposed to be a fairly advanced dark side force technique, isn't it?    My guess is that the Inquisitor was recruited as a cadet, and promoted to serve as an inquisitor once his force abilities were discovered. He then got a ton of lightsaber training, and was given a lot of basic information about the Jedi, but he was still just a grunt as far the Sith Lords were concerned.   I get the impression that those who serve the Sith must appear to be competent, but not a threat to their superiors."

starwarsrebels,2y03hm,mastersword130,3,Fri Mar 6 02:22:57 2015 UTC,Sith Lightning is an advanced skill. It requires Jedi Master level skill and some training. The only reason we don't see Vader use it is because his suit is electrical...and that would did end badly for him.

Which is why Kanan was eventually able to overcome him with minimal training, had he been a fully fledged Sith then the Ghost crew would have stood absolutely no chance. Palpatine and Vader keep the Inquisitor and his ilk at a specific skill level, enough for them to serve a purpose but never enough to become a threat."

In past episodes we have seen Tarkin's disdain for the Jedi, but he did seem to like (tolerate) Asoka a lot more then any other Jedi, besides Anakin Skywalker. However, in the episode where she is on trail he is relentless on her needing to be put to death."

That is, prior to the final episode. There is a major shift indicated in the series and it seems likely that a knowledge of the clone wars, while not vital yet, is something you're going to want.  You're also missing out on a very solid show. Some episodes are a bit questionable and some push the ""kids show"" dynamic to their extreme, but the overall show is fairly solid and even the worst elements of the series ( *cough * Jar Jar * cough) aren't as bad as you'd expect."

I suggest watching all of TCW, as it is awesome."

I'm gonna attempt to get through it all though!"
starwarsrebels,2xy478,chris2c2,3,Wed Mar 4 21:50:54 2015 UTC,Ending of season 5 on the clone wars will explain more in why fulcrum isn't a Jedi nor will she consider herself as one.

starwarsrebels,2xy478,mastersword130,3,Thu Mar 5 00:02:32 2015 UTC,"What makes the arc so compelling is the backstory, the character-building that happens in previous seasons. It's less compelling if you just skip ahead. It's FAR better to watch the whole series."
starwarsrebels,2xy478,nightmare901,2,Thu Mar 5 00:11:16 2015 UTC,"It is better if you watch the whole season but you can say that about any episode really. The Jedi hunt really stands on its own thoughx, you don't really need a background info because the majority of characters are already well known in star wars except for ashoka and Ventress."
starwarsrebels,2xy478,mastersword130,1 point,Thu Mar 5 00:15:50 2015 UTC,You could do season 2 episodes 4-8 to set up for season 5 episodes 17-20. You can also through in season 3 episodes 21 and 22 as a bridge between them. But of course watching it all is great.

Only Anakin thought she was innocent and went far above to clear her name.  When her name was clear the masters decided that this was her great trail and asked her to come back and become a full fledged Jedi Knight, she refused and left the order and told Anakin she couldn't trust the Jedi order any longer. This leads to a Anakin being even more Vader like in the unfinished episodes.  So yeah, she isn't a Jedi nor does she consider herself one."

It's been so long since I've watched those episodes.  :x  Hopefully she can maybe help train the two rebels or something to be better at lightsaber fighting.  Or since she doesn't see herself as a Jedi, maybe she won't.  Can't wait to find out what happens, though."
starwarsrebels,2xy478,Viperpaktu,2,Thu Mar 5 17:41:52 2015 UTC,She probably will teach Ezra a thing or two as well as Kanan. Don't need to he a Jedi to teach a person about the force and that is what I'm loving.

starwarsrebels,2xxh7r,mutually_awkward,3,Wed Mar 4 23:02:16 2015 UTC,Is the general consensus that people didn't like season 1 of TCW? Because I really enjoyed it a lot.

starwarsrebels,2xxh7r,Clonetrooperkev,5,Wed Mar 4 21:04:55 2015 UTC,"Give it time. Strong start I'd say, but we've got a long way to go."
starwarsrebels,2xxh7r,diamondcreeper,2,Thu Mar 5 04:44:26 2015 UTC,"I think it has the potential.  One of the things that makes series like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings have such a rabid fanbase is the alien (in SW case, literally) world/galaxy. Star Wars did a good job of exploring the galaxy in Season 1, even if most of the planets were ones we knew, while our Rebels mostly sat in the fields of Lothal for Season 1. They only left for big episodes. Aside from the fact Season 1 of Rebels felt more like a prologue than a proper first season, it was very stationary and I hate to say, kind of boring when looked at from a distance, whereas Clone Wars was not. The one thing I didn't like about Clone Wars in its later seasons was the 6-episode storylines. Seriously, just make another movie!  HOWEVER, don't get mad yet, I think Rebels has the potential to be much better than Clone Wars. Clone Wars was amazing in that it had large-scale battles, lots of Jedi, lots of setting up for the sacred and holy Original Trilogy, but it was still a kids show for the most part, and seemed kind of lost until about Season 3. Rebels is building off of that, it knows where it's going. Now that we have established characters (FREAKING FULCRUM AND VADER!) as well as set up that there is indeed a Rebellion, and put our heroes in the midst of a real rebel cell, I think Season 2 will be much better.  I already love the blatant references and vibes to the Original Trilogy, and this series already feels much more ""there"" than Clone Wars, which felt too much like a forced prequel sometimes.  VERDICT: With some more planets, some bigger battles, and less sitting around, I think Rebels will be a worthy successor to Clone Wars, and perhaps even better. Let's not push it too far though. Season 1 was good, now lets see if Season 2 is great."
starwarsrebels,2xxh7r,zackmanze,2,Fri Mar 6 04:37:41 2015 UTC,"I commented a week ago with ""lol"" and was downvoted to hell.    Let me expand.  ""lol.  Rebels left Clone Wars in the dust within 15 minutes.""    Key Difference; Storytelling.  Rebels is telling a story.  Not just spinning wheels. I care about the characters and what's going on, and I'm excited to see the next episode of Rebels. Hell, I usually can't stand the wait. 85% I started the next episode of Clone Wars begrudgingly."
starwarsrebels,2xxh7r,dimagasa,0,Tue Mar 10 21:28:39 2015 UTC,"If you're only comparing S1 of Rebels, no.  Clone Wars developed far more characters, events, and universe impacts across multiple seasons while Rebels only focused on an isolated band of smugglers on a single planet."
starwarsrebels,2xxh7r,Ansoni,3,Wed Mar 4 21:28:00 2015 UTC,It's true that TCW involved more characters but whether or not those characters were actually developed more or even as much as Rebels characters is debatable.

starwarsrebels,2xvxrq,BudgieAttackSquadron,6,Wed Mar 4 16:01:54 2015 UTC,"I like the combo but I could see it be exclusively Tarkin as well.  Tarkin didn't rebuke him when he said people thought the Empire was weak and vulnerable but almost consoled him.  With the broader understanding of Tarkin's near-sith ethic, that was totally a grooming gesture to me.  That adds significance to me also to see an OT mentor relationship in the Empire because it seems that Star Wars needs to pick up where it left off in the 11th hour of telling the story of how bad becomes good.  edit: Just to add that it's comforting to see an emergence of non-force sensitive villains to take some of the stress off sith which could totally confuse the balance issue moving forward if they're not careful."

And very much proves himself useful in a fight against the Ghost crew, again and again, usually only stopped by Force-users. Add to that that when he knows he's outclassed he's not afraid to call in the bigger guns (Inquisitor, then Tarkin). He's unafraid to report his failings in order to let those more experienced with Jedi and the like intervene. He puts the Empire above his own reputation, and is well-respected and feared by his subordinates. I'm glad he survived the first season, he's a great villain and the mutton chops are fantastic.

starwarsrebels,2xzjei,saskatchewan_kenobi,1 point,Thu Mar 5 14:51:28 2015 UTC,65 episodes is a shit ton for a new character in the star wars universe with plenty of arcs devoted solely on her.  Anakin and Kenobi were only in it more because the clone wars is about anakin mostly.

So maybe focusing on females for rebels wasnt that important. With Ahsoka joining, there will now be three main female members in season 2 of rebels. So there is not going to be a shortage of female characters in star wars anymore."

starwarsrebels,2xtjgj,TeutonJon78,7,Tue Mar 3 19:56:55 2015 UTC,But isn't it too early for A-Wings? They were the advanced fighter that was introduced in RotJ. They should have a big fleet of them this early in the rebellion. It should still all be X and Y-wings.  Wookieepedia doesn't have their development starting until after the Battle of Yavin. http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/RZ-1_A-wing_interceptor
starwarsrebels,2xtjgj,metallicabmc,7,Tue Mar 3 22:18:24 2015 UTC,There was actually a predecessor to the A-Wing called the R-22 spearhead (nicknamed the A-Wing by the rebels) which looked very similar and was mass produced and used as far back as 15 BBY by these guys http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Battle_of_Tammuz-an  so it's quite possible that  this is what we are seeing. According to one of the cross sections books the alliance had 2 of those ships in the temple hangar and it's what they based the real A-Wings off of.
starwarsrebels,2xtjgj,Binturung,3,Tue Mar 3 23:14:25 2015 UTC,"You would appear to be correct  They were featured in Droids according to that entry.  There was a cross-section of the Yavin 4 Great Temple printed in I believe Incredible Cross-Sections of Star Wars, which was published in 1998, and you can see a A-22 at the very bottom, so there are examples of the design being around during or before the Battle of Yavin.  I don't think this detail is a big issue with this knowledge, especially since pilots nicknamed it the A-Wing anyways."

The cockpit is different in the Rebels version, has an extra window. The bump behind the cockpit is in a different location. The weapons are different. The ROTJ A-Wing has a bifurcated nose while the Rebels A-Wing does not. The ROTJ A-Wing also looks a bit more rounded and thick, while the Rebels A-Wing is a bit more angular and thinner.  Like many designs in Rebels, it looks like Rebels A-Wing is heavily inspired by Ralph McQuarrie's original design for the A-Wing."
starwarsrebels,2xtjgj,TeutonJon78,0,Wed Mar 4 04:37:31 2015 UTC,"While true, why wouldn't they have had a bunch of them at Yavin then,  instead of holding them back?  I think it's just a continuity error to use a cool ship."

He knows Kenobi's hiding out on Tatooine with Luke. There's absolutely no reason Leia had to have actually met Obi-Wan to know to contact him."
starwarsrebels,2xucay,Mackadal,7,Wed Mar 4 02:30:19 2015 UTC,Why would she trust him with the Death Star plans? That's a pretty big leap if she didn't have some knowledge of the guy
starwarsrebels,2xucay,Red5iveStandingBy,6,Wed Mar 4 02:55:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, obviously she has knowledge of him. From the stories her father told her of the great Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, who served him in the Clone Wars and all that stuff in the holomessage. No reason she has to have met him personally."
starwarsrebels,2xucay,zackmanze,6,Wed Mar 4 03:14:05 2015 UTC,And no reason she had not met him personally. The exchanges in Episode IV leave it open for either! Which is great.
starwarsrebels,2xucay,Cevan,1 point,Wed Mar 4 15:56:52 2015 UTC,I think you're spot on.  Bail or Leia will totally share screentime with Kenobi in Rebels.
starwarsrebels,2xucay,zackmanze,2,Wed Mar 4 18:43:52 2015 UTC,"Not to mention The Clone Wars as well. Bail and Obi-Wan know each other fairly well, especially by the time of RotS."
starwarsrebels,2xucay,Sapitoelgato,4,Wed Mar 4 05:00:40 2015 UTC,Love it.
starwarsrebels,2xucay,Eman997,8,Wed Mar 4 18:44:09 2015 UTC,"It is best if Obi-Wan and the Rebels don't meet in the show. Look at it this way.   As a last resort Bail sends Leia to escort Obi-Wan to Alderaan. Whether, it was before or after she had the Death Star blue prints transmitted to her ship. Obi-Wan looks so detached from the rebel events unfolding around him, when R2D2 and C3PO show up.  To have him be involved this early, when he is in exile watching over Luke seems odd."
starwarsrebels,2xucay,ramonm2,7,Wed Mar 4 05:07:36 2015 UTC,Totally agree with you. Ben's number one priority is watching over Luke and keeping himself and Luke secret from Vader and the emperor.
starwarsrebels,2xucay,BlueSmoke95,9,Wed Mar 4 06:58:41 2015 UTC,"Obi Wan technically doesn't exist. He's now Ben. ""Now that's a name I haven't heard in ages."" Hologram possibly with Bail to get info would be interesting."
starwarsrebels,2xucay,Lemonite,8,Wed Mar 4 07:33:17 2015 UTC,"I'd rather they leave Kenobi alone in Rebels.  If they are to do some pre-ANH story stuff, I want him to be the focus, not just a cameo."
starwarsrebels,2xucay,Mackadal,8,Wed Mar 4 00:03:38 2015 UTC,With Vader now in play I see no reason to hold the possibility of Kenobi out. For all intents and purposes this is a clear extension of the original trilogy. I understand at this point its a low probability but they have already pulled in Yoda why not Old ben?
starwarsrebels,2xucay,ohcatrina,4,Wed Mar 4 01:04:03 2015 UTC,I would much rather get a Kenobi spin-off film than a shoehorned cameo in Rebels...
starwarsrebels,2xucay,AusSco,7,Wed Mar 4 01:26:07 2015 UTC,"He needs to stay hidden and secluded. If he was already interacting with the Rebels at this point in time, none of ANH would makes sense."
starwarsrebels,2xucay,Saseav,7,Wed Mar 4 02:32:02 2015 UTC,Other than the fact ANH literally begins with the rebel leader reaching out to find him. Why would she do that if he was just a random hermit?
starwarsrebels,2xucay,hyperlancer,4,Wed Mar 4 02:54:02 2015 UTC,"Well, it seems like she's reaching out to him after a long time. She says he helped Bail out during the Clone Wars, so it's possible that Obi-Wan hasn't seen Bail since he handed Leia over."
starwarsrebels,2xucay,bluestaples,2,Wed Mar 4 05:51:32 2015 UTC,"Exactly this, Leia refers to Obi-Wan as ""General Kenobi"", rather than Ben or just Obi Wan.  ""General Kenobi, you served with my father in the Clone Wars......."" blah blah blah.  This says to me that no contact has been made since the end of RotS. At least, no contact from Bail to Kenobi."
starwarsrebels,2xstvt,Lambent_Light,3,Tue Mar 3 16:39:19 2015 UTC,blew my mind. Asohka Tano returns! so satisfied because I thought her story felt cut off in the clone wars series.

starwarsrebels,2xsyen,mrpiggywinkles52,8,Tue Mar 3 17:12:21 2015 UTC,I hope we see a special elite group of troopers that don't play the fuck around.
starwarsrebels,2xsyen,mastersword130,11,Tue Mar 3 17:14:00 2015 UTC,501st Legion? They didn't fuck around in TCW. It'd be interesting if they kept with the EU and included that the 501st remained pure fett template clones. I'd love to see evil Rex.
starwarsrebels,2xsyen,mastersword130,5,Tue Mar 3 17:17:17 2015 UTC,Probably but in Tarkin said they had accelerated aging so a lot of them are gone. There was only one in vaders troops with him.   I want to see how Rex is though also and also how Cody felt after shooting down Kenobi.
starwarsrebels,2xsyen,cadbane298,4,Tue Mar 3 17:19:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah other than that line from Tarkin they could have just made the kaminoans  still producing clones, really is a shame they'd drop that."
starwarsrebels,2xsyen,MadMan2012,2,Tue Mar 3 17:39:44 2015 UTC,"in Star Wars:Battlefront 2's Rise of the Empire campaign the kaminoans actually make more clones, and as the 501st you have to go back and kill the new batch of clones. Could be  an interesting thing to tie into the show."
starwarsrebels,2xsyen,MadMan2012,2,Wed Mar 4 13:46:24 2015 UTC,"I would bet the 501st, they were Vaders personal troops. So with the end of the season I would bet heavily on it. Personally I would hope all the clones are dead by now, I'd rather not see an evil Rex."
starwarsrebels,2xsyen,Nihillo,1 point,Wed Mar 4 15:18:49 2015 UTC,"I dunno man evil rex would be heartbreaking for someone like me that grew up with TCW.

starwarsrebels,2xsyen,awanderingsinay,1 point,Wed Mar 4 19:22:09 2015 UTC,"I'd rather Vader reveal his fate to Ashoka, I'm pretty sure she would bring him up."
starwarsrebels,2xsyen,ArmyDoc68251,7,Wed Mar 4 20:50:07 2015 UTC,"Tarkin brought some higher ranking Stormtroopers with him, and we still haven't seem them outright fail, so just keep an eye on their pauldrons, if they have one, then you can expect them to be reasonably competent, but keep in mind that they will be dealing with three Jedi, a Mandalorian, a huge alien warrior and an ace pilot, so the odds aren't in their favor.  I'm pretty sure we will see Scout Troopers at some point, they may supplant the combat drivers. I'm also hoping to see their own take on the Dark Trooper project (canon was reset, so they can do whatever they want); there was a cancelled story arc for the Clone Wars in which ARC trooper Echo returns as a CIS cyborg, as cheesy as that idea may have been, it does fit the concept of the early Dark Trooper prototypes: aging clone troopers forced back into service through gruesome cybernetic implants."
starwarsrebels,2xsyen,awanderingsinay,4,Tue Mar 3 22:31:55 2015 UTC,"I think we're going to see troopers doing more damage but also many new variants. Just like the Clone Wars we saw newer and more bad ass/dangerous droids pop out at key moments and fuck shit up a bit. So I wouldn't be surprised to see jump troopers, jet troopers, dark troopers (as dangerous ass enemies), and on and on.   If there is going to be rebel troops I would even expect troopers to do some actual damage as well and take down a few of them. Which I'm looking forward to soooooooo much."
starwarsrebels,2xsyen,sageleader,3,Tue Mar 3 20:04:42 2015 UTC,This is my wet dream come true.  I want some badass and intense fights between rebel alliance troops and the storm troopers.  Ugggh please don't fuck it up!
starwarsrebels,2xsyen,ArmyDoc68251,1 point,Wed Mar 4 02:26:09 2015 UTC,We are on the same level man.
starwarsrebels,2xsyen,EnglishMobster,6,Wed Mar 4 08:29:12 2015 UTC,"This episode to me wasn't about troopers with poor shots, it was about staffing. Why on earth would you only have 4 troopers staffing a landing pad with 6 TIEs and a bulk transport? Also why during a power meltdown on a star destroyer would you send all your troopers from the detention block to go after intruders when you know they're coming to capture Kanan!? It makes no damn sense. I would put everyone in that detention block because there's only once purpose to their intrusion!"
starwarsrebels,2xsyen,diamondcreeper,2,Tue Mar 3 21:20:38 2015 UTC,"Budget maybe? If you watched TCW, there was many times in the first few seasons where they were reeeaaallly light on the clone troops.  You didn't see mass numbers of them in battle for a while.    I remember being annoyed in the one episode where they capture the newt gungray and get boarded, it seemed like they had one friggin squad on a HUGE battle cruiser."
starwarsrebels,2xsyen,Blackfire853,2,Wed Mar 4 02:29:14 2015 UTC,"Well, think about it for a few moments:  The Empire fields the only major standing army in the Galaxy. Although there may be some planetary militias, there's no existential crisis for the Empire that would warrant keeping a massive and well-trained military.  There's no unified Rebel threat (yet), so most of the Stormtroopers have likely not seen any combat experience outside of minor police duties. It would make sense that they aren't battle-hardened -- the Rebel cells operating on various planets are all isolated from one another, with minimal contact. Becoming a Stormtrooper for the Empire for a lot of people is a nice, cushy job where you get paid to stand around and guard stuff, even though nothing ever happens. If you're a pilot, you might fly a few escort missions and keep cargo safe from pirates, but that's really about it."

starwarsrebels,2xsyen,autowikiabot,4,Tue Mar 3 19:22:17 2015 UTC,Would be kind of a waste considering the relatively low number of jedi left in the galaxy.  But the royal guardsmen would be what you described and have the potential to be really badass

They were silent and enigmatic warriors that received orders directly from Emperor Palpatine himself and were often sent to eliminate suspected Jedi and other Force users.  When necessary they would also be put under the supervision of Lord Vader. These guardsmen demonstrated Force powers of their own which led many to suspect that they were in fact former Jedi that had been captured, tortured and brainwashed by Palpatine, but this was a rumor that was never to be proven.

starwarsrebels,2xsj1z,leakime,2,Tue Mar 3 15:11:47 2015 UTC,Yes I agree with this too. Everything that Williams wrote has a purpose for specific characters and themes and sometimes Kiner uses them inappropriately. I just thought that his work on the finale was top notch.

starwarsrebels,2xsj1z,mrpiggywinkles52,2,Wed Mar 4 09:24:10 2015 UTC,The slight change in the imperial march when Vader appeared was fantastic. I think that Kliner does a FANTASTIC job of not only creating new music but taking William's score and manipulating it to make something almost new. Plus he knows how to hit the right emotional notes at just the proper moment.
starwarsrebels,2xsj1z,RVierra327,1 point,Sat Mar 7 18:32:11 2015 UTC,I love his stuff but I felt they should have kept the standard imperial march for Vader's first real appearance.  Just me though

starwarsrebels,2xswae,b_taylor43,4,Tue Mar 3 17:42:09 2015 UTC,"If you're figuring 25 episodes (7+ months) for season 2 then I would expect a summer/fall start leading up to a mid season cliffhanger that introduces plot points relevant to the movie.  Given the spacing in the last part of S1 I don't see them in a rush to squeeze all 25 in before then, in fact knowing Disney there's been a preset schedule for the show, movie, toys, etc going at least 2 years."
starwarsrebels,2xswae,dimagasa,1 point,Tue Mar 3 18:04:21 2015 UTC,"No date has been announced but with Season 2 premiering at Celebration next month and a longer season, I would not be surprised to have a premiere sooner than the traditional season premiere time (Sept/Oct) and having a summer start date."
starwarsrebels,2xswae,RVierra327,0,Tue Mar 3 18:34:32 2015 UTC,"My guess is season 2 will probably finish around December, in order to increase the publicity and hype around The Force Awakens.  Alternatively, the show could start airing again in early 2016, riding the success of the movie, probably picking up a huge ratings boost after everyone's seen Ep 7."
starwarsrebels,2xrwni,ZyreHD,18,Tue Mar 3 10:35:47 2015 UTC,More? Definitely. Looking forward to Barriss Offee being introduced as one soon (hopefully).
starwarsrebels,2xrwni,JulMdama,10,Tue Mar 3 10:45:52 2015 UTC,Oh for sure.  There is a lot of history with Barriss and Ashoka.  It will make for an exciting season 2.
starwarsrebels,2xrwni,chaos9001,9,Tue Mar 3 13:20:38 2015 UTC,They might do the Ahsoka vs Bariss thing for season 2 and possibly three and then save Vader for the final season (someone said Rebels was to last 4 seasons correct?)
starwarsrebels,2xrwni,mrpiggywinkles52,2,Tue Mar 3 17:08:22 2015 UTC,Where did you hear about four seasons? Not disagreeing just curious
starwarsrebels,2xrwni,goingnoles,2,Tue Mar 3 18:12:31 2015 UTC,Was somewhere on this subreddit someone posted an article that Rebels would last 4 seasons and then be replaced with a series filling the gap between episodes VI and VII. I can't search for it though as I'm not sure what the thread was called.

starwarsrebels,2xrwni,ZTHerper,5,Tue Mar 3 20:19:05 2015 UTC,Did anyone else hear the force sound effect when Inky fell? As if Kanan or Inky used a force push to force inky/themselves off the ledge? I'm wondering if he force pushed himself off to avoid falling into the damaged reactor and instead just hit the floor not unlike Ezra did.
starwarsrebels,2xrwni,DangerousDac,3,Tue Mar 3 20:08:49 2015 UTC,I think he will overcome death somehow.   Perhaps his threat of things worst than death means he will comeback as a dark side force ghost?

starwarsrebels,2xrwni,CogzillaAttacks,6,Tue Mar 3 18:58:01 2015 UTC,I have a personal theory that there are a bunch of Inquisitor clones around the galaxy hunting Jedi. Maybe they're advanced clones with a collective conscious.
starwarsrebels,2xrwni,Sheikah_Benji,5,Tue Mar 3 15:22:06 2015 UTC,"They don't need clones -- Palpy was collecting Jedi children. And once the Jedi fell, no one would be recruiting new kids except Palpy."
starwarsrebels,2xrwni,TeutonJon78,2,Tue Mar 3 17:31:09 2015 UTC,I thought that clone wars episode was out of character for Palpatine personally.

I saw a video about the Claymore-saber and its practicality. It's also a much longer blade, that should improve its defensive capabilities. As for the crossguard, it could theoretically be used offensively, to injure hands in close-quarters."
starwarsrebels,2xrmrn,im_not_clever_enough,6,Tue Mar 3 07:56:34 2015 UTC,I really don't want rebels to be 'return of the clone wars characters' because we have so much new stories to tell. I feel as if maul and ventress's fate should remain in the books or comics they possibly will release. Dark Disciple is coming up featuring ventress so pick that nook up once it's out. And son of dathomir [spoiler] left mauls fate up to whoever is next in line to tell a maul story.
starwarsrebels,2xrmrn,omarh14,2,Tue Mar 3 16:04:57 2015 UTC,"I have a theory based on a few things: TCW Legacy video, Son of Dathomir, and the Clone Wars legend comics.  spoilers ahead  Basically, Mace Windu thinks Maul is Dooku's master (canon in Son of Dathomir). From there they have Quinlan Vos go undercover to defect to the Separatists and gain favor of Dooku (clone wars legend comics). Quinlan gains the aide of Ventress to help, and things get a little vague from there. Maul is a desperate wild animal at this time, and only has the aide of Death Watch. He seeks revenge, and also goes after Dooku. Eventually, there is a ballroom scene, where Quinlan, Ventress, Maul, and Dooku face off. Maul and Ventress dies. Quinlan carries Ventress in his arms after she is dead.  Will this all happen? I don't know. This is my speculation."
starwarsrebels,2xrmrn,Sapitoelgato,2,Wed Mar 4 03:40:47 2015 UTC,I was really hoping that Maul would end up as the Head of the Inquisitors but with how things ended in the Son of Dathomir series it is near impossible for that to be the case.  Ventress could easily be integrated.  Same with Cad Bane.  Honestly I have no problem with these people appearing.
starwarsrebels,2xrmrn,HalcyonWind,1 point,Sun Mar 15 04:34:20 2015 UTC,I'm hoping they show up because if they don't show up in Rebels they're probably gone for good
starwarsrebels,2xrmrn,HalcyonWind,1 point,Tue Mar 17 05:02:38 2015 UTC,I wouldn't go that far.  With comics and books coming out there are just too many mediums for them to appear in.

starwarsrebels,2xu051,Eristotle,7,Tue Mar 3 21:36:49 2015 UTC,"Clearly the tiered canon system was confusing and good riddance to it.  Everything George did was called G-canon.  That tier of canon superceded all other tiers of canon and is what is now referred to as, ""canon.""  The old cartoon is still fun with it's relentless, ""ACTIONACTIONACTIONACTION,"" but Star Wars is a much bigger concept than that.  Some people recommend watching Tartakovsky as the bread in a Clone Wars sandwich as Legend in the most literal sense and it works pretty well like that.  Honestly though, in a weird universe where we'd have to choose one or the other to exist, I'd pick TCW before the question was even done being asked.  I can't even think of an objective measure to the contrary except maybe Grievous and Mundi badassery though they are characters who have no business being badasses."
starwarsrebels,2xu051,RealVoltar,2,Wed Mar 4 06:57:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed. That's a much better way of putting it. I was going to use the Legends comparison, but couldn't figure out how to phrase it with the double meaning.  Clone Wars is like a story told by a character within TCW."
starwarsrebels,2xu051,5aucy,2,Wed Mar 4 13:06:42 2015 UTC,I meant it in a way more concrete and less interesting way than that but thanks for letting me know I said cool shit on accident.

starwarsrebels,2xu051,RealVoltar,5,Wed Mar 4 16:51:02 2015 UTC,"Because the clone wars CGI wasn't ridiculous with its power levels and has actual character development.   Of course it beat the mini series in canon, I'm sorry but no matter how cool clone wars was it was over the top and shouldn't be considered canon. Mace windu shatter pointing a battalion of droids?! God no. Cool but no."
starwarsrebels,2xu051,mastersword130,1 point,Wed Mar 4 02:21:40 2015 UTC,Yeah for as cool and beautifully animated that series was it was more style over substance.   Or the Abridged version of the Clone Wars.   Plus as a tie breaker George Lucas directly oversaw and approved the Clone Wars. Genndy's series worked mostly autonomously from Lucasfilm to make Clone Wars.
starwarsrebels,2xu051,pauleoinhurley,-4,Wed Mar 4 09:19:52 2015 UTC,You're right: Darth Maul retcon is way less ridiculous.
starwarsrebels,2xu051,mastersword130,3,Wed Mar 4 03:13:37 2015 UTC,Not sure if sarcastic or not but Darth Maul was fucking kickass. Dude took over Mandalore like a boss.
starwarsrebels,2xu051,Roger_KK,3,Wed Mar 4 03:16:25 2015 UTC,A lot of that Darth Maul retcon existed WAY before the show ever did it. I remember reading about it some time around 2006?  Here's a link.
starwarsrebels,2xu051,pauleoinhurley,2,Wed Mar 4 06:23:43 2015 UTC,"In a universe populated by mystic warriors, advanced space travel and assorted technologies. Is it really asking you to suspend your disbelief that Maul, a wielder of dark arts survived a brutalised fatal attack by utilising that force.  Besides despite how inheritantly ridiculous it is he's alive the quality of his story telling of his life after ""death"" is of a strong quality."
starwarsrebels,2xu051,GodotIsWaiting4U,1 point,Wed Mar 4 07:48:41 2015 UTC,"The reason why The Clone Wars made the jump and the Tartakovsky series didn't is because George Lucas himself was a present and active creative force in the production of The Clone Wars, unlike the Tartakovsky series. Although he never wrote an episode himself, he was involved in TCW at a greater level than anything else that isn't a Star Wars movie. And with other people writing the actual words for him and hashing out the story with him, it turned into a wonderful show after a rocky start.  In the old tiered canon system, thanks to Lucas's involvement in the show it occupied a special level of canon called T-canon: T for television, one step above C-canon (the normal EU canon) and one step below G-canon (the movies).  Everything C-canon and below got reclassed as Legends, everything T-canon and above became the new canon.  The Tartakovsky series was trapped in a special hell, because the Tartakovsky depiction of the Battle of Coruscant was based on an early draft of the novel Labyrinth of Evil. As Labyrinth of Evil went through successive drafts, the two accounts diverged, and since it was too late to make Tartakovsky redo the season, it was determined behind the scenes by Lucasfilm that LoE would be the C-canon account of that event, so when Labyrinth of Evil came out it superseded the Tartakovsky series. As such, the Tartakovsky show hasn't entirely been canon since shortly before Revenge of the Sith."
starwarsrebels,2xu051,5aucy,-5,Tue Mar 10 23:10:17 2015 UTC,It didn't. It's a continuation.
starwarsrebels,2xu051,BlueSmoke95,5,Tue Mar 3 21:39:29 2015 UTC,Yes it did.  Only the CGI TCW is canon.
starwarsrebels,2xu051,5aucy,-3,Tue Mar 3 22:09:29 2015 UTC,"It's not removed from canon until it's contradicted. It explains Anakin's scar, the origin of Ventress, Grievous, and others. Things that are ratified by other canonical material."
starwarsrebels,2xu051,BlueSmoke95,8,Tue Mar 3 22:40:14 2015 UTC,"Yes it is.  The Lucas Story Group very clearly stated that everything other than the 6 movies, The Clone Wars (2008) and anything published after the Disney buyout (May 2014) is non-canon."
starwarsrebels,2xu051,5aucy,-1,Tue Mar 3 22:42:53 2015 UTC,So the canon is referencing non canon material?
starwarsrebels,2xu051,BlueSmoke95,2,Tue Mar 3 22:52:08 2015 UTC,"That happens all the time and is allowed by Lucas Story Group.  However, there is no canon explanation to the scar."
starwarsrebels,2xu051,5aucy,-3,Tue Mar 3 22:55:39 2015 UTC,"It's not just the scar. Clone Wars created Ventress and Grievous before Episode III or TCW.  I guess I'm still using old canon rules, where it falls into T canon and is therefore canon until G canon contradict, with the corroboration counting in its favor.  Maybe it isn't officially in canon, but canon has not provided a canonical contradiction (and in fact corroborates it often)."
starwarsrebels,2xu051,BlueSmoke95,2,Tue Mar 3 23:05:08 2015 UTC,I believe those characters came from either novels or script drafts from Lucas.  They were not original to the series.
starwarsrebels,2xu051,5aucy,-3,Tue Mar 3 23:09:13 2015 UTC,"I mean, I know the new canon, I just think if canon corroborates it, then it shouldn't be tossed as if it doesn't fit.  If there is a question not resolved by other canon, but the answer is in Clone Wars, then that's how it happened until canon says otherwise as far as I'm concerned.  It'd be another thing if it contradicted official canon."
starwarsrebels,2xu051,BlueSmoke95,2,Tue Mar 3 23:17:26 2015 UTC,"And that is fine for you, but officially it happened an unexplained way."
starwarsrebels,2xu051,BlueSmoke95,2,Tue Mar 3 23:52:23 2015 UTC,You can always check here for questions on canon.  It is far simpler now.
starwarsrebels,2xu051,RealVoltar,2,Tue Mar 3 23:10:34 2015 UTC,"It never was G canon before, therefor it's not canon now.  It works the other way.  Legends materials are legends until canonized and a lot of things from the Tartakovsky CW was made canon by TCW (jedi-speedo Kit Fisto and those weird fighters for instance).  I think TCW Yoda quotes a little of what Lumiara says to Ofee on Ilum in the SWCW.  There's some other nods I can't think of atm."
starwarsrebels,2xu051,5aucy,1 point,Wed Mar 4 07:06:51 2015 UTC,"Right, it was T canon, which made it canon if it didn't conflict with G canon.  The new way makes far more sense than the tiers. Haha"
starwarsrebels,2xu051,Sapitoelgato,1 point,Wed Mar 4 13:08:29 2015 UTC,"On a side note, the only thing to show Anakin getting his scar was in the Clone Wars legends comic. The animated Clone Wars legends show only showed him showing Padmé it, when returning from battle. In the legends comic he gets it in a duel with Ventress."
starwarsrebels,2xu051,GodotIsWaiting4U,1 point,Wed Mar 4 04:53:31 2015 UTC,"It doesn't explain a damn thing about Anakin's scar, just showing him suddenly have it one day after a mission, and only shows Dooku's first meeting with Ventress, followed by Ventress's first encounter with Anakin. Anakin's scar originally got an explanation in the Republic comic series. As of now, Anakin's scar has no canon explanation, it is simply there.  It ALSO explained nothing about the origin of Grievous, merely introducing him in the Battle of Hypori as a new Separatist general. It had already been decided that Grievous would be a villain in Revenge of the Sith; the Tartakovsky show merely offered a sneak peek of the new villain.  The Clone Wars has retconned Grievous's origins slightly and retconned Ventress's origins HEAVILY. The new canon consists of the movies, The Clone Wars, and anything new. Everything else, including the Tartakovsky show, is now Legends.  The Tartakovsky show's depiction of the Battle of Coruscant was already confirmed by Leland Chee to be non-canon anyway, with Labyrinth of Evil taking its place, so the Tartakovsky show hasn't properly fit established canon for a very long time."

The coordinates of the Nexus Route were discovered by Jedi Master Even Piell shortly before he was captured by the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and transported to the Citadel prison to be tortured for the details of the route. Piell had erased the coordinates from his ship's computer before his capture, but not before memorizing half of them and ordering his captain, Wilhuff Tarkin, to memorize the other half. Piell was killed before he could make it back to the Republic, but before dying, he told Anakin Skywalker's Padawan Ahsoka Tano about what he knew of the route and made her promise to only divulge the information to the Jedi Council. Tarkin refused to give his half of the data to anyone other than Supreme Chancellor Palpatine.

It's like the ending of E4...now that the Empire knows where the secret rebel base is, let's not grab our shit and run but instead hold a medals ceremony.  It's not intended to be realistic as much as a narrative device of the George genre to round off the edge of an episode.

That subplot is so far totally unneeded drama that doesn't move anything forward.  Ezra adopted the crew as his family in the first episode.

starwarsrebels,2xousx,DisasterAhead,1 point,Mon Mar 2 19:26:59 2015 UTC,"I'm just gonna day this, Yoda's dream in the lost missions was just that. A dream something to test him. While I admit it looks like it could of been during Order 66 I highly doubt it. Why? Because those younglings are the same one Ahsoka took on the Lightsaber making missions to Ilum 3 years prior to episode 3. Those younglings looked and sounded to be in their young teens. 3 years later, with how the war was going and the lack of Jedi, they would be padawans serving with their masters on the front. And before you say they all came back, what are the odds that they all show up at the temple at the same time and that Ahsoka rejoins the order. Next to nothing. And seeing as that I was watching that episode in my study hall today she does have her beads on which means she was a Jedi again."
starwarsrebels,2xousx,pufferpig,2,Mon Mar 2 22:29:53 2015 UTC,"I agree that it was only a vision (a manifestation of Yoda's guilt) but Clone Wars STARTED 3 years before RoTS, when Ahsoka was 14. In season 5, she is 16-17. So Order 66 was less than a year away. They did a big jump mid season 3, but everything after that happened in the space of 1year+ ish time.  I remember reading somewhere that Clone Wars was meant to have 8 seasons and end with different perspectives of ""Empire Day"" aka The Great Purge and birth of the Empire.  Heck, we might get flashbacks to this later on in Rebels if Fulcrum indeed is Ahsoka."
starwarsrebels,2xousx,DisasterAhead,1 point,Mon Mar 2 23:41:08 2015 UTC,Well seeing that I bow really wish Disney had let the show finish or maybe just moved it to their own network with the same writers and animators etc.

starwarsrebels,2xgeq9,gamerslyratchet,8,Tue Mar 3 00:49:38 2015 UTC,Because Filoni kinda mentioned that some captured Jedi would become Imperial Inquisitors to save their lives when he was asked about Barriss in an interview.

The Emperor is a manipulative and charismatic individual, who can corrupt the good intentions of others and turn them into mere pawns in his schemes, just look at what he did to Anakin, he wasn't evil either."

starwarsrebels,2xgeq9,mjsmith1223,1 point,Sat Feb 28 17:05:30 2015 UTC,Some characters have to make a come back though. Its not like they died off during the clone wars and she was a prisoner and not a Jedi during order 66. She could be easily turned to become an inquisitor
starwarsrebels,2xgeq9,mastersword130,1 point,Tue Mar 3 17:06:43 2015 UTC,It's true that Clone Wars characters went off and did other things.  That doesn't mean they are a part of the Star Wars: Rebels narrative though.  There are lots of really good stories waiting to be told.  Too many for one series to tell well.  I would love a series that follows the clone troopers from immediately before Order 66 to when they start aging out and human conscripts fill the stormtrooper ranks.  How would the clones react to these apparently inept newbies?  What has Ventriss been up to?  Did she make peace with her past?  Would she end up being a bounty hunter?  A smuggler?  Join the rebellion?
starwarsrebels,2xgeq9,triarii3,1 point,Tue Mar 3 22:40:20 2015 UTC,Just saying that some should make a come back into the clone wars. Good thing Ventress story is going to be told via novel.
starwarsrebels,2xgeq9,Darth_Kyofu,3,Tue Mar 3 23:26:43 2015 UTC,she chose violence instead of peacefully demonstration to bring forward a personal opinion.
starwarsrebels,2xgeq9,Cern_Stormrunner,3,Sun Mar 1 22:29:09 2015 UTC,"People don't think she was evil, but she was inclined to behaving worse than most and Palpatine could easily have manipulated her into the dark side, either by twisting her thoughts or by breaking her."
starwarsrebels,2xgeq9,RealVoltar,2,Mon Mar 2 05:34:07 2015 UTC,"I don't see why anyone would believe she has fallen to the Dark Side while she, in her point of view, was serving the Light.   Remember that old saying about the road to Hell being paved with good intentions?"
starwarsrebels,2xgeq9,nightmare901,2,Mon Mar 2 16:56:30 2015 UTC,"The thing about the darkside is that it's not rational.  If she was a pure idealist, she wouldn't have fought Anakin or murdered civilians.  If she wasn't executed as Tarkin wanted, she was locked up and at the mercy of the Emperor.  For all we know, she could've been the backup plan if Anakin didn't work out.  Yeah, dead or darkside."
starwarsrebels,2xgeq9,TakeMyUsernameAgain,2,Mon Mar 2 09:15:22 2015 UTC,"Her arc, much like Ahsoka's, was left unfinished at the end of TCW. It's assumed that she was punished for the bombs, but we don't know if she escaped Order 66. And her being in a jail cell on Coruscant just isn't very exciting."
starwarsrebels,2xfpll,leakime,10,Sat Feb 28 05:22:14 2015 UTC,"Calling it now, Palpatine has a Sith Academy on Mustafar to churn out Acolytes or Inquisitors."

starwarsrebels,2xfpll,RogueLieutenant,7,Sat Feb 28 19:26:46 2015 UTC,I think Mustafar is going to be a place where Jedi are turned into dark side pawns for the empire.
starwarsrebels,2xfpll,RealVoltar,4,Sun Mar 1 02:38:43 2015 UTC,That's an interesting connection to make.  I hope we do kind of find out what Steve's been up to on Mustafar for the last decade.  I really kind of like the idea that Vader's Legends castle on Vjun made its way to Mustafar instead.  That would be double middle-fingers to all of us that thought Vader would be too big a wuss to go to Tat or Mustafar or Naboo.
starwarsrebels,2xfpll,5aucy,3,Mon Mar 2 09:10:47 2015 UTC,"Call call, OP.  This is definitely the seeds for the Inquisitor(s).  The return to Mustafar could be huge."

starwarsrebels,2xfpll,Cevan,7,Sat Feb 28 08:32:19 2015 UTC,People are theorizing that the Inquisitor(s) are related to what Palpatine was trying to accomplish here.
starwarsrebels,2xer6v,omarh14,3,Fri Feb 27 23:47:36 2015 UTC,Barriss as the second inquisitor please.
starwarsrebels,2xer6v,shikhargpt,3,Sat Feb 28 04:56:43 2015 UTC,"Ahhh I'd love that, but If Barriss was ever to appear in Rebels then either she was brainwashed to be an Inquisitor after the formation of the Empire, or she escaped and fights against the empire as well (I mean after all she did think the Republic was currupt), however still slightly leaning towards the dark side, I can definitely see her as an Anti-Hero who can go a little too far in the pursuit of battling against the empire, maybe even trying to tempt Ezra to the Darkside."
starwarsrebels,2xer6v,oldschoolsensei,6,Sat Feb 28 05:18:27 2015 UTC,"Well, now that Ezra said the words ""...an Inquisitor,"" we know that there are more than the one we have been shown. Vader killing off Inquisitor would be totally doable now. I do not want that done as punishment for failure, though. I want there to be an epic duel between Vader and Ahsoka, where he tries to turn her, and Inquisitor kills her with a cheap shot and ruins Vader's plans by accident. Then Vader can kill him. Although, YES, please bring on more Inquisitors.  I really like Kanan and do not want him to die. Yet. I sadly feel that he is the closest we will ever get to having Kyle Katarn be canon. I just really wish they'd bring in Kyle..."
starwarsrebels,2xer6v,Darth_Kyofu,8,Sat Feb 28 02:04:54 2015 UTC,"I'm super for more Inquisitors, But I don't want the Ahsoka character handled so quickly, if she is shown in Mondays episode, I DONT want her fighting Vader so soon. Really I just want Ahsokas face to be shown and nothing else. The battle between her and Vader needs to happen later in the series.  Also some EU characters still have hope in appearing in Rebels, just their background info or appearance might change, Like what they did with Darth Bane, I really want to know more about this new Darth Bane...."
starwarsrebels,2xer6v,5aucy,1 point,Sat Feb 28 02:12:31 2015 UTC,"I still hope the series ends with Kyle Katarn helping the Ghost crew trying to deliver the Death Star plans to Leia. In the end, they sacrifice themselves so Kyle can get the plans to the Tantive IV and directly tie in with ANH in the same way the old CW series tied with ROTS."
starwarsrebels,2x8eed,clemsonpacer,17,Thu Feb 26 14:08:43 2015 UTC,"My speculation on the ""Who Will Fall"" (potential spoilers?)  One of the Ghost crew biting it: I don't see this happening since several of them we know little about (especially Hera and Sabine). We know FPJr has recorded for next season so I don't see it being him (unless he appears as a force ghost, which I hope not). Ezra is the main character for all intents and purpose so I don't see him. The only possibility I see in this field is Zeb, since we've gotten a bit of his backstory.   Inquisitor being killed: very possible. And I could see this leading to...  ""Fall"" meaning someone ""falls"" to the dark side: Ezra/Kanan kill inquisitor, fall to dark side, next season arc is about redemption  Another character dies: we know it's not many of them that are appearing in this episode (Tarkin, Vader, Bail). Only other death could probably be Fulcrum, which I hope not because of the potential of a larger story arc for him/her."
starwarsrebels,2x8eed,RVierra327,13,Thu Feb 26 16:28:15 2015 UTC,"If they have all this suspense in revealing Fulcrum (who could be Ahsoka) only to have her killed (possibly by Vader) it would serriously piss me of big time.  Now, the double meaning of Fall is very interesting though. Trailers have shown Kanan destroying the Inquisitors lightsabre, possibly pointing towards his demise... but simply putting that much of a hint in the trailer could be a distraction. But who am I kidding... After the Clone Wars season 5 finale trailer, I don't trust any finale/climax trailers produced my Filoni and Co :P"
starwarsrebels,2x8eed,pufferpig,10,Thu Feb 26 17:28:36 2015 UTC,"I hope it's revealed as Ahsoka, then she has a big season 2 arc.  Obviously she has to die, but give me a few episodes."

Either way, that would be something that I think should happen the same episode as a Vader vs Ahsoka fight/standoff... Kind of in a proper ""shit hits the fan"" episode ;)  I do believe Kanan survives, though. Too soon to kill him off."

starwarsrebels,2x8eed,Revelations216,2,Thu Feb 26 14:58:08 2015 UTC,"My theory is the inquisitor gets defeated BY, prompting a visit from Vader."

starwarsrebels,2x8eed,pufferpig,3,Thu Feb 26 17:23:19 2015 UTC,I say Ezra gives into the Dark Side and winds up killing The Inquisitor to save Kanans life.
starwarsrebels,2x8eed,JobaccaWookiee,2,Sat Feb 28 16:30:12 2015 UTC,"Ohhh, I can see that happening"
starwarsrebels,2x8eed,oakley_fan,5,Sat Feb 28 22:21:15 2015 UTC,"I'm actually thinking Fulcrum will be revealed, join the fight, and be the one to die saving the others."
starwarsrebels,2x8eed,luckyloser62,8,Thu Feb 26 15:16:36 2015 UTC,"I'm really hoping its Ahsoka. FPjr said it will be heart breaking, and with Vader coming back it would be awesome to see her fall to him. I can't think of a more heart wrenching scenario than that."
starwarsrebels,2x8eed,eth6113,-2,Thu Feb 26 15:29:56 2015 UTC,The holocrom projection doesn't show togruta ears though. Can't be Ahsoka.
starwarsrebels,2x8eed,samlee405,2,Fri Feb 27 13:37:40 2015 UTC,"It could be a droid. They've used droids before to represent characters. It could also be a manipulated hologram. If Vader's last apprentice was helping the rebellion they wouldn't want that information to get out to the Empire. The writers wouldn't want it to be that obvious either. I'm not convinced it's her, but it would be cool if it was."
starwarsrebels,2x8eed,eth6113,2,Fri Feb 27 14:35:30 2015 UTC,Round of applause.  They'd never in 100 million years take a creative liberty in the disguised appearance of a character whose identity was being kept secret if the character had a very distinguished and recognizable physical feature.
starwarsrebels,2x8eed,zackmanze,5,Fri Feb 27 19:10:27 2015 UTC,It was already leaked in star wars insider that Fulcrum will be revealed in this episode   https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B-eDx86IQAAkaZE.jpg

starwarsrebels,2x8eed,matty25,1 point,Fri Feb 27 00:58:52 2015 UTC,I'd like to see fulcrum be Lux Bonteri from clone wars. There is a lot of setup for him to be a rebel
starwarsrebels,2x8eed,brownrc5,6,Thu Feb 26 18:20:06 2015 UTC,"He was annoying, got better, and then became more annoying. However, it would tie into Ahsoka."
starwarsrebels,2x8eed,FrankiePoops,2,Thu Feb 26 20:15:06 2015 UTC,"Just had this thought, Maybe Sabine dies.  Thinking about it the little symbol she uses becomes the symbol for the rebellion. Perhaps by dying Sabine becomes a martyr and they start using her symbol as a result."
starwarsrebels,2x8eed,mrpiggywinkles52,1 point,Fri Feb 27 23:53:53 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty obvious and makes sense, the season started with the inquisitor talkin to vader, it's going to end the same way, Vader is such a huge character and to have him fight just doesn't seem like this shows style, I feel he will just strike the inquisitor down or force choke him to death."
starwarsrebels,2x8eed,oakley_fan,1 point,Fri Feb 27 11:28:59 2015 UTC,"This would feel kinda lame, IMO.    They've hyped us up for an emotionally stirring death, or loss of some kind. They need to deliver on that in some capacity."

The emotional pay off of Fulcrum (Ahsoka) dying is (Probably, given that this episode is going to be thirty minutes) totally dependent upon familiarity with The Clone Wars."

starwarsrebels,2x8eed,zackmanze,0,Fri Feb 27 19:13:36 2015 UTC,My bet is that Ahsoka will either save Kanan or Ezra from the Inquisitor.
starwarsrebels,2x8eed,Jabster190,1 point,Fri Feb 27 03:09:51 2015 UTC,Gives more meaning to when the Inquisitor talks about a fight worthy of his training.  A Padawan trained by Vader himself before the fall who would've had plenty of time to continue training on her own...

starwarsrebels,2x6mue,LordUtinni,10,Thu Feb 26 01:47:49 2015 UTC,I think this has to do more with the west coast dock workers strike than anything else. Nintendo announced shortages of their new 3DS were a result of this very same issue.
starwarsrebels,2x6mue,sorcerer165,5,Thu Feb 26 12:10:32 2015 UTC,No actually its been like this for years to be honest on the west coast.
starwarsrebels,2x6mue,JabbaJohnL,5,Thu Feb 26 12:25:18 2015 UTC,"It's been bad everywhere for a few years, but this is a whole new level, and it's due in large part to the ports.  The Port of Long Beach dispute was only recently resolved, so hopefully things will start flowing more now.  Things are finally starting to pick up, though.  Targets are currently getting in the second waves of Saga Legends and Mission Series figures (including Sabine, AT-DP Pilot, Cikatro Vizago, and more).  Walmart is currently getting the first wave of Saga Legends (including Ezra, Kanan, Chopper, the Inquisitor, etc.)."

It seems like Hasbro was caught unawares by Rebels, in some way. They only had a few figures out by Christmas, so it seems most of the products were re-released ships (like Slave-1) and lightsabers with Rebels branding."

starwarsrebels,2x6mue,psychobilly1,1 point,Fri Feb 27 15:29:54 2015 UTC,I think it's just an extremely popular product. Which is good. Maybe more Rebels products being sold = more show budget which means better animation and maybe and extra season or 2.
starwarsrebels,2x59yx,Ledpinkphish,21,Wed Feb 25 19:48:33 2015 UTC,Those comments convinced me.  Fulcrum is Porkins!

starwarsrebels,2x59yx,RIP_Porkins,5,Thu Feb 26 03:33:23 2015 UTC,I'm not going lie.  I would approve.

starwarsrebels,2x59yx,BudgieAttackSquadron,11,Thu Feb 26 16:58:21 2015 UTC,I love non-news!  Them fanning the fires like this pretty much guarantees (in case you were still a sceptic up until now) that Fulcrum's identity will be revealed.   So hyped for Monday.
starwarsrebels,2x59yx,ImNotASWFanboy,3,Wed Feb 25 20:26:34 2015 UTC,"Haha, I know.  I got all excited and posted this link then realized that it really holds no info.    It is just pure hype, and it worked!  I can't wait for the reveal."

Wouldn't it be bizarre if they saw that Luke was a Jedi and didn't say 'oh yeah! we used to work with a jedi before you joined up"""
starwarsrebels,2x59yx,Lemonite,17,Thu Feb 26 03:34:59 2015 UTC,"I think Dodonna's line in ANH wishing the rebel pilots ""may the Force be with you"" is enough to prove that the Alliance isn't completely unfamiliar with the Jedi."
starwarsrebels,2x59yx,metallicabmc,11,Thu Feb 26 14:06:48 2015 UTC,"How so? The concept of Jedi doesn't seem like something the Rebel Alliance would be unfamiliar with, considering who its founding/leading members are."
starwarsrebels,2x59yx,SceptileMasterr,3,Thu Feb 26 06:17:30 2015 UTC,"With the old canon it was alright but even crazier because they could have said ""Oh yeah we used to work with Darth Vader's secret apprentice who could tear Star Destroyers out of the sky with the force."
starwarsrebels,2x59yx,cunningmunki,5,Thu Feb 26 08:10:28 2015 UTC,"Does anyone in general besides Leia/Han/etc actually know Luke is a Jedi before the end of the trilogy, though? He doesn't get any formal training in the Force until Yoda in ESB, which is followed by the whole thing with Cloud City, some running around after Han, then Jabba's palace which leads straight into the Battle of Endor. I doubt average Joe Rebel would have seen Luke as anything other than just a younger-than-average commander before RotJ."

When he confronted Kanan wearing one I was the slightest bit disappointed... In my mind, though, this isn't so much of a complaint as it is accolades for James Luceno's great job with the book. Luceno really made Tarkin a badass."
starwarsrebels,2x9iu1,Hoshell,6,Thu Feb 26 19:22:43 2015 UTC,"I see USA as The Republic at it's fall. Still defending democracy and freedom but also corrupt.  Russia is a true Empire. Putin ignores all international laws, uses it's military power to scare any possible rebellion(neighbour countries), seeds propaganda, crisis and chaos in ex-soviet countries and still praises soviet leaders despite the millions lives in Europe taken away by their hands. It's literally a public cult of terror.   Sorry for my english, greetings from Lithuania."
starwarsrebels,2x9iu1,shukowski,0,Thu Feb 26 20:08:33 2015 UTC,"I guess you probably would see Russia in that light as you were a small country beside a very large and belligerent superpower, swept up in the massive steamroller that was Russia during the second world war.  I guess they were the embodiment of the Empire in their sphere of influence just as America is the embodiment of the Empire in it's sphere of influence.  It all comes down to who is the one wielding power, and does that power corrupt.  I do believe it does invariably corrupt, and we all need to be vigilant as they each request a trade off of freedoms for greater security.  It is always a fools choice to accept less freedom for greater security.  Chances are we will lose both.  I do not hate either country, and in fact admire much in both, but we who are so close to these giants must be vigilant so as not to get trampled underfoot."
starwarsrebels,2x9iu1,shukowski,1 point,Fri Feb 27 00:34:31 2015 UTC,"I see Russia like this, because my country was occupied by them, people were kidnapped and banished to die in Siberia, hundreads of most inteligent people were killed, those left alive were tried to be russified, our history books were burnt and lithuanian language was forbid. They did this to most of the soviet members. That's not all. Stalin killed 7 million people in Ukraine - one of the cruelest genocydes in history. All that happened not so long ago and no one seems to remember. Russia refuses to admit most of the soviet crimes and world let's it get away so easily. Even now propaganda war, here in Baltic countries is at it's highest level, homosexuals in Russia are openly put to prison, western culture is demonized and in many ways not accesible on the internet, Russia started a war against Ukraine only because people wanted to get rid of ex-KGB agents in their government and join the EU.  You talk about USA as the Great Evil, and I know it has some problems with power managment, but compared to Russia, USA is still the land of freedom and our only hope in oncoming hybrid war with Russia."

starwarsrebels,2x4rqs,pufferpig,1 point,Thu Feb 26 17:04:36 2015 UTC,My guess is that The Inquisitor eats it. The show has mentioned that there are other inquisitors out there and I think an even more brutal one will replace him.

The projected holograms don't give away the size of Fulcrum, so s/he could be very small.  Col.

I'm probably wrong, but I think it's as good of a theory as any right now."

starwarsrebels,2x2ue7,mjsmith1223,3,Fri Feb 27 16:56:52 2015 UTC,The best thing about him is not any kind of singular vision that he has but it is his ability to create a team that has the decision rights to change ideas and give real input.

Kanan had an awesome way of disarming the Inqusitor ;D  http://i.imgur.com/027sUzQ.png  http://i.imgur.com/lye4vgf.png  I just wonder why Kanan doesn't use Ezra's saber's gun-ability when the nozzle was right next to the Inquisitors face? http://i.imgur.com/8F73h8G.png  also... is this gonna be the Rebellion's first proper battle? Would be fitting to have Mustafar be the site of the last battle in the birth of the Empire, and the first proper battle for the Rebellion. http://i.imgur.com/3XCNqmQ.png"

Unfortunately for the Rebellion, they're not going to win a battle for a few more years so it's at best some cover fire.  It's looks like something that could be called a first battle of the Alliance though.    I just keep seeing the Vader jump scares when I watch them; so tacky yet so frighteningly effective."

starwarsrebels,2wzdbe,pufferpig,3,Tue Feb 24 17:27:02 2015 UTC,Good guesses. I think Leia would be too young at this point though. My money is on Mon Mothma or Asoka.

starwarsrebels,2wzdbe,Binturung,12,Tue Feb 24 17:40:54 2015 UTC,That would be crazy in an awesome way. The exact opposite of the mentor figure dying trope. Surely they wouldn't give that moment away in the trailer so I think he will be okay. Jedi are pretty good with falling off of ledges and surviving.
starwarsrebels,2wzdbe,TheDidact118,13,Tue Feb 24 17:52:00 2015 UTC,Tell that to Mace Windu

starwarsrebels,2wzdbe,RVierra327,3,Wed Feb 25 02:31:58 2015 UTC,That's unfair. Made had his hand cut off and then pumped full of lightning and then was thrown out the window pretty far.
starwarsrebels,2wzdbe,Blackfire853,4,Wed Feb 25 01:02:52 2015 UTC,"I would much rather see that than another mentor dying, but I'm not completely sold they wouldn't reveal a bit of a tidbit like that. It kind of is a cliffhanger in the preview. Could go either way. I just can't believe it's only a 22 minute episode. How will they fit all this action in?!"
starwarsrebels,2wzdbe,Chewblacka,2,Tue Feb 24 18:23:57 2015 UTC,I can't see that happening. Ezra is meant to be the figure kids can identify with. I think the most likely options for someone dying on the Ghost crew (which I don't see happening this early in the series) would be Hera or Zeb. I don't think Sabine will eat it yet because we still know NOTHING of her past.
starwarsrebels,2wzdbe,negaprez,2,Tue Feb 24 18:25:54 2015 UTC,What if Ezra quite violently kills the Inquisitor out of hate? Would encompass all the talk of painfully emotional situations with Ezra

starwarsrebels,2wxayp,klaku_biceps,3,Wed Feb 25 15:57:36 2015 UTC,is the mustafar where the jedi prison from clone wars series was?
starwarsrebels,2wxayp,thatoneguy889,4,Tue Feb 24 16:25:05 2015 UTC,I think the one you are referring to is The Citadel on Lola Sayu. Mustafar is the lava planet where Kenobi cuts of Anakin's legs and left him to die in Revenge of the Sith.
starwarsrebels,2wxayp,klaku_biceps,2,Tue Feb 24 16:57:11 2015 UTC,"Yea I knew that's the place where the fight took place, just was wondering if it was the one with The Citadel, they seemed like one place to me, thanks for clarification"
starwarsrebels,2wxayp,Puppytron,2,Tue Feb 24 17:16:24 2015 UTC,"It is; and that has me a little confused. Why would Mustafar be considered ""The place where Jedi go to die""?   We (the audience) know what happened there, but who else (according to cannon) knows?"
starwarsrebels,2wxayp,RVierra327,1 point,Wed Feb 25 09:46:03 2015 UTC,"It may have since become a place for killing the Jedi remnants. This show is 13-14 years post-ROTS so things have likely changed from that point. TCW shows that Palpatine has used the planet for other uses before, so why not now?"
starwarsrebels,2wxayp,nightmare901,3,Thu Feb 26 16:35:29 2015 UTC,"Hera's last line raises an extremely interesting question.  ""Kanan told me Mustafar is where Jedi go to die.""  Now, Kanan has been deep in hiding for the past 15 years. It's unlikely that he's been in contact with any Jedi in that time, right? If I recall correctly, according to A New Dawn, Kanan was warned to stay away from the Jedi Temple, which is what allowed him to survive Order 66. But how would he have known that Mustafar was where Jedi went to die? There are three possibilities:  1) He somehow figured out that the Empire had been taking Jedi to Mustafar, whether it was public knowledge or an Imperial secret.  2) It was where they took his Master.  3) He was somehow able to contact Obi-Wan, who told him that Anakin had died on Mustafar.  I don't know, but it seems interesting."
starwarsrebels,2wxayp,polaristerlik,3,Thu Feb 26 23:49:25 2015 UTC,"or  4) he was one of Palpatine's spies, it was hinted in one of the episodes something like this anyway, can't remember which one. And we know that Palpatine was building a force sensitive spy army thingy from CW S2E3"
starwarsrebels,2wxayp,nightmare901,2,Fri Feb 27 01:08:54 2015 UTC,"Maybe. But I thought the whole Children of the Force thing didn't pan out, because Anakin and Ahsoka saved the kids? Did Palpatine have others? Not going to lie, that WOULD be interesting, but it's a bit of a stretch. Kanan was DEFINITELY a Padawan under Depa Billaba."
starwarsrebels,2wxayp,polaristerlik,2,Fri Feb 27 01:14:41 2015 UTC,those kids were recovered but I would think that Palpatine would continue trying something like this though
starwarsrebels,2wxayp,nightmare901,2,Fri Feb 27 01:31:00 2015 UTC,"Most definitely. It sounds like something Palpatine would do. Hell, maybe that program was the precursor to the Inquisition."

When the first movies came out (4,5,6) the technology to make it look cool was drastically different.  Then George thought he had to improve on the visuals at a crazy rate, which is why the prequels kind of looked a little more fake.  The best we have seen the falcon do was in Jedi, and it wasn't even Han (you could argue that Empire did a great job as well).     As for being a leader, he certainly didn't start out as one.  He was a nomad and self centered.  He didn't want to be a leader.    Another aspect is that every episode has pretty much one space dog fight in it, where the movies typically only have one or 2 per movie, giving fewer examples."

Hera's piloting is rendered in 2014 CGI and Han's piloting was done with 1977 special effects--its apples and oranges as far as what they could possibly show.    That being said, the most important things Han did in the movies generally didn't involve piloting so much as they involved bluffing, getting the hunk of junk to work, and shooting first.  If Hera were going to be as important as Han, she would have to be a much better pilot."

And that's just what's seen/claimed in the movies. Plus he's got a few smuggler's tricks up his sleeves, and whatever wizardry keeps the falcon from falling apart. Then again, hera flew a direct assault on an imperial convoy and won with the ghost. Among other feats.  Really, we'd, need to see them in action together to properly compare. Both in the same type of unmodified ship."
starwarsrebels,2wy5a0,Skyskinner,3,Fri Feb 27 13:19:20 2015 UTC,"Y'know, you just made me in think. Han says that The Falcon is the ship that made the Kessel run in under twelve parsecs, but he never claims to have been the one piloting it at the time. He implies it, of course, but the lack of a personal claim attached to the statement tells me there's a good possibility that maybe it wasn't him behind the yoke."

I watched the original trilogy when I was like 4-6 years old, but pretty much grew up on the prequels (RoTS is the only one I remember seeing in the cinema). I find myself speaking like JarJar sometimes xD  I just really wished they'd focused on something else, like [KINDA SPOILERS]: the rumored Republic Invasion of Mandalore Arc that would have Ahsoka fighting with the good Mandalorians (Bo Katan's gang) against the crime families, the remaining Death Watch splinter group and possibly the Republic forces. The invasion was at least hinted at when Obi-Wan and Bo Katan last spoke. (A Republic Invasion actually explains why Sabine Wren, Rebels, was in an Imperial Academy on Mandalore when she was younger)"

I've been obsessed with Boba Fett and mandalorians since I was about 3 years old.   According to ""legends"" EU, Mandalore was overtaken by the Empire, not the Republic and it was pretty much turned into a slave labor planet for mining mandalorian iron / beskar. I would have loved to see more of Bo Katan, however I have a feeling she might show up in Rebels. During an interview with Vanessa Marshall (posted a couple of days ago on here) she mentioned that she wanted a set of Bo Katan armor for cosplay, but she was encouraged not to by producers for reasons..."

The Emperor died because Vader picked him up and threw him into a shaft, surely he should've seen that coming, since he is so powerful and all knowing, right?  At any rate, there can only be two Sith, so I doubt the Inquisitor received any formal training in the Sith ways, he probably had some lightsaber combat lessons under Vader (assuming he was not a Jedi before being recruited) and a little talk about the force. They are holding out on him."
starwarsrebels,2wulif,Nihillo,3,Mon Feb 23 07:28:28 2015 UTC,"Could you imagine being on the school yard in 1982 and some kids are having a debate about who would win in some Star Wars fight, and you just tell them that the Emperor gets casually tossed down what may as well be a garbage bin? Or that Boba Fett would end up inside a monster that can't even move thanks to an accident?"
starwarsrebels,2wulif,Skyskinner,3,Fri Feb 27 17:13:16 2015 UTC,"Saber length?  I suppose it all depends on what they make out of the Inquisitors.  The Empire is kind of weird.  There's part of it that is all ""Empire"" like Tarkin.  And then there is the influence of the Sith.  (The Inquisitor answered to Vader in that little add-in scene, but then he acts like Tarkin's flunky in the latest episode.)  They no doubt serve a purpose of hunting down remnants and keeping an eye out for potentials and disappearing them.  But that is a mission within the imperial order.  You wouldn't want these guys to have skills above their rank and station or access to any of the 'higher mysteries' of the force beyond what they need to have to serve the new order.  ATM, the Inquisitors seem to be a bridge between the two aspects of the Empire.  I'm fine with them being relatively underpowered relative to what was seen in TCW.  In fact, I rather like the idea of them as the Empire's hounds (which I suppose is an interesting reflection on what the Jedi had become by the end of TCW).  The Sith are evil and all that, but the Empire is a far less fantastic and far more human evil."
starwarsrebels,2wulif,LionFox,2,Mon Feb 23 07:35:09 2015 UTC,"I think Tarkin and Vader are in that inner circle of people who are pretty trusted by Palpatine, so it is not a stretch that the Inquisitor is put under the command of Tarkin while he is dealing with the crew of the Ghost. Tarkin really is a way to show that the Empire is far more capable than the bumbling forces on Lothal."
starwarsrebels,2wulif,kittencannon,1 point,Mon Feb 23 14:54:22 2015 UTC,"(The Inquisitor answered to Vader in that little add-in scene, but then he acts like Tarkin's flunky in the latest episode.)   That makes total sense though - Vader and Tarkin are equals in rank."
starwarsrebels,2wulif,mutually_awkward,2,Tue Feb 24 19:44:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think he's more about being a symbol of fear for the the Jedi rather then being that powerful himself. His lightsaber is designed to be intimidating without having to exert much skill using it, and when torturing our hero, has to have a machine generate lightning, rather then using it himself."
starwarsrebels,2wulif,Whiteley79,1 point,Tue Feb 24 21:26:14 2015 UTC,"I reckon that the Inquisitor has potential to become a Sith lord if he was allowed more access to their secrets. But I suppose that the Emperor only reserves that privilege for himself and his apprentice.  You could also consider that the Inquisitor is already maxed out, it should put him on equal footing with Kanan."
starwarsrebels,2wulif,StormwolfMW,1 point,Mon Feb 23 12:26:21 2015 UTC,"Based on what I've seen so far, the guy is way too overpowered for a non-Sith."
starwarsrebels,2wulif,cunningmunki,2,Mon Feb 23 16:09:37 2015 UTC,I think he is just well versed in the force.  He is book smart.  Would he survive against someone who truly knows the power of the force?  I doubt it.  The jedi we have seen him face are not real jedi.  Kanan stopped being trained at a younger age and Ezra has no idea what he is doing. I think he just know more than the people we've seen him face.  Ezra and Kanan.  If he fought Obi I don't think the odds would be in the Inquisitors favor at all...
starwarsrebels,2wulif,Brookslangford,1 point,Mon Feb 23 21:37:31 2015 UTC,"In a word: Mid-boss.  He's been a good villain, especially for a young hero like Ezra, but his sadism and arrogance will almost certainly prove to be his undoing. He's been playing with Kanan and Ezra, and they've been getting better while he relies on the same cheap tricks like the surprise force shove and the saber disarm."
starwarsrebels,2wso0b,Crowey793,6,Sun Feb 22 20:57:40 2015 UTC,There is no reason to believe it is any different from an average episode.
starwarsrebels,2wso0b,Lemonite,1 point,Sun Feb 22 20:58:40 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair it is part two of a two part episode, so it should only be 22 minutes."
starwarsrebels,2wso0b,Sapitoelgato,1 point,Sun Feb 22 21:51:33 2015 UTC,"I was hoping it would be longer.  The ""Who Will Fall"" trailer looks so dope.  It's really picked up since Tarkin showed up."
starwarsrebels,2wso0b,5aucy,1 point,Thu Feb 26 17:38:19 2015 UTC,"Same, same. It looks as if some serious shit will be going down. I hope they don't rush it."
starwarsrebels,2wr0uv,comet997,14,Sun Feb 22 10:32:24 2015 UTC,"I do, actually, and it's bothered me since I know that both shows have the same length in terms of episodes. 22 minutes is about what it is on average. I think the argument 'time flies when you're having fun' would probably fit here."
starwarsrebels,2wr0uv,Kaweebo,3,Sun Feb 22 11:12:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure. There are plenty of TCW episodes I've enjoyed more than some episodes of Rebels, but they still feel longer."
starwarsrebels,2wr0uv,Cevan,7,Sun Feb 22 18:38:34 2015 UTC,I have definitely noticed this as well. Perhaps it's because Rebels has a slower pace and there are more slow scenes than TCW.
starwarsrebels,2wr0uv,ImNotASWFanboy,8,Sun Feb 22 11:53:35 2015 UTC,"Personally, I've felt that it's simply because TCW was always able to stretch its arcs over 3-4 episodes. In contrast, Rebels has been more contained per episode (thus far) which leaves the creators having to cram more into the short time."
starwarsrebels,2wr0uv,Lemonite,3,Sun Feb 22 17:54:28 2015 UTC,I agree with this. I dont know why other than a lot of people watch Clone Wars on Netflix in marathon fashion.

starwarsrebels,2wr0uv,Blackfire853,1 point,Sun Feb 22 21:03:58 2015 UTC,I think it is because a lot of us got to binge watch episodes of TCW whereas here we are actually waiting and watching every week.

starwarsrebels,2wozva,mjsmith1223,1 point,Sun Feb 22 20:23:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry, no time. Anyone have a recap of the good bits in this?"
starwarsrebels,2wn3yj,Lemonite,9,Sat Feb 21 08:56:44 2015 UTC,If anyone doesn't understand what Base Delta Zero is. It's what Darth Malak did to Taris. There is so much evidence right now that Lothal will have the same fate. It's been teased at twice in the show and a third time in Sabines rebel sketch book. Zare has been quietly removed off Lothal to another academy etc.
starwarsrebels,2wn3yj,Beaver_Lord,5,Sat Feb 21 19:07:35 2015 UTC,"Was going to bring this up.  By the way, here's the image for one of the teases for those who haven't heard this one: http://i.imgur.com/xvJ9Mfj.jpg  Even Tseebo couldn't access it.  I think its a bit early still.  But by blowing up the comm tower and taking down the data network, the imperials have shown that they will sacrifice limbs for the sake of the body.  For the moment, I suppose it depends on how strong the empire's interest on Lothal are and how long they remain worth it.  I'd start getting worried if they did not re-build the comm tower and kept up the stop-gap measures like droid couriers.  As a final note, we've still yet to meet the ever-absent Governor Price, so I don't think they're calling it wraps on Lothal quite so soon."
starwarsrebels,2wn3yj,LionFox,0,Sat Feb 21 19:43:10 2015 UTC,"But Lothal has been portrayed repeatedly as a backwater world. Devastating a planet like that would be an easy decision by from Tarkin to prove a point. He's the Governor of the Outer Rim, anything that happens here reflects on him. And that's even besides the fact that the Lothal rebels have personally undermined his interests."
starwarsrebels,2wn3yj,LionFox,1 point,Sat Feb 21 21:03:19 2015 UTC,"Well, note I said 'not yet' rather than 'never'.  It's not that I don't want to see new worlds but the whole 'Oh no, my beloved peasant village' bit is far more effective if you have a connection to a place.  But perhaps there is enough of one already.  I honestly expected them to string Traavis along for a bit longer as well.  I had a feeling he was a trap from his first appearance, and that was only confirmed after what went down at the Spire."
starwarsrebels,2wn3yj,snackynak,2,Sun Feb 22 00:10:05 2015 UTC,"I definitely understand that. Personally, though, I really feel this show is going to continue moving a lot faster than you expect. Much like what you're saying about the Trayvis arc's quick conclusion. I really and truly expect that we're only getting 3 seasons of Rebels, perhaps 4 at the most, and I very much believe the rate and importance of events is going to escalate dramatically very soon in the timeline."
starwarsrebels,2wn3yj,Lurkndog,4,Sun Feb 22 00:46:38 2015 UTC,"I suppose it would be possible because the empire might want to test the prototype first before the full construction. Also in a new hope, tarkin did mention that dantooine wouldn't be an effective demonstration because it was too remote. That line could be retconed to imply that the empire had already blown up a remote world and no one really noticed."
starwarsrebels,2wn3yj,snackynak,3,Sun Feb 22 07:07:53 2015 UTC,I doubt a proto Death Star array would be nearly as destructive as the real deal. Therefore preserving the real demonstration for ANH.
starwarsrebels,2wn3yj,pufferpig,3,Sun Feb 22 08:41:27 2015 UTC,"I'm having a hard time reconciling genocide and Disney XD. Moreover, I don't think destroying Lothal would make a whole lot of sense given that it is a valuable mining and manufacturing center.   A better alternative would be for the Empire to simply flood the planet with stormtroopers and probe droids, so that the crew of the Ghost can't operate there any more. The Empire can defeat our little group of rebels with overwhelming force, but it will cost them a LOT to do so. Our heroes leave, but in terms of dollars and cents, they have scored a victory by tying up a vast amount of the Empire's capital.   Another alternative is that the season will end with the crew of the Ghost finally getting to meet Fulcrom, and seeing the real strength of the Rebel Alliance. Basically, they wind up on Yavin IV."
starwarsrebels,2wn3yj,snackynak,4,Sat Feb 21 21:45:09 2015 UTC,"More than likely they would wind up on dantooine at this point, Yavin IV a bit later perhaps. Depends on how close this show gets to ANH, though it is only 4 years off in the time line."
starwarsrebels,2wn3yj,pufferpig,4,Sun Feb 22 07:02:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm actually really hoping to see Dantooine on this show. If atleast just to canonize the look of the planet. I wonder if they'll take any inspiration from KOTOR in doing that. Morroband at least looks identical to Korriban."
starwarsrebels,2wn3yj,TakeMyUsernameAgain,1 point,Sun Feb 22 14:45:00 2015 UTC,"Personally I like the look from Star Wars galaxies, though, it was pretty similar to KOTOR is some areas."

starwarsrebels,2wp4yc,Chewblacka,8,Sat Feb 21 22:04:15 2015 UTC,The droid arcs in Clone Wars were horrible and most of the same writers work on Rebels. So I hope not.
starwarsrebels,2wp4yc,Beaver_Lord,3,Sat Feb 21 22:12:58 2015 UTC,I don't disagree that D squad was not great but the Jar Jar and Padme arcs were much much worse. Take away the stupid frog commander and it would not have been that bad.  I think it makes sense within the context of R2 and Chop both being in the rebellion.   They have already had Chewy. I think r2 makes the cut
starwarsrebels,2wp4yc,Nihillo,4,Sat Feb 21 22:38:08 2015 UTC,"Was there even a good R2-D2 episode in the Clone Wars? I mean, they were alright, but none of them ever stood out to me as ""must watch"" episodes.   I'd rather they did not spend so much time and money on filler episodes this time around, lest the series end up cancelled like Clone Wars did and we get something like the droids arc in the final season, when there's still so many things to be further developed in the story."
starwarsrebels,2wp4yc,zackmanze,4,Sat Feb 21 22:28:57 2015 UTC,"They've already had an episode with R2 and 3PO, but as far as one off filler episodes, this show doesn't seem nearly as liberal with them as Clone Wars was.  Wouldn't count on it."
starwarsrebels,2wp4yc,Brookslangford,3,Sat Feb 21 22:18:22 2015 UTC,Dude they had Lando and a pufferpig. There is room for a bit of whimsy in this show. They have just dialed up the intensity up in the last few shows. If the seasons are 22 eps then there will be some filler in there to be sure
starwarsrebels,2wp4yc,triarii3,2,Sat Feb 21 23:53:04 2015 UTC,The Lando episode was filler but the Hera and Sabine episode felt like it when it was new but now we know that it was a set up for a battle with the inquisitor.  So maybe the Lando episode will have some effect on the rest of the series...
starwarsrebels,2wn01p,Yawa306,13,Sat Feb 21 07:47:22 2015 UTC,"Hera is the only link to the Rebellion, and if she dies, the ghost crew have no contact. Plus, she is recording episodes for season 2."

starwarsrebels,2wn01p,Beaver_Lord,3,Sat Feb 21 19:14:22 2015 UTC,"But the voice actor confirmed she is recording season 2, so she won't die in season 1."

starwarsrebels,2wn01p,taste1337,3,Sat Feb 21 13:13:23 2015 UTC,I don't think they'd kill off one of the main cast of heroes so early in the show. Usually that's saved for villains if they're going to kill anyone at the end of Season 1. Maybe Kanan tries to save Agent Kallus but can't stop him from falling into the lava.
starwarsrebels,2wn01p,ImNotASWFanboy,2,Sat Feb 21 13:50:45 2015 UTC,"Damn, that would be amazing, Agent Kallus is definitely the least evil of the main villains"
starwarsrebels,2wn01p,Blackfire853,3,Sat Feb 21 17:26:57 2015 UTC,He's also been criticised a lot by Tarkin and shown to be pretty ineffective against this group.

starwarsrebels,2wn01p,LordUtinni,2,Sat Feb 21 18:28:12 2015 UTC,"If it's anyone it'll be Kanan.  Same as Obi Wan.  Ahsoka becomes the Yoda figure.    Kanan's the only person who can die and come back, you know?"
starwarsrebels,2wn01p,zackmanze,2,Sat Feb 21 20:59:41 2015 UTC,Not sure about that. Yoda and Obi Wan had to do special training to come back as a force ghost. Kanan never completed his training
starwarsrebels,2wn01p,snackynak,1 point,Sun Feb 22 03:32:01 2015 UTC,"Yep. This is where I'm a bit lost. Kanan dying makes a bunch of sense, but if he's to come back as a force ghost, that breaks some canon."
starwarsrebels,2wn01p,zackmanze,2,Sun Feb 22 07:58:47 2015 UTC,"If fulcrum turns out to be Ahsoka, or if Ahsoka turns up in the next episode, they could kill her off."
starwarsrebels,2wn01p,snackynak,2,Sun Feb 22 03:14:11 2015 UTC,"I think it'd be a ridiculous waste to kill her in one episode, so I doubt that."
starwarsrebels,2wn01p,Mojo1200,1 point,Mon Feb 23 05:06:41 2015 UTC,"It would be a cameo essentially. She has been around a lot longer than one episode, try 5 seasons. Also, it wouldn't have to be in one episode either."

starwarsrebels,2wks10,Lumberj,9,Fri Feb 20 19:33:57 2015 UTC,"He later tweets that he went crazy, and Hera's voice actor was speechless. Also, the voice actor of Hera mention on The Commlink that she was in tears of Ezra's performance in a future episode. Add in the fact Kanan's voice actor did a secret recording for season 2 that only him and Filoni have heard that is supposed to be very movie and is about his past. So we can assume that those three live into season 2, but we don't know if Ezra or anyone defects to the Empire. We will see something that pushes Kanan and teach him the value of being a Jedi. I am excited."
starwarsrebels,2wks10,Sapitoelgato,12,Fri Feb 20 19:49:30 2015 UTC,Ezra's is falling to the dark. I can already see it.
starwarsrebels,2wks10,DanielYMoi,4,Fri Feb 20 20:49:42 2015 UTC,"I see the darkness in him, but this is a pretty common theme for young Jedi, to struggle with the Dark Side. I don't think he'll ultimately fall to it but I could see him tapping into it again like he did when he was controlling that huge monster. I think if we see anyone actually fall to the dark side it's going to be that one kid from the academy, the informant. I think we may see his sister on Mustafar, it's where young sith were trained by Darth Sidious at one point iirc."
starwarsrebels,2wks10,TrustmeIknowaguy,7,Fri Feb 20 22:28:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know. They really seem to tease at his Dark Side a lot. They didn't even come close seeing Ahsoka's struggle with the Dark Side in TCW, because she really didn't have one. She did turn Dark Side in the Mortis arc, but that was not her doing and only lasted 5 minutes and pretty much never spoken of again. They've gone out of their way a bit to almost show this as a reoccurring theme with Ezra."
starwarsrebels,2wks10,ShadowEye37,3,Fri Feb 20 23:54:42 2015 UTC,"Naw, I don't see it in his character at all. He's a good person, a good kid and won't fall to the Dark Side.

To be honest, I wouldn't want Fulcrum to be Mon Mothma or something like that, it would be... well, boring, but Ezra's mom? Sure, that's fine, it's a good way to introduce his parents into the plot.  It does beg the question: if they are still alive and they are not imperial prisoners, then why did they leave Ezra behind? To protect him from being prosecuted by the empire? If that's it, then they should have thought of that before they started broadcasting anti-imperial propaganda, no point in having children if you are going to abandon them and pursue your political agenda out on your own."
starwarsrebels,2wgqjg,Nihillo,15,Thu Feb 19 20:23:01 2015 UTC,What if Ezra's mom is Mon Mothma?

If you knew that, you wouldn't drag him around where he could be captured by the Empire just for being with you.  And they probably though Lothal was out of the way enough to help him skip notice."
starwarsrebels,2wgqjg,nightmare901,6,Sat Feb 21 07:38:31 2015 UTC,I want it to be Chuchi. She was a fine lady.
starwarsrebels,2wgqjg,diamondcreeper,2,Thu Feb 19 22:02:31 2015 UTC,Chuchi baybee. That wouldn't be unwelcome.
starwarsrebels,2wgqjg,Delta64,11,Thu Feb 19 22:14:56 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, this DOES make sense. I do, however, feel obligated to test it.   The main issue I have with this theory is the conversation that Hera and Tseebo had. Hera seemed to not know what happened to the Bridgers before talking to Tseebo. That's the last we see of Tseebo; he's presumed to be with Fulcrum now. Now, the interesting part is that AFTER we see Ezra and Kanan rejoin the crew, Hera WANTS to tell Ezra about his parents; something that she'd be unlikely to do if she found out about Fulcrum's identity, or already knew. It seems likely that Fulcrum would swear her to silence if she knew.   As for the whole ""horns' thing, it IS a fair point, but the hologram could easily be staged.   It is a really good theory, though!"

starwarsrebels,2wgqjg,Lanuria,4,Thu Feb 19 20:21:57 2015 UTC,"Fulcrum seemed particularly concerned with keeping Ezra under wraps after he spoke out publicly at the end of 'Call to action'.   Ahsoka/Fulcrum would also have an interest in keeping Ezra incognito, considering he's a powerful force-sensitive outside of the Emperor's immediate grasp and possible jedi in training.   Great theory though! It would certainly be an award-winning reveal."
starwarsrebels,2wgqjg,chaos9001,3,Fri Feb 20 03:12:03 2015 UTC,"but, but, but... The leaks... they say Ahsoka... [insert childish fussing] I want my Snips back dammit!  Edit: As much as I hate to say it, you might have hit the jackpot here :/  Edit 2: Here is the voice decoded (from Rebel Resolve). Still not sure if that's Ahsoka to be honest https://soundcloud.com/shaakti1138/rebel-resolve-fulcrum-audio-pitch-changes"
starwarsrebels,2wgqjg,zackmanze,3,Thu Feb 19 22:31:53 2015 UTC,"I haven't listened to the original voice alteration since it was made but I remember that first one sounding way more like Ahsoka than this. In Rebel Resolve, they clearly aren't trying to hide that the voice is female, but the pitch change now takes the opposite route of it being Ahsoka.    Well played, Filoni. I bet you're having boat-loads of fun reading stuff like this."
starwarsrebels,2wgqjg,Cevan,4,Fri Feb 20 14:07:19 2015 UTC,"I don't hear Ahsoka at all in those voices and honestly, it doesn't sound in character like her at all.   Ahsoka? Telling people to go into hiding? To back down from a fight? To leave someone behind? Hardly her at all."
starwarsrebels,2wgqjg,cunningmunki,11,Thu Feb 19 23:32:15 2015 UTC,Hardly her 15 years ago at least.
starwarsrebels,2wgqjg,thewookie15,10,Fri Feb 20 00:53:51 2015 UTC,"The speech pattern is like, spot on.  I don't see how there's any debate at all.    As far as her and any objection to hiding?  (Hypothetically) She's been in hiding for fifteen years."
starwarsrebels,2wgqjg,zackmanze,3,Fri Feb 20 02:34:23 2015 UTC,"You seem to forget it's been 15 or 16 years since Ahsoka left the Order. A lot can happen in that amount of time, especially considering Ahsoka is now about 30 years old, wheras in TCW she was still a teenager. In addition to that, the last time we saw her she was being charged with a crime she didn't commit, and it turned out the true criminal and the person who framed her was one of her closest friends."

starwarsrebels,2wgqjg,iowajaycee,5,Sat Feb 21 04:38:46 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really make sense.  Zeebo already told Hera whatever happened to Ezra's parents, and the secrecy around that just doesn't really make sense on anyone's behalf.    Regarding his/her concern for Ezra, it's because he's a Jedi.  I thought that was pretty clear.    The other thing, why would they mask Fulcrum's voice?  We don't know what Ezra's mom sounds like. Whoever Fulcrum is, the way they've presented the mystery around them makes it pretty clear that we already know the character.    Safe money's on Ashoka. She's unaccounted for and we already know the speech patterns line up incredibly.  Regarding the hood and not being able to see the horns; come on guys.  If they're going to the length to make her identity a secret, they're not gonna spill the beans like that. I think Leia is also a possibility, everyone is saying she's too young, but she and Luke are the same age as Ezra and Sabine.  She's literally only a few days/weeks younger than Ezra actually.   The mystery regarding Ezra's parents is something I think we might see a hint of in the season finale, but I imagine they'll save that for season 2."
starwarsrebels,2wgqjg,LordUtinni,2,Fri Feb 20 02:29:47 2015 UTC,Crap.  Wanted Asajj and/or Ahsoka.  This now seems so obvious that anything else seems silly.
starwarsrebels,2wgqjg,HenryChinaskiForPrez,3,Thu Feb 19 20:33:09 2015 UTC,"God, Asajj would be a twist.  That would be super cool. It's totally Ahsoka though, don't worry."

Depending on the lengths to which they think the Empire might go, a member of any species with notable characteristics might do something like this.  And Togruta are particularly communal.  If something happened (e.g. intercepted transmission, information from an interrogation of one of Fulcrum's contacts, you name it) and it becomes known that some Togruta was coordinating rebel groups it would be very interesting to the Empire.  Skywalker's former padawan is known at large and even has some experience as a Padawan coordinating such groups (i.e. Onderon).  Side note: If you read the novel Tarkin, Tarkin does a rather impressive job of identifying who his rebels in that book are based on very little information."

Right around the forehead, there is a break in the image projected.  When I first watched this, I though that it just had to do with the background as there is a bulkhead line that is nearly at the same level.  On a closer look, not only the colors but the LINES of the hologram don't match and are otherwise quite steady.  Could be nothing.  Could be hiding a set of montrals.

starwarsrebels,2wguhd,LionFox,4,Thu Feb 19 23:19:22 2015 UTC,"Watch Rebel Resolve. The clearer part of the hologram, the part you think that is 'shopped' is actually the refresh of the hologram. Like when you film an old PC screen and when you watch the recording you see a 'block' going from the bottom of the screen to the top, while the PC screen is refreshing.  EDIT : See the hologram of Leia here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIFJLMyUwrg .

I think the best we could hope for is some training of the inquisitor perhaps.   The weight Vader would bring to the show is palpable. I think it changes the whole show if he is on it which is why I am just not sure if they do it or not.
starwarsrebels,2w6zg2,DanielYMoi,2,Tue Feb 17 21:58:58 2015 UTC,And tbh I don't think a small band of rebels is worth any of Vader's time.
starwarsrebels,2w6zg2,comet997,6,Tue Feb 17 22:11:17 2015 UTC,See that is the part I just don't agree with. I understand that it is a necessary plot device for the show. However two guys swinging lightsabers?? There cant be too much of that going on in the galaxy. That is surely worth Vader's attention. Not to mention I think Vader would sense the disturbance in the force.

starwarsrebels,2w6zg2,Skeezypal,3,Tue Feb 17 23:42:25 2015 UTC,She is not in the original trilogy. I hate to say it but she pretty much has to die to make the pieces fit together since you know Vader made it. Also Yoda referred to Luke and Leia as the only hope. Implication that Ashoka is gone
starwarsrebels,2w6zg2,FrankiePoops,2,Thu Feb 19 02:04:40 2015 UTC,Unless Luke and Leia were their last hope... from a certain point of view. We all know how much Jedi love being cryptic.

starwarsrebels,2w6zg2,LinktheJedi,17,Tue Feb 17 17:08:37 2015 UTC,"I'm eager to see what his fighting style will look like on-screen; we've seen Vader in combat in video-games, comic books and etcetera, but never in a movie-esque situation, where he is depicted exactly like he was in the original trilogy. I'm sure the animation crew will have a blast trying to make his attacks look cumbersome and stiff, but still powerful and deadly.  An Ahsoka vs Vader fight should be pretty interesting as well, Ahsoka is a very acrobatic fighter, and Vader is sluggish, so I imagine Vader will have to rely on the force and his skill in combat to survive his bout with her."

As for she not wanting to have one, I could see that happening yeah, and she probably didn't want to attract any attention once order 66 came along, but I bet she has at least one lighstaber. If Ahsoka is really Fulcrum, then she needs to be pragmatic and utilize all of the tools at her disposal to defeat the empire. I'm sure she realizes that eventually an inquisitor or a force user will come after her, therefore, she needs a weapon that can block a lightsaber blow.

The Death Star might not be ready yet but I'm sure he has other means.   ""He's no good to me dead"". Great to hear that line.  Did the Inquisitor need the torture device as he couldn't produce lightning himself? I'm guessing so.  Will we see more of Zare Leonis? His explanation that he was being moved off world can't have been for nothing.  I loved seeing Hera really pissed. Wouldn't want to mess with her. She's become one of my favourite characters in the series.  Chopper is a real mixed bag me. Just as I was thinking' yeah you go Chop', he punts the other droid out of the Ghost.

starwarsrebels,2w56bb,newtype06,3,Tue Feb 17 14:10:17 2015 UTC,FU is part of the old EU pre-Disney so therefore it is not considered to be canon to the franchise.

starwarsrebels,2w56bb,Creski,0,Wed Feb 18 15:24:24 2015 UTC,Evidently you didn't play through it because Vader wasn't a pushover to beat. At least the scene was made to feel as such.

He was poorly written in the game and the voice actor they used was also a cheap copy as well.   The Force Unleashed really sucked and TFU2 was such a phoned in sequel, so it disappointing that you want TFU storyline to be cannon when out of all the star wars games you picked the one that....A: gives ludicrous abilities to the force. B: Cheapens and discredits one of the greatest villains of all time, and C: Has a plot that destroys one of the very foundations of the Rebellion which is regular people rising up to fight an empire.  What we have in TFU is a really shitty jedi/sith spy movie plot involving a False Flag Operation that is shoehorned in with a really bad romance story.  Second, Vader gets his ass beat so often it really cheapens his character."

Also even though I was hoping it was not, but now I'm pretty sure that Fulcrum is Ashoka."

I don't imagine the horns being foldable at the top... Could she be using a cloak over some sort of dummy? How else could she hide her form?  Case Point: http://heruniverse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/576273_453528991353067_1081881799_n.jpg  Also... Going by the Mortis vision, an older Ahsoka sure has some big horns. Even if that vision represented her ""potential future"", I don't think that Filoni and Co would stray too much from that path in regards to her looks/body shape. http://lightsaberrattling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/AhsokaTanoOlder.jpg"

What if Ahsoka was found some time after EpIII and thus tasked with protecting young Leia?!  Not training her in the Force of course, but just keeping an eye out, like Obi-Wan did with Luke.  Just picture it: Luke being protected by Obi-Wan (Anakin's mentor) and Leia by Ahsoka (his old padawan). That would be awesome! ...and a brilliant F.U. to Vader :P  Seriously, who better to protect them, than the man who trained Anakin, and the Padawan Anakin trained. If anyone could be powerful enough to defend them against Vader it would be those two!

I just think it'd be weird if she played a big central part in the Rebellion, but if she was working for the Organas or someone I could definitely get down on that."
starwarsrebels,2w29re,Chewblacka,9,Mon Feb 16 22:13:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Yeah, it could work, alright... but then she'll probably die on Alderaan... If not in a fight against Vader.  She/Fulcrum seems to be alluding to Vader and Palps when she mentions that The Ghost's crew's activities have gotten the attention of people ""at the top"" of the Empire etc.   Maybe Vader is on his way soon. It really would be interesting to see them meet. But if she did learn his identity than she has to die pretty quick, seeing as its kept a secret all up until Empire Strikes Back.  But oh how delightfully terrifying it is that their paths might be getting closer and closer to crossing :P"

starwarsrebels,2vtyhj,chaos9001,6,Sat Feb 14 15:50:45 2015 UTC,I think that is what was stated before new cannon.
starwarsrebels,2vtyhj,username1012357654,5,Sat Feb 14 16:33:37 2015 UTC,in the clone wars Ahsoka was on trial and the penalty for being found guilty was execution. Bariss was the one who committed the crime so she would be executed in Ahsoka's place.
starwarsrebels,2vtyhj,chaos9001,14,Sat Feb 14 18:41:52 2015 UTC,In a just world yes.   But this is Sidious we are taking about here.    She could be all sorts of executed on paper.
starwarsrebels,2vtyhj,Tuskin38,3,Sat Feb 14 19:07:29 2015 UTC,That was the old canon.
starwarsrebels,2vtyhj,grogleberry,2,Sat Feb 14 16:50:23 2015 UTC,The Clone Wars is canon.

starwarsrebels,2vtyhj,Snorhax,11,Thu Feb 19 04:21:49 2015 UTC,Let me just list a few. The Inquisitor is part of a larger group dedicated to hunting jedi. This was mentioned at the top but I was thinking this from the start: Ezra becomes an Inquisitor.  We will see Mandalore again. Fulcrum is Garm Bel Iblis (wishful thinking that will never happen). The end of the series will be the theft of the Death Star plans. Darth Vader will become main antagonist he will kill Kanan.  Also the whole Base Delta Zero theory about Lothal being destroyed.
starwarsrebels,2vtyhj,BudgieAttackSquadron,3,Sat Feb 14 03:05:16 2015 UTC,"If Fulcrum was Garm Bel Iblis, then people would be clamouring for a certain blue-skinned Admiral to show up, and Rebels would be a perfect point timeline-wise to introduce hi, back into canon without necessarily doing the Thrawn trilogy. As long as Pellaeon was there, too.  Granted, that'd never happen.  Also, I've been assuming from the start that the grand finale of Rebels will be stealing the Death Star plans, leading to the Rebel Alliance's ""first major victory"" referred to in the opening crawl of A New Hope."
starwarsrebels,2vtyhj,Snorhax,1 point,Wed Feb 18 00:15:22 2015 UTC,"Well they could definitely have the characters without that story, I hate that when people bring up those characters and assume that automatically translates to the Thrawn trilogy being canon. A lot of those characters in that story would fit in Rebels but that story could not happen."
starwarsrebels,2vtyhj,BudgieAttackSquadron,2,Wed Feb 18 00:24:18 2015 UTC,"My point exactly. A lot of main plot points could still happen, though obviously not in the same way. Still the writers wouldn't be obligated to do that and I think it's fine keeping those events Legends. And I just remembered my real favourite character from the Thrawn trilogy, but I doubt Talon Karrde will ever return. Then again, we do have Hondo Onaka who's kind of a similar character."

starwarsrebels,2vtyhj,Slimy_Shart_Socket,5,Sat Feb 14 21:38:49 2015 UTC,I think it would be really cool if he took over Star Killers story line.   Could you imagine him being a Jedi!?!?
starwarsrebels,2vtyhj,Lemonite,2,Sat Feb 14 22:11:02 2015 UTC,"But Maul was manically evil following his ""revival"". I find the idea of him changing sides hard to swallow."
starwarsrebels,2vtyhj,Saseav,7,Tue Feb 17 19:07:29 2015 UTC,"Ezra will be main sith from ep 7, and Ezra kills Kanan.  Lothal will be the new Toprawa(ie cities razed and planet forced into poverty for a very long time), series will end with a look at the cost of the Rebel crew brought to lothal. bold,  and unlikely."
starwarsrebels,2vtyhj,Binturung,6,Sun Feb 15 11:48:01 2015 UTC,Maul is Fulcrum.
starwarsrebels,2vtyhj,Its_Beerdy,14,Sun Feb 15 18:54:41 2015 UTC,"I keep seeing Ideas that Ashoka is Fulcrum or will show up at some point to help the rebels. I really like that idea (I really liked her character), but I propose another idea: Ashoka comes back on the side of the Empire. I know it sounds crazy but stay with me.   She was extremely loyal to the Republic and through out The Clone Wars showed how naive she was in her support (i.e. her treatment of Lux Bonteri for being a separatist)  She was extremely loyal to Anakin, who could have pursued her and recruited her after becoming Vader.  She was so disillusioned with the Jedi Order and the short comings of the Old Republic that she may be enticed by the Empire and the New Order.    I know this is a long shot, and probably won't be a very popular theory, but as long as we're talking BOLD predictions I thought I'd throw it out there. Keep in mind I hope I'm wrong, as I really want to see Ashoka fighting for the rebels at some point."
starwarsrebels,2vtyhj,leakime,12,Sat Feb 14 02:30:59 2015 UTC,But a lot of her story arcs were based around her learning the shades of grey in the clone wars and becoming disallusioned with the jedi order and the republic. She's a rebel through and through by the end of season 5.
starwarsrebels,2vtyhj,ramonm2,5,Sat Feb 14 09:06:56 2015 UTC,Mining plays a bigger role in the show than we think. We've seen two mentions of Kybal Crystals. We know the Empire is looking for some.

starwarsrebels,2vtyhj,armakaryk,14,Sat Feb 14 06:59:30 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I hope not. Does Fett really need to be shoehorned into everything? The stealing of the Death Star plans is described as the first real victory for the Alliance. Having them just hire a bounty hunter to do it kind of cheapens that, doesn't it?"
starwarsrebels,2vtyhj,jlo80,7,Sat Feb 14 07:25:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know if that rumor holds weight in light of what's happened in Marvel's Darth Vader #1. That story seems like the first direct interaction between Fett the Bounty Hunter and Vader, and if he was even tangentially responsible for the Death Star plans being leaked I don't think Vader would knowingly hire him."

starwarsrebels,2vqnf2,oldschoolsensei,21,Fri Feb 13 05:56:46 2015 UTC,There was a hypothesis that Fulcrum is actually Hondo Onaka.  That would be very interesting as he was one of the better side-characters in TCW
starwarsrebels,2vqnf2,BlueSmoke95,5,Fri Feb 13 14:19:52 2015 UTC,"I would be very much ok with it being Hondo, but he doesn't seem a likely candidate to me."
starwarsrebels,2vqnf2,BurningBushJr,8,Sat Feb 14 14:16:13 2015 UTC,I loved Hondo. That would be awesome.
starwarsrebels,2vqnf2,RogueLieutenant,8,Fri Feb 13 17:04:47 2015 UTC,Jim Cummings confirmed Hondo is in Rebels. 😊
starwarsrebels,2vqnf2,RealVoltar,1 point,Fri Feb 13 23:41:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know if Fulcrum would benefit from that  but it would really be an interesting new direction for Hondo.  I think his personality would turn Fulcrum into the underworld's Wizard of Oz...though the more I think about it...  Since we're getting Hondo, it's not unreasonable to think Katooni may have found her way to him if she escaped 66 and if Ahsoka is in fact in the episode (per questionable rumor), that would be an interesting opportunity to keep Ahsoka's unique post-mortem perspective on the Jedi Order in any mentorship of Katooni; making Ahsoka and Kanan a little more expendable.  Sorry for the vomit but it did get me thinking and typing at the same time."
starwarsrebels,2vqnf2,boomkinburger,10,Wed Feb 18 15:24:17 2015 UTC,"I'm really hoping that Fulcrum is either Mon Mothma or a new character, and Ahsoka is working WITH them. I have no issues with Ahsoka being part of Fulcrum's network, but having her be a spy in the Empire and getting all the supplies/intel doesn't fit. You'd think she'd stick out like a sore thumb. She wasn't some nobody Jedi."
starwarsrebels,2vqnf2,ArcticTerrapin,6,Fri Feb 13 21:23:24 2015 UTC,yeah especially being Anakin's apprentice... she'd get recognized pretty easily...

Just my thought."
starwarsrebels,2vqnf2,Cevan,25,Fri Feb 13 12:44:28 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. Some (myself included) believe there are two possible reasons for this.   The image may actually be photoshopped as a misdirection, much like in The Clone Wars when the trailer for the final arc of season 5 edited the color of Barriss' lightsaber. This theory is supported by two things: The first being the fact that the vertical lines in the hologram don't match up; there's a point where they change and don't align. The second being you can see a strange speck or something atop the robe. This is in the general area Ahsoka's horns would be positioned at, so it's possible in editing the image they missed that little bit. The second theory is that Ahsoka is speaking through a droid, which is wearing the robe. She actually has used this sort of strategy before; in The Clone Wars episode ""Assassin,"" Ahsoka put a betty bot droid under a robe which Padmé spoke through, as Padmé had been under attack from bounty hunter Aurra Sing."
starwarsrebels,2vqnf2,kipperson,8,Fri Feb 13 13:24:54 2015 UTC,"The lines not matching up is most likely just an artifact of Star Wars holograms aliasing like old cathode ray tube monitors.  Don't forget too that Togruta horns hang down as well as go up.  If they shopped the top of her head she would still have horns going down to her waist.  If this is altered, it's more likely that they just put an entirely different bust in for this still rather than photoshop it after the fact.  But if this scene in the show is a hologram of Fulcrum and there are Togruta horns plainly showing, that's basically the Ahsoka reveal and kind of an anticlimactic one at that."
starwarsrebels,2vqnf2,Jumbify,2,Fri Feb 13 15:34:37 2015 UTC,Yeah they wouldn't let us see the horns and such until they are ready to to do big reveal.

starwarsrebels,2vqnf2,kipperson,0,Wed Feb 18 16:06:12 2015 UTC,Woah.  If that is supposed to be fulcrum then something isn't right.  Still looks like a force user because they love hoods.  Asajj maybe?  Asajj and Ashoka forming the ultimate team and using the voice masking software to act as a single person?
starwarsrebels,2vqnf2,Lanuria,6,Fri Feb 13 13:30:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not a big fan of 'Tapping into the dark side' idea from a story point of view, but I agree with most of your post.   I want Ahsoka to be a Rebel fighter somewhere, not someone who is collecting supplies. I'm hoping for Bail, Mon Mothma and Garm Ben Iblis and Ahsoka being a sort of sword for those guys. Bail knows about the crew of the ghost, so that's a possibility and I really REALLY want to see Mon Mothma's story. She's one of my favorite characters.   Ahsoka most likely knew those senators and could have contacted them after the Empire took over. She was loyal to the Republic and I'm sure she'd have some issues with Palps being the Emperor. She's no longer a Jedi, so Idk if she'd be hunted down, but she still has to stay under the radar. I like the idea of her hunting down Inquisitors.   Got a little ramble there. I want to see Ahsoka, but I want to see her in a role more suiting to her skills."

starwarsrebels,2vqnf2,MadMan2012,10,Wed Feb 18 05:23:26 2015 UTC,"I like Ashoka too but I really don't want to see here appear in as a central part of Rebels. I really hope that if she does show up as too concerned about hiding than fighting a rebellion. I have always figured that the Emperor would have had a special hit squad to track her down for Order 66, forcing her too deep into hiding to be of help. I'd rather that Fulcrum was Leia who is proving herself as a handler to build credit to form the Rebel Alliance.  As far as Ashoka appearance, I would like to see the Spectre team to assist her in escaping the Empire. She passes off some wisdom and advice for Ezra's training along with some pointers on how to fight their rebellion more efficiently. She can be passed off to Fulcrum to be passed off to another Rebel group like a traveling mentor strengthening the rebellion before it becomes the Alliance."
starwarsrebels,2vqnf2,RealVoltar,7,Wed Feb 18 05:41:56 2015 UTC,Leia is the same age as Ezra... I find Ahsoka being Fulcrum more believable than a kid being him/her.
starwarsrebels,2vqnf2,RealVoltar,0,Fri Feb 13 12:54:46 2015 UTC,"Really? Because at that age her mother was queen of an entire solar system. Remember that Leia is being raised by a very big idealist, Bail Organa. Who has already been shown to be in support of the Rebels from the second episode. Also at her age she is less likely to catch the eye of Imperials as an agent of the rebellion."

starwarsrebels,2vqnf2,snackynak,1 point,Wed Feb 18 05:31:33 2015 UTC,"That's definitely the compelling evidence to me; mostly because if that were misdirection I think it' would too much.  She's just a little too beloved by a few too many people to play that fast and loose with her and since Dave's one of those people, I don't think he'd do that intentionally.   It's still possible that it's an unintentional error so it's wise for those of us who have strong positive feelings about her to accept Fulcrum's depiction in the show at face value   That way I think I'll at least be intrigued by whoever it ends up being more than I'm disappointed that it isn't her."
starwarsrebels,2vqnf2,leakime,2,Wed Feb 18 05:44:18 2015 UTC,"In this newest episode, Fulcrum put a lot of emphasis on Ezra staying safe.

I really like Hera, but mostly because of A New Dawn. She's kind of a badass in that.   So far Sabine is pretty decent but she's barely there. Same thing with Zeb. A wee tad of a backstory, but that's it. He's also kind of an annoying comic relief guy.   Ezra is developing nicely, so we'll see what happens with him.   Kanan though. Awesome character. I like the padawan that never finished training story, and I grew to like his cowboys aspects in A New Dawn. I just wish he did more to hide his jedi roots like he did in the beginning of the show. Just because he flashed his saber once doesn't mean he should continue."
starwarsrebels,2vpng5,FrankiePoops,9,Fri Feb 13 20:02:54 2015 UTC,"The characters are works in progress. Kanan is an interesting perspective on the Jedi as he has traits of the Old and New Jedi Orders.  He is a much more likable character when he is being a smart aleck, although his serious side is necessary as he is the most experienced member of the team, maybe. Ezra is alright.  He has the over dramatic dialogue that young kids often use, that is often annoying, but he is growing on me.  I liked him more in the pilot when he wasn't a squeaky clean Jedi-in-training, but was an actual thief.  His character now works for group interactions, but on his own he couldn't carry the show. Sabine is a super cool character, but we don't know nearly enough about her to care yet.  I like her quirks, but that is pretty much all we know about her, and her past seems to be the most interesting. Zeb hasn't been used in the last few episodes, so he hasn't progressed beyond the tough, gun guy with a sad past. Hera, to me, isn't really a character yet.  Like with Sabine, we don't know much about her.  We know  she is a competent pilot and logical problem solver, but we don't know what motivates her, so she doesn't really have much to do yet.  From my remarks, it might seem that I'm really critical about the characters, but I like all of them.  I just want to know more about them."
starwarsrebels,2vpng5,SerCalebioStark,5,Fri Feb 13 05:11:00 2015 UTC,"I really like all of them. I feel like because they're original characters, they're so much more interesting. On top of that, I really like how each of them is written; their characters all seem completely natural and the dialogue and banter between the group makes them feel a lot more real than a lot of the characters in TCW. And because of the slower pace and smaller scale of the show, they seem much more believable and we get more off time to connect with them."
starwarsrebels,2vpng5,ImNotASWFanboy,2,Fri Feb 13 20:37:56 2015 UTC,"Yep, Hera and Chopper for me too. And Zeb. I really liked Kanan in the pilot but he hasn't been very interesting since."

starwarsrebels,2vpng5,Nihillo,2,Sun Feb 15 18:26:42 2015 UTC,I will say one thing this show does brilliant is the secondary characters. Kallus and Maketh are great.   I like the Inquisitor but to me right now he is still kind of a cardboard cutout of a bad guy. They need to find a way to give him some kind of personality.
starwarsrebels,2vpng5,RogueLieutenant,2,Fri Feb 13 22:20:56 2015 UTC,"The singular gripe I have is that I feel like the characters haven't changed as much as I'd have hoped in this amount of time.  Maybe the finale changes that, hopefully, but as of now, it's like, a solid 8.    Chopper is such a dick, and that's really funny, his character hasn't changed much, and hasn't needed to. Hera I think has had the least amount of change, unfortunately, hope we get to see more of her in the future, but I do care about her bunch and think she's great. Sabine's great.  Kind of wish we'd gone a little deeper into her character. Zeb is awesome, I do think it's time for him to adopt something of a darker wardrobe though.  Not sure if that makes sense, but I feel like his character has grown more mature than he looks. Ezra has grown on me the most.  Since Path of the Jedi, he's just become way more mature and likeable. And Kanan is consistently interesting.  Feel about him how I did Obi Wan in a new hope.    So far?  Love this show.  Excited to keep watching it.  Aside from the episodes written by Kevin Hopps, the show has been stellar."

starwarsrebels,2vp0ba,EveryGoodNameIsGone,3,Fri Feb 13 00:39:27 2015 UTC,"Under the radar, particularly since it doesn't launch until April.  Here's everything Marvel is currently releasing:   Star Wars - ongoing main comic, launched in January; two issues out so far (#1 in Jan, #2 in Feb); currently set between ANH and ESB Darth Vader - ongoing, launched on Feb. 11; one issue out so far, issue #2 due Feb. 25; subsequent issues will be one-a-month starting in March; currently set between ANH and ESB, immediately after the first story arc of the main Star Wars comic (presumably Star Wars issues 1-3, possibly 1-4; we won't know for sure until the first Star Wars arc finishes) Princess Leia - launches in March; five-issue limited series; set between ANH and ESB, and presumably before the Star Wars and Darth Vader comics, but this isn't 100% clear just yet Kanan - ongoing, launches in April; first 5-issue arc will be ""The Last Padawan"" and take place during/just after ROTS; subsequent issues will continue between ROTS and A New Dawn   Obviously, the Star Wars and Darth Vader comics are in the spotlight right now, and Princess Leia will be in the spotlight next month. I'd imagine there won't be as big a push on the Kanan comic anyway, but it'll be more at the forefront just before its April launch."
starwarsrebels,2vp0ba,armakaryk,2,Fri Feb 13 17:23:42 2015 UTC,"Yep, under the radar, there just hasn't been much info.  But its not targeted at kids.

starwarsrebels,2vfk72,RVierra327,19,Tue Feb 10 16:50:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think Vader would kill Ahsoka unless absolutely necessary. Anakin's whole problem and eventual fall to the dark side was because of his attachment issues. Re-watching the Clone Wars they make it evident that, while it was not in a romantic way, that Anakin was just as attached to Ahsoka as he was to Padme and Obi-Wan. The makers of Clone Wars and Rebels have also shown they are fans of the slow burn. I don't think they would move so quickly to reveal Vader as Anakin to Ahsoka or the crew of the Ghost. After all, we still don't know much about Ezra's parents and this season is almost over.  What makes more sense to me would be for Ahsoka to run into Vader while on some mission with the crew of the Ghost. During that confrontation, for reasons that nobody but the viewer knows, Vader allows her to escape. In another meeting, Vader tries to turn Ahsoka and maybe reveals he knows something only Anakin would know. In their final confrontation Ahsoka finally realizes that Vader is Anakin. This would mirror Luke's eventual experience with Vader much in the same way they most recently mirrored Vader's arrival in RotJ in the Call to Action episode. With the exception that instead of trying to turn him like Luke eventually does, Ahsoka feels totally betrayed and tries do destroy Vader. In that fight, she ultimately loses."
starwarsrebels,2vfk72,d0r13n,26,Tue Feb 10 17:17:57 2015 UTC,Anakin is dead. There will be no Snips or Skyguys. There will be no letting her go because Vader is ruthless. Vader cannot be redeemed until RotJ. Ahsoka will never know who is behind the mask.   I think showing Vader's coldness and ruthlessness is waaaay more interesting than something sappy.
starwarsrebels,2vfk72,Lanuria,14,Tue Feb 10 17:38:34 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, I miss the Vader we all knew before the PT. However, from a storytelling aspect, if there is good in Vader as we are told by Padme and Luke, it should show somehow. Imagine Vader letting Ahsoka escape, and having Agent Kallus call him on it, and Vader killing him similar to how he kicked the stormtrooper to his death in the wookie episode. Still brutal Vader, but with the attachment that made him Vader. And imagine how much meaning it would give the Luke and Vader showdown in RotJ when we find out Ahsoka could not redeem him.   I still wish we had the Vader of old, but like the expanded universe, he's gone and we have to look at the entire character. He joined the Sith because of his attachments. To save Padme. and the Clone Wars series made it a point to show his attachment to Obi-Wan when he faked his death and several times he made un-Jedi decisions to save Ahsoka.   And it builds him up to be the Vader we remember. It severs his last attachment to be that Vader. Obi-Wan betrayed him (from his point of view), Padme is dead and when Ahsoka doesn't join him after the reveal he sees her the same as he sees Obi-Wan."
starwarsrebels,2vfk72,d0r13n,6,Tue Feb 10 21:21:28 2015 UTC,"I'd be on board with this, though I doubt we'd see Vader kill Ahsoka (at least on screen). I don't recall seeing any deliberate deaths on screen so far in Rebels. Stormtroopers getting hit with the occasional blaster doesn't count. We don't see Kannan or Ezra cutting/stabbing Stormtroopers with their lightsabers. Even in the first season of TCW people were being murdered on screen (the royal guard traitor guy who gets stabbed in the back by Ventress comes to mind)."
starwarsrebels,2vfk72,boomkinburger,2,Wed Feb 11 17:51:16 2015 UTC,"Nothing on screen, but there is plenty of implied. When they went to rescue the Jedi Master, Zeb throws a trooper off a very high ledge. Agent Callus has kicked a trooper down to his death and then there was the most recent episode..."
starwarsrebels,2vfk72,d0r13n,2,Wed Feb 11 18:02:30 2015 UTC,"I haven't watched the new one yet. My On Demand doesn't have it listed :( the deaths you've mentioned I do remember, but when comparing it to the tone of TCW, there might as well not be any deaths at all. Based on Rebels alone, the Empire does not come across as evil. They're just a bunch of jerks. I realize it's a kid's show, but still."
starwarsrebels,2vfk72,boomkinburger,7,Thu Feb 12 12:51:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah... Let's talk after you see the latest episode... It addresses a lot of your concerns. I think it's their ""grow the beard"" moment."
starwarsrebels,2vfk72,d0r13n,12,Thu Feb 12 14:13:50 2015 UTC,"I believe he would sense her presence and vice versa, just as he sensed Obi-Wan on the Death Star in ANH."
starwarsrebels,2vfk72,senorbeber,11,Tue Feb 10 21:34:08 2015 UTC,"I would love for the writers of the show to give us an outcome rather than Ahsoka's death, hence why I only listed it as the ""most likely"" option as opposed to the option I would prefer. However, her living into the OT will bring up many questions for people (not that this has stopped Star Wars writers before...)  The one reason that I believe Ahsoka would recognize Vader right after meeting him is that you would think she would recognize the force ""signature"" of her master. Of course, this concern could easily be brushed away by numerous explanations (Vader's cybernetics, Dark side,...).   Maybe comparing his relationship to Obi Wan isn't the best reasoning for why he wouldn't kill her. We all know how that ended up.   Thanks for the feedback though!"
starwarsrebels,2vfk72,d0r13n,5,Tue Feb 10 17:23:12 2015 UTC,"I only mean his attachment to Obi-Wan before Vader found out Obi-Wan betrayed him (from his point of view). I totally agree, I would love for Ahsoka to survive. But like you said, it makes it difficult to explain what she was doing during the OT."
starwarsrebels,2vfk72,kipperson,5,Tue Feb 10 17:32:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  Vader hated Obi Wan.  I think he would still feel like he owed Ahsoka for what happened to her and perhaps the feeling that he failed her.  Unlike Obi-Wan, Ahsoka left the Jedi order.  He might try to recruit her as an Inquisitor or as an apprentice to dethrone Palpatine.    In conclusion:  PLEASE DAVE, DON'T KILL AHSOKA!"

starwarsrebels,2vfk72,niftyjimmymack,7,Tue Feb 10 19:09:59 2015 UTC,"I agree that he COULD still be compassionate but I doubt it. I would've been more likely to believe he would've let his emotions overwhelm him in the early years of being Lord Vader but 5 years pre-ANH, where he chokes subordinates and is involved in mass genocide, I can't imagine he would let such things as sentimentality overtake his duty to the Emperor.  Also, the previews of Darth Vader #1 that have thus far come out have far from portrayed Vader as compassionate.   Although it's no longer canon, James Luceno's Dark Lord novel perfectly encapsulates how Anakin and Vader are essentially two entirely different people."
starwarsrebels,2vfk72,niftyjimmymack,1 point,Tue Feb 10 19:14:08 2015 UTC,In my opinion if vader and ashoka do come into contact with each other wouldn't they sense one another before actually meeting.  I mean vader wouldn't have to tell ashoka that he is anikain because she would sense it with the force??

From there Ahsoka battles Barriss, and either Ahsoka kills Barriss or Vader force chokes Barriss to death, when Ahsoka talks her into going away from the dark side.   Then Vader and Ahsoka battle while Ahsoka is cursing at Vader and calling him a hypocrite. Ultimately Vader kills her from a lightsaber stab into the back, at the end he says, ""...sorry, Snips.""  At least that is one of my ideas."
starwarsrebels,2vjwhb,b_dills,5,Wed Feb 11 17:07:09 2015 UTC,"In the last episode Tarkin makes a speech about how they don't want information getting out about a surviving Jedi. It would breed hope, etc. However in the holonet broadcast at the beginning of the episode they show an image of Kanan wielding his lightsaber! The propaganda interview is being broadcast to the entire galaxy and here is a picture of of the very Jedi they are trying to conceal.   I suspect the holonet broadcaster responsible was shot shortly afterward. People screw up sometimes, it happens.   Tarkin makes the statement that this particular Rebel crew is non violent (unlike others). Really?? They kill Imperials all the time. Explosives, shooting down fighters, sacrificing soldiers to the shadow monsters, and more. In this episode alone Sabine throws an explosive onto a Stormtrooper transport effectively murdering three people!    No, he says that they are more principled than others, and that they are not interested in violence. Which they aren't - we don't see them conduct a whole lot of bombings, for example. They're willing to use violence in pursuit of their objectives, but the objectives themselves are rarely ""leave the floor covered in as many white-armored bodies as possible,"" and they apparently make some attempt to minimize casualties."
starwarsrebels,2vjwhb,Galle_,1 point,Wed Feb 11 17:13:09 2015 UTC,"I posted about the Lightsaber in Holonet thing a few days ago, and I think the consensus was 1. Jedi are evil to many people still, they are the ones who tried to overthrow the Republic and 2. This is no Jedi, he's an imposter!  In re to the non-violent rebels, I think they are non-violent in that they avoid CIVILIAN casualties and also they tend to stun or disable the stormies, only a fraction are truly dead. Additionally, we don't know what other rebels are doing, perhaps the few dozens of dead attributable to the crew of the Ghost just pales in comparison to what others have done."
starwarsrebels,2vjwhb,iowajaycee,1 point,Wed Feb 11 18:43:35 2015 UTC,"In Tarkin's speech he condescends the Jedi as ""legends."" So I think the common person would still be surprised to see one in action. However it is not the common people that they don't want seeing this, it is the Rebels. The Rebels will see a Jedi as a sign of hope. Tarkin basically says so himself.  To me this is either lazy writing or lazy animation."

That leaves the real season of the show with 13 episodes, of which we've seen 11. If this is to be believed, then we have the season finale two-parter up next."

(http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Rebels:_Season_One)  I highly doubt that they would count the preview shorts as one of the 16 episodes.

starwarsrebels,2vfcq4,RVierra327,1 point,Wed Feb 11 02:19:38 2015 UTC,"Star Wars Rebels: Season One:       The first season of the animated television series Star Wars Rebels premiered on October 3, 2014 on the Disney Channel, beginning with the one-hour television movie Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion. The full series began on Disney XD with the premiere of the episode ""Droids in Distress"" on October 13. The season is executive produced by Dave Filoni, Simon Kinberg, and Greg Weisman. The first season, set five years before Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, follows the crew of the starship Ghost in the early days of the fight against the Galactic Empire. The crew attracts the attention of Agent Kallus of the Imperial Security Bureau, who wants to eliminate them as a threat before they can spark a wider rebellion; and the Inquisitor, a dark sider who is tasked with killing any Jedi who survived Order 66—including Kanan Jarrus and his new apprentice, Ezra Bridger. The crew of the Ghost will eventually help form the Rebel Alliance.

starwarsrebels,2vfcq4,autowikiabot,1 point,Wed Feb 11 02:20:02 2015 UTC,"They got a 16 episode production order.  The shorts count as the first produced episode, and Spark counts as the second and third produced episodes.  That leaves 13 episodes starting with Droids in Distress.  Doesn't matter if it makes logical sense or not, but in order to get the budget to do the shorts, they had to give them a production code, thus they took one of the sixteen slots. Whether they fill a 22-minute slot or not is irrelevant.  The official production codes bear this out - which, incidentally, can be found in the exact Wookieepedia page you linked to:   101 (A-D) - Shorts 102 - Spark of Rebellion 1 103 - Spark of Rebellion 2 104 - Droids in Distress 105 - Fighter Flight 106 - Rise of the Old Masters 107 - Breaking Ranks 108 - Out of Darkness 109 - Empire Day 110 - Gathering Forces 111 - Path of the Jedi 112 - Idiot's Array 113 - Vision of Hope 114 - Call to Action 115 - Rebel Resolve 116 - [can't find a title anywhere for this one]   So there you have it. The two-part finale is all that's left of the first season, which either consists of 16 produced episodes (the way Disney/Lucasfilm is counting from an accounting standpoint), 14 full episodes of which one is double-length, or 13 full episodes that follow on from a 45-minute ""movie."""

I'm assuming he was one of the original 501st troopers, which means he's been there since the entire mess started and has been with Anakin/Vader pretty much his whole life. Seeing how Anakin treated the Clones in TCW and then seeing how Vader abused his remaining Clone in Tarkin really showed off how different he is."
starwarsrebels,2v9nov,boomkinburger,1 point,Wed Feb 11 17:59:27 2015 UTC,I didn't read the book what was the dynamic like? Context clues says Vader gave him shit but how?
starwarsrebels,2v9nov,Pickles256,2,Wed Mar 4 00:57:12 2015 UTC,"I think mostly it was verbal abuse. I think he threatened to kill him for his incompetence. Not sure if he ever physically did anything to him. In the end though, he ended up proving his worth (at least a little bit) and got a promotion from Vader. So I think it further emphasizes how emotionally unstable Anakin/Vader is. He went from wanting to kill one of his most loyal soldiers for being old to promoting him for doing one thing right."
starwarsrebels,2v9nov,boomkinburger,2,Wed Mar 4 16:26:05 2015 UTC,Non canonly? They age acceleratedly. Canonly we don't know.
starwarsrebels,2v9nov,PKGMan,8,Mon Feb 9 22:47:03 2015 UTC,Actually we sort of do. they reference their rapid ageing and subsequent phase out in the New Canon book Tarkin by James Luceno
starwarsrebels,2v9nov,RealVoltar,3,Mon Feb 9 22:55:33 2015 UTC,"Shit, I have yet to read Tarkin. This makes me want to read it even more."
starwarsrebels,2v9nov,RealVoltar,7,Mon Feb 9 22:57:09 2015 UTC,"Whether you're into the character Tarkin or not, it's definitely a good book to read.  If you're a Vader or Palpatine fan,  it's absolutely essential."
starwarsrebels,2v9nov,PKGMan,4,Tue Feb 10 04:35:46 2015 UTC,Tarkin is one of those villains that is so good that you can't hate them. Though the new Rebels episode...I won't spoil what happens

starwarsrebels,2v9nov,Tuskin38,4,Mon Feb 9 23:01:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm totally comfortable with him holding the lore bat and swinging it at whim.  He's got a good sense of SW."
starwarsrebels,2v9nov,TakeMyUsernameAgain,2,Tue Feb 10 04:37:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, I'll pick it up next time I go to the comic book store then! As much as I hate all old EU becoming non-canon I do love getting new star wars stories."
starwarsrebels,2v9nov,MordorsFinest,3,Mon Feb 9 23:28:31 2015 UTC,I know it's rough but I can understand why they did it. There was no way they could write a movie without contradicting something from the EU. This way they can just pull back the stuff that works from legends.
starwarsrebels,2v9nov,Waddles77,6,Tue Feb 10 02:08:52 2015 UTC,They do according to the novel Tarkin. So it is canon now.
starwarsrebels,2v9nov,IHateHumans,4,Mon Feb 9 22:54:51 2015 UTC,"Even without Tarkin, age acceleration is directly mentioned in Attack of the Clones."
starwarsrebels,2v9nov,DarkhorseV,0,Tue Feb 10 00:01:16 2015 UTC,They just made it sound as if they can control it and it could be implied as if they don't age twice as fast.
starwarsrebels,2v9nov,IHateHumans,0,Tue Feb 10 02:15:12 2015 UTC,"They cant age out that fast, i'm sure they can work him In"

starwarsrebels,2v9nov,Lanuria,9,Mon Feb 9 05:50:48 2015 UTC,"We know Filoni has deliberately been misleading us. Maybe he asked her to do that. Chances are shell make an appearance anyway, just not as Fulcrum."

starwarsrebels,2v9nov,RealVoltar,2,Mon Feb 9 16:57:21 2015 UTC,Nothing online is ever confirmed until the show actually airs. I'm holding out for Ahsoka to be some Jediish lady in the outer rim taking out Inquisitors. That's a job she's better at than getting supplies.   I want some new characters or ones that deserve a story in the new EU. I want some Mon Mothma and Garm and Wedge!

That's a job she's better at than getting supplies.   Agreed. She'd be better use in combat than at running some sort of spy network which infiltrates the Empire.   I want some new characters or ones that deserve a story in the new EU. I want some Mon Mothma and Garm and Wedge!   Me too!
starwarsrebels,2v9nov,cunningmunki,2,Mon Feb 9 22:52:16 2015 UTC,"I still want Teen Rogue Squad. Wedge, Wes, Tycho and Hobbie can all be best friends as teenagers! And having all sorts of crazy adventures."
starwarsrebels,2v9nov,kablob17,2,Mon Feb 9 22:59:10 2015 UTC,And like...Isard an Zsinj go to the high school across town?
starwarsrebels,2v9nov,RufusROFLpunch,2,Tue Feb 10 04:42:51 2015 UTC,"Just because she came of age during a war, it doesn't make her a shit-kicker by nature.  She's one of the few jedi that seem to have visions and though I don't think there's a canon take on saber-color, the green-crystal jedi seem to be more contemplative and less aggressive in general (in keeping with the EU consular idea)."
starwarsrebels,2v9nov,cunningmunki,4,Tue Feb 10 05:01:30 2015 UTC,"""We know Filoni has deliberately been misleading us""...because Filoni told us that."
starwarsrebels,2v9nov,RealVoltar,1 point,Tue Feb 10 19:08:48 2015 UTC,Correct. Your point is what?
starwarsrebels,2v9nov,cunningmunki,3,Tue Feb 10 19:47:21 2015 UTC,That Filoni telling us that could be a case of Filoni misleading us.

starwarsrebels,2v9nov,mojave955,1 point,Wed Feb 11 01:59:58 2015 UTC,That's a logical paradox I don't even want to think about.
starwarsrebels,2v9nov,r__ick,3,Wed Feb 11 05:17:42 2015 UTC,If this was intentional misdirection then I think it went too far.  This is beyond playful mystery and would just be setting people up for disappointment.
starwarsrebels,2v9nov,iowajaycee,1 point,Tue Feb 10 04:30:11 2015 UTC,"True, it is a bit too elaborate, but then again, its such an oddly specific thing to have on a CV.

starwarsrebels,2v9nov,Waddles77,1 point,Tue Feb 10 06:15:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was thinking Teller from Tarkin might make more sense and be a linking thread throughout the formation of the Aliiance (as well as the famous few senators and the Onderon group)."

starwarsrebels,2v9nov,matty25,3,Wed Feb 11 03:17:47 2015 UTC,OMG but what if it's Ventress?
starwarsrebels,2v9nov,matty25,2,Wed Feb 11 20:37:23 2015 UTC,"Not that surprising, but still good to know. Hopefully she has Rex with her, and seeing Ventress again would be neat."
starwarsrebels,2v5yhn,mojave955,7,Sun Feb 8 04:55:33 2015 UTC,"He makes several appearance in the series.   The Clone Wars Season 5 Episode Featurette ""Military Might"" - featuring Tarkin"
starwarsrebels,2v5yhn,DanielYMoi,3,Sun Feb 8 04:56:21 2015 UTC,Are Ahsoka and Kanan about the same age?
starwarsrebels,2v5yhn,nightmare901,12,Sun Feb 8 06:07:19 2015 UTC,"I think Ahsoka is a LITTLE older than Kanan, but not by much."
starwarsrebels,2v5yhn,SunsFenix,6,Sun Feb 8 08:32:05 2015 UTC,Yeah for sure Kanan was about padawan age. I would guess he would be 12-14 during order 66.
starwarsrebels,2v5yhn,tonicodrea,1 point,Sun Feb 8 09:53:57 2015 UTC,How old is Kanaan?
starwarsrebels,2v5yhn,AmunRa666,2,Sun Feb 8 16:55:35 2015 UTC,11 according to a new dawn
starwarsrebels,2v5yhn,blink5694,2,Sun Feb 8 17:38:48 2015 UTC,So he's probably about 26/27 at the time of Rebels.  He was 11 during Order 66 and IIRC Rebels is about 15 years later.
starwarsrebels,2v5yhn,DarthSatoris,3,Sun Feb 8 20:35:27 2015 UTC,"IIRC Rebels is about 15 years later.    Ezra was born on the day the Empire was created, and they say it's the 15th anniversary in ""Empire Day"", making Ezra 15, and Kanaan possibly 25-27.  However, since Luke and Leia Skywalker were born slightly after the empire's creation, that means Ezra, Luke and Leia are the exact same age. This also means that all events of SWR happen four years before the destruction of the Death Star, giving them plenty of possible runtime to flesh out the story in SWR some more (read: create tons of toyetic merchandise)."
starwarsrebels,2v5yhn,DangerousDac,1 point,Sun Feb 8 23:26:07 2015 UTC,"Having read A New Dawn, I could've sworn he was 14 at the time of the fall."

starwarsrebels,2v41fw,Mojo1200,8,Sun Feb 8 02:26:23 2015 UTC,"Im excited to see her pop up and hope she plays a big part.  As fun as the pop-up appearances have been, I would love for Ahsoka to have a solid arch that at least lasts for a few episodes.  Her inevitable reunion with Vader is going to surely be heartbreaking no matter what the result is."
starwarsrebels,2v41fw,blink5694,1 point,Sun Feb 8 20:44:14 2015 UTC,"Seems likely enough. After all, Tarkin seems poised to helm the Imperials through at least this Season's finale. That's one arc-long cameo already."
starwarsrebels,2v41fw,Lemonite,4,Mon Feb 9 22:10:28 2015 UTC,Called it before It was cool.  I hope she makes a mess of the Inquisitor.
starwarsrebels,2v41fw,kipperson,9,Sun Feb 8 04:47:46 2015 UTC,She could take him for sure. Then Vader will have to get involved. RIP Snips
starwarsrebels,2v41fw,RogueLieutenant,3,Sun Feb 8 20:05:46 2015 UTC,It doesn't have to happen in the same episode.  Have her totally school the Inquisitor and a season later Vader catches up with her.  Everyone seems to dead set on Vader killing her after trying to recruit her but I don't see why that has to happen.
starwarsrebels,2v41fw,kipperson,4,Sun Feb 8 20:41:32 2015 UTC,I think it's more likely that she'll find out he's Anakin and try to turn him.  Dave eats that forshadowing shit up.
starwarsrebels,2v41fw,RealVoltar,6,Mon Feb 9 02:47:30 2015 UTC,"She was a fully trained Jedi Knight (she passed her trials, but she left the order). She actually fought in the Clone Wars, stood up to Ventress and was trained by Anakin. Inquisitor would get his ass so handed to him by her or any actual Jedi Knight."
starwarsrebels,2v41fw,comet997,2,Sun Feb 8 22:42:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I see the Inquisitor as the dark-side equivalent of a Jedi Knight. He'd probably hit a stalemate with a true Jedi and a fight with Ahsoka could definitely go either way - she was still a Padawan after all, albeit a strong one."
starwarsrebels,2v41fw,UnlimitedFlour,3,Mon Feb 9 01:26:24 2015 UTC,"By the end, she wasn't a Padawan, she was granted the title of Jedi Knight, which she refused.  Something about him doesn't inspire confidence that he can take out Clone Wars veterans. Considering his constant failure to bring down one Rebel cell and allowing Kanan to get away so often."
starwarsrebels,2v41fw,comet997,4,Mon Feb 9 06:51:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Ahsoka would completely dominate the inquisitor, I have no doubt about that."
starwarsrebels,2v41fw,Jumbify,2,Mon Feb 9 14:56:16 2015 UTC,"I'm on team Tano too but she wasn't knighted or even offered knighthood.  Windu made vague comments about the frame-up being her ""great trial"" but they never made any references to her taking any other trials. He was probably throwing around the word trial to entice her to rejoin the order with the idea of a knighthood in the near future.  She was still too young to be knighted.  She was what, 16?  Anakin was 18 when he was knighted and it was one of the quickest promotions ever.  All that said though... Ahsoka escaped from Grevious once, fought to a draw the second time, dueled Asajj and learned under Anakin.  The Inquisitor has proven just barely competent against a padawan so I'm confident Ahsoka would make a fool of him.  I like the idea of her cutting him down with minimal effort and his station being replaced by a higher caliber Inquisitor."
starwarsrebels,2v41fw,kipperson,5,Mon Feb 9 23:28:58 2015 UTC,"I'm a lot more convinced that Fulcrum is Ahsoka now.  Even though Dave straightup said that they've been not only adding clues to mysteries in the show but intentionally misleading information as well, this seems more like manufacturing disappointment than playful misdirection (to misdirect Fulcrum's identity as Ahsoka).  I've actually become more interested in both the possibility of great disaster for Lothal  (base delta zero) and the general Deathstar stuff (Zare being moved to Geonosis, the five-year outer rim plan and so on).  Sorry for the awkward paragraph...tried to fix it up."
starwarsrebels,2v41fw,RealVoltar,5,Mon Feb 9 02:45:28 2015 UTC,She'd need contacts.  I bet Hondo is one of them.
starwarsrebels,2v41fw,shadowasdf,10,Mon Feb 9 21:18:26 2015 UTC,"It was pretty much evident, when people changed the pitch on Fulcrum's voice, and it sounded just like Ahsoka, with her speech pattern.   Now, what I want to know is, which season is Berch Teller going to show up?"
starwarsrebels,2v41fw,Sapitoelgato,2,Sat Feb 7 18:42:01 2015 UTC,I'd think this would be slightly more reliable than simply pitching up the voice from an episode.
starwarsrebels,2v41fw,DarthSatoris,1 point,Sat Feb 7 19:10:18 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure most people in here agreed that Fulcrum was Ahsoka in disguise.  Considering the people who make this show made Clone Wars it was bound to be a central part of the story. We never got an end to Ahsoka's story, and it will most likely (now confirmed) be continued in Rebels."
starwarsrebels,2v41fw,RealVoltar,1 point,Sun Feb 8 23:30:49 2015 UTC,I was kind of thinking that he was going to turn out to be Fulcrum actually with all the cross-media synergy talk going on.
starwarsrebels,2v41fw,Sapitoelgato,1 point,Mon Feb 9 02:48:32 2015 UTC,I can see Teller somewhere higher up than Fulcrum.
starwarsrebels,2v41fw,matty25,-1,Mon Feb 9 03:08:06 2015 UTC,"...Mon Mothma and her merry band of Bothan spies.  I just don't see it being Ahsoka.  We don't know much about Fulcrum but whoever it is seems to be in charge of a Corellian Corvette (perhaps their own?) and capable of acquiring secret information and brokering that information.  Ahsoka is more of a warrior Jedi who disappeared after leaving the order. She doesn't seem like someone with a network capable of pulling off what Fulcrum does. Ahsoka likely doesn't have many ties to the Empire anymore; it'd be very difficult to with Order 66 and all, so how would she get the information? And how would Ahsoka be in possession of a Corvette? Perhaps she's just hitching a ride but it just doesn't seem like something a Jedi-in-hiding would be capable of pulling off.  I have little doubt that we will see Ahsoka (her dueling Vader is just TOO compelling not to show) but not in this capacity.  Mon Mothma seems like a more logical fit to me. She's a Senator with ties to the Empire, thus she has access to useful information. And being a Senator, she could easily have the funds and resources to run a spy network. We know she runs one in the OT after all.  So she's my guess and I think she'd be a great choice. She's in on the ground floor of the Rebellion and ends up a major player as we see in the OT. Also, it's a chance to tell the story of the Bothan spies who apparently made great sacrifices to help the Rebellion."
starwarsrebels,2v41fw,boomkinburger,2,Mon Feb 9 02:02:59 2015 UTC,I don't know why you're getting down voted. I agree with you. Having someone like Mon Mothma would make more sense. Unless of course Mon Mothma and Ahsoka are working together.
starwarsrebels,2v41fw,matty25,2,Thu Feb 12 14:28:37 2015 UTC,"Ahsoka is more of a warrior Jedi who disappeared after leaving the order.

Perhaps she's just hitching a ride but it just doesn't seem like something a Jedi-in-hiding would be capable of pulling off.   Keep in mind that Star Wars Rebels takes place 14-15 years after Ahsoka left. That's plenty of time for her to find contacts throughout the former Republic and to acquire a corvette, since they've been in production and use since at least the Clone Wars. She's not a Jedi anymore, she left the order.   I have little doubt that we will see Ahsoka (her dueling Vader is just TOO compelling not to show) but not in this capacity.   I disagree. I think it's quite likely we'll see her. All of the evidence points to it.   Mon Mothma seems like a more logical fit to me.

So she's my guess and I think she'd be a great choice. She's in on the ground floor of the Rebellion and ends up a major player as we see in the OT.   I'd agree with your guess if they'd at least mentioned her in passing or something in an episode. Plus, she's a major player in the OT. She didn't even appear(chronologically) until RotJ.   Also, it's a chance to tell the story of the Bothan spies who apparently made great sacrifices to help the Rebellion.   Hate to throw an axe in this theory, but the Bothan spies helped with the second Death Star plans, not the first."
starwarsrebels,2v41fw,TripleChimp,2,Mon Feb 9 05:46:40 2015 UTC,Hate to throw an axe in this theory   Haha are you sure you hated throwing that axe? :)  You seem very certain and Ahsoka could definitely be it; I'm not denying that. I'm just not totally sold yet and I think Mon Motha is a more logical choice given all we know about the characters  Cheers.
starwarsrebels,2v41fw,Jumbify,-8,Mon Feb 9 22:59:08 2015 UTC,It's gonna be Leia.

starwarsrebels,2v23li,CelestialFury,50,Sat Feb 7 03:32:10 2015 UTC,They had me fooled at the beginning. I totally thought that Vader was going to step off that shuttle.  It was a spectacular episode! I love hating Tarkin.
starwarsrebels,2v23li,TrueMarksmens,14,Sat Feb 7 03:33:53 2015 UTC,"When I was watching that scene I was wondering the same thing too.  ""Is he really going to off here?  I can't wait to see how he reacts to everyone.""    It looks like Tarkin getting his rank has taken a toll on his hair.  Side note: Does Tarkin outrank Vader or are they considered equal?  Obviously Vader is a Sith and that's very special, but Tarkin is an amazing commander and Palpatine really trusts him too."
starwarsrebels,2v23li,RogueLieutenant,18,Sun Feb 8 19:24:00 2015 UTC,They're pretty much on an even level I'd say. They also respect each other.   Read Tarkin (Canon) by James Luceno if you're curious about their relationship.
starwarsrebels,2v23li,RogueLieutenant,3,Sun Feb 8 20:02:02 2015 UTC,"Have you read the book by chance?  If so, is it good?"
starwarsrebels,2v23li,Chewblacka,13,Sun Feb 8 20:12:07 2015 UTC,I've read it. I though it was just ok. I really liked learning about how Tarkin and Vader get along with each other so to speak and the current state of the Empire.   The book takes place roughly 5 years after ROTS.   The overall plot I found sort of meh but all the other elements were interesting.
starwarsrebels,2v23li,Lemonite,3,Sun Feb 8 20:59:02 2015 UTC,It does seem odd that Vader would not handle a Jedi insurgency personally. What else could he be doing that is more important?  I agree though I was hope hope hoping Vader would walk down the ramp.
starwarsrebels,2v23li,bluegrassgazer,19,Mon Feb 9 00:02:26 2015 UTC,"The Lothal rebels haven't quite established themselves as a serious threat to the Empire (yet), but taking out that kyber crystal shipment was a direct attack on Tarkin's personal interests (the Death Star construction). If it weren't for that fact, I doubt anyone of importance would have made the trip at all."
starwarsrebels,2v23li,Sapitoelgato,3,Mon Feb 9 22:19:30 2015 UTC,Excellent point.
starwarsrebels,2v23li,bawork22,24,Tue Feb 10 03:21:40 2015 UTC,A great start to the true colors of the show.
starwarsrebels,2v23li,arzthaus,17,Sat Feb 7 04:37:53 2015 UTC,As far as the stories of these characters go I believe this was the most important episode so far. Really sets an epic tone for the future of the series. Tarkin is ruthless. I doubt Kanan is getting killed off just yet. Plus FPJ has said they've recorded double the amount of episodes for season 2. Apparently the sector Zare Leonis has been assigned to is the sector where the Death Star is being built. Seriously you guys should all start reading the new books. This aligned canon is amazing. All I can say is I'm going to be really sad if I can't make it out to Celebration Anaheim to see the season 2 premiere.
starwarsrebels,2v23li,EveryGoodNameIsGone,3,Sat Feb 7 12:04:05 2015 UTC,What are the new books? Are they canon?
starwarsrebels,2v23li,RogueLieutenant,19,Sat Feb 7 15:38:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, they're canon. Everything that comes out from now on is canon, except for SW:TOR expansions.  So far there's A New Dawn, which is a Rebels prequel about Kanan and Hera, set about 6 years before the show; and Tarkin, which is all about, well, Tarkin, set 5 years after ROTS, and it is fantastic.  Upcoming novels include Heir to the Jedi, about Luke set between ANH and ESB that's told in first person from his perspective; Lords of the Sith, about Vader and Palpatine between ROTS and ANH; and Dark Disciple, about Asajj Ventress and Quinlan Vos after The Clone Wars but before ROTS - note that Dark Disciple is based on TCW season 7 scripts that were never made, so I don't recommend reading it until you've seen all 6 seasons of the show and have read the Darth Maul: Son of Dathomir comic."
starwarsrebels,2v23li,EveryGoodNameIsGone,4,Sat Feb 7 15:45:26 2015 UTC,Content being released by Fantasy Flight Games is Legends as well.

starwarsrebels,2v23li,EveryGoodNameIsGone,5,Sun Feb 8 20:08:40 2015 UTC,"Huge tabletop game company that has the Star Wars liscense. They're coming out with lots of new content including role playing games, minatures games, and other stuff.   The RPG's in particular have lots and lots of content. One of the new miniatures game has a number of new characters and stories.   All Legends."
starwarsrebels,2v23li,RogueLieutenant,3,Sun Feb 8 20:57:49 2015 UTC,"Huh, weird. Though I think I'd find it odd if tabletop RPG stuff was considered canon anyway..."
starwarsrebels,2v23li,EveryGoodNameIsGone,5,Sun Feb 8 20:59:46 2015 UTC,"Tabletop RPGs pretty much spawned the EU. All of the source books were used by authors and stuff back in the day.   In the 80s and early 90s when there wasn't much star wars happening tabletop RPGs were really all that was being produced for SW.  Lots of planets, technologies, species, and other stuff were introduced in RPG sourcebooks."
starwarsrebels,2v23li,RogueLieutenant,1 point,Sun Feb 8 21:32:17 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Guess it just seems odd to me since I've never played a tabletop RPG of any kind in my life. Seems an odd place to introduce new things to a fictional universe that's primarily explored in movies, books, and comics."
starwarsrebels,2v23li,RealVoltar,1 point,Sun Feb 8 21:34:32 2015 UTC,"It's not that the adventures the players have are canon or anything, but those games would have books and books and books detailing all sorts of stuff.

starwarsrebels,2v23li,d0r13n,36,Sat Feb 7 15:46:08 2015 UTC,How long do you think the Empire will have Kanan for?  It should be hard to break him out so I wonder how this will all play out.  I can see why Tarkin made the rank of Grand Moff and why Vader respects him.  He doesn't play around.    Did anyone expect that these two idiots were going to get their heads cut off?  I can honestly say I was a bit surprised by that.
starwarsrebels,2v23li,iamabootdisk,28,Sat Feb 7 03:36:58 2015 UTC,They've been with us since the beginning of the show. I didn't expect them to go out like that lol

starwarsrebels,2v23li,-Misla-,37,Sat Feb 7 04:32:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, right? Some ""Mickey-Mouse"" inspired execution scene that was.

I sort of try to forget that episode happened...There ""JUST"" happens to be a temple on Lothal, and yeah, I generally dislike the ""younglings in training""-episodes of TCW, and this one wasn't any better. Not to mention it's almost an exact copy of a Jedi Quest novel, even though I doubt they have read it."
starwarsrebels,2v23li,RogueLieutenant,-17,Mon Feb 16 19:54:07 2015 UTC,call that an execution scene? it was a little better but still lame in comparrison to TCW

starwarsrebels,2v23li,groverXIII,10,Sun Feb 8 13:59:20 2015 UTC,"I was a bit surprised at that level of brutality in what is ostensibly a kid's show. I wasn't surprised that they kept it off-camera, though. Still, to take on that sort of adult content is a bold move."
starwarsrebels,2v23li,Gremzero,8,Tue Feb 10 18:54:57 2015 UTC,Clearly you've never watched the Legend of Korra.
starwarsrebels,2v23li,groverXIII,3,Wed Feb 11 01:07:07 2015 UTC,That would be correct.
starwarsrebels,2v23li,Gremzero,7,Wed Feb 11 03:04:23 2015 UTC,"Well I'd definitely recommend it! It's a sequel series to the original show, Avatar: The Last Airbender which also dealt with mature themes like genocide and war, but Legend of Korra goes above and beyond what could be shown on children's shows. Without going too much into detail, the show is about a young, brash teenage girl who as the Avatar, a powerful, god-like being who's duty is to bring peace and balance to the world, has to figure out where her role fits in a world that is undergoing rapid technological and cultural change that is nearly unprecedented from her previous incarnation's time. The show deals with issues such as inequality, freedom vs. security, family abuse, political extremism, suicide, PTSD, and a whole plethora of issues that aren't normally addressed in typical children's media.   I could go on and on about why this series is so great, but unfortunately I don't have the time, so I'll just leave you with this video to exemplify it for me."
starwarsrebels,2v23li,mvcucumber,4,Wed Feb 11 03:51:29 2015 UTC,"I'll have to keep it in mind. As it stands, I have enough trouble finding time to watch the shows I'm currently trying to keep up with."
starwarsrebels,2v23li,I_need_that_bacon,5,Wed Feb 11 04:19:54 2015 UTC,"I would definitely try and find the time for it, especially with The last airbender. They're both arguably two of the best animated series to be produced in the past decade."

starwarsrebels,2v23li,Lemonite,-5,Mon Feb 9 01:57:56 2015 UTC,Kek
starwarsrebels,2v23li,DKLancer,14,Sat Feb 7 07:42:05 2015 UTC,This was my favorite episode so far. The show's creators are making it clear that they're not afraid to get dark. It took The Clone Wars 2 or 3 seasons to really grow up. I don't think Rebels is going to wait that long.
starwarsrebels,2v23li,whatIsaRedditt,10,Sat Feb 7 15:18:48 2015 UTC,"Just got caught up, Better Call Saul had my attention for the last two days.  Holy crap that intro was amazing.  I definitely thought they would put their own spin on the Imperial March but I guess they knew it couldn't be changed."
starwarsrebels,2v23li,quodpossumus,9,Tue Feb 10 15:09:54 2015 UTC,"So there are a handful of scenes in this episode that really seem to flesh out the Imperial characters a little more, but one in particular sticks out to me, Upon deducing the Lothal rebels' plan to hack the communications tower, Agent Callus suggests stepping up the facility's defenses, but is shot down by Tarkin who favors a more devious ambush approach. Callus seems... hesitant in response to this, and it's not the first time this episode that he appeared skeptical of the Grand Moff's tactics.  So I was thinking. Could we perhaps be seeing the first glimmers of dissent from our Imperial agent? I think we all agree that this is only the beginning of Tarkin's harsh regime on Lothal, and having Callus go through an ""eye-opening"" change of heart would be a pretty spectacular example of this new human side of the Empire that seems to be planned for the new film trilogy."
starwarsrebels,2v23li,Chewblacka,12,Tue Feb 10 18:44:16 2015 UTC,"I figured that it was just Callus thinking ""Dude, we've already tried the whole setting them up for a trap thing and it NEVER WORKS!"""
starwarsrebels,2v23li,AusSco,4,Tue Feb 10 19:22:13 2015 UTC,"That's a really interesting theory! I would love to see Callus leave the Empire, or betray them in some way like that. I think it would add a lot to the show, especially since they've made it clear that he isn't a ""nice"" guy who just wants to be loyal to the Empire, he's a brutal dude who murders his soldiers. So if he did leave because of Tarkin, it would add some serious dimensions to his character."
starwarsrebels,2v23li,Lemonite,7,Tue Feb 10 20:58:21 2015 UTC,"He comes across to me as the kind of guy that fights for the wining side, be they good or evil. If/When the tables get turned on the Empire and things start looking bad for him, he'll jump ship."
starwarsrebels,2v23li,Chewblacka,2,Wed Feb 11 05:46:14 2015 UTC,I think the most logical reason for Callus to defect is that he just learned that if he does not succeed that Tarkin will have him assassinated in cold blood. That has to plant a pretty serious seed that you are a hair away from getting gone at any time.
starwarsrebels,2v23li,tonicodrea,3,Sat Feb 14 16:06:26 2015 UTC,Turning off Callus....the same guy who almost wiped out all of the race of Lasat (sp?)
starwarsrebels,2v23li,sniperdude12a,5,Thu Feb 12 12:32:07 2015 UTC,I had honestly forgotten that entirely. Fair point.

starwarsrebels,2v23li,BudgieAttackSquadron,4,Sun Feb 8 14:33:11 2015 UTC,Great episode. Was awesome to see Tarkin and I also really enjoyed the scenes between Kanan and The Inquisitor.
starwarsrebels,2v23li,-Misla-,2,Tue Feb 10 04:36:02 2015 UTC,Does it bother anyone else that the stormtroopers make droid servo noises when they take aim?  It's like they took the noises from when droids aim in the prequels and clone wars and mistook it for blaster cocking noises (since when do blasters need to be cocked?)
starwarsrebels,2v23li,BudgieAttackSquadron,5,Tue Feb 10 05:29:37 2015 UTC,"I'm by no means an expert, but I'm pretty sure that the Clone Trooper blasters in RotS had sights that whirred into place with that same sound, and I think they're doing the same thing with the Stormtrooper blasters here."
starwarsrebels,2v23li,-Misla-,6,Mon Feb 16 09:48:26 2015 UTC,great ep. Maybe the season will end with vader executing kanan
starwarsrebels,2v23li,Whitney69,3,Sat Feb 7 08:20:00 2015 UTC,"Doubt Vader's a first-season appearance. If he's going to appear in the show, it'll be further down the line, after ""dismissing"" the Inquisitor for incompetence. Then the main crew are screwed."
starwarsrebels,2v23li,kablob17,3,Thu Feb 12 23:47:46 2015 UTC,"Vader already appeared. They made a special version of the ""movie"" (seriously Disney, stop calling something that is 44 minutes long without commercials a movie. TCW movie was an actual MOVIE!!!) where he is in. It premiered on ABC. It's voiced by James Earl Jones, and it is also the first time you get to see the Inquisitor (as in, he appears in this extra clip, but regularly we didn't see him until later). It's really not that interesting, definitely not as much as they hyped it."
starwarsrebels,2v23li,Ledpinkphish,1 point,Mon Feb 16 05:07:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I count that as a cameo, not a proper appearance, hence my saying he'd only appear (ie, in the flesh so to speak) later."
starwarsrebels,2v23li,triarii3,1 point,Mon Feb 16 14:58:11 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay. Just wanted to inform you in case you had missed it. But yeah, it's definitely more like a cameo."
starwarsrebels,2v23li,themenace95,-3,Mon Feb 16 19:55:26 2015 UTC,I don't think they are going to kill kanan off soon because of disney trying to sell toys of this show.
starwarsrebels,2v23li,HolyFiloni,18,Sat Feb 7 20:34:08 2015 UTC,"Also, because, you know, he's one of the main characters of the show and it would be a bad narrative move to kill him this early?"
starwarsrebels,2v23li,Stained_Panda,9,Sun Feb 8 03:52:20 2015 UTC,And also because Freddie Prince Jr said they have been recording like 20 episodes for season 2.

starwarsrebels,2v01rn,Tuskin38,5,Fri Feb 6 18:52:35 2015 UTC,"Republic police gunship:       Police gunships patrolling the Coruscant underworld The Republic police gunships possessed a spoked cockpit and solar gatherer panels. It also possessed a similar drive to the LAAT/i gunships, as evidenced by their sound.  They were also equipped with searchlights in the event that they had to conduct searches at night or in areas of Coruscant where visibility was low, such as the underworld. The gunships also had two ball-mounted laser cannons underneath the cockpit and one laser cannon mounted on the rear of the ship.   The gunship was available to both droid and flesh-and-blood members of the CSF. It was less armed than the LAAT/i, but was nonetheless preferred due to its better suitability for patrolling the city scape as well as it having a lower risk overall in causing collateral damage. The solar gatherer panels, which were connected to the ship via arms on the ship, acted as the power generator for the ship. The vehicle's cockpit also had two seats for the pilot and gunner, with the pilot being slightly behind of and elevated over the gunner. The side hatches opened for entry, and had a ramp near the rear in the event that the circumstances required rapid deployment of its personnel. It was primarily utilized by police officers, although it was also known to be used by members of the Coruscant Guard under certain circumstances.

starwarsrebels,2v01rn,MesyJesy,12,Fri Feb 6 17:38:48 2015 UTC,"The iconic TIE wings are actually radiators, not solar panels. Solar panels that size would obviously never be able to provide enough power for a TIE, whereas any power source that could would naturally build up a lot of heat. Getting rid of heat-build up in space is very difficult - the wings serve the purpose of radiating waste heat so that the pilot isn't cooked alive.  I am not sure what purpose they serve on the gunship, which is apparently supposed to be atmospheric. Maybe they're just a Sienar brand thing."

starwarsrebels,2uyrvi,Nihillo,8,Fri Feb 6 10:42:20 2015 UTC,"The ""Ahsoka symbol"" thing never really made sense, anyway. The main evidence for Ahsoka being Fulcrum is the descrambled voice."
starwarsrebels,2uyrvi,Galle_,2,Fri Feb 6 19:12:56 2015 UTC,I'll be a bit disappointed if Fulcrum isn't Ahsoka.
starwarsrebels,2uyrvi,Jangwin,2,Fri Feb 6 08:43:14 2015 UTC,I hope it isn't Ahsoka so people will shut up about it. I'd much rather her be left out of Rebels entirely and reappear in her own standalone novel/comic series.
starwarsrebels,2uyrvi,boomkinburger,8,Fri Feb 6 11:16:55 2015 UTC,"I think it's better if she is, because if she is Fulcrum then people will have their moment and stop going on about it. But if she isn't, people will just come up with 15 new and more convoluted ways they can have Ahsoka show up."

starwarsrebels,2uyrvi,iowajaycee,1 point,Sat Feb 7 14:13:57 2015 UTC,The French voice over actress for Ahsoka now has a credit listed on her website for Ahsoka disguised as Fulcrum. Fulcrum IS Ahsoka!
starwarsrebels,2uyrvi,bawork22,1 point,Sun Feb 8 22:01:26 2015 UTC,"I just don't see it being Ahsoka.  We don't know much about Fulcrum but whoever it is seems to be in charge of a Corellian Corvette (perhaps their own?) and capable of acquiring secret information and brokering that information.  Ahsoka is more of a warrior Jedi who disappeared after leaving the order. She doesn't seem like someone with a network capable of pulling off what Fulcrum does. Ahsoka likely doesn't have many ties to the Empire anymore; it'd be very difficult to with Order 66 and all. And how would Ahsoka be in possession of a Corvette? Perhaps she's just hitching a ride but it just doesn't seem like something a Jedi-in-hiding would be capable of pulling off.   I have little doubt that we will see Ahsoka (her dueling Vader is just TOO compelling not to show) but not in this capacity.  Mon Mothma and her merry band of Bothan spies seems like a more logical fit to me. She's a Senator with ties to the Empire, thus she has access to useful information. And being a Senator, she could easily have the funds and resources to run a spy network. We know she runs one in the OT after all.  So she's my guess and I think she'd be a great choice. She's in on the ground floor of the Rebellion and ends up a major player as we see in the OT."
starwarsrebels,2uyrvi,matty25,1 point,Mon Feb 9 01:39:02 2015 UTC,I was a little resistant to this just because there's a lot more interesting things that could be done with her.  I think the French voice actor thing though pretty much says it all and being too playful with Ahsoka would probably backfire on them.  The only way it could be anyone but Ahsoka and not be a let down would be if it were Vader or someone ironic like that.
starwarsrebels,2uyrvi,RealVoltar,1 point,Mon Feb 9 03:23:13 2015 UTC,"This is the symbol that shows up on Fulcrum's crates in ""Out of Darkness.""  It looks like Ahsoka's forehead designs, and if Fulcrum turns out to be Ahsoka then it'll be a solid connection, but for the blogger to say it's an outright ""Ahsoka symbol"" might be taking it a little too far."

The Empire had 15 years to hunt him down and purge the Mandalorians who followed him, I would be surprised if there's anything left resembling the Shadow Collective of old."
starwarsrebels,2us0jg,Nihillo,8,Wed Feb 4 21:02:51 2015 UTC,It would be neat if Sabine's backstory was intertwined with Maul's.

starwarsrebels,2utvxr,benedictFocker,9,Thu Feb 5 02:54:02 2015 UTC,The art will get better as the show progresses. Right now they don't have as much animation and 3D object to pull from like they did as TCW seasons went on.   Right now they are having to create entirely new stuff for every episode which does not allow them to make it as nice with little time. That's why the episodes look better every week.   They still do however borrow some things from TCW for Rebels. Like the ships in the most recent rebels episode were borrowed from a TCW episode as another user on this sub pointed out earlier this week.
starwarsrebels,2utvxr,fullheadofha1r,2,Thu Feb 5 05:39:25 2015 UTC,"They use quite a few assets from Clone Wars, you can see that in the Trivia galleries on the website. , the Blown up Republic gunship model in the abandoned Republic baase was from the Temple attack arc. Anything that says ""Sourced From"" on the image.  The head of an Imperial droid in an episode was ripped right from M5-BZ and repainted according to some concept art."
starwarsrebels,2utvxr,Tuskin38,11,Sat Feb 7 13:39:57 2015 UTC,It's a tribute to the McQuarrie art style.  Look at old concept art for the OT
starwarsrebels,2utvxr,zackmanze,5,Thu Feb 5 05:37:09 2015 UTC,"The appearance and expressions of the characters have a distinct ""Disney"" look to them, which... makes sense, regardless of our opinion, while the backgrounds and visuals are heavily inspired by Ralph McQuarrie (like zackmanze said).  I have one pet peeve with the art in this show: I don't like the caricatured look of the Stormtrooper helmets, it feels a bit out of place to me, I mean, the rest of the Imperial tech looks semi-realistic so why are the helmets stylized? They did the same thing for the Phase I armor in the Clone Wars, and I kind of grew used to it, but I did prefer the more realistic depiction of Phase II. This is probably just a personal preference thing, I don't mind the style, but I don't like it when they mess with the helmets."

starwarsrebels,2utvxr,boomkinburger,4,Thu Feb 5 11:53:54 2015 UTC,"Nah man, I'm with you. Count Dooku and Kenobi's beard really stood out to me as weird looking. I especially hated the wide phase one clone trooper helmets. A lot of the animation on that show was amazing but there were design choices that stood out as bad."
starwarsrebels,2utvxr,dawnsavenger,1 point,Thu Feb 5 19:47:46 2015 UTC,"Same here. Actually it was one of the reasons I passed on TCW initially (I saw the Clone Wars movie in theaters and was so disappointed that I never gave the show a chance till it hit Netflix). Mainly it was some of the character's faces that bothered me the most (Padme stands out as the worst to look at).  Whereas I am finding that I really enjoy the designs of Rebels, particularly the explosions. There are some issues (Ezra's hair) but they are few and far between. Really I think it just comes down to if you're a fan of the OT or the PT styles."

starwarsrebels,2unyc8,boomkinburger,7,Tue Feb 3 22:25:11 2015 UTC,It almost seems like the wait is either  a) to drag out season one  or   b)the creators are literally animating the episodes as quickly as they can :/
starwarsrebels,2unyc8,ForestKing,5,Thu Feb 5 02:01:21 2015 UTC,"I'm betting it's option A. Someone was saying they were trying to drag Season 1 to close to May, when it is rumored the Season 2 trailer will be revealed."
starwarsrebels,2unyc8,capncoke,3,Tue Feb 3 22:52:35 2015 UTC,And probably help season two align perfectly with film release and hype.

starwarsrebels,2unyc8,RVierra327,2,Fri Feb 6 02:08:47 2015 UTC,But aren't there only two more episodes left?
starwarsrebels,2unyc8,RealVoltar,2,Mon Feb 9 20:11:45 2015 UTC,The season two premier is airing at Star Wars Celebration in mid-April so I would think that the people behind the show would want the first season to be over by then.  Especially with the way they are talking about a big twist in the finale.  They wouldnt want people watching season two before season one even ends.
starwarsrebels,2unyc8,boomkinburger,2,Sat Feb 7 06:12:53 2015 UTC,I've seen some rumor saying that the second season might begin airing during the summer as opposed to waiting until September/October. I could very well see a June/July air date for the Season 2 premiere (if not earlier) and have the season finale a month or so before TFA premieres.
starwarsrebels,2unyc8,Keiano,2,Sun Feb 8 20:40:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's irritating but I'm guessing the next season with (allegedly) twice the episodes will fit into the tv schedule better.

I thought there would be 16 episodes in the season (not counting the pilot movie, Spark of the Rebellion).  IMDB, while not always 100% accurate, seems to indicate we have at least 4 more episodes after ""Call to Action."""
starwarsrebels,2um5dq,JabbaJohnL,1 point,Wed Feb 4 15:14:03 2015 UTC,"Lucasfilm has stated that there are 16 episodes this season, so you're correct there.  From a production standpoint, the shorts that introduced the characters (""Art Attack,"" ""The Machine in the Ghost,"" etc.) counted as four parts of one episode, production number 101, as far as Lucasfilm Animation is concerned.  ""Spark of Rebellion"" counts as two episodes, 102 and 103.  The first aired episode of the series, ""Droids in Distress,"" is production code 104, though it aired as episode 101.  So with three episodes eaten up by the shorts and ""Spark of Rebellion,"" there are only 13 regular 21-minute episodes this season.  Unfortunately, IMDB's info is dubious at best and should be treated as such."
starwarsrebels,2um5dq,Regular_Erik,2,Thu Feb 5 19:08:35 2015 UTC,"Okay, this is a good explanation of it all. While I'm sad the season is almost over, it has been building to these last few episodes and I think the season is going to end strongly."

I still think we won't see her until the audience stops wondering about her...or at least until they wonder more about the main characters than her.

starwarsrebels,2um5dq,iowajaycee,2,Tue Feb 3 19:15:26 2015 UTC,"So with two episodes after Call to Action, maybe we see one with the Ghost Crew trying to free Kanan, or at least planning, and probably getting help or being impeded by Hondo, and then in the last episode Fulcrum (who I believe to be Ashoka) is revealed and steps in to help free Kanan, and we probably see the death of someone big, good or evil"

starwarsrebels,2ulhkz,SiberianHuskies,8,Tue Feb 3 06:20:45 2015 UTC,That whole image was pretty unfortunate.  It looked like they posed for a cast picture for merchandise packaging or something.  My suspension of disbelief was able to handle it though.
starwarsrebels,2ulhkz,RealVoltar,2,Tue Feb 3 09:31:03 2015 UTC,That was my thought too.
starwarsrebels,2ulhkz,Seryan_Klythe,4,Tue Feb 3 22:28:38 2015 UTC,"The Empire has made the Jedi look like traitors and the bad guys. Having someone 'pretending to a Jedi' is just another way to make the Rebels look like bad guys.   Of course, some people know better. Tarkin knows better. He knows what the Jedi can do to inspire people."
starwarsrebels,2ulhkz,Lanuria,3,Tue Feb 3 14:10:13 2015 UTC,"In A New Dawn (book), Kanan was extra precautionary when it came to showing his lightsaber and I think Hera was the only person who did see it. (EDIT: I originally thought he used it, he didn't.)  It goes back to that whole incident when Obi Wan whipped out a lightsaber in the Cantina. People just assumed that he killed a Jedi and is using one."
starwarsrebels,2ulhkz,Seryan_Klythe,1 point,Tue Feb 3 22:32:32 2015 UTC,Actually Kanan never used his lightsaber in the book (unless I missed something). He doesn't willingly use the Force until the end however.
starwarsrebels,2ulhkz,boomkinburger,1 point,Wed Feb 4 17:02:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think you missed anything, because sadly I didn't see it either. Very disappointing because I kept waiting and waiting for him to use it, but it never happened."

starwarsrebels,2ulhkz,MeowingtonHax,1 point,Tue Feb 3 10:49:08 2015 UTC,"Nah. The Imperials are going to use Kannan to make an example of him, and show the public that the Jedi are long gone, and he's just a poser. A pretender. There's a reason they wanted to take him alive. Tarkin basically says as much when he landed."
starwarsrebels,2ujknq,The--Comet,6,Mon Feb 2 18:46:17 2015 UTC,"There was only one major Rebel victory before the first movie, so it's unlikely to occur anytime soon in the series.

Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.

That being said, I also think that the scaled down, isolated sense of scope in Rebels is much more suitable, and I'd honestly be happy if we went the whole series without any major battles, because I don't think they'd really be appropriate to the events we've already seen."
starwarsrebels,2ujknq,boomkinburger,1 point,Mon Feb 2 22:45:19 2015 UTC,"Only way I could see this being pulled off, would be in the show's last season when the Rebel Alliance is finally formed and they're going more head to head with Imperial forces. That's the only way it could work and make sense. Even then, we're still not sure how close to the Rebel Alliance the Ghost and crew are going to be."

starwarsrebels,2uftzr,MelonToss,8,Mon Feb 2 03:50:21 2015 UTC,She'll show up. She's got to. But we've got to build up to that. Hondo can just get thrown in wherever.

starwarsrebels,2uftzr,MelonToss,3,Mon Feb 2 11:44:01 2015 UTC,Yeah. My hope is we see her show down with Vader.   Ties up her story and would be very emotional

starwarsrebels,2uftzr,bogibney1,2,Tue Feb 3 01:24:23 2015 UTC,"He'll probably be passing through I bet. Visago seems to be a local.

starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,johnnylavalampus,13,Sun Feb 1 08:17:43 2015 UTC,"For me, I feel like the episodes are way to short, but I'm also not watching them back to back to back like I was TCW. But I agree it is annoying how quickly things are solved. TCW has awesome stories that lasted 3 episodes or more. This one certainly does feel lazier to me. I'm also really really sick of lothal. I think another big difference we have here is that in TCW they had several different groups they could write stories about. We had standalone episodes of the clone troopers, Yoda, anakin, the night watch (I think that's what they were called), night sisters, and just tons of awesome locations. This one really feels like they are restricting because it's a story of the 5 rebels and that's it for them. They are far too limited with such a small group to focus on."
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,fullheadofha1r,3,Sun Feb 1 09:19:19 2015 UTC,"Just because there is a lot more to draw on to compare. For the majority of the episodes the focus would be Anakin, Ahsoka, Obi-wan, and the clone troopers. I think they will branch out more when they establish more of the universe. Like that episode with Ezra and the cadets which was decent. Maybe there will be more rebel cells that they meet up with eventually. Maybe we'll see a young Leia, Bail organa and personally I'd love to see Ahsoka as a Jedi that is being hunted and probably killed."
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,SunsFenix,4,Sun Feb 1 10:06:12 2015 UTC,I would LOVE to see more Ahsoka! I'm pretty sure we will since it is highly likely she will be fulcrum.
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,fullheadofha1r,2,Sun Feb 1 15:49:19 2015 UTC,They had to have kept her canon for a reason.
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,SunsFenix,6,Sun Feb 1 17:14:27 2015 UTC,Well all of clone wars is canon. Do you mean kept her alive?
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,fullheadofha1r,1 point,Sun Feb 1 17:48:18 2015 UTC,I think they would nothing else was really important otherwise. Maybe keeping Darth maul alive still.
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,SunsFenix,13,Mon Feb 2 02:07:26 2015 UTC,"To answer your question... No, I'm not disappointed.  I've said it before, I'll say it again, CW looked childish to me when it first came out, and I didn't even watch the show until this past summer (Netflix binge).  After struggling to get through season 1, the show slowly grew on me and became more about watching characters develop than the animation (which I'm not a fan of).  With Rebels I went in not caring too much about the animation but rather story/characters, and ended up appreciating the ""look"" of Rebels because it reminded me of the OT which I grew up watching over 30 years ago.  Now, whenever a new episode comes out, I sit on the couch with my 11 month old daughter and we get to enjoy the show together.  I have faith in Filoni and his people, and they haven't let me down yet."
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,capncoke,5,Mon Feb 2 04:41:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed. At first I hated Clone Wars and absolutely blasted it for its flaws (of which there were many). However, the show grew on me over time and I now love it (while omitting certain episodes from my viewing list). With Rebels, I have been constantly reminded of the OT and have loved the show from episode 1."
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,TakeMyUsernameAgain,4,Tue Feb 3 00:01:15 2015 UTC,I feel like that has been the most difficult part of trying to watch Rebels. Disney seems to be making it difficult.
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,sniperdude12a,1 point,Sun Feb 1 09:37:31 2015 UTC,"A lot of people also seem to forget that TCW was able to jump right into the awesome because the main characters (aside from the Clones) were already fleshed out at some point prior. Everyone knew who Obi-wan and Anakin and Yoda were. Not to mention, TCW was more epic because it took place during a bloody war! Of course Rebels is going to be less exciting than that right off that bat!"
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,boomkinburger,7,Mon Feb 2 02:19:15 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of this is because it's season 1.  Not only is it important to focus on fleshing out the characters and get to know them before they throw them into bigger important storylines, they also have to make sure that everything ties up nicely in case the show didn't get picked up for another season. I think thats why every episode has been fairly self contained and we haven't seen many multi arc stories."
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,metallicabmc,0,Tue Feb 3 17:56:07 2015 UTC,"With reports stating there will be ""about three seasons"" of rebels, that's no excuse to make. They're not laying the primer for a 6 season show like TCW. Every episode counts here"
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,SiberianHuskies,1 point,Sun Feb 1 13:58:17 2015 UTC,"I agree.  They should jump right in (aka make exciting multi-episode storylines even if they don't necessarily effect the Star Wars universe in any major way).  Rebels got renewed for a second season before anyone really had a chance to hate on it... so the creators must of known they had some leeway.  And anyway, a show SHOULD be more likely to be cancelled if its slow-moving.  I don't think the ""safe"" route is making a bunch of tiny, meaningless stories with no character development or good arcs."
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,Jangwin,0,Sun Feb 1 18:48:27 2015 UTC,The show has already been renewed for a second season.
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,metallicabmc,7,Sun Feb 1 22:11:45 2015 UTC,"Yes but they didn't know that as they were making the first handful of episodes.   EDIT: after watching the newest episode ""Call to Action"" I think we are getting into some meaty multi episode arcs now."
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,zackmanze,7,Mon Feb 2 12:34:49 2015 UTC,"I feel pretty differently about it. For one, I think we've already had a few great episodes.  Specifically Spark of the Rebellion, Rise of the Old Masters, and Path of the Jedi.  Vision of Hope was pretty good too, i'd say it falls in the tier two along with Empire Day, Out of Darkness, Gathering Forces, Droids in Distress, and the empire camp one.    The only two that I think have been really bad are Idiots Array (the Lando one, agree with you totally on that, nothing but fan service) and Fighter Flight.    I think the difference is that Rebels is really focused on story, and Clone Wars was really focused on Plot.  We've had more character development in half a season than we did in like the first four seasons of Clone Wars.  And the absence of three episode arcs I think really, really helps.    The story's not about this big war and the different groups of people in it, it's about a group of people trying to survive and coming together.  It's the reason I love it so much.  It's Character Development instead of Plot, and for me it's an incredibly welcome change."
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,ncm3t4l,3,Mon Feb 2 14:49:10 2015 UTC,"I think it is awesome, but the momentum really needs to pick up if they are going to get any stories told by December."
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,AmunRa666,3,Sun Feb 1 22:26:35 2015 UTC,"it's only ten episodes in. in the first season, and it has big shoes to fill. I am going to give this show a very fair shot.  it's nice that they are doing an over all story arc, but the shows still feel episodic which can be boring sometime."
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,drlothariothuggut,5,Sun Feb 1 14:29:18 2015 UTC,"Perfectly put!! I've been saying this for months. If rebels had never come out, we would still be in the same place, no new knowledge, no contributions to original story line."
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,Seryan_Klythe,2,Sun Feb 1 17:54:52 2015 UTC,Woo thank god.  It had to be said!  I still have high hopes for the show.  :)
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,Lumberj,2,Sun Feb 1 08:53:43 2015 UTC,"I really like this series. I think it has great characters and a great plot in-store. The only thing that bugs me is how neat and tidy some episodes are. I think it comes from them being somewhat stand-alone episodes and not continuous. With this last episode that aired, I think we'll get some of that."
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,Lumberj,2,Sun Feb 1 09:19:58 2015 UTC,"Nope, not at all."
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,boomkinburger,1 point,Tue Feb 3 01:04:40 2015 UTC,Care to elaborate?
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,Lumberj,3,Mon Feb 2 16:17:53 2015 UTC,"Sure.  I take this for what it is.   A simple cartoon featuring SW characters and settings on a DISNEY channel which is predominantly for kiddies.  Yes, some episodes are better than others, but I'm entertained by it.  I don't watch these like some folks who constantly look at anything Star Wars afraid that it's going to 'rape their childhood'.."
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,Sapitoelgato,2,Mon Feb 2 20:13:26 2015 UTC,This.
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,AusSco,0,Mon Feb 2 20:17:42 2015 UTC,"Well maybe you think I'm one of those people-- but I'm not.  I'm very aware that its a kid show, but I still think we can critically analyze it as adults (even as kids, if you want haha).    I guess my point is that it IS possible to make a great kids show which also appeals to adults.  The original animated Clone Wars, and the newer CGI Clone Wars are great examples.    I am also 'entertained' by it, but I think the show is almost too dumbed down.  Like they could make it more appealing to adults, without losing the attention of young viewers.  Thats all :)"

starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,bill2401,1 point,Mon Feb 2 20:23:45 2015 UTC,"Well, I am hoping there will be enough big episodes to make a marathon run in between the movies, with the rest of the episodes I can rewatch at my leisure.   From an interview with James Luceno:  "" I like most of what I’ve seen so far. Whenever a series launches, it sometimes can take half a season or even sometimes a full season before it finds its footing. I know where the series—I’ve read the series bible, I’ve read outlines of the episodes that are coming up. I’m looking forward to it. I think that everybody’s on the right track.""

starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,Montauket,1 point,Mon Feb 2 20:27:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with a lot of what you say. But I am prepared to gloss over a lot of it.  In general I think because it is still a relatively new show with only half an hour, compared with TCW, that they perhaps need to use a few cheap tricks early on to establish itself within the Star Wars universe. Using a number of well known characters really helps it establish it within the SW universe.  Hopefully as the series goes on, it will be more story arc focused, tying that other recruit that Ezra befriended and more connections with Fulcrum. Once the characters are all established, I think we still don't know enough about Hera and Sabine, we'll get more Rebellion orientated episodes. They have already shown the hand of the ""rebellion governor"" so his character is now pretty dead to the series given the time they gave him in the show."
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,RealVoltar,1 point,Sun Feb 1 13:26:23 2015 UTC,"The show isn't perfect, but in saying that it is pretty solid, the attn to detail is remarkable, it feels like an extension of the OT, the music, the ships, the uniforms, I think a lot of folks forget it's a Disney cartoon, and who it's target audience is :p"
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,Binturung,1 point,Mon Feb 2 09:13:03 2015 UTC,"It's not perfect, but it's getting better and better. Clone Wars started out much worse and that show ended up great."
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,FinchMPYADafty,1 point,Mon Feb 2 18:49:20 2015 UTC,"I have mixed feelings  NEGATIVE  1: The show is very childish - but so was the first season of TCW. Guns get shot out of people's hands, blasters knock stormtroopers on their butts, and I feel like it's very G-rated comic violence. Tonight's episode showed a hand-grenade going off, only for the agent K to kinda ""shrug it off"" and cough once or twice.  2: The episodes are quite short, and we are seeing ""mission of the week"" stuff. 22 minutes for the gang to develop a problem, plot a solution, have something unexpected happen to them during their op, and then a 1-minute wrap up with a sort of ""lesson thing"" as a take-away. Simple things like ""believe in yourself"" or ""trust your friends"". I get that the show is watched by children, but I think children could follow a 3-episode arc with some cliff hangers.  3: The galaxy feels too damn small. THey have not left the planet yet, and despite the fact that agent K, the inquisitor, and apparently now even TARKIN are involved, we are seeing derp-troopers foolishly trace them without success. Here is one of the ONLY JEDI to have survived the purges, and a MAJOR concern for the empire, but they can't spend more than like 12 troops at a time to find them? Yawn.  POSITIVE  1: I actually like the characters. They have the same flavor, and rag-tag attitude to them as the OT crew, or the crew from Firefly. They're a wacky little space-family that has it's problems like all families.  2: The women actually do stuff. Hera is clearly in charge of her ship, and Sabine is a character that doesn't simply fall in line - she has her own mysterious back-ground, her issues with trust, and doesn't fall into the ""damsel in distress"" trope, but instead more of an ""armed and dangerous"" category.  3: Artwork, design, and cinematography. So much classic design, Mquiarre (spelling?) inspired things have made it's way into the universe, and rebels makes perfect use of previously unused material. Other small things like speeder bike chases, cityscapes, and general ""immersion"" are a really welcome sight.  If the show can start to make more complex and several-episode arcs I think we'll see an animated series that will not only rival, but surpass TCW. I would LOVE to see an 8-9 season show where we are introduced to the larger galaxy, and the origin story of the rebellion, but for now I'm happy to have this little firefly crew and their 20 minute adventures."
starwarsrebels,2ue3xv,Basatc,1 point,Tue Feb 3 03:50:57 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm posting this after we've both seen Call to Action and I think we both had similar feelings about that.  I thought that each show felt rushed...like they had to run past the plot as fast as possible.  I'd been fine with just getting a little weekly dose of SW with cute dialogue and a fun little story.  I agree, they overdo the cameos.  I'm always happy to get more Lando for instance but that was a terrible story.  The only thing I liked about the episode was that Lando was in it.  Out of Darkness...the anti-Star Wars episode....Since when is, ""shut up and follow orders because I say so,"" the message in Star Wars?  That's the only one I actively dislike...I thought Empire Day and Gathering Forces were good.  Of course, now I realize that this latest episode is either a great anomaly or a transition in tone for the show.  We'll see."
starwarsrebels,2u62av,SiberianHuskies,14,Fri Jan 30 05:14:52 2015 UTC,"Well there's almost ten years (IIRC) between New Dawn and Rebels. So chances are she's changed since the book.

starwarsrebels,2u62av,CrapAbbles,1 point,Fri Jan 30 05:43:07 2015 UTC,"Just curious, where did the number come from for the 10 year time difference?  In this interview with Vanessa Marshall she says probably less than 5 years."
starwarsrebels,2u62av,FrankiePoops,1 point,Mon Feb 2 18:04:36 2015 UTC,"Ten years is not correct, but the interval is greater than 5 years. A New Dawn is set 8 years after Revenge of the Sith and Star Wars Rebels is set 6 years after that. We know this because it's established when AnD occurred, and Ezra is now 14. Either way, it's plenty of time for her attitude to evolve."
starwarsrebels,2u62av,pinkodoug,1 point,Mon Feb 2 18:28:12 2015 UTC,"Actually it it's six years. I just looked it up. I don't know why, but I thought New Dawn was 5 years after Episode III and Rebels was a few years before Episode IV."

starwarsrebels,2u62av,Its_Beerdy,7,Fri Jan 30 07:26:39 2015 UTC,"I think the main reason is that Rebels is still a kid's cartoon show, while New Dawn was a novel directed at older audiences. The show runners may have chosen to tone her down a bit to be more accessible to kids.   In a way that ties the stories together a bit more, I think I have to agree with u/CrapAbbles."
starwarsrebels,2u62av,kerouac5,3,Sun Feb 1 01:50:53 2015 UTC,"Hera, based in rebels dialogue, has learned more about the inexorable link between her cause (rebellion) and the jedi. As such, she's more inclined to encourage kanan to be ""softer"" an be so herself.   Don't forget she's the one who encouraged kanan to take Ezra in and train him."

Somewhere with a lot of vegetation and animal life to hide their force signature. Like Yoda on Dagobah or like Mara and Anakin on Dantooine (EU). Lothal doesn't have much on it to hide a force signature. But I digress  My question came up based upon a THIS post talking about the relationship to the Rebellion. I was hoping to see the proximity to other events from canon to make a guess of how involved they could have been in, say, the Battle of Yavin."

Kanan sabotaged an Imperial ceremony where they revealed a new fighter prototype, destroyed crucial supplies for their super weapons and commited many other random acts of rebellion, not to mention that he used a lightsaber to fight a squad of Stormtroopers. It's not so much that he was detected by the Imperial Inquisition, it's just that he brazenly brought all of this attention to himself.  At any rate, I have heard that the Ghost crew and the Original Trilogy crew will not be cooperating directly at any point, apparently they will always be on the opposite side of the galaxy, fighting their own war against the Empire.   That doesn't mean that there won't be any cameos in Rebels though (such as Lando's)."

The Ghost crew may have heard something about Yavin and a Death Star but they certainly weren't there taking part in those events.  The Ghost crew may end up being part of the larger Rebel Alliance, but they will be off doing their own thing while Luke, Leia, Han and Chewie are doing their thing.  It's a big galaxy."

Rebel groups like the crew were operating across the galaxy, some bigger than others but they weren't really working together. Princess Leia played a big part in convincing rebel groups to join together to form the Rebel Alliance, making their first joint victory the capture of the plans of the Death Star. With Fulcrum might be Leia, or Winter her bodyguard that worked like her double much like Padme did during TPM. So it does seem that it is possible since the ship Fulcrum retrieved the Rodian(I forgot his name) in was the same type of ship from the start of ANH."

I figured they'd introduce him, then build it up to a big reveal. I think I'm glad they didn't, though. All in all, pretty solid episode.

I knew from the moment they walked in and saw Trayvis that he was going to double cross them and was most likely an Imperial spy.

starwarsrebels,2tpgvk,fullheadofha1r,1 point,Tue Jan 27 11:20:30 2015 UTC,"They might seem shorter since every episode of Rebels is standalone for the most part, and Clone Wars always had multi-episode arcs."

The space station was too big to build on a planet."

It does make abit sense that the Death Star would be to big to build on a planet, but all the talk in Rebels of how there are alot of Empire activity on Lothal makes me think that the sphere has some meaning to it, perhaps the Empires ""Alpha test Death Star""? Then again, the Empire activity on Lothar might just aswell be because our Rebel crew is hanging out on that planet alot."
starwarsrebels,2tq2w6,mjsmith1223,7,Mon Jan 26 17:07:38 2015 UTC,It is in the novel Tarkin by James Luceno. Great read that mentions so many obscure characters from the Empire.
starwarsrebels,2tq2w6,StealthRabbi,2,Mon Jan 26 17:29:48 2015 UTC,Sienar Systems is located on Lothal.  They are manufacturing Tie fighters for the Empire.
starwarsrebels,2tq2w6,ADefiniteDescription,-1,Mon Jan 26 17:37:00 2015 UTC,"The book he is referring to is Tarkin. Personally, I didn't care for the book as much as the author's other work, Darth Plageuis. THe Tarkin book has very little to do with the Dearth Star.  There is a book called Death Star with various stories about people on the station. Haven't read it myself."
starwarsrebels,2tq2w6,StealthRabbi,3,Mon Jan 26 17:30:46 2015 UTC,"I loved Tarkin, although I agree with you that it wasn't as good as Darth Plageuis. That's because the latter was one of the best Star Wars books in a long time."
starwarsrebels,2tq2w6,ADefiniteDescription,2,Mon Jan 26 23:52:48 2015 UTC,"I felt Tarkin ended up being more of a crime novel without much of an interesting plot. I was hoping for more character development and relationship explanation between Tarkin and Vader, but there was little. While the backstory to Tarkin hunting on the plateau was interesting, I question why they had the need to make Tarkin in to this almost supernaturally smart, powerful, and wise being. He could have just excelled at being a ""regular guy"" and done well in the empire. Was it just an excuse to make a book?  Also, the giving of the first name for Palpatine seemed really unnecessary and forced, although it did seem a bit odd that he was never given a first name before."
starwarsrebels,2tq2w6,whatIsaRedditt,2,Tue Jan 27 01:31:30 2015 UTC,Totally agreed about the Palpatine name. I have no idea why that was needed.

starwarsrebels,2tq2w6,cunningmunki,3,Tue Feb 3 22:20:56 2015 UTC,"The big black mushroom dome thingie is the Imperial complex. Rather than use Lothal's old senate building, the Empire built a new one."
starwarsrebels,2tq2w6,cunningmunki,5,Mon Jan 26 17:59:59 2015 UTC,"I wondered that, it's definitely out of place compared the the other buildings. I assumed it was a Core ship leftover from the Clone Wars, and didn't really give it another thought, but it does look much more like a mini-Death Star under construction than a Core ship.  The thing it reminded me of the most, though, was this concept drawing from Mcquarrie."
starwarsrebels,2tq2w6,boomkinburger,2,Mon Jan 26 16:24:13 2015 UTC,"That concept drawing looks alot like the sphere on Lothal, is that like a ""mini Death star"" or what is it?"
starwarsrebels,2tq2w6,boomkinburger,4,Mon Jan 26 17:03:33 2015 UTC,ROTJ was originally going to have two Death Stars in orbit around Had Abaddon (aka Coruscant). That's RM's concept painting of them.
starwarsrebels,2tq2w6,GrandpaSquarepants,2,Mon Jan 26 18:32:24 2015 UTC,It looks more akin to the senate building on Coruscant.

starwarsrebels,2t2qmp,DogmaticCat,5,Wed Jan 21 04:19:40 2015 UTC,I honestly don't see it happening either. It seems like the comic is based on his life before Rebels so while it will fill in a gap it probably won't impact things much.

In amongst the whole spoilerman debacle he said that Max Von Sydow's character was going to be mostly cyborg. spoilerman also said his character survived both the prequel and original trilogies. Someone later on said they thought Von Sydow is Kanan and Andy Serkis is Ezra who turns evil. So what if they kill off Kanan in Rebels in some manner that he could've survived (a fall, a fire, a jump, Ezra 'kills' him in the same manner that Obi-Wan thought he killed Anakin) then they explain his backstory in Last Padawan just in time to be more connected to him for his reappearance, albeit in a disfigured form, in TFA. I dunno."
starwarsrebels,2t2qmp,ChiSoxBoy,6,Wed Jan 21 02:55:20 2015 UTC,The spoilerman was proven to be a fake though.

starwarsrebels,2t2qmp,FrankiePoops,2,Tue Jan 20 19:04:02 2015 UTC,Ahsoka was no longer a padawan but i don't think the title means anything more than likely it's just because thats how it seems to Kanan he won't have any idea if any other padawans or jedi survived.

starwarsrebels,2sxrxp,BlueSmoke95,5,Mon Jan 19 14:55:38 2015 UTC,"Sorry, that wasn't clear. I wasn't thinking we'd follow them through that era, but they would go off into it while we stuck with the Rebel Alliance."
starwarsrebels,2sxrxp,BlueSmoke95,-6,Mon Jan 19 14:56:41 2015 UTC,"Even so, that is a few years out.  Here is what I predict:    Ashoka will be revealed as Fulcrum, only to be killed in the same episode by the Inquisitor, or more likely, Vader There will be a massive Imperial ambush later on In which, Hera will go down with the Ghost Zeb will be killed by Kallus Ezra will fall to the dark side and kill Kanan, then in a fit of rage, kill Kallus and the Inquisitor before being brought down by Stormtroopers Chopper will probably go out with Hera Sabine will be caught up in a Death Watch revival arc and run off with a group of Mandalorians fighting the Death Watch"

starwarsrebels,2sxrxp,countjared,9,Mon Jan 19 15:17:06 2015 UTC,"I find it hard to believe that Ahsoka could be taken down by the Inquisitor. She was well on her way to being a Jedi Knight and, after 15 years, could well be at the level of a Master.  Also, I don't get the impression that the Sith underlings would've been left to develop their powers and threaten the big 2.  It flies in the face of the whole rule of 2 thing.  They could, of course, just blow up her ship or something."

I can see him not making it by being killed by the Inquisitor or Vader, but everyone else I foresee surviving and once they are caught up with the ANH timeline, they'll leave it open ended so that a third party can continue their stories or utilize them in the upcoming movies. Ezra and Sabine would definitely still be alive (as far as age), Hera and Zeb I think would be though I'm not sure on the lifespan of their species. Chopper is a droid so yeah. I'd much rather see it end up this way and have books written detailing what happens to them, whether they joined the Rebel Alliance or went their separate ways."
starwarsrebels,2sxrxp,Snorhax,4,Tue Jan 20 17:04:07 2015 UTC,I think the only one who is going to die is Kanan.   If they kill Chopper I quit Star Wars.   Ashoka can't die at the hands of anyone but Vader. Unless Palpatine kills her while he makes Vader watch.   Ezra will probably go dark side.

starwarsrebels,2sx3va,NimTheDoor,13,Mon Jan 19 08:52:36 2015 UTC,Wouldn't Leia be like 14 at this point in time? I don't think Bail would let her go off and do that sort of stuff.
starwarsrebels,2sx3va,returningtheday,11,Mon Jan 19 09:01:27 2015 UTC,"She was 19 by the Battle of Yavin and already a Senator by then. And maybe Bail doesn't know. Or maybe he does.  We are talking about a fictional universe where a 9 year old accidentally blows up a starship. Granted the 9 year old was Anakin, but Leia is his daughter and it isn't surprising that she would be gifted. As far as anyone knows there is no age restriction to becoming a Senator. Hell, Padme was Queen of Naboo when she was like 14, and she was making leadership decisions for that planet.  Leia is the Princess of Alderaan. Wouldn't surprise me if she's already a Senator at 14 (especially since the Senate holds no real power in the Empire and is kept purely for propaganda)."
starwarsrebels,2sx3va,returningtheday,3,Mon Jan 19 09:06:02 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I see your point. I'm still hoping it's Ashoka, but sure I can see Leia as a possibility."

starwarsrebels,2sx3va,boomkinburger,5,Tue Jan 20 02:45:48 2015 UTC,"Based off the information in A New Hope, Leia and Bail both had to be in the Rebellion, because Bail tells her about Obi-Wan and she is has the blueprints. The ship she is in, is her Dad's, but Fulcrum's ship is confirmed to be a different ship.  I can see Leia working with Fulcrum, as well as Berch Teller being involved, and of course I am still hoping Ahsoka lived.  I know Han, Chewy, and Lando are not involved at all yet. (Based on Lando's first episode.)  In all honesty Fulcrum could still be a brand new character, but they did hype her up to be an old one.  On a side note, what if Ahsoka is Fulcrum, and she is working with Leia? Would Bail tell Ahsoka that she is Anakin's daughter, or keep it a secret to protect her? There could be a scene, where Anakin gets brought up, and Ahsoka thinks Anakin is dead and talks about something heavy, which only leaves Bail nodding awkwardly."

Wouldn't he just be able to ask Leia for info?

starwarsrebels,2shfq8,Beanstalk4,10,Fri Jan 16 02:18:19 2015 UTC,"Nah I think it fit with the other Eps where reality sinks in for the crew. They need to do these odd jobs in order to fund their core adventure. Having Lando be part of it wasn't necessary but at the same time not pointless. Here's why.  We saw the birth of Lando's mining empire which does two things; it serves as quasi origin to the character but also proves how different the galaxy is come ESB. It's around 7 years before we see cloud city and in that time Lando went from pig farming to cloud mining.   Lando strikes the right mix of menace and value to the empire , becoming a new breed of legitimate businessman in line with a new regime (bounty hunters anyone?). he is a product of the natural order of the galaxy. If the ghost is to keep up they must adapt."

starwarsrebels,2shfq8,laser-fox,3,Thu Jan 15 16:20:02 2015 UTC,I hope it turns out Fulcrum is Ahsoka.
starwarsrebels,2shfq8,sooperlol,7,Fri Jan 16 12:25:31 2015 UTC,"I think its more likely it is Ahsoka to be sure, Fulcrum's refusal to be seen by the rest of the Ghost crew and the altered voice make it seem likely, since unaltered people would recognize the voice actress or if a different voice actor for whatever reason, a female voice would make people think its her. Not wanting to be seen is worrying someone would recognize her as a former Jedi.   But then again, it could just be an original character."

Hera knows who Fulcrum is, but the rest of her team doesn't need to know and so they don't.   I imagine they have a one-time code or dead drop to make contact with the Rebellion if Hera should be killed or captured."

Every segment has to stand alone and have no reference to the prior? Kanan would most certainly know Yoda as he is a Jedi and Vader is the Inquisitor's boss. Why would they not know each other? Obi Wan sent out a general communication to the Jedi, and Kanan is a Jedi. There is nothing forced about that. And then all you did is name the primary characters that the story of this universe focuses upon. If no one in the galaxy is allowed to meet, then why even tell a story? Just like any movie, you could say there are 7 billion people in the world, why am I watching these people? I don't see your point at all. Nothing about this is convoluted, it's just keeping an audience interested as a show is starting out by framing their story in the background of a much larger, much beloved universe."

I was watching an episode of TCW (Escape from Kedavo) and saw some ships that seemed to be based on his Imperial shuttle designs from his sketch book.  It seems like McQuarrie's concept art is in vogue at the moment.
starwarsrebels,2s70dq,robotafterall,38,Mon Jan 12 19:23:24 2015 UTC,"Really happy Hera got some more screentime. It was 1000 times better then her last major role in a episode which was between her and Sabine.  Also am glad that this episode involved all the characters from the crew,  Overall it was an entertaining episode really glad that they are bringing in some old voices with Yoda and Lando.   Some gripes though, facial animation was a bit off especially Lando it really didn't come across as cool and charismatic as they hoped but his voice really saved it from being too off putting.   Now some negatives.  I am really annoyed about is that Zeb and Ezra are always causing the team problems. Betting  Chopper in a game of cards is fine, it isn't something too far fetched.   I'm talking about the complete dumb shit they pull off. I can understand oh they are lazing about on the ship nothing is happening let's go chase each other around.   But when the ship is going through an Imperial blockade, your ship is wanted in the Empire espically on Lothal would it not be wise not to open the god damn crate. But ok you opened the crate whoops now it's a big puffy animal that blocks separates the Pilot from the cockpit. Your ship is being scanned. Now is not the time to start to climb over it. It feels so forced, I understand Zeb, Ezra not mature but I honestly feel like anyone above the age of 8 would realise that when you are going through a blockade it is not the time to mess around.   Compare that in RotJ when Luke and the gang are trying to get past the Fleet at Endor, that was extremely intense and everyone was on their edge of the seat. C3-PO didn't decide to random start lecturing R2 and providing some slap-stick comedy."
starwarsrebels,2s70dq,Stained_Panda,15,Tue Jan 13 11:37:02 2015 UTC,"I guess it's a kid's show and they justify doing that sort of thing as comic relief for kids.  I don't think they need to though. I think plenty of shows and films have proven that you don't need to pander to kids like they're utterly without an attention span or completely lacking an appreciation of ""serious"" stories.  I enjoyed the prequels when I was a kid but the OT always stayed with me the most, despite mostly leaving slapstick at the door and being pretty grim on occasion."

starwarsrebels,2s70dq,Chewblacka,2,Sat Jan 17 15:13:44 2015 UTC,Chopper is amazing! My absolute favorite.
starwarsrebels,2s70dq,piperknight,22,Wed Jan 21 18:56:43 2015 UTC,"It seems that they have two tones to the show.  One is more serious and generally involves Ezra as a Padawan, Kanan as Master, the force, and the Inquisitor. The other tone is lighter and involves Ezra as a misfit kid, Zeb, and Chopper getting the crew in to trouble some how.   The lighter episodes often follow the serious episodes, this can sometimes make the series seem a little bit choppy or not flowing as much.   Add in a major cameo with Lando being voice by BDW and it kind of threw off the storyline a bit. The Frank Oz cameo worked better because it was a smaller role toward the middle/end of the show. With Lando, he dominated the entire episode with little warning other than the teasers they gave us.  I think Lando should have made a surprise appearance at the end of an episode with a ""To Be Continued"" and then give him a starring role in the following week's episode. As it stands, the Lando cameo was a little bit forced just for the sake of having him in the show.   All that said, Idiot's Array was definitely a lighter episode which immediately makes it pale in comparison to the more serious episodes like Path of the Jedi. However, for a lighter episode, I do think this one was much better than others like Fighter Flight. While Lando was a bit forced, they did nail his personality as a scheming charmer who the females of the crew certainly had more respect for than the males. Also, the puffer pig worked for me and I liked Ezra and Kanan's exchange about the lightsabers."
starwarsrebels,2s70dq,matty25,27,Tue Jan 13 16:50:45 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed it. i actually found the puffer pig to be pretty amusing and I'm happy Chopper was a big player in this episode.  Billy Dee sounds a bit more goofy and whimsical than he did in the original movies but whatever. He also had a pretty cool looking blaster.   I liked this episode a lot and hopefully Lando shows up again.   Also this seems to indicate that Han has possession of the Falcon already. Which isn't really news, but still."

For one thing, Lando elevates the entire episode purely in entertainment value. Getting to hear and see him on screen again is just special. Plus, we get to see Hera outside of the Ghost some more. I love her character, but she's too often pigeon holed into either the pilot who always gets left behind on the ship providing comms, or playing the nurturing mother. She can really kick some butt and it's fun to see her do her own thing for once.  Overall, pretty good episode. I enjoyed watching it, and will probably give it a repeat. Not bad."

The dialogue had some holes, some remain laughable, and I really hope that they improve on this department. A good example would be:  (puffer-pig inflates) Kanan: ""What is going on here?!"" Ezra: (somethingsomething) Kanan: ""I don't want to know.""  As every Star Wars fan feels, there is still the trope of the Empire being almost utterly useless. The episode also had the pointless fight scenes with blaster it had previous episodes wherein we all know we just don't feel attached to the outcome as much as other fight scenes.

As evil as the Empire is, I can't imagine them taking kindly to anybody launching orbital bombardments.  If you're saying he should have bombarded Lando from the start, he's initially looking to get his pig back (and maybe Hera too), not just kill Lando. He would take a total loss on the deal your way, and he had no way of knowing that the crew of the ghost could even put up a fight against his large force of trained guards.  After a sound defeat at the hands of the Ghost, I can't see him wanting to piss rebels off either.

starwarsrebels,2s631g,Lumberj,11,Mon Jan 12 14:56:15 2015 UTC,"Really liked Lando and his charisma, and how he interacted with all of the crew members especially Chopper. I also love how the show is has many tricks up its sleeve that wasn't obvious when the show began airing.  On a side note, I wonder how the relationship between Ezra and Sabine will work out? Ezra seems like another Anakin in the making..."
starwarsrebels,2s631g,NightFire19,-4,Mon Jan 12 23:12:27 2015 UTC,Ya.. he's just as whiny as Anakin and his son...
starwarsrebels,2s631g,oakley_fan,8,Mon Jan 12 23:29:09 2015 UTC,"I love this show, I count the days every week til a new episode, but this was probably the weakest ep yet, I feel they are trying to remind everyone we are in the star wars universe bc the characters are new, and they are trying too hard, we've had the droids, yoda, and now lando make cameos, which in my opinion are not really needed, why did lando need to be living on lothal?, why not have him just visiting, this was probably the 'kiddiest' ep yet, yes I know its a kids show, but c'mon."
starwarsrebels,2s631g,Galle_,4,Tue Jan 13 00:31:45 2015 UTC,"So, uh, were those Star Destroyers just completely unarmed? The CO ordered all ships to open fire, but only the TIEs actually did anything.  And I know this is going to sound blasphemous, but I think age is starting to get to Billy Dee Williams. Lando's voice was slurred in a way that made him sound a lot older than he was supposed to be.  Apart from those two things, it was a solid episode."
starwarsrebels,2s631g,jethroboom,1 point,Tue Jan 13 16:07:30 2015 UTC,"I actually came to the sub to say how disappointed I was in Lando's voice actor, I didn't realize until later that it was actually Billy himself.  Maybe Marc Thompson is just too good of a voice actor in all the Star Wars audio books I've been listening to lately that he's just a better Lando than Lando."
starwarsrebels,2s631g,Lurkndog,4,Tue Jan 20 13:39:40 2015 UTC,"Nice seeing Hera get out of the ship for part of an episode.   You wonder how much Lando knew about Hera going into the whole caper. (Hera is a good captain and a great pilot, but her real character class is Spy.)"
starwarsrebels,2s631g,tylarus23,4,Tue Jan 13 05:04:15 2015 UTC,"The only thing I really didn't like was when they made it past the blockade and they destroyed the two TIE Fighters, then they landed and everything was back to normal like nothing happened. If the empire is in orbit of Lothal and has units on the ground also, they shouldn't even feel remotely safe. That was just something that kind of bugged me, but other than that it was a pretty solid episode."
starwarsrebels,2s631g,matty25,3,Tue Jan 13 20:23:11 2015 UTC,"IMO, not as good as last weeks, but still enjoyable.  Some of the facial & character expressions seemed off."
starwarsrebels,2s631g,matty25,5,Mon Jan 12 14:56:50 2015 UTC,No it wasn't but last week's could end up being one of the series' best episodes.
starwarsrebels,2s631g,RogueLieutenant,3,Mon Jan 12 19:30:40 2015 UTC,Lando was a nice cameo. They revealed too much beforehand though so I knew he'd be in this episode.  It would have hit harder had it been more of a surprise.  I thought Ezra's lightsaber/blaster was pretty cool.
starwarsrebels,2s631g,matty25,4,Mon Jan 12 19:32:48 2015 UTC,Still seemed like a non-lethal shot sort of deal which is interesting.
starwarsrebels,2s631g,Nihillo,7,Mon Jan 12 21:12:41 2015 UTC,Yeah true and def better than the slingshot.
starwarsrebels,2s631g,jethroboom,2,Mon Jan 12 21:38:04 2015 UTC,"I was slightly put-off by the stun blaster at first, but I guess it doesn't make a huge difference whether the opponents are dead or knocked out, they are out of the fight either way. So hey, at least Ezra has increased his fighting capability."
starwarsrebels,2s631g,nightmare901,4,Wed Jan 14 08:05:39 2015 UTC,It kinda makes sense if you think about it.  Disney probably doesn't want it's kid toons running around killing things.
starwarsrebels,2s631g,lamagawa,1 point,Mon Jan 12 23:30:14 2015 UTC,I for one was pleasantly surprised to see Lando.  Thanks to all the pre-airing discussions about episodes on this sub I was forced to unsubscribe.
starwarsrebels,2s631g,shukowski,3,Tue Jan 20 13:38:02 2015 UTC,"This episode was the equivalent of the astromech arc in TCW. Just WAY too goofy for me. I DID like seeing Ezra's blaster in action, though, and there was a good Master-Apprentice moment between him and Kanan. This episode felt a bit like wasted potential, especially when you consider that Lando owned the Millenium Falcon before Han."
starwarsrebels,2s631g,ryan_schlueter,6,Tue Jan 13 04:26:41 2015 UTC,Man this episode was a bit of a let-down.
starwarsrebels,2s631g,samlee405,2,Mon Jan 12 23:05:55 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's just coincidence, but all the worst episodes were written by Kevin Hopps. Fighter flight, Out of Darkness and Idiot's Array. Those are the episodes that gave very little to the overall story. It's just my opinion."
starwarsrebels,2s631g,BeardedAxeWound93,2,Tue Jan 13 13:26:55 2015 UTC,I thought it was pretty good. A little out of place to meet up with lando. But I thought it was great seeing him again.

starwarsrebels,2s02ej,joeyesposito,4,Sat Jan 10 22:04:26 2015 UTC,"That's really interesting.  I would like to see if any of that carries in to the upcoming sequels.  If not this new trilogy, Im sure we'll be getting PLENTY of Star Wars movies in the future.  I think that ""there is another"" line is still open enough where a future writer can twist things around and have Yoda be talking about somebody else or even a group of people.  I think the Ezra scene of the recent episode really sets it up that Yoda could have been thinking of him when he said it.    Also, I think you'll really love How Star Wars Conquered the Universe.  It goes through the whole growth of the franchise from Lucas developing the original idea, to the prequels, all the way through the Disney sale and beginnings of Ep 7.    I thought it was really fascinating stuff and went in to a lot of stories and details that I had never heard before.  It is also much more factual than most Star Wars history works, yet it still feels exciting as if it was written by a real fan."
starwarsrebels,2s02ej,blink5694,1 point,Sat Jan 10 22:35:29 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks! I'll have to check that out."
starwarsrebels,2s02ej,otherpeoplesmusic,3,Sat Jan 10 23:15:42 2015 UTC,"One thing that really works / supports the idea that they had a at least a loose story mapped out is in ANH is when someone says something about taking control of the senate. They had to have known how the Emperor took control of the entire galaxy, at least a little bit, for there to have even been a mention of it. There's a few other things that my tired mind can't recall at the moment, but others may chime in and recall?"
starwarsrebels,2s02ej,Jangwin,3,Sun Jan 11 15:00:51 2015 UTC,Obi-Wan mentions fighting in the Clone Wars with Luke's father.
starwarsrebels,2s02ej,otherpeoplesmusic,1 point,Sun Jan 11 16:10:02 2015 UTC,"Yes !   Even Darth Vader just wants Luke to join with him and overthrow the Emperor cause he knows he's messed up and in his mind, the only way to fix things is to 'rule the Galaxy as father and son'. They at least had him say things like 'If I was ruler...' or whatever in the prequels, exposing his fascist tendencies."
starwarsrebels,2s02ej,Thelonius16,3,Mon Jan 12 01:25:43 2015 UTC,The entire story of Palpatine seizing power is outlined in the first two pages of Alan Dean Foster's novelization. It's essentially the highlights of the political parts of Ep II and III. So that part of it has been around since before the movie came out.
starwarsrebels,2s02ej,Sapitoelgato,1 point,Mon Jan 12 12:37:42 2015 UTC,"Rebels isn't the only thing coming out that will plant the seeds for the future. We also have new comics coming out after A New Hope. I hope they incorporate the old comic characters, and bring in some new ones that are important in the sequel trilogy. I am excited to see what they do. We may yet get Jix and Rendar popping up in Rebels or the new comics and novels."
starwarsrebels,2s02ej,Thelonius16,1 point,Sat Jan 10 23:19:09 2015 UTC,"If he is the ""other,"" maybe he dies between Empire and Jedi. Or maybe his training stops at some point once Yoda realizes that farm boy he's been watching actually has more potential."
starwarsrebels,2s02ej,Nihillo,3,Mon Jan 12 12:39:28 2015 UTC,"Luke always had more potential, though, he's the son of ""the Chosen One"" and all that jazz, so it makes sense that they would look to him as their greatest weapon against darkness.  There's nothing stopping Ezra and Kanan from still existing alongside the characters from the original trilogy, they don't have to die or pull an Ahsoka. We had plenty of other Jedi hiding from the Empire in the previous canon, and most of them were not factored in when it came to the whole ""who is going to take down the Empire"" thing, they were just useful allies."
starwarsrebels,2s02ej,RealVoltar,1 point,Wed Jan 14 07:47:22 2015 UTC,It definitely could be retconned into that though I'd expect more of that to happen in E7 and not Rebels.
starwarsrebels,2rwcq6,robotafterall,22,Fri Jan 9 21:24:56 2015 UTC,"I watch every week with my siblings who are 15, 13, and 10. When Ezra went into the cave my 10-year-old sister said ""This is just like when Luke is in the swamp with Darth Vader, right?"" and I had a very proud brother moment. Anyway, thought this episode was pretty solid. I very much enjoyed Yoda speaking with Kanan and Ezra, pruning them both. And then Ezra building his lightsaber. Probably my favorite episode so far"
starwarsrebels,2rwcq6,ChiSoxBoy,9,Sat Jan 10 00:49:49 2015 UTC,"If you haven't read ""A New Dawn"", it covers a lot of what Kanan did when he was talking about his past with Yoda, and it also covers the part where the inquisitor says, spoiler tag"
starwarsrebels,2rwcq6,FrankiePoops,14,Fri Jan 9 21:56:27 2015 UTC,"When does the Inquisitor say ""spoiler tag?"""
starwarsrebels,2rwcq6,TripleChimp,2,Fri Jan 9 23:37:34 2015 UTC,"How is that book? I've been thinking about picking it up. On a scale of ""Splinter of Minds Eye"" to ""Shadows of the Empire,"" where does it fall?"
starwarsrebels,2rwcq6,d0r13n,8,Fri Jan 9 22:36:47 2015 UTC,"I'd say its above Mandalorian Armor but below Rogue Squadron.   Exciting quick read, I'm about 3/4 of the way through right now. It gives a lot more personality to Kanan and Hera might be my favorite chracter of the Ghost crew now.   Bad guy is a little one dimensional, but not too terribly so."
starwarsrebels,2rwcq6,FrankiePoops,1 point,Fri Jan 9 22:45:14 2015 UTC,I think I'll give it a shot then. Thanks for the review!
starwarsrebels,2rwcq6,d0r13n,3,Fri Jan 9 22:47:11 2015 UTC,"The book is great, and very action oriented. Miller paints some interesting characters that are only in the novel. The book paints Kanan in a great way, so you get to know him better, with out going into too much back story (the new Kanan comic coming out this year will). I will have to spoil this ahead of time that the chemistry between him and Hera is rather conflicting to some readers. I felt it was pulled off rather well, and in the Rebels show you realize they don't have the luxury of exploring that path.   The overall story doesn't have that much impact with the overall scheme of things, but is a fun read into how Kanan and Hera meet.  PS I really enjoyed the prologue, which is heightened, when you watch the show."

starwarsrebels,2rwcq6,FrankiePoops,1 point,Sun Jan 11 05:25:16 2015 UTC,"I usually use this as my answer: If you plan on watching all of Rebels, you should read it.  It gives depth to Kanan's character to a level that Rebels isn't able to reach yet and explains some plot points that could possibly come back later on.    However if you are not devoted to Rebels it might not be as driving because you aren't planning on following this character in the future.  Considering you're on this sub I would probably say you would enjoy it."
starwarsrebels,2rwcq6,blink5694,1 point,Sun Jan 11 14:43:29 2015 UTC,"Plan on picking the book up today. The daughter and I just marathoned through the whole series to date for at least the third time, so I'd say were devoted!"
starwarsrebels,2rwcq6,d0r13n,2,Sat Jan 10 22:38:15 2015 UTC,"I loved this episode, watched with my son last night and we just sat there quiet. Tells me how good it was. Of course I realized what was going on with Ezra seeing those he saw (trying not to spoil), but my son didn't and I could tell he was trying to figure out exactly what was happening. He did, and suddenly yelled ""YES!"" when he got it."
starwarsrebels,2rwcq6,paradiselost79,3,Sun Jan 11 00:14:20 2015 UTC,"Rewatched it today. The reaction Kanan has to Yoda is still a little off for me, but everything is was stellar! I can't wait to see Sabine's and Ezra's project at the end of the season. They handled the dark parts well, with out going to far. If it was not all ages, they could have made the cave sequence very dark.   I would add this episode to my must watch list. I hope they keep up the momentum."
starwarsrebels,2rwcq6,Sapitoelgato,2,Fri Jan 9 21:53:20 2015 UTC,I still think the temple dark scenes would probably be terrifying for a small child.
starwarsrebels,2rwcq6,FrankiePoops,2,Fri Jan 9 21:35:28 2015 UTC,My son is 7 and loved it
starwarsrebels,2rwcq6,paradiselost79,3,Fri Jan 9 22:47:41 2015 UTC,"We did have one. I just botched the title and labeled it wrong.

starwarsrebels,2rrlac,Sapitoelgato,4,Thu Jan 8 18:57:48 2015 UTC,There is a lot of trivia at the main website. I always check it out each episode.
starwarsrebels,2rrlac,JabbaJohnL,5,Thu Jan 8 19:04:46 2015 UTC,Yea. I just discovered that a few days ago. Really neat stuff between that and Rebels Recon.
starwarsrebels,2rrlac,Sapitoelgato,6,Thu Jan 8 19:37:54 2015 UTC,"It was actually concept art for a Rebel planet called Sicemon that appeared in the early drafts of Return of the Jedi.  The book called The Illustrated Star Wars Universe repurposed the artwork as Alderaan.  The depiction of the planet Maridun in The Clone Wars takes some cues from this artwork, but you're correct that Rebels more directly uses the artwork as Lothal."
starwarsrebels,2rrlac,JabbaJohnL,2,Fri Jan 9 00:19:12 2015 UTC,Interesting. I never have owned any of the illustrated books or reference guides.
starwarsrebels,2rr74z,OzShadow,3,Thu Jan 8 16:30:53 2015 UTC,This works almost too well with the scene.
starwarsrebels,2rr74z,BrickMacklin,4,Thu Jan 8 17:18:23 2015 UTC,I guess I'm not the only one that keeps comparing Aladdin to Ezra. They even look similar. Someone photoshop a little moroccan hat on him.
starwarsrebels,2rr74z,FrankiePoops,7,Thu Jan 8 17:23:30 2015 UTC,"They're not even trying to hide it how. Kanan dropped the line ""He can be taught"" in the last episode."
starwarsrebels,2rr74z,styxtraveler,6,Thu Jan 8 20:23:09 2015 UTC,And Kanan's got the beard.   And I always thought sabine looked asian or hispanic. Middle eastern could work too.   Dear Lord. I hate fucking Abu Chopper.
starwarsrebels,2rr74z,FrankiePoops,2,Thu Jan 8 20:26:01 2015 UTC,That was hilarious. People gotta find a reason to hate on everything these days. I'm not denying the resemblance but a few people I've talked to say that's one of the reasons they don't like the show.
starwarsrebels,2rr74z,rpd123,4,Fri Jan 9 07:23:39 2015 UTC,"To me, the idea of disliking a story because it resembles an existing story seems so strange. We humans have been recycling stories since we began telling them. I guess I like finding the little connections between stories. They kind of work as a reminder that all stories are about the same thing — humanity.  That being said, I will never again see Chopper as simply Chopper. Now he will also be Abu."
