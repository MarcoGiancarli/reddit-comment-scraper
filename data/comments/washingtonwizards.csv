washingtonwizards,3e4st8,devilknight,6,Tue Jul 21 23:24:50 2015 UTC,"Martell had the same damn surgery this time last summer and he was basically worthless all year. I know you can't compare the two as players respond differently, but this basically sucks, no other way to put it. All we can do is cross our fingers that he has much better luck recovering than Webster did."
washingtonwizards,3e4st8,LooseCannon13,4,Tue Jul 21 23:52:49 2015 UTC,"Well he was hurt in LAC and Jorge Castillo said ""Wizards knew that Dudley played through pain last season and surgery was likely. He underwent the procedure in Dallas.""  Most likely why they got him so cheap."
washingtonwizards,3e4st8,oglefro,7,Tue Jul 21 23:30:40 2015 UTC,Why keep your fans in the dark until he's already had surgery?
washingtonwizards,3e4st8,first_time-long_time,4,Tue Jul 21 23:37:33 2015 UTC,That's my thought they shoulda dropped that with the acquisition of him. Or scheduled the surgery right after they got him or as close as possible.  We are thinking he's contributing from day one and he's actually out 3-4 months...   So best case he's back in middle October  Worst case he's in late November early December. Not awful but sneaky they shoulda informed us.
washingtonwizards,3e4st8,oglefro,2,Tue Jul 21 23:52:59 2015 UTC,"Sorry boys but back surgeries take a long time to recover from.Ask Martell Webster...now we have to hope Martell can step in and be fully recovered, and Oubre really progresses.   Martell started to look more free and easy last few regular season games when Randy was sitting all the regulars.  Damn, this is tough news."
washingtonwizards,3e4st8,DCsportsJohnny,2,Wed Jul 22 01:14:22 2015 UTC,Martells had three surgeries so that's a bit different.   I don't expect him to contribute much at all next season... If he hits a certain number of games played his money gets guaranteed. I'd ship him back to Portland with the receipt and a pick.   And since Dudley has played hurt he last couple of seasons you have to wonder if that wears on him.
washingtonwizards,3e4st8,oglefro,2,Wed Jul 22 02:22:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah i think that's why Martell took so long to recover this time.I like him.  2 yrs ago he was one of 4 guys to hit  100 threes for us, with this news, I'm really hoping he can come back."

One of the last highschool to NBA players, was over drafted but if you ask Portland fans he did some AMAZING things for the community.  As a person, I am a huge fan of him. But on a basketball level we have so many wings I'm indifferent with him.   If he is productive this year we won't complain about his contract as much. I don't know how much he has left in the tank/if he can get another NBA contract after this.  Also I think he has some music on YouTube lol."

washingtonwizards,3e2vc2,WizOfAwesSite,7,Tue Jul 21 15:16:10 2015 UTC,"Although losing Pierce hurts for this coming season, I think it will actually allow the team to develop better in the long term. We weren't going to win a title this season anyway, but now John will be able to emerge more as the team's leader, Brad will get a chance to take the big shots (while John is the alpha of the team, for end of game shots I'd put the ball in his hands and tell him to look for Brad), and Otto will (hopefully) get the starting job and continue to develop his game.   With these three, the Wiz have a very good young core that'll continue to improve for the next 4-5 years, and already have about 20 games of playoff experience. I see this team peaking in 3 years, after we add at least one big name FA and some quality depth guys, with Gortat still under contract. The next couple years are about our young core improving, achieving as much playoff success as we can to attract quality FAs, and building a motivated, dedicated fan base."
washingtonwizards,3e2vc2,Zorodude77,4,Tue Jul 21 16:25:59 2015 UTC,Maybe I'm crazy but it seemed like Wall was the leader last year.  It's nice to have a vet like Pierce around but this has been John Wall's team.
washingtonwizards,3e2vc2,malekai101,3,Tue Jul 21 21:17:55 2015 UTC,I agree. A few impressive games in the playoffs have made people forget how lackluster he was for the regular season. I would've loved for him to come back this season for needed depth as long as he was coming off the bench for Otto (though Ernie impressed with Dudley and Alan Anderson so we don't really need Pierce that much anymore). In Otto we trust.

washingtonwizards,3dybgn,WizOfAwesSite,19,Mon Jul 20 15:07:07 2015 UTC,"He better be starting.  For what the Wizards expected him to give in value during the playoffs, the return was fantastic.    Also, doesn't it allow more flexibility with the lineup if Dudley comes off the bench to be the backup 3 and 4?"
washingtonwizards,3dybgn,tiweav01,11,Mon Jul 20 15:22:44 2015 UTC,"In his interview with Amin Elhassan, Tommy Sheppard said that Alan Anderson and Gary Neal were valuable because of their ability to be spot starters which implies they're gonna come off the bench ordinarily. He also said the starting 3 spot would be decided in training camp. Dudley's said he expects to come off the bench so it's basically Otto's job to lose, I guess.  Sheppard also reiterated that the Wiz are gonna play a lot more smallball (yay!) and that Drew Gooden is going to play a lot more (I'll give it a chance before I make a judgment). He also hinted at how the Wizards track players' health and performance on a daily basis and manage their playing time and practice time accordingly. He expects Wall to get more rest and play a little less next season as Ramon Sessions gets better-integrated into the team. It's all words until they're put into practice but it's nice to see the team even talking about being progressive in specific ways given their reputation."
washingtonwizards,3dybgn,SonOfSkipBaeless,2,Mon Jul 20 17:07:23 2015 UTC,"Me,I'd  start Humphries,who plays and spaces well w Gortat,Wall,Otto and beal.Also gives a great rebounding starting 5. send Drew out w Nene, D. Bradley,Sessions and some combo of time split of beal/neal..spread floor. Work Oubre and anderson as permitted.

washingtonwizards,3dybgn,DCsportsJohnny,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:35:37 2015 UTC,"I really like the idea of keeping health as a major priority and sitting Wall more often. The latter is incredibly important since we plan on keeping Wall here long term. We don't want him to start breaking down near his 30s from overuse, so it's important to limit his minutes just a little more now."

washingtonwizards,3dybgn,Mehberry,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:00:29 2015 UTC,"I think he starts, but who leads the second unit? The Wizards are looking to have a very weak bench come start of the season, and if they want to make a big run in the playoffs, they're going to need a deeper bench."
washingtonwizards,3dybgn,Source_Wiki,2,Mon Jul 20 16:38:24 2015 UTC,"If he doesn't start, I think Dudley could be the leader on the 2nd unit. Nene at the 5 could be effective as well off the bench if he stays motivated, I think he's better there than the 4. The way I see it, assuming Otto starts the lineup is either gonna be Wall/Beal/Porter/Humphries/Gortat, or the same with Dudley for Humphries. That gives us 1 of Humph/Dudley, Nene, Anderson, Sessions, and Neal as our bench rotation. I'm interested to see how much time Dudley gets at the 4, if he's a regular there we should have a solid rotation. If not I'd really like us to get another 4."

Apparently he's been in the gym every night putting up shot after shot, and it's starting to pay off.   He can get minutes in this level for sure. All he has to do is keep working on that shot, because John will find him. And Oubre is showing that he's got a good motor on defense, and that's something a lot of young guys struggle with. For now all we need him to be is a 3&D guy but he's showing that he's got potential to be even more. Count me in the excited group!"

washingtonwizards,3dkiag,danial133416,3,Sat Jul 18 01:45:17 2015 UTC,Brad is a great interviewer. Meanwhile Our team is playing so poorly.
washingtonwizards,3dkiag,jeffsays,3,Fri Jul 17 00:30:19 2015 UTC,Brads so well spoken and humble...  Love that dude.
washingtonwizards,3dkiag,jeffsays,3,Fri Jul 17 00:31:33 2015 UTC,"I am so tired of hearing the name ""curry"""
washingtonwizards,3dkiag,speedway208,5,Fri Jul 17 00:32:46 2015 UTC,He's gonna drop 40 on us
washingtonwizards,3dkytr,oglefro,3,Fri Jul 17 02:54:12 2015 UTC,Nuggets it is. See you guys tonight! I'll be throwing up a game thread on /r/NBA an hour before tip off like usual.
washingtonwizards,3dkytr,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Fri Jul 17 17:59:12 2015 UTC,Whoops I meant the loser   We are in the consolation bracket...  Did you guys win or lose to the hawks?!?
washingtonwizards,3dkytr,IdRatherBeLurking,3,Fri Jul 17 18:05:32 2015 UTC,We lost :(
washingtonwizards,3dkytr,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Fri Jul 17 18:10:24 2015 UTC,"good news is... You have a good chance of winning because we only have one good low post defender!  And he has been hurt or something because his mins got slashed last game...  Alex Len of the suns killed us, Nurk should have a good game.  But ill be in the thread! its been kinda lonely in our subs game threads lol"

washingtonwizards,3dk4mw,DanielSnydersRedSkin,2,Thu Jul 16 22:33:56 2015 UTC,not yet why
washingtonwizards,3dk4mw,aIIivant,3,Fri Jul 17 03:46:09 2015 UTC,"Just curious if anyone has had any luck/pointers for the system. My friend and I have had tickets for a while, but the only thing we've ever cashed in on was a hat and a t-shirt. Seems like the auctions go through the roof on points, the memorabilia is the same framed photo they give out as a season-ticket holder gift, and it's a little stale. I know they're doing a re-design so I wanted to see if anyone heard any rumors about improvements, or advice on tricks to find some interesting stuff."
washingtonwizards,3dk4mw,DCsportsJohnny,3,Fri Jul 17 18:32:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah..it's  all kind of bullshit.They have a nice feature where for 10,000 pts for 2 people,you get the VIP room for a selected game..nice party room at a corner entrance to court.(notable by red carpeting into it..have to have wristband).  .free food and drink..decent beer,wine,occassional liquors ,serve yourself good food,plus we have usually been able to ""sneak"" into seats behind basket. While they run out of these on Monument rewards sites soon  ,last two years our rep got us a VIP game each year.  Most of the stuff in Monumental rewards is crap though..We also get tshirts.etc.  In fact,to me,it seems like since the winning,Teddy has gotten cheaper and cheaper.We go to all the fan stuff they offer..used to have LOTS of great nites..meet players,execs,Ted his own self(stopped after fans grilled him unmercifully one nite).Met execs from all 4 teams(Wiz.Caps,Nats.Skins..assistants to GMs) for a great round robin.  Not ONE night like that this year.Little stuff,but annoying.For instance..At first playoff games in Toronto and Atlanta..T shirts for  everybody..Second games and on..nothing,nada,zip.  I have to agree with our rep..I'd  rather have the contending teams,but still.Our seats..upper deck 401 section,have gone up 55% last two years..40% this year..they can certainly afford a few amenities,especially to their core, i'd think."
washingtonwizards,3dk4mw,aIIivant,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:27:59 2015 UTC,ah i failed to realize you were talking about rewards.  i just logged in to my account thinking they redid the general account.  i think that is lacking a little.  i've only had tickets since last dec.  stokked for this upcoming season though.
washingtonwizards,3dk4mw,Mehberry,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:40:43 2015 UTC,"Agreed, they have never had a strong on-line system. Hopefully they can get stuff punched up a bit sometime soon.  Can't wait for this season. Some of those below-the-radar moves (Anderson, Neal) could really make a big difference, especially if Wittman can get into the stretch-4 system that worked in the playoffs."
washingtonwizards,3dk4mw,aIIivant,2,Fri Jul 17 18:51:31 2015 UTC,"It's been awful for the past few years. the gear is all old and bad. The shirts are usually available only in XL and up, if that."
washingtonwizards,3di6ms,LooseCannon13,6,Thu Jul 16 13:53:44 2015 UTC,Scott Machado isn't a NBA caliber PG unfortunately.
washingtonwizards,3di6ms,Gr8WallofChinatown,6,Thu Jul 16 16:21:44 2015 UTC,"Possibly. But then again, we do have Garrett Temple on our roster."
washingtonwizards,3di6ms,DCsportsJohnny,2,Thu Jul 16 17:38:25 2015 UTC,"Garrett Temple..rhe prime example of finding a coach who loves you,and hanging on.On the plus side..no tats,no drugs or nite life."
washingtonwizards,3di6ms,DCsportsJohnny,2,Thu Jul 16 21:18:26 2015 UTC,I think Gary Neal can also handle the ball a little as well.Why did we ever ket Shaun Livingston(for nothing) and Kirk Hinrich ( for Jordan Crawford) go?
washingtonwizards,3di6ms,DanielSnydersRedSkin,2,Thu Jul 16 21:20:12 2015 UTC,"Wasn't the Hinrich move a salary dump? They cut Bibby and had Mo Evans come off the books, then had the extra cash to try to rebuild around Wall (Nene, Okafor). I think they looked at Crawford as a better off-the-ball scorer next to Wall than Hinrich. Ugh. Those were some thin times for us. Painful to watch."
washingtonwizards,3di6ms,DCsportsJohnny,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:10:08 2015 UTC,"You might be right.I just remember  Wizards made big deal about having Kirk here to help mentor  Wall,then dealing him 3/4 of the way though season. I am a season tix holder last 20 years,Wiz have us out before season starts every year to Six Flags park,meet the players,autographs,photo ops  (crappy food every year)run of the park.  Met Hinrich,hardly anyone at his table,got to talk to him a while,nice guy...really dissapointed in that deal,especially when Crawford turned out to be an asshole.With all the dissapointing backup point guards we've  had(Mack,A J Price,Butler,etc.) the ones I loved..Livingston,Hinrich,Miller..we trade away."
washingtonwizards,3di6ms,DanielSnydersRedSkin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:15:15 2015 UTC,"That's awesome. My buddy and I are on year 10, so congrats on 20! That's some dedication considering the teams they put out there for a few years (Michael Ruffin...really?!?) We haven't made it out to the meet and greet yet-the schedule never seems to work out right.  I agree with you 100% on the guards. Hinrich was solid. Always seemed like a total professional. I know Wall turned out as a good guy, but I can only imagine if he had a few more years learning from Hinrich (who oddly enough for a guy that still starts seemed to enjoy the mentor role). And the string of failures we've had at that position. Sigh..."
washingtonwizards,3di6ms,DCsportsJohnny,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:37:06 2015 UTC,"Remember that in those 20 years was Webber teams ,& last game at Cap Ctr/U S Air(jordan bulls playoff loss) TWO years of Michael Jordan and packed houses every night. Gilbert 4 year playoffs,and now,what is becoming my favorite group of all.If Durant comes,I'll be in Wizard heaven."
washingtonwizards,3di6ms,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,2,Sun Jul 19 23:12:52 2015 UTC,They'll both get invites to training camp is my guess
washingtonwizards,3di6ms,DanielSnydersRedSkin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:15:16 2015 UTC,"I could see them stashing them in the D league for a bit in case Temple or Sessions get hurt. Took Bynum a little time last year, but with their up and down offense, a guard can come in and make a little splash."
washingtonwizards,3di6ms,m25l,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:20:10 2015 UTC,Sessions is better than Machado
washingtonwizards,3di5kl,baobao3,2,Thu Jul 16 13:44:49 2015 UTC,Wrong link. Here's the right one. http://www.bulletsforever.com/2015/7/15/8975709/washington-wizards-utah-jazz-final-score-2015-nba-summer-league
washingtonwizards,3dg8fr,baseddogpatrick,19,Thu Jul 16 00:56:39 2015 UTC,lol from what I saw on a quick scan none of those guys said Reggie > John. If I was a Pistons fan I wouldn't like what Wall said either. It's nbd.  Makes me wonder what Wall would do an on a SVG team though. Reggie wouldn't be getting 19 and 10 with two big lugs camped in the lane and his snipers stepping into 19-footers.
washingtonwizards,3dg8fr,SonOfSkipBaeless,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:20:05 2015 UTC,"Half the comments are implying they're equal. They're acting like LeBron said Kevin Durant didn't deserve a max contract or something.   The other half are reasonable and know what Wall meant but still, comments like this are just really poorly thought out."
washingtonwizards,3dg8fr,happyflappypancakes,11,Thu Jul 16 01:24:30 2015 UTC,"Come on mean, don't do this. Like maybe 1 in 20 Pistons fans alluded to Wall and Reggie being equals, but you sound incredibly reactionary. Who cares what anyone else says?"
washingtonwizards,3dg8fr,DogeyDogeDoge,-6,Thu Jul 16 05:12:55 2015 UTC,Reggie played with Monroe and Drummond the majority of the time...
washingtonwizards,3dg8fr,SonOfSkipBaeless,12,Thu Jul 16 03:36:12 2015 UTC,"279 min with both  409 min with Drummond, no Monroe  119 min with Monroe, no Drummond  69 min with neither  Per NBAWowy"
washingtonwizards,3dg8fr,DogeyDogeDoge,-1,Thu Jul 16 03:53:01 2015 UTC,"Monroe was out with injuries for a little IIRC. When he was available, Reggie was playing alongside the two predominantly."
washingtonwizards,3dg8fr,happyflappypancakes,7,Thu Jul 16 04:07:46 2015 UTC,"I mean, no, he literally dissected the minutes. He predominately played with Drummond and not Monroe."
washingtonwizards,3dg8fr,DogeyDogeDoge,-1,Thu Jul 16 05:14:05 2015 UTC,"I realize that. However I'm saying that when Monroe was available (not injured), Reggie played alongside him and Drummond the majority of the time."
washingtonwizards,3dg8fr,devotedhero,2,Thu Jul 16 05:31:36 2015 UTC,"....and the minutes say no, you're wrong"
washingtonwizards,3dg8fr,DogeyDogeDoge,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:53:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not wrong. These minutes are counted when Monroe was out and not available to play. When Monroe was healthy, Reggie played with him and Drummond the most. You should consider comprehending before saying, ""you're wrong."""
washingtonwizards,3dg8fr,devotedhero,2,Thu Jul 16 21:19:44 2015 UTC,"but that's irrelevant, since clearly it didn't happen all to much in the first place. it doesn't matter if he was supposed to play with monroe and drummond a lot, since he didn't all that often"
washingtonwizards,3dg8fr,DogeyDogeDoge,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:30:58 2015 UTC,"It's not irrelevant whatsoever. He only played 130 fewer minutes with both than with Drummond and no Monroe. That doesn't take into account the fact that Monroe missed 11 games. If you eliminate the games in which Monroe was injured, the minutes Reggie played with Drummond and no Monroe would decrease dramatically."
washingtonwizards,3dg8fr,BagelsAndJewce,8,Thu Jul 16 22:03:53 2015 UTC,"The best comment is the last one that compares their stats for last year, because quick generic stats mean everything."
washingtonwizards,3dg8fr,oglefro,2,Thu Jul 16 00:57:18 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that if you look at it lots of guards end up with those types of stats but only 16 go to the playoffs and only one wins.
washingtonwizards,3dg8fr,DCsportsJohnny,2,Thu Jul 16 08:32:55 2015 UTC,Yo it's a dry month in Oklahoma...  If you could have them ship what they are smoking down here THATD BE GREAAAT

washingtonwizards,3dg8fr,oglefro,3,Thu Jul 16 07:02:16 2015 UTC,Its a joke. Oglefro is from oklahoma and he thinks they are all high as fuck. Since oklahoma is dry he wants what they are smoking.
washingtonwizards,3dg8fr,Hurm4,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:36:33 2015 UTC,Thanks man! Good looking out.
washingtonwizards,3dg8fr,DaBear405,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:29:10 2015 UTC,"Wall didnt even say anything inflammatory - he stated a fact. I see a lot of people using what Jackson did at the end of the season as justification for the contract - but we know all about players finishing season on a high note and getting paid based on it. Looking at you, Mr. Baltche."
washingtonwizards,3dg8fr,Boymankid,-8,Thu Jul 16 19:27:11 2015 UTC,Wall is clearly better than Reggie but putting JW as a top 2 or 3 PG?? Seriously?   EDIT: Downvote me for saying this? Fucking homers
washingtonwizards,3dg8fr,peterkimmm,4,Thu Jul 16 07:02:55 2015 UTC,"Paul, Curry, Westbrook, Wall"
washingtonwizards,3dg8fr,DCsportsJohnny,3,Thu Jul 16 13:58:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they would be my choice of Top 4 as well, in no particular order.          Everyone can reason and argue all they want, but I just can't seem to pinpoint and say who is the #1 PG, so I just always say these 4 mentioned PGS and note ""in no particular order"" haha.            But I don't think John Wall would be in top 2. Top would be in between Curry and CP3"
washingtonwizards,3dg8fr,investmentfreak,3,Thu Jul 16 18:24:47 2015 UTC,"LeBron, Kyrie, Wall are the top three players in the East."
washingtonwizards,3dg8fr,deadxcloud,6,Thu Jul 16 07:04:45 2015 UTC,"Please get Kyrie off that list.He's  a volume shooter,that's  it."
washingtonwizards,3dg8fr,DaBear405,2,Thu Jul 16 19:27:18 2015 UTC,"Best three players in the east might as well be Lebron, Lebron, and Lebron because he's so far ahead of anyone else in the east.  But Wall is definitely in the top 3"
washingtonwizards,3dg8fr,siekooc,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:00:23 2015 UTC,Melo and Paul George as well? And Wade over Kyrie.
washingtonwizards,3dg8fr,Hurm4,-1,Wed Jul 22 00:28:13 2015 UTC,"Oh in the east, that makes sense. But what about Chris Bosh? He is one of the best power forwards in the game."
washingtonwizards,3dg8fr,kamikazemelonman,3,Thu Jul 16 07:07:42 2015 UTC,is he playing next season?
washingtonwizards,3dg0eu,philhui,4,Wed Jul 15 23:50:57 2015 UTC,Finally it's starting. sort of.
washingtonwizards,3dg0eu,jeffsays,3,Thu Jul 16 00:17:09 2015 UTC,They were yelling to go under that screen...  Kelly oubre making em pay for disrespecting him.
washingtonwizards,3dg0eu,oglefro,3,Thu Jul 16 00:20:55 2015 UTC,so disrespectful.
washingtonwizards,3dg0eu,jeffsays,3,Thu Jul 16 00:22:16 2015 UTC,Oubre's defense is great! Needs to finish a bit stronger on that dunk though
washingtonwizards,3dg0eu,jeffsays,3,Thu Jul 16 00:30:58 2015 UTC,"Wall covering his mouth while he talks to his boy, not suspicious at all lmao"
washingtonwizards,3dg0eu,SonOfSkipBaeless,2,Thu Jul 16 00:35:24 2015 UTC,Protesting the media editorializing his Reggie Jackson comments?
washingtonwizards,3dg0eu,bhotep,3,Thu Jul 16 01:58:47 2015 UTC,Why is Toure Murray not playing? He was the person I thought looked so familar but I could not place him.
washingtonwizards,3dg0eu,oglefro,3,Thu Jul 16 00:48:25 2015 UTC,I think he's injured? It's odd because he was actually on the Wizards roster last year for 10 days
washingtonwizards,3dg0eu,jeffsays,3,Thu Jul 16 00:56:09 2015 UTC,yeah then he got hurt and then we ended up with Will Bynum...  Because he was on the roster.
washingtonwizards,3dg0eu,oglefro,3,Thu Jul 16 01:15:52 2015 UTC,"Ugh, don't remind me."
washingtonwizards,3dg0eu,jeffsays,3,Thu Jul 16 01:20:21 2015 UTC,At least he made those free throws that one time in the playoffs.  Staying positive m8
washingtonwizards,3dg0eu,oglefro,3,Thu Jul 16 01:22:21 2015 UTC,"God damn, orlando Johnson's life story is heartbreaking"
washingtonwizards,3dg0eu,jeffsays,3,Thu Jul 16 01:44:53 2015 UTC,Machado is another Brazilian...  We could use some more of them in the league...  Also leandro barbosas wife is hot.  Saw her at the warriors summer league game
washingtonwizards,3dg0eu,oglefro,2,Thu Jul 16 01:58:01 2015 UTC,OOoooouuuuubbbbreeeeewe
washingtonwizards,3dg0eu,jeffsays,2,Thu Jul 16 00:20:17 2015 UTC,Oubre's not ready for that catch and shoot 3.
washingtonwizards,3dg0eu,jeffsays,2,Thu Jul 16 00:25:27 2015 UTC,I think he got to hyped after that make :| kinda rushed that shot a bit.
washingtonwizards,3dg0eu,oglefro,3,Thu Jul 16 00:26:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, he could have gotten set before letting it fly. Same exact play too."
washingtonwizards,3dg0eu,jeffsays,2,Thu Jul 16 00:27:15 2015 UTC,I like that defense ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
washingtonwizards,3dg0eu,oglefro,2,Thu Jul 16 00:31:33 2015 UTC,Oubre's looking to crash the offensive glass which is nice to see.
washingtonwizards,3dg0eu,jeffsays,2,Thu Jul 16 00:33:05 2015 UTC,THE GOAT AARON WHITE
washingtonwizards,3dg0eu,jeffsays,2,Thu Jul 16 00:35:07 2015 UTC,"Damn, poor White, first shot blocked."

washingtonwizards,3de0o9,Gr8WallofChinatown,8,Wed Jul 15 15:14:06 2015 UTC,"I like the idea, but the question is, are we ok paying Ty Lawson 12 mil (13 mil next year), with the possibility of him not being able to play? Carrying that extra 13 mil next year may deter our chances of going for some big free agents (KD im talkin bout you, come back home).  Edit: one thing to note, since this is Ty Lawson's 2nd DUI, will the NBA allow him to be waived without any cap hits (aka not owing him a thing) because he is suspended indefinitely or something? The NFL did this with the Raven's and Ray Rice. If this was allowed I'd go straight for it because it saves the Wiz 13 mill in cap space without losing a thing."
washingtonwizards,3de0o9,Source_Wiki,3,Wed Jul 15 15:24:24 2015 UTC,Yo the ravens still had to pay the garunteed part of Ray rices contract...  In the NFl Contracts are not guaranteed. only the signing bonuses are.   So it would be different where all money is guaranteed unless otherwise specified with NBA contracts.
washingtonwizards,3de0o9,oglefro,2,Wed Jul 15 19:09:53 2015 UTC,"oh didnt know, but i think Lawsons guarantee might be cheaper? (correct me if im wrong)"
washingtonwizards,3de0o9,Source_Wiki,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:41:26 2015 UTC,I believe Ray Rices guaranteed money was like 4.5 mil a year because he signed a 7 mil a year extension...  I think if another team signed him that money would be taken of the Ravens cap but they still have to pay him...  Check this out  It's saying they have a 9 mil cap hold from his salary this year. Only 22 mill of the 35 mil contract was guaranteed. And then Ravens had to pay a 1.35 settlement. So they paid like 24 mil ish of his contract   So almost the same as Lawson's 2 year lol But rices was 5 years

washingtonwizards,3de4gi,KGTHEKID,8,Wed Jul 15 15:42:35 2015 UTC,Well when you yell at the head coach you are going to have a bad time. Waste of talent to be honest.
washingtonwizards,3de4gi,wafflestoompa,2,Wed Jul 15 17:27:58 2015 UTC,"Another indictment of Randy..we needed shooters,but Rice was doomed after that. Nothing against Rasual Butler,but Rice was..younger,cheaper,more athletic,but mouthed off to Wittlessman..stupid on his part..my son tells me he also had issues in college..too bad..he could definitely have scored in this league."
washingtonwizards,3de4gi,DCsportsJohnny,7,Thu Jul 16 19:32:06 2015 UTC,"Great scorer, I'm sure he could get NBA time at least on a team like Philly if he had a reasonable attitude. Dude just is too arrogant and angry to play on a team."
washingtonwizards,3de4gi,FreshPrinceOfMD,3,Wed Jul 15 15:44:09 2015 UTC,"I thought it must be something with his attitude. Hopefully he gets his shit together, I really enjoy his offensive game."
washingtonwizards,3de4gi,ireddit270,2,Wed Jul 15 16:04:00 2015 UTC,"Also to add, he's not a bad defender at all. GR Jr is actually a very solid man defender and quite strong. All Wiz fans fully expected him to get minutes last season, possibly even over Otto.   I'm not gonna say he's star potential but there's no reason why the kid shouldn't be able to get minutes off the bench for some team. He has no one to blame but himself for his current situation.. Rice Jr has an extensive history of character 'red flags', starting even before he was in the NBA.   Glen was given every opportunity in life as well, not like he grew up in a hard situation. He's one of those spoiled kids who chooses to hang with a bad crowd and act 'tough' (ie he's an entitled jackass). Like said above, he's quite simply too dumb and arrogant to be a professional basketball player.. that's the only reason he's not an NBA player right now."
washingtonwizards,3de4gi,white_light-king,3,Wed Jul 15 19:23:15 2015 UTC,"So GRJ may or may not have a bad attitude.  But the Wizards are having a track record of not developing their marginal young players and keeping them confident, focused and happy in their role.  You could right the same post about quite a few young Wizards players from the last 10 years.  When you date a girl who has complaints about the attitude of the last 10 guys they dated, one wonders where the real problem is."
washingtonwizards,3de4gi,Avoid_blisters,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:18:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the real problem lies in drafting immature head cases. The Wizards are not obligated to find a role for the first-year guy who freaked out at Wittman in front of people and cameras. That's the exact type of player we should be avoiding."
washingtonwizards,3de4gi,white_light-king,2,Thu Jul 16 14:45:31 2015 UTC,"Well either avoid them, trade them, or have a plan to do some ""surrogate parenting"" as a coach/boss.  I feel like the current Wizards pattern of handling problematic personalities (Blatche, Javaris Crittendon, Crawford, and now GRJ) is just to let the problem simmer until the pot boils over.    I'd really like to see the organization learn from it's behavior here and make different choices.  Lots of people are knuckleheads in their early 20s so the Wizards have the chance to re-create this problem almost every year."
washingtonwizards,3de4gi,DCsportsJohnny,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:27:33 2015 UTC,"So So  right..one of my favorite  things about last two years of Wiz teams was lack of knuckleheads.Give Ernie some credit here.On  previous sub,folks clamoring to get DeMarcus Cousins..God no.  ,  Hoping Oubre,who apparently had some issues at Kansas straightens up. Watched a few summer games.he seemed in control,tho what can you really tell from those scrimmages?"
washingtonwizards,3de4gi,white_light-king,2,Thu Jul 16 19:36:38 2015 UTC,"last two years of Wiz   Jordan Crawford and GRJ were our knuckleheads the last two years so the Wizards can't say this problem is behind them yet.  (And Glen Rice Jr. had a great summer league)  I believe Oubre's real test will be when he's on the bench and makes mistakes in games.  How does he deal with it, how does the coach communicate what it'll take for Oubre to get more minutes?  Does he get discouraged or does the organization have a vision for him that he can buy into and work towards?  What assistant coach or veteran helps him become better?"
washingtonwizards,3de4gi,DCsportsJohnny,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:31:48 2015 UTC,"We really missed Sam Cassell,Pierce took up some if that slack as well,Nene also gives a calmer head,but Randy and his doghouse,I believe,hurt these guys.  Crawford was gone by 2013,banished to Boston for the gay Collins twin,GRJ almost no time at all in 2014-15,when we had such dry spells_ God.remember the back to backs in Minnesota and Philly,when we scored under 80 both games?. We really do need a bright offensive mind on the bench,someone to coordinate the wing players,and also defray Randy a little.  How come Thibideau doesn't have a job yet?"

Except none of those players have had successful basketball careers since leaving the Wiz. One is even in jail for murder and the rest will be in China by next year. The Wizards were not holding those players back.   The key is to not draft red flag players in the first place. We got burned with GR Jr, but over the past few years the team has been acquiring high character players for the most part."

I don't know why but Randy must've had a reason to not think he had the goods to be a rotation player for us. I don't usually agree with Witts but I also don't think Rice had a place on our team.

washingtonwizards,3dcdwj,nihilistcommunist,10,Wed Jul 15 04:16:39 2015 UTC,"Not to be a super hardcore KO apologist but... We drafted him knowing that he was a project. BUT! As a two way player!  It could be worse. Celtics fans are fretting because James young who was their project picked 17th overall is not playing well.   When oubre shoots bad at lest we know  A. He is hustling hard  B. His defense is still there. Long arms, actually trying. (Working on the D IQ) C. We don't need him to start tomorrow. We have guys in front of him, there's zero pressure for him to HAVE to develop into the rookie of the year by the start of the season.  He has not shot well, but he called his personal trainer to practice on his shot on Sunday night! Which means he has a passion for the game, he wants to get better! He has a drive!  He didint take that pay check and go out and party/ eat some Bon bons with his homies.  He wants to get better and be a good basketball player. Ask a Celtic fan about how they think James young is doing...  It'll make you feel better about KO I promise lol.  Also they drafted rozier. (Not to just contestantly shit on the C's) but we coulda done SOO much worse."
washingtonwizards,3dcdwj,oglefro,2,Wed Jul 15 05:21:36 2015 UTC,"I'm excited for Oubre. It is a buy low move and he's got potential, and seems to have a good mindset. He wants to get better and he will fit right in one day in our rotation."
washingtonwizards,3dcdwj,Boymankid,2,Wed Jul 15 20:01:28 2015 UTC,"They say hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard...

I was not a fan of the amount of money we have Gortat but he's been earning it plus with the cap, it's aight."
washingtonwizards,3db4qo,oglefro,6,Tue Jul 14 23:26:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  However, I think the years on Marcin Gortat's contract was a bigger worry than the money."
washingtonwizards,3db4qo,pakilicious,8,Wed Jul 15 00:30:56 2015 UTC,"Well the way it was justified to me was... Since Gortat has been on the league he has been a backup, so he has not been putting to much stress on him self.  So while he's old age wise, production wise he is younger...  Like he's kinda sorta 2 years younger in basketball years lol.  If that makes sense at all.  But I was upset because I thought we could sign somebody decent with that money.  I also wanted Ariza back so what do I actually know? Lol"
washingtonwizards,3db4qo,oglefro,3,Wed Jul 15 00:52:50 2015 UTC,"Also bigs age MUCH more gracefully than wings and point guards. Marcin also has a good ""old man"" game with his post moves, so I think he'll be able to ""earn"" the contract."
washingtonwizards,3db4qo,Boymankid,2,Wed Jul 15 19:59:42 2015 UTC,"Yes! Since he doesn't rely on his athleticism he can play for a while! Plus like someone else said, he has a very low Body fat % so he's in good shape and should have no health issues apart from accidents!  Dudes should play productively for a while."
washingtonwizards,3db4qo,oglefro,2,Wed Jul 15 21:22:32 2015 UTC,"Gortat a bargain.Many times reported that he has lowest body fat % on team, now that Wiz appear ready to surround him with shooters and Wall,leave Nene as backup,we will see Gortat get even better. , Ariza turned down the exact same deal from Wizards that Houston gave him.We missed him last year,but between Pierce,Rasual Butler and at the end,Otto,we replaced him.I think with Dudley and Neal we  will get back to that free flowing three pt shooting team we were in 2014."
washingtonwizards,3db4qo,DCsportsJohnny,2,Wed Jul 15 16:12:48 2015 UTC,John makes shooters better by his passing and being able to get them the ball on their shooters pockets allowing easier shots.  Porter is becoming a Trevor Ariza type player as well! Long lanky defender able to slash a bit... Just needs a tad more consistency to become a better shooter. But he will get plenty of good looks this season!
washingtonwizards,3db4qo,oglefro,2,Wed Jul 15 18:44:09 2015 UTC,Plus Bradley..plus Neal..plus Beal..plus..Oubre? Plus Anderson..plus Humphries..it's  2014 ALL OVER AGAIN!

He can shoot a mid range jumper (how consistent I don't know). His post game is mediocre. Overall, in my opinion, he deserves Dejuan Blairs roster spot.  Dejuan Blair is not a good rebounder. His post/offensive game consists of just floaters. He is slow and can't even jump. Also, he has a poor attitude.  Jarrid is 26 and based from his background and social media, he seems more mature (I know this is a stupid way/logic for me to judge him). If you look at his career history, he's been everywhere. He wants a home and would probably give everything on the court just to secure a spot. His motto is, ""How can you lose when you came from nothing."" He has value due to his rebounding. His size is appealing. His offensive game looks decent.  Too bad Dejuan Blair has a guaranteed contract. Blair and Webster better ball out next season or their career is potentially on the verge of ending (Martell just wants to rap)."

washingtonwizards,3d6byi,WizOfAwesSite,4,Mon Jul 13 21:34:32 2015 UTC,"I'll hook shot every piece of trash I throw away for the life of his next contract if he gets $7 mil.  As far as I can tell the only real offer he's actually gotten this summer or last was the veteran's minimum that the Mavs offered. I don't know if Rich Paul sucks or if teams really think KS really really sucks but his market is bad. If the team wasn't gonna make proactive moves to retain him, Ernie should've jumped when Minny wanted to trade for him."
washingtonwizards,3d6byi,SonOfSkipBaeless,2,Tue Jul 14 03:25:44 2015 UTC,Getting Markieff is a pipedream
washingtonwizards,3d6byi,Bartlet4America,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:50:59 2015 UTC,"And that move limits our flexibillity next summer so I'm meh about it.  Like it would be good, but we'd have to give up more than We should + the fact it hampers what we've been clearing for next summer"
washingtonwizards,3d6byi,oglefro,2,Tue Jul 14 16:57:46 2015 UTC,"Hibbert plays for the Lakers now, not the Mavs. I'd say the Mavs are the only team that will sign him. If the Spurs hadn't gotten David West it would have been interesting if they took a flyer on him."
washingtonwizards,3d6byi,youngsaiyan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:25:49 2015 UTC,There is a 0% chance of him staying with us. :(
washingtonwizards,3d6byi,jrb1851,9,Tue Jul 14 01:54:02 2015 UTC,What bothers you about that? He wants a more prominent role and he hasn't earned one. He's 25 years old and not getting better.
washingtonwizards,3d6byi,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,6,Tue Jul 14 02:11:35 2015 UTC,"Try to remember how many bad games he gave us for the few good ones he did. If he gets us a trade exception, I'm quite fine with it. Beats walking for nothing."
washingtonwizards,3d6byi,Mehberry,2,Tue Jul 14 02:21:15 2015 UTC,"My disappointment is purely personal, I know it's the best move for us as a team and him as a player at a critical transition stage in his career. Rich Paul is working his voodoo magic, it'll be interesting to see how it pans out. I'm excited to see who we end up with, that position on our roster has been so inconsistent in results for us. Nene is so hot and cold, Gortat had an overall great season but choked a few times at critical moments, etc.   I'm going nuts waiting for the season to start up again, this year is going to be awesome."
washingtonwizards,3d6byi,jrb1851,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:21:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah,kinda sad. Keveen gave me many happy moments(2 years ago he completely dominated healthy LaMarcus Aldridge here in a win) but he is a one trick pony..get it,shoot it.Early this year,he dropped weight,was leaping for rebounds,blocking shots..thought the light had turned on..even saw KS make a few nice assists.Then,back to same ol' Keveen.Some of that MIGHT be Randy random rotation,but KS needed to get better,and he didn't.So,it's  Marcin,Nene.Humphries,Drew for the bigs,and I can live with that."
washingtonwizards,3d6byi,DCsportsJohnny,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:56:10 2015 UTC,Why you can't expect a sign-and-trade: nobody wants that scrub.
washingtonwizards,3d4wmr,sweedish_cherf,7,Mon Jul 13 15:31:40 2015 UTC,"It's pretty tough to do anything with Nene's 13 mill contract.           Noone is going to take an aging, injury prone PF for 13mill.        We're gonna have to trade one of our valuable players other than Nene to work something out, and I say it's not worth it.          Nene is UFA next season so I'd say just wait another year and sign a FA"
washingtonwizards,3d4wmr,peterkimmm,6,Mon Jul 13 15:42:01 2015 UTC,"There is still this obsession with trading Nene. I know we were all mad at him after the playoffs, but now that things have calmed down I think most can admit he'd still be a useful player in the right role.   Wittman said he plans to use him as backup C. Now Nene isn't a starter anymore but I think he could beast on other teams bench bigs. I would rather hold onto Nene for this season than move him for nothing"
washingtonwizards,3d4wmr,ireddit270,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:45:45 2015 UTC,"Just like /u/Mehberry said,                Better question is what would we trade with.      We don't really necessarily have anyone to trade away.                     Wall, Beal, Otto all are basically untouchable in my personal opinion.     So just like I said earlier, wait out til his contract ends and sign him for cheaper or let him sign with another team."
washingtonwizards,3d4wmr,peterkimmm,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:11:37 2015 UTC,"We cant deal Nene..we need his salary to defray KD salary,and with KevinS gone.we need him to be backup to Gortat.I think he will be good there,Nene,despite bad end,still  good facilitator,physical defender.I think we are going with what we have.Toronto got worse(Greivis gone,Lou Williams gone),atlanta worse(demare Carroll,Milsap gone) Chicago a year older,(and no Thibodeau at coach) Wish Pierce had come back,though."
washingtonwizards,3d4wmr,DCsportsJohnny,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:06:45 2015 UTC,Someone might need a center at the trade deadline. But unless we are doing really bad we will probably need him for the playoffs anyway.
washingtonwizards,3d4wmr,thricethefun,13,Mon Jul 13 19:29:55 2015 UTC,"It would help to classify all 15 guys under contract right now in terms of their trade value (of course, everything is negotiable if, say, the Kings offer Cousins or KD demands a trade)...   Not going to be traded, so don't even bother asking: Wall, Beal (first year that Beal makes the top line, IMO) Probably not but tell us what you're offering: Porter, Gortat (whose deal from last year suddenly looks great for the team after this off-season) Meh, we'd listen...: Humphries, Anderson, Neal, Dudley, Gooden, Oubre We'll make the first call: Sessions, Temple Unprotected 2nd rounder, you say? Done!: Webster, Nene, Blair   So maybe you package someone from Group #3 and Group #4 in a way that gets you one quality PF/C but you're not getting the next Lamarcus Aldridge walking through the door. No multi-year guaranteed deals are coming back under any circumstances."
washingtonwizards,3d4wmr,Obersts001,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:41:53 2015 UTC,This is the first list that I've agreed with in this subreddit when it comes to evaluating our trade stock.
washingtonwizards,3d4wmr,Dr_Dugtrio,5,Mon Jul 13 22:03:28 2015 UTC,Better question is what would we trade with.
washingtonwizards,3d4wmr,Mehberry,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:38:28 2015 UTC,"Morris would be perfect for us, besides the fact his brother isn't with him, at that point why not get them both? So, a 3-way trade.  Suns Get: future 2nd(unprotected), Humphries(unhappy with role on team?)   Logic: Get rid of unhappy player in Morris  Pistons Get: Future 2nd(unprotected)   Logic: A future 2nd to drop an eh player, possibly unhappy  Wiz get: Marcus $ Markeiff Morris   Logic: Big rotation gets better, solid stretch 4 starter, twiiiiiins  This(in my mind) would be a midseason trade, Suns will see how Morris reacts to the team now that his bro is gone, if he becomes a detriment on the court or to morale he's gone. Pistons don't see much in Morris either, don't see him as long-term option on team, ship him off. For us Hump would have to be played sparingly, or not enough for his liking, wanting a bigger role he get's shipped to PHX."
washingtonwizards,3d4wmr,Cpr196,8,Mon Jul 13 17:57:59 2015 UTC,"Never gonna get Markieff for a second rounder, regardless of how unhappy he is. Cmon man"
washingtonwizards,3d4wmr,ragtime_sam,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:15:57 2015 UTC,"I hate to say it but I would be very, very intrigued by the idea of flipping Otto for Markieff Morris."
washingtonwizards,3d4wmr,ragtime_sam,11,Mon Jul 13 15:44:55 2015 UTC,That's a weird one. Why?
washingtonwizards,3d4wmr,SonOfSkipBaeless,2,Mon Jul 13 16:23:06 2015 UTC,"Stretch 4, averaged about 15 and 6 last year in a loaded conference and is on an insanely cheap contract (4 years/8 mil per). I'm not sure how great he is on D and I know he has had character issues so that's why I only said I'd be intrigued by the trade.   I know we love Otto but I think the way Markieff contributes on offense is already above Otto's ceiling on that end of the court. Otto has shown he can rebound at an elite level for his position, but along with what I said before I don't think he'll ever be a lock down wing defender because of his slight frame. This is all obviously just my opinion."
washingtonwizards,3d4wmr,ragtime_sam,5,Mon Jul 13 17:53:53 2015 UTC,don't think he'll be a lockdown wing defender? did you watch the toronto series?
washingtonwizards,3d4wmr,stephenporter,4,Mon Jul 13 17:57:56 2015 UTC,"I'm commenting in the Wizards subreddit, what do you think"
washingtonwizards,3d4wmr,ragtime_sam,8,Mon Jul 13 18:35:15 2015 UTC,I'd rather give up a future first than trade Otto.
washingtonwizards,3d4wmr,jeffsays,7,Mon Jul 13 17:32:35 2015 UTC,I'd like to add markieff but not at the cost of otto.

washingtonwizards,3d5f99,baobao3,5,Mon Jul 13 17:45:58 2015 UTC,It's cool how involved Gortat is in his come country.
washingtonwizards,3d5f99,thricethefun,2,Mon Jul 13 19:34:03 2015 UTC,"Went to Gortat action figure nite vs Toronto.he had an entire section of countrymen there,came out after game to hang with them,gracious,friendly,even though he had an awful game.I LOVE him on our team,perfect complement to Wall,and when he is involved,really effective.I DVRd the Indiana game two years ago..playoff there,where he DESTROYED them..like 36 pts.24 rebounds..Go Marc!"
washingtonwizards,3d5f99,DCsportsJohnny,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:13:45 2015 UTC,Submarines are so cramped!   I am 6 foot even and it was not roomy for me.  Crazy that a guy like david robinson would try and join the navy to work on a Sub LOL.
washingtonwizards,3d2suq,jimmcdermont,9,Mon Jul 13 01:53:41 2015 UTC,He doesn't pass the ball tho.  He has a hookshot God and his post moves are good but low post scoring is pretty much the only thing he brings consistently.  He has moments where his post defense looks good! Then he'll do something stupid.  We have a full roster and he wants a bigger role.   I love that KS lyfe but I don't think he's worth it.
washingtonwizards,3d2suq,oglefro,2,Mon Jul 13 02:01:30 2015 UTC,"The scoring isn't even consistent, he'd have some good games but also 8 bad ones for every good one."
washingtonwizards,3d2suq,Mehberry,2,Mon Jul 13 11:57:22 2015 UTC,I used to say that but then someone linked me this. He has the highest percentage for hook shots (72%) in the league with comparable sample size for hook shots attempted.
washingtonwizards,3d2suq,andrewchi,2,Mon Jul 13 15:38:04 2015 UTC,I'm well aware of his hook. But he didn't use the hook every time. He'd shovel in 4 footers and fade away jumpers.
washingtonwizards,3d2suq,Mehberry,2,Mon Jul 13 16:26:57 2015 UTC,"I've always thought he's decent at everything, excels at nothing. But I suppose his hook is plus. Nobody spends millions on a hook shot, though."
washingtonwizards,3d2suq,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,2,Mon Jul 13 13:21:02 2015 UTC,"Wiz season tix holder last 20 years,back to Cap Ctr...fan of the team since 1967..KS is a good guy off the bench,but..no rebounding,even tho he started year really active,had lost like 20 lbs,was even blocking some shots.As stated above,black hole,ball goes in,almost never comes out.I think someone planted in Kevin's mind he'd  be a hot commodity in FA season,and now we've moved on with Gortat, Humphries .Nene and a (beleve it when I see it) commitment to small ball."
washingtonwizards,3d2suq,DCsportsJohnny,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:38:49 2015 UTC,"You're right! He thinks that he is going to start somewhere???  Like he stated he wanted a bigger role or he'd leave, he's not good enough to be a starter but for whatever reason his agent told him he was he French hope.  I love KS but his defense is so inconsistent, too inconsistent to be a starter. Like you said he'll block some shots, force a tough one, then not box out give up a putback.  He is at best a 3rd big off the bench. And I'd hate to be he team where he is he third best big."
washingtonwizards,3d2suq,oglefro,6,Mon Jul 13 17:35:06 2015 UTC,"I love KSLIFE, He is the only NBA player that follows me on twitter, and he gets buckets.   He's also one of the great enigmas of the NBA.  He doesn't dream of greatness or wins, just tropical animals and galavanting through the lane. Every once in a while he will dominate the court for 5 straight  posessions, and then try to shoot over a triple team and get dunked on. He seems like he would go to a strip club and actually try to  order food.  He's going to go somewhere like Dallas and drop 17-8 with weirdly inconsistent defense, and half the fanbase will love him while the other half hates him.  I love him, the 3 games a year where he suddenly became our best player would always be pure joy"
washingtonwizards,3d2suq,kamikazemelonman,3,Mon Jul 13 06:44:05 2015 UTC,"I was gonna post, but then I read this and you basically summed up exactly how I feel about the guy.  I'll definitely miss him  and that hook shot when he's gone."
washingtonwizards,3d2suq,ircdub,4,Mon Jul 13 14:31:53 2015 UTC,"I would take him back to come off the bench, but I would not be happy if I was a team going into the season with him as a starter."
washingtonwizards,3d2suq,TophMasterFlex,3,Mon Jul 13 02:34:24 2015 UTC,"Black hole who wants to start and can't control fouls. I dig Kevin and he was fun but no thanks, ready to move on."
washingtonwizards,3d2suq,Zomby24,2,Mon Jul 13 02:05:55 2015 UTC,I wouldn't take him for the price range he is looking for.
washingtonwizards,3d2suq,Gr8WallofChinatown,2,Mon Jul 13 04:01:23 2015 UTC,No no no no no.
washingtonwizards,3d2suq,Mehberry,2,Mon Jul 13 09:38:35 2015 UTC,"No, not really. He gets on quick short runs where his hook shot is falling, but he struggles to move the ball and not much happening defensively.  He's a bench player, i'm not sure anybody thinks he's a 'beast'"
washingtonwizards,3d2suq,faint-smile,2,Mon Jul 13 12:12:52 2015 UTC,"He has legitimate center size, and a nice touch. Most of the negative things that have been said about him are also true but I still think he's an above average backup 5. I wanted him back over Gooden cause I can really see this team getting bullied down low when Gortat is out"
washingtonwizards,3d2suq,ragtime_sam,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:20:35 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I've never thought of him as a potential center. I guess even in certain rotations i've always thought of him as the tallest guy on the court, but not a center."
washingtonwizards,3d2suq,faint-smile,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:27:08 2015 UTC,Beast? The NBA2k15 mobile app stats for him begs to differ.
washingtonwizards,3d2suq,Shaidester,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:39:27 2015 UTC,"If he's on a minimum contract, sure, but he probably will get more than that, so I think they should let him walk or preferably do a sign and trade."

washingtonwizards,3d1nae,oglefro,5,Sun Jul 12 20:07:53 2015 UTC,It's amazing how good Memphis is when you look at all of the bad decisions they've made while getting better.  Machado with the nutmeg. I dunno if he's an NBA point guard but he's definitely a point guard.

washingtonwizards,3d1nae,oglefro,7,Sun Jul 12 20:57:56 2015 UTC,Shot selection is a issue.  He needs to learn that turning around and attempting putbacks in front of bigger guys is not going to work in the NBA. Lotta driving into the defense to.  take a stepback and get yourself a easier shot.

washingtonwizards,3d28fm,oglefro,2,Mon Jul 13 02:02:30 2015 UTC,"Well its a good thing summer league means jackshit.  Really though SL is just to get an eye test, and this year's wiz SL roster is especially terrible. I just wanted to point that out in case any wiz fans are worried."
washingtonwizards,3d28fm,m25l,3,Mon Jul 13 04:10:44 2015 UTC,"I would be worried if our real roster was out there sucking but Oubre is the only one who is expected to have a role on the team in the regular season and he's actually showing some good signs.   So I agree, like you said, nothing to worry about."
washingtonwizards,3d3jp5,deadm1c3,13,Mon Jul 13 06:08:14 2015 UTC,"Think of it from Sixer's POV.             Only reason they would trade him is if they get a really good deal, or if they know for sure he won't be completely healthy for the forseeable future.             Also keep in the fact that they wouldn't trade him away cheap. He was a top prospect when healthy and Sixers highly value of his healthy potental .           I wouldnt be too happy even if we somehow acquired him: either he's banged up to the point where Sixers don't see him getting healthy or we traded away someone(or draft picks) of value.     TLDR, he won't come cheap and is not worth the risk for his price tag."
washingtonwizards,3d3jp5,peterkimmm,3,Mon Jul 13 06:20:47 2015 UTC,I'd prefer to avoid the player that has never played in the NBA and is going to sit out another season

But I actually think this is smart but would not work...  I really think the sixers have faith that Joel will make a comeback and is pretty much untradeable even with his injury  Now, wait until next summer....if Joel is looking fantastic and the sixers are ready to really rely on him.. maybe you could make a play for Okafor  By then Okafor should be a solid player already that is proven  Durant, Okafor, Wall would be so nice together  I really like Oak tho so idk how it will all shake out"
washingtonwizards,3d3jp5,LostCityLeague,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:10:32 2015 UTC,I think Joel doesn't have the disipline to let himself heal. Should prob just get used to Okafor and forget you drafted Joel. That way if he does end up working out somehow you are pleasantly surprised.
washingtonwizards,3d3jp5,youngsaiyan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:37:44 2015 UTC,"What the other guy said. Even if the sixers decide to keep tanking, part and parcel of that concept is needing high draft picks. You can do the math from there."
washingtonwizards,3d3jp5,faint-smile,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:15:49 2015 UTC,"1) The Wizards don't need him...why wait for a Center to develop when you are in win-now mode when you have Gortat, who is suitable now?  It's not like Cousins, where you know you are getting an upgrade. 2) Sixers aren't trading him for anything less than an unprotected 1st round pick, and probably would want some kind of sweetener.  3) Durant doesn't care about Embiid.  4) Personally, I wonder if Embiid is going to be Javale 2.0...I've seen some of his stuff on the Internet and I wonder how committed to basketball he is."

washingtonwizards,3d04gd,Nickdoggmoneycash,9,Sun Jul 12 10:38:00 2015 UTC,"This is very deflating news on Sunday morning; he had an outside chance, but a chance nevertheless, of making the team - with this news, it's highly doubtful, and most-likely, he'll join another NBA team/go overseas..."
washingtonwizards,3d04gd,skinsballr,10,Sun Jul 12 11:17:40 2015 UTC,I doubt he ever had a chance. We already have 15 guys under contract so we would have to release a proven NBA player (or the guy we traded up in the draft for) to sign a 23-year-old who averaged 15 points a game mostly against teenagers.

washingtonwizards,3cz8b8,haughtcrestedelmer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:58:03 2015 UTC,"Still want to see his jump shot. Seems like a lot is close to the hoop shots. And it might just be me, but seems like he's going up strong, drawing fouls, but often unable to get the and-1. Would like to see this."
washingtonwizards,3cypa8,whitebrucewayne,12,Sat Jul 11 23:59:47 2015 UTC,"Copy pasting my post from the game thread for visibility:    My eye ball analysis of Oubre:  Positives   Good defense as projected, moved a lot - I think I saw him reorient some of his teammates on the floor to set up defense positioning No fear to attack the rim 3PT shooting form looks improved from his college days, albeit going 1-7 High energy and hustle (dove for a loose ball at least once, helped swarm for double/triple-teaming, followed some of his shots) Got some good rebounds   Negatives   seems to rely on his energy rather than the pace of the game or the flow of the offense to score follow-up offense needs work (seems quick to trigger his 2nd attempt and end up getting blocked/turning it over) non-existent at times off-the-ball didn't show much else on offense other than attacking iso straight for the rim when he wasn't shooting a 3 -- seemed to pre-committed only to get to the rim rather than look for options 1-7 from the 3     Overall: Agree with OP. Looked hella' raw and unpolished as expected, but his game seemed to tighten up somewhat toward the latter half of the game. Showed a lot of faults but also a lot of positives that he was expected to bring. To my amateur eye, he really seem to have the tools to make a good player - but it'll depend on him and his willingness to improve."
washingtonwizards,3cypa8,andrewchi,5,Sun Jul 12 00:23:05 2015 UTC,Good recap. He did some dumb stuff on offense but on defense you can see that he does have some BBIQ.
washingtonwizards,3cypa8,SonOfSkipBaeless,8,Sun Jul 12 00:50:26 2015 UTC,"seems to rely on his energy rather than the pace of the game or the flow of the offense to score   Hmm, if only there were a PG someone on the team who had a similar problem their first few years and would just go 100 MPH all the time, if only."
washingtonwizards,3cypa8,Cpr196,6,Sun Jul 12 00:43:37 2015 UTC,"My evaluation:  0 Assists. Averaged below one per game in college. He's more of a ball-stopper than a facilitator on offense. Jacked up a lot of shots he shouldn't have taken. Missed open guys in the lanes several times. He had multiple shots blocked (bad at protecting the ball) and he didn't show me much of anything offensively. Zero shot-making ability, pretty much all his points were off of blown defensive assignments (this is essentially d-league talent he is playing against, half of that shit isn't going to fly against a true NBA wing/SF). Being able to ""dunk"" at the rim because your defender blew his cover is not a skillset. Nor does it make him a multi-dimensional threat, if I was coaching a team against him I would dare Oubre to take any shot on the court over 15 ft until he proves he can actually make them at a better than 30% clip.  I don't know why people are brushing off his poor shot. It's too easy to ignore the statistical evidence that shows he is a mediocre shooter in favor of strawman arguments like ""player X shot poorly too coming into the NBA and look at him now"". And the rebounding is a bit smoke and mirrors, a lot of those were uncontested rebounds that just kicked out his way. Time will tell if he actually can hold his own on the glass, but imagine him being on the floor against the Cavs playing LeBron / Thompson / Mozgov - no way is he getting a lot of boards. I think the rebounds have a lot to do with the competition he was playing.  Yes, I'm still bitter that we didn't take Portis. Dude is a country boy and a warrior and he freaking lit-up a talented Minn frontcourt earlier. He is certainly going to earn his keep and he could have definitely cracked the rotation, and given the team flexibility to play small-ball with him at C or go bigger with him at PF. Portis would gel with John Wall. Both are country guys, humble, and lead with action not words. Oubre is a polar opposite and I think he won't gel at all, it seems like he just wants to run his mouth and call himself the best without actually backing it up.  I openly admit I hated the draft pick. When you hear his outrageous quotes you begin to realize how insecure the kid is. If he calls himself the best enough he might eventually trick himself and other people and believe it. Oh, I forgot though - we are only supposed to talk about how much ""upside"" he has and the shoes he wore on draft night on this sub though because nobody can tolerate a dissenting opinion laced with fact.  The one and only positive I could agree with is his defensive motor, but against d-league level talent... really? Can you really hang your hat on him stopping a guy a few times who will never play a meaningful possession in the NBA?  Overall: Did you guys see the shoes he wore on his draft night though?"
washingtonwizards,3cypa8,MobyDickTracyMorgan,6,Sun Jul 12 03:24:11 2015 UTC,"As the guy who made the previous comment, I agree with you. In a non-eyeball assessment, you will see that there is certainly a reason to worry whether his positives will translate at a true-NBA level. I noticed as an observer that he certainly did not have fear in attacking (which I labeled as a positive), but that necessarily does not mean his attacks were either smart or successful (further, I mention in the negatives that he seems pre committed to attack rather looking for the open man - which you seem to agree with as well). My intention wasn't to pump this guy up like how some Wizards blogs are doing at the moment (they're solely looking at his double-double and turning a blind eye to his FG%, 3P%, and how he got those 20 points).   I couldn't agree more with the part about how he scored a lot from blown defensive assignments - it leaves one to wonder whether he would've actually gotten 20 points in an NBA from the way he played today (no, he wouldn't). He does, as I mentioned, have a lot of faults. As to his 3PT shooting, I don't have a conclusion on it simply because of the sample size. I only know from what I saw in this one SL game, which was that his form wasn't that bad - now whether he's a good shooter because of that? Only time will tell.  Again, I agree with you and understand why you feel a certain about the things I haven't fully formed an opinion on. I just wanted to inform other people reading that they should take my positives for what they are, immediate eyeball assessments that is pretty narrow in scope and not indicative of whether he is a proven-player or a bust   And I did think his shoes were ridiculous. And yes it did hurt that Portis went 3-4 from 3PT to fill out his 23 points by putting in work against Minnie's hyped, young front court . . . as a 22nd pick."
washingtonwizards,3cypa8,andrewchi,2,Sun Jul 12 03:39:47 2015 UTC,"Very good write-up, I appreciate it.  I think your positives / negatives was very fair and accurate and I agree with them.  I know your comment will be very visible because it reads pretty objectively.  I wanted to take that list and give an opinionated analysis of what I saw because I watched over 3 full quarters of play.  I'm in no way attacking the positives/negatives you outlined.    I agree with the 3 PT shooting, I'm still accounting for a lot of his college metrics as well, but in time he will have enough of an NBA game-rep sample size to draw inferences from.  Certainly not yet.  A lot of young guys across the board are struggling to find their range, but a lot of those guys also shot better than the 32% 3PT Oubre did in college.  We will see as it progresses.    I know I'm on a distant island because of my pointed opinion, but I just wanted to voice it because I fear a lot of people are going to see his 20/10 line and immediately get fixated on that as you astutely mentioned."
washingtonwizards,3cypa8,MobyDickTracyMorgan,3,Sun Jul 12 03:49:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, I liked your write-up as well - the concern for whether his output tonight will translate in a real game is warranted. Another thing that actually worries me is that his right-handed offense game was non-existent. In all times he drove it to his right, he had to finish with his left hand -- he'll have to work on that early on his career."
washingtonwizards,3cypa8,andrewchi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:27:45 2015 UTC,That's a good thing to point out about how he always tries to finish with his left.  A lot of scouts were saying the same thing.  It was really apparent even from this single game because he did it to his detriment a few times (maybe got away with it a time or two as well).
washingtonwizards,3cypa8,MobyDickTracyMorgan,3,Sun Jul 12 04:40:02 2015 UTC,"John Wall wore the same shoes after a game a couple times. I think the front office drafted Oubre with hopes that he would develop into an NBA player in a few years. I don't think he'll see the floor unless we lose a few players to injury or we're getting blown out.   I agree that we should have drafted Portis, but we can't change the past so we should roll with what we have. It's his first game with Alex Len guarding the basket. Do you remember what Otto looked like in his Summer League debut? It was awful and you could say a lot of the same things you mentioned for Oubre. Don't be so down on the kid after his first game."
washingtonwizards,3cypa8,jeffsays,3,Sun Jul 12 04:30:12 2015 UTC,"so you're still doing this, huh"
washingtonwizards,3cypa8,stephenporter,8,Sun Jul 12 14:17:10 2015 UTC,Much better than Otto's summer league debut.
washingtonwizards,3cypa8,SonOfSkipBaeless,3,Sun Jul 12 00:50:48 2015 UTC,concern a bit.  here is Bobby Portis in comparison.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1QaJKxxkzc
washingtonwizards,3cypa8,Knighthonor,2,Sun Jul 12 06:16:19 2015 UTC,"No way in hell he's 6' 7""          I see us having him play as backup SG rather than SF, but sucks he's gonna get garbage minutes behind Beal/Neal and Otto/Dudley in both positions."
washingtonwizards,3cypa8,peterkimmm,3,Sun Jul 12 01:55:18 2015 UTC,"Oubre is a 19yo rookie on a competitive playoff team, I don't know who expected him to get a bunch of minutes right away..  We drafted him for the future. Outside of KO, the only SG/SF we will have under contract after this season are Beal and Porter."

washingtonwizards,3cyp9q,blast0ise,7,Sun Jul 12 00:04:45 2015 UTC,"Oubre was nervous, looked raw but once he settled down he looked pretty solid. Defensively he looks fantastic, he'll make a great 3 and D player in the future but I don't think summer league really showcases his potential since he isn't really great at creating his own shot. He'll look a lot better with Wall setting him up"
washingtonwizards,3cyp9q,andrewchi,3,Sun Jul 12 00:13:21 2015 UTC,"Agreed, and while he does seem to have an instinctive reflex to attack iso, I think he did it more than he usually might with the regular roster since a lot of his SL teammates were trying to score on their own (and reducing ball-movement and catch-and-shoot opportunities)."
washingtonwizards,3cyp9q,Gr8WallofChinatown,4,Sun Jul 12 00:56:43 2015 UTC,Kudos to EG btw. He drafted smart this year. He picked players that will mesh well with John Wall. Oubre on the break with Wall just makes me excited. Aaron White with Wall could be an exciting duo.
washingtonwizards,3cyp9q,Gr8WallofChinatown,6,Sun Jul 12 00:08:04 2015 UTC,Oubre Jr is raw. He definitely has a very high upside and potential. Already a great defender. Very aggressive on defense and offense. Started off really rusty but started to click as he became more comfortable. He has decent handles. Mediocre shooter. Above average finisher. He will struggle during the season but once he gets comfortable he will be a star caliber player.  Jarrid Famous was consistent and played well. I don't think he can have a spot on our roster but he played well.  Jackon was garbage.  Machado was consistent. I liked what I saw from him.  AARON WHITE. THIS GUY HAS POTENTIAL. He deserves a spot on the team. We really didn't see his shooting potential since no one wanted to pass to him. His passing is superb. Has good athleticism and as someone pointed out to me is a good finisher. He reminds me of Jan Vesely and Bonner combined.  Devin Booker is legit. He is going to be a good player for the Suns. He just needs to get used to having more touches.  Alex Len was just on cruise control. Dunking and ooping with ease.
washingtonwizards,3cyp9q,kamikazemelonman,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:05:00 2015 UTC,Aaron White is more Jeff Green than anything else
washingtonwizards,3cyp9q,LarryBirdsGrundle,2,Sun Jul 12 00:34:07 2015 UTC,"He'll need work on his shot, actually.  Very reluctant shooter at Iowa until his last half of his senior season.  He started raining them from everywhere then.  But, yeah, it looks like he showcased what he did best at Iowa today.  He's the ultimate garbage-man, sees things on the court before they happen.  I really hope he can carve a space of the roster.  (I'm an Iowa fan.  Watching AW defy the odds his whole career has been amazing)."
washingtonwizards,3cyrvj,FunkyMonk92,4,Sun Jul 12 00:24:45 2015 UTC,"The Wiz have a full roster so slim chance of making the team this year unless there's a trade (and there are lots of indications that the Wiz are looking to make a trade).  I wish there was a spot for him though. I loved what I saw from White Flight. Good athleticism, good passer, smart (he had a sweet rebound tip to Oubre for an and-1, great instincts). His outside shot didn't fall but his stroke looks good. He's the kind of guy that makes me wish the Wiz had their own D-League team to keep him close."
washingtonwizards,3cyrvj,SonOfSkipBaeless,2,Sun Jul 12 00:45:10 2015 UTC,The Wiz don't have a D-League team?  I thought every team did?  Odd.

washingtonwizards,3cyrvj,gerbluer,6,Sun Jul 12 05:31:21 2015 UTC,"Another Iowa fan here.  Don't expect AW to shoot lights out.  He was not a shooter his whole career at Iowa, and caught fire the last half of his senior season.  He's always been a reluctant shooter  That said, his bball IQ is ridiculous.  One of those guys that sees things on the court before it happens.  He's a hell of an athlete.  His best play at Iowa was finishing backdoor oops.  He can be the ultimate garbage man, as you saw with his putback dunks.  He may struggle on the defensive side of the ball.  Dude has been doubted is whole life.  Not fast enough, not a good enough shooter.  Was only offered by small schools and Iowa.  Well, he ended his career as the second leading scorer in Iowa history, and top 5 in a ton of other categories.  He'll work harder than just about everyone else because thats what he's had to do his whole career.  I really hope he can carve out a spot on the team."

washingtonwizards,3cyrvj,bhotep,2,Sun Jul 12 00:37:36 2015 UTC,"As of now White is probably going to be stashed in Europe. But I will say this, if he shows the ability to hit threes from the PF spot these next couple games that will raise eyebrows. He took the shot in college but he's gotta start making them in SL. He would be a better contributor right now than Dejuan Blair who is wasting away on the bench, taking up a roster spot.  Basically White's best chance to stick in the league is if he can shoot NBA threes. His rebounding and hustle is great but as an undersized guy he needs to add that 'floor spacing' label to his name to really raise his profile"
washingtonwizards,3cyrvj,ireddit270,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:14:40 2015 UTC,How would stashing him in Europe work? I thought if a team doesn't sign a player they become a free agent?

Team lost, he was lucky to shoot 40% from the field only because he got several dunks from blown assignments.  1-7 from 3 PT.  0 assists.  Had two shots blocked.  Finished with a negative +/-.  If you want to hang your hat on him playing nice defense / getting rebounds against d-league type talent, go ahead.  But if you watched that game (I did) you can't tell me with a straight face that he ""shined"" at all.    Bobby Portis... there's someone who actually did shine in the games today.

washingtonwizards,3cuege,httr20,0,Sat Jul 11 17:49:36 2015 UTC,I think the case down the stretch was due to the fact that he was coming off an injury and you don't want to let someone work out the kinks in important games.

He stressed, though, that it’s not the end of the Wizards’ offseason moves: “I hope it’s not.” Gortat also touched upon his chemistry with Nene: “We’re the same kind of players, we tried to play alongside each other, but it got more and more cumbersome over time.

washingtonwizards,3cu30o,DCsportsJohnny,0,Mon Jul 13 17:05:49 2015 UTC,"We will have to just agree to disagree.Played and coached for 30+ years,think my opinions are as valid as yours. Guess you are only evaluating Kantner in the 26 games he played with OKC vs Gortats 8 years in league.and with that huge sample size(just ignore the fact he couldn't get in the lineup for a non playoff Utah Jazz squad). Westbrook did NOT average triple double..he had a few but by dominating the ball.If you actually LOOKED at his stats,BTW, you'd  see his turnover to assist ratio was slightly better than 2-1..8.6 assists to 4.4 turnovers..TERRIBLE for a point guard. Since you clearly do not really pay attention to career numbers,kinda pointless to refute your other points..ask someone who in actuality follows the NBA..The idea of taking a career backup like Waiters over Beal is laughable. Glad you like Ibaka..when Westbrook is a free agent in 2017,that is who you'll  have left with the GREAT Kantner ."
washingtonwizards,3cu30o,DCsportsJohnny,0,Mon Jul 13 17:49:54 2015 UTC,"That is because you are an illiterate moron.You saying something doesn't mean it is true.I gave you statistics,not opinion.Gortat is better than Kantner. Beal is better than Waiters.Wall is a better point guard than Westbrook.Having LIVED in Oklahoma,teaching law,and having lived in the DC area for 40+years,not even close.Cursing and hurling insults only weakens any of  the wrongheaded ideas you purport.I  will think of you in 2016,whenDurant comes here,and in 2017,when Westbrook  leaves and you have Ibaka and Kantner on a losing squad.Kantner will love it,it'll  be just like Utah,except he'll get to play."
washingtonwizards,3cu30o,DCsportsJohnny,0,Mon Jul 13 19:04:41 2015 UTC,"Rest if your ill formulated points.. 1) Westbrook is efficienr? 2-1 assist to turnovers? The fact that THREE Wizards shot as much as he did? Well.you say,they were shorthanded..how can that be when they are so good..best in the West? 2) Kantner...what in the workd are you bading this on? His play in Utah,whete he couldnt get off the bench? His 26 whole games with OKC,where again,playing a lot his numbers were worse than aging Gortat? Potential dies not win games. 3) OKC better place to live than DC? Taught in Ft Sill Oklahoma..the entire state is a flat,boring,place to live..no matter how much you make,you're  living in OKLAHOMA..and,for an intelligent black man like Durant..ugghh! 4) looked at your rant that his family lives there..NOT his Mom,or sister..called out his Mom in his MVP speech two years ago..she and his brother Tony  both with negative twitters about how bad ""oklahoma shitty""..is..their words,not mine"

Most of it could be due to injuries at the wrong time but they have the talent to be a perennial finals team and just haven't been up to snuff.

washingtonwizards,3cu30o,DCsportsJohnny,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:47:20 2015 UTC,Lol so losing westbrook in 2013 to injuries. Then ibaka in 2014 in the wcf for 2 games which was huge! Then this whole season was just injury after injury. Wall and beal are not better options then ibaka and Westbrook. Kanter is 8 years younger than gortat and put up 18 and 11 in his 26 games with okc. The fact is that okc is the best place for him to win. They have the best roster in the league when healthy. Why would he wanna face that Cavs team year after year in the ecf till lebron faded away cause even with durant you guys would still not even be better than them. Maybe add some depth to your frontcourt get a deeper bench and maybe he might come. But I doubt it he could always fly his mom to okc to watch him play hes a millionare!

Sac Town caves into Karl demands feeling they remain stagnant with Cousins, want to tank and rebuild(before you think that sounds crazy, remember, it's the Kings).  Wiz get Demarcus, Gallinari  Kings get Wiz 1st(2016, 2020 Top 10 protected) Nurkic, Porter, Gortat  Nuggets get Mclemore, Oubre, Wiz 2nd, Wiz 1st (2017 top 5 protected)"
washingtonwizards,3cpj4g,Dr_Dugtrio,13,Thu Jul 9 19:42:53 2015 UTC,The thought is that it involves the Mavs now that they lost DeAndre. Their starting center now is either McGee or Seraphin (Wiz rejects). My one friend (not the insider) came up with this:  Trade Nene and Blair into the Mav's cap space.   Take the trade exception and trade it with Webster and a pick for Gallinari.   Then sign a D-League big man and Dez Wells.
washingtonwizards,3cpj4g,jrb1851,6,Thu Jul 9 20:17:58 2015 UTC,That would be pretty awesome.

washingtonwizards,3cpj4g,relinquishy,11,Thu Jul 9 22:07:47 2015 UTC,Cousins is arguably the best center in the league. That deal would be a steal for us.
washingtonwizards,3cpj4g,DCsportsJohnny,0,Thu Jul 9 22:25:11 2015 UTC,"Better than Davis or Marc Gasol? He's top 10 no doubt about it, but you're trading away the entire future on one player. I don't care who the deal is for I would never make that trade. 3 years of first rounders, a top 10 center in Gortat, our starting 3 with a very high ceiling in Otto (who we have for dirt cheap right now on his rookie contract) and the pick we just got who has the potential* to be another Trevor Ariza. All for a great on the court player but an obvious knucklehead. Can't get along with a coach/front office and basically leads the lead in tech.    I would love Cousins and think his game is phenomenal but there's no way I would give up that much for him."
washingtonwizards,3cpj4g,relinquishy,3,Thu Jul 9 22:56:07 2015 UTC,"Wall, Beal, and Cousins would be a potentially championship winning trio.

washingtonwizards,3cpj4g,DCsportsJohnny,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:51:06 2015 UTC,"Davis isn't a center and yes he is definitely better than Marc ""I can't even shoot 40% in the postseason"" Gasol."

If the moves made this year are all part of the plan to bring KD home. If it's successful, then I'll move it up to an A.   Addressing your comment about downgrading from Pierce to Dudley: It was completely out of our control. Pierce decided to take millions of dollars less (especially when you factor in California/LA taxes). I think Ernie made a great move by grabbing Dudley to replace the absence of Pierce.   Edit: Forgot to add how upset I still am that we passed up on Bobby Portis even after moving up in the draft!"

Dudley is no PP, but he was essentially gotten for free so that's a win. Neal and Anderson, while individually not eye-popping FAs, help round out Wizards' expected evolution into small-ball and stretching the floor game.

Kanter is good offensively but awful on D, Waiters is a black hole, and their bench is really, really weak. Any injuries to their big 3 and they're completely toast, even if they stay healthy, I don't think they can get through the Spurs and warriors, and the clippers, rockets, and Grizz will give them very good series as well.   Anyway, if we don't get KD I think PF should be our #1 priority. Al Horford would be a good floor spacing option. If not him, I don't see anyone we'd max so we could get a starting 4 and some decent bench options as well. No matter what happens with KD, we'll be in a very good position going into the 2016-17 season."

washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,ragtime_sam,5,Mon Jul 13 04:15:28 2015 UTC,"Reasons why he would come:   Return to hometown (has publicly indicated it was neat for him to see players do this, e.g. LBJ) Leave competitive West for an easier road to conference finals Positively affected by Wizards pre-commitment moves (e.g. hiring his personal coach, choosing Oubre) OKC does not make it into WCF even with a healthy team Westbrook indicates he doesn't plan on sticking around after his own contract expires in 2017   Reasons why he wouldn't come:   OKC are already proven contenders despite competitive West (and KD probably wants to see how far this healthy team can go before even considering leaving) OKC's max will pay more than any other teams (Bird rights lets OKC do this) Higher max exclusively from OKC = job security, especially in the light of him suffering injuries Cementing history with a team Wizards do not show improvement in the next season     Note: KD can make the most money by signing for one year, then getting a max 5 year in 2017, which would be more than signing max for 2016 w/ OKC's Bird rights. Source. This is interesting because this option to sign for only one year would mean he would have a contract expiring the same year as Westbrook's in 2017. This gives KD the option to make a decision together with Westbrook if that's something he wants. The drawback for KD with this option is that the lack of job security given his recent injuries."
washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,Massi123,5,Thu Jul 9 18:28:08 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna say not super great, just because it would be totally unprecedented for one of the best players in the league to leave a better team (that will obviously offer the max) for a worse one. But there are a couple other factors in play that leave it a distinct possibility he'd choose washington. These include the east being easier, his roots in DC, and the Thunder's history for cheaping out (although it looks like they're trying hard to reverse that perception).  If I had to put a number on it I'd say 20-25% he leaves just because he would have an objectively better supporting cast in OKC."
washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,pine_straw,2,Thu Jul 9 14:13:06 2015 UTC,I genuinely feel that the Wizards are a better team than OKC if OKC doesn't have Durant in the roster.
washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,SkinsWiz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:49:56 2015 UTC,I think it's at least a lot closer than people act. If the Thunder without Durant played the Wiz in a 7 game series it'd be pretty close.
washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,Cpr196,4,Thu Jul 9 21:41:43 2015 UTC,"he would have an objectively better supporting cast in OKC.   Uhhh wut? Totally disagree. You wouldn't throw out ""objectively"" unless you thought there was no doubt about it. You really think westbrook/ibaka/kanter/waiters are undoubtedly better than wall/beal/porter/gortat? Definitely debatable and I know I'm biased but I'll take my younger wiz kids"
washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,ragtime_sam,4,Thu Jul 9 14:32:04 2015 UTC,"I mean it's close, we both have a great PG, sexual chocolate(Ibaka, Beal), a Shaqtin MVP, and a Euro-big man. Kanter could leave tho, if the Mavs just throw a bunch of money at him. After that it doesn't matter much, vets would come here for the min just to ring-chase, so our bench would fill out nicely."
washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,kmhokies35,2,Thu Jul 9 15:10:50 2015 UTC,"Westbrook was at one point an MVP favorite last year. Ibaka is about the only player in the league that can protect the rim at an elite level, then step out to hit 3's (shoots 38%). Kanter/Adams is a scary good center rotation, both are NBA starters and Kanter has allstar potential. Not to mention their prowess at drafting, which has resulted in a great crop of young talent (McGary, Roberson, and players listed above excluding Kanter). They have a better organization than us, and because of that, better players.  I personally think Wall is just about as valuable as Westbrook, but after that the gap widens significantly between our talent and theirs."
washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,SkinsWiz,3,Thu Jul 9 16:23:05 2015 UTC,I'm sorry man but OKC is miles better than us. Westbrook could have been the MVP if they has a better record
washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,Gr8WallofChinatown,0,Thu Jul 9 14:46:19 2015 UTC,"Miles better than us? Sorry I just disagree.   Yes Westbrook is a beast and mvp caliber player but they didn't even make the playoffs. I know the west and east right now are on different levels but I think the Wiz would have snuck into the playoffs if we were in the West (based on our record, we would have been the 8 seed). I also think if the Wiz and Thunder played a 7 game series without KD, the Wiz would win.... Point I'm making is this is up for debate. Hearing ""objectively better"" and ""miles better"" just isn't true IMO.  The Thunder WITH KD....different story"
washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,pine_straw,3,Thu Jul 9 15:26:01 2015 UTC,Are you serious? The Thunder went 45-37 in the west without having both Westbrook and Durant for long stretches. The west is so much better than the east. The Wests 8th seed is equivalent to the east' third seed.  We couldn't even beat a broken down Hawks team which would have lost first round in any matchup in the West. We probably could only beat the Pelicans in any matchup in the West.  We went 46-36 in a historically bad eastern conference with a fully healthy roster. We wouldn't have broken .500 games in the West especially after our post January break down. Our record vs the West is embarrassing.
washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,KingRikaru,2,Thu Jul 9 17:14:11 2015 UTC,To be fair Beal was not healthy last year.
washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,BagelsAndJewce,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:43:55 2015 UTC,Wizards couldn't even win 50 games. I don't see how anyone argues against OKC being the better team.
washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,Illesac,2,Thu Jul 9 17:14:53 2015 UTC,I think it's the dynamic. Westbrooke wants the ball while wall will feed kd/ beal till their fatties with 25+ points each and then drop a dime or more himself
washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,Gr8WallofChinatown,0,Thu Jul 9 17:34:12 2015 UTC,Is this the 3v3 and 1 tournament or are we talking NBA 5-on-5 basketball?  Westbrook couldn't win a 7 game series against a legitimate team if his life depended on it.
washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,BagelsAndJewce,2,Thu Jul 9 16:03:05 2015 UTC,He made the NBA finals and had multiple playoff series victories.
washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,aznanimedude,2,Thu Jul 9 17:15:44 2015 UTC,I think okc is in a peculiar situation where they have two guys that need the ball while Washington has a pure point guard that's eager to feed anyone that wants it. I think the tandem of wall kd is deadlier than Russell and kd and that's just from walls ability to take it to the rim like westbrooke and also dish out a mean assist while on the drive. I think Russell is an S tier offensive point but more Or less b tier in utility where wall is the reverse. Now throw Beal in the mix and your looking at those 2012 NBA finals with a potential of three mvp caliber guys trying to stay together and an org willing to drop the dime to keep them together.
washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,BagelsAndJewce,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:51:19 2015 UTC,"i'm always partial to pure point guards who pass first, but also understand that them having an ability to score as well is huge to keep defenses honest and not just drop back to prevent him passing. That said, I've never considered Westbrook a ""point guard"" per se, more of a shooting guard that wants control of the ball and so he ended up at PG."
washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,aznanimedude,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:22:06 2015 UTC,I group Westbrook and  Irving as SG's. I honestly think Pure points are what the league really needs but in this modern era all we get is ball handling SG's that can drive like no other. Which isn't bad but John is definitely showing the league how it's done. I'd say he's the best pure point in the league with only CP3 making a strong case against it and one that in the coming years will be annihilated if John continues this pace.   And because of this I believe that KD would be borderline retarded if he didn't sign with the Wiz. In OKC you can run a two headed snake but in Washington you got a damn Hydra waiting to be unleashed. I just see it hard for two players that need the ball to find success without a true distributor willing to go 0/10/25 and that is something Wall would gladly do if his team is winning.
washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,BagelsAndJewce,0,Thu Jul 9 21:18:20 2015 UTC,Boy you cray cray.  All John wall has shown is he is immature and will never command respect to and lead a team because he dougie'd in his first game.  Also Irving IS a shooting guard because everyone in the league knows LBJ is the true cog in that offense that distributes and sets up the play.

Collison/McGary >>>> Nené/Blair. Anthony Morrow/Roberson >>>> temple, sessions. Steve Adams >>>> insert backup center.  No way Wiz has a better supporting cast.

washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,Gr8WallofChinatown,2,Thu Jul 9 17:08:25 2015 UTC,How can you totally omit Beal/Porter when comparing supporting casts? Our 2nd and probably 3rd best players. Also I'm high on Ubre but can't include him yet.  What do you think a 7 game series would be like Wiz vs. Durant-less OKC? You're acting like we'd get swept
washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,SkinsWiz,3,Thu Jul 9 19:01:13 2015 UTC,"If Porter is our third best player then we obviously aren't better in supporting cast than the Thunder. Beal is clearly the best matchup but our SF vs their SF for me can't be compared since I don't know how they would match up from each other. You can't even include Oubre in yet since we don't know anything about him. I'm low on Oubre right now because I like to have rookies prove their worth. He reminds me of a Nick Young/Jeremy Lamb due to his basketball iq.  The Wiz against a KDless Thunder, we would probably lose in 6 games if their supporting cast is healthy which wasn't during their run to make the playoffs. They stretch the floor better than us which would force us to play Gooden and probably bench Gortat"
washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,kingClutch98,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:21:01 2015 UTC,"If Porter is our third best player then we obviously aren't better in supporting cast than the Thunder.   Who is the Thunder's third best player? Westbrook/Ibaka then....Kanter? Waiters? I'd rather have Otto than anyone on the Thunder outside Westbrook/Ibaka (and obv kd). How can you say we aren't 'obviously the better supporting cast' when you can't say what 3 is better?   Pg - they edge us by a hair but hard to count out JW. I think everyone would agree he'd hold his own against RW.  sg - we win that battle  sf - w/o KD who do they have? singler/morrow/roberson/waiters combo? hard to argue that's better than porter/anderson/ubre/dudley  pf/c - they probably have us in both frontcourt spots  Even if you think we'd lose in 6, that still means we'd win a couple and aren't that much worse....   Which is my entire point. OKC isn't THAT much better than us without KD (if at all). People are acting like it's black and white and if KD we're solely choosing a team based on supporting cast, OKC would be an absolute a no-brainer. And I'm saying, it shouldn't be  EDIT: we're also forgetting about Jared Dudley who should be solid"
washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,judunno5,2,Thu Jul 9 20:51:12 2015 UTC,I agree. Don't sleep on Kanter bouncing as well cause we all know how tight ass the OKC owners can be
washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,BagelsAndJewce,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:34:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  The only reason we're even talking about this is because of Lebron's decision.  Otherwise most stars stay.  However, the main reason why I see KD leaving is because it's simply too hard to win in the West."
washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,DCsportsJohnny,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:54:28 2015 UTC,I think you are underestimating how good Beal is. Yeah Russell and Wall are practically even or will be but this team is way more suited for kd than okc. The Wizards have the ability to give KD what okc denied him. He can turn back the clock get himself a ridiculous shooting guard and a pass first pure point. I'd say size is what's lacking but with KD here and the cap exploding I don't think that's a big issue. It's going to be a power struggle to sign bigs between the two contenders cavs/wiz and all the west.

If not for the John Wall hand injury, wouldn't you say we had a realistic shot to make it to the ECF?  Add Durant to that and we may have made it to the Finals.  That's the East.  There are definitely some teams on the rise like the Bucks and Pistons but those teams are still young and lack experience.  As a scorer I'd rather have Wall as my PG.  If you want Waiters over Beal you're a dumbass.  Gortat > Kanter.  The only real advantage they have over us is Ibaka.  But you don't think if he were to sign here we couldn't get a decent big man to fill that void? C'mon, players would be lining up for a chance to play with that trio."
washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,Gr8WallofChinatown,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:52:31 2015 UTC,"Even with the injury we had a shot at ECF. If we'd defended better at the end of G5 we win that, and go home with 2 games to close it out.   Agreed with you on everything else though. Westbrook is a better player than Wall for sure, but it's closer than a lot of people think and John is a better/more willing passer. Also, something you didn't mention is we'll have a better bench than OKC has currently. Porter and Humph will still be under contract, Oubre will probably be a legitimate option by then, and we'll have close to 10 mil and a MLE add a 4, a backup 5, and a couple other pieces. If KD Is smart and wants to win, he should see us as a better option, both short and long term due to our young core."
washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,ircdub,0,Thu Jul 9 16:56:31 2015 UTC,"yeah I can agree with that. If we had KD, and the Cavs had a healthy Kyrie & Love it would make for an amazing ECF."

The Thunder is stacked and is one of the best teams filled with the best talent. Why would he leave the Thunder for a huge downgrade in the Wizards?   Now we all saw the DJ fiasco... It's probably going to be worse next year with KD with us feeling screwed like the Mavs but more embarrassing.  We will have a lot of cap space next year. I want us to give Beal and extension and spend as much money getting star talent like Horford
washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,DCsportsJohnny,2,Thu Jul 9 17:01:04 2015 UTC,"Explain to me how the Wizards are a huge downgrade from the Thunder.  The Thunder are one of the best teams filled with the best talent in part because they have Durant.  OKC without KD is far from ""stacked"" when compared to the rest of the Western Conference."
washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,ircdub,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:07:50 2015 UTC,See thread I already have explained.
washingtonwizards,3cnhlr,DCsportsJohnny,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:10:22 2015 UTC,"Westbrook > Wall. Ibaka >>>>>> Humphries/Gortat. Waiters is trash. Kanter offensively >> Gortat. Collison/McGary >>>> Nené/Blair. Anthony Morrow/Roberson >>>> temple, sessions. Steve Adams >>>> insert backup center.   Westbrook is a better shooter/scorer but Wall is a better playmaker.  If you're going to give the edge to Westbrook (which I wouldn't) the difference is marginal.  And like you said, Waiters is trash.  So even if you think Westbrook is better, would you rather have a starting backcourt of Westbrook/Waiters or Wall/Beal?  I'll agree that Morrow is better than Temple/Sessions but you're excluding Otto Porter/Oubre. Morrow is the best 3pt Shooter of the group but Otto showed great improvement with extended minutes.  His 3 and D potential plus his youth should be more appealing than Morrow's trajectory.  Roberson has shown us nothing more than maybe a few glimpses here and there much like we saw with Temple early in the season.  Neither of those guys should be a factor in this.  Not to mention, Oubre has a much greater upside.  Nene will be gone by then and Ibaka is clearly better than anyone we have at that position. But really, Humphries should be compared to Collison/McGary in which case he is currently better than both of those players. He's younger and more athletic than Collison.  I like McGary going forward, but he's been injured for the majority of his time in the NBA so far and ultimately lacks any real experience.  When you've won the scoring title 4 times, I doubt having an offensive center is that high of a priority.  Gortat is better defensively and it's not like he's offensively challenged.  He averaged 12 ppg last season and is a much better passer than Kanter.   Starting PF and backup Center are the only areas where they are currently better than us.  We can address these issues in FA of '16 or potentially via a trade of Nene.  And like I mentioned in a previous post, if we can lockup a trio of Wall/Beal/Durant, players will be lining up to sign with the Wizards even if it means taking a little less money."

washingtonwizards,3cmz9x,logitaunt,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:07:48 2015 UTC,"Yes,fine,another year...but NO MORE.Randy is out of his depth the further he gets in playoffs.tightens up his rotations,and sticks too long with guys having bad nights..God,Carlusle would be oerfect! Especially with KD here."

washingtonwizards,3cmz9x,logitaunt,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:58:52 2015 UTC,"Yea.that is true.But not playing Humphries or Seraphim when Nene was struggling? 10 rebounds would have won that series,Humphries led us in rebounds per minute(led nba year before that).Randy is a career loser,stumbled into this job.Here is a question for you..would ANY OTHER TEAM hire Randy as head coach if we dropped him? Think about that one."
washingtonwizards,3cmz9x,Brim4889,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:22:22 2015 UTC,"I don't see why not. It's not like there aren't any young teams with weak defense that want to experiment with 3-and-key. Besides, what other options are there? Thibs?"
washingtonwizards,3cmz9x,Mehberry,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:47:51 2015 UTC,Well this is a logical choice so I can guarantee that Grunfeld will go out and hire Byron Scott
washingtonwizards,3cm7ce,WizOfAwesSite,2,Thu Jul 9 00:13:41 2015 UTC,Still have a feeling Wittman is going to go back to the old way of things once the regular season comes around for some reason. I can't trust him.
washingtonwizards,3cm7ce,ESPNnut,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:35:20 2015 UTC,Several good threads here on the pissibility of getting Rick Carkisle in 2016 to go with KD.
washingtonwizards,3cm7ce,DCsportsJohnny,2,Thu Jul 9 20:26:43 2015 UTC,do we really have a choice
washingtonwizards,3cllwi,DeathNinja93,12,Wed Jul 8 21:27:05 2015 UTC,"Pierce's playoff shots are all non-wizard fans really remember of the season and now he is gone. Without watching many Wizard games they probably saw Pierce as our second best player  John Wall is amazing but he doesn't shoot well. Especially in todays NBA where the three is super important it makes people really underrate John Wall.  Our off-season was actually good for us and we got underrated players but the only big name player and probably the only free agent people even know we went after we didn't get. I saw on /r/nba people saying the Wizards got nobody this offseason at all.   The only real big-name player we have is John Wall. Beal is up there but injuries and he got overhyped by /r/nba so the opinions are circling back a bit. Compare that to the Heat who have Dragic, Wade, Bosh, and Whiteside. The Cavs have Lebron. The Bucks are the young Cinderella everyone loves and they have the Greek Freak. The Bulls have a shitton of fans on /r/nba and Rose, Gasol, and Noah. And the Hawks did win 60 games last year."
washingtonwizards,3cllwi,VCURedskins,8,Wed Jul 8 22:20:38 2015 UTC,"A couple reasons.. the perception among outside fans is that Pierce was this key lynchpin to our team and they're gonna collapse without him. Unless KD comes to save us in 2016   The reality is that we got to the second round already the year before, without Pierce. Most fans don't know how outstanding Wall's play is, he has a mini-Lebron type impact in terms of being able to elevate the guys around him (on both ends). His bball IQ is on another level right now  John Wall FINALLY has numerous shooters around him at the 1-4 positions, people don't realize what is about happen.. I think he could firmly establish himself as the #2 player in the East this season. Secondly, most people don't realize that Otto Porter is a prototypical SF prospect with a lot of talent. So the perception is we got 'worse' when in fact our starting lineup will probably be better by switching Pierce for Porter. Also I don't think a lot of people realize what type of player an aggressive Beal is (if he truly steps into that role next season). Basically I think our young core gets underrated.. teams like Milwaukee and Orlando have some shiny new toys, but some of those guys are still years from breaking out if ever. Washington already has a core of playoff-tested youngsters who are on the verge of breaking out right now, and not many people have noticed.  I like being under the radar, the Wiz are gonna run trains on teams next season."
washingtonwizards,3cllwi,ireddit270,8,Thu Jul 9 02:16:26 2015 UTC,My belief is that we are not underrated when it comes to people who understand Basketball. But to 90% of the NBA fanbase that gets most of their Basketball exposure from playing 2K well when you factor those shit heads in well then yea no one talks about The Wizards.
washingtonwizards,3cllwi,Dc2ark,15,Wed Jul 8 22:18:25 2015 UTC,"Meh people can sleep on us I don't really care. I find the Heat and Bulls massively overrated. We're a good playoff team that could legitimately make it to ECF if it weren't for Wall's broken wrist. The Hawks are pretty average for a playoff team as well. They also lost one of their best players. They way I see it, if PG13 can go back to his former self, it will be us, Pacers, and Cavs most likely to be in the ECF"
washingtonwizards,3cllwi,plasmamaker,9,Wed Jul 8 21:56:41 2015 UTC,"I think you are sleeping on the Heat. With everyone back, that is going to be a good team."
washingtonwizards,3cllwi,happyflappypancakes,10,Wed Jul 8 22:15:21 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with you - barring injuries, my god that's a murderer's row by East standards:    Dragic, who's had time to get acclimated to the team & offense Wade, playing for a contract Deng and Winslow, each able to play either forward position  Bosh, freshly energized after seeing his Raptor cousins do things in Jurassic World Whiteside, who's probably spending his Wednesday evening low key taking over some corners in Miami cause why not"
washingtonwizards,3cllwi,blackjackarcher,3,Thu Jul 9 01:51:50 2015 UTC,lol on bosh but I agree Miami will be no pushover this year
washingtonwizards,3cllwi,Ai2Foom,2,Thu Jul 9 03:25:52 2015 UTC,Yeah they will be a good team obviously but I still think we are a better team than they are.
washingtonwizards,3cllwi,plasmamaker,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:20:57 2015 UTC,I think it is close honestly. They still have two HOF caliber players as well as a great PG. Throw in an up and coming center and you got a great playoff team.

Cleveland,..who else? Atlanta lost Milsap,demare Carroll gone Korvers injuries. Chicago..new college coach? Toronto lost lou williams,exposed in playoffs Indiana..Hibbert,Stephenson gone. Miami? ,Wade able to play all year? Does Bosch make THAT much difference? If only we would move Randy out..maybe he'll  get nailed on a Cosby deal,or child porn thing"

washingtonwizards,3cllwi,wafflestoompa,13,Fri Jul 10 00:06:57 2015 UTC,"From an outsiders point of view, I will give you a few reasons why people are doubting you guys.   You play in Lebron's Conference which basicaly means no finals for you. You lost Pierce who was killing it in the playoffs. (I believe that Otto will be great but it would have been more reassuring if you guys had been able to keep Pierce) The collapse at the end of last season Wittman (Basicaly are you guys getting playoff wittman or season wittman) Teams like CLE, CHI, ATL are probably going to get the top 3 seeds while TOR, IND, MIL, BOS, MIA and ORL battle for the other 5 playoff spots.   You guys will 100% be in the playoffs but it is hard to say where and against who."
washingtonwizards,3cllwi,Zach_LaVine,8,Wed Jul 8 22:07:27 2015 UTC,"Just to play Wizard's advocate:   You play in Lebron's Conference which basicaly means no finals for you.   He's got the East for another year or 2 but he's getting older. Can't reign forever.   You lost Pierce who was killing it in the playoffs. (I believe that Otto will be great but it would have been more reassuring if you guys had been able to keep Pierce)   Not as big of a deal. I loved him but he's getting very old and can't defend anymore. His presence was helpful but on the court he's slowing down.    The collapse at the end of last season   We were undefeated in the playoffs until Wall hurt his hand. And we weren't beating bad teams, the Raps and Hawks are good.    Wittman (Basicaly are you guys getting playoff wittman or season wittman)   Yep.    Teams like CLE, CHI, ATL are probably going to get the top 3 seeds while TOR, IND, MIL, BOS, MIA and ORL battle for the other 5 playoff spots.   Cleveland is the only team that is clearly better. Atlanta also will probably finish higher in the standings because they're a good regular season team, but the Bulls - they have a new coach and although their team is solid they have very obvious weaknesses. The rest of the teams are not better than the Wizards.    You guys will 100% be in the playoffs but it is hard to say where and against who   Hard to say for anyone. People assume GSW will be the 1 seed next year but what about the Spurs and Thunder? People assumed Cleveland and Chicago would get the 1 and 2 seeds this season and the Hawks got the 1 seed instead. People assumed the Pelicans were still a year away and they got in. The fact of the matter is we don't know how it'll play out. As it stands, the Wiz should finish anywhere from 2-5 in the East and in my opinion that should garner some respect, but to many outside fans it doesn't."
washingtonwizards,3cllwi,Boymankid,4,Thu Jul 9 07:39:53 2015 UTC,"yea this season is much more about the development of beal, wall and porter. no paul pierce to lean on in late in the game and maybe a nene that is done leaves questions. i look forward to the season as the team seems to be taking a different approach. but regression is possible if beal or porter don't play like they did in the playoffs."
washingtonwizards,3cllwi,ruffus4life,3,Wed Jul 8 22:25:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks, Zach. Pretty spot on. We we terrible for the last month or so of the regular season last year."

washingtonwizards,3cllwi,logitaunt,7,Thu Jul 9 04:00:34 2015 UTC,"I think all the non-Wizards fans right now just look at Washington as the team that Kevin Durant will save. They think we're just stalling and waiting for him. I wouldn't mind having him, but I wouldn't mind winning without him either. But I mostly think we're underrated because we're classic underachievers. We never utilize all our talent properly, the Wizard draft picks usually get buried (we should be amazed Otto was finally given a chance). I don't think they are directly underrating our players, but indirectly underrating great players like Wall who got snubbed from the all NBA team because the Wizards, sad to admit it, were a mediocre franchise in terms of management for many years. That being said, we've made so good moves, so I'm hoping for top 3 and ECF if Wittman gets his shit together and there are no ridiculous injuries."
washingtonwizards,3cllwi,limiter_remove,3,Thu Jul 9 00:13:24 2015 UTC,"Depth unproven/meh, Wittman, Otto gelling into starter role, Wittman, Nene and possibly Gortat aging, adapting to our new starting PF, Wittman, and new guys like Dudley having something to prove.  Also, Wittman."

People are giving the Bucks too much dap but we're not ready yet to make any noise outside of the 1st round. On paper I think your roster is easily Top 4.

Also, casual fans who haven't kept up on the veteran acquisitions the Wizards made only really know about Pierce leaving so I guess it looks bad at first glance.  Nothing bad about being underrated though, the team is going to be just as good no matter how badly their underrated."
washingtonwizards,3cllwi,Brown_behemoth,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:32:17 2015 UTC,"I feel like it partially has to do with how people perceive Otto.

With Pierce gone, everyone thinks we'll struggle at the 3 but I am convinced that now that Otto's got some confidence people pretty early on will come around to our side."

Seriously though, this makes me feel so much better that the Wiz have a core locked up for the near future and a plan that goes beyond trying to build a contender on the fly every summer. Wall, Beal, and Otto are draft picks. Gortat was a timely trade. Free agency can be a cruel, cruel bitch and under Ted the Wiz are only putting themselves at its mercy in one spectacular case."
washingtonwizards,3cmrtr,SonOfSkipBaeless,2,Thu Jul 9 03:17:04 2015 UTC,"With the Spurs looking to get him, and him obviously being more interested in championships than money, I don't think he's coming.   That being said, I think he's exactly what the Wizards need to make up for the loss of Pierce. Some of these players fulfill some of the qualities that the team is losing from Pierce (shot range, vet presence), but West is the only player I am aware of on the market that truly comes even close to replacing a lot of the qualities Pierce offered Washington.   Shot pretty well from farther out, 48% of attempted shots were past 16 feet, and within 16 feet and the three point line he shot above 50%. He did shoot only 20% from 3 point which is a bummer.   Would be nice to have him on the squad tho.  EDIT: Now I'm not sure if this post was sarcastic because I'm just now seeing this news."
washingtonwizards,3cku3m,baobao3,3,Wed Jul 8 18:16:13 2015 UTC,"Lol he is the definition of a consolation prize, the real prize was David West"
washingtonwizards,3cku3m,blast0ise,2,Wed Jul 8 19:10:51 2015 UTC,"Let's be realistic, he's a consolation prize. Does that make him bad? Nah, not really, we did need a backup 2. But the dude is by all reports a long range Jarrett Jack, hoisting bad 3's (shot something like 34% from 3) and isn't exactly a spring chicken."
washingtonwizards,3cku3m,Mehberry,3,Wed Jul 8 18:52:47 2015 UTC,Paul Pierce went from 47% of his fg in Brooklyn being assisted to 57% in Washington. I think Anderson's ratio of catch and shoot jumpers (which he shot very well on) to pull-ups can be similarly tweaked -- maybe even moreso given that the Nets' offense degraded under Hollins.
washingtonwizards,3cku3m,SonOfSkipBaeless,2,Wed Jul 8 21:19:33 2015 UTC,"It doesn't say he's not a consolation prize.  Just that he's also halfway decent.  But yeah, totally a consolation prize."

washingtonwizards,3ch20u,judunno5,17,Wed Jul 8 14:52:08 2015 UTC,Why are we hating this move so much?   He can back-up Beal at the 2 and he can play the 3.  With Pierce gone and Butler not expected to come back...this signing makes some sense to me.  I love Martell but Wittman clearly doesn't.    $4m might be too rich but it's only a 1-year deal.
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,judunno5,6,Tue Jul 7 21:34:31 2015 UTC,I think Wittman liked Martell. He played him over Porter many times after Martell came back from injury. Then playoff Wittman came out in the Toronto series.
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,Shaidester,2,Tue Jul 7 21:55:43 2015 UTC,What gives you that impression?  Martell barely got any minutes. Martell wasn't the same last year but Wittman never gave him a shot by consistently giving him minutes after he returned from injury.
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,judunno5,3,Tue Jul 7 22:49:17 2015 UTC,"I love Martell, he's one of my fav wizards, but he looked like hot shit last year when he did get minutes.  I'm sure he was rusty but you have to earn your PT."
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,schwoogiejoe24,3,Wed Jul 8 02:59:16 2015 UTC,What during the last game of the season against the Cavs? He had plenty of opportunities to try to break out of the slump but couldn't consistently.
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,Shaidester,3,Wed Jul 8 03:12:47 2015 UTC,I personally think we needed more help elsewhere. When Nene inevitably gets hurt we are going to have absolutely no one to back up Gortat (assuming Nene even buys in to playing center)
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,ragtime_sam,10,Tue Jul 7 21:45:17 2015 UTC,"Our bench is looking a lot better, I like our options so far....just hope it doesn't mean that Oubre will be stuck to the bench"

washingtonwizards,3ch20u,schwoogiejoe24,2,Wed Jul 8 03:00:55 2015 UTC,Agreed.  I'm still convinced that he isn't NBA ready seeing how he wasn't ready to start at Kansas.
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,judunno5,2,Wed Jul 8 14:53:07 2015 UTC,yeah I don't think there were many league-ready players available outside of the top 6 or 7 picks (other than winslow who fell too far imo)

washingtonwizards,3ch20u,Mehberry,5,Wed Jul 8 01:46:00 2015 UTC,he occasionally has moments where he thinks he is kobe
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,fimmas94,3,Wed Jul 8 03:25:59 2015 UTC,"he's a solid defender, catch and shoot 3 point shooter   I'm sold. He gets wing rotation minutes and feasts on all the corner 3's he wants."
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,EvilGeniusMusik,9,Wed Jul 8 16:36:42 2015 UTC,"Fuckkk yes, bring on the shooters"
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,yaboymattyk,7,Tue Jul 7 21:54:01 2015 UTC,Ok I think we're good with the backcourt and sf positions. Can we focus on PF please.  I will admit though our bench is looking impressive this offseason. Probably the best bench we have had with the Wall era.  Edit: Did this eat our MLE or no? I think our MLE is like 5 million right?
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,Shaidester,7,Tue Jul 7 21:48:19 2015 UTC,They probably gonna sign Gooden to the vet minimum and call it a day.
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,KingRikaru,2,Tue Jul 7 21:51:05 2015 UTC,"Yep, that'll be 15 guys with Aaron White stashed overseas. Ignoring that most of these guys can play multiple positions...      PG: Wall, Sessions, Temple SG: Beal, Neal, Oubre SF: Otto, Anderson, Martell PF: Hump, Dudley, Blair C: Gortat, Nene, Gooden"
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,3,Wed Jul 8 14:15:10 2015 UTC,Seeing temple play point makes my heart attack...everyone stay healthy pls
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,blast0ise,6,Wed Jul 8 15:13:34 2015 UTC,Wiz got some shooters!
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,SonOfSkipBaeless,12,Tue Jul 7 22:13:36 2015 UTC,John Wall 20 assist avg confirmed
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,yaboymattyk,6,Tue Jul 7 22:16:27 2015 UTC,They're going all in with Porter playing small ball 4.
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,KingRikaru,3,Tue Jul 7 21:30:29 2015 UTC,I would guess it's Dudley before Ottoman
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,2,Wed Jul 8 14:15:23 2015 UTC,Probably but if Otto can bulk up a little he can probably handle it
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,Boymankid,2,Wed Jul 8 15:18:41 2015 UTC,I think this is a good assumption
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,m25l,3,Wed Jul 8 05:41:49 2015 UTC,I would much rather have picked up a young player or signed Seraphin.  I don't think we need a 3rd string SG at 4 mil.
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,salamanderman10,3,Tue Jul 7 22:01:02 2015 UTC,3rd string? Behind who?
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,Virulentt,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:17:03 2015 UTC,"Brad beal, Gary Neal."
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,Virulentt,5,Tue Jul 7 22:26:06 2015 UTC,Alan is better than Gary
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,Virulentt,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:36:21 2015 UTC,"Based on what? Defense yes, offense no.  Also he was misused last year.  If you saw him on the Spurs you'd much rather have Neal. That dude is going to be a weapon for john."
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,Virulentt,5,Wed Jul 8 01:49:16 2015 UTC,Gary was great in a specific role for pop off the bench. He doesn't have size. Alan is the better pure shooter and has experience that Gary doesn't
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,4,Wed Jul 8 01:54:14 2015 UTC,FGM-A   FG% 3PM-A   3P%  2.8-6.8 .407    1.1-3.1 .346      3.6-8.7 .418    1.4-3.6 .381  Who is the better pure shooter? player A or player B?  A is Alan Anderson & B is Gary Neal.   Like seriously if you've seen the difference between their shot mechanics you would know who the better pure shooter is.  Neals offensive game is much more fluid than AA's  Alan anderson is a capable shooter  But Neal is much more consistent.   As far as experience goes... Neal has 310 games played to Alan Anderson's 287 games played.  Neal also has 45 postseason games compared to Alan Andersons  18 postseason games played.  Defensively AA is better but Neal packs more of a punch off the bench. AA seems almost redundant to Jared Dudley in my opinion but we got JD for free so no complaints.  Neal has shot well but Milwaukee and charlotte last year were over using him (why his numbers fell down)  So in no way is AA a better pure shooter or more experienced player.   Neal is also from Towson. Another reason for you to hope he gets more minutes!
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:50:26 2015 UTC,"I said AA is the more experienced player because he has been in the league longer. I didn't know he had a couple season where he only played a handful of games. Also you seem pretty confidence that Neal's shooting numbers are gonna bounce back after a career low season. You said they were overusing him but he played on average one minute more per game last season than he did his previous seasons. He also was shooting less, so it's not like overshooting caused the percentage drop."
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,jeffsays,2,Wed Jul 8 16:03:38 2015 UTC,"It's not how much he was shooting that caused the % to drop it was HOW.  They were trying to have him create for himself off the bench and force himself into the game.  He is a solid offensive player but he is not a primary bench scorer. The PG's he played with when he struggled were guys who are not willing passers.   Then he went to minny and he did alright.   Also Charlotte was just awful last year and had Zero three point shooters. He was most likely the ""best three point shooter on that team so added defensive pressure to the only shooter on the floor doesn't help.   But since he didint stink it up in minny I have confidence he can improve on last year."
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,m25l,2,Wed Jul 8 16:12:44 2015 UTC,We gave Anderson more money for a reason
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,DWood10,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:15:52 2015 UTC,"Neal took a hometown discount too.  I mean Alan is a good player, but for roster needs... I think we have other holes to address.   I think Neal will have a better season but if Alan shows up and proves me wrong! IDC as long as that turns into wins."
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,John_Wall_Star,2,Wed Jul 8 14:20:51 2015 UTC,"We have 15 guys on the roster (assuming Gooden signs/signed). The three who will most frequently be inactive (in my estimation) are Oubre, Temple, and Blair. That leaves 12 guys, about 9-10 of which will play daily in the regular season. Witt will probably go with the hot hand between Anderson and Neal from week to week."
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,LooseCannon13,3,Wed Jul 8 14:29:11 2015 UTC,I think he jumps in front of Neal right?
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,hattmarrington,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:58:17 2015 UTC,I think the front office is trying to pick up more shooters and wings to force Randy to play more small-ball lineups.
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,4,Wed Jul 8 05:40:01 2015 UTC,I like the signing but I was hoping to nab Televotic. Do we cut Blair and re-sign Gooden?
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,pakilicious,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:32:12 2015 UTC,Gooden has already been signed.
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,devotedhero,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:46:29 2015 UTC,"He hasn't been signed. We are at 14 guys without Gooden. So the last spot...unless we trade some guys....is either going to Gooden, possibly Aaron White depending on how he looks in SL, or will be left empty."
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,whitebrucewayne,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:40:10 2015 UTC,or Dez Wells.
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,leo2k2ndc,0,Wed Jul 8 16:16:53 2015 UTC,Can you provide a source on that?
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,jeffsays,3,Wed Jul 8 14:17:19 2015 UTC,I don't get it...and $4M?  Does this limit any more potential moves?
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,Shaidester,4,Tue Jul 7 21:30:17 2015 UTC,It's a one year deal. We have a loooooot of expirings in 2016. That means we can offer a max to KD and if we don't get KD we can offer contracts to consolation prizes.
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,leo2k2ndc,2,Wed Jul 8 00:33:32 2015 UTC,I think we still have room for one more signing right?
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,Plutarch_,8,Tue Jul 7 21:30:00 2015 UTC,"I think that brings us to 15 unless I'm mistaken  1.Wall  2.Beal 3. Porter 4. Nene 5. Gortat 6. Sessions 7. Humphries 8. Oubre 9. Gooden 10. Dudley 11. Anderson 12. Neal 13. Webster 14. Blair 15. Temple  edit: It is scary that unless we always go small with our second unit, that Gooden or Blair may get major PT."
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,leo2k2ndc,4,Tue Jul 7 21:45:48 2015 UTC,Gooden isn't signed yet.
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,Plutarch_,3,Tue Jul 7 23:58:58 2015 UTC,Isn't Bynum still on the roster?
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,Mehberry,8,Tue Jul 7 21:52:19 2015 UTC,Nope
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,roboto-sama,3,Tue Jul 7 21:59:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not too sure Blair will make the cut. I see the last spot going to a new player we sign with the remaining $1.5 million left from the MLE, a summer league standout like Dez Wells, or I think we resign Seraphin. As you stated we don't have a traditional back up center and I think Ernie may be wary of having only Humphries and Nene (who will likely be traded by the end of the year) as our backups. I personally think they are capable so I wouldn't mind us letting Seraphin walk."
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,nicknamebucky,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:29:15 2015 UTC,Blair got money on him though. I don't see a lot of buy outs in NBA without a trade
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,Boymankid,2,Tue Jul 7 22:49:32 2015 UTC,We could use the stretch provision it wouldn't cost us much.
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,PrinceOfTheHamsters,2,Tue Jul 7 23:44:41 2015 UTC,2 years 4 mil seems like too little to waste it on...  We could always tack him on to the end of the deal if we are doing the other team a favor...  But since we already have martell (who we should get rid of first) I dont see us getting rid of blair unfortunately.
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,kmhokies35,2,Wed Jul 8 04:54:19 2015 UTC,I'm fine with getting a backup shooter.   But...is this really the best guy we could get?
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,Coast_watcher,2,Wed Jul 8 01:46:25 2015 UTC,I was kinda hoping we'd go after Teletovic...
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,dopeitsduice,2,Wed Jul 8 02:46:54 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, I had no idea who this is. After looking up his stats, videos and  stuff, 6'6 220 is what we need coming off the bench at a 2 or 3 position.   Good move overall"
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,dopeitsduice,2,Wed Jul 8 13:49:32 2015 UTC,"That's awesome, AA has always been one of my favorite 3&D players. Good team guy, capable of scoring off the bench, can play the 2 or the 3, etc. solid move Ernie"

washingtonwizards,3ch20u,jeffsays,5,Tue Jul 7 21:34:09 2015 UTC,IMO Butler is def gone now.  Do we have any options with Webster aside from trading him since he has a few years left on his contract?  I wish Wittman would just play him more.  He's got a stroke!  Blair's probably gone now too.
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,youngsaiyan,6,Tue Jul 7 21:36:05 2015 UTC,Eh Webster is not an NBA caliber player anymore.
washingtonwizards,3ch20u,youngsaiyan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:11:25 2015 UTC,Isn't Martell Webster on the roster already? I feel like we just signed another Martell Webster. Is he sure its ALAN and not RYAN Anderson?
washingtonwizards,3cgdvh,judunno5,10,Tue Jul 7 18:27:53 2015 UTC,"tl;dr Wizards bit:  Winners: Second-Level Contenders Nailing the Little Things  Washington Wizards: There’s nothing fancy here, but they got Jared Dudley for nothing and Gary Neal for the biannual exception — just over $2 million. Dudley did great work in Milwaukee as a small-ball power forward, but he’s not a full Paul Pierce replacement. He doesn’t have a legacy of big-balls shot-making, and he can’t create shots off the dribble or from the post when a possession is dying.  But these are smart signings for a team making them on the regular these days. They are one of the few teams left who might realistically spend the full midlevel, and with West off to the Spurs, they have to move on to their second choice."
washingtonwizards,3cgdvh,SonOfSkipBaeless,12,Tue Jul 7 18:28:45 2015 UTC,The most positive things Grantland's ever said about the Wizards FO haha. We're moving on up!
washingtonwizards,3cgdvh,leo2k2ndc,3,Tue Jul 7 18:30:19 2015 UTC,"It is amazing how good of moves, at least on paper, Ernie has made the last 3-4 years. My only gripe is how we undervalue draft picks, 1st and 2nds, but we really haven't done anything with picks out the top 3. If we could find a solid young PF or C, our roster would be set for a while."
washingtonwizards,3cfbii,WizOfAwesSite,8,Tue Jul 7 13:49:36 2015 UTC,Only 2 I'm interested in is Teletovic & Morris.

washingtonwizards,3cgjoo,ircdub,3,Tue Jul 7 19:52:34 2015 UTC,"The truth is filling a rotation in around a big free agent is tough.  The Spurs sacrificed a lot of their depth to add LaMarcus Aldridge. The Mavs are puzzling over filling out their rotation after signing Wes Matthews and Deandre Jordan. The Heat's supporting cast in the first year of the big 3 was ass. The Rockets sacrificed a lot of depth to sign Dwight Howard and make room to take a shot at Chris Bosh.  Completing the team will likely take more than off-season.  For year one, though: The Wizards have their 2016 first-round pick. Martell Webster's unguaranteed contract for 2016-7 could be useful in trading for a player. If he has a good season and wants to stay, the Wiz will have Jared Dudley's and Kris Humphries's full Bird rights to re-sign them and give them raises (or sign-and-trade them). Beyond that, though, hopefully the right veterans decide to hop on the Wiz bandwagon and maybe they find a diamond in the rough who takes a cheap ""prove-it"" deal to demonstrate his value on a good team to get paid later."

washingtonwizards,3cebw2,judunno5,2,Tue Jul 7 14:07:55 2015 UTC,Good point.  It's an interesting debate...  Do we wait for Kevin Durant who could have the Wiz in the Eastern Conference Finals every year but may not come...  Or do we try to get Markieff Morris who I think would elevate us to top 3 in the East?
washingtonwizards,3cebw2,pakilicious,2,Tue Jul 7 17:33:48 2015 UTC,"Adding Kieff would make it more enticing for KD to come here. I don't think KD is really in for the money - I think he wants to go to a team that will contend for championships. It also helps that we're his hometown, something I think he cherishes.  I have friends in the world of basketball who are close with KD - he is allllways in DC when he can be."

His actions speak for themselves.

washingtonwizards,3ccdvr,devilknight,19,Mon Jul 6 20:33:42 2015 UTC,As a Wiz fan it's kind of weird to even have guys consider us as a destination so I'll take it. Shows how much we've improved to have a guy like West have us down as a top option. Good luck David
washingtonwizards,3ccdvr,Boymankid,5,Mon Jul 6 21:21:41 2015 UTC,i would like to send a shout out to Pauly P. thanks for coming dc for a year and showing some other old bucks we got something cookin in dc.
washingtonwizards,3ccdvr,ruffus4life,11,Mon Jul 6 22:59:50 2015 UTC,It's fine I didn't want him anyways. Who needs him when we have Nene?
washingtonwizards,3ccdvr,VCURedskins,3,Mon Jul 6 21:04:41 2015 UTC,West is probably better than Nene at this point but they are fairly similar players. West shoots it really well from midrange.   I am just happy they didn't sign a multiyear deal with him and reduce our flexibility down the road.
washingtonwizards,3ccdvr,pine_straw,6,Mon Jul 6 21:08:02 2015 UTC,He is much better offensively than Nene. I wanted to see him and John Wall pick and pops so bad.
washingtonwizards,3ccdvr,VCURedskins,2,Mon Jul 6 21:10:27 2015 UTC,On the bright side maybe not having West will dissuade Wittman from long 2s a bit.

washingtonwizards,3ccdvr,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,7,Mon Jul 6 20:47:01 2015 UTC,Yeah it's a bummer but not unexpected. This is a reasonable move on his part.

washingtonwizards,3cck5u,judunno5,2,Mon Jul 6 22:10:01 2015 UTC,I like Dorrell. He's shown he can be a knockdown 3point shooter and he played some 4 in Portland.  He'd be nice but idk if we can get him. Perfect fit tho.

washingtonwizards,3cck5u,pakilicious,3,Tue Jul 7 21:33:39 2015 UTC,"The more he gets brought up, the more I like the idea of Dorrell Wright.  Good catch and shoot player (who's hit close to 40% of his corner 3s throughout his career), decent rebounder (as far as rebounding rate goes), but just a fair defender despite being fairly lengthy. There's also this from an article from when he signed with Portland >""I know what I can do. I know what I can bring. But I see myself as a guy who comes in off the bench; knocking down threes, being a stretch-four."" Both he and Dudley have the potential to play the 2, 3, and small ball 4 for small streches in our offense, giving us a lot of flexibility in case of injury."
washingtonwizards,3cck5u,bhotep,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:36:00 2015 UTC,I think the nets player is our best option. He shot 32% from beyond the arc but Wall can change that. He is a true modern PF
washingtonwizards,3cbqn2,baobao3,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:54:18 2015 UTC,"This is a very optimistic read, and it makes me feel great about both signings. We've spent a lot of time over the last few seasons asking why we don't shoot more threes but really outside of ariza and Beal I don't think we've had guys that love to shoot the 3 in the first place. In fact it seems like we've taken journeymen shooters and expected them to start shooting and hitting a tonne of threes just because Wall is on the floor.   I'm excited to see what this team can do with real shooters. I still worry that if Wall goes down then the whole team will plummet but I guess sometimes it's not bad to gamble everything on the strength of your franchise guy."

washingtonwizards,3c2vvo,tiweav01,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:45:20 2015 UTC,If we get West I anticipate a lot less Dudley at the 4. The big rotation will be Gortat/West and Hump/Nene. Hump and Nene would basically be interchangeable at center but probably mostly Nene because of his physicality.

That said, how often do you see him doing anything else? He doesn't seem to have much of an outside shot, you don't see him pulling rebounds consistently, and you never see him with a clutch pass or moving the ball. In fact, he seems to get a bit fumbly when defense is pressing.  He just seems like a single-dimensional player to me. Basically, I could see us upgrading on him."
washingtonwizards,3c2czy,faint-smile,0,Wed Jul 8 02:22:32 2015 UTC,now that DJ backed out of Dallas it's likely Kevin will sign there

washingtonwizards,3c2ju6,Mehberry,4,Sat Jul 4 04:40:41 2015 UTC,"Blair is a negative-value asset, meaning that we would need to include something in the trade more valuable than Blair (like, a future draft pick) in order to get him off the roster. And we would get zero in return.   Think of him as Mini-Nene -- we are just going to let his $2m contract play out this year because there's not much else we can do. Maybe eventually we buy him out because we want the roster spot, but there's no point in doing that now."

He seems to generally get along with everyone, especially John, and he's good at fouling which is a good thing to have when you play a Deandre Jordan, Dwight Howard, etc.  If anyone is willing to part with a real asset, like a legit backup wing or a trade exception, then go for it."
washingtonwizards,3c2ju6,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,3,Sat Jul 4 12:01:07 2015 UTC,"There were a couple games he got in there and it looked like he was trying to get his under the basket. Fighting teammates for rebounds. Really turned me off to Blair, especially since the rest of the team clicks so well."

washingtonwizards,3c0xc8,ARetroNinja,5,Fri Jul 3 19:28:57 2015 UTC,Also if we play Neal with the first unit it gives john a good weapon and allows the offense to run the beak with the second unit.  Also if we go super small playing Beal and Neal (noooice) provides excellent spacing.

Jared Dudley is a true stretch-4, and Gary Neal is a 'tweener (PG/SG) - and West is a pure 4, with the ability to hit long twos from anywhere inside the arc.

washingtonwizards,3c1pft,oglefro,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:21:08 2015 UTC,"The Jared Dudley signing should help ease the hurt of losing Paul Pierce   This is the key right here:   He can shoot the 3 well, his 38% will go up playing with Wall. Decent defender, certainly better than PP, who was getting a little old at that end. Good veteran presence, everyone likes him, and he helped the Bucks young squad mature and he can do the same thing to our youngins, especially Otto the Blotto.    Great read once again guys, keep up the good work."

washingtonwizards,3c0o4v,SonOfSkipBaeless,10,Fri Jul 3 18:15:29 2015 UTC,"So everyone has appropriate expectations of how this will work:  A trade exception is created when teams make a trade that is uneven in salary. The value of the exception is equal to the difference in money. Teams can absorb that amount of salary in a trade using the exception. Exceptions cannot be traded, combined, or used with a player. They expire after one year.  We will trade Seraphin to a team that will absorb him with a trade exception. This will create a trade exception that we can use. We will then get a player using that exception, either this offseason or next. We used this process with Humphries and Blair last year (from an exception created by the Ariza sign and trade), and Dudley this year (Miller-Sessions trade). We will not trade Seraphin for picks or players."

washingtonwizards,3by125,isestrex,9,Fri Jul 3 02:33:29 2015 UTC,I like this move if we can get him. The pick and pop with Wall would be ridiculous. But the other team is San Antonio...

washingtonwizards,3by125,isestrex,2,Fri Jul 3 02:54:55 2015 UTC,This gives me more of a reason to root for the Spurs in the Aldrige sweepstakes
washingtonwizards,3by125,FucklessPornSharks,6,Fri Jul 3 15:01:29 2015 UTC,question is...does he start right away?
washingtonwizards,3by125,dopeitsduice,6,Fri Jul 3 02:43:16 2015 UTC,I think he does.
washingtonwizards,3by125,pakilicious,5,Fri Jul 3 07:52:44 2015 UTC,He starts over Nene without a doubt. This would be huge for us

The rest of the 4 minutes go to Humphries and Dudley (who will also get mins at the 3).  Nene moves to a backup C role, basically coming in whenever Marcin needs a blow.   That's how I see it anyway. Gives us a lot of versatility and keeps everyone reasonably happy."

washingtonwizards,3by125,andrewchi,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:17:57 2015 UTC,"Here is an interesting stat from last season (courtesy b-ball ref): he took ~660 shot attempts from 2P range, about 46% of those shots were long 2s (between 16ft and 3P Line), and he went .502 at that range. I don't know what to make of that, obviously shooting .502 is great - but know that he's not a 3pt shooter.  How do you guys feel about this through the next off-season if we did acquire West:   Acquire West for reasonable price (he got paid 12M last year) Make sure to leave space to allow for big 2016 FA signing Do not re-sign Pierce Acquire a 5 for reasonable price"
washingtonwizards,3by125,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,2,Fri Jul 3 03:14:38 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry about leaving space for 2016 FA. Nene, Martell, and Blair are 20 million coming off the books and the cap is rising like 40 mil."

washingtonwizards,3by125,pakilicious,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:21:19 2015 UTC,Would this affect next year's free agency at all?
washingtonwizards,3by125,jeffsays,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:55:38 2015 UTC,I would imagine that it would be a one year deal with a second year team option.
washingtonwizards,3by125,pakilicious,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:12:37 2015 UTC,That would be ideal for the wiz but since he's 34 he might be looking for a longer guaranteed contract
washingtonwizards,3by125,httr20,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:11:00 2015 UTC,"One thing I worry about if Nene isn't starting is that we love our ""edge,"" and David West is as tough a player as any in the league. Not to mention he also has game."
washingtonwizards,3bz24a,Rbk703,6,Fri Jul 3 08:46:45 2015 UTC,"We don't know what the starting lineup will be until a month from now, when all the dust has cleared and we know who went where - David West could be our starting PF for all we know, as he's made his final two as us and the Spurs."
washingtonwizards,3bz24a,skinsballr,7,Fri Jul 3 10:23:01 2015 UTC,David West would be it man. This team would be so freaking good if we add him.
washingtonwizards,3bz24a,TophMasterFlex,5,Fri Jul 3 13:21:47 2015 UTC,allowing nene to fully switch to back up center would be great.
washingtonwizards,3bz24a,ruffus4life,5,Fri Jul 3 18:14:10 2015 UTC,I don't think he wants to play the 5.
washingtonwizards,3bz24a,TophMasterFlex,7,Fri Jul 3 18:17:39 2015 UTC,i don't think it matters. and honestly if nene is playing more than 20 min a game next season something bad has went wrong or nene got younger.
washingtonwizards,3bz24a,ruffus4life,4,Fri Jul 3 18:21:03 2015 UTC,"Why are we so loathe to put Humphries at that spot.Did he rape Wittman's wife,or Ted Leonsis son? Humphries was our top rebounder per minutes played, spaces the floor,reliable hitting open jumper top of key to space floor, doesnt clog lane like Nene did to inhibit Gortat. Let Nene go in with second unit,helps faciliatate,can give some driving offense,better with that group. Couldnt understand why Witt-less-man kept starting that group,and wouldn't play Humphries when 10-15 rebounds might have won that Atlanta series. West will probably go to Spurs anyway.. Pop or Randy? Hmmmmmm."
washingtonwizards,3bz24a,DCsportsJohnny,5,Fri Jul 3 16:43:17 2015 UTC,I do agree Humphries should have gotten a shot but Drew Gooden was the one that took his spot towards the end of the season.
washingtonwizards,3bz24a,pakilicious,2,Fri Jul 3 18:13:32 2015 UTC,"BUT...when Drew,who I loved,got cold last few Atlanta games... Where was Humphries? When Nene shit the bed vs. Atlanta..where was Humphries? And now,we are looking to put someone older,less healthy,more expensive in his place...just Don't  get it"
washingtonwizards,3bz24a,DCsportsJohnny,2,Fri Jul 3 20:15:48 2015 UTC,Wittman doesn't make adjustments well at all. He pretty much stuck with the same rotation game 1 of the raptors until game 6 of the Hawks unless injuries forced him to.
washingtonwizards,3bz24a,VCURedskins,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:43:02 2015 UTC,he cant go to the spurs if they sign lma.
washingtonwizards,3bz24a,kingClutch98,5,Fri Jul 3 18:48:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah... I see you guys as a perfect fit for David West, honestly. You guys are scrappy enough to remind me of Pacer's playstyle with him."
washingtonwizards,3bz24a,Stank3,5,Fri Jul 3 14:56:05 2015 UTC,Lol we have no assets to get Gallo
washingtonwizards,3bz24a,Mehberry,2,Fri Jul 3 15:55:20 2015 UTC,"David West, once the Spurs sign LMA"
washingtonwizards,3bz24a,ireddit270,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:37:32 2015 UTC,looking good so far!
washingtonwizards,3bz24a,dabarassak,2,Sat Jul 4 18:54:07 2015 UTC,"Why is everyone considering Dudley playing the 4? In my opinion, since he is 6' 7"", he should play the 3. He is very good at shooting the 3, so I see why he can be a good stretch 4 but he's too short to rebound. I would rather see Otto(inch taller, longer wingspan) play the 4. But I hope we can get David West, he'd be nice as a stretch 4."
washingtonwizards,3bz24a,Lamborghini_ENTador,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:33:15 2015 UTC,Well Otto is a stick. So height doesn't matter as much as weight and Post defense IQ.  Otto has been a perimeter player his whole life so if he had to guard guys with 20-40 pounds on him he'd be Bar-B-Que chicken down low.  Dudley has actual experience palying stretch 4 with Milwaukee last season that's why everyone brings it up.
washingtonwizards,3bz24a,oglefro,0,Sat Jul 4 04:14:46 2015 UTC,"The Warriors just won a championship with Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala playing the 4 a lot, who are both between 6'6 and 6'8"
washingtonwizards,3bz24a,Boymankid,0,Sat Jul 4 12:12:07 2015 UTC,"Don't compare green or igudoala to Porter or Dudley. Both are much better than our guys. Green has so much more muscle than Dudley and Porter, and AI is a much better defender all around compared to Dudley and Porter.  Maybe if Dudley had 15lbs of more muscle then yeah I can see him play the 4. But Dudley and Porter are not as good as Nene at the 4. Nene put in work for us for so many games, but he just sucked this postseason. I think people should ease off and give Nene another shot, I know he has foot issues but if he stays healthy he can contribute like he used to."
washingtonwizards,3bz24a,Lamborghini_ENTador,0,Sat Jul 4 14:04:27 2015 UTC,"I'm saying height doesn't matter.  You literally said Dudley shouldn't play a position because of his height.   My example was the dubs but I could've said Melo (6'7) who plays the 4, Lebron (6'8) at the 4, even guys like Gallinari (6'7) play the 4 sometimes. Who cares about my example, the point is that height doesn't matter."
washingtonwizards,3bz24a,Boymankid,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:44:21 2015 UTC,"So you are saying if we had Dudley play the 4, and the other team has a 4 that is 6' 10"", you are telling me that Dudley will be able to defend that?"
washingtonwizards,3bz24a,Lamborghini_ENTador,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:41:13 2015 UTC,"Melo was at his best, and the team's best when he was in Denver playing the 3, when KMart was playing the 4.  Lebron is at his best and team's best when Tristan plays the 4 and Mozgov plays the 5"
washingtonwizards,3bxdv2,FreshPrinceOfMD,22,Thu Jul 2 22:59:50 2015 UTC,"Dudley was really fun last year on the Bucks and a great guy to root for. Follow him on twitter he gives out tickets and stuff to fans and is an overall good dude. I'm pretty pissed at John Hammond right now, hope he does well for you guys"
washingtonwizards,3bxdv2,Tedd0708,7,Thu Jul 2 23:27:45 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'm pretty stoked that we got him. He seems like a great teammate.
washingtonwizards,3bxdv2,jeffsays,3,Fri Jul 3 00:20:54 2015 UTC,"You have a fun line up though with MCW/Khris/Jabari/Giannis/Monroe. But yeah, I'm a little shocked myself at how little Duds was given away for (was it even necessary for you to make cap space?)."
washingtonwizards,3bxdv2,andrewchi,4,Fri Jul 3 01:31:25 2015 UTC,"Not really, we were close enough to the luxury tax where we would not have been able to use the MLE without going over but eventually we had to trade or release one or two guys but I would have assumed it'd be Bayless or Pachulia since we're pretty set at PG and Center now. We need shooting so I don't understand why Dudley was first to go and given away for so cheap."
washingtonwizards,3bxdv2,Tedd0708,12,Fri Jul 3 03:06:27 2015 UTC,"Y'all got an awesome guy and a really solid player. Can't say enough about how great he was for the overall attitude of the team this year. He fell off late in the year performance-wise (as did a lot of our bench), but he's a great locker room presence.  Highly recommend y'all listen to the interview he did with Zach Lowe for Grantland. Really interesting stuff and a great insight into who Duds is. Link is below.  http://espn.go.com/espnradio/play?id=12310669"
washingtonwizards,3bxdv2,GreenGator,9,Thu Jul 2 23:37:36 2015 UTC,"Definitely worth it if we get the guy who played last year for the Bucks, and not the guy who played the previous season with the Clippers."
washingtonwizards,3bxdv2,Obersts001,11,Thu Jul 2 23:14:24 2015 UTC,"He was hurt with the Clippers, so hopefully that's in the past."
washingtonwizards,3bxdv2,first_time-long_time,7,Thu Jul 2 23:20:22 2015 UTC,"I like it.  Otto should start but Dudley will provide a strong 3 & D presence off the bench.  However, I don't see him playing the 4 unless the other team goes very small."
washingtonwizards,3bxdv2,pakilicious,11,Thu Jul 2 23:02:03 2015 UTC,Everything I'm hearing suggests that the stretch 4 will be his biggest contribution. David Aldridge said a lot of people think that is his natural and best position.
washingtonwizards,3bxdv2,first_time-long_time,12,Thu Jul 2 23:19:46 2015 UTC,Only cost is a second rounder.

washingtonwizards,3bxdv2,jeffsays,10,Thu Jul 2 23:14:42 2015 UTC,It's protected tho!
washingtonwizards,3bxdv2,pine_straw,8,Thu Jul 2 23:16:14 2015 UTC,Dudley for a second rounder is a no brainer though. NBA level three point shooting and defense is more than you get out of the average 2nd rounder. I don't think this is about Ernie not valuing them highly.

washingtonwizards,3bxdv2,jeffsays,5,Thu Jul 2 23:01:45 2015 UTC,What's his contract situation? Are we using the trade exception we got from a while back? I'm a bit confused on that
washingtonwizards,3bxdv2,DCsportsJohnny,8,Thu Jul 2 23:19:37 2015 UTC,Using the TPE and sending a protected second rounder. He is only on contract for 1 year at 4.25 mil
washingtonwizards,3bxdv2,jeffsays,7,Thu Jul 2 23:21:05 2015 UTC,"Our scond rounder,Aaron White isn't even gonna play in USA this year..this is a fine use, for one year , of a second round pick. Dudley will get us back to 2013-14,with Martell finally fully healed,Otto,Beal and even Humphries raining Threes for Wiz off J Wall dimes."
washingtonwizards,3bxdv2,KRAUSE1,3,Fri Jul 3 02:17:30 2015 UTC,I absolutely agree. Though I think Aaron was going to see how summer league went before deciding to play overseas. I'd love to have him on the roster to gain experience. Really looking forward to this year.
washingtonwizards,3bxdv2,jeffsays,4,Fri Jul 3 02:48:27 2015 UTC,He's one of the nicest guys! Follow him on twitter for free tickets during the season. He's very generous.
washingtonwizards,3bxdv2,limiter_remove,3,Fri Jul 3 00:27:55 2015 UTC,"Love the trade, dudley will get great open looks in the corner. He can also play the 4 for short stretches."
washingtonwizards,3bxdv2,BrawnWall,3,Thu Jul 2 23:17:35 2015 UTC,"Not a bad trade, gives the Wiz some depth off the bench when we sit Otto. I like it in a vacuum but if this is our biggest move of the off season, Wall, Beal, and Porter better raise their game up to go farther than the 2nd round."
washingtonwizards,3bxdv2,DWood10,2,Fri Jul 3 02:29:23 2015 UTC,Fantastic deal. Dude was really good last year.

washingtonwizards,3bxhlf,whitebrucewayne,8,Thu Jul 2 23:32:15 2015 UTC,I think Otto starts and Dudley comes off the bench for 20 mins per game at 3 and 4. Oubre will be used for the rest at 2 and 3. Should be fun to see.
washingtonwizards,3bxhlf,jeffsays,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:19:43 2015 UTC,This is the most likely scenario. I don't think Dudley is a starting 4
washingtonwizards,3bxhlf,pakilicious,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:15:15 2015 UTC,He shouldn't start at the 4 but he can probably give some good mins as a stretch 4 in certain situations
washingtonwizards,3bxhlf,Boymankid,5,Sat Jul 4 10:24:58 2015 UTC,Starting five should remain what it was last year with Otto plugged in at the 3. Dudley a Swiss army knife at the 3 and 4.
washingtonwizards,3bxhlf,BrawnWall,2,Thu Jul 2 23:33:43 2015 UTC,yeah this seems to make most sense. I guess there was some talk of nene playing mostly backup center next season with humphries at PF but I don't know how serious that is
washingtonwizards,3bxhlf,BrawnWall,2,Thu Jul 2 23:36:46 2015 UTC,"I could see that, although I don't really want to pay that much money to a backup. Nene is fucking loaded with cash."

washingtonwizards,3bxhlf,Mehberry,2,Fri Jul 3 12:31:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm just now realizing it doesn't really matter. I've always been uncomfortable with his contract though, he's not worth what we are paying him. Fantastic point though, I was wrong."
washingtonwizards,3bxhlf,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,3,Fri Jul 3 13:00:46 2015 UTC,"Starters: Wall Beal Otto Dudley Gortat   Bench: Sessions Oubre/Dudley Oubre/Dudley Humphries Nene   I expect Otto will only play 28 minutes a game maximum. Dudley will at this point be logging heavy minutes, seeing as we have yet to flesh out our bench backcourt enough."
washingtonwizards,3bxhlf,jeffsays,2,Fri Jul 3 04:45:06 2015 UTC,"If Martell is healthy, he probably plays over Oubre. Because Wittman."

washingtonwizards,3bxhlf,channelkwaku,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:20:12 2015 UTC,"That's also playoffs, though. We should build his stamina up, he's young and we don't want an injury like Beal last season. Let's see what he can do on a nightly basis."
washingtonwizards,3bxhlf,SonOfSkipBaeless,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:24:34 2015 UTC,Injury is a risk at any point in a person's career. I think playing Porter just above 30 a game is a right move. That is not egregious and we are benefitting from his talents.
washingtonwizards,3bxhlf,Mehberry,2,Fri Jul 3 18:36:43 2015 UTC,I'm betting Dudley and Nene start. Otto should use that as fuel for his summer workouts.
washingtonwizards,3bwvn0,Mehberry,2,Thu Jul 2 20:33:52 2015 UTC,Yeah I think unless he wins MVP he won't be eligible for the rose rule.
washingtonwizards,3bwvn0,jeffsays,2,Thu Jul 2 22:10:33 2015 UTC,"I think if he makes an All NBA team, like Anthony Davis, then he would be eligible. But I may be wrong"
washingtonwizards,3bwvn0,Boymankid,5,Thu Jul 2 23:19:48 2015 UTC,"If we're going to have to give Beal the max anyway, we should do it this summer. A max extension this year gives him around $15m a year. If we wait a uear, that will rise to $20m.   And with the way the cap is expected to rise, $15m/ year gor a guy as good as Beal can be looks pretty good.  Edit: while that was a good idea in theory, upon further review the beal extension would not kick in until after this year, and would therefore be more along the $20m lines.   However, it looks like if they wait until after next season's free agency period, they can sign him using his bird rights, which as I understand it, means we can break the cap to do it wothout a penalty."
washingtonwizards,3bwvn0,NotBobWoodward,6,Sat Jul 4 10:21:28 2015 UTC,"Your edit is right, we should definitely wait to do it until after free agency next season. This way we can go over the cap which would give us some more flexibility instead of doing it now and tying up that future space. Also this will be a true contract year for him to see if he really deserves the max which he probably will get, but its a reason for him to work harder"
washingtonwizards,3bwvn0,blast0ise,3,Thu Jul 2 20:50:05 2015 UTC,This also however requires EG to do something correctly. Fingers crossed.
washingtonwizards,3bwvn0,blast0ise,5,Thu Jul 2 21:30:10 2015 UTC,I bet he's tried to pay for his credit card bills with future second round picks

washingtonwizards,3bxczc,WizOfAwesSite,2,Thu Jul 2 22:52:09 2015 UTC,What about CJ miles?
washingtonwizards,3bxczc,Gr8WallofChinatown,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:06:36 2015 UTC,Dude doesn't play defense and is not a great rebounder...  Great shooter and would be good offensively @ 4 but the dude does not have enough other basketball skills to get minutes here...  Randy likes defense so if we could combine his skills with someone else who plays defense and is decent...  We might be on to something.
washingtonwizards,3bvxiv,kamikazemelonman,4,Thu Jul 2 16:17:55 2015 UTC,"Forget about Gortat's deal; look at how incredibly cheap Wall's contract appears right now.   Besides, other than the inevitable Beal re-signing (which I would bet won't happen until next off-season -- that way, he can max out his money under the new salary cap + his cap hold for the Wiz is lower when 2016 free agency opens), the Wiz are not going to do anything that will take away from the money available for next year's FA class."
washingtonwizards,3bvxiv,Obersts001,3,Thu Jul 2 17:50:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we are going to get bitten on the inevitable Beal max, but otherwise Wall is cheap."
washingtonwizards,3bvxiv,Mehberry,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:34:10 2015 UTC,$15 million a year for Beal I thought? Or could that change with the cap?
washingtonwizards,3bvxiv,Boymankid,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:22:51 2015 UTC,He will likely go for $20M~ a year under the new TV deal.
washingtonwizards,3bvxiv,Kineptic,3,Sun Jul 5 17:52:44 2015 UTC,The contracts this free agency are prepping for the cap jump next year. They'll look much more standard relative to the new cap.
washingtonwizards,3bvxiv,vexxes,3,Thu Jul 2 16:28:42 2015 UTC,But it's not that big of a difference! Demarre would still be getting paid the equivalent of 12 million a year on the old cap
washingtonwizards,3bvxiv,James223344,2,Thu Jul 2 16:31:09 2015 UTC,"Both good points, the raps probably did have to overpay. I guess maybe you and I disagree about carrolls effectiveness. He got hot in the playoffs, but he normally doesn't shoot that well, and having Paul pierce on him got him a lot more buckets than he would have otherwise.   Agree to disgree, but I was overjoyed that's how an eastern conference rival chose to spend their cap space. Also I think most of the guys on those contracts (apart from the obviously horrible contracts like Gerald wallace) are much better than Demarre.  E: 11.73 million a year is the equivalent"
washingtonwizards,3bvxiv,vexxes,2,Thu Jul 2 16:36:03 2015 UTC,"Agree, but a guy like Wes Matthews is going to get that kind of dough from a place like Sacramento whose absolutely desperate for an FA signing. If a team like that wasn't in the mix I think his price tag would be a bit more realistic."
washingtonwizards,3bwez2,Knighthonor,13,Thu Jul 2 18:30:28 2015 UTC,"No. A non-lotto rookie isn't gonna be a difference-maker this year, regardless of what position he plays."
washingtonwizards,3bwez2,SonOfSkipBaeless,2,Thu Jul 2 18:36:54 2015 UTC,"On top of that, if Oubre shows good signs of development, we have leverage in trade situations because we'll have Beal, Otto, or Oubre to move in exchange for a missing piece. Especially important if we don't get Durant."
washingtonwizards,3bwez2,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,2,Thu Jul 2 19:05:08 2015 UTC,So many exceptions to the statement you just made. Not saying he will be but I hope oubre is a huge factor next season
washingtonwizards,3bwez2,andrewchi,3,Fri Jul 3 01:15:41 2015 UTC,"In the given circumstances of the draft and without the benefit of 20/20 hindsight -- I don't think so. You can acquire serviceable stretch 4s with known value via free agency and trades. I think the known-value factor is important when you're trying to acquire a stretch 4 meant to immediately impact team's offense. Additionally, we're not in the rebuilding phase (admittedly, which is a basis for arguing against choosing Oubre), we're in a play-off retool phase, i.e. we need high-impact players now to maximize Wizard's current John Wall era. So, it is a little odd they chose Oubre who has a ton of unknowns and is more of a ""project"" pick. However, given our position in the draft, we weren't really going to pick someone giving us play-off impact anyway. And, I'm speculating here, but I think Wizards wanted Oubre partly as a political pick to acquire KD as they seem to friends or have a connection."
washingtonwizards,3bwez2,Mehberry,3,Thu Jul 2 19:25:48 2015 UTC,"We should've drafted one anyway, but what's done is done. A backup SF would've been easier to get than a PF in free agency or even just an undrafted guy."
washingtonwizards,3bwez2,fagetsaget,2,Thu Jul 2 19:35:18 2015 UTC,I think we're fine. I kinda wanted him to stay but kinda wanted him to leave. Hopefully Otto can finally start and Oubre can get some good minutes too
washingtonwizards,3bvzxj,WizOfAwesSite,6,Thu Jul 2 16:37:10 2015 UTC,I actually like this one.
washingtonwizards,3bvzxj,Capn_max,3,Thu Jul 2 16:58:54 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Not adamantly opposed like most of these rumors. I'd be worried about our bench backcourt defense, however. Sessions isn't exactly Tony Allen as it is."
washingtonwizards,3bvzxj,Mehberry,2,Thu Jul 2 20:51:10 2015 UTC,Me too.  Upgrade over Sessions in my opinion.  Felt like i saw him add some legit scoring punch off the bench in Chicago.  Bombs threes.  Gets to the rim.

washingtonwizards,3bvn04,baobao3,2,Thu Jul 2 14:57:53 2015 UTC,"Try not to cry.    Honestly though, we will be fine. It sucks, I really like Paul and I appreciate everything he's done for us. I'll miss him, but we have a good young team with a bright future."
washingtonwizards,3bvn04,mrb11n,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:34:33 2015 UTC,Sign a stretch player while leaving space for possible big FA signing in 2016
washingtonwizards,3bvn04,andrewchi,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:16:06 2015 UTC,Nothing really. Wittman's newfound playoff epiphany + unexpected roster changes basically gives him carte blanche to spend the first part of the season playing around with roster minutes. Should be a super interesting November to say the least.
washingtonwizards,3bt7l5,oglefro,30,Wed Jul 1 23:14:46 2015 UTC,"He was great with us but...remember people freaked that we couldn't replace Ariza? now people freaking we can't replace Paul?  Spoiler alert--John Wall can make any 3pt shooter look beyond human.  Not worried.  Very thankful for Pierce for one major thing: he showed Wall and Beal what playoff attitude and leadership looks like.  I guarantee when these guys make the chip, no matter how long that is, they'll thank Pierce somewhere. Maybe not publicly, but inside they'll know how much he did for him.  Thanks for everything Paul."
washingtonwizards,3bt7l5,mjpanzer,16,Wed Jul 1 23:51:07 2015 UTC,"Three years? We didn't have a chance, then. Good luck, Paul."

washingtonwizards,3bt7l5,madlate,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:38:47 2015 UTC,Biggest question is who to run at the 4? The plan coming out of the playoffs was Nene agreed to come off the bench so Pierce would run the 4. Otto was and is expected to start after his magical run in the playoffs.  Running two bigs is archaic in this league.
washingtonwizards,3bt7l5,fromthepharcyde,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:12:41 2015 UTC,His name is Porter. Otto Porter

washingtonwizards,3bsrea,limiter_remove,2,Wed Jul 1 22:19:25 2015 UTC,"Plus we need nene's salary next year to offset K D salary cap. Nene can play back up to Gortat,and we can play big when needed. Play Humphries more,and use Nene w second team,add to ball movement. Nene really gave us a lot..and he helped  get rid of Jovale ...knucklehead..Mc Gee."
washingtonwizards,3br5jg,nicknamebucky,10,Wed Jul 1 14:07:29 2015 UTC,That was close

washingtonwizards,3br1a3,LooseCannon13,2,Wed Jul 1 13:38:27 2015 UTC,I was seeing Marc stein who is a west coast guy reporting on him last night on twitter...  He is waiting to see what Deandre does...  Words that he is not excited about the pay cut... I think if Deandre leaves he will resign. Even if they can get Tyson Chandler...  I doubt he goes to boston... theyre stuck in the middle of BBall purgatory (AKA Atlanta hawks 2000's teams) making the playoffs but still being mediocre. Dude wants a ring otherwise he woulda never left boston.
washingtonwizards,3br1a3,oglefro,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:39:39 2015 UTC,I think Pierce returns to Washington.
washingtonwizards,3brned,lverson,7,Wed Jul 1 16:24:58 2015 UTC,"Beal to me is a max player...  It would be nice to get that steph curry injury discount... But I doubt it.  No news yet, Might wait until KD comes over ;}"
washingtonwizards,3brned,oglefro,4,Wed Jul 1 16:32:45 2015 UTC,Oh he is most definitely a max player. No question about that.
washingtonwizards,3brned,devotedhero,3,Wed Jul 1 17:01:38 2015 UTC,only question is if he can stay healthy... last year I thought Beal was better than Klay...  But im optimistic that he can make the jump this season.. just needs to shore up his mid range.
washingtonwizards,3brned,oglefro,5,Wed Jul 1 17:59:11 2015 UTC,"I saw someone talking about how guys like Beal can sometimes have injuries because they're still growing into their bodies. And then as they get more in tune with it, the injuries stop. I think we should be optimistic about his health."
washingtonwizards,3brned,Boymankid,2,Wed Jul 1 18:15:20 2015 UTC,I saw that too! just because his frame is still filling out! Panda eats a lot so its expected... SG's usually go crazy their 3-4 year so we should expect him to breakout! hopefully if randy staggers the lineups again he will get more scoring ops with the second unit running thru him.  I'm excited for playoff Beal turning into the regular season Beal!
washingtonwizards,3brned,oglefro,2,Wed Jul 1 18:33:51 2015 UTC,Brad is not better than klay
washingtonwizards,3brned,Virulentt,5,Wed Jul 1 19:33:30 2015 UTC,I thought last year he was going into the season...  Then klay exploded... Shoulda clarified that.
washingtonwizards,3brned,oglefro,2,Wed Jul 1 20:32:19 2015 UTC,"Beal was better than Klay last year, Klay just balled out this year."
washingtonwizards,3brned,_masterofdisaster,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:57:44 2015 UTC,yeah their numbers were so similar! but then Klay went super sayian (also disappeared in the playoffs but...)  I am thinking that Brad will have a better season than Klay this year But what do I know?  Well I do know we have the best back court in the East HOLLA!!!

washingtonwizards,3bntej,ragtime_sam,6,Tue Jun 30 19:44:27 2015 UTC,That would be great with porter at 3 and oubre as backup.
washingtonwizards,3bntej,Stringphoneinventor,5,Tue Jun 30 19:47:36 2015 UTC,Yep. Then hopefully convince Nene to play ~20 mins a game as backup center (until he breaks)
washingtonwizards,3bntej,ragtime_sam,2,Tue Jun 30 19:58:55 2015 UTC,A man can only dream
washingtonwizards,3bntej,Stringphoneinventor,4,Tue Jun 30 20:02:42 2015 UTC,"Yep, exactly what I want.             Otto to start SF so he can further develop,              Pierce to play 20ish minutes to stay fresh and play him when we need him in clutch,             and          Hunphries  to play matchups that Pierce would have trouble guarding and hit those mid range."

washingtonwizards,3bntej,ExcessSwaggage,2,Wed Jul 1 03:11:24 2015 UTC,"I really hope we can keep him for another year. I was someone who hated Pierce when he played for Boston. But no matter who he plays for now, I'll have the utmost respect for the attitude he brought with him. If we can keep him fresh, I think he gives us a chance to go deep in the playoffs."
washingtonwizards,3boyu4,WizOfAwesSite,7,Tue Jun 30 23:39:42 2015 UTC,"Ive actually really liked this idea!   The dude is not a great shooter, but he is decent, big enough to play the 4, would be great in the Pick and roll and catching lobs.  if he could be a Uber atheletic drew gooden that would be coool lol  I always use him in 2k so if we could get him at a decent price id be for it."
washingtonwizards,3boyu4,oglefro,3,Tue Jun 30 23:43:29 2015 UTC,Gooden can shoot the three though.

washingtonwizards,3boyu4,kamikazemelonman,2,Wed Jul 1 15:27:23 2015 UTC,"I actually think he could be become a good shooter. He has good form and with all the open looks he would get on passes from Wall he could become the next member of the ""John Wall made me into a knockdown shooter"" club."
washingtonwizards,3boyu4,Boymankid,2,Wed Jul 1 06:22:00 2015 UTC,THIS WAS MY THOUGHT!  if playing on johns team can make drew gooden and rasual butler knockdown shooters...  Think of the potentials! lol

washingtonwizards,3boyu4,ircdub,3,Wed Jul 1 18:09:26 2015 UTC,seems like every team thinks they can save T-Rob
washingtonwizards,3boyu4,checkag,2,Wed Jul 1 23:43:59 2015 UTC,"I like this move. I think he can be very well utilized in our offensive system. He's a very athletic albeit undersized 4 who can definitely run the floor. I think with his mobility, he can run the pick and roll very well with our mobile guards.  Cheap acquisition."
washingtonwizards,3boyu4,nicknamebucky,2,Tue Jun 30 23:50:43 2015 UTC,the lack of rebounding isn't very inciting. brandan wright is what i want.
washingtonwizards,3boyu4,ruffus4life,2,Wed Jul 1 04:42:46 2015 UTC,"Wall, Beal, Porter, and Gortat are all good rebounders. Nene averaged like 6 or less a game and we still didn't have any issues."
washingtonwizards,3boyu4,Boymankid,3,Wed Jul 1 06:22:49 2015 UTC,"Check the tape. That's because he boxes out. The analytics say nene is a good rebounder. He doesn't chase the ball, he just boxes out his man. He's good fundamentally and that's what matters. Also part of it is because he's slowly down but still. Not a bad rebounder"
washingtonwizards,3boyu4,Virulentt,2,Wed Jul 1 08:22:16 2015 UTC,i wouldn't say we never had any issues. i just think wright has the overall better game but probably costs a lil more.

washingtonwizards,3bo9h9,SonOfSkipBaeless,2,Tue Jun 30 20:50:38 2015 UTC,"There was a rumor before the draft that Riley was willing to package the 10th pick with McBob to help get rid of him. The Heat don't have Hassan Whiteside's Bird rights so they needs real cap space to re-sign him, assuming they work things out Dwyane Wade.  A GM more willing to take a risk would definitely make things more interesting haha."

washingtonwizards,3bnvoz,isestrex,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:35:47 2015 UTC,I like Wright a lot but only in the right lineups. He looked great in Dallas because he had great spacing around him so nobody interfered with him destroying the rim.

washingtonwizards,3bnh3n,Knighthonor,2,Wed Jul 1 17:58:11 2015 UTC,"Wizard fans seem to have lost their mind lately. They dont need more old vets. They need young rising targets to sign. Think long term for once. KD comes, then what? No cap room to sign additional pieces after KD comes,,,,"
washingtonwizards,3bnh3n,jeffsays,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:30:29 2015 UTC,So you wouldn't want Pierce back? Theoretically paying the vets minimum for Caron Butler to come back for a year before he retires is one of the only ways we can afford players to leave room in the future for KD or Cousins or any other huge name.
washingtonwizards,3bnh3n,Mehberry,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:19:36 2015 UTC,I would take Caron as a stopgap for a year. He could play a similar role to Pierce (except not starting).

washingtonwizards,3bjuc2,ireddit270,3,Tue Jun 30 15:12:57 2015 UTC,"Not sure his game will translate well. He doesn't quite have elite explosiveness and his bully ball may not work against bigger wings in the NBA. But still glad he's getting a shot, and as a local guy it could be a good success story.  Kinda like the Ravens/ Skins picking up local guys from UMD,William and Mary or wherever"
washingtonwizards,3bjuc2,CheeseburgerTornado,3,Tue Jun 30 15:46:00 2015 UTC,"i think you're right, watching him in the tournament he looked shaky and couldn't really take care of the ball against WVU with 8 turnovers. no doubt he's gonna work on that this summer and maybe he comes up big"
washingtonwizards,3bjuc2,kamikazemelonman,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:07:12 2015 UTC,Aaron Whites game doesn't look like it could translate well too. Doesn't have an interior post game. Screens are a bit weak. But he can shoot the ball well. He's clearly a stretch 4. He just loves to sit on the arc and lurk there for threes. Even by doing that he somehow is able to get rebounds.  If he develops a defensive presence he can be legit
washingtonwizards,3bjuc2,kamikazemelonman,2,Tue Jun 30 16:56:23 2015 UTC,"You're forgetting his main strength: drawing contact. Hugely important to draw fouls in todays NBA, and that skill combined with his shot could make him an interesting piece off the bench"

His best play at Iowa, which he did for 4 straight years, was a backdoor oop.  He only started shooting 3s with any confidence at the tail end of this last season.  He always got his points by cleaning the boards, tipping in putbacks, and generally being smarter than everyone else on the floor(i.e. seeing passing lanes, cutting, knowing where the ball would be)."

washingtonwizards,3bk3g1,pakilicious,3,Tue Jun 30 13:11:52 2015 UTC,Heard Houston wants to trade Terrence Jones
washingtonwizards,3bk3g1,Rbk703,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:10:38 2015 UTC,He would be a great fit...  But I dont think we have the assets to go get him...  I doubt they just wana unload his contract for cap space so we would have to give away a first round pick or something
washingtonwizards,3bk3g1,oglefro,2,Tue Jun 30 16:28:37 2015 UTC,"If they're serious about going for a big time FA (Love, LMA, etc.) then they may be willing to trade him for cap space/a heavily-protected first rounder."
washingtonwizards,3bk3g1,checkag,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:06:10 2015 UTC,true...  but they were talking about sending him with a pick to the nuggets for Ty lawson.  So im not for sure what they view has value as. but they like donatas montaunias*** better than Jones so he might be on the block...  Would be a great fit for Wall.
washingtonwizards,3bk3g1,oglefro,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:16:18 2015 UTC,"And if they get a new PF on top of of Montejuinas or re-sign Josh Smith, Jones should be even more expendable.

washingtonwizards,3bk3g1,andrewchi,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:03:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think you need a stretch four to succeed in the league. Look at the Spurs, they don't have a stretch four (but they do have very good 3 point shooters in the 1-3 positions) and it has worked out well for them. Why? Because having a traditional bigman in the post area means that the defensive attention isn't going to be on the perimeter  all the time. Tim Duncan may not stretch the floor, but he definitely keeps the perimeter from being stifled with all the defensive attention. Also, ball movement is key, whether you have a stretch 4 or a traditional 4. Basketball is about using the personel on the floor to create mismatches, that means as long as a mismatch is created (via stretch 4 or w.e) you are going to have a better chance to score."
washingtonwizards,3bk3g1,Source_Wiki,6,Tue Jun 30 14:00:16 2015 UTC,Boris Diaw and Matt Bonner are both stretch 4's.
washingtonwizards,3bk3g1,rleung03,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:14:22 2015 UTC,"Bonner plays abt 13 mins a game, thats not nearly enough to make a huge swing in the game, and they use him in more of a pick and pop situation or letting him come off picks, same thing with Diaw, but Diaw plays some good defense (not a defensive liability hence why he plays close to 25 mins a game). Spurs don't usually use their stretch 4's to spread the floor out but more as players that can be used in half court set situations (i.e play calling, coming off picks for the catch and shoot, off ball screens for catch and shoot). I personally think the reason the Wizards don't need to have a stretch four is because John Wall would actually benefit from the fact that he can't just blow past by everyone and get to the paint, but will have to pick and choose when he can and cannot attk the basket (and of course use his ridiculous God given speed)."

washingtonwizards,3bir9z,blast0ise,3,Mon Jun 29 16:56:23 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but I'd rather us find a stretch 4 which is a premium these days anyways, and I feel like Joe Johnson replaces a lot of the shooting that PP gave us at the 3.  There is a part of me that would be interested in an uptempo lineup of Wall Beal Johnson and Porter as a stretch 4 (word is he's already bulking up) with Gortat anchoring the 5. Porter is 6'9 with an above average wingspan, if he could put on 20 lbs or so I think he could hang with enough 4's defensively to justify that lineup, or at least force other teams to go small to defend them.  I dunno, I just don't see a lot of MLE 4's that are 'worthy' imo, and with the chance, however small at pulling KD, I'd rather us be competitive as possible again next year, have webster's contract off the books, and make coming to DC all the more attractive for KD."

washingtonwizards,3bigud,phail2189,14,Mon Jun 29 14:23:35 2015 UTC,"Look, I love Dez, the dude was a great Terp, but I don't understand how you can watch him play and say he has an NBA future. He measured 6'3"" w/o shoes, he struggled with his handle at times in college, he can't shoot from deep, and he isn't a great 1v1 defender. He was at his best when he would post up smaller guards and run the offense that way. He won't be able to do that against NBA wings. I look at Dez and I don't see any strengths that will translate to the NBA.  There's no denying Oubre has his warts, but he has at least 2 NBA ready skills right now. His defense - because of his length and his quickness - will be immediately useful, and his spot-up shooting should come along over the course of the season. It also helps that he is left-handed, and we can spot him up in the right corner, where right-handed shooters have more difficulty.   Given Dez's lack of length and lateral quickness, I don't see how he could possibly get more minutes than Oubre, who, at the very least, will be a better defender."

His strength is attacking the basket but the problem is that he is slow NBAwise.  It is very extreme to say Oubre will do worse than Wells. There is a reason why Wells was undrafted
washingtonwizards,3bigud,Gr8WallofChinatown,6,Mon Jun 29 19:26:15 2015 UTC,Here's why he won't:   Wells will spend most of his time in the D-League Oubre will be on the 12-man.

washingtonwizards,3bgxsd,WizOfAwesSite,2,Mon Jun 29 03:13:52 2015 UTC,"I like Oubre a LOT and would love to have him get as many minutes as we can afford to give him, but do you guys think that Wittman would be willing to do that? He's known for never really playing rookies and I'm afraid he's gonna try to start Porter at the 3 and have someone like Garret Temple (I know he's a guard but he's big and Wittman sees the league as positionless) or Rasual Butler come off the bench instead. Then again I feel as if Oubre could bring a nice defensive impact with his athleticism, drive, and length....but Otto did exactly just that and Wittman held him back for the longest time....what do you guys at wiz of awes think Wittman is most likely going to do?"
washingtonwizards,3bgxsd,IWantSuperpowers,3,Mon Jun 29 12:56:02 2015 UTC,"Sorry but I've been hearing this a lot lately that Randy doesn't play rookies, is there more proof of this besides Otto?"
washingtonwizards,3bgxsd,blast0ise,2,Mon Jun 29 14:43:28 2015 UTC,"Just off the top of my head Glen Rice Jr. I'm sure there were more reasons than just ""he's a rookie"" but we never really helped him develop in the actual league."
washingtonwizards,3bgxsd,IWantSuperpowers,3,Mon Jun 29 15:20:04 2015 UTC,"I thought the reasoning was that we were jammed at the 3 with Ariza/Webster at the time that we had Porter and Rice as rookies in 2013-2014. Porter didn't really get playing time as a rook since he had a lot of injuries and wasn't really fully healthy as well. Still that was just two cases, he played the hell out of Beal his rookie year straight into stress injuries.   I doubt Oubre will play that much just cause he's not exactly NBA ready but I thought it was strange so many people were saying he doesn't play rooks"
washingtonwizards,3bgxsd,blast0ise,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:25:16 2015 UTC,"But Beal's just one example of Wittman actually playing a rookie heavily. Also we weren't jammed at the 3 2013-14, Webster was hurt and played a total of 13 games that season."
washingtonwizards,3bgxsd,IWantSuperpowers,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:37:10 2015 UTC,"But he's only had 3 rookies total as a Wizards coach, so the sample size isn't there. 1 for 3 means that he has a history of not playing rookies? And yes, we were jammed at the 2013-2014 season. Webster wasn't injured at all, he started 13 and played 78 games that season."
washingtonwizards,3bgxsd,blast0ise,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:44:31 2015 UTC,"My bad i mixed up Webster's injury year. And It's not just 1 for 3 however. Even this year we saw that he was hesitant to play Otto constantly. Otto may not have been a rookie but he didn't even play half of his rookie season so he was very inexperienced but Wittman was more willing to give guys like Temp, Pierce, and Butler more minutes as opposed to the guy we drafted with the 3rd overall pick.  He didn't really develop him with minutes in the league. You're entitled to your opinion based on Beal's one year but it's not gonna change mine.  edit: Glen Rice also had nothing to do with the jam at the 3 seeing as how he's a 2."
washingtonwizards,3bgxsd,IWantSuperpowers,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:57:28 2015 UTC,"2 and 3 are interchangeable, we basically had 6 wing players (Beal, Ariza, Webster, Temple, Rice, Porter). That is a jam if I've ever seen one.   Agreed he didn't develop Porter well, but we started off the season 27-12 and Butler was on fire for the first half the season. Also, we were a playoff team with high expectations coming from the second round last season. When something is working, you usually stick with it and when it doesn't, change it up. That is where we had issues with Randy for the second half of the season and that is when we were calling for his head.  Rice understandably didn't get that much playing time since we were jammed his rookie year, and after starting a few games at the beginning of this season he got in an argument with coach and was basically off the team. He had his chance, he blew it.  It isn't really an opinion I'm arguing with, it seems like a conclusion drawn from a small sample size. We can't just make a generalization off of a small sample size, if he did this in his stint as coach on other teams I would agree. Context is everything  edit: I think people should I know I hate Witt with an absolute passion, he has like a million flaws but this one about him never playing rookies is a random narrative based off of one example. If Oubre doesn't get much playing time this season it is 100% because he is not ready yet and is kind of raw."
washingtonwizards,3bgxsd,blast0ise,2,Mon Jun 29 16:14:04 2015 UTC,I heard Glen Rice had severe attitude problems and bad character. Liked to argue with his coaches. He did it one game at Wittman and Wittman sent him to the bench. Afterwards he never played again or rarely got in.
washingtonwizards,3bgxsd,Gr8WallofChinatown,3,Tue Jun 30 17:00:29 2015 UTC,"We have no idea. If I (Ben) had to guess, I think they're going to sign another wing even if Pierce decides to stay.  So, if Pierce stays it'll be something like   -Pierce -Otto Porter -Alan Anderson  They could also explore trades -- they're been linked to Jeff Green.  So, who knows? We'll find out soon!"

washingtonwizards,3bf3yz,oglefro,-9,Sun Jun 28 17:35:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to link to my other thread, but my opinion is that it was a lousy pick.  Andrew Sharp of Grantland pegged the Wizards as a draft day ""loser"" because of this pick, stating that they essentially ignored every pressing draft need and took another Nick Young.  Most knowledgeable basketball writers / analysts thought the pick didn't make a whole lot of sense with what the Wizards have.    I'll go one step further and call Oubre d-league talent.  To address one of your listed strengths about his ""shooting stroke"", the proof is in the pudding - the kid averaged 32% from 3 point range versus his conf. and 44% FG.  However ""smooth"" you think it looks, he has terrible results to show for it.  Perhaps most troubling to me is that he averaged under 1 APG.  Even Bobby Portis on Arkansas had better APG totals as a freaking center.  Can Oubre just not pass?  Does he have terrible court vision?  You tell me, but that is a downright pathetic number to have for a wing forward.    For comparison, Austin Rivers coming out of college was slightly worse overall shooter with a FG at 43%, but marginally better at 3 point at 36.5% and he needs his dad's help to crack a rotation in the NBA.  It's a make or miss league, and against much tougher competition than college defenders, I think it is going to be frustrating watching Oubre take shots he has little business taking (if it comes to that, unless of course he is rightfully sent into the d-league).    I too liked Looney, and think not drafting him or Portis especially was a glaring draft day mistake.  You are smoking some DC crack if you have convinced yourself this team is better for having Oubre than Portis."
washingtonwizards,3bf3yz,MobyDickTracyMorgan,8,Sun Jun 28 19:11:51 2015 UTC,Bradley beal shot under 34% from three in college. No reason to believe that a 19 year old oubre with a smooth stroke can't shoot 40% from three in a year or two with professional coaching every several hours a day.
washingtonwizards,3bf3yz,TouchTheSky420,4,Sun Jun 28 20:17:48 2015 UTC,We did need a wing though if Pierce leaves which he most likely will. So it's not like it wasn't a position of need
washingtonwizards,3bf3yz,yaboymattyk,2,Sun Jun 28 21:33:28 2015 UTC,"I am not as down on Oubre as you, but I still would prefer Portis and two 2nd round picks."
washingtonwizards,3bf3yz,pine_straw,2,Sun Jun 28 19:22:23 2015 UTC,"First off... Yes this was not the optimal pick for the Wizards... Portis and looney would have been better (they both slipped along with Christian Wood so there might be some issues with them, we don't have a clue) Also most mocks had us drafting a PG, R.J hunter (who slipped) or a 4 like Harrell, Looney, wood or Portis. So the fact that most pundits didint like it is not super surprising PLUS he fact EG has a spotty draft record. But he was projected as a lottery pick so the place he was selected is not surprising just to what?!? team he went to was.  That being said you have to have depth of you want to win, and the Wizards said They were going to draft he best player available. He slipped, they drafted him boom end of story. He was #4 recruit coming out of highschool for a reason... He has God given talent and abilities you can't coach.  His shooting was bad because he was a 18-19 year old transitioning from dominating people and being the most talented player on the floor to being the third or fourth. His BBIQ needs work but with NBA coaches working with him you would expect him to develop. His jump shot is not going to get worse? 44% from the field is not bad at all? 41% from midrange as well! After cliff Alexander was dismissed and he started playing more he was asked to score more and when you're the primary scorer you're going to miss bad shots at the end of shot clocks because somebody has to take them. Also he was playing against zone defenses which he will never see in the NBA. It's a whole lot harder to find wide open looks when there's a big camped under the rim all the time.  Also... Why do you keep comparing him to Austin Rivers? They don't play the same position, they are very different offensive players.  A good comparison would be Terrance Ross. Both 6'7 athletic (Kelly is not at that level tho) both have good jump shots and we're both thought as questionable picks. Toronto had Demar and we have Brad.   Here are T_Ross's two years in college:  44% FG 35% 3FG 75% FT 46% FG 37% 3FG 76% FT  Now here is Kelly's  42% FG 37% 3FG 71% FT  Pretty similar. T_Ross is not a D-League player by any stretch of the imagination. Kelly might get some playing time down there and he will tear it up. Have you ever been to a D league game? I have and dudes who are trash in the NBA tear it up there.   If he plays within the offense he shoots 41% from midrange and 37 from three that will be good enough to stay on a NBA roster for a while.  His passing is very questionable like I noted but it was his first year on the team going from the #1 option in highschool to being a second stringer. He didint start for most of the season so it's kinda hard to gain chemistry with the other starters. Also if your teammates don't shoot when you pass it to them or they miss nothing you can do about it.  Have you actually seen him play? I've watched 6 KU games last year along with all the DX stuff and other things on YouTube of him. I'm not a KU fan so I promise I'm not (super)biased. The dude looks like he will start slow but be good in the long term.  Hell if he turned into T_Ross a athlete who can shoot threes, make layups & Dunks in transition, play defense sometimes, and play within himself he will be a decent pick. Not every NBA player turns into a superstar but this dude can be a solid player for the next 4 years cheaper than comparable production...  If you're mad that we traded 2 second rounders just remember we drafted Aaron fucking White instead of Wood or any of the other undrafted stretch fours...  So we might be agreeing that we coulda had a better draft. Also I didint like Portis and I was 90% on the Looney hype train and the other 10% was reserved for Jerian Grant. I thought looney would be a poor mans Lamar Odom. So I'm still liking this pick. BTW I'm not smoking crack because Lamar took all mine :/"
washingtonwizards,3bf3yz,MobyDickTracyMorgan,0,Sun Jun 28 21:15:04 2015 UTC,"My biggest knock on him is that out of the Top 100 DX Small Forwards, he ranked dead last in Assists Per Game adjusted to 40 mins.  That's not very explainable to me for a team like Kansas that featured guys who can score like Ellis, Selden, and others.  Yes, I did watch more than enough of him to formulate a non-biased opinion.  The ball and offense slows down with him and NBA speed of game seems way too fast for him.  I have a different view than some, because I believe you can work to ""mask"" these flaws, but you can't really teach it.  You either have a high basketball IQ or you don't.  Anyhow, I appreciate your nicely constructed reply."

Both are perfectly possible since he'll be given open looks in summer league and was capable defensively in spurts at Maryland but it'll take hard work. a better prospect than Glen Rice Jr. in my opinion, but as a fellow terp i must say im a little biased."
washingtonwizards,3bf0aq,oglefro,5,Sun Jun 28 17:03:15 2015 UTC,"I hated the title of that article, but it's good that he has worked with Beals trainer and has passion for the game.  Kinda scary that his BBIQ is pretty low, but if we can develop his skill he can turn into a very good player...  I'm weary of our front offices player developmental skills but we can only hope for the best!"
washingtonwizards,3bf0aq,extraneouspanthers,3,Sun Jun 28 17:11:59 2015 UTC,We developed Beal and Porter. Oubre obviously isn't of their caliber but still. There's hope

washingtonwizards,3bf0aq,SonOfSkipBaeless,-1,Sun Jun 28 17:44:13 2015 UTC,"Very good read, and I've echoed similar things.  Probably the last time I will weigh in one one of these Oubre threads for a long long time since all it seems to result in is people telling me to screw myself, but here goes.  He's a 19 year old, I'm not rooting for him to fail.  He does have some physical tools and if he fills out his body there is some potential there.  But I really question why he didn't stay one more year in college.  Money grab?  Nervous about not improving in one more year and slipping out of the first round and becoming an afterthought?  Legitimately thought he was lottery talent?  Whatever the reason may be, I strongly suggest people watch this video which I have bookmarked at the 'weaknesses' portion of his game.  I mean, for everyone saying he has 'absurd potential', I can say he has physical tools that have carried him to this point.  Shawn Bradley once had the physical tools to be the greatest center who ever played.  But when you look at the film, you see someone that is atrocious at making plays.  He is very poor at creating much of anything out there.  I just don't see how someone with his handles gets to the point where he can effectively beat guys off the dribble because the ball slows him down.  These are things he should have been getting reps at and improving upon since he was 8 years old.    My fundamental question is: can the Wizards afford to wait on him 3+ years to see what he becomes?  What will the team even be like then?  I think you have to look at the landscape of the East and say that the window is now.  This year's team underachieved should have beaten ATL and played CLE in the conf championship, and who knows what that series would have been like, but a lot would have been learned.    If you are that close as a team, you don't gamble on an unknown commodity, you try to fill the most pressing need because your team is built to win now."
washingtonwizards,3bf0aq,AnalSlutFrog,8,Sun Jun 28 19:59:02 2015 UTC,"But I really question why he didn't stay one more year in college. Money grab?   Well, duh.   My fundamental question is: can the Wizards afford to wait on him 3+ years to see what he becomes? What will the team even be like then? I think you have to look at the landscape of the East and say that the window is now. This year's team underachieved should have beaten ATL and played CLE in the conf championship, and who knows what that series would have been like, but a lot would have been learned.   This is probably the first time I've seen anyone describe the Wizards as a win-now team. This is a built-for-summer-of-2016-free-agency team imo. Besides Gortat, the guys who aren't coming off the books next summer are all young and growing and -- including Gortat -- locked down contractually.  I think this group can hang with anyone in the east in a 7 game series but I'm content to let the core marinate a little longer and let Lebron James get a little older before putting all the chips on the table. Besides. The 19th pick doesn't get you an instant impact player. The Hawks couldn't do any better than Tim Hardaway Jr.   If you are that close as a team, you don't gamble on an unknown commodity, you try to fill the most pressing need because your team is built to win now.   I completely disagree. Good teams think longterm: The Warriors didn't need Stephen Curry when they had Monta Ellis. They didn't need Klay Thompson when they had both of them. The Bulls didn't need Jimmy Butler when they had Luol Deng. The Pacers didn't need Paul George when they had Danny Granger. They didn't need Kawhi Leonard, either, so they traded their pick for George Hill, who the Spurs didn't need when they drafted him.  On the flipside you have a team like the Suns that punted on picks that turned into Rajon Rondo, Luol Deng, and Serge Ibaka because they were short-sighted, the Mavericks stuck in Mark Cuban's dreaded treadmill of mediocrity after repeatedly discarding assets trying to build a title team every summer, a Clippers team with a great starting 5 and nothing else, and a lot of other failures."
washingtonwizards,3bf0aq,Zorodude77,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:05:41 2015 UTC,"None of our draft options would've filled that most pressing need though, not a single player would have put us over the top. We need a 2nd star next to Wall if we want to take advantage of our window. That piece is coming through Free Agency or a Trade, not where we're drafting now.   This makes picking Oubre ok in my book. Low risk, high reward."

washingtonwizards,3bc56n,phail2189,2,Sat Jun 27 23:33:10 2015 UTC,I don't think so (right now). At 200 lbs he would get severely out muscled by bigger guys. But I'd like to hear what everyone thinks.
washingtonwizards,3bc56n,Lenai,2,Sat Jun 27 22:31:02 2015 UTC,"I think he can, much like Shawn Marion did in Phoenix. But he wouldn't be able to guard Blake Griffin and Lamarcus Aldridge."
washingtonwizards,3bc56n,Kirbybajerby,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:23:19 2015 UTC,Well Marion was weighed more and was stronger...  Also had a inside game and played post in HS and in college.  Porter has been a perimeter player most of his career. So unless he gets on some HGH and gains 30 pounds over the next couple of years he won't be able to guard almost any PF's.  When other teams play small ball he could guard some of the guys who are 3/4's like Harrison Barnes but no one who weighs more than 235.
washingtonwizards,3bc56n,oglefro,2,Sun Jun 28 21:19:08 2015 UTC,Not even close. I was hoping that he could play the 2 but obviously he can't

washingtonwizards,3bbig6,oglefro,3,Sun Jun 28 17:14:15 2015 UTC,I don't understand contracts exactly but someone said he'd get about 2 million more.
washingtonwizards,3bbig6,extraneouspanthers,0,Sun Jun 28 17:24:57 2015 UTC,"So last year we signed him with the ""mid-Level exception""  This is a 5 million dollar contract that teams who are over the cap can use to sign players.

washingtonwizards,3bcmg6,kmhokies35,-14,Sun Jun 28 03:51:40 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm yet to hear actual ""pros"" of drafting him.  He's a worse 'tweener' than Porter originally was, who at least had some strength and size to be a good two-way contributor.  It took Porter a few years to develop into that but he had the kind of attitude to succeed in that position as a role-player type guy.    Oubre is a worse 'tweener' because the kid cannot play defense whatsoever.  He got away with in somewhat in college... because it's college.  He won't play SG because of Beal, and he can't be a backup PG because of his handles.  So that leaves him as an awkward SF who won't play within 15 feet of the basket in all likelihood and rebound.  He can't go up against guys like Paul George, Jimmy Butler, etc.  because those guys will annihilate him off the dribble defensively.  But we all know he won't be starting, so even off the bench, his ceiling is that he is a decent scorer - but wouldn't you rather have an elite 3 point shooter taking those shots?  The kid shot 32 freaking percent from 3 pt range against his conference.  35 something percent from 3 point territory in total. In college.  I project that he becomes a lot like Austin Rivers - a bench guy who ends up taking a lot of shots he shouldn't be taking because he isn't very talented.    Also to boot: 70% free throw shooter, 44% field goal percentage on season.  Sub 1 assist per game.  Can you say ball-stopper?"
washingtonwizards,3bcmg6,ireddit270,9,Sun Jun 28 04:24:44 2015 UTC,"A lot of the stuff you're saying is flat out wrong. You need to get better intel or something because you're spewing nonsense lol  Oubre won't play anywhere near the basket and rebound? Do a slight modicum of research and you will see that Oubre was an elite rebounding wing in ncaa  You say he's like Austin Rivers, but earlier you said he had subpar handles. How is he anything like Rivers then? The fact that Oubre's handles aren't developed means he'll mostly be a spot-up shooter for now, which is fine. We're going to develop him as an athletic 3&D player (ala Ariza) not like Nick Young  And lastly, look at Beal's shooting %s at Florida when he was also an 18yo college freshman: 45 fg%/34 3pt% /77 FT%.. calling it now Bradley Beal is a BUST with no potential"
washingtonwizards,3bcmg6,ireddit270,-13,Sun Jun 28 10:21:56 2015 UTC,"Elite rebounder?  Jesus man, just buy his jersey already and be done with it if you're going to spit in the face of stats.  Both Stanley Johnson and Winslow were better than him in every category across the board and those guys played with dominant big men on their teams.  When KU lost Alexander, Oubre should have been rebounding at a higher clip than those two but he couldn't because he's d-league talent.  Get a grip on reality.  You think 5 RPG qualifies as ""elite"" rebounding in college, that's ludicrous at best."
washingtonwizards,3bcmg6,ruffus4life,3,Sun Jun 28 10:40:48 2015 UTC,"5 rpg in 20mpg is great for a college wing. Oubre posted a defensive rebounding percentage of 20% which is pretty insane.   Also he was rated as the second best isolation defender in his conference, so your earlier statement that he cannot play defense 'whatsoever' isn't accurate. Oubre can play defense, he just needs to be more consistent in his effort and will learn Wittman's scheme (same with Wall and Beal when they entered the league)"
washingtonwizards,3bcmg6,jjhare,12,Sun Jun 28 18:36:27 2015 UTC,"i can't see wall, beal, or gortat allowing someone to mess up all the hard work they have put in the past two years. if the kid is really a problem randy will stick him at the end of the bench or send him to the d-league. i would have still liked to get portis instead but the length of the kid is exciting."
washingtonwizards,3bcmg6,BrawnWall,17,Sat Jun 27 23:45:35 2015 UTC,OK Cowherd.

washingtonwizards,3bcmg6,alwaysthinkandplanah,-9,Sat Jun 27 23:49:16 2015 UTC,"Give me a break.  I'm saying there are obvious red flags with the kid that many people, like yourself, have conveniently swept under the rug.  Like how heading into the biggest game of his life against Wichita State in the tourney he told reporters that he took a nap while Wichita State was playing its last game.    Then he got put in his fucking place when he got wrecked on the court and a WSU player told him to ""go back to sleep"".    There is a huge void between where he sees himself and his basketball star, and where he actually is.  You and others will defend this, chalking it up to him believing in himself, but I will call a spade a spade and say he's a bit of a tool for how he has conducted himself so far."
washingtonwizards,3bcmg6,ireddit270,13,Sat Jun 27 23:59:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Oubre played like shit in that game. I still don't know why you're acting like Wichita St is some scrub fucking team though. Final four, undefeated season/loss in tourney to kentucky, and then beating in state rival 2 seed in three consecutive years is more of a statement on them than an overrated, underprepared Kansas ream.   My point isn't that he doesn't have flaws. It's that you sound exactly like Cowherd ripping on John. You're calling out character issues that most kids have, which makes them more traits of average teens than issues. Idk, it just rubbed me the wrong way. Your analysis is still well thought out and presented respectfully, I just have a problem when a person's character is put into question based on some random dude drawing conclusions.  Still all love man, you know we stick together."
washingtonwizards,3bcmg6,alwaysthinkandplanah,-8,Sun Jun 28 00:21:00 2015 UTC,"True, Wichita State was a great team last year I agree.  But just as me calling him out has rubbed you the wrong way, he himself has rubbed me the wrong way.  I've honestly nothing to gain in calling him out, if anything people are going to just spit in my face for going against the grain.  But it is important to balance all of the optimism with some realism.    I just think he is a soft bball player, it seems like he shies away from contact and just wants to be a shooter from all the tape I've seen of him, which is fine... but what position will he be playing?  SG?  He will never get minutes behind Beal.  If SF, he will get bodied up and bullied defensively, and offensively I don't think he is gifted enough to be a scorer in any rotation.  He looks like he might just be Austin Rivers 2.0 with a few more inches on his frame.  People think I'm just hating on him to hate on him, but he has given me plenty of things to call him out for.  Get real, the only way he even got in any kind of headlines on draft day was due to his shoes!!!!  Wake up people."
washingtonwizards,3bcmg6,ireddit270,11,Sun Jun 28 00:30:56 2015 UTC,"""If SF, he will get bodied up and bullied defensively""  He weighs more than Porter"
washingtonwizards,3bcmg6,jjhare,3,Sun Jun 28 01:47:09 2015 UTC,"Oubre has a longer wingspan than Porter also, believe it or not.   7'2"" to Otto's 7-1.5"""
washingtonwizards,3bcmg6,TouchTheSky420,2,Sun Jun 28 18:03:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think oubre is gonna be our small ball 4 over porter. Larger wingspan to bother shooters, more athletic, and 220ish lbs to Otto's 200ish"
washingtonwizards,3bcmg6,djmooselee,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:41:21 2015 UTC,"Even though he's much slimmer (for now) Otto is taller and I think would have better skills to play the 4 offensively, because he played out of the high post in college and has better IQ/fundamentals than Oubre. Kelly can be our xfactor SF and just focus his scoring on cuts and open threes.. I envision a bigger Demarre Carroll.  It will be interesting though, if Oubre shows the ability to guard some 4s that would be huge for this team"
washingtonwizards,3bcmg6,jjhare,-8,Sun Jun 28 20:30:26 2015 UTC,ABSOLUTELY NO FUCKING WEIGH DOES HE WEIGH MORE THAN PORTER RIGHT NOW

You are also effing delusional out of your mind if you think I am ""trolling"" by taking a stance on a kid like Oubre who has not accomplished a single thing on the basketball court besides get drafted outside of the lottery.  He isn't important enough for that, the fact that I voiced my opinion has more to do with ""swagfags"" like yourself who will probably try emulating his haircut and rush to buy his jersey as if he is some kind of valuable NBA commodity or star in the making."

I expect him to be a solid bench contributor before long, my first impressions of him are much more positive.   To each his own however."

washingtonwizards,3b7dym,checkag,2,Fri Jun 26 21:32:58 2015 UTC,"I like his potential, I'm just still wondering about the fit. He seems like a pure-SF when we already have Otto Porter, might still have Paul Pierce, and will eventually have Kevin Durant.  Unless they can bulk up Porter and turn him to a stretch four, I'm not sure I see how Oubre is going to get playing time."

Will be a pick that we have to revisit in three years to truly see if it was a good call. Will say this though: Oubre can run, dunk, and hit open threes. Those skills work very well with a particular point guard on the Wizards (and I ain't talking about Ramon Sessions!)"

washingtonwizards,3b7tpk,AlboAmericano,5,Fri Jun 26 18:02:42 2015 UTC,What if Pierce actually comes back? Would he just play the 4 with Porter starting at 3 and Oubre as a back up? Doesn't sound too bad.
washingtonwizards,3b7tpk,guga31bb,8,Fri Jun 26 20:15:28 2015 UTC,I doubt it. Asking Pierce to play the 4 for a full season seems like a good way to make sure his body breaks down.
washingtonwizards,3b7tpk,ruffus4life,2,Fri Jun 26 20:49:57 2015 UTC,he should only be playing like 20 min a game anyway. playing a few min at the four won't kill him and would be great to mix things up every now and then.
washingtonwizards,3b7tpk,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,6,Fri Jun 26 23:34:07 2015 UTC,"Remember when we were sometimes forced to play Bynum and Martell? Well if Pierce comes back, we can avoid that and play Oubre instead."
washingtonwizards,3b7tpk,Dr_Dugtrio,3,Fri Jun 26 21:53:28 2015 UTC,The ideal situation is start Porter at 3 and Hump at 4 with Nene sub as usual and Pierce getting 3-4 minutes at the end of quarters.
washingtonwizards,3b7tpk,ruffus4life,2,Fri Jun 26 22:51:20 2015 UTC,that would be good. i don't really trust nene as a rebounder or a offensive certainty but he is still a bruiser that can play good man defense. fuck maybe we will see contract nene come out. that cap is gonna explode next year so even someone like nene could still get a pretty good contract if he shows well this season.
washingtonwizards,3b7tpk,isestrex,2,Sat Jun 27 05:22:19 2015 UTC,"Porter would be the 6th man. Even so there's a good chance even though Pierce would officially be a starter, he would play less minutes than Porter and both would be on the floor in crunch time."

Downside is that we don't know if he can really shoot a 3pter. He made a good percentages of threes at clutch times but they were very low percentages. He's not that great of a shot creator (evident in the game MD gets knocked off by WVU). Very good driver. Pick and roll game is still suspect because UMD set the worst weak picks.

washingtonwizards,3b53t8,Virulentt,16,Fri Jun 26 01:25:38 2015 UTC,Yeah I feel like he's an offensively capable Garrett temple
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,Fruit_Juice_is_Great,18,Fri Jun 26 01:27:47 2015 UTC,"cmon man, garrett temple is a beast. He may not have had the best regular season but I think that's because he didn't get enough minutes to find a groove. He came through huge for us in the playoffs tho... and he's going to break out this year, you can count on it. The only complaint I have is that his goggles make him look pretty weird but to each his own."

washingtonwizards,3b53t8,BagelsAndJewce,5,Fri Jun 26 01:27:52 2015 UTC,We have a pick that we didn't trade away. This is good. It's like we moved up in the draft instead of cash considerations.
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,jayhawker202,10,Fri Jun 26 02:24:01 2015 UTC,Kansas fan. This kid will give you 100% on the court. Rapidly developing outside shot. Very long arms make him a very good perimeter defender and rebounder. Plus he's a lefty!
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,Shaidester,3,Fri Jun 26 01:40:10 2015 UTC,"Sounds exactly like Trevor Ariza. Paul Pierce was an amazing man but his defense was no where near Ariza's which was heavily missed this season. Unfortunately, Wittman will probably not play him in his first year or only play him during one part of the season."
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,andywiggins,21,Fri Jun 26 02:19:45 2015 UTC,"Kansas fan here, this is good"
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,SuperPussyFan,2,Fri Jun 26 01:21:29 2015 UTC,"K-State fan here, /vomit. These last few years have been strange with Kirk, DGIII, Pierce, and now Oubre. Am I forgetting anyone?"
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,first_time-long_time,11,Fri Jun 26 02:20:28 2015 UTC,"Reeks of a team without a plan, to me. Why not draft a 4?! We're really gonna run it back with Nene again this year?"
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,FreshPrinceOfMD,9,Fri Jun 26 01:35:58 2015 UTC,lots of free agents that could replace nene though
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,first_time-long_time,8,Fri Jun 26 01:39:07 2015 UTC,"We have no money for that, though."
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,vexxes,9,Fri Jun 26 01:40:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think we're planning on a finals run next year, though. (Nene is an expiring contract)"
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,first_time-long_time,3,Fri Jun 26 01:50:44 2015 UTC,"That's true. I just feel like Ernie over-thought this one. We need a PF who can shoot, and we had a perfect opportunity to draft one, and then took a guy who essentially replicates what Otto already does. Portis was right there, and seemed like a no-brainer to me.  We didn't even work out Oubre, apparently. Why did anyone think this was what we needed?"
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,guga31bb,5,Fri Jun 26 01:53:31 2015 UTC,We need a PF who can shoot   Not as bad as we need wing players who can defend. There's zero depth behind Beal and Porter.
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,first_time-long_time,4,Fri Jun 26 01:54:48 2015 UTC,"I think you can get wing depth in free agency and the 2nd round. We have Nene's corpse and Kris Humphries as our PF options. That is the biggest hole on the team, in my opinion."
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,Veckatimeister,3,Fri Jun 26 01:57:32 2015 UTC,"I'd be ok with us starting Humphries tbh. He looked really good at the start of the season and gets boards like crazy. Not saying Nene and Hump is sustainable, we still need another big, but I'm not too concerned. Gortat, Nene, Humphries, Gooden's corpse can still play, and a TBA rotational guy. I can get on board."
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,blast0ise,2,Fri Jun 26 02:43:07 2015 UTC,"We could have gotten a backup wing in free agency, a power forward to build around for the future doesn't come around that easily. I don't mind the pick but I am worried about a starting PF for the future. We have a young pg, sg, sf, and a center that is locked up for 4 years. There is so much uncertainty at the 4"
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,LlamaCombo,2,Fri Jun 26 04:31:46 2015 UTC,Are you guys too broke to sign Paul Millsap? I feel like he'd be the missing piece to your team.
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,youngsaiyan,3,Fri Jun 26 04:01:45 2015 UTC,He would do really well for us. We need to save money though so no
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,dandrews10,2,Fri Jun 26 04:38:45 2015 UTC,There isn't a big man in this draft outside of KAT and Okafor that come even remotely close to being as good as Nene this season.
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,first_time-long_time,2,Fri Jun 26 02:06:23 2015 UTC,"I couldn't be more down on Nene. He's done, I think. He didn't play well all season and totally shit the bed in the playoffs. He'll probably retire after this season."
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,Zorodude77,2,Fri Jun 26 02:09:45 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I think he just needs to play fewer minutes, meaning more small ball and a lot more humph. We definitely need another big tho, and if we can get a starting caliber 4 I'd be happy moving Nene to the bench as backup 5."
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,stephenporter,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:29:09 2015 UTC,"Nene playing 15-20 minutes as the back-up 5 would be perfect. If we can keep him healthy, he's a force that can keep the offense moving with our guards on the bench getting rest. Dump him the ball and let him score or facilitate for 6 minutes every half."
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,rudderrudder,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:13:06 2015 UTC,"If  you're planning to fill an important current need with a draft pick in the teens, you've got a bad plan. This is general talent stocking for the future."

Plus Ernie doesn't do anything with second rounders anyway- their either cash considerations or Euro stocks."
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,Commandant1,7,Fri Jun 26 15:47:41 2015 UTC,Here is a scouting report http://lastwordonsports.com/2015/06/23/draft-profile-kelly-oubre-jr/
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,daynjus,19,Fri Jun 26 01:21:45 2015 UTC,"A player comparable to Oubre, Trevor Ariza. This is a great pick.  Remember, you can insert him into multiple lineups: Wall, Beal, Oubre, Nene, Gortat Wall, Oubre, Porter, Nene, Gortat Beal, Oubre, Porter, Nene, Gortat Sessions, Beal, Oubre, Humphries, Gortat Sessions, Beal, Oubre, Humphries, Nene (small) Wall, Beal, Oubre, Porter, Humphries      Edit: These are just examples, not what I feel are the best lineups. Also, there is free-agency and summer league hasn't even started, so we should (hopefully) have more flexibility than throwing Nene, Humphries or (god forbid) Blair in at the 4."
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,peterkimmm,6,Fri Jun 26 01:27:34 2015 UTC,I'm not too sure if Otto would be ready to play PF.. He'll have trouble defending on many matchups.
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,Dr_Dugtrio,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:52:52 2015 UTC,"No, but he can play Small Forward and if we decode to go small he can Porter can play the 3/4."
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,FreshPrinceOfMD,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:30:20 2015 UTC,"That small ball line up sounds terrible, Humphries can't play defense, has stubby arms, and can only be relied upon with some jumpers. You're more likely to see Nene alternating with gortat at that spot. I would like Nene at the small 5   Edit: looking at the rest of your lineups you seem like a huge hump fan"
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,Shaidester,5,Fri Jun 26 04:40:40 2015 UTC,"Looks good, I definitely like the comparison to Ariza, any idea if Otto is gonna play some time at the 4 next season because of this?  EDIT: FAM"
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,kamikazemelonman,4,Fri Jun 26 01:24:25 2015 UTC,I think Porter would die if he played at the 4. He needs to drink a lot of milk this offseason if he is gonna end up there.
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,Mehberry,2,Fri Jun 26 02:20:49 2015 UTC,Honestly having 5 guys for the 1-3 and 3 guys for the 4-5 isn't that bad. A lot of people acting like we have to have a big. Why? We can definitely pick up a semi competent big in free agency for depth (Derrick Williams pls)

washingtonwizards,3b53t8,Boymankid,2,Fri Jun 26 01:31:09 2015 UTC,"That's great. Having him + Otto + John on the floor at the same time would be so disruptive on defense. Both Oubre and Otto have 7'2"" wingspans."
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,iidesune,12,Fri Jun 26 02:54:24 2015 UTC,"Loved that interview right there. Confidence and a willingness to work to get better, I'm liking this pick already."
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,dandrews10,11,Fri Jun 26 01:23:52 2015 UTC,Just what we needed.  An athletic wing who can defend.
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,youngsaiyan,4,Fri Jun 26 01:26:48 2015 UTC,"He may be a let down, but it's about damn time Ernie drafted someone with great potential outside of the lottery. We've come a long way since Chris Singleton."
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,f00kinlegend,2,Fri Jun 26 02:04:26 2015 UTC,I had decent hopes for singleton as a 3 and D guy. For some reason he had it in his head that he was the first option on offense whenever he went in... and lost all coordination
washingtonwizards,3b53t8,shrimhealingcenter,6,Fri Jun 26 04:49:25 2015 UTC,Clearly a move for KD next year.  See KDs instagram page. https://instagram.com/p/4Sz2MYzSrs/?taken-by=easymoneysniper

washingtonwizards,3b53t8,wigglemonster,8,Fri Jun 26 05:51:11 2015 UTC,"Whether you like it or not, he is a part of the franchise, lets give him our full support. We have a player to replace PP if he decides to go to LA or if he stays, PP has another player to mentor/take under the wing. Nothing like having TWO guys who can play 3&D.   Plus, if KD does come to DC, we can have literally a lineup of John, Brad, Otto, Oubre, KD. The Warriors won with Green and Barnes at PF/C. So we can emulate it, not expecting similar results, but the lineup potential is there. I actually like the pick a lot. We'll see how he develops.   You got my vote of confidence Mr. Flashy Shoe Man."

It includes last night's picks, but most teams have more than one stashed player.  We don't take risks to get decent young bigs with experience because you don't find them in the 2nd round and Grunfeld is a shitty drafter. Also you don't take risks on decent guys with experience because that's not a risk. That's a decent guy with experience, you have higher expectations. You take risks on project players, like Aaron White."

I'm biased but I think he's a steal. For one he lead us in rebounding all four years here I believe, playing the 3. He finished 2nd all time rebounds in school history and 2nd all time scoring in school history. He can do a little of everything, he can get some steals, great on fast breaks and often delivers strong finishes. He can rebound and plays great defense. His main problems are his 3 point shooting and he does disappear from time to time on offense. I don't know about your guys' depth at the 3 but he should be a nice addition."

He can get to the line and knock them down better than most. If he works on his 3 he could be a very solid bench player for you guys.

washingtonwizards,3b5l9r,disasterjsl,4,Fri Jun 26 04:12:35 2015 UTC,Maybe Ernie just thought Satoranský could use a new friend to convince him how great it is over here.
washingtonwizards,3b5l9r,SMartEmployee,3,Fri Jun 26 04:29:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is a thing. It's becoming more and more frequent."
washingtonwizards,3b548x,nicknamebucky,11,Fri Jun 26 01:22:04 2015 UTC,"But he's very young and his basketball IQ is low. But he's put in a lot of work the past few months, and I think he's made huge strides. If he puts in the work -- a big if -- he could be one of the best 8 or 9 players in this draft.  ""Whoever gets me is getting a jewel.""   Yep.. this is a very prototypical Ernie pick. An overconfident low IQ toolsy player.  Great."

washingtonwizards,3b5lzj,SonOfSkipBaeless,2,Fri Jun 26 04:14:10 2015 UTC,"lol I should have read this first.  Honestly though, despite all his weaknesses, I'm impressed with his defensive ability. His defensive crouch/stance looks terrific. You can't teach that. His upside is Bruce Bowen."
washingtonwizards,3b5lzj,isestrex,2,Fri Jun 26 07:16:37 2015 UTC,"Lol that is what I was gonna do, then I just ended up skipping weaknesses all together"

washingtonwizards,3b5lzj,Zorodude77,2,Fri Jun 26 13:15:41 2015 UTC,"He'll be a decent replacement for Ariza  We missed his Three and D this season.  If he can play solid wing defense, and hit open threes in transition, he'll fit in well with this team.  We'll just have to make sure he doesn't handle the ball too much."
washingtonwizards,3b4lsj,devotedhero,11,Thu Jun 25 22:41:56 2015 UTC,"We traded for 15th and selected Oubre, according to Woj."
washingtonwizards,3b4lsj,Virulentt,6,Fri Jun 26 01:19:13 2015 UTC,I like the pick
washingtonwizards,3b4lsj,checkag,2,Fri Jun 26 01:21:41 2015 UTC,um.. yay? I guess Pierce is definitely gone and he's our top backup wing?
washingtonwizards,3b4lsj,devotedhero,6,Fri Jun 26 01:20:46 2015 UTC,"This is a really good pick, IMO. If Pierce leaves, Porter is our only playable 3 who isn't a corpse. This guy is projected to be Trevor Ariza which is pretty damn good for us. Sucks we had to lose two seconds, but whatever."

washingtonwizards,3b4lsj,Boymankid,3,Fri Jun 26 01:21:46 2015 UTC,"Low risk high reward. He has the tools to be a 3 and D player which would be great for us, we saw what A-3-Za did in that role.   Worst case scenario we turn to FA to try to find someone, which is probably in play anyway."
washingtonwizards,3b4lsj,TheDefiant1,3,Fri Jun 26 02:02:05 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. I don't really follow college ball. All of these dudes are strangers to me. Hopefully he'll work out. I'm already excited for next season.
washingtonwizards,3b4lsj,Boymankid,2,Fri Jun 26 02:23:08 2015 UTC,"Of course. Yeah I think this kid will have a good chance to make the rotation, he has a good mindset and looks like a hard worker"
washingtonwizards,3b4lsj,540Cameron,2,Fri Jun 26 02:30:41 2015 UTC,Any thoughts on us drafting Justin Anderson? Knew him in middle school and high school. Would be crazy seeing him play for the team I love.
washingtonwizards,3b4lsj,0hn0traps,2,Fri Jun 26 00:50:43 2015 UTC,weird first round so far.  Doubt Portis will be there at 19
washingtonwizards,3b4lsj,0hn0traps,2,Fri Jun 26 00:54:31 2015 UTC,19 and two 2nd's for Oubre
washingtonwizards,3b4lsj,540Cameron,2,Fri Jun 26 01:20:31 2015 UTC,I know nothing about college basketball. Someone tell me about these first two picks we have.
washingtonwizards,3b4lsj,Boymankid,3,Fri Jun 26 01:48:29 2015 UTC,"We traded the 19th pick for the 15th pick and took Oubre.   He projects to be a player like Trevor Ariza - good defense and solid 3 point shooting, especially in transition. I think it's a very solid pick."
washingtonwizards,3b4lsj,devilknight,2,Fri Jun 26 02:02:56 2015 UTC,"Damn Bobby Portis hasn't even been picked yet and its up to pick 22 right now, maybe no one is that sold on him?  Edit: nvm Bulls just picked him at 22."

washingtonwizards,3b5d8x,Zomby24,7,Fri Jun 26 02:50:05 2015 UTC,"Our wing situation is Beal, Porter, blank - assuming PP leaves. We may make some plays in FA but Rando Cal-wittmian may have no choice but to give the kid some pt"

washingtonwizards,3b5d8x,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,3,Fri Jun 26 14:40:19 2015 UTC,"Neither of those guys should be getting major NBA minutes. I actually hope Webster has a resurgence (so we can move him by the trade deadline) but not holding my breath, he looked just about done last season.   If Oubre can play defense and hit open shots at all, there will be PT for him. If he's another GR Jr and doesn't accept to do the little things, he will ride the pine"
washingtonwizards,3b5d8x,ireddit270,3,Fri Jun 26 16:00:12 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't he play?
washingtonwizards,3b5d8x,Zomby24,8,Fri Jun 26 03:11:53 2015 UTC,Raw as hell and Witt doesn't like to play rooks. I think Ernie said afterwards that he's a dude that's gonna make in impact in 2-3 years.
washingtonwizards,3b5d8x,blast0ise,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:15:17 2015 UTC,is he going to have much of a choice? We're spread pretty thin at the 2 and 3
washingtonwizards,3b5d8x,AlvinHutchinson,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:04:25 2015 UTC,I'd say we're even thinner at the 4 and 5. Gortat and Humphries and that's it.
washingtonwizards,3b5d8x,Obersts001,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:19:02 2015 UTC,"I watched maybe one KU game all of last year so I have no informed opinion of this kid. It's not like we were getting a bona fide superstar at #19, so you might as well roll the dice on someone who has significant upside potential down the line. And the complaining about the trade of future 2nd round picks is pointless; the difference between signing someone at #50-55 (yes, I'm expecting the Wiz to be higher seeded for the next couple of years) and signing a UFA is minimal."
washingtonwizards,3b5d8x,DarthJones1,0,Fri Jun 26 12:23:32 2015 UTC,"Here are my thoughts as an outsider. I think it's a good idea for y'all to get these young players. I almost think it would be beneficial for you guys to go through a mini-rebuild to gather a lot of young talent. In 4 years, LeBron will be 34, Wall will be 28, and Beal will be 25, and the east will be yours for the taking, especially if Oubre and Grant pan out."
washingtonwizards,3b5dnt,TouchTheSky420,6,Fri Jun 26 02:44:24 2015 UTC,"We didn't trade this year's 2nd round pick, we still have it at 49. We'll probably just select this guy though."
washingtonwizards,3b3mbu,pakilicious,13,Thu Jun 25 18:17:02 2015 UTC,"They'd want more than our first rounder and *our assets are dust bunnies, so that's not happening"
washingtonwizards,3b3mbu,Mehberry,10,Thu Jun 25 18:21:31 2015 UTC,Nene and Webster for Jones -- no way they'd turn that down!
washingtonwizards,3b3mbu,guga31bb,8,Thu Jun 25 20:03:42 2015 UTC,throw in blair and you got a deal
washingtonwizards,3b3mbu,SkinsWiz,5,Thu Jun 25 21:06:39 2015 UTC,if we're getting another Kentucky player I'd rather it be Boogie but I wouldn't mind Jones!
washingtonwizards,3b3mbu,schwoogiejoe24,3,Thu Jun 25 20:29:52 2015 UTC,Acquiring Jones would be far better than drafting Kevon Looney or whoever. I would give them our first + rights to Satoransky. Would have to throw in Temple's contract also I suppose
washingtonwizards,3b3mbu,ireddit270,3,Thu Jun 25 18:54:00 2015 UTC,"He's a great player, but I feel like he'll come at a steep price when Wizards next stepping stone should be strapping down big money for a star player. If there was a way to get him without sacrificing a run at 2016 FAs and while keeping Wall/Beal intact - then I guess so, but I don't know how much leverage we have to do that."
washingtonwizards,3b3mbu,andrewchi,3,Thu Jun 25 19:30:51 2015 UTC,"Would be nice, but the Wiz have no trade assets other than the first round pick. And Temple/ Nene both have huge salaries for their relatively low talent levels so trying to trade them is a no go. Only way i see this happen is if we part with Otto Porter, Gortat or Beal (which all 3 options not happening)."
washingtonwizards,3b3mbu,Source_Wiki,2,Thu Jun 25 19:33:51 2015 UTC,"Would love to see him here. Decent defender, shoots well, and isn't going to clog the paint which will allow Marcin to go to work."
washingtonwizards,3b4788,mrb11n,9,Thu Jun 25 20:49:32 2015 UTC,Ernie can do something shockingly bad if that's what you mean

washingtonwizards,3b5ts9,skinsballr,5,Fri Jun 26 05:19:47 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love the pick of Oubre.  The highest ceiling of anyone at the spot.  Good kid, works hard, and 7-2 wingspan that can also shoot from 3.  We likely weren't looking for a starter in that spot anyways, so to get the highest upside guy that can play multiple positions was solid.  I can't see why he can't play the 4 when other teams go small."
washingtonwizards,3b5ts9,salamanderman10,2,Fri Jun 26 13:46:29 2015 UTC,"Why is everybody upset with the pick if ""Randy doesn't play rookies"". If he took Bobby Portis or another player everyone liked doesn't that point still stand?"
washingtonwizards,3b5ts9,Boymankid,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:36:56 2015 UTC,"Because there's a veteran at the other positions, like Nene/Wall for Portis and Grant; here, w/ the selection of Oubre, you also have Beal/Porter in front of him, resulting in a clash of playing time, if any, for Oubre; at least, w/ the other two players (Portis/Grant), they can get quality 2nd quarter/early 4th quarter minutes while the vets are on the bench."
washingtonwizards,3b5ts9,SonOfSkipBaeless,4,Fri Jun 26 05:48:20 2015 UTC,"This makes zero sense. If anything, there's more competition for minutes at PG and PF.  PG: Wall, Sessions  SG: Beal, Temple  SF: Porter, Webster's corpse  PF: Nene, Humphries, Blair  C: Gortat  And look: Beal, Vesely, and Singleton all played heavy minutes as rookies. He's not a rookie but we just spent a season pulling our hair out over Randy giving Seraphin minutes over Gortat.  Otto played sparingly his rookie year because by the time he recovered from his hip injury -- which cost him his first training camp, his first preseason -- the Wiz were fighting to make the playoffs and he just wasn't as good as Trevor Ariza or Martell Webster. He got jerked around this season but he still played almost 1500 minutes.  The Wiz aren't a developing team anymore. This is a veteran-heavy squad that's trying to win games. There aren't many developmental minutes to be rationed out anymore just for the sake of giving guys some run.  Randy had a very short leash with Otto. It paid off in the playoffs. I'll take that over Flip Saunders letting Nick Young, Javale McGee, and Andray Blatche run wild without consequences any day."
washingtonwizards,3b5ts9,ireddit270,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:37:32 2015 UTC,"There isn't any clash, this team has very poor wing depth. We were trying to develop Rice Jr as an additional young wing, right? Just see Oubre as a replacement for Rice Jr (who hopefully isn't a knucklehead)."
washingtonwizards,3b5ts9,Boymankid,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:06:46 2015 UTC,"My first impression of Oubre was very positive. He looks like he has a winning attitude, which is something I don't think Rice had."

washingtonwizards,3b2ie3,Zomby24,6,Thu Jun 25 13:14:29 2015 UTC,I think I am the only one who is up on Looney.   My dad went to University of Arizona and I saw them play UCLA twice this year and god that team was bad. Looney just carried them in so many ways. My favorite thing about him is his nose for the ball. He is just always where he needs to be on the glass and that is something you can't teach. I think his peak is Farried with a jumper which is a scary thing to consider. I think he can make an immediate impact on the squad.   Looney Looney
washingtonwizards,3b2ie3,Capn_max,2,Thu Jun 25 15:21:41 2015 UTC,"I like Looney too and think he can develop into something special (long-term I think he will have a better shot than Portis) but if we draft him I doubt he breaks into our rotation for at least 2 years, probably more like 3-4. Unfortunately Wittman is really hesitant to play rookies and I think Looney would struggle guarding traditional NBA 4s until he gains some mass, he's just way too skinny and not pro-ready at all."
washingtonwizards,3b2ie3,Plutarch_,3,Thu Jun 25 15:55:08 2015 UTC,"Me and my brother were having an argument about who is better, Jerian Grant or Tyus Jones....  What are you guys opinion? I think Grant would be a lot better of a pro, Jones just looks slow to me, and with his height, that's a bad combo for a PG"
washingtonwizards,3b2ie3,leo2k2ndc,5,Thu Jun 25 13:20:28 2015 UTC,"Tyus as a floor general is amazing though. He's also more consistent from 3.   But I'd prefer Grant cause he could play behind John or Brad and he runs the offense really well too. I like his size better, adds some good depth. That's just what it comes down to in my opinion though."
washingtonwizards,3b2ie3,Zomby24,2,Thu Jun 25 13:32:47 2015 UTC,"Like I said too, I think Grant looked faster, and that's defensively too"

I watched nearly all of his games at UVA this past season; he is a very good defender, has length and athleticism for days, plays with heart, and has a soft touch from mid range. Of course he can't create his own shot but I feel like he could be a good piece on the 2nd unit."

Not saying that I dislike Taddeus Young but he is looking for a long term big money deal and I think he deserves one. I just don't think he is what the Wiz need in the long run.
washingtonwizards,3azy93,trizzzlet,2,Thu Jun 25 02:22:23 2015 UTC,He ain't all that and he's probably looking for 8 figures. I'm cool with Hump.

I think we could get Denver in this too. If they went:  DEN gets: Rudy Gay, Marcin Gortat, Nene (expiring), pick 6, pick 19  SAC gets: Ty Lawson, pick 7, Otto Porter, Kenneth Faried  WAS gets: DeMarcus Cousins  Karl gets his Denver boys. Denver gets an athletic wing, a very good big man, and two first rounders. We get DeMarcus to put with Beal and Wall. Plus we all know DeMarcus and John are close so they wouldn't need too much time to click next season.  God damn it I know it ain't 2k but making this move and then signing KD next year would make us damn near unstoppable. Cousins on this team would be fantastic."

washingtonwizards,3av0fm,skinsballr,3,Wed Jun 24 00:29:55 2015 UTC,"As that trade does not work on ESPN's Trade Machine, what do you all think about this four-team trade?  WAS gets: DeMarcus Cousins and Danillo Gallinari  DEN gets: Rudy Gay, Marcin Gortat, Aaron Affalo  SAC gets: Ty Lawson, Kenneth Faried, Nene and Otto Porter  POR gets: Wilson Chandler and Erik Green and picks  Here's the full trade: http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=ojds6t7  We get a replacement for The Truth; like /u/kobesgoodankle said, George Karl gets the two Nuggets players he wanted the most, and they get a former original Nugget in Nene and a young SF in The Ottoman Empire; the Nuggets get a starting center to pair-up w/ Nurtic, as well as a de-facto #1 in Gay; and the Trail Blazers (in there to make salaries work) get depth at SF with Chandler."
washingtonwizards,3av0fm,stephenporter,2,Tue Jun 23 19:50:50 2015 UTC,Couple things... Arron Afflalo is a free agent and also there's no way SAC is happy with that unless there are some more picks thrown in

With no Paul, not Otto, and only Kris and Kevin, I'm not sure about that. I think our defense would be lacking cause even though offensively we struggled, marcin and nene were good in the low post.

washingtonwizards,3av0fm,youngBS,14,Wed Jun 24 19:53:31 2015 UTC,"TBH. Anyone but Wall.   Beal, Porter, #19 and Gortat. It's extreme, but I can't pass up the chance to add Boogie.  If I'm Durant, Wall/Boogie > Wall/Beal/Porter  Adding Cousins might even sway Pierce to stay one more year and frees up more cap. Beal's max contract would pay him close to 50% more than the deal Cousins has."
washingtonwizards,3av0fm,Drak_is_Right,3,Tue Jun 23 19:12:01 2015 UTC,"I think we'd need to give up gortat, nene ($13 mill expiring), and then 2015 and 2016 1st round picks. I think nene as an expiring is worth more than porter. I'm worried about replacing him in the starting lineup, but he can't start at 4 on a contending team. Maybe 3 team to bring in a PF with more athleticism?"

Minny kicks a 2017 second and 2018 first rounder to Sacramento and the Wiz kick their 2015 first and 2017 first to Sacramento and a 2016 second to Minny.   Washington gets: DeMarcus Cousins, Anthony Bennett  Sacramento gets: Marcin Gortat, Kris Humphries, Otto Porter, DC 2015 1st Rounder, DC 2017 1st Rounder, Minny 2018 1st Rounder,  Minny 2017 2nd rounder  Minnesota gets: Kevin Seraphin, Nik Stauskas, 2016 2nd rounder  I also like this one  Washington gets: DeMarcus Cousins, Ben McLemore  Sacramento gets: Ty Lawson, Bradley Beal, DC 2017 1st  Denver gets: Marcin Gortat, Otto Porter, Jr., DC 2015 1st, Sacramento 2019 1st  I'm not too good with these trade scenarios though so be honest."
washingtonwizards,3av0fm,youngsaiyan,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:08:26 2015 UTC,I think that second scenario has us giving away too much.  I love the first though
washingtonwizards,3av0fm,zedz123,5,Wed Jun 24 16:46:50 2015 UTC,"Pretty much be willing to give them the team excluding Wall. The Kings can much be the Wizards minus Wall, and we can be the Kentucky duo w/ the throw in of KD next year.  .... We would probably be screwed bench wise.   More realistically, Beal, Porter, filler, maybe a pick. Beal is interchangable with two firsts, Porter interchangable with a single first. Might be too steep, but ehh, we would be locking into probably a top three, if not the best 1 and 5 combo in the league for the next half-decade to a decade.   *Full disclosure: Wall - Cousins is pretty much my dream pairing for the NBA, would much rather have Cousins than KD."
washingtonwizards,3av0fm,Mehberry,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:05:22 2015 UTC,"DMC is someone I think would make us a contender. I don't want to give up Beal, but if the deal was right I would pull the trigger. Even if KD didn't come, I think Jdub would have DMC playing on another level.

washingtonwizards,3aqx44,alwaysthinkandplanah,2,Tue Jun 23 04:42:16 2015 UTC,"This isn't totally true. He won't play for us because Ernie has no intention of bringing him over.

But I feel like they would want more than to just unload him...  Since he still has potential to be a something like Derrick Williams a stretchy/athletic big off the bench.  Williams was traded to sac for Luc Mbah a Moute. Luc is a functioning NBA player, Webster is broken.  So if a second could get it done or Tomas's rights I'd personally pull the trigger...  Then less pressure on draft night to draft a big and you can just choose BPA who slips down to our pick."
washingtonwizards,3aqx44,lordofallshit,5,Mon Jun 22 20:08:02 2015 UTC,"I dislike the Wizards a lot and don't want the east getting stronger. That said, I can't believe u guys aren't trying to get a package together for cousins. It would take beal and pieces but cousins is 100x more impactful than beal as a player. The chance to reunite wall and cousins is too good to pass up. That's a duo that could lure durant out of okc honestly....beal, gortat, a few picks???? I dunno..."
washingtonwizards,3aqx44,Just_Another_Thought,2,Tue Jun 23 05:47:01 2015 UTC,"would take beal and pieces   Considering we have good rim protection in gortat and beal is a career 40% 3pt shooter I'd rather us keep beal and move the team in the direction of an effective up tempo slash and kick style offense that Golden State has proven can win a championship. Cousins is a tremendous player, and better than beal, but in terms of team dynamics and the way the NBA is moving I'd rather have a 4 that can hit 3's and a 5 that is more focused on defensive rim protection then he is posting up in a half court game and scoring ala cousins. Cousins also averages nearly two and a half times more turnovers than beal does, negating some of the scoring difference.  Wall and Beal is plenty to get KD to DC. Beal has only played in 3 seasons and was tearing it up before his injury. I don't see Cousins wanting to play second fiddle to anyone and he would have to if KD made the move here. On top of that KD has thrived in OKC without the lane constantly being clogged up and I don't think boogie fits in that picture. He'd have a pass first point guard, which he's never had before, and a + 3pt shooter that teams simply could not leave open, that also has the ability to score on his own as well. To me, that's the perfect fit for KD."
washingtonwizards,3aqx44,oglefro,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:07:07 2015 UTC,We all really love beal. We have Marcin and would have to move him to create cap space (or replace beal)   Neal compliments boogie so well I don't think it would be good to break up that union...  If we got mclemore back I'd think about it but we don't have the assets to get the both of them...   Because Marcin plus beal and a first doesn't open hat door IMO.

washingtonwizards,3apvil,baobao3,7,Mon Jun 22 15:18:05 2015 UTC,A stretch four. Next question
washingtonwizards,3apvil,ChicagoZephyrs,3,Mon Jun 22 15:27:11 2015 UTC,A better GM for one
washingtonwizards,3apvil,Mehberry,4,Mon Jun 22 18:43:52 2015 UTC,"a 2, 3, and a starting 4. We have deadweights in Temple and Webster. Nene is a close deadweight but nowhere near as awful as the first two"
washingtonwizards,3apvil,Shaidester,0,Mon Jun 22 19:11:40 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say Temple is bad... He doesn't play much and at times was asked to play PG.  Webster is straight trash. Nene is washed and we should use him as a backup center to replace KS leaving.  Then draft Kevon looney and let Khump back him up.  We could use another swingman/ combo guard...  Drafting a PG in the second and getting a FA wing sounds feasible. With Sessions we don't NEED another PG.
washingtonwizards,3apvil,oglefro,5,Mon Jun 22 20:01:45 2015 UTC,Temple is a utility kind of player that's only kept around because of Wittman. He's horrible at shooting and his only 'strength' is defense. Everytime he's in the game I grimace.  Nene is known as a player that doesn't want to be a center. Idk how this will play out...  I think our biggest problem is going to be at our 3 position. We only have Otto there assuming Pierce is gone to Cali. Webster suddenly forgot how to shoot a basketball this season so he's just rotting away at our bench and stealing our money.
washingtonwizards,3apvil,Shaidester,3,Mon Jun 22 20:26:43 2015 UTC,Hope EG doesn't fuck up

washingtonwizards,3anpfz,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,3,Mon Jun 22 14:01:45 2015 UTC,"Actually, teams trade for one year contracts all the time to get rid of bad contracts. Martell.

washingtonwizards,3abqb8,WizOfAwesSite,7,Thu Jun 18 20:24:36 2015 UTC,"Makes me appreciate John Wall. #1 pick, all the talent in the world, early exposure to the league's biggest idiots, constant and unfounded criticism from all sides. And now that he's finally a superstar, he knows exactly what he needs to do and puts the team on his back every night without ever being an asshole about it."
washingtonwizards,3abqb8,first_time-long_time,7,Fri Jun 19 05:08:48 2015 UTC,"I was a long term supporter of the fire Wittman club. After these playoffs and his entire tenure here, he really hasn't had the roster that fits his system. He was forced to work with what he had.   This offseason and next season is crucial for Wittman and EG. If EG won't get us a stretch 4 and backup 3 pt shooters in the SF/G positions, EG should get fired and there should be no hesitation. We saw Wittman's system thrive and be dominant when we played with a ""bootlegged stretch 4"" (basically saying Gooden was a shit, pirated version of a stretch 4). We had terrible spacing issues which other teams took advantage of. We finally learned that Nené and Gortat can't coexist on the court together. We saw the huge increase in 3pa's in our new offense. Wall was unguardable and had a ""superstar"" like effect on the offense and the opposing team's defense.   With a stretch 4 and more shooters on the squad, Wall can do what ever the heck he wants (but hopefully not do buzzer beaters). Gortat can be at his full strength in the pick and roll. Wall/Gortat can dish to any of the shooters if the roll fails/opens up space. Wittman showed glimpses of this magnificence with a roster not designed to do that.  Our players love Wittman and defended him amongst all the controversy. I feel that John Wall would be the type of player to feel betrayed if Wittman get's canned during a winning season.  We need to ride with Wittman one last time with hopefully an improved roster or EG and Wittman will have to go."
washingtonwizards,3abqb8,Gr8WallofChinatown,3,Thu Jun 18 23:35:36 2015 UTC,i think EG has needed to go and should go before Wittman

Wittman's playcalling in the last minute has been embarrassing as the wizards squander time and waste opportunities for comebacks or to close out games."
washingtonwizards,3abqb8,PieceOfPie_SK,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:27:29 2015 UTC,"Watching him stare aimlessly on the sidelines was painful at times.   Yup. Accurate statement right there. I hated when they mic'd Blatt up during the Finals, because 9 times out of ten, Blatt would be saying something in the huddle that was a variation of, ""keep fighting guys, come on we can win!""  Blatt rarely says anything of substance. I think him coaching a LeBron-less Cavs team would have been a good rookie start for him. It's not easy for a rookie coach to jump into leading a team with the (self proclaimed, but probably still deserving of the title) ""world's best basketball player.""   Based on LeBron's previous tendencies to take over, of course there's gonna be times where he may step on Blatt's toes. I think Blatt deserves to coach a different team, and I'm excited to see what he would be able to prove if he's ever given that opportunity.   But yeah, Wittman seems to be more involved than Blatt and players on the Wizards like him more than Cavs players like Blatt. Still think they need to at least advance to ECF this year for him to keep his job.  Nonetheless, good article, tough to do offseason writing this time but this one was a good conversation starter. Love reading FanSided."

Maybe we will have 5 mil if Paul leaves but otherwise just the midlevel exception, which is about 5 mil.  If paul leaves we will still have this exception but cannot give  all 10 mil to one player for tax reasons.  are we getting a starting 4 for 5 mil, no.    2.) The only thing we have of value that we are willing to trade is expiring contracts but we won't bring back any long term money because we are holding space open for KD.  So we won't make any major deals this summer, and our only acquisitions will be for rotation guys.     3.) We won't start a rookie  Edit: I was bored so I listed all free agents I will put $ under guys we probably can't get under the cap, Rs next to restricted free agents, PO and TO for player and team option, I may have missed a $ or R along the way  Love ($), Aldridge($), Millsap($), Josh smith, Tristan Thompson (R and $), David West (PO likely opt in), Thaddeus Young (PO ??), Brandon Bass($), Amare, Boozer($), Jordan Hill (TO), Ed Davis (PO out), KG (retiring??), Amir Johnson ($), Scola, Bargnani($), Hansbrough, Blatche, Thomas Robinson, Jonas Jerebko, Mbah a Moute, Glen Davis($), Jason Smith, Reggie Evans, Darrell Arthur, Matt Bonner(not leaving SA), Villanuavo, Pero antic(R), Lavoy Allen, Quincy Acy, Joel Freeland(R), Jason Maxiel, Chuck Hayes, Brand (retire??), Louis Amundson, Ekpe Uduh, Shayne Whittenton (R)"

washingtonwizards,3ab9dk,oxicl3an,2,Fri Jun 19 18:06:31 2015 UTC,I really like David Lee but I don't think he's a fit. Marcin isn't good enough to cover his ass.
washingtonwizards,3ab9dk,Zomby24,2,Thu Jun 18 22:54:26 2015 UTC,"I don't know how you fit his contract in...Golden State would trade him for cap relief, because with luxury tax he costs like $35 million to them next year.  The Wizards would only acquire Lee if they could make the cap room, which would require them dumping other contracts.  I guess if some other team wanted Nene, then you could do a 3 team deal with Nene to that other team, Lee to the Wizards, and probably like a 2nd round pick or something to Golden State.  That seems really unlikely though.  I say start Humphries at the 4 and Porter at the 3 and play Pierce off the bench as a stretch 4."
washingtonwizards,3ab9dk,imthewalrus610,2,Fri Jun 19 20:35:08 2015 UTC,If I were the GM of the Sixers I would sign shitty players to 2 year deals paying them a ton of money and have the 2nd year be a non-guaranteed salary.  They could then trade them for cap relief to teams looking for space in 2016.  The players win because they get overpaid year 1.

washingtonwizards,3ab9dk,Mehberry,7,Thu Jun 18 18:34:39 2015 UTC,I think that they are equal at this point with D lee being better on O and KSlife being better at D (as hard as that is to say haha).
washingtonwizards,3ab9dk,MegaSupremeTaco,3,Thu Jun 18 18:44:21 2015 UTC,"I know defense is an essential component to ultimately winning a final series, but I feel like Lee's offensive production outweighs KS's defensive capabilities in the general scheme of things. Maybe hope offense overcomes the inevitable points given-up? Sounds like a gamble, but Wiz seem to benefit tremendously from playing fast and KS is like the kryptonite to that on offense. He's a ball-stopper and runs like a 8 second iso in the paint for an average-at-best hook shot."

washingtonwizards,3ab9dk,andrewchi,2,Fri Jun 19 16:27:21 2015 UTC,He's not a stretch four. Our problem is spacing with out already crowded and stacked front court. We need a stretch 4 badly (word on the street Kris Humphries is developing into one)
washingtonwizards,3ab9dk,Gr8WallofChinatown,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:25:45 2015 UTC,"I know D lee production has dropped off but I felt like just a year or two ago he was a 16-18ppg and 10+ boards consistent. What's the problem- besides contract. He's early 30's and now hungry. Front court of Gortat, Humphries, Nene or D Lee and Seraphin as high energy type guy for 5-7 mins off bench. We can do better than Gooden (but his contributions are appreciated)"
washingtonwizards,3ab9dk,LexisNexiss,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:53:57 2015 UTC,"We want someone who can space the floor at the 4. Gortat even said this, and it's obvious how much better we play when we went with Pierce at the 4 (or even when Gooden hits a quarter of the threes he attempts). I don't think this team needs a PF with poor midrange/perimeter shooting and bad defense.  Unfortunately, our salary situation makes it hard to go for such a player without giving up a lot (like a first round pick!). I like Illyasova as a possible option. I like Anderson, too (although we give up a ton of defense with him). I really don't think our 4 position is cutting it at the moment, so upgrading it is a top priority, in my opinion. If we could flip Humphries or Nene into a halfway decent stretch 4, I'd be very happy."

They need a veteran big man who can protect the rim like NeNe used to and a veteran back up point guard.   If Paul retires then they desperately need to lock down that veteran presence at small forward, preferably someone with an edge. I could see a Matt Barnes working out although he clearly doesn't have that shooting ability, he is a plus defender.  If anything I'd rather they trade the pick they have now to secure a starting power forward and/or replacement to Paul Pierce. The only reason they should even consider getting another pick is to put together a trade package. The analysis in this article is atrocious."

washingtonwizards,39jc2b,ClarkeM21,11,Fri Jun 12 03:09:37 2015 UTC,"First of, let me say that's awesome.  May I ask how you became a fan of the WizKids?    Prices will go up since the Wizards made the playoffs for consecutive seasons.  However, single tickets are usually easy to come by since people are desperate to sell the one ticket.  Hope you're lucky to find 4 decently priced tickets to 4 games. I think the cheapest tickets are around $20 for nosebleed seats.  I've come across fairly good seats in the 200s for $45 and up.  It really depends.  For sucky teams like the Philadelphia 76ers, it shouldn't be a problem.  However, elite teams like the Golden State Warriors tend to be more expensive. Best place to sit is in the 200s or below because sometimes, you're lucky to catch a free shirt or free Chick-Fil-A sandwiches from the rafters. If you can, attend a Washington Capitals game.  Even if you aren't a fan of hockey, the atmosphere is always intense and amazing.  For amazing breakfast food 24 hours a day, I recommend Bob and Edith's Diner.   I recommend you stay in a hotel outside the city, like somewhere in Falls Church, Virginia.  It may be a bit cheaper.  You can always hop on the subway system that we call the DC Metro and you'll be in and around DC in a matter of minutes. dcRising"
washingtonwizards,39jc2b,yekmoney,3,Fri Jun 12 06:47:16 2015 UTC,"All I can say is I'm jealous. The lockout was in effect when I came over from Melbourne, but I loved DC anyway. Just go to all of the museums etc. I didn't get much time to go to bars unfortunately."
washingtonwizards,39jc2b,a_child_to_criticize,3,Fri Jun 12 04:05:31 2015 UTC,"I would go to 4 games in shitty seats instead of 2 in ok seats. The 400 section (highest) is fine as long as the seats are somewhat close to the middle.   Then again nothing beats courtside tickets. You hear the players talk, you can yell at them and they will hear you, and the game is much more intense. But courtside tix are on the other side of the spectrum; they are expensive as shit.  As far as nightlife, if you are of university age you cannot go wrong with Georgetown bars, and the area surrounding the Verizon Center is bumping on game nights( the Caps also play there), as well as Dupont Circle."
washingtonwizards,39jc2b,steamingwankbag,3,Fri Jun 12 06:31:51 2015 UTC,"Fellow Australian, cant answer anything, just saying how jealous I am. Even the days when aus ESPN bother to put a Wiz game on feels like christmas."
washingtonwizards,39jc2b,manofdahour,2,Fri Jun 12 08:40:03 2015 UTC,"for night life/bars: U street, Adams Morgan, Dupont Circle are the spots. hella bars and restaurants down there"
washingtonwizards,39jc2b,madlate,2,Fri Jun 12 05:09:23 2015 UTC,"As others have stated prices depend on the quality of the team the Wizards are playing. I was a season ticket holder last year and I can tell you season ticket prices for the lower level increased from $55 to $66 per ticket/game so definitely expect to see an increase in ticket prices.  I would definitely sit in sections 217, 216, 215, 214 or 213. 217 and 213 will be a little cheaper than the other 3 because they're not exactly in the middle. Those seats are usually pretty affordable (probably $80-$100 a ticket) and give a great view. You definitely want to be facing the benches, not behind the benches, because most of the time the halftime and between quarters/timeouts entertainment (cheerleaders) focus their performances to that side of the arena.  As for nightlife, the green turtle is usually packed before and during games and you can enter the Verizon center from inside the bar. There's a bunch of bars right around the Verizon center as well but I haven't been to many of them honestly.   If you're looking for things to do during the day the spy museum is a lot of fun and is right down the street from the Verizon center. It does cost money though. Gordon Beirsch is a good place to eat/grab a beer before the game as well and is also a block down the street from the Verizon center.  Hope that was helpful!"

washingtonwizards,39jc2b,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:29:00 2015 UTC,"Use Seatgeek, a secondary market resale aggregator, to buy your tickets. For a single ticket, you should be able to pay below face value for every game except possibly the Cavs (Lebron), Lakers (Kobe), Thunder (Durant) or Celtics (just lots of locally-based fans).  The schedule won't be out until August so it's possible they could be in the middle of a home stand, or a West Coast road trip. You might want to wait to book your times here until the schedule is released.  You don't say what your budget is but I would recommend trying to see at least one game from prime seats (bottom half of lower level courtside), which typically have $150-200 per ticket face value but you should be able to get for less than that. (I've found that ""VIP"" tickets where you are on the floor behind the front row to be not as good as being 5-10 rows up, despite being higher priced.) If you can then afford tickets for other games, go for it.  This is DC. There are hundreds of tourist-friendly free things to do here. Best city to visit in the country when it comes to free attractions. We have a bar culture but not a huge late-night nightlife culture in the way that NYC, Vegas or Miami do. Whatever you do, though, DO NOT decide to spend any money to go see that local NFL team in their horrible, miserable stadium in Landover. Just don't.  If you want to be close to the arena downtown, the Hotel Monaco is across the street and the Fairfield Suites is a block away. If you have some money to spend, check out the Marriott Marquis Convention Center which is new and has a spectacular lobby, and is four blocks from VC. If you're on a budget, we have a few hostels. DC is not as expensive as NYC when it comes to hotels, and generally there is good availability at that time of the year (April to July is our tourist high season)."

washingtonwizards,39go0x,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,2,Fri Jun 12 16:20:14 2015 UTC,"I think my board for 19 is looking like this:   Any of the top 7 + WCS if they were to fall Myles Turner Explore trade options regarding a falling top prospect Stanley Johnson Bobby Portis Frank Kaminsky Kelly Oubre Christian Wood Kevon Looney Try to trade down Rondae Hollis-Jefferson Backup guard   At 49, I would just take the best available/highest upside guy.

Great energy guy too, I just see him as a great complimentary player in the league  Bias aside, whichever 4 who is the best combination of shooter and rebounder available"
washingtonwizards,39go0x,SweaterMop,3,Thu Jun 11 16:41:18 2015 UTC,I like Anderson too (currently a student there) but when would get playing time? We want Porter to develop too. Our biggest problem is our 4 pos.

washingtonwizards,39hdjw,trizzzlet,14,Thu Jun 11 18:52:28 2015 UTC,Keep Nene & Webster because i'm not giving up a draft pick to get them off my hands and they are both expiring  Draft the best available that's not a point guard. If Pierce leaves we have nobody to play behind Beal or Otto so a 2-3 will be as important as a 4-5.   Find that stretch 4 and sign Gerald Green or KJ McDaniels (if we have the cap room)
washingtonwizards,39hdjw,DWood10,6,Thu Jun 11 19:14:01 2015 UTC,Honestly this is pretty reasonable.  I don' think anything drastic needs to be done to this squad this year.
washingtonwizards,39hdjw,TophMasterFlex,3,Thu Jun 11 19:52:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah we can make our imprint in 2016 FA. Right now lets just stay competitive and let Wall, Beal & Otto get another year under their belt"
washingtonwizards,39hdjw,DWood10,3,Thu Jun 11 20:37:57 2015 UTC,"Right, no one's going to eat Nene's $13m or Webster's $5.7m, but what would you do with them? I think I would experiment with Nene as the backup 5 who Sessions could feed the ball to down low and bruise some 2nd string type guys. But what does that mean for the 4? Who would we pair on the 2nd unit with him, the Rookie, Blair, or Hump?"
washingtonwizards,39hdjw,DWood10,2,Thu Jun 11 20:09:57 2015 UTC,Nene as a backup 5 paired with Hump and just let Webster sit on the bench as a overpaid 3rd string 2/3. If we get our stretch 4 in FA or trade he should start and let the rookie sit for the year and let him play next year

washingtonwizards,39hdjw,Mehberry,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:12:01 2015 UTC,It is actually incredibly hard to imagine downgrading from Martell Webster.
washingtonwizards,39hdjw,SonOfSkipBaeless,0,Fri Jun 12 05:15:20 2015 UTC,Why not a PG? Guard depth has been a problem for years.
washingtonwizards,39hdjw,DWood10,2,Thu Jun 11 23:42:28 2015 UTC,"It's not a necessity right now. We have Wall, Sessions and potentially Will Bynum right now. We need a big or 2/3 a lot more then a point"
washingtonwizards,39hdjw,SonOfSkipBaeless,2,Thu Jun 11 23:51:13 2015 UTC,Sessions is another expiring contract and I have as much faith in him lasting 2 seasons as I do the last 473737734 scrap heap backup guards. Depth is nice. Depth keeps Wall and Beal from averaging 40 mpg in the early rounds of the playoffs and allows the Wiz to make trades from a position of strength rather than desperation.
washingtonwizards,39hdjw,dabigfella,2,Fri Jun 12 01:08:26 2015 UTC,"I think we all know KD is plan A. If we get Durant next summer, anything we do now is basically irrelevant because of how much better that will make us.  As for realistic thinking, I agree with the first poster, keep Nene/Martell, there is no way we get a favorable deal to unload those two.  In the draft, I'm looking at the longer stretch bigs (Turner, Portis, Kaminsky, Wood) and the wing guys who might fall to us (Oubre, Johnson, Dekker, Hollis-Jefferson) as the primary targets.  I think trading down to get Wood and pick up some other asset in the process might be an optimal move.  For free agency, I doubt we will have cap room to sign McDaniels. Furthermore, I worry that he won't want to be slotted into a backup role for the entirety of his contract. Gerald Green may be available for cheap and he would fill a need as both a bench scorer and a lanky wing. There are a bunch of other guys who would fill a need, but most likely will command a bigger salary than we can pay up. Ideally, if we play the waiting game, we could get a bargain on one of the following: Millsap, Thaddeus Young, Jeff Green, or Brandon Bass. I would also love to see us take a chance on a guy like Thomas Robinson or John Jenkins for the minimum.  I think we're in for an uneventful summer full of low risk/low reward moves. Hopefully, striking a couple of bargains in free agency will help us inch towards having a contending team."

Can play as an undersized center but he is not good offensively. He can't shoot jumpers which won't fit the Wittman offense. We need a stretch 4 and Rakeem isn't a stretch 4.
washingtonwizards,39cznf,Gr8WallofChinatown,2,Thu Jun 11 03:56:13 2015 UTC,"He was 3rd in the ACC in scoring and has been developing his jumper.

washingtonwizards,39e1zl,WizOfAwesSite,9,Thu Jun 11 03:06:54 2015 UTC,Dez Wells is a close friend of Wall. He hangs out with him all the time. He's not a proven 3pt shooter but he did make clutch 3s for the Terps. He can be a worthy borderline 2nd rounder. I bumped into him many times. He's a very good leader. Decent finisher but needs to work on his defense.

Was a back up to Satorasky (Damn you EG). Satorasky left the team and NR became a starter. Ben Woodside took his starting position but NR was still 5th in possessions and second in assists.  30% perimeter shooter. Subpar handling skills. Ace passer. Lack of explosiveness. Not athletic. Decent at pick and roll. 65% FT shooter. Good slasher. Sub par defender.  Wizards back up G needs: 3pt shooter. Facilitator. Very good at PnR. Defense.  NR has 1.5/4. Sounds like another EG signature Euro fail

washingtonwizards,392ok3,WizOfAwesSite,2,Mon Jun 8 20:37:18 2015 UTC,"I watched a ton of Louisville games this year and I am REALLY hoping the Wizards don't even consider drafting him. He is not a first round talent. He has absolutely no offensive game; I don't mean just shooting. He has zero post offense as well. I get that he hustles, but he is also one of the dumbest basketball players I have ever watched. No clue how spacing on offense works/where he should be, terrible passer, and is awful at off ball on defense. Combine all of this with being undersized and an average rebounder and I don't see why we would take him here. The only thing is does well is hustle and be athletic (those are useful skills). His best case scenario is a Tristan Thompson/Faried type player and worst case is our old friend Jan Vesely (I see this as more likely). Also, he's the type headcase who does this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IllusASoKb0"
washingtonwizards,392ok3,b0flex,2,Wed Jun 10 05:15:37 2015 UTC,"I watched allot of ACC games last year and I think the best comparison to Harrell is someone who is already a Wizard, DeJuan Blair.  Don't get me wrong, I like Blair allot, watching him at Pitt and Dallas.  I think it is amazing that he can even play let alone at a high level considering his knee issues.  Blair is a veteran in the NBA, and that is huge compliment.  Harrell might be a solid rotation big, but he is undersized at power forward and doesn't have an outside game so he can't play small forward.  Our biggest need is getting a backup point guard and filling Pierce's minutes if he leaves, I need less Webster in my life and he would play allot of Pierce's minutes as it stands."
washingtonwizards,392ok3,ltrain430,3,Mon Jun 8 21:03:27 2015 UTC,"I don't see the comparison with DeJuan Blair, but I don't think he is a fit (which is similar to Blair).   I feel like Harrell would be like redrafting Trevor Booker. If the point is trying to spread the floor draft a guy who already has a good mid-range/3-point shot."
washingtonwizards,392ok3,disasterjsl,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:32:36 2015 UTC,"Harrell is way more explosive than Blair. Also, when Blair is in shape, he's capable of playing the backup 5.   Booker was awesome in D.C. Wiz need someone who can run w/ the back court. Harrell fits the bill. Not many better options at 19."
washingtonwizards,392ok3,ltrain430,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:40:59 2015 UTC,"Blair was pretty athletic when he was in college, he has gotten a bit wider since entering the NBA.  Here he is his rookie season  He was going to be a lottery pick but slid because during his physical they discovered he didn't have an acl in either knee.  Tyus Jones from Duke, and Jerian Grant from Notre Dame should be available and may be able to be backup in a year or two.  I like Harrell's teammate Rozier better than both of them but draft boards kinda hate him.  Outside of the ACC I don't know about any PGs available."
washingtonwizards,392ok3,b0flex,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:08:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Blair comp. is necessarily a bad one nor should it stop teams from taking Harrell. When physically fit, Blair is a capable backup.  Harrell is much quicker than Blair and excels in transition. His jumper has improved, too. After a workout with the Jazz, he talked about adding a 3-point shot. Blair's outside shot is virtually nonexistent.  As for point guards, I really like Jerian Grant. I'd be surprised if he's available. I think a team will become enamored and take him before 19th. I like Delon Wright as well.  Washington will have plenty of options. Will be hard to botch this pick."
washingtonwizards,392ok3,ChicagoZephyrs,2,Tue Jun 9 01:28:02 2015 UTC,"There was also a lot of talk about him having a 3-pt shot coming into this past season (being a UVA fan, this scared me). Turns out, he still sucked at shooting and shot about 25% this year. Factor in his career sub-60% shooting from the line and he doesn't project as a good shooter. I don't have a lot of faith in someone who already talked about having and jumper and failed to deliver. His NBA role screams (to me) guy who doesn't play until the team is down by 20 and the coach gets desperate"

I told my mom and pointed over to him and she didn't waste any time rushing me over so that I could meet him. He was super friendly and tried having a conversation with me but I was so starstruck I couldn't really talk. He also signed my aunt's shopping list for me! It was all the paper I had on me, and I've even kept the pen he used!"
washingtonwizards,38xpof,WizOfAwesSite,8,Sun Jun 7 19:02:57 2015 UTC,"No one is available right now... we need a good offensive assistant (Dan Tony????) and try to see how next season goes. A full year without 3 guys over 35 + Martell playing big minutes will be huge, as will Otto being able to guard the other teams best wing.  I think we'll be better than the Hawks and Raptors, probably Bulls, and then we'll have to see what happens with Indiana and Cleveland. If we go to the ECF next year, Witt stays.  Again, if there were good options out there, that seem to be a good fit, I'd be down, but everyone just says ""Spurs Assistant."" Gentry got picked up, and hopefully we don't do dumb shit like hire a college coach or Jackson."
washingtonwizards,38xpof,kamikazemelonman,3,Mon Jun 8 04:04:47 2015 UTC,"Forgot Thibs, if we get Thibs I'll lose my shit Oh My God PLEASE"
washingtonwizards,38xpof,kamikazemelonman,9,Mon Jun 8 04:05:42 2015 UTC,"I dunno, wouldn't getting Thibs be a little redundant? We already have a good defensive coach in Wittman, but we are lacking somebody who can manage our offense better."
washingtonwizards,38xpof,Ourano,2,Mon Jun 8 14:51:51 2015 UTC,Yes Thibs and Randy are both defensive coaches... but Thibs also designed modern defense. Its the same way both Kent Bazemore and Gary Payton are defensive players
washingtonwizards,38xpof,kamikazemelonman,2,Mon Jun 8 15:20:34 2015 UTC,"Can you explain? For all the years I've watched basketball and for how much I love basketball, I only started learning about offensive/defensive sets this year."
washingtonwizards,38xpof,Ourano,5,Mon Jun 8 15:36:34 2015 UTC,"Sure! Thibs created a defense commonly referred to as a ""Hybrid Zone"" while he was an assistant on the Celtics. It's a mix of guarding man with some players, and zone with others, based on court position. Hence why people help off a shooter in the corner to stop people from driving, forcing the kick out, then sprint back and recover. Obviously that concept was around before Thibs, but he designed a whole system around it that's a bit too complicated for me to explain while at an internship right now (and if I'm being honest, too complicated for me to understand just from reading about it and watching the games). I'll try to come back later tonight and explain better.  However, most teams in the league adopted this after seeing how effective it was (Celtics never lost a playoff series with a healthy starting 5 of KG-Allen-Pierce-Perk-Rondo). Boston led the league in defense for a few years, everyone starting using the system, and other teams built offenses to take advantage.  Google ""thibs defense system"" if you're interested."
washingtonwizards,38xpof,kamikazemelonman,3,Mon Jun 8 15:57:29 2015 UTC,"Lets start with the old rules on defense which are kinda confusing but can be simplified to say that players on the weak side of a play had to stay out of the paint unless they were going to double team someone or closely guarding an opposing player.  Basically players on the opposite side of the ball couldn't go into the lane.  This was eliminated and now any defender can go wherever he wants whenever he wants provided he not stay in the lane for three seconds if he is on the weak side.  This rule change is the basis of Thibs defense.  In both Chicago and Boston he tries to force the ballhandler to one side or the other creating a strong and weak side.  When the ball is on one side the weak side defenders will sag off their man and go into the paint where they can act as a help defender should the ballhandler get into the lane.  Where he has changed strategies is how the big defends the pick and roll.  In Chicago the big men hang back on any pick and roll and the on the ball defender would try to funnel the driver away from the paint towards the sagging big.  In Boston they did the opposite with the big stepping out to cover the ball handler, it didn't hurt that he had Garnett."
washingtonwizards,38xpof,ltrain430,2,Tue Jun 9 02:37:44 2015 UTC,That's my thinking as well.
washingtonwizards,38xpof,akutabi,3,Mon Jun 8 15:21:20 2015 UTC,"Thibs is kind of rumored to have ran Noah and Rose into the ground, and was doing the same with Butler with him basically averaging 38+ mpg the past few seasons. How would you feel with him doing this with injury prone brad? I like thibs but we should probably remember the reason he was fired as well and look at strengths and weaknesses"
washingtonwizards,38xpof,blast0ise,2,Mon Jun 8 19:07:12 2015 UTC,"Yep, he does play people a lot of minutes, but other people play 38 MPG in the association. The only player that he really ran into the ground was Luol Deng. admittedly that was horrible, but don't forget what this man accomplishes with a worse roster than we have. He  won 48 games with Joakim Noah as his best player.. That's remarkable"
washingtonwizards,38xpof,kamikazemelonman,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:28:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying he wasn't a good coach and didn't get the best out of his players. He was great at that, and it was his greatest strength to use everything to their fullest abilities. But my issue is that he would run his players into the ground and they would be gassed for the playoffs since he plays every regular season game like it is a must win. I would say he overplayed was Noah, who basically played the whole season injured (never really got a chance to get fully healthy) and Butler was well on his way to being exhausted for the playoffs before getting a few weeks off before the playoffs due to an injury.  At some point strategic rest periods and breaks must be used for the players benefit. Jimmy Butler has lead the league in MPG the past 2 seasons at 38.7 minutes and over 42.2 mpg the in the playoffs the past 3 years. This is where management and he clashed, and even though they handled the whole situation poorly, I would side with management when it came to preserving players for the important stretches."

washingtonwizards,38xpof,kamikazemelonman,6,Mon Jun 8 15:18:57 2015 UTC,"Can't believe the pass Ernie gets from Wiz fans. Witt wanted more bigs last summer but Ernie's the one who actually put the roster together. The lack of backcourt depth isn't Witt's fault. Vesely and Singleton and Crawford washing out of the league isn't his fault. Martell Webster's contract isn't his fault. Not paying Booker or Ariza isn't his fault. It's not his fault Seraphin hears Paul Pierce yell ""SET A SCREEN"" and starts posting up instead.  The Wiz aren't the Warriors. They don't have 500 guys with 6'9 wingspans or a PG who can shoot from the hip. If they start playing small ball with this roster, how're they gonna get stops and create those transition opportunities where Wall shines? If they stay with the big lineup, how do you manufacture more clean looks at the rim in the halfcourt offense with a core of three non-shooters?  Yeah, I wish Otto got more PT during the season. But his defensive lapses and offensive passivity were real. Witt has a short leash. The guy before him had a long leash - how'd that go? Most coaches are gonna favor vets. Most coaches are gonna favor the guy who gets paid the most. Even Steve Kerr had David Lee penciled in as a starter until he got hurt in preseason.  I'm not married to Witt. The best thing he has going for him is tenure. But replacing him won't fix the heart of the Wizards' issues. That's personnel and that's the responsibility of the mustache. This franchise relieved Wes Unseld and Michael Jordan of duty but Ernie's stuck around for 12 seasons without sniffing the conference finals. The Knicks chose Pat Riley over this guy. What the hell is his secret?"

washingtonwizards,38xpof,MisterDobalina,2,Mon Jun 8 19:07:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm all for it if there's a bonafide replacement who can run a sophisticated offense or something more uptempo. I'm confident the team can take what Randy has taught defensively and move forward. Not to mention a lot of defense relies on John being a freak/explosive athlete.   With that being said, we've waited too long and it appears the window has closed unless we want to pursue another defensive minded coach. Then the thought is, is that kind of upgrade even worth the risk? I'd rather let this next season play out despite calling for Randy's head the last two offseasons. Then hopefully we can get our pick at a much more offensively competent coach than gambling on our future a year before KD is a FA.   Oddly enough I think D'antoni might have worked with this team if we were willing to pull the trigger and also commit to defense. Also too bad that Tyronn Lue will be gunning for a HC job after the finals."

I don't have much of an opinion on the dougie, but I feel like other players have to have done things more immature than that - and on a more consistent basis. I mean, setting aside the isolated dougie incident, Wall, to me, doesn't strike me as immature."

This not only gets them attention when they first say the ridiculous thing but will also lead to people talking about them again when they are either   A) proven to be full of shit   or B) somehow proven right.  So even when they're proven to be full of shit they keep standing by their statements because well, they don't care about facts, they care about TV time and how much people are talking about them.

It was nice to see the offense stay up tempo when John would sit, and Ramon took it to the hoop at times where it seemed like the rest of the team was reluctant to go for a contested layup and get a foul. Likewise, I really liked the two point guard configurations they would run and they seemed to work. The lack of bench depth. 2-3 slots filled by guys who simply never played was and is huge. The next 2 slots were guys who lacked multi-dimensional games. We can't have 5 slots filled with DNPs and guys who don't play defense."

Andre Miller's old man magic fell off a cliff and he was just playing like an old man. Pierce needed rest Gortats confidence was shot and Wittman did nothing to help him get it back. Instead Wittman just sat his high paid center instead of running plays and getting him more touches. Wittmans offensive gameplan of ""take what the defense gives you"""
washingtonwizards,38j2n1,Kirbybajerby,6,Thu Jun 4 16:55:14 2015 UTC,"All of this and shooting Otto's confidence. Whenever he made a mistake he was benched but Webster, Butler & Temple had long leashes with Wittman"
washingtonwizards,38j2n1,DWood10,5,Thu Jun 4 17:51:58 2015 UTC,"The team thinks a lot of it was mental..   Massive regression after the unsustainable 22-8 start.  You know the saying ""Generals always fight the last war?"" This Wiz team was designed to beat last year's Pacers and Bulls. Given that most teams this year were not like the Rose-less Bulls or the Pacers with Paul George, the squad was always structurally flawed.  They transcended their limitations for a while thanks to unsustainably good shooting from Rasual Butler and to an extent Kris Humphries but after a while the jig was up. I think that first west coast road trip was a brutal reality check for a lot of the guys after the 22-8 start.  Management didn't want to make big moves mid-season or use the roster spot they were saving for Ray Allen and somehow Andre Miller's defense became the scapegoat. Paul Pierce is notorious for sandbagging and Nene's a malingerer. Gortat had whatever his personal problems were (I think it was over a girl). Wall and Beal had their injuries. Eventually the dam broke."

I'd find it really surprising for a palyer of his caliber not to end up in either. OKC can offer him the money and the home he's known for a while with a  decent run at a ring. DC can offer essentially the same minus some cash and his hometown.  I'd say 60-40 if not 55-45 in favor of DC; but that can change with a decent season next year.

I know boogie and Wall are tight but Beal is like a little brother to Wall and they are doing great developing together. McLemore had the potential to be one of the best 2 guards in the league when he got drafted but holy shit he has no competitive edge and is so damn passive. Beal really showed that bark and attitude last playoffs.

washingtonwizards,38dkkb,DWood10,2,Wed Jun 3 20:44:55 2015 UTC,"No way the Kings would actually do this deal.  Players worth far more then their max contract are rare.

It would definitely be sad to see Beal go, but I'd get over it the second I put on my Cousins Wizards jersey.  And McLemore might not be as pure a jump shooter, but he's a young athletic SG that is a beast in his own right.  Throw KD in there in 2016... Shiiiieetttt!"

washingtonwizards,38dkkb,ruffus4life,2,Thu Jun 4 16:13:05 2015 UTC,"I really like this trade.  Boogie will be a top 1-2 center for many years to come & the author is right, you need elite stars to win in this league.  Bradley Beal is a good guy & a great talent, but I think we all overrate his potential.  I don't feel comfortable giving him the max."
washingtonwizards,38dkkb,pakilicious,9,Wed Jun 3 16:10:19 2015 UTC,I think you underrate his potential as a 22 year old

washingtonwizards,38dkkb,TylertheHater,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:48:47 2015 UTC,"What were your expectations of Otto?  Most expect him to be a good 2 way player in the vein of Tayshaun Prince. Not really ""perennial all star"" but more than good enough to be a really good piece on a contender. Those expectations are valid."
washingtonwizards,38dkkb,Boymankid,3,Thu Jun 4 04:15:09 2015 UTC,Those are fair expectations. I tend to have higher expectations of players drafted 3rd overall though. Time is on his side but he'll need to improve A LOT defensively before the Tayshaun comparisons are valid. Tayshaun was one of the better defenders in the league for a period. I still believe he'll be a better offensive player than Tayshaun and we'll certainly need that production. I guess I'm saying that the jury is still out. Next season will tell us a lot barring any unforeseen shakeup at SF.
washingtonwizards,38dkkb,TylertheHater,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:35:06 2015 UTC,SGs take a few years to develop. Don't forget that. He's about ready to blossom as seen in the playoffs. He performs on the big stage consistently but he does need to work on the regular season a bit.
washingtonwizards,38dkkb,Shaidester,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:40:45 2015 UTC,Nope. Otto and Beal together are worth more to us when we can make a play for a free agent in 2016. I would love to see Boogie in DC but not at that cost
washingtonwizards,38dkkb,Boymankid,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:13:21 2015 UTC,"I think in reality you probably have to keep Nene and Otto, but include Gortat who is a quality center for the Kings.  Not sure why the Kings would take Nene other than the shorter length of his deal.  But the truth is that this kind of deal is unlikely for so many reasons."

washingtonwizards,388vuf,ATN5,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:57:08 2015 UTC,"I used to hate how Nick Young would negate assists from Wall by passing up the open shot, dribble around, then take a contested fade-away."
washingtonwizards,388vuf,MisterDobalina,-4,Wed Jun 3 13:17:36 2015 UTC,Believe it or not but I wouldn't mind having Young come of the bench....
washingtonwizards,384kfs,WizOfAwesSite,6,Mon Jun 1 20:26:18 2015 UTC,"I know everyone is tired of Nene but Gallo would be a rental as his contract is up in 2016 ($11m+), so what does this do other than buy us an interim fix for the upcoming season?"
washingtonwizards,384kfs,Obersts001,3,Mon Jun 1 20:38:25 2015 UTC,"Gallo is only 26-years-old. If he plays well, then Washington could re-sign him if Kevin Durant opts to stay in OKC."
washingtonwizards,384kfs,smilezandsouthstar,13,Mon Jun 1 21:36:24 2015 UTC,Or he walks while the Wiz are waiting on Durant.  Or he gets overpaid a la Gortat because the Wiz don't want to trade an asset for a guy and have nothing to show for it a year later. This has a classic Grunfeld ending written all over it. Digging another hole to get himself out of the previous hole.
washingtonwizards,384kfs,smilezandsouthstar,2,Mon Jun 1 22:24:02 2015 UTC,"The Wizards have been planning on the KD thing for quite some time -- hence the reason they've signed FA's only through 2016.   If KD wants to come to D.C., it'll happen. If he doesn't, then Gallo would be an OK fall-back option. Don't think EG's previous moves should stop him from making ones that would help the team now.   Besides, Denver's GM (Tim Connelly) worked in the Wiz front office. They could prob. work out a deal w/o including a pick."
washingtonwizards,384kfs,TweetsInCommentsBot,5,Mon Jun 1 22:49:24 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, I don't see how this helps. The bench is trash. Why spend capital on a guy who in the best-case scenario is a one-year rental instead of shoring up the depth with something other than guys off the scrap heap?"
washingtonwizards,384kfs,cheapart,3,Tue Jun 2 01:56:20 2015 UTC,"It would help for the following reasons:  Gallo can create for himself and shoot. Played both forward spots. Arguably the best offensive player Wall has ever played with (unless I'm forgetting someone).   Washington will have the mid-level exception + bi-annual exception to use on bench guys. Let's say: sign Mirza Teletovic w/ bi-annual and Gerald Green w/ MLE  Wall, Sessions, Temple Beal, Green, Webster Gallo, Porter, Filler Teletovic, Humphries, Gooden (?) Gortat, Nene, Filler  That's a rough depth-chart w/o knowing the rest of the players Washington will get in draft/free agency. Way more versatile than last year's."

washingtonwizards,384kfs,Mehberry,2,Tue Jun 2 01:56:24 2015 UTC,"I agree, it doesn't seem that bad initially (Gallo will likely be better than the 19th pick in the draft), but we are in no way capable of making the smart decision at the end. Not getting Durant is a survivable scenario because we would still have cap space. Not getting Durant and paying Gallinari is an awful scenario."
washingtonwizards,384kfs,romorr,0,Tue Jun 2 17:17:00 2015 UTC,i don't consider gortat overpaid but that last year on his contract might not be a great deal.
washingtonwizards,384kfs,m25l,6,Tue Jun 2 00:59:51 2015 UTC,Nuggets would laugh at us. They were looking at building around Gallo at one point.
washingtonwizards,384kfs,checkag,6,Tue Jun 2 01:04:26 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, they still are.  I heard most players are available except Danio and one other name which I forget at the moment."

washingtonwizards,384kfs,LexisNexiss,3,Wed Jun 3 01:11:41 2015 UTC,"I think I would rather draft a cheap player that we can groom over the next 2 - 3 years. I know player development hasn't been the best over the last few years, but we have to start somewhere."
washingtonwizards,384kfs,MountCRushmore,3,Mon Jun 1 22:52:13 2015 UTC,"I hate this idea. If we want to be a great team, we HAVE to be able to draft and develop. We let the market dictate too much of what we do year to year, we need a plan and stick to it!"

washingtonwizards,384pxf,mjziegler33,7,Mon Jun 1 21:01:50 2015 UTC,Probably not that much to be quite honest. He doesn't play consistently good defense so you can't use that. I don't think your team really needs mentorship either like ours did. He can definitely knock down shots thoguh and is really good in smallball.
washingtonwizards,384pxf,devotedhero,2,Mon Jun 1 21:23:11 2015 UTC,"The Clippers have guys that can knock down big three pointers.  I think Pierce would have a bigger factor as a bench player, but will he be fine coming off the bench?"
washingtonwizards,384pxf,TophMasterFlex,6,Tue Jun 2 15:37:38 2015 UTC,"Given that the clippers legit played Hedo turkaglu and big baby in the playoffs I think he would be a big help just as a bench player. You could see Griffey getting gassed in the 2nd round, I bet he would love a couple more minutes off a game"
washingtonwizards,384pxf,Brim4889,4,Mon Jun 1 22:54:24 2015 UTC,"A lot, which is why I'm scared."
washingtonwizards,384pxf,_masterofdisaster,2,Mon Jun 1 22:26:51 2015 UTC,"He'd be better than Barnes. If he came off the bench it'd help their bench offense some. If he started, he'd be probably a mild improvement over Barnes.  So worth looking at given their cap situation."
washingtonwizards,384pxf,Mehberry,2,Tue Jun 2 01:06:28 2015 UTC,clippers bench is incredibly fucked. Jamal Crawford is officially Cold - he's lost that touch. Pierce would be a valuable sixth man to them.
washingtonwizards,384pxf,logitaunt,2,Tue Jun 2 03:45:46 2015 UTC,"Regular season, not much considering his age and declining athleticism. But playoffs, he can be the difference maker in clutch situations and Game 7's."

I was there, at the MCI Center, for some basketball clinic. I remember impressing Eddie Jordan (the coach at the time) and thought I was going to become an NBA player. Chris Whitney was the only player that the kids got to meet; he was sitting at a small desk in some hallway and looked pretty disgruntled having to autograph so many pictures lol."

washingtonwizards,37vlyx,WizOfAwesSite,19,Sat May 30 19:42:47 2015 UTC,"Trick question. If he plays at his current level until he's due for a payday, then no he isn't.  But taking into account he's only 21 and shooting guards take a few years to develop, it's very reasonable to project that he will be worth every cent when he gets to that contract. Everything is right on track with his development."
washingtonwizards,37vlyx,isestrex,2,Sat May 30 22:38:46 2015 UTC,This^
washingtonwizards,37vlyx,LexisNexiss,40,Sat May 30 22:47:30 2015 UTC,"Yes. Yes he is. 21 years old, improving defense, scoring, and playnaking every year. I'll rip off my dick, throw it on the ground, and stomp on it if we don't max him."

washingtonwizards,37vlyx,toaster_69,3,Sat May 30 20:40:54 2015 UTC,If we don't max him I think I'll just quit being a wiz fan right then and there. Dude deserves bank. I don't want to not max him have him walk then rail us in the playoffs when he becomes an mvp ala Harden.
washingtonwizards,37vlyx,BagelsAndJewce,3,Sun May 31 02:38:54 2015 UTC,"You guys realize he still has to stay healthy right? I agree that skillswise he is there, but I am still skeptical of giving him the max until he proves he can stay on the court."
washingtonwizards,37vlyx,ireddit270,2,Sun May 31 21:48:07 2015 UTC,What about Durant then? Do we want to pursue Durant considering he has a recurring foot injury?  Sometimes you just have to take a risk. A risk is worth taking if that means elevating this team to the ECF.
washingtonwizards,37vlyx,Shaidester,13,Mon Jun 1 18:42:56 2015 UTC,"If he doesn't, fire EG"
washingtonwizards,37vlyx,Gr8WallofChinatown,6,Sat May 30 20:22:15 2015 UTC,I think so. He's right on the brink of becoming a star and not to mention he was amazing in the playoffs when he was finally healthy.
washingtonwizards,37vlyx,Boymankid,3,Sun May 31 00:19:13 2015 UTC,"If he stays health, he will be what I'd refer to as ""mid-quality"" max contract players.  His first max contract will be worth it and will give somewhat more production then his contract is worth.  Its his second max contract extension that he will be in Joe Johnson territory - a quality player on the edge of all-star, but overpaid."
washingtonwizards,37vlyx,Drak_is_Right,2,Tue Jun 2 02:46:40 2015 UTC,Beal won't get a max unless he scores 19+ PPG this year.
washingtonwizards,37vlyx,_masterofdisaster,3,Sat May 30 20:45:59 2015 UTC,"If we don't offer it he'll get a max offer sheet from someone else and we will match it or let him go, which is 100% not happening. So yeah, he's going to get the max"
washingtonwizards,37vlyx,Boymankid,2,Sun May 31 00:20:03 2015 UTC,Right now no- but he might be soon. Better than anything we got currently and a decent proven scoring guard will want similar $. Ideally I'd like sign him 5Y $60M or so but he would want more
washingtonwizards,37vlyx,LexisNexiss,1 point,Sat May 30 22:49:25 2015 UTC,I really like $60/5 years.  Seems just right.
washingtonwizards,37vlyx,pakilicious,2,Wed Jun 3 16:12:19 2015 UTC,Yes. Yes he is  I'm sorry but the promise of having this backcourt for the next several seasons locked-in   i don't think this team has had anything this exciting since before I was alive
washingtonwizards,37vlyx,logitaunt,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:36:14 2015 UTC,"He's worth the financial risk of a max deal, certainly. He'll get it from the Wiz or someone else."
washingtonwizards,37vlyx,Obersts001,1 point,Sun May 31 02:04:53 2015 UTC,Every year this man continues to get better and dominant offensively. His defense is underrated tbh... Korver got shutdown in the series because of Beal.  He's worth it. I just wish he wasn't so expensive on NBA2k15 for his player card.
washingtonwizards,37vlyx,Shaidester,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:41:09 2015 UTC,I disagree.  I don't think he improved this year at all.  He had nice scoring numbers in the playoffs but he was also very inefficient while having the ball in his hands quite a lot.
washingtonwizards,37vlyx,pakilicious,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:42:04 2015 UTC,This hurts to even think about.

washingtonwizards,37nvtb,fartag1994,13,Fri May 29 01:34:04 2015 UTC,I would like Sessions to practice layups all summer please
washingtonwizards,37nvtb,blast0ise,4,Fri May 29 04:19:24 2015 UTC,Haha he was like Cory Bad Porn Maggette last season. He can slither his way to the hoop like Wall but racked up enough bricks to build a Wall.  But I like how Sessions maintains the uptempo pace Wall sets.
washingtonwizards,37nvtb,Kirbybajerby,1 point,Fri May 29 15:03:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed, love the pace he sets and that he can play with Wall at the same time...Really breaks my heart to see a player always work so hard to get an easy look by the rim and completely missing. Good lord he was good for at least 2 missed layups a game..."

washingtonwizards,37nvtb,madlate,4,Fri May 29 02:08:13 2015 UTC,"If the price is right, why not? The past 47373 (approx) Wizards backup PGs have all fallen off in year 2 so I'm not married to Sessions.  I wonder if Sesh's stock has risen at all after being awful on the Kings and pretty good here. If he could serve as a sweetener to get another team to swallow the last year of Webster's deal, that'd be nice."
washingtonwizards,37nvtb,smilezandsouthstar,1 point,Fri May 29 17:15:10 2015 UTC,"I don't want Lin. He's too inconsistent and if there's one thing our bench cant afford, it's another fucking inconsistent player.  My number one gripe with Sessions is that the dude needs to hit some fucking layups. Other than that, he is great at getting to the rim, is a foul drawing machine, and can defend at a reasonably level. Arguably best part is though is that he can run a fast paced offense like Wall does.  However if he ends up sucking next year then that'll be really unfortunate for us."
washingtonwizards,37nvtb,devotedhero,3,Fri May 29 19:30:17 2015 UTC,I think Sessions and Lin's performance level would be close enough not to warrant paying up for Lin. We've got Sessions cheap and we can spend that money elsewhere.
washingtonwizards,37nvtb,a_child_to_criticize,4,Fri May 29 04:39:12 2015 UTC,"As much as I'm not a fan of Sessions, Lin is at best 10% better of a player with what'd likely be a contract much more than 10% pricier.  Nah."

washingtonwizards,37nvtb,ignoramis,1 point,Fri May 29 03:57:21 2015 UTC,Lin doesn't have a choice in the matter. The NBA is flush with talented point guards. Who is going to start him?  ESPN ranked him the 28th best starting PG. The ones below him are young guys with decent ceilings. Then there's the ones coming out of the draft this year. Then there's the current good backups who could get a shot to start at point somewhere else.
washingtonwizards,37nvtb,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,1 point,Fri May 29 12:48:32 2015 UTC,He will find a team to take him as a starter off name value
washingtonwizards,37nvtb,ignoramis,3,Fri May 29 14:05:47 2015 UTC,"Who? What team will hand him the keys that isn't going to draft or sign a point guard? He wasn't even the starter in L.A. by the end of the season, a 2nd round draft pick had taken the job away from him. His ""name value"" is what will get him a job in a rotation, not a starting spot."

I don't want KD to hoard all the SF minutes to leave Otto with little minutes to develop.              Instead, I'd rather us get a PF(cough, LMA cough).                  But that's just my personal opinion though"
washingtonwizards,37l9vn,peterkimmm,2,Thu May 28 22:08:39 2015 UTC,KD can play PF for extended minutes perfectly fine.
washingtonwizards,37l9vn,devotedhero,2,Fri May 29 19:31:41 2015 UTC,Yes we can go over the cap to sign beal so we just need to sign durant first.
washingtonwizards,37l9vn,argath2014,1 point,Fri May 29 01:29:10 2015 UTC,Yes theoretically. Durant would sign here as a FA so we wouldn't trade anything for him

washingtonwizards,37jyw1,Seek_Adventure,6,Thu May 28 04:23:30 2015 UTC,"Well, personally, I believe its because we were the last team to be good in the DMV area from 2009 - onward. The Wiz and Caps had a good hold on DC Sports from like 2005-2009 b/c the Nats werent exactly world beaters yet, and the Redskins are always king of DC.   What I mean from 2009 onward is when we traded away our big 3 core of Gil, Caron, and Twan. During that ""rebuilding"" phase, the Nationals became a powerhouse in MLB, Alex Ovechkin and the Caps kept on winning and being relevant and even the Redskins made the playoffs in 2012, which captivated the city. The Wiz were a laughing stock among the league with antics from players such as Javale McGee, Blatche, Nick Young, etc. While the other 3 teams rose in popularity, it dropped the Wiz to the bottom in terms of the big 4 teams.   Personally, I think the Wiz are a victim of circumstance, kind of forgotten throughout the stretch of the DC teams rising, and now, DC people are noticing the Wiz."

To an extent but I think that's a cop out overall. There are still a lot of people here who're from here. It boils down to the team not being great. There was a great atmosphere when Jordan was here and in Arenas's heyday but both of those eras turned to shit and now people don't trust the team."
washingtonwizards,37jyw1,smilezandsouthstar,6,Thu May 28 05:51:21 2015 UTC,"To an extent but I think that's a cop out overall.   The whole DC is a transitional city is absolutely a terrible argument and frankly it shows a naivety about DC and large cities in general. Every large cities, and especially those on the coast, is transitional.  I would agree that the city itself is ""transitional"" but the suburbs and further out is where you'll find most of the people who have deep roots in the area. And this is no different from, for example, New York City. No one who lives in Manhattan is actually from Manhattan. Go to the Bronx or Brooklyn and you'll find a few people who are actually from there. Get to Long Island and you'll find the real ""non-transitional"" people.  Personally, I agree with you. Back in the 70s this city was all about Bullets Fever as the team actually made it to four finals and they gave the Redskins a run for the title of the favorite team in the city. But once the Skins started winning Super Bowls in the 80s and early 90s, and the Bullets completely started to suck, they didn't stand a chance."
washingtonwizards,37jyw1,superjuan,3,Thu May 28 11:45:22 2015 UTC,"It's just going to take time. I remember a time where the Nationals couldn't fill the ball park to save their lives, now look at them. When a team is doing bad people don't want to watch or go to games. Look at the Bucks for instance, remember that period of a year or so where ESPN was actively doing stories on how rabbid the fan base was? Now they hardly have anyone going to games.

Honestly, I truly do think that suburbanite white people in this area just don't like the NBA. This is coming from someone who grew up in a upper-middle class DMV suburb that currently lives in DC. They love college basketball, they love the NFL, Skins, and playing Fantasy Football, and they'll even drive/hop on the metro to go to Caps and Nats games, but not the Wizards. And I don't think success has much to do with it. While the Wizards the past two seasons have quietly made good runs in the playoffs, people in my area were oblivious to it. ""Oh yeah, the Wizards, they're having a nice season, right?"" and then I'll answer in depth and they'll respond with something like, ""Caps continue to choke, how about that?"" and change the conversation. The other side of the equation is the vast swath of 20-something yuppie types who live in DC, some from the area, others transplants. I work in an office with a bunch of them. They all look at me like an alien when I mention I'm a diehard Wizards fan. But they love their Caps/Nats, even the transplants not from the area. They pickup the Caps/Nats and love going to their games and doing team events there. One girl on my teams as recently as three months ago didn't even know DC had a pro basketball team.  I know this a bit edgy and might not be popular opinion, and granted I have no hard data to back this up, just my own insights, but I think its partially true."
washingtonwizards,37jyw1,migosversace121,2,Thu May 28 17:54:44 2015 UTC,"Yep. This.   I also am from a suburb of DC (in Nova) and work in DC for a pretty large consulting firm that employs a large number of recent college grads both from this area and from elsewhere, primarily that white ""yuppie"" 20-something you described above. Out of the 25-30 or so people I've had a working relationship with over the years on various projects, only one other guy was a big Wizards fan. They all loved going to Nats/Caps games to drink and be social, as well as watch, but wanted nothing to do with the Wizards.  Maybe that's a large part of it. Nats and Caps games are more conducive to that whole happy hour culture that's so prevalent here in DC. Wizards games don't seem to have that. They're primarily attended by people who want to watch and focus on a basketball game."

washingtonwizards,37jeqm,close_,1 point,Thu May 28 21:23:18 2015 UTC,"So essentially you want our offense to remain the same quagmire it is now and improve our defense (which is already good).... for the low, low price of turning Beal's legs into dust and having all of our starters gassed for the playoffs by averaging ~50000000 minutes a game. We need someone who can get more out of our offense, and if Wittman keeps spreading the floor like he did in the playoffs then I might rescind my wishes to launch him into the heart of the sun. After all everyone (rightfully) shit all over Doc Rivers for some poor coaching decisions until suddenly he figured out what to do/began coaching teams full of hall of famers"

What is wrong with you people are you kidding me? he got fucking lucky pierce saved him self for the playoffs that's it. look at the Warriors and what they did with mark Jackson and where they are now we need a new coach or these poor players are never going to grow. Randy had some of the worst coaching performances I have ever seen in the regular season, don't forget all that just cause we got some national pub by barely performing to expectations in the playoffs. This will go down as  the weakest Eastern conference anyone can ever  remember and we couldn't even get home court in the first round. NOT ACCEPTABLE."
washingtonwizards,37jeqm,Gr8WallofChinatown,2,Thu May 28 03:49:26 2015 UTC,"That's kinda my line of thinking. Randy was ok... this is one of the best coaches in the league. He had the Bulls as the top of the east last year with Noah as their best player. Look at Jimmy Butler development.  Heinrich sucked under Randy and plays well under Thibs . Pao resurrecting what looked like a slowing career. I'll admit Randy had some good plays this post season. Mark Jackson did well, just like mentioned above, but why not go for better. Also DEFENSE wins championships. If we could've stopped Milsap and Horford we would've been in conference finals."

He did nothing but exponentially increase my love for the game and joy in watching the Wiz boys explode in growth from his leadership and experience. I can see now why the Celtics were so sad to see him go.  Having said that:   I don't mind if he leaves, because it could give more playing time to our growing, younger players (aka, Otto). Also, this will snip off any dependence we have on him for our success. I'm all for depending on a player, but let's be real - the Truth is no young buck. He has only so much left in him and I'd rather the Wiz learn to be independent sooner than later.  I don't mind if he stays. I mean, hell yeah. I'm more than positive that our young guys still have a lot more to learn from Father Truth and another year may prove beneficial if he imparts b-ball wisdom to our roster. Also, he makes the game so much fun if he's on your team. And, he can be our clutch-shooter for one more year giving us time to find another go-to player in the anticipated 2016 FA."

washingtonwizards,37dpyn,ireddit270,2,Wed May 27 02:49:48 2015 UTC,Zach Lowe has said that the Wiz have an analytics team.

washingtonwizards,37dj8u,Nickdoggmoneycash,5,Tue May 26 21:02:12 2015 UTC,If we can afford him. He'd pair perfectly with Wall
washingtonwizards,37dj8u,Gr8WallofChinatown,6,Tue May 26 21:31:22 2015 UTC,"He would be great, a 2/3 and Witt can have some really interesting groups out there. So he'd be great. The cap situation really does matter though, we have to keep in mind that we need a backup 2, a backup 3, and 4(if Gooden leaves/maybe even if he stays). So, it all comes down to who Ernie wants to spend money on, a 2, 3, or 4. Green works out because he can play the 2 and 3(meaning we would only need to bring back a guy like Bynum for guard depth and use our pick on a big), and could really get the crowd going."
washingtonwizards,37dj8u,Cpr196,3,Tue May 26 21:29:50 2015 UTC,I can already see John Wall throwing skip passes for open Gerald Green corner threes.

washingtonwizards,37dj8u,kamikazemelonman,0,Wed May 27 09:59:14 2015 UTC,"Beat case scenario I see him as a younger, more athletic Pierce. Questionable shot selection with inconsistent offensive production, and no defense. He's on the list of free agents to pursue but he's not near the top."
washingtonwizards,37dj8u,Mehberry,0,Wed May 27 16:58:05 2015 UTC,No thanks
washingtonwizards,37bfzo,RunsWithFlyingSloths,6,Tue May 26 11:49:33 2015 UTC,"I would absolutely love to get Frank the Tank, if we can move up to get him I'm all for it. The only question is what we'd need to do/how far we'd need to move up."
washingtonwizards,37bfzo,Zorodude77,6,Tue May 26 11:54:37 2015 UTC,"With what, exactly? Adding our second rounder? Martell and Nene aren't very tradable."
washingtonwizards,37bfzo,Mehberry,3,Tue May 26 13:12:15 2015 UTC,"Plus this is a pretty deep draft at the stretch pf/c position. We'll be able to get one of Looney, Bobby Portis, or Trey Lyles to fill that role at 19. And there is still a month left, which is plenty of time for a guy like Kaminsky or Myles Turner to drop for whatever odd reason, or for a guy like Christian Wood to rise.  No real reason to move anywhere if we're targeting that position."
washingtonwizards,37bfzo,NotBobWoodward,4,Tue May 26 18:43:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not even super sold on Frank to begin with as an NBA prospect, so whatever we would have to move to get him would likely not please me.   I'm not sure if it's depth, but yeah, post-lottery it's splitting hairs talent wise. I'd rather risk a bust than have another Randy Foye trade."
washingtonwizards,37bfzo,Mehberry,6,Tue May 26 19:10:28 2015 UTC,No reason to get fancy for a potential bust.  Just take Looney if he falls to us or take best available.  We need depth at multiple positions.
washingtonwizards,37bfzo,ircdub,4,Tue May 26 15:44:16 2015 UTC,"Likely not. Kaminsky has moved up draft boards in recent weeks - was originally in the 15-20 range (behind his less heralded teammate Sam Decker) but now I've seen him as high as #8. Here are some of the mock drafts for him:   USA Today: #13 CBS Sports (3 analysts): #13, #8, and #13 Yahoo! Sports: #12 HoopsHype: #17 DraftExpress: #12"
washingtonwizards,37bfzo,Obersts001,5,Tue May 26 13:54:51 2015 UTC,"Nope. I think he can be a great scorer but would be a liability on defense. Besides, I doubt the Wiz have any tradeable assets they are willing to part with to move up."
washingtonwizards,37bfzo,EvilGeniusMusik,7,Tue May 26 13:25:55 2015 UTC,Huge defensive liability. I don't think he has the make up for an NBA player. Cool if he proves me wrong but I don't see it
washingtonwizards,37bfzo,Capn_max,1 point,Tue May 26 14:31:45 2015 UTC,I think he has a nice skillset for a stretch four. He played pretty solid defense against Towns. With the exception of Blake Griffin and Lamarcus Aldridge there aren't a lot of skilled post PFs that Kaminsky couldn't match up with.
washingtonwizards,37bfzo,rockyroad99,5,Tue May 26 14:54:27 2015 UTC,"1st off, I don't think it's worth us trading up for him. While he certainly was nice in college I'm not so sure he'll be able to contribute right away while he catches up to playing against other people his size, and Wittman has shown that if you're a rookie who struggles you will be banished to the end of the bench (Hi Otto!)  2nd, we have no trade assets thanks to eternal wisdom of the might Ernie Grunfeld. The only players who other teams would want with their contract situations are Wall, Beal, and/or Porter, and that should not happen. Best case scenario is some team would trade their 1st round for out 1st rounder, next year's 1st rounder, NeNe's expiring contract, and probably some 2nd rounders of the rights to swap 1st round picks. Even then I don't see any team wanting to make that deal unless they could float a 2-3 years bad contract back to us"
washingtonwizards,37bfzo,Brim4889,3,Tue May 26 16:53:37 2015 UTC,"If he can really stretch the floor he would fit nicely around Gortat. Imagine, Gortat PnR's and Frank PnP's with Wall. Lot of high IQ players on the court in that situation. With otto at the 3, the Wiz will have spacing, size, and rebounding and still be able to play semi-fast"
washingtonwizards,37bfzo,amacdvt,2,Tue May 26 15:58:10 2015 UTC,"I just don't see him becoming much better than, say, Channing Frye."
washingtonwizards,37bfzo,smilezandsouthstar,1 point,Tue May 26 19:04:05 2015 UTC,Trading up for Kaminsky is stupid. He's going to fall within our range anyways

washingtonwizards,37bfzo,7032CharmCity,-1,Thu May 28 16:25:23 2015 UTC,Hes a bust. I bet he is out of the league by 2020

If Kaminsky can't develop on the defensive end his ceiling will be Carlos Boozer but it's not an absurd claim to say that Kaminsky might be in the D-League or playing abroad in the 2020 season."

washingtonwizards,378a3d,Theblackerthesame,16,Mon May 25 18:16:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this sucks if it happens.  Wizards payroll for 2015-6: $71,455,267   PG: Wall ($14,728,844) / Sessions ($2,170,465) SG: Beal ($5,694,673) / Temple ($1,100,602) SF: Pierce ($5,543,725) / Porter ($4,662,960) / Webster ($5,713,500) PF: Nene ($13,000,000) / Humphries ($4,440,000) C: Gortat ($11,217,391) / Blair ($2,000,000)   If Pierce walks: $65,911,542  2015-6 projected salary cap: $67.1 million  2015-6 projected luxury tax: $81.6 milion  Bi-annual exception: First-year salary of $2.139 million up to 2 years  Non-taxpayer mid-level exception: First-year salary of $5.464 million, up to 4 years  Trevor Ariza trade exception: $1.923 million (expires July 13) (This exception was created by sign and trading Ariza to the Rockets instead of letting him walk outright. It was an $8.5 million exception -- Ariza's first-year salary with Houston -- but part of it was used to acquire Kris Humphries and part of it was used in the Andre Miller-Ramon Sessions trade.)  It looks at first like the Wizards have a mil available under the cap if Pierce walks but under the NBA's salary cap rules the exceptions count towards the cap. And that mil is basically the veteran's minimum. And the Wizards' first round pick will eat take it up once he's signed. So Pierce walking does nothing for the Wizards cap-wise. They just lose a player without gaining anything. The Clippers' own salary cap situation is pretty fucked so a sign and trade to create another trade exception or something probably isn't happening.  The Wizards already had very limited means to replace or re-sign their current free agents: Drew Gooden, Rasual Butler, Kevin Seraphin, and Will Bynum. If Pierce is added to that list, things get even harder. The first round pick will take one spot and the Wizards like to keep one spot open during the season just in case, but that's still three bodies you need to squeeze in."
washingtonwizards,378a3d,smilezandsouthstar,9,Mon May 25 20:33:59 2015 UTC,Man there are some lousy contracts on that list.
washingtonwizards,378a3d,GameDaySam,7,Mon May 25 21:19:37 2015 UTC,The Nene one is the biggest eye sore but we lose that right after next season. The Martell Webster one though.... man we're fucked with that one.

I also think he has a much better shot at winning the title with the Clippers.  As much as we love the Wiz on here, we know that the ceiling is the ECF at best if Wittman is coach."
washingtonwizards,378a3d,Massi123,2,Tue May 26 20:51:04 2015 UTC,"Otto's time to shine is overdue. Almost every team that has done something of relevance in the NBA recently has drafted wisely and built around that young talent (OKC, Cle, GS). I really think he had a bigger injury than anyone was willing to admit or leak when he first started in the league but has recovered nicely and can be a key item. Think Tayshaun Prince or Trevor Ariza - the kind of support talent integral to a team's success."
washingtonwizards,378a3d,aznanimedude,6,Mon May 25 19:44:46 2015 UTC,Cleveland does not deserve to be on that list. They got lucky 3 times to lure lebron back. They drafted Anthony Bennett and Dion waiters for God's sake

washingtonwizards,378j1q,Shaidester,1 point,Mon May 25 23:28:36 2015 UTC,It's not possible to replace his talent and that resume with what is out there in the NBA right now. It's gonna hurt a lot because I know Wall will be the guy who's going to iso and try to clutch a game if it comes down to it... and Wall isn't that kind of player YET. Far from it.
washingtonwizards,378j1q,Obersts001,6,Fri May 29 14:30:58 2015 UTC,"Cassell lured Pierce to DC before he took a higher-level assistant job in LA, and of course Pierce is from SoCal. So if that's what he wants I'm not going to hate him for it. But this is where Ted and Ernie need to get creative and offer Pierce more flexibility - no requirements to play back-to-backs, maybe take some road trips off. Both teams give about the same chance of winning a title with the Clips clearly better (assuming DeAndre Jordan returns) but the Wizards' path in the East is easier. Maybe let him serve as team ambassador in recruiting preferred FA's?"

Potential to a solid stretch 4 if he cleans up his shot. Really long but adding strength will be his biggest requirement before he can contribute at the NBA level.

It's unlikely we move Webster since he is a potato being paid 5 mil for the next two seasons so I don't want Butler re-signed. We need a younger 2-3 more than ever since Pierce may retire or go back to Boston. But Ernie will still probably sign him

Bron hasn't really been our rival in recent years. The only time I can think of Bron and the wiz having personal beef was when Bron was coasting a few years back and announced that he would go off on us.

washingtonwizards,36zurg,WizOfAwesSite,-1,Sat May 23 15:30:24 2015 UTC,"Besides John Wall, the only NBA All-Star Grunfeld ever drafted was Michael Redd in 2000 with the 43rd overall pick.  ...Still, even with his ridiculous draft blunders throughout the years,...   This is very misleading. Granted the draft is easily Ernie's weakest skill as a GM but he hasn't been dreadful.  2004: Harris (hit), Ramos (miss)  2005: Blatche (hit)  2006: Pecherov(miss), Veremeenko (miss)  2007: Young (hit), McGuire (miss)  2008: McGee (hit), Walker (miss)  2009: Taylor (miss)  2010: Wall (hit), Hayward (miss), Bjelica (miss)  2011: Vesely (miss), Singleton (miss), Mack (miss)  2012: Beal (hit), Satoransky (?)  2013: Porter (hit), Wolters (miss), Kazemi (miss)  2014: Clarkson (?)  *2nd round picks in Italics  So if you're keeping score, he's hit on 6 of 8 first round picks. His only misses have been Pecherov and Vesely. 3 of his 6 hits are currently on the team and make up the budding nucleus (Wall, Beal and Porter). The other 3 of his 6 hits have been traded - Ernie's real strength as a GM - for valuable assets. Harris was part of the package for Jamison. Young and McGee were part of the package to get Nene.  Obviously he could have done a lot better and missing with a 5th round pick like Vesely was extremely grievous, but it's a misnomer that Ernie is a horrible drafter."
washingtonwizards,36zurg,isestrex,13,Sat May 23 17:14:02 2015 UTC,"This is misleading, too. Ernie's record with his draft picks is trash. John Wall and Andray Blatche are the only Wizards draft picks under Ernie Grunfeld who have made it to a second contract with the Wizards. That's a disaster.  Brad Beal and Otto Porter are the only other Ernie picks that look like they're going to stick around. I don't think GMs deserve credit for getting top-3 picks right.  Harris (traded with Stackhouse's and Laettner's deadweight for the Gentleman), Jermaine Taylor/Bill Walker/Jordan Clarkson (cash considerations), Lazar Hayward (Trevor Booker), and Nate Wolters and Arsalan Kazemi (traded for Glen Rice Jr), were never going to be Wizards and are recorded as Wizards' draft picks only because of the NBA's bookkeeping rules regarding draft-day trades.  You've also left out trading the #5 pick in 2009 for Randy Foye and Mike Miller and taking on Kirk Hinrich's contract in exchange for the pick that became Kevin Seraphin.  Blatche/Young/McGee are all duds. They helped build a toxic culture never played well in meaningful games. McGee was the only one who returned anything of value (Young was a throwaway to the Clippers who gave up nothing meaningful to get him).  Booker and KSLife are duds, too. Booker was allowed to walk in restricted free agency in favor of signing veterans who did nothing for the Wizards in the playoffs. Seraphin's going to walk, too.   I'm not gonna knock Ernie for not nailing his second round picks, but selling them for cash is garbage, and the Blatche extension was a terrible mistake.  Jamison and Nene have been good players. But in both instances rookie-scale contracts were traded for highly-paid players whose current teams were feeling a little bit of buyer's remorse. Those trades involved forfeiting a lot of cap space, not just the picks/players involved."
washingtonwizards,36zurg,smilezandsouthstar,0,Sat May 23 18:39:08 2015 UTC,"John Wall and Andray Blatche are the only Wizards draft picks under Ernie Grunfeld who have made it to a second contract with the Wizards.   That means nothing in the grand scheme of things. Young, McGee and Harris were talented enough players to reach a second contract with another NBA team. The fact that they were traded for assets and weren't able to sign up with the Wizards is immaterial. It also looks like Beal and Porter are headed for 2nd contracts if that's your game. So my general assertion still stands. Claiming Blatche, McGee and Young were failures is a tad caviling. While it's true they never became ""All Stars"" as Mehic's criteria goes, they were drafted 49th, 18th and 16th overall. Most players in that range rarely amount to much and that trio (with all their faults) were far from a ""miss"".   You've also left out trading the #5 pick in 2009 for Randy Foye and Mike Miller and taking on Kirk Hinrich's contract in exchange for the pick that became Kevin Seraphin.   We're not really harping on this again, are we? This was Abe, not Ernie. Let's take a trip back down memory lane. Though no one has come right out and said it, multiple ""rumblings"" have hinted that owner Abe Pollin commanded Ernie to go all in for 2009 because he knew his health was failing. He had previously ordered Ernie to extend Arenas while recovering from knee surgery. Now in the summer of 2009, Gilbert was supposedly starting the season healthy and in Abe's mind the trio of Jamison Butler and Arenas just needed a few key pieces push them into the contention. Therefore the 1st round pick was dealt for 2 players that strongly complimented the Wizards' ideal roster. But Arenas was inconsistent and the team lost 9 of their first 12 games to start the season. On Nov 24th 2009, Abe passed away. A month later, Gilbert re-injured his knee and was shut down for the season. Abe's death and final pushes for a championship left the Wizards' future in serious jeopardy with an unhealthy Arenas locked up and no draft pick but Ernie was simply following orders.  If you take a look at Ernie's trade history, you'll see most of them are slam dunk wins with one glaring exception... the Foye/Miller trade. It makes no sense to assume that someone with such a brilliant trade record acumen would do something so stupid on his own."
washingtonwizards,36zurg,isestrex,2,Sat May 23 19:24:26 2015 UTC,"That means nothing in the grand scheme of things. Young, McGee and Harris were talented enough players to reach a second contract with another NBA team. The fact that they were traded for assets and weren't able to sign up with the Wizards is immaterial.   It doesn't mean nothing. Continuity is valuable. Reaping the rewards of your player development and education is valuable. Having multiple guys who've grown together and know each other's idiosyncracies and know how to complement each other is valuable.    Claiming Blatche, McGee and Young were failures is a tad caviling.   They never helped the Wizards win games. They were locker room cancers. Blatche was amnestied. Nick Young was traded for Brian Cook and a second-round pick. Total failures. McGee got the Wizards Nene and I love Nene but he was still a $67 million player past his prime and he could've been had in free agency a few months earlier. The Nuggets gave Philly a first-round pick to make McGee go away. The Sixers agreed to give McGee all of his remaining owed money, no buyout, to go away. Failure.   We're not really harping on this again, are we? This was Abe, not Ernie.   I wasn't harping on it. I mentioned it because I wanted to give a full accounting of Ernie's activities wrt draft picks. That's why I mentioned Kevin Seraphin in the same sentence.  But since you do want to revisit it: yes, everyone knows the Wiz went all-in because Pollin knew he wasn't gonna be around for much longer. It was still a stupid trade. A healthy Arenas, Butler, and Jamison constituted an elite offense unto themselves. Meanwhile the Wizards were a bad defensive team. So you trade the 5th pick for guard depth? Come. On. Ernie Grunfeld won a power struggle with Pat Riley but he couldn't tell Abe Pollin ""We can go all-in and we can avoid the luxury tax but not both?""   If you take a look at Ernie's trade history, you'll see most of them are slam dunk wins with one glaring exception... the Foye/Miller trade. It makes no sense to assume that someone with such a brilliant trade record acumen   Brilliant trades:   February 20, 2003: Traded Ray Allen, Ronald Murray, Kevin Ollie and a 2003 1st round draft pick (Luke Ridnour was later selected) to the Seattle SuperSonics for Desmond Mason and Gary Payton.   Ray Allen in his prime AND a first round pick for 30 games of 34-year old Gary Payton.   June 27, 2003: Traded Sam Cassell and Ervin Johnson to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Anthony Peeler and Joe Smith.   Sam immediately had a career year for the Timberwolves and if not for injury...  (And let's not forget that these Bucks fell apart because Ernie thought 35 year old Anthony Mason was gonna put them over the top.)   August 17, 2007: Traded Juan Carlos Navarro to the Memphis Grizzlies for a 2010 1st round draft pick (Xavier Henry was later selected). December 10, 2008: As part of a 3-team trade, the Washington Wizards traded Antonio Daniels to the New Orleans Hornets; the Washington Wizards traded a 2010 1st round draft pick (Xavier Henry was later selected) to the Memphis Grizzlies; the Memphis Grizzlies traded a 2015 2nd round draft pick to the New Orleans Hornets; the Memphis Grizzlies traded Javaris Crittenton to the Washington Wizards; and the New Orleans Hornets traded Mike James to the Washington Wizards.   La Bomba turned into Mike James and Javaris Crittenton.   February 13, 2010: Traded Caron Butler, Brendan Haywood and DeShawn Stevenson to the Dallas Mavericks for Drew Gooden, Josh Howard, Quinton Ross and James Singleton. February 17, 2010: As part of a 3-team trade, the Washington Wizards traded Drew Gooden to the Los Angeles Clippers; the Washington Wizards traded Antawn Jamison to the Cleveland Cavaliers; the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Zydrunas Ilgauskas, Emir Preldzic and a 2010 1st round draft pick (Lazar Hayward was later selected) to the Washington Wizards; the Los Angeles Clippers traded Sebastian Telfair to the Cleveland Cavaliers; and the Los Angeles Clippers traded Al Thornton to the Washington Wizards.   The Cavs thought Antawn Jamison was the missing piece. The Mavs valued Haywood so much they gave him $55 million that summer. Caron Butler was still Caron Butler. The Wizards got 70 games of Al Thornton and the pick that eventually became Trevor Booker out of them.  Ernie Grunfeld sucks. He blows draft picks and trades young cheap players for expensive vets because he can't actually land them in free agency. His tenure is a series of band-aids and short-term fixes and getting blessed by the lotto gods a couple of times."

washingtonwizards,36zurg,isestrex,2,Sat May 23 19:15:44 2015 UTC,"Wall did, but Beal and Porter were merely the picks the media expected the Wizards to make. They could definitely have picked elsewhere and, up until a few weeks ago, Wizards fans were hoping he had in the Porter draft. You can still badly mess up a top pick... as we witnessed with Vesely."
washingtonwizards,36zurg,Boymankid,1 point,Sat May 23 19:28:04 2015 UTC,"Beal and Porter were sort of ""must"" picks because they fit obvious needs and were projected to go between 2-5. Any GM with a PG like Wall and a big combo of Nene/Gortat would've done the same thing. I don't give Ernie much credit at all for making the obvious picks"
washingtonwizards,36zurg,BoldElDavo,1 point,Sun May 24 07:28:15 2015 UTC,McGee and Young were here together for three seasons and their best record in any of the three was 26-56. They were bad enough to earn us Wall.  Young went on to play for the worst Lakers team in decades. McGee played for shitty Denver then shittier Philly.  If they can get themselves some minutes on a good team then call them draft hits. Neither has done that yet.

washingtonwizards,36y95n,smilezandsouthstar,12,Sat May 23 03:08:47 2015 UTC,"the wiz had a shot to win that series for sure, injuries notwithstanding. Nene basically had one good game, gortat (who is way more important to this team than everyone realizes IMHO) didnt have a great series, and we squandered opportunities. I felt that way during the atl series and it hasnt changed now. the frustrating thing is that I think we would have given cleveland a MUCH more competitive series (looking like a sweep now), but that may just be my bias speaking."
washingtonwizards,36y95n,pandashuman,4,Sat May 23 03:16:30 2015 UTC,"Right now I'm thinking if the Wizards couldn't handle the Hawks' frontcourt, the Cavs' might've murdered them. There's a lot more work to be done this summer than I initially thought*."
washingtonwizards,36y95n,DeltaT12,4,Sat May 23 03:23:30 2015 UTC,No I think the same flaws that are being exposed by the cavs were evident in the our series too but I think with the injury to Wall and us having some players that are still very young we couldn't dad-dick all over them like bron is. Our roster also just isn't as good as the cavs because we aren't as good a team. Give the Wizkids 1 or 2 more years to develop and we'll be contenders with the right trades. 1 more piece i think man honestly. A rebounding big who can move and a guy who can iso and score. Beal is a younger Klay Thompson but Wall doesn't have the iso ability to close up shotclocks (KD 2016 PLS).
washingtonwizards,36y95n,faint-smile,4,Sat May 23 06:01:29 2015 UTC,"Hmm, reconsider? Why? Are you saying we wouldn't have had a chance against the Cavs? Not really, since I personally don't really buy into Atlanta, at all.  I wasn't that impressed by the Hawks and remain unimpressed. John's injury and Nene's inability to play consistently (and arguably, Gortat as well factoring in his food poisoning in Game 6) doomed us but the series was quite winnable. Game 6 was one of the worst games I saw us play all season ( I was there ).  Moreover, Randy's bizarro roster decisions came back to haunt us as well. I mystified why Seraphim ended up getting minutes and Kris rode the bench. Also mystified why Nene was allowed to plunge us deeper into a hole of our own creation. He's not known for breaking out of slumps (and I've defended Nene on this forum, check my hustle).  To be honest, I feel like the door was wide open and we just couldn't step through it. Those feelings haven't changed.  I agree that our frontcourt defense was terrible but I don't think that would have lost the series against the Cavs if everything else was working."
washingtonwizards,36y95n,AgentLF,2,Sat May 23 15:22:35 2015 UTC,"I still am, the injury to John destroyed any sort of rhythm we had and even when he played G5 and G6, you could tell the offense wasnt as full flowing as it was in the Toronto series or G1.   Although, Tristan Thompson would've had his way on Nene AND Gortat, however, that would've been Humphries time to come in. I wonder who would be guarding LBJ, would it be Pierce, Otto, Beal, Nene?"
washingtonwizards,36y95n,devotedhero,2,Sat May 23 03:26:27 2015 UTC,"I wonder who would be guarding LBJ, would it be Pierce, Otto, Beal, Nene?   Might take Deshawn Stevenson over any of those options. :/"
washingtonwizards,36y95n,Boymankid,2,Sat May 23 03:32:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I thought we could have won. Our frontcourt just did not play well enough this series to really contest Millsap and Horford. If you rewatch some of the games from our series, there is one game (I think game 4?) where Horford wasn't being defended at all and given the same fucking mid range jumper at the elbow which he makes every time.  Honestly, our roster is still not amazing yet. We have a relatively top heavy roster but I think we are moving forward."
washingtonwizards,36y95n,Zomby24,2,Sat May 23 03:39:48 2015 UTC,"I think a Cavs Wizards ECF would've gone to 5 or 6, and it looks like the Cavs are going to sweep the Hawks.

washingtonwizards,370isz,LexisNexiss,0,Sat May 23 23:49:17 2015 UTC,Some of that should be credited to Beal for shutting him down completely those 6 games

washingtonwizards,36vz79,LooseCannon13,3,Fri May 22 15:44:07 2015 UTC,"This article provides some good clarification and some scenarios. I was mis-informed in some of my other arguments because I thought the extension if done this summer would go into effect for next season. So the thought was extending him now, even if a max-extension, would make sense because ultimately it would be a deal locking him in based on this year's salary cap and not 2016's. Found out that's not the case by reading this article.   Still think we should offer the extension now and let Bradley decide what to do. Shows good-faith at the very worst, and at best we have him locked up until 2019."

washingtonwizards,36u1k1,LexisNexiss,3,Fri May 22 03:05:53 2015 UTC,I think we should take a big. Most 'experts' saying we take a stretch 4 and I think that's a good option. The best big man available would be nice considering how old Nene and Gortat are getting.

washingtonwizards,36rktp,SkinsWiz,20,Thu May 21 16:23:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no way Kyrie is better than Wall. You can make an argument as a scorer, Kyrie has the upper hand. But, overall Wall is by far deserving on AT LEAST third team All-NBA. #whatajoke"
washingtonwizards,36rktp,daynjus,12,Thu May 21 16:26:45 2015 UTC,I don't mind kyrie but he gets a lot more love on the national stage than wall. He's a better shooter and a lot flashier but a huge part of his success this year was LeBron. Give wall a legit superstar and I think wall would at least be on the second team
washingtonwizards,36rktp,fagetsaget,8,Thu May 21 17:29:29 2015 UTC,"Irving also played half the season poorly. The Cavs were sub 500 after 40 games, and there was a lot of talk about how Kyrie is a bad fit. Then he stops pretending to be a PG and starts shooting and scoring a lot, so basically playing as a 2 guard and spotting up around Lebron drive-dishes, and boom all of sudden Irving is amazing. I think it's a testament to Lebron making his teammates better more than thinking Irving actually had an all NBA year"
washingtonwizards,36rktp,Boymankid,5,Thu May 21 17:35:58 2015 UTC,"Kyrie is a great player but yeah he owes a lot of his success to LeBron. He plays a lot better as a secondary ball handler than he does as ""the guy"" on the cavaliers (look at the last few seasons). I know this has been said to death but if someone like KD or Boogie came to DC I think we'll see wall shine"
washingtonwizards,36rktp,fagetsaget,5,Thu May 21 17:39:18 2015 UTC,"Wall can be the guy, we just need a PF. We were 5 nondisplaced fractures from making the Ecf"
washingtonwizards,36rktp,Boymankid,3,Thu May 21 17:43:58 2015 UTC,"Yea he can definitely be the guy, but we need an upgrade at the 4. We could use a spark plug too. Sometimes our offense just gets super stagnant"
washingtonwizards,36rktp,fagetsaget,29,Thu May 21 17:46:22 2015 UTC,Averages a double double with assists and is voted the second best defensive pg yet Wall can't even get 3rd team. This shows how easy the media falls for the story lines and voted for Cavs and GSW over the wizards
washingtonwizards,36rktp,VCURedskins,1 point,Thu May 21 16:04:55 2015 UTC,"While its not fair. Wall doesn't average 20+ppg. It's not fair at all, but that stat still provides an certain legitimacy a voter who doesn't watch certain teams can trust."

washingtonwizards,36rks2,fagetsaget,2,Thu May 21 17:33:27 2015 UTC,I like Butler and Thompson so I'm not too salty about them. I am pretty salty about Irving making it though if im being honest. I'm just gonna avoid any r/nba threads about this for the next few days lol.

washingtonwizards,36rks2,AeMz,2,Thu May 21 17:39:36 2015 UTC,Yea I don't go to r/nba if I want to be a homer. Sometimes I wish it hid votes though. I feel like it contributes a lot to circlejerks. I have no doubt that wall will get an all nba selection eventually though. But I do think that we need another player to come to dc in order to truly contend. Wall Beal and porter are great but to take that next step we need one more person. That's just my opinion though
washingtonwizards,36rks2,540Cameron,3,Thu May 21 17:44:45 2015 UTC,I have all these Warrior fans at school trying to really tell me Klay and Kyrie deserved it over Wall. LOL ok. It's tough rooting for DC in the bay lol

washingtonwizards,36rks2,aznanimedude,3,Thu May 21 17:33:42 2015 UTC,What pisses me off even more is the amount of votes he got. Its criminal.

Yeah he's got good handles and a good shot but outside of that what does he do that other mediocre NBA players can't do?

washingtonwizards,36rks2,trizzzlet,5,Tue May 26 19:44:39 2015 UTC,"Chip on the shoulder, here we go. Hope this fuels the fire even more under this team.  John Wall is one of the few true point guards right now in the league. There is sheer beauty in his pick and rolls and fast breaks. That man brings it back old school like Gary Payton and John Stockton."

Right now I see Curry=1st team; and then either CP3 or Westbrook on the 2nd/3rd teams. As for SGs I see them giving Harden first team and then maybe Klay 2nd. Hopefully they put Wall on the 3rd team over the likes of Jimmy B."
washingtonwizards,36nm5r,happyflappypancakes,6,Wed May 20 22:40:23 2015 UTC,They don't have to do SGs and PGs. Just two guards. It will be Curry/Harden. CP3/Westbrook. Wall/Irving(?). Not sure about hte 3rd team.

washingtonwizards,36o4cx,3YCW,6,Wed May 20 20:18:52 2015 UTC,"I think Anderson has the potential to be a really solid 3-and-D guy in the NBA and I hope he succeeds, but I don't expect us to draft anything other than a PF (Lyles, Looney, Hazell, Portis)."
washingtonwizards,36o4cx,Obersts001,1 point,Wed May 20 20:46:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah he wouldn't play great at PF, I just love his hustle and heart. Between his defense and his ability to run/spread the floor, I see him being a great fit for us."
washingtonwizards,36o4cx,leo2k2ndc,1 point,Wed May 20 20:54:50 2015 UTC,"Yea, he looks really good though. I think after PF, we would probably draft a guard who can create"
washingtonwizards,36o4cx,skinsballr,4,Thu May 21 15:27:16 2015 UTC,"I like him - as a Maryland alum, I saw Anderson wreck us on the defensive end - he's an undersized PF/strong SF that has a great motor and hustle ability. The Wizards may go that direction (if Paul Pierce hangs it up this offseason), but they most-likely will go after a stretch-4 in the form of Hazell/Portis/Looney - whichever PF falls to us at #19."
washingtonwizards,36o4cx,smilezandsouthstar,3,Wed May 20 20:54:28 2015 UTC,Wiz fans always want the best Hoo or Terps kid haha.
washingtonwizards,36o4cx,Kirbybajerby,2,Wed May 20 23:34:01 2015 UTC,He reminds me of Trevor Booker
washingtonwizards,36o4cx,skinsballr,0,Wed May 20 20:55:45 2015 UTC,Good comparison!
washingtonwizards,36o4cx,migosversace121,8,Wed May 20 21:06:33 2015 UTC,"What? No. I don't quite see it. Trevor is more of a four. He rarely ever took three's with the Wizards, and only started taking them this year in Utah, for whatever reason. The vast majority of his offensive game is shots within ten feet. And not to mention, I don't find Trevor to be particularly good offensively. He's a high energy, bouncy spark plug who can come up with a big offensive rebound, but he's not a skilled scorer. Really good defender.  I feel well-versed in Justin's game. He had a great year shooting from the outside, but he probably out shot his abilities. That showed at the Combine recently. He didn't shoot well from three. He does have a solid mid-range game and he shot well in those drills. What I can tell you what he absolutely is, is he's probably one of the best pure athletes in this draft. His combine vertical number were off the charts, and his UVA film backs that up. And because of that, he's an NBA ready defender, which is great value.   I think if he can developed an ability to score at the NBA level, a good comparison to him would be a Wilson Chandler type. If he can't develop that offensive game, I still think he can be a Kent Bazemore type, which is still a stable rotation NBA player."
washingtonwizards,36o4cx,ruffus4life,1 point,Wed May 20 21:57:48 2015 UTC,now i just miss booker. the guy shot 35% from 3 last year and that was a rough offensive team in utah.
washingtonwizards,36o4cx,migosversace121,2,Thu May 21 01:25:08 2015 UTC,"That was just so strange. Was it he always wanted to shoot three's and Randy told him not too? Or did Quin Snyder just give him the green light? It was so out of nowhere. The dude literally attempted like nine three's in his four years in Washington.   But yeah, I miss Book. I liked what Seraphin brought this year, and he definitely made nice strides, but Book basically did what Seraphin was doing but better."
washingtonwizards,36o4cx,ruffus4life,1 point,Thu May 21 02:36:27 2015 UTC,yeah and he shot 55 percent last year. i guess they thought hump would replace what book did and he did until he got hurt.
washingtonwizards,36o4cx,Hagdogrobinwood,1 point,Thu May 21 02:45:31 2015 UTC,"I would love to take him because he can guard the 1,2 or 3's.We have no one behind brad or otto, if Paul does not return. I would also take Hollis-Jefferson or jerian grant."
washingtonwizards,36oc82,onestonedspoon,4,Wed May 20 21:12:22 2015 UTC,"The Bullets changed their name before the first Harry Potter book came out lol. The team never released the voting and I doubt that ""Wizards"" won. Abe Pollin wanted alliteration."

I don't think we have any way of knowing where the Wiz are in the team sales ranking, except that John Wall is #13 now in jersey sales, and the team overall is not in the Top 10.    Ultimately, it's Ted's decision on whether he thinks a rebranding at this stage would make more money. They just redid the color scheme in 2011."
washingtonwizards,36oc82,Obersts001,1 point,Thu May 21 13:41:55 2015 UTC,yeahh i just feel like a name change is imminent. i mean with the logo upgrade and the more Red/White/Blue being brought back it only makes sense. the name just seems weird when overall the brand has nothing too with a Wizard anymore the name is kind of pointless. i mean the Magic having a Wizard theme makes more sense than for the Wiz too at this point. regardless i still love the team. but out of all the teams i root for i feel like i would actually like a change from the name Wizards would actually be nice. just my opinion though.
washingtonwizards,36oc82,skinsballr,2,Thu May 21 13:50:38 2015 UTC,"Based on the new logo changes, the most-realistic name change would be to the ""Washington Monuments""; after all, the monument is a focal part of the team's logo everywhere."

washingtonwizards,36mwsl,Boymankid,2,Thu May 21 06:21:11 2015 UTC,"Yup for sure. And giving him a max-extension this summer is actually going to be a deal since next offseason the cap is going way up. The contract would be a market max deal for 1 season, then it would be under a max deal for the rest of the way.   *Edit: At least that's my understanding of the way the cap is going to work"

washingtonwizards,36n2rq,_zards,4,Wed May 20 19:36:58 2015 UTC,There's so many holes on the team that I don't think positional need should factor into the pick. Take the best player available.
washingtonwizards,36n2rq,smilezandsouthstar,2,Wed May 20 17:01:02 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree.  We have a ton of need for depth

washingtonwizards,36iqqo,Coast_watcher,1 point,Wed May 20 13:52:01 2015 UTC,"Analytics played a big part in changing the game. Teams realized that spacing is important. Having more shooters increased the efficiency of the game w/o hurting you defensively. The Warriors are a great example. Once Draymond Green took over for David Lee, they got better on both ends."
washingtonwizards,36iqqo,VCURedskins,2,Wed May 20 18:52:31 2015 UTC,Not only that but players have grown up with the three point line so they are better at it. And skilled big men aren't easy to find since there are so few people in the world that tall
washingtonwizards,36jkxw,Mehberry,5,Tue May 19 21:25:34 2015 UTC,"He's on ~8 mil a year through 2017, that might be a little too much. I know the cap will jump and everything but we signed all these contracts this past summer in order to prepare for the big free agents in 2016. We only have 33 million committed for that summer (excluding Beal's extension) and the cap is projected to be near 90 million.   I personally would love the trade, it would make us better next year and might push us into the ECF which would make us a more sought after destination since we have just had back to back second round exits."
washingtonwizards,36jkxw,blast0ise,8,Tue May 19 22:29:05 2015 UTC,His contract's only partially guarantees ($400k) the final years so he wouldn't hurt the Wiz in terms of 2016 free agency.

washingtonwizards,36jkxw,jimbo_sly,1 point,Wed May 20 02:08:03 2015 UTC,"Admittedly bad. But the PF position is a very limited and expensive one and we can't just waive away Nene and his contract. Ersan at least has offensive potential for us to play small, which Nene seems to be struggling to provide."
washingtonwizards,36jkxw,Obersts001,3,Wed May 20 20:29:16 2015 UTC,"The ESPN Trade Machine says you can do this trade straight up, but I don't see why the Bucks would agree to this given that Ersan's 2016-17 year is not guaranteed anyway ($400k buyout) and Nene is $5m more expensive."
washingtonwizards,36jkxw,Virulentt,1 point,Wed May 20 15:17:35 2015 UTC,I believe it would help the Bucks out because of their limited size. But you have a point. They're actual contenders now so they aren't just looking to dump veterans and then buyout the players they acquire anymore

washingtonwizards,36jkxw,Gr8WallofChinatown,1 point,Wed May 20 13:10:33 2015 UTC,"He's played small ball for teams before with some success. He's a good rebound and a good enough defender, and more importantly is not as likely to turn into dust unlike Nene playing backup center."

washingtonwizards,36j2od,KORV333R,0,Thu May 21 16:41:50 2015 UTC,"1) the ""KORV333R"" guy can't handle success well apparently and feels the need to be a douche about it.  2) We most likely will lose one, but not the other. I think we'll throw all the money we can at Millsap, and Demarre will accept whoever gives him the most $$$ (probably NYK).   3) We shut down LeBron better than any other team in the reg season, so I doubt he ""shits on them"" like you say he will."

washingtonwizards,36frfw,jiskow,19,Tue May 19 01:14:12 2015 UTC,"We traded the pick, not Clarkson himself, didn't we? Given how ordinary our drafting record is, who knows if we would have picked Clarkson, or even signed him since Glen Rice Jr was still on the roster at the time. Plus it's hard to determine how much success he would have had on a team where he didn't just have a green light to shoot when he wanted."
washingtonwizards,36frfw,nihilistcommunist,10,Tue May 19 02:44:32 2015 UTC,"We traded the pick, not Clarkson himself, didn't we?     Correct. We traded the pick for cash, and the Lakers picked Clarkson."
washingtonwizards,36frfw,SMartEmployee,3,Tue May 19 03:33:48 2015 UTC,"Whether it was gonna be Clarkson or someone else, selling a draft pick for cash is bad and never justifiable. At bare minimum you should punt and get a future second round pick out of it."
washingtonwizards,36frfw,smilezandsouthstar,13,Tue May 19 16:51:09 2015 UTC,"Just my 2 cents as a Lakers fan, but from my understanding, it didn't play out like this at all. I could be wrong because draft night was a year ago and I don't remember every single moment. However, IIRC, we wanted Clarkson and finally found a team that would sell us a pick, so that we could take him. I doubt that if the Wizards intended on having him on their roster, they would've sold a guy with a minuscule cap hit. I love Clarkson, don't get me wrong, but who knows what he would've been with you guys. And that's not a shot at the Wizards either. Wall is a stud. Clarkson was given free reign, particularly towards the end of the season. We still aren't sure if he is a 1 or a 2, long term, and it would've been tough for him to get playing time and/or develop with you guys. If you would've asked me who I would've rather had (as a Wizards fan, which I am not), at the beginning of the season, I would've gone with Sessions over Clarkson. Sure, he made 1st team All-Rookie, but it was a rather weak rookie class, and who knows if he is a flash in the pan, if this is his ceiling (he is already turning 23) this year, or what else could happen. Hindsight is 20/20, I don't think this should be a regret. You guys had a great season. Hopefully Otto Porter can develop into what he was supposed to become. Wish us luck in the lottery tonight, please."
washingtonwizards,36frfw,billsfan13,2,Tue May 19 08:25:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think we've developed anybody apart from Booker who's gone. Wall, Beal and Otto were no brainer picks."
washingtonwizards,36frfw,hellionwins,4,Tue May 19 09:54:03 2015 UTC,"I don't know about Otto being a no brainer. At the time we drafted him we were pretty stacked at SF with Ariza and Webster (pre-injury). I love Otto and think he'll develop well with Wall and Beal, but going back to that draft night I know we thought about taking Noel."
washingtonwizards,36frfw,blast0ise,2,Tue May 19 13:49:08 2015 UTC,"At The time all of the analysts were projecting porter at the #3 pick. Ariza had one more year on his contract. Why not get an sf who fits all your inevitable future needs at the position.   Grunfeld had his hands tied, it was playoffs or get fired. Noel would've been the better pick, without even knowing how good of a rookie he was this year. But his acl injury, and a couple of high profile big man injuries like Bynum made his value unpredictable. How else could a consensus #1 drop to #6."
washingtonwizards,36frfw,hellionwins,2,Tue May 19 13:59:29 2015 UTC,"So yea, it wasn't a no brainer. It was to go for the higher risk, higher reward player or the safer player and we decided to go safe. 2013 was a weak draft, porter was the best SF in the draft but that wasn't saying much seeing as how mediocre the field was. Noel was the consensus #1 that we let walk by, but even with the injury history he had a higher chance of being a high impact player (especially defensively) in his career due to raw talent. I'm sure a lot of time was spent deciding between the two in the few minutes we had to decide"
washingtonwizards,36frfw,blast0ise,5,Tue May 19 14:38:11 2015 UTC,"Might as well blame everybody ahead of the Wiz who didn't pick Clarkson. If they did a re-draft he'd probably be in the top 15 or so picks. Nobody knew he'd be this good, Lakers included."
washingtonwizards,36frfw,anon__sequitur,3,Tue May 19 04:00:35 2015 UTC,Wouldn't have played even if we did pick him with that pick. Randy just now gave Otto minutes after 2 years in league.

I watched a number of Lakers games where you could tell Clarkson is a legit NBA point guard, if not a starter he could've been a dynamite backup"
washingtonwizards,36frfw,Boymankid,1 point,Tue May 19 03:22:28 2015 UTC,Hindsight is 20/20. Imagine if we didn't trade that 5th pick for Mike Miller and Randy Foye. Not worth dwelling on.

washingtonwizards,36e5as,migosversace121,10,Mon May 18 17:55:22 2015 UTC,They've won three playoff series since 1982. You try getting a city to fully embrace that.
washingtonwizards,36e5as,DCorNothing,-4,Mon May 18 20:06:48 2015 UTC,"Right, but the past two years they have won a series each time. Each time they've come very close to making the conference finals. Next year will mark a third straight year in the playoffs, and we all know they will make it. Now, whether they make it as a serious contender or just by virtue of eastern conference mediocrity, that remains to be seen, but they will make it for a third straight year. I would hope that's enough sustained success to really draw fans in, especially if they are a legit threat. If that doesn't do it, I don't think anything will, unless they actually make a run to the finals or get Kevin Durant."
washingtonwizards,36e5as,Obersts001,7,Mon May 18 20:15:32 2015 UTC,"If KD comes, it will become instantly impossible to get tickets. Otherwise I expect a long slow increase in ST holders and attendance overall, until Wall leaves. These things take time."
washingtonwizards,36e5as,euge_taco,2,Mon May 18 19:21:36 2015 UTC,"I think you're probably right, but that just seems cheap. Like how Heat fans treated getting success handed to them on a silver platter. I don't know, I obviously want KD, but I also want to see DC embrace the Wizards regardless of who is playing for them. But that's probably wishful thinking."

washingtonwizards,36e5as,cheddar_robert,8,Tue May 19 21:45:46 2015 UTC,Wizards popularity has been steadily rising. More of my peers and friends are fans of the Wizards now. Give it time. It took the Caps years to build their fanbase to what it is now. The Nats have a great fanbase especially since there were a new club that had a shitty start.
washingtonwizards,36e5as,madlate,12,Tue May 19 03:01:06 2015 UTC,"The Problem with the Wizards is they've been so bad for so long, utterly unwatchable for over 30 years. There's no history of greatness to feel nostalgic about. Only now is a bandwagon starting to form, and I think that if we can become perennial contenders in the John Wall era, you'll see a more dedicated fanbase in the years to come."
washingtonwizards,36e5as,Obersts001,3,Mon May 18 18:32:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know, we went through a four year stretch in the mid-2000s during the Gilbert years. I know we never went to far, but it was still a few successful years.   Maybe this just isn't a basketball town. The Hawks haven't had much success and Atlanta went nuts for them this year."
washingtonwizards,36e5as,Boymankid,7,Mon May 18 18:42:03 2015 UTC,"Maybe this just isn't a basketball town.   Yep. It just isn't a big basketball town. I think no matter how much success the Wizards have, basketball will come second or even third in DC, which sucks but is just the reality.   Also DC is a weird city man. It's going through major gentrification right now and our demographics is a lot of out of towners / transplants who are already fans of their hometown team, if they even follow basketball in the first place.   So that leaves DC natives, many of which have been overly disappointed in past years and have given up on the Wizards, or just never followed them. You see it during the regular season in the verizon center. Our attendance was horrible and when a big market team comes to town sometimes their fans are louder than ours are. Pretty embarrassing."
washingtonwizards,36e5as,SMartEmployee,3,Mon May 18 18:49:14 2015 UTC,"In regards to the whole transplant argument, I see your point. With that said, I work with a lot of people who are in that category and they seem to really embrace the Nats/Caps even though they aren't from DC. Departments at offices go to social outings at Nats/Caps games, but if you suggest doing a Wizards game, everyone will look at you like you're asking them to go to a morgue.   I went to Game 4, and it was embarrassing. It was like 60% full. Where as a Nats regular season game is consistently packed to the brim."
washingtonwizards,36e5as,Boymankid,4,Mon May 18 18:56:24 2015 UTC,"I went to Game 4, and it was embarrassing. It was like 60% full. Where as a Nats regular season game is consistently packed to the brim.   Technically, every playoff game sold out. But I understand the frustration, having attended about 35 games this year and wanting more people in the seats. There are a few things to consider:   Corporate tickets often go unused - they're bought because it's a potential business development thing and no one personally has to pay, but then there's no interest from clients or partners so nobody goes. People show up late - like, Miami Heat late. There was not a single game this year where the place was 80%+ full after the first quarter. The fans eventually show up, though -- I had two Hawks fans show up in their seats next to me on Friday as the 2nd half started. Just no urgency. The clubs suck people out of the seats. Ever see the huge streams of people file out of the Courtside Club at the end of the 3rd quarter when they close? Many of those people are in the club drinking the entire game before that because it's free to drink. I found myself in the Acela Club for Game 3 of the ATL series in the 3rd quarter, and the entire bar that faces away from the court was packed. They're not even watching the game.   There's not a passion among people to get there early, watch the game, and be a part of the action. It's just a social event, or the kickoff to a bigger social event after the game. Not sure how you solve it given that Ted just made three more sections in the 200 level ""club access"" seats with higher prices so the butts-in-seats problem will get worse next season."
washingtonwizards,36e5as,Gr8WallofChinatown,2,Mon May 18 19:30:19 2015 UTC,"I think you’re absolutely right and it’s stupid adding those kind of seats. But in regards to the corporate ticketholders, I remember my brother’s old company had season tickets to the Nats. Damn good season tickets, too. President clubs with the free food and drinks and a great view. They couldn’t give them away. The Nats then became good and every client wanted them. All it really took was that 2012 season and suddenly they became the hottest ticket in town. So you would think that these companies would be able to fill their seats now that the Wizards are good, but I guess not."
washingtonwizards,36e5as,NotJustAnebadi,4,Mon May 18 19:56:58 2015 UTC,"Look at the Nationals attendance from 05-11. Not very sexy. 12-15, much better. Nationals have sold out Wednesday day games this year. Why is that? Consistent success.   Wizards have now strung 2 encouraging seasons together. I would say we would see a nice jump in attendance but that won't be the case if they keep hacking ticket prices up. Still, expect a better buzz and following from the Wiz next year.   The Redskins have a stranglehold on this town, which I hate because although I love my DC teams I don't want to live in a place where Daniel Snyder is the most powerful owner in the town. The Lerners of the NATS and Leonsis of the Wiz/Caps are both great owners. They will eventually have this city behind them 100% the way people still follow the Skins.   Basketball is on the upswing and within 10 years it could be the dominant sport in the U.S. At any rate, the Wizards, with smart picks of Wall-Beal-Porter have set themselves up to contend in the Eastern Conference for years to come.   TL;DR  So to answer your question - yes, eventually the Wizards will have this city behind them."
washingtonwizards,36e5as,TophMasterFlex,4,Tue May 19 03:27:28 2015 UTC,"I may be biased as a Nats season ticket holder, but I think the (face value) ticket prices play a role in attendance. I can get really good seats at Nats Park for $40: http://i.imgur.com/izrfjYD.jpg    Really good (comparable) sideline seats at the phone booth (Wiz and Caps) have a face value of over $100.    While tickets to Wiz games are relatively cheap compared to other NBA teams, I think if Ted really wants to sell out regular season home games he should lower ticket prices until the fan base grows."
washingtonwizards,36e5as,euge_taco,3,Tue May 19 05:31:44 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. In the 13-14 season for the Wizards I used to buy tickets behind one of the baskets for $30 a pop which IMO was a great price to be right there for the action. This season, the same ticket was about $60 per. I still bought my tickets when I could this season but I can imagine a lot of people were turned off by the relative increase in prices, and that's a good point about the Nationals. Although they usually don't play at the same time, a fan is more likely to buy a Nationals ticket if only for the reason that relatively its cheaper to go."
washingtonwizards,36e5as,Kirbybajerby,1 point,Tue May 19 09:48:57 2015 UTC,Well MLB plays a lot more games than the NBA which devalues the tickets for MlB
washingtonwizards,36e5as,kandeeezy,3,Tue May 19 23:31:59 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, another aspect of this is that the ticket prices aren't friendly to young high school or college kids nearby. I know plenty of College kids and students who were so excited that the Wizards were in the playoffs, and we would always talk about the games in school, but couldn't afford tickets to actually go and see them and root (myself included)."
washingtonwizards,36e5as,7032CharmCity,5,Mon May 18 23:42:33 2015 UTC,They had playoff tickets for as low as $35 bucks in round 1. The playoffs were actually more affordable than some regular season games. But I know what you mean and know the college struggle well.
washingtonwizards,36e5as,justinrwright,3,Tue May 19 03:16:24 2015 UTC,Tickets were as low as 35 for Round 2 as well.
washingtonwizards,36e5as,UNCLE_ROBOCOP,3,Tue May 19 18:22:28 2015 UTC,Wizards tickets are actually pretty low compared to top tier cities like Chicago or LA. Hell even the Knicks tickets are still more expensive.
washingtonwizards,36e5as,ireddit270,2,Tue May 19 13:20:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know very many non-white people from the DMV who care at all about the Caps or Nats (although they definitely exist, but hockey especially is a pretty white sport with a primarily white fanbase). I think the Wizards are (a very distant) second to the Redskins among minorities. Media coverage, however, certainly favors Caps and Nats over the Wiz - hence the difficulty for the lay resident following the Wiz success.  But, I agree with the majority of the group here that it will take sustained improvement over a period of time to get people truly excited and to get people over the hump of ""rooting for their home NBA teams"" for those in our city who have moved here as adults or the teams they currently root for in the NBA if they are born and raised in the DMV..."
washingtonwizards,36e5as,7032CharmCity,6,Tue May 19 15:59:54 2015 UTC,"I think you raise something that isn't truly being discussed: race.  I know it's a taboo discussion, but I think it needs to be mentioned. Suburban DMV white people don't seem to like the NBA. This is coming from someone raised in a predominately white DC suburb in Maryland. They seem to favor college basketball much more than the NBA, and when you ask them why they don't like the NBA, they'll say something stupid like ""they don't play defense"". I think the reality is that suburban white families are willing to make the journey into DC for Nats and Caps games, but not Wizards games. Now, what that reason is, I'm not entirely sure. As you mentioned, Nats/Caps have a largely white fanbase and the Wizards have a high percentage of minority fans.   Regretfully, I think it's something that could be a reality."
washingtonwizards,36e5as,gbrldz,1 point,Tue May 19 16:30:16 2015 UTC,"The excuses they give for why college basketball is ""superior"" are usually 100% asinine.  The NBA still has the thug image it earned from the post-Jordan era despite the fact that NBA players rarely get into off the court issues these days.  Then again, the NFL is as popular as ever and people continue to suck off whatever the NFL feeds them 12 months out of the year."
washingtonwizards,36e5as,NotKenanThompson,2,Wed May 20 15:18:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've shared this frustration, but it's definitely picking up, at least in Columbia Heights where I live. Even a year ago you never saw Wiz gear and the bars would be silent when the games were on. Now, I see it all the time and Lou's up here was pretty full and loud for game 6.   Give it time: the team should be about to make the playoffs for 10ish straight years and the fan base will grow and we'll all be bitching about the good old days of cheap tix on StubHub and reminiscing about cheers for free chicken.  As for people at your office, people in mine act like I live in a war zone for living inside the District: people are slow to change their mind."

For casual fans it helps to have a guy who's starting in the ASG, winning the dunk contest, Sportscenter Top 10 highlights throughout the season, etc - he's the initial draw for casual fans.  Once the team starts actually stringing together strong winning seasons (regular season AND playoffs) I am sure the support will come. Most people absorb sports media through ESPN and large outlets, if Wall and the Wiz begin to receive hype in those outlets you'll see more and more DC residents wanting to identify as Wiz fans and go to the games."

washingtonwizards,36dibt,tooz,6,Mon May 18 23:20:56 2015 UTC,Wizards three-point attempt rate:  13-14: 0.246  Playoffs: 0.211  14-15: 0.203  Playoffs: 0.276  Gotta love how reactive the Wiz are to whatever worked in the postseason.
washingtonwizards,36dibt,smilezandsouthstar,4,Mon May 18 16:41:06 2015 UTC,Trevor Ariza account for a great deal of those regular season 3's in 13-14. I don't think this is as much reactive as just how unproductive and slow Nene was in the playoffs and how much better we generally played with a stretch 4.
washingtonwizards,36dibt,MisterDobalina,3,Mon May 18 18:22:39 2015 UTC,"Hmm. That leaves Humphries in an interesting position. He's still somewhat mobile in the open court, at least, so we can run with him some.   Still, I'll take whatever I can get if it means Wittman actually adapts some."
washingtonwizards,36dibt,Mehberry,2,Mon May 18 17:46:49 2015 UTC,He's been working on his 3 point shot apparently so if he shows he's capable of spreading the floor he would be awesome to have coming off the bench.
washingtonwizards,36dibt,Zorodude77,2,Tue May 19 00:31:47 2015 UTC,"Yea during shoot arounds of the hawks series he was reigning 3's, obviously means nothing unless he can do it in a game, but could be an interesting twist."
washingtonwizards,36dibt,Mortprsgt,16,Tue May 19 04:59:19 2015 UTC,"I would love for that to happen too.. with a spread floor, Gortat is much more effective and has space in the PnR"
washingtonwizards,36dibt,ireddit270,7,Mon May 18 15:08:24 2015 UTC,"Yup. You could tell how effective he was with a spaced floor.  I still really like Nene, but I think as our team is growing and evolving, some players just don't fit as well as they use too."
washingtonwizards,36dibt,anon__sequitur,13,Mon May 18 15:11:08 2015 UTC,"I love Gortat,  but I hate when players make public comments about what sort of players their teams should be signing/trading/replacing. It's just poison for your teammates. I'm sure he's frustrated, as Nene's declining athleticism has caused Gortat's game to suffer when they're both on the court. But just like Wall was criticized for making these same statements a couple of years ago, we should be telling Gortat to keep quiet about who deserves to be on the team or not."
washingtonwizards,36dibt,madlate,3,Mon May 18 17:10:47 2015 UTC,"yeah there isn't really anything good that can come from making statements like these. just keep it within the team setting, let the people in charge know how you feel but don't put it out in the public eye like this. it comes off as kind of disrespectful to Nene."
washingtonwizards,36dibt,Obersts001,8,Mon May 18 17:19:09 2015 UTC,"The penciled-in starting five next November should be Wall - Beal - Porter - Pierce - Gortat, with Nene off the bench and anchoring the 2nd unit."
washingtonwizards,36dibt,the_ghost_of_ODB,5,Mon May 18 16:31:47 2015 UTC,I think I would prefer Pierce coming off bench as well to keep him fresher. Maybe Hump can expand his range to three point line and he could start
washingtonwizards,36dibt,Zorodude77,3,Mon May 18 20:52:41 2015 UTC,"Agreed, although I think we should try to sign a starting 4 in the offseason, either a stretch 4 or a D and Rebound guy. Having Pierce off the bench and as fresh as possible for the post season would be wonderful."
washingtonwizards,36dibt,madlate,2,Tue May 19 00:34:02 2015 UTC,Is Pierce coming back next season though?
washingtonwizards,36dibt,Boymankid,8,Mon May 18 17:17:26 2015 UTC,Wittman said he expects him back but we don't know just yet.
washingtonwizards,36dibt,Obersts001,5,Mon May 18 17:38:07 2015 UTC,"He gave no interviews today, so no one really knows. He may not even know yet."
washingtonwizards,36dibt,smilezandsouthstar,9,Mon May 18 17:54:48 2015 UTC,@jorgeccastillo: Nene on playing more 5: “I hope not.” Said he’d be ok with coming off the bench tho.
washingtonwizards,36dibt,Mehberry,12,Mon May 18 17:03:58 2015 UTC,Well it's something that he's at least considering a bench role.
washingtonwizards,36dibt,nihilistcommunist,3,Mon May 18 17:48:24 2015 UTC,"He's played off the bench sporadically fairly willingly in the past couple of years, I don't think he'd be vehemently opposed to making a permanent move."
washingtonwizards,36dibt,DWood10,4,Tue May 19 02:42:49 2015 UTC,"If we can get that stretch 4 and bring Hump, Nene & whoever we draft off the bench that'd be great. Draymond Green is who I want but he's gonna be too expensive."
washingtonwizards,36dibt,Mehberry,2,Mon May 18 17:53:37 2015 UTC,"Dray is getting the market max, sadly. Warriors probably pay it."
washingtonwizards,36dibt,madlate,2,Mon May 18 20:00:18 2015 UTC,was thinking the same thing about draymond. he would be perfect.
washingtonwizards,36dibt,judunno5,3,Tue May 19 13:26:33 2015 UTC,Too bad we have Nene on the books for another year for $13m.

washingtonwizards,36dibt,jeffsays,6,Mon May 18 17:02:51 2015 UTC,"Kris Humphries, apparently he's been working on his 3"
washingtonwizards,36dibt,Zorodude77,5,Mon May 18 20:05:52 2015 UTC,"I would love that, he's such a good rebounder and always gives his all. He's decent from midrange so I wouldn't be surprised if he develops his 3 enough."

washingtonwizards,36dibt,xTETSUOx,3,Mon May 18 19:22:18 2015 UTC,Nene is an expiring contract so he has some trade value right?

washingtonwizards,36dibt,limiter_remove,5,Mon May 18 20:08:16 2015 UTC,We need to resign Drew Gooden. He played great for the Wizards and can hit threes now. And he's gets in the paint on defense and grabs boards. The best of both worlds.
washingtonwizards,36dibt,Mehberry,14,Mon May 18 16:20:05 2015 UTC,I hope you look forward to no defense and a useless Gooden when he can't hit threes.  No thanks. Get some fresh blood.
washingtonwizards,36dibt,smilezandsouthstar,3,Mon May 18 16:28:18 2015 UTC,I'll take Gooden back if he's happy with the veteran's minimum but his amnesty payments from the Bucks are all up so he probably wants to get paid.
washingtonwizards,36dibt,Mehberry,2,Mon May 18 16:33:10 2015 UTC,"I can't take his sporadic and questionable offense + his consistently lacking defense again. Please no more. I got nothing against him being a third stringer if we need bodies for the bench, even if I don't necessarily prefer it, but we gotta get an actual stretch 4."

washingtonwizards,36dibt,limiter_remove,0,Tue May 19 16:34:27 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't want him starting, but off the bench we could use him. He did more than Nene in these playoffs."
washingtonwizards,36dibt,Mehberry,2,Mon May 18 16:40:32 2015 UTC,"That's a hell of a low bar though.  And I complained about Gooden almost as much as Nene, at that. The dude is ancient."
washingtonwizards,36dibt,limiter_remove,1 point,Mon May 18 16:45:19 2015 UTC,"If he takes 1.5 mil to play for us, I have no complaints. Definitely nothing more. Humphries already gets paid 5 mil to sit on the bench, even though I do think he is a capable player."
washingtonwizards,36dibt,madlate,2,Mon May 18 16:49:32 2015 UTC,Humphries helped us a lot during the regular season. Almost didn't play any minutes in the playoffs but we can't forget that he helped us get there.
washingtonwizards,36dibt,Gr8WallofChinatown,1 point,Mon May 18 17:16:57 2015 UTC,He was nonexistent in the regular season and below average in the second round of the playoffs

washingtonwizards,36dibt,forgotten_sound,3,Mon May 18 17:37:28 2015 UTC,Dunno why the down votes. I love Ersan.
washingtonwizards,36dibt,Mehberry,3,Mon May 18 19:19:33 2015 UTC,"That is...intriguing. Ersan for Nene straight up might actually be possible. I wouldn't want to exchange anything more than a second for Mayo, though, and I'm not sure the Bucks take that."

washingtonwizards,36dibt,ragtime_sam,1 point,Mon May 18 22:11:00 2015 UTC,No way to make those salaries match
washingtonwizards,36dibt,bhotep,1 point,Tue May 19 00:54:17 2015 UTC,"How about something like this?. Granted, this is a scenario for this past year, so maybe a sign and trade for Seraphin + Nene + draft picks/salaries for Gordon and Anderson?  We get a stretch 4, a decent (albeit injury prone and inconsistent) scoring guard who can also handle the ball for our 2nd unit, and continued payroll flexibility in 2016 as both players expire that year.  Pelicans get clear of Gordon (who I feel they and their fans have soured on), a low-post big who can score at an efficient rate and who's weaknesses would be covered by Anthony Davis in Seraphin (who happens to speak French and may find a niche culturally in New Orleans, and also is hungry to have an opportunity to start),  Nene (who would be a decent 3rd/4th big, and could play his desired position of the 4 next to Asik), and probably also some form of draft pick.   Would that be enough for NO? If it was a sign and trade, we'd likely have to shed some salary, I'm guessing."

washingtonwizards,36dibt,FreshPrinceOfMD,2,Mon May 18 15:01:13 2015 UTC,Moving Nene in the off season would be my first choice. Especially if he's unwilling to play the 5. Marc probably should've kept this out of the public for tensions sake but he knows what's up honestly
washingtonwizards,36dibt,ragtime_sam,2,Mon May 18 18:20:30 2015 UTC,Yeah he's kind of run his course with us as a forward. It gets old not being able to guard stretch fours
washingtonwizards,36dibt,leo2k2ndc,3,Tue May 19 00:53:35 2015 UTC,"LoL, Oh lawd. I just don't see Nene as a good team mate if he isn't getting his own."
washingtonwizards,36dibt,ZachAc,1 point,Mon May 18 16:45:48 2015 UTC,I was thinking about this but what about David Lee? I was browsing r/nba and saw this and was thinking about off-season trade prospects.
washingtonwizards,36dibt,Mehberry,10,Mon May 18 15:55:10 2015 UTC,Oh good Christ no. He's even worse than Nene.
washingtonwizards,36f5up,Cpr196,5,Mon May 18 22:23:25 2015 UTC,"Pass on Lou, he's a ball hog and would take minutes away from Sessions and Porter who are better team players"
washingtonwizards,36f5up,Boymankid,4,Tue May 19 03:28:30 2015 UTC,I think the 2nd unit needs a ballhog. The biggest issue with the 2nd unit for so much of the year was NO ONE COULD FUCKING SCORE. That's why we got Sessions. He is a ballhog. He can score. Lou Williams can do it better though.
washingtonwizards,36f5up,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,2,Tue May 19 16:28:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think we need a 2 guard. Sessions and porter can both do it, and temple in a pinch.   Beal plays a lot of minutes with bench units. That gives sessions and porter more time with wall."
washingtonwizards,36f5up,EthelredTheUnsteady,2,Tue May 19 00:19:35 2015 UTC,"We'll play deeper rotations in the regular season than we did in the playoffs, and while I expect Temple to pick up his player option, I'm not sure I want him as the primary Beal backup for the majority of the season. Playing Porter at the 2 could be interesting, though."
washingtonwizards,36f5up,Obersts001,1 point,Tue May 19 02:35:24 2015 UTC,"We will play deeper rotations, but if beal and wall play 35 mpg each, there's only 26 remaining backcourt minutes. If Ramon plays 20, porter just needs to play the 2 for  half a quarter."
washingtonwizards,36f5up,EthelredTheUnsteady,1 point,Tue May 19 04:06:15 2015 UTC,Temple wouldn't make another team in the league. Let's not sell ourselves short here.
washingtonwizards,36f5up,majornvrminor,2,Wed May 20 13:25:59 2015 UTC,Bynum won't be back. That spot will go to whoever we take in the 2nd round (assuming that's when we take a guard). Guessing it will be a backup point.
washingtonwizards,36f5up,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,3,Tue May 19 16:31:58 2015 UTC,I just want to get rid of Temple completely. He's a D-league player at best.
washingtonwizards,36f5up,Shaidester,0,Tue May 19 01:50:32 2015 UTC,Bingo. Only we would have him play significant minutes
washingtonwizards,36f5up,majornvrminor,1 point,Wed May 20 13:26:58 2015 UTC,"You're quoting me there. Honestly, other than the big names, I have no idea who's a RFA or UFA this season among the 2nd tier players on other teams. It's going to be an odd free agent market because of the cartfuls of money available in '16, so you will likely see some guys sign one-year deals and bet on themselves (though I think signing a one-year deal with a new team causes problems in the next contract with future salary escalators / Bird rights, IIRC). Others will take the guaranteed money now.   The Wiz are likely going to be more into the short-term deals because it's all about 2016 here -- offer Beal his first extension (may be a max deal?) and pursue the prize FA. So maybe they'll be able to attract a higher caliber of talent on a one-year deal this year than they could in normal years. But honestly, whoever we end up with will probably include a surprise or two because they always do."

washingtonwizards,36efhc,WizOfAwesSite,5,Mon May 18 19:14:52 2015 UTC,"Randy's shift in the types of lineups he used in the playoffs was the epitome of ""even a blind squirrel finds a nut every once in a while."" He said the entire season that his team wasn't designed around shooting threes even though every metric available said that was the way the NBA was going, and then the second he tries it and it SHOCKINGLY works, he wants to pretend that he knew this all along.   The announcers kept saying to give him credit for the emergence of OPJ, but why? We should be blaming him for not giving him the minutes Webster, Temple and Butler (after the hot start) were wasting and blame him for that transformation being delayed six months.  Wittman wants to act coy about all of his ""strategies"" but the only real strategy he employs is blaming players for when things go wrong, and masking the fact that he has NO FUCKING CLUE what to do on offense by putting up an Iron Curtain so the media doesn't know what is — or isn't — going on in his head."
washingtonwizards,36efhc,nmcaff,2,Mon May 18 20:17:27 2015 UTC,yea playing pierce at the 4 and actually letting otto continuously play are just simple things that made a big difference in the team. the fucker played the game too well though. having the success they did in the playoffs while being hampered by wall's injury makes randy look smarter than he is. i do like the recent moves grunfield has made though. his ideas have paid off in the past two years. this year i hope he can do something.
washingtonwizards,36efhc,ruffus4life,2,Tue May 19 01:03:07 2015 UTC,Randy Wittman lost Game 6 - Beal on Teague and Schroder is inexcusable after he got beat time and again on drives to the hoop.    He's supposed to be a great defensive coach?
washingtonwizards,36efhc,diytry,1 point,Mon May 18 20:03:44 2015 UTC,"Even though I kind of love Coach Witt in his naivete and how he seems to truly care about the men on the team, I agree. I think we need to replace Coach Witt this summer for 2 reasons: 1) to help get us over the hump from good to great and to figure how to resolve our recurring issue of closing out games (how many times have we lost a big lead in the 3rd or 4th quarter these past couple of years?); and 2) to attract free agents in 2016 (namely KD).   What do you guys think of Mark Jackson for the Wiz? I think he'd be a great fit for our squad..."
washingtonwizards,36efhc,kandeeezy,1 point,Tue May 19 16:56:15 2015 UTC,"I really think the Wizards have exceeded expectations in the playoffs the past two seasons solely because the benches get shorter in the playoffs.  I think the 2014 Wiz lineup of Wall-Beal-Ariza-Nene-Gortat was one of the best units in the league in terms of +/- when they were on the court.  I believe the Wall-Beal-Pierce-Nene-Gortat unit was also one of the Top 5 this year.  The talent is there, even the bench is okay, but the lineups and overall offensive philosophy are head scratching and likely cost the Wiz a half a dozen regular season games.    All that being said though, Ted won't be firing Randy.  If Randy wasn't fired after the 20 point loss to Minny followed by the loss to the Sixers, he certainly won't be now."
washingtonwizards,36dsna,oozingmachismo,4,Mon May 18 16:20:23 2015 UTC,"we need a stretch 4. I think that's pretty much the consensus at this point.   I love Nene and he's great when he's playing well, but I would like to see him on the second unit next year."

Here's the fate of the others:   Seraphin will sign elsewhere for more money and more years than the Wiz will offer Rasual Butler and Will Bynum are at the end of their one-year deals and are unlikely to return. Both may come to camp but neither is likely a keeper; Bynum might be a tad more likely to rejoin based on position and age. Drew Gooden said today during exit interviews that he'd love to return but was open to whatever. So maybe they'll do another one-year deal, maybe not. Blair is useless so we could use another backup PF who can shoot from distance.   So where do we focus? I see three priorities, in order:   A PF who can shoot from beyond 16 feet. We are stuck with Nene this year but it's his last, and Hump can be a reliable backup who will hit the boards hard, but what happens in '16? If there's a poor man's Kevin Love available at #19 in the draft, we will jump on him even if he's a year or two away from major contributions. A backup to Gortat. We got nobody here and Gortat isn't going to play 48 minutes / game. Seraphin was a good backup who improved every season he was here but he wants to start somewhere so I would expect him to get a multi-year deal once FA opens. Just want anyone who can protect the rim and run an occasional PnR. An outside shooting touch would be a plus. A backup to Beal. Beal was hurt at the beginning of this past season and Temple / Butler filled in better than expected, but then both regressed and SG was a tough position for us - we relied on a Wall / Sessions / Beal rotation in the playoffs but that's not acceptable in the regular season.    Oh, and Wittman will be back. No way it doesn't happen."
washingtonwizards,36dsna,Obersts001,0,Mon May 18 18:16:59 2015 UTC,"Uh....    First of all, I'm pretty sure Seraphin won't get a starting role anywhere else either. I'll be very shocked to see anyone offer him anything spectacular to force him out of Washington. He's staying.                 If there's a poor man's Kevin Love available at #19 in the draft, we will jump on him even if he's a year or two away from major contributions.    What's the point if he's not going to help us right NOW.               More than anything, I wish we somehow dumped Nene's 13mill and somehow have LMA sign with us haha"
washingtonwizards,36dsna,peterkimmm,1 point,Tue May 19 03:25:56 2015 UTC,"He wants an opportunity to start, and someone will offer him a chance to compete for one. Teams wanted to trade for him late in the season but we needed him for the playoffs. He's a 25-year-old who has only played competitive ball for nine years, and he's improved each year. He's going to get a multi-year deal at a higher annual rate than the $4m we paid him last year. It's just a fact at this point."
washingtonwizards,36czzv,AppleMeow,32,Mon May 18 12:03:51 2015 UTC,"He played like absolute dogshit in the playoffs. Bad defense, poor finishing, bonehead turnovers, seemingly decreased athleticism, and what looked like a shitty attitude. He didn't show up."
washingtonwizards,36czzv,Nanny_McPhee,9,Mon May 18 12:34:04 2015 UTC,Also due to make 13 million next year.
washingtonwizards,36czzv,TouchTheSky420,8,Mon May 18 13:25:36 2015 UTC,"Not to mention he blew the last game so bad he nearly singlehandedly put the team in a ""beat the buzzer"" situation."
washingtonwizards,36czzv,SherlockBrolmes,10,Mon May 18 14:31:00 2015 UTC,"If he played well in the playoffs we would have easily won 2 of the games we lost.    He missed some CRUCIAL rebounds that would have secured wins.  I appreciate what he has done in the past for us, but this year's playoffs were terrible.  Not to mention some terrible shot selection"
washingtonwizards,36czzv,CHillside,7,Mon May 18 13:48:48 2015 UTC,"I just hate he doesn't jump ever. That makes his rebounding and defense worse in my opinion. Also he is lazy on defense if he is playing someone who can stretch the floor. Which is crazy because like I said before, he doesn't rebound or block very well, so why isn't he staying on his man. He does box out fairly well, and can get hot on O, but with his age and diminished play, better to try to get something for him this year then keep him this year. (maybe a 2nd round pick)"
washingtonwizards,36czzv,leo2k2ndc,7,Mon May 18 14:02:57 2015 UTC,He has a really bad chronic plantar fasciitis. It's really worn down on him over the years. I think he also stated he is retiring after his contract ends due to his body not being able to keep up anymore and all the chronic injuries are wearing him down
washingtonwizards,36czzv,Gr8WallofChinatown,3,Mon May 18 14:41:42 2015 UTC,"Yea, he should retire after next year, I think, cause he looks slow, unless he'd want to come off the bench for a contender, but we a little ways away. If Wall and Beal step up their scoring consistency maybe we'd be that team.  I'm mad we got Martell for 2 more years, cause he definitely want to retire, but ain't gonna give that dumb contract we gave him up. Can't be mad, I wouldn't give up that money either."
washingtonwizards,36czzv,leo2k2ndc,2,Mon May 18 16:48:24 2015 UTC,yeah we messed up big time with Martell.
washingtonwizards,36czzv,madlate,2,Mon May 18 17:22:18 2015 UTC,"If he stay relatively healthy in the off season, he may be playable next year. He looked alright at the end of the last couple games he played, although blow outs"
washingtonwizards,36czzv,leo2k2ndc,4,Mon May 18 18:20:21 2015 UTC,with his age and diminished play   This is how we know he won't improve.
washingtonwizards,36czzv,SlobBarker,5,Mon May 18 14:27:51 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna try to explain this from a perspective excluding these playoffs since I've wanted him gone for a while.   He is goddamned expensive. We could sign 2 or 3 decent role players which we very much need for our bench for the price we pay Nene.  He is old and frail. He's simply not as quick as he once was, and he's made of glass. That makes our frontcourt a big liability. If he's too proud not to come off the bench to adjust for this, then we've got a big problem.  Even at his best, he is a wrench in our ideal offense. He isn't quick, he can't reliably stretch the floor with 3's and even his jumper is unreliable. His free throw shooting is awful even for big men standards.  He isn't at his best to begin with. He seems to just zone out at times, and has awful rebounding effort. His defensive skills have heavily eroded for whatever reason, and Gortat isn't exactly DPOY rim protection. That's a huge liability which all but nullifies our stellar perimeter defense. Moreover, he constantly settles for jumpers and clogs offensive flow for possessions, holding the ball for 12 seconds and then awkwardly backing down his man for a bad ISO tossup."
washingtonwizards,36czzv,Mehberry,2,Mon May 18 16:36:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with this, I think the solution (assuming we can't make a reasonable trade, which I think is probably the case) is to seriously limit his minutes. Nene cannot, just cannot play 100 games a year. He's probably never going to be athletic enough again to play like he did when he first got here, but I have to think if they were able to keep him to 20 minutes a game for 60 regular season games that he would still be a significant benefit to the team.  I also think it's wrong to accuse him of having a bad attitude, being a stat-driven, me-first player, anything like that (not responding directly to the above comment on this). It's just crazy. He's a player on the decline, he's not gonna have great performances every night.  But he does seem to lose concentration or genera effectiveness or something. It just doesn't seem to me, at all, like a bad attitude."
washingtonwizards,36czzv,anon__sequitur,1 point,Mon May 18 17:21:30 2015 UTC,"That seems like a good idea, I think seraphin may be able to step up but it would be very risky to put him up. So unfortunately because of nenes big contract it doesn't seem feasible to have him on the bench"
washingtonwizards,36czzv,Brim4889,3,Mon May 18 22:24:58 2015 UTC,"He's a guy who's counting stats look underwhelming but his teams have always played better with him on the floor. In the playoffs that changed- while his counting states were still low, his lineups were no longer benefiting in +/- with him on the court. I'm hoping it's just something where he was a little gassed and couldn't do all the little things he does well, but with his age and injurt history that might just be the new Nene in his decline"
washingtonwizards,36czzv,3YCW,3,Mon May 18 13:14:30 2015 UTC,"The frustrating part with Nene is sometimes I feel like he goes from not having the right amount of effort, to having sooo much that he gets fired up and basically takes him self out of the game. Playoffs and regular season Bulls games especially. Granted, he has played great over the years and for a while was the most solid and consistent player. I still like him, but not for 13 Mil."
washingtonwizards,36czzv,yaboymattyk,2,Mon May 18 14:06:50 2015 UTC,"Overpaid for what he brings. Of course not his fault, but is made of glass. Gave up in the playoffs. Resorts to shitty post up isolation plays that drain 10+ seconds off the clock. Awful rim protector and awful on defensive shifts in general. Pretty fucking slow on the PnR."
washingtonwizards,36czzv,KORV333R,0,Tue May 19 06:10:52 2015 UTC,"He plays for the wizards so that already makes him unlikeable and hate able. Second, he got shut down by millsap even tho millsap is like 10 inches shorter. Third, nene is Vietnamese for shit and that's how he played during the playoffs."

washingtonwizards,36bi0d,ruffus4life,3,Mon May 18 06:26:45 2015 UTC,i am definitely feeling Ryan anderson. LMA would be a reach unfortunately as the prevailing sense is that he wants go go home. But its ok  because Ryan can shoot 3s sowe can finally get a true stretch 4
washingtonwizards,36bi0d,kingClutch98,2,Mon May 18 12:00:10 2015 UTC,I like Anderson but he's a godawful defender and not much of a rebounder.

Gerald Green has such low value after a trash season, we wouldn't have to pay him much. Just need more solid pickups like Hump, round out the team a bit.   Need to fill the holes left by seraphin and Webster,  so we can either get a stretch 4, (which somehow to a lot of you guys means a 38% 3pt shooter who is 6'11 and plays D, good luck) and have a Nene/gortat rotation down low, or we can go with our current rotation of hump/gortat/Nene, and get a scorer off the bench to take the pressure off Beal and Pierce."

Gerlad Green is interesting and despite a bad season I'm convinced Wall can make anyone decent (ala Butler) A healthy Hump getting decent PT will be nice as he was great first part of the season. Stretch 4 seems very hard to get. I'm admittedly very worried about both Nene and Gortat moving forward but I know they can play very well."
washingtonwizards,369wgn,BBB1292,1 point,Mon May 18 01:39:50 2015 UTC,"Hump is a great backup 4. But if he's starting, you're settling.   We'll likely have to overpay for a backup center, such is the nature of things, but we need to get Gortat rest. Replacing Martell is easy but we're still paying Martell fat stacks to be useless, so moving him would be ideal but difficult.   EDIT: and no thanks on Gerald Green. He's a smaller Drew Gooden in a dunk contest."
washingtonwizards,369wgn,Mehberry,1 point,Mon May 18 16:43:17 2015 UTC,"Of course you're settling, that's the point of a stopgap, you have them there till you find something better. Also who says he's starting. He'll just have a bigger role since he'll be eating Seraphin's and Gooden's minutes.  That's the issue as well, we shouldn't overpay for a generally unimportant position, when Nene is fine as a backup center. Its generally a rotation anyway, think of all the title contenders backup centers, you aren't blowing anyone away with Clint capela, festus Ezeli, ect... Especially when you can go small (real small) and play a power forward at 5. The teams with good bench bigs run a 3 big rotation (Dmo, Howard, Jones/ TT, Love, Mozgov/ Bogut, Green, Speights/ Duncan, Splitter, Diaw/ and so on) with everyone playing 4 or 5 somewhere throughout the game. You dont need more, other players just come in because of injuries or foul trouble. Don't overpay for something we don't need.   Martell is retiring so that won't be a problem, and Gerald was a 40% 3pt shooter off the bench, which we badly need. We really struggled with Martell hurting and rasual cooling off, and can't be completely reliant on Pierce and Otto hitting 3s to win us games. It doesn't have to be Green, but it has to be someone."

Gotta respect Paul Pierce and the toughness he brought your team.  You guys took it to Atlanta with a banged up John Wall and made it interesting.

washingtonwizards,3667xk,FreshPrinceOfMD,2,Sat May 16 15:35:51 2015 UTC,He's actually a good backup now for his age and will continue to improve. He's leaving to get paid and for a likely starting role somewhere.

washingtonwizards,3667xk,first_time-long_time,7,Mon May 18 01:31:05 2015 UTC,"Anybody who doesn't want to be part of what we are building here, and isn't excited about it, doesn't belong. I love Seraphin as a person, and he is a solid bench option, but I won't mind seeing him go. I will never understand why they gave him Trevor Booker's money last year. I miss Booker so much."
washingtonwizards,3667xk,jrb1851,4,Sat May 16 16:22:30 2015 UTC,"He was definitely excited about it. He loves DC, this was his first team. He just didn't feel like wittman trusted him or respected him enough to really invest in him, and he definitely knows he has the raw skills and talent to be excellent in a couple years under a good coach. I think Otto might stick around if wittman keeps doing what he has been doing with him the last dozen or so games, but it was looking pretty bleak earlier in the season."
washingtonwizards,3667xk,Shaidester,1 point,Sun May 17 03:53:26 2015 UTC,How long of a contract did Booker sign with the Jazz? Could we get him back somehow?
washingtonwizards,3667xk,DWood10,6,Sat May 16 17:40:08 2015 UTC,He's off their books in 2016 so we'll throw him the max instead of KD
washingtonwizards,3667xk,Source_Wiki,2,Sat May 16 19:00:39 2015 UTC,While we're at it lets give Nene a max as well.
washingtonwizards,3667xk,isestrex,5,Sat May 16 21:44:20 2015 UTC,"He's going to look very good for someone else. He might not live up completely for the extent of the contract he'll sign, but I guarantee he'll have a 20 game stretch where he's amazing and everyone wonders how the Wizards could possibly let him slip away."
washingtonwizards,3667xk,Brim4889,6,Sat May 16 17:31:44 2015 UTC,"He has a real pretty hook shot but when that's not falling he's a limited player, at least until he learns he's allowed to pass the ball"
washingtonwizards,3667xk,aIIivant,1 point,Sat May 16 22:23:56 2015 UTC,"exactly. he's either going to make a ton or nothing at all.  and he's a black hole, never looks to pass.  i play with a guy like this and i hesitate to pass him the ball."
washingtonwizards,3667xk,spiiierce,3,Mon May 18 12:42:20 2015 UTC,Kinda sucks but as long as we give Hump more minutes and draft a young big guy with our first rounder I'm fine with this.
washingtonwizards,3667xk,_masterofdisaster,3,Sat May 16 15:42:19 2015 UTC,During the season he was definitely playing his way on to next year's roster but the playoffs were a different story. I'm somewhat surprised but it had to happen.
washingtonwizards,3667xk,Obersts001,3,Sat May 16 15:42:55 2015 UTC,"Good luck #kslife, go get that big money deal and starting job."
washingtonwizards,3667xk,wakaflockasmith,2,Sat May 16 17:27:06 2015 UTC,Good for Kevin. I'm rooting for him.. I think we should be fine with a stretch four/Hump as our power forward duo next season.
washingtonwizards,3667xk,jrb1851,2,Sat May 16 23:35:57 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of the reason his playing fell apart this season was mounting frustration with Wittman not developing him as a player. I think he started to resent the wiz a little bit. Not slacking off, just misdirected energy. Once he finds a franchise he likes and a coach willing to iron out his kinks, I think he's going to explode."
washingtonwizards,3667xk,Kirbybajerby,0,Sun May 17 02:09:46 2015 UTC,"He has actually been Wittmans pet project since he's been in DC. Seraphin has had TONS of chances to prove himself over 5 seasons and he never evolved into a starting quality center.   When his hook shot isn't falling, he's useless on the floor. He's a below average rebounder and defender and requires an ISO to get off his trademark hook shot. He doesn't play well with Wall like Gortat does. He did play well with Andrew Miller(when we had him) in the 2nd unit though."
washingtonwizards,3667xk,disasterjsl,2,Mon May 18 14:06:00 2015 UTC,Oh boy how I wish we kept Booker over him. Really.

washingtonwizards,3667xk,TFDBLoL,1 point,Sat May 16 21:05:57 2015 UTC,"I remember getting a picture with him 4-5 years ago, and spoke to him a bit.

I've enjoyed his game since his Celtics were going up against Kobe's Lakers. Him being an asshole is easier to take when he's being an asshole to Kobe. Wish we could have supported him a bit more in game 5, to give him another miracle playoff finish. Wish he had been a little quicker on the gun last night too.:( Hope he comes back next year, though I think he should be shifting to a bench role, he could be a great 20 mpg player for another year or two."

washingtonwizards,365z0z,Wizpurs,6,Sat May 16 13:53:44 2015 UTC,I'd rather lock up Beal and Otto than ransom our future holding out for kd
washingtonwizards,365z0z,extraneouspanthers,3,Sat May 16 16:58:15 2015 UTC,The salary cap is expected to positively explode due to the new TV deal. Otto probably isn't a max contract guy. It can definitely work.
washingtonwizards,365z0z,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,2,Sat May 16 15:55:28 2015 UTC,"I personally don't think we grew much at all. Here is why:  1) Nene was dominate last post season against the Bulls etc and was garbage this series and playoff run. 2) Beal showed some great desire and made huge shots but he did that and better last playoffs against Indiana and Chicago.  Otto came alive and that was great to witness for the future. What I am worried about this off season is the bench and more importantly the BIGS.  An unrealistic, give or take, Aldridge would be ideal for our team. Both Nene and Gortat couldn't hit a shot and that is what killed us. Atlanta had Hordford and Milsap knocking in 2 points all day.   If we are going to compete next year and in the future, then I think getting some scoring big men in is needed. Nene is just a tad old but what a player he was. As for Durant, we can make it happen but I would rather have a deep team like Atlanta. To bad we sold Clarkson away to the Lakers. He would of been perfect behind Wall and Beal."
washingtonwizards,365z0z,wonderLanddd,1 point,Sat May 16 17:17:47 2015 UTC,"As great of a player KD is, I'd rather go for a more balanced build to our team and believe that Otto can be the future for us in the SF position. More attention should be given to a PF that can spot up and play defense, a spark plug off the bench, and a better coach."

His impact in the locker room has to be appreciated.   If he is willing to come off the bench for a reasonable contract when his current deal expires, I think we should keep Nene just for the influence he has had on our team."
washingtonwizards,364hi4,DWood10,1 point,Sat May 16 12:20:58 2015 UTC,Yeah he has had a huge impact on the team. He changed our locker room & made Wall into the leader he is today.

washingtonwizards,364hi4,KickedInTheDonuts,4,Sat May 16 01:41:11 2015 UTC,You should be really proud. I think the future is very bright for you guys. Wall-Beal will be amazing for years to come.
washingtonwizards,364hi4,DandsomeHanSolol,17,Sat May 16 01:49:04 2015 UTC,Can someone please tell me why the fuck Kris Humphries got ZERO play time over Nene!??!!?
washingtonwizards,364hi4,heat,1 point,Sat May 16 01:58:37 2015 UTC,"really, really don't know"
washingtonwizards,364hi4,srmc11,1 point,Sat May 16 01:43:08 2015 UTC,"He's a monster rebounder, but his defense was pretty average. Plus that foul line 2 he's automatic from dried up for him towards the end of the regular season. I agree with you though, the fact that he got almost 0 minutes (I think I saw him during junk time against Toronto) was pretty shocking."
washingtonwizards,364hi4,nofattys,1 point,Sat May 16 13:16:38 2015 UTC,Seriously he was a monster on the boards whenever I got a chance to see him play
washingtonwizards,364hi4,MagicJab,14,Sun May 17 03:10:34 2015 UTC,We watched Beal go from good to all star. Wall went from all star to all NBA. Honestly I think we're a head coach and a better PF away from the finals.  But I'll remember this team for a while. This was a fun team.
washingtonwizards,364hi4,extraneouspanthers,2,Sat May 16 01:59:18 2015 UTC,Who do you think is gone?
washingtonwizards,364hi4,Obersts001,5,Sat May 16 01:46:53 2015 UTC,"Gooden retires Seraphin walks as a FA Butler, Bynum not renewed    Other than Pierce's player option, that's it. Everyone else is back barring trades."
washingtonwizards,364hi4,EthelredTheUnsteady,2,Sat May 16 02:13:40 2015 UTC,temple has player option as well.
washingtonwizards,364hi4,Obersts001,1 point,Sat May 16 03:08:00 2015 UTC,Saw that but do we think he'd even consider opting out? Who's going to give him a better deal? Seems really unlikely.
washingtonwizards,364hi4,EthelredTheUnsteady,1 point,Sat May 16 03:58:43 2015 UTC,oh hes gonna exercise that option. hes gonna be back and frankly im cool with that. just sayin.
washingtonwizards,364hi4,jrb1851,2,Sat May 16 10:40:55 2015 UTC,Seraphin's out. :/
washingtonwizards,364hi4,Obersts001,5,Sat May 16 15:24:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'd assume that; someone is going to pay him way more than the Wiz will offer, given that we're still $48m committed to Gortat. Best of luck to him."
washingtonwizards,364hi4,jrb1851,1 point,Sat May 16 14:04:03 2015 UTC,"I hope he picks somewhere that'll start him. If he keeps playing like he did last night, he'll be golden."
washingtonwizards,364hi4,MagicJab,0,Sat May 16 14:05:44 2015 UTC,"I hope I'm wrong but I don't know if Pierce is coming back. He made some big shots but it was pretty obvious that he lost a step. It wouldn't surprise me to lose Nene, Gooden, or maybe even Gortat. I'm not saying they're irreplaceable, but this particular team just had something for me."
washingtonwizards,364hi4,guga31bb,6,Sat May 16 14:08:50 2015 UTC,"lol this is so ignorant. Nene and Gortat are on long term deals - we aren't going to just ""lose"" them"
washingtonwizards,364hi4,MagicJab,1 point,Sat May 16 02:18:19 2015 UTC,"We could ""trade"" them. Or even release them even if it did cost us money. Nene is constantly injured and has considered retirement. You think we will have the exact same roster next year?"
washingtonwizards,364hi4,guga31bb,3,Sat May 16 02:43:30 2015 UTC,"You think we will have the exact same roster next year?   No, but I guarantee you Gortat and Nene will still be there."
washingtonwizards,364hi4,Boymankid,4,Sat May 16 02:53:56 2015 UTC,"Nene's an expiring though. I guarantee Gortat but Nene is potentially a piece to move. I'm not joinin on the hate for him, like I've said before I love what he's brought the past few years, but the Wizards would be smart to dangle him and see if we can find a good trade"
washingtonwizards,364hi4,Obersts001,1 point,Sat May 16 02:57:07 2015 UTC,Who would take him and why? Nene is the sort of trade asset who is a negative at this stage in his career -- we'd need to take something else just as bad to make the equivalent salaries work.
washingtonwizards,364hi4,Boymankid,2,Sat May 16 05:06:17 2015 UTC,I would have to think about that more but just remember that the corpse of KG got traded twice in 3 years
washingtonwizards,364hi4,Obersts001,2,Sat May 16 14:23:03 2015 UTC,"Nene is more likely to be back than Gortat, but that's only because Gortat has more trade value. If the Kings decide that they need to move Boogie, for example, we could offer Gortat + Porter + some draft pick package."

washingtonwizards,364hi4,Virulentt,7,Sat May 16 02:05:34 2015 UTC,People talking about how great Otto has been of the playoffs... We know dat. He been good. Let's talk about Brad. He ain't got enough attention for his performance this series. Dude went off
washingtonwizards,364hi4,Boymankid,4,Sat May 16 01:39:35 2015 UTC,"All Star starter with John next year, book it"
washingtonwizards,364hi4,Obersts001,3,Sat May 16 03:34:14 2015 UTC,I'd love this just to hear Kyrie whine about it for three weeks before the game.
washingtonwizards,364hi4,Shaidester,1 point,Sat May 16 05:09:28 2015 UTC,He held Korver to Nene-tier performances in every game. This guy is going to be a beast. We have a solid core right now in Washington. Next year ECF without a doubt.
washingtonwizards,364hi4,6-1-2,12,Sat May 16 14:25:15 2015 UTC,"Never been in here before but have to say.  John Wall is probably my favorite player. The heart, determination, motor, and passion he plays with is few and far between.  I wish that basket would've counted and the Wiz went on to win. Game 7 would've been a nightmare for ATL."

washingtonwizards,364hi4,peterkimmm,10,Sat May 16 01:48:11 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm still happy we even made this far, it was one hella of a roller-coaster ride this season.           I hope: - Pierce plays here til he retires - Otto continues to develop and play plenty of minutes even in regular season - We somehow get rid of Nene and his 13 mill contract - Somehow magically land LMA and have him play for us         But I've gotta say, I'm glad to be a Wizards fan right now. Pretty damn excited for the future to come: Wall, Beal, and Otto :')"

washingtonwizards,364hi4,Boymankid,2,Sat May 16 02:12:33 2015 UTC,"Ravens won the Bowl a couple years ago, so you have that tho :)"
washingtonwizards,364hi4,Grimpig,6,Sat May 16 02:33:35 2015 UTC,"I'm surprisingly not too upset. That was a shitty end the season but it isn't like the Wizards are blowing a title window. Wall, Beal and Otto are all still young and will be amazing for years. Beal is 21. 21! They are still one big free agent away from a title. If we blow series' at that point then I will be upset  . Nene has had a good run here but he should move on. I'm excited for next season. Here's to finally breaking 50 wins."

washingtonwizards,364hi4,thegreystash,3,Sat May 16 01:53:02 2015 UTC,"So sorry you guys, what a shot."
washingtonwizards,364hi4,Knyfe-Wrench,3,Sat May 16 01:39:36 2015 UTC,Awwwwwww come on!
washingtonwizards,364hi4,Chafed_HotDog,3,Sat May 16 01:37:37 2015 UTC,Why does this always happen to us. In the worst ways. At least Cleveland knows they won't compete (not recently but before this pat year) but DC always comes so fucking close and gets shot down to earth. RG3 with the playoff game. Up 14-0 in the first quarter. And he tears his acl and we lose the game. The nats always losing in the final game in the final inning of the playoffs. The caps game 7. And tonight. We lose on a basket that doesn't count. WHY DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING.
washingtonwizards,364hi4,Wizpurs,3,Sat May 16 01:38:22 2015 UTC,"It really hurts knowing that it always goes down like that! Especially with the RG3 injury, that season I felt like they could have gone pretty far. The Wizards this season had the same chance to make it at least a series if not win against the Cavs. Oh well...."
washingtonwizards,364hi4,MegaSupremeTaco,3,Sat May 16 02:48:56 2015 UTC,The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world Otto was a bust. Thank God he emerged.  Great post season (regular season almost had me rip my hair out lol). On to the draft for me since I stop caring about the playoffs when we aren't in it any more. I really want Bobby Portis for this team.  Also sad to see Nene go down like this. Really helped change the culture around here but injuries+age are an unbeaten backcourt.
washingtonwizards,364hi4,migosversace121,8,Sat May 16 14:20:12 2015 UTC,"My hope next year, beyond the Wizards success, is for DC to actually start giving a shit about this team. It's borderline depressing when it come into work and half the people sitting around me don't even realize the Wizards are in the playoffs. All they care about is their precious fucking Caps. I hate it. I wish this town would legitimately care the same way Atlanta embraced the Hawks this year or how Chicago embraces the Bulls."
washingtonwizards,364hi4,yaboymattyk,5,Sat May 16 01:44:17 2015 UTC,Verizon center was the loudest I've seen tonight in all the games i've been to. It will get better

With some personnel adjustments, some fire in their belly, I can see the Wizards as a true contender for it all.   I was a Paul Pierce hater at the beginning of the season, but as Wizards fan I'd like to thank him for all he's done for us in these playoffs and bringing a winning attitude to DC. Wall, Beal, Porter... it's up to those guys now."

washingtonwizards,364hi4,Big-Mistake,1 point,Sat May 16 02:17:22 2015 UTC,"He needs to go. He did a horrible job this series in my opinion. Tonight's coaching was beyond terrible - some of the worst end game execution I've seen recently.  I said this in the post-game thread on /r/nba, but this is a hugely important year for the franchise. We need to go all out to be in the best position to land Durant in a year that we can. We need a fresh up and coming coach that can install an effective offensive system. Wittman has taken this team as far as he can and it is time to move on."

Not happy about it but honestly, these playoffs were a bright spot and who knows, maybe next season we can improve on them and have a better regular season where we finish in the top 3. Either way Randy is here to stay and Wizards fans should get their optimism caps on or 2016 is going to be a lonnnnngggg season."

washingtonwizards,364hi4,mmzznnxx,1 point,Sat May 16 06:00:23 2015 UTC,"I usually hate these comments, but I have to say, I'm pretty pissed at all the ""Fuck Nene"" comments that have been going on in all the threads.  Nene sucked most of these games of this series, but I never once doubted his effort. Wall sucked in the Chicago series last year, but no one gave shit to him. I get he's the best player on the team, but it's not fair to give as much shit to people you don't expect to contribute equally.  Gortat has been an absoute mop spill this series, but not many people have been saying ""Fuck Gortat"", despite him being paid a shit ton more and a Wizards fixture for years to come, thanks to Grunfeld. Pierce was the worst player on the court in game 6. Gooden's been terrible for a few games now and gotten minutes for God knows why.   Really disappointed in the team and how they came out tonight, as well as how the fans in game threads have talked about the team and the players. No consistency to speak of."
washingtonwizards,364hi4,Shaidester,1 point,Sat May 16 06:39:50 2015 UTC,"Wall has improved significantly though since last year. He's much more consistent and his midrange is getting there. Nene on the other hand has done nothing but regressed in performance. Yes, he was a beast in the Chicago series and made Horford's midrange look like a joke, but it's all about consistency..."
washingtonwizards,364hi4,phalanx76,1 point,Sat May 16 06:47:14 2015 UTC,"It's been a fun series and a fun season. Even though it would have been nice to play Cleveland, I can't say I'm too disappointed. We pushed the no.1 seed and a 60-win team to six games, half of which Wall didn't even play.   Proud of this team. The future is bright."

But regardless I'm glad we have this team with our young trio of stars, so much potential with them. I haven't had this much fun watching this team since Agent Zero before that knee injury in 07. I'm looking forward to watching this team rise even further next year. Proud!!!  PS: I doubted Paul Pierce throughout the season but man the Playoffs made me feel like a dumbass for having ever doubted ""The Truth"". Hopefully he comes back."

washingtonwizards,364hi4,srmc11,1 point,Sat May 16 02:09:58 2015 UTC,"Sport's memory is short. People forget about those terrible regular season losses (the fucking 76ers) where our offense looked abysmal. He also got out coached pretty hard by Budenholzer the last 3 games, but there honestly really wasn't much he could do with our front court playing the way they did. That said, he deserves to stay, but I really hope they go out and hire a great offensive mind as an assistant for him. That lineup with Wall, Beal, Porter, Pierce, and Gortat was really effective on the offensive end, and it would be nice to have an offensive mind to coach up that sort of lineup."

washingtonwizards,362wf5,cwolfe,4,Fri May 15 19:41:08 2015 UTC,No offense guys but can any team with Paul Pierce on it complain about shit said on the court? Wall is a tough SOB who knew very well he was going to take shots when he went on the court. He said as much and wanted to be confident he could take them.

washingtonwizards,362wf5,srmc11,-4,Sat May 16 01:45:28 2015 UTC,Slapping someone's broken hand in a non basketball play in order to aggravate an injury is a dick move. Not comparable to trash talk but ok.
washingtonwizards,362wf5,tabelz,7,Sat May 16 01:48:04 2015 UTC,"Bullshit. Every coach tells their players to test a guy when he is injured. No one did anything to Wall but if saying it might make him think twice about then it is gonna get said. Especially by Pierce. He career is full of that shit. Truth is he was bugged because a two year guy said it, not because it was said. It was disrespect that bugged him, not dirty play and he said as much. I agree Shroder should stfu but it ain't dirty it's stupid."

washingtonwizards,362wf5,Capn_max,-23,Fri May 15 18:37:23 2015 UTC,Wtf does that have to do with anything. Atlanta is a transplant city and if you actually watch the games you would have seen how loud Philips was.

washingtonwizards,362wf5,threeguee,5,Fri May 15 19:17:56 2015 UTC,It's a troll account
washingtonwizards,362wf5,ohhwurd,-10,Fri May 15 19:23:00 2015 UTC,Stop making half assed arguments that have nothing to do with what I'm discussing. The Hawks don't have the best attendance but it's been increasing and I'm proud of the crowd at Philips the other night. In the end I'll take the win and my team over yours.

I want him here to mentor Otto and turn him into the third pillar of this team that he showed he can be in this post-season.   But regardless, this will be an interesting off-season. If he decides to retire, then OK.  But if he decides to sign with any other team (except the C's), then Ted really needs to find out why."

At least Cleveland knows they won't compete (not recently but before this pat year) but DC always comes so fucking close and gets shot down to earth.   RG3 with the playoff game. Up 14-0 in the first quarter. And he tears his acl and we lose the game.   The nats always losing in the final game in the final inning of the playoffs.   The caps game 7.  And tonight.

washingtonwizards,3641bl,Boymankid,0,Sat May 16 00:49:11 2015 UTC,Korver must've gone to the Chris Paul school of flopping
washingtonwizards,3641bl,Boymankid,2,Sat May 16 00:55:06 2015 UTC,We sort of did when Nene didn't box out Horford in game 5. But we're not dead yet
washingtonwizards,3641bl,nicknamebucky,-5,Sat May 16 01:27:17 2015 UTC,Demarre Carroll sounds like a troll.
washingtonwizards,364eu1,kimbooo,4,Sat May 16 01:04:31 2015 UTC,WOW NENE IS LITERALLY THE WORST
washingtonwizards,364eu1,lverson,2,Sat May 16 01:26:43 2015 UTC,I'm afraid I might make an attempt on Gooden's life the next time I visit my uncle in DC.
washingtonwizards,364eu1,TouchTheSky420,2,Sat May 16 01:39:03 2015 UTC,Also gortat didn't play a single fucking minute the second half?
washingtonwizards,364eu1,guga31bb,3,Sat May 16 01:46:26 2015 UTC,He was sick
washingtonwizards,364jb2,Zelazong,5,Sat May 16 01:51:54 2015 UTC,No. Have him come off the bench. He said he wants to retire when his contract ends
washingtonwizards,364jb2,Gr8WallofChinatown,12,Sat May 16 02:13:39 2015 UTC,"I'm sick of Wiz fans posting ""Fuck Nene"" in /r/NBA as stupid upvote bait. Fucking circlejerk bullshit. He had 11 rebounds in 26 minutes. He's not the player he used to be, and he's dealing with chronic injuries, but piss off with this rubbish. Everyone's just forgotten the huge impact he's had on this team, and it sucks  Edit: /u/smilezandsouthstar and /u/boymankid both made good comments about it in the last Nene thread. Go read those.  He's not as effective as he was, but he can still contribute, and he deserves more respect then he's getting from Wiz fans for being part of the turnaround that made this franchise somewhat respectable.   Sorry for the rant, but it gives me the shits. Have some respect."
washingtonwizards,364jb2,nihilistcommunist,8,Sat May 16 01:56:04 2015 UTC,"The venom of the criticism really kills me.  If you're disappointed in Nene, fine, so am I. But acting like he did nothing good (it helps if you don't just watch the ball and the box score) and using other fans' catchphrase to shit on him? Fuck outta here with that. Nene changed this franchise's culture. Might not mean much to a bunch of spoiled-ass goldfish-memory late arrivals who couldn't name the starting 5 before the Lakers fell off and they decided to pay attention to the local team but it matters."
washingtonwizards,364jb2,smilezandsouthstar,7,Sat May 16 03:28:28 2015 UTC,I rather have had Seraphin out there with his 13 points than Nene with his 11 rebounds. The dude totally crippled this team.
washingtonwizards,364jb2,ireddit270,5,Sat May 16 01:59:14 2015 UTC,"Nene is not a player you want to have on your team, for multiple reasons. Even in his peak with the Wiz he was never worth his salary and is injury-prone.   He's brought some good moments but overall never been a huge fan, and he'll only be a Wiz for one more season (at best, maybe they move his expiring by the deadline)"
washingtonwizards,364jb2,nihilistcommunist,2,Sat May 16 02:27:27 2015 UTC,"I understand your position, but I can't help but feel like its hyperbole to say that there's no reason for him on the team.  He's a terrific passer, a solid post defender, has been a good leader for the team and fits in/has good chemistry with wall and beal. As much as bulls fans think he's dirty, he's really not that dirty, and he doesn't have an attitude problem.  He's definitely overpaid, but half the big men in the league are"
washingtonwizards,364jb2,ireddit270,1 point,Sat May 16 02:49:18 2015 UTC,"He's not a terrific passer, he averages more TOs than assists.  He has great passing 'ability' yes, just like he has great low post scoring ""ability"".. but as has been the story with Nene his whole career, his ability does not match his production over the long run.  I don't really think he has good chemistry with Wall/Beal either. In fact I've heard Nene call them out publicly multiple times, and reportedly there was an altercation early last year between Nene and Beal. So I don't know where you make that assumption. I can tell Wall and Beal like Gortat, I've never got the vibe that Nene is a beloved teammate."
washingtonwizards,364jb2,nihilistcommunist,3,Sat May 16 02:59:27 2015 UTC,"That's the problem with basing your opinion on stats, they don't necessarily reflect reality.  I meant chemistry on the court. Nene has been effective on the p&r, and has been great with post handoffs to beal.   He doesn't have to be beloved. Nene should be able to call out his teammates if need be, just as they should be able to call out him. Nene is a 32 year old Brazilian father, it's unrealistic to expect him to be best friends with guys like Beal and Wall."
washingtonwizards,364jb2,ireddit270,1 point,Sat May 16 03:12:16 2015 UTC,"Nene is not good on the PnR, he misses a lot at the rim or settles for broken jumpers.   There was a SportsVu stat, Wall and Gortat as a duo have great PnR efficiency but with Nene as a roll man the PPP was way below league average . That's why when you look at Wall's PnR efficiency numbers on the season, the stats aren't that good relative to his actual on-court ability. He's excellent with Gortat but the sets with Nene brings his PnR efficiency down.   The Beal handoffs imo often take too long to run because Nene isn't decisive. I don't think those plays produced a high ppp if you go back and look at the stats  I don't want to make this too much about Nene's personality, but strictly looking at his production he is subpar and drags the team down."
washingtonwizards,364jb2,wafflestoompa,3,Sat May 16 04:10:40 2015 UTC,"He fucked the team and Its as simple as that. Are you saying I should feel sorry for him because of his chronic injuries? Sports is all about what have you done for me lately and he he keeps fucking up. He needs to be replaced. Cool, he was good at basketball in previous seasons but he is fucking clown shoes now. I just paid good money to watch him fuck us 3 times in the last 3 minutes of that basketball game."
washingtonwizards,364jb2,nihilistcommunist,6,Sat May 16 02:19:02 2015 UTC,"Guess we should have traded gortat when he was in his slump. Guess we should have cut Paul when he couldn't make a shot. It's not about feeling sorry, it's about not making stupid knee jerk reactions. It's about at least trying to support your players. It'd be different if he wasn't trying, like Javale/Blatche/Nick Young, but he was trying. He had a bad series, but he can still contribute."
washingtonwizards,364jb2,wafflestoompa,0,Sat May 16 02:29:15 2015 UTC,"Ok, so I should be saying at least he is trying when he plays 2/3 of the season and can't box out his assignment because his knees don't support him anymore in 2016? I don't see where you are going with this. He has his awesome moments, but he shouldn't be a starter in the NBA anymore. His body just can't handle it."
washingtonwizards,364jb2,nihilistcommunist,3,Sat May 16 02:38:36 2015 UTC,"Except his boxing out still isn't the problem. If he plays as badly as this series next season, then yes, his minutes will be reduced. He was the biggest reason we won game 3 IMO.   He gave up the rebound to horford, and that was bad, but that doesn't mean he can't contribute next season, even in a bench role."
washingtonwizards,364jb2,fagetsaget,1 point,Sat May 16 02:54:59 2015 UTC,"I don't have a problem with Nene but I think he should come off the bench. Also, why have I not seen Humphries in 50 years? Is he injured or is Wittman just not playing him?"

From his shitty defense trying to guard a point guard at the top of the key all the way to his body language was just awful. Fuck respect. If you aren't giving it 110% in an elimination game you don't deserve respect. He helped the Wiz out a lot changing the culture, but it's time for us to move on when theres bigger and better players out there to get."
washingtonwizards,364jb2,redditrevolution,2,Sat May 16 04:35:24 2015 UTC,Whitman should have taken him out.
washingtonwizards,364jb2,alt_hypertext,1 point,Sat May 16 02:07:51 2015 UTC,"Not a Wiz fan but why the fuck was he in the game?!!  Could not believe it, he's a good player no doubt, and he got you to that point, but the last 2 minutes he lost the game because he's so god damn slow switching off picks and gave up two WIDE open layups in the last 2 minutes, and took forever to run down and intentionally foul Horford. That one second difference sends the game to OT and the defense wins the game outright.   Not his fault, he's huge and obviously isn't very quick, he should have been taken out"
washingtonwizards,364jb2,redditrevolution,2,Sat May 16 02:35:37 2015 UTC,I counted 3 possessions in a row before his 2 missed free throws where we didn't score because of him.

washingtonwizards,3627yi,leo2k2ndc,3,Fri May 15 14:03:43 2015 UTC,"The suite includes like 8 or 10 seats split up in 2 rows outside the suite, they are like regular seats. Inside the suite is a countertop and some barstools there. I assume that's what they are selling and if you sit there you'll be watching it on tv"
washingtonwizards,3627yi,noitstoolate,2,Fri May 15 14:19:54 2015 UTC,"Do they give any other details like a section or row #? Barstool seating could be in an actual suite or it could be the first two rows of the Acela Club, which have a floor view but you'll be required / expected to buy food while you're there.  If you're willing to shell out good money for seats, there are still a few lower and club level seats together available on Ticketmaster for $150-200 per seat (look at sections 108, 114 and 216, for example).

washingtonwizards,3627yi,Obersts001,2,Fri May 15 15:48:38 2015 UTC,It didn't say a row and that why it scares me a little. It does have a seat # associated with them though.

washingtonwizards,361v8v,ESPNnut,10,Fri May 15 11:58:00 2015 UTC,He really didn't play much during the regular season. He didn't really start to join the rotation in March http://www.rotoworld.com/log/nba/851/drew-gooden
washingtonwizards,361v8v,TophMasterFlex,4,Fri May 15 12:07:50 2015 UTC,Thanks!
washingtonwizards,361v8v,Kirbybajerby,7,Fri May 15 12:19:23 2015 UTC,His scoring during the regular season was more like nonexistant. Mostly because Kris Humphries was getting all the minutes as backup PF.
washingtonwizards,361v8v,Brim4889,1 point,Fri May 15 12:06:08 2015 UTC,So what's the basis for Humphries sitting now?
washingtonwizards,361v8v,rudderrudder,4,Fri May 15 12:19:13 2015 UTC,"He hurt his leg late in the season which opened the door for Gooden to get more playing time. I would guess that Wittman is keeping Gooden in the rotation because he trusts him and he shoots decently enough that teams have to semi-guard him when he's out at the 3 point line. You could make a good argument for Humphries to take minutes from Gooden or NeNe though since he has a very good mid range game and is willing to fight in the paint for rebounds, the 1st helping to space the floor for better drives and the 2nd a massive liability that killed us last game"
washingtonwizards,361v8v,ireddit270,3,Fri May 15 14:24:34 2015 UTC,This is our chicken and egg - Does Wittman mess with rotations so much because players are inconsistent or are players inconsistent because Randy messes with the rotations so much.
washingtonwizards,361v8v,ignoramis,3,Fri May 15 14:04:43 2015 UTC,"People harp on Wittman and ignore the bigger problem that has existed for 10 years, and his initials are EG. Why is Ernie Grunfeld relying so much on 30+ year old vets to have random career seasons? Why hasn't Grunfeld acquired a YOUNGER version of Gooden who can actually grow with our core as a stretch PF  A guy like Nene has been inconsistent for his whole career, it's not Wittman's fault that there isn't really another multi-tool PF/C on this team who could take his minutes. If there was I'm sure Wittman would be playing him over Nene/Gooden/Seraphin etc and I'm sure we'd be a better team"
washingtonwizards,361v8v,TophMasterFlex,2,Fri May 15 15:24:03 2015 UTC,Gooden brings more to the table. He now has developed a nice 3 point shot which stretches the floor and gives the guards more room to operate in the paint
washingtonwizards,361v8v,hokeywebb22,3,Fri May 15 12:35:08 2015 UTC,"idk if he brings more to the table, he deff. fits better in the stretch 4 that Wittman has been running."
washingtonwizards,361v8v,VoidDroid,1 point,Fri May 15 12:35:51 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that, although sometimes he seems like he hangs around the three point line too much. On games that he can work the line and roll off of picks well, he's great. But other times it seems like he sticks up there even when he might be more effective flooding the paint."
washingtonwizards,361v8v,Gr8WallofChinatown,1 point,Fri May 15 12:44:07 2015 UTC,Thats my argument for Humphries.  No one is in the paint working for rebounds.
washingtonwizards,361v8v,ireddit270,2,Fri May 15 12:57:00 2015 UTC,Humphries doesn't really provide anything other than his rebounding.  While Gooden can be inconsistent he is viewed as a energy guy at this point. He always hustles and looks to make plays for his team. He can hit the three as well. He spreads the floor out and punishes double teams.  I think a lot of the team looks up to him as well. Just a great glue guy for the team.
washingtonwizards,361v8v,Mehberry,2,Fri May 15 15:36:48 2015 UTC,He has a solid mid range jumper. Is defense is a lot better than Gooden's. Not to mention Humphries has been in the gym working on his 3pt shot so I want to see if he can shoot threes. He was deadly at the long 2.
washingtonwizards,361v8v,Brim4889,6,Fri May 15 16:22:44 2015 UTC,"What happened is that Humphries (a more solid, reliable overall player imo) was balling, but got hurt during the season. Gooden started to play a bit more, and as the Wiz rested Nene down the stretch he even got some starts at PF. Gooden was basically raining threes for a solid couple months through the Raps series, on this team that kind of floor spacing was a sight for sore eyes.   But ultimately Gooden is a novelty player at this stage in his career. At some point he was going to run out of gas. He's not someone you should count on to have an impact, but if he does then great."
washingtonwizards,361v8v,Yeti60,3,Fri May 15 15:18:36 2015 UTC,"Inconsistent is a good word. If he's good, he gets a lot of hustle tap out rebounds and tap-in putbacks, and stretches the floor with 3's and jumpers.  If he's bad? Lazy, bricked jumpers with minimal rebounding.  Both scenarios have bad defense."
washingtonwizards,361v8v,peterkimmm,1 point,Fri May 15 14:01:35 2015 UTC,"He's like NeNe light in terms of consistency in that he'll either be a pleasant surprise or kind of disappointing in any given quarter, much less game"

washingtonwizards,35yzy7,_masterofdisaster,-3,Thu May 14 18:37:47 2015 UTC,"Uh, being a part of a gang definitely goes beyond just being immature."
washingtonwizards,35yzy7,BagelsAndJewce,8,Thu May 14 21:55:32 2015 UTC,That's the perspective of the outside looking. It's not all bad and sometimes you it's just home or family. Clearly Wall hasn't done anything to jeopardize his career.   I won't judge on any gang affiliation just because I know where they come from and why some of them do it. It ain't easy living in the worst conditions with drugs and violence all around you. You do what you have to to make something of yourself.  I'll judge them on what they do. Not who they're affiliated with. If he goes out and robs a store or causes some shit at a club well then by all means tear him a new one. But just because he has friends or family or maybe even just acquaintances there doesn't mean he's in the wrong.
washingtonwizards,35yzy7,jknox94,1 point,Thu May 14 23:52:36 2015 UTC,"Says the guy with the Gilbert Arenas tag. Haha, but you're right, I just don't think it's a big deal. In fact, I think we've known that about Wall for a while, and he's obviously done it before. Maybe I'm blind cuz I like Wall so much."
washingtonwizards,35yzy7,_masterofdisaster,1 point,Thu May 14 22:37:16 2015 UTC,"I love Wall and I really love Arenas, but I know and understand they have sketchy backgrounds in shady areas. I would definitely lose respect for anyone who was definitively in a part of a gang, but unless they've committed crimes I can forgive that part of them."
washingtonwizards,35yzy7,BagelsAndJewce,3,Thu May 14 22:47:57 2015 UTC,"It doesn't bother me because I don't even know what being in a gang means or implies. But I am surprised that he does this so openly, because it seems like society as a whole looks down on it."
washingtonwizards,35yzy7,pankpankpank,5,Thu May 14 23:18:34 2015 UTC,They do look down but society as a whole doesn't understand the life some people live. It's either fight or die out there in some areas and these dudes who make it big they give hope to others. I won't condemn anyone on any sort of affiliation. It could just be he grew up with it his whole life. If you're surrounded by that since birth do you really think you'll toss it away once you've made it big and you can give back to your community.   Sometimes affiliation is all that is it doesn't mean he goes out and does stupid shit. It's part of his identity. I'll judge as I said in an earlier comment on the actions not the affiliations.
washingtonwizards,35yzy7,jknox94,5,Thu May 14 23:55:42 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of players that openly throw up their sets: JR Smith Paul Pierce Tony Allen Nick Young Jason Terry James Harden  ZBo, Carmelo Anthony, etc....there are a lot more players that throw up sets occasionally a lot more often than you think.

I was going through a really rough time at this point last year (got rejected after a bunch of job interviews with college graduation coming up), and I was watching my sports teams to try to escape my stressful situation, and it didn't work. The Mavs get demolished game 7 and the Stars lost out to the Ducks within a week of each other.   One thing I realized is that when shit piles on, it's best to focus on the stressors in life that you have the most control over. In your case, it sounds like the stressors you have the most control over is coming up with an plan for the future to keep on your major and do what you want to do in life, along with checking on your friend. I would forget about the things you don't have control over (I.E sports, this series) and keep focused on the things you do (Being there for your friend, working out a long term academic solution). Eventually the things you can have an impact on turn themselves around.    You'll get through this man, and if you need someone to talk to, feel free to PM me"

washingtonwizards,35zx2h,ireddit270,-1,Fri May 15 18:35:24 2015 UTC,"KD could mess us our entire offense, him with Beal and Wall, I mean John is primarily a ball handler with a decent jumper and 3, and Beal would basically turn into a catch and shoot man. With Aldridge we get a starter at the only position we honestly need one at, as well as a spacer. Wall acts as primary ball handler, Beal gets even more open shots due to the spacing, Gort has less work to do because LMA can rebound, and Porter can develop."

washingtonwizards,360nln,Kirbybajerby,2,Fri May 15 11:22:02 2015 UTC,It's a knockoff. Couldn't find the real version of that so I went rogue.
washingtonwizards,360nln,Mehberry,2,Fri May 15 13:18:16 2015 UTC,He played better with Wall back in the lineup. He's not beasting like he was against Toronto though because of Horford
washingtonwizards,35ymz8,Buttslaya,11,Thu May 14 16:38:40 2015 UTC,One of the strongest players in the game but he's lost a lot of athleticism. Good defender but gets caught flat footed more and more. Not a paint protector. Sets monster screens but not a great roll man. Very good passer. Boxes out instead of pursuing rebounds. Not a very good shooter. Bad habit of veering into help defense when making his move on the block. His chronic injuries -- he contemplated retiring a couple of years ago -- have lead him to go through the motions during regular seasons. Overpaid. Definitely in the decline phase of his career.  Last night was Paul Pierce's fault imo but I can't deny that Nene came up soft in the end. Nene is one of my personal favorites and I can't help but think a lot of his detractors watch the ball and box score and not him because he still does a lot of very valuable things. He's not Kendrick Perkins or David Lee. But the modern NBA is what it is and that makes his fit increasingly untenable on this team. He might need to go and I'm pretty bummed about it.
washingtonwizards,35ymz8,smilezandsouthstar,3,Thu May 14 18:08:43 2015 UTC,Maybe somehow we could go for LMA

washingtonwizards,35ymz8,isestrex,4,Thu May 14 17:49:39 2015 UTC,"He lost a step on both ends.  But he was key in promoting a winning culture here. We traded McGee for Nene, which was the last of the knucklehead Wizards. Getting Nene here meant that we were going to commit to winning ball games and building around John Wall, and it was so much better than the Baltche, McGee, Young combination.  Regardless of how his time here ends, Nene deserves a lot of gratitude for what he helped build here in DC."
washingtonwizards,35ymz8,kamikazemelonman,2,Fri May 15 00:17:31 2015 UTC,"I love watching him play, but I'll be glad when he's finally gone. With a $13M expiring next year, I look forward to another highway robbery trade by Ernie... perhaps as early as this offseason."
washingtonwizards,35ymz8,SlobBarker,1 point,Thu May 14 21:30:43 2015 UTC,"He hasn't been prime in the playoffs this year, but did well in game 1 of the raptors series, and killed it in the postseason last year, as he dominated a front line of Noah and Gibson on the glass as well as inside the paint. That domination let Brad and John advance and get the experience that is helping them to grow and play well this year, as they were mostly subpar last postseason.  John has also said the biggest jump in his game was when Nene took him aside last year and told him it was his team, he needs to lead from the front, ect. Honestly, he gets too much hate for playing against the other teams best players (Millsap and Horford). I think he plays out his contract and gets signed to a contender that REALLY needs a strong backup big, like the Clippers."

washingtonwizards,35wjlg,alwaysthinkandplanah,3,Thu May 14 03:03:17 2015 UTC,Can someone explain why randy took out gortat for nene for that defensive last play? What did he do to get on the floor? Fucking nothing. This falls on randy and then nene. Fuck man we had a stop but nene fucked the rebound
washingtonwizards,35wjlg,iceberg7,6,Thu May 14 03:58:09 2015 UTC,I don't think we can blame Randy on this one. Nene can and has stopped Al before. Nene fucked up but we shouldn't have been that close to begin with.   a;lskdjfas FUCK

washingtonwizards,35wjlg,ircdub,16,Thu May 14 02:39:40 2015 UTC,JUMP FOR THE FUCKING REBOUND YOU PIECE OF SHIT MOTHERFUCKER. AND FUCK RANDY FOR TAKING GORTAT OUT. GOD FUCKING DAMNIT.
washingtonwizards,35wjlg,iceberg7,2,Thu May 14 02:50:09 2015 UTC,No Randy blame on this one. Nene could actually stop Horford jumpers which had been money all night. You'd be equally as pissed if that had been the game winner
washingtonwizards,35wjlg,extraneouspanthers,8,Thu May 14 03:26:35 2015 UTC,"The only reason PP is played at the 4 is to stretch offensively. If you have one last defensive possession, why are Nene and Marcin both not on the floor?"

Wall played well, but Nene managed to mess it up. I guess this is gonna be a seven game series then. On to the Caps game."

washingtonwizards,35wjlg,Mehberry,2,Thu May 14 02:39:54 2015 UTC,"Man, Gooden has been clutch pretty much all playoffs before last 2 games. I can't even really blame him either, cause like a smart coach Wittman stopped playing him second half, which is what he should of done with Nene (game 3) and Gortat (game 4), and maybe we wouldn't be in this hole.  edit: unfinished thought"

washingtonwizards,35wjlg,foghornbutthorn,9,Thu May 14 03:01:26 2015 UTC,Dude rushed back from 5 fucking fractures in his hand and Nene can't even play with a little bit of effort. I don't get overly mad over the Wizards (not even at regular season Wittman) but this just really pisses me off

washingtonwizards,35wjlg,glenglenglenglen,2,Thu May 14 08:26:25 2015 UTC,Me neither. I had to google and see if he had ever done that before. He did it at least once at UK and in a celtics game in 2011.  He definitely is yelling Big B's so yeah he's throwback bangin

washingtonwizards,35wjlg,phdre,9,Thu May 14 03:05:25 2015 UTC,There should be no reason why he lose any of these games... Nene literally can not grab a rebound over Horford. Couldn't even do it all game. What a fucking joke this series is over.

washingtonwizards,35wjlg,SewenNewes,0,Thu May 14 09:19:40 2015 UTC,Can't give up a huge fucking run in the late minutes of the game. Shouldn't even have been that close. Also would be nice if the refs understood the charge or the fact that horford is committing a foul when he leaps on everyone to grab an offensive board.
washingtonwizards,35wjlg,PieceOfPie_SK,7,Thu May 14 03:07:37 2015 UTC,"I'm with you bro, but horford didnt commit a foul on that offensive board. It would have been a foul if Nene bodied up to him and boxed him out. If Al jumped over that and grabbed it over the back of Nene, then it would be an offensive foul.   However, Nene, didnt even get in position to box out the defender. That was almsot a 50-50 play in midair which resulted in the more  athletic Horford taking the ball away from the butter fingered and unfocused Nene."

washingtonwizards,35wjlg,PieceOfPie_SK,0,Thu May 14 03:58:41 2015 UTC,He has been doing it all series. Idk why they never call that on him.
washingtonwizards,35wjlg,youngsaiyan,-2,Thu May 14 03:51:06 2015 UTC,more reasonable complaint is that it was a travel (which it was)

washingtonwizards,35wjlg,threeguee,-2,Thu May 14 03:47:19 2015 UTC,I mean it's embarrassing that you lost to a wall-less wizards. if anything I think you are the weakest team out of the 4 left in the east and that is apparent after your pathetic performance through 6 games. the wiz are doing a great job of trying to hand you the series though.

washingtonwizards,35wjlg,meep6969,0,Thu May 14 05:39:35 2015 UTC,Honestly I think more credit goes to Horfords hustle rather than Nene's failure to box out and snag the rebound. Nene was in good position to grab the rebound and was a split second away from securing it. Horford just made an unbelievable gutsy play to swoop in and grab it before Nene.

washingtonwizards,35vvsx,isestrex,3,Wed May 13 23:10:13 2015 UTC,WOW - no minutes restriction AND he's starting?? My guess is they are comfortable with him keeping his hand safe somehow.
washingtonwizards,35vvsx,AwesomeMan14,2,Wed May 13 23:11:43 2015 UTC,If this turns into another Gilbert situation and he misses games next year... someone's head needs to roll for this.

washingtonwizards,35wmpv,TwoAllBeefPatties,2,Thu May 14 11:57:40 2015 UTC,"This series has been unbelievably even, in my opinion. Home court advantage has meant very little.  Both the hawks and the wizards won a game on the road and both teams also lost a game on the road to a last second shot (pierce buzzer beater and horford last night).  I think both of the next two potential games are going to be a toss up.  Wizards need to win both of them.  Hawks only need to win one."

At least Seraphin has that dumb hook he makes 60% of the time. Gooden isn't a passer or a defender.  Nene is even worse because he's supposed to be good. Cannot believe how atrocious he's been the entire playoffs. Needs a benching. Useless."
washingtonwizards,35wk9x,lverson,1 point,Thu May 14 02:49:12 2015 UTC,Gooden was reckless with the ball. Turnovers is what he will do best if he doesn't make a 3.
washingtonwizards,35wk9x,Shaidester,6,Thu May 14 05:29:26 2015 UTC,"Nene plays with no heart. He gets paid 13 million to not hustle, push a player on the other team and complain to the ref.

Atlanta sports have had a lot of rough losses, especially in playoffs.   if Horford hadn't made in that put back score, it would have been a terrible loss for us instead. there isn't really a win-win situation here; seems like win-loss is the only scenario (lol). anyways, y'all played a good game last night, good luck in the rest of the series!"
washingtonwizards,35wk28,wakaflockasmith,2,Thu May 14 18:38:22 2015 UTC,you too. Let's just hope the winner of the series wins the East.
washingtonwizards,35wk28,DWood10,2,Thu May 14 19:08:48 2015 UTC,He just made Al Horford look like Wilt. We need to upgrade our 4 spot. If Ryan Anderson is free i'd love to nab him and pair him with Hump
washingtonwizards,35wk28,_masterofdisaster,2,Thu May 14 02:52:09 2015 UTC,Obviously we'd have to give up a lot but Serge Ibaka is my dream PF.
washingtonwizards,35wk28,tooz,1 point,Thu May 14 12:41:08 2015 UTC,"That's my ideal move for us to make in the offseason. Unfortunately, we don't have any real assets to trade for him in other than picks. But I'd be okay with us giving up a first for him, to be honest.  He's 27, so he's not too young but at the same time we know exactly what we're getting. Plus, our offense looks great when there's a real stretch four on the floor (like during the rare stretches where Gooden actually hits his 3s)."

washingtonwizards,35uqmo,baobao3,2,Wed May 13 17:55:21 2015 UTC,It's cool to see another fan base appreciate Pierce so much. It has been great watching his career and I'm glad he found a winning team to play on for his final few seasons.
washingtonwizards,35uqmo,Jailan345,1 point,Wed May 13 19:03:37 2015 UTC,"The man is a beast and a legend. I am so glad he isn't on Brooklyn any more and he is a lot of what we need in Atlanta. Leadership, back bone, a voice (although a little less of one would be nice.) I sit a few rows behind the visitors bench in Philips Arena and watch him work the huddle, talk to guys, getting them moving and keep them together. The epitome of veteran leadership plus he is still a beast on the floor. the ultimate guy you hate til he puts on your jersey then you hope he never leaves."
washingtonwizards,35uqmo,cwolfe,1 point,Fri May 15 02:16:33 2015 UTC,"I feel like Pierce needed the support of other fanbases before he retired to be recognized for what he is and what he's done. I think because of Boston's generally bad reputation as a fanbase (based on what I've read on /r/nba ), people needed to hear about it from someone besides us crazy from New England sports fans."
washingtonwizards,35wksk,Cpr196,5,Thu May 14 02:49:02 2015 UTC,"We need a younger guy who plays D and rebounds. No need for too much offense from that spot, Gortat is a good interior scorer. Nene has never averaged 9rpg with us, we need someone who will do the dirty work"

washingtonwizards,35wksk,smilezandsouthstar,5,Thu May 14 15:07:24 2015 UTC,Otto barely weighs 200. He would get abused as a full-time 4.

washingtonwizards,35uiqk,Brim4889,8,Wed May 13 16:55:39 2015 UTC,"If he coaches the regular season the way he's coached these playoffs, then yes. We're shooting 3s, he's not subbing Beal out right when he gets hot, he's been willing to try new things, and the small ball lineup is genius. And he's letting Otto play, which is one of the biggest reasons we are where we are.  Randy, at the very least, has earned another season. And I have been one of his biggest haters for 2.5 years now. I don't cringe every time I see him lately"
washingtonwizards,35uiqk,Boymankid,2,Wed May 13 17:41:28 2015 UTC,"That's how I feel. As recently as 3 weeks ago I was all for firing him into the heart of the sun. Now I have a glimmer of hope that he'll be a poor man's Doc Rivers- a coach who was (rightfully) shit on for incredibly stupid decisions before getting it all together as a coach"""
washingtonwizards,35uiqk,pakilicious,3,Thu May 14 13:47:09 2015 UTC,"He has to coach this way next season, not only in the playoffs:   Play Otto 30+ minutes Go small at times Encourage inside-out 3's"
washingtonwizards,35uiqk,leo2k2ndc,2,Wed May 13 20:33:38 2015 UTC,"Maybe not playing Otto 30+, but definitely giving him a chance to start or play a significant amount of minutes. He was DNP'd a number of times during the season but he has clearly shown he is capable of playing big minutes"

washingtonwizards,35si8k,Graxxon,5,Wed May 13 03:27:48 2015 UTC,Read my mind. We don't want another RG3 caliber injury here.
washingtonwizards,35si8k,dancebebe,2,Wed May 13 03:38:24 2015 UTC,I agree. Seeing Beal and Porter step up as reliable leaders on the court has been the best part about this playoff run. I think the experience they are getting is equally as valuable for team as the ECF would be. Its just too risky to play John for such a marginal benefit.

washingtonwizards,35si8k,TheHeavyBackpack,3,Wed May 13 14:01:03 2015 UTC,If Wall was cleared I would be as scared as I was when I heard he had 5 fractures in his hand...
washingtonwizards,35si8k,feasdog,3,Wed May 13 06:10:23 2015 UTC,"Perplexed.  I'm no doctor, but have had a non-displaced fracture in my hand. Didn't know it was a non-displaced fracture, so just continued on playing basketball, lifting, etc. and just attributed whatever I had to a bone bruise, or something. Only weeks later did I get it checked out. The bone mended but because I was so active on it, I still have some residual achyness. That said, that was only one fracture and it was in my hand, not wrist. There are 27 bones in the hand, and if John Wall has fractured five of them I cannot imagine a doctor in the world other than Dr. James Andrews/Dr. Mike Shanahan that would allow him to go back out on the court.   The guy is in year one of a five year deal, had an amazing year, suddenly has a supporting cast in Otto Porter (for president) and Bradley Beal, and is in a conference that, next year, is going to be blown up/possibly worse. Bulls will likely blow up, Toronto may be blown up, Nets will continue to be Nets, etc.  That said, if by some miracle he has super healing powers, I'd love to see him out there. But that's an if and only if. The Hawks are beatable, and the Cavs are pretty much LeBron + four other guys barely able to make it up and down the court without rolling their ankles right now. It's shitty timing, but regardless of how this series and the rest of the postseason goes, I haven't been as excited since the days of Agent Zero doing Agent Zero things (never forget, never forgive Gerald Wallace).  Bradley Beal for 40 points tonight?"

I would rather a healthy Wall wreaking havoc next year than him hurt himself further.   That being said - if the staff evaluates him as being able to play at some point soon, I trust their judgement. They have been cautious in the past with Wall and Beal injuries, so if they agree he can play, then I trust them"

washingtonwizards,35obkx,NotJustAnebadi,17,Tue May 12 04:24:06 2015 UTC,I'm trying to convince myself that the Wall injury has some upside in that it is letting Brad expand and develop his game in the playoffs. He was absolutely incredible tonight.
washingtonwizards,35obkx,first_time-long_time,3,Tue May 12 04:27:47 2015 UTC,I love beal but last night blew me away.  Showed that he is a true superstar.
washingtonwizards,35obkx,hokeywebb22,1 point,Tue May 12 12:31:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah Beal scored in a lot of different ways , I was very impressed"
washingtonwizards,35obkx,peterkimmm,6,Tue May 12 16:07:31 2015 UTC,"Beal is putting up some superstar numbers without our best assist guy. Excited that we still have a chance in this series, but incredibly excited for the future"
washingtonwizards,35obkx,NeueRedskinWelle,3,Tue May 12 13:38:26 2015 UTC,Beal hates people named Kyle
washingtonwizards,35obkx,LooseCannon13,4,Tue May 12 16:55:51 2015 UTC,"Brad's defense has been great the entire year. While he took a little step back scoring wise, IMO the improvements he made to his defense and distributing make up for it."
washingtonwizards,35obkx,nihilistcommunist,1 point,Tue May 12 06:52:18 2015 UTC,Because he's dangerous. Shot 50/50/90 (49/49/90) this season. How many players in the NBA come off a screen and shoot 50%?
washingtonwizards,35obkx,sluckinfuttbuckin,-3,Tue May 12 15:13:41 2015 UTC,"Kyle ""Ashton Kutcher"" Korver is such an annoying pretty boy. Hope Beal locks him down going forward."
washingtonwizards,35omch,smilezandsouthstar,6,Tue May 12 06:24:47 2015 UTC,"Best game of his career?  His defense was fantastic, too."
washingtonwizards,35omch,ireddit270,7,Tue May 12 06:26:06 2015 UTC,"Beal has had Korver under lock and key this entire series. Incredibly hard task to chase him around, while also doing so much offensively himself. Scoring 34 while only holding your matchup to just 4 shots for 6 points. Atlanta would have blown us out the gym if not for Beal's defense on Korver.   Meanwhile someone like Harden might score 30+ but his matchup has 20 points 4-5 from three and sparks the run that gets his team ran off the floor. Give me a two-way player any day"

washingtonwizards,35nycq,purpleflow,7,Tue May 12 01:33:02 2015 UTC,7 seconds with 6 minutes to go will not affect the end of the game. There's too many variables in between. Earlier minutes are always less valuable than later minutes.
washingtonwizards,35nycq,peterkimmm,3,Tue May 12 01:34:17 2015 UTC,It was like 5 extra seconds. Enjoy your victory
washingtonwizards,35nycq,madlate,4,Tue May 12 01:40:58 2015 UTC,That 6 seconds doesn't even matter that early in the game.
washingtonwizards,35nycq,purpleflow,11,Tue May 12 01:42:45 2015 UTC,"Damn, really bummed.  I think it caught Pierce off-guard that he was completely open, and made him take an awkward shot .....         Really really wished Wall never got injured :("

washingtonwizards,35nycq,madlate,5,Tue May 12 01:58:02 2015 UTC,"That one is a stinger. Far, far too many blown chances.   And if Randy refuses to use our bench when Nene and/or Gortat is garbage again I'm going to pop a blood vessel. This is fucking absurd. Shout out to those end of game plays but that doesn't come close to making up for it."
washingtonwizards,35nycq,RyBuck,5,Tue May 12 02:00:54 2015 UTC,This was the first playoff loss that hurt. It just was something about this loss
washingtonwizards,35nycq,Boymankid,4,Tue May 12 11:24:36 2015 UTC,"Beal played his heart out and filled up the stat sheet. If Beal can be that aggressive every game with Wall on the floor, they would arguably be the best backcourt.   BTW did anyone else at the game notice all the hot ass girls in the Verizon Center?"
washingtonwizards,35nycq,jackshepardlives,8,Tue May 12 01:39:04 2015 UTC,"Another internal victory for the Wizards.  Seriously though, fucking A effort from Bynum! Dude can worm through the smallest holes."
washingtonwizards,35nycq,Boymankid,1 point,Tue May 12 02:05:01 2015 UTC,Whatever I guess it helps balance out the other clock stoppage somewhat.
washingtonwizards,35nycq,jackshepardlives,2,Tue May 12 02:28:20 2015 UTC,"I saw that. The clock just kept going, I was like wtf is happening are they dumb   FUCK this game was frustrating"

washingtonwizards,35nycq,Brim4889,13,Tue May 12 01:38:12 2015 UTC,"Damn, I know what it's like to watch the refs blow calls. Korver walked and it wasnt even close... Get them next game fellas, I want to see the Cavs/Wiz rivalry renewed with hopefully a fresh Kyrie and Wall. GL"
washingtonwizards,35nycq,kamikazemelonman,4,Tue May 12 01:39:49 2015 UTC,"I'm pulling for the Cavs, there's bad blood from the Gilbert years between our teams but I hate the Bulls even more"
washingtonwizards,35nycq,ro1249,5,Tue May 12 01:34:56 2015 UTC,"I hate the Bulls more than any other team, their fanbase is cocky af too. I just want that old Cavs/Wiz hate back. We had some fun series. I think you guys are clearly the better team (vs ATL) by stomping the Raps and playing the Hawks like you are w/o Wall. ( plus the Hawks got tested by the Nets...)    Kyrie/Wall ( theyre both going to be banged up) LBJ/Pierce  ( Just a classic matchup) Mozgod-TT/Gortat-Nene ( strength vs strength) JR/Beal ( Who will get hot?)     Makes for one hell of an ECF if you ask me..."
washingtonwizards,35nycq,kamikazemelonman,4,Tue May 12 01:35:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed very much, and if it's not the Wiz coming out of the East honestly I want the Cavs. Hate the Bulls, and I hate Atlanta a lot, mostly for baseball reasons"
washingtonwizards,35nycq,ruffus4life,3,Tue May 12 01:34:21 2015 UTC,"And the fact the Bulls have won so many times and the Hawks have at least 1 championship banner ( granted it was years ago) but neither of us have anything. GL, I'll be rooting for you guys hard until we play each other next round - may we both be healthy and the best team win!"
washingtonwizards,35nycq,srmc11,1 point,Tue May 12 01:35:04 2015 UTC,In all fairness the refs blew that call in your guys favor ;p
washingtonwizards,35nycq,Kirbybajerby,9,Tue May 12 01:44:32 2015 UTC,"Gortat isn't going to be that bad Two games straight, Al Horford isnt going to hit that many midrange two games straight, referees will not call it that one sided two games straight, wait for game 5 and keep the faith. Brad is playing his ass off, if we had a few more thing bounce in, that's ours. Let's wait for game 5 to see what's good"
washingtonwizards,35nycq,yaboymattyk,7,Tue May 12 04:32:05 2015 UTC,Um those midrange shots are Al Horford's bread and butter.   I don't see how the game was called one-sided. Yeah Korver definitely traveled but did you see Nene's dirty pick the play before?
washingtonwizards,35nycq,jackshepardlives,0,Tue May 12 04:38:25 2015 UTC,Yeah but did you see the constant little touch fouls on all of teague/German gremlin backup pg's drives? Yeah but did you see the no calls on all of Nene's dunks? Yeah but did you see them falling for Pero's flops? Yeah but did you see the no calls on most of Beal and Sessions' drives?
washingtonwizards,35nycq,ro1249,2,Tue May 12 11:25:30 2015 UTC,i have no idea how those nene dunks got no call.
washingtonwizards,35nycq,Brim4889,3,Tue May 12 01:43:37 2015 UTC,German gremlin with a mustard stain in his hair
washingtonwizards,35nycq,purpleflow,2,Tue May 12 02:00:31 2015 UTC,Those ticky tack fouls the refs were calling on him seemed to really psych him out of his game. He looked like slumping post All Star break Gortat which I hope doesn't reappear.
washingtonwizards,35nycq,ro1249,13,Tue May 12 02:11:19 2015 UTC,So annoying that Wall is out. Would have sweeped this team with him in
washingtonwizards,35nycq,purpleflow,7,Tue May 12 04:09:42 2015 UTC,I feel your pain man. I know that feel. You guys should have had a chance to tie with that blatant Korver walk. Damn.
washingtonwizards,35nycq,Puqqz,3,Tue May 12 02:19:07 2015 UTC,"Hawks fan here so maybe I am biased but I don't think you can just assume that you would have swept us if Wall was playing. His injury has caused people like Paul Pierce, Bynum, Sessions, Nene etc to step their game up and pick up the slack. If John Wall plays, those guys may not step up in the same way and while Washington is undoubtedly a much better team with Wall on the floor, the makeup of the games would be entirely different and who knows what would actually happen.   Also, we won the regular season series 3-1 and while regular season results don't mean much, I think it at least means that you guys aren't going to sweep us."
washingtonwizards,35nycq,-Runaway,2,Tue May 12 11:25:35 2015 UTC,I would much rather have a drunk John Wall on the court than Will Bynum stepping his game up
washingtonwizards,35nycq,ro1249,3,Tue May 12 01:32:41 2015 UTC,"if we had a full roster and you guys played us without horford or teague, do you really think you have a chance to win any of these games?  Millsap was out majority of game 3 and you guys lost.  Take Horford or Teague out and you guys dont win 2 games in this series.  John is a top 10 player in the league, so saying we couldn't sweep is just false.  You obviously dont know how much John means to our team."
washingtonwizards,35nycq,Obersts001,3,Tue May 12 01:36:13 2015 UTC,"I mean, who knows man? I hate focusing on hypotheticals because you never know who will step up when someone goes out. Our bench outplayed our starters in game 3 and were the sole reason why we were able to come back and tie the game after being down by 21. So yeah, if Teague or Horford were out, I don't think it would be insane to think that Dennis Shroeder or Mike Muscala or someone else could step up and play a key role to help us get a win. While it would be tougher for sure, I don't think you can just assume we would lose."
washingtonwizards,35nycq,ro1249,5,Tue May 12 01:48:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, but you are looking at it from your teams point of view.  you have a very capable bench and i agree players would step up ala game 3 in the 4th quarter.    Here is is my arguement.  Our bench is not like your bench and ""people stepping up"" on our team equate to 10 point performances.  At best Ramon will drop the occasional 20 point game.   John on the other hand is averaging 13 assist on 18 ppg.  He account for literally half of our offense.  We only score around 100 and John accounts for 50 points.  You cannot tell me someone with that kind of impact would not change the course of these games.  Game one is a perfect example (although a small sample).  He showed you guys what he is capable of doing against a REALLY solid defense.  You dont have that kind of player because you guys spread it around more.  John Wall is the Wizards offense.  Theres a reason we are like 10-40sumtin with him out."
washingtonwizards,35nycq,Stringphoneinventor,2,Tue May 12 11:26:16 2015 UTC,Based on how much you guys are struggling against us without Wall? I think it's safe to say the series would be close to over with.
washingtonwizards,35nycq,ro1249,4,Tue May 12 01:59:16 2015 UTC,"No, he was right. If Wall played, things would be different. Possibly better, possibly worse. The ""if"" stuff is stupid because reality is not ""if""."
washingtonwizards,35nycq,mrgiantnutpain2,0,Tue May 12 02:09:01 2015 UTC,"I mean, you are playing the ""if' game which is pretty useless. What if Paul Millsap wasn't sick during game 3. Maybe we win that game and it's 3-1 right now. What if Thabo didn't get injured by NYPD and he's there late in game 3 to guard Paul Pierce."
washingtonwizards,35nycq,Argobast,-6,Tue May 12 02:36:10 2015 UTC,Wizards fan here so maybe I'm biased but your team is a pile of shit in the playoffs so far when you face quality defenses. And Korver invented a new dance move that wasn't called.
washingtonwizards,35nycq,DannyBoi1Derz,7,Tue May 12 01:50:43 2015 UTC,"I don't see why you feel the need to be disrespectful, man. I'm not going in here saying the Wizards suck and the Hawks are GOAT or anything like that. Try to be classy."
washingtonwizards,35nycq,CLEANSH0T,0,Tue May 12 01:53:07 2015 UTC,We swept Toronto and they beat us in the regular season? So what's your point?
washingtonwizards,35nycq,Boymankid,4,Tue May 12 01:57:49 2015 UTC,Yeah Korver traveled but what did you think of Nene's pick the play before?
washingtonwizards,35nycq,kmhokies35,1 point,Tue May 12 02:04:58 2015 UTC,"Wall played game 2, so maybe not a sweep"

washingtonwizards,35nycq,Brim4889,2,Tue May 12 02:12:12 2015 UTC,I really hope Wall comes back next game.  I'm tired of your what ifs.  Great series.
washingtonwizards,35nycq,Nanny_McPhee,3,Tue May 12 16:03:40 2015 UTC,"I don't like to complain about referees  Enjoy this victory Hawks, I don't mean to sound bitter but any victory you have in this series is really hollow without Wall in our lineup. We're still going to go on your floor and take game 5"
washingtonwizards,35nycq,Boymankid,14,Tue May 12 02:39:26 2015 UTC,I feel like the refs screwed them over just as much as they screwed us
washingtonwizards,35nycq,Puqqz,1 point,Tue May 12 04:35:48 2015 UTC,"Even if the Wizards lose this series, I hope it ignites a fire in Bradley Beal to become better. If he can play like he did in Game 4 when Wall is on the court, we're going places."
washingtonwizards,35ogng,TheHeavyBackpack,2,Tue May 12 05:16:35 2015 UTC,Agreed and injuries are part of the game. Every team is dealing with it or has dealt with it
washingtonwizards,35ogng,ireddit270,2,Tue May 12 05:38:41 2015 UTC,"TBH, I always feel like the team that is down 2-1 is going to get some benefits of the call.  The Wizards may have played a better overall though in game 3 and props to Atlanta to making some adjustments and they also had a healthy Millsap.  Hopefully, the Wizards will get some better play out of guys like Gortat and Porter who had been playing well prior to this game."
washingtonwizards,35ogng,A2daRon,0,Tue May 12 15:32:32 2015 UTC,that travel was ridiculous tho to be fair  i agree with you still. no need to be salty
washingtonwizards,35n8g4,Gr8WallofChinatown,13,Mon May 11 22:02:07 2015 UTC,"So he's saying that John Wall at 6'4 and Derrick Rose at 6'2 are short and short players don't win championships...uh....what about Tony Parker (6'2), Dywane Wade (6'4), and Chauncey Billups (6'3). And if we're talking NFL, how about Drew Breed (6'0) and Russell Wilson (5'11). Cowherd is beyond stupid."
washingtonwizards,35n8g4,wantstosavetheworld,2,Mon May 11 22:35:14 2015 UTC,what he really said is  when's the last time you saw someone dougie their way to a title

washingtonwizards,35n8g4,hibby_,1 point,Mon May 11 22:23:14 2015 UTC,I LOL'd. Cowherd is one of those guys that attracts listeners because people love to hate him.   Pretty ironic given his feelings towards Mayweather.
washingtonwizards,35n8g4,TylertheHater,9,Tue May 12 20:50:13 2015 UTC,"“I mean, I think John Wall’s unbelievable to watch, and I think Derrick Rose [is unbelievable]. I’d take Jimmy Butler in a heartbeat to build my franchise. When’s the last time John Wall changed a series defensively? When’s the last time Derrick Rose changed a series defensively? Kawhi Leonard does it on both ends, Jimmy Butler does it on both ends.”"
washingtonwizards,35n8g4,Boymankid,12,Mon May 11 22:02:55 2015 UTC,How about when John Wall shut down Kyle Lowry/Lou Williams last series? This guy is a grade A idiot

washingtonwizards,35n8g4,madlate,6,Tue May 12 17:37:27 2015 UTC,how much more dumb can you get
washingtonwizards,35n8g4,limiter_remove,5,Mon May 11 22:41:39 2015 UTC,"It's obvious this guy, like many of the commentators on TV, have never watched the Wizards play a single game. For all the athleticism and speed, there are times when I think John Wall is simply a genius on the court. He makes passes and reads defenses and knows exactly where they are when I can't even see it at times from the TV overhead angle. If you watch the games against the Hawks without him. The ball movement is stagnant at times, the pick and roll with Gortat is no longer effective with Gortat being horrible in Game 4. With Wall, the rest of these games would've been a breeze.   If he wants to build a franchise around Jimmy Butler, did he watch the playoffs last year when the Wizards beat down the Bulls in 5 games. I definitely think there is room for improvement for John Wall. He should become a consistent shooter to the point of being able to deliver 20+ on any given night. But to say Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard I can accept if Kawhi takes the team as his own next season as I saw flashes of this season. But Jimmy Butler, c'mon man."
washingtonwizards,35n8g4,damnatio_memoriae,3,Tue May 12 02:55:28 2015 UTC,You spelled Cow Turd wrong.
washingtonwizards,35n8g4,asmoss92,2,Mon May 11 23:11:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with Steinberg and find Cowherd just as patronizing as the next guy but I just didn't like this article. Ok, I get the 4 vines of Wall making game changing plays on the defensive end. that's a solid rebuttal to Cowherd's point, but the picture of Messi at the end just seemed a bit petty. Cross-sport analogies are fun and all but I feel like this ""debate"" is better served staying within the sport.  I'd prefer if this argument was just put to bed, because at this point Cowherd's so committed to this angle that he's never going to fully concede that he's wrong even if John does win a title. He'll come up with some excuse like ""Player X was more of the guy for that team"" or ""Player Y for the opponent wasn't full strength, he got lucky."" We need to stop giving this guy's name so many hits and just stand behind our guy. Because why would he listen to a bunch of Wizards fans anyway if he's crazy enough to say what's already been said?"
washingtonwizards,35n8g4,TylertheHater,1 point,Tue May 12 01:49:31 2015 UTC,I agree that cross-sports analysis can be pretty dumb and it's best to avoid it but Steinberg was simply making a better argument using Cowherd's own twisted logic

washingtonwizards,35o7du,Piratesnoopy,4,Tue May 12 10:57:31 2015 UTC,"I may or may not get downvoted to hell for this but:   Randy is coaching smart. By playing both your starters, who have been there all year, consistently you are coaching smart. You cannot simply change up your game plan every time someone starts sucking. Don't get me wrong, my blood was boiling when Gortat missed that many fucking points but it isn't Randy's fault. Look at Nene, he sucked the first two games, but by playing him consistently he gave him the chance to get better and now game three and four good 'ol Nene is back and I think he will remain a solid player for the rest of the playoffs. You can bash him all you want but Randy is a smart coach and he knows that by playing his starters more (even if they are sucking) they will come through in the end. Gortat will pull through and have a huge game 5, then you will thank Randy for not putting in Humphries."
washingtonwizards,35o7du,Stringphoneinventor,2,Tue May 12 06:20:16 2015 UTC,"I get that, but at the same Humphries played pretty well during the season until he got hurt and then fell out of the rotation. Then again, Drew Gooden has been making it rain so who the hell knows"
washingtonwizards,35o7du,Brim4889,1 point,Tue May 12 15:27:56 2015 UTC,Why? What makes you think he'll change anything? He's not better defensively than Nene and he won't fix Gortat being awful tonight
washingtonwizards,35o7du,extraneouspanthers,1 point,Tue May 12 05:11:47 2015 UTC,Humphries is better defensively than Kris Hunphries. Nené is slow and has no rim protection. He can't rebound anymore since his foot and knees are worn out. Nené is a statue on defense. On offense. Nené is a blackhole. He kills the ball movement.
washingtonwizards,35o7du,Gr8WallofChinatown,0,Tue May 12 12:50:23 2015 UTC,Haha you clearly don't actually watch the games.

washingtonwizards,35o7du,Gr8WallofChinatown,2,Tue May 12 15:14:16 2015 UTC,"Fine, Hump is not better defensively than Nene. They almost cancel each other out. Humphries is probably quicker, but not as strong. Hump isn't gonna bully anyone down low, but his midrange is better than Nenes - however we want bully ball against their power forwards.  The intensity that he brought game 3 is how we're gonna win this series, and sad to say but we don't have our best player - if we're going to win its because our starters outplay their starters. Messing with lineups and hoping to trick our way past them isn't gonna work.  That said, if Hump can guard Millsap or Horford I'm all for it. I just don't think he can"

washingtonwizards,35lwqk,Obersts001,14,Mon May 11 16:09:10 2015 UTC,Just seems highly improbable at this stage. No idea what the team is hoping will happen in the next seven hours if Wall still hasn't dribbled a ball.
washingtonwizards,35lwqk,anon__sequitur,5,Mon May 11 16:10:14 2015 UTC,"agreed. My guess is that wiz management have to walk a fine line here. They want to be encouraging to John, let them know that they support his efforts to come back. So even if privately Wittman, or whoever makes these decisions, is like ""there's no way he's playing tonight, it's too soon, can't risk further injury"", they have to keep quiet and just hope for the best."
washingtonwizards,35lwqk,thesriman,8,Mon May 11 16:43:43 2015 UTC,Is this just gamesmanship to get Atlanta to waste time and plan as if Wall was coming back? I could support that.
washingtonwizards,35lwqk,Boymankid,2,Mon May 11 16:55:27 2015 UTC,"Probably, sure. Maybe they're just hoping that the Hawks coaches have to waste some time creating an alternate game plan."
washingtonwizards,35lwqk,ruffus4life,3,Mon May 11 17:48:16 2015 UTC,"IMO he's doubtful to play tonight but if they're even considering it, then maybe he is a go for game 5 or 6..."
washingtonwizards,35lwqk,madlate,4,Mon May 11 16:34:36 2015 UTC,i hope this is nothing more than a will he/won't he to maybe disrupt atlanta's game plan.

washingtonwizards,35lwqk,DWood10,3,Mon May 11 17:21:06 2015 UTC,My best case scenario is he rests all the way up to the ECF if we get past the Hawks.

See, Jordan brought in ticket sales, helped the team score more points, and put the franchise on the national radar. But did he really help the team the way Pierce has?  Hell no. MJ has always been known as an alpha dickhead in the locker room, but the stories from his time in DC are among the worst. Calling Kwame Brown a ""faggot"" during practices comes to mind. Team morale is an intangible that can be the difference between a playoff team and a championship contender.  Pierce has had a serious effect on Wall, Beal, and Porter. You can see it clear as day. They're so much more aggressive now, more confident and competitive than last year. More poised in high pressure situations. He's  given this team an edge. I mean for God sake, we beat the #1 seed last night without our best player. I knew it was a good call to add him this past offseason, but I never could've predicted the ripple effect he would have in the locker room. I'm so happy with our squad right now, regardless of how this playoff series goes from here."

Without Wall, the return-to-form Derrick and Jimmy definitely have the edge on our back court. Otherwise, I think the teams match up extremely well, nearly identical. It'd be a great match up but hopefully wall can get well soon!"
washingtonwizards,35fyg5,ASpanishInquisitor,7,Sun May 10 13:13:22 2015 UTC,I would much rather see Wiz/Cavs. I have this vision of Paul walking up to LeBron as he's about to take series-saving free throws...

washingtonwizards,35h0a4,happyflappypancakes,0,Sun May 10 15:23:15 2015 UTC,Fucking badass. So happy with him and the team.
washingtonwizards,35h0a4,Zomby24,0,Sun May 10 17:22:54 2015 UTC,"Porter is posting a 17 PER so far through the postseason.  Honestly the only thing unsustainable is the 45% from three, other than that I don't see why he couldn't easily post these numbers as a fulltime starter. He gets a lot of points off pure hustle and moving off ball."

It's not his fault the team couldn't handle ball pressure from third stringers. Witt sent Gortat in to stop the bleeding and Gortat proceeded to give Schroeder an and-1 and left Mike Muscala wide open on the tying 3 -- that ain't Witt's fault either.  On the other hand, nobody but the players in their post game interviews are giving Witt props for drawing up a play to get the smallest player on the Hawks switched onto the motherfucking Truth."

washingtonwizards,35hh5r,Zomby24,1 point,Sun May 10 17:35:14 2015 UTC,"I'm interested to know why you think blowing a 20 point lead is on Wittman instead of the players.

washingtonwizards,35hh5r,extraneouspanthers,0,Sun May 10 17:12:06 2015 UTC,He needed to call a timeout earlier and regroup. I am still on the fire wittman bandwagon and I think people are forgetting how bad it got during the season. Like during 76ers game where a lot of Wizards fans were rooting 76ers because there was a chance Wittman could be fired.
washingtonwizards,35hh5r,VCURedskins,0,Sun May 10 13:34:38 2015 UTC,"There was definitely some bad coaching during that losing stretch, but I also don't think Wittman had great personnel to work with either. Beal was injured and we had no wing players who could space the floor ,so Wittman resorted to trying to run a slow offense through our inconsistent bigs (which negatively impacted Wall's style of play also). Also remember that Sessions sucked when he first got here  Now that we have a decent amount of guys shooting the ball well - Beal, Porter, Gooden, Sessions. And Wittman is running out the small lineups and giving Porter plenty of PT. If he continues this into next season he's doing a sufficient job"

It's because I've seen what a really good Nene can be, and it's just downright disappointing when his game falls apart.

washingtonwizards,35bx9t,Niehaus,4,Fri May 8 20:56:03 2015 UTC,"You may remember me from word clouds I made in every MLB, Soccer, NHL, NBA, and NFL team subreddit for their last respective seasons, or my Swears/Subscriber Breakdown by for states/cities/regional subreddits and my previous sports profanity breakdown. I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.  Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying this year's word clouds."

washingtonwizards,35bzg5,madlate,2,Sat May 9 13:10:56 2015 UTC,"Yes Wizards have possibilities of making a final run this year, something that hasn't happened in a long time, but Wall is 25. 25! I don't think we should risk his health for a ""possibility"" of a good run. And we're not even counting that maybe he cannot dribble good or do good layups with his left hand if he plays now.   Look at Lillard after his hand injury post all-star and how his numbers dropped. I don't think we should risk it, we'll have more chances of a final run, and with the way Nene is playing I'm not too conviced we're gonna make it"

washingtonwizards,35bzg5,madlate,2,Sat May 9 13:14:26 2015 UTC,DC sports fans are going to be very weary of playing through injuries for a playoff game
washingtonwizards,35bzg5,kmhokies35,2,Sat May 9 16:11:13 2015 UTC,He might be able to play through the fractures and the pain. The big problem is the swelling. You cant handle the basketball if your hand/wrist is the size of a watermellon
washingtonwizards,35bfs5,Theblackerthesame,7,Fri May 8 18:33:39 2015 UTC,Beal isn't a PG
washingtonwizards,35bfs5,TheHeavyBackpack,5,Fri May 8 19:36:37 2015 UTC,Exactly. I feel like Sessions would help the team more at the 1 slot.
washingtonwizards,35bfs5,Shaidester,3,Fri May 8 22:32:57 2015 UTC,"I agree, watching Sessions in that game made me feel more comfortable having him start at the 1 until/if Wall returns. He has a vastly different playstyle than Wall but it's still good enough. We just can't have Nene be in a game for so long and pull a Hibbert. Really hope we consider using Bynum but I doubt it."
washingtonwizards,35bfs5,TheHeavyBackpack,2,Fri May 8 23:36:33 2015 UTC,What I wanted to happen all season was to have Nene coming off the bench and providing a spark for the second unit. During the stretch that he came off the bench he performed really well and killed the opposing team's second unit. I wouldn't mind testing Bynum out but I'm still not confident in his abilities.
washingtonwizards,35bfs5,purpleflow,3,Fri May 8 23:57:56 2015 UTC,I'd rather have Ramon or garret run point.
washingtonwizards,35bfs5,Shaidester,2,Fri May 8 20:32:46 2015 UTC,Why Temple? He is absolute shit.
washingtonwizards,35bfs5,purpleflow,3,Fri May 8 20:43:38 2015 UTC,"Because he has experience running point, opposed to Bradley who is worse than Temple.  I'd rather have Temple or Sessions chasing Teague all game as opposed to Beal."
washingtonwizards,35bfs5,Shaidester,0,Fri May 8 20:50:16 2015 UTC,Yes Bradley isn't meant to be PG but I think Bynum would be more useful at this point than Temple. Temple didn't contribute anything in game 2 really. He's just a waste of roster space.
washingtonwizards,35bfs5,madlate,3,Fri May 8 21:43:19 2015 UTC,What about Ramon  and Temple is great on defense
washingtonwizards,35bfs5,Shaidester,1 point,Fri May 8 22:26:53 2015 UTC,Give me stats to show me he is good defensively. I didn't see it in game 2. He was good defensively last year but that's it.
washingtonwizards,35bfs5,Shaidester,1 point,Fri May 8 23:29:57 2015 UTC,Ramon is definitely a better shooter than Wall but he doesn't get the whole team rolling like Wall does.

washingtonwizards,35bfs5,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,1 point,Fri May 8 23:59:18 2015 UTC,Ramon is a better shooter than Wall was 2 years ago. Now Wall picks his spots better and makes more of his open shots
washingtonwizards,35bfs5,TheHeavyBackpack,1 point,Sat May 9 13:54:15 2015 UTC,Yup. Wal finishes at the rim 13% better than Sessions does and his midrange % is also better by about 12%. The only place Sessions does better is from 3 point range by about 7%. All of my numbers come from Vorped.
washingtonwizards,35bfs5,madlate,2,Sat May 9 22:02:50 2015 UTC,"obviously not, no one on the team is as good as wall. but why would you pick bynum over ramon"

washingtonwizards,357de2,pandashuman,29,Thu May 7 18:49:12 2015 UTC,"Fractures typically occur when a powerful force is placed upon a bone, forcing it to bend and eventually snap or break. Non-displaced fractures refer to the way in which the bone broke. Usually, this type of fracture occurs when the bone partially or fully breaks in one spot, but remains aligned. In most cases, an x-ray is needed to diagnose this type of break as it is not normally obvious to the naked eye.  Non-displaced fractures are typically clean breaks to the bone. This usually occurs when the blow to the bone is swift and dispersed along a larger area. As such, it is normal for the bone to only break partially, which means there is usually only a crack in the bone that does not go all the way through. They differ from displaced fractures because a displaced fracture normally results in a complete break and shifts the bone from its original place, sometimes so much that is protrudes from the body.  Due to the nature of this type of fracture, a person may not be able to tell if there is an actual break in the bone. Typically, this type of fracture is seen only in an x-ray, but depending on how and where the fracture occurs, a Computed Tomography (CT) scan may be used. Before the orthopedic doctor checks for a non-displaced fracture, a person may suspect there is a fracture if certain signs of a break appear. These signs usually include stiffness, tenderness, severe pain and swelling of the area.  As a non-displaced fracture means the bone remains aligned, treating the fracture is usually simpler than treating other types of breaks. Sometimes the doctor may apply temporary pain relief to the area and provide medication to help with swelling. The doctor may then apply a splint or cast to prevent any further damage while the bone heals. This largely depends on the nature of the break and where the break occurred. A non-displaced fracture on the skull, for instance, may require very little care, and a protective covering is typically unnecessary.  Some fractures carry risk for further damage after the break occurs. Although this type of fracture leaves the bone in its original spot, it may be at risk for moving and becoming a displaced fracture sometimes weeks after the original break took place. This will cause even more damage to the surrounding area. An orthopedic doctor will typically monitor a non-displaced fracture to determine the likelihood of this happening. Fractures that happen near joints may also put the person at high risk for having arthritis in the affected area later in life.

The East has been an absolute minefield of dreadful injuries.   I'll still answer the question; I'm really, really hoping that Memphis pulls it out against the Warriors and holds off any opposition to make it to the Finals. I've been saying since the Playoffs began that the Eastern Conference Finals are going to be Washington and Cleveland, and I still hope that holds true.   I'm a Cleveland fan first, but Washington is my second choice. Just a massively likeable team. Best of luck in these next few games, really hope to see you guys in the ECF (if we take the Bulls, anyway)"

washingtonwizards,358jct,logitaunt,2,Fri May 8 01:07:09 2015 UTC,"Clippers. I'm from LA, and this is a team that hasn't even seen the conference finals. A team that has suffered 30 years of ownership that intentionally ran the team into the ground. With Ballmer at the helm, with CP3, Blake, and DeAndre all playing their best basketball, you can't help but think that their time is right now  Besides, I feel a certain kinship. Chris Paul is John Wall plus five years; the only difference is that Wall gets to spend his prime with a team that's really capable, and Paul's was wasted in New Orleans.   Besides, there's a certain kinship in style of play here.  Imagine how the Wizards would play with [insert uninjured star power forward with 2016 free agency]. That's what the Clippers would be like, if they had a bench.   That kinship goes even further when you consider that while we have to start with Ramon Sessions on friday, they've had to start with Austin Rivers."

washingtonwizards,356vgm,asmoss92,11,Thu May 7 16:29:16 2015 UTC,John Wall was snubbed. That's all I'm gonna say. We are delusional washington fans. We are strong.
washingtonwizards,356vgm,Chafed_HotDog,7,Thu May 7 17:08:09 2015 UTC,John is the MVP of the Wizards ¯_(ツ)_/¯
washingtonwizards,356vgm,Oderlods,6,Thu May 7 17:12:53 2015 UTC,"No, not out of line, but at a sporting event in the midst of playoff fandom: logic has little to no place.     ""really? you guys think if they switched teams Golden State would have won 67 games with Wall instead of Curry?""   Isn't something to say to a drunk/enthused sports fan, it's engaging on an intellectual level, which is not the level which they are operating on.   If someone's yelling ""Fuck Stephen Curry"" in a public place, maybe they don't have much self control and are not the best people to have a reasonable debate with."
washingtonwizards,356vgm,tommytweeter,1 point,Thu May 7 17:15:52 2015 UTC,"If someone's yelling ""Fuck Stephen Curry"" in a public place, maybe they don't have much self control and are not the best people to have a reasonable debate with.   this is very true. I was pretty tipsy so I definitely misjudged these guys based off of the friendly first interaction we had."
washingtonwizards,356vgm,tommytweeter,2,Thu May 7 17:54:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it happens.   I've tried to mostly keep to myself at sporting events since a guy suckerpunched my friend after a Redskins game over absolutely nothing. I don't think that would happen at a Wiz game, but some people just really want to get into fights."
washingtonwizards,356vgm,guga31bb,5,Thu May 7 18:21:54 2015 UTC,"Ha, I was sitting right behind you guys. The guy dressed as a Wizard was awesome.   I turned around and jokingly said ""really? you guys think if they switched teams Golden State would have won 67 games with Wall instead of Curry?""   There's zero reason to do this, especially sitting in the upper bowl where all the drunk people are. I agree with you (Curry is better than Wall right now), but debating it during a game is not the place. Let the people have their fun.  Also, when Wall missed a free throw and either you or your friend said ""Curry wouldn't have missed that!"", that certainly didn't help."
washingtonwizards,356vgm,guga31bb,1 point,Thu May 7 17:28:18 2015 UTC,"Also, when Wall missed a free throw and either you or your friend said ""Curry wouldn't have missed that!"", that certainly didn't help.   hahaha that's awesome that you saw. it definitely got pretty heated in our whole section for a few minutes there and i felt bad that it might've ruined people's time. But once those guys started getting personal I was really pissed off at some of the stuff they were saying. It was only once I saw the guy and his grandson sitting next to me that I started trying to diffuse the situation. but for a few minutes there i was saying some dumb shit like that.   Sorry if our petty argument ruined your viewing experience at all. Like i said, i've talked sports with people before but I guess i've learned the playoffs brings out the crazies in ours and probably other fanbases."
washingtonwizards,356vgm,billsfan13,2,Thu May 7 17:52:05 2015 UTC,"Sorry if our petty argument ruined your viewing experience at all   Not at all -- stuff like that is entertaining. If I was bothered by stuff like that, I wouldn't go to games. It's part of the experience (for better or worse)."
washingtonwizards,356vgm,SaysYou,2,Thu May 7 17:59:45 2015 UTC,"Nah man, you paid to go to a game. Short of racism/homophobia/excessive profanity, you have the right to state your opinion. Wittman has at time shown himself to be a poor coach. That doesn't stop fans from having the right to chant, ""Fire Wittman."""
washingtonwizards,356vgm,booya056,2,Thu May 7 17:59:08 2015 UTC,"MVP and best overall player are NOT the same thing.   Honestly I don't think switching John Wall with Steph Curry makes Golden State any weaker.  Wall's driving and passing ability offset the shooting drop off on a team as deep and talented as the Warriors.  Also I believe Wall is outright better than Curry on the defensive end.  Do I think that makes Wall a more legitimate league MVP than the player who was the best player on a 67 win team? No not really, that's not how those awards are decided. But I don't think your point of the Warriors being worse with Wall is valid.  If their response to you was bordering on violent or threatening they were clearly out of line...  What I don't understand is why on Earth you would want to make the case against our best player at a home playoff game?!  The people there are there to support the team even if it's not 100% logical to chant MVP it's a part of the fun and a part of supporting the home team. I don't understand why you'd want to question or even politely confront someone who's caught up in that spirit."
washingtonwizards,354hk4,pepman33,5,Thu May 7 01:03:08 2015 UTC,"I used the new logo which I think is gorgeous, and smoothed out the floor in terms of it's solidity with one color. And tried to go patriotic with the sidelines and give it some flavor.  Hope you guys like it.  Go Wizards!"

washingtonwizards,354hk4,prs09,3,Thu May 7 19:55:10 2015 UTC,Yes! I've been wanting that logo as the center court design for a while. Awesome

washingtonwizards,357t6p,AgentLF,6,Thu May 7 20:42:36 2015 UTC,"Arenas' injury fucked up his career. People come back from Wall's wrist injury, but that is by letting it heal. In no way do I think he should be playing nor do I want him to"
washingtonwizards,357t6p,yaboymattyk,5,Thu May 7 21:16:34 2015 UTC,"The Wizards were sub .400 for five straight seasons after Hibachi's injury. No, I don't think it's worse than that."
washingtonwizards,357t6p,logitaunt,2,Thu May 7 21:25:12 2015 UTC,Arenas and its not even close. Arenas was career ending and set us back for 6 years. Wall maybe out for the playoffs but he'll be back next season no doubt. Plus we're young and can still contend in the future with our young core.
washingtonwizards,357t6p,wigglemonster,1 point,Fri May 8 03:03:19 2015 UTC,Fortunately Wall is still so young.  We obviously had a great shot of going even deeper this year but don't think this is the best wizards team we will see with wall/beal in years to come.    Arenas injury killed the team and had to start all over.

washingtonwizards,3549ni,Boymankid,3,Thu May 7 01:53:42 2015 UTC,He as helped this team take the next step in every possible way. I would like to see him pick up his player option for next year. Then after that we can try to get KD in 2016 or Demarcus in 2017.
washingtonwizards,3549ni,youngsaiyan,2,Thu May 7 03:51:52 2015 UTC,"I would think he picks up his option, he could try to get a longer contract if he opted out but if he waits a year until the cap jumps he might be better off. Of course, not sure how much he has left in the tank but if he continues to manage the minutes in the reg season he is valuable to any team"
washingtonwizards,3549ni,Boymankid,3,Thu May 7 09:46:18 2015 UTC,"I would think that next year would be his last. Maybe he doesn't officially retire and do the Ray Allen thing and keep his options open, but he seems like the type of guy that would want to be there all year. Whether he stays or not I think that his impact will be lasting."
washingtonwizards,353viq,smilezandsouthstar,2,Wed May 6 21:54:43 2015 UTC,"I love this, and I love how Otto has matured. The fact that he's doing it in the playoffs says something too."
washingtonwizards,353qib,Kirbybajerby,10,Wed May 6 21:16:41 2015 UTC,400 level is fine. Had my season tickets in section 430. I like the fans up there vs games where I upgraded to the 100 level.

washingtonwizards,353qib,UConn11,2,Wed May 6 23:34:39 2015 UTC,"I honestly cant believe the playoff ticket prices...I'm driving down from boston for game 3 because I love your team (especially pierce), and I've decided to stay for game 4 as well and pick up some cheap tickets. These would have sold out in a few hours in boston, and my $40 tickets would have been >$100. I cant believe it!"

You can also definitely sell the tickets if you price them right.  On the other hand, for playoff tickets, I think it's definitely worth shelling out an extra $40 to sit lower down"
washingtonwizards,353qib,misunderstoodpoetry,1 point,Wed May 6 23:47:50 2015 UTC,I'll be in 418 for game 4. It's a really nice view cause it allows you to almost be on top of the play. Behind the basket is kind of rough

washingtonwizards,353qib,Mehberry,3,Thu May 7 06:21:27 2015 UTC,What's wrong with the corners vs behind the basket?
washingtonwizards,353qib,Mehberry,0,Thu May 7 10:03:35 2015 UTC,"The arena is just not well constructed to give a decent view from the corners IMO. The jumbotron isn't well angled, the corner screens as well. Plus the price is usually not worth the discount."
washingtonwizards,353s7z,baobao3,1 point,Wed May 6 21:29:32 2015 UTC,So who is the least likely person since the big bang that could take Nene's place?

washingtonwizards,3525ak,LooseCannon13,3,Wed May 6 14:30:15 2015 UTC,Yeah this is fucking terrifying. I thought it was Beal we had to worry about. If Wall doesn't come back we're all done for the year.
washingtonwizards,3525ak,MagicJab,2,Wed May 6 15:22:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think they have actually released what the doctor said, worst case is that there is ligament damage, either stretching or tearing (essential what a ""really bad sprain"" means when doctors use the phrase). I know we keep hearing no bone is broken, but a torn ligament can be just as hindering."
washingtonwizards,3525ak,Mortprsgt,1 point,Wed May 6 14:45:41 2015 UTC,I can see what he means. Wall is saying he is staying positive while seeking out another opinion just to make sure the first doctor was wrong or over reacted. No sense in giving up hope until you know for sure

washingtonwizards,3525ak,ruffus4life,1 point,Wed May 6 19:10:22 2015 UTC,"Damn, it's seems to me like that just means he didn't like whatever the first opinion was, which was probably correct. These doctors are some of the best, and will most likely come to very similar conclusions. If we don't win Game 3 I bet he'll force himself to play Game 4 and that could be a really bad thing. Gonna need a miracle of sorts to happen in the next 3 days."
washingtonwizards,3525ak,Mortprsgt,1 point,Wed May 6 14:36:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's kind of how I would read it as well. Michael Lee now reporting that Wall is getting a 3rd opinion now....which leads you to believe he didn't like the answer from the 1st or 2nd.   But who knows, Lee also implied that he is getting the 3rd opinion just to make sure it's not broken, but he also didn't clear up or clarify what the first opinions said. If you ask me, it sounds backwards. If 2 docs told John he was good with no break and just to wait til the swelling went down, I don't think he'd be looking for a 3rd doc to tell him the same thing."
washingtonwizards,3525ak,LooseCannon13,1 point,Wed May 6 14:46:20 2015 UTC,"Yea exactly, which leads me to think it might be more than a sprain. Lee just tweeted that the 3rd opinion is because it might be more than a sprain. If anything is torn in his left hand he'll be no better off than if it was broken (as far a playing time goes). :("
washingtonwizards,3525ak,Mortprsgt,-1,Wed May 6 15:38:09 2015 UTC,Without Wall Wizards have no chance. Looks like his injury is serious and won't admit it. I predict Hawks will win 4-1.

washingtonwizards,352n09,smackin,4,Thu May 7 03:04:21 2015 UTC,"As far as sleepers in the second round, Darion Atkins. He was the center at UVA, but will likely play PF as a pro. He's flying way under the radar because the system at UVA didn't show off his whole skillset, but has been impressive at showcases, like the PIT. He is great defensively and has shown he can score in the paint too."
washingtonwizards,352n09,srg3yb,2,Wed May 6 16:31:46 2015 UTC,"As a UVa student watching them throughout the season, he is underrated but also undersized. Playing PF in the NBA at 6 feet 7 is a huge disadvantage especially since he is not especially strong a la Draymond Green"

washingtonwizards,352n09,youngsaiyan,1 point,Thu May 7 04:28:17 2015 UTC,Agreed. There is nothing like drafting a player and watching him develope. I really like the second round cause it doesn't REALLY matter if you fuck up on the pick.

And if that doesn't work, then maybe some changes coming for Monday's game, and Otto likely would be the beneficiary there.   That being said, it's totally possible for Saturday. You could see Wittman getting frustrated with Nene and he actually pulled him for Gooden after putting Nene in for Gortat after he fouled out. So we'll see.   Guess all of it is kind of a moot point if Wall is out."

washingtonwizards,350izu,Gr8WallofChinatown,6,Wed May 6 02:26:38 2015 UTC,"Randy has to fulfill his quota of one good benched player, otherwise he might look competent."
washingtonwizards,350izu,Mehberry,5,Wed May 6 02:53:22 2015 UTC,Playoff whittman is keeping our secret weapon close to his chest
washingtonwizards,350izu,Virulentt,2,Wed May 6 03:51:10 2015 UTC,Wittman thinks because it's THE PLAYOFFS he has to keep a short rotation.  He learned this in Coaching for Dummies.

washingtonwizards,350izu,Brim4889,1 point,Wed May 6 13:47:17 2015 UTC,"Because we won one game, we're a better team if its Nene performing well so I don't blame him for hoping Nene swung back into it for game 2.   Also, Nene wouldn't have played nearly as much if Gortat wasn't in foul trouble. I'm sure Hump will be ready for game 3"
washingtonwizards,350izu,extraneouspanthers,1 point,Wed May 6 16:41:53 2015 UTC,I think it's mainly because we're having so much success playing small ball and Humphries is neither a stretch 4 nor big enough to play the 5.
washingtonwizards,350izu,rleung03,1 point,Wed May 6 17:57:52 2015 UTC,I mean he has a solid mid range jumper like Gooden.  Just can't hit the 3 like Gooden.  I think Wittman can work Humphries into the rotation.  Plus he defends better than Gooden.
washingtonwizards,350k5e,wat_u_doing,27,Wed May 6 02:32:17 2015 UTC,Otto Porter with that 15-8-5-3. 0 TO. :')  He should really start. Move Paul Pierce to the stretch 4. Nene is hot garbage.

washingtonwizards,350k5e,Gr8WallofChinatown,21,Wed May 6 12:47:38 2015 UTC,FreeKrisHumphries
washingtonwizards,350k5e,Mehberry,14,Wed May 6 02:32:54 2015 UTC,"Good: Otto Porter with 15 and 8 off 12 shots, Sessions stepping up big, Gortat and Beal (though a bit rough) putting in decent effort.   Bad: Garrett Temple shouldn't be higher than the 3rd guy in line. Just not a good performance and more of what he's done all year. Really could've used him.   Awful: Nene. There isn't a single excuse for his play right now. Not a single field goal for this entire series so far? 2 games and not ONE made shot? Are you kidding me?   Which leads me to...  Randy: somehow, on the night where John Wall is out and we're all cutting him a bit of slack for his lack of options, refuses to bench Nene and play Kris Humphries. Nene is going full Hibbert right now and has been terrible for months, while Humphries was one of the best guys we had all year. He should be recovered from injuries by this point. There isn't a fucking excuse for not playing him and Randy displayed his usual incompetence by not benching Nene's ass for Kris Humphries. Not a minute for his so far. Nene isn't earning more than 8 minutes or so a game like this. Let him beat Humphries, Gooden, and even Pierce for PF minutes, he's lost the right to his starting spot playing like this for so long. And get Humphries some damn playing time."
washingtonwizards,350k5e,Virulentt,3,Wed May 6 02:40:20 2015 UTC,"Nene is going full Denver Nuggets nene. He was unclutch in the playoffs there, and he's returning to that form. He has one good playoff series because we played a team he hates. That's about it."
washingtonwizards,350k5e,nofattys,4,Wed May 6 03:56:11 2015 UTC,Can't wait for him to torch the Bulls in the next round though!
washingtonwizards,350k5e,i_woke_up_like_this_,2,Wed May 6 05:34:06 2015 UTC,"I have never hated Wittman as much as I hate him right now for not benching Nene. Humphries was so good during regular season. Honestly, Nene is playing like he just doesn't give a fuck anymore about this team. He's not even trying."
washingtonwizards,350k5e,faint-smile,6,Wed May 6 02:44:43 2015 UTC,He's definitely trying. He might be trying too hard. An emotional player who seems lose his balance mentally it seems.
washingtonwizards,350k5e,first_time-long_time,4,Wed May 6 03:11:26 2015 UTC,"This is on point. We should know Nene well enough by now to understand that this emotional up and down is just part of who he is as a player. We'll need him down the road if we can get out of this series, and I'd bet he will deliver."
washingtonwizards,350k5e,nofattys,3,Wed May 6 03:31:26 2015 UTC,Yeah I love Nene. I didn't get a chance to watch this game but I'm not ready to give up on him just yet. That said I was also pleasantly surprised with Humphries all season and wish he could crack the rotation. Gooden will be the death of me. I've seen him make some solid plays but for the most part I wish he'd just head back to the YMCA lol
washingtonwizards,350k5e,anon__sequitur,5,Wed May 6 05:30:43 2015 UTC,"seriously, I understand being frustrated with Nene's poor play, but why do people get so angry and start making bizarre accusations, like he's tanking or something. Nene has never been a quitter, he's been a great team player, leading by example, he helped this franchise become a professional organization again back when we desperately needed it. I'm sure he's 1000% more frustrated with his own play than any of the fans. Don't understand why people would pile on when one of our best players is having a bad stretch. Maybe he needs to get benched (I don't believe this, but reasonable people can disagree on this), but that's much different than saying he doesn't give a fuck."

washingtonwizards,350k5e,happyflappypancakes,9,Wed May 6 02:50:09 2015 UTC,"Not a bad loss. No such thing as a good loss, but I think we are seeing that ATL isn't playing all too well."
washingtonwizards,350k5e,i_woke_up_like_this_,5,Wed May 6 02:43:06 2015 UTC,"That's the silver lining of tonight. We got pretty close without Wall. Next game, we're at home and hopefully Wall will have recovered."
washingtonwizards,350k5e,DWood10,19,Wed May 6 02:46:55 2015 UTC,"Shoutout to everyone but Nene. They fought all game. Nene shouldn't even play. Start Gooden, play Hump a little and have Pierce play stretch 4  Hate bashing the dude but damn he was awful"
washingtonwizards,350k5e,happyflappypancakes,7,Wed May 6 02:34:11 2015 UTC,"Which sucks, because he can be such a great player when his midrange is sinking. Let's him get to the rim easier too."
washingtonwizards,350k5e,Yeti60,2,Wed May 6 02:43:49 2015 UTC,"We need to see the resurrection of Brazilian Jesus.  Nene is so fun to watch when he's blocking shots, doing some nasty dunks, trash talking, and making amazing passes out of the post.    Unfortunately we haven't seen any of that.  Especially the passing, he's had so many turnovers off of bad passes.    Another thing is that he just doesn't look like he has the fire anymore.  He's not animated and bitching at the refs and involved emotionally it looks like.  He seems pretty passive, which is weird for him.  Hopefully we can get the old Nene back soon."

washingtonwizards,350k5e,smilezandsouthstar,6,Wed May 6 02:45:19 2015 UTC,"Back to hating Randy just like that, guys? Damn.  You see how much Gregg Popovich trusted his washed old guys in the first round? No coach is gonna bench a veteran starter he has a relationship until he feels some real fucking pain. Maybe this loss is it. But Kris Humphries wasn't gonna save tonight."
washingtonwizards,350k5e,Mehberry,2,Wed May 6 03:16:34 2015 UTC,If it helps I've been waiting and watching for playoff Wittman jokes to stop so I could resume shitting on him.  Plus I've been bitter about Nene for a long while. Perfect combo.
washingtonwizards,350k5e,smilezandsouthstar,3,Wed May 6 03:30:01 2015 UTC,"You're consistent, I'll give you that.  I wish Nene was being a bad person or something instead of just a bad basketball player. It would make accepting this a lot easier for me."
washingtonwizards,350k5e,Mehberry,1 point,Wed May 6 03:50:24 2015 UTC,"It's weird. If anything we've rested him more over the course of the season. We haven't played him much at center, and we've tried to ease off his playoff minutes a bit. I've been frustrated with him for a while but this is Hibbert playoffs level dropoff."

washingtonwizards,350k5e,anon__sequitur,3,Wed May 6 03:25:54 2015 UTC,"Atlanta doesn't really look like a very good team. Our offense was really, really bad tonight, and we had a chance to win midway through the fourth quarter. Assuming Wall is healthy by Saturday, I think we are in a great position. I mean, how can Atlanta play like this when they were basically in a must win game? Aside from their injuries, they just don't look like a 60-win team, the way they (fail to) move the ball, bad shots, etc. Now, if they are just working through something and get back to mid-season form, we're screwed. But it looks more like they've lost something."

If you go to the boxoffice or ticketmaster.com you can get the tickets at face value.  Upper level seats are always $40.  There is literally no point in getting tickets outside of maybe stubhub or scorebig, and ticketmaster."

washingtonwizards,34wbog,BagelsAndJewce,13,Tue May 5 05:50:55 2015 UTC,"Here's how this plays out:   Tomorrow afternoon, the Wizards (fresh off a 2nd win in ATL tonight) decide to attend the Nats' matinee against the Marlins. Keeping with the tradition, they all sit in the front row of Section 129, directly behind the Nats' dugout. Down 3-2 in the bottom of the eighth, Bryce Harper hits a two-run HR. All the Wizards get up and cheer along with everyone else. Pierce starts his arm-waving ""get loud"" routine and the Nats' crowd goes nuts. Thomas Boswell posts his 368th consecutive tweet about ""special times in DC"". As he soaks it in, Pierce doesn't notice that Ryan Zimmerman has come up to bat. Zim fouls his first pitch off, directly into Pierce's head. Pierce falls over, instantly unconscious, into Beal's lap. Beal sprains his groin while trying to hold up Pierce's weight. Nene, having never watched a baseball game before and not understanding the rules, thinks that's his cue to defend his fallen teammate. He jumps over the dugout, sprints over to Zim, and performs his famed jiujitsu headlock move. Zim crumples over and a melee ensues. Yunel Escobar (5-for-5 last night) breaks his hand in the fight, Jayson Werth somehow tears an ACL, Harper's hair is moved out of its perfect alignment, the Nats are forced to forfeit the game, and the only players not ejected from the Nats or the Wizards are Drew Storen, Tyler Moore, Garrett Temple, DeJuan Blair, Teddy Roosevelt and G-Man.  The Capitals are watching all of this on TVs at the Verizon Center while preparing for their Game 4 against the Rangers. News reports leak out: riots in the Navy Yard area, on 7th Street NW, all throughout the city. Frustrated fans of both the Nats and Wizards are just burning the city down. All of the Caps slowly retreat back to their lockers and start to take off their gear. They know how this is going to end: No Game 4, series shifts back to MSG, momentum is lost. They end up playing the next three games in NYC while DC goes under martial law, losing them all by a combined score of 23-2. It's over, the dream is over. Meanwhile, somewhere in a secret bunker near Ashburn, Dan Snyder cackles. His devious plan to destroy all other DC sports teams has succeeded once again! He takes out his checkbook made of panda fur and Cherokee tears, and writes out a $10 million check to the mastermind behind it all: Colin Cowherd. It was Cowherd who planned all of this for years, from drafting Jan Vesely to Jay Beagle's double-deflection goal that gave locals hope to putting Drew Storen in against the Cardinals in Game 5 in 2012 and against the Giants in Game 2 last year. Cowherd controls everything in DC, and only Snyder and Vinny Cerrato knew it all along.   ""Money well spent,"" Snyder mumbles. NFL season is only four months away, so join the 50,000-person waiting list now."
washingtonwizards,34wbog,Obersts001,3,Tue May 5 13:44:06 2015 UTC,"I have faith in the Caps to make it to the next round, and I think the Wizards and Hawks is going to come down to the wire, with our guys winning in 6  As for the Nats, they seem to be on the right track again after a rough start.

Yesterday was even almost the same score (104-98 instead of 102-96). Jesus Christ, that's scary.

washingtonwizards,34tfks,sunbear0326,2,Mon May 4 13:18:31 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if I want this to be true or not
washingtonwizards,34tfks,Virulentt,5,Mon May 4 16:38:25 2015 UTC,Is anyone still waiting for the other shoe to drop? I feel like I'm on an amazing streak at the craps table just waiting for something bad to happen.
washingtonwizards,34tfks,foghornbutthorn,13,Mon May 4 16:35:15 2015 UTC,"This postseason is still way too close to last year's postseason to get too excited.   46 wins in the regular season vs. 44 last year #5 seed both years - opponents were pretty happy to see us in the first round Surprisingly easy first round victories - last year Chicago in 5, this year Toronto in 4 #1 seed took much longer to advance than expected - last year Indiana in 7, this year Atlanta in 6 Wizards win the 2nd round Game 1 on the road   Last year, it all fell apart in Game 2 vs. the Pacers -- an ugly but winnable game where the Wiz led in the 4th but couldn't put it away, Wall shot 2-13 from the field, and the team only shot 5-12 from the line. Then the home games were both disasters for different reasons: Game 3 was the ugliest game I have ever paid to go see in my lifetime, and Game 4 featured a blown 19-point lead.   If we lose Game 2, it's not the end of the world, but then Game 3 becomes a must-win psychologically. Can't repeat last year's debacles at home."
washingtonwizards,34tfks,Obersts001,3,Mon May 4 17:00:38 2015 UTC,I think the difference though is that both Wall and Beal have shot much better. Especially Wall who really only had like 1 good/great game last playoffs.
washingtonwizards,34tfks,MegaSupremeTaco,1 point,Mon May 4 18:35:19 2015 UTC,That game 3 was terrible. And I sat through the whole thing.
washingtonwizards,34tfks,guga31bb,1 point,Mon May 4 19:00:13 2015 UTC,I was just thinking the same thing. Indiana decided to wake up against us. I'm crossing my fingers that Atlanta doesn't play up to their potential because they're a better team when firing on all cylinders.
washingtonwizards,34tfks,CapnMorgan1,1 point,Mon May 4 22:04:47 2015 UTC,"We were locked up last year, but now the Truth has set us free. There's the game changing difference."
washingtonwizards,34tfks,kingClutch98,0,Tue May 5 00:58:02 2015 UTC,The other shoe is when we keep Randy Wittman for next season.
washingtonwizards,34tfks,Knyfe-Wrench,3,Mon May 4 16:41:27 2015 UTC,Maybe he feeds off on the hate. You guys should continue trying to get rid of him...
washingtonwizards,34tfks,puroloco,2,Mon May 4 17:30:56 2015 UTC,THE WITTMAN HATE HAS GOT TO STOP

washingtonwizards,34tfks,KappaMcPussy,1 point,Mon May 4 22:34:03 2015 UTC,We all got got by Wittman of all people
washingtonwizards,34tfks,DWood10,-2,Mon May 4 18:52:31 2015 UTC,"I still say fire him. We swept a Raptors team that played down to our February level and we took game game 1 from a Hawks that that struggled with the Nets. The same Nets who's head coach said in his end of year talk ""Our PG isn't a franchise guy"". The winning is nice, but it's not like he's developed a smooth offense; rather we are currently one of the hottest portions of the tire fire know as the Eastern conference"
washingtonwizards,34ulmu,WizOfAwesSite,1 point,Mon May 4 18:15:07 2015 UTC,"Just to add about Beal, he's instrumental in guarding Korver. I don't expect Korver to brick open 3s consistently but Beal hounds him and makes him work for every shot. Much rather Korver shooting contested 3s than open looks, and besides Beal no one can guard him. Maybe Otto but Otto's job will be stopping Carroll IMO"
washingtonwizards,34u9d2,WizOfAwesSite,1 point,Mon May 4 16:43:04 2015 UTC,any chance we look to move nene in the offseason? his 13 mil a year contract could be put to use in other ways.
washingtonwizards,34u9d2,ruffus4life,1 point,Mon May 4 21:46:42 2015 UTC,"His contract will expire when KD becomes available, no? Also, I'd look to keep Nene after his contract expires on a short term, cheap deal. The upcoming NBA Draft will be another way to land a big. Basically, the Wizards have options."
washingtonwizards,34u9d2,Boymankid,1 point,Mon May 4 22:04:14 2015 UTC,"The Wiz wouldn't move Nene unless it was for another expiring. Whether it's KD or another prized FA, the Wiz have set themselves up nicely to make a play for someone after next year, while still having the core of Wall, Beal, Porter, and Gortat"
washingtonwizards,34ucwr,SlickDickWilly42,1 point,Mon May 4 17:09:58 2015 UTC,"None of the games in this series are sold out yet in either city, so why bother with the secondary market? Just go to the box office and you can buy Saturday Game 3 tickets for as low as $35."

washingtonwizards,34qth3,kamikazemelonman,7,Sun May 3 22:09:29 2015 UTC,12 and 12 for Gortat isn't bad seeing as he only played the second half
washingtonwizards,34qth3,a_child_to_criticize,1 point,Mon May 4 02:43:10 2015 UTC,ha!  He missed a few absolute sitters in the first half. But if he plays like he did in the second half for this series then that'll be okay.

washingtonwizards,34rz5v,AtTheFuneralParty,1 point,Mon May 4 09:55:52 2015 UTC,"While it is true about his age and durability being an issue, I think bad match ups are being overlooked. Nene is an old school PF who can't really stretch the defense. He has a solid mid-range game but is more of a banger. So far in the playoffs we have faced teams that have speedier 3-point shooting PFs and Nene is just a little too slow and a little too old to be effective against these guys. As we saw against Chicago, Nene can match up really well against some teams, and not so well against others. If we play Chicago next round, I see Nene making a much larger contribution."

The way he can manage to run the game without filling up a stat-sheet really is fun to watch and because of his knee injury he relies much more on being crafty then athleticism. Which in my opinion is more entertaining than Wall. Just my 2 cents"

washingtonwizards,34n6sa,pakilicious,3,Sat May 2 18:14:24 2015 UTC,"Good notes, can't wait for the series. What do u think about Otto chasing Korver given his length?  Also do u expect Humphries to get more minutes than last series.   Thanks. Go wiz"
washingtonwizards,34n6sa,Stumpzzz,2,Sat May 2 18:28:37 2015 UTC,Thanks! I think Otto can check Korver but Beal will have to contain Carroll.  Humphries should get a few minutes given his rebounding prowess. Only thing is Gooden can shoot the 3 now so more pressure on Kris to perform.
washingtonwizards,34nt8g,WizOfAwesSite,3,Sat May 2 21:35:47 2015 UTC,"After a careful analysis and reading of all the material out there about this second round matchup, I have reached the conclusion that in order for us to beat the Hawks, we will need to stop them from being their best and be better than them. Only then can we win."

washingtonwizards,34l3fc,WizOfAwesSite,15,Sat May 2 02:37:58 2015 UTC,"I like our odds a lot. Don't get me wrong Atlanta had a great season, but playoffs are a whole different ballgame. It's amazing what they did, but I think the Wiz outmatch them at nearly every position (except the 3 spot due to hot sauce Kyle Korver). Beal will be a huge indicator on how this series is going to go, but if the Wizards can keep Toronto momentum going...I like the Wizards in 6 max  Edit: 1 downvote already for expressing an opinion. Are there some salty Hawks fans patrolling over here?"
washingtonwizards,34l3fc,pankpankpank,3,Sat May 2 03:52:42 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I think we have great odds here. Atlanta struggled quite a bit in this series. The Nets' frontcourt gave Atlanta some troubles and I think we can do more of the same.  Anyway, I'm so excited for this series! I have no doubt in my mind we're an ECF team if we can play like we did in the Toronto series."
washingtonwizards,34l3fc,Shaidester,2,Sat May 2 04:29:23 2015 UTC,"You guys should have a boatload of film now to study for how to play the Hawks offense b/w games 1-5 and Hawks/Spurs in March.  I know the Wizards focus is there since they have been so good defensively all season, but we'll have to see if they have the BBIQ and instinct to pull it off.  Allowing 106, 120, and 105 again isn't going to cut it (I threw out the game at the end of the season since the Hawks benched Korver, Teague, Horford, and Carroll)."
washingtonwizards,34l3fc,Orgcore,1 point,Sat May 2 04:49:56 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree. Although this Wizards team is playing with a lot more spark than they had during the regular season. They were streaky as hell, and then all of a sudden caught fire. For example, Toronto also swept us during the regular season and look how that turned out.   I think its going to be a really fun series, Teague and Wall seem to bring out the best offense in each other. As I said Beal will be absolutely crucial in his offensive output, because if he doesn't its sometimes just not enough to pull through. Pierce also has to come through defensively, as defense isn't necessarily Otto's strong suit, and we can't let Korver especially get hot. In the front court, Gortat has been huge in the playoff's so I like his matchup with Horford. Nene is extremely inconsistent, so Millsap could cause some trouble at the 4, but we'll see how the rotations work out.   I think its going to be a great series, but if the Wizards remain hot they are going to be tough to beat. This isn't the same team as the regular season, they've finally hit full stride."
washingtonwizards,34l3fc,pankpankpank,1 point,Sat May 2 06:47:33 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say you outmatch us at every position but I do think it's going to be a tough series for both teams and will likely go to 6 or 7 games.
washingtonwizards,34l3fc,bearg0d,2,Sat May 2 05:04:06 2015 UTC,I wrote that in when there were literally no comments and a down vote...but thanks for chiming in Jesus From The South
washingtonwizards,34l3fc,pankpankpank,2,Sat May 2 11:22:03 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure we have some sort of record for away game win percentage so I'm not worried about home court advantage for the Hawks. I'm pretty confident we can make this a good series. I say we make it to the ECF in 6:)
washingtonwizards,34l3fc,plasmamaker,2,Sat May 2 11:31:22 2015 UTC,"Sorry Hawks fans, but my senses are telling me Wizards in 5, after winning the first two in Atlanta"

washingtonwizards,34l3fc,madlate,2,Sat May 2 07:56:39 2015 UTC,"If we get the Hawks that played in Games 1-4 of that series, we have a decent shot. If we get the Games 5-6 Hawks, we don't."
washingtonwizards,34l3fc,Obersts001,1 point,Sat May 2 04:46:08 2015 UTC,"I disagree. To be honest, Brooklyn is a pretty shit team...and they were able to take them to 7 games. Regular season records don't mean shit, and Atlanta loves to live by the 3 and die by the 3. If our perimeter defense steps up, I think we definitely have a shot.   I'm more worried about ""playoff"" wizards showing up, versus what version of the hawks will show up. The hawks are completely beatable"
washingtonwizards,34l3fc,pankpankpank,1 point,Sat May 2 11:20:46 2015 UTC,"playoff wizards can easily not show up though. that's all i'm saying, don't be over confident that our play against toronto will be how we play against atlanta. there's no guarantees."

washingtonwizards,34hqk0,mjtegethoff,3,Fri May 1 08:23:46 2015 UTC,"I'd have to guess that what he's avoiding saying is that he didn't do this because he did not trust his other options at the 3 (Otto, Rasual, Martell) for the majority of the season, and thus didn't want Pierce playing starter minutes at the 3 and backup minutes at the 4."

washingtonwizards,34elb9,aznanimedude,2,Thu Apr 30 17:27:12 2015 UTC,"Young has been good as a backup.  Blatche would have been a good backup (he was with the Nets) if he didn't take those mid-range jumpers but yeah he was overpaid.  McGee has one of the lowest basketball IQs ever, at least the Wizards got Nene."
washingtonwizards,34elb9,A2daRon,2,Thu Apr 30 19:33:32 2015 UTC,i don't miss him the slightest bit
washingtonwizards,34ecow,bmckay3,29,Thu Apr 30 13:34:04 2015 UTC,"Shame on you, letting your marriage get in the way of Wizards playoffs."
washingtonwizards,34ecow,pakilicious,8,Thu Apr 30 13:47:34 2015 UTC,"The only thing I have seen is a date for when the 1st game will be. If Atlanta wins on Friday and closes out, the 1st game will be on Sunday in ATL. If Brooklyn wins on Friday and forces a game 7 (which would be Sunday), then the 1st game will be on Tuesday either in ATL or in WAS.   Haven't seen word on any other days, but my guess would be either a Sunday-Wednesday-Friday/Saturday.......or a Tuesday-Friday-Sunday. So you might luck out.   And if she won't let you watch the game during your wedding, she's not the right one.           I kid, I kid"

washingtonwizards,34ecow,mannytabloid,5,Thu Apr 30 14:41:21 2015 UTC,i nominate this for most helpful comment ever of all time
washingtonwizards,34ecow,Fresnel_diffraction,4,Thu Apr 30 15:38:44 2015 UTC,"Ha, I'm with you - my parents are visiting next weekend and I can't leave them for a Saturday matinee. Here's my educated guess, based on the three possible outcomes:  ATL in 6: Sunday 5/3 1 pm in ATL, Tue 5/5 in ATL, Friday 5/8 in DC, Sunday 5/10 12 noon in DC. I say 12 noon for Game 4 because the Caps' Game 6 vs. NYR is scheduled for VC on the same day, so they'll need to do the quick turnaround for an 8 pm start there. And, they wouldn't put the hockey in the early slot because of the risk of multiple OTs. Ted wouldn't like this because of the Game 3 overlap with Caps' Game 5 in NY, and NBC will not like needing to put Caps / Rangers on NBCSN on a Sunday night, but ESPN needs a Friday night NBA doubleheader and Disney would certainly prefer to put Cleveland vs. Chicago on ABC Saturday.  ATL in 7: Tue 5/5 in ATL, Thu 5/7 in ATL, Sat 5/9 in DC, Tue 5/12 in DC. I shorten the time frame here between games 1-2-3 because the league will want to get moving on the series, and the ECF must start by May 20th. Scheduling Game 3 on Saturday allows the VC crew ample time to switch over from Saturday basketball to what would likely be a Sunday midday hockey game for NBC's broadcast - NBC surely loves the Caps / Rangers series and will prefer to have that on national broadcast TV. Also note that in this calendar, there is zero overlap between Caps' playoff games and Wizards' games, which Ted would most certainly prefer.  BRK in 7: Tue 5/5 in DC, Thu 5/7 in DC, Sat 5/9 or Sun 5/10 in BRK, Tue 5/12 in BRK. Basically the ATL series reversed, but this matchup will have limited appeal to ABC so expect none of these games to be on broadcast TV."

washingtonwizards,34ckqy,mannytabloid,1 point,Thu Apr 30 12:27:35 2015 UTC,"This won't help his name. Now he's the guy that got into a gun-showoff contest with a convicted murderer. Makes his judgment look even worse.  More than likely... his reputation does not go up or down. But if there was an impact, his reputation would not be improved."
washingtonwizards,34ckqy,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:09:36 2015 UTC,"Gil acted stupid, but let's look at this objectively.  Gil is the team leader, and Crit is being an asshole thug threatening to shoot one of the young'uns; namely McGee.  Arenas decides that he is going to show Crit if you're gonna talk the talk; than walk it. Arenas more than likely didn't realize that Crit would shoot him and pulled out a gun on him. That escalated the already stupid situation.  Arenas looks so much better now that this entire story has come out. Crit is a scumbag idiot but Arenas is just an idiot."
washingtonwizards,34ckqy,DreadLockedHaitian,2,Thu Apr 30 17:14:05 2015 UTC,"IMO he looks better RELATIVE TO Crit, he doesn't look better in general."

washingtonwizards,34ckqy,madlate,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:37:50 2015 UTC,True. What could have been if Gil and Caron didn't get injured within a week of each other.

washingtonwizards,34cj27,madlate,2,Thu Apr 30 02:47:29 2015 UTC,I want to play the rockets cause my friend is a fan. They won't make it though. It's gonna be the Spurs or Warriors.

The Grizzlies are the only team I really like that are left, so I guess them. I wouldn't mind the Rockets either because I like Dwight and Smoove.  Assuming the Wizards were in the finals (DEAR GOD), I think we would make it a series against anyone but Warriors and Spurs, unless Parker fully breaks himself before the Finals"

washingtonwizards,34cj27,yaboymattyk,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:16:22 2015 UTC,Clips! Don't care for the whole whiny sentiment because a lot of teams do that. I feel like they parallel our team the most in terms of players by position (Them obviously having most of the better versions).   Elite pass first point guards (Wall~Paul)  Two athletic bigs (Nene Gortat~Deandre Blake)  Length guy off the bench (Otto-Jamal)  Sharp shooting 2 guards (Beal ~Reddick)  Polarizing fowards (Pierce-Barnes)  Unpolished backup points (Sessions-Rivers)  Fat guys (Blair~Big Baby)
washingtonwizards,34cj27,youngsaiyan,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:58:04 2015 UTC,When you put it that way the Wiz would def beat them. Also don't compare Blair and Big Baby. Blair would kick the shit out of him.

washingtonwizards,346zmv,Massi123,4,Tue Apr 28 21:06:22 2015 UTC,"Seconded. Let's hope the Nets/Hawks series goes to game 7. And Cavs/Bulls too, I don't see Milwaukee winning at this point."
washingtonwizards,346zmv,Fragwizzard,3,Tue Apr 28 22:34:23 2015 UTC,I personally want the Bulls to win just because I want them to upset the Cavs
washingtonwizards,346zmv,kmhokies35,2,Wed Apr 29 00:19:16 2015 UTC,I don't have anything with either team hence I want a tough 7 game series that weakens the winner.
washingtonwizards,346zmv,Fragwizzard,3,Wed Apr 29 00:50:05 2015 UTC,"Don't go looking ahead to the ECF already. Yikes, we know what happens to a team that does that."
washingtonwizards,346zmv,happyflappypancakes,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:13:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know, one series at a time. Still, the whole thing is very very open. Playoffs, anything's possible. (And I want my Wall jersey dammit)"
washingtonwizards,346zmv,Fragwizzard,6,Wed Apr 29 18:19:14 2015 UTC,"Hawks may be getting tired, but you have to remember that there is a massive, massive gulf between the coaching quality of Dwane Casey and Mike Budenholzer. Even before the series against the raps started, it was widely assumed that either Wittman or Casey would be on the chopping block at the end. Wittman's got star power, but Budenholzer's got the coaching chops.  tl;dr round 2 is basically Spurs/Clippers of the East."
washingtonwizards,346zmv,logitaunt,3,Tue Apr 28 23:06:57 2015 UTC,"I always thought we had the talent to make the ECF, and that's still my goal. Also, if we get there we have to win at least a game. No getting swept"
washingtonwizards,346zmv,Boymankid,2,Tue Apr 28 23:08:56 2015 UTC,My Wall Los Wizards jersey will arrive before the second round starts so hopefully it'll bring some extra luck.
washingtonwizards,346zmv,Fragwizzard,3,Wed Apr 29 01:00:35 2015 UTC,Round 2 exit will be a letdown unfortunately. They have been before and it's anticlimactic. Want conf finals- very legit goal indeed. Anything beyond is icing on a good season. I still think we are a player (and maybe a stronger coach) away from a shot at playing in the Finals- and a big name FA to compete in the finals
washingtonwizards,346zmv,LexisNexiss,3,Wed Apr 29 02:56:34 2015 UTC,I don't think we beat the Hawks next round. They owned us in the regular season real bad. But I think we can beat the Nets or Bucks and sliding Cavs or Bulls teams to make it to the Finals.
washingtonwizards,346zmv,fuck_your_dumb_cat,3,Wed Apr 29 04:03:51 2015 UTC,"They are still different teams, but the Raptors also destroyed us in the regular season. No reason we can't beat the hawks"

washingtonwizards,346zmv,CDub22EP,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:58:57 2015 UTC,I'm not saying we can but we have something they lack - star power. John Wall
washingtonwizards,346zmv,Boymankid,2,Thu Apr 30 05:50:25 2015 UTC,"I think at this point Conference Finals is the expectation, looking around the East so far I can even see NBA Finals. Wiz have plenty of rest/prep time, Hawks-Nets is going to go at least 6 and yes, they both won the season series with us, but so did Toronto and look how that turned out.  I think the Bucks will take the Bulls to 7 (who knows how their health will hold up), and the way the Cavs had been clicking with Love, I'm not sure LeBron & Kyrie can carry the team through a grind-it-out series with Chicago. Even if they can, I'll take the Wiz vs. a banged up Cavs or Bulls team in the ECF."
washingtonwizards,346zmv,whitennerdy898,2,Wed Apr 29 05:38:55 2015 UTC,I see a Cavs-Wizards conference final. With all due respect to the Nets the Hawks should be finishing that series in 5 & its looking likely that it cud be a 7 game series. Its still a winnable one for the Wizards (i see the Wizards in 6).
washingtonwizards,346zmv,Mehberry,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:20:25 2015 UTC,I'm gonna fucking cackle if we make ECF after how we deflated over the course of the regular season.  Sweeping the recently historically strong (against us) Raptors and getting a weakened one seed or an 8 seed for the 2nd? This shit is glorious.  Hell even the ECF might be weak if we got there between Chicago lagging and Love being out for the Cavs.

washingtonwizards,343u1a,KingBroly,4,Tue Apr 28 04:08:08 2015 UTC,"I was weirded out when Pierce was signed. I didn't think he fit in and thought he'd be traded pretty quick. Man, was I ever wrong."
washingtonwizards,343u1a,BagelsAndJewce,2,Tue Apr 28 12:50:11 2015 UTC,I never had doubt about him fitting. We were a mildly old team with a young core. What we needed was a grizzled playoff veteran that was still hungry for more. We got that in Pierce ad every other potential signing would have put us in an awkward position for 2016 and maybe not been as effective.

washingtonwizards,346c38,kmhokies35,5,Tue Apr 28 17:54:55 2015 UTC,"It's a fair assessment. The Raptors were so awful in the series that it somewhat obfuscated any real improvements the Wizards made. However, some things will still be true going into Round 2  Pierce will still play the stretch 4.  Otto will probably continue producing results, as he had in the stretch leading up to the playoffs.   Gortat in the 4th.   So we know the improvements are there on paper, but we have yet to see how that plays out against a team that doesn't collapse like a flan in a cupboard. They could make a huge difference, or we might be relegated back to a ton of midrange jumpers. There's really no way to tell until Game 1 against Atlanta, so I'm still celebrating the sweep.   Besides, does any of us really buy 100% that Wittman played possum for an entire regular season?"

Simmons is in a unique situation where he isn't quite a journalist but is regarded more highly than your run of the mill blogger.  He pretty much has to stick by his guns on issues or else he'll get called out reguarly.  He also reguarly praises the city of DC as one of his favorites to visit."

washingtonwizards,346c38,_masterofdisaster,8,Tue Apr 28 20:40:22 2015 UTC,"Well at first I was in the same boat as you but I was looking over some game tape of the series and I definitely noticed that Wittman's ""take what the defense gives you"" offense was in full effect, it just so happens to be that Toronto's defense was so poor they were giving up threes instead of the midrange like most team. So there's definitely an argument for that side.  Also Simmons definitely likes us.

I watch just about every episode of The Starters and they are barely mentioned at all.. Which makes it that much better that we beat the shit out of the Raptors.

washingtonwizards,341468,tundey_1,4,Mon Apr 27 14:59:09 2015 UTC,"I am not a hater but I wouldn't assume he's changed. He basically used the Nets tactics against Toronto with The Truth at the stretch 4 position. And also got Bradley Beal to be more assertive. I'll also give him credit for giving Otto Porter more playing time. But come next season, I wouldn't be surprised to see Wittman reverting back to form."
washingtonwizards,341468,pakilicious,1 point,Mon Apr 27 15:28:04 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree w/ you.  Playoff Wittman is the same guy that had us beat Chicago by mid-range jumpers.    Also, he may have felt OK going small vs Toronto but will he be okay w/ putting Pierce on Paul Millsap?  Can Otto guard Millsap while Pierce is on Demarre Carroll?  That's a key question."

washingtonwizards,341468,Kirbybajerby,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:41:03 2015 UTC,Is Wittman really adapting his game plan or are more shots simply going in?  Wittman has been making good lineup changes by playing Marcin and Otto and also playing Pierce at 4. But I've still seen a few dreaded Wittman-esque half court sets that start with swinging the ball around the perimeter and ends up back in Walls hands for a long 2.
washingtonwizards,341468,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:58:05 2015 UTC,"The mix of shots that Washington is taking has changed in the playoffs - it's not just shots going in.

washingtonwizards,341st4,Zomby24,4,Mon Apr 27 17:18:06 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that while the wins have been impressive Toronto has been reeling for a while. Wittman is basically a good enough coach to get the 2nd round in the current East, which isn't really saying too much"
washingtonwizards,341st4,Brim4889,2,Mon Apr 27 17:58:19 2015 UTC,"Coach Bud's Hawks vs Randy Wittman's Wizards... Both talented teams but, as far as coaching goes, it will be tough to even compare the two-Coach Bud is on another level."
washingtonwizards,341st4,StaffSgtDignam,4,Mon Apr 27 18:00:12 2015 UTC,Last night we were fucking hungry dogs. Hopefully we keep that mentality going in to play Atlanta.
washingtonwizards,341st4,540Cameron,2,Mon Apr 27 18:50:28 2015 UTC,"We are all feeling great now, sweeping the Raptors when most people seemed to think they'd take the series. It's great to see the team come together and dominate four playoff games in a row, this team is tough and defensive minded, things Wittman really needs to get credit for. We shouldn't forget that for the better part of THREE DECADES, the Wizards were a soft team, that even when we had talent, good teams could dominate us mentally.  That being said, the Wizards have so much talent, and the East is so mediocre, getting to the 2nd round isn't enough. He's gotta take us to the Conference Finals before I'd be satisfied with giving him another year."
washingtonwizards,341st4,anon__sequitur,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:33:39 2015 UTC,I have thought that he deserves to at least play out his contract. This next series could buy him another contract if he can get us to the eastern finals.

washingtonwizards,341st4,DWood10,1 point,Mon Apr 27 22:28:30 2015 UTC,"What last season showed us is that there's talent enough to get to the 2nd round, coach or no coach.  That being said, Randy looked good this series. Had us shooting 3s, playing aggressive D, and put PP at the 4 (FINALLY!).   This series (assuming it's ATL) shows us what he's made of. We are talented - perhaps more talented than Atlanta. But they have a top tier coach. He gets the best out of his guys and gets victories. If Randy is a good coach, he will do better than he did in the 2nd round last year. We will compete, not based on talent, which is why we even won a game against the Pacers. We will compete, and maybe win the series, if Randy proves he is a good coach.   Dwane Casey is horrendous. I don't think he's worse than Randy but Casey refused to make adjustments. Playoff basketball is all about adjustments. You can bet Coach Bud will be adjusting to whatever we throw at them, and we need Randy to do the same. If Randy can get this series to 6 or 7, and perhaps win it, then maybe he's the guy.   If we win a game or less and everything is riding on John's back, then Randy has to go. John is an elite player but coaching is the biggest thing in the playoffs.   TL;DR Randy might be deserve to be the coach, but only if he proves it this series"

Winning a series against a team with another bad coach does not mean that you are a good coach. Especially when your team is this talented.

washingtonwizards,33ymzo,540Cameron,3,Mon Apr 27 00:42:55 2015 UTC,God I love Sessions as the backup. Miller was just way too slow. Would of loved Nate Robinson as the backup but Sessions is great.
washingtonwizards,33ymzo,Boymankid,3,Mon Apr 27 00:53:36 2015 UTC,"Also Sesh plays D, neither Miller nor Nate do that either"
washingtonwizards,33ymzo,540Cameron,2,Mon Apr 27 00:54:47 2015 UTC,Yeah thats the part that separates him. I definitely was on the Nate hype train though lol.
washingtonwizards,33ymzo,Boymankid,2,Mon Apr 27 00:55:33 2015 UTC,Yeah if we could've got the Nate from a couple years ago that would've been great but I think he's just not the same after an injury

washingtonwizards,33ymzo,andrew02020,2,Sun Apr 26 23:19:05 2015 UTC,I love big man assists. Interior passing is the best.
washingtonwizards,33ymzo,Boymankid,2,Sun Apr 26 23:19:13 2015 UTC,Y'all this is what team ball looks like. Look at the Raps. Yeah they got 5 from Lou this quarter but he doesn't even look at his teammates on those possessions. Meanwhile our guys do make that extra pass
washingtonwizards,33ymzo,dubatronic,2,Sun Apr 26 23:22:32 2015 UTC,The fucking ref caught the ball

washingtonwizards,33ymzo,Boymankid,2,Mon Apr 27 00:33:25 2015 UTC,"Good trade. Miller was not the right fit, he slowed down the game too much and wasn't playing well for us.   Sesh has been exactly what we needed. Plays D, pushes the ball on O, and can knock down some long jumpers when he's on the floor with Wall.   I understand Miller was doing fine for SAC so I would say it was a fair swap, certainly Sesh has been better than people said. He just needed a change of scenery"
washingtonwizards,33ymzo,andrew02020,2,Mon Apr 27 00:33:37 2015 UTC,"The best trades are the ones that help both teams, and this sounds like one of them. Thanks for the response."

washingtonwizards,33ymzo,toneloc418,1 point,Mon Apr 27 00:59:23 2015 UTC,I feel like Gortat's outlet passes aren't praised enough. It seems like this entire series he's been finding Wall super quick out of rebounds and helping him get out in front for those fastbreak points.

washingtonwizards,33zekb,TweetPoster,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:50:13 2015 UTC,"Why can't the Wizards hire an offensive ""guru"" for Wittman? He's the only guy that's gotten a Wizards team to play defense in decades, so what if he's not the brightest on offense? Get him some help...what's Eddie Jordan doing these days?"
washingtonwizards,33zknq,PhilDunphy_,3,Mon Apr 27 02:44:24 2015 UTC,"I feel like it's chatter right now but could change. Obviously I would love for him to come here, but at this point there's no way of knowing. We'll just have to see how the Thunder's season unfolds and see how the Wizards do for the rest of the postseason/next year"

washingtonwizards,33zknq,Boymankid,2,Mon Apr 27 04:07:33 2015 UTC,"I personally believe he's a homer regardless. I'm sure he's at his home here in the DC area cheering the Wizards on.

washingtonwizards,33trjz,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,1 point,Sat Apr 25 18:27:24 2015 UTC,I'm more saying that a deeper rotation than 8 would be helpful. Hump can do plenty more that Gooden can't. Like run. They both an contribute.

washingtonwizards,33trjz,GibbsAH,13,Sat Apr 25 22:55:33 2015 UTC,"We've got to use at least Seraphin to rest Gortat some. Nene is not a 5 (and a mediocre 4 lately, anyway) and Kris would be nice as well."
washingtonwizards,33trjz,guga31bb,3,Sat Apr 25 16:18:34 2015 UTC,Gortat will have over a week of rest after the wiz win in 4
washingtonwizards,33trjz,Mehberry,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:58:18 2015 UTC,Gortat played 42 minutes last night. Seems about right for a playoff game. I'm fine with KS and Hump not playing.
washingtonwizards,33trjz,guga31bb,3,Sat Apr 25 22:43:12 2015 UTC,"But does he necessarily have to? Even if Seraphin only plays 6 minutes, so long as he isn't atrocious that gives Gortat some very valuable rest. So long as we don't pull a Yankees, Atlanta will have the deeper bench to use against us and be finishing the game with more rested starters."
washingtonwizards,33trjz,Mehberry,2,Sat Apr 25 22:55:27 2015 UTC,"Of people who can possibly play the 4 or 5, the minutes distribution last night was   Nene 23 Pierce 27 Gortat 42 Gooden 18   In an ideal world, Nene wouldn't have been in foul trouble, so give him a couple extra minutes an Gortat a couple less. Seems fine to me. Say Nene 25 + Gortat 40. I don't think I'd want to take 6 of Gortat's minutes and give them to KS. Gortat is so much better on both ends."
washingtonwizards,33trjz,purpleflow,4,Sat Apr 25 23:01:14 2015 UTC,A rested Gortat is absolutely better. But 6 tired Gortat minutes might not necessarily be better than 6 rested Seraphin minutes.  Nene is so awkward at the 5 (and IMO the 4 but that's an aside) that it's practically willful bleeding putting him there to rest Marcin.
washingtonwizards,33trjz,Mehberry,3,Sat Apr 25 23:20:17 2015 UTC,"i would rather play Gortat most of the first quarter. and have kevin come in with like 2-3 mins at the end of first quarter.  Then have him start in the second for another 2-3 mins.  That way if he is hott we leave him in there, otherwise Gortat should be playing 38+ mins.  Gortat > KS rested or not"
washingtonwizards,33trjz,LexisNexiss,2,Sat Apr 25 23:26:31 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with that. 6 is an arbitrary number, I just want a little bit. If KS gets hot every second of him on the floor is still a net positive and valuable rest for Marcin. I'd just rather not have our starters have to go full Clippers unless they absolutely have to."
washingtonwizards,33trjz,isestrex,9,Sat Apr 25 23:28:16 2015 UTC,Yes. Why no himprhies or Seraphin? Those guys are big bodies who have some energy. Wears down opponents too. Prob 2 strongest guys on the team. Why Godden launching 3s like a mug?
washingtonwizards,33trjz,Mehberry,8,Sat Apr 25 16:47:06 2015 UTC,They don't need them (as much) against the smaller Raptors. I'm sure they'll both be used a lot more against Horford and Millsap assuming no upsets.
washingtonwizards,33trjz,tooz,2,Sat Apr 25 17:09:45 2015 UTC,"Seraphin can eat the Raptors bench bigs alive if we feed him properly, and he's small as it is. Humphries I can somewhat see as not being the greatest matchup, but KS can do work."
washingtonwizards,33trjz,Mehberry,3,Sat Apr 25 17:16:14 2015 UTC,"True that, but KS has some serious problems in his game. He's wildly inconsistent (some nights he's Shaq, other nights he shouldn't be in the NBA). Also, he's a pretty big black hole - not much there as far a passing out of the post and he takes a shot almost every time. Still, maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to try him out in Game 4.  Plus, is JV really that bad of a post defender? I'm not sure that KS could totally destroy him in the paint."
washingtonwizards,33trjz,tooz,4,Sat Apr 25 19:16:06 2015 UTC,"Oh if you're looking to shit on KS, I'm your guy. Well aware of his flaws.   And I maintain that JV is, outside of direct 1 on 1 post d, terrible. Unfortunately KS does play back to basket a lot. That being said, JV starts and doesn't necessarily play against KS the whole time."
washingtonwizards,33trjz,madlate,3,Sat Apr 25 19:19:24 2015 UTC,"That's true. I just realized, outside of JV, you have only really have Patterson, Hansborough, and Johnson as bigs. And you're right, those guys would get absolutely destroyed by KS. Maybe we'll see a little more KS in game 4 then?"
washingtonwizards,33trjz,Mehberry,2,Sat Apr 25 19:27:34 2015 UTC,hansborough has no offense but his defense is solid
washingtonwizards,33trjz,madlate,4,Sat Apr 25 20:37:47 2015 UTC,What? I'd put that the other way around. The dude gets fouled in the paint constantly to get to the line.
washingtonwizards,33trjz,Mehberry,2,Sat Apr 25 21:19:52 2015 UTC,idk I haven't seen him do jack on offense this whole series.
washingtonwizards,33trjz,tooz,2,Sat Apr 25 22:23:54 2015 UTC,"Fair. Tyler has been pretty bad this series, though IMO on both ends of the court."
washingtonwizards,33trjz,LexisNexiss,3,Sat Apr 25 22:25:49 2015 UTC,"Gooden has been stretching out the floor. He's gone from garbage fire to very solid contributer. The fact that he can actually hit 3s and play the 4 gives him the versatility to be our answer to needing a stretch 4 that opens up driving lanes. Certainly, Nene and Humphries don't fill this role, and you can't really put Pierce at the 4 for a very long time (I don't think that lineup even happened last game)."
washingtonwizards,33trjz,tooz,1 point,Sat Apr 25 19:11:04 2015 UTC,"Fair. Porter obvi can't play any 4 even tho his height is bonus? gooden is tough and athletic too. He's earned his salary. I'd like to see Gortat play 32 mins, humphries 8 + Seraphin for  8 at center position. Then Nene 30 at the 4,  humphries 8 & Gooden 10."
washingtonwizards,33trjz,LexisNexiss,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:44:36 2015 UTC,"Porter is way, way to skinny to play the 4. Pierce is small, but he can at least body up bigger guys too some extent. Otto would just get eaten up.  I think that minutes distribution would be fair, but it depends on how good our floor spacing is with Nene. If he doesn't space the floor (or get points), it makes more sense to put Gooden in for a lot of minutes."
washingtonwizards,33v2us,WizOfAwesSite,2,Sat Apr 25 22:24:32 2015 UTC,"Also, nene dropped a goose egg against the Bulls earlier."
washingtonwizards,33v2us,Diwrnach,1 point,Sun Apr 26 06:21:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of this except this part:   John Wall, Bradley Beal, and even Otto Porter have taken great steps forward in the playoffs. Washington would have nothing to lose, and they’ve hit their stride.   How has Beal made great steps forward? He looked great against the Bulls last year. This year, he was awful in game 1 and decent last night. I like him, but I don't see how he's any better."
washingtonwizards,33v2us,guga31bb,5,Sat Apr 25 23:58:18 2015 UTC,"His aggressiveness. He has stopped settling for mid-range shots and he's finally getting to the free throw line. The numbers don't necessarily reflect it, though."
washingtonwizards,33v2us,guga31bb,2,Sun Apr 26 00:14:26 2015 UTC,and he's finally getting to the free throw line    Against the Bulls: 26 free throws in 5 games (5.2 per game) Against the Raptors: 14 free throws in 3 games (4.7 per game)   Sooooo...no?   Game 1: 6-23 on field goals Game 2: 12-21 Game 3: 4-12   He's had literally one good game in this year's playoffs.
washingtonwizards,33v2us,first_time-long_time,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:20:43 2015 UTC,"He averaged 2.6 FTA per game this year, and his FTA per game in this series would be top 30 in the league this regular season. So it's a huge improvement."
washingtonwizards,33v2us,madlate,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:36:38 2015 UTC,"He's been much more aggressive though. I'm not even mad at his bad games cos they were only bad because he couldn't buy a shot, other than that he wasn't awful."

washingtonwizards,33thst,madlate,7,Sat Apr 25 16:20:29 2015 UTC,"probably because we did everything we could do distance ourselves from him after the whole gun ordeal, and although i love his support (and shittalking) for our current squad, i still don't think we can welcome him back publicly"
washingtonwizards,33thst,m311owout,7,Sat Apr 25 16:23:34 2015 UTC,"Eh, he was still on the team a year later and played a few games. We didn't try that hard to distance ourselves."
washingtonwizards,33thst,ChicagoZephyrs,2,Sat Apr 25 17:41:41 2015 UTC,"Because his salary was huge, he had an injury reputation at that point, and no one wanted him. Believe me, the Wizards knew they had to get rid of him, and it just took a while to find the team that would take him (Orlando I believe)"
washingtonwizards,33thst,SonicIceLongclaw,0,Sat Apr 25 19:02:24 2015 UTC,The cool thing about it is since the Wiz have distanced themselves from him he can really go at it with the trash talking and not have to worry about what the organization will say
washingtonwizards,33thst,ignoramis,2,Sat Apr 25 19:36:01 2015 UTC,"I think the fans would love him, but Ted would try to have him removed and it could cause a scene. It's probably better for all involved that he just stay away :("

washingtonwizards,33thst,7032CharmCity,7,Sat Apr 25 17:27:26 2015 UTC,I don't think he's still getting paid. He lasted signed a contract in 2008 for 6 years. So it looks like that ended last year.
washingtonwizards,33thst,Zuro,0,Sat Apr 25 17:56:48 2015 UTC,Once he retired he restructured it to pay out over a longer number of years for security/stability. So he might still be getting paid.

Im a ravens fan, any type of argument about player ethics I have to hear about Ray Lewis murdering someone. Fuck that, Even though Gil is not a Hof'er he was wizards basketball last decade and the wizards should respect that. the dudes still playin in china and was working on a comeback but i think Ted should offer him a job.  At least let him be on CSN broadcasts as a Wiz locker room insider or something."
washingtonwizards,33thst,oglefro,2,Sun Apr 26 14:25:36 2015 UTC,"fuck any one who talks shit on Hibachi, the dude was outstanding in the community    Thats what I'm sayin!  Unlike the other elite players of the mid-2000s, Hibachi Arenas was so nice both on and off the court.  This guy can make threes from the parking lot for cryin' out loud.  EG should really re-sign him for the vet minimum and bring him off the bench to backup John in the playoffs."

washingtonwizards,33thst,oglefro,2,Sun Apr 26 15:19:18 2015 UTC,"suddenly he is the Anti-Christ    Did the Wiz front office even genuinely feel like the incident was that big of a deal?  I don't believe they did. . . Hibachi had been a known practical joker for years.  It is more likely that Ted and the other owners (pure businessmen that care very little about the Wiz beyond the revenue the team generates) saw a potential opportunity to void a huge contract that Abe had entered into, so he plotted to call the league and leak it to the media.  Even though their plan ultimately failed, I still strongly dislike Ted."

Even if guns are not allowed in DC. every single article you read on it sounds like they were in some kinda mexican stand off pointing guns at each others heads...  But your theory made sense to me. because they traded Caron and Antwan that year so they could tank while arenas was suspended, and then they traded Gil away so they could continue the tank to rebuild... At least we got john!"

washingtonwizards,33thst,skrunk2krunk,2,Sat Apr 25 18:02:35 2015 UTC,I don't think it's a false conclusion at all to think he killed a lot of momentum to change it back
washingtonwizards,33thst,Mehberry,1 point,Sat Apr 25 21:37:18 2015 UTC,Please logically explain to me why what Gilbert did would prevent the team from changing the name back.
washingtonwizards,33thst,skrunk2krunk,4,Sat Apr 25 21:44:34 2015 UTC,"The entire city pissed itself, which led to a decent bit of the country pissing itself. DC is one of the most gun-scared cities in the country, and regardless of whether it was merited or not, a player bringing guns into the locker room related to a supposed ongoing teammate dispute got national attention and caused nationwide shitting on the team. You really think that wasn't a factor at all? The name got changed from Rabin getting assassinated, upsetting Abe; the mere threat of gun violence within the team itself is a PR nightmare.   It's difficult trying to find a subject to compare it to, but that was a PR nightmare in itself - juxtaposed with any potential name change probably would've been worse than the Redskins controversy. You think social justice shit gets attention? Politics gets worse, and people still remember what Gil did (or misremember, but that's an aside) so no owner Ted or otherwise would want to start that shitstorm.    Whether or not it should've is a completely different conversation. But Agent Zero was most definitely a factor in any movement that might've existed to change the name back."
washingtonwizards,33thst,Mehberry,1 point,Sat Apr 25 21:51:36 2015 UTC,"You are jumping to conclusions like Tom from Office Space.     So your argument is that because there was a ""PR nightmare"" 5+ years ago after Hibachi brought the collector's edition Golden Eye gun into the Wizards locker room, changing the name back to the Bullets would create a PR nightmare.    If 2009 Wizards locker room + unloaded Golden gun = ""PR nightmare"" Then Washington basketball team + name change to Bullets = ""PR nightmare"".   Doesn't work."

washingtonwizards,33thst,skrunk2krunk,2,Sat Apr 25 21:38:55 2015 UTC,I am so confused by your attempts at logic.  Because it doesn't come from the owner makes it invalid?
washingtonwizards,33thst,Salvador_Limones,0,Sat Apr 25 22:02:39 2015 UTC,"Correct.  In corporations, managers are employees who manage what they are told to manage.  Joe Duchepriest is employed by Monumental to manage team marketing.  Thats it.        On the other hand, owners of companies, and not their employees, decide what the names of their companies are.

You see it in the way they act, all 3 of our young players listen to every word PP says, and they respect him to the highest degree. One moment I look to is the game against Orlando where we won on a last second tip in. The play was great but before it happened you could see PP talking to Bradley Beal, ensuring him that he could do it and imparting some of that veteran knowledge that only he could.

Plus, even though everyone picked the Raptors, no one is really surprised that they crumbled in the playoffs with the Wizards looking significantly better than the regular season because it's a complete repeat of what both teams did last year just not against each other.

washingtonwizards,33tb6r,isestrex,2,Sat Apr 25 17:17:58 2015 UTC,We had the least exciting win last night. Wall getting 15 assists was awesome but it is reasonable to think the Clippers being beat by 27 or Harden scoring 42 makes for more exciting news.

Regardless, I think he's going to end up as an assistant, trying to design the defense for some contender that gets them the chip. Like thibs with the Celtics or Casey with the 2011 Mavs"

washingtonwizards,33s7kb,Mehberry,7,Sat Apr 25 06:48:30 2015 UTC,Well pretty sure you didn't get paid 3 million dollars a year to tell people to take what the defense gives you also.
washingtonwizards,33s7kb,jrb1851,1 point,Sat Apr 25 07:03:21 2015 UTC,"No chance he gets demoted. In an ideal world, we had a better coach and he'd be our assistant for defense. But that's not viable sadly."

washingtonwizards,33s7kb,chjodi,26,Sat Apr 25 02:55:48 2015 UTC,Playoff Pierce can go toe to toe with anyone in the league. You guys can make a run if you keep playing like this.

washingtonwizards,33s7kb,onestonedspoon,3,Sat Apr 25 02:59:01 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say they haven't been competitive. Lots of early lead changes and big swings. We've just managed to pull ahead early in the second half and keep it.
washingtonwizards,33s7kb,happyflappypancakes,2,Sat Apr 25 03:17:02 2015 UTC,"I wish we could give you a competitive 48 minutes, then.    If only Dwane Casey realized that trying to turn us into a defensive team when we were a top offensive team was a bad idea, maybe our terrible second half/playoff run wouldn't have happened.  As a Raptors fan, facing the truth hurts (double meanings are fun!).  Either way, kudos to your team for coming out strong each game and taking control of the series."

I'm the complete opposite heading back home to cali after this school semester and catching my first wiz game tonight. You should look into last year's see how long it took after each win series for the next one to start since there's no set date. My best guess would be early beginning of May would be the closest to the first home game.

The likely situation is that the Wiz have a home game on Mothers' Day weekend. If both series end quickly, they'll start the second round in ATL next Friday / Saturday and they'll get to DC on the following Wed / Thu with game 4 over the weekend. If one or both series go long, they'll start the 2nd round by Tue / Wed and game 3 would be Mothers' Day. Of course, if Brooklyn comes back to win their series, then all of that is wrong because the Wiz will be the home team."

washingtonwizards,33ndaf,WizOfAwesSite,5,Thu Apr 23 22:49:36 2015 UTC,"Ernie Grunfeld had acquired several big men (Kris Humphries and DeJuan Blair) and re-signed a few others during the free agency period (Marcin Gortat, Kevin Seraphin and Drew Gooden). Given the situation, I’m assuming, Wittman was reluctant to play Pierce at the four spot.   Nonsense.     Gortat, Seraphin, and Blair all play center, not PF, and outside of garbage time, Gooden didn't play much of anything at all.  Under your theory that leaves only Humphries. Humphries does have a nice Darius Songaila-esque long range 2 game, but if you think Wittman was ""reluctant"" to play Pierce at the 4 because of Kris Humphries, well . . . I have a bridge you can buy instead.    Isn't it more likely that Pierce played SF all year because (1) he was just plain better that Otto and Rasual, (2) healthier than Martell, and (3) too old, fragile, and undersized to play power forward and against the league's other starting power forwards all year? If he had to bang at the 4-spot all year, he would currently be in no shape to show all of Canada that they can't handle the Truth.  That would have cost us game 1, maybe the 5-seed, and the calls for Wittman's head would be even louder and more annoying than they are now.    How has Bleacher Report not swallowed Wiz of Awes by now?"
washingtonwizards,33ndaf,skrunk2krunk,7,Fri Apr 24 01:16:04 2015 UTC,"Hey, I appreciate the comment, but please read it again.  I was just reiterating Wittman's thoughts. If you read it again, you'll see that I stated that Pierce could've played the 4, regardless of the amount of bigs on the team.  And, we're a part of the FanSided Network ;)  I encourage you to read through it again, hence the ""Don't Buy It"" headline."
washingtonwizards,33ndaf,MrGoodieMob,2,Fri Apr 24 01:55:58 2015 UTC,"I agree with the premise that Pierce could have played the 4 without an increase in minutes this year, but disagree with the notion that it would have had the same effect on his body. It would have been tougher on his body to get beat up by bigger guys than to play the wing.   People love to shit on Randy, and while I don't think he's a very good coach, he does win when it matters. I had someone on /r/nba suggest to me that this team could've won 65 games with a different coach. That's insane to me. The media loves to shit on RW, and people bleet out whatever Grantland tells them to think."
washingtonwizards,33ndaf,7032CharmCity,2,Fri Apr 24 14:39:24 2015 UTC,"Most teams play small-ball and it's part of the reason why fans wanted Pierce to play the 4. For instance, if they played small vs. the Warriors during the reg. season, would Pierce's body get more beat up vs. someone like Draymond Green? Probably not.  Wittman should've taken it game-by-game. Since most teams play small, or at least they do in spurts, Pierce would've matched up with another perimeter player. It really wouldn't have any affect on his body."
washingtonwizards,33ndaf,7032CharmCity,2,Fri Apr 24 16:57:48 2015 UTC,I always give Witt credit for keeping Pierce/Nene healthy.  Those dudes did not play a second more than necessary.  Many coaches would've been tempted to give them more minutes in what essentially accounts to meaningless games.
washingtonwizards,33ndaf,7032CharmCity,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:27:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think 65 was possible, but I do think the right coach could've easily won 50-55 without any major injuries."
washingtonwizards,33ndaf,MrGoodieMob,2,Fri Apr 24 15:39:42 2015 UTC,"65 wasn't possible. But, Washington was in the bottom half of the league in pace. You'd think, with a back court of Wall and Beal, they'd be in amongst the league leaders.  With increased pace + more creativity within the offense, Washington could've cracked 50 wins.  That said, Wittman's style does result in wins in the playoffs. Let's hope it continues."
washingtonwizards,33min5,WizOfAwesSite,8,Thu Apr 23 18:57:05 2015 UTC,What also needs to be talked about is how hard he plays. On that steal and easy dunk John Wall had Otto actually chased down Vasquez to be in position for a rebound in-case Wall messed up.

washingtonwizards,33lzy9,argath2014,5,Fri Apr 24 02:25:21 2015 UTC,"Not double ticket prices over the course of 1 year? Actually treat current season ticket holders with some respect?  I had season tickets this year but due to them raising their prices for next year (By around 20%) I decided not to renew for next year. Because I wouldn't renew for next year, I was unable to obtain any ""benefits"" for being a season ticket holder. Last I checked, we're still in the current year, I should be entitled to the benefits of being a season ticket holder. And I get you want to add benefits to entice people to buy tickets for next year, but you shouldn't disadvantage current season ticket holders. That's a poor business model and creates a bad rep. They could have easily opened up the season ticket prices to both current and future season ticket holders if they wanted to sell out.  Last year I went to both playoff games against Chicago at home. I paid ~$150 a ticket for 4 rows up in the midlevel ""club"" seats (without being any kind of season ticket holder). In fact, I actually paid that price for 2nd row, center section (section 200 I believe) but the person selling the tickets claimed some excuse of why the tickets were no longer available after I bought them and compensated me with an extra ticket in the 4th row of section 201, but I digress. This year the same tickets have doubled to around $300 (at least that's where they were when the tickets first went on sale). I watch all of the games on TV but I just simply can't afford to pay $300 a ticket to go see them play in person. Want people to show up? Don't double the ticket prices. Obviously I'm not the only one in this boat.   Although as I look online now, it looks as though prices have come down significantly (probably due to nobody buying any tickets, surprise surprise). Of course, if they had started out at these prices, I probably would've bought a couple but since it's now last minute, I've already made plans for the night after the game and am no longer able to attend.  And yea, I get it, winning teams are gonna have higher ticket prices, but the team this year did not justify a 100% increase in ticket prices out of the gate plain and simple. Maybe if we came in as a top3 seed I could understand it.   That's just my 2 cents and why I'm personally not attending any playoff games this year. It's not because I'm a terrible fan, it's because of the piss poor planning and execution from the front office."

So for anyone who'd like to come support the Wizards, here's my employee link to $45 Playoff Tickets (without fees) here at the Verizon Center.  The code is BENWIZ.  http://www.msesales.com/wiz/ben  All who attend tonight's game will receive a Red/White/Blue Wizards T-shirt.  I was just in the arena putting shirts on every single seat, and the Verizon Center looks amazing!!  Thanks for all of your support this season, and let's get some big wins here on home court!"

washingtonwizards,33j71u,Erigion,9,Thu Apr 23 01:57:11 2015 UTC,Colin Cowherd once said Wall would never be a good player because he did the Dougie for 30 seconds before one game. He is a prick.
washingtonwizards,33j71u,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,7,Thu Apr 23 02:01:49 2015 UTC,Cowherd didn't once say it. Cowherd has repeatedly said it over the last five years. SIX references
washingtonwizards,33j71u,Obersts001,6,Thu Apr 23 11:56:00 2015 UTC,"It's not just that, it's that he has kept at it for five years now.

Just Google ""Cowherd John Wall"" to see the full litany of stupid racist dog whistle crap that Cowherd has spewed over the years."

John has shown that he is an extremely hard worker and deserving of being a franchise guy. You would think he would want people to forget about this. Much like his comments about Drose.
washingtonwizards,33k9ay,youngsaiyan,3,Thu Apr 23 06:37:03 2015 UTC,"Plus he's lying when he says that John Wall is everything he said he would be.

The wrong people.   What wrong people? You mean the fans? Athletes are entertainers. How is that using poor judgement to entertain? If the crowd gets into it, then that's an accomplishment. John Wall understood his role as entertainer as a rookie in his first home game. This alone makes him, like, 10 times smarter than Cowherd."

I could be wrong, but to me it looked like Pierce went up to him and told him to do that, almost like it's more of an insult not to take a shot and to just give them the ball back. Then in that picture he walked up to him and was like ""I told you"" and then they had a chuckle, lol."

Other possibilities would be Four Seasons Georgetown or the Ritz Carlton in the West End neighborhood. If you're willing to drop $500+/night, go for it. The Wizards stayed in the Four Seasons in Toronto, I believe."

There's nothing that connects Cowherd to Wall beyond the sport of basketball. He has no license to be this personally critical, nor further insight into Wall's life other than the surface tidbits about his childhood and a dance. But has chosen to demonize Wall anyway. John Wall frankly doesn't need to appease Colin Cowherd because Colin Cowherd doesn't matter in the grand scheme.   Eat shit Cowherd. That's our point guard leading this team to victory, as more or a man than you'll ever be. Keep doing you John, this city is behind you 100%"

washingtonwizards,33jce4,Shaidester,2,Thu Apr 23 00:49:48 2015 UTC,"Brooklyn is by far the worst team in the playoffs. I'm surprised they have been staying close to ATL in these first two games. Obviously we need to close this series out before we get too far ahead of ourselves, but ATL scares me. Coach Bud is a billion times better than randy. That being said I think our (Wiz) playoff defense could shut them down if we close out on their shooters. Hopefully Otto can continue his play as well."

But I'm of course a Paul Pierce fan and an NBA guy in general so I pull for the Wizards. My girl surprised me with some floor seats to the game this Friday. I haven't been to Wizards playoff game before and the only Wiz gear I got is a Bullets snapback.  They give out T Shirts at playoff games right?"

washingtonwizards,33fotc,AgentLF,10,Wed Apr 22 03:30:30 2015 UTC,Our PR/media team needs to stop cheaping out and actually put.an effort to change the atsmosphere
washingtonwizards,33fotc,Gr8WallofChinatown,3,Wed Apr 22 04:31:14 2015 UTC,It sells out during playoffs. I was there for game 6 against the Pacers; it got LOUD.
washingtonwizards,33fotc,logitaunt,3,Wed Apr 22 13:33:24 2015 UTC,"Part of the problem is exactly this: casual fans assume that tickets are not available or insanely priced when they're not.  Neither Friday nor Sunday is sold out; there are at least 1,000 seats still available for Friday and a couple thousand for Sunday, at virtually every price point. Check out the Friday map here, and the Sunday map here. Ted seems to have reduced the price on the worst seats from $45 to $29, but most of those are now gone for Friday.   And that Game 6 vs. the Pacers last year was also not anywhere near sold out -- here's the box score showing attendance at 19,506 when the official capacity for basketball is over 20k and they announced 23,356 for the Bulls' Game 3 during Round 1. So you could say that there were over 3,000 open seats at that game. Repeat: GAME 6, SECOND ROUND LAST YEAR WAS NOT CLOSE TO SOLD OUT. That's just criminal. Don't blame Ted for that, and don't blame the PR team. Blame the people who think it's better to experience playoff basketball at home vs. actually being there.  The bottom line is that the fans gotta fucking show up. Maybe the team should do more on promotions and advertising generally, but in most NBA cities they could sell playoff tickets via scavenger hunt and they'd still sell out. These games should sell themselves."
washingtonwizards,33fotc,Obersts001,3,Wed Apr 22 14:10:47 2015 UTC,"This wouldn't be a problem if the Wizards had more fans.  It's a struggle to get bars in the region to put the team on TVs, let alone drum up any real interest.  Wiz kids are a distant fourth on the DC sports hierarchy, unfortunately.  Most of us have likely seen that horrible map of the most popular teams in each region of the country.  The Wizards are only the most popular team in DC, Fairfax and Montgomery County....it's sad."
washingtonwizards,33fotc,7032CharmCity,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:48:27 2015 UTC,"Completely agree - there's no reason why anyone in the DMV should root for the other three major pro sports teams here plus the Lakers or Cavs. Funny thing is that yesterday there was a story that showed how the Wiz's TV ratings this season surpassed the Caps for the first time in forever. The Caps sell out every game, yet the Wiz have 5,000 empty seats every night unless Lebron is in town."
washingtonwizards,33fotc,Obersts001,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:59:31 2015 UTC,"The Caps ""sell out"" like the Redskins ""sell out"" at this point.  Sure, the number is capacity but there are usually a few thousand empty seats for most games not involving Pittsburgh, Philly, Detroit, Boston or the Rangers."
washingtonwizards,33fotc,7032CharmCity,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:10:23 2015 UTC,"Completely agree, part of the blame goes to the stretch where we were a joke in the NBA (Nick Young, Blatche, McGee, latter Gilbert years), and were more likely to be on shaqtin' a fool than sniffing the 8th seed. I'll call this 2009 - 2013.  During this time, the Capitals were in a midst of a stretch of consecutive playoff appearances and even had the best record at some point, which raises fan awareness. The Nationals were up and coming and had one of the top young prospects in Strasburg and Harper and had a great nucleus to build for the future. Eventually, Natties win their division in 2012, fan base spikes.   Regardless of what we believe, The Redskins are and will always be the king of sports in DC. I think it's due to circumstance that the Wiz are the least-supported team out of the big 4. As while we were going through our ""rebuilding"" phase, the other teams came to prominence. Which is why I think we're the least supported fanbase in DC. Although, this could change with a great string of runs in the playoffs in the upcoming years. These games should sell themselves, but they dont because DMV people already spend money on the other sports bc most likely, they became a fan first of them than the Wizards."
washingtonwizards,33fotc,TophMasterFlex,2,Wed Apr 22 17:51:39 2015 UTC,"I was there that game too, but it didn't sell out. I bought tickets from the box office at 2PM that day."

People buy most of the tickets in pre-sale, and then they turn to ticketmaster and jack up the prices. We need more of the young and passionate fans. Much less of the politicians and anyone else who could just watch the game at home.  I'll never forget comparing prices between game 2 of the Pacers/Wizards game @ Fieldhouse and game 3 @ Verizon center. There was a $50-$75 difference in the Nosebleed seats!!!"
washingtonwizards,33fotc,adamsfallen,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:17:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's true, and I heard this is a purposeful pricing strategy via ownership, to hold onto as many tickets as possible and sell at high margins.  As a result a lot of tickets will be left knowingly unsold, and the stands will be partly empty as a result."
washingtonwizards,33fotc,masedizzle,1 point,Wed Apr 22 13:42:51 2015 UTC,"Don't price out the true fans so that the only people who can afford to go are the rich people from the 'burbs who haven't been going to most of the games.   My friends & I (10 of us total) have a partial season plan and then pick up additional games here or there. We've made our own custom jerseys and get loud. That being said, we won't be there because they jacked the prices up so much and gave no concessions to the regular goers."
washingtonwizards,33fotc,masedizzle,1 point,Wed Apr 22 13:50:08 2015 UTC,"It's annoying because those ""rich people from the burbs"" arent necessarily fans who will get into the game, and only watch for leisure/matter-of-fact aka fans w/very little passion.   Like, I dont think we would have fans just waiting outside watching the game AT the arena and go nuts at every play like in Toronto."

washingtonwizards,33e1zr,7032CharmCity,6,Tue Apr 21 20:32:12 2015 UTC,He's the best. I always feel like he writes from my head and it actually comes out well instead of what I would write. I always say he is one of us.
washingtonwizards,33e1zr,Gr8WallofChinatown,4,Tue Apr 21 20:34:21 2015 UTC,This article sums up what every Wizards fan felt this season. This has got to be the best Wizards article this year. I took  a break from watching games for the same exact reason Sharp did.
washingtonwizards,33e1zr,skrunk2krunk,4,Tue Apr 21 21:43:39 2015 UTC,"The Wizards did not ""give Trevor Ariza's money to Martell Webster"".  This is simply not true."
washingtonwizards,33e1zr,ragtime_sam,3,Tue Apr 21 21:29:27 2015 UTC,"Maybe he's saying that if we didn't give that long contract to Webster, we could have offered enough to keep him here last offseason?"
washingtonwizards,33e1zr,7032CharmCity,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:05:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's more what I interpreted it as.  Team needs to be smarter in the offseason, nobody is arguing that."
washingtonwizards,33e1zr,Boymankid,3,Wed Apr 22 03:32:47 2015 UTC,"Webster of last year would've been worth his contract IMO, he just can't find himself anymore"
washingtonwizards,33e1zr,7032CharmCity,2,Wed Apr 22 04:23:22 2015 UTC,"Last year?  I don't think so.  Two years ago? Maybe.  That's been the problem.  This franchise has been paying guys for past performances for decades that have rarely amounted to wise investments.  The NBA world laughed at us when we signed Martell to that deal and it has showed.  Luckily, his contract is an expiring next year, so it can be packaged...as is Nene's."
washingtonwizards,33e1zr,Boymankid,2,Wed Apr 22 04:31:34 2015 UTC,"~10ppg in 78 games, usually off the bench, and .390 3pt% isn't bad at all, sure it was a step down from the year before but those 2 years together he was looking like the contract was at least reasonable. It wasn't until this disappointment year that the contract started to look ugly IMO. If he had equaled his production from last year I would say it would've been fine"
washingtonwizards,33e1zr,ragtime_sam,1 point,Wed Apr 22 06:26:02 2015 UTC,No I'm pretty sure we have him for the next two seasons
washingtonwizards,33e1zr,7032CharmCity,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:02:30 2015 UTC,I believe it was a 4 year deal with team option on third signed in the summer of 2013.  Which means he's essentially an expiring next season.
washingtonwizards,33e1zr,TheHeavyBackpack,2,Wed Apr 22 15:12:31 2015 UTC,Yeah it's a shame the only decent game he played this year was the last game of the season against the Cavs where nothing mattered.

washingtonwizards,33fpe2,TophMasterFlex,1 point,Wed Apr 22 13:00:38 2015 UTC,Yup.  During the season I thought Pierce was showing his age.  I was wrong.  He was just conserving his energy for when it mattered.
washingtonwizards,33fb1q,Exoguana,13,Wed Apr 22 01:31:58 2015 UTC,Hmm. Fed Ex Field vs Verizon Center. Sorry Verizon center is a lot better and less of a bitch to get too.  Dan Snyder vs Ted. I'd take Ted anyway  Bruce Allen vs EG. EG  Jay Gruden who throws his players under the bus vs Wittman and Funny ass Wittman faces/moments. Wittman  Redskins media vs Wizards media. Sorry I hate Redskins drama/cancerous media  RGIII vs Wall. I'd take Wall  Mascot: wizards aren't offensive   Steve Buckhanz + Phil Chenier >>>>  Does Verizon center play shipping to Boston? (Stupid ass fed ex field)  Playoffs vs last place?
washingtonwizards,33fb1q,Gr8WallofChinatown,10,Wed Apr 22 02:40:09 2015 UTC,Bruce Allen vs EG. EG   Scott McCloughan is our GM not B.A.  Also you can not compare Verizon to FED EX.  ps. We are all on the same side. What does it matter?
washingtonwizards,33fb1q,limewir3,3,Wed Apr 22 03:02:44 2015 UTC,The DMV is so much more football that it isn't even fair to compare them. No matter who is better the Redskins are going to be number 1. He wasn't necessarily hating on the Wizards just trying to give reasons they aren't as loved as they should be.
washingtonwizards,33fb1q,VCURedskins,7,Wed Apr 22 03:40:13 2015 UTC,"Basketball is the sport of choice to play in DC. People love to play basketball but due to the lack of success of the Wizards, most of them became fans of other teams. This area is a basketball area. It is also one of the hottest basketball recruiting areas in the world.  Edit: this is kinda what I'm talking about http://dc.sbnation.com/washington-wizards/2010/12/2/1842267/washington-dc-sports-basketball-town-redskins  UMD is all about basketball. GTown is all basketball. UVA is now a basketball school. Verizon Center is in one of the more popular parts of DC. DC high schools (and VA high schools), and Baltimore schools  are basketball recruiting hot spots. Professionally NFL may be the most popular but basketball defines us. It's what we grew up with."
washingtonwizards,33fb1q,Gr8WallofChinatown,2,Wed Apr 22 04:10:52 2015 UTC,"It is the sport of choice in DC but there is more to the DMV than DC. Go to Virginia, even Nova alone if you don't want to include all of VA in the DMV, and it is all football. People in VA barely care about basketball until you get to Richmond and that's only because places like Petersburg and George Wythe were state championship or at least close in basketball. Go to Maryland and it is football. The city itself is basketball but the surrounding areas the media is trying to reach would unfortunately much rather hear about the Redskins instead of basketball at all.   Think about how the area lit up in 2012 for the Redskins and they didn't even win a playoff game yet when the Wizards won a playoff game it was barely anything in comparison."
washingtonwizards,33fb1q,VCURedskins,2,Wed Apr 22 04:32:37 2015 UTC,I agree with what you're saying since basketball is popular is city environments and football is popular for suburban-rural areas but in the case for DC the city and its surrounding area (basically areas where the metro reaches out). It is basketball which was the point of my post.

washingtonwizards,33fb1q,madlate,2,Wed Apr 22 04:25:07 2015 UTC,does anyone give a fuck about being likable? as long as we have our core fans and we're playing well i couldn't care less about this.
washingtonwizards,33fb1q,kennyisthebest,2,Wed Apr 22 01:55:26 2015 UTC,"i have a feeling Chris Cooley's list of ""likable"" players is quite short...  so else on the east would even be on that list?   even if ""likable"" meant anything,  I'd imagine John would be close to the top of that list"
washingtonwizards,33fb1q,Cpr196,2,Wed Apr 22 02:15:30 2015 UTC,"Seriously, why aren't we more likable? I went to a Sports Authority recently, and I was just looking around and thought I should go get a  Wiz snapback because recently I went to a store that had a full selection of NBA snapbacks but no Wiz. I get to the local team section and the fucking CAPS the Capitals have a whole section dedicated to them. Fine. But even the Skins, have another section. Ravens get a little room, but still the Skins had a lot of space. Baseball teams get a little love too, Nats and Orioles with their own room. What do the Wiz get? A rack. One shirt rack. There's also a section where they keep team hats and not a singe Wiz hat. No Snapback or anything. So, the Caps had about 3/10ths, the Skins 3/10ths, Ravens 1/10th, the baseball teams about 3/10ths split, and the Wizards, the second best team in town get a rack. The fuck is that about? Oh, and MD was the only college and got like a shelf but whatevs."
washingtonwizards,33fb1q,SplitBamboo,2,Wed Apr 22 02:45:51 2015 UTC,Chris Cooley is my fav Skins player of the past decade but this is a serious non-story. He's talking to talk and listening to him on the radio (or anywhere else for the matter) is usually a waste of time unless he's talking Skins football.  Carry on.
washingtonwizards,33fb1q,a_child_to_criticize,2,Wed Apr 22 04:08:39 2015 UTC,"Chris Cooley can cram it. Who gives a flying fuck if casual fans don't find our team likable?  Wall is a BEAST, he's an All Star and he's a genuinely great person. Maybe he doesn't interview like RG3 but I find it hard not to like the guy. He's the reason I started following the Wizards.   Beal, while not consistently playing up to his potential yet, is a great family guy and a good role model.  Pierce is a trash talker but a great player, and a well known veteran.  Gortat is funny as fuck.  Porter is the greatest player ever.  If other people don't like these guys - I don't care at all."
washingtonwizards,33fb1q,pakilicious,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:23:21 2015 UTC,I don't think anything he said is true besides the fact that Beal could be more consistent.  John & Marcin are likeable.  Nene is our enforcer. Those that appreciate toughness love him.

washingtonwizards,33cvow,p3n1x,0,Tue Apr 21 19:36:50 2015 UTC,sports stores   Especially when that store is the team store in the Verizon Center.    Also FUCK ice hockey.
washingtonwizards,33cvow,skrunk2krunk,0,Tue Apr 21 21:33:59 2015 UTC,"I found myself spending Halloween in Boston this past year (wedding) and I looked all over for a Pierce Jersey/shirt (I live in Baltimore).  I called the Champs at Arundel Mills and asked if they had Wizards gear...Lady on the phone says ""no, we only carry local teams""  Perplexed, I respond..""what do you mean by local teams""...she replies ""Ravens, Redskins, Orioles, Nats and Caps...also Maryland sports""  I respond ""Um, the Wizards play in Washington...she pauses and says ""oh, I dunno, I""m from Chicago."" WTF!?  Like that is some excuse you ignorant c(nt!  It gets worse...I show up to that Champs in December and there is a hole section dedicated to Wizards gear!

washingtonwizards,33cvow,ohhwurd,5,Tue Apr 21 16:34:52 2015 UTC,"That's because the Caps are usually much better. The Caps won their division 5/6 years from 2008-2013. The Wizards only made the playoffs once in that time, and were last in their division thrice.  It's good to see things picking up for the Wiz."
washingtonwizards,33cvow,Knyfe-Wrench,2,Wed Apr 22 03:13:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly I know we've had trouble in the past with fans but DC shows out for sports. It's a football town through and through, but after that, the nats and caps have rabid fan bases now that they're good. I think that the Wizards can catch up, but they don't fill the stands like the caps (as it is in most cities with basketball and hockey). Maybe eventually if we stay good for an extended period, but yeah."
washingtonwizards,33cvow,Virulentt,1 point,Tue Apr 21 18:07:26 2015 UTC,"Man, I just wish basketball season started in February or something so it wouldn't overlap with hockey as much.  It's so difficult for me to find time to follow both my Caps and Wiz.  I usually end up prioritizing the Wiz, but I'd rather be able to follow both more closely.  Also, why didn't Wizards play last night?  Now we compete with Boston-Cleveland, Caps - NYI, and Tampa Bay - Detroit?  If they played yesterday then we at least wouldn't be overlapping with the Caps series... boooooooo scheduling."
washingtonwizards,33cvow,Yeti60,2,Tue Apr 21 18:31:56 2015 UTC,"Blackhawks play tonight in Chicago and because Chicago Bulls played on Saturday, they would have to play on either Monday or Tuesday.  The Bulls can't have a home game on Tuesday because the Blackhawks have it scheduled, so it goes to Monday, which makes the Wizards, the other eastern conference team (which means they play at 8:00) play on Tuesday :)"

washingtonwizards,33cvow,p3n1x,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:34:09 2015 UTC,They can do every other night as they will do it this weekend.  The only reason they can't do it during the week is because they want to maximize tv revenue by having the least amount of teams playing any given night to maximize exposure.

I'm all for using another site if it's proven to be legit, but not sure if it's worth the risk for a few bucks. If it's significant savings, I'd probably take the risk.   The main company I remember seeing last time I looked at seatgeek which was several months ago isn't even listed on their, so I'm wondering if they went under?

washingtonwizards,33bprf,Gr8WallofChinatown,5,Tue Apr 21 05:37:33 2015 UTC,"To be honest. Most of the EC playoff teams are defensive teams that have an average or below average offense. THe Wizards win by defense not by offense. When a team scores over 100 we tend to lose. Now if we had a good offense, we would be contenders.  Last year the Bulls offense was bad but had a great defense. This year the Raptors offense is average with a good defense. When we lost to the Pacers, it showed how we lack offensive firepower. When we played Toronto, it again showed our lack of offensive firepower.  Wittman isn't out coaching anyone with his offensive game plans. It's our defense."
washingtonwizards,33bprf,smilezandsouthstar,2,Tue Apr 21 13:17:19 2015 UTC,The Raptors had a top 5 offense and bottom 5 defense this season.

It clearly changed Otto's approach. It changed the ""6,"" who were more concerned with PP than anything else happening in the game. It changed Toronto's GM, who sent a message to the team that he could be rattled. Why wouldn't it have changed Witt's approach?"

Essentially we don't box out, miss out on a lot of 50/50 balls, take bad shots, and now aren't getting to the line.

They usually don't have anything of value to add especially Reggie and John Berry. NBATV announcers are usually better but still the national announcers usually just know the widely circulated storylines where Buck and Phil have watched the Wizards all year long.
washingtonwizards,337g6v,VCURedskins,2,Mon Apr 20 18:08:40 2015 UTC,"I dislike hearing other perspectives about the Wizards, because they aren't really perspectives but super slick national guys reading off the talking points.  Buck and Phil, and Glenn and Dave on the radio, not only know basketball, but they know the players personally from traveling with them and interacting with them 82 games a year.  Otherwise, I'd rather have the sound turned down most of the time."

washingtonwizards,338h95,mopete24,15,Mon Apr 20 14:16:32 2015 UTC,"Yes. And I think/hope that the majority of DC fans agree.  This team was a laughing stock only a couple of years ago, and I sure as fuck didn't support them that entire time just to root against them now that they're actually in the playoffs.   I'm also cautiously optimistic that Wittman will get the boot regardless, with all the negative media attention he's getting at the moment. I wish we could fire him and then hire him as our defensive assistant coach, he's legitimately solid defensively."
washingtonwizards,338h95,nihilistcommunist,5,Mon Apr 20 14:34:49 2015 UTC,"I wish we could fire him and then hire him as our defensive assistant coach   I know what you're saying, but that's not gonna work unless you hired someone with a towering reputation who could have complete authority no matter what.  (And Pop is probably happy in San Antonio.)  So we have to roll the dice and hope Wittman's defensive teaching will hold under a more talented offensive coach.  I think this last year was the year for DC to get an offensive assistant coach to help Wittman improve.  Grunfeld didn't do it, and that's another reason to move on from him as well as Randy."
washingtonwizards,338h95,white_light-king,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:09:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree, it won't happen. I'm kind of worried we'll deteriorate defensively under a new coach, but who knows."

washingtonwizards,338h95,ab__,1 point,Mon Apr 20 14:48:04 2015 UTC,A few years ago we fired Jay Triano as our head coach and he had a role in the front office for a year. He's now an assistant on the Trail Blazers so thats the closest example I can think of. Guys normally take a year off or become a broadcaster then comeback as assistants
washingtonwizards,338h95,ab__,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:02:53 2015 UTC,Ah yea I've seen that transition as the popular one. Have you heard of a head coach moving down to defensive coach within the same organization like /u/nihilistcommunist described?
washingtonwizards,338h95,TophMasterFlex,2,Mon Apr 20 15:21:21 2015 UTC,"I doubt that would happen.  Would you take a demotion at your job and work for someone else, when you feel that you are perfectly capable of holding that job?"
washingtonwizards,338h95,ab__,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:30:08 2015 UTC,"Yea I understand that, which is why I was curious as to if it's ever happened in the past. Maybe Wittman realizes his team would be better off with someone else running the main duties as a Head-Coach while he can focus on the defense. This is all hypothetical of course."
washingtonwizards,338h95,anon__sequitur,6,Mon Apr 20 18:38:32 2015 UTC,"The desire to lose games is a peculiar quality of the internet sports nerd. The sort of person who enjoys looking at stats, talking about trades, free agents and lottery picks more than actually watching games. Normal people follow a basketball team, they want them to win.  Also, winning this series isn't gonna be a guarantee for Wittman. We got to the second-round last year as well. With a team this young, a failure of Beal and Porter to develop, only improving 2 games in the regular season record and not getting past the second round would be enough to fire Wittman. I'm sure the rest of this series will be very tough and if the Wiz are fortunate enough to advance, I can't see them beating Cleveland Atlanta in the next round. Unless they make it an epic series where it looks like Wittman has out-coached the other side and put the Wiz in a position to win against a more talented team, I think he'll be let go."
washingtonwizards,338h95,ireddit270,3,Mon Apr 20 14:43:12 2015 UTC,"If they advance Washington would play Atlanta in the next round, not Cleveland. If Wittman were able to show his stuff against the Hawks and get us past that series, I think it's fair to say he'd earn the right to at least coach out the rest of his contract."
washingtonwizards,338h95,anon__sequitur,4,Mon Apr 20 14:53:29 2015 UTC,"yeah, thanks, forgot the seeding, Hawks would be next. I agree, I'm no fan of Wittman, but if he gets us to the conference finals, I think he's safe for the year."
washingtonwizards,338h95,madlate,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:11:29 2015 UTC,"I really see the wiz beating the hawks. I've always felt that we have this potential to overcome difficult opponents if we perform, and when we win against Toronto, I look forward to watching the game"
washingtonwizards,338h95,madlate,10,Tue Apr 21 08:23:34 2015 UTC,"Tbh I dislike Wittman as a coach and would prefer to have basically anyone else, but man it's the playoffs.

washingtonwizards,338h95,Stringphoneinventor,3,Mon Apr 20 14:25:55 2015 UTC,"Well I'm not gonna root for the team to lose.   Wittman is definitely not the coach of the future, but he only has 1yr left (he got 2 years guaranteed and the 3rd year is a team option, same as D Casey's deal iirc) and I doubt our owner will axe him prematurely.   A bigger problem is the Wizards GM, Ernie Grunfeld, who's contract expires this summer. If he is extended I don't know what I'm going to do"
washingtonwizards,338h95,anon__sequitur,1 point,Mon Apr 20 14:43:05 2015 UTC,"Yea we're in pretty similar situations with our coaches, young developing players, etc. I also posted something about Casey as a coach to see where Raptor fans stand on him. I like him and so do a lot of people but the recent trend has been to hate on him like every coach in the past"
washingtonwizards,338h95,Gr8WallofChinatown,3,Mon Apr 20 15:07:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks primarily to Reddit, it has become popular to bash Wittman.  I still believe in Wittman, and really there is no actual proof that the players feel otherwise.    The Wiz defence is really good.  Especially on inbound plays.  Offensively, I'm not convinced our lackluster scoring is due to any one reason. John's jumpshooting remains unacceptably bad, Bradley has had a tough year physically and mentally, Otto could be good but he basically sucks, and our hired guns Rasual and Martell have been shooting nothing but blanks for 3 months.    Is Wittman the best coach? No.  But great NBA coaches don't just grow on trees, and most of them have jobs already.    TL/DR; It isn't worth firing Wittman just because Reddit thinks he is a bad coach, and there aren't many realistic, acceptable replacements out there."
washingtonwizards,338h95,white_light-king,4,Mon Apr 20 14:45:23 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I'm thinking. Wittman isn't the greatest coach around but neither was our team a few years back. I don't give him the full credit to bringing the team to where we are at now but he definitely helped.   I don't really look at him as a bad coach. He has his benefits and drawbacks like any other coach. However, I do wish he played Otto more throughout the year, instead of throwing him out there for 34 minutes in the first game of the playoffs."
washingtonwizards,338h95,spiiierce,3,Mon Apr 20 16:01:43 2015 UTC,"I would't go quite so far as you, but I definitely think the tone of reddit commentary re Wittman is ridiculous. There seems to be this idea that if we fire Wittman any replacement must be better, but I have no idea why people think that to be true. I'd love to get a really great coach, but the great ones are all taken and finding the next great one is a crapshoot. Same with GM. I don't think Grunfeld's going to be winning executive of the year, but overall I think he's done well, especially when you give him credit for having made some bad moves in the silly ""win now"" strategy forced on him by Abe Pollin in his later years."
washingtonwizards,336qsx,WizOfAwesSite,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:43:21 2015 UTC,"in my opinion, Otto's biggest strength is defending bigger wings/guards. He's agility and length just annoys them. This was evident when Otto shutdown Derozan. In your perspective, what is Otto's biggest strength?"

washingtonwizards,3320yi,Shaidester,1 point,Sun Apr 19 01:29:58 2015 UTC,During the season he was doing too much ball watching. It led to some good steals but it also led to some easy baskets like that dunk at the end of the game for Derozan. He is learning when to do it and when he locks in is a lot better than people think.

Sort of like the Lebron system when he was in Miami (Drive in, kick out)  Otto, young guy with potential who coach refuses to give minutes to(other than today, he got 33minutes !)  Gooden extremely energetic guy who hustles for rebounds and catch and shoots midrange   Same goes for Humphries, his job is to make those mid range passes off of John Wall.  TLDR: our coach is shit."

Regarding our team...we were pretty good when we had Gilbert Arenas on our squad but LeBron would always knock us out of the playoffs. Once Gilbert got in trouble for the guns in the locker thing and trying to come back from injury he was out of the NBA and we kinda sucked for a lonnnng time. But now we have a developed Wall (crazy quick) and Beal surrounded by some veterans. Gortat and Nene came along and kind of changed the whole vibe of the dumpster fire of the team into a team that could actually contend. Our coach blows...loves midrange shots (especially by bigs), incompetent play calls, dumb rotations, etc. Hoping for Alvin Gentry to come in next year and take the reins."

washingtonwizards,32w2yi,arsnic29,11,Fri Apr 17 04:46:47 2015 UTC,"Washington sports fans have become pretty jaded due to our lack of postseason wins or presence in the postseason at all recently. Many Washington sports fans never cheer too hard even when things look great because in the back of their minds they know the other shoe will drop and they'll be out of the playoffs as per usual. I also think many people don't have much faith in Randy who should be getting much more out of this talented team than he does. Personally, I'm sort of torn. While I'd like to see the Wiz win the series I'd REALLY like to see us get a new coach and a quick first round exit in the playoffs could hopefully spur that. I do think the series will go to a minimum of 6 and could really see either team advancing. Good luck."
washingtonwizards,32w2yi,Yourdomdaddy,3,Fri Apr 17 05:14:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. And because we have been an under .500 team since our 22-8 (right?) start, it's hard to be overly optimistic. This season started with so much energy and enthusiasm. Wall playing better each night. He and Pierce having so much fun. Humphries frickin tearing it up. Since then, we've been moving sideways.  That being said, I'm all in. We can beat any team in the East, except the Hawks, in my opinion. Even with Atlanta, anything is possible, right?"
washingtonwizards,32w2yi,ohgosh_thejosh,3,Fri Apr 17 05:27:46 2015 UTC,"That's so interesting. I feel like us Raptor fans have a similar mentality. Granted, we hope and get excited about wanting to win this series, but we also hate our coach, regressed after an amazing start, and tend to have a mentality of ""things will go wrong anyway"" a lot of the time."
washingtonwizards,32w2yi,Dr_Dugtrio,6,Fri Apr 17 06:08:27 2015 UTC,"It was mentioned already, but Randy Wittman will hold us back, and I think I speak for a lot of D.C. fans that sometimes the short term loss(getting bounced in the first round) is better than the long-term loss(having to keep Randy any longer). In sports its often a small window when you can win a championship and we just don't want to see Wall, Beal, and Gortat wasted due to fixable issues, it's not all on Randy either, a lot has to do with out front office making us so old so quick but that's a discussion for another day.   That being said, the reason many of us aren't as enthusiastic as we could be For This Series is that we match up so poorly with the Raptors. If we have any wing player that isn't named Otto or Temple our perimeter defense falls apart. We got old so fast this season and the way our defense is designed wing players have to flash down low and still be bale to get back and play good one on one defense with a perimeter shooter. That worked well with Ariza and a healthy-ish Webster last season but now we have Pierce, Butler, broken-Webster and if they double down they're not getting back, and if they do somehow get back their guy is just gonna blow by them. The Raptors take a ton of 3s which lines up poorly with our current defense.   Our defense has also shown itself to be incredibly susceptible to good guard play, we get burned repeatedly by guards who can get to the line or create their own shot. The Raptors will often run 3 guards and go wit a small line-up. Another bad match up.   Both of these things are overcome-able but our biggest weakness is how you do that. The playoffs is where coaching is at its most important, game to game adjustments and playing a specific type of ball. I think Randy is gonna get exposed in a pretty ugly way."

washingtonwizards,32vqjp,dubidubidoorafa,7,Fri Apr 17 02:45:28 2015 UTC,"a) He's a defensive-minded coach; that being said, his offensive gameplan is horrendous; the team is shooting long-range two-point jump-shots - the worst percentage of jump-shots - and are awful at it  b) Because the team is shooting long-twos, Beal's development has slightly gotten worse; yes, he's only 21, but still - the Wizards drafted the youngster to be a three-point shooter - a la Ray Allen; instead, there are articles like this one  c) Instead of giving the second-year player Otto Porter playing time at the Small Forward position during the season, Wittman instead gave the minutes to 35-year-old (ancient in NBA terms) Rasual Butler; sure, Butler was en fuego to start the season, but has been lackluster ever since; and when Otto Porter is in the game, the Wizards hit another gear on offense and defense.  d) And, another Wittman mistake: he has consistently benched Marcin Gortat in the fourth quarter of games - no, this is not a five-minute breather; Gortat is on the bench for the entire fourth quarter, no matter what the score is - a major coaching blunder, among the others listed above."
washingtonwizards,32vqjp,skinsballr,4,Fri Apr 17 02:58:41 2015 UTC,Ah I see. Is he doing anything different though from what he did last year? I feel the Wizards are very talented but just used inefficiently. You got two very useful bigs in Nene and Gortat . John Wall is one of the best PGs in the league. Beal is an up and coming shooter. And I would think having Paul Pierce on your team is nothing but an advantage. Just having the bigs of NeNe and Gorat and the facilitator in Wall should be lethal.
washingtonwizards,32vqjp,skinsballr,3,Fri Apr 17 03:29:15 2015 UTC,"It's pretty much the same team, except with the inclusion of The Truth and the loss of Ariza. We pretty much have a great team that's being hindered by Wittman; had we had any other coach (okay, not any other coach), but a more competent, offensive-oriented coach (that went against those points I brought up earlier), we would easily be a top-3 team in the east."
washingtonwizards,32vqjp,Dr_Dugtrio,5,Fri Apr 17 04:06:55 2015 UTC,"Rewind, we got hurt way worse by injuries this season(Humphries, Temple, Beal, Nene, Pierce), combined with trading / release a lot of youth for very old players. Wittman is terrible and holding us back for sure, but his bad coaching wasn't made any better by poor GMing. Example - Butler was on fire to start and terrible since, would it not have made sense to keep Glen Rice Jr. THE LEADING SCORER OF THE SUMMER LEAGUE and let him split time with Otto and develop? Surely his defense cant possibly be any worse than Butler and he could also be played at the 2 to give Beal a rest. Or, instead of trading away Andre(the active career assist leader) because Wittman was an idiot why not just stick to your guns and force Randy to work with him.   TL:DR - Bad coaching was made worse by bad GMing and we had many more key injuries this year over last year."

washingtonwizards,32t2qb,undercoverhipster,6,Thu Apr 16 23:36:43 2015 UTC,"I would be in favor of a name change. I think the Wizards name has no real marketing value in this town, since the Wizards era has largely been defined by Michael Jordan and Gilbert arenas, both of whom are not great legacy team members. The name is not really taken seriously by a lot of long time fans, and it doesn't really have any significance or meaning. I think if a change was going to be made, now is the time with the current core group of young guys who can carry it into the future. I love all dc sports teams, but I don't have any wizards gear because I can't take it seriously - it's just an irrelevant word that starts with ""w.""  Now, monuments doesn't sound like the answer. But I do like the idea of something tied to the town. The franchise name really sets the tone for how the fans and the players view the organization. I think something more local and meaningful would be an improvement."

washingtonwizards,32tt48,baobao3,2,Thu Apr 16 17:36:15 2015 UTC,Perhaps.  But the starting five of Wall/Beal/Pierce/Nene/Gortat is one of the strongest in the leauge in terms of +/-.  Who would you put at 3?  Butler?  Otto?  Webster!?!?  I don't trust any of those dudes (except maybe Otto) to hold down the fort for long at 3 on defense.  One of the few things Randy did right this year was limit Pierce/Nene.  He was Bizzaro-Thibs in that regard.  I for one am looking forward to Playoff Pierce/Nene because you can tell they've been on cruise control for the last month or so.

Lots of people argued that the Bulls were a matchup nightmare for the Wizards last season.  Also, Toronto hasn't been the same team since the break...last time I checked, we hadn't  played them since January."
washingtonwizards,32rgke,7032CharmCity,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:28:40 2015 UTC,"Cool, that's one game. The matchup record is still clear, over the past 2 seasons, that we do well against them and that Toronto does well against us - including that Bulls series that most people got proven wrong on.   And yes, like I said, Toronto is in a weaker position. They've been slumping hard, and if we were going to want to play them now would be the time. Still say Toronto has advantage."
washingtonwizards,32rgke,Mehberry,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:39:25 2015 UTC,"I agree that they have the advantage on paper, but the game changes a lot int he playoffs.  Defenses clamp and teams slow down, which obviously helps the Wizards.  I'm not so much worried that they have some magic formula to beat the Wizards as they are just a better team overall.  Playoffs are funny though, and Toronto really isn't considered that big of a favorite."
washingtonwizards,32rgke,7032CharmCity,3,Thu Apr 16 18:53:08 2015 UTC,"Personally I think the bench is what does it. Casey is scarcely better than Wittman, Wall is clearly ahead of Lowry just as DeRozan is ahead of Beal, and Nene/Gortat will likely have a slight edge (though I'm less confident in Nene than Gortat). Their bench, however, is leagues ahead of ours.  While I think he's more than overrated for the award, Lou Williams is a 6th Man candidate. Vasquez is a very capable point guard as well. Our best man off the bench at this point is probably Humphries and he's still recovering from injury (mostly recovered but still a concern). Amir and Patterson are capable, if Ross decides to be good he can shred us, and Hansbrough will be an annoyance.   We have a very raw Otto porter, a sporadic Ramon Sessions, no Temple (who i wouldn't want to particularly hang my hat on anyway, but he's the best option we have), Will Bynum, Drew Gooden - who at his best does well but is even more sporadic than Sessions (disclaimer: I have a notable loathing of Gooden) and a recently slumping Kevin Seraphin. While playoffs generally mean more starter minutes, we've got to put the bench in eventually and at best it'll likely be voluntary bleeding and tired starters."
washingtonwizards,32rgke,Mehberry,1 point,Thu Apr 16 19:14:58 2015 UTC,"Good analysis.  The bench has bled us all season and will likely continue to do so in the playoffs.  Again though, the benches shorten and starters play more.  That can only help the Wiz."
washingtonwizards,32u2it,WizOfAwesSite,3,Thu Apr 16 18:42:20 2015 UTC,"Yea I don't get why someone says the other team doesn't have ""It"" when his team himself doesn't have it. Its different if he were on the Cavs or Golden State, or even the Bulls. Shaking my head at the hypocrisy..."
washingtonwizards,32u2it,mrmartis,2,Thu Apr 16 20:37:18 2015 UTC,Yeah but he wasn't talking about us. If he said we had it (which we don't) that would make him a hypocrite.
washingtonwizards,32u2it,Zomby24,2,Fri Apr 17 00:16:16 2015 UTC,So does the entire Eastern conference except Cleveland and MAYBE Chicago/Atlanta

washingtonwizards,32refy,simple7on,10,Thu Apr 16 02:53:36 2015 UTC,"I like Toronto as a city, and Raps fans have suffered enough over the years. Best of luck to both teams, stay healthy, and may the winner upset the Hawks in the 2nd round."

washingtonwizards,32refy,Obersts001,6,Thu Apr 16 02:43:47 2015 UTC,If we make it to the 2nd round he's staying. They showed last year they don't have the balls to fire him if we advance

Plus, fans always need an extra storyline to get pumped about.  Personally I'm glad Pierce is on your team, would rather play him and Porter in that 3 spot than Ariza! This is going to be great."
washingtonwizards,32refy,Aintboutdatlyfe,0,Thu Apr 16 14:57:17 2015 UTC,"Because Pierce likes to talk a lot of shit about us, so its only natural that's what our focus is on rn."

washingtonwizards,32refy,happyflappypancakes,6,Fri Apr 17 20:29:36 2015 UTC,Fear DeRozan. This series will be his coming out party and cement his status as an all-star caliber player. Raps in 4..err 6!
washingtonwizards,32refy,Boymankid,1 point,Thu Apr 16 02:48:28 2015 UTC,I predict DeRozan to shoot y'all out of at least one game.

washingtonwizards,32refy,Chainfire99,0,Thu Apr 16 19:09:13 2015 UTC,"How did we match up better with the Bulls, besides Toronto playing small, their team is weaker, their bench is a lot deeper too.  Also, Lowry been hampered with back problems. Only thing I'm scared of is how Wizards didn't contain Lou Williams once in any of our match ups. If we slow him down, I think this a relatively great match-up."
washingtonwizards,32refy,leo2k2ndc,7,Thu Apr 16 11:44:03 2015 UTC,Does DeRozan not exist? I think there was a stat floating around that he waa #2 in ppg in the East since March 1st.
washingtonwizards,32refy,themeinmercer,1 point,Thu Apr 16 16:17:27 2015 UTC,"I forgot about him, but he is actually really good, stat wise. He just never seemed to fry us like Lowry and Williams does."
washingtonwizards,32refy,thetruthhurts34,1 point,Thu Apr 16 16:25:18 2015 UTC,yeah i think it's easy to want the bulls after a very easy win for the wiz last year but i think they will take the raps down. i want to like them but can they defend down the stretch without fouling?
washingtonwizards,32refy,Gr8WallofChinatown,-42,Thu Apr 16 19:14:59 2015 UTC,"Raptors fans are so obnoxious. They blame the refs for anything!
