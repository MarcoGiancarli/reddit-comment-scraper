drawing,3e2bvu,Big_Be4r,17,Tue Jul 21 13:13:20 2015 UTC,Looks like an album cover for a metal band or something like that.
drawing,3e2bvu,D4FTPUNKF4N,4,Tue Jul 21 13:22:44 2015 UTC,Agreed. There is an r/Albumart. I am subscribed to it and for a second I thought this was one.
drawing,3e2bvu,Suszynski,14,Tue Jul 21 18:22:50 2015 UTC,"Looks great! And don't let color blindness get you down. Some of the greatest artists in history have had stigmatisms that impaired their vision, allowing them to see through literally a different lens than everyone else."
drawing,3e2bvu,amphibian87,4,Tue Jul 21 14:20:20 2015 UTC,"An astigmatism doesn't affect one's color vision I thought it's the lack of certain cones or rods that caused it?   Either way, as someone with both deuteranopia and protanopia this article convinced me Van Gogh was colorblind. To me, the works look the same side by side and to my non-colorblind friends they look totally different. They say the original Gogh versions are more ""out there.""   So, OP don't let it get you down, you can use it to do something really cool. A non-colorblind might not draw, for instance, a field of wheat as red and purple, or a teal iris, etc. One can still create beautiful art with ""wrong"" colors."

drawing,3e2bvu,MMSTINGRAY,3,Tue Jul 21 19:25:33 2015 UTC,I think a different perspective can be helpful in regards to all art really. It is just not often so literally as the case of a colour blind person doing visual art.
drawing,3e2bvu,lachattequinage,11,Tue Jul 21 20:01:23 2015 UTC,Hi friend. I think the colors work well actually. I'm color blind myself and I love using colored pencils.  I also love drawing realistically but I don't think about getting the colors 'wrong' at all ; I think it gives it a more personal touch.   Thank you for sharing your art.

drawing,3dv55c,itwillmakesenselater,8,Sun Jul 19 23:18:07 2015 UTC,I think it's stunning.  My only critique would be the contrast.  Maybe run it through photoshop and see what it would look like if you darkened the shadows?  But that depends what look you're going for.  The lightness of it now makes it look ethereal.  I think going a touch darker on the blacks would make it more realistic.
drawing,3dv55c,TheDevilsFair,5,Mon Jul 20 00:06:46 2015 UTC,"So, yeah, no one is gonna say anything needs to be corrected, because there isn't anything to correct!  But, if you wanna go to the next level, try outlining with darker colors (in this case, orange-red for the scales) to pop-out the drawing. Use prismacolor verithin.   It's not a correction, but it is a way to make the drawing that much more interesting."
drawing,3dv55c,mthead911,4,Mon Jul 20 02:14:52 2015 UTC,"Overall 7.2/10  My favorite part is the white patch under the eye to the chin. I like how the fish seems to be staring off into the distance with a look of almost horror, or not knowing what it's seeing. I think the fin's positioning lacks depth, as if the shape is wrong.  The black shadowing on the undersides of the tails could be better. Continue drawing, practicing every day, and you'll be into the realms of photo-realism relatively quickly. You have a good eye, and good execution. Wish I could give you more, but that's about all I have."

drawing,3dwmrm,RazberiStarfish,5,Mon Jul 20 03:39:28 2015 UTC,"Nice work!  Just one comment:  You can use line weights to help add depth to a drawing. For example you can make the outline of an object thicker to make it appear more ""in front of"" another object.

drawing,3e0320,footballa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:39:57 2015 UTC,draw a grid on some acetate and hold it up between you and the scene you are drawing. Draw a grid on the paper you are drawing onto and transfer the contents of each little box from the acetate to your page.  This helps you to see what you are drawing because it makes you look at it in a different way....alienating your eye and making you see the objects as a series of planes rather than what you think you see.  It also helps because it gives you clear reference points so drawing your scene becomes a technical exercise that most people can do.  use the grid a few times and then try drawing without it and see if you can just mentally imagine the grid. That's what artists are doing when you see them holding a pencil or brush at arm's length  and  squinting at it.
drawing,3dxox7,enlighterner,4,Mon Jul 20 11:48:53 2015 UTC,"Nice detail in the face and eyes!  A few things: 1. Using charcoal clean up his LEFT side of the head wrap.  This is apparently where the light is coming from and will help define that edge from being too  .... nebulous. 2. Finish his RIGHT shoulder. It just ends abruptly and arbitrarily. 3. Continue to develop his LEFT ear (the one that gets direct light).  Actually develop both of them further.  4. What do you think of your mid-tones on this drawing? I think you should re-analyze the mid-tones on his face in particular because overall the values appear too dark giving the superficial appearance of an overworked drawing, which can happen with charcoal (my drawings suffer from this).  Overall a very good piece! Keep it up."

The front highlights will then be dominantly white. They will stand out and make the whole more 3D.  To sum up - Just make the back highlights less white and you'll see a big difference.

It's def. looking like a mini, but i would adivise you to look deeper into perspective especially how foreshortening affects simple forms like circles. It seems to me you've used a foto as reference. Maybe in order to draw a car in a believeble matter you could draw them in front and sideview first keeping it in profile.  Really studying the form before applying perspective to it.   Lastly I recommend reading scott robertsons books on perspective and rendering. He combines his books with youtube videos, so you really get an indeoth look into the process of a designer."

drawing,3dsl7f,uhdele,5,Sun Jul 19 01:31:46 2015 UTC,"I've learned that the best critic is yourself. When it comes to art and being an artist, no one is going to be as hard on you as you are on yourself. Personally, for me its a good thing. Self criticism drives me. However, you did come to Reddit for feedback. My response to that is Reddit can be helpful sometimes. However, in person conversations with teachers and experienced artists is the best way to go externally. edit: also, in response to GoofMaster, i recommend finishing a piece when you feel its finished. There's no mistaking that feeling of satisfaction when looking at your own work, knowing that its done."
drawing,3dsl7f,DrDonuts,5,Sun Jul 19 07:20:36 2015 UTC,"I know theres always room for improvement, but youre on the right track to where you really dont need feedback. Theres not many people that really are at your level."
drawing,3dsl7f,HEDYLAMARR2CHAINZ,6,Sun Jul 19 01:51:00 2015 UTC,"All right, fine, I will feedback with a rant on this:  First, this is quite good, and that's fine.  Hyperrealism/photorealism hasn't been popular since the 80's, and it's been gaining in popularity for the past 5 years or so.  The trouble with the style is that the output can only be as good as the photo references, and a lot tends to feel sterile.  So whilst the technical exercise is impressive, hyperrealism tends to be low on emotional content.      The main reasons for the sterility are that even when reference photos are taken by the artist, their drawing/painting skills tend to far outweigh their grasp of photography, and, many realist artists cannot draw even close to as realistic from imagination, meaning that a scene cannot be emotionlally and freshly crafted, due to everything being dependent on the photo reference.  It is this quality of being able to understand how humans perceive materials and light, that is required to craft scenes with warmth and a feeling of the human experience.  The best modern hyperrealism artists do understand exaggeration, materials, light, and visual perception, but mostly, the scene is a religion that is guided by necessity for rigidity and technical reproduction of what is falsely believed to be a true representation of physical reality.     Despite still being a form of realism, many Rennaissance art differs from modern realism, primarily because Renaissance artists worked to have an inherent understanding of materials, light, and human perception.  So even though there are scenes with fucked human proportions or wonkiness, there are also many depictions of people and objects that are more real than even photos, especially when viewed in person.  How is this possible?  Because by understanding visual perception, qualities of light interacting with materials to create form can be exaggerated.  Also, due to no photo reference, paintings were a depiction of a scene as viewed with 2 eyes, as opposed to viewed with the 1 eye of a camera.  Also, most detail is in the mid and mid-lows, and most modern camera equipment cannot capture such details in shadows.  That, combined with sensor response curves, results in images that seem real, but are actually quite far from the way humans see the world.     In that sense, ""photorealism"" is an accurate name, if to mean ""the realism of depicting a photo"", because as an art form, it mostly doesn't have shit to do with the world as seen.     I have nothing against photography as an art form, btw.  The point I'm trying to make is that hyperrealism- of course just my opinion!- is sort of hackey and shit; a style that implies reality, but fundamentally says ""look at a photo reproduction I did by hand"".     In some sort of irony, by backing away from the vision depicted by photos and adding things that a camera would never capture, drawings/paintings can feel much more real than a photo ever could.      Sooo, if I'm to be more constructive...  You're technically skilled, but where you direct that skill can have a huge difference in quality and memorability of output.  This shit tends to be impressive, but highly forgetful.  Much like modern Hollywood action films, the superficial impressiveness cannot replace emotionality when it comes to being memorable. Chuck Close is memorable, because- as is apparent in his blob type color series- he highly understands how human eyes perceive, and, his reference shots depicted simplicity and humanity.  So I hope you find a niche for your technical skill that can depict heart, warmth, and life force, because the scene is full of highly technical wankers who believe in camera-truth and don't give a shit.  There is more to depicting reality, than what we're shown reality is by a camera.  Godspeed, fellow artist."

You've successfully put in words what I've been struggling to. 9/10 times I can tell whether something was drawn/painted directly from one photo reference and it cheapens the art for me. I know there are many different types of artists and I may be biased as an illustrator, but to me the strongest artists are those who excel in both technical skill and life observation/imagination."
drawing,3dsl7f,wowzasauce,3,Sun Jul 19 12:53:14 2015 UTC,"Definitely-- the strongest artists tend to have many influences, are multi disciplinary, and have a solid coordination between their inside world and the outside world.

drawing,3dsl7f,peepeeland,2,Mon Jul 20 05:00:26 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you felt the need to explain what the internet is to me, but sure I agree.

Considering you're not familiar at all with my background and critiquing needs, which you've done twice now, you're not in the place to decide if critiques are helpful or not. I don't feel the need to explain why I need to come to places like this to help me, so I will continue to do so until I can get some from other peers. I have trouble figuring out which comments are out of care and those that are just to hear themselves talk about things they know, so I very much appreciate the time you took to possibly give me a point of view I didn't already have"

I was gonna write that maybe the shadow under the nose was too dark, because emphasizing the black of the eyelashes and eyebrows, whilst pulling back on other black areas to make them dark grey, would help with the ever-important dynamic range in shadows, pushing the illusion of form (and with ideas that reflected light in the nose shadow could also help).

My best advice would be to put in your darkest shadows in the hair to give yourself something to work from and then find small sections of hair and shade them in individually and make sure to leave the highlights cause you can always darken them after if their too bright

Examples the hair on the right side by her eye and over her shirt pop out and feel more real than the rest of the picture, the contrasts and value changes did this.  Her cheeks and eye sockets don't change enough and thus make her appear flat, I know she has a flatter facial structure, but she looks all the way flat.  Not bad though for not being in practice :)"
drawing,3dpoig,ThrowingAwayJehovah,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:08:19 2015 UTC,"Portraits can be difficult, you did a good job capturing the structure of the face, but I agree with /u/ThrowingAwayJehovah, in that there should be a more evident change in values. Working with different types of pencils can help achieve those dark/light contrasts.   Also, don't be afraid to bring hard lines into your work, you can always soften sharp line work with shading but it will introduce more divides between the planes of the face and hair."
drawing,3dpoig,mindsawake,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:51:57 2015 UTC,"Try to make thinner lines when drawing hair or it begins to look clunky. And dont make her top so dark in value, that distracts the viewer from the face. Other than that everything looks pretty nice."

drawing,3dq220,Raikosaur,3,Sat Jul 18 09:44:55 2015 UTC,Depends on what you are looking for.  I recommend the book Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I find stuff i like as inspiration and try and copy that.  Also use a grid layer to help with scale and perspective. Break down complex objects into base forms blocks cylinders spheres etc and build up from that.

drawing,3dq220,HippiPrince,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:44:54 2015 UTC,"I just keep doodling. Draw. Draw until you get used to some things whether be it technique or style. Then you just improve time by time. Eventually by then, you get to find out the different styles you end up having/learning. I used to draw on the back side of my homework. They would have unfinished drawings depicting whatever topic or situation it has on it. And i would ""finish"" the drawing.thks was in elememtary school. Then i started drawing characters from movies, tv shows, cartoons, anime, etc. Around middle and early highschool. Then i started drawing my own stuff in those dofferent styles then to my own way. Until what ever feels comfortable and feels awesome. Ive gotten art classes in school but i just sat there and draw my own stuff. I did learn some cool techniques and i found out that i can do more than i thought i know how to do. Which is pretty neat :)"

drawing,3do1qe,jessew1987,4,Fri Jul 17 21:01:38 2015 UTC,"Don't draw features and then try to put them together to make a face, learn to draw what you see. Portraiture is taking observational drawing to the extreme, requiring you to not just draw a person but the person you're looking at, and you won't be able to do that if you have a set of features you can draw that aren't theirs and you try to cram them into any old face. Drawing what you see as you see it will yield a better portrait on your first try today than a month from now practicing drawing individual features without relationships between other features and unrestricted by the rules of reality.  /r/learnart"
drawing,3do1qe,huisme,3,Sat Jul 18 01:22:22 2015 UTC,Thank you for both the great advice and the subreddit suggestion. I have to admit that I just finished drawing a nose haha. Alright I'm going to start drawing full portraits. Thank you stranger
drawing,3do1qe,huisme,2,Sat Jul 18 03:09:32 2015 UTC,I took your advice and drew a portrait. Any tips would be appreciated. http://imgur.com/e1pNvJi
drawing,3do1qe,OedipusOrca,3,Sun Jul 19 04:18:55 2015 UTC,"It's a lot like some of my portraits after I was told to stop drawing individual features. What you need to do is spend more time drawing the relationships between features and the edges of the face before trying to fill in the details of the features. While you might feel you're getting less done in two hours the incomplete features will be in the right place, at all the weird angles and uneven spacing that makes an individual. If you draw a person's nose perfectly but two degrees of its axis on the subject's face you're farther off than you would have been aligning the nose properly and stopping half way through.  Remember that drawing is re-drawing. When you see mistakes you stop what you're doing and correct them, but don't develop past what you might call the skeleton of the drawing lest the next time you correct the same spot you smear your page with all the detail you drew.  Are you using your finger to shade? It's a far more important skill that produces superior results to learn to craft gradations with your pencils/charcoal/etc.  Don't get cought up in one feature. Work across the whole page, in a pattern if you must, making adjustments on everything to bring everything closer to correct at once, lest you leave a portion behind and make your progress lopsided. I've had a couple spots on my portraits fall behind in adjustments and I just left it until 'later' until they became the big sore in the middle of my paper.  Make your darks darker to make your brights brighter. Find the darkest and lightest points on the subject and place them before putting tone into everything else so you have a better idea of how darkest, extra dark, dark, medium dark, medium, medium bright, bright, extra bright, and brightest look. Keeping everything about the same tone makes even a very well laid out drawing look flat and lifeless.  There''s a lot more advice waiting on /r/learnart ;)"

drawing,3dlg4c,xofux,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:03:44 2015 UTC,"you show awareness of the three d ness of a face, you tried to shade the nose in the right place and did a fairly good attempt at hair.  next time dont be so hard on the outline of the shadow side of the face (i'm thinking that's the left side of this) and for the hair set down a base and then put in the darker or lighter 'hairs' if you will. but all in all, a damn good start."

drawing,3dg4is,Beckawk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:18:50 2015 UTC,I've always found stippling/hatching relaxing when I'm feeling stressed/anxious. Do you find that helps you too?
drawing,3dg4is,TheDevilsFair,11,Fri Jul 17 09:02:19 2015 UTC,I love the block type cross-hatching you've used to fill in the sky on some of your drawings.  There's something so utilitarian about it... but it really sets the mood.  Thanks for sharing your story!
drawing,3dg4is,Ididntmakethisforyou,11,Thu Jul 16 02:03:40 2015 UTC,"Fantastic. You made my night with your art. I had a rough day and was feeling down. Sometimes it feels like no one else has ever been there. Depression is such a dark and lonely place. You're someone I've never met and probably never will meet, but you really lifted my spirits.  Thank you. Keep drawing."

drawing,3dg4is,Cyadome,3,Thu Jul 16 08:13:28 2015 UTC,This is awesome. I love the precision of your drawings - I often find it hard to maintain precision in my drawings when they spread across the page. But your drawings are so cool!
drawing,3dg4is,ergman,2,Thu Jul 16 11:09:09 2015 UTC,"As a novice drawing I just wanted to say these are amazing. For someone like myself who is getting into drawing to relieve stress and to get my mind off things, do you have any tips for a beginner as far as inspirations?"
drawing,3dg4is,ebtgbdc,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:25:17 2015 UTC,"Yes! 1. This one may apply to me more, but when I started drawing again last year after the incident, I desperately wanted perfection. I would actually break down crying because I hated how my drawings were never good enough. At some point I had to learn to accept my drawings for what they were, to accept my style and taste for what it is, and to accept that there will always be someone better, but no one can express yourself the way you can. Do not get discouraged when drawing. Don't aim to be the best, aim to express yourself the best you can. That's not to say you need to make some super deep drawing every day, just that at some points you should express yourself. On that note however...   It really does take practice. I've been drawing since I was 2. I'm 19 years old now. The only time I was not drawing was the last two years of high school, ironically the only time I ever really took an art class. There would be periods though, weeks or maybe even a few months, where I wouldn't draw anything. Then at some point something would change and I would feel like drawing again. That's been a constant thing my whole life. You should just keep drawing when you have the urge. If you want to get 'good' quickly then you should practice a lot every day. If not, just draw when you feel like it over the course of a long time. Always doodle when you have time for it, even if it's just on napkins while waiting for food. I tend to draw on my hand/arm a lot when I don't have paper nearby, though ink poisoning might be possible (never really looked it up, ha).  If you don't feel it, that's okay. It's okay to have artist's block. Draw whatever you want whenever you want. If you can, push yourself to try new things, but if you're not feeling it, then you don't have to. It's okay to copy someone else's drawing or picture for practice and inspiration, as long as you're not posting online and taking credit. Don't feel bad if all you're doing is copying other people's stuff--that's how art evolves. It's good practice. At some point you should try to branch out and do your own thing, but ultimately as long as your relieving stress, that's all that matters. For doing more expressive stuff, what helps me is I just try to draw weird concepts or thoughts. Try to personify or describe your thoughts and feelings and then draw what you think of. For example, when talking with my therapist last summer, she told me that I shouldn't trust all the thoughts that come into my head so easily, that there were bad thoughts. That made me think of the 'bad thoughts' as sly monsters, like snakes whispering in your head. Hence the drawing ""bad thoughts"" with dragon things coming out of the brain. Whatever you want. Drawing the way you imagine historical events, scenes from religious texts or stories (including modern ones), etc, are all good ways to get inspired.   tl;dr have fun and do whatever you want!"
drawing,3dg4is,Donkeydonkeydonk,2,Thu Jul 16 20:18:32 2015 UTC,"Sending good thoughts your way for continued recovery.  There's something really engrossing about your work, I couldn't look away from the artist's block, for example.  Drawing is a release for me and I don't make enough time for it, I will have to try to do some abstracts perhaps!"
drawing,3dg4is,camboj,2,Thu Jul 16 13:04:53 2015 UTC,"I love your style of drawing. Haven't gone through all of them yet, but I really love all of it and the king (?). Wish I could draw like this."

drawing,3dkqki,CrossMaster_Flash,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:40:43 2015 UTC,"I also have no idea. But to be really honest, when I saw the prices you mention I thought they were too low. And I mean REALLY low. I would at least consider 10 times that for the minimum. You have to remember that its not simply a drawing, but they are paying for design that will represent their company."
drawing,3dkqki,DiabolusBR,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:05:00 2015 UTC,"I would suggest that you attempt to calculate the value they expect to gain from your work. You want to charge based on the company and how they plan to use your work, not entirely your work itself.  I'm a programmer and reading ""Breaking the Time Barrier"" helped me raise my rates and give the confidence boost I needed to ask for it."

drawing,3dhhqi,lesgetweirdd,3,Thu Jul 16 08:53:20 2015 UTC,"One of my favourite scenes in my favourite movie! This is really nicely done.   If anything, you might consider making your dark tones a little darker. It helps add depth and higher contrast to the drawing. It's tough to do with graphite, but just try it out.   But other than that, this is great work! I especially like that it appears to be a frame while Jack's in the middle of saying ""Heeeeere's"", rather than the classic ""Johnny!"" line. That's a neat little detail. Keep up the good work!"
drawing,3dhhqi,SoulCommodore,2,Thu Jul 16 19:46:34 2015 UTC,Yeah I'll definitely try to darken the darker tones!! While I'm drawing it I'm like oh this looks dark enough and then I go to take a picture of it and then I realize how light I drew some of it. Thank you so much :)
drawing,3dhhqi,SoulCommodore,2,Thu Jul 16 20:47:14 2015 UTC,"Sounds good! The exact same thing happened to me when I started drawing. I'd always think it was dark enough, when really it could have used more.   No problem! Happy drawing!"
