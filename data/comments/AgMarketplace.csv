AgMarketplace,3e652u,throoomeawayylucy,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:54:12 2015 UTC,On some orders yes
AgMarketplace,3e652u,agorythrowaway,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:55:21 2015 UTC,rarely in my experience.  your vendor should be upfront with you about this.  guess it depends on the shipping/package type though?
AgMarketplace,3e652u,bacondev,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:10:24 2015 UTC,"Personally, I wouldn't order anything that requires a signature. If LE intercepts it and decides to bust you, it'll be difficult to tell if you're signing to just receive the package or if you're signing to tell LE that you did in fact order the drugs. That is unless you are quite familiar with your postal worker."
AgMarketplace,3e652u,agorythrowaway,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:36:48 2015 UTC,"I would agree, I've never seen a vendor that would use a sort of shipping/tracking that requires a signature...  most will blatantly specify in their profile.  that being said, even when it doesn't require a signature and you get asked for one, there is a strong school of thought that you should just go with it anyway- sometimes the post office makes mistakes, and if they really want you, they're going to get you...  not pack up and go home when you don't sign.  seems like in the worst case scenario though, it would buy you a little time as well as make things harder for the prosecution in court.    I made a thread about this a while back, thinking that I obviously should not sign, and got quite a few replies from the opposite school of thought.

AgMarketplace,3e3i60,ato72543,3,Tue Jul 21 19:22:29 2015 UTC,"Brother, I have a vendor who claims I posted personal PM shit between us on one of the forums, and therefore he has my address and name flagged and won't sell to me. These motherfuckers FUCKED my order up by putting an incorrect shipping label (well actually one that was torn and hardly readable). Then the fucking pack got returned to sender, to an address that doesn't exist, so finally it shows up over a month later saying it had been returned to sender, to an address that didn't exist...don't ask me how they finally figured my address out and got it to me, but the point is these assholes fucked MY order up. After a week I got a little pissed, because there was NOTHING showing up on the tracking, and I'd been counting on that package. I sent them a message and let them know it was unacceptable and that in the future they should do something to make it right. So they gave me a 100 percent refund and told me if the pack ever shows up to keep it. I post on Nucleus forums, and the only part of that that I ever mentioned on the forum was that I had an order go badly, and they were nice enough to give me a 100 percent refund. Well, when it showed up a month later, I shot them a message and asked them where to send the bitcoin to, because it showed up and I am a man and I am going to pay for it. Well, they tell me not worry about it, it was on the house etc and apologized for their fuck up. That was the last contact until about a week ago. That's when they informed me that I was on the blacklist for copy and pasting PMs on the forums. They couldn't tell me which forum or anything, so I told them if I'm blacklisted they should at least prove that I did what they said. They haven't. I won't name names right now, because I'm hoping they will realize they are in the wrong here, but if they do not, I am going to air them the fuck out for real on the forums.   Anyway, my point is that a lot of these vendors are liars and assholes and aren't man enough to admit they are wrong, so I feel your pain. Fuck 'em."
