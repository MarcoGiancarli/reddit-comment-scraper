FierceFlow,3e1n3y,Jwright0291,3,Tue Jul 21 07:04:31 2015 UTC,I'm not sure the term organic has much meaning when it comes to cosmetics. With food it indicates certain regulations were followed while growing the crops or raising the livestock. I don't think cosmetics are regulated the same way. I just try to use stuff that makes my hair look healthier.

FierceFlow,3e0669,kennethjc,3,Tue Jul 21 03:35:39 2015 UTC,Good advice. A leave in conditioner or oil will probably help keep you from getting quite so sticky. Or perhaps less product.
FierceFlow,3e0669,tvvat_waffle,2,Tue Jul 21 01:08:26 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a plan, I've been thinking about getting a thing of coconut oil, I've heard that's the best.  Do you just massage it through your hair like conditioner?"

Also I've had my hair down like that for around 7 years so I'm pretty used to my stoner Jesus look I feel like a bun looks awkward on me but I'm not sure if it's because I'm so used to it being down or because it just doesn't look right.

You'll get to a point when it's in your eyes and you have trouble keeping it either swept back or to the side and no matter what you do it just looks weird. A hat helps through this period, usually a few months or more.   But I think you can definitely pull off the man-bun. Go for it.

People don't like to hear this, but if you're shooting for a specific length, trimming is only going to prolong the process..  So it's ultimately a choice: 1) do i trim and shape to have a less awkward but more drawn out ""awkward stage?"" or, 2) do i power through to goal length acknowledging my hair doesn't look its best?  Best of luck and keep us updated!"
FierceFlow,3dn7x3,TheMcKnightMare,2,Fri Jul 17 17:41:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Yeah, I have heard advice that I should still get regular trims to protect against split ends.

FierceFlow,3djvee,Teazone,3,Thu Jul 16 21:37:26 2015 UTC,To be fair it's kind of personal preference. Without product it'll look more natural but it might fall in your face a bit more. Let it dry with a side part and who knows maybe it'll stay. You have nice curls so stick it out and eventually you'll find a style that fits you.

I also bought Garnier Fructis Smooth Leave-In Conditioner which I only just began using, so I can't say if it works well yet.  And also, make sure you're using a good conditioner that suits your hair.

FierceFlow,3dfzq1,skalepu13,2,Thu Jul 16 23:09:02 2015 UTC,"I haven't played much of Unity mainly because I heard it was puddle of wank. My experience with it was me running in a crowd of civilians and trying to figure out what's the best way to murder everyone.   I might not get Syndicate since Fallout 4, Black Ops 3, and Battlefront 3 are all coming out within the same timeframe. It looks like it's going to be better than Unity and Black flag, so I'll have to borrow It from a friend. For the record, I absolutely hated Black Flag."

I completed all of the Homestead missions, but I still found his character lacked something.

My short summary:   Shampoo a lot less often, or go no-poo... but condition/rinse frequently, and use cool/cold water to help prevent it from drying out take biotin supplements, a multivitamin, and maybe bamboo extract consider massaging oil into the scalp occasionally - coconut oil, argan oil, grapeseed, etc... there are a variety of options. See also - leave in conditioner Eat healthy, exercise, drink lots of water Don't cut it ever.  Or if you are really desperate just get the most basic tiny trim to clean up the ends Most of all: PATIENCE.  This is a long process and it will get awkward.

FierceFlow,3d9kjs,Vaagur,3,Tue Jul 14 15:51:19 2015 UTC,"1) Since it's curly and rather frizzy, I'll assume it's dry. Mine's like that and I shampoo twice a week and use conditioner everyday. Some people only use conditioner when they shampoo, though.  2) Brushing curly hair is a no no. It will frizz and damage your hair. If you're going to comb it, use a wide tooth comb. Then again, are you not styling your hair as a ""style choice""?  3) Most people will say yes, and it's probably the safest bet. Long hair in men is seen by some people has a lazy, dirty or untidy characteristic. Tying the hair in a bun should give you a more professional appearance overall. That isn't to say you can't wear it down and look professional, but better play the smart card here. Sometimes even women can be seen as unprofessional while wearing their hair down at work."

Aim the blow dryer up and back and brush your hair that way. It will help it stay up rather than falling forward. If you use some product, just a small amount of gel applied to damp hair and then blown/brushed back until dry will help. If you want a part, this is where you can use the dryer to set the part, too, that is to train the hair to fall either direction on the sides of the part."

FierceFlow,3d5gzd,Rdrbarber,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:58:11 2015 UTC,"Waves and curls exist because of hydrogen bonds in the hair. When you apply heat to the hair, those bonds are broken down, allowing the hair to be reshaped. When the hair comes in contact with water, the broken bonds are repaired (because water has hydrogen) and the hair returns to its natural state.  I assume that you are brushing your hair while you dry it, causing it to straighten. You can either try setting the hairdryer on cool or brush/comb your hair before and then hairdry it using a diffuser."

Have you just asked if you could simply come in with a cleaner looking style? Slicked back, man bun, etc?? If you are in sales then slicked back is for you, lol. Johnny Depp in the movie Donnie Brasco had his hair down to his bottom lip, but you couldn't tell because it was always slicked back and had the back trimmed. See if that works."
FierceFlow,3d4czn,darren559,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:19:32 2015 UTC,"I would say that the undercut is pretty versatile. You can have it be more conservative in difference between the top and sides, or you can go more extreme/dramatic with the difference.   Given your boss commented, I'd go on the more conservative side, since you can style into normal hair styles more easily that way if it becomes an issue."

Either way, you can work some product like gel to keep it down.  Aside from eating healthy and exercising to make sure your hair is healthy, probably not much to do about the growth speed. No pills or products will make your hair grow faster. Biotin is a vitamin supplement that supposedly can make your hair and nails grow faster, but afaik nobody was able to prove it scientifically.

FierceFlow,3cxgpy,BlerptheDamnCookie,2,Sat Jul 11 21:47:40 2015 UTC,"Ketoconazole shampoo may cause some hairloss (esp the 2% version. The package comes with a paper that lists side effects). I don't know if it's because it's strong and may induce a temporary shed, or if it's because it's very drying thus increasing chances of hair loss by breakage.  That said, it could just be the ""fairy tale ends"" phenomenon (google that). If You spent a long amount of time growing out your hair without trims, eventually the ends become thin because of the normal growth-and-shed hair cycle. Also some people experience assymetric growth, in which one zone grows faster than the other, enhancing the thinned out look.  I use a Keto shampoo as well for my dandruff (H&S didn't work plus smells too strong) and I dropped regular conditioner for a deep one (I have to leave it for 15 min). I use both twice a week and so far, the conditioner really made a difference. However if You're concerned, visit a dermatologist. Better be safe than sorry."

My last haircut was around 6/7 months ago, would it be enough to get those fairytale ends?"

That said, I try to be very careful in order to not yank/break strands and reduce the bulk even more. Also, according to people in long hair care forums it's easier to do braids and stuff with them because regular layers are ""chunkier"" (is that a word?) And more likely to stick out.  I can't say for sure if it's enough, but 6-7 months = 6-7 cm of growth so there's a chance. If it gets to a point where You can't stop guessing/thinking about it, really, go to a derm. The awkward phase can be stressful enough, adding thickness perception to the mix can end up in a lot of frustration."

FierceFlow,3cvjl5,NeonHair4,2,Sat Jul 11 04:02:14 2015 UTC,"First, an apology. I thought your photo in the OP had some filter or something on it, but it seems it's just low resolution. In any case, I'm really sorry about my mistake, mate.  Back to topic, I think the hair behind the ears is looking very professional. I'm actually imagining you right now behind a counter with that hair. Thing is that the hair on your back might be a little too long in proportion to the rest (but I'm not sure if it's because of the hairstyle or the photo angle). It's not a pretty sounding advice, but from what I can tell from that last picture is that the back could use a trim. If it was going to save my job, setting my hair in the back behind 2 or 3 months wouldn't be a big issue.  The hair on the first pic also seems to work well. So yes, on a hair basis I would hire you."

It will look awkward for a while, but after that you'll be glad you fought it through.   Also, some people might tell you you look feminine with long hair and (in case you're heterosexual) that girls don't like long haired guys. That is not true, there are ones that do, and in my opinion, it is better to wait for that one, so that you understand each other better.  I recommend taking pictures of yourself frequently, it helps through times when you feel like it'snot growing at all. It will privide evidence that it does indeed grow.  Good luck, and if you encounter any problems, we're here to help you on this sub.  In case someone in your family is strongly persuading you to cut it, tell them long hair makes you happy, and that you're not going to give up your happiness for the little satisfaction for them, when if you cut it you'd have to spend time with your short-haired dissatisfied yourself 24/7 while they'd only be getting their satisfaction from your short hair a couple of hours a week."

Growing my hair out has been something I've always wanted to do but every time it has gotten kind of long I've cut it because it looked awkward. I'll just need to practice acceptance during that period of time and not act on the desire to cut it. Thanks for the support, man."
FierceFlow,3cotnh,Intricates,12,Thu Jul 9 16:01:39 2015 UTC,I'm a firm believer in no trims until the awkward stage has been conquered.. Anything before that is just going to prolong the worst part of the process
FierceFlow,3cotnh,TheMcKnightMare,2,Thu Jul 9 16:14:56 2015 UTC,"I understand and agree with what you have to say, but I truly think that if I do not get the back fixed now, that it will grow in really ratty and uneven which is not what I want."
FierceFlow,3cotnh,TheMcKnightMare,6,Thu Jul 9 16:19:16 2015 UTC,Well it's of utmost importance that you feel as good as possible about your flow whilst growing it out.. So if you think it'll make the process easier for you then without question do it!
FierceFlow,3cotnh,dwolfy,3,Thu Jul 9 16:31:08 2015 UTC,"I cant see your picture because Imgur is dicks right now. But I always suggest picking up biotin supplements from your closest CVS. Take one tablet every day with breakfast and when your bottle runs out give it another month or two before you pick one back up. If you develop a dependency on biotin your hair can break easier when you're off it. Biotin is a secret little miracle supplement that every lady knows about but for some reason has eluded men. It makes your hair grow really fast.  As for the splittage in the back just deal with it until you're at a length where you can tie it up every night when you go to sleep. When you get out of the shower tie your hair into a bun (one of the twisty buns) and let the hair stay wet for thirty minutes before you untie it. This is gonna help fight breakage and dryness.  Also, never comb your hair wet or damp. Wait until its dry. Start combing closer to the ends and gently work out the knots as you get closer and closer to the roots. This prevents breakage and split ends, which will make your hair grow alot faster really quick.   Shampoo once every two days, condition every day.   Taking care of your hairproperly is going to eat time up out of your day. Maybe an hour max."
FierceFlow,3cotnh,LikeTheTiger,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:42:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the feedback, and trust me, I know how much of a commitment it is, I've done a lot of research.   About the bun though, I've read from other places that putting your  hair in a bun actually causes breakage and that it should be avoided.   I know you say it fights breakage and dryness, but I think im just going to pass on this."
FierceFlow,3cotnh,LikeTheTiger,2,Thu Jul 9 19:17:14 2015 UTC,I went with the decision of non not touching the back and letting it grow! I suppose yesterday was just a bad hair day. The rattiness in the back can be a lot more contained with some effort. Thanks for all the feedback guys!

It does not make sense to me to wait for my hair to grow longer, ill just have to get more cut off to fix the unevenness in the back.   Also, I am looking to take bitoin and a b complex vitamin to make my hair grow healthier. I believe I should fix this problem before I  start taking these vitamins."
FierceFlow,3cotnh,Fletcher-,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:50:17 2015 UTC,"If you really want to eliminate it you would get a pure 100 bowl cut and have it grow out like that.

Just gotta stop using shampoo and let them natural oils build up so you can rock some nice healthy looking curls.  Without moisture and oils curly hair gets unruly, frizzy, and you end up with a poof ball.I usually just wash with conditioner everyday.  In the event my hair is too oily I'll use a sulfate free shampoo.  It's not as harsh as a normal shampoo and it won't totally strip out all the oils."

Basically your scalp is used to all of its natural oils being washed off all the time, so it produces more to compensate. With nopoo you don't remove as much of the oils (which is a good thing!), so your scalp needs some time to adjust.  For an actual ""fix"", I'd second the scalp massage, plus recommend a boar bristle brush which helps distribute the oils throughout your hair so they're not just in your scalp.  (Source, me. No poo for ~10 years, water only for 3.)"

FierceFlow,3c9mxj,harowkun,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:38:53 2015 UTC,Honestly I don't really have an answer for you since I've spent the past year using absolutely no shampoo and only conditioning with coconut oil. I've started getting back into experimenting with using shampoo again because I was curious how different it would feel. Going no poo is very different from using shampoo. When I was washing with water I wouldn't say my hair felt greasy or dirty but it did feel 'heavier' but it also had more volume and body to it so I could easily slick it back and it would stay 'up' and not look greasy. But as you were saying you had clear/white flakes which happened to me too (but only recently actually when I stopped using coconut oil which is why I experimented with getting back into shampoo.) I've noticed when I shampoo it flops more and my hair feels lighter.   There is really no right answer because everyone's hair is totally different. If you hair is too greasy maybe you're using too much conditioner. Maybe you need a lighter conditioner. There really is no one size fits all when it comes to hair if your hair isn't the best with your current regimen maybe add shampoo back in. Try a different shampoo. Sorry for a lengthy post with no real point I'd just been seeing so many posts about doing no poo and I just wanted people to understand that no poo isn't for everyone but you also have to find what works for you. tbh I washed with lemon juice for a little bit and that made my hair feel fantastic. however in the long run lemon juice is not a good substance to wash your hair with. May I ask why you went no poo in the first place?

FierceFlow,3c9mxj,Roren_Marquis,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:24:41 2015 UTC,"Hi!  I have been no shampoo and conditioner or any hair product for approximately 3 plus years now.  The beginning period is a bitch because your scalp is producing all the oils that the shampoo would usually strip out. So your scalp is just kind of freaking out and it needs to level out. It may take a few months.  In my opinion, I would stop with the conditioner as well. It's exacerbating the oils. I don't know how you use the conditioner, but when I used to use it, I would never put it in my scalp. I would have maybe 3-4 inches from my scalp and the rest of the tendrils conditioner. But that's up to you.   When I started out, it was terrible. I used a home remedy. 2 plastic bottles (with a squirt top makes it easier).   1st bottle: 1 part baking soda to 3 parts water. I eye ball this. I don't ever use this because my scalp has tamed out over the years. But I go easy on the baking soda. This concoction is strictly for your scalp. Try to aim this directly into your scalp as possible. Use a toothbrush to dig in there and scrub. For me, I never did more than twice a week. You'll see why. If you use it all the time, it gets a bit, waxy? I can't describe it.  2nd bottle: 1 part apple cider vinegar to 4 parts water. This is your ""conditioner"". It's actually really awesome how soft it makes your hair. USE ONLY ON HAIR, NOT SCALP.   I did this no more than a couple times a week.   Now that my scalp has tamed, I seriously don't use it at all. I only ever use it during weeks where I'm too lazy for my honey scrub.  Honey scrub: it can get expensive because honey is expensive and I get the raw stuff. But I see it as an investment since I don't buy other beauty products.   Equal parts honey and sugar. That's it. PUt it in a jar and leave it in your bathroom. I use it exfoliate my body and to wash my scalp.   I do this maybe a few times during the week. The rest of the time I just rub my fingers in my hair or use a toothbrush to just scrub it clean. ** instead of a toothbrush, get one of those finger nail scrubs in salon stores. The rectangular shaped ones. But use what works for you too.  Sorry for such a long comment. Hope this helps."

FierceFlow,3c5662,TheMcKnightMare,2,Sat Jul 4 22:40:18 2015 UTC,Christ that's magnificent.. I'm currently at a crossroads due to your very issue.. I want to let it get your length.. But my life requires me to keep it tied up about 50% of the time so I'm debating maintaining current length.. What do you do presently to tie it if you don't mind me asking?

Yeah at this length, at least in my opinion, it really starts to get difficult to wear down all the time. I currently just tie it back in one big bun, this is the video where I learned how to do it, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgaBq4RQtu8, I basically use the exact same technique using three hair ties."

FierceFlow,3c5662,foxesareokiguess,2,Sat Jul 4 22:52:39 2015 UTC,"How do you feel about braids? I think with that length it would be a shame to not wear it ""down"" sometimes, but I understand wanting it out of the way.  I highly recommend getting some hair sticks and learning how to use those. It takes a little practice, but it's very secure and comfortable once you get the hang of it. Look up the nautilus bun on YouTube. You should have enough hair for that one.   Also torrinpaige (youtube channel) has tons of amazing styles and while some are definitely oriented to women, there are lots of neutral styles.  Edit: Here you go! Nautilus bun."

Be careful if You're dark haired as it tends to be white and if You apply it wrong it will look ""chalky"".  Boar Bristle Brush. It is used to distribute the oils in the hair. Make sure You finger-comb your hair afterwards to reduce the static. Also detangle your hair before using a BBB. Since it has a lot of bristles it can yank knots easily."

This will make curly hair more wavy and wavy hair closer to straight (Use a straightener if you're feeling bold).  Don't be afraid to tie your hair back or use a bandana to gain control of your curls and pull it back.

The man bun is getting very popular, nobody stares at a man with long hair with that confused look anymore.  Also, yestarday I was at the mall and stopped by a book shop (the most renowned brand where I live). The cashier was a guy with a shaved head, save for a large vertical stripe of hair which was quite long, all slicked back. I think he even had tattoos. That gave me some hope; if a guy with such an outrageous haircut is able to get a job, why shouldn't we too?  Then I went to get my contacts, in a huge store with a lot of costumers, and one of the women there had short bleached hair, earplugs and arms filled with tattoos. Maybe things really are changing."

FierceFlow,3bzgtn,TheMcKnightMare,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:26:53 2015 UTC,"Wash it when you need to, but only condition the ends. If your hair is getting oily quickly, you probably don't need more moisture on your scalp. Wearing it up and off your neck can help keep it clean, and make your daily life more comfortable.   Also if you have weekends off you could stretch washes then and see if it helps your oil glands calm down. Sometimes the more you wash your hair, the oilier it gets, because it keeps getting stripped by the harsh shampoo."

Giving me something to appreciate about myself (while making me more aware of that something in others, making me compare) has rescued a bit of my self esteem, which has always been in sub-zero levels. It made me notice that my ears are a bit pointy or ""elvish"" which I (now) love. It helps somewhat as a radar-filter for jerks. As You know, the uncommon tends to bring out strong reactions, positive or not. The flow is no exception. It has made me more patient and aware of the value of delayed success and the effective > fast mentality. It helps me to educate others a little bit. I'm not part of any subculture, yet I sport long hair and (and soon, black nails). Seeing that shocks others, yet it serves as a chance to see that one does not have to be this or that in order to sport a certain look. On the journey I learned a bunch about hair care and now I can notice when somebody is trying to bullshit me in that ""department"".   Do people treat me differently? Strangers, yes. Friends? Not at all, though I get called ""pretty hair"" from time to time as a joke lol. Kids stare, a lot."

Partly reasoned by my dad also having long hair and me never asking and later saying 'nay'. I do have a story, too: When our family was vacationing outside our nations borders, I had a terrible hairknot (due to 12 year old me not properly combing my hair) and it was so bad that my father had to cut it out of my mane. Ever since then I comb properly and never have had really bad problems again.  How have people treated me throughout my life?  As such I truly couldn't tell if people treat me different, because people have always treated me this way.   Sometimes they ask me about my hair, but I don't think they really think about it that much. I have friends with short hair and I have friends with long hair and observing them I do not see a difference in how they treat each other. Or others outside our particular circles with long hair for that matter.  I consider myself lucky to never have had a truly bad experience. Sure, in elementary and high school I've had other boys call me a girl or other names sometimes (that sucked at the times & definitely was harassment), but nowadays that has stopped (people have matured). I've also never experienced a negative reaction from females. But on the other hand none of them were really that excited about it either. Hah.  How has it changed my life?  It's awesome during the winter, keeps me warm. But have you ever seen people with long hair during the summer? It gets really hot around my head. Mostly I'm having it in a pony tail for that reason alone (because otherwise it's just too hot to bear).  It looks great when a breeze comes by, but I've been vacationing (also all my life) on an island where the winds are never dieing down and it messes with your hair! I have to comb at least thrice a day to keep it proper.  I'm currently studying at my university. And I think this environment is relatively open to longhairs as a whole, mostly because people are really progressive and chill around here. I'm not sure how the job environment is, but I've heard stories of people cutting their hair and regretting it. Wont happen to me though. I'll have a masters degree in IT and hopefully most companies don't care about the hair of their employees. I understand tellers in banks and other people working with customers in such jobs have to show some special kind of outfit/style, but engineers and such mostly don't care about it."

Well, I'm still sort of a lion cub growing his mane, so I haven't much to share yet. Since my early teens I got this urge that I wanted to grow my hair long, but some stuff never played in my favor. Along with this urge, my previously straight hair changed into its curly form, and suddenly hair maintenance was a complete disaster for me. I would start growing it, it reached awkward phase, and got into a huge mess because I didn't know what to do with it.  Then my mother was 100% against it, not because she disliked long haired men, but because she believes it only looks good on men with straight hair. Then everybody in my family would start saying all the time how bad my hair looked like that, and how much better I looked with very short hair. During the few first years they would actually make me cut it, then when they lost that authority they just wouldn't shut up about it and I would end up believing them and go cut it. Rinse and repeat for several years.  At this point I was actually believing it would never work (had this crazy thought that the hair would just keep growing into and endless jewfro) and that maybe it had always been just a teenage whim. But then I realized something; baldness runs in my family and I'm not escaping from it, so if I don't take the chance to grow the hair before it's all gone, I will never be able to anymore. I would always feel like I lost my chance to do something I truly desired, and would always regret it. So I announced my decision and told everyone I was not going be talked out of this, and if they were going to hate it to f*ck off (well, not so blatantly... I think). I guess they accepted it, and never gave me any crap about it anymore. I also changed my hairstyle and started taking better care of my hair, which certainly helped.  Well, that's it, hopefully this story will go on happily for a long time :)"

FierceFlow,3bqzeb,Yamakazi1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:11:39 2015 UTC,"Not every product will damage your hair and I doubt that any will slow the growth rate. The hair grows from the follicle, which is buried beneath the skin. Unless said product causes a lot of breakage which gives the appearance that it's slowing the growth rate, but even then I doubt that it would be a significant difference."
FierceFlow,3bqzeb,EC145,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:34:31 2015 UTC,You should be fine. I either switch between a backwards cap or some leave in conditioner helps it stay free without a cap. I've just recently started pulling mine back into kind of a samurai bun /tail. Looking good.

Come the next cold season I resumed beanie mode, no problem. Now my flow will not permit a cap on my head due to its vigorousness.

From middle school on, my liking for heavy metal grew and I kept seeing men with long hair. It peeked my interest and I started looking into it. Once I got my senior portraits completed (my mother didn't want my hair growing out for the pictures and looking awkward. Can't blame her) I stopped getting haircuts and just let it grow out. Part of me really liked the idea of long hair. While another part felt I should go big and all out with my hair given my history of buzz cuts.     Maintaining my hair is surprisingly not very complex. Girls will compliment me on how soft my hair looks and ask how I do it. Honestly, I just wash it with shampoo and conditioner. Then I'll let it air dry and make sure it's combed. I guess I just got lucky on the quality of hair I have. There is no secret for me. Also every few months I get a trim to keep the ends looking good.   Here's an small album of my progression up today."

Don't cut your hair if you're growing it out. I'm of the camp that says wait a year first, unless you like not having long hair. In which case, I suggest a monthly haircut and a clean up every two weeks.  Do you get where I'm going with this?"
FierceFlow,3bgx7c,AyybelaCishurr,2,Mon Jun 29 10:02:16 2015 UTC,"I got my hair cut a while ago (it was a certain hairstyle, too) and I'm letting it grow out and it's been going well. I suggest letting it grow and once it gets to a certain point, get it trimmed so it's all even. That's what I'm going to do when it's a little longer, and I'm glad I've been letting it grow rather than getting it cut even when it's shorter. Although, it honestly probably wouldn't make a difference, I guess I have just been enjoying letting my hair grow since I haven't really ever done it before where I've wanted it bad enough, haha."

The back grows quicker than the rest because it's lower down on your head, so it helps that yours is short. Also, your fringe is long. When it comes to putting your hair in a bun or putting it behind your ears it will help massively as it already has a head start. The fringe is left hanging out otherwise."

I always get very mixed reaction on whether to keep a beard or not. Half always say to keep it and half say not to, but I think my favorite is actually a very short beard so if I can ever find the perfect trimmer I'll try to straddle short beard/heavy stubble line."

Plus a few years ago I actually buzzed/shaved my head - kept it very VERY short for a long while and it did a great job at that.  Something along these lines - though this is not the one I have. http://www.amazon.com/Conair-Piece-Cordless-Rechargeable-Haircut/dp/B00S7P88Y0/ref=pd_sim_sbs_194_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=1KHPBA3M0W4N8YYFSVW5

If I try to part my hair in the middle, the waves will form an ""M-Shape"" on the top of my head on each side of the part, which looks ridiculous. If I part it on the side, it's good. Maybe once it's longer the weight of the hair will pull down those waves and appear straight."

It seems like having long hair as a guy is just something that is extremely polarizing for girls.

FierceFlow,3bbel3,StrawDawg,8,Sat Jun 27 19:17:21 2015 UTC,"Well when he would visit me at the university I attend my friends that were girls all had very strong opinions about his hair. They either hated it or loved it, there was no in-between. I noticed this and asked him about it and he said that those kind of extreme reactions were extremely common for him.  He really enjoyed this aspect of having long hair. He was traveling around quite a bit during the time he had it long and he said he often had quite a few girls just randomly approach him to talk about his hair in Europe and Asia."

Surprisingly the longer it got i would have men complimenting me on it, i figured it was because women dont respect the effort since most have long hair whereas most dudes have either tried and gave up or can barely manage short hair."
FierceFlow,3bbel3,13abie,7,Sat Jun 27 20:07:24 2015 UTC,"I noticed that with long hair artsy girls like me more and more conservative girls around the office like me less.   Also asian immigrants/expacts like more with long hair and rich white locals like me less.   I think I'm overall better looking with long hair so the slightly  negative reaction from some I get is outweighed by the very positive reaction I get from others.  however this is all in the context that I've washed and styled it. Id I get a negative reaction from everyone if I just walked around with bed hair. Luckily a man bun is a lazy man's long hair style, but I dont think it looks as good as a fierce flow."
FierceFlow,3bbel3,AbdulJahar,5,Sun Jun 28 00:06:42 2015 UTC,"Lol, the awkward stage has been like the ""hard mode"" of life for this reason.

I'll try to make a post on my experience with this when I get to a full year (it should start looking better by then)."
FierceFlow,3bbel3,Amitai45,3,Sat Jun 27 19:31:58 2015 UTC,Some girls compliment my hair and say it's nice. Some make fun of me for how poofy it is (my hair is super thick).

Personally I've had mixed opinions, the awkward phase wasn't too bad since I was known to sport a cap most of the time. I've gone on a date where the girl said I really pulled off the long-hair splendidly. Other places would take me for a surfer, someone at work told me my hair started to look pretty awesome 7 months in(which implies he probably taught it was awkward a few months prior :P). They are all just labels, we tend to say things we don't mean or put no weight behind so I just try not to get all of it to my head and simply do it because I want to."

FierceFlow,3b92um,Thewolf28,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:39:13 2015 UTC,"I think you might want to get a wax then. Most pomades gives your hair a sleek/wet look. Molding paste from my understanding is for shorter hair that doesn't require as much hold. The longer your hair, the stronger it has to be. Wax is good, but honestly I hate the texture. It definitely doesn't allow for you (or your woman) to run fingers through your hair without leaving a sticky residue. If you use the wax, use it at night to put your hair where you want it then carefully put a beanie on to hold it in place while you sleep. That way you're training your hair to stay where you want it, and you won't need to use as much/any product during the day. Unless it's windy... RIP"
FierceFlow,3b87k4,Zaydo,2,Fri Jun 26 19:26:10 2015 UTC,"There are all sorts of hair products, some good for hair, some not so much.  It's a given shampooing too much is bad for your hair, since it strips it of its natural oils. Specially if you have dry hair. Thus, reducing shampoo usage and/or switching to a sulfate-free shampoo is usually the best thing.  Some other products, like some waxes, gel or conditioners, may have ingredients like silicones that cause buildup on your hair, and require you to shampoo regularly if you use them regularly too (thus leading, again, to dry hair).  What products you should use depend a lot on what your hair is like, but there are great products that make your hair healthier. Btw, good or bad products have no effect on you going bald more quickly. It's entirely genetic, and if it has to happen, it will happen regardless of how healthy your hair is."

My sister's hair sounds similar to yours (I have had to pick many a dreadlock out of it for her). Her regimen now includes brushing in the shower, no shampoo, tons of conditioner. She gets out, sprays a leave in conditioner lightly and detangles with a wide tooth comb (starting at the end and working up). Then, a light mousse with a curl locking spray.   In order to have two-day or next day hair successfully with out matting, knotting, etc. I would recommend sleeping with your hair in a very loose bun on the top of your head. You'll feel ridiculous the first few times, I certainly did- but now I can avoid washing my hair for 2-3 days which really helps. Over washing curly hair can dry it out and break it, leading to more frizz and loss of curls.   Check out the side bar on curlyhair to find out what kind of curls you have and grab some flair, submit a post. They can help you far more than I can. Good luck!"

I don't have a ton to tell i just started trying diff things a few months ago when i was going to cut it cause it got too poofy when i figured out a few things i could do differently.  I used to just comb it while wet and let it be and it ended up looking awful so i changed it up.  I wash it twice-ish a week, sometimes more if i torture it while im asleep, i use some shampoo and i mix this fructis oil into my hand with the shampoo, it doesnt look any diff from doing that but my hairs curly and helps me get my fingers throught it better.  Large amount of conditioner, i try to rinse it cool because people say it makes a difference, i just started that so not sure.    Products: Just tresemme shampoo/conditioner, might be bad choices but i dont have a lot of money to experiment with that right now, and ive got some cheap frizz ease cream i massage into it after a shower, then i comb it, part sections with my finger and grab chunks and curl them up to my scalp to re add the curls i lost while combing it down.  Then i just let it air dry.  Takes like 1 minute after a shower."
FierceFlow,3arf93,harowkun,2,Mon Jun 22 22:34:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Well I actually also shampoo 2x a week and use tresemmé conditioner (the undone waves).

I've never seen that kind of cut on a guy, but if yours is I can say that You totally rock it!   I think that in 7 months or so it can be considered a flow.

This is off topic but You have awesome ""pianist"" hands! Hope You take care of those as well, they're your main tools.

I don't really consider myself in an awkward phase, i can consistently make it look nice, so ima keep growing it.  What are pianist hands?

FierceFlow,3armnt,mia95,4,Mon Jun 22 23:15:49 2015 UTC,"You're fine. You don't see the hair fall out when it's shorter because it doesn't get caught in the drain / your fingers. The longer your hair gets, the easier it is to see the strands you lose. You're probably losing the same amount of hair but just noticing it now that the hairs themselves are longer.   I was worried about this for a bit. But I read up on the numbers - there's an average of 100,000 strands of hair on a human head, and 100 fall out per day. If you keep your hair up, this hair might not fall out until you let it down to wash it (i.e. even if it comes out, it stays in your bun). So for me (washing every three days, the rest of the time with my hair mostly up) I could see close to 300 strands come out in the shower, which would be a TON, but still normal.  EDIT: I see a lot of misinformation in other replies. You do NOT start losing more hair when your hair is longer / hasn't been cut for a long time. However, your hair does get thinner as it grows out. A detailed explanation:  A single follicle will produce hair for only a fixed amount of time, say 5 years. Then the hair will fall out, the follicle will rest for a while, and then another hair will start growing. If all the follicles on your head went through this process at the same time, your hair would grow out for five years, then you would be bald for a while, and then it would grow out again. However, your follicles do not do this at the same time, so you are not periodically bald.   Say when you started growing your hair out, one of your strands of hair had already been growing for 4 years. You kept your hair cut short, so it is short in length, but the follicle has been producing hair for 4 years. Then that hair will only grow for 1 year longer before it stops and falls out, and another hair grows in its place. Because almost none of the hairs on your head started growing exactly when you decided to grow your hair out, most of them will stop growing and fall out, and then be replaced by a new hair as you grow your hair out longer. Once you stop at a certain length and start getting haircuts again, all the strands of hair will eventually ""catch up"" giving you more even hair, without the thinner ends. [Unless you are at your ""terminal length"", in which case only a percentage of your hair will ever reach that length at any given time, but I think I've gone on for long enough already :)]"

There are four balding patterns: The recession ones and the diffuse one. While the diffuse one is much more common in women, it can happen to men as well. As far as I know, no matter the pattern most of the time is linked to genetics.  Third. There's something called Telogen effluvium that causes  temporary hair loss and it usually develop after physical/psychological trauma (it can be days, weeks or months after the event).  Fourth, Yes. If You're that concerned You should talk to a dermatologist (or better yet a trichologist) about it. Look for someone that really examines You and listens and (like with any doctor) don't be afraid to ask questions.  Hope I could help. Good luck!"

I use tresemmé naturals conditioner since it doesn't have any silicones in it, and it's pretty cheap. They have two different types and I've used both, but decided to stop using the volumizing one since my hair was big enough.  Other than that I don't really use much else, sometimes I'll use a tiny bit of gel when I pull my hair back into a bun.   One of the biggest tips I could give would be to let your hair air dry.   Also, since you have curly hair I'd recommend visiting /r/curlyhair it's mostly women, but hair is hair, and they've compiled a lot of information there.  Edit: and I haven't had any trims yet since I don't seem to have any split ends."

FierceFlow,3afhuf,zn95,2,Sat Jun 20 01:42:00 2015 UTC,"What do you use in place of shampoo?  I've gone no 'poo as well and it's been a month, my hair still gets oily/stringy sometimes (especially when I use hair wax, might stop using wax)  I also apply hot oil creams once a week, perhaps that's why my hair gets too oily even after a month?"
FierceFlow,3afhuf,stuffinz,2,Sat Jun 20 18:32:32 2015 UTC,"Nothing, conditioner gets rid of all of the oil build up and cleans my hair up just as well as any shampoo I've ever used."
FierceFlow,3afhuf,zn95,2,Sun Jun 21 06:50:50 2015 UTC,"What kind of conditioner are you using?  I'm currently using tresemme keratin smooth moisturizing conditioner, or something along the lines of that, can't remember the exact name :P"
FierceFlow,3afhuf,stuffinz,1 point,Sun Jun 21 07:03:21 2015 UTC,"Right now I'm using ""Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner"" which is pretty nice but I'm probably going to go back to the Tresemme I mentioned earlier as I'm not too crazy about the results."

Your hair is amazing, and flannel shirts are comfortable and rugged looking, so I personally wouldn't change a thing.

The hair looks great length-wise though dry/dull, but being fair I think it's the lighthing. One gets so used to direct-light-shiny-hair with commercials and stuff that anything else looks weird by comparison.  If You like your hair and it makes You happy, do not care about pressure from others. They're not here to decorate your world, and You're not here to decorate theirs either. Personally I would get a few layers on front -no more than 4 inches taken off- to give it a bit more of interest and movement (also I would encourage the waves), but I have a considerable aesthetic bias towards layered hair so our opinions may differ. In the end You're the one that cares for it and wears it so if You're fine with your current look ignore the noise :)  As for fashion, I think henley sweaters look great. Some come with string instead of buttons, If You want to rock a more medieval/fantasy look.  Also You may try cowl scarves, they look nice. Regarding colors I don't know because You have to consider your hair+skin+eyes+personality combo, but I think that royal blue, a dark aquamarine/greenish blue such as the one in this shirt or a soft orange look really good on pale people.  Hope I could help buddy. Thanks for sharing your mane with the sub. BTW Do You have pictures of the high pony?

That is pretty much dead straight naturally. I let my hair air dry and use quite bit of coconut oil (I like it greasy-ish looking). I've tried a couple of Sea Salt sprays (the John Fredia one...smells amazing, and the Lee Stafford one, I'm in the UK) but I find they leave the hair so untouchable, are there any I should be trying that give the same effect but leave a softer feel? Thanks"
FierceFlow,3acbay,BlerptheDamnCookie,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:08:56 2015 UTC,"That looks really nice! :) Congratz on that mane so far.  I'm not sure if you meant You want waves on the ponytail when You do a half up oooorrr if You meant You want wavy hair all over, all the time.   If it's the half up, You can spray it with a bit of water and carefully twist it around to get it into a bun, like this  then leave it like that for an hour and a half at least. Another method is to braid that zone like this but instead of one you do 2 braids. It works better for shorter hair and it will give you ""tighter"" waves. If it's the whole hair You may try something like this which will give you more like loose curls than S waves.   Hope I could help."

Read this  Second, I don't think that it is that puberty that causes hair to grow faster, just that in ""older people"" (I assume You mean like 40+) the whole body slows down, including hair cells.  If You meant like a few years older (17-21) then It may be different factors. Maybe their head size is bigger/longer, maybe they got a trim inbetween, maybe their hair grows slower than yours (genetics do play a bit into that), maybe you're at a phase where subtle growth is very noticeable (Ex. Going from chin to shoulder is noticeable, going from shoulder to armpit or armpit to chest is not and can be desperating), maybe it's maybelline....  IDK LOL there are many factors to consider in order to get a completely acccurate answer."

FierceFlow,39y4t1,harowkun,3,Fri Jun 19 04:35:25 2015 UTC,"Curly/wavy hair has tough awkward stages because they tend to grow in every direction. This will make your hair look like it's swelling instead of getting longer, but it will reach a point when it cannot sustain its own height and all that bulk will start coming down. This timelapse video shows that event really well.  It's also the reason why it seems to grow slower, because as it grows in several directions, it won't add much in terms of apparent length. That and because, well, it's curly. Instead of growing in a straight line, it will twist around. In straight hairs, however, every inch will add to the apparent hair length, so they have an easier time.  EDIT: Here's a video explaining this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7h11u7ZC2Q"

FierceFlow,39x8d8,harowkun,3,Mon Jun 15 17:06:41 2015 UTC,"I also have a receding hairline, although not so advanced, so I can relate. My older brother suffers a lot more from baldness and if it weren't for the pills, he'd be bald right now. He's been taking them for around 7 years already and says he never had any kind of side effect.  My advice is for you to go see a dermatologist specialized in hairloss if you're really considering this option. If you keep lurking the internet searching for side effects, you're gonna get both sides of the story in the same measure. Keep in mind the unhappy minority is much more vocal than the satisfied majority.  I recently went to the dermatologist about it and asked him all sort of questions about Finasteride and the sides. He bluntly told me that there were virtually no sexual side effects. What happens is a ""nocebo"" effect, which he explained me in this way: if you pick 2 samples of a 1000 individuals each from the general population, give one the Finasteride pill and a placebo to the other, then take note of any side effects, the occurrence of sexual problems in both samples won't be significantly different. But if instead when giving the Finasteride pill you tell every individual that there can be a chance of having sexual problems, then the occurrence of sexual problems on that sample will increase. In the end, it's mostly psychological and everyone will be quick to put the blame on the pill.  And finally I asked him if any of his patients had any problems with the pill. He said he already prescribed the pill to thousands and thousands of men, and only once one guy said it was giving him issues, which stopped when he interrupted the treatment. I haven't yet started taking it because he said there's no need yet, but I'm thinking of starting the treatment in a few months.  Hope I could be of help to you."

Just keep in mind that each day is one day closer to your goal. A cut is definitely weeks and months away from it, and you can't go back on it. You need to think if you really want the flow that badly.  My hair is around the same length as yours right now. I part it on the right side and then use a little wax to hold the hair in place. Hair doesn't fall in my face so often and doesn't feel sticky or crunchy at all. And during sports, why not wear a headband?  Fun thing: noticed during today's match that Falcao cut his hair.

Here's a picture for what I'm going for and was one of the pictures that helped me decide to grow out my hair: http://imgur.com/AOjFjP7 I assume within a month or two I can get to where it's at in the front, and maybe in that time where it's at in the back. I think to get the front quite a ways past my chin like in the Keanu Reeves picture I posted in my original post, it would probably take around 6 months or longer."
FierceFlow,39u2z2,DutchDuder,4,Sun Jun 14 19:55:40 2015 UTC,"I only ever use coconut oil as a treatment before a shower, but I have fine thin hair, so your mileage may vary.  Process:   Apply coconut oil to hair, tie up and secure hair, protect surroundings with old towels and shirts (maybe even tie a tshirt over your head with a scarf or grocery bag), when you need to shower run a conditioner through your DRY hair to start to emulsify the coconut oil, rinse and reapply conditioner, rinse and dry in a shirt or towel.   Overview:    Coconut oil in dry hair. Wait time and protect furniture. Emulsify dry-oily hair with conditioner.   I feel like the amount of shampoo I would have to use to get coconut oil out of my hair kinda negates the idea of treating my hair with coconut oil, so I learned how to conditioner-wash out oils."

About once a week or two I cover my hair in coconut oil, stick on a plastic cap, and stick on a heat cap on top of that. I leave that on my head for ~30 minutes, then wash my hair as usual.  2) I saturate my hair with it.  3) Nope.  4) It shampoos out fine, but I may have to try shampooing twice.  5) Since I only use coconut oil before showering, no.  I did used to try putting coconut oil on just the ends of my hair after showering, but I never figured out the right amount to use without making my hair look greasy. I had far better luck with jojoba oil or sweet almond oil."
FierceFlow,39ppz9,rektunicorn,2,Sat Jun 13 23:41:28 2015 UTC,"1) The moisture will be better if your hair is still damp. So after shower.  2) It depends. My scalp produces a good amount of oil, so a few drops can solve my problem easily.  3) Yeah, if it's too much. Any oil in excess will do that.   4) The hair will air dry but keep the soft manuseable look, but if you want to remove all the oil i think shampoo is better.  5) Never experienced this, but i use drops of it, after the air drying is all good. I believe that it will depend of your scalp and its ability to produce oil for itself.  It's good to remember that while you still have hair is always good to be as empirical as you can. So test it!   Keep flowing!"

Will definitely try the side dry too. Do you let it entirely air dry or do you squeeze a bit of the excess out? I have very thick hair and sometimes it feels like it'd be wet for easily like 3-4 hours if I don't squeeze some out or do a light towel dry."
FierceFlow,39m039,itskyalnotkyle,3,Fri Jun 12 21:04:49 2015 UTC,"I recently started squeezing it a little, butI see no strong difference. But after an hour or so of air-drying I do the forward-backward headbang like so, which allows it to dry faster afterwards."

FierceFlow,39m039,harowkun,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:22:11 2015 UTC,"If You mean they curl inwards -like ()-, it could be the way your hair is cut.  Depending on how You cut hair, You can make it more prone to flip out or curl in, or go frontwards / backwards. I don't think it works much if the hair is noticeably wavy or curly but since You said it's only slightly wavy I assume You shouldn't have a problem. Hairstyling is an art.  Cowlicks can also play into that, depending on how severe they are. I have a zone on my hairline that is just an insuferable bitch."
FierceFlow,39m039,Otherrrr,3,Sun Jun 14 09:22:11 2015 UTC,"I am incredibly drunk reading this comment, but I will attempt to make note of it for my barber as I can imagine the way it's cut would have some ind of affect on the eventual curl."
FierceFlow,39m5ys,Arkon709,2,Fri Jun 12 18:34:29 2015 UTC,"From what I can tell, my hair is exactly like John Snow's hair, which is fine textured and curly. So I already have the curls, but they easily become flattened or straightened out when I sleep or pull my hair up. The best thing for me has been using hair spray after a shower, when my hair has dried. It keeps my hair looking good and curly for the next few days until I shower again.   Edit: reread and you say you have curly hair. It will depend a lot on the texture of your curls. My hair is very soft/fine so I just need something to hold it in place, thus the hairspray"
FierceFlow,39m5ys,BuriedInMyBeard,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:30:36 2015 UTC,"Mines more wavy than curly, but like you said, I do have the problem with sleeping, hairs goes flat. Never tried hair spray before though only gel/mouse/ balm/cream which yielded crap results. Thanks for the tip!"
FierceFlow,39m5ys,BuriedInMyBeard,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:37:51 2015 UTC,"For sure! Yeah I've tried gel before (put it in while my hair was still soaking wet, just before drying it) and it worked okay, but spray is really the only product that holds my curls the way I like.   Another thing I used successfully was shampoo bars. When using them that was literally all I needed. No other products or conditioner, curls stayed in, and got lots of compliments on my hair. However they can cause scalp buildup, which I didn't like (it's not a problem - you can just use a clarifying shampoo once in a while, but I just didn't like that regimen). So that's another thing to try."
FierceFlow,39m5ys,SamsaraGuy,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:25:02 2015 UTC,"I have a Jon Snow Hair texture too. But usually my hair is great after sleep (usually it looks so good after night that i dont even wash it by morning, but after my classes in afternoon). If your hair is curly you shouldnt shampoo it too much,but keep using the conditioner - but never with hot water. You can try some Leave-in too, i use coconut oil for example. Also dont use any Silicone or Sulfat based conditioner. A silk pillowcase and a cottom towel for drying the excess of water after the shower is great too."
FierceFlow,39m5ys,AbdulJahar,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:07:56 2015 UTC,"Well first of all, you need to know whether your hair is more wavy or curly. At about 4-5 inches of length or more, there should be no doubt if your hair is indeed curly. You can always style your hair the exact same way (just a basic side part) if it's more wavy than curly, but it will just have a different look to it than his.  He uses something to hydrate his hair and keep it from drying out. There are a million options for that and what works for him may not be best for you. You can try leave-in conditioners, curl creams (essentially the same thing as far as I can tell), or oils like coconut or jojoba. Also some kind of hold is beneficial (imo) so that the curls don't break apart and create ugly frizz. You can do this with hair spray, mouse, clay, or even some gel.   I hope this helps a little and like someone else said, conditioner is your friend. Just remember that a hydrating product is arguably the most important thing for curly hair, unless you're going for this look."

I don't know, I love my long hair and I feel it suits me but I sure as hell don't recommend growing it out because 1. It looks like crud for 1.5 years and 2. There's very few people that can pull it off. another thing is, 99% of girls are not going to be attracted to men's long hair worn down.

Currently doing the LOC method after every wash with shampoo; which is just twice a week (every 4th day).   I don't condition any day besides the day I shampoo.. but I don't see a big problem with doing that more often.. What's worked great for thick and curly hair is using a ""leave in"" conditioner instead of a conventional one. The oil I've been massaging with is Coconut oil.

Then I found some old pics of when I was 14 and saw that I always had that widows peak, receded on the side type of hairline like Johnny Depp has. It's a genetic trait, my father had it too and kept all his hair through out his old age. Don't forget we get a mature hair line, which means that it just recedes a little up on the forhead. Every human being has this happen, even women. Now if i starts thinning and makes a horse shoe shape of thin hair around your head, then its time to worry."

At best, it's neutral. Hate to say it, and we all wish it wasn't true, but it is. You don't often see entry level investment bankers with ponytails.  That being said, you can compensate by just generally not looking like shit. Bumping up the professionalism of the rest of your look certainly helps: if you have long hair but dress and groom well, you'll likely be okay. Doesn't hurt to buy a new dress shirt (make sure it fits well) and tie.  As for style, I'd try a few things and see what works best with what you plan to wear. In general, buns are a better choice. Ponytails are a hard sell these days unless you're applying to be an cameraman at your local news studio."

FierceFlow,393vz5,Apache666,2,Thu Jun 11 03:55:59 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, someone who's never had a job before should dress sharp, have a fresh haircut and an assertive attitude - look like you've prepared for this interview and look/talk like you're taking it seriously.  That alone will 100% set you apart from others in the same position.  It's not impossible with long hair, but you should have experience or qualifications that make you worth considering.  If you have no experience for the job you're applying, you have no business taking chances, honestly.    This is our culture.  Yeah, you may find that rare interviewer who thinks it's cool and doesn't feel that long/short hair is important.  But that is not typical, in my experience.  However, this also depends on the job you are applying for.  If you're applying for a job at a fashionable clothing store, and the long hair brings out your features, it will probably be a plus.  There's no straight answer.  Assess the job you're applying for, scope out the environment, and make a good decision."

FierceFlow,3936mw,18Ten,2,Tue Jun 9 17:27:00 2015 UTC,"/u/KBG19 Alright it's actually really easy after you've done it a couple times. The amount that you use will depend mainly on how long your hair is, but it's always better to use a smaller amount than needed than too much.   I'd start with about a marble-sized amount and increase just a little bit each morning (or however often you apply) until you get the best results for your hair. From what I've experienced and heard, you'll progressively need more as you get deeper into the awkward stage, but then progressively less as your hair begins to weigh itself down.   Apply after you get out of the shower and dry your hair to that ""damp"" stage. You'll basically just rub it in your hands for about 10 seconds and it will ""melt"" into a liquid form, then you hang your hair and run your coated fingers through your hair from about an inch from the root to the ends.   The reason that you don't want to coat the roots is because they already benefit from natural oil produced by your head that can make your hair look greasy by the end of the day if you get too much coconut oil at the base too. It's not bad to get some on the roots, but definitely focus more on the ends.  I like to take the coconut oil that I will be using and make two halves out of it. I'll rub the first half and apply it to the sides and back of my hair, then I'll rub the second half and apply it to the top and front of my hair. This just helps make sure it's equally distributed, but isn't necessary.   Like I said, you're going to have to experiment a little for the first week, but it gets super easy to do after you get used to it."

FierceFlow,393kgl,KingDigsby,2,Tue Jun 9 01:06:41 2015 UTC,"Man, just tell em you want a trim and nothing else. There is a really good way to tell stylists who are trying to convince you to do things you do want to do to your hair (layering or thinning it). Here, I'll give an example:  ""Hello, I would like a small trim of about a half an inch all around my hair.""  ""Okay sir, we could also thin it out so that it falls a certain way better.""  ""No thank you, I just want the trim."""
FierceFlow,393kgl,AyybelaCishurr,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:43:00 2015 UTC,"So... just to be clear - no good can come of thinning shears or layering, right?  I definitely just want a tiny trim to clean up the ends, right?    I still have a solid 6 months of growing before my goal."
FierceFlow,393kgl,AyybelaCishurr,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:14:42 2015 UTC,"There's good that can come from them, if that's what you're looking for. Personally, I'd suggest looking into the different styles available with those option if you're interested.   Otherwise, just the trim."
FierceFlow,393kgl,nverunt,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:28:09 2015 UTC,"I've met both extremes:   ""please trim my hair and remove dead ends""   type a ""then i'll cut it back to shoulder length because of yolo and your hair is too long for a male"" at this time i said thank you and left.  type b ""sure we can do it. at first i'll trim this shows difference with fingers"" ""ok if you keep it"" trims ""is it ok?"" shows mirror ""wtf did he trimmed anything?!"" (but the dead ends were gone)  but it felt that some relativistic effects happen at the stylists. one centimeter is not the same as in the outside world.   tl;dr: you are the consumer, they want you money. so be polite but tell what you want."
FierceFlow,392awo,greatmeaning,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:06:37 2015 UTC,"those frizzys are from hairs that are too short to be pulled back, from purpose sloppiness, or in my case hair that gets ripped out during contact sports.  those are a few options."
FierceFlow,392awo,Allpurposesandals,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:26:13 2015 UTC,how can i purposely have my hair do that? i was told that back combing it can force this sorta look but that's super unhealthy right? is there a way of being able to backcomb hair while keeping it healthy?

FierceFlow,392hdi,V8vsV12,2,Mon Jun 8 19:49:56 2015 UTC,"Hemsworth uses a bit of pomade or something in his hair to keep it how it is. I have seen a picture of him on an off day and his hair was frizzy and messed up as fuck, just like any other normal dude."
FierceFlow,392hdi,darren559,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:32:19 2015 UTC,Pomade definitely helps me tame it.  I also made a sort of diy leave-in conditioner spray thing that is a sprayer bottle of mostly water with a healthy pile of my conditioner and a bit of oil all mixed together.  Spraying that on in moderation and working it through usually helps a lot to tame and de-poof and defrizz as needed.
FierceFlow,392hdi,StrawDawg,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:58:39 2015 UTC,"If you are already looking in the $15 dollar range, I would recommend Shear Revival's Crystal Lake. I have around hair that reaches my collar now and this pomade is really light. It does not dry up and is also really cost efficient at 4 oz a tin. Check out some of the reviews on youtube man, after washing it out my hair feels healthy. It's almost like a leave-in conditioner and it doesn't need shampoo to rinse out. Good luck!"

FierceFlow,38wces,intellectualarsenal,2,Sun Jun 7 14:08:28 2015 UTC,"assuming you don't want to cut it you listed all the styles available in the original post, and if you take an inch off all you have done is make it take longer to grow to a workable length"
FierceFlow,38wces,geomu,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:27:09 2015 UTC,if you take an inch off all you have done is make it take longer to grow to a workable length   Couldn't agree more. I went in to get a hair trim during an awkward phase and the stylist basically told me not to cut it. You just have to let it grow.
FierceFlow,38wces,BuriedInMyBeard,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:31:24 2015 UTC,"I'm at the exact same length with the exact same problems. Tryina be patient and let it keep growing. I might trim the back a little so it's more even with the front, it's starting to look a little mullet-y. But like the other commenter said, then it'll take longer to get past this stage! Grah."
