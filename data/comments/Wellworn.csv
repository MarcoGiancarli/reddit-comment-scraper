Probably not on the nurse shoes (but hey, I'm just a dude on the internet) because most of the soles are Vibram and designed for crawling up rock and gravel, not tile.

Wellworn,3bu8zh,EngineerBill,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:00:52 2015 UTC,Any idea what the cat whiskers are for?
Wellworn,3bu8zh,improbablydrunknlw,3,Sat Jul 4 06:26:26 2015 UTC,"Actually, yeah. Before there were commercial diodes, you needed a way to convert the alternating current of a radio signal (which was likely a relatively low frequency Alternating Current (AM) radio signal) into a Direct Current signal which could be filtered and fed to an audio amplifier and speaker or headphones. So what you did was put a piece of Gallium Arsenide and a ""cat's whisker"" (thin piece of wire) into the signal path. You might have to delicately adjust and jiggle the wire, but once you got it right the AM signal was converted in a DC signal which could be amplified and/or used to drive the audio stage(s).  Once commercial diode valves (in the U.S. ""tubes"") were available the crystal and cat's whisker went the way of the buggy whip, but this device is the thing that enabled commercial radio service to find its audience. In fact, you could think of this as the component that enabled the Smart Phone of its generation.  Pretty damned cool, if you ask me...  (ex- VK3DMV QRT...)"

Wellworn,35ygrj,mosspassion,6,Thu May 14 19:50:01 2015 UTC,"i do this too, but mostly for grip, the visibility helps too though. it lets me put a finger or two past the handle and actually grip the blade for better control without, you know, losing fingers."

However, I left all the gouges and nicks in the stock since I liked the ""been there, done that"" look.  The metal is untouched (magazine is current-production aftermarket).  As you can tell from the condition of the metal, this rifle actually has been there and done that.  It was manufactured by I.B.M. (yes, that I.B.M.) during the middle of the United States' involvement in World War II, and saw a rearsenaling before being sent overseas for use in the Korean War.  It was then kept by the South Koreans for reserve unit use, and eventually imported back here to the United States.  The guy who bought it used it for a bit, then sold it to the guy I bought it off of several years ago.  Previous owner used it as a truck gun/beater, and since it was my handiest firearm for a while, it was my go-to hiking gun for a couple years, as well.

Either way, this image lives on in my wallpapers folder. It has only minimal retouching. Some white balance adjustments and the background is actually a garage door, so I removed one of the seams in that to give it a clean white background. The logo is entirely untouched. It was actually in that great of condition, despite everything around it being beat to hell.  Edit: Found another picture.

Some other wear has come from it being an EDC practically since I first got it, so it has some wear from just being used, holster wear, and wear from just rubbing up against stuff.  Over 2k rounds and no malfunctions as of yet save for one dead primer causing a FTF.  The slide lock doesn't always want to engage, but I don't consider it to be that big of an issue.

It was fantastic in not poking holes in my pencil pocket with the retractable lead sleeve. The cap stayed on tightly, even though I was worried it would be considered FOD if it ever came off, which even then wasn't an issue because I just crossed things out if I wrote unintended things. BUT, the pencil is no longer with me.  One day, while using it, the plastic around the threading to the metal cone snapped off cleanly. As I couldn't fix that in any sensible way, I had to say goodbye to the pencil I cherished. It's sturdy outside but has the same plastic garbage as other lesser (and cheaper) pencils do inside.

It's really bulky though, so you'd better have some large man-pockets if you plan on carrying this beauty in your pants. It was like $30 at the time and I have no clue why I can't find many pictures of them being sold anywhere online. My only lead I can get atm has the thing at $18.99 and some sort of strange requesting system.  It's a little cheap but I can't tell if that's from the build or the many days of flying around in my purse, bag, or car cupholders.

Did you grind off some serrations?(I don't blame you, I'm not a fan of serrations either)  Did it start off as a tanto or does it just look that way now?  Sorry for all of the questions.

Wellworn,2s0k4q,bladechick3,3,Sun Jan 11 01:28:15 2015 UTC,Im confused by your question does it still have a good edge?
Wellworn,2s0k4q,KnoxButler,3,Sun Jan 11 01:58:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, as in is the edge still good on it. Is it sharp, is it able to still cut well, is the edge working well, etc."
Wellworn,2s0k4q,bladechick3,4,Sun Jan 11 02:09:10 2015 UTC,That really depends on how often/well the user can sharpen it doesn't it?   EDIT: Sorry don't mean to come across as condescending your question just peaked my interest a little bit.

Wellworn,2s0k4q,bladechick3,4,Sun Jan 11 02:22:31 2015 UTC,No worries! I've got a couple more knives that are wore pretty decently if you guys want to see more
Wellworn,2s0k4q,KnoxButler,2,Sun Jan 11 02:33:24 2015 UTC,I suppose but it also depends on whether a knife with that bad of a damaged blade can still take an okay edge.
Wellworn,2s0k4q,bladechick3,1 point,Mon Jan 12 02:41:24 2015 UTC,?
Wellworn,2s0k4q,KnoxButler,2,Mon Jan 12 02:59:03 2015 UTC,The blade could have a blunt edge or be so damaged to the point that it just doesn't take a good or decent edge anymore.
Wellworn,2s0k4q,bladechick3,1 point,Mon Jan 12 03:33:51 2015 UTC,"whether a knife with that bad of a damaged blade can still take an okay edge   Im sorry Im still not sure what you mean.   The blade is made out of, on this particular model, 8cr14mov I believe and this steel is used consistently throughout the entirety of the blade. So as long as the process of grinding/reprofiling as well as the process of sharpening and honing is done properly the blade will always be able to take a good edge no matter how damaged. (That is as long as the steel was able to take a good edge in the first place)  Given my understanding, your question confused me a little. So I figured I would inquire and either learn something I didn't know or may be help someone out. I hope I haven't come across as condescending or antagonistic."
Wellworn,2s0k4q,KnoxButler,1 point,Mon Jan 12 04:04:14 2015 UTC,"Sometimes when damaged badly, a edge won't be able to take an angled edge and just won't sharpen properly anymore(I've reprofiled many blades). If its reprofiled well it should take an edge, but a lot of damaged knives just won't take a good edge anymore. My Old Timer 77OT was reprofiled well but its still pretty hard to put a good edge on it."
Wellworn,2s0k4q,bladechick3,1 point,Mon Jan 12 05:15:54 2015 UTC,"Oh okay, so your talking about ending up with something that resembles more of a axe blade with more of a convex grind or at least more of an obtuse angle due to the greater thickness of the steel."

Funny story actually, I met the brother of the original owner (I'm the 3rd owner), who worked with me briefly. He had a lot of stories to tell about some of the dents, dings, and scrapes throughout. The truck changed states a couple times from my understanding.   I thought about repainting it a different color, but the way that it faded into a matte ""light red""/pinkish hue almost entirely over the body has really grown on me.  At most I'd repaint it the same factory cherry red it had.   I think for now and the foreseeable future I'm just going to try and keep it rust free and pour any money that goes into it into making sure it runs forever."

As for that curve in the tip, I was working on a long-winded project that involved cutting small rope at weird angles, so I decided to sharpen the flat tip. Actually worked really well."
