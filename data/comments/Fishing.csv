Scared me shitless, then I had a Lamprey swing into me,  disconnect from the salmon and wrap against me. It's head pushed up to look at me. It was an odd blue color. I had never seen a Lamprey before and immediately thought it was a deadly eel that was going to eat me. I probably didn't, but I felt like I did a vertical leap straight out of the water. The next thing I know I'm on the grass with a Lamprey between my righted hands. You're damned right I didn't let it go, I thought it was my death imminent. I held on to that thing all the way to the shore and then threw it down out of sheer panic. I went to the library after that day and looked them up with some help. I learned a great deal about them,  and how they feed off of fish. I wasn't hurt in any way, but in the end, lampreys really do suck."

My suggestion for cleaning it would be to get 2 pairs of catfish skinnin pliars (they're about 2 bucks each) Nail his head to a tree. Cut all the way around him just under the head. Use those pliars to peel the skin all the way down and off at the tail.

Was fishing for walleye because I can't get enough and just caught the trout by chance. Was using 2/0 hook and a couple size 3 split shot on 10 lbs braided line. Just casting off into the current of this spillway when I felt the first nibble and the fight was on! I've never fought something so ferocious.   It was exciting both times for sure, those fish put up a hell of a fight. I couldn't be happier. Of course the walleye just kind of let me drag it into shore, as walleye do lol.   All was delicious and I gave the rest of my bait to some kids who weren't having any luck on soft plastics next to me. As I was walking away I saw them catch something, good karma for me!  *EDIT: This is my first year fishing BTW, I'm learning as I go."

The river went from 35 cubic meters per second to 90 cubic meters per second and almost unfishable. Despite that we managed to do some sight fishing the first day and in total we caught 4 salmon and lost one in three days. We had a monster salmon come after the fly but not take it and one of the fisherman caught his biggest fish ever!  The fishing was really tough, just being outside was really tough! The weather and condition were terrible, one morning we only stayed out for about an hour and we were always back at the lodge really early for lunch and dinner. While parts of the USA are having trouble with droughts we are having the opposite problem, just too much and too cold water! Most of the pools were unfishable and it was really hard finding any fish.  That being said, this river is more about quality over quantity. Big salmon in spectacular landscape far away from everything. If you want many fish, you go to the west coast of the island, but that will probably cost a lot more and the fish are smaller."

Fishing,3e3ysy,Juicetime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:47:42 2015 UTC,"SM relate to rocky bottoms and points. I fish from a bass boat so I can only give you tips for boat fishing. But setup on points or steep banks that are rocky, or rip rap.   Topwaters such as the Hula Popper and Rebel Pop R in bone color are small mouth slayers. But the one bait that constantly produce SM is Stick Baits. Zeros, Senkos, etc. Purple Haze and Pink Zeros have put more bass in my boat than any other color and bait. Then the Senko in Mad Melon and Watermelon Candy also catch a fair amount for me.   But the tldr version, SM, rocky points/bottoms. Top waters and stick baits"

Just casting off into the current of this spillway when I felt the first nibble and the fight was on! I've never fought something so ferocious.   It was exciting both times for sure, those fish put up a hell of a fight. I couldn't be happier. Of course the walleye just kind of let me drag it into shore, as walleye do lol.   All was delicious and I gave the rest of my bait to some kids who weren't having any luck on soft plastics next to me.

The river went from 35 cubic meters per second to 90 cubic meters per second and almost unfishable. Despite that we managed to do some sight fishing the first day and in total we caught 4 salmon and lost one in three days. We had a monster salmon come after the fly but not take it and one of the fisherman caught his biggest fish ever!  The fishing was really tough, just being outside was really tough! The weather and condition were terrible, one morning we only stayed out for about an hour and we were always back at the lodge really early for lunch and dinner. While parts of the USA are having trouble with droughts we are having the opposite problem, just too much and too cold water! Most of the pools were unfishable and it was really hard finding any fish.  That being said, this river is more about quality over quantity. Big salmon in spectacular landscape far away from everything. If you want many fish, you go to the west coast of the island, but that will probably cost a lot more and the fish are smaller."

Also fishing points and reefs using a weighted salamander, cast the salamander and let it sink all the way to the bottom and let it rest on the bottom for 5 seconds or so.

It has caught so may fish and been abused very very badly from trecking through the woods to tiny ponds, I have got it caught on trees as the boat went by and it was sticking out. Has been an awesome rod and I can feel a bluegill fart on a senko with it.  As for even cheaper than that, Berkley Cherrywood. $20 at Wal-Mart and are decent rods. I have an issue with the tips breaking off occasionally but at that price point I just go pick up another one."
Fishing,3e0z1f,duckys1,2,Tue Jul 21 14:17:51 2015 UTC,"Probably should have contacted Croix directly and explained.  They might have taken care of it directly through them.  Remember, if you buy a rod on the store floor, someone might have been playing around with it or it got mis-handled at the store.    I have had croixs for over 30 years and never had them do me wrong on a replacement.  One was their bad and they handled it perfectly, and two were my bad and they still took care of me."

Fishing,3e194v,Buckslenderman,5,Tue Jul 21 04:31:22 2015 UTC,"Spinning is more versatile if you are only going to have 1 rod. Baitcasters have their place, but generally they are best used within a narrower range of applications. Spinning reels are more for the jack-of-all-trades approach."
Fishing,3e194v,vahntitrio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:55:39 2015 UTC,"Yea thats kind of what i figured. If i am primarily fishing for bass from shore or kayak, does the baitcaster offer me any advantages over the spinning? also thanks for the quick reply"
Fishing,3e194v,vahntitrio,3,Tue Jul 21 05:39:42 2015 UTC,"Baitcasters have a few advantages: generally higher drag pressures in a lighter weight. Useful for large fish, but not really all that necessary for bass because they really aren't drag burners. The other is cast control. If you need to pitch a lure into a gap in the weeds that is the size of a basketball hoop, then it is easier to do with a baitcaster than a spinning rod. Most people can make good enough casts with a spinning rod, so it isn't a huge advantage. But when you need to land something in really tight to cover, baitcaster really helps. They also tend to manage fluoro or mono better than a spinning reel. You don't end up with as much line twist. If you use braid it doesn't matter."
Fishing,3e194v,TheSuperFluke,3,Tue Jul 21 05:45:50 2015 UTC,"I prefer baitcasters to spinning reels. I only use spinning for finesse. But if you're going to have 1 rod, spinning is the way to go. Maybe in the future you could get a casting setup. But the cheap casting reels will definitely but a bad taste in your mouth. It also comes with experience, but a good baitcaster + being proficient with them will lead to fewer and fewer backlashes.  But I would get a quality spinning setup right now, then maybe in the future get a casting setup."
Fishing,3e194v,animatej24,3,Tue Jul 21 14:40:33 2015 UTC,Baitcasters to me are really good for lure fishing more sensitive for strikes because of the tension on the line and pole but are not great live bait poles in my opinion but saying you wanna be able to go after many species and when you get to florida and see our inshore fishing options I would go with a good versatile spinning combo
Fishing,3e194v,nathanvanburen,2,Tue Jul 21 11:57:09 2015 UTC,I like a bait caster for bass because you can pull big large mouth out of weeds.

Wouldn't recommend eating the ones in neighborhood ponds though since all of the crap people spray on their grass and weeds drain straight into them.

Fishing,3dyvy5,penisgonelesbian,3,Mon Jul 20 20:17:22 2015 UTC,Nope. Rod spines don't matter on modern construction in the same way they did previously.  If the rod bends under load from a snag/fish and you don't high stick the rod or point load it you will be fine.  I have repurposed two rods made for spinning by removing the guides and replacing them so they work with bait casting and conventional reels and they are going fine.  You may find that the guide placements are incorrectly placed to be used with a spinning reel and you may find that casting distance is sub optimum due to the stripper guide not being large enough  have fun!

I already have quite a collection of lures, but it's always nice to get some new ones. Plus, they have sent me hooks, line,  and soft baits. I'm not usually a soft bait person, but they have really turned me on to them. Also, this month I got an interesting lure that is made to resemble four fish schooling, haven't gotten a chance to use it, but it seems interesting.   I'm about to be moving to Florida and am going to re-subscribe, this time to salt water though, since I don't have any gear and it'll give me a good opportunity to try various baits.   Even if you have a bit of tackle and feel comfortable using it, it's always nice to try new stuff and build up your inventory."
Fishing,3e0093,JVallelyJ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:22:37 2015 UTC,"Been with them for little over a year.  If you don't want to try new products, do not get this.  As far as the ""bass box"" goes, you get a hard lure, some terminal tackle, and a few samples of some soft plastics.  A few times a year you get what I call super boxes.  Something special, like a real premium crank bait, or buff, or full retail package of almost everything.  The ""samples"" are plenty enough to try out the soft plastics, and the great thing is the terminal tackle if they are hooks, compliment the soft plastics. A few months ago they practically set you up with a starter Ned rig setup in the box.    Ultimately if you but everything retail you'd be paying well over $30.  The hard bait alone normally is almost the majority of the cost of the box, do you definitely get your money's worth.  The inshore, and panfish boxes are just as nice and follows the same model.  No I don't work for them, but there product got me back into fishing, so I really like spreading the word."

I happened to look down and saw a small fish swimming maybe 7 0r 8 inches from where I was standing. then out of nowhere this snake strikes the fish and wraps around it.  Was the coolest thing I had ever witnessed.    Also made me step away from the water's edge because I was only wearing flip-flops and didn't want my toes mistaken for food.

Fishing,3dz0cl,DrakesLintRoller,3,Mon Jul 20 18:03:03 2015 UTC,"Rod size will be dictated by what lures you plan on using. Most muskie guys have multiple set ups to accommodate lures from 1-16+ ounces. I would certainly bring the catfish rod for large lures as the revo S is simply too small for baits that pull hard like crankbaits and bucktails. I use 65 or 80 lb braid and 130lb fluorocarbon leaders. The heavy line isn't for fighting fish as much as preventing break offs on backlashes and abrasions from rocks/cover. You will be sorry if you don't use at least a steel leader, pike and muskie will bite through ANY braid with ease. 20 lb will work, but it's far from ideal. As for lures just cover the basics, muskie tackle is expensive and ultimately not worth buying a bunch of for just one trip. If I had to only bring 5 lures muskie fishing I would get a 7 inch shallow raider, a 9 inch suick, a double-8 bucktail, a single blade bucktail and a top raider. The double-8 bucktail and single blade bucktail will ruin your revo s, just too much resistance for a bass/walleye reel.   Feel free to PM with specific questions."

Fishing,3dz0cl,Tea_Murder,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:02:56 2015 UTC,"The Revo Toro Beast will be a much better muskie reel than the Ambassadeur Beast, IMO. The Toro-s will be great for the money also.   Jakes are great crankbaits also. As with any muskie lures, the figure 8 is a huge part of the retrieve. 3 of the 7 muskies I got this last trip were on the 8."

I had just spooled new line on my reel while sitting in my boat, and I forgot to loosen the drag. Set the hook on a huge fish, I'd say he was 10-12 pounds, easy. Rod snapped pretty much immediately.   Second one happened when I was putting the broke rod in the rod locker, and swapping it for a different one. I didn't notice that about 5 inches of rod were still in the path of the rod locker lid. Still pretty sore from my most recent break, I slammed the rod locker. Son of a bitch...   Put those two away, grabbed two more and put on the deck of the boat. Fished for a while caught a couple, and was starting to feel better. Then a little while later, I changed rods, and put the one I was using on the deck. All my rods, up to 8ft can fit on the deck of my boat no problem, as it's a 21 footer. But like a idiot I didn't secure it, and some of the rod was sticking out of the front of the boat. I acknowledged it, and was going to move it, but the bite was on so I ignored it for the time being. Bite slowed, and without thinking, I pulled the trolling motor up and was ready to move. But.. my rod was there, and the trolling motor chomped it."

My home lake is notorious for being an excellent ice fishing lake, and people take perch by the hundreds. I'll see pictures pop up on facebook of people catching 200 perch in a day. No matter the size, they will keep it. Be it 5 inches or 18 inches. I don't look down on eating what you catch, but isn't like.. 10-15 or so enough? That's enough ranting, nice bass, OP!

Fishing,3dwbxr,A_bit_fucky_1,5,Mon Jul 20 02:14:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is a Goby.  If you are on a lake or stream that doesn't already have reports of these, it would be very beneficial to local DNR if you contacted them about this.  I assume you are in the Midwest, possibly near the Great Lakes as they are a big problem in our area.    *edited for removal of duplicate word"
Fishing,3dwbxr,puedc,2,Mon Jul 20 02:25:19 2015 UTC,You seem pretty knowledgeable about these things. A few years ago my father and I were on vacation and had a lake house on Lake Ontario (oswego area) and we would catch a lot of these kinds of looking fish. I am pretty sure the guy who was in the house next to ours called them sculpins but they look very similar. Are they the same fish just different names for different areas or 2 different species?
Fishing,3dwbxr,tatertot255,2,Mon Jul 20 04:24:32 2015 UTC,"I'm an Icthyologist, so I had to take years of fish ID.  I work where Sculpin are native, and we haven't seen an invasion of the Goby, yet.  But we know they are coming, so we have been starting to really become very aware of the differences between the two.  The fact that you were on Lake Ontario, and that you were catching them with hook and line tells me that they were almost definitely Goby.  Goby are very territorial, and aggressive and can be caught on hooks that are WAY too big for them.  Sculpin are pretty difficult to catch hook and line (though not impossible).    As far as physical features, the black spot is usually a dead give away, but there are always exceptions, and I have seen Sculpin with black spots.  Other characteristics to look for would be the eyes of the Goby bulge out of their eye sockets so much they look like they might pop out at any moment.  Additionally, if you look down at the fish from the dorsal side (back) the Goby has a very wide head compared to a Sculpin.  The Goby are almost tear-drop shaped while the Sculpin is more 'football' shaped."

Fishing,3dwj8p,upparoom,3,Mon Jul 20 03:06:17 2015 UTC,"from what I was told he was stuck in 6 tides, low and high. spent 40 hours stuck and had to be pulled out by a shrimp boat after having a gulley carved  out for him by backhoes and an excavator"
Fishing,3dwj8p,swfl55,2,Mon Jul 20 03:56:13 2015 UTC,something about a boater having more horsepower than IQ
Fishing,3dwj8p,admile3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:38:33 2015 UTC,"If he's smart, he'll wait til high tide, so it wont cost him a thing."

Fishing,3dv3t2,mrepper,2,Sun Jul 19 19:38:28 2015 UTC,"Hey i have some friends that work for BHP haha.  could u show me what you used(rod, reel, bait)?"
Fishing,3dv3t2,OducksFTW,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:30:24 2015 UTC,"I got these on an 8' spinning rod, 20 lb. test main line to a double dropper rig of 25 lb. test monofilament with a swivel at the top, a 1/0 Seaguard circle hook with an orange bead on each dropper, to a snap swivel at the bottom and a 2-3 oz. pyramid sinker. I posted a bit about the bait in a response above just a minute ago.  My wife got the hat at a trade conference. It's a great hat!"

Fishing,3dveaj,Rocapery,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:07:48 2015 UTC,whats the name of the thing you use to grip the fishes mouth?
Fishing,3dveaj,anthonyfebre11,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:21:11 2015 UTC,I don't think they have a special name. Fish lip grabber? http://www.basspro.com/Bass-Pro-Shops-Grip-Master-II/product/97490/?cmCat=CROSSSELL_PRODUCT

Fishing,3dveaj,kemplaz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:11:47 2015 UTC,"Nice catch what were you using. Were going out on a charter Aug 22 can't wait, last year my best was 48"" hoping to beat that..."
Fishing,3dveaj,Bassmaster239,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:30:02 2015 UTC,"We were with a charter as well. Company was CAN-AM and I would highly recommend them. Our boat really had no experience whatsoever and they spent a lot of time going over the set up, teaching us about the fish, and were constantly checking lines and switching up baits. It was a blast.   I don't really know the official names of the lures. They used a combination of Bucktails and Crankbaits. Apparently they were all hand made from a guy in the area. There must have been a couple hundred of them in the boat!"
Fishing,3dwbst,kfaulk33,2,Mon Jul 20 01:59:31 2015 UTC,Sea Robin?
Fishing,3dwbst,WalleyeChaser,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:53:46 2015 UTC,That's definitely it. Thank you!!
Fishing,3dwbst,Sentoushien,2,Mon Jul 20 03:10:46 2015 UTC,"I think it is a Chelidonichthys lucerna, or Tub Gurnard (gurnards are also called sea robins, as mentioned before). It can have several different colours, but they tend to be a bit more blue on the fins, atleast the ones i have caught here in Norway. But i have also caught some with almost no blue on the fins. And they taste really nice, i would say some of the finest and firmest white meat you can find on saltwater fish."
Fishing,3dwbst,totesuncommon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:05:57 2015 UTC,Good to hear about the taste. Now I wish I had kept it!
Fishing,3dwbst,cokane_88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:27:05 2015 UTC,"He gave a monster fight on my freshwater rig.  The fish was successfully released.  If you know this fish, were those spines venomous?  Are they good to eat?  Thanks!"
Fishing,3dwbst,cokane_88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:00:03 2015 UTC,"The spines are sharp but not poisonous. They have a face like a cow catcher on a train, you can grab them by the cheeks. A friend eats them all the time, nice, firm flesh."
Fishing,3dvtyw,TrailChaser,3,Sun Jul 19 23:20:38 2015 UTC,Here are some pics from the day.   http://imgur.com/a/SdSOV   All were caught on live finger mullet caught on site with my cast net. I was freelining(hook and bait) and letting the mullet swim right in front of the redfish.  Having them in really shallow water makes them skittish so I fish the edges first so the fight doesn't spook the reds futher up on the flats. You can stand in the kayak and see more than a dozen tailing and busting little schools of baitfish.  My favorite kind of fishing.  Sauce: https://vimeo.com/133924570    edited to add HD vid
Fishing,3dvtyw,swfl55,3,Sun Jul 19 23:39:42 2015 UTC,Nice fish man!  Ive never had much luck sightfishing for reds but seems like youve caught it down
Fishing,3dvtyw,swfl55,3,Mon Jul 20 00:45:12 2015 UTC,"I was surprised to see them up there in that hot water and blazing sun.. I was looking for flounder in the deep holes by the marsh drains, but saw these big guys chasing schools of finger mullet into crazy shallow water.  One that was definitely over 30"" broke off my line and left making a massive wave heading back out to the safety of deeper water.  Air temp was about 100degs and water temp was reading 96degs on my depth finder."
Fishing,3dvtyw,bigredone88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:57:19 2015 UTC,Wow that is hot as hell I always thought they liked cooler water
