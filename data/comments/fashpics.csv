fashpics,3dnwu8,clitterati,4,Fri Jul 17 20:23:22 2015 UTC,This one is so good
fashpics,3dnwu8,angst_angst_angst,2,Sat Jul 18 01:32:28 2015 UTC,The second and fifth pictures down are perfection
fashpics,3dnwu8,Skelet0n_key,2,Sat Jul 18 01:32:18 2015 UTC,"This is so exquisite. I love the shape of everything in the fourth shot, it's so graceful. I could almost hang that picture on my wall."
fashpics,3dnwu8,seeyoshirun,2,Sat Jul 18 15:04:20 2015 UTC,"Number 2 has to be the definition of statuesque, love it."
fashpics,3dnwu8,kinder_bueno,2,Sat Jul 18 16:26:08 2015 UTC,this is great. i love the contrasting detail trim in the 5th photo. many upboats :)
fashpics,3d9blr,eternalstyles,6,Tue Jul 14 14:45:45 2015 UTC,"These are fantastic. Such a simple idea but it makes the shots so interesting to look at. The last one is my favourite, she looks like an insane queen."
fashpics,3d9blr,seeyoshirun,3,Tue Jul 14 15:40:26 2015 UTC,Totally. And I love the fashions!
fashpics,3d9blr,cheesesnax,2,Tue Jul 14 22:21:41 2015 UTC,I love how the mirrors (glass?) distort and magnify the fabrics. Very cool

fashpics,3cuu7q,mmonzeob,5,Fri Jul 10 23:26:56 2015 UTC,It's like the heat miser had a baby with the snow miser
fashpics,3cuu7q,USTS2011,3,Fri Jul 10 23:43:56 2015 UTC,"Oh gosh, this shot! I've seen this picture of Coco so many times and never knew where it was from. I love how she just looks sort of mildly annoyed about the fact that her 'do is on fire."
fashpics,3ct4az,seeyoshirun,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:41:52 2015 UTC,This is great.
fashpics,3c72c7,eternalstyles,8,Sun Jul 5 13:58:46 2015 UTC,"Hmm... I'm not crazy about this set. I think it's another one that's very sexy but not in a way that feels especially new or interesting.  It might have worked better if one of these shots were used as part of a larger set that wasn't all shot in the one bathtub, or if the poses or the styling felt a little more varied. My mind keeps going back to this similar shoot with Coco Rocha. I don't think Coco's photos were perfect, either, but the styling at least helped bring a bit more variety to the shots."
fashpics,3c72c7,seeyoshirun,3,Sun Jul 5 15:14:00 2015 UTC,"i like this as a contrast to the Anna and Natasha set i posted earlier.  the editorial itself has a high/low thing going on that i like. and also it presents the idea that its okay to chill in your bathtub while  you look amazing, no need to go out show it of, just look your best for yourself. cotton swabs in a glass with a stem is classy af."
fashpics,3c72c7,seeyoshirun,3,Mon Jul 6 19:57:12 2015 UTC,"That shot with the martini glass is my fave of the set, so I'm with you there. I can actually see the concept when you talk about it, but I think it could have been made a bit clearer."
fashpics,3c72c7,_hugerobots_,2,Tue Jul 7 12:39:11 2015 UTC,Any photographer notes for this set?
fashpics,3c4skl,seeyoshirun,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:59:22 2015 UTC,"ah, the eternal ""let me furrow my brow like something is concerning me"" look  youre being photographed, repeatedly. can only assume indigestion."

fashpics,3c0m78,Punica_granatum,-2,Sun Jul 12 10:16:48 2015 UTC,Boy do I fucking hate this one. So contrived. YUCK. Ughh!!!!
fashpics,3c0m78,warrenxpeace,5,Fri Jul 3 22:23:33 2015 UTC,"Well, that's... a strong reaction I wouldn't have expected. Can't say I completely agree. I think there's a subtle sense of desolation here that is really interesting."
fashpics,3c0m78,alxvch,5,Sat Jul 4 05:26:07 2015 UTC,I love it :)
fashpics,3bvtkf,seeyoshirun,3,Thu Jul 2 15:47:50 2015 UTC,"I've raved about Tim Walker before but it's worth mentioning again that he's one of my all-time favourite photographers for a reason. His images are just so vibrant and expressive and convey a real sense of place in a way that few other photographers can match.  He's worked with Karen many times over the years - at least one instance of which I've posted on here before, if you want to search for it - and the two together always create absolute magic. I found this spread when I picked up this issue of Vogue today and absolutely had to share it.  (There's also a really lovely travel diary from Karen in the issue. It sounds like she was as awed by the location as I was by these photos.)"
fashpics,3bvtkf,gorgossia,3,Thu Jul 2 15:56:27 2015 UTC,"Looks like the same kind of trip he took with Lily Cole to India!   Seeing as super Walker fans are hard to find, do you know where I can see The Lost Explorer or stills from it? It was his short film from several years ago."
fashpics,3bvtkf,gorgossia,2,Thu Jul 2 18:24:47 2015 UTC,"I did a quick search, looks like there was a book with a ton of stills and details about the film. It's on a few sites - Amazon, teNeues, Book Depository. Couldn't find anything about the film itself, though - perhaps you could see if there's a contact number/email on Tim's website?"
fashpics,3bvtkf,supah,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:44:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Might have to splurge for the book, his images are fascinating for me."
fashpics,3bvtkf,Kashna,2,Fri Jul 3 09:43:14 2015 UTC,No problem! I hadn't even heard of the film but I'm eyeing the book off myself now. I've already got a couple of his other ones!
fashpics,3bvtkf,hillbillypaladin,3,Fri Jul 3 13:37:13 2015 UTC,These are stunning
fashpics,3bvtkf,hillbillypaladin,2,Thu Jul 2 17:06:12 2015 UTC,Karen Elson is my favorite.
fashpics,3bvtk2,seeyoshirun,6,Thu Jul 2 15:47:44 2015 UTC,I adore Emilia Clarke and I am a HUGE Paolo Roversi fan... but this is crap.
fashpics,3bvtk2,jedrekk,3,Fri Jul 3 05:31:32 2015 UTC,"Along with the weird posing and lighting, doesn't it seem like they did some sort of weeeeird photoshopping of Emilia's face? She's usually so lovely and good at her job, but the whole thing just looks bizarre here.  I do like that first red netting dress, though. I wish it was photographed better."
fashpics,3bvtk2,Xhihou,4,Fri Jul 3 13:53:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's Photoshop; fashion photography often draws on lighting that emphasises the subject's bone structure - you can see it in the way her face has been spotlit from above in these shots, creating those much harsher shadows under her cheekbones and jaw. It's a very different way of lighting someone from television or film, where the lighting is generally a lot softer and intended to simulate reality a bit more."
fashpics,3bvtk2,Xhihou,2,Fri Jul 3 14:12:44 2015 UTC,"Hm... now that you point it out, I think you're right. I guess my mind just jumped to Photoshop because it can be so common? Fancy lighting can look really cool, but I guess it just didn't click for me this time!"
fashpics,3bvtk2,littlewondrousthings,2,Fri Jul 3 14:18:05 2015 UTC,"Well, it's one of the reason why fashion photography usually relies on very fit models/celebrities who are relatively young; they don't need a lot of Photoshop! That way they're also freer to experiment with weirder lighting/styling/make-up that not everyone would be able to pull off (though I agree, this particular look doesn't work so well for Emilia)."
fashpics,3bvtk2,SeriousBLAH,6,Fri Jul 3 14:21:50 2015 UTC,Thanks for the post. Have to say I'm not really a fan of this set though. I think the lighting and posing does nothing to enhance Ms. Clarke's stunning features or the clothing.
fashpics,3brmrn,eternalstyles,4,Wed Jul 1 16:20:47 2015 UTC,The first shot is gorgeous!
fashpics,3brmrn,Purplelurple123,3,Thu Jul 2 03:19:40 2015 UTC,"I agree, it's so pretty that it's almost surreal. My only complaint is that the tan looks a bit much in some of them (it stands out in the second shot in particular)."
fashpics,3brmrn,seeyoshirun,5,Thu Jul 2 10:15:09 2015 UTC,Great set!
fashpics,3brmrn,I_Am_Anti_Magic,3,Thu Jul 2 04:27:52 2015 UTC,Beautiful! Wow. Love it!

fashpics,3aq3s7,DrTitanium,6,Tue Jun 23 05:14:54 2015 UTC,"I interpreted it as someone posing in a way that one only would if they were really in love with themselves. There's something almost nymph-like about it.  It might also be one of those things where you're not used to it because the subject is a man, not a woman. It's more common to see a woman posing like that than a man."
