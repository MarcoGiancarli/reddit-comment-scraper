knitting,3e1thm,TotesMessenger,3,Tue Jul 21 09:18:55 2015 UTC,"Another freehand project! This little guy was commissioned by a fan of the videogame The Binding of Isaac. He was made with acrylic DK yarn and toy stuffing. All parts were knitted aside from the eyes, which were crocheted.  I know some of you are going to ask me for a pattern but it's difficult to describe what I did in words. This project was the culmination of simple techniques I picked up from YouTube, which included: knitting in the round; decreases and increases; a simple knitted heart pattern; and crocheting circles using double crochet. My ability to take on a project is very much limited by how well I can adapt simple techniques to create the finished product, which is why you don't see me posting anything terribly complex!"

knitting,3e36o4,farmererin,3,Tue Jul 21 16:37:15 2015 UTC,"Yarn is Isaac Mizrahi for Michael's Sutton. All hats are modified versions of this pattern to adapt to my kid's big coconut head, and because I didn't have wifi when it came time to cast off 2 of them.    I'm a very novice knitter, this is my first non-flat object and even then, each hat start to finish took a couple of hours of off and on knitting. I made all 3 over the course of 2 days. Curious George is modeling because it's way too hot to put a winter hat on"
knitting,3e36o4,Nefera,2,Tue Jul 21 16:42:31 2015 UTC,"Your tension is beautifully consistent in the hats - nice work!   Now would be a good time to double-check your technique though - I'm about 90% sure that you're twisting your stitches, most likely unintentionally? For some reason the ribbing looks just as it should, but the stockinette stitch section has the ""legs"" of the V-shaped stitches crossed, which is usually a telltale sign of twisted stitches. This is the easiest to see on the first photo, on the white-ish stockinette stitch stripe. Picture for reference.  While twisted stitches are a perfectly valid technique in knitting, doing them unintentionally may cause some unwanted surprises with fabric drape, gauge and behaviour - not to say anything about the confusion when you encounter a pattern that requires twisted stitches to be used! So, I'd recommend pulling up a knit and purl video, and double-checking that you stick the needle in through the loop at the correct direction, and that you wrap/pick the yarn in the direction intended."
knitting,3e36o4,Nefera,3,Tue Jul 21 19:19:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I was definitely stitching them weirdly, for a while I was even purling one hat, but I don't seem to twist them in my projects I've knit flat. I'm just happy they turned out ok! I feel like the ""I have no idea what I'm doing"" dog meme! What would deliberately twisting stitches in a pattern accomplish, by the way?"
knitting,3e36o4,HerVoiceEchoes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:37:13 2015 UTC,"One pretty common use is twisted rib. Twisted stitches bunch up to themselves, so they make a more defined row of stitches than regular knits. Lace patterns often use twisted stitches too, to create tight stitch lines to define shapes."

This way you can see for yourself how your washer and dryer will affect the yarn, and you can measure before and after to see exactly how much it shrinks or grows."
knitting,3e2qst,pukefist,6,Tue Jul 21 14:52:44 2015 UTC,"Most of my superwash experience is with socks - and I put them in the washer but not the dryer (but socks are easy to hang dry, while a sweater would have to lie flat). In my experience (socks), I've found that every trip through the dryer felted the socks a LITTLE BIT MORE than before. So, I'd suggest throwing that swatch in the washer/dryer with every load over the next few weeks and seeing how it looks coming out of the dryer every time. I'm assuming you're still knitting the sweater and you haven't finished it. Care instructions can always be modified!"

I used the superwash Swish in worsted to knit a hat for my sister years ago after my friend felted the same exact hat when I knitted it in alpaca yarn. I thought superwash meant that I could, you know, also throw it in the dryer. Nope. It's superwash, not superdry. The hat didn't shrink but it grew! And the yarn lost that pretty fullness to it before I dried it in the dryer. :("

knitting,3e2qst,trigly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:37:33 2015 UTC,"Hm. I've got a sweater made out of Cascade 220 superwash (not merino, just ""100% superwash wool"") that I throw in the washer and dryer regularly.  I usually wash in warm water, and my dryer is fairly low-temp (it's old). It has not felted one bit..  It is a bit 'fuzzier', halo-wise, than when I first knit it, but the stitch pattern is a field of knits with some purl, so any fuzziness or pilling is disguised.   I also tried hand washing a toque made of the same yarn in my early knitting days, before I realised how much it would grow when washed. I found putting it through the dryer actually revived some of the springiness that it lost when washed.  It probably depends on the yarn/washer/dryer, really. I'd do a test swatch, like recommended below. And if you're nervous, just hand wash!"
knitting,3e2q90,ldiejne,4,Tue Jul 21 14:37:01 2015 UTC,"My favorite way to switch up my knitting is to switch yarn weights. I've been knitting two enormous fair isle sweaters for a year in a heavy, scratchy worsted weight wool. I have a pair of socks I work on periodically in a smooth fine wool for when I need to give my fingers a break from the scratchy.  Changing from thick to thin is always a gratifying change- the fine wool feels so delicate to work after working with a thick workhorse, and the larger wool is so quick to work up compared to the sock yarn."

You are placing 16 stitches in the center front neckline onto a stitch holder, and using the rest of the stitches to make the hood (flat, yes).  Later you will put those stitches back on a needle and pick up stitches around the hood to finish the neckline and make a tube for the drawstring.    By the way, she doesn't include in the finishing directions to use yarnovers to make holes for the drawstring...but you have to do that.

I'm currently making a valiant attempt to expand my wardrobe by knitting 12 sweaters this year; I'm not sure I'll make it, but I've got a lot of really good ones to share:  Dead of winter:   Inishturk Sweater, a free pattern from Lion Brand Yarn made in their Fishermen's wool. Corrugated Box, a paid pattern knit in Knit Picks Wool of the Andes. I wear the absolute SHIT out of this. And no one has yet asked me if I knit it myself, which suggests to me that everyone thinks it's a commercial knit. Marin d'Eau Douce, a free pattern knit in Caron One Pound. Yes, I made a sweater out of acrylic. This is my house sweatshirt in wintertime. So comfy.   Cooler weather:   Grande Muraille, a sweater I actually test-knit this spring in mostly Madtosh Sock. I modded it to be a 3/4 sleeve cuz otherwise I was just going to shove them up :P Stilwell, a paid pattern by Jared Flood in Berocco Ultra Alpaca. I still need to sew some buttons on it but I've already worn it twice anyway because I love it so much. Oops. Steggie, based on a couple of free patterns and knit in Knit Picks Comfy worsted weight. When I'm having a bad day I will sit in my office and be a dinosaur because fuck you.   Warm weather:   Apres Surf Hoodie, a paid pattern knit in Knit Picks Comfy, my first fingering weight sweater. I wear this a lot on cooler summer evenings, but I'll also wear it during early fall days over a tank top or later over a long sleeved top. Crazy Stripes, a paid pattern knit in a merino/cashmere blend but fairly loose. I just finished this a little over a month ago but I wear it a lot. I love the fit.   Okay I don't wear them THAT much:   Havar, a paid pattern that's not worth the paid part, knit in Cascade 220 Superwash. I'll probably wear this more this fall now that I've lost a little weight; a knitted dress/tunic is not particularly forgiving. Space Girl, a paid pattern that's fun but it's not particularly wearable, knit in a cotton/wool blend. I mostly wear this at cons with a Star Trek science officer pin cuz I'm a nerd, though I've worn it a couple of times in day-to-day. Drop Stitch Lace Tank, from a book I found a PDF of online, in Knit Picks Comfy worsted. I have never worn this; it doesn't fit. Ironic, since the book was called ""fitted knits"". I'm glad I didn't pay for it. This will probably get frogged soon.   Bonus limited wear but worth it:   SUCH VEST, free pattern with custom chart. I can really only get away with wearing this a couple of times a year but I'd wear it every goddamn day if I could.   I've got a couple of cardigans on the needles right now (one's almost done, I just need to find a tapestry needle; the other one's a long-haul laceweight), and I'm about to cast on a worsted weight pullover.

I also get a fair bit of wear out of my Catkin. It's fancy enough to be work-appropriate.  Of the other three sweaters I've made, all were pullovers. I do wear them, but not as often. I wasn't quite satisfied with the sleeve length on one (my first sweater, which I seem to have lost. :( ), the next is a bit scratchy so I only wear it with something else underneath, which limits the wearing time, and the last I just made this year, so time will tell (it's not work-fancy, but it is super comfy, so I think it'll get a more around-the-house wear).   I used to love shrugs, so I made one in my first year of knitting thinking I'd wear it a lot. It was just a lacy rectangle folded and sewed at the armpits, so the fit wasn't spectacular, and though I wore it a few times, it mostly lives at the bottom of my drawer. I've quit wearing shrugs in general anyway, so that could be more of the reason.  I think it's important not to make a sweater chosen on a whim. I make myself one a year, and I try to pick one that I was immediately attracted to when I first saw it, but that I also keep coming back to and loving. I scan through my faves before going into the pattern search.   Some sweaters I go ""WOW"" and add to faves, but when I go back to look at them, I think ""nice, but not for me"". Bigger garments are one of those things that I think you shouldn't do just because you want to try out the technique. The risk of disliking is something I'm not willing to run after all that work. Toques and scarves and mitts are for the fun experiments!"

My stash is large enough to keep me knitting for a few years, so I'm working on that. I've purchased 5 skeins total this year and used up 2 of them. I have projects in place for the other 3. Those 5 skeins cost less than $100."

If I don't have a project that meets those criteria, I find something my stash can be used for to keep my hands busy until inspiration strikes.   So to answer OP's question, for the first 7 months of 2015 I have spent a total of $200 - about $30/month average."

Other then that I am working through the stash. So no other purchases.  It helps that almost all the yarn I have, was purchased with a particular project in mind, so it is just a matter of plodding through.     I find the hardest part is where I have significant left overs, trying to find a use for them.    I have this one skein of Noro Kama left that I really want to use, but 75m isn't going to take me far, and it is a difficult colour way  to pair with .     After almost a year of mulling it over, I think I am going to need to buy a nice grey yarn to pair it with.  Now I just need to mull over a pattern...  Edit:  So I should have a proper conclusion to my rambling- which is that my spend seems to be flood / drought based, I got carried away, and now I have to exercise discipline.  I have six 8.5L tubs of yarn, not including the SO cardigan.  Easily several hundred dollars worth of yarn.  All purchased within about a 4-month time frame.   That's easily 1-2 years of my knitting time purchased in 4 months.  And that ladies and gentlemen, is why I am cold sheeping myself."

We want to start putting our ""extra"" money towards house remodeling, and I'm out of room for storing this stuff anyway.  Of course this doesn't count for Black Friday sales. Because reasons.  As far as budgeting tips, all I can really recommend is to be honest with yourself. I see no problem with people spending serious money on yarn and the like, as long as they're certain they can afford it - now and in the long run. We recently had our air conditioner break down in a house we've lived in for less than a year. In the middle of summer. In Florida.

I used to buy $$$ yarn for gift and projects but now I'm dwindling down because I have yarn left over, I only have 2-3 WIPs I'm working on, and the gifts I make are quick and require small amounts of yarn (baby stuff, crochet amigurumi).

Then, brook my foot and even more over a year ago, my ankle often ballon to the size of a watermelon and it look awful in lovely heels. When we moved, I donate over 50 pairs of shoes.  I've bought lot of needles, accessories, and yarn. I have plans for all that yarn, always bought with project in mind and enough for cardigan or sweater. Most have been bought online, and on sale, so, it's not so bad. But, looking at that stash, I probably spend over 2k last year.  I should be good for a while.

Since cold sheeping, while I haven't gone completely off of buying yarn, I'm much more conservative and thoughtful about it, only buying for specific projects.  I think of budgets like diets in that I can't stick to them.  I like buying things and I like ice cream so there you go.  However, I do try to maximize what I buy.  Are you buying from somewhere with a rewards program, like Eat Sleep Knit or Loopy Ewe?  With sweater quantities you'll really rack up gift certificates quickly.  If you aren't already doing that, you should look into it and see if it interests you (they both carry madtosh, one of my drugs of choice).  I say regardless, buy what you like.  Don't suffer with cheap yarn if you don't like knitting with cheap yarn, especially if you can afford what you do like.  Life is too short."

Sometimes I go looking for specific qualities in a yarn and sometimes I just go into the shop, pick up everything I like, think about what I could do with them and then put back the ones I could do without (for the moment). When I was relearning to knit I used to buy yarn just because I liked the look of it, and I actually still have some lying around with no plans for it. I only bought one skein recently that I have no idea what to do with, but I did have a plan when I bought it and changed my mind."

knitting,3dzy83,allgoaton,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:57:03 2015 UTC,"Oof. I recently dropped nearly 100 at knitpicks on two sweaters worth of yarn, and thought that was bad. I no longer buy a lot of luxury yarn, though I've been pining after a sweater in Miss Babs Northumbria in French Marigold... so I may scrimp and save a lot to make that happen."

knitting,3dzy83,Dani_Daniela,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:03:45 2015 UTC,"When I first started knitting just over 2 years ago I spent so much money (for me) on yarn. I am not cold sheep, but I am trying to control myself.   I spent $75 on yarn when my LYS had a sale, and I have plans to spend ~$100 tonight because I found a woman on kijiji that is selling the inventory of her craft store that closed. $1/ball no matter what it is. I am antsy with anticipation lol  I am planning on buying a set of wooden DPNs, which are less than $50 at my LYS."
knitting,3dzy83,Dani_Daniela,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:00:10 2015 UTC,"I think I've spent around $200 this year so far. I try to always only buy yarn with a specific project in mind, and I don't feel as bad if they are gifts for people. I also lucked out and got a bunch of yarn for Christmas last year and some for my birthday/graduation this year, so that helped cut down on the cost. I am trying to knit through my stash and hold off on buying any more, except if I need it to finish a project or something."
knitting,3dzy83,cat_kirk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:28:14 2015 UTC,"Are you knitting fast enough to use it in a timely manner, or is it just piling up unused? Cold sheepers often reference SABLE - Stash Amassed Beyond Life Expectancy. But if you are using it immediately, and can afford it, consider it both clothing and entertainment budget and have fun.  I have a big stash from when i couldn't stop myself from buying yarn on impulse. Often a skein here and there, but I wasn't experienced enough to know how much I really needed of each in order to make a FO.  When I came to the realization that I didn't have enough of lots of the yarns to complete the projects I wanted to work on, like sweaters, or even shawls, I seriously curtailed my buying. I've started only buying for specific projects when I already had the pattern picked out. I still appreciate having my backup stash so I can bust out a baby hat when the need arises, but my stash has stopped growing and I'm knitting with better quality fibers.   That being said, big sales still get me. I try to keep my Ravelry queue stacked with the next three projects I really really want to make up top, then when there is a sale I buy only for those projects. So far it's working. I typically spend $150-200/year at sales (Knit Picks Black Friday!) for stash, and then less than $100/year on smaller items and gifts when yarn bought specifically for a project and knit up within a couple weeks."
knitting,3dzy83,tikibyn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:13:33 2015 UTC,"I spin but sometimes I still buy yarn. This year I've only spent about 15 dollars on yarn so far. I'm trying to use up my stash. I've bought two fleeces - one for $35, one for $25 and I have spun about half of one and the other never seems to get smaller! I've spent another 50-75 on accessories like a big bobbin for my wheel and replaced a couple of sock needles that broke."
knitting,3dzy83,starlightprincess,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:22:10 2015 UTC,"Before I was Cold Sheep, I would spend about $20 every couple of months. I primarily get my yarn from JoAnn Fabrics and A.C. Moore with coupons. At the Webs tent sale I spent around $50, but that was only the 2nd yarn spending I did this year. Mostly it's been accessories lately, I needed a swift and needles for Magic Loop."
knitting,3dzy83,FistofanAngryGoddess,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:28:17 2015 UTC,"This thread makes me feel better about my spending habbits :P I think I've spent around $200 on yarn and related items since January. But in 2014 I spent quite (I don't have a record though, rough estimate maybe $600?) a bit building up a big stash, and over $100 on needles and hooks."
knitting,3dzy83,arcticfawx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:30:16 2015 UTC,"Woo big girl jobs! They're great.  I don't spend at all on accessories anymore; inherited a bunch of needles and have received interchangeables, swift, and winder as gifts. So uhhh keep a well-tended wish list! Ha.  For yarn, I tend to buy middle of the line; I don't go all out on hand-dyed limited run stuff, but I also don't buy at Michael's or Walmart. (No shade thrown if you do either of those, it's just not my thing!) I occasionally splurge on a small amount of 'not sure what to use this for' yarn while travelling; usually that's my main souvenir.  My biggest tips for keeping both stash and budget reasonable:   Only buy (yarn and patterns) when you have a specific project in mind, and only if you're going to start knitting it immediately. Like someone else said, keep the three projects you plan to do next at the top of your Rav queue. That way if you innocently stumble upon a huge sale, you can be smart about your purchases.   In the end, you might end up paying more per project this way (ie you bought the yarn at full price instead of two years ago when it was on sale) but you will definitely make something out of everything you buy. After all, you didn't really save money if you bought a load of yarn and never ever get around to doing anything with it."

I used to only own a Boye Needlemaster set - and yes, having picked up a Knitter's Pride set which I LOVE I can assure you the Boye set is not the best bang for your buck, but it'll last forever if you treat it right and frankly, it's easier to find at a big box brick n' mortar store than the more expensive sets for which you need to find an LYS or shop online. That isn't always an option. Downside: It's just got the nastiest, stiffest, most uncooperative cables in existence. This is my only real complaint."
knitting,3e0rlt,StephieGirl1215,2,Tue Jul 21 01:57:35 2015 UTC,"You could always take a stab at making your own? I just picked up from the library this book, The Knitter's Handy Book of Top-Down Sweaters, and it walks you through figuring out how to start, how to figure out the size you want, and how to customize it. It's not a pattern book (though there are a few in there), it's pretty much a ""how-to"" primer. That might be the best way for you to get all the elements you want in your cardigan.  As far as stripes vs cables go - I think that's a matter of personal tastes. I think it can look a bit busy, but some people love the effect. And on top of that, you've got dark colors, which tend to not work well w/ cables - one of the key aspects of cables is shadows help make it a bit more three dimensional. On a dark yarn, it's tough to make out the details. I probably would choose something with texture or maybe a subtle lace effect.  Don't rule pullover sweater patterns out - you can always steek it!  No help with hoods - that's something I want to tackle, too."
knitting,3e0rlt,SandD0llar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:34:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! I may consider doing my own since I'm interested in design and I have published (a few) patterns on ravelry, but I guess I'm just nervous since I've never done a sweater before and they just always seem so much more involved, what with sizing and everything.   I totally agree with what you say about stripes and cables. I've only done cables a few times and that's interesting what you said about how shadows make it more dimensional. In fact, the one sweater I want the most is a cream/white cabled sweater but I'm SO particular about how I want it that I still haven't found the right pattern or the right look of one at a store, and I look for it every winter! Anyway, it's out of my mind for now while I attempt this cardigan. :)  God steeks scare the hell out of me!! :D  Good luck with finding a good hoodie! It just feels like such a good idea :)"
knitting,3e0rlt,SandD0llar,2,Tue Jul 21 02:47:23 2015 UTC,"Do your homework! A big part of why steeking works is because wool felts a bit. You mentioned acrylic, which I briefly forgot when suggesting steeking. But a quick search on the interweb indicate that a few knitters have steeked acrylic."
