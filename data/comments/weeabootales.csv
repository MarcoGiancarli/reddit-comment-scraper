weeabootales,3e0pyq,Emirae,4,Tue Jul 21 14:55:39 2015 UTC,He saves his money and he said that his long term boyfriend would pay for his surgeries. He said instead of a nice watch for his anniversary he got pecs.

If I met this girl and her mother in person, I'd give them a piece of my mind. Japanese culture, accents, and mannerisms are not fucking fashion accessories nor are they hobbies. It's one thing to be interested in Japan, watch Japanese TV, and wear their fashion, but it's something else entirely when you do this sort of shit."

weeabootales,3e0pyq,owlowlingson,6,Tue Jul 21 06:47:00 2015 UTC,I feel like we should encourage people like this to move to Japan and see for themselves.  Life is hilariously cruel and would wake them the fuck up about how delusional they really are.
weeabootales,3e0pyq,The80sWereCool,2,Tue Jul 21 14:41:09 2015 UTC,Venus and Margaret somehow do live in Japan.

Help him bulk up hard and we'll see if we can't make him normal.   The alternative is to have this poor weeb staying scrawny and trying to talk your ear off. Or telling him off and he stays both weird and scrawny forever.   A humanitarian mission has fallen into your lap. You've got this.   TL;dr help him SwolebiWanKenobi, you're his only hope."

Definitely use that to leeway into proper exercise!   Also the cooking anime he's talking about is most likely Shokugeki no Soma, which is actually very good.

weeabootales,3dzkq0,Drudicta,6,Tue Jul 21 15:20:58 2015 UTC,Is? I heard that almost immediately in episode 1 it has sexual references in it. =/ Which bothers me. I want a cooking anime for cooking.
weeabootales,3dzkq0,CheeseyMayor,12,Mon Jul 20 23:26:02 2015 UTC,"Lol yes there is fanservice but that's because the artist for the manga used to do hentai so...yeah.  However, you'll see how it's done in hilarious ways. Also the cooking aspects of the show are actually really interesting and oh god so delicious looking. I promise you, it's something that isn't as bad as it sounds. Do the 3 episode test at the very least."
weeabootales,3dzkq0,Drudicta,4,Tue Jul 21 00:10:03 2015 UTC,"I'll try it then, thank you. I just hope I don't end up cringing every few minutes."
weeabootales,3dzkq0,frodonk,11,Tue Jul 21 01:04:35 2015 UTC,"The sexually themed stuff turned me off too during the first episodes but there hasn't been many scenes like that lately, I'm glad I didn't drop it. There's a guy that's almost always naked though, but he's wearing an apron so that's.. ok I guess?  All in all if you're familiar with anime cooking shows Shokugeki no Souma just replaced the exaggerated ""volcano erupting and beams of light coming out of the taster's mouth"" trope with ""people getting orgasmic and sexually stimulated"" scenes to indicate that what they're eating is delicious."
weeabootales,3dzkq0,Drudicta,5,Tue Jul 21 02:46:20 2015 UTC,So there are going to be weird orgasmic tropes anyway. ._. I'll still try it.

Each person only knows about 5-10% of the lyrics, none of them the same ones. They only saw the choreography 5 minutes ago and haven't ever done it themselves.

weeabootales,3dwsbe,treeman798,5,Mon Jul 20 05:27:50 2015 UTC,"A song is a song man, personally I don't think any song warrants 'weeb points' for being enjoyable for you. No one should be judged based on what music they like. It's just not fair. If you enjoy a song, then enjoy it. Don't worry about what other people think of the song or you for liking it. I listen to music from anime all the dang time and I don't feel the slightest worry admitting it."
weeabootales,3dwsbe,treeman798,-1,Mon Jul 20 05:33:32 2015 UTC,"The problem is, not only do I find it enjoyable, but I also find it extremely annoying. Its a paradox."

Honestly I can't fault you for liking it and it doesn't make you a weeb for liking it. Its kinda catchy, if annoying, but again, pretty sure that's the point."

The reason I say I don't want to offend you isn't to spare your feeling I just like reading good stories on here and seeing how prolific you are with your writing you could probably turn your experiences into some pretty entertaining stories with a few adjustments.   First, stop trying to make yourself look better. If the people in your stories are assholes then your readers will understand that. We don't need to hear how great you are. In the same vein you don't need to explain to us that you aren't a weeaboo. Most people who go around the comments calling people weeaboos have made up their mind in the first few sentences. My trying to explain why you're not a weeaboo you are basically asking for troll's.  Second, dear lord try to make things funny. This is honestly just a personal preference so if it really isn't your style feel free to ignore me. But at least for me if I am reading a long story like this the writing better be engaging. I'm not saying you have to use my style of similes, similes galore and green text everywhere. But read other peoples stories and try to find a style that suits you. Because in all honestly your writing style was dull and you sound bitter.  Hope to see more from you.  -Love NotShy"

Sex and violence is actually a pretty decent way to hold readers attention though it's not really my thing. I think it was just the way you sounded kind of pretentious through the first half. I get that trashing anime is par for the course with this sub but as a much better writer than me said (And I'm paraphrasing badly) ""The reader should not feel like the bad guy for disagreeing with you.""    Also, and I understand this is probably just a typo but if you are going to make such a big deal about not being a weeb and speaking perfect japanese people are going to be more critical of your japanese. There is no „ÅÆ in the word gomennasai („Åî„ÇÅ„Çì„Å™„Åï„ÅÑ) I actually feel weird for correcting you on that one seeing as I made a similar mistake in one of my own stories.

weeabootales,3dltef,TheSoftestTaco,2,Fri Jul 17 14:23:06 2015 UTC,"This happened early in my congoing days but it's always been in the back of my mind whenever I go to one. A few years back I had just moved to a different country, but came back to the States frequently to visit since my dad still lives there. An old friend of mine suggested we head to a con together the next time I was in town, which I gladly accepted.  The day came and we had a great time, our cosplays were shitty and last-minute but hey, it wasn't a huge deal, it was more about hanging out with each other and catching up. As cons usually go, you end up hanging out with a group of randoms, and I met some acquaintances of my friend's when we all ended up in a group. Unfortunately, this group included....Neko-chan. (dun dun DUN.)   Looking back I should have been suspicious at first glance, she seemed to have some hambeast qualities- pretty overweight, choppy hair in a mix of badly-dyed colours that all sort of merged into a murky greyish brown, you can imagine the picture. It didn't really register at the time since I met her towards the end of the day when everyone was getting a little crusty. (Neko-chan mentioned she'd been in lolita earlier before changing out. I shudder to think what Milanoo horror she probably squeezed herself into.)   About 5-7 of us headed back to the hotel room belonging to Neko-chan and her roommate, an adorable lolita girl who I remain friends with to this day. At the con and on the way up to the room I'd mainly been dividing my time between everyone in the group, but once it had dwindled down I began to notice Neko-chan said some things that were...odd. She told me she had gone to art school, and I was in to art and was considering going to school for it myself I began asking her some questions about it. She then admitted to me she'd dropped out after a short time since they ""weren't teaching her what she wanted to know."" Apparently that baka college had made her gasp DO WATERCOLOURS. And she didn't WANT to do watercolours, she wanted to jump right into creating manga! She'd said she was in an art fundamentals course, which I knew includes a rotation to introduce you to many different forms of art, so you can see what your skills are and decide what to narrow your focus on. Correct me if I'm wrong but I think it's also where you're bumped down to if you're not skilled enough yet to get into said narrow focuses, which I suspected was the case with Neko-chan.   She then went on to talk about how she was saving up to go to an art school in Japan, where she could become a mangaka- she already had a huge story planned out (I didn't ask her what it was about at the time but now I kinda wish I had for shits and giggles.) I asked her that if she didn't like the course she had been in, why did she think the same one in Japan would be any different? She shrugged and said, ""It's just better."" ok then. I decided to leave it at that and talked some more with her roommate, who looked horribly embarrassed throughout this whole mess. I didn't blame her.   Then in the middle of my damn sentence, Neko-chan does this...thing. I'm not really sure how to describe it, she basically clenched her fists like two paws under her chin, wiggled her body around, scrunched up her face in what was probably supposed to look something like the 3^ face (spoiler alert: it did not) and went ""Nya, nya!"" in the highest-pitched shriek that ever came straight out of your nightmares. I bluescreened for a few seconds trying to process what I had just witnessed, finally coming to and asking her what that was about. She ""tee-hee""'d and said she just did that when she got excited. OK THEN.   I decided to get out of there before things got any worse, since it was getting dark and at the time I was pretty young and my dad didn't want me staying out too late. Neko-chan gave me her Tumblr url, the only thing I remember about it was her posting a picture of some Kpop boyband and saying ""Kpop boys can be pretty nice...but they'll never be as good as my Jpop boys :3"" nopenopenope.jpg It's been a few years and I haven't had contact with her since, I wonder if she ever followed through on going to Japan.

This sub just seemed like a good place to talk out the fact that yes I had this really cringy phase but its cool to laugh about it because it is kinda ridiculous and yes people who do seem to go really deep down the rabbit hole can recover from it."
weeabootales,3dle1t,NotGloomp,5,Fri Jul 17 08:11:40 2015 UTC,Most people are into weird shit on the down low.
weeabootales,3dle1t,motokochan,3,Sat Jul 18 05:30:12 2015 UTC,"Oh no, I'm way over my obnoxious phase. I had a pretty bad rebel/sorta emo phase around the same time and got over that as well. I just can never find a consistent definition for what a weeb really is and like to cover my bases since most of them say that even liking anime/manga makes you one. Honestly, unless I'm around friends or someone asks I don't bring it up."
weeabootales,3dle1t,motokochan,3,Fri Jul 17 17:20:29 2015 UTC,"At least for this sub, rule #2 covers what counts. I personally agree with it. It's fine to simply like anime/manga, collect figures, listen to J-Pop/Rock/etc. You have a hobby/interest, and that can be a healthy thing. Heck, it might even make you a more interesting person if you handle it well.  The ""weeaboo"" is when it becomes the total of you and when you're obnoxious about it and completely socially unaware of the situation.  As for me, I do pretty much all of what I listed above. I also know how to code, listen to many other forms of music (from Enya to Rammstein to Alan Jackson), read tons of genres (non-fic economics and other, historical fic, mysteries, classic lit, etc.), and try to expand my borders every day. Sure, I sometimes wear an anime-themed shirt, but I also have some nice computer-related ones and some blank ones too that I wear much more often.  If you want to distance yourself from being weeaboo, get to be a well-rounded person. You don't have to know or do everything, but everything you have some knowledge of will make you a much more interesting person and give you a lot more discussion topics over anime/manga."
weeabootales,3dle1t,Mquestionmark,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:29:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I over looked Rule #2 a few hours ago just to make sure it wasn't one of the ones that would incidentally end up classifying me as a Japanophile as well and so far I'm pretty much in the clear. Multiple definitions for the exact same word just make me a bit confused sometimes and I just like to cover my bases since Weeboo has so many differing definitions."
weeabootales,3dle1t,Mquestionmark,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:24:34 2015 UTC,It certainly isn't a term that has a widely-agreed definition.

And it was then I knew I was stupid for hatin)  and unfortunately any interest in japan or speaking japanese if you're a different nationality automatically kind of gives you weeb points. The j pop don't help"
weeabootales,3dle1t,Mattfornow,3,Sat Jul 18 00:45:22 2015 UTC,"Meh. I'm into a lot of things so I expect to still have some weeb points, and yes Adam is awesome and I wonder what his next vid'll be since I think he's done with his Genius of Synecdoche New York review is done and he put out a new Thoughts On vid the other day.  But yeah, since I mainly speak it so I don't forget what I do know I'm not surprised that still gives me weeb points. Damn my like of J-Pop for being catchy. Always knew it'd be my downfall."
weeabootales,3dle1t,LegendaryGinger,2,Fri Jul 17 06:08:18 2015 UTC,"I feel you, I can remember the year I decided to stop being weeb trash and toned it down a lot. I used to want anything and everything anime and manga and now limit it to just the really good stuff.   I also used to write embarrassing fanfiction (some slash for my friend who is still balls deep in weeb world, and horrible mary sue inserts of me dating my favourite characters ugh) and I'm glad I never put any of it online and I actually burnt the bulk of it and shredded the rest.   I never got toooo into the music so I'm grateful I escaped that. My only manga books now are the re released sailor moons and the pokemon adventure books, which to outsiders come off as just childhood nostalgia.   I'd say weebiness and japan seem to have an addictive like quality to it, they know what sells and how to hook people for sure. It's hard to break away from once you're really into it, and the community surrounding it and supporting it doesn't exactly help. And I guess I find it kind of sad that the western world is starting to cash in on cartoons as well (My little pony, adventure time, steven universe, all have HUGE obsessed fanbases that remind me of the anime days)   as long as you aren't screaming about pocky and waifus and ""glomping"" people I think you'll be okay. And furries are nowhere near as disrespectful or obnoxious as weeaboos, in my experience. I actually kind of started to find them charming as time went on."
weeabootales,3dle1t,Mquestionmark,3,Fri Jul 17 06:16:21 2015 UTC,"The only person I've ever ""glomped"" was my ex boyfriend (who didn't dump me for being a weeb we just mutually broke up believe it or not) and that's cuz he was cool with it. And to be fair Steven Universe is good and deep but you really need to stay away from the fandom. Like, just look at some of the posts on Tumblr in Action regarding the show. They're actually worse than weebs truthfully which is sad because the show is good. But I digress. I don't even have a waifu even though some art styles do make their girls look nice and pocky is good but jeez I don't understand how people get uber obsessed over it."
weeabootales,3dle1t,dorf_physics,2,Fri Jul 17 06:25:25 2015 UTC,"yeah I'm not gonna lie and say I don't enjoy the anime art styles.  and I never got the pocky thing personally, it's good but nothing to write home about. Japan has way better snacks lurking the shelves anyways."
weeabootales,3dle1t,Mquestionmark,2,Fri Jul 17 06:38:46 2015 UTC,"Truth. I like the varying art styles because I was mostly raised on Western toons like Ren & Stimpy and the like and its nice to get a different, slightly more expressive style every now and then. I used to draw but not anymore, mostly because typing has rendered my hand control with pencils all but shittier than it was before.   And I've always wanted to try different snacks, mostly because Pocky's not all that good although I do prefer the strawberry variant more, but I've never really been able to find anything other than Pocky. I did try Dango, the three colored rice dough puff things filled with sweet red bean paste, but I had to go all the way to Wegmans in almost another district to get the damn things and they charged an arm and a leg for them. I'd gladly take some recommendations to try and maybe order offline if I can't get them locally since I love food no matter where it comes from."

Maybe because it is a part of their identity and they want to share it with a community? They also have an art community and role play, and not all of it is sexual in nature. Some people just wish they were animals/are fascinated by animals and enjoy characters with animal-like features.   we had shit like sonic and thundercats and epic amounts of other video games and cartoons with sexualized half animal or anthropomorphic characters in it, so it's not too far fetched that people growing up with these things during childhood and puberty would be interested in it. As I said earlier I had a full blown internet crush on a dude and didn't even find out he was a furry until much much later because he's not in your face about it.   They tend to only post or talk about furry related things in furry designated places so why does it matter? You don't go on bondage forums or subs and complain about people announcing their fetishes.   As long as they aren't fucking animals (which is a different fetish altogether) I don't see the harm in adults dressing up like cute animals and hanging out. (or taking it to the bedroom)"
weeabootales,3dle1t,Bridgeru,2,Fri Jul 17 07:10:21 2015 UTC,"Not all furries are in it for sexual reasons or fetishes.   That makes it ever weirder to me. If it was just a sex thing, it'd be more understandable. But a lot of furries like to just dress up and... walk about.   Maybe because it is a part of their identity and they want to share it with a community?  You don't go on bondage forums or subs and complain about people announcing their fetishes.   To be clear; no issue with people telling each other on the internet behind an anonymous internet handle, or at some kind of convention or meetup for a specific kink, just telling people IRL. If someone were to find out someone had a weird kink of some sort, that's fine, just people intentionally announcing it to the world I find strange. And it's not like a announcing your sexual orientation if you're gay, or your gender identity if your trans. Those things are relevant to your social life; some weird fetish you masturbate to isn't."

I stick around because I hope to see this subreddit grow into a better, friendly community of anime-fans that collectively laugh at the stupid and embarrassing shit they used to do, or that they witnessed their friends do, in middle or high school.

weeabootales,3ddee7,Scarx33,73,Wed Jul 15 11:53:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly, he doesn't really sound like a weeb quite yet. Is he inserting Japanese words randomly into conversations? Talking about his waifu? Talking about how the Japanese are best at everything and wanting to move there, using the Japanese that he 'learned' from watching anime? If he's not, then you're cool. Keep hanging out with him; it's important to stay social. Plus, if you're inherently hostile to him regarding anime, that will only push him closer to weeb-dom. If he starts chattering on about his anime moe shit, redirect the conversation to a topic where you can both contribute, rather than him monopolizing your time together.  Do keep in mind that it's possible to be a fan of anime and appreciate Japanese culture without fetishizing it the way weebs do.    BUT, in the event that he does go full-weeb, make sure your friend has a well-rounded understanding of Japanese culture. Ensure he understands that Japan isn't some Disney park filled with waifu and meido- it's a nuanced, rich country with thousands of years of history, and like any culture, it has its cool parts (anime! Geisha! Jpop!) and not so cool parts (xenophobia! Misogyny! Unacknowledged WW2 atrocities!). Get him some history books that take a warts-and-all look at Japan. If he rejects them and calls you a baka gaijin, pray he outgrows this phase and move on."

Honestly, my first anime was K-ON! and I'm proud of my decisions. Just because he prefers slice of life anime doesn't mean he goes full weeaboo immediately. Don't hate on KyoAni. Not cool.   The only time I can see him going full weeaboo is if he starts inserting Japanese words into regular conversations, disowning his heritage and trying to be Japanese in a sickeningly cringeworthy way. Simply having an interest in Japanese culture and the language isn't enough to say that he is a weeaboo.  Allow him to explore anime and the culture of Japan. Maybe actually help him in not being sickeningly cringeworthy by researching things for him or correcting him when he's wrong. Holding him back may make him want to hide his hobby even more, accelerating his descension into bedroom weeaboo."
weeabootales,3ddee7,rysx,-2,Wed Jul 15 16:43:12 2015 UTC,"So what's to like about KyoAni except short skirts and cute girls? No offense, serious question, I'm genuinely interested."
weeabootales,3ddee7,rysx,10,Wed Jul 15 18:20:44 2015 UTC,"Their attention to detail and the quality of the animations. With the K-ON! Movie (I know, that crap), the amount of effort that they put into the scenes and the animations comes through when I can identify every single location Not my blog in London that has been used. Even if their other locations in Kyoto are unidentifiable to me, they put tremendous amounts of detail in their animation. It's a lot better than a certain studio's efforts in even making something remotely good.  Also, just hating on an anime studio because most of their shows don't suit your tastes is bullshit. It's like saying ""I hate SHAFT because all their characters do that weird head thing."""
weeabootales,3ddee7,rethardus,3,Wed Jul 15 19:37:10 2015 UTC,"Hmkay, maybe its just not my taste. To me personally these shows with such a ""light"" plot are simply not that interesting.

Not all epic shows are good and not all slice of life are boring. It's like saying food can only be good when they're sweet because you like sweet food. No, you can admit a dish is well cooked even though you don't like bitter for example. Just rate stuff accordingly, your taste should not be a worldwide standard."

weeabootales,3ddee7,anarchism4thewin,9,Thu Jul 16 18:30:48 2015 UTC,"The animation is pure quality, and honestly stuff like K-On! isn't all about the 'moeshit' that some people spout about it. It really is just watching high school girls get into all kinds of shenanigans where the comedy is actually quite awesome. KyoAni just makes quality content objectively. Even if you don't like the genre or plot or what have you, there's no way their success comes from no where. Their latest show, Hibike! Euphonium has a really good plot, in depth characters (like most of their shows, another thing to add to what's great about KyoAni,) and really good comedic timing and emotional timing. Anime more focused around music like K-On and Hibike! Euphonium are more interesting especially to an aspiring musician such as myself. There might be a bit of bias because K-On is my favorite anime as well as KyoAni being my favorite studio, but I hope you got the gist of it through my rambling."
weeabootales,3ddee7,LookACastle,2,Wed Jul 15 19:32:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly, as a recovered anime watcher(I use that jokingly, but at one point I had a lot of free time and was not very selective. Now... I haven't watched anything for a year or two), stuff like Lucky Star is good just for being lightheartedly funny in the same way azumanga daioh was. There's a lot of really trashy moe shows, but I would hardly say Lucky star and other KyoAni shows are that bad(though perhaps they work as a gateway to other stuff)  It can be pretty hard sometimes to tell apart shows that are just trashy and shows that are actually good, despite being a bunch of kawaii girls and/or magical with girls. E.g. Madoka Magica is a pretty grim fighting show with magical girls reskinning. On the other hand something like Raimuiro Senkitan(Pretty old show... I just haven't really watched any trashy stuff in a long time so can't think of anything else) was just moe trash"

Almost everyone who watched their first anime series rated them highly, and when they rewatch it years later, after being exposed to other series, they then think that those first shows aren't as great as they thought before. Perfectly normal and happens all the time.   I got confused about that statement where you said that he didn't stop after watching Attack on Titan. Was he supposed to stop after that? If so, why? No offence, but it's as if you thought he should stop because he went from mainstream series to (IMO shitty) slice of life anime like K-on and Lucky Star. Liking SoL shows doesn't mean he's becoming a weeb.  Kyoto Animation constantly produces quality animated series, that's why it's generally liked. Their shows might not have the best plot, but you can always count on a particular scene so beautifully animated that can blow you away.  As for anime conventions, again, it's something new, why not let him experience it?  TL;DR - liking (shitty) anime doesn't automatically turn one into a weeb. Chill dude, let him explore.  Although, come back here when he exhibits the following symptoms:   Wears an anime shirt all the time Stops taking a bath regularly Talks about anime constantly Hates you for expressing a contrary opinion on a series/character that he likes Talks about ""waifus"", uses words like ""baka gaijin"" and suddenly thinks Japan is better than everyone else."

The reason why there was so much ""filler"" in DBZ was because the Anime and Manga were pretty much on top of each other the whole run.  This is why the Frieza fight was so long.  They couldn't end the fight in the Anime before they ended the fight in the manga."
weeabootales,3ddee7,loreminouche,3,Thu Jul 16 10:47:20 2015 UTC,"DBZ basically set the precedent of making filler episodes so that the source material could catch up. Other shounen series like bleach and naruto followed that model, although not as successfully as DBZ considering that it's probably the first time people saw filler episodes in a long running series.   When naruto did it, watchers in general hated it, and so shippuden was made.  The more sensible alternative is to stop the series for about a year or so so that the source material could catch up, as what fairy tail did. Of course the risk of the hype dying or the fans not watching it when it returns on air is high, but if the series is good enough there's no reason for fans not to continue watching it."

weeabootales,3d022s,librettomusicale,67,Sun Jul 12 09:54:59 2015 UTC,"She's a gaijin, she will always be a gaijin. Any life for her in Japan would be as a gaijin and it would never be like a home country to her.  At 18 the door to being an idol has already almost shut. Does she have a youtube with a decent following? No? Then there's absolutely no way she can become an idol in Japan, it's 100% impossible. Wanting to be an idol at 18 without having put in any serious work yet is like not having put in serious academic work yet and expecting a full ride scholarship. It's just too late.  Anime is great for escapism, but you have to come back to reality when it's over. There's this notion because anime is just a ""better"" version of reality, life in japan is just a ""better"" version of life in the US. It's just not true. Aside from being able to soak in the Japanese culture, pretty much everything is worse for a foreigner there than their home country. If she wants to live there, she should shift her expectations from ""I'll go to Japan and everything in my life will fix itself,"" because that can only disappoint her.  Being a bad artist who thinks they're ""pretty good"" is hard to fix. It involves hundreds of hours of hard work drawing NO anime (which is all she wants to do) while you work on fundamentals. There's no way for you to make her realize she's bad with enough confidence to want to put in this kind of work. That has to come from inside, I think.  Basically, I think you need to either try to break her delusions (which she'll probably hate you for) or help her get to a step where they will be broken for her. If she actually moves to Japan, she'll realize that it won't fix her life pretty quickly. The most damaging thing to her would probably be keeping her goals close-but-so-far-away for 5+ years, leaving it to her mid to late twenties before she realizes she's squandered the skill-building period of her life on pipe dreams.  edit: Maybe one thing you can do is suggest she try to get a pen pal in Japan. Like, actually find the site and explain it to her and then bug her about doing it. That'll probably make her happy, but also let her hear straight from the horses mouth how things will be when she gets there."
weeabootales,3d022s,Hairy_S_TrueMan,3,Sun Jul 12 11:17:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for such an elaborate response. Yeah, last time she also told me that she's starting to realize that it's too late. So, you're sure that there's NO way she'll manage to do so? I really need to tell it to her then... About the anime part, I know it and I totally agree - dunno if she realizes that or not though, she seems to be at least a bit more knowledgeable in the matter (actual life in Japan) than most other weebs I know, but still. I'll try to talk to her about putting effort into non-weeby work too, anyway, and I'll let you know about the outcomes. The pen-pal part sounds good too."
weeabootales,3d022s,Hairy_S_TrueMan,2,Wed Jul 15 15:23:10 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I can honestly say there's no way she could become an idol, but I think from the fact that you never came out and said ""She IS really pretty and a talented singer and dancer..."" it is 100% impossible. Assuming she is all those things, she COULD compete with countless other hopefuls for just a few spots as a foreign idol, when they probably had a head start by starting at 16 or younger. It just doesn't seem like a winning game plan.  EDIT: oh god I just read she's 20. If she hasn't even started ANYTHING on the idol front then you need to bring her down to earth on this. Idols are a consumable product in Japan. Even if she DID get really lucky and get a big break 2 years from now, she'd already be near the end of her idol lifetime..."

weeabootales,3cuonx,DuelistDeCoolest,86,Sat Jul 11 03:39:52 2015 UTC,"Most of the sane ones are smart enough to stay away from the rest of the fandom so the crazy ones get the most attention.   They assume they are history experts just because they read the manga. When the earthquake/tsunami/radiation crisis happened in Japan, everyone was freaking out and hoping the personification was okay. Little mention of the people who actually live there.   Lots of people desecrating flags and doing other offensive things. A group once did a seig heil photoshoot near a holocaust museum.   I've seen a ton of hate towards female nations for ""cockblocking"" whatever yaoi pair. Cockblocking=existing apparently.   Porn of every character. Even the ones that are clearly minors. ""Omg he's like 70, he only LOOKS like he's 12 so its okay!!!111""   There's a softcore fancomic of Ronald McDonald x America x Colonel Sanders. Dead serious. They also tend to act crazy at conventions. My local con banned yaoi paddles because a bunch of people brought them in and were smacking hetalia cosplayers. I once cosplayed as female South Italy and I had a Spain cosplayer harass me until the con staff kicked her out.    Ever since it became an anime the fandom has gotten horrible. I really hope the author never finds out about this stuff."
weeabootales,3cuonx,IHasDaRabies,33,Sat Jul 11 06:01:25 2015 UTC,"Just to add two things to your list:   One Cosplayer recently thought that it was okay to cosplay the character Germany in a fully blown SS uniform. Source  One of the translators at hetascanlations (a blog where people translate and post everything related to hetalia) got so much hatemail from so called ""USUK"" fangirls that she had to take the post down. The post in question described the relationship between the Characters UK and USA as ""brothers"".Source   So yeah, I still actually adore the manga, but I hate most of the fanbase.

weeabootales,3csri7,vyhox,17,Fri Jul 10 19:19:49 2015 UTC,It's fun to do something for pure enjoyment without caring whether it's good or not. Maybe supposed to be bad is a poor way to phrase it. A more accurate explanation might be just that it isn't supposed to be good. It sounds similar but there's a difference. It's just a group of kids enjoying themselves by being goofy and not giving a shit.

Typing ""ni"" gets you „Å´. Typing ""mo"" gets you „ÇÇ. If you're typing in actual japanese spelled (mostly) as it would be romanized (rendered in our alphabet) the system works, and can even give you the more complex characters (Kanji). For example, if you typed ""sake"" you could select ÈÖí, a character/word meaning liquor.  If you're silly enough to type english into the IME, you get junk. It would be like œÑœÖœÄŒπŒΩŒ≥ ŒµŒΩŒ≥ŒªŒπœÉŒ∑ ŒøŒΩ Œ± Œ≥œÅŒµŒµŒ∫ Œ∫ŒµœÖŒ≤ŒøŒ±œÅŒ¥ Œ±ŒΩŒ¥ œÑŒ∑ŒπŒΩŒ∫ŒπŒΩŒ≥ œÖŒøŒ∏'œÅŒµ œÉœÄŒµŒ±Œ∫ŒπŒΩŒ≥ Œ≥œÅŒµŒµŒ∫.  typing English on a greek keyboard and thinking you're speaking greek"

weeabootales,3cgsr0,RobinLSL,4,Thu Jul 9 09:49:32 2015 UTC,"Interestingly enough, I could give you an answer without even referring to the game itself. Simply put, it's a PvP game. As such, there is no innate difficulty in the game itself, the only thing which matters is you outperforming your opponents. Then, literally, the challenge of being in, say, the top 1% of players worldwide is consistently outperforming the 99% other people. Unless you're willing to argue that being good is mostly luck, this argument works for every single PvP game, video or not video.    Discounting the ""general PvP"" aspect, I'd also argue that LoL is challenging. In no particular order, getting your last hits on creeps (under pressure, or under your turret, or while pushing as hard as possible at the same time), executing combos on combo champs, kiting forward or backwards as a marksman are purely mechanical things which aren't always easy and are satisfying when performed well. Then there's reading the map and game flow, what can you do an when, can you safely push/dive/invade/go deep ward/take an objective, changing your playstyle and builds because of awkward team compositions or strange game flow. And reading your opponent, dodging skillshots, guessing where they want to ambush you, knowing your windows of opportunity to fight because of their cooldowns, using your skills to their utmost effect, knowing what to do in a teamfight. And creep wave management.  All these things are skills that you have to learn, and properly execute, and this makes LoL quite the deep, and yes, challenging game. And best of all, while the 5v5 aspect does have some problems, it also allows you to pick roles where you can focus on some aspects but not all. You like winning the game through vision control and reading the map? Pick Nunu in the jungle or Bard as a support. You like killing people with flashy combos? Pick Leblanc midlane or Rengar in the jungle. You want to prevent people from doing that and be a bodyguard? Pick Nautilus or Cho'gath."
weeabootales,3cgsr0,xy3_,-2,Thu Jul 9 11:12:52 2015 UTC,"interestingly enough, I could give you an answer without even referring to the game itself. simply put, it's a PvP game. as such, there is no innate difficulty in the game itself, the only thing which matters is you outperforming your opponents with free non time-consuming to get gameplay elements (champions, runes and masteries). then, the challenge of being in, say, the top 1% of players worldwide is consistently outperforming the 99% other people with all bought non time-consuming to get gameplay elements (champions, runes and masteries), taking something about 5-6 years without money?  and no, it's not free2play because time is a valuable resource. it's pretty much if you played chess and you only started with one pawn and no bishops; the more you play, the more you gain Chess PointsTM that allow you to gain bishops, up to two (for chess points or for money) and pawns (only with chess points) but hey! it's not pay2win because pawns aren't buyable with real money! they're just gameplay enchancers!  replace pawns with runes and bishops with champions and you've got the state of the system.   last hitting   it's a skillful mechanic, can't say anything   executing combos   l m a o, because pressing the same keys in a different situation to have synergies and combos is so fun! let's take a random champion; what are you going to do most of the time? E > Q. it's the same thing for about 90% of champions; 'combos', if they serve no purpose other than dealing more damage or giving more utility than you wouldn't have otherwhise, just become 'a cool way to deal damage' and the game becomes a number game where everyone carries ""items"" (stat sticks) to see who can execute their damage faster.   kiting forward or backwards as a marksman are purely mechanical things which aren't always easy and are satisfying when performed well   keyword: mechanical. it's cool to be mechanical, now where is my strategy?   then there's reading the map and game flow, what can you do an when, can you safely push/dive/invade/go deep ward/take an objective,   same as lasthitting, although there isn't much to do on that part: the lanes are so small you place 2 wards tops in laning and go back to lasthitting for the first 10-25 minutes of the game. fun!  and on actual warding, everyone has wards raining from the sky so vision isn't hard.   And reading your opponent, dodging skillshots, guessing where they want to ambush you, knowing your windows of opportunity to fight because of their cooldowns, using your skills to their utmost effect,   reading your opponent is okay because it's a PvP game, but the rest is bullshit. with 'skillshots' costing close to nothing to do and no risk needed to do them, if we take midlane for example, it's a dancing game where everyone dodges their 4 second spamshots and go back to lasthitting. strategic depth!   And creep wave management.   this is lasthitting uhhhhhhhhhhh   All these things are skills that you have to learn, and properly execute   so about 2 strategic skills and the rest are mechanical micro-management that makes you feel you are better at the game? in that case, go play Smash, Street Fighters or some other high-skillcap mechanical game with actual strategy.  the real gameplay that happens most of the time:   lasthit for 10 to 15 minutes and stay in your lane, sometimes get ganked (o no!) but it's okay because you can flash right back to safety, dying is antifun remember everyone starts buying stat sticks ""items"" and deal more damage, and now the game starts dancing around objectives 35 minutes in, teamfight, who has lasthitted the most and got the better stat sticks? remember to aim all your spamshots and AoE damage skills otherwhise you lose the game ends   and it's even more fun when you are limited to a role! do you want to play like you are supposed to? play leblanc and do your three combos really well, and deal your damage to the backline! do you want to limit damage? pick nautilus and make the damage do less damage!  i can't really see how strategic that is; if the game revolves purely around your mechanical skill to lasthit, there is no strategy left. roaming is dead, hell ganking is dead and you have a baby's game of sitting in your lane and doing close to nothing."

Literally everything you wrote is you putting your own personal negative spin on things. No, laning is not just last hitting (unless both you and your opponent want it to be). No, managing a creep wave is also not just last hitting (unless you want to lose your tower). No, skillshots do not have ""no cost"", missing one is costly and provides a window of opportunity for your opponent to completely change the lane dynamic. Roaming isn't dead, ganking is not even close to dead, trinket wards really aren't much, and no one ever buys green wards. Teamfights really, really aren't just about who has more money but are much more about whether one team managed to engage properly, and that engage itself results of the interaction between squishy positioning, bodyguard protecting and zoning, and of course the engagers.  Also don't refute my ""combos"" argument by picking a champion who barely counts as a combo champion. That's meh. And even then, Jarvan can go E Q Flash (surprise long range knockup, sacrifices damage), Flash E Q (more predictable, doesn't sacrifice damage), and with R, Flash E Q R or E Q Flash R depending on whether he is more interested in landing the flag inside the enemy team or closer to his. All of these are meaningful split-second tactical choices. Then you get Leblanc with many, many useful combinations of Q W E R and Flash exist.  I'll say it again: it really looks like you want to dislike the game. You win the game by destroying buildings, not last-hitting creeps."

Anime and games are fine in moderation, but if he's isolating himself from everyone and living his life as a shut-in then there's definitely something wrong.  When I was severely depressed, I would watch anime every single day. I didn't even like it that much, but I would watch it so I could get away from my stressful family life. I no longer watch anime, but the social isolation I put myself through caused me to develop agoraphobia (basically a fear of leaving my house) and a number of other illnesses.  You should try to get your cousin some help. The longer he isolates himself, the harder it's going to be for him to get better. Social isolation can lead to many mental and physical illnesses developing, so I would really talk to him about this and get him some help before it gets any worse.

weeabootales,3bxogx,Yamagatari,7,Fri Jul 3 10:40:49 2015 UTC,"(I have a psychology degree and a lot of caffeine in my system so bear with me for this stream of consciousness)  My brother had a major depressive episode in high school, attempted suicide, and dropped out for a year. He pretty much just played WoW for that year. All he did was game and sleep, only emerging from his room for food but often very late at night, so I'd go days at a time without seeing him in the same house. He kinda snapped out of it at some point, tbh I'm not exactly sure what happened, he's really private and I was dealing with my own shit at the time as well. My sister was also a WoW addict for a while when she was depressed; we grew up in an abusive household so we were all drawn to escapist behavior. I also had another friend in college who actually had an intervention from family/friends for her WoW addiction because she was so shut in and taking poor care of herself. Turns she had Lyme disease and didn't realize it, so she may have been trying to escape the symptoms that she didn't understand. Unfortunately, much like drugs and alcohol as you pointed out, this behavior is not productive and in fact often keeps people in a cycle of depression, because social isolation, not going outdoors, too much TV or computer time, lack of exercise, poor sleep patterns, and poor diet are all terrible for depression, and all of these things often coincide with addictions such as WoW or anime.  Pardon my speculation but this kind of behavior seems to often follow either a traumatic event, a more insidious progression of depression/anxiety, or the emergence of agoraphobia, germaphobia, or another phobia/OCD expressed through isolation. Do you know if he has a history with any of these areas? If you're aware of some traumatic event (which can obviously be a more extreme situation such as abuse, but it can also be rejection from college, being cheated on, or other seemingly ""normal"" events that can be much more significant for someone with underlying mental issues), that may be the root of the behavior. Phobias can emerge from traumatic events as well as the insidious progression of depression/anxiety/OCD. OCD can develop at later ages so this is also a possibility, and OCD is often associated with a great deal of shame so it may be no one really knows. It sounds to me like this is a depression/anxiety issue though.  A bell that also went off in my head was the phenomenon among certain people who do well in high school (academically, socially, whatever) where, if they have a perfectionist attitude (which often accompanies depression/anxiety), they become consumed with fear that high school was their ""peak"" and retreat due to fear of failure or being overwhelmed with the need for perfection and trying to minimize their lives to things they can control. But if he's several years out of high school and this behavior only started recently, it's probably a more recent event, if it is in fact an event like that.  In any case, therapy would obviously be a good choice, but you only get out of therapy what you put in, so if he's not in a place where he will put effort into it then it's not terribly useful (plus expensive, though there are affordable counseling programs out there in grad schools or charitable organizations). He may need time to kinda ""snap"" out of it - both my siblings sort of came around on their own. An intervention is also an option, it worked for my college friend in terms of making her see the negative effects of her behavior, and now she channels that escapist energy into LARP which is much better since she socializes and gets outside and such, so that may be something to suggest to your friends or family. On a similar note finding anime-based activities (IRL preferably, internet is not really the same) with more social elements might be a good way for him to transition out of isolation. I'm not sure if any of your friends have tried to have some ""real talk"" with him or if he just kinda shuts down when asked about this behavior, but you might give that a shot. One-on-one can be better than an intervention because it's less overwhelming, though interventions are useful for making a big display of concern that can open someone's eyes. Since you've been out of touch it might be weird to be like ""hey long time no see, so i herd u liek self destructing,"" so I guess try to reach out and start slow, but eventually expressing your concern and giving him an opportunity to talk if he wants to about whatever he's going through may be helpful. Sometimes people with depression don't think anyone cares about what they're going through, or don't want to be a burden, or minimize their issues due to the crushingly low self esteem that accompanies depression, so actually trying to pry a little can sometimes be needed but if you open the floodgates it can be a real release and maybe instigate some introspection.  Unfortunately, depression is a real son of a bitch. I feel that it is one of the worst mental illnesses out there - it's so pervasive, insidious, poorly understood, and operates in a defeatist cycle (requires intention and great force of will to break the cycle, but it inherently undercuts these things fffffff). There honestly isn't all that much you can do. I don't have depression personally but having seen so many loved ones go through it, it breaks my heart feeling so helpless to ease their pain. Best of luck, I hope some part of my rambling helps you."
weeabootales,3bxogx,j76dhskljf,3,Fri Jul 3 11:58:59 2015 UTC,":( my apology for stealing your reply to OP but can i ask for an advice from you?  unfortunately i am having that kind of symptoms that OP's cousin has. I have a part-time job as accountant. Due to family problem that ever since secondary school, i have always had problems with opening up to any kind of relationship (afraid to be abandoned etc). My academic performance was pretty good and now i only ends up as a part-time accountant. During my puberty and even now, i have been hooked up with anime (esp Evangelion with all of the mental-broken characters), game in a more-than-just-a-hobby behaviour   Due to the stress and pressure from work, i am also hooked up with mint candy (I can't stand caffeine so it's kinda a substitute). Now it's like i have no interest in interaction with people, just want to talk to those having common interest in anime,game like me and don't have any intention to be in any romantic relationship between. Am i a Weeb? Would therapy treatment be a life-saving drug for my miserable life?"
weeabootales,3bxogx,j76dhskljf,4,Sat Jul 4 16:08:53 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear you're not in a good place! Therapy would probably be helpful, try looking into affordable counseling programs. I know there are also online therapy services that are pretty affordable.  It sounds like you've been relying on anime for a kind of emotional support that you lacked from your family and for escapism from disappointment that you could not control the outcomes of life (working hard in school, unfortunately, doesn't always mean getting the job you want, because there are always forces at work beyond your control). As a response you minimize your life to things you can control as a means to soothe anxiety and use escapism to avoid depression that can accompany the self-defeating cycle of perfectionism (assumption that you can control everything makes you punish yourself when you can't control everything). Unfortunately these things don't address the underlying issues - being at peace with not being in control and loving and accepting yourself no matter what.  A good approach to dealing with depression and compulsive escapism is to challenge yourself to move past a negative behavior in a small way. For example make a goal to spend a little time outdoors in an activity unrelated to anime (it doesn't have to be a group activity - like going to the park and listening to music, journaling, drawing, etc). Spending time outside regularly has been shown to increase happiness. Or make a goal to reach out to a friend you feel you're losing touch with, even just send a greeting card if you're anxious about having to commit to a conversation. Meaningful, supportive relationships help with depression but are often one of the first things to go when you're depressed and retreat into yourself. The idea here is to push yourself to do positive things without pushing so hard that you freak out and shut down - only make goals that you feel are realistic. Then over time as you feel comfortable, try pushing a little more. I would start with trying to initiate positive behavior rather than limiting negative behavior, but eventually you could try something like no anime before 6pm, or only a certain number of hours per day, whatever works for you. Obviously you don't need to ""quit"" anime unless you feel that's the only way to balance your life, just rein it in to a healthy amount. Having a counselor during this process is really helpful but not entirely necessary - just don't give yourself a mental breakdown on my advice!!  Keep in mind that you can't always control the outcomes of your goals. Maybe you try to rekindle a friendship but it doesn't work out. That's okay because you still tried and that was probably really hard, and you're a stronger person for making the effort! Be proud of your efforts for their own sake even if things don't go as you'd hoped or planned. Perfectionism likes to catastrophize stumbles along the road - if it doesn't go perfectly all the time why even bother, but you can probably see that this is a fallacious idea. Remember, you can't control everything, it's not your fault if things don't go as you'd hoped, and love and accept yourself no matter what even if you've made mistakes!! Good luck, I hope I've helped in some way!"

When my mind decided it wanted to fuck with me I had to distance myself from somethings fast or be swallowed by them. WoW, pc games, ps2, anime, and everything else had to be put away or I would not interact with anyone.   Hell I have to be really careful even now while on medication to no slip back into some of my worse symptoms of depression. (I should be sleeping but having a manic episode sooooo no sleep for me. Which I know better being online just makes it worse.)  What I am getting at is he needs help and he needs it fast. The longer he keeps himself isolated from the world the harder it will be to get him out.   I saw that first hand with my brother, minus he anime though. Its been a long time and he is still recovering, I see him have to force himself to go out with a friend. He and I both know if we don't we go back to being shut-ins which just makes out mental states take a noise dive.  Do you think you can talk to his parents, he needs help. Even if you have to send a anonymous letter to them it might help."

weeabootales,3bxogx,Reeeeeen,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:58:19 2015 UTC,"Addiction was one reason I am glad I was not put on it. Did not help that my first doctor really did not believe me. Ended up getting the best psychologist at my school for free. She was fantastic and better then the one I had through my health insurance.  Then my next doctor ended up being great and put me back on it as I was off it for a few years. Luckily with my new insurance I only pay $10.  I have been toying with the idea of joining the military as I do like having clear orders. Thought of the peace corps but I am not sure I would get enough money for my bills. But I don't know how I would keep my dog as she is practically my emotional support dog even though she is a jerk. (keeps me up during any time it rains)  Starbucks offers health insurance for part timers as long as you do 20 hours a week. Surpisingly it has been my hardest job I ever had, which caused me to have a mental break down, and I have taught abroad! (I'm a great teacher, no degree, though I am not a big fan of kids) If you have a costco around you I think they do the same and the pay is WAY better then you will get from Starbucks. (Then again this is the US and no clue where you are)  As much as I don't want to keep going I WILL NOT do that to my mom. I love her more then anything. Hoping I will be able to drag myself out of depression before she passes away.  I wish you the best and hope you can find something soon. No clue your age, I'm 27, but jobs here are scarce and its not that uncommon around here to still be working retail.

It's all about common sense and any small amount of social skill or self-awareness. Like whatever you want, move to Japan, spend all of your money on Japanese media, but if you don't act cringy and especially if you have friends and other interests, I don't feel like the term is really deserved."
weeabootales,3bymsk,Ralon17,11,Fri Jul 3 06:54:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  To add to this, people who behave in such a way as to patronize or appropriate a culture seem to be lacking an awareness of social norms and boundaries.  Most of the time, they don't seem to realize how they appear and that their behavior is uncomfortable and embarrassing.  I suppose that makes them delusional in a way.  I know a few people who are like this toward Indian culture and their behavior makes everyone uncomfortable."

In my opinion, weeaboos are the type of people who like Japan SO much they lose interest in their own culture, and basically want to be considered Japanese, while actually even insulting the Japanese culture with the way they behave. At the same time, they cause people around them to facepalm and feel awkward about them... So, example of a weeaboo (by my understanding): A girl who ends her English sentences with ""desu"" , speak in high pitched anime voice, add -kun, -senpai to people's names and wear Japanese schoolgirl uniform at times other than for cosplay. Her absolute and favorite snack is Pocky and cup ramen, and she constantly squeals""kawaiiiii"" ! Lol"

If you watch all sorts of anime/jdrama/whatever and can blend into everyday society, I'd say you're good.  Story time.  I once went to dinner with a coworker and employer at a sushi place. The restaurant was owned by Koreans and the sushi chef was Latino. The coworker absolutely had to over-pronounce every item he ordered.  He would bow and thank the chef in the same over-pronounced Japanese whenever he was handed his order.   Top it all off, he used his hands to eat his nigiri while telling us that it was the proper way to do so: with two fingers (even though he used three).   A normal person would just use chopsticks and eat the damn sushi.  Which one are you?"

As it stands though the point I'm making is that while you can call me (and OP) a japanophile I don't think a weeaboo would be the right word.  edit: To add a little colour to my previous comment (it was intentionally a little skewed - everything I said was true, but not the whole truth):   Anime backgrounds on my laptop and desktop... but during daytime hours they're automatically replaced by much more low-key backgrounds. I go to almost every anime-soc event... lots of my friends do. I was brought there last year and I thought it was a good excuse to actually socialize as well as watch anime. Since I started going I've watched much less anime at home for obvious reasons (I watch it at home about once a month now, give or take). I say 400GB of music but most of it was from the same pack which was absolutely gigantic and I still haven't listened to a tenth of it yet. I don't want to imagine the kind of dedication it would take to curate all that from scratch. I took my parents to a Japanese restaurant, but to be fair they suggested going to wagamama and I said I knew a better one and brought them there. (Besides, they've been to wagamama in other towns, and I'm not a fan of the food there) Anime conventions - it's true, I've been to several. I didn't end up doing much though. I usually go because everyone else is (i.e. I didn't go this year because only one of my friends was), and I usually end up with a beer, some snacks, and maybe some old videogames. It'd be a cold day in hell before you catch me eyeing up the katanas or something like that."

weeabootales,3bquke,thetarget3,18,Wed Jul 1 13:38:45 2015 UTC,"So when I was 16 I shared a 2 bedroom flat with three other people. Two of those people were in this weird on again off again thing that resulted in a lot of awkward tension in the flat.   One wednesday night (Way too early in the night to be this drunk) they were yelling at each other and drinking and just making a lot of bad life choices.   My other flatmate came into my room and said:    I'm sick of those two's shit, want to come get drunk and sing shitty karaoke and some dead bar.    So we go to a bar that is usually dead because it's a more quiet ""I just want to sit here and drink"" bar across the street from a louder dancey type gay bar. (I don't know how to discribe bars)  What we didn't realize is that this bar get's really creepy in the early evening. The only people there are a few women who we later discover were recruiters from a strip club, some guys perving on those recruiters and Maya and Jackie sitting in the corner totally ignoring the rest of the bar. My flatmate buys me a drink and we go over to the small 'dance floor' (It was just little open space.)   As we're dancing this guy who was previously perving on the 'recruiters' was now trying to grind on my flatmate and cut me out of the dance. My flatmate responds by pretending I'm her girlfriend. This does not deter the creep and he continues to ignore me. At this point we are standing by the bar and I am actually trying to push him off my flatmate and she is telling him to fuck off.   Then Maya walks over to the bar and points out ""You might want to control your patrons"" and the guy gets kicked out. Why didn't this happen sooner? Because the bar is a shithole and none of the staff care until you complain. So while Maya is ordering her drinks my flatmate just can't keep her mouth shut and goes up to Maya to tell her ""You and your girlfriend make a very cute couple.""   She told her that Jackie was her wife but thanked her and offered to buy us a round. We wind up hanging out in the corner with them and getting into a few interesting conversations and we all get along well. At some point I tell Maya I want to be a doctor and she asks if I'm in any shadowing programs. (Follow a doctor around and ask stupid questions) I didn't even know they had one at the local hospital. Jackie makes a snide comment about how half the time doctors hand the kids in these programs over to nurses because of how anti social doctors are.   So after that Maya gave me her number and said she could call her if I wanted to shadow a doctor for a day. I took her up on that offer and after that she became a bit of a mentor to me. If anyone's wondering why Maya has such a soft spot for lost little teens she wasn't much older than me when she wound up on her own so she can get pretty protective but I have a tremendous amount of respect for the woman."

When I was stationed in Japan when I was learning what I called ""drunken japanese""(original I know; basically shit I could say to cab drivers to get my ass home or back to base when i was wasted). One of the first things my friends taught me was ""YOU DON'T SAY THE U AT THE END OF DESU""...I can still hear them yelling at me. Funny thing is since I learned at lot of my Japanese from girls, the guys I hung out with said my accent was ""cute""...or they might have been gay I dunno.

It was a lot of snot though. All over my shoulder."
weeabootales,3bdi2p,Cevolian,7,Sun Jun 28 10:17:09 2015 UTC,"Her father is only enabling this it seems.  I had a ""my race is best race"" phase once- when I was in 4th grade.  Sadly she'll never learn to get over herself as long as there are fanboys. If it ever hits her that she's got nothing special about her except whapanese/weeabonese? mysticism, it'll come like a brick wall and she might reach her final form of becoming a hikikomori/neet.    Also the best sushi I've had was either made by Koreans or Hispanics.  Japanese made sushi at overpriced (imo) restaurants were no better or worse.  Too bad there aren't any pics so we could all see just how bad she is."

weeabootales,3bdi2p,Cevolian,5,Sat Jul 4 16:57:55 2015 UTC,"Odd you'd word it like that. You're implying that I was a racist in 4th grade.  That's a pretty strong accusation when kids that age don't even know what racism is- yes, I didn't. I was merely prideful of my ethnicity if you want to be specific.  I didn't look down on others.

weeabootales,3bbfbj,lifeofthe6,44,Sat Jun 27 16:46:48 2015 UTC,I've been to a couple cons with hentai screenings. Mostly people make fun of the ridiculousness in many hentai and there are a few couples there to get (terrible) ideas to use for themselves later.  No whackin' it or schlicking allowed.
weeabootales,3bbfbj,xthorgoldx,34,Sat Jun 27 19:01:16 2015 UTC,"Yep. I went to one at AX last year because it was late, I was bored, and I had an hour to kill before my ride showed up; ended up having a great time of hilarity. It's pretty much 18+ Rifftracks."
weeabootales,3bbfbj,0takuSharkGuy,23,Sat Jun 27 19:27:02 2015 UTC,"We had one at both Ikkicon in Austin and Ushicon in Round Rock. The one at Ikkicon was great because they would show some terrible hentai (room is 18+ and late at night) and then people were selected to come up and role-play as a character on screen and ad-lib lines. I joined in where I got to voice a guy in a threesome with his mother and sister. The sister was played by another dude but the mother was played by some drunk-as-hell asian guy who made us all loose our shit with making suckin noises and the whole lot.  Later we had a spot-on Mach Man Randy Savage cosplayer get up and dominate the show.  The one at Ushicon though was more of just riffing and fun. The guys who screen it purposfuly pick out the bad and obscure ones and they also find ones where famous voice actors voice characters (I think Yugi's VA is in one and so is Ash from Pokemon, but I may be wrong on the exact details)."

I suggest you tell the exchange students beforehand that the school is filled with ""otaku"" or weeaboos so that they know what they are getting involved with. If worst comes to worst, you might need to stoop to their level and assert your dominance by bringing onions to school and telling the weebs that ""This is my swamp""  In all sincerity, you should probably tell them that if they harass the students they will be expelled or something.

weeabootales,3b858j,LookACastle,19,Fri Jun 26 20:12:39 2015 UTC,"They might be using mobile. When you type an ""L"" into a mobile keyboard, it makes the following vowel into a tiny kana. It might even be that way for some of the Japanese keyboard things you can download, but I know I have that problem in particular while on mobile."

weeabootales,3b858j,LookACastle,24,Fri Jun 26 20:17:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's supposed to say ""Follow for follow"". The person who wrote it is probably ignorant and thinks that Hiragana works similarly to the Roman alphabet, and is using Hiragana to show off."
weeabootales,3b858j,Vadrone,24,Fri Jun 26 20:19:43 2015 UTC,Yup. Actual japanglish would probably be more like „Éï„Ç©„É≠„Éï„Ç©„Éº„Éï„Ç©„É≠ (literally 'foro foo foro'. Might only make sense if you try to speak english with a japanese accent.)
weeabootales,3b858j,M3_Drifter,8,Fri Jun 26 21:58:13 2015 UTC,So he tried writing English words in Hiragana...? And even did that wrong?
weeabootales,3b858j,kakepop,14,Sat Jun 27 05:59:38 2015 UTC,Yes. Hiragana instead of katakana and then a total lack of understanding of how they write foreign words. I totally didn't get it until the comment from /u/Vadrone.  I think one of the hardest parts about japanese is reading something in katakana and trying to imagine what the english word is supposed to be.
weeabootales,3b858j,M3_Drifter,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:21:19 2015 UTC,"Right, thanks for clearing it up for me. That's interesting, though, I've never known anything about katakana other than its supposedly ""hiragana for English words"", what exactly does that mean (if you don't mind me asking)?"
weeabootales,3b858j,kakepop,3,Sat Jun 27 16:47:58 2015 UTC,"In japan, the roman alphabet is rarely used and Japanese people are generally fairly bad at reading words made with roman letters. You will mostly see them on signs, clothes, or for abbreviations like FAQ, PV or CM.   So... Katakana is used for all non-japanese words. Meaning any word in english, french, or whatever, all loan words, and all made-up words, like media or business names (NTT Docomo => NTT „Éâ„Ç≥„É¢).  But remember that hiragana and katakana characters make specific sounds. When you take a foreign word and write it with katakana, you write down the sounds, which can oftentimes be completely different from the actual letters used to write it in english. To make it more difficult, the sound is usually japanized somewhat, and some of the loan-words are shortened or otherwise slightly altered.  For a few random examples, sarariiman („Çµ„É©„É™„Éº„Éû„É≥) is salaryman (male office worker), konbini („Ç≥„É≥„Éì„Éã) is convenience store, kuriimu („ÇØ„É™„Éº„É†) is cream, piero („Éî„Ç®„É≠) is clown, doraibaa („Éâ„É©„Ç§„Éê„Éº) is screwdriver. So almost a language unto itself.  Sometimes even japanese words are written in katakana for whatever reason, such as the tuna thing I found in 7-11 that said „Éû„Ç∞„É≠ (maguro). I was told it was because the fish was caught outside japan."
weeabootales,3b858j,M3_Drifter,4,Sat Jun 27 18:06:15 2015 UTC,"„Éî„Ç®„É≠ is from the French ""Pierrot"" so, that's why it doesn't sound like anything.    Sometimes even Japanese words are written in katakana for whatever reason, such as the tuna thing I found in 7-11 that said „Éû„Ç∞„É≠ (maguro). I was told it was because the fish was caught outside japan.   Also, that answer...whoever told you that is either lying or, well I wouldn't trust them. Animal words are typically written in Katakana. The convention for writing animal names in Katakana came from this being the way they were always written in scientific words, and also they can often contain a number of complicated non-standard Kanji. In this case, ÈÆ™ is not even on the Joyo list. So you'll see this with most animals."
weeabootales,3b858j,Pennwisedom,2,Sun Jun 28 13:54:31 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, okay thank you! Does katakana have sounds that aren't included in hiragana then? Or is it just used to make a distinction between Japanese words and non-Japanese words? (Sorry for asking so many questions!)"
weeabootales,3b858j,kakepop,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:50:54 2015 UTC,"I think one of the hardest parts about japanese is reading something in katakana and trying to imagine what the english word is supposed to be.   I don't know if the words are, just their meaning sometimes. Like „Ç≠„É£„ÉÉ„ÉÅ„Ç≥„Éî„Éº, or when they're not actually loaned from English like   „Éë„É≥ or „Ç¢„É´„Éê„Ç§„Éà."
weeabootales,3b858j,Pennwisedom,2,Sun Jun 28 13:49:21 2015 UTC,Basically.   I was trying to read it and I could barely get Follow for Follow. I only got it when I tried saying it a very very very stereotypical japanese/asian accent.
weeabootales,3b858j,TranClan67,7,Sat Jun 27 08:29:59 2015 UTC,"Ahh, that makes sense is vaguely understandable if you think hard enough.   Ninja edit: spelling"
weeabootales,3b858j,LookACastle,2,Fri Jun 26 20:23:30 2015 UTC,To make a v sound you take wa (katakana) and add the dashes to it then you can manipulate it further for more sounds. (I have no japanese keyboard.)
weeabootales,3b858j,Stormageddon50,3,Sat Jun 27 03:06:21 2015 UTC,"No, you use a „ÅÜ with a dakuten, like so: „Çî. It is always done in katakana though, so mor like „É¥. You can't even use dakuten with a „Çè."

If you feel too hot, cool down in the shade or in a cooler area. Make sure you get at least 4 hours of sleep, shower before and after getting out of cosplay, make sure you wear deodorant, and make sure you eat at least twice a day. If you want to buy prints, wait until the final day.  most artists lower the prices so they can get rid of the last of their stuff. Get photos of cosplays you like.

You'll be happier and so will everyone around you Have something to do while waiting in lines, because you will be waiting in lines. 3DS is awesome at Cons just because all the street passes. Get some decent food, you leave the food truck area and convention area to go to some real restaurants. Especially great if you haven't been in the area yet. Make sure to set boundaries. Other people may try to approach you in ways that make you feel uncomfortable because since you are cosplaying they think this ""suddenly"" gives them open access to you (this goes 1000 times if you are a girl). Generally most people at the con will be respectful, but don't let any psycho push you around and remember that there is usually security at a con for a reason. Spend your money wisely. A couple things about buying things at cons   Remeber that there will be some stuff at cons that will be nigh impossible to find anywhere else. Go for that stuff instead of the stuff you can easily buy online A lot of cons on the last day will have big sales. Wait for those. Check multiple booths, some places might have cheaper stuff than others Don't forget the Artist Alley!  Give yourself some sort of agenda. Not a rigid one, but giving a general schedule of stuff you wanna do makes things less overwhelming, especially if you go to a big con like Anime Expo or Otakon.  People will smell bad. If you have a sensitive nose, be warned. You may wanna only cosplay for 1 day of the con, 2 days if it's a 3 day con. It will give you a day to just walk around normally without having to deal with photo ops. Drink lots of water, even more so if your cosplay is heavy. Most of all, have fun! Cons are a unique experience, no matter how big or small. Enjoy the sights and sounds, and good luck!"

Also I didn't ask you for our host sister's email, I asked you if she ever replied back to you. And two is that did you actually share these stories with our host sister? I guess I wouldn't know because there were many points in the stories where you took a few ""liberties"" as to what happened.  Anyway, they were funny. I'm glad you love me so much to spend all this time writing about me! Check out my YouTube channel guys: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFc5i58c8zgqe-PyL3UczZg  See ya in August - GFZ"

Generally, whatever spectacular skill a savant has is offset by severe developmental delay. These people need caretakers and are usually incapable of functioning in society without assistance. It's highly unlikely this guy was a savant.  As for Asperger's, maybe. It may sound a little cruel, but sometimes you'll meet people that are simply so bad at social interaction that they come off as maybe having a disorder like Asperger's, but there really isn't anything wrong with them. That is how I imagine a lot of people get into situations like the weeb in your OP: they start off a little socially inept, don't have friends or get bullied a lot, and compensate by burying themselves deeper into their hobbies until they become an unhealthy obsession. I saw plenty of it in high school; you didn't really get bullied for liking anime (a lot of the popular kids liked it), you got bullied for being obsessed with it."

Besides, it's not like the US helped out of the kindness of their hearts. The rebuilding was to get the economy back up and running so that a) the Japanese wouldn't have the same attitudes the Germans did after their defeat in WWI b) to stop the spread of communism by getting capitalism in there first and hoping the Japanese would be against communism and c) postwar trade would help the American economy.

All countries have their positives and negatives. Personally I think the atom bombs were the worst event of the war, but of course Japan's elephant in the room is how much they try to revise history and avoid teaching about their own mistakes. A lot of that is due to the fact that Abe is the grandson of the Prime Minister responsible for a lot of the WW2 atrocities, so he tries his best to cover for his family honor."

Its a bit different from normal conjugation in that the wordstem doesn't or rarely changes. In spanish, german and latin the wordstem often also changes. That said Chinese is isolating, and english is developing towards an isolating structure, too."

Also even though Japanese is agglutinative it actually shows fusional aspects in its non-affixing verb conjugations. Though it's actually common for agglutinative languages to acquire fusional traits, or become fully fusional over time.  I'm not really sure what you're arguing with. All I said was that most languages have conjugation, and that Japanese is actually probably on the easier side because of its straightforward nature. Nor am I sure what ""normal"" conjugation is because that somehow implies one language is the ""normal"" version."
weeabootales,3a53k0,Pennwisedom,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:58:27 2015 UTC,"Actually I am argueing with nothing. I agreed with you that this agglutinative structure is straightforward or rather it depends on what some learner would call straightforward.    Nor am I sure what ""normal"" conjugation is because that somehow implies one language is the ""normal"" version.   Thats why I wrote it in cursive. I know ""normal"" is pretty shitty term to use, what I meant were conjugations like in most european languages likes latin, german, spanish, russian etc.  Sorry if it came like I was argueing something, but I was fully agreeing with you.  (Okay I may made mistakes with the terminology, but didn't want to argue, rather just add something)   You know German is also an agglutinative language too, right?    √Ñhm, nein? German is pretty much fusional, also it has stuff like Umlaute. Isn't agglutination that the wordstem does not change when a word is conjugated and in german it pretty much changes all the time."
weeabootales,3a53k0,CringeMaiden,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:15:42 2015 UTC,"Okay then, I wasn't quite sure if you were or weren't.    √Ñhm, nein? German is pretty much fusional, also it has stuff like Umlaute. Isn't agglutination that the wordstem does not change when a word is conjugated and in german it pretty much changes all the time.   As I touched on a bit before, the boundary between agglutinative and fusional languages is a pretty grey one. But yes, in a pure aggultinative language, the morphemes would never change. But it's perhaps best to look at fusional and agglutinative languages as two sides of the same coin. And German is definitely a language that has both features in it.   Without writing a big thing, it is perhaps just easier to call German a derivational synthetic language in which it simply uses morphemes of different types to create new words."

weeabootales,3a0d4s,WuhanWTF,17,Tue Jun 16 23:38:49 2015 UTC,"It's a cheap tactic to simplify a story and/or add emotion. Especially if your character is young enough that they should be still living at home under their parents' roof, it's an easy way to explain why they're off on an adventure instead. Revenge, fulfilling a promise, continuing a legacy, solving a mystery, etc. are common motivations in fantasy stories that can be based on dead family members. If parents will in now way be relevant to the story, sometimes it's easier to just say they're dead or absent to not distract things.  I think it's cheap, but it can work sometimes."

This is a person with a family history of mental illness clearly presenting with signs of mental illness.   Start with talk therapy. If she's not receptive to that or she seems to want something more intensive, suggest in- patient therapy. It's a temporary version of what her father is using. It's intensive, but she can leave as long as she is deemed mentally competent and not a danger to herself.   She is at an age where she can still come back from a breakdown, given the proper resources. I am US based, so I don't have any resources on hand, but Google some therapists in your area and come to her from a genuinely concerned for her well being stance.   It is very important that she doesn't feel like you are isolating her or calling her crazy, especially since she probably has gotten that with her family history.

These things can help show her the realities of these dreams in lieu of you having to be more blunt about it.   In terms of the behavior that's driving people away, try shutting it down -- but gently, you know? Just ask, ""What did you say?"" ""Can you repeat that, but in English?""

I bring all this up because cosplay, fashion, anime and manga in Japan are all very, very fast-paced industries. If you either aren't constantly making your own content from scratch or aren't following the cusp of whatever is groundbreaking and new, you're going to be left behind and fail. In Japanese pop culture, used things have almost no value.  Have you ever been to a used book store in Japan? They're great because everything is so cheap, but they'e filled to the brim with bookshelves higher than your head of books no one wants. Years ago I bought several volumes of Dragon Ball for ¬•50 each (~$0.80 at the time, ~$0.38 now) near mint, first edition. In western markets, ""retro"" things and appreciating backissues, trends of years past, etc. is a very common thing but in Japan it basically does not exist. If it was not mega-famous, people have inevitably already forgotten about it.  I know this is far too much detail given on just a few bulletpoints you listed, OP, but it all boils down to this: if you're one of her only friends, you need to sit her down and tell her that her dreams are simply unachievable and unrealistic. What she thinks she wants to do she doesn't know the first real thing about. If she's 20 years old and has no sign that she's going to grow out of her dreams any time soon, she needs someone she trusts to tell her the hard truth.  Personally, me being who I am, if I was in your shoes I would give her one chance after a talking to to really try to shape herself up but quit being her friend if she doesn't. If she can't tell she's putting stress on her family, I almost want to say she deserves the backlash she receives, considering she's an adult now."
weeabootales,39w6gj,Chiafriend12,2,Mon Jun 15 16:48:09 2015 UTC,Is it the Japanese flag with the bare white background or with the rays coming from the red circle in the middle? Unimportant but it's really telling if it's one over the other.   I'm intrigued. How is it very telling?
weeabootales,39w6gj,InfestedNerd,5,Tue Jun 16 10:53:17 2015 UTC,"How clueless she is about basic aspects of Japanese society, depending on which version she has up. The version with the rays is on par with many Asian countries as the Nazi flag is with the West, even though most westerners don't know this and just think it's a cool design. (Most offensive in China and Korea; might not offend as many people in Japan but they all will know it's a huge faux pas to brandish it in basically any way.)  It's already clear she's in over her head with wanting to be a pro fashion designer in Japan based on the rest of her story but this would be an extra cherry on top if it was the flag with the rays."

weeabootales,39w6gj,Chiafriend12,4,Mon Jun 15 23:17:54 2015 UTC,"If the person is toxic to begin with I wouldn't be their friend in the first place honestly  This sounds to me more like they burned bridges with most of the people they know by their actions, rather than being in trouble and socially isolated by forces outside their control. Actions have consequences and as an adult and she should know that.  I assume OP has been friends with this person since childhood, which I obviously haven't. I would be a lot more lenient if I had known this person since childhood/adolescence considering such behavior was a lot more acceptable then, but if I met this person at 20 and they acted this way, I wouldn't give it hardly a second thought to get out of there considering in the grand scheme of life I barely know them, yet know them enough that I don't want to be associated with them.  If they were diagnosed as clinically mentally ill I would have a lot more sympathy too but until then I would not speculate such things and assume they're capable and able-bodied like the rest of us -- just blissfully oblivious and unwilling to be more considerate unless someone spells it out for them  Plus if she actually asked me for help in this hypothetical I would be a lot more willing to lend my time and emotions than if she had no interest in bettering herself  Besides the paragraph right before that I gave OP advice based on the situation he (?) himself is in. That clearly takes precedence in what I think he (?) should do.    Edit: The downvote button is not an ""I disagree with this post"" button. I'm not even going to say I'm sorry that you don't like it. If someone is toxic you have no obligation to be their friend, as simple as that. Do you think that's not the case?"

Going to some place such as Akihabara, or Harajuku even, she might just assume all the crazy crap that is done on Sunday is normal."

Taking her to Japan will of course be very expensive just to make a point, but I think once she actually saw the reality of what she thinks she wants to do she'll change her mind. After she blows her money and realizes it stops being replenished if you don't work and that no one wants to hire you when you don't speak their language it'll be really easy to realize the futility."

weeabootales,39we9k,Jackthastripper,3,Tue Jun 16 14:39:06 2015 UTC,"So when I noticed the Japanese name, from a decidedly non-Japanese guy. I was bored and took a look, so I found this in an article:   ""Despite all comments I've received from people out here I do still carry My Katana Inoau-rei. I was raised into it by my Master Hiko and I adopted him as my Father figure since he practically raised 14 years of my life anyway and named me Kairo so I took up his last name Seijuro for honorific reasons...that and it suites my character better..Sorry most people ask. ""   I also believe that ""Inaou-rei"" is just the name of his sword.  Followed by this comment:   Yeah, It's made up. He says ""his master,"" Hiko Seijuro, is who he trained under in Japan. The only problem is, ""Hiko Seijuro"" is the name of a series of martial arts masters in the Rurouni Kenshin anime series. He most likely adopted the name ""Kairo Seijuro"" from him. His real name is Kenneth Jacintho.   So yea, definitely a weeb."

weeabootales,39go6t,ALionInWinter,30,Sat Jun 20 16:17:32 2015 UTC,"Welcome to your first con! You'll have a great time in animu land.   What you should look for: con stink, free hugs/glomping, weird smells  Before you step aboard, here are some tips and tricks to make your stay more comfortable:  Before con:  Choose 2-3 things you definitely want to do. Going to a convention is overwhelming at first. There's lots of people, smells, noises, and lines. Dear god, the lines. If it's a big con, you'll be spending a good 45 mins to an 1 hour waiting in line for panels, concerts, etc. Little cons, the line management skills is based on the skills of the organizers. You can have an excellent small con run by a guy who also ran a giant con- or you get dashcon and their ball pit.   A great way to tell if they have their act together is if everything is up to date. Con that looks like they have their guests mostly announced (baring any early disclosure documents signed), vendor room packed, and programming all laid out around two weeks before con, that's a good organized con.   Figure out where you're staying/how are you getting home. Please don't plan to stay there overnight in the actual con- they need to shut down for reasons laid out in contract signed with the expo hall. Make a timeframe, plan accordingly, and if you're sleeping over 4 to a room (the organizers don't want to know if you do it, the hotel suspects that you do it, don't let the fire marshal know you do it), bring a sleeping bag. No one wants sleeping in the bathtub cramps. And figure out your shower schedule. No one likes con stink.  Pack a survival kit. You thought a con wouldn't need a survival kit would you? You thought wrong. Some cons have a med team that serve attendees and staff (Operation Hammond comes to mind) and some don't. I suggest a refillable water bottle (one of those nice collapsible ones), a portable battery charger (don't assume you'll get an outlet but it's nice when it's there), small compact snacks (no XXL bags of doritos), a good backpack, and something for entertainment like a DS. And nice walking/running shoes. Do you what idiot decides to wear heels when inspecting vendor merch for several hours on a concrete floor? This idiot, right here.   Most cons also run on the guidebook app so if they have it available- it is really helpful. And money. You don't want to go hungry or not be able to buy that adorbs swag because you didn't bring the moolah. And breath mints and gum...for not smelling con stink. When you chew it, it blocks some of the smell.   During con:   Know your top 2-3 things for the day and please please please, there are hours of operation posted for each specific department. Don't line up for the dealer's room two hours early in case they open early. They probably won't and you'll be better off spending those two hours doing something else. Don't plan to go to registration to pick up your badge an hour after registration has closed.   Have fun and take lots of pics but know pic etiquette: Always ask before taking a pic. I once watched a slave Leia holding a dragon egg attempt unsuccessfully to drink her coffee but was interrupted 10 times in the span of a few minutes.   If you see something, say something: It's very clich√© but it works. See a staff member being a complete dick to an attendee? Get their name off of their staff badge and go to con operations. See a vendor selling unlicensed merch? Go to the dealer room staff and report them. Getting glomped without consent and security doesnt notice? Let them know. The faster the con organizers are notified, the quicker they can fix it. And if the con organizers don't seem to try to remedy the situation or at least acknowledge what's happening..then it's probably a horrible con to come back to.   Using your resources: Don't come to the gaming staff and ask about special scheduling changes for the concert or where the line will be- they have the same idea as you do (which would be none) and that's why there's have con operations, the schedule online, and then the info desk. Find your information in advance before you go in a panic.   Know Your Limits: You only have a certain amount of time and a certain amount of energy. When you need a break, side up next to a wall and plop yourself down. Go take a breather in the manga library or game room. You can also only carry so much stuff around.  Meet people: The reason for going to a convention is to bond over shared interests. Go have fun, go to the events and panels you want, take lots of pics, and have a good time. Your experience at a convention is what you make of it.   After con:  Ahh...the post con depression. I would recommend taking that day off from work or school if you can. A convention is a tiring experience. Take it easy that day. Hang up your swag, upload those pictures, friend those people.   Beware of con plague: It's a nasty beast. Also why you should take it easy the day after the convention.   Let me know if I missed anything."
weeabootales,39go6t,spookypixels,2,Fri Jun 12 00:31:30 2015 UTC,"This is good advice for any convention, not just an Anime con.   Couple things I would add, don't buy new shoes for the con. If it's a big one (or a mega big one like SDCC) you could easily walk a number of miles in one day. New shoes will cause you a ton of problems until they are broken in. Also, if you think you're going to be standing a ton, gel inserts are a godsend.   Remember the 1-2-6 rule. 1 shower, 2 meals and 6 hours of sleep PER A DAY. And this is the minimum.   Keep some OTC pain reliever in your bag, you never know when might need it to deal with headaches or just general aches and pains.   ATMs will empty FAST, and hotels usually have higher charges (I've seen it up to 10 dollars in places... don't use those machines). Get your pocket cash outside of the con, make sure you have enough to cover your needs for the length of the convection plus some extra. Most dealers now take credit cards (yay square) so you won't have to bring a ton of cash for the dealers room, but that will also very between different cons.  Make sure your contact information is in your bag, that way if it does get misplaced hotel or constaff can contact you. If you're prone to misplacing your phone put your contact info and room number on the lock screen.  Keep pen and paper with you. Nothing sucks like meeting someone and being unable to write down there contact information. Also, if you're doing a lot of art related activities (sketch books and the like) it's good for keeping track of who has what.  Hospitality is your friend, it's a place to get a quick bite or a drink, meet with people or just get off your feet for 20 minutes. Some cons even have hot meals as well. These are usually free and tips help pay for the food and drinks, so it's a good place to tip.  If you're going in costume don't be afraid to tell people 'no', and if they are causing problems you can always call for con staff. If you're in a costume with limited sight lines having someone as a handler is helpful and can also help get people off of you. Some cons will offer a suite for cosplayers to relax in while in costume, if your con has it don't be afraid to make use of it.  For smokers, know where the smoking areas are. Most hotels will have a designated area that will compile with the local laws. If you're not a local find out what said laws are (you can ask the people out smoking if they know) and make sure to follow them. This is also true if you smoke eCigs, they may not be smoke but you still can't being blowing it around inside. Keep a lighter with you and while it's okay to ask for one now and then don't live the con on bummed cigs... and a con is a terrible place to casually smoke. If you're not a regular smoker don't smoke at a con.  Above all, remember to have fun!"

Didn't see any naruto running, no random Japanese exclamations like ""kawaii desu!"" Or ""baka"".  Nobody tried to have random conversations in bad Japanese.  Mostly I noticed that people didn't like to talk or make eye contact.  That was the biggest surprise for me.  One thing I did expect, and you should prepare for, is a bunch of fat, smelly neckbeards.  Seriously, lots of fat people walking slow, taking up space, sweating, eating pocky, and buying body pillows, sexy figurines, and hentai."

weeabootales,39go6t,Kaonis,18,Fri Jun 12 03:16:29 2015 UTC,"I went to my first con lately and even cosplayed. Thankfully my character was an old man with iconic phrases, so most people who wanted a picture of me, directly asked and wanted me doing facial expressions with associated phrases.   If you're a girl, especially if you're cosplaying, I've heard it was whole different story in a bad way. Keep an eye out for people following you or getting too close. Travel in a group if you can. Unfortunately, you might have to treat this like you're traveling in a city in a foreign country in order to avoid harassment. I know how messed up that sounds. When approaching cosplayers for pictures, be polite, direct and respect personal space. Unfortunately, the con promoters and security aren't always on your side. Don't let this scare you away, but be extra-observant and aware of those around you.   With Momocon, while I enjoyed it, I could tell that there were some management issues, such as promoters not respecting guest/panel speakers (Super Best Friends' panels getting interrupted by both employees and random con-goers), and security not really knowing what was going on, like when two wrestling cosplayers were cutting promos on each other and security thought they were actually going to fight. Good job on the cosplayers' parts, the old-school 24/7-kayfabe wrestlers would be proud, but it was obviously a work as one of the guys was dressed like Macho Man Randy Savage."

I made a model of a sword from WoW since I didn't feel like putting a whole cosplay together, but I got a lot pf compliments on it. However, this description is pretty spot on, guests were obnoxious, security weren't controlling them well, some rules were completely unenforced, while others were enforced to the point where it felt like I was being targeted (my ""weapon"" got checked at least a dozen times despite the clearly visible 'checked' tape), and there really wasn't a whole lot unless you were planning on spending the whole day buying wall posters. Gaming part was pretty cool tho."

Seriously, though, remember all those ""don't trust strangers"" lessons your parents taught you? Don't go anywhere alone with a person you don't know or have just met! Do not follow anyone you don't know or have just met back to their hotel room. Don't accept drinks from strangers. If something doesn't feel right, get the fuck out of there! If you are asked for an emergency contact when you register, make sure that person a) is not attending the convention but b) is within 20 minutes if possible. Don't give anyone money. ""I only have enough for lunch"" or ""I already spent mine on pocky and manga"" is a great excuse. Speaking of which, drink WATER and eat REAL FOOD. Soda/alcohol and candy are not acceptable alternatives. And what I think is the most important rule (learned by personal experience), if they seem weird/are acting inappropriately and you're forced into an interaction with them to be polite, don't give out any more information than you feel comfortable. No facebook, no last name, no phone number. Be rude if you have to. A convention lasts a weekend, a stalker lasts forever. And I'm sorry if that sounds paranoid, but it has happened to me and to several of my friends.  This comes from an attendee and staffer of 5-6 conventions a year. I think I know what convention you are going to based on your other posts and I know the security staff there - some of them are good friends of mine from other conventions, and you can definitely go to them with any issues you have.

In junior year he wanted to get in shape to feel better [be a better ninja]. So i took him running with me and he ran like this and got out of breath in like 10 feet. Tried doing stages with him and do some light 1 min. jog. 1 min walk to work him up. Called me a retard and the only way to get better is run full blast 24/7. I got him to do the jog exercise with me after some convincing and he JOGGED like this. Talk about an awkward fucking sight.   Tried teaching him proper running form, open hands, straight back, finding the good high point of your knees and keeping your forearms level with the ground and pumping them to the rhythm of your legs. For the fucking life of me he refused to accept the fact that pumping your arms helps the momentum of your legs and your upper body has nothing to do with running.

A man who looked to be in his late thirties to flurries started talking to me and asked me the most frequently asked question when you're Asian -- ""what kind of asian are you?"" Etc. when I told him I was japanese, he started talking to me about how Japan was great and the culture is amazing, blah blah you know the usual stuff.  We parted ways but he proceeded to not leave me alone at all for the rest of the con and follow me around and kept on trying to talk to me. I told him I was going to stay with my friends but he would say I should come back with him to his hotel room to talk. Eventually he got me when I was alone at the ""rave"" or whatever they had and groped and tried to make out with me. I couldn't move because I was too scared.  I don't think most weebs are into sexually harassing and assaulting people or anything and the typical weeaboo is pretty harmless compared to that guy.

weeabootales,38lrbh,Arotaes_Forgehammer,34,Fri Jun 5 01:12:17 2015 UTC,"laughing at weeado, but anyways.   I saw myself as TOTES UNIQUE AND DIFFERENT but I think most 10-14 year olds do. I thought I was in some super special club, I didn't think I was better than anyone but I definitely felt like a ""part of something"" especially since I was on fanboards and made fanart and such. (they were terrible.) I saw them as boring. If they didn't like anime, I assumed they were boring and mainstream and had no imagination.  I think I saw my own as normal, I was just a regular fan. I saw the actions of my friends embarrassing though. (They would glomp and scream about gay sex and write gay fanfics and share them around, and wear anime merch everywhere. It was gross, I am no longer their friends.) I never injured anyone, however my weeb friend (who screamed about gay sex) was a heavy set girl and hurt me a few times by throwing herself on me or just straight up slapping me.  Nobody had to stop me, I got into high school and met some new friends who were dorks but didn't need to yell about it or announce it, and gradually moved away from those people. I do remember the other weebs I used to be associated with hating on me and calling me a sell out though. I wish I'd ""sold out"" sooner."
weeabootales,38lrbh,Mquestionmark,21,Fri Jun 5 01:25:15 2015 UTC,"First I should explain that I never seemed to fully buy into the weeaboo culture. I was just a lonely kid desperate for some kind of companionship and at the time these were the only people willing to offer it. This stage of my life lasted from the age of 13 to 17. It left me with deep trust issues making friends and an unnatural and irrational dislike for anything anime or Japan related for many years. Thankfully I'm 25 now and most of those issues are disappearing.  1) I was never too extreme (except for one 6 month period), so I guess I saw myself as normal for the first time. I was finally making friends that considered me a friend too and not just some random guy they only talk to at school. It didn't last long though, and I started seeing myself as some kind of freak for hanging out with these kind of people. It got worse as I got older because I started meeting people in their 30's without families or real jobs and still obsessing over their waifus or bishonen. I was starting to become terrified that this would be my future. I got heavily into drugs at this point.  2) Like people. I never really felt that these people were against me just for not having the same hobbies as me. Don't get me wrong, I vilified them like my friends were doing, but that was more out of desperation to continue to fit in.  3) The only thing I saw as normal was that I had friends. I can't tell you how desperate I was to be normal after a lifetime of having no normalcy. Everything else about the weeaboo lifestyle kinda scared me. I had to get high to participate in some of the activities my friends participated in like gatherings with other sweaty weebs and poorly done cosplay.  4) I didn't. I was an obese teenager and I knew my girth was dangerous to throw around. Of course, that didn't stop some of my even fatter friends from glomping and attempting to chase down cute girls and guys. I think part of what stopped me though was that at this point I was really struggling with my sexuality. I knew I was gay, but I couldn't come to terms with it. I knew girls were pointless to chase because I wasn't interested, and I refused to go after guys because I knew my friends would immediately start to fetishize it. Most of my female friends were hardcore into yaoi. I made sure any kind of sexual activity I participated in was very secretive and couldn't be traced back to me. I actually think my yaoi fangirl friends were a big factor in stopping me from coming out in my teens.  5) Absolutely. My friends got me to chase someone down once. My female friends found some cute Asian guys at the mall and they begged me to come and follow them around and take video. They knew I was the only guy in the group willing (again, desperate to keep friends) and I guess they thought they'd be less suspicious looking with a guy around despite their giggling and whispering. We had security called on us and we got kicked out of the mall. Took a lot of oxy to live that embarrassment down. I never participated in that shit again after that."
weeabootales,38lrbh,tacomalvado,8,Fri Jun 5 06:59:07 2015 UTC,"1: I guess my weeb phase was fairly mild, because I only saw my self as a regular american kid who was interested in Japan  2: Not much differently from me, really.  3: Fairly normal, but I really didn't do anything too stupid.  4: Never did injure anyone.  5: No one actually cared enough, the only time my friends called me a weeb was by the time I was on my way out of the phase.  I guess I wasn't too much of a blithering idiot."
weeabootales,38lrbh,HFlatMinor,9,Fri Jun 5 01:32:05 2015 UTC,"That I was a cut above the rest. I had this idea that I was in on some secret thing that ""normal people"" didn't know about, and because of that I'm better than all of them. I think I sorta answered this already, but again, I just saw them as people who weren't as cool or in the know as me. If they tried to insult or make fun of me, I brushed it off because I didn't give a fuck. I thought it was the better than normal thing to do. I never was the kind of person who would throw Japanese phrases into my sentences, I was more just overbearing with my tastes in things, to the point that I'd try to shove it down others throats. Never injured anyone. I hugged a lot of people at times I maybe shouldn't have though. (As a result I now looooooove when someone hugs me though) If someone told me I was in the wrong, I brushed it off (which I also think I mentioned already), but it was also the budding age of the internet, so I'd complain about the gall of these dumbasses, who knew nothing about me, in chat rooms or forums where large numbers of like minded individuals gathered, so it only served to reinforce my behaviors in thinking I was the best.   Mostly, by highschool I grew out of most of it, learned how to be a normal decent human being. I also fell in witha  group of friends who liked all the same stuff as me but were more normal about it. They are some of my bestest friends of today.  I still like Anime. I don't have Japan up on some pedestal and think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread, but I still wouldn't mind taking a vacation there one day.  I buy small amounts of merchandise and BluRays of shows I really really like.  I don't try to shove my feelings about things down other throats, and am always open to hear what someone else has to say about anything now. I still am a little proud about the things that I like. I don't try to hide that I like anime or whatever, it's part of who I am (gag). I just no when to bring it up, and when not to, and, again, to be more respectable about it."
weeabootales,38lrbh,lftenjamin,5,Fri Jun 5 06:25:47 2015 UTC,"Confession time. I was a weeaboo before there was a word for weeaboo and way back in the distant past when you traded fansubs on VHS over AOL or CompuServe. I knew it was cringey. So me and my weeb friends kept it to ourselves. However, I went on to develop an actual interest in modern Japan and Japanese subcultures and underground music. I actually learned Japanese and lived there but I knew Japanese people really thought weebism was strange so I guess by learning about Japan, it gave me a weeabortion. I still like anime and I listen to more Japanese music than most people do, but that's about the extent of it. I didn't care. Again, 18-20 years ago it was considered weird for anyone older than middle school to watch animated stuff and enjoy it, at least around where I'm from, so I didn't expect anyone else to share my tastes. No, I definitely knew I was being weird but I was a weird kid before I was a weeaboo. I showed up to the first day of 6th grade with a cape on and a sprouted garlic around my neck for jewelry. Like a whole garlic plant. I don't know to this day. Glomping was not a thing. That came later I think. No actions taken, I just grew the fuck up.   edit: disclaimer---I usually have anime hair. I can't help it, it fucking looks awesome. Right now it's pretty normal looking though."

weeabootales,38lrbh,ZeronicX,10,Mon Jun 8 05:17:19 2015 UTC,"Was a weeabo from middle till my freshman year in high school, but then again who wasn't. read the Shonen Jumps when they were still physical and read/watch various animes and mangas and had a Naruto headband that i wore to school sometimes  1) I saw myself as a special little snowflake who was graced by the wondrous gods of Naruto and Ichigo to share their stories. i enjoyed it at the time and found other people who enjoyed it so it gave me a group to be with which i kind of needed at the time.  2)I never went the full ""Join or Die"" as the more extreme weeaboos went. But i did push heavily for non manga/anime readers/watchers to do so..  3)I saw them as normal, but then again everything is normal in a group. there were a few times where i though i wasn't going more extreme than i could have been if that makes any sense.  4)No, never,  5)At the time i would have thought it was stupid and would have fought it in some way."
weeabootales,38lrbh,Tozetre,4,Fri Jun 5 01:43:23 2015 UTC,"Oppressed and misunderstood tragic hero. Amoral murderers-in-potentia, but this was probably due more to my bible-thumping christfaggotry than any weebishness. Normal and good and righteous and justified. Never did. Anyone who tried to stop me from weebing was seen as someone who was trying to remove the only thing that gave me joy in life, so basically they were Hitler. And, to be fair, it was the only thing that gave me joy in life. As much as people had a point about my weebery, when they wanted me to stop consuming huge amounts of anime and manga they really were asking me to give up the one thing I could dependably experience happiness in. The rest of my life was not happy, and not all of it was a direct result of my being a social retard. TL;DR I never thought they were justified, though I made no distinction at the time between fandom and expressions of fandom."
weeabootales,38lrbh,the_lettuce_avenger,3,Fri Jun 5 15:29:10 2015 UTC,"I had a pretty cringey weeb phase, but I was never really as shitty enough to have a story written about me other than ""she was pretty annoying"" but here goes: 1. This is kind of a difficult question because in a way, I sort of saw myself as an enlightened person compared to others, and for some reason I thought I was a really good cosplayer. But then again, I also thought I wasn't good enough; I wasn't cute enough, I didn't know enough Japanese, I wasn't a good enough drawer etc etc. I also thought that I was a 'speshul snowlflek' 2. This depends; mostly I veiwed them with a sort of pity, and wondered WHAT ON EARTH THEY WOULD EVEN TALK ABOUT if they weren't in a fandom of some kind - if they weren't into anime, that was fine, but I didn't understand people who didn't openly obsess about something (Harry Potter, LotR). I had much more negative viewpoints for those that said anime was trash and would get very angry. 3.I percieved some of my (very cringey) actions as normal, such as cosplaying at the park or at school or doing anime dances randomly (ugh). I also thought making jokes about perverts were really funny. 4. Although I had always wanted to glomp someone or hit someone when I was angry in a slapstick way, I was always very worried that I would hurt someone. Once I hit someone thinking I had done it in a light joking way and actually hurt them, and felt really badand apologised a lot. I only glomped someone once at a con, after asking their permission first. 5. I would ramble about anime  A LOT. My mum would tell me that I was being incredibly boring and I would always feel really hurt but now I realise that I was, in fact, being very boring and selfish  and I'm glad she did that because now I restrict my rambling to those who are actually interested in it, and it's saved a lot of my old friendships"
weeabootales,38lrbh,bailiff,3,Fri Jun 5 09:55:31 2015 UTC,"I was a pretty low-level weeb, but was definitely on the weeb spectrum from age 15 to 18.    A bit superior, for trying to learn about another culture when my classmates barely seemed to know about their own.   I just didn't really understand why they wouldn't or why they thought I was odd. To me it was the most natural thing to like anime, and to be interested in the culture it came from in order to understand it better. And I thought learning any words of a different language was always an accomplishment.   Sort of touched on this a bit already, but yeah. I knew that others thought I was weird, but I didn't really understand why.    The only people I ever glomped were close friends, and that was rare as I didn't really like touching people. So no one ever got injured or frightened because of me. By the time I went to my first anime con, I was already out of the worst of my weeb phase.   I was sort of coming out of things on my own, but in college I made a friend that I often refer to as the Watson to my Sherlock. One of the things she did was tell me ""No"" a lot. If I did something weird in public, she'd tell me to tone it down. If I was wearing something that looked strange or didn't fit, she'd tell me to change or else we wouldn't leave the house, that sort of stuff. It's a big part of why I now fit in with normal society as well as I do. She shut down the random Japanese and the yaoi t-shirts and shit whenever she could, and stripped me of the last bits of weeb."
weeabootales,38lrbh,casstantinople,3,Fri Jun 5 12:33:41 2015 UTC,"When weeaboo, how did you see yourself?    Growing up I always felt like a social outlier. I had nerdy interests and hobbies that none of my classmates (at least not the girls) seemed to share. I had few friends and none I were particularly close with. But I also played sports, did extra curricular activities, and talked with my classmates so I'm sure I seemed normal to most people. I tried very hard to appear that way, at least.  I was around 13 when I discovered anime besides Pokemon and DBZ. I made a few friends who were into anime too, but I can't say we were that close. My first year of high school at 14yo was when I hit critical weeaboo. Suddenly there a lot of people like me! And they wanted to be my friend! It was amazing. But I was very self-aware that my new subculture was not ""normal"". At the time, I tried not to care.    How did you see others who didn't subscribe to your beliefs?    I was fine with it. I tried to convince my family that anime was really deep and cool. My mom was supportive and watched a few shows. My dad hated one of the movies we watched together and refused to give any other shows a try. But he wasn't mean about it. I tried not to be pushy and respect people's preferences if they didn't like anime. I had friends who would talk endlessly about anime with me, so I didn't need to force it on others.    How did you perceive your own actions? Did you see them as normal in any way?    I knew everything we did as weeaboos wasn't normal. Dressing up like anime characters, going to conventions, fighting about who ""owned"" what character, and spending oodles of money on DVDs, comics, and goods was ridiculous, but I didn't care. I finally had a place where I could fit in and belong. Like many weeaboos, I secretly fantasized about living in an anime and dreamed of being a manga artist. I knew it wasn't real, but it was comforting to imagine I was some special chosen one.     If you injured someone purposely, (""glomping"") how did you justify your actions?    Is this a defining characteristic of weeaboos? I'll admit, I've been glomped before, but I've never been one to instigate it. But in general, I justified my weeaboo actions as innocent fun with my friends. There were a few times when I got way too emotionally invested in something anime-related and experienced some petty in-fighting, but overall I think I my weeaboo phase was pretty mild and ultimately was beneficial to developing into a well-rounded adult.    If actions were taken against you to stop you from doing what you weeado, did you think those actions were justified?    My parents were supportive. If anything, my family was too supportive. One time my mom proudly introduced me to my uncle's new wife as ""This is Bailiff, did you know she sometimes dresses up like characters with her friends?? Isn't that cute!"" I was mortified.  I think my parents were well aware that it was just a teenage phase. Thankfully I did naturally grow out of it. Just a few years after peak weeaboo, I tried rewatching some of my favorite old shows and cringed at how terribly written they were. Some things have stood the test of time, but a lot of them were definitely ""im14andthisisfunny"" quality.  Ironically I'm now living in Japan... but I'm not interested in anime/otaku culture at all."
weeabootales,38lrbh,KuroiKaze,2,Fri Jun 5 13:00:00 2015 UTC,"I hit my weeb stage later in life, starting from age 15 and running to 18. I suppose it would've been much worse if it'd happened earlier so I was a fairly mild weeb.    I didn't see myself as anything special, but I /did/ consider myself to know a lot about Japan and Japanese culture.  Most of my friends were fairly into anime stuff but for those who weren't, it was kinda like ""dude you have to watch these shows, they're sooooo good."" I thought they were all missing out pretty heavily.  I knew it wasn't the healthiest habit, but I really liked the storylines and I got pretty popular from some, er, fanfiction I wrote so I considered it constructive at least that I was writing. Thankfully I never had any experience with glomping. I remember being pretty confused when someone ""glomped"" me in a chat room.  I don't wanna say it went away on its own, but it kinda did. I ended up going on a date with this guy on a night I was going to finish some fics and then publish a ton of them, and then when I got back from the date I suddenly just didn't want to write anymore. And then I didn't want to watch any more anime, the idea of going to a con was weird, etc etc."
weeabootales,38lrbh,Dragovic,2,Fri Jun 5 18:01:23 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer, when I got into anime in 1993 very few had any idea at all it was a ""thing"".  You had to get your fansub VHS tapes in the mail.  The internet wasn't really a big thing yet, so chances are you and your close friends would be the only people you were aware of that even liked anime.  Conventions were a lot of people in regular clothes looking to get their hands on shows/merch since it was rare as hell.  The internet killed the ""rare merch/shows"" aspect of cons and waifus/cosplay sadly filled the void with narcissism and bad humor.     This was back when nobody knew what anime was so I felt like I discovered some ""secret"" awesomeness. I felt a bit like they were too dismissive to realize there was some really good stuff happening. I knew I was wacky, weird, and such.  I didn't really expect anyone outside of my good friends to get all of our humor.  Then again I had a good circle of friends and wasn't really a visible freak in any particular way. No such thing when I was watching anime.  We used to sort of anime fight in the parking lot trying to mimic ninja scroll.  We hit each other but not hard enough to really be a problem. I think we were just chalked up as ""rowdy kids"" and that was it."
weeabootales,38lrbh,NinjapwnX3,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:02:20 2015 UTC,I've always wanted to hear weeabootales from the pre internet days but sadly I've only found one or two. Do you have any even from people who are slightly weebish? How about just general stories about finding rare shows especially before Sailor Moon even became popular?
weeabootales,38lrbh,speaking_of_nabokov,2,Sat Jun 6 01:57:48 2015 UTC,"I was a weeb from about 13-15. I'm 17 now and still like anime, but I know where to stop with shit and have way more interests so I can function outside of it.  1) I saw myself as a kawaii cat girl despite my terrible self esteem. I would wear cat ears everyday and made sure they matched my outfits so it was ""cute"". Legit, I had about 15 and they're still sitting in my closet in a bag somewhere. I also thought I was an ""amazing"" artist when in reality I was shit compared to what I draw now.  2) I saw others as boring and mainstream. I thought I was too cool for them.  3) I knew my actions weren't normal, that's why I did it. It was a way to get myself to stand out in some kind of way since I wasn't very remarkable.  4) I don't recall ever injuring someone on purpose, I saw glomping as overly excessive.  5) I believe my freshman year of high school I got a lot of kids mad because I could wear my cat ears and they couldn't wear their hats. They even tried to make a rule but technically I was using a loophole of ""hair accessories"". I think that was justified though. However getting harassed wasn't, but it eventually got me to stop."
weeabootales,38lrbh,godsdebris,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:33:20 2015 UTC,"I was a shy weeb, so my answers might be different. My shows were Yu-Gi-Oh!, Yu Yu Hakusho, Ruroni Kenshin, DB/DBZ, and Fruits Basket.    I saw myself as desperately involved with something amazing. Only my best friend turned gf could ever understand or share what love I had for the shows I got into. I was part of the story and the characters were a part of me. I was also a clinically depressed child (12-14), so immersing myself like that was very easy and very self- therapeutic.    ~   I was not a judgy weeb. I thought others just had different interests, although they would never understand the pure joy I got from my experiences with anime.    ~   Oh hell no. I was a freak and I knew it. I just didn't know how to be anything else. I had found something I enjoy (and still enjoy to this day approaching 25) but went into it waaaaay too strong! At the time, I simultaneously hated and loved being the weird quiet anime girl. It was something that set me apart in my VERY homogeneous town (teen angst, it's good to be different!), but it also crippled me socially. And I was very well aware of it.    ~   I actually was on the receiving end of this from the group of girls I glommed on to after the aforementioned gf shattered my heart (at the time. Yay more teen angst!). She had always been touchy- feely with everybody, so emphatic hugs were normal. But one time she pulled me to the ground with her. Over concrete. She landed on me. Was totally anti-apologetic. ""Oh are you hurt? But that's just so totally something I would do!"" [cue all of the death glares]   ~   I never required an intervention since it sort of happened organically. I stayed away from all of the anime I was really into with my ex-gf when she broke up with me (painful reminders), despite still loving the characters. I had a non-weeb related falling out with the group of girls early in my junior year, which further removed me from the anime scene. I then had no real friends and thus no one to share anime with. I got involved with the marching band, which removed me even further. Then college came. I was 18 and ready to make a whole group of new friends (since I had none from high school). I joined some anime related club and the weebness hit me like a brick wall. I decided that anime was something I was going to just enjoy on my own in small doses from that point on.   ~  And that is my coming-of-weeb story. Great questions!  Edit: My numbers are not coming out right? I have them typed in correctly but they're showing up all as 1"

I don't really care about indoctrinating people to become weebs. I'm pretty good at hiding my power level. I dont injure people. I'm good at hiding my power level, and I'm not so autistic that if someone called me out I would just continue acting weebish."
weeabootales,38lrbh,NeoVodka,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:15:31 2015 UTC,"I was really into anime from seventh grade until the end of my freshman year of college, and I was pretty weeb-ish for most of it. I ""downgraded"" to merely liking anime until I graduated college, which was about six years ago, and then I stopped enjoying it pretty much altogether.   I definitely thought I was in this super special unique club. I thought I was more cultured than other people who weren't into it. I'm sure it's not a coincidence that I got into it right after starting a new school and being introduced to it by my new classmates. It was my way of trying to fit in. Like others, I saw them as boring and uncultured, and uninterested in learning about culture. I knew we weren't in the mainstream so I didn't see myself as ""normal,"" but I never put much stock in normal. I did think we were pretty cool. I didn't start to see myself as kind of crazy until I saw myself reflected in my freshman year roommate, who was also super into anime but extremely not self aware. When the res life director explained she paired us up as roommates because ""our applications were basically the same,"" I began to reassess my behavior. I don't think I ever injured anyone while glomping. I think I was usually pretty conservative with my excited hugs. My parents expressed concern at several points, especially when my love for anime connected me with a man who was significantly older than me, and a defiant romantic relationship grew out of that. They never actively tried to stop me except when my grades were affected. Looking back, I don't think they were wrong to be concerned, but I'm glad they didn't try to stop me from watching anime, going to cons, etc. Even though I cringe at my past behavior and I don't enjoy anime anymore, I think a normal part of being a teenager is clinging to a subculture and trying to use that to figure out who you are."
weeabootales,38lrbh,godsdebris,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:50:02 2015 UTC,"I saw myself as an awesome person because I thought all the cool people in the world loved anime! I also thought I was edgy because in middle school...I knew so much about hentai and I thought I was the shit! Anytime someone said I looked Japanese...I would ask them to say it again and again (I'm mostly mistaken for korean though, but I'm Thai/Chinese)  Hmm...I just thought of them as un-cultured (if that's a word), like they weren't exposed to different cultures and they lived in their own bubbles and were not willing to try new things.  I thought my actions were completely normal, I thought people in Japan acted like they did in J-Dramas and Anime. Nope I was wrong.  I once hit a girl in the face because I was trying to be like my OC (She was so Mary-Sue, She was dating Sasuke from Naruto, she had a tough childhood, her name was Akito Kiwasaki *face palm)  I eventually stopped myself because I discovered Weeaboostories on tumblr...and holy crap that was a fucking wake-up call. I got my shit together and decided to start acting like a civilized human being.

weeabootales,38lrbh,cm-eli,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:53:27 2015 UTC,"1.) I think I saw myself as someone who just liked Japan and was into anime. This was circa 2001-2003. I hung out in Yahoo! Chat rooms and roleplayed various anime characters--and I would throw in random Japanese words in chat. In real life I never said anything in Japanese outloud besides the typical Japanese words that made their way into the English language (sushi, ramen, karaoke, etc).  Actually, I never got called anything similar to what a weeaboo is then. I don't know if the word even existed! I get called a weeaboo now, though--and I'm 30! Mainly because I submitted a video to the Conan O'Brien show where I playfully corrected Andy's Japanese  from some segment they did. Anyways, the video I created was chosen for the show and shit hit the fan. In response to being called a ""weeaboo"" for that, I just saw myself as a normal person who lived in Japan, worked a full time job and was semi-fluent in Japanese.  2.) As a kid I remember being super annoyed if people listened to the dub. ""Liek omg, how can you listen to the shitty English voices. You gotta listen to it the way it was MEANT to be!"" Back in the early 2000's (and even earlier) it was harder to come by anime, and you had to choose between either buying the English or the Japanese version. Good old VHS. Sometimes you couldn't choose because the store would either have only the English version or the Japanese version. Because of how difficult it was to get my hands on anime, I actually didn't watch much. I read up on series online much more than I ever saw a show--or I'd read a website that had the synopsis with line-by-line translations and some explanation of what was happening in the video. I digress.  3.) I guess I figured I was just trying to be happy. I had friends who didn't watch anime, but knew I watched anime and I had friends who watched anime. I had a friend who belittled me for watching anime, but I kept watching it. I just really wanted to be happy and be entertained.  4.) I never did. I didn't like being touched haha. It also wasn't a thing back then I don't think.  5.) No actions were taken! I used to draw anime pictures and doodles and my mother basically encouraged me to keep drawing.  I think if I was or am a weeaboo, I am one of the most boring weeaboos out there."
weeabootales,38lrbh,Frelark,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:29:58 2015 UTC,"I wasn't super self-confident (still am not, but working on it, I suppose). But, I don't think I ever let it get ridiculously bad (just middle school awkwardness amplified by weeb awkwardness. Luckily I snapped out of it QUICK). I don't think I was too concerned about other people. I was kind of an asshole (still am, hopefully better) and thought more of myself than of anyone else. I didn't think about my actions as normal or abnormal, but rather just my own kind of thing that I did. Everyone has their own interests and I just sort of did my own shit while letting everyone else do their own shit. I haven't injured anyone seriously quite yet. Accidentally slapped someone in the boobs when we were playing volleyball (I thought lewd anime ""accidents"" didn't happen in real life... I've been quite careful ever since then). Face turned so red I thought I was gonna explode. But, this has nothing to do with weebiness, so I digress. Again, I luckily didn't let it get quite too far to the point where I needed some kind of intervention. I just grew out of it, I supposed. The more I became self-aware and empathetic toward other people, the more I began to resent how I used to act (just shitty middle schooler angst and douchebaggery).   I'm still horrible weeaboo trash right now though hehhehehe."
weeabootales,38lrbh,lowfat-hipster,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:45:13 2015 UTC,"My thought process was literally ""OMG I'M SO MISUNDERSTOOD WHY DOES NO ONE UNDERSTAND ME AND SEE THE ART AND BEAUTY IN ANIMU"" but then again that could also be me being a teenager at the time and trying to be hipster when everyone else was into more American mainstream things. Surprisingly (and gladly) I was fine with those who weren't into the whole anime or Japanese culture. I think I was more of a closet weeb in that I probably looked like a mousy student who kept to myself... then once you talked to me oh boy all that would ever come out of my mouth would be weird weeb things. I knew there were certain people in my life who weren't cool with the weeb thing so I made an effort to hide it but around those who was more comfortable with I let it all out embarrassingly. To be honest at the time I thought they were perfectly normal and that I was still being mature for my age. I kinda was in that I was more covert with my weebness with certain people. Except you always realize the dumb stuff you did when you get older, now thinking about it. Like the time I tried to pull the whole tsundere thing on a friend and called this boy classmate of mine my slave and playfully kept punching people and making cat noises because I thought I was being cute wtf like no I tried to play it off as ""normal"" or an accident. I never injured someone intentionally, but I have gotten carried away due to it. I had a bad habit of glomping people back in high school without warning and made the mistake of glomping this random guy in my club and grazing one of his earings. Needless to say, after that I never glomped again. LOL NOPE. Was a ""rebellious little shit"" and tried to be too hipster. I just grew out of it after life experiences and such, that's all.   edit: accidentally submitted too soon whoops... added some stuff"

weeabootales,38lrbh,unfunnypun,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:53:43 2015 UTC,"1.)  I saw myself as, well, an anime character and pretty animated. I thought I was being unique bringing chopsticks to school, wearing cat ears, dancing in public, speaking in broken Japanese, you know the usual weeby stuff.  2.) I just shrugged them off because I thought their opinions didn't really matter to me, that they were just jerks out to get me. I still have that mindset (try to, at least), but the only difference is that I'm not a weeb being oblivious to my obnoxious behavior like I was.  3.) I perceived my actions as friendly and not harming anybody at all, which most of them were harmless but enough to creep people out and think I'm weird.  4.) I usually laughed or felt genuinely sorry, depended if someone was actually injured or just putting up a dramatic front in a comedic way.  5.) I would think they were irrational, because like I said, I thought it didn't really hurt anybody. I'm lead to believe that my weebishness seriously costed me some very good potential friends, and if I could pass back time, I would tell past me, ""Hey! Don't be such a weeb!""."

I didn't care, I don't even think I was that isolated, even if it's just because I grew up in a very polite town. I did not perceive them at all. idk, I was always at least 30 pounds lighter than most of my classmates, and I've never been confrontational Actions taken against me? No one fought me or anything. Eventually my low self-esteem caught up to me and I tried to improve myself a little. Idk how well that worked since now I read stories on reddit about making fun of nerds, but I have better hygiene at least.   I wasn't really a weeaboo in that I was super into anime- I just played a lot of video games, wasn't very aware of Japan happening. But it's hard to make friends when you're a girl who plays video games but I wasn't old enough to realize that it was why, and I wasn't lonely enough to even notice that people didn't want to be friends with me. I had a very good home life, some close friends, and a few more friends.   My parents were both gamers, which is why I never noticed that I didn't fit in.  But since I only had a few friends and no urge to make any more, I didn't always have a good frame of reference for what was toxic or not (ie pretend overreacting when someone says they don't like something)  Low self esteem didn't catch up to me for a while until I realized that all my friends were better than me at absolutely everything, but it turned out I had a chronic illness so I don't feel quite so bad about it anymore."

I thought they were bullying me, and I was the sad, kawaii victim. In hindsight, I would also call myself stupid. I knew I wasn't hurting anyone, but I knew people thought it was weird. I never hurt anyone. Even in the depths of weeb-dom, I'm not that kind of person. I was so upset I never got to go to conventions back in the day. I go now, but I'm my own person.

(I think that's what got me out of the weeaboo phase to be honest)  If an authority figure took action against my behavior I would think it was justified, but if it was a kid my age, I would perceive them as being obnoxious."

I tried to convince them that anime was no different then any other type of television show and get them to start watching it no matter how many times they told me they didn't want to. I guess I saw them as normal, I didn't I was a weaboo because I wasn't the person with loads of manga in my room and dressing up as anime characters on a daily basis. Even though I didn't do any of that shit anime still was the basis of 90% of my conversation and I would constantly ditch my mates to watch anime. Umm I never really hurt anyone I guess other than all of my friends respect for me. Anytime my friends would talk about me being a weeb any tell me that it was weird or make fun of me because of it I'd just ignore them or tune them out."

I never had a lot of friends in elementary school, which may have contributed to my love of Anime. Well, I thought they were a bit closed minded to Anime and manga, but I don't remember having a hatred towards normal people. Just having fun doing what I wanted. I had some year or two long obsession with ecchi though, so kind of cringy... No, I've never glomped or attacked someone for not liking Japan. Nah, it kind of died out and I just realized myself most of the time until I finally made some friends with people who approached me in freshmen year of high school."

weeabootales,38bsrk,Doilyn,17,Wed Jun 3 13:35:19 2015 UTC,"I don't much about martial arts, but I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to to do it to people who aren't putting you in physical danger.   This girl NEVER grew out of glomping. This story took place a bit over 10 years ago. Her weebness died down a bit, but the glomping never did. She then began to channel her weebness into the Twilight saga.   If only there were a ""TwilightTales"" sub, I could post the full story because it's on of the most extreme stories with her, but I'll tell the short version without all most of the ridiculous stuff in it. Basically I had been literally forced to go to the Twilight sequel (no idea which one) premiere after AWF had known for years I didn't like Twilight. She was 17 and I was 16 at the time. In line, she was saying the name of her favorite animal over and over again in this awful baby voice.  I told her it was annoying and to cut it out. But she kept going and seeing how I was annoyed thought it'd be more fun to get in MY FACE and do it. Then she ""glomped"" me while doing it and I had enough. I very lightly pushed her off me (please know I was a scrawny girl who was only 5' 2"". There's no way I had any upper body strength to shove her and actually hurt her.)   She flipped out and again, twisted my arm around or something and I was just more pissed. If I had driven my own car there, I would have walked out and went home.   I haven't seen her in person since she graduated high school though I still have her on Facebook. A friend of mine went to lunch with her recently and apparently she is still glomping....in her mid twenties..."
weeabootales,38bsrk,Doilyn,3,Wed Jun 3 18:34:56 2015 UTC,"Jesus Christ girl, what a fucking bully! I'm so sorry you had to deal with that kind of insanity. I do know about martial arts, and any respectable teacher at any respectable dojo/school for ANY martial art gets PISSED when a student used their knowledge to hurt another person. The first rule is always to use your strength for defense ONLY. It is typical and expected for a student to be punished, even expelled and barred from further training if these things happen. As a kid, she would probably not get expelled, but still. It boils my blood! Most kids take martial arts and use it to boost their self-esteem and confidence, but once in a while, shit like things happens.  I digress though. I hope you've made better friends now. That is stupid."
weeabootales,38bsrk,Edgefish,3,Wed Jun 3 21:28:09 2015 UTC,"After the Twilight incident I never really made an effort to hang out with her again except for in passing, save one time before she moved to university (she was a year ahead of me). We're still technically acquaintances on Facebook and all. Saw her once at a friend's wedding and didn't approach her. Still don't know if she saw me.   I'm in complete agreement though, which is why I was so shocked by what she did, which was clearly a way to express her superiority/strength against me for no fucking reason, especially since there was no way I could cause her physical harm in either circumstances due to my own small size and lack of athleticism at the time.  And yeah, she would tote the whole ""it's only used for self-defense"" thing all the damn time. And martial arts/self-defense training is awesome for people, especially kids. I have a cousin with Aspergers who takes karate and it's really wonderful for him.   But my friend was powered with delusional self-importance due to her weebiness. Pretty much everyone in our group of friends/acquaintances got sick of her crap once they matured enough to have self-respect, myself included. The only reason she was invited to my friend's wedding was because the husband was a mutual friend of AWF and they happy couple met through her."

My ancestors are German, and though I'm not obsessed with it, it is definitely my 2nd favorite country.   I do love anime   Me too.    I have called my friends baka on some occasions, somewhat ironically??? I constantly squish my friend's cheeks and call her ""kawaii"", but she is honestly the most adorable person i know, looks and personality   I have a friend who calls me onii-chan and I call her imouto. And other similar ""weeb"" phrases. But never in public and never in mixed company. However, if your friend is uncomfortable with you squishing their cheeks, you are a weeb without a shadow of a doubt. If you call people baka or kawaii in public, you're borderline weeb."
weeabootales,384j56,InfestedNerd,40,Mon Jun 1 21:23:53 2015 UTC,"Mixing up japanese in your language, no matter where, is definitely weebism."
weeabootales,384j56,Keksus_,-7,Tue Jun 2 01:32:49 2015 UTC,How so? How is it different from mixing Spanish with English?
weeabootales,384j56,InfestedNerd,15,Tue Jun 2 01:38:54 2015 UTC,"Japanese with english is weebism. Spanish with english would be... spainism? I'm not talking about words which just got into a language natural, due to the lack of a better word. I'm talking about the exchanging of perfectly fine english words (or words of the language you're talking)."
weeabootales,384j56,Keksus_,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:51:12 2015 UTC,"I dunno. Sometimes, in other languages, there can be a word or two that can be used to more accurately convey a subject, like [INSERT GERMAN WORD]. However, replacing words with their exact equivalent in another language is a big no-no."
weeabootales,384j56,Arotaes_Forgehammer,-4,Fri Jun 5 01:04:43 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm a weeaboo, then, since I have 1 friend that I exchange an occasional Japanese word with."
weeabootales,384j56,InfestedNerd,10,Tue Jun 2 02:06:35 2015 UTC,How do you think other weebs start?

weeabootales,384j56,InfestedNerd,8,Tue Jun 2 03:41:02 2015 UTC,It's not with weabooism. Using japanese words even though you're not speaking japanese is a clear sign of weabooism. Watching anime alone is not.
weeabootales,384j56,Keksus_,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:05:43 2015 UTC,Unless you speak English as a second language and don't know the English word for something

weeabootales,384j56,Keksus_,6,Wed Jun 3 23:01:11 2015 UTC,"Lol, nice Isis weeb comparison"
weeabootales,384j56,aequitas3,3,Tue Jun 2 07:07:27 2015 UTC,"In cases of weebism, I'd compare it to a completely caucasian fellow using spanish words mixed with his english, although he doesn't know a spick of spanish. In OP's case, however, it wouldn't be weebism since OP is of the culture. Like in your example, /u/InfestedNerd, it would be like a spanish person mixing spanish with english."
weeabootales,384j56,MayoSimba,-8,Tue Jun 2 01:52:43 2015 UTC,"I started doing it ironically with my friends and it's now mutated to the point where I use it in normal parlance. Sometimes a guy just feels like saying kawaii, ok?!?"
weeabootales,384j56,FEMINISTS,20,Tue Jun 2 01:53:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's weebism."
weeabootales,384j56,Keksus_,7,Tue Jun 2 01:57:52 2015 UTC,It's like the more time I spend here the more weebs in denial I find.

weeabootales,384j56,DerZernichter,6,Tue Jun 2 20:43:57 2015 UTC,I'd say you're closing in on the behaviors.  I'd definitely drop the use of single Japanese words unless there is no other word that meets the criteria (bishonen for example).
weeabootales,384j56,KuroiKaze,-4,Mon Jun 1 21:46:23 2015 UTC,"Now that I think about it, I really use more japanese sentences.....instead of ""baka"" i more say ""anata wa baka desu"" Is that better or worse?"
weeabootales,384j56,Captain_Gnardog,36,Mon Jun 1 21:51:33 2015 UTC,Worse.
weeabootales,384j56,KuroiKaze,10,Mon Jun 1 21:55:50 2015 UTC,well you wouldn't use anata or desu typically in that sentence...so I'm gonna say worse.
weeabootales,384j56,oneofmywhitefriends,-3,Mon Jun 1 22:03:46 2015 UTC,"really? why not? I thought anata meant you, wa is particle, and then desu was the ending like ""am, are, is, etc"" forgive me if im wrong, only in year 2 japanese and really brain dead rn."
weeabootales,384j56,InfestedNerd,7,Mon Jun 1 22:16:30 2015 UTC,"It is correct but it kind of sounds weird. I'm not that much more advanced than you in the language but I think just ""baka"" does the trick, without all the other stuff (you'd drop it in regular conversation anyway I think; whether you were calling someone an idiot or giving them a compliment)  Source: I've watched a lot of anime and I know a lot about Japan, totally, you clueless bakas!"
weeabootales,384j56,Pennwisedom,5,Mon Jun 1 22:49:51 2015 UTC,"That's formal. If you're gonna call someone an idiot, it's going to be on casual speech. It'd be ""anta baka"" our something like that (it has been awhile)."
weeabootales,384j56,KuroiKaze,-1,Mon Jun 1 23:03:35 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see. I'm pretty good with vocab, just need to learn when to use what forms so I sound natural. Thank you for the lesson :)"
weeabootales,384j56,Doooooduh,3,Mon Jun 1 23:11:08 2015 UTC,"Perhaps more importantly, using anata sounds more unnatural as the first and second person pronouns are dropped most of the time, unless the ""you"" or ""i""-ness of the sentence needs to be clarified or emphasized."
weeabootales,384j56,UnchainedMundane,3,Mon Jun 1 23:26:03 2015 UTC,"The Japanese don't really use ""you"" the way we do in English."
weeabootales,384j56,OneOfTheLost,6,Tue Jun 2 02:42:34 2015 UTC,"Doesn't sound too bad, just the cheek squish thing sounds pretty creepy and borderline violating."

weeabootales,384j56,Nerkos09,7,Mon Jun 1 21:41:44 2015 UTC,There's a chance she was just being polite
weeabootales,384j56,thechampionofnothing,-2,Tue Jun 2 03:30:52 2015 UTC,"Nah trust me, she is polite but not like that. She once came up to me during the day and was like, UmaJackson1121, ur hair looks horrible let me fix it."
weeabootales,384j56,oneofmywhitefriends,3,Tue Jun 2 10:24:56 2015 UTC,Number 3 and 4 are a bit awkward. Weeb it up if you want though.

If you don't wanna be embarrassed don't do that shit in public, if you like doing it with your friends by all means go ahead. You're your own person, you decide if you're a weeaboo or not and whether or not you want to change."
weeabootales,384j56,thechampionofnothing,8,Mon Jun 1 22:44:38 2015 UTC,"And you're getting downvoted because people can't stand other people enjoying their hobbies. Positive reinforcement for everyone!  Seriously, sometimes I think this subreddit is for people who desperately want to validate themselves and show they have cool cred by picking on the easiest targets (how many of the ""weeaboos"" we see here act how they do because of a mental deficiency or something, anyway!? surely being obsessed with Naruto does not directly cause you to stab people)"
weeabootales,384j56,LikeIsaidPotato,8,Mon Jun 1 22:52:25 2015 UTC,"To me this subreddit is just comedy. If you can't laugh at yourself, what can you do? Honestly, if you read a story about some obnoxious anime fan and you actually go ""Oh jeez, I better cut down on the amount of anime I watch or the subreddit I lurk will make fun of me!"" then you're denying yourself your hobby to seem cool for practically nobody.  But goddamn weebs can be funny."
weeabootales,384j56,mokoko__,0,Mon Jun 1 23:04:26 2015 UTC,"True true and anyway, I think im good. I dont steal things, or yell, or make fun of other people, and I can appreciate real japanese culture. I'd rather eat zarusoba than pocky any day. ;)"
weeabootales,384j56,RobinLSL,0,Mon Jun 1 23:10:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I believe the majority of people out there are mature enough to not brand you scum of the Earth for liking Japanese cartoons and shit. Just don't do any of the dickish things that weeaboos are said to do, like tell a Japanese person their language is so kyaaawaii~ or stealing shit from anime cons. And the stuff you think may be embarassing if others knew you liked, just keep to yourself. If you have a body pillow or six enjoy them if so so desire, but most people don't wanna hear about that shit. Your personality is not  dependent on the things you're interested in, but rather the way you handle yourself around others. Don't be a dick and watch all the anime in the world who gives a fuck."
weeabootales,384j56,Onefortheisland,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:48:13 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, definitely! I'm not really huge on anime cause I just don't have the patience to watch long TV shows, but I enjoy this subreddit exactly because sometimes I can see a bit of myself in the stories (not among the actual psychos thankfully) and that's what makes it all the more funny.  Limiting your own enjoyment just to increase other people's opinions of you is dumb. Especially for someone like a stranger on the internet. What I meant by validating was the sort of people who immediately call you a weeb for enjoying anime or something in the slightest. Like there was a story a couple of weeks ago I think where a guy talked about some sort of samurai armor or something that he likes, and he seemed knowledgeable about it and somebody told him to ""watch himself"" cause he seemed like a weeaboo. That's just stupid."
weeabootales,384j56,Dragovic,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:10:52 2015 UTC,"Glad I'm not getting downvoted anymore. The shit people will call weeaboo on this site or any site is just ridiculous. Can't provide a link so feel free to think I'm talking shit, but I remember seeing a post (maybe on this sub) 'cringing' that an American guy pursued his dream of becoming an anime animator after being bored with the American cartoon scene. What a weeaboo, right? Omg. To me it just sounded like a guy pursued his dream and got to work on Naruto, one of the biggest anime series out there. So I live by my own definition of what's weeby and others live by theirs.  And if you want a nice short anime, I definitely recommend Gunbuster and FLCL 'cause I'm a dirty fucking weeaboo for liking a few Japanese cartoons, right? ;)"

weeabootales,384j56,Dragovic,5,Tue Jun 2 02:26:45 2015 UTC,Yep it's dweebism
weeabootales,384j56,Onefortheisland,2,Tue Jun 2 08:13:00 2015 UTC,"I think the most defining and ""bad"" aspects of being a weeb is how you talk to people outside your circle of friends. I don't give a damn if you jokingly call certain friends baka, but if you do that with random people then I will think that you're weird"
weeabootales,384j56,Randel55,2,Tue Jun 2 12:25:05 2015 UTC,"Does your friend like having her cheeks squished? If she does not like it or tells you to stop, then for the love of god, stop. I have friends who constantly pat me on the head, ruffle my hair, and tell me I'm cute, and I really hate it. I find it patronizing.  All that aside, I don't know you personally, but you seem to be heading towards weeaboo territory. There's nothing really wrong with that, because you seem self-aware enough to reel yourself in and not make a fool out of yourself or alienate your friends.   Here's a question: if I was to say that I did not like your favorite anime show, how would you react? If your response is to raise your voice, call me names, or resort to any sort of physical violence, then you are definitely a weeaboo. I've noticed that if you dislike anything that a hardcore weeaboo loves, they fly off the handle."
weeabootales,384j56,keegan112099,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:06:08 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that if you dislike anything that a hardcore weeaboo loves, they fly off the handle.    That's not specific weeaboos though. That seems more like a teenager thing in general or it might be a certain type of personality. I'm not sure. I have seen plenty of times where someone who is passionate about something but not very knowledgeable will get offended when someone says they don't like the same thing they like for whatever reason. /r/metal is a good example since it happens regularly. Pretty regularly someone posts their favorite popular entry level metal band and even if people are nice about it and give reasons why they don't like the band, the person will go from calm to angry relativity quickly. It also happens with computer hardware especially when someone suggests something better. That might be a little different though because they put money into it and they're just trying to justify their purchase to themselves."
weeabootales,384j56,unfunnypun,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:57:50 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I'm not really into metal, so (naturally) I didn't know that about the fandom. I can sort of understand trying to justify what some might consider to be a shitty purchase, but at the same time, if you spend your money on something that you like or that works for you, you shouldn't have to justify that to anyone.  I've had a handful of encounters with weeaboos where I've said, ""I don't really like [insert anime here]"" or ""I've never watched [insert anime here]"" and had them fly off the handle and yell at me like I'd just insulted their mother."
weeabootales,384j56,LordQill,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:10:40 2015 UTC,The same reaction happens with newer metalheads when people don't like their favorite band or when you tell them their favorite band isn't metal which they seem to take as a personal attack. Usually those types listen to bands that are borderline metal so it's actually debatable and other times they just assume anything with distorted guitars or screaming is metal so I've seen people get riled up over Nirvana not being considered metal.

weeabootales,384j56,8works,0,Tue Jun 2 19:01:55 2015 UTC,"Well, as long as she's OK with it, then it's not an issue.  I've told all of my friends that I really don't like being patted on the head, and most of them are cool with it. Some of them are like, ""but it's a compliment!"" It really doesn't feel like one, though. To me, it feels like I'm being treated like a puppy or a kitten instead of a person.  But, all that aside, if your friend's cool with it and if it's this little in-joke thing that you two share, than that's ok."
weeabootales,3821gv,acheliaHD,31,Mon Jun 1 07:49:44 2015 UTC,I want to know the bad thing she did.
weeabootales,3821gv,devastationz,68,Mon Jun 1 08:05:47 2015 UTC,"Long story short she spent weeks flirting heavily with my best friend (not in the story) kissing him and holding hands, heavy petting in front of people. Had one drink with him one night in the house and came upstairs yet again with him. Her room was right next to mine and walls were super thin. Lots of giggling and heard him ask 'are you sure?' And she replied yes. They ended up doing a sexual act which was very much enjoyed by the sounds of things (I REALLY didn't want to hear). Lots of squeaking bed springs. Next morning she ran into my room waking me up.  Started saying in a very calm voice, laughing, saying she was going to call the police and say he'd raped her. So despite me trying to talk sensibly to her and finding out what she said had happened, police were called. She told me to stay in the room with her and again she was laughing saying he'd raped her, and then she grew incredibly quiet when told she needed a rape kit. She told the police that she had a boyfriend (she did) and that he was to hear about it purely as a violent rape. Anyway I was called to give a statement down at the station and I told them honestly about her behaviour with him in the weeks before and what I'd heard in the room, including what they were saying to each other.   So anyway my best friend was arrested and charged. Before finding out if he would be doing jail time or not, he turned on me saying he knew I had a part in it and to this day he's not spoken to me since so I've no idea what happened. Friends A and B refused to discuss it after we moved out (around 2 weeks after the 'incident'). I didn't take her accusation lightly as it may have happened despite everything I'd seen and heard. I've actually been in a situation where, well I'd rather not go into it but she reacted far far differently and nonchalantly than myself and others have done. So it felt like a slap in the face that she'd accuse the closest person to me at the time, and ruined his life. Plus just having him arrested and possibly making a serious false accusation. I don't know. I just felt seriously sick when I looked at her, for several reasons."

weeabootales,3821gv,Chiafriend12,16,Mon Jun 1 15:06:43 2015 UTC,That sounds awful but can you clarify something for me?  She came into your room the day after and she said that she was going to claim he raped her?  And did you mention that to the police?
weeabootales,3821gv,THEDEADNOISE,23,Mon Jun 1 11:39:23 2015 UTC,"She did indeed say that and yes, I told the police everything I knew regarding the situation, including the fact she told me that. The police were really nice towards me and made me feel like anything I said would be incredibly useful. I wouldn't have lied to them even if I had been close friends with Weebface."
weeabootales,3821gv,navronia,9,Mon Jun 1 12:44:12 2015 UTC,"What happened to your friend that was accused? Did she get caught for lying? Because she literally told you her plan, how could she get away with that?"
weeabootales,3821gv,Konaren,12,Mon Jun 1 16:30:45 2015 UTC,"I do not know. She blocked me from her phone and whatever social media I used at the time. Friends A and B would absolutely not tell me anything regarding the outcome despite the fact they did indeed know. And apart from those two and my best friend, I don't think anyone actually knew what was going on. Certainly don't know as to whether her boyfriend was told the whole story and I hope he's out of the relationship now."

weeabootales,3821gv,hyperlogical,2,Wed Jun 17 02:01:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm absolutely certain that's why she made up the entire thing.

weeabootales,3884o0,Pennwisedom,2,Tue Jun 2 19:31:56 2015 UTC,Well a weeaboo is what you are plus the obnoxious traits lol
weeabootales,3884o0,ChVcky_Thats_me,18,Tue Jun 2 18:00:49 2015 UTC,In japan an Otaku is a word for creep. It's an insult.
weeabootales,3884o0,Pennwisedom,9,Tue Jun 2 15:40:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm aware.  In the west however, it seems to be a borrowed term to describe someone who likes anime a lot and considers it a hobby but isn't absolutely obnoxious about it."
weeabootales,3884o0,Slobbering_manchild,6,Tue Jun 2 15:43:24 2015 UTC,"It can be used that way, but it's not specifically used that way. And people in Japan certainly self-identify as Otaku. It's not much different than how ""nerd"" can have a negative connotation but these days that's not always the case, and people self-identify as one as well."
weeabootales,3884o0,Pennwisedom,2,Tue Jun 2 18:53:42 2015 UTC,Being a nerd is more acceptable in the US than being an Otaku in Japan I think
weeabootales,3884o0,Slobbering_manchild,4,Tue Jun 2 19:10:23 2015 UTC,"I think you're right that nerd is more acceptable. I mean, hot girls can call themselves nerds and no one bats an eye really. But according to this survey (in Japanese), from 2013, around 42% of the 100,000 people surveyed self-identified as an Otaku. Which is pretty good in suggesting the stigma of the term has largely disappeared, at least among the younger generations.  From about 2000-2010 I think a lot happened to get rid of the Stigma. For one, Miyazaki Hayao won an Oscar for Spirited Away while Murakami Takashi received international attention for his art, among other things. And in 2005, ""Moe"" was even named one of the top Japanese buzzwords of the year.  Anyway, this on the other hand is way too nerdy and way more than I intended to write about this."
weeabootales,3884o0,Pennwisedom,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:29:30 2015 UTC,"There is still a huge amount of stigma. My japanese friends essentially use the word ""otaku"" as a connotation for ""loser"" That survey just means more nerds in concentration"
weeabootales,3884o0,UmaJackson1121,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:22:59 2015 UTC,"As I mentioned somewhere, certainly there are still some people who do. Certainly a survey of 100,000 people gives more of a broad answer to the general perception than how one person uses it.   Taro Aso, the former PM of Japan, and currently Deputy PM, has even referred to himself as an Otaku on numerous occasions. It is hard to believe that if the negative connotation of the word was still strong, any high-ranking politician would call themselves it."
weeabootales,3884o0,Pennwisedom,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:37:22 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Maybe because of the huge increase in ""otaku"" people, he's trying to appeal to the masses?"

weeabootales,3884o0,Dragovic,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:48:05 2015 UTC,well....not exactly. Nerd has become cool but otaku still pretty much means filthy creep in japanese. Especially after the otaku murders.
weeabootales,3884o0,Dragovic,3,Tue Jun 2 19:10:16 2015 UTC,"Yea, those happened 27 years ago by a guy who was quite clearly insane. He blamed his actions on a ""rat man.""   Even though the media did play up on the fear of Otaku in the late 80s by going out of their way to talk about his collection of anime and manga, and especially porn, though the porn was probably highlighted even more than it really mattered, almost three decades later I'm not sure it's all that relevant."

If you wan't to use anime pictures for your profile go ahead, who cares ?   The main issue with weeaboofaggotry is personal. If you let cartoons get in the way of your social life, self confidence, identity, personal hygiene, etc, etc, or allow anime to skew your perception on your own cultural identity because 'anything that isn't Japanese is inferior'; THEN you are a weeaboo.   Your profile picture has nothing to do with it. mandokir can go fuck himself."

weeabootales,3817y2,blitz_omlet,23,Mon Jun 1 14:08:50 2015 UTC,Clearly that guy was looking for a reply and he found it. It was your avatar instead of something relevant. Good for him.  I mean you're gonna get people with an axe to grind calling you a weeb for even a passing interest in anime. If that kind of thing bothers you then you probably shouldn't say or do anything that anyone who's a jerk could disagree with. The full on weebs are pathetic but they probably don't care that normal people find them contemptible. You should find a middle ground where you have what you'd consider a healthy obsession but you recognise people like that youtube commenter as something to be ignored or mocked.

weeabootales,3817y2,THEDEADNOISE,20,Mon Jun 1 16:08:22 2015 UTC,"OP, I think it's honestly fine if you find a character attractive. Attractive in itself it a pretty broad term. I find many characters attractive, in a sense their designs, the way their drawn are cool and shit.   Honestly, I think some people in this sub just associates anything anime related to weebs. When attractive western cartoon characters exist. Jessica Rabbit. No one really says anything when she gets brought up in threads related to sexy characters. But suddenly it's an issue when the character is from a Japanese cartoon.   As long as you don't have delusions of her being your waifu and yelling out badly pronounced Japanese. You're okay OP, don't take what other people say seriously.   Especially on YouTube."
weeabootales,3817y2,ButcherBlues,2,Tue Jun 2 02:23:58 2015 UTC,"Do whatever you want and enjoy whatever you like, I honestly think simply calling someone a weeb is more cringe worthy than being one, especially considering most of the time the term is fairly misused.  If you really enjoy the character as you say and simply find it aesthetically pleasing there really isn't any harm done, but if you are like me with a $100 figure staring you down as you type this out, you probably need some help. :P"
weeabootales,3817y2,fyreNL,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:17:04 2015 UTC,I dont think that makes you a weeb though. People spend a lot of money on different hobbies and interests. Look at people spending thousands on a guitar or spending hundreds on a rare game cartridge. I believe to be a true weeaboo that you need to lack social skills and defining yourself with your hobby (kind of like bronies in a sense).

I have a lot of social awkwardness and my friends know to call me on it. I hate talking to people on the phone and I'll call someone, relay the important info, and hang up without letting them talk.

weeabootales,37b00w,redemptionquest,3,Wed May 27 13:08:32 2015 UTC,"Definitely agreed with /u/Pennwisedom - by the time you hit third year Japanese, there's a lot less of this type of behaviour from students. Get in touch with the dean like everyone suggests.   In the meantime, another thing you could do is see whether or not your uni has a conversation club for practicing Japanese. Many have such an opportunity, but if yours doesn't, start your own?!   I don't know the exact process, but I do know there are also ways to get Japanese tutoring on Skype or participate in a language exchange program too (you help someone practice English, they help you with Japanese.)"

weeabootales,37b00w,TampopoCat,5,Thu Jun 4 06:01:40 2015 UTC,"This really sucks, especially when he said ""I didn't really have anything planned."" It seems like your best bet will be to videotape some of what's happening in the class, discreetly.  Talk with a dean or superior about you concerns, and THEN ask if they would like to see what is happening in the course, and offer to film the course. Do not say that you have video. If they agree to allow it, film again. If they come into the class, there might not be as much room for fucking up. But again, find someone who's involved and is trying to help students.  This is one of those places where your education is suffering, and unfortunately there isn't much accountability.   If Nobody seems to help you out: Keep pushing on getting more people aware of what's going on. If there's any social media presence for your school, anonymously post the videos. Send them to college sites as well as forums for language.  I had similar problems at my college, and had to get the dean's attention about the fact that a department head was quite apathetic about certain issues. The department head has retired and been replaced."

If someone was to casually tell you, ""I'm not a big fan of DBZ,"" and it made you furious, I'd say you were a weeaboo (I'd also tell you to get a life). You seem pretty chill, though.

Originally and most strictly, it is someone that views Japan as some kind of superior utopia. Basically blind patriotism for a foreign country. Really strange. You're not that kind of weeb.  More broadly people use it to mean an anime fan who doesn't properly hide his power level. He tries to work anime into a conversation with random people like it was the weather or the baseball game last night. Or maybe he has a lewd anime background open on his laptop in the middle of a lecture. If you're not presenting your anime hobby to people in an obnoxious and unwanted way, you're not this kind of weeb.  Even more broadly people use it to mean an anime fan who likes things that they don't. It's mostly shounenfags and moefags slinging shit at each other. I wouldn't take it too seriously.  And most broadly of all people will use ""weeaboo"" to mean anyone who likes anime. Unfortunately, you're this kind of weeb. Welcome to the club."

Though the threatening thing is common in a lot of shows and I knew a lot of non weebs who used to pull that shit. Really pissed me off but the ones who keep it up are usually weebs.

weeabootales,36xa4u,Iorith,5,Sat May 23 02:29:28 2015 UTC,"Hello, so I graduated from a relatively small high school in Florida. This is the story of a girl, let's call her R. R was a pretty typical female weeaboo, she tried to work japanese into her conversations as much as possible, only ate japanese snacks, memorized and sang japanese songs (which she did at the talent show but that's more cringe than anything) etc.  Well before I even knew that such annoying people existed within the anime community, R, myself, and my friend who introduced her to me all decided to try and make an anime club. I was excited about this because I only knew of two people who liked anime and wanted some more friends so we could have discussions, debates, and just generally shared an interest.  We finally got the school to approve of our club and I was incredibly excited, until the next day. When we showed up to school that next morning there were posters, banners, and comic stops all over school advertising the club, but this advertisements showed (made by R) showed her, myself and my friend drawn in the anime style with our names under each character, these pictures mostly showed cliche anime situations with some romantic undertones. The posters were embarrassing, but I let it slide.   Fast forward a week and we have the first meeting. I was incredibly excited, but what I found was repulsive and disappointing. All those that showed up were the social outcasts, the kids that made you feel dirty just by looking at them, the kids who yell random catch phrases in class, the kids who can't separate their fantasy world from reality. I didn't attend anymore meetings after the first one and tried to separate myself from that group, especially R, as much as possible.  Come to find out a few weeks later they were having presidential elections between R and another weeb girl and the other was more popular among the group. She one sided won the election for president and R fell silent for a few days. 3 or 4 days after the election when I got to school there were cop cars out in front of the school, and R was sitting in the back of it. Turns out that morning she confronted the girl the she lost the election to and put a knife to her throat threatening to kill her and all the others who didn't vote for her, she was taken down and the knifes (turns out she had four on her person) were taken away from her until the cops showed up. Skip ahead to today and she got her punishment, two years on house arrest and 13 years on probation.   TL;DR: Weeb got pissed and tried to kill another weeb at school.   Sorry,  I don't mean to be rude, but I tried to format a bit."

weeabootales,36rr7b,starryophonic,15,Fri May 22 03:39:03 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure a decent amount of them are fake or just exaggerated which is what you should expect from all tales subs but they're entertaining and for the most part  believable enough considering what they're about. It would be pretty hard to verify basically all of these since a large amount of them take place years before this sub became a thing. Most seem to take place in the 2000's when anime was really popular. Even for the newer ones, what could be posted to verify them?   A lot of stories involve people who look normal at first so just a picture of them wouldn't work. To verify those stories it'd require people to take out their phones and start recording in the middle of what's happening which would probably ruin the story since everyone would stop to ask the OP why they're recording it. For the ones that dress like weeaboos, what can we do to verify that it's actually them and not just a random person taken from Facebook or something?   The OP only has to change the description of the weeaboo or even easier, not include one and just use the picture as one. It sounds like you'd prefer /r/cringeanarchy to this sub. They have a decent amount of weeaboo video posts mixed in with bronies, furries and general cringey videos. They're not stories, they're just people being cringey."

weeabootales,36k7si,SpikeRosered,6,Wed May 20 16:09:05 2015 UTC,I believe they use high explosive rounds rather than armour piercing Sabot rounds. It also mentions the inner shell of the completion tanks is some kind of indestructible layer of Carbon. (Not super far fetched.)

weeabootales,36k7si,kpoed,3,Thu May 21 02:20:34 2015 UTC,"The H35 actually makes sense when you look at how it was meant to be used. See, France was convinced that WWII would play out exactly like WWI. Hence the Maginot Line and the entire Battle of France playing out like it did, but I digress. The H35 was never meant for tank on tank combat or fast paced combat in general. It was meant to be a mobile pillbox that could advance alongside infantry across No Man's Land. The 37mm gun was more like a grenade launcher than an actual tank gun, meant for taking out machine gun nests. It was meant for a slow, plodding sort of warfare. The slower pace meant that one man could more effectively take on more roles. Unfortunately for France, The Ardennes  is a place and WWII was nothing like WWI. Obviously. The H35 still managed to be pretty useful, though, which is really cool."

weeabootales,36k7si,CaptHayes,-2,Thu May 21 07:48:13 2015 UTC,It's pretty much the same as to why I don't like KanColle. It's girls who skate on water and fight other girls with battleship weapons...  It's just a problem I have with those kinds of anime where they have a all female cast and slap something theme on it (KanColle = Battleships; Girls and Panzer = Tanks; Strike Witches = Dogfights).

I wish there was a foolproof way to weed out people like skinnyweeb from ever visiting Japan for any reason.  I'm also a little surprised that the host family has 1 daughter, and they are hosting 2 boys. It seems like they would want to have host families with a child of the same gender as their guest, precisely to avoid the kind of behavior that skinnyweeb and his ilk will bring."
weeabootales,36fwmf,Wunderbliss,16,Tue May 19 02:46:45 2015 UTC,They had other kids but they were all at college. Also they actually requested boys so I don't think they really expected a skinnyweeb.

weeabootales,36i6g8,Wazard,8,Tue May 19 16:13:47 2015 UTC,"From the looks of it, you at least used to be a weeb.   I think anybody who gets into anime, at least at a young age, goes through a bit of a weeb phase. I started reading manga when I was in middle school, and I wanted to move to Japan because I was convinced it was an animoo paradise.   Currently in college and still planning to move to Japan, but it's more so because I want to explore the country and learn the language. Somewhat because I'm slightly frustrated with certain aspects of my own culture."

weeabootales,36i6g8,WS6Grumbles,3,Tue May 19 21:09:04 2015 UTC,"No, having animes you like and foreign cultures that interest you don't make you a weeaboo.  I like cowboy bebop, Samurai Champloo, anything by studio Ghibli.  Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese cultures are all very neat and interesting.  But I don't base my life on it, I don't have some fanciful version of each country living in my head based on a weird anti-american inferiority complex, and I don't take my interests and hobbies as carte blanche to act like a dipshit in public.  If you do none of these things, you are most likely not a weeaboo."
weeabootales,36i6g8,WS6Grumbles,1 point,Fri May 22 02:35:25 2015 UTC,I suppose what makes a weeabo is more of how they act and express their thoughts and feelings apposed to their core interests and wants.
