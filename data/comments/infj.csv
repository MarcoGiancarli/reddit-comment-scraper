infj,3e5jb0,andtherobots,3,Wed Jul 22 03:01:16 2015 UTC,"This is just my opinion, so take it with a grain of salt.  You are extremely lucky to have someone close who reminds you to be proud of your accomplishments. I think my reasoning behind this statement is self-explanatory.  I am en route to my graduate level education too, and I am constantly reminded by my mentors to do everything ""in moderation."" Productivity is one thing, depletion is another. BUT I don't think you're an asshole for tirelessly pursuing for something MORE. I am right there with you on that mentality, I'm never satisfied although almost everyone around me jeer at that. You are not selfish for further developing yourself, I think it's admirable.  Having said these things, your take on celebration is completely reasonable. However, think of it as a favor, a compromise even, to show appreciation toward your significant other purely due to respect. I'm sure you can empathize with the disappointment one can have when having mentally and physically prepared to do something nice for somebody and the receiver scoffs at the whole thing.  Lastly, YES I also feel that my accomplishments are nothing but a single line on my resume. I feel like the process and experience is far more important than the products that follow, but even then everything is just an assignment. But I would like to suggest appreciating the pats on the back, good jobs, the thoughts. There are times when I desperately want affirmation that I'm doing something right, and, when it's not there, it's devastating sometimes."
infj,3e5jb0,shinbum,2,Wed Jul 22 03:31:56 2015 UTC,"I look at it all as learning experiences. I accomplish something but that might help me step to something more difficult. Running a small organization in college geared me up to be a founder of a non profit years later, even though I didn't plan out my life that way when I did it.  I have a constant ""more more more"" desire I can't turn off.   As far as graduation, congrats!! I walked when I got my degree because I worked very hard and all those people were going to see me up there and clap, dammit! It was for my parents too, they were proud."
infj,3e2g3t,candypanes,10,Tue Jul 21 13:09:48 2015 UTC,"One of my closest friends is INTP. The main thing about them is that they are always thinking about the most logical thing to do in a situation, so if you explain why your side of an argument makes sense, they will have more respect for your argument.  Also, INTPs have very strong feelings about things, but those feelings make them ""feel weird"". I usually have to call my friend out on things because he will act a certain way and not even realize why, it's almost like I have to tell him what he wants or he won't realize it sometimes."
infj,3e2g3t,KStreetFighter2,6,Tue Jul 21 13:19:37 2015 UTC,"In agreement with /KStreetFighter2 on this. My husband is an INTP,  his way of understanding things is to deconstruct. In the beginning of our relationship there were a couple times I felt I was defending the way I felt about things, but then one day he explained why he did things this way. It made sense, and from that point on I never took it personally. I changed my perspective to see the benefit of deconstructing my ideas. I enjoy his logic and find it to be very beneficial, because when I am trying to explain things to others I am not usually speaking with INFJ types, therefore I feel communicating with an INTP on a regular basis has taught me how to better communicate my feelings to others. I want my feelings to make sense, I don't want to come off as emotional, I want my feelings,ideas and thoughts to have a solid foundation.  Then there are certain things that he will never understand, the things that maybe only another INFJ would understand. For this I just realize that I am an INFJ and I don't expect him or anyone else to understand those things."
infj,3e2g3t,petersyummyyummy,3,Tue Jul 21 15:42:38 2015 UTC,"I have been dating an INTP for a little over a year now, and I know what you mean about the communication issues. I think a key to overcoming this is a desire to understand the other person's point of view (and recognizing that it's built on a different foundation than yours). I've been in many conversations with my SO where he'll say something that's super logical and feels so disconnected from my own reasonings. Instead of having an internal ""omg I'm dating a robot this will never work"" crisis, I've learned to ask questions in an attempt to understand the root and process behind that super logical statement. I feel like it helps.  It's a two-way street, though. Maybe not in terms of curiosity (I feel like I'm naturally more curious than my SO about the inner workings of everyone's mind), but in terms of respect and appreciation. For the most part, he listens to and appreciates my perspective on things, even if it doesn't quite line up with his. There have been a handful of times (admittedly during emotional outbursts on my part) where he has discounted my feelings because (I sense) he sees them as being totally irrational. That hasn't felt great. But on the whole, things are good and I really enjoy our dynamic, even though it takes some work."
infj,3e1qq9,medbb,16,Tue Jul 21 07:51:48 2015 UTC,"Same. I tend to door slam easily too. I have a few close friends and people I do rely on, but no one to really call best friend... which sucks, because most of my close friends have best friends of their own, but I'm not one of them, ya feel?   I kind of just deal with it. I don't really want to dwell on ""labels"" because I get bitter easily and it's pointless."

I never understood this. I never ranked my true friends by calling one best etc. If you were able to make it to the stage where I call you a friend to begin with, then you all are my best friends. I have 4 true friends that I've known for different amount of times and I wouldn't dare rank them. They are special to me in their own different ways."
infj,3e1qq9,thatguyhere92,9,Wed Jul 22 00:56:42 2015 UTC,"I was more lonely than alone during high school and college, too. But things got better.  There isn't a formula for making friends, much less for ""best"" friend, but I sometimes feel the need to open up first before the counterpart in order to create some kind of a link. It took a tremendous amount of courage--maybe desperation too--to do this at first, but some accept the courage with grace.  I think some INFJs would agree that they secretly want everyone to like them. As friends, acquaintances, or etc.. There will always be someone who likes you and who hates you for no reason. You can neither disappoint nor please everybody."
infj,3e1qq9,shinbum,6,Tue Jul 21 10:26:25 2015 UTC,"Realized something the other day when talking to my close friend (ESFP). We have a lot different standards and ideas of what a bestfriend is compared to everyone else. My suggestion before doing anything is to be close with someone but remove yourself from marking them ""best"". You create that hierarchy of one friend over another, which can make unhealthy boundries and expectations. Second, take a look at your friend circle through someone elses eyes."

infj,3e1qq9,islander85,4,Tue Jul 21 10:05:18 2015 UTC,"I feel you. My best friend since the third grade dropped me senior year of high school. We didn't go to prom together, we didn't graduate together, we didn't start college together like we had planned when we were kids. I've lived life without a ""best friend"" since then and it sucks. I'm close to my sister (she's four years younger than me) so I hang out with her a lot but it's not the same as having an actual best friend. I tried to make friends with co-workers but it never works (it did once, and I still text her a lot but she moved 200 miles away so fml.) My idea of having fun is going to an art gallery, coffee shops, sitting around listening to music and being on Tumblr. Most people my age are too busy going to the bars and trying to take someone home. It's hard to find someone to hang out with. Maybe try joining clubs? My boyfriend is the complete opposite of me and he's at an internship in California right now. He joined a baseball team right off the bat and now has like six new friends. I don't know how he does it, but he's never not had friends because of his personality. Taking a page out of his book, maybe just go for it and hope for the best? I know that's not the most comfortable way to go about things but it could work. And if it doesn't, you can always retreat into your room and forget it ever happened."

infj,3e1qq9,jmdugan,3,Tue Jul 21 19:53:24 2015 UTC,"I 100% know how you feel. I have the exact same issues. I had the realization the other day that I have many people that consider me their best friend but I feel like I don't have a best friend. The reasoning is because I put in a lot of effort towards them, show I care, am always there to lend an ear or shoulder to cry on, I get to know them on a personal level, and I genuinely listen and understand them whenever they talk to me. That's never returned to me - which makes me feel lonely/sad so I door slam. The most upsetting part is, they generally just kind of shrug it off or it takes weeks for them to realize I've kind of faded away because they only come around when it's convenient to them. I wish I had advice to give, but I am currently looking how to fix this."

Being a 27 y/o, I figure I can take more risk on as I have longer time frame to make back incurred losses. Here are my picks and reasons in chronological order:   SGLB - A penny stock, so extremely risky. They are in the business of developing in-process quality assurance for the metal 3D printing industry. This is a critical need for the industry to move forward.   QTMM - Another penny stock. They have an efficient way of manufacturing quantum dots, which are basically semiconductors on the nano-scale with potential applications across all industries. Currently they are used to make quantum dot TVs.   CGNX - I smartened up and decided to lay off the penny stocks. I invested in Cognex because I believe that the demand for industrial automation will grow significantly in the next few years. Instead of picking an established industrial automation company such as Fanuc or ABB, I decided to invest in a company that made components for these systems. Cognex manufactures machine vision systems, which are an important part of many industrial automation systems.   TSLA - Electric cars, Elon Musk. I'm investing in Elon Musk, you don't come across many visionary CEO's and I missed the boat on Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, so...  HACK - An exchange traded fund (ETF) that tracks the performance of 30 cyber security stocks. Cyber security is a threat that's guaranteed to grow.

infj,3dzv7o,altruisticspring,2,Mon Jul 20 21:43:43 2015 UTC,"It's okay. I did the exact same thing. But to be fair, it's not exactly complicated since it's one of the most common patterns there is."

infj,3dzv7o,SquirmGirl,12,Tue Jul 21 00:34:01 2015 UTC,"Passed. Took me less than a minute.   This might be a tough one for Ni-users   Why? It's testing critical thinking skills (Ti+Te). It has nothing to do with Ni as far as I can tell.  An INTJ could instantly figure this out using Te, and would most likely consider this very basic problem solving. INFJ has Ti lower in it's stack, so it might need a bit more time, but ultimately should be able to solve it. Younger INFJs may fail because they haven't had enough time to develop Ti.  I would think inferior Ti-users (EXFJ) and inferior Te-users (IXFP) are going to have the most difficulty with problems like these. Not Ni-doms."
infj,3dzv7o,SquirmGirl,3,Mon Jul 20 23:44:07 2015 UTC,"Well, the test is not so much about figuring out the sequence, but the confirmation bias. Most MBTI literature points to Ni making an initial assumption based on patterns and pre-conceived data and then tests it via Ti to see if it's consistent. That's exactly what this test is for. It makes the point that most people will see the pattern of doubles, assume the answer is ""each number is a double of the one before it"", and then test that hypothesis. The ""real"" answer is much simpler than that: each number is greater in value than the one before it. Doubles can fit into that system, but it's not the ""real"" answer.   The Ti was never the issue, since that could test and verify any hypothesis for consistent logic. Where people would get hung up is having a more complicated Ni theory to begin with (that it's doubles based on the initial pattern) and then use Ti confirm it."
infj,3dzv7o,thom_bjorke,3,Tue Jul 21 00:55:26 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's just the wording, but I don't fully understand what you're getting at. Are you saying that because Ni has a preference for over-complicating the complexity of things, this particular problem may be difficult for Ni-doms? Because the problem itself is actually quite simple?  Personally, I didn't actually use Ni much when I solved this problem. I jumped straight into Ti. But, that might have been based more on my current circumstances. I've been having to ""relearn"" a lot of math for school, which for me, involves an exhausting amount of use from Ti. Not so much from Ni, as far as I can tell.  I mean, I see others commenting that the reason they didn't get it right off the bat was because they assumed the solution was more complicated than it actually was, so that would certainly make sense..."
infj,3dzv7o,trkeprester,4,Tue Jul 21 01:10:02 2015 UTC,"What I meant is that Ni usually assumes the ""correct"" answer first, and then uses Ti or Te to back up the initial assumption.  Ni doesn't imply over-complicating, but it does tend to seek patterns. Therefore, by seeing the initial patterns of doubles, Ni might say, ""oh, I bet it has something to do with doubles"" and then tests that logic with a string of sequences using Ti (in the case of INFJs).  If those all confirm, then it probably assumes it made the correct guess. That's why I said Ni might have a problem, if people see the pattern they could jump to confirm it without looking further.    In contrast, Ne usually assumes nothing, and then tries a variety of combinations to see what happens and what it likes best."

infj,3dzv7o,naikii,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:13:59 2015 UTC,"And again you fall victim to confirmation bias. You took a single point of information about me, that I posted in an INFJ thread, and immediately assumed because of this that I was an INFJ.  If you had explored other possibilities, found extra pieces of information to back up your assumption you may have learnt differently.   For instance in this thread before I responded to you I stated I was an ENTP,  and a quick check of my post history would have given you that extra piece of information you needed to prove your initial assumption wrong."
infj,3dzv7o,Horouto,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:48:12 2015 UTC,"Indeed I did fall for it there, I'll admit.I did indeed question myself several times in 11 seconds, I don't see why that would not be a possibility. I realize I fell in that ""78%"", that's not news. Still hypocrisy. I am familiar with psychological bias tests."
infj,3dzv7o,naikii,2,Wed Jul 22 01:18:27 2015 UTC,"Well actually it’s not the same, and there isn’t any hypocrisy involved.  The goal of the test was never to prove that you could provide the correct answer, as the test itself was easy. In fact they tell you outright that even a child can find the answer. Instead, the goal was for you to demonstrate that you can think critically and in an unbiased way, to test your assumption, and weren’t afraid of hitting a few wrong combinations along the way before coming to the final thought-out solution.  Questioning yourself ‘several times’ (presumably in your mind as your original post says you only submitted a single answer in 11 seconds) before submitting an answer falls into the exact trap the article was trying to demonstrate. You looked at the initial sequence of numbers, made an assumption that you knew the solution, and then confirmed your assumption with a single test. This is far too few observations to actually know whether your answer was correct. You fell victim to confirmation bias.  The test goes on to explain that 78% (at the time of this writing) of people who took the test guessed a final solution without hearing a single ‘no’. You are part of this 78%, except worse, because you only made a single test of your initial assumption and then jumped to a radical conclusion based on a single ‘yes’ response. It may have been correct on this occasion, but this doesn’t demonstrate your skill, critical thinking or problem solving ability, it demonstrates a hunch backed up with a whole bunch of luck.  My response is not hypocritical because I am not making an assumption about what you did and then jumping to a conclusion based on limited information. I am taking the fact that you stated “Got it on my first try, it was quite obvious to me. It took me 11 seconds or so of contemplation…” to tell you that yes, you may have guessed the rule, but you failed the test by falling victim to confirmation bias and not properly testing your assumption as was the intent of the article."
infj,3dzv7o,Horouto,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:41:09 2015 UTC,"it's perfectly normal to contemplate a lot in 11 seconds , contemplation time should be judged relative to the task. Every person will have their own pace of thoughts.I don't subvocalize while thinking especially on timed tests like IQ tests and such. While I do agree luck did play a huge role , as I was throwing my theory of the test out there. What I fail to understand is how did I fall for the confirmation bias during the test? The conformation bias by definition is a tendency to only look at the information that confirms your perception and ignore the rest. By entering the numbers themselves , I went against that bias as I was trying to disconfirm my initial theory about the test, that was my intention. The perfect example of me falling to the bias would be what I just did . Despite me noticing you not having a flair ( that tells a lot) and despite me seeing you on r/entp regularly. I ignored all of that and focused on the ""this is r/infj"" piece of information. You are still being completely hypocritical as you're acting on as much information as I am, because you are falling to the bias itself. You're interpreting the set of information that you have in way that only confirms your assumption, and you aren't even bothering to look at the other side. This website is actually running the test completely wrong. The proper way to do this test would be to actually guess the rule and not ENTER numbers that apply to the rule to confirm that you actually know the rule. Because the rule itself applies to many patterns , for example : I in my head could be thinking ""Oh they're all multiple of 2s!"" and just enter that 22-24-26 and it would still apply. (FYI I entered 2 even numbers and one odd number to try to falsify my initial impression which was exactly the one stated above)  Let me get this straight , one of the 100s the cognitive biases is to not be able to detect them in yourself and only in others. We are (both of us ) falling to MANY of them right now.I suggest you read this if you haven't yet , quite interesting. I use it for reference:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases#Social_biases"
infj,3dzv7o,theperfectpineapple,2,Wed Jul 22 01:59:13 2015 UTC,"I feel like your arguments are like watching a train-wreck in motion.  I am going to break it down for you in steps.  You looked at the numbers and took a guess at what the rule might be. This is your initial assumption.  You tested your assumption once by putting numbers in the boxes and hitting check.  You received a single Yes/No response. You then used this response as confirmation of your original assumption and provide your answer after a single attempt. This is called confirmation bias because it is impossible to come up with the correct solution after a single guess and a single Yes/No response. You did not test your theory effectively and critically. Instead you used the single response you received to confirm your original assumption rather than testing other possibilities that could disprove your initial assumption  Additionally you are still confused as to the purpose of the test and the article, you state;  “This website is actually running the test completely wrong. The proper way to do this test would be to actually guess the rule and not ENTER numbers that apply to the rule to confirm that you actually know the rule…” The test is not about the end, it is about the means. That is, the test was not about you proving you could find the rule, it is not about the rule at all. It was about you demonstrating that you could use an effective method to determine the rule. It was to point out that so often important decisions are made without proper information and based on assumptions and bias.  This was not a test to prove how smart you are, and how quickly you could solve the rule. No matter how much of a ‘Wannabe genius’ you may be.  And what’s more you are still making assumptions, and still falling to your confirmation bias, even after admitting that you made an incorrect assumption that just because I posted on an INFJ forum I was that type. This time you assumed that because I told you that I was an ENTP, and you knew now that I at least occasionally post in MBTI forums, that I had posted in the ENTP forum. In fact you went as far as to say that you now recognise me and that I post there often, when I have never posted there at all. In fact this is another type of bias called False Memory, and is on the link you provided under the ‘Memory errors and biases’ heading.  And again, a simple look at my post history, and collecting a little more information would have proved your newest assumption wrong."

I have had enough of his emotional back and forth of I'm a friend, to I'm the scourge of humanity because I'm stupid. So I un-friended him and haven't talked to him   If he has a history of doing this, it would appear to me that your friend is the one who is being oversensitive. As far as I can tell, you're not in the wrong for dropping him as a friend. If it isn't worth the trouble, you shouldn't feel obligated.   Yet my best friend who introduced us says I'm being irrational and should suck it up to hang out with them.    That's a little vague. What does he mean by ""irrational?"" Hanging out with someone you don't get along with sounds far less rational to me. Maybe you could tell him that to get him off your back?"
infj,3e0sip,ShellyMarsh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:36:36 2015 UTC,I guess I was trying to justify hanging out with him because my friends did. It was maybe juvenile to think hanging out with an angry person could be beneficial because my friends did.
infj,3e0sip,ShellyMarsh,3,Tue Jul 21 03:48:52 2015 UTC,"I've gotten to the point where I refuse to hang out with people that treat me poorly or make me feel bad about myself. You have to be around these kinds of people sometimes, but in general, I'm just not going to spend my free time around people that make me unhappy. That's not good for anybody.   I don't agree with your friend telling you to ""suck it up and hang out with him."" Why have friends if they're just going to berate you and treat you like dirt? Your friends should be the people that make you happy, challenge you in a positive way, and raise you up to be a better person.   It sounds like you handled the situation well. No drama, you just separated yourself."
infj,3e0sip,MrJudzey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:23:17 2015 UTC,"before he went silent and eventually after another 10, apologized   That leads me to believe he meant nothing personal. He seems very passionate about his beliefs and doesn't have a good hold of his emotions when conveying his opinions. Berating someone because they hold a different view than you is a very weak way to have an argument also very easy to dish out insults. I presume he did try to argue his points at least.  Not only that, but you guys hit it off pretty well in the beginning. It's okay when people don't agree with you and sometimes instead of shutting them out, show them how to separate logical reasoning with emotional convictions. In terms of irrational, if you look at it this way: you unfriended someone and refuse to talk to them because they disagree with you, it can seem like you're taking this too personally.  No you don't have to associate with people you don't get along with especially with people who don't respect you. But if that's the case, it's best to leave in a tactful manner instead of shutting down. A simple ""I respect your opinion though different from my own, I hope you would respect mine as well. You're welcome to debate the points of your argument with me, but I will leave if you denounce my character"" or some form of that is sufficient. At that point, if you leave he knows why so if he does want you around, he'll reassess himself. It essentially gives the other person an option within your standards."
infj,3e0sip,inefjay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:40:26 2015 UTC,I didn't un-friend him because we didn't agree. I enjoy a spirited conversation. I disassociated myself from him because his first response was personal attack.
infj,3e0sip,CmdBelial,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:21:50 2015 UTC,"I should have clarified that by saying it was in terms of looking at in the other person's perspective. He doesn't view it as a personal attack, it could just be you disassociating yourself from disagreement for all he knows. Which is why I say you should clarify a situation by verbalizing your thoughts and going even a step further in giving someone a choice.  By all means, you're allowed to cut things off cold turkey. It's just not a tactful approach."

infj,3e1e04,yzmetric,7,Tue Jul 21 05:20:42 2015 UTC,"I'm an INFJ and I don't know where this idea about INFJs being mystical mind readers or counselors comes from. Dominant introverted intuition perceives the external world through Fe, but that doesn't necessarily mean we INFJs have to concern ourself with what others are thinking or feeling. It means we express our Ni through our Fe or information obtained from the external world is Fe which CAN include the feelings or thoughts of other people but not necessarily."
infj,3e1e04,antonybdavies,2,Tue Jul 21 05:56:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with you perfectly, though almost all descriptions on INFJ seem to include a reference or two about some psychic ability that I always end up second-guessing my type just because of that."
infj,3e1e04,Intempestivity,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:26:57 2015 UTC,"It means we express our Ni through our Fe or information obtained from the external world is Fe which CAN include the feelings or thoughts of other people but not necessarily.   True.  I wouldn't even say it includes the feelings or thoughts of other people, but more so the intentions rather than anything else.  I don't presume to know what anyone else feels or thinks, but I can usually tell what their intent is and whether or not they're trying to manipulate me.  I would imagine this is most related to Ni inferences--I'm picking up on subtle body language and tones in the voice.  I keep most people at arm's length for a long while because I want to see what their actions say about them.  Then again, I'm a Questioning INFJ (My Questioning facet in my Thinking-Feeling preferences was out-of-preference), and that means I ask a lot of questions about why things are the way they are and why people behave the way they do.  So it might be that observing/reading people (why are they behaving/talking like that?) and offering advice (what is the problem here--can we solve it?) is more natural for me than it is for other INFJ."
infj,3e1e04,Intempestivity,2,Tue Jul 21 07:37:48 2015 UTC,"Online tests aren't a great measure of MBTI.  I used to test as INTJ in every single online test, but that's because my job has given me well-developed Ti.  When I had an official test administered at work, I was INFJ through and through.  Empathy isn't going out of the way to avoid conflict or having a reaction of compassion, it's the ability to place yourself in someone else's shoes, to be able to momentarily see the world through their eyes.  It sounds like you're conflict-avoidant in the examples you've provided, which is a trait across several personalities.  Personally, reading people and offering advice are just part of who I am.  I just can't help it.  Within the first few hours of meeting someone, I usually have a pretty good gauge on their intentions, and observing their behaviour in the following weeks and months confirms my estimate.  And as far as advice goes, even in small things I'm jumping in with proposed answers.  For example, in a meeting recently someone mentioned they were having difficulty striking up conversations regarding a sensitive subject (I'm in a Diversity and Inclusion working group at work and we're trying to get people to share their stories).  Immediately, I said that I have some research available on how to generate these sort of critical discussions in an open and honest way that will result in curiousity and not hostility, and perhaps they might find that helpful?  When it's something or someone I care about, I can't not offer a solution."
infj,3e1e04,Intempestivity,2,Tue Jul 21 05:51:20 2015 UTC,"I have also become wary of online tests for MBTI, mainly because most of them seem to look at the individual letters rather than the cognitive function stack. I've taken time to go through the types that can often be mistyped as INFJ, say INFP or INTJ, and after pondering on and off, I maintain that I am essentially INFJ (though I've yet to take an official test).   You're right about empathy and my examples sounding more like conflict-avoidance. But I in fact do place myself in their shoes in that I think to myself ""how would I feel if I was in their position"" and proceed to feel it. I think one good example is that every time I go to a busy restaurant with family, I always want to leave as soon as we're done eating because I feel the waiters just want us to leave to serve the next customers and the customers waiting in line want to eat, but of course they can't directly vocalize that to us. Meanwhile, my family and relatives are just shooting the breeze and taking their time...  I'm great with connecting concepts, creating metaphors and symbolism, drawing motifs and patterns, all coming together into some profound insight, but I don't really seem to do that with people, just ideas."
infj,3e1e04,shinbum,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:24:24 2015 UTC,"Just because you don't relate it to people doesn't mean it isn't INFJ at work.  INFJ are great at bigger-picture thinking, and not only do we develop those ideas, but we also can implement an action plan to see them to fruition.  Generally speaking, we tend to come up with the idea first, and the practical use for it later.  Example:  I came up with an idea and developed a roll-out plan at my old place of employment to have warehouse workers scan in and out of certain areas.  I had no practical applications initially, I just thought it would be a good idea so that we could identify who was at a specific station if something went wrong.  Eventually, I realised it could help with development needs, time management, data collation with regards to specific projects--all sorts of practical applications.  It wasn't a fix the world idea, it was a fix the system idea.  I like fixing systems.  I also like helping people and causes I care about.  The two aren't necessarily linked."
infj,3e1e04,KStreetFighter2,2,Tue Jul 21 07:29:29 2015 UTC,"I was just like that, neither able to ""read"" or ""counsel"" others with their emotional problems. I was a very statistically driven person who didn't give two shits about other people's problems. I was passionate about social psychology and the works of the human brain, not their ""problems."" Apathetic would have described me the best, then. But, as time went by (this is strictly my outcome, I'm not saying this is gonna be you), I realized that I had little, no, or horrible interpersonal relationships. So one day I decided to be true to myself, more honest with my feelings, and so forth. People started telling me they're surprised because I ""can"" be a soft-spoken guy who they can relax and talk about their problems with. With more and more interaction, I one day found myself being able to ""read"" and ""counsel"" people with their emotional problems. This whole process took 23 years, and, here I am now, studying clinical psychotherapy for my Master's degree.."

It's like killing someone in the name of religion - a way of justifying a heinous act - murder. Or the myriad ways people use religion to manipulate, lie, or plain hurt people.

infj,3e0x5x,cenease,2,Tue Jul 21 15:53:18 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm glad you asked. :)  Rapists and Child molesters are picking on people who usually can't defend themselves. (They have to be weaker than the perpetrator.) Same goes for cheaters, as the person being cheated on doesn't know most of the time. Plus, there has never been a rightful rape or child molestation. Same goes for cheating, but it didn't violate anyone's rights or boundaries without their consent.  Murder, however, is a bit more of a grey area. It's more of a perspective thing. War is technically mass murder, but there are always a majority of people who vote for it after a major event. Killing someone in self defense is classified as justifiable murder. Name one time anyone was let off the hook on rape because it was justifiable? Think of people who the world would be better off without? Say, an extremely oppressive dictator. If he was to be murdered by one of the citizens of his country, it would be murder technically. You would say, ""Well it was only right. That guy had it coming."" and you would be right.

Making mountains out of molehills constantly. It's been 10 months since we broke up and that's the thing I've had difficulty forgiving myself for, being so unkind over every little bump we had because of my frustration on how she interacted with other guys. The funny thing, is that I'm ok with having been jealous for much of our relationship. Her interaction with guys just wasn't for me. She had very little boundary and was actively trying to seduce people. For which she was conscious of. At first I thought it was my imagination... Knowing that she was so free and open in the world. I'd ask, ""so what's the deal with giving that guy a backrub and deep long hugs and long loving eye contact? You just met him, and he was all over you."" Her reply ""Well, I could tell that he was attracted to me. And I just wanted to give some of that back. Attraction is a positive thing. When it's there I'm going to share that."" My reply ""Oh. Well. That doesn't work for me. This isn't going to work... You are welcome to do your thing,,, but not with me."" In which case she would retract her efforts and promise to change her ways ( I have no interest in trying to change anyone. Ever.) So I tried to work through it with her, and she was so back and forth on her open love thing. And it just was not for me.    I've been in other relationships with girls who are friends with plenty of guys. But if they have healthy boundaries, it's never an issue. I remember being jealous a handful of times, but never made mention of it because I knew it was my own problem. But this last one was something else.

It takes me such a long time to calm myself down after being at events like so. Scenes from movies do it to me too. Like battle scenes from Lord of the Rings or Narnia.

Try to live your life as normally as you can, just with a bonus person to spend time with!"
infj,3dzw8x,altruisticspring,3,Tue Jul 21 00:15:13 2015 UTC,"I had a friend from the states come over and stay with me for two weeks a few years back.  Best thing I can say is plan everything, including downtime.  Plan to go to the movies at least one day--that's a couple of hours of hanging out where you can reboot.  If you're going out places, plan to get there when they open and there's less people about.  Plan a few meals out in proper restaraunts, and ask her questions about her life.  We're great listeners, and listening to someone talk about themselves while sipping a cold drink is infinitely easier than trying to generate small talk.  And if you guys have a common interest, bring it up!  I get energised when I'm talking about something I'm passionate about."
infj,3dzw8x,Intempestivity,3,Tue Jul 21 05:41:13 2015 UTC,"Well, at least it's just one person, rather than a big group! Are you close enough with your cousin to ask for a little downtime, if needed? Does she absolutely need you to accompany her everywhere she goes?   Also, if worse comes to worse, you could always just fake a bit of a headache, or sickness. Or, you could go all out and claim you have several ""errands"" to run, and just go hide in a library or Starbucks for a couple of hours ;)"

infj,3e0l1a,Jman522,2,Tue Jul 21 01:04:07 2015 UTC,"I had a similar experience. The only thing that helped was for me to get out of the environment for as long as I could. Go for a walk, drive, get some space. Try and plan to do any jobs you need to do when they are around so you're not 'available' for them to vent to. Boundaries are really important. It takes a lot of self worth and you have to value yourself, but you are allowed to say ""Your negativity is really affecting me"" and not apologize for feeling sensitive or emotional. You can still be empathetic and not be a doormat, being empathetic doesn't mean you sit there soaking in all the stuff other people let off. I used to shut my door and think to myself ""this is my space, there's a lot going on outside, but in this space I am safe and unaffected"". I think there's some meditations on this, where you visualize a cocoon or ball around you that protects you from other people's 'stuff'. I think a lot of it is mental, and so when you interact with those people you imagine being surrounded by that protective barrier again. You probably won't be as empathetic in those moments, but nor is it your job to be a 24/7 sponge to other's emotions."
infj,3e0l1a,americanpharoah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:12:54 2015 UTC,"I sometimes worry, actually quite often because it's become apparent to me, that it's difficult not to hate the people around you.  I feel their inner turmoil so intensely, yet they never see into the true nature of their problems. Always a masquerade of happiness, leaving me to wonder how I could ever pretend to enjoy their company. To feel love for them knowing that deep down, for them, the grass will never be greener on the other side.  A bit mellow dramatic, I know. I guess I feel like a harsh person to seal myself away as they repeat the patterns again and again. I guess I'm trying to protect myself while avoiding melancholy.  If anything, I don't feel sorry for the anger I feel. That gives me motivation to keep up with the meditation."

I believe what's more important is that we learn to utilize that empathy properly by directing it at the right people/institutions, rather than become doormats to those who seek to take advantage of our selflessness. By becoming less empathetic, we risk shutting out those who may actually need and value our support.  Why do you want to suppress your empathy, OP?"

I've found that with dramatic people (I would classify that brief description of your house-mates as dramatic people), the atmosphere they create is so negative and stressful that I can't actually be in that environment.  I've been in similar situations in the past, and during that time I was pretty much only at home to sleep.  I'd spend my days in libraries, nature and graveyards (I love bringing a book to a graveyard, it's so peaceful).  Sometimes I'd hang out with a close friend.  I'd ignore my house-mates as much as I possibly could and only interact with them when absolutely necessary.  I don't know if you're in a similar position, and I'm sorry I have no advice on how to occupy the same space with people like this.

Do you not want to notice when people have certain emotions? Not want to be affected by the feelings of others? Not want to care (or feel obligated to care) that someone is feeling something? Empathy is a pretty vague term, despite how often we throw it around in this sub.  All of those things I just listed could be grouped under ""empathy"" but are distinct issues. There are many ways the emotions of others can affect you, so what do you have the biggest objection to? It's hard to give advice if we don't know what the exact problem is."

infj,3dzngb,_Ajna_,21,Mon Jul 20 20:46:47 2015 UTC,"ENTP here, so I'm sort of an inside-out INFJ, and have had deep relationships (all with INFJ women) with three over my life.   Trust and Safety. INFJs have lots of layers. If they draw a line with you, respect it. That line will soon enough be erased if you prove your trustworthiness. Authenticity. I've never met an INFJ that liked fakers. Be yourself or be gone. Genuine interest. INFJs spend a lot of time absorbing other people's emotional junk. They get tired of people mistaking them for their surface layers, without really getting to know them. Ask about their inner life, what the best and worst parts of their day were, etc. Be patiently persistent, but respectful. Learn not to extrovert all over them. They need their processing time. Agree on a code. ""Hey babe, are you processing?"" ""Yeah."" ""Cool. Love you! See you later."" Appreciate them, often. Most types wander through life wondering if they have anything worthwhile inside of them. The INFJs I have met all knew that they were amazing people, and were looking for something outside of themselves to give this wonderful gift to. Anytime you receive it (their time, advice [HEED IT IF YOU ASKED FOR IT], or affection), you should acknowledge and appreciate it.  Don't be a confrontational jerkwad. Stand your ground, speak from the heart, but put the relationship first. Physical touch. Two of the INFJs I knew strictly didn't like being touched... Until they were all in. Wait for the invitation.   Basically, they've all had big, wonderful hearts that they guard closely. They're intense and don't take commitment lightly. Patience, genuineness, appreciation, and trust are your keywords.  Just my experience. Well worth it."

What you were born with, others have to develop.  Put yourself out there a bit. Unfortunately, (and as a man, I get this) women (assuming you like women) do expect it, but you can initiate in small ways. Want to learn how to paint? Take a painting class. ""Hey, I really like the way you used all those greens in your shadows. I was going to get a coffee after this--want to come?"" It doesn't have to be a big deal. What others are born with, you will have to develop.  Is there an ENxP in your life that is oddly quiet (for an ENxP) and asks you about your life? That's the one. Set boundaries about social interaction though; ya'll are like catnip to us and we will want to smother you with attention and ideas and thoughts. We'll want to peel back the layers, and you'll likely not want that, but you really do, you know?  A female best friend? You've done half the work already.  Bottom line.

infj,3dzngb,shinbum,9,Tue Jul 21 10:11:36 2015 UTC,"In terms of INFJ:   Strong communication. There has to be a strong level of understanding between INFJ and XXXX because INFJs have a need to know the other's fundamental principles and at the very least, be able to respect them. Strong communication also implies trust. INFJs have strong feelings (Fe) but do listen if you present a rational argument (Ti). Tone is also important because what you say and how you say something are two completely different things to an INFJ. It's one thing to disagree and another to condescend. If the INFJ mistakenly interpreted you wrong, calmly correct. They tend to mirror the emotion you project.  Compassion is another important quality. Though it does not have to be act upon, it's attractive to see there is some level of empathy for the human element. Even if you have a distaste for people, understanding or attempting to understand where they're coming from appeals to Fe regardless of your conclusion.  Independence. Because INFJ's dominant function is introverted, they need time to recollect themselves and explore ideas on their own. I get a thrill off my SO watching me approach something new without intervening and then discussing it with him after I form my conclusions. INFJs tend to absorb another person's emotional state, so the partner's independence/composure can help prevent draining or overwhelming feel overload.  2¢"

What I can say is that I come out with a lot of stuff that strikes a strange impression with her. She tends to hit me with a funny look. A little patience goes a long way. Instead of thinking ""wtf???"" she's learned to be calm (most of the time) and simply ask ""why?"".   Calmness. I'm not asking for serenity, but just calmness. We're both calm people. It's easy to understand each other when you're calm and listening. Most communication problems come from a certain anxiety and dismissiveness.  There's nothing greater than feeling like your two souls are inextricably intertwined. Getting to this state requires understanding. All true compassion comes from understanding.   We should not try to mould the other person to suit our own ends, but draw out the best that they would wish they can be. That means helping to realise their own potential, not to substitute their potentials for your own.   Calmness, understanding, acceptance.   Asides from these, don't cut them off from their friends and otherwise be a sociopath. Don't place ridiculous expectations on people just because you'd expect yourself to do something in a certain context."

Lately literally every attempt I've had at a relationship has ended in failure. I guess that I just want something deeper than the people I chase after want (extroverted bubbly cheerleader types) but my extrovert twin brother tends to do WAY better with girls and because I'm introverted I tend to internalize that as my brother being more personable and likable than I am. As a result, when a pretty girl shows attention or interest to me I catch feelings easily, and it's been awful because I get attracted to the wrong people and it's sucked lately because I don't understand how douchebags idiot assholes get into relationships with girls who are going to get hurt by them and now I'm rambling but I just kinda needed to vent sorry."

I've been having a hard time dealing with it, and it's put me in a lethargic, apathetic state of mind. I told him we could still be friends, and he wanted that. Debating whether or not I should ask him to hang out this week.  Also, my roommate went missing the day (Wednesday) after this happened. My mind went in circles, I kid you not. Thursday, I found out she's in the hospital. Had a hunch why, and my hunch was correct. She tried to kill herself. Fucking threw me in a loop. She's the only person I have here (family 4000+ away) and she's like an older sis to me so I was shaken. She's okay now, I guess, and got discharged Friday, then actually went to see her family on another island today so she's gone for the week.   Yesterday, I did have a beach bonfire with some friends so that was nice.

They want me to have a normal career, a lawyer or accountant or something. But that is definitely not where I want to go. It's frustrating talking to them about it because they just don't understand where I'm coming from or what I'm trying to say. And so I just shut down from discussing it with them. I don't really relate to them at all, or feel able to discuss my spiritual or political or intellectual interests. I look at my career as kind of an extension of who I am, a tool to grow, while to them a job is just a job.

I just have a lot of feelings.)   I'm supposed to be leaving for college about a month from now. I'm going to be a freshman. It's exciting, obviously, but also stressful. More stressful than it should be, honestly.   The IRS is being shit with processing my parents' taxes and the complications are making me worried that they won't be done in time for me to take out federal loans and perhaps get anything for a Pell grant. My semester bill is due August 15th, and it just keeps drawing closer and closer. I just don't know what to do. I don't even think the federal loans/grants will be enough to cover my leftover semester bill (~$7,000 after my academic scholarship). In that case, I guess it's goodbye to some/all of my savings that I've been building for two years.   Beyonc that slightly atypical college worry, I have all the regular ones. Fitting in, making friends, having good professors that like me, being able to balance all my time, etc. I'm taking 15 credit hours, so a standard courseload, but I also have to work 20-25 hours a week. And this guy who I dated and kinda had weird unrequited residual feelings for until the end of the school year is going to the same college as I am. And is in the Honors program, like me. And is majoring in the same thing as I am. I don't know how to feel about that at all. I'm sure I'll meet loads of other interesting people, but I'm kind of nervous/curious to see how that situation works out.   So, yeah. Lots of big life changes and all the financial shit that goes with them. It's kind of cool being on the cusp of things like this. All the anticipation. All the happy and anxious nerves bouncing around. I know I made the right decision when I chose to go back to school there; I just hope everything works out.

I know you'll be able to handle college well. Making friends comes in time, and it's really fun meeting people in classes and stuff. Get involved on campus; that's how I end up with the friends I have today, albeit not many but I know they're people I truly connect with and can rely on.   As for that guy, forget his ass. College is a fun, great time to be single and expand your social horizons. I started my freshman year (now a senior) having left a terrible, toxic relationship, and connecting with people in school really helped me move on. Maybe there is someone out there you can connect with that hopefully works out better for you :-)"

You are expected to know what you want to do with the rest of your life, while somehow managing this huge financial burden (in the US anyway). I just finished my first year of college, so i completely understand where you're coming from.   College ended up being a wonderful experience for me and exactly what I needed. It definitely was not an easy year though. Transitioning can be rough for many reasons, but it truly is a great learning experience. Take things as they come, and try your best to see it all as another reason to grow. I truly hope it works out for you! And if the money situation doesnt falls through, remember it is absolutely okay for you to take time off to work/rethink plans. So often kids are pushed into making these huge decisions without knowing why they even chose college. I understand though, i know for me college was definitely what I needed as a next step.

There are others, too. I've thought them all through more than one could imagine, and I think I can probably get through each individual issue. But all of them, all at once?

infj,3dwu74,AngelBalls,4,Tue Jul 21 01:50:15 2015 UTC,"Been stuck in a rut. I work in an office job that pays me decent, but I hate spending my time there. Stuck in a fluorescent box, made to wear restrictive office clothes. I come home to unwind and am surrounded by nosey, loud, religious neighbors who won't leave me the fuck alone. I live alone, friends moved away. I'm TOO isolated. Everything about my life right now gives me anxiety. I'm 26, the majority of my friends are getting married or having kids and i'm not even close to meeting a new girl. Still being self sabotaged by trust issues, lovingly deposited into my character by 2 back-to-back cheating girlfriends.  Meanwhile, between suffering my low self esteem and loneliness, i'm trying to work through the sudden loss of my father. Shit feels too heavy sometimes, I don't know if i'm strong enough to work myself out of this pain and confusion."
infj,3dwu74,shamechamber,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:17:34 2015 UTC,"Shamechamber - I know how you feel. I'm 26, too. I am going through something almost identical to that. Normally, I can somehow blame or reason my rut on something -- like ""oh, it's just cause I haven't been sleeping much"" or ""I haven't been doing the things that make me happy"" but this time, there is no reason. And this rut makes it difficult to get out of bed in the morning or even care about anything I'm doing because it's so overwhelming. I work in an office job that I feel very lucky to have but it's draining on me to spend my days here. When I get home, I spend my time alone which is the worst best thing for me. I feel normal/content when I'm alone, but too much time alone when I'm in a rut can be upsetting. I force myself to spend time with other people but the entire time I just want to be alone and then as soon as I get home or alone, I feel like I should have stayed. All of my friends are married and have 1-2 kids. That's not necessarily what I want right now, but it still makes me feel left behind because I can't seem to figure out what I want or what is best for me. As for dating... I had a boyfriend of 5 years and he suddenly wanted to end things (we broke up in 2013) and every guy I've been out with since only gives the vibes he is only interested in a physical relationship and doesn't care about the real ME. It all seems very shallow and lacking depth. So I've kind of given up on dating. Some days, it all doesn't seem worth it anymore. I go hang out on my roof and look out at the city and just try and make sense of everything."
infj,3dwu74,shinbum,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:10:11 2015 UTC,"Yes we are in very similar spots. Ain't it paralyzing to know that the only thing that can end the cycle is you, but you're just too tired to do it alone? Though, I am sending envy your way, I would love to sit on top of a building and look out over a city. That sounds amazing.  This INFJ problem of relying on organic relationships, it gives us so little opportunities. I often, as well, force myself out of my comfort zone to meet people. If it isn't successful, I not only regret spending my time that way, but I feel like i've taken a blow to my self esteem as well. I don't think I (or other INFJs) have a problem interacting with people, I think I typically carry my heavy thoughts up front and am ready to dissect any substantial topic with anyone I can find. Maybe it's that we are SO BAD at small talk, that we push people away very quickly.  I dunno, I'm just kind of in a rambling mood. But it's nice to know that there is someone else feeling the same things as me. That i'm not alone in some purgatory designed just for me.   What city do you get the pleasure of gazing upon?"

infj,3dwu74,islander85,3,Mon Jul 20 15:30:09 2015 UTC,"Driving is great. I like ""making friends"" with other cars going the same way as me, it makes me happy if a car who knows how to properly drive fast is going the same direction as me. There's an unspoken connection and sense of respect I feel. It reminds me that people in my life might go the same way as me for some time, but ultimately to a different place. Sometimes if I happen to glance over to someone cool we might just race. Driving is strategy, using the least amount of maneuvers to get to a place as fast as possible while abiding all traffic laws. You must always be aware of your surroundings including bikes, pedestrians, roadkill, uneven road, other cars and predicting their motion based off their driving. Sometimes I do this all subconsciously.   Driving at night comforts me.  Amen to GPS, Waze is a blessing.   Please, I want to hear what has been on your minds!   My relationship with my SO has been concerning me because I felt like he didn't have space in his life for me. We spoke tonight and he explained to me how each relationship has it's positives and it's struggles. We happen to have great communication and great sex, something that other couples struggle with. He likes what we have and I do as well. I thought that maybe we wanted different things because in a sense I want someone to ""explore the world"" with me, which I do. But ultimately we both agree that our purpose of a relationship is to learn about ourselves. I like that we can keep our independence, he has his life and I have mine, and we can share that together. He doesn't dump his problems on me nor do I dump my problems on him (well he consoles me... on matters like these... and gives me advice on how to approach or see other situations... so this might be one-sided). We work well together. The concept of actively progressing is in my mind, when really, we are progressing just by being us. This has been the healthiest relationship I've ever been in and it brings out the best in me while also teaching me new things.  Also I have to pack for Italy."

Thanks for your perspective!  My issue is that i'm so hyperconcious when I'm driving. I'll be thinking about first, where I'm going and what i have to do next. Of course my eyes are on the road, scanning everything thats passing etc. But as i do this i then start to plan for scenarios in my head of everything that could go wrong, which is a good thing i suppose, but that leads me to be paranoid and thinking about previous incedents, which ends up distracting me actually lol. Then I'm thinking about everyone around me as a drive. ""Oh that car is driving fast, maybe theyre in a hurry to see theyre dying grandma?? Oh gosh i hope I'm not slowing them down. What if theyre just having a bad day and want to get home to their family? I hope they dont hate my driving!"" I just feel so overwhelmed with stimuli as I drive, so it just leaves me so anxious and drained!   Well it sounds like you and your SO have great communication, which is awesome. If you have this concern that he doesn't have time for you, you should bring it up to him. Don't forget to share your feelings too! I'm so glad you feel like you're in a healthy relationship! It's refreshing to hear that :)  Italy! Are you going on vacation?"

I still struggle in certain situations and do not drive highways yet, but I have come a long way and I think time will make the rest possible.

infj,3dwu74,SilkenSails,3,Tue Jul 21 03:11:08 2015 UTC,I find driving in city's stressful as well and I've been driving for a long time now but mostly along country roads. I wish you the best.  My vent is running out of friends. I door slammed one last last year over almost a week long guilt trip and another one moved away at the start of this year which just leaves one really. He's got a FWB thing going now and we were going to meet up last weekend but he wasn't home. That's two misses out of the last three times we were going to meet up.  Due to poor health I find it really hard to make new friends but I don't know if I should worry too much about the last one I have. I find it demoralising organising a time to meet up and do something and he's not home.
infj,3dwu74,CuriousCosmo,3,Mon Jul 20 07:10:20 2015 UTC,"I'm worried about starting my new job and moving to a new city. Not only do I have the anxiety of starting my new job and hoping I don't fail, but one of my closest friends from college is also starting the job at the same place. I love her and all, but sometimes I get anxiety when I'm with her. If it's just us, it's fine. But when we're around other people I feel like I disappear. She's very extroverted and witty, while I'm more reserved and to myself, especially around new people. I already have pretty low self esteem so whenever we go out together and meet new people I always feel like I fade a little more each time because I compare myself to her and feel inferior. I'm just nervous that the same thing is going to happen in the workplace and that making new friends in a new city will be hard."
infj,3dwu74,SilkenSails,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:54:53 2015 UTC,"I totally understand your relationship with your friend. It can be very frustrating when you feel like you're always in her shadow. And (if it's anything like what I experience) its a frustration that is hard to communicate with her without feeling like you sound like your just jealous or weak (or actually finding the right words to explain it). Have you tried talking to your friend about this?   You got this job as well, so obviously you are qualified! While it will be hard, you should try your best to focus on your own goals and values. Did you put your best efforts into what you accomplished today? How could you improve yourself based on the work you did or did not accomplish?  The values you hold may be different than the values she holds, so comparing yourself to her will do no good for you! Sure, she may be able to befriend others quickly, but are her relationships meaningful? She may be witty, but is she truly being authentic? Since you are friends, I'm sure you share similar values, but that might be something to think about as well.   I hope you enjoy the job and everything that comes with it! I truly wish the best for you. I'd love to hear updates with how everything goes with your job and friend!"

It's the only way I can remain impartial to everyone as to character vs. what they gave me.  Now you're going to laugh at me, but I owe my dad 10 bucks. I needed to buy something, and I was 10 bucks short. I hate owing anyone money for anything. Especially my dad, since he is a manipulative fuck who uses anything he does for me as an excuse for everything he does against me. ""Oh well, I took you on that trip! I bought this for you or that!"" It's all in terms of what he gave me in material items, to make up for the lack of things he gave me in terms of lessons and being a father. I swear once I'm 18 I will proceed to give him the one finger salute, and leave. That's beside the point.  I have no money. That sucks. I always have money. I'm hoping to start some landscaping work here soon. Money is freedom, and I cannot live without freedom. Money means I can buy my own food, my own stuff.

Throwing away my old tradition-laced paradigm that I thought to always know as true to the wind and taking those first steps in creating a newer, sounder paradigm. Questions of existence, morality, religion, purpose, etc occupy my mind on a daily basis. I am trying to balance meditating on those thoughts and deriving the useful lessons through meditation to apply to my life, while completing my everyday responsibilities... Work, grocery shopping, paying bills, taking care of the house, planning a wedding and honeymoon, etc.  Looking into MBTI, Jungian psychology, and playing Persona 4 have really helped me so far.

It took her two years, really, to get it under control to a manageable level. My future as a grad student is seriously in question because of this (can't work, especially not field work. I'm hoping to at least get it to the point where I can once again work in the office/lab sometime soon).  I've felt my frustration build over the last few days/weeks. I've been a lot more grumpy and negative than usual. The summer heat making it impossible to sleep at night the previous two weeks probably contributed to that. I feel like I'm just far less kind and compassionate than I should be, because I just want a peaceful, clean, quiet space that I can burrow into and hide away from the world until I feel better.  Didn't sleep at all last night, ended up just in a worry spiral about what's going to happen to me and my life. Hit the pillow at 9pm tonight after hanging out with friends all day today (I haven't gone to bed before midnight in a long time). Woke up about 2am (about an hour ago) with sharp pains in my side. Likely the chicken fingers from lunch disagreeing with me. I'm not used to waking up mid-sleep, I'm usually out like a rock once I do finally get to sleep. So, now I guess, I'll find something to watch and hopefully my gut will settle down and I can get back to sleep. Then wake up and still be sick with nothing to do.  Okay, good vent. I think I needed that. Better to ramble here than my twitter or facebook feeds again. I think I do that instead of complaining to any specific person because it feels less like I'm bothering someone specific and just getting it off my chest, towards anyone willing to listen (probably just annoying if I do it too often, though)."

infj,3dx6w2,MemoriesOfSelf,2,Mon Jul 20 19:33:09 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind an advice, keeping the supporting leg slightly bent in the knee helps balance. The force of a kick goes down if it's at its apex, i.e. when your muscles and tendons are stretch to their max; it's good to keep kicks at your own comfortable height, otherwise you are just improving your dynamic flexibility, but not the strength.

I still run into the same door at least once a month, though.  Honestly, where I'm worst with inferior Se is when I'm driving. I'm a fairly conscientious driver in that I'm aware of other drivers and have never caused an accident. But I'm TERRIBLE when it comes to navigating.

I'm assuming I actually saw them do something else stupid, but it didn't consciously register.  I rely on Ni with directions, too.  If I get lost or have to go through a diversion, I'll usually instinctively know which way to go.

I'm also very good at finding my way back from something by retracing my steps or creating a mental map in my head. Similar to those exploration games where you have a blacked-out map that only fills in if you've travelled there once before.  Side-roads with less people attract me the most, so whenever I see a side-road I try to figure out where it leads and if it'll be a faster path. Even if it isn't a faster path, I'd probably take it nonetheless because less cars. I use a GPS mostly to forsee any police traps, accidents, or construction to act accordingly, but it's helpful in knowing where certain roads lead. Sometimes I memorize them in case my GPS fails me and zombies attack, I at least know where I'm going."

There are many other equally important , if not more issues to attend to which can result in much more devastating outcomes.Everybody is in need , as everybody on this planet has their own set of problems. It is virtually impossible to attend to all of them. Sometimes there are much more efficient ways to save people while indirectly contributing rather than charity and the such. There is a time and place for helping people in need and life is much more than  just other people or any at all. The world doesn't revolve around them or anybody.

I was beat up by 3 boys in elementary school, including being punched in the eye and having hair ripped out. Still don't know why. They jumped me while I was walking out to recess.   I used to play roller derby so I am not afraid to throw my weight around, but we do not punch each other or endorse fighting. It can be very physical.   My job is very physical and I have been hurt by my special needs students many times including being punched in the face, bitten and slapped, hair pulled. Obviously I would never retaliate but it has left emotional scars for sure. I can't stand anyone coming up behind me or anyone but my boyfriend touching my face.

I attempted to break up a fight involving two guys over a girl. They were hurling each other around by the shirt and wind-milling. I get in between the two, they're clearly exhausted, and just put my arms out to separate them. Then I felt the left one's bodyweight shift, so I ducked out. He hit his head pretty hard after having thrown himself off balance and onto the floor.  He got back up and apologised to me. He was wasted and hitting his head gave him a nasty jolt. It was obvious that he was the aggressor, because the other guy didn't try anything funny and just let him walk off.   Other times it's been people asking me to 'show them moves'. If you don't you're an arsehole and they get funny about it. If you do, it hurts and you're an arsehole and they get funny about it. I've had one friend get carried away and put me in a headlock. The escape from that is actually quite nasty but I did it anyway, mainly because it was hurting like hell. It didn't serve him right, he got carried away and was laughing off the hurt he was inflicting. It's stupid how aggressive people can get over the most trivial circumstances."

infj,3dux91,agitatedzergling,15,Sun Jul 19 18:43:49 2015 UTC,This depends largely on the person than their personality type. Everybody is different. It sounds like you need someone that is a little more patient.  Are we nice? That depends on who you talk to. Some people love us and think we're the nicest people that they've ever met. Others absolutely hate us for the same reason. Some people just rub us wrong the way so we're a little less patient with them and appear rude or we rub them the wrong way.  If you feel like you're about to be judged with some kind of mystic laser beam chances are you've already been judged with one and the person is just trying to figure out how to most appropriately interact with you.  Take the chance with her. The worst that can go wrong is that you're turned down or it doesn't work out.  To combat getting locked out of your apartment keep an extra key under the insole of your shoe or maybe in your wallet that way you always have one on you or keep one hidden somewhere close to the door.

""inefficiency."" Nice is just how I phrased it. (I don't even know how to be unironic anymore at this point I'm in so deep, sorry.)  I really like that you guys are warm but also have a dark side it seems at the same time. It's a cool mix. But I can totally see how there could be polarization. If I could take a guess I'd say that's at least one polarizing  thing people maybe see. But I dunno. Either way doesn't bother me at all.   I'm not really worried about getting turned down. She's been watching me for a few months I've noticed (we go to a small school) and after I introduced myself to her for the first time I was informed by a little birdie later on that she's intrigued. Unfortunately the semester ended before I could really do anything though.  But anyway that's sort of the reason for the extra caution, because everything's in place. If I do this it's definitely happening.  Thanks for you're thoughtful response and your sense of humor in understanding my annoying INTP writing style.  Also I want to thank you for not lecturing me on social justice or immediately drawing conclusions about things I literally didn't even write about.  You guys are way more challenging than I would have expected I really appreciate that and am quite frankly finding myself seriously endeared right now to you all. My only complaint is so far it's been way too easy you guys gotta mix it up and send me something actually good if you wanna rustle my jimmies. ; )"

I don't like it when people go off on tangents that are seemingly unrelated to what I asked as well. So I try to extend that to whoever I'm responding too.

Why you guys do this I don't I don't fully know because to me it's pretty clear I'm not taking myself that seriously in the OP, and to an extent am actually intentionally phrasing things reductionisticly as to imply I don't know how to write this and provoke you all into coming in to fill the blanks. That's personally what I see when I look at the OP.  It's interesting though how good you guys are with Ni and how distinctive it actually is. I think you're all being a biiit hard on me but I'm having fun trying to get in your heads and figure out why you're dropping these Ni bombs.  It's also interesting how you don't even build up to it either. Ni bombs are literally the first thing you drop like right there BAM  Like look how many times the opening sentence of your posts arw also your biggest Ni bomb. You gotta smile at that. That is funny   The 'J' doesn't mean Judgmental   Sure I don't necessarily think that. You do seem like you're evaluating things a lot though. Just not sure what. ; ) Or why.

But yeah...it's funny. I used to think that I was an INTP because I'm not nearly as organized and meticulous as a lot of the other 'J' types. However, once I read more about Ni, I was like ""Yep.

infj,3dux91,joantheunicorn,5,Mon Jul 20 16:16:42 2015 UTC,"INFJ should never be a label, much less a stereotype. If you're into her, then go for it regardless of her type. Flexibility is different for all individuals, so I can't say anything about the approximate percentage of your success."

Do you think I would place a probabilistic numerical value on a human interaction?  Do you think I asked for this anywhere in my post, either implicitly or explicitly lol?  It's bad enough you're immediately chiding me for conspiring to label you when that's no where necessarily implied, and then leveling the more serious complaint that I am a ""stereotyper,"" which appears to maybe even on par with racism.

infj,3dux91,jeff233,4,Mon Jul 20 04:03:48 2015 UTC,"INTP+INFJ is a very common pairing. I am dating one myself. We compliment each other splendidly, for the most part. We have different tastes in hobbies and music, but our values sync up quite nicely. Aside from both of us being reclusive by nature, we tend to balance each other out in most areas.   but lately I've been thinking about what a retard I am and I dunno if INFJ's will be havin that   To be completely honest, I don't think many ""will be havin that,"" regardless of type. If it's very obvious in your interactions that you're insecure, you're not going to attract many. Common interests is generally important when dating, but confidence is also key. Try and at least act like you're self-assured. Actual self-assurance will follow based on achieved result. You said this girl is interested in you, so you're already halfway there :)   No offense I just realize as I get older I'm never growing out of my messiness so I probably need to figure out what kind of person is a good match.   I wouldn't assume this person isn't a good match for you just because you're messy. INFJ uses Fe, which typically responds to people in need. Personally, I like taking care of my messy INTP :)  If you don't mind my asking, how do you know for certain that your girl is an INFJ? Also, how do you know for certain that you're an INTP?  Protip: anything along the lines of ""I always score INTP on that humanmetrics quiz and I've taken it like 8 times"" is not an acceptable answer."

infj,3dux91,jeff233,7,Mon Jul 20 02:56:26 2015 UTC,"First, take the word ""tard"" out of your vocabulary for good. ""Retard"", ""tard"" are offensive to people with disabilities and in general judgemental demeaning names like that are probably not going to appeal to someone you are trying to make a good impression on.  INFJs like when you are confident and make them feel special. So if you come off second guessing yourself and full of doubt it will probably not pan out well. You should never look to someone else to fulfill your self esteem."
infj,3dux91,Greasypatriot,-1,Sun Jul 19 20:27:03 2015 UTC,"Retard is a perfectly fine word. It describes anything that is slowed or stunted or elsewise. It's used to talk about ""flame retarded"" materials or ""retarded catalytic reactions"" in chemistry and molecular biology. There's also a family of chemicals and materials known as ""retardants.""   It's been in the English language for years, it has Latin roots, and it applied to a broad range of different things before psychiatry and medicine used it to describe neurological processes that were not optimum. Anything from reaction speeds, the aftermath of a head trauma, ADHD, and yes Downs Syndrome.  It wasn't an offensive word until liberals decided it was an offensive word. And they made the ex cathedra announcement. Why? Well how do they expect to strengthen their political base if they haven't been seen combating injustice somewhere lately? How are they to call themselves ""progressives"" and rally up enthusiasm if for the cause if they can't at will mention specific ways they are bringing ""progress?"" So of course they trip over themselves to find something to get offended by to appear to be always ""going somewhere."" (presumably forward)  But not just anything, silly. Turns out millennials will be very important to the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. How can we efforts this time around to impressing millennials? I know, we'll take a popular word they all use and turn it into a big deal. What's more, they will brag to each other that they are too enlightened to use that word anymore (since their kids) and everyone will want to join in too so they can feel sophisticated. And this can't be low key call up CNN, find a token Downs sufferer and manipulate him on national television into saying exactly what you want him to, exactly how you want him to, even though he doesn't really understand what he's really saying. You guys remember when this literally happened right?  How does it feel to know a carefully crafted, propagandistic political stunt actually influences your thinking and moral vision? How does it feel knowing that the elites have you voting just like they want you to? So courageous.  If I want to jokingly call myself a tard because of seriously delayed personal and organizational skills for being a 28 years old adult it's probably okay. I agree it's not the nicest word really. But think about exactly how much of a pawn you really are and tell me who is really dragging society down.  Wonder what they'll have you doing next?   So if you come off second guessing yourself and full of doubt it will probably not pan out well. You should never look to someone else to fulfill your self esteem.   You're projecting. It's well known NF's have the self-esteem problems. I never said I was nervous or unsure of myself anywhere in my post. I said was unsure I wanted to get involved with this INFJ because she seems   intense and very precise and I don't want to waste my (or hers) time if my eccentricities rightfully irritate her like I wonder they might. Not everyone can be around me and I respect that.  But anyway thanks for your thoroughly negative post with literally not one positive or charitable sentence or phrase anywhere.

I have a friend with down syndrome and have observed first hand how much this word can hurt. I also feel any of us could acquire a disability at any point in our lives - we are not immune to that. Wouldn't we also want to be treated with respect and dignity? I certainly wouldn't want to date someone who used that sort of language, but maybe this gal is different. So apologies for assuming.   When referring to fire, I believe you mean flame retardant. The musical term ritard, meaning to slow down is another common use. I personally don't feel those are on the same level as calling someone a retard. I guess if you want to refer to yourself as that that's your business.   Anyway, sorry if you're having a rough day.

IRL, I feel that the majority of people I hear using the word ""retard"" do not put that sort of consideration into it (not that it makes it any better). It is simply meant as a hurtful word meant to tear someone down. I rarely hear anyone past middle school age use it with any regularity so it makes me cringe when adults use it. To be fair, I am baised.   For me, when I hear people talk about themselves in this way or use a word like that to lump together and hurt people they may not understand, it bothers me.

In the US, using words like ""retard"" and ""spaz"" seemed to be far more commonplace (""spaz"" in particular; ""retard"" was a heated word even when I was young).  In the UK, you never hear these words used.  They're considered highly offensive.  For the record, I believe any word used in hate that is pushed towards normalisation is a dangerous word.  It encourages people to view the group that the word is directed at as less than themselves, which paves the way for violence, abuse, torture and murder, and once a person is made aware that a word is a hateful word, they should make a conscious effort not to use it and to educate those who do."

Um when you dropped a nuclear Ni bomb right out of the gates without even asking me how my day was going first  I thought you wanted to go to war so was like okay he wants war let's go to war. Think about it you only literally said critical things, dropped the gauntlet within the first sentence, told me I had low self-esteem for I can't even remember why but it came from left field. You clearly wanted war.   Plus I honestly I thought the tard lecture was a troll who starts a paragraph that way. I'm thinking this person just thinks I won't know how to respond. Or that he has safety in numbers and I won't take that bait. I'll give him what he wants and see what happens. I'm tryin' to learn about INFJs anyway.  I guess they are sensitive to criticism, though oddly straightforward in giving doling it out. And I wonder now if this was your ""cause."" If so that's great but INFJ you were the chosen one. You were supposed to destroy injustice, not give it credibility.   Your work with special needs kids is cool but I still don't buy the argument. Not that it really matters but I have worked summer camps for special needs kids myself, and also am professionally diagnosed as ""Twice Exceptional."" I still think the verb ""retard"" is perfectly innocent and doesn't need to be stigmatized to the degree it is.  If you could have just avoided saying I had low self-esteem. I almost wasn't even going to bite but then you to say that and not even explain how you decided that for me. Frankly I think the telling people that should be banned and replaced with not-yet-awesome. It's too dangerous someone is actually gunna get hurt one of these days.

infj,3dux91,demesure,2,Mon Jul 20 04:34:31 2015 UTC,"I recalled hearing from you previously on this sub:  https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/38qcbs/so_its_happening/  You seemed annoyed with the INFJ, so what changed? Also, I think you gave me a compliment in there somewhere?   As far as ""wanted a war"", that was not even on my mind. I read your initial post and picked out the things I as an INFJ woman found unappealing and would turn me off from dating someone. Maybe I should have sugar coated it better. Not always my strong suit. The ""taking care of tards"" bit especially put me off, I don't want to have to look down on my mate as someone who I need to coddle, take care of or whatever. I am looking for an equal in dating - a reciprocal relationship. Ideally, we both have our bad moments but we boost each other up. As far as us giving second chances - if you ever lie to us you are dead in the water.   You were asking for INFJ opinions in your initial post so I gave you mine. While I am a very active member of this sub, I don't need or care about 'safety in numbers'. I say what I'm gonna say and sometimes I take my down votes or an unrelated political rant for it. Whatever. It is all a learning experience. As far as me being blunt, it is a blessing and a curse. Many INFJs are able to convey their feelings better (or worse!) through writing and are sometimes too cutting or brutal. I sometimes have my friend ""sugar coat edit"" things I write before I send them (not on reddit unfortunately). If someone deeply betrays me, I can tell them off for life in 2 seconds flat and probably have them crying about it too. Do I use this ability often? No.   As far as trolling, I see very little on this sub. INFJs, in my perception, are serious a good amount of the time, especially if they are trying to hear someone out or help them and definitely when talking about loved ones. I often say my boyfriend is 95% joking/5% serious, and I am 95% serious/5% joking. I rarely see people here like, ""I'm just fucking with you man"", because many of us are quite serious a decent amount of time and this is a place where we can be so and the others just get it.  If I could go back and re-word anything in my original reply I would have stated, ""One should never look to someone else to fulfill their self esteem"" instead of making a pointed statement ""you"". I'm backing off a little because you appeared to be backing off a little in your reply as well.   Where does my thinking come from? I am speaking only from my past experiences. I have dated guys who were looking for someone to take care of them. Maybe that is how your comment made me feel - resenting certain ex-boyfriends. It didn't work out for me because I got in a position where I felt obligated to them, where I felt I was their ""keeper"" and it led to my own demise emotionally. INFJs commonly fall into this trap, they give too much of themselves up to help the other person get ""better"" or ""save"" them or achieve this or that. We lose ourselves if we're not careful.   Lastly, for the record yes I am a flaming fucking liberal (maybe even a .....socialist!!), and proud of it. ;D  So your political rant had me rolling. My political stance has nothing to do with me advocating for people with disabilities. I truly believe a society should be measured on how it cares for its most vulnerable citizens. This is my life's work.   edit: moved a sentence"
infj,3dux91,mackinaw_peaches,3,Tue Jul 21 02:39:22 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's a known fact that the normalisation of hurtful words in a society quickly devolves in to normalisation of hurtful acts in society.  Let's take the n-word, for example.  Originally a word used in Spanish, French and other European countries to denote the colour black.  Latin origins.  The word was then used to hatefully refer to dark-skinned people as black.  It futher devolved to associate with general negative attributes--easy work was called ""niggard's work"", to act like a coward was to be ""niggardly"".  Jokes were often made in the media at the expense of dark-skinned people using the n-word and different variations of it.  The word was so ingrained within society that nobody batted an eye at its usage.  The hatred for dark-skinned people was so normalised, that when it escalated to violence, it was just generally accepted.  The word, which had completely innocuous origins, had devolved in to something to represent an entire group of people as less-than.  When we view others as less than ourselves, we justify some pretty horrible actions towards them, including torture and murder.  The same is said for any hate word.  It starts off as a perfectly innocent word.  A group of people begin using it to negatively describe a group they feel is inferior to themselves.  More and more people use it; it becomes normal.  The hatred and poor treatment of the marginalised group escalates.  Using those words, and defending their usage, is contributing towards the problem.     Here's an interesting article about offensive jokes and the negative impact they have on people's unconscious bias. And here's another one about how humour can be used to create social norms to justify prejudice. Here's one on the normalisation and perpetuation of domestic violence. This page has a lot of relevant links discussing studies showing the connection between hateful speech and violence.    All relevant actors should pay attention to early warning signs, including the marginalization and social exclusion of specific groups of individuals; discriminatory legislation and policies; the persistence of racial prejudice and negative stereotypes; hate speech by public officials and the media; and violent attacks and harassment targeting ethnic groups,” said Mr. Mutuma Ruteere, the UN Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  Racism still contributes towards violence   Words hold weight for a reason."

A few times I've tried to just give them a smile even though I don't necessarily know them but they'll even avert their eyes.   Sometimes I wonder what exactly is going on that makes a person so off-limits. They have to be a little delusional about themselves imo. Who is that mysterious?

Well, I've heard from a lot of people from around my state say that Kroger's is a pretty good job, not too stressful and they have a union to protect you from being fired over nothing. Unfortunately, I have no idea about any other job that could be turned into the perfect career without some college. Since this is so urgent, you may have to settle until things get a little more stable, then work on a job that'll make you happy. It's tough, but everybody has to do it at some point, and it's only temporary.  As for interior design, you just design the insides of buildings, like schools, airports, offices, or maybe houses if that's what you go for. I doubt there's anyway to start working with a college degree, though, but it couldn't hurt to make some phone calls to architecture firms in your area to find out!

I've done minimal freelance editing and definitely enjoyed it. Editing felt like a giant puzzle and I got to work on my own, which I enjoyed, albeit I learned new things from the ideas and stories that I edited. However, I think you may be looking at Ryan Reynolds as alluring in a different way."
infj,3dv0k7,INFJ_advice_needed,3,Sun Jul 19 19:11:21 2015 UTC,In the careers under the umbrella of mental health- I would say that you should not hinge your idea of success on whether or not every client changes.
infj,3dv0k7,andtherobots,4,Sun Jul 19 20:17:30 2015 UTC,"Hey. I read through your post history because I was interested in your backstory. I'm not in any of those fields, though I have several friends who are. I'll give you a little bit about me first, just so you get an idea of where I'm coming from.  I'm one of those rare INFJs who found a career early and haven't really deviated from it much. I'm going into museum curation with a focus on small museums. For me, I needed something with variety and something where I felt that I was making a difference. I'm extremely passionate about the importance of museums in society, both as educational institutions and as a way of protecting objects that are important to humanity and our understanding of ourselves. That being said, I come from a position where money isn't a huge concern. I'm really not trying to brag, and I'm in no way loaded, but I know that I'm not going to have to be financially responsible for my Mom when she gets older, for example.   A financial planner once said to me that there are three important criteria in determining how stable a job is (you might already know this with your background, but I think it's a good piece of advice for anyone not familiar with it):   1.) Is it recession-proof? 2.) Can it be outsourced? 3.) Can it be made technologically obsolete?   So, my chosen career field isn't recession-proof, but it can't really be outsourced and it certainly won't be made obsolete in my lifetime.   Having friends go into almost all the fields you've mentioned, here's what I've noticed: * Nursing--this is a really physically demanding job. It's rewarding on good days and extremely frustrating on bad ones. Consider that it's possible that you may have to deal with people dying. If you can handle that, go for it. I know that I could not. The job market is growing, but that means that you might run into people who are just there for the paycheck.   Counseling/emotional therapy--I often thought about going into this when I was younger, but ultimately decided that it wasn't for me. While I think helping people in this way would be rewarding, I know that I would have a difficult time staying emotionally detached from people and I worried that that would bleed over into my personal life. People in the mental health professions do have a high rate of suicide and depression, and I think this is one of the reasons for that. Physical therapy--PT is extremely difficult to get into. I have several friends who desperately wanted to get into it, only to be rejected based on the sheer volume of candidates, among other things. It's a really rewarding career that does make a difference, but there is a lot of school typically involved. Occupational therapy--I think this one is often easier to break into than other forms of therapy. Of the careers you listed though, this is the one that I have the least experience with.  Speech-language therapy/pathology--There has been a HUGE explosion in this field in recent years. I know at least 12 people who are going into/have gone into this in the past two years alone. It sounds interesting to me, but I would really be concerned about the job market in later years. Based on economic trends, I think there's the very real possibility of this career becoming like law where there's such a huge glut of speech and language pathologists in 10-20 years that the pay tanks.  Web developer/designer--this one has a decent amount of job security, generally. It's also rewarding from a creative standpoint. That being said, you probably wouldn't feel like you were directly connecting with people. I think you need to evaluate whether or not that's a problem for you.   I hope you don't feel like I was being excessively negative, I just wanted to bring up some points that you may not have considered. Good luck in your career search. I'm sure you'll find something that's rewarding and makes use of your talents.  Edit: Man, that format was a million times less intuitive than I thought it would be."
infj,3dv0k7,BantlingBee,2,Sun Jul 19 20:40:39 2015 UTC,"Learn to get comfortable with imperfection. INFJs are idealists and, while it's good to keep your standards high, you'll burn out if you expect perfection out of yourself or anyone else. If you want it more than they do, something is wrong. Do not underestimate the importance of self-care. Be proactive about maintaining your physical and emotional well-being. Find a mentor.   Source: I'm a therapist."
infj,3dv0k7,ba113r1na,2,Sun Jul 19 20:52:37 2015 UTC,"I've worked in the web industry for the last year and a half, and am currently going to school to be a web developer. I can tell you that in general, web designers have to deal with people a lot more than developers, and also deal with a lot more criticism.   I read your other post and saw that you like to please people (parents, teachers, etc.). I'd probably recommend development over design to you in that case, as designers have the much harder job of trying to please the client. While it can certainly be very rewarding when you get the design right, it's also one of the toughest things to do. Clients are oftentimes very picky and hard to please.   However that's not to say that you can't do design, or even design and development both! It's definitely a great career field to go into, and I think it fits the INFJ personality type well. For me in particular, it gives me the satisfaction of knowing I've helped people immensely, without really having to interact with those people too much. Let me know if you have any other questions about the field, I'll do my best to answer them."

infj,3dv0k7,push-paws,3,Sun Jul 19 22:02:11 2015 UTC,"I strongly disagree that everything is going to be automated soon with web development/programming in general, but you do have to constantly keep up with updated and changing standards.

infj,3dujow,_Ajna_,2,Sun Jul 19 21:16:10 2015 UTC,"Hi there,  First of all- I feel as if this post was placed here for me to answer by some bizarre fate. The reason being is that I have knowledge/experience in a few of the fields you are describing, and I'm even vacillating myself between some of these. I can share some of my thoughts and hopefully that will help you with your loss of motivation, and finding a new path.   Do not feel guilty for wanting a job opportunity that you find fulfilling and does more for you beyond paying the bills. As an INFJ, you have a heightened need for this. Our happiness is strongly tied to our 'cause'. You spend 40+ hours a week, 50 days out of the year, working your ass off to make someone else rich. You're quite literally selling the time in your life you dedicate to working. I've met and spoken with a lot of people about this. I've been told that it's unrealistic, immature, and a result of a generational shift. While that may be true (I personally don't buy into that for a second), it's important to accept yourself as you are, and form a compromise. Why can't you do both? Why does it have to be one or the other? The answer is that it doesn't.  With that said, I have to emphasize that until you lay out all the facts on the table and make a decision you feel really set on, you should not leave your current job if you can help it. The reason I say this is because going back to school for any of the aforementioned careers will be significantly expensive. Maybe the purpose of this terrible position is to help launch you into something more meaningful (whereas had you moved to NYC, burned a hole in your pocket paying outrageous rental rates, and worked as a writer making breadcrumbs, you wouldn't have that opportunity, most likely.) I would also recommend taking an aptitude test just to help reinforce your decision making process. The career prospects for Mental Health Counselors and Marriage and Family Therapists are very average, from what I've read. Though it will absolutely speak to your empathetic side, that median salary for these positions are alarmingly low ($40,000-$48,000 per year). I've also read and heard information about how there are too many counselors, but not enough clinical psychologists and psychiatrists. This causes too much job market competition, and getting a good job in these two fields is tough. However, it may be a good stepping stone to use in between a Master's Degree and a PsyD. or PhD. if those particularly interest you.  Speech-Language/Occupational Therapy: Pays very well, is intellectual, and helps others at the same time. I've known a few people who had undergrad in communications to then go to graduate school for this. If the schooling isn't daunting for you, I'd say this is a good potential option that would pay dividends.  Nursing: Would require a whole other bachelor's degree. Unless you wanted one of the lower positions, in which case I believe you need an Associate's degree. That type of job would require a lot of cleaning up gross bodily fluids, from what I've heard. It's only the nurses with a BSN who are able to do some of the cooler work in the field.  Clinical Psychologist: This is a long time in school. However, if you are like me and most other INFJ's, this sounds like heaven to you, because you love school. You would need to do some leg work to get into this field, as what typically happens is students graduate with a Bachelor's in Psychology, then apply straight for the PhD. programs which pays them to research and funds their education. I too have examined the PsyD. They make great therapists because they are more realistic in their approach (I find). The downside is that this degree is VERY costly due to the absence of research funding. It's a large time commitment. It also eliminates any ability to teach or research in the future since the qualifications are aimed at therapeutic practices and clinical testing/screening patients. A lot of people who look at the PsyD. end up with a Master's in Social Work after realizing it's cheaper and more time effective way to help counsel others.  Web Developer / User Experience Designer: Deceivingly so, these are not the same thing, though a lot of people tend to believe they are. They are closely related. I have a degree in Graphic Design and work currently as a User Interface/User Experience designer. I originally started in print. Hated it, realized the pay was shit, the prospects were shit, and contacted someone in the field who owned their own firm. I find this work very satisfying given the fact that I don't consider myself overly detail oriented. What I do like is that it's highly analytical (how I naturally think) and pays well the absolute best salary out of any design job ($72,000 median annual salary). In order to do experience design, you don't necessarily need to know how to code. That's what the developer does. You're just mapping out how the website will be structured and how it will function. You do a lot of user testing and refinement with clients. Knowing basic HTML5 and CSS is required. Other languages are just bonus and specifically beneficial to smaller boutique design firms that need one employee to wear many hats. Some good resources for these fields: Design Thinking: A Documentary About Design Methodology, The UX Book, General Assembly   Good luck! Hope all this babble helped you in some way. :)  TL;DR You should probably try either Occupational or Speech Therapy, User Experience, or Web Design."

It can cause us a lot of pain and wreck our sense of self-esteem. There is a ton of information out that on personal growth, especially for INFJs.   It's definitely not an easy road, and you will have to step out of your comfort zone quite a bit. But I can tell you from experience that it is well worth facing those intense fears. Once you do, eventually you will start to become (and feel) like the person you imagine yourself being.  See, you DO have a lot to give to this world, we all do. Don't convince yourself otherwise!

I think we tend to be too harsh on ourselves via what we're doing to ''make the world a better place''. I mean, any little act of kindness (as much as a smile to a stranger on the street) can bring the world to be something closer to what we'd want it to be (assuming we have the same idealistic vision of a kind, equal world). Maybe you feel like you aren't doing enough, and I get what you mean really. But I don't think the way to go here is to downgrade yourself about it, but rather to encourage yourself everytime you commit a little act that can bring you closer to that vision. I think encouragement is the key to more and more effort.  Some might say I'm too optimistic sometimes - it comes and goes - but hey, I like it."

I actually love this position, it gives me time alone (driving). As well as that opportunity to make me a little uncomfortable and really capitalize on my weaknesses (being in the kitchen).   I've noticed that since working on myself, I look at my time in the kitchen as a time for growth. A lot of resentment can arise in the kitchen, and push us further into our heads. After I started realizing this process, and taking steps to vent my frustrations and take a stand for myself, it has made the working experience in-between semesters much more enjoyable.  Hope this helps!"

I could also play video games on the computer and browse the internet until closing time. The alone time that I had was meaningful to me.

I picked a professor in my major department (ie. Sociology), went to the faculty webpage of the school website, read up on his CV (aka resume) and previous works. Then, I went to his office hour to discuss his past studies and achievements. I had agreements, critiques, and such. After the discussion, I told him I want to write like him. He obliged and made me his full-time T.A. (Teaching assistant) and Research assistant for the next 3 years.

Both experiences were very appropriate for my personality type needs/wants and also very helpful in the job hunt later on.  For computer science, you may be able to find a job in your university's computing lab.  Or you could look for paid internships at local tech companies.  Gaining experience (however marginally related) in your chosen field will greatly aid you when the real job hunt begins.  It will also help you to better understand what areas of your chosen field are important to focus on.  Many universities really like to employ their own students because they understand that it helps students find better jobs after graduating.  Students are also a good source of cheap labor.  You may not realize just how many opportunities are available until you start digging.  My university was not so great about advertising all of the positions that were available.  Best of luck!"

The whole ""here is what they need to do"" applies to things that I've literally never had problems with in my entire life. I don't expect my wife to be an angel and I've never expected any of my relationships to be. I've never dated a tragic woman to ""save her."" I might be a ""solo type person"" but I'm hardly impossible to be in a relationship with. And that dig at INFJ women at the end? Where the hell did that even come from? Some of this is quality introspection, some of it is auto-fellatio, and some of it is pretending that we're all identical clones because of our type (which is just the worst to read). An MBTI type is not a damned horoscope.  Heck, I oughta write my own self-critical blog post, with all these complaints I've got."

I wanted to make a chance and become a new person, so the whole experience was very transformative for me. It's a brand-new, blank page in your life, and you can write any story you want. So yeah, that blank page can seem very intimidating and you can find yourself freezing into inaction, but you can just as easily take the kinetic energy of those fluttering butterflies in your stomach and spur them into a bold and brave action... namely just assessing your surroundings and taking a chance where you see fit. I apologize if that last sentence might not be very useful as practical advice, but it's the best way I can describe how to tackle the unknown.

Option 3: Stay here in Indiana, move in with my mom while I attend college.  The first two are the most attractive to me, but require me to leave behind my friends and family.

So I would say... find a way to get involved in your community. it doesn't have to be at a social gathering. Volunteer for something. Maybe make friends at a new job. Frequent certain locations.

You may have been jaded by people's seemingly false actions/decisions because they defy your set of morals and beliefs. I can't be sure. Time and experience will mold us into a more rounded individuals, I believe. Bottom line, you're good. No worries."
infj,3dshgl,shinbum,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:01:46 2015 UTC,"You need to develop yourself more. It sounds like rely quite a bit on your intuition, and your feelings overtake yourself often. Try and think about why you're feeling how you do in the moment.  And you can't force people to change. I'll give an anecdote: Ive been pursuing another INFJ woman, she's my age but due to circumstances she hasn't had time to develop herself to where most of us that have been in touch with ourselves are. Anyways, we were at target the other day before taking the train over to Little Tokyo, and she was telling me a story about how she set two of her old friends up for a date but she was extremely upset about it because apparently they did a bunch of drugs together. She does not like drugs. So she apparently went off on them ""because I didn't set them up to do drugs together"".   Once you get more in touch with yourself and understand how others work, it can become simple and sometimes quite trivial to point people in the right direction. As well as that it can be easy to be flat out manipulative. YMMV."
infj,3ds0x2,jeff233,5,Sat Jul 18 22:14:21 2015 UTC,"I had an ISTJ coworker and we'd butt heads A LOT (before I knew he was ISTJ). I had no idea why we didn't get along, because I generally get along with everyone, until I realized he was ISTJ and read about how they work.   They can sound very accusatory at times, he would often say things that I took as criticism. In reality though, they are generally just stating the facts of a situation. Once i realized he was very ""concrete"" and factual, I never had a problem with him again, I would simply talk to him in the same manner he would talk to me.  It took some effort on my end, I'd usually have to think before I said something, but once I realized all he cared about was the data we communicated much more effectively."
infj,3ds0x2,KStreetFighter2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:05:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that, yes my manager she wants the cold hard facts of a given situation.I know I shouldn't take the coldness personally she's T dominant after all, it's hard though at times when she's your manager.INFJs take their work seriously like everything else so I get confused when she is blaming  me or just looking for a scapegoat.edit: but now I will try and keep it to just the facts and not take it so personally."
infj,3ds0x2,KStreetFighter2,3,Sun Jul 19 00:15:48 2015 UTC,"I might not have explained myself well enough, what I mean is that they sound critical and judgemental. I used to think I was always getting blamed for things. In reality though, they aren't saying anything with judgement behind it.   If I forgot a minor detail, even if it had no effect on the final outcome, he would mention it. At first I took it as unnecessary criticism, especially because of how he'd say it, but then I realized he didn't really care, he was just stating a fact.  The thing I have come to appreciate about ISTJs is that they will tell it as it is, which is hard to find from other people. The other thing is that although they come off as cold and sometimes even mean, they actually have a very, very deep inner life and have very strong feelings; they use both Si and Fi after all!"

infj,3ds0x2,6the6bull6,2,Sun Jul 19 01:54:01 2015 UTC,"My wife is an ISTJ. We get along very well.  She is also a tough cookie as well. When we first started dating people joked that I was her verbal punching bag. She has a need to vent but usually that's all she doesn't even need a solution to the problem she just needs to verbalize it. So it's kind of an easy problem to fix.   One thing that you have to come to grips with is an ISTJ will be an emotional steam roller. They will never take your emotions into consideration, and if they do it still won't compare to the amount of consideration you give to their emotions. Try not to take it personally it's just how they are.   If you want to get them to take you seriously you need to be able to produce some kind of real world results. Plans are great but results seem to get their attention /respect. Don't try to reinvent the wheel unless they are on board they hate having their system tampered with.   If you have any specific questions let me know. I have likely gone through it before."

Edit: How do you deal with arguments with your wife since we generally hate conflict?"
infj,3ds0x2,roadwarder,2,Sun Jul 19 02:16:55 2015 UTC,"We actually rarely ever fight.  Sometimes i can just tell there is no possible way I am  going to win or get my way. So I try and either let things play out so she realizes it's a bad idea or provide real world past examples of something similar that didn't work. You usually can't win an argument by trying to prove that the idea won't work based on your intuition. Sometimes after the argument she will realize that I have a well thought out idea and I was  actually right, but that's rare.   If you can be someone who provides counselling based on real life examples it will help you out. Especially if the information you provide shows that their system or the order of things can be compromised.    Your manager might actually see you as someone who is out of line with the system. You might need to make a small adjustment to how you do things or persent ideas. If you are seen as a threat to the order you will be seen as a problem."
infj,3ds0x2,Greenbananas123,2,Sun Jul 19 14:21:35 2015 UTC,"A very good friend of mine is ISTJ. He's in a difficult place in his life in terms of education, finances, and social life. He hates talking about any emotion and deals with them on his own. He'll excuse himself from me to recollect himself before he is willing to talk to me again. He is incredibly minimalistic, likes doing things for others too much to the point that it is very easy for people to use him. He is a listener, doesn't like to talk much about himself, and really appreciates time that people give him. He gives in a tangible manner—shows his appreciation with actions and struggles with words—but likes to receive intangibly. It is hypocritical in a sense because when people give him gifts or do tasks for him, he feels too bad to accept therefore will stubbornly refuse. Things like spending time or affirming words are his form of ""gifts"" he is willing to accept.  My ISTJ friend comes off as cold, favors structured environments, follows rules, gets annoyed when other people don't do what they're suppose to do, but I think he is one of the warmest people I've ever met. It pains me sometimes how much he is willing to do for someone as if he feels like it is his responsibility to be a great friend, great employee, great brother, great son. Even another ISTJ who used to like me freshmen year of college, he has a strong sense of responsibility and approaches situations very logically. My emotions at the time intrigued him in the sense that he could take them apart and provide solutions to me. He felt useful and helpful and was attracted to my naiveness.  I think feeling useful and helpful makes ISTJs the most happy.   How do you deal with them in your life?Do you butt heads or have you found a compromise?   I allow them to help me and in return give them my time, recognition, and gratitude. The only time we butt heads is in terms of accepting tangible gifts and talking about their feelings. The compromise is to heed to their distaste for both by giving them abstract gifts and not scrutinizing their emotions."

Honest connections are so agonizingly difficult, because finding them means a sort of vulnerability.  Most of the time, hooking up an INFJ's psyche to someone else's is like two different plugs.    You either burn one out, get no flow, or one gets power and the other sits there shooting sparks that go nowhere.    When you get a real circuit where energy is moving, it can be scary.  There's so much potential.  I've seen two INFJs connect for a minute, then run in opposite directions they were so frightened of that vulnerability."

infj,3dqejy,inefjay,7,Sat Jul 18 14:00:14 2015 UTC,"I used to wonder what my life would be like if I had a different personality type. Would I have had more friends? A different kind of job? Or go on the kinds of adventures that people post about on Instagram? But recently I have changed my view on being an INFJ, and now I feel bad for anyone who isn't. As an INFJ, we have the amazing opportunity to see the world in vibrant colors that few, or no other personality type see. I like to think of it as what I call the ""Beach Analogy."" Imagine every personality type on the beach. Most of the different people stay on the shore of the beach and spend the day baking in the sun, playing games, building sand castles, etc, which don't get me wrong, is really fun to do, but if you did that every single day, it would get boring. Then there are the people who play on the beach and occasionally go stick their toes into the water and maybe wade around a little bit, but in the end, those people don't ever go very deep; they show some small interest in what is going on out beyond the beach, but they don't really do much about it. Then, you have those people who know how to swim a little bit, or people who go boating out on the water, but either way, that person only ever stays on the surface of the water. They might know what is out there in the ocean, but they don't really care enough, or even want to go deeper into the water. Finally, you have us, the beautiful minded, INFJs, and we are the people who go scuba diving, and exploring into the ocean. We go out deeper and farther than anyone else, and discover all of these amazing things, and we constantly are wanting to learn more, and immerse ourselves into this new world. At the end of the day, we do go back to the beach, but we know whats out there, and we cannot wait to go back. The people who stay on the beach all day don't understand why we like the water, because to get out there and get to the depth that we thrive in, we have to fight so many different waves and its hard. And the people on the beach, are content with their sunbathing lives, and that is so confusing to us. We will feel alone, because less than 1% of the world is INFJ, but we live for those days where we can possibly break through to someone and they will dive into the depths with us. Sometimes, I wish I was one of the people who is completely comfortable with just staying on the beach, because it seems a lot easier. But in the end, I actually feel bad for them, because they will never know what it's like to discover something, or have such a deep thought and then continue building upon it. Every personality has its blessings, and its curses, but I wouldn't change anything about being an INFJ, because imagine a world where you just barely skimmed the surface on anything, where things are black and white, and not a vast majority of colors in between that light up the world. We are so lucky to have such an immense hunger for knowledge, and we are blessed to have the talent of listening to people because we can understand their problems deeper than anyone else. I believe that if people even had a small glimpse of what we have, they would never want to go back. Yes, we are very vulnerable to things like depression, and anxiety, and they are such hard and difficult waves to battle with, but that just means that we feel something, and it is proof that you are human, because I would rather feel something than nothing. We are extremely different than any other personality but I think that is where the beauty arises, because people who are the same, don't change the world. It's the people who are different that make a difference, and no matter how small that difference is, its still a drop in the ocean. Sometimes being an INFJ might feel like a curse, but I promise you, that it is a blessing."
infj,3dqejy,be_maryy,5,Sat Jul 18 22:57:25 2015 UTC,"Yes. Especially now that I've come to realize I probably was not destined to be an INFJ when I was born. But rather I became an INFJ as the result of being raised by a narcissistic, cold, controlling and critical mother.

infj,3dqejy,Skryym,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:15:33 2015 UTC,"This is really interesting.  Most of my life I've been drawn to ISFJ's and ESTP's as heroes.  Who doesn't want to be a faithful leader, courageous and caring rescuer, or a devil-may-care hero?  Almost all our fictional heroes from the comfortable world of books are grounded in these personalities.    Sometimes, I've gotten these results on tests simply because that is who I want to see myself as.  This also convinces me that I may not be an INFJ.  Maybe it's just who I see myself as.   So what does all this mean?  In all the videos I have watched, there is some understanding between these types.  While I'm not an expert, they all share Fe and Ti as either auxiliary or tertiary functions.  While my understanding of these functions is shallow, it's an accurate pattern I observed, which means that while I am not sure of my personality, it must be utilize Fe and Ti to some extent.  This of course, leaves the inferior and dominant functions out of the picture.  The ESTP may be lead with Se but I'm humble enough to admit that it's really something I have to work on, and always takes the backseat.    It really makes me wonder how much Ni has to play in this, which to me is the hardest to research to do it's obscure nature and lack of true information surrounding it.  Perhaps I don't even display it, and it's really a combination of Si/Fi that I'm not even aware of?  EDIT: Need to add something.  A long time ago, a teacher made my class take a personality test that divided us into four animals...  then he gave a big description about each animal and how we lived our lives like that...  then he stopped and looked around.  After that long pause, he said, ""Now you just let me define you, and sort you off into cliques.  You just let my turn you into a cog.  Now it's true: your underlying personality may be who you are...  but life is demanding and mysterious.  At times, an owl may need to become a lion.  Or vice versa.  Don't let a definition of who you are stop you from being happy and doing what is right.""  He was right.  Again, I'm not sure I'm an INFJ, but the type INFJ itself is Ni, Fe, Ti, Se, and people seem like they are constraining themselves.  Even if these functions are who they are, we can still be adventurous and spontaneous...  At the same time we can be cold and cynical.    Sorry for rambling.  I've been doing a lot of research.  I don't have an organized thesis in my head so anything I write is just this massive mess."
infj,3dqejy,KStreetFighter2,2,Sat Jul 18 17:05:23 2015 UTC,"I will tell you that Si and Ni are almost polar opposites, so my guess is that it wouldn't actually be very hard for you to determine which you use if you read about those functions.  Ni is concerned with the ""big picture"", Si is concerned with the ""small details""; Ni is concerned with the future, Si is concerned with the past; Ni is concerned with what could be, Si is concerned with what was.   Ni is like a collection of poems, and Si is like a diary. INFJs and ISFJs are very, very different. My SO is an ISFJ so I have a little bit of experience lol.   Also, everyone is a person, everyone still has all of the functions. Your type just tells you which functions you prefer to use. If I threw something at you, you would block it with your dominant hand without thinking, it doesn't mean you can't use your other hand though."
infj,3dqejy,Skryym,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:24:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the information!  It's almost funny how much self-doubt bubbles up when I consider each and every function, especially Ni.  What's even funnier is that I may actually be using that function to doubt that function.  It's especially true for Ti, or at least in the way I understand it.  The past/present/future tense of Ne and Ni always confuse me.  While I live for my future plans (something I don't define as healthy) I'm constantly taking information that bubbles up from my past.  New ideas and emotions that I only now recognize.  Then I apply these to how things are now and how I use them in the future.  As I get older, I recognize more patterns in relationships and use them to build on ideas that I'm focused on.  Sometimes I feel this is Ni (or Ne?) because of the extraordinary introspection involved, and sometimes I feel that I should have recognized those relationships in the first place, and it must actually be a sensing or thinking function that brought it out."

I wish I had that fearlessness and courage to stand against what rules I find unjust or oppressive all the time, rather than only finding that courage when I'm extremely enraged.

infj,3dqcuh,Jesuncolo,3,Sat Jul 18 22:50:04 2015 UTC,Are we talking appearances or behavior? Either way I think a male infj is harder to spot at that age because they can seem very similar to some NT types if they haven't properly developed their second function FE. You have to get to know them to really confirm.
infj,3dqcuh,Anjello,3,Sat Jul 18 16:17:37 2015 UTC,"Everytime I take MBTI test, I always get not more, than 20% for [F]eeling and I was also little confused if I'm not INTJ. This subreddit resolved my doubts. :)"
infj,3dqcuh,HamFlavouredCola,2,Sat Jul 18 16:31:38 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah same here. I thought I was intj for a long time until I saw a post about common male infj mistypes. I learned about the functions a bit, and after a while I had a nagging feeling in the back of my head that a lot of the intj profile fit me, but not enough to where I was convinced. So I'd say trust your judgement on that."

I'd say they are quiet and reserved people. Presumably listening to different types of rock music (rather than rap, or electronic, or any other kind). And they're just usually shy and avoid crowded places. It's not always easy to tell, if someone's precisely INFJ, it's more of an ""inside"" thing, what is going in our minds, less about presenting it to the outside world. Get to know that person and maybe even suggest him to do a personality test, if he's willing. That should resolve your doubts"

Not completely sure I'm an INFJ, but I've done a lot of research on Ni/Se and Fe/Ti and feel like it's a lot better fit than the contrary.  Of course, other functions could still be developing.  If I don't have my backpack (which has my primary fortress of books) I'll usually carry a smaller book in my pants so I can read it in ""social"" situations and not feel awkward.    Also in social situations, I'll either be on the edge of a conversing group or along the edge of a group, staring off into space.  I tend to wear modest, earth toned clothing.  Usually long sleeves.  I have to have pockets to carry notebooks, writing utensils, and books.    Spotting an INFJ would have much less to do with physical appearance as it does with manners and demeanor."
infj,3dqcuh,Skryym,3,Sat Jul 18 16:57:24 2015 UTC,I'm a 22 INFJ M.  I really didn't care for high school so I dk if this will apply to your interest but here it goes. Some months I dressed nice other months I would look sloppy and rewarding close. I hate a tight group of friends but I could easily assimilate to any group setting. I wasn't popular in the sense where I would be on homecoming court but because of my personality type a lot of people confided in me allowing me to able to hangout with any group. I was lost in my thoughts a lot to the point where you could be yelling my name 30ft away empty campus and I would never hear you. I disliked people because I picked up on the fact a lot of people would be in my life when they needed some counseling and I just didn't feel like I was ever being heard or appreciated except from my group of friends. I just really wanted to get out in the world and focus on the deeper things in life.  I was also oblivious to girls liking me. I've always mistaken flirtation for kindness. I hope some of this has helped!

I have a weird mixture of confidence and low self esteem. I have faith in myself to do some things, then none for others. To sum it up, I don't have faith in my ability to do things, but I have strong convictions and beliefs.  I listen to really all kinds of good music, most of its indie and of the rock variety. I'm a fan of wearing military style clothing. I don't dye my hair or any of that sort. (Not that there is anything wrong with that.) I hang out with the same 3 or 4 guys a lot and have grown very close to them over the years. I've been told that I have a good sense of humor, and most people I know respect me, some admire me. (It's unbeknownst to me why.) I'm a fan of black clothing, and conspiracy theories. I could go on political rants for days.

Draco was just trying to please his parents, in my mind, and was only acting the way he was raised to - once he was getting a mind of his own he wavered from that a bit, and that's good enough for me.      Oh my gosh yes, his death was even more sad than I'd imagined. Sad in the way that any character death is sad, but also pitiful. Undignified, even. In some kind of damp and ugly shack near the lake? Really? Ugh. Also surprised that they didn't touch on Fred's death a little more."

We packed lunch and stopped by to get iced coffee, then drove up north and hung out at my favorite beach, talked about anything and everything, read books and took photos of each other, then we drove to a real touristy area northwest and got pineapple ice cream.   I guess it was more of a stable happy memory than intense. Definitely one of my favorites. I look back at this and I feel sappy and sad.

The moment began when I realized we were very identical people. The moment ended when someone walked into the room.   Earlier that day we had met on an orientation day. It started by racing to doors to hold them open for each other, and the other people. Eventually we started talking about our families, which are very similar. We both have the same struggle to be ourselves at home, and both escape to local parks to relax. We both have inconvienient love lives. We both need deep emotion from someone to feel worth the effort of staying alive. We both have a history of self-harm. We discovered we have basically everything in common. We had both been alone and depressed the day or two previous to arriving, and both needed each other to feel alive. This person during the day made my day feel perfect, but it was bugging the hell out of me how this person intuitively knew what would make me feel happy and loved. We had gotten really close really quickly, and at that moment on the couch I realized that we are identical in personality too. I realized that all day she had been treating me how she would want to be treated, I had done the same for her, and naturally and without thinking, we were loving each other in the exact way that we wanted to be loved. I wanted to see her smile, so I smiled at her, she turned and began hugging me just as I realized I wanted a hug. I wanted to be held so I held her close. She leaned her ear on my shoulder and I enjoyed it. I leaned my head on hers, and her heartbeat I felt got faster. we hugged like that for eternity until someone was coming down the hallway. We both went back to our previous positions and tried to act cool before they arrived."

Someone to force us to enjoy ourselves, someone to be our leader, someone who can make us feel energetic and motivated, and someone to rely on when we are unsure or unstable, but trying to be those things for each other felt really weird and messed up.

infj,3domyd,hintofsass,3,Fri Jul 17 23:59:43 2015 UTC,"It's like I'm two entities my entire life. My mind and body.   That seems to be a common enough INFJ problem where we can have a rather estranged relationship with our own bodies or sometimes the physical world in general. It's often attributed to our repressed Se, but spending so much of our time in our head doing Ni things trying to guess at the future also tends to widen the breach.  INFJs can prefer to approach things from a more intangible level, and often can have complicated and uncomfortable feelings about their physical natures and urges.  Instead of ""I am my body"" many would say ""I have a body"". It's not universal, so YMMV.  In terms of exercise, I enjoy physical work a lot more now than I did when I was younger. I still don't really care for exercising for exercise's sake, unless I'm really trying hard to achieve something.  Usually I have to disguise my workouts as something else or they need to fill dual purposes.  I like hot yoga because it gives my heart cardio exercise, I work on my flexibility, but more than that it's a mental vacation.  I get my upper body workout on the farm lifting large bags of corn and crates of veggies.  I like walking for hours because I enjoy the outdoors, but it's nice that it also burns fat.  Find something that works for you so you'll actually do it. Forcing yourself is not sustainable and leads to resentment."

infj,3domyd,catch-24,3,Sat Jul 18 01:40:45 2015 UTC,The thing about exercise is that the more you do it the less you don't want to. Eventually you'll get to the point where you're exercising regularly and if you miss a day you feel like there's something missing.  I would like to get in the routine of going for a bike ride and doing yoga every morning. It's hard just to get up early enough.

I'm hoping someone can help explain what is happening in terms of my body feeling like it's not who I am and not really apart of me?    Assuming you're correctly typed as INFJ, this is inferior Se talking. Se is all about being present in the physical world and experiencing bodily sensations/pleasure, etc. This is our last function, so we're just naturally not great at using it. There's nothing wrong with you, but seeing as our function stack is rare, it's easy to feel like you're the odd one out. You have to practice using Se, and it gets stronger with age/experience.  Start exercising, OP! Don't go overboard; take it slowly. Start with home exercises like squats, planking, push-ups, etc. Increase the amount you do every other night or so. It's definitely worth it. It's my opinion that inferior Se-users (INXJ) more than anyone else should be regularly engaging in physical activity. It's essential for not only our health and well-being, but also for our growth as human beings with our particular make-up :)  Also, speaking from personal experience, regular exercise has greatly improved my self-esteem and mental health."

My advice though is to train rather than do exercise, have a goal. For example, if I ever needed to, could I get outside of a 5 mile radius of my house within a certain time frame? After doing so, how able am I to get 10 miles out, etc. Mine's more military/combat oriented. I'll do random sprints during my jogs to practice if I ever needed to run. Any kind of self defense skills are great for this too, and they're practical. Even without the scenario-based training, the release I get from running is amazing. I feel considerably better for the rest of the day. I also quit drinking soda, it's not that hard, it's the only thing I've done diet wise and it's helped tremendously. Stick to meats. If you're working hard you need the protein, plus I'm a carnivore so it helps me stick to everything else :).  I used to hate it earlier on during middle school because I was forced to. I thought I'd never like it, but then I had some weight to lose and I came to love it. I also was going through some major depression, still am to an extent, but exercising helps alot with your confidence in both your ability to do things, and living in your own skin."
infj,3domyd,Greasypatriot,2,Sat Jul 18 19:13:02 2015 UTC,"I hate exercise.  I just did ""water fasting"" to lose weight quickly, which is just a modern way of saying starving yourself so people don't freak the fuck out."
infj,3domyd,TheAnxiousArmadillo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:26:24 2015 UTC,"From a lot of reading material I've seen, it's quite recommended for keeping stress levels in check.  Here's a quick little quote from ""Personality Hacker"" on the matter:   As we said, [sensing] is really good, but you have to control the mechanism instead of being controlled by it. When you’re at the point that your [intuition] needs a break – and you’ll know it because it’s that point when you’ve totally hit a wall and almost can’t function – give it a break by going to a very simple, easy exercise you’ve already set up for yourself. (See exercise outlined in paragraph below) You usually don’t have to do it for more than 30 minutes, and that will give your [intuition] enough of a breather to come back refreshed.  In this case, find an immersive sensory experience that is simple, easy to do and that you won’t regret later. Some examples are taking a walk while listening to music, taking a bath or a shower, going for a swim or a run. (If you choose running or another form of exercise, try to do it in an environment that isn’t monotonous, for example trail running instead of a treadmill.)   Personally, I enjoy martial arts with various types of weapons.  I took an arnis and kenpo class for a while when I was younger, and I practice on my own now as a form of healthcare and stress relief.  It's fun for me, so it works pretty well."
infj,3domyd,Sequestrum,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:32:57 2015 UTC,"I prefer cycling. It also happens to be my primary mode of transportation, and I'm blessed to live in a bike-friendly city.  Cycling is a solitary experience, though in a city one never feels completely disconnected. You can decide to push yourself as hard as you want, and it's a journey you can savour by yourself, or with others if you so desire. There's a nice article over at Walrus magazine which discusses the life of artist Greg Curnoe who was killed in a bike accident, but whose life as an artist, Dadaism, and cycling were closely intertwined."
infj,3domyd,drukq,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:32:31 2015 UTC,For us on here the body is a strange and amazing thing. This is a very long story but there are ways to literally transcend your body. This is a murky topic. But literally it's as physical in nature as a rock falling to the ground. I learned quite a while back to never bring up this topic. I had a dream just last night I was explaining this to a doctor. Then I woke up and scolded myself.  If you guys are interested let me know it's getting late. This is not meditation or yoga or Pilates. Its implications are deep and thought provoking to say the least. We are talking about the physical circuitry of what makes us human primates.

I'm not a fan of running/walking though.  I definitely notice a difference in my mental acuity and emotional state when I regularly go to the gym. Not to mention how much better my body feels when I push myself.  I've missed this past week because of some major commitments I've had that cut into my usual gym time, and I feel like trash for missing. Looking forward to getting back on Monday."
infj,3domyd,Spinnak3r,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:38:14 2015 UTC,"I used to be this way.  I hated exercise, and I had a real disconnect with my body.  Now, I love it.  I honestly do.  That post-workout-post-shower feeling is one of the best in the world (yay endorphins!).  I started to get in to exercise because I was actually scared about how much I was probably shortening my life by eating crap and not working out.  I quickly learned that if I still eat like crap, I'm gonna feel like crap regardless of how much exercise I did, so I began making small and sustainable changes to my diet that, over time, added up to a completely different way of eating (80% clean, 20% whatever I feel like is how I eat now).  I avoid alcohol and caffiene because they make my guts angry and mask the natural signals I receive from my body.  I can eat intuitively for the first time in my life.  And as the food fuelling my body became better, I found I had more energy and more drive to exercise.  So I did.  I started at three days a week with yoga.  Then I thought I'd see how I got on with weights and cardio.  Then a challenge.  Then another one.  Four days a week.  Five.  Now, I exercise five days a week, for a total of four and a half hours.  I walk during my lunch hours as well, so I guess you could say I have a good seven hours of non-essential activity a week.  I am training for a 10k obstacle course in September, and I fucking love all of it.  I have a great connection with my body now that I never had before in my life.  I love the feeling of adding more weight to my routine, of meeting those personal goals.  Getting stronger and faster.  Gaining more stamina.  Actually seeing my muscles grow.  I love it.  If you want a better mind-body connection, in my experience it starts with what you're eating.  Eat enough of the right things, cut out artificial stimulants and depressives, and your body balances out.  You'll find yourself with more energy, that will push you to work out.  And then it's just a part of who you are and how you live.  You have to be committed, though.  You can't view it as a temporary thing.  You have to recognise it for what it is--a lifestyle change done in manageable chunks.  Don't try to overhaul everything at once; it's a recipe for failure.  Make a change, keep it for a month, add in another one.  Continue."

Luckily no one has asked me to take them to Lothlórien.   Your story sort of reminds me of this semi-homeless man we had in our small town growing up that the kids called Old Irish Grandpa. It's not really an INFJ thing, more like strong Fe mixed with passivity thing.  Whenever I was by myself in public he'd seek me out like a magnet and tell me his life story; one time he even started crying after playacting his childhood out for me in various voices.  It was very uncomfortable, but I also didn't want to be rude, and I felt for the old guy who was obviously very lonely. I was in high school and every time I ran into one particular classmate of mine outside of school, I was always with this very emotional old man haha. Thank goodness my classmate would stick around so I wasn't left alone with him, or he'd help extract me from the situation. When I was 18 I worked at a local flower shop and I realized it was next to the store where Old Irish Grandpa got his cigars, so when he'd pass by the window I'd hide behind the counter so he wouldn't come in and talk to me for hours while I worked my shift alone.  I felt guilty, but man, I had enough of re-enacted childhood traumas delivered in babytalk while reeking of cigar smoke to last a lifetime. He didn't do this to any of my other friends or classmates as far as I could tell."

At first, I thought I might just be being a little self-involved, but then friends and family  members would point it out too. Like, in the part of the world were I'm from, it's pretty common to respect people's personal space. Generally, if someone enters a room where there's seating, for example, they won't sit next to/near a person they don't know if there's open seats elsewhere. However, people ALWAYS seem to want to sit near me. Sometimes they talk to me, sometimes they don't, but I almost always have to deal with it. Nine times out of ten, I just want to be left alone.

He'd say he was hungry and I kept giving him my lunch. It's like I couldn't help myself. I knew that if I ignored it that I would beat myself up for the rest of the day and imagine the guy starving to death in the streets.

This happened more often than necessary, and all the times that happened, I had to explain to them for an hour how my disclosure will only hurt them because I feel that there is a right timing.  When I actually tell them the truth (say, a friend's defense mechanism killing his relationship with his girlfriend), they'll get bent out of shape. Go figure.

People do take my jokes seriously many times, but not to the point where they'll be like whoa wtf; word choices are very important for me when cracking jokes.  I don't think I'm being dissected by the people around me in any way. In fact, I dissect and analyze them. I don't get pissed when somebody tells me something they felt about me, because, honestly, I'm all ears and am interested in perspectives.  When it comes to injustice, I'm more sensitive to unequal treatment, not sweeping generalizations. I respect (or I try my best to respect) people's various backgrounds and mindsets, so I guess I can fake it to make it most of the time."

If you're not careful then it's easy to project a lot of your own tendencies, like dissecting and over analyzing, onto other people who never had the inclination.  I think it's easy to get pissed off when others misunderstand you, but you've got to cut other people some slack. They aren't inside your head, and chances are, you're also misreading them to a certain extent. If your feelings are clouded with a lot of insecurities and anger, then you can't fully trust what you read from others.   One strategy that's really helped me is to take another person's motives at face value, at least at first. If someone says something mean, or crosses a boundary, or snubs me in some way, then I assume they meant nothing by it. If it becomes a pattern over time, then I feel more confident in the judgement. I feel like it's made me a much better person to give others the benefit of the doubt for as long as possible."

I've never been dissected or overanalysed, at least not to my face.  Even if I had, I genuinely don't care what anyone thinks, so I wouldn't feel offended by it.

infj,3dmij1,gallerdude,5,Fri Jul 17 13:59:39 2015 UTC,"I worked in retail for 8 years. Here are my recommendations: 1. Make up a script that you use with customers. Once you get used to using it, you can modify it to apply better to the individual customer.  2. Focus only on the space immediately around you. It's easy to get overwhelmed if you take everything in. 3. Stay cordial with everyone and don't get too involved.  If you do all these things and you're in a decent environment, you might actually start to believe you enjoy the job."
infj,3dmij1,SteveLIESman,2,Fri Jul 17 14:05:09 2015 UTC,"This, plus I started every shift with the intention of really helping one customer.  I worked at REI, so it was a little different, but whether it was helping someone find the perfect gift, helping a lost child, or sharing a joke to make a lonely person smile, if I succeeded in REALLY helping one person, then I felt like my time was well spent.  When things looked really grim, I made a special effort to have stickers in my pockets for fussy babies, crayons and coloring sheets to give to bored kids, etc.  Investing in improving other's experiences improves your own :)"
infj,3dmij1,Johnjo01,4,Fri Jul 17 16:22:04 2015 UTC,"Haha my summer job is on a farm and when I end up in the farm stand I too fill a lot of produce.  Talking to customers does help. Especially the more you know about your product, how to prepare it, where it comes from, etc. the more useful you can be. Half of my job is educating customers about their food and how to use it. That includes which parts are/aren't edible and even my favorite recipes.  It's nice when they come back excited about how well it went, looking for new suggestions. One old lady even made me a jam sandwich with the berries I sold her, which was super cute <3   My environment is slightly different than yours, but I love seeing regular customers and I know many by name if not by face. I can tell how much they enjoy it when I recognize them and can remember our past conversations and ask how they've been doing. It makes them feel not only special but a lot of loyalty to our store.  The rest of my week is spent doing digital freelance work by myself, so I sort of revel in the physicality of my side job. It's ""mindless"" but you can still take pride in what you do. When I'm working, that farm stand is clean, fully stocked, and organized as heck. I try to create both a physical and mental/emotional environment that make people want to return.  When I'm not interacting with people, I find it really easy to just let my hands do the work and my brain is off doing something else. It's sort of nice."

And fortunately for my job right now it's at a small local store, so regulars come in all the time and I recognize them and know their names.  However, when the talking can be too much (which, it tooootally can be) I just kind of change my tone and try to show my discontinued interest. Or, if your store is big, just say you need to go do something else.  I used to work at a big retail store (ROSS...it was a soul sucking time) and I started bringing my headphones and a book to read during my breaks. That was fantastic because most often I was not interested in talking to my co-workers (especially about the same things everyday). So maybe try that!"

I hate the predictability of other jobs. Retail is always surprising. It gives me an outlet for my extroverted side, but the social interactions are short lived and easy to escape from if I need to. I get to use my intuition to predict unpredictable things--like level of business any given hour, or what kind of shit a customer is trying to pull on me. I get to use counselor/diplomatic skills to smooth things over with angry customers. A lot of the problems I face in retail involve keeping people happy--which is something I am very good at.   Retail can be tough for a young INFJ. However, we are very well suited to jobs in the service industry. We know what to say and how to say it to keep people happy and motivate the people around us.  You just have to make sure the place you work for isn't going to exploit your helpful nature. We need to feel like we are needed and are performing important work. Some retail jobs like to make you feel that you can be replaced at the drop of a hat. Don't waste your energy helping businesses that treat you as expendable."

When i first started working i was absolutely terrified of speaking to customers because i felt like i would know how to respond to them in my role. Anyways I've gotten passed it and feel really comfortable now.   What i found to facilitate feeling natural in my retail position is having a few lines to say when greeting a customer and improvising it. Such as saying hi, and asking ""is there is anything i could help you with/find today?"", or ""are you finding everything okay today?"" I usually determine what i say based on the persons body language, if they look confused, or are looking all over to find something.  I don't necessarily need to say much to people unless they are very outgoing to me, which i reciprocate. I also try to give them space, nobody likes to feel like they're being pressured having someone hanging over them. I'm just nonchalant with them.   You work produce so i don't how well this will help but hopefully you get something from it."

When I need to feel better I won't go for a new movie, but a very familiar one I've seen many times.  Either something from my childhood or early adulthood that I loved, especially if it has an element of lightness, silliness or fantasy.  I'm not a very nostalgic person, but in these cases I find revisiting the past incredibly useful.   If you haven't seen them already, I'd recommend some of Miyazaki's  cartoons like My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away, or Ponyo. I find it impossible to not be affected by the childlike wonder and simple goodness in those films. They're like a visual hug."

I was at San Diego Comic Con one year where he was going to be given an award by Pixar's John Lasseter, so my other animator friend and I got up super, super early to get in line. However, that was the same year ""Twilight"" came out and the line was already full of baby-twilight teens and their moms who were saving their places for a much later panel and had camped out overnight. When I thought we weren't going to be able to see him because of them, I wanted to start bashing heads in a very uncharacteristic INFJ way >:(    Luckily we made it in and I spent the afternoon swooning instead of in jail :D"

infj,3dm761,TheSuperLur,3,Fri Jul 17 15:49:23 2015 UTC,"I made a comment recommending Miyazaki before I saw this reply!  Those movies are so wonderful! Meaningful character development, symbolic themes, beautiful artwork & soundtrack... they really fulfill all of my senses and put me in my happy place :)   FYI, do not watch Grave of the Fireflies unless you're wishing to cry rivers.  Another recommendation I have is the show Steven Universe on Cartoon Network (you can easily find it online, new episodes are still being made). It's made by a writer who helped create Adventure Time, so it can kind of be compared to that show (except its way better). Another INFJ friend and I have started watching it and we both love it! It has great character development & themes, all while being so innocent and child-like. Episodes are 11 minutes long so its really nice if you're looking for a quick break to relax!"

There's just hasn't been a moment where I think to myself, ""boy, I'm really in the mood to be emotionally devastated right now.""  Another one that made me cry, but in a good way, was ""Only Yesterday"". It completely mirrored where I was in my life at the time I saw it, and really drew strong parallels to my childhood as well, so by the end I was sobbing. My sister walked in and was like, ""what is wrong with you?!"" and then I made her watch it with me and I started sobbing AGAIN! It's a really understated but sweet film.   Also, I'm a huge fan of Steven Universe and I completely agree with you.  I even downloaded their RPG game on my phone because I couldn't get enough of it. It has some really interesting and sophisticated relationship dynamics for a ""kid's"" show."
infj,3dm761,TheSuperLur,2,Fri Jul 17 20:36:22 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize what I was getting into when I started watching it!

Definitely proceed with caution.  I haven't watched Only Yesterday. I'll definitely give that one a shot!   Yes, Steven Universe is brilliant, honesty. There are some really solid morals for kids to learn from many of the themes and it also does a great job of catering to both kids and adults! I'm also a sucker for cute animations.

So when I'm in a very emotionally volatile situation, I feel completely discombobulated about how to process what I'm going through. For an emotional purge, watching the right movie lets you relate to another character and feel for them in a way which mirrors what you should be feeling for yourself and it helps you work through those emotions imo.  If you want a movie about love, individuality, compromise and sacrifice, you might want to try Whale Rider. It's really sweet, but you can also get a really good cry in that will make you feel better."

My solution is as follows; I'll just be completely open with the new person, stating ""I have a tendency to come on really strong because it's rare for me to like someone enough to want a friendship with them, so please please please do tell me if I'm smothering you. Do not be afraid to say 'Hey super_brownie, how the hell am I supposed to miss you if you never go away?!' and I in turn promise to take that as good natured ribbing and not get butt-hurt about it.""  This I have found has worked the best as the people who would be turned off by my seemingly endless enthusiasm about THEM will respond negatively or not at all and then I can write that person off and the people who don't mind it, are willing to be honest, or thrive off it (like my ESFP girlfriend, hehe) will be glad for the clarity and honesty.  Here's the thing; I know we want everyone we like to like us back just as much but people have lives and most people don't spend an entire afternoon agonizing about whether or not they sent too many texts this morning and trying to work out a formula to navigate the social anxiety (Well, if they text me back within five minutes, its ok to text them back a couple times or a long text. If they take more than five minutes, I should hold back or maybe even pretend to be busy.... etc etc.) If you're like me, this is hard because you want to feel ""loved"" and you want people to be into you and if they fall short of your expectations, you get hurt and then want to withdraw... which causes some to dismiss you and some to then come after you to see what's wrong at which point you then come back full force, you get the point. In the end, as it always does for me, it comes down to being as open and honest as possible about what's going on in your head and what you're expecting of the other person so that they aren't left wondering what the hell is going on when you are sad that they didn't return your last email after emailing with you all morning. Be honest. Be vulnerable. I know that's hard and scary and uncomfortable but no one can read your mind (except maybe other infj's hehe) so you don't really have a right to get mad at them or hurt when they don't magically know you had a different expectation of them.  One thing that's helped me a lot is realizing there are literally billions of people on this planet. It's ok if some people don't like you and it's ok to just be out there with you and let other people see your crazy, even if its just a peak, so you can evaluate if they are the kind of person who can handle that crazy.  TL;DR word vomit."
infj,3dkcho,hayshock,6,Fri Jul 17 06:27:52 2015 UTC,this is perfect- reading your description of our minds makes me almost teary eyed because I forget how there are others that experience what I go through as well. I just have a difficult time making myself let go

Recognizing the thought pattern and being aware of it can be enough to pull yourself out and when it's not, focusing on something else even something as simple as your breathing can help. Glad you got something from my ramblings!"
infj,3dkcho,HamFlavouredCola,3,Fri Jul 17 14:08:34 2015 UTC,"That is awesome man :D The explanation you gave I mean. If what you wrote is mainly INFJ characteristic ""this is hard because you want to feel ""loved"" and you want people to be into you and if they fall short of your expectations, you get hurt and then want to withdraw[...]"" then now I'm pretty reassured that I am INFJ as I have exactly the same. I lately started to be more honest with people as I kept getting angry and frustrated when they couldn't understand me, or I couldn't understand them. I guess things are pretty much easier that way.  ""so you don't really have a right to get mad at them or hurt when they don't magically know you had a different expectation of them"" - that was my biggest problem, but I hope it'll change from now on. I feel like I need to calm down sometimes and quit thinking OBSESSIVELY about ""Why is this happening?"" ""Why is he/she like that?"" and just be honest and write what's on my mind."
infj,3dkcho,Super_Brownie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:51:43 2015 UTC,Yup exactly. It's hard when your mind gets stuck in those obsessive thought patterns. What have you found helps you break out?

infj,3dkcho,nima_ahsey,8,Fri Jul 17 13:32:57 2015 UTC,"It's straight from the profile that INFJs seek a complete and holistic picture of the things that interest them. When you meet someone new you don't feel like you know them until you know all of them. So you jump right in.   The problem's not the instinct, it's the jumping right in without pacing, whereas other types don't operate that way, or may interpret it as an emotion of insecurity or clinginess without realizing it is a part of who you are."
infj,3dkcho,Super_Brownie,5,Fri Jul 17 07:02:17 2015 UTC,Yes yes yes on the whole seeking out the complete and holistic picture thing. Ugh this applies to every facet of my life and I hate it.
infj,3dkcho,mackinaw_peaches,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:31:56 2015 UTC,"I totally get that sentiment but try not to hate it, embrace it! You have a deeper understanding of the things you love than other people might because of it. I love the fact that I can get lost in a subject and I think it's made me a better student. Academia is where I first embraced this part of my personality with the result that most professors have told me I put graduate level work into my undergrad courses. It can be frustrating when this backfires and you feel inadequate when talking about something you aren't an expert in, but use that too! Ask questions, be curious, challenge what you think you know. And in relationships this can serve you really well resulting in you being an attentive, loving, and focused partner and friend. :)"

infj,3dkcho,Faerelin,5,Tue Jul 21 07:50:00 2015 UTC,"Maybe work on trying to draw out people instead of inquiring. I find that if I'm really curious about someone, I can go at them really hard and it almost comes off as an interrogation. Better to just let people talk about themselves."
infj,3dkcho,BigBizzle151,2,Fri Jul 17 00:20:41 2015 UTC,How do you draw them out ?
infj,3dkcho,Faerelin,5,Fri Jul 17 18:52:08 2015 UTC,"Short, open-ended questions. Reflect their emotions and statements. Try to get a sense of what they're trying to say, repeat it back to them, and see if they correct you or elaborate on what you've put forth. When you contribute statements, use anecdotes from your own experiences that correlate with the person's emotional state. Be careful not to cut off their statements, maintain focus on their face. Acknowledgement words and sounds (an 'um-hmm' and 'oh right' as someone is speaking to indicate you're on board works well)."
infj,3dkcho,peepster1973,2,Fri Jul 17 19:33:45 2015 UTC,"Really nice answer, thanks :)"
infj,3dkcho,sarcasticIntrovert,6,Sun Jul 19 13:37:21 2015 UTC,"Ugh. Yes. I hate hearing this. Oddly enough, other INFJ's are the worst about pointing this out to me (and often doorslamming soon after.) It makes sense, but I'm NOT clingy, dammit. I just want to know everything about you. 😝 I want to make sure you're who you present yourself to be. I do my research and if I find something that seems ""off"" then I guard myself against it. It may mean that I pull back from the relationship. It's to protect myself, not because I'm obsessed or stalking you. I'm aware it may come across as creepy. I swear I'm harmless, though."
infj,3dkcho,phaselinebravo,3,Fri Jul 17 12:46:13 2015 UTC,"""Clingy"" is a term I've heard describe ENFJs, our extroverted counterparts, so I wouldn't be surprised if some of us leaned towards being a little clingy sometimes.  Personally I don't think I'm very clingy, but it may be because I've had some really clingy friends. I try to go out of my way to not bother people subconsciously because I always feel the need to be accepted by others... it can be an issue. :P"

Something's always going to pique your interest, so I'd just talk to different people because no one person is really ""worth it"" until something does happen."

infj,3dkcho,Thunder_54,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:56:24 2015 UTC,YES. I think people these days confuse clingy with true interest. Most people are taken aback by us because we actually want to know that person we are interested in. To know EVERYTHING. No wonder we come off as intense.

But I often find I don't need to read more than a few sentences to figure someone out. When I encounter someone that I get that vibe or feeling that they aren't a good person I never invest myself into that person at all.  I also try to protect anyone I care about from that person, using discretion.   It can actually be a good growth opportunity to learn from these people you get the vibe from.  You have to remember that they are not bad or evil people but it's their actions which you don't agree with.  If you really want to try something different try to see things from this persons perspective. Can you see why they made the choices they made? Don't focus on the act but more what the person was thinking to come to that decision. The more you can get into other people minds the more you can help other people."

Having a delightful conversation comes to mind, though many other things are also applicable to the quote. An environment (e.g., a coffee shop) or the cost to arrive to an environment (i.e., traveling abroad) may cost money, but having a bona fide human interaction is much richer than what actually costs money. And fortunately, delightful conversations don't need to cost money. They can take place anywhere."

I remember when I was really young, I was really really upset and angry about something, so I like stormed off into the living room like having a tantrum. And on the floor there was this book, it was like a maths book for super young kids, and it had this cartoon picture of a wizard on the front, all smiling and stuff. So I looked at his face, and I suddenly thought about how there must be loads of men in a factory somewhere, and they had all gone and put together this book for me to help me learn maths, and they'd drawn this big smiling wizard on the front to make me happy, and I was letting them all down by being in such a rotten mood about everything.

No one was trying to shove religion down my throat, they were just trying to help me be happy and fulfilled.. They were also being vulnerable about their deepest convictions. It was a life changing moment, and not just in a spiritual sense. It's just that there are people out their trying to make the world brighter, and pushing them away is an insult in its own right."

This made me think I was an extrovert at first, but no, I always needed to ""recharge"" and spent time alone writing and reflecting, even when I was very young, as soon as I learned how to write. I think this was my J showing, and later my teachers called it ""leadership skills"" (Maybe that I had strong moral sense?) And put me in special classes for it. I didn't actively exercise my leadership skills until I was in college...at least in my perception."

My family remembers lots of them because I was like a little alien child to them. (My entire family are sensors and the majority are also extroverted... my sister has since told me it was like living with someone who spoke an different language but used the same words.) Like if a kids normal question was ""why is the sky blue"" mine would be ""why isn't it green"" or ""is your blue my blue"". These were things I started asking when I was 3 or 4. (Maybe earlier but I only remember them then). My father is now 51... he just came to me with his revelation that we(people) might not see colors the same way. He told me it would blow my mind.

I recall memories as young as 5/6 of laying in bed at night considering what might possibly happen after I fell asleep. On stormy nights this would usually consist of a near certainty that a tornado would strike ( I live in Michigan, we don't have tornadoes) and on calm nights I would think about house fires or intruders. The interesting part isn't that I had these thoughts but that I would then run through the different scenarios of how I might react. How I would protect my baby sister, how I would save our toys. There were nights it would get so serious that I would climb out of bed and put the ""important toys"" in a box by the door so I could easily pick them up and run. This, folks, is where INFJ meets anxiety. I didn't grow up in an unsafe environment so I really have no explanation for the worry and planning other than its just the way I am."

And I don't remember being overly contemplative at all. Quite to the contrary, most of my free time was spent with my brother building dams and boats in the creek, and exploring the woods. I also wasn't afraid of being vulnerable as I am now. My mother always recalls how she bought me a hula-hoop in Walmart and I had to give the workers a ""show"" before I left.  However, I can recall more than a few books I would completely loose myself in, and I always had trouble making friends. There were only two people I called friends until grade 6, and now in college I would say I have 4 people I really trust, unless you count my ex who I still trust... It's just awkward."

This worried my parents and they thought there was something fundamentally wrong with me.  They also thought it was odd that I would tell them about things days after the event itself.  (Looking back, I think this was more my mother than my father, as my father is INTJ and a very similar temperment to myself).  When I was six, I was identified as gifted and enrolled in an after school programme.  I was mostly with older kids (eight through fourteen was the common age of those in the programme), but we all connected really well because we would have great conversations around our classes.    I must have been around eight or nine when I suddenly noticed other kids my age had lots of friends my age, and I didn't have any, and that kind of bothered me ... but even then, it was hard to actually connect with anyone because I was too weird.  I was always saying off-the-wall things, or trying to talk about the things I had learned in the gifted programme, and the other kids really couldn't connect with that at all.  Being smart made me even more weird than just being quiet had, and I was bullied quite badly for it.  It was around this point that I stopped doing homework, because it felt pointless to me.  This made the teachers frustrated, because I wouldn't do the homework but would get perfect marks on the tests.  They'd end up having to give me a lower grade for the course, because so much of the focus was on homework.  Most of my teachers would tell me to ""just hang in there until college.""  I didn't actually do homework again until university, unless it was homework I wanted to do, and I didn't make any friends until I was in high school (and they were as weird as me).  Despite all of this, I refused to change who I was to fit in (strong convinctions).

When I'm being too empathetic, I imagine my mind as a mental shield - a power that must be cultivated (like in Eragon) - and pretend that the other person is a wizard trying to break into my mind.   I've also developed healthy habits like escaping the situation for a break of negative energy by going for a walk, pulling out headphones and listening to a happy song, exercising.  I read a psychology article once that explained all you needed was two minutes of something positive to distract your mind from turning towards negative emotions if you are encountering it.   ie your boss ripping you a new one at work * pulls out picture of gf smiling on phone and reminisces of memory *"

I think meditation is helpful to EVERYONE (whether they know it or have given it a shot or not), but for our type it might be really helpful because we need to nourish our inner world. I really love shutting out the world.   I don't have a lot of alone time lately due to my job and living situation. I miss living alone and being able to light candles and meditate in the mornings and evenings so much.  I've taken a few classes, it's hard to make meditation a regular thing but there are apps and some Spotify guided meditation tracks that I've enjoyed using before."

Life gets hectic sometimes.  It's difficult to prioritize everything in its appropriate fixture,  especially when it's easy to fall in ""autopilot"".  Meditating for 5 minutes can even be beneficial.  And sometimes you just need to dissect the true form of meditating. It's basic fundamental form is in lotus position, eyes closed and calm breathing. I feel as if I can get the same effect when I'm sitting outside, basking in the view/smells/sounds and being aware of how I feel that very moment.  Meditation is the practice of awareness. Once you become aware, you can unlock vaults that treasure unimaginable rewards.  I might seem like I'm churching it up a bit, but I hadn't realized how much it's really helped me until recently. It's probably one of the most valuable lessons in my life."

infj,3djtbf,Greenbananas123,3,Thu Jul 16 21:09:01 2015 UTC,"Stuff I agree with/relate to, interesting contrast btw ENFP/ENTJ:  ENFP: Their mental process is called ‘Perspectives’. They’re actually watching their own mind work and form patterns. Because this isn’t something verifiable, other people just don’t believe them or reject what they radiate (why people think we're crazy). INFJs pair Perspectives with Harmony. When a person with the INFJ personality type tries to figure out what to do, the first thing that pops in their mind is, “how do we make sure everybody’s needs are met?” This process is in tuned with unspoken social contracts that we accept. (hard for Fi's to accept) INFJs who are developed and growth oriented don’t retreat to coldness. They’ve taken the harmony process in order to understand and create healthy boundaries. (commented this earlier, it's healthy for us) INFJs are also able to see how things will play out in the future and this is one of the reasons why they are hesitant to build intimacy with other people. (how things might play out) You don’t have to absorb other people’s emotions and have it stay there. You need to develop techniques to let it go. (very true my solution is exercise).  ENTJ: Knowing others’ types will help you craft realistic expectations for each person in your life' (yes ENTJs enjoy this too, if for sim but diff reasons). More than any other type, an INFJ is able to treat each person differently depending on their individual needs and personality. Which means that an INFJ needs to know what someone’s strengths and weaknesses are so the INFJ does not demand too much from that person. You will find that it’s freeing to not expect things of people they are not capable of delivering. (so freeing).   I agree with all of her headings/content here: Day One: Relationships: How to cultivate and care for important relationships. Day Two: Parenting. How to raise ethical and productive kids. Day Three: Career. Find a workplace that is consistent with your values."

Adapting to an environment which has been basically unfriendly towards my most intimate and instinctive qualities as an INFJ has filled large parts of my life. The way I naturally speak and comprehend my experience is very metaphor-like, making it hard for most people to comprehend. So I adapt and use concrete language, engage in practical life, pretend like I'm happy to not ruin the lives of those around me. Friends tell me they feel a deep connection with me and I pretend to reciprocate. I'm at a time in my life now where it's time to stop constantly adapting and rather live my own life and values. It won't be easy though.   I'm reminded by a quote from Carl Jung which really struck a chord with me: “As a child I felt myself to be alone, and I am still, because I know things and must hint at things which others apparently know nothing of, and for the most part do not want to know.”   Edit: Typo"

infj,3dhr1r,BantlingBee,2,Thu Jul 16 13:27:33 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm totally misreading this post, but it seems like you're complaining about 'The Friendzone'. Please correct me if I'm wrong.  The problem with 'plans' in any relationship, romantic or otherwise, is that you can't control another person's responses or feelings. The way in which this post is worded makes it sound like you went into the friendship with the 'plan' of making it a romantic relationship...that seems kind of disingenuous. Having been in a similar situation myself, I can say that it's just as frustrating to be on the opposite end--thinking that you've found someone who you can be real, sincere friends with--when it turns out that they aren't willing to be honest with you in the way a real friend would."

I'd rather cut off my manparts then be labeled as just a guy who can be pigeonholed with the words ""friendzone"" like I have no other depth besides romantic desires. Lust was a part of the problem I was having but that had nothing to do with the person I am or am trying to be. You are right. I should've been honest. I should've told her I wasn't feeling well. But back then the only options available to me that I could think off was us having a relationship that was just waving ""hello""  or I could suck it up and try to change what I thought was inevitable. .. I wasn't sure.. I wasn't 100% sure I couldn't change the end outcome.  I had to try. I always put her needs above mine and I didnt expect her love or thanks for it. All i wanted is to be treated well and she failed to do so."

I've gotten used to a lot of people (often men, but women too) who complain about 'the friendzone' like they're owed something--sex or romantic affection--for being kind to another person. Clearly that's not what you were getting at after reading your response.   It's unfortunate and extremely disappointing when people don't treat us the way that they should. I had a period of time in my life where it seemed like all my friendships ended because I was being 'taken advantage of' emotionally. There were a lot of people who had had hardships in their lives and I felt bad for them. So I became friends with them, but it was so one-sided and I never felt like I was appreciated. It got to the point where I would have been happy just being treated 'well', kind of like what you seem to be indicating. But, that's not real friendship. It seems like you've grown from this experience though, and realized that someone who IS a good friend won't only treat you well, but will also be grateful when you are being supportive."

Yes, the choosing of the set of actions/lies seem like a negative thing, but, personally, it was the only way to keep someone happy, keep her smiling, and etc.  But I think it is equally important to be honest with someone, especially if it is somebody who you truly care for. I guess the real question is, how badly do you want to keep in touch with the person. I've had my own experience in this, but then I would be writing an encyclopedia on here.

Once I chose to turn the acquaintance into something more, the rules change. Now they must ""get"" me. It's unfair to think a relationship born of lies can withstand the truth.

I've confessed to her that I'm absolutely crazy about her, but she's currently ""dating"" (she doesn't really know if she wants that relationship or not) somebody else. It's such a strange situation to be in, because I've never felt such an intense sense of loyalty to a girl. Not that I've never experienced loyalty, because I have; but this is something very fresh.  Bottom line. I'm okay being her friend.. Okay listening to her troubles and lending a shoulder for her tears.. I'm okay taking on scars for this girl  But scars, they are. I'm making myself available for her to let out frustrations. Most the time it's about the other guy.. Pain is worse to go through when you can't flinch. Because I feel as if that'll be weak in her eyes.. And I told her it was okay.. So if I'm display a weakness I promised I wouldn't show, then I'd be a liar..   It hurts to look at her, knowing that there's someone else. I mean... I know I'm probably sounding petty about all of this.. But I just want to be that man for her.

infj,3diztm,INTPenetrator,8,Sat Jul 18 21:24:41 2015 UTC,"Perhaps he does feel like you don't love him enough or show him enough affection, but that doesn't mean you don't give him your fair share, it just means that he requires more than that.  I've been close with both a female INTP and a male INTP. I often felt very distant from you guys, and I've got to say that I've always felt a lack of affection. I don't mean to say that I felt that you mentally lacked affection for me, but that there was no physical affection.   INFJs are a fickle bunch. Even when we have the BEST life could offer, we see that it could be better. You are most likely considered an amazing woman in his life. If he needs more affection, simply give him what he asks. Next time you have this discussion, ask him what type of affection he feels he is lacking from you. Is it physical, mental, emotional? When he says that he won't leave you, I am sure he won't. Most INFJs would never abandon their family like that, especially after how long you both have been together. It is not a trait of ours to leave our loved ones in emotional turmoil that we ourselves caused."
infj,3diztm,INTPenetrator,5,Thu Jul 16 21:09:48 2015 UTC,"Well, I can only speak from my own experience here.  For me, I am always (probably to a tragic end) looking for a perfect relationship.  There is usually a point, about 6-9 months into a relationship where I start critically evaluating a relationship and determining whether it is worth limiting my future possibilities.  That may sound cold, but it really is a reflex.  I don't actively seek to make the evaluation, it just happens. I think at this point, most people are trying to find a way to make the relationship continue, grow, and prosper. I, and I'm not sure if this is an INFJ thing or a personal quirk, am trying to objectively determine whether the relationship is worth continuing.   Usually, by this time, whatever initially interested me about the person has become less interesting, or is fully explained, and I find myself, frankly, bored. This is also where I may begin feeling trapped or ""commitment averse"" if I can't chart my way out of the relationship without disrupting friendships. I had a particular relationship in the past in which I felt like I was stuck in an abusive relationship for nearly a year, this has exacerbated my commitment aversion and actually made it harder for me to ever get into serious relationships.  INFJs don't live by an INFJ rule book. We are influenced by our INFJness, but we are also shaped by our own quirks and experiences.  I'd say my INFJness is (possibility a heroic flaw) always seeking perfection in a relationship.  I'm not looking for someone who is perfect, but I am looking for the perfect match on every level; emotional, physical, intellectual, etc. As soon as I realize that the person I am with is not that person, I very quickly become disinterested in a romantic relationship.  You boyfriend confuses me though, I would never have a child with someone I was not committed to. I don't want to make any assumptions about your relationship, but if the child was an accident, he might be experiencing an INFJ-ness feeling of being stuck and is stalling to figure out his priorities and chart his next move.  So, what do I think you should do? You need to confront him and not be satisfied until you are confident you have a real answer from him.  My feeling is that you ""not being affectionate enough"" is crap and he is just afraid of hurting your feelings with his true feelings.  I'm not saying it's hopeless because his true feelings have likely been bottled up in side him for a while are gone through vicious cycle after vicious cycle of baseless reinforcement through, among other things, confirmation bias.   The way he feels may be so incredibly skewed from reality that you need to snap him out of it.  I am guilty of this happening sometimes and I feel like it relates to my INFJness. At our best, INFJs are very good at digesting social information and drawing insightful and accurate conclusions. However, when we aren't at our best, this same process can cause us to draw baseless conclusions and continue to reinforce them with confirmation bias. We are also so stubbornly trusting of our intuition that you really do have to snap us out of it.  It won't be an easy conversation, and he'll likely be very defensive at first and spend a lot of time and effort trying to convince you that what he's said in the past has been true, but you need to keep pushing until it actually makes sense to you. My guess is that your inquisition into his true feelings will surprise him (as it sounds like a dynamic that hasn't really existed in your relationship up to this point) and probably rekindle some of his INFJ curiosity.  For me at least, that curiosity is what allows me to continue to commit to a relationship.  Sorry for the brick wall of a post -- it was sort of all over the place but I hope pieces of it are useful to you and I truly wish you the best of luck :).  TLDR; INFJ-ness can lead to being somewhat commitment averse in certain situations but I don't think that is the case here.  If this is really important to you, push him until he explains it to you in a way that makes sense and you know is true.  Edit: fixed my words"

Our daughter was not an accident, he was actually the one that decided he was ready to have a baby, 2 years into our relationship. He claims that I became more distant after our daughter was born, which is true, looking after a baby/toddler was and is a bit overwhelming. But the way he describes it is almost like the last 3.5 years have been devoid of affection which is sooo not true. It's not the infatuated puppy love for sure but I think some of the most romantic times have happened in the last 3.5 years, at least in my view."
infj,3diztm,MemoriesOfSelf,3,Thu Jul 16 19:05:10 2015 UTC,"When I was 18-20 I had a relationship with an INFJ that exploded pretty badly. 10 years later I spoke with her and we discussed the relationship.  I was shocked to hear that she didn't feel loved. I loved her more than anything in the world.  This worries me. I did learn to become a lot more affectionate though, when I was with an ESFJ. I eventually started to love the Fe, and learned to let it take the wheel in myself in a positive way, instead of always pushing back against it. So maybe that's what it takes?  For years I tried to understand Fe, but I went through my Ti. I understood how Fe is different and makes someone value different things.  But I discovered that there's a difference between understanding that Fe is different, and being able to look through the lens of Fe and feel the sense of reward from Fe activities.  Sorry for the half baked thoughts, but I'm just curious if I'm onto something here, and if that's what it takes.  Anyways, for me this was with an ESFJ, which basically meant that I sometimes acted as her sidekick in hosting activities, and really got a sense enjoyment out of bringing people together and making sure everyone is happy and felt included.  I'm not sure what kind of role this translates into in a relationship with an INFJ.  It really does feel pretty good though. Kind of like a fetish to just let go with your Ti and feel the warmth and let Fe take over."
infj,3diztm,catch-24,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:57:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input. It scares me to think that maybe he thinks I don't love him because he really means the world to me. If he didn't I think I would have walked away by now. I'm gonna try this, just go with things and try to feel."
infj,3diztm,catch-24,3,Thu Jul 16 20:01:35 2015 UTC,"I doubt he thinks you don't love him, but perhaps not as much as you really do. I hope I didn't cause you feel like you're to blame, it could just as easily be all his own issues.  But yeah I was pretty shocked myself how my EX's perception of what I felt for her differed from what I really felt for her. So I guess we INTPs might have a harder time really showing how we feel than we realize. So perhaps looking into developing Fe further would be a good idea.  I think it should be possible to feel a sense of reward for the same type of things that feel rewarding to an INFJ. I think it would be cool if we could make an INFJ feel like they have a partner that is interested in the same goals. I'm not sure if the sense of reward is tied more strongly to judgement functions or dominant and inferior functions though.  I also realized that another issue might be the difference in perception between an INTP and an INFJ about what constitutes a good relationship.  INTPs look at the level of comfort (more or less), but an INFJ has their eyes much more on change and improvement.  Level vs Slope.  So if you've been feeling very comfortable, chances are things might seem stagnant to an INFJ. This is an area where you'll need to learn to meet each other in the middle."
infj,3diztm,Lamzn6,4,Thu Jul 16 21:14:26 2015 UTC,"INFJ's are idealistic, and in some ways are the most difficult to satisfy in a relationship. He has an ideal in his mind of what his wife would be, and do. You don't meet that for some reason. You have a few choices - one: you somehow figure out his expectations and meet them, or two: he changes his expectations. The second scenario is FAR better. But it sounds like you might need some marriage counselling. Even though it isn't 'official' you live like married people do and you face issues you may need help to overcome. I wouldn't say this is a problem with INFJ's usually - we are happy with commitment, and are usually the ones committing first. This situation seems unusual for an INFJ, unless there are lots of trauama or past issues that he is concerned about. I think it is very strange for an INFJ to live like they are married for so long but refuse to officially commit. Usually, official commitment means very little, and personal commitment means everything (the fact that he has chosen to move in with you)."
infj,3diztm,CrateredMoon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:22:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your advice. I think I'm going to try to meet his expectations at least as best as I can and see if that changes anything.  I know from his past relationships that he may be hesitant to commit because his last relationship, (highschool through university, 5 years) fell through. I thought maybe he was just being cautious and seeing if we'd make it past that 5 year mark but apparently not."
infj,3diztm,seaglass0025,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:39:40 2015 UTC,"There might still be some other hidden traumatic episode pertaining to marriage, or just a strong conviction in regard to it for his own Ni reasons. I think what he needs to know is that he hurts your feelings by ""stalling"" marriage without opening up about his reasoning. He might be leaving hints as to why, but this subject is better discussed openly as not everyone is a mind reader.  edit: One more thing and purely a guess (as everything above else, too), he might believe that marriage comes with _____ and afraid of changes in your relationship after it. Thinking about that _____ for a long time made the glass very heavy :) Some counseling or treading carefully required to resolve."
infj,3diztm,Skryym,3,Thu Jul 16 20:41:53 2015 UTC,"I disagree with some of the others who say INFJs don't have commitment issues. They personally might not, but some of us do. I'm actually struggling with that very issue right now. My boyfriend isn't perfect, but he's pretty good, so I'm torn up about trying to take my chances at finding the perfect match or settling for good enough."
infj,3diztm,hintofsass,6,Thu Jul 16 19:24:16 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I think an INFJ's ""good enough"" is many people's idea of perfect. It can be very depressing to be on the other side of this and wondering why you just don't measure up. Not that this is the case with you but just a thought."
infj,3diztm,_Ajna_,3,Thu Jul 16 19:40:34 2015 UTC,"That's totally fair. And I misspoke...I didn't mean he was just barely good enough as a person, I meant that he's just barely good enough as a match for me. I told him once after I was too hard on him that I know he's an awesome person but I'm not able to fully appreciate his talents because they're so different from mine."
infj,3diztm,Skeletress,3,Thu Jul 16 22:08:54 2015 UTC,"INFJs are very committed to the right person.   And paradoxically very uncommitted to others.   Sorry to be so cut and dry but based off my experience with myself, I would leave him before he crushes you."
infj,3diztm,SteveLIESman,2,Fri Jul 17 01:38:38 2015 UTC,"Huge weddings are a waste of money. Commitment is looking to the future. I never understood why people felt like the best first step in starting a life together is to blow a shitload of money. I get it, kind of, but between a poor relationship with some family members, felling self conscious being the center of attention, and not really making much money, I'd rather go the courthouse... Stressing out over how to afford take the car to the shop for one night of champaign and pretty dresses? No thanks.... I guess it's nice to have something romantic to look back on, but people usually forget that shit anyway when they start arguing about money and how they never go out anymore."
infj,3diztm,jeff233,2,Thu Jul 16 21:11:46 2015 UTC,"Are you sure he is INFJ? I find his actions kind of contradictory if he is because honestly I find that INFJs (and definitely me) idealize the ultimate relationship and see marriage as such. If I have a child with someone and am monogamous with my child's dad for a long time it means that I am fully invested and WOULD want to be married/engaged.   If your husband is indeed INFJ, he may be hiding some feelings and thoughts and trying to protect you from being hurt by them. In terms of affection many INFJs really do thrive on affirmation and little gestures of caring behavior. Ask him whether this is all he needs or if there is something more because you really do want to get married and make him happy. Something is telling me if he is stalling, there is something fundamental that he is feeling uncertain about. In order to make a change in your relationship, you need to figure out what that is and be honest with each other. Good luck!"
infj,3diztm,jeff233,2,Thu Jul 16 23:13:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not at all experienced, but I'm going to give my account for the sake of putting it out there.  I've only had one relationship. She initiated. I was very slow to open up at all. There was a very deep initial connection with mutual interests (literature, philosophy, ecology) and mutual understanding (both INFJ). However, I didn't let myself be vulnerable.   My initial fears were that she was overtly committed to me, and that she wasn't the perfect ""one"" we are all looking for. Eventually I came to the understanding that she was more than good enough for me, and it didn't matter that neither of us were perfect, because we had the commitment to each other to steamroll through any problem.   So I made the decision then and there that I would be committed. Infatuation could die away, but the love would stay (because I believe that love is a choice, and I was willing to suffer for her and both of us as a couple).   The relationship sadly came to a bittersweet end. I still consider myself committed. I will help her if she ever needs help, and will be there if she ever needs a friend. There's been a lot of pain, but I'm not going to let bad feelings boil. Commitment. But I don't think it's necessarily an INFJ trait."
infj,3diztm,antonybdavies,2,Thu Jul 16 23:18:21 2015 UTC,"Personally I have horrid fears of commitment but once I am committed, I'm in it for the long haul (as long as it's reasonable and loving-not abusive). I believe it's due to my fierce independent streak."
infj,3diztm,sevenatewho,2,Fri Jul 17 00:44:30 2015 UTC,"I do have a difficult time committing. It's not because I'm not loyal, faithful, or satisfied in relationships. I think I make a great partner with the correct guy. All of my ex-boyfriends have told me I was 'more than just a girlfriend to them.' The part where I run into trouble is that I need someone very complex to keep me interested. I don't wade in the shallow end of the pool. I love to analyze and examine situations and people. My partner has to be slightly ahead of me in that regard, or at least able to keep up with it. Coming home to the same man everyday, in the same house, eating the same food, talking about similar things...that is my version of hell...a vacuum of stimulation or novelty. I also know based on my gut feelings very early on whether a man will be truly loved by me, or just strongly liked. I often break it off after a few good months because things plateau. It leaves my dates confused and probably frustrated or sad, but I don't want to ever settle."

When meeting new people I give them the benefit of the doubt that they'll somehow be interesting or can teach me something, and usually they'll pick up on that and respond well. Even if it's a forced situation, I try to find a genuine angle where we can relate. If I can't find it, I'll at least be very helpful, polite, and friendly which most people can't complain about too much.      The only time I really dislike socializing and it makes me internally cranky and tired is if I'm talking to someone and they just give nothing back. I mean no emoting, only short, factual answers, no follow up questions, only express opinions that shut down discussion and aren't open to debate, no apparent interest in the conversation, or they put in no effort to direct it somewhere better.  If you turn this into work for me, I'm not going to want to hang around you.  I'd rather sit by myself in silence than try to build a connection with an unwilling or uncooperative partner.        It helped a lot that in my 20s I was in an industry where our clients would sit directly behind us in the studio and watch us work all day, so besides thinking on the fly and having to get your work done, you had to be the entertainment as well. It was a real learning situation in terms of how to keep your shit together while you simultaneously tried to both innovate and problem-solve while coming across like you're the most competent person in the world all while telling jokes and remembering that their kids are really into horse back riding and I should ask about how that went last weekend.  By the time the day was over my co-workers would go out for drinks and I'd be like, screw that, I've more than filled my talking quota for today. But thanks to that I can pretty much talk to anyone about anything, even people who are ""higher rank"" than I am."

infj,3diqyp,wea8675309,3,Fri Jul 17 06:04:52 2015 UTC,"Motion graphics/FX artist. I mainly worked for broadcast television, and the majority of our clients were large advertising agencies representing a variety of high profile brands.  Back in the early 2000s when I started, they would still come into our studio and supervise every aspect of the production. It was a holdover from the 70s-90s when post-production houses would be these lavish places where agencies were catered to in every regard, so they'd come hang out with us for hours, eat food, and give their opinions on everything. To show how excessive it was, we found a glass table in storage one day and asked an older employee why we didn't use it anymore, and they said, ""oh, that was the ""cocaine"" table that would be in the back of the room in the 90s, almost every agency budget at the time had some room for buying drugs"". My face: 0_0 .  Anyway, that whole system was on its last legs by the time I started in the industry, and within the decade it was pretty much gone. Everything was done online and the client might come in for lunch every once and awhile, but otherwise you could work on your own.   As much as it could be nerve wracking and not conducive to how I like to work, it was an incredible learning experience and taught me a lot."

Also I tend to mirror people to some extent, so with very sociable people I'm a little more talkative, and with very awkward people I'm pretty awkward too."

At (preferably small) social gatherings, I can be really bubbly and engaging. But I'll tire out really quickly and start wondering when/how I can slip out. Going out is also really draining for me in and of itself. If I have plans, I'm usually ""saving my energy"" for them and don't like to do a lot of stuff during the day. Afterwards, I crash.  It annoys me when I describe myself as an introvert and people assume it means I'm automatically socially awkward. I remember I went out with someone and half way through coffee he's like ""I don't know what you're talking about. You seem pretty normal."" I probably can be socially awkward though, idk. I'm definitely not the epitome of social grace or anything.  I think where my social skills need more work is maintaining my relationships. I'm kind of flaky with plans. I'll think about my friends and what's going on in their lives but wont pick up the phone to find out how their first day of work went, for example.

infj,3dhkdq,spchamb,12,Thu Jul 16 09:30:53 2015 UTC,"I have three kids, but before the first, I didn't really want to become a father at all. The prospect was frightening because you realize how much influence you have over these little human beings. It's impossible to parent without fucking a kid up in some way or another, no matter how much effort you put into the thing, so that was daunting. It was my wife that really pushed us in that direction, so I reluctantly agreed. One of the first things I said to our oldest, as a newborn, was ""I am so sorry"". I felt it best to go ahead and get the apologies out of the way early.   The hospital and delivery room had me on automatic pilot. I felt more like a detached observer than a participant. We had worked out a basic plan for getting to the hospital, all three were c-sections, and I knew what needed to be done. There were plenty of monitors and numbers to look at and the staff pretty much takes care of everything. All I had to do was watch and tell my wife that everything was fine.   When the babies were born, I remember feeling absolutely zero attachment to them. They were little strangers. I took pictures and made sure our bracelets matched. I would hold the baby, rock the baby, and feed the baby, but actually felt very little during the whole hospital stay. My wife on the other hand was attached immediately, and she did seem overwhelmed.   It was over a period of months that I really began to feel things towards the new babies. I'd say it was about a 6 month process where I went from feeling nothing to feeling as though these kids were a part of me, and that I wouldn't be able to live without them. Over the years my attachment, devotion, and love for these kids has only gotten stronger. I have to constantly remind myself that ""they"" are not ""me"", and that they have their own personalities and wants."

I worked at camps and babysat some throughout highschool but it wasn't anything I was obsessed about. I usually clicked with a few kids I worked with here and there, if they were especially awesome but that's it. (usually it was the nerdy quirky kids who I clicked with, the ones who I could talk to like a person or an adult). When I was pregnant, I was looking forward to 'meeting' my child, but I wasn't sentimental about it at all. I didn't keep a pregnancy diary and frankly did a pretty bad job of updating a baby book for them. I'm just not sentimental like that. I didn't cry upon holding them for the first time, but I totally loved them right from the start. I loved the role I had of teaching them about the world, helping them to become awesome people who love others, and giving them some roots on this planet and a safe place to land.  I always had a deep connection with my kids, our connection is very important to me. I never really had to discipline my kids, never had to yell, we just talk about why certain behaviors are important. We have rules - my kids follow them. But they know we are all on the same team - I'm not making stuff up to hurt them or hinder them.   Now that they are older we do a lot of cool things together and talk about life, the universe everything all the time. I have enjoyed being a mom more and more every year. I should point out that I stayed home from work to care for them until last year (when the youngest was in second grade).  I never ever regret having kids. It's a huge blessing, I love who they are becoming. I think the greatest joy is to constantly learn more about who they are, and to support them in growing and learning. They are unique, awesome little people and I genuinely LOVE being with them. Our little family of four has a lot of fun!"

infj,3df0j3,Intempestivity,2,Thu Jul 16 05:37:28 2015 UTC,"I understand that's the prevailing theory, but some of my friends I've known since preschool. I doubt there has been much research at ages that young."

infj,3df0j3,KStreetFighter2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:36:39 2015 UTC,"Well, having thought about it a bit more in the last few minutes, there have been long term studies done on introversion and extroversion that suggest that these particular tendencies are hard wired at birth.  Introvert babies will scream and kick and fist pump quite a lot, because they're easily overstimulated and have no way to let out all that ""this is too much!"" jitteriness, whereas extrovert babies will be calm and quiet when introduced to loud noises and and new faces.  So one could theorise that, as children, we are automatically attracted towards those like us.  Extrovert children probably find introvert children boring (why play in the sand box when you could be on top of the jungle gym), and introvert children probably find that they enjoy the same activities as other introvert children because it creates the same level of satisfactory stimulation in their brains.  I can't comment on the intuition and feeling, but I think with introversion vs extroversion, like attracts like, especially when we're children."

My ex was also an INFJ, like me and for years we loved the hell out of one another, but we were never able to coexist or be around one another for too long. Needless to say, I'll never date another INFJ, I tend to get along great with ES types and gravitate people unlike me."

We butt heads from time to time but we really like having the difference in perspective that the other person provides for us, so it's pretty nice.   One of my best friends is also ISTP. Sort of the same deal- we squabble semi-frequently but we like each other a lot so we spend a lot of time hashing out opinions and finding a middle ground. It can be mutually frustrating but he's a real smart guy so it's worth it!  I'm fairly sure one of my former best friends was an EN, by the way he was sort of overbearing but meant well. We had a lot of good conversations when we lived together but since we parted ways it's been sort of distant. We have that sort of instant ""oh shit how has it been that long!"" sort of vibe, but still. I dunno how I'd put it in words. Sometimes I want to call him and then sometimes I'm glad we don't talk that much, if that makes sense."

They're the quiet people on Teamspeak and in guild chat who I know have bubbling inner worlds but we're probably not going to private message each other cause that's now how we roll, man.

I was recently hanging out with some good friends and we all typed ourselves, and found most of us to be IN or EN types. Not a single S to be found. So it seems that my preference is for N types because of I genuinely enjoy their company.  That said, and maybe this is because I'm in college and people's schedules are irregular, I tend to be going in and out of different friend circles all the time. For groups I go adventuring/do physical activities with, there's a good representation of ES types too. In my extracurricular activities (a lot of e-board, religious, etc. types), there tends to be a good spread of different types as well. So all in all, there's a good diversity but there's particular concentrations of types based on what I'm doing at the moment.   The only ones who seem to fly under my radar are the IS types, and I'm assuming that's because I'm not too into what interests them."

The ESFP went to great lengths to get to know me, and really tries to listen when I talk. We don't have much in common but he is a really nice, energetic guy and I should be grateful that he even acknowledged my existence.   Other than that... all N's. there is an ENTJ who is really domineering in groups, but is somewhat thoughtful and deep one on one. There is another I can't type, but he's tested as INFP and ENFJ. He and I understand each other on a great level, and have shared many experiences that make us great friends. And then an ENTP who has an insatiable desire to talk about literally anything. My ex and only girlfriend is an INFJ and there was a real unspoken connection, no need for me to wear a mask... I felt completely comfortable around her. But that sadly ended."

I think it's easier to gravitate towards IN types because we both understand and respect the need for space and recharging, and we can have deep discussions which helps us to feel connected.  There's no need for small talk.  That being said, I have several acquaintences who are ISTP/J types, and a couple more who are ENTJ/P.  My sister is an ESFP, as is my mom.  I love how they both just have this energy that commands the attention of the room, and they can make anyone laugh within five minutes of knowing them, and they do bring a lot of fun in to my life.

I'm a disorganized INFJ and I think I gravitate toward my xNTJ friends because they help me in that regard ;) I also like NTs because I relate to them easily on an intellectual level (esp. INTP) but they offer a different perspective than NF friends/me and challenge my POV and opinions. I have very few S type friends, though there are a few ISFJs I hold close. They are all kind, fun, outgoing (but introverted), and extremely caring, but there is a lack of depth or curiosity at times. My ISFJ friends are all super smart, don't be mistaken, but they have distinct interests and don't question or seem too curious about issues/topics outside of those realms."

My sister and I are EERILY similar, except for the fact that she's a brick of a thinker and doesn't give a shit about what people feel/think. I have a few EN friends and they're very overwhelming, but I've learned to appreciate them for who they are and embrace their zeal with them.  I just so happen to live with three INFJ dudes, though, but they are all so different (looks, interests, etc.) that I still have a hard time understanding how we all have the same personality type.

In all honesty, I don't think I'm friends with a lot of introverts because I find them boring. I like the extroverted energy.

infj,3dgeg9,shinbum,4,Thu Jul 16 01:46:42 2015 UTC,"Hi there, I can kind of relate. I've had similar experiences.  If I may though, the mind is a very powerful thing. Its very possible that in your desire to empathize, your mind gives you its interpretation of the pain it hears described. If you've never heard of sympathetic pain, this is it.   There used to be a type of sitcom trope where the pregnant character's husband would have swollen ankles, cravings for weird food, be overly caring and motherly. It was called sympathetic pregnancy. Very funny for a 10 year old me.   If you're wondering, no you aren't crazy, you want to empathize and connect with the person whose pain you're feeling, and you're doing so strongly."
infj,3dgeg9,KeepNappingElite,2,Thu Jul 16 02:04:36 2015 UTC,"I was going to mention sympathetic pain and sympathetic pregnancy.  They're real phenomena that affect people who have strong empathy.  Happy cake day, by the way!"

infj,3dgeg9,GhostVon,3,Thu Jul 16 04:45:27 2015 UTC,I can't relate personally but I have heard a few stories of INFJs picking up other people's physical pain.
infj,3dgeg9,6the6bull6,3,Thu Jul 16 01:58:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  It's gotten better over the years but it used to be terrible.  More emotional pain than physical pain, but it could be either.  I hate class rooms because of this.  I know it sounds crazy, but I'd just internalize that environment and wouldn't know what my own feelings were.    I went to the college counselor in order to get permission not to go to class.  The conversation led to me describing the state of mind his previous patient had been in.  I described all this from experience as I was having severe headaches and grief, which the previous client had somehow left in the room, and I was then arbitrarily feeling.    Yeah, no one will really care if you share this with them.  And it really doesn't matter tbh.  It has caused me a lot of confusion and strife.  I feel like I'm finally finding my own feelings at age 30.  One thing that's sort of interesting is energy work.  I'm not this sensitize anymore, but I used to be able to take someone's feelings into myself and work on them and feel the results in my own body.  Some really weird stories from that period.  In the end though, I think it's something best to ignore and is probably a symptom of having no boundries.  You don't sound as severe as I was, and the level you experience it as being extremely intermittent is promising, but I believe you if that helps.  You're not alone or a freak, just have this extra little quirk to you."
infj,3dgeg9,Basileas,2,Thu Jul 16 04:11:48 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm... That's quite an interesting story. I think I remember reading an article somewhere about experiencing intense physical pain that is really psychological.   My grandmother used to talk about having similar experiences, though not as traumatic. When people told her stories of injuries, she would feel pangs of pain in that part of the body. She also had a couple months of chest pain when My grandpa broke a rib.  I have a somewhat similar experience. I get a cringy feel when people talk about physical pain (which I believe is ordinary) and I mostly feel a dull ache when people talk about psychological pain, which I also think is ordinary. With really bad stuff I completely shut down and get cold, and am unable to help people or function, which is one reason I sometimes doubt if I'm an INFJ."

That makes me happy,  just to see people helping and having a good time. The reason I check it every day is there is a slim chance someone might want to talk to me. I'm starting to recognize that it's pretty unhealthy to continually wait just to see if someone might check in on me. It's degrading. What's worse is that sometimes I catch myself scrolling down the wall, absorbed in the petty drama of my old high school classmates.

The reason that I have three accounts is because I have two friends who insist that I view things on facebook every now and then, so I use a friend specific account for nothing more than viewing their content.  The last account: I made for my wife so that she could assist herself in some games, I believe.  I really dislike the company that runs Facebook, their privacy policy is horrendous, in addition to all of the third party tracking and data sharing.  I just don't want to be a part of that — though I don't chastise others for it.  Other than that?  I tend to stick to email and instant messaging clients.  Every now and then, I'll feel brave and post something to a forum ( Hello! ), but that's about it.  To be honest though, even if facebook, et al. did have good privacy policies, I probably wouldn't use it simply because I'm already busy enough as it is.  Full time job, wife, kids, and three good friends.  That's about all I can handle without getting burned out."

I remember when they suddenly changed timelines so it was no longer the newest first. I hear there is a follow and unfollow option now but it's just not worth it when people are a text, phone call or an email away and it feels more personal and intimate that way. It means sacrificing larger social events that are easier to organize on FB but I never really cared for those anyway, I'm not networking or advertising regardless.

Over time the 'people who post their own actually individual thoughts' crowd got smaller and smaller and I kinda lost interest.  Back in the day I had facebook for a couple of years, and then one day I deleted it and it was six months before anybody noticed or mentioned it to me, so...it's just not really necessary that I have facebook.  The reason I got rid of both was because any kinda social networking just makes me miss people too much, I just don't really wanna see like, photos of people having a nice time and such, go away.

infj,3devnl,HAPPY_LIL_VEGEMITE,2,Thu Jul 16 16:23:36 2015 UTC,I think it's just that INFJs are free thinkers and being a rare type we like to question why something is popular like Facebook or Twitter.Just because they're popular doesn't mean they are any good or have value.I think Redditt is a much more democratic site and isn't so narcissistic as those other ones.

I find it very useful to keep up to date with friends when I'm in that ""I really don't have the energy for conversation"" state of mind (which happens very regularly). A quick ""like"" on a post let's them know that ""Hey, I'm still here. I'm not hating on you, I just don't have the energy to hold a conversation right now"".  I rarely post anything to my own Facebook account though.. I'm more a fan of Instagram for that, which I also frequent on the daily."
infj,3deuvf,fading93,6,Wed Jul 15 18:48:59 2015 UTC,"Writing has been one of the best things for my emotional health. I ""absorb"" the emotions around me too and I also have a history of trauma so my emotional life can be very confusing and I won't know why I'm feeling what I'm feeling at all. I've found that through journaling and specifically writing poetry about my feelings I get in touch with what I'm really feeling at my core.   Writing poetry had been really powerful because metaphor expresses the complexity I have in my head where my current emotions are mixing with my past trauma emotions and all the emotions I am picking up from my environment. Once I write and figure out what I'm feeling I am able to recognize what isn't mine and let that stuff go or protect myself from what is in the environment. I think it's really important to be anchored in your own truth and not get lost in the confusion. Also make sure your getting enough alone time and down time to take care of yourself, it's so important that we maintain these sensitive minds of ours so that we don't get burned out!"
infj,3deuvf,Moon-pearl,4,Thu Jul 16 01:26:36 2015 UTC,"Usually some form of reflection.  If, for example, I start off the day feeling awesome, and then by the middle of the day I feel grumpy or negative, I'll stop myself and reflect on when I began feeling that way and look for connecting environmental factors.  If I had a lot of work pushed on me at the last minute, yeah, that grumpiness is totally mine.  If, however, everything was running along tickety-boo, then it's probably not mine, and at that point I start considering the actions of others around me.  Has someone been particularly withdrawn or confrontational or gossipy?  I can then narrow it down to an external source, and at that point I make a consicous decision to wall it off, and I do visualise building a wall around myself while visualising the negative energy leaving me as black smoke.  Within an hour of identifying the cause and consciously letting go and walling off, I'm back to normal.  If someone else's mood shifts instantly, I pick up instantly that it's not mine.  I make a point to be calm.  My tone is soft, I reassure the other person and I control my breathing.  This isn't a fully conscious reaction, though my words are carefully chosen.  My tone of voice and breathing automatically switch to be as reassuring and calming as possible.  If things have been slowly building and I'm suddenly feeling overwhelmed, I need to take some time to work through it.  I do this in a few different ways.  I medidate to reconnect with myself and visualise letting those other emotions go much as I do in the first scenario.  I write or draw to get my feelings out and organise my thoughts.  I review how things in my life have been lately--have I had a lot of extra activity that has drained me, or a lot of conflict with others?  Have I been neglecting my emotional needs to satisfy physical needs, and vice versa?  How have I become so unbalanced?  I then come up with a plan to bring balance back in to my life, and that helps me identify and own which of the things I'm feeling are mine (what factors in my life need to be adjusted that are causing specific reactions within me), and which aren't mine (if I'm feeling angry and I have no genuine cause to be, that's not mine).  I can then let go of those which don't belong to me and work on resolving the ones that do."
infj,3deuvf,Intempestivity,2,Thu Jul 16 07:50:36 2015 UTC,"I have an intense hatred for Fe just for this reason alone. It comes to a point where my feelings are no longer my own, almost like involuntary mind-reading. Instead of hearing other people's unwelcomed thoughts, you feel their unwelcomed feelings and you can't make it stop. Though I've learned to address and adapt. There's also another side to this, which is making someone else feel what you feel.  Change the way you view his stress. Right now you view it negatively in how it affects you. His stress is not about you. Try to maintain a sense of calmness when you're around him. He might pick up on it and feel at least a bit relieved when he is with you. You can't solve his stress, but you can lessen it.  By letting his stress affect you, you're cultivating a stressful environment for him. So my suggestion is to be a little bit stronger, put the negativity aside to create and retain positive energy. That starts with being able to handle your emotions, which you seem to already know how to do."

Or while in deep thought if you get distracted you loose your train of thought, possibly forever. Do you often find yourself think about what could be or future situations?

infj,3dexgn,6the6bull6,2,Thu Jul 16 00:06:11 2015 UTC,"The biggest difference between N's and S's that I've noticed is that S's are easily amused and impressed by information. Information that seems obvious and trivial to N's. For example, my one close S friend sent me an article recently. The article stated that in a recent interview, a manager said that he prefers to hire people with both breadth and depth of knowledge.  ...  That was the sole point of the article. The N in me wanted to scream ""No shit!!"" Because OF COURSE they want breadth and depth. What, did you think they wanted people who only know one topic well? Did you think they wanted people who were a jack of all trade but aren't actually good at anything?  I used to be really offended by S's, before I knew anything about MBTI. Because I thought that everyone thought like me, and that if they were giving me obvious advice like that, it must mean that they think I'm a complete idiot. But no. They don't think that at all. It's just that causality and correlation don't come naturally to S's. So they pass it on because to them it doesn't actually seem obvious.  So think about this. When someone hands you a fact/statistic and assigns a meaning to it (for example, Americans who eat fish regularly tend to live longer), do you get excited about that new information and store it away so that you can repeat it in a relevant context later? Or do you play with the statistic, reverse the causality, explore it, and play the devil's advocate? As an N, my first thought on hearing that statistic is, ""Fish costs a bit more. People who eat fish regularly probably tend to be wealthier. Wealthier people can afford more medical care and healthier lifestyles. They also tend to be better educated. All of those factors could contribute to living longer, so the fish may have nothing to do with it."" And all of that is wildly unrelated to my convictions. I believe fish is healthy, and my gut tells me that regularly eating it could actually increase your lifespan slightly by avoiding other health problems. But that didn't keep me from completely dissecting the logical premise of the statement.  I've discussed the positive aspect of N's here and not the positive aspect of S's, but that's because I honestly don't know that much about how S's work. I only know how they interact with me. However, from what I've read, they're great at the here-and-now, for which I envy them. Sometimes climbing out of my mindbox and interacting with the current physical world feels impossible."

infj,3dexgn,SwaggerFart,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:57:42 2015 UTC,"INFJ male here. Dominant introverted intuition is funnily enough the dominant function of an INFJ types mind. I experience introverted intuition initially as an ephemeral inner insight, not ephemeral as in uncertainty, rather ephemeral as in whispy and unformed though an insight that feels very true and real if not proven by empirical evidence (yet). I live in my mind scanning for new insights and when I sense the birth of one I track it's growth. I believe that intuition is merely the function of scanning for and tracking the birth of new thoughts.  S on the other hand is completely unrelated to N (well not completely). S is the scanning and tracking of the world through the senses only, or in the case on Si its the inner perception the mind has from using its sense organs. What we see and hear and touch taste smell. N is thought related, S is the minds perception of physical nature through the senses. Both N and Se though are perception and that is why S is on the same side as N, both are perceiving functions."

This just means that sometimes you come to conclusions based on concrete things you see, and sometimes your brain gives you an answer without bothering to tell you how you reached that conclusion."

I cannot even tell you how many times I've absentmindedly scanned my badge, waited too long to push the door open (and not noticed the security light change from red to green to red again), and then walked full-force into the door. The worst is, I usually use my foot to push the doors open, and my body just follows through. BUT, when a door is locked, you end up kicking a stationary door.

infj,3dbsqn,48valentine,8,Wed Jul 15 03:32:36 2015 UTC,"This is sort of an inside joke in MBTI.  Basically we have different parts of mind called ""cognitive functions"" that help us get by everyday life. There are 8 of them but different people prioritise them in different order according to their preference, some functions are more dominant and some are more inferior depending on individuals.  Each MBTI type has its own unique arrangement of the 8 functions. In the case of INFJ, its 4th function (the inferior one) is extroverted sensing, known as ""Se"".  Se is responsible for picking up sensory stimuli in the outside world, meaning colours, sound, smell, taste, etc. A weak Se will result in detachment from the objective world, causing the person to be extremely unaware of their surrounding. The comic is meant to make fun of that because it happens often to INXJs."

Years later I've noticed its manifested in an anxiety/complex and am trying to relearn how to express those thoughts in a safe healthy way. This thread has helped a lot with that. I started a Livejournal that I only allow one of my best friends (an INFP) to see and comment on it. She also posts and I can comment on hers, so it provides a safe venue to ""exist"" and express our emotions without judgment, good or bad.

infj,3dcgfb,side_twinge,3,Wed Jul 15 14:27:42 2015 UTC,"I consider myself to have an addictive personality.   Introducing a chemical into my body or mindlessly surfing reddit is enough to forget what I have bottled up for just a little bit, but the craving for a quick escape from the fucked up reality that is my mind returns almost immediately.   This was my exact experience for years. I drunk heavily during my studies, and smoked weed daily for a time before spiralling into a deep depression... I got out of it by throwing myself in the world of physical culture, which I now see as Se-compensation. After a few years of shutting myself down through work and weightlifting competitions (with barely of hint of a personal life), those feelings came back with a vengeance, only this time I finally stumbled upon a way of directly addressing them: through meditation.  Meditation taught me that my addictions were merely an attempt to ""self-medicate"", to suppress and escape from a deep dissatisfaction I felt at the contemplation of my life path, which I had let other people define for me. I'm now changing my life, coming back to school while moving to part-time work, and it feels like the right thing :) Of course, my addictions aren't a problem anymore, but that's almost a sidenote at this point.  So here's my measly advice in a nutshell. Your addictions are caused by feelings that you are trying to suppress. Find a practice to learn how to face these feelings, be that meditation or talk therapy, fully experience them and act accordingly. No one can know for sure what it is you have to do, but you'll find out.  Godspeed!"

It's worth learning to enjoy your own company. No one but you can give your life meaning. You need to find it for yourself.  But also, more importantly, it sounds like you're taking your friends and family for granted. It might not seem like much but they're offering you the level of understanding and acceptance that they're capable of. If anything, moving taught me to appreciate that seemingly basic level of care. Strangers will feel no obligation to care about you the way they do, you will never feel more alone than in the initial period after a move.  More pragmatically, whether it means staying where you are or moving, open yourself up to the world. Try new group activities, talk to people even if you think you have nothing in common. Lucky for you, the introvert's knack for isolating and having a one on one conversation at a party means a higher chance for deep connections, which is made easier with INFJ empathy and intuition."

Most people, a vast majority, even those closest to us, never ever think about us, and they don't care what's going on in our heads or in our lives...at least not very much. People like to be around others who make them feel good and whose company they enjoy. They don't enjoy analyzing every detail of their lives or exploring every idea down to its root principle or universal application. Most people are too wrapped up in themselves to even pause or consider that another mind is sitting across from them. Others who may seem caring and concerned on the surface, are actually very insecure and feel compelled to sacrifice their own wants and desires to satisfy everyone else. That's not compassion, it's a compulsive complex.   Think of relationships like food. Most meals of the day you try to eat healthy, and then on certain occasions, you get a desert. That's what it's like with other people. You spend most of your time simply living in the moment with these folks, engaging in small talk (yuck, but necessary), expressing gratitude, handing out sincere compliments (they may be rare but they're real), engaging in play, companionship, sharing space, swapping favors, etc., but while doing all of this you'll occasionally find a moment when they are open to introspection. Something will rock their worldview, they'll feel suddenly sad or confused, and then they'll open up. Then for this brief window of time you get to indulge on this really good mind to mind, heart to heart, soul expanding meaty conversation, and it will be great, and you will want more, but the time will pass and you have to dial it back. Most people are really uncomfortable with that stuff, it makes them feel vulnerable and small.  So you accept that most people are not into it, and if you're not a dick about it, then you'll get some quality time every once in awhile. That's the best we're going to get. Because even if you find someone who is a mirror of yourself, and you spend all your time delving and exploring, gushing and indulging, then you may not like what you see. A person like that will be honest with you, and sometimes that shit is difficult to deal with. So be happy with what you've got, because that's all you've got. There's no sense bemoaning fact."

infj,3davus,Nalak,2,Tue Jul 14 23:26:24 2015 UTC,"I do see a correlation between my upbringing and my sensitivity. I felt responsible for my mother from an early age. It was not a healthy relationship. I did go no contact with her about 2 years ago...which lead me to seek therapy after trying to do it on my own. Boundaries are important to me and if another person does not understand or respect them, there lies my issue of wanting to door-slam them but also needing to have patience and be kind. *edit:words"

infj,3davus,nowhearin,2,Wed Jul 15 00:09:48 2015 UTC,I was a fan of that sub too! I had to unsubscribe because reading the posts everyday got my anxiety going because I could relate so much with just about every story. Conflict freaks me out so much! Is it because there are only 2 extremes with us...raging out or shutting up and holding it in? There is no comfortable middle ground. I would pay good money to eloquently and calming state my conflicting opinion.

infj,3dcd7y,shinbum,5,Wed Jul 15 08:33:16 2015 UTC,"Don't date or not date based on type. If you get along and have similar values, go for it. A majority of the marriages I've seen work out in my life aren't the ""ideal"" mbti match. Just use MBTI as a tool to understand the other person and be aware of each other's strengths/weakness so you can grow together.   In terms of what to look out for:  In my experience, with other INFJs the communication is great. There isn't a lot of ""uhh wtf, what do you mean?"" but a lot of ""omg yes I totally get that"". A lot of similar interests and tastes, so finding a movie or show to watch is never too difficult. We like talking about similar things and both tend to value compassion and meaning over materialism or competition. Both are introverts, so they understand the need to be alone for a bit and not party every night. NFs usually get along great together because we value similar things  Idealist - Idealist Relationship and are very people oriented. Talk to him about MBTI, he'll almost certainly love it.  Somethings to be aware of:  With any pairing, there will be stuff to watch out for. Often, when I tell INFJ friends my problems, we listen to each other and understand but can never really solve them since we tend to have the same problems. Since both types are feelers and like to avoid conflict, there may be some passive aggression in the relationship. But if you start out in the beginning by saying, ""just be honest and direct with me no matter what"" and encouraging that behavior throughout - it can be avoided. If an INFJ knows it's safe to express their feelings and be understood, they can be very blunt and direct.   Overall, it's a very intellectually stimulating and loving relationship to be in."

I only know one INFJ the one I work with.I am slightly scared of her tbh.It is probably only the second INFJ I've ever met.So perhaps my wariness comes from meeting another psychic unicorn and not trusting my intuition about her?

We are both INFJs and it just makes it way easier for us to connect and understand how the other person is feeling. We fell for each other pretty quickly and became serious just after a couple months of dating. He definitely makes me happier than any of the other personality types I've dated because he is willing to show his love for me and understand how I feel. The only downside is that he's a little more introverted than me and likes to stay in a lot while I'm more adventurous. The cool thing is that when we have disagreements on things like that we don't fight, we just discuss and agree to work on it.   Anyways, all ramblings aside, you'll never know until you try."
infj,3dbjlh,shinbum,11,Wed Jul 15 00:11:28 2015 UTC,I've never really looked at anyone as a role model. There are people who I admire but I've never really strived to be like anyone else no matter how great I think they are.
infj,3dbjlh,a_warm_place,2,Wed Jul 15 00:23:36 2015 UTC,"This is exactly my answer too. Would you like to elaborate, give me an example? I would like to further relate to you haha."
infj,3dbjlh,a_warm_place,2,Wed Jul 15 00:29:07 2015 UTC,Sure. I wasn't sure if anyone would feel the same way. /u/Paragonight really summed up how I feel. I just don't think it's healthy to compare yourself to other people. I'll just add one more point. When I was growing up I just never looked at other people and wanted to be like them. I just saw them as humans with good qualities and bad qualities. When my friends talk about their role models they act like they're amazing and can do no wrong. I've just never felt that way about anyone. I don't know if that makes any sense. I feel like I'm just overthinking it.
infj,3dbjlh,Paragonight,5,Wed Jul 15 20:00:02 2015 UTC,"I do think /u/a_warm_place gave the answer I feel in agreement with. I can draw inspiration from anywhere, not just people, but also just things I come across in my daily day. I don't think it's healthy to compare ourselves to others, nor should we strive to become them. I personally don't wish to be anyone else and never have, I'm perfectly happy with who I am, even if I am  perceived great or not so great by others. In today's world the media puts a lot of emphasis on how we should look, act, be and want certain things, this makes many people feel insecure if they do not have these things. Be it stuff about themselves, their job, relationship, etc., it creates this illusion of a sensation that we need things, which we actually don't. I'm sure many can recognize this, ""the grass is greener on the other side"" and all that, when in reality it often is just an illusion that we choose to believe in. There is inherently nothing wrong with wanting or to be things, but we should never let it get to a point where we start feeling discontent with what we are. That said, I do encourage everyone to let themselves be inspired and motivated by anything that moves them, as none of us should ever stop trying to become a better person."
infj,3dbjlh,Skryym,4,Wed Jul 15 07:48:20 2015 UTC,"Came here with a definite answer but then read the very thoughtful post by /u/a_warm_place  That being said, the only person I aspire to be is the better version of me, beckoning out from a place further and higher along the road of life. It's quite a fight just to stay on that road.  However, I certainly have an array of heroes. As an environmentalist, I have always looked up to Aldo Leapold... He wrote so beautifully and shared such a wonderful story with his family. He cared so deeply for nature, philosophy, and the simple pleasures of family and community... and literally died doing what he loved. I might aspire to be him, but I certainly hope to lead as fulfilling a life.  Others I look up to are John Muir, Saint Bernard of Menthon, Roy Chapman Andrews, John W Powell,and of course several community leaders."

I'm 25 myself, so I have a little bit of an idea of what you're talking about.   I think volunteering is a really good idea.

Remember there are different degress of each type,  some people are Heavily T or heavily F,  others can literally change depending on thier mood when they do the test. (i'm a T with 15% so if i had a strange day i could type into an F with 5% or so)  Although this will help you understand some things,  Don't change who you are and how you behave/react based on something you read as a generalization about INFJ's,  If you do that,  you lose what is truly unique about you."

infj,3d9ctn,erosenoir,2,Tue Jul 14 14:55:13 2015 UTC,"Loved that article when i read it a few days back, surprised to see it here! Why did you choose to share it here?   A complaint i had on this article was that it seemed to kind of reduce consciousness to just attention. Attention isn't really seen as one of the ""hard problems of consciousness"", such as ""experience"". Though I would agree that an attention scheme might be created sometime (I'm not sure how, it's a complex thing for sure), i would not see it as solving consciousness in ai.  By the way, what's this theory of his you're speaking of?"
infj,3d9ctn,HEmile,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:42:49 2015 UTC,"I shared this article because of some comments on the article on empathy from the NYT.  Graziano's theory of consciousness is based on attention.  What's missing from the article is the role of awareness.  We have awareness of the attentional states of others--basically, we can perceive and reconstruct the attentional states of others.  We can also perceive this awareness emanating from others, if you will.  You can sort of understand consciousness as the ability to turn attention and awareness on yourself, giving rise to the feeling of self-awareness.  In this feeling, we perceive our own rich, complex inner worlds and localize them as emanating from within ourselves.  The thing I love about it is that my image of myself, my image of other people, my image of the world, are all useful but inherently incomplete models that I store, access, and update in my mind.  The models are changeable and can be improved.  To me, this is freeing and comforting."
infj,3d9ctn,MemoriesOfSelf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:26:06 2015 UTC,"Breaking down the design process for AI is an all important step of raising awareness of what makes an intelligence and allows for fine-tuning of our own understanding, I think. It raises a few questions and a little bit of disagreement with, for instance, his model of awareness: are we aware of interaction between our hemispheres when we make a decision, watch a play in theater or put butter on bread?    Awareness is an ability to separate a mental construct from otherwise entangled mental field. Consciousness is a great mechanism that can assist with this by tying bodily reactions to external and internal stimuli, giving preference to those pertaining to the body: its needs, properties, etc. Attention, as the article points out, limits the observed mind field through a certain criteria based on the known (or newly created, based on immediate feedback) connections—awareness, in other words. The latter concludes the loop.   I think, the biggest problem in AI development is defining the most basic concepts upon which an intelligence is constructed: the corner stones of awareness, since ours is mostly limited to our senses, while an artificial one can be much more flexible and we really are unaware of the possibilities here.  edit: spelling"
infj,3d9ctn,MemoriesOfSelf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:08:08 2015 UTC,"So I think Graziano's definition of awareness would say that we are not aware of interaction between hemispheres in our brains.  Awareness comes from having a limited model of attentional states, and while we can localize our own self-awareness as something that emanates from inside ourselves, due to the limitations of the model, we cannot localize it beyond that.  Think of the color analogy he uses in the article.  It makes sense that the information about interactions between hemispheres is ""too much"" information to integrate into the picture.  We don't need it to function, and it would be a ""waste"" of computing power to do so."

infj,3d97zs,BananaJuice1,8,Wed Jul 15 11:13:30 2015 UTC,"Hey there, so I am just gunna put an idea out there. So, you might be an INFJ but personally, I don't think you are completely. Your understanding of the classification system is a bit simplified and may require more insight. Every INFJ is different but there are traits present that might point that you may be a demi (check your percentages of your test or take a longer test). If any of your functions are close to the middle divison, I suggest reading up on the others. The reason I think you may not be an INFJ is the main idea that you are putting yourself out in the public light (this is not a common trait in an INFJ), advertising yourself (Also not a common trait/almost a fear for many INFJs), use of words in your videos, fluency in your video, speech patterns, and black and white comprehension of the entire system. Again, I'm going off a lot of stereotypes and commonalities but the other is that INFJs tend to hide or shy away. This relates back to putting yourself out there on Youtube (which I admire!) but also your hair choice. This is another dissection that is probably off base and relies predominately on stereotypes but INFJs once again- do not like to draw attention to themselves and especially that they are different. Your hair (which is gorgeous 8- ) ), would typically draw more attention as it is an synthetic shade. Many people type as an INFJ when it is more of a projection of what they want to be (not that its a bad thing) rather than who they currently are and how they acted throughout their life. Those are the biggest reasons. Again, every INFJ is different. I don't mean to be a jackass. If you're going to put yourself in the public, you will get feedback. Finally, to recap, every INFJ is different but just some food for thought."
infj,3d97zs,Northerncrafts,3,Tue Jul 14 16:26:18 2015 UTC,"No offense to her, but my gut instinct suggests she is more Fe dominant probably an ENFJ? Edit: you remind me of my ENFJ sister in fact similar traits have you- Yoda."
infj,3d97zs,jeff233,3,Tue Jul 14 18:13:51 2015 UTC,Definitely not an offensive comment. ENFJs are awesome.
infj,3d97zs,Northerncrafts,3,Tue Jul 14 18:39:51 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree. I would also say that INFJ have a tendency to over  research things to the point of perfectionism before we present them. I felt like there was some slight errors in the description she gave which could be lack or understanding or poor planning, both of which are not characteristic of INFJ. This video is more of a verbal profile of an INFJ.   Although sometimes as a defence strategy an INFJ will have a prickly or offensive look about them. This is to try and avoid having people bring their problems to you looking for help."
infj,3d97zs,6the6bull6,2,Tue Jul 14 17:12:02 2015 UTC,I would also say that INFJ have a tendency to over research things to the point of perfectionism before we present them.   Ti does this. It needs the WHOLE lol
infj,3d97zs,Thunder_54,4,Tue Jul 14 21:54:39 2015 UTC,"but also your hair choice.    I've had the official test administered, and I'm definitely INFJ.  I have neon red and black hair.  I don't actually like attention, and I don't want attention for it.  I have it because it makes me happy, and I feel like myself with bright hair.  I've tried having normal hair before, and it just doesn't feel like me.  Even duller reds don't feel like me and make me miserable after a while.  It's an unfortunate stereotype in society that bright hair = attention seeking, but with everyone I know who has bright/different hair, it's because it's how they most feel like themselves--no one I know does it for attention.  Edit:  I know this is just one line in a couple of paragraphs, but it's something I've personally heard a lot, so it kind of touched a chord.  ""You're not an introvert, you have bright hair!""  ""You must like attention because of your hair.""  ""What do you mean you don't like other people touching your hair; it's bright, you must want people to touch it""--all things that have been said to me.  A person's hair colour--or clothing choices, or make up styles, or nail colour--have no more bearing on what type of a person they are than does their eye colour or their shoe size.  Second edit:  To offer a different perspective on some of your other points:   the main idea that you are putting yourself out in the public light (this is not a common trait in an INFJ), advertising yourself (Also not a common trait/almost a fear for many INFJs)   I know a lot of introverts use youtube and internet communication in general as a way of reaching out to others that is distanced enough to not feel overwhelming and is also easily walked away from when it does become too much.  Advertising ourselves does not come naturally, no, but is something that may be experimented with as one begins to stretch their inferior functions.  It's something I consciously work on in my career.   use of words in your videos, fluency in your video, speech patterns   She could have practiced what she wanted to say, or perhaps she has gone through this many times over with friends/family members (I sure did when I first learned about MBTI ... common trait in INFJs--when we're interested in something, we'll discuss it in depth many times over).  Most INFJ can't string together two sentences in the moment, but if it's a subject we've researched and something we're passionate about, you can't get us to shut up :).   and black and white comprehension of the entire system.    Maybe she's still learning the intracacies of MBTI?   Many people type as an INFJ when it is more of a projection of what they want to be (not that its a bad thing) rather than who they currently are and how they acted throughout their life.    This is true.  It may or may not be applicable, but it is something that should be acknowledged."
infj,3d97zs,Intempestivity,3,Tue Jul 14 19:50:58 2015 UTC,"You may be right, but she reminds me a hell of alot of my ENFJ sister.This may sound weird but when I watch actual INFJs on YouTube I just know.The problem often is people don't understand the functions properly so from personal experience may pick a type that sounds interesting or is rare.My mbti was done by my stepfather who has a Phd and was a scientist so I feel very secure in his abilities.Plus the test had a very in depth description and resonated very strongly with me.."
infj,3d97zs,jeff233,3,Tue Jul 14 22:49:55 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying it's impossible to judge a book by its cover, particularly in the preferences of introversion/extroversion.  INFJ, in particular, can come across as extroverts because we can be very outgoing and passionate when we want to be--couple that with our interest in people and the world at large, and we can appear as extrovert.  But if being around people drains you, then it drains you.  I'm not saying if the OP is or isn't INFJ.  I'm not trying to type her.  I was just offering an alternative view with how the points raised could apply to an INFJ."
infj,3d97zs,Intempestivity,2,Wed Jul 15 05:22:31 2015 UTC,I agree so much with this.
infj,3d97zs,Jupitars,4,Tue Jul 14 16:30:58 2015 UTC,"Introversion/extroversion occurs as a range/continuum/spectrum. Infj's often feel misunderstood as they are a small minority of the population, and making videos such as these may help her feel that she is mediating misunderstandings. Furthermore, introverts may feel that attention directed at them is less intense if the topic at hand is not about them. I teach 130-150 kids every day, but because the attention is on the class/kids and less on me, I don't feel too drained. However, debating with family members about my life decisions is incredibly draining because the spotlight is on me as a person. Although she is identifying herself as an INFJ, the video is intended to educate, and she doesn't spend much time talking about herself specifically.   Identifying a personality based on Myers-Briggs says more about a persons internal environment than about their outward behavior."
infj,3d97zs,Valhalla0711,3,Tue Jul 14 17:54:40 2015 UTC,"Already proposed that she may still be an INFJ however with just different tendencies but considering we are in a forum based on personality assessment and she made a video regarding the Myers-Brigg, I think making an observation of these things is justified and has nothing to do with a persons (My?) internal environment. If she belongs in another category, I think it's more helpful to point that out than have her be reading and study another assessment that doesn't correlate with her own personality. The observation is not an attack but again, maybe I misread your post as well."
infj,3d97zs,Northerncrafts,2,Tue Jul 14 17:59:45 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying, I guess I just wanted to defend her self identification. Learning about my personality made me feel so much better about myself and helped me feel like I was finally able to understand my own brain. I would personally find it hurtful and confusing to be told that I was actually part of a group I didn't identify with."
infj,3d97zs,Valhalla0711,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:02:46 2015 UTC,"I can see where you're coming from. The flipside though is identifying and alligning yourself with a group who you don't belong with when in contrast, you could be with the right one and be able to fully grow. Otherwise, continuing associating and believing you are someone you merely project yourself to be (when your actions and thoughts do otherwise) is delusion."

infj,3d6fj5,lzimmy,7,Mon Jul 13 22:00:39 2015 UTC,"Is it empathy that the article refers to, or sympathy?  One is intellectually understanding a situation and having an emotional reaction of compassion (sympathy), the other is being able to place yourself in someone else's position temporarily (empathy).  Studies have shown that you can be more empathetic from reading well-written fiction (we have to place ourselves in the character's heads, and we use the exact same psychological processes as we do with real-life empathy), so it is possible to improve existing empathy, but I don't think the initial ability to be empathetic is a choice, and I really don't think people with empathy disorders such as psychopathy and narcissism actually have empathy.  With regards to the group experiment they discussed, in which said empathy-impaired individuals were more generous if they believed the people they were sharing with were part of their group, it could also be assumed that such individuals were being more generous in a calculated way--""I scratch your back, you'll scratch mine"" in the case of a psychopath, or a ""Look at how generous I'm being"" in the terms of a narcissist.  Maybe I'm biased, because I knew a real-life narcissist who would do acts that on the surface appeared to be empathy-based (he was very involved in his community and would organise charity fundraisers), but in reality, he did it for social gain, not because he felt empathy for those involved.  He liked to talk about what an amazing person he was for helping others, and that was the only reason he did that work--so it made him look good to people around him.  Not because he felt empathy or even sympathy for those he was helping.  I think the author of the article confused empathy with sympathy, and while you can definitely increase your empathy stores, I don't think the ability to empathize is a choice.  Sympathy is probably a choice, but not empathy."
infj,3d6fj5,Intempestivity,3,Tue Jul 14 05:47:10 2015 UTC,This article gives very little information about the details of the experiments--we don't know how empathy levels were quantified or assessed in any of the research mentioned--so I'm not sure why you think they were testing sympathy instead of empathy.
infj,3d6fj5,erosenoir,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:29:24 2015 UTC,"My reference to sympathy vs empathy is in relation to the article's claim that empathy is a choice.  The research they have linked to in order to support this claim is relevant to expanding the capacity for empathy, as opposed to choosing to feel it in the first place. The research linked to in the section on psychopathy and narcissism (empathy impairment disorders) does not mention objective means of observing empathy such as brain scans in their abstract, rather it suggests subjective opinions based on actions in group settings. Perhaps the full article has objective measurements; I do not subscribe to that site nor am I going to pay to download the article.  Based on the information available in the article and the linked research, there is only evidence to support increasing one's capacity for empathy; there is nothing to support the statement made by the authors that empathy is a choice."

Agree with this 110%.  The title is misleading.  Your comment got me to click through to some of the research articles, and you are right, the majority of the results are based off of self-reporting.  That is true of the article cited in the section in narcissism (I do have access to the site through my university).

infj,3d8ay0,Demomaroo,2,Tue Jul 14 22:03:09 2015 UTC,I can relate to that. It's been raining where I live for a month with almost no stop. What colors do you have trouble seeing? If you don't mind my asking. I own a little condo and my happiest room is the kitchen which I did in a teal. People complement it often. My sister said that when she first saw it she thought I was crazy but then she started helping me pick out accents for the room and said she suddenly realized teal went with so many possible looks it was almost a neutral.
infj,3d8ay0,Demomaroo,2,Tue Jul 14 22:32:42 2015 UTC,"Red/green are my bad colours, I can see blue okay. I don't know how much you have had to with colour blind people and it's hard to explain but I find colours blend together so shades that are slightly (maybe more) different look the same. So I tend to go with contrasty colours which doesn't always work. Matching accents are a problem. Thanks for another idea."

infj,3d5y3o,redfox13,6,Mon Jul 13 19:56:57 2015 UTC,"I've had similar issues before. I haven't really found a way to ""overcome"" them but I think a huge part of this is getting over yourself. Realizing that the things you obsessively think or worry about don't really matter. All the situations and thoughts that bug you really won't last.   This is an INFP article but maybe it'd help: http://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/07/ask-an-infp-how-do-you-manage-your-emotional-intensity/  I don't know about you but a big part of not feeling loved for me is not feeling understood or wondering why people can't read my mind.   ""One of my bigger faults is definitely holding people to my fantasy expectations, not communicating these expectations to them, and then being sad when they (inevitably) don’t live up to them.  I remind myself that people aren’t mind-readers so I actually have to communicate, out loud, with them before I can be upset."""

infj,3d5y3o,Skryym,4,Mon Jul 13 20:41:42 2015 UTC,"You're never alone.  Don't feel bad about depression/anxiety therapy...  as soon as I get to college I'm going to sign myself up for therapy just so I have someone to talk to.   I'm not sure if I feel exactly like you... Among colleagues, family, and peers I have a recurring feeling of ineptitude and worthlessness.  For example, I can be on the job or writing a paper and feel fine... but as soon as someone else enters the scene I feel worthless, like I'm doing everything wrong and being a nuisance just by breathing.  If people do nice things for me, I get suspicious, like they are trying to take advantage of me (even though I tell myself over and over they are just being normal human beings).  I really don't feel capable of being loved, and that feeling didn't allow me to have true emotional and physical closeness to the only good relationship that ever came into my life.    Working with it.  Coping with it.  I have had a really rough summer so far.  After some bad self-decisions, I went online and bought a whole list of self-help books.  The most amazing by far was The Road Less Traveled by M. Scott Peck... He talks about love and suffering and grace, from 30 years of observations as a psychotherapist.  It's a wonderful book that makes you want to keep fighting and holding on.  Sorry if I'm rambling...  I'm in the same boat as you and I want to help...  but I really haven't fixed anything yet.  But I'm trying.  I think I read on /r/decidingtobebetter of someone who, whenever they felt down, would shout, ""I'm worth a damn!""  I've actually done this a couple times...  it makes me feel silly but at least it lightens the mood.  Writing, drawing, and nature makes me happy.  So I just sit and work or watch...  and it helps.  I'm giving my love to those endeavors, and they are caring back for me."
infj,3d5y3o,joantheunicorn,3,Mon Jul 13 22:24:06 2015 UTC,I had this feeling in dating until I found the right person for me. I had to have someone whose words matched their actions - this is how I learned to truly trust and let go a little.
infj,3d5y3o,Demomaroo,3,Mon Jul 13 21:57:01 2015 UTC,"You are right. They won't love you the way you love them because that is not their way. But it doesn't mean that they don't love you, or that their love is somehow lesser. Part of sharing love with someone is learning to adapt your ways of showing love to encompass their needs while guiding them to do the same for you. For example I had to explain to my extroverted husband how being around lots of people affects me. Now he's built that into how he loves me and will look after me and tip me off to when I need to step back and have a few minutes alone."
infj,3d5y3o,BantlingBee,3,Tue Jul 14 11:39:16 2015 UTC,"I've definitely been there, especially when I've had relationships that were unfulfilling or one-sided.  One of the things that I think is important to consider is that love and care aren't really quantifiable, at least not in the sense that one can adequately measure them. Relationships may follow a specific pattern or archetype, but ultimately each one is formed between two (or more) people with their own unique experiences, preferences, and ways of interacting with the world.   I think it's very admirable of you to be getting therapy and I think a lot of what you're saying does stem from mental health concerns. However, I also think that INFJs tend to get burned out easily if our relationships aren't fulfilling enough or if we don't feel like we're engaging with authentic people. Maybe that's part of the issue."

Let me get this straight you don't know me , don't act like you know me better than me. Just look through the post that u/SevenLevels linked if you believe I am the only one who feels that way. It's very arrogant of you to believe that you can completely grasp humans and human emotion.The brain is the most intricate, complex , and delicate thing in the universe, the universe is full of a lot of events and many other anomalous things. Events or experiences that happened to that person or things about that person that you don't know and nobody can exactly fully grasp. You are just second guessing. People who hurt other people aren't necessarily bad and I mean that in more than one way. Maybe they have a medical condition that you don't know about.It can also be the result of poor judgement.  To be throwing your projections at people and yet sound so sure of them is quite condescending. What's also even more offensive is just because you guessed right on a few people then now you start assuming everybody has the same thinking process; to an extent, yes. Really, you are just overestimating yourself. But every person is also disparate, their way of thinking , their experiences , and most important of all their identity. These things will always remain unique to them. To say that your ""intuition"" can actually figure out each and every one of these peculiar creatures' motives/emotions/reasons is quite disdainful. Not everybody exactly acts on motives(You'd be shocked trust me).I promise you , you won't always be right. And you will make mistakes, we're all just human after all. We think we are rational but it's been proven we are very irrational and can fall to hundreds of biases. We think we know it all , but we rarely do. I know it sounds like an exaggeration , but it's really not.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases  Don't get me wrong , I am not saying that you shouldn't try to read people or that you can't, neither is it hard at all.Just don't make set in stone assumptions.

Also I didn't understand an ENTP I grew up with till more recently (Ti development) and I'm in my 30's, the one I know is very guarded and is outright dishonest (I'm not saying all ENTP's are like this.) when someone strikes close to home. It's best to let him think that I don't understand him until I actually need to cross that language barrier and strike home with something that is actually important.   I'm not talking about ENTP's though, actually in some of these situations there is an ENTP caught in the middle of these situations and I know that the ENTP wants nothing more than to stay out of it and not be bothered and I do my best to facilitate that."

As I've gotten much older, I now pretty much start from the point of we're all flawed in some way, and people I will meet will have some baggage.   That of course doesn't mean everyone gets a free pass to behave badly or say horrible things around me. I tend to call them out, but if I can see good qualities in someone, I won't hate them for it.

infj,3d4syf,superblurryanimals,7,Mon Jul 13 17:42:33 2015 UTC,"For me, it's a thing that can change with age. Although I was never quite a misanthrope, when you're younger and at the mercy of other people, it's easier to hate your situation and the factors (and people) that created it. However as you age I think it's a lot easier to recognize the universal human condition and how everyone is usually at the mercy of something and is acting (or commonly reacting) out of fear or hurt.  When you recognize that, you can also recognize that we all want similar things too, to be loved, safe, accepted, wanted, and to be valuable to others.   We're a mix of lower desires, base fears, and genuine goodness, and when dealing with others you can choose which you're going to focus on and try to draw out of them.  Everyone is so freaking damaged on some level, even stable people who have their act together.  It's easy to get sucked into the negativity since there's so much of it, but as an ""empathetic"" person, I almost find it to be my duty to try to connect to that more loving side in others and encourage and feed it as much as I can.  It's easy to see the ""otherness"" of people, but it's far more rewarding to me to see the similarities. I'd rather walk around feeling compassion, connection, and brotherhood than disgust and derision. It eats away at you to hold on to something so dark, it isolates.  Like Lincoln said, “We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.”"
infj,3d4syf,lzimmy,9,Mon Jul 13 16:03:10 2015 UTC,"Interesting, for me it's the reverse with age.  When I was younger I didn't really even pay attention to the shittines in others as much, I gave people too much respect and the benefit of the doubt, you know the golden rule type thing.  Then as I age and see how shitty people really are just on a day to day basis and the deeper drives of people it makes me retract from them more so.  When younger I would let that shit slide but I realized I was getting fucked over by these people, and since we are feelers it really takes its toll emotionally."
infj,3d4syf,lzimmy,9,Mon Jul 13 16:36:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can easily see how that could happen, and it completely sucks.  Getting fucked over feels even worse when you realize it's an adult consciously making that decision and not some kid. It can really grind you down and make you lose hope in humanity.  I'm sorry you've had to deal with that :(  When I was younger, other kids were so opaque to me.  When they said or did something mean, I couldn't see past the action to the reason and just internalized it. If they said I was bad or stupid, well, that must be true!  If I was weird or they didn't like me, that meant I was a weird and unlikable person. I still have some very outdated and incorrect ideas of myself based on these interactions.  I couldn't see that someone at home was making them feel stupid and bad and they were just acting out most of the time.  I took it very personally and at face value.   Now when adults say say stuff like that, I can pause and consider if there's anything to what they're saying and can reject it.  Or, I can look at them and see where they're broken on the inside and how they relate to others is going to be negatively skewed. Or sometimes I am an ass and I deserve it :) .  I don't have to like them or even continue to interact with them, but the motivations are far more transparent and easier to process now.   edit: Most people are so upset over something going on in their lives that they see you through a distorted lens and half the things they say are more about themselves and not you. The difference with age is that I'll pause and evaluate before accepting something, and I don't feel bad in rejecting their evaluation of me. I couldn't do that for a very long time when growing up."

Then as I age and see how shitty people really are just on a day to day basis and the deeper drives of people it makes me retract from them more so.   I'm in the same position - when I was younger, I used to put up with a LOT from my peers because I wanted to see the best in them and give them in the benefit of the doubt. When older people did things I thought were wrong, I just kind of passed them off as the exception to the rule. The older I get, the more they seem the rule rather than the exception, and the older I get the more it seems that I am the exception.   It's gotten to the point that I only interact with other people outside my family long enough to make a living, and then I avoid them like the plague when I don't have to be around them. Even people I generally like in a workplace environment, I will not seek out for socialization elsewhere because I don't want deeper relationships with them. It seems like whenever I do allow myself to get close to someone like that, I see an aspect of their personality that is completely off-putting to me and it is hard for me to separate that part of their personality from the rest of them in order to enjoy their company.   I have a friend for example who is a good guy in other regards, but doesn't have a problem stealing and will sneak into a movie theater showing with no remorse at all. It is hard for me to separate the good guy from the thief, and just knowing he is morally lax in that area makes me trust him less in every aspect of our relationship."

It bought me a lot of social cred I could use to hide my general awkwardness, idiocy, and goofball nature :D   edit: I feel pretty guilty about it actually; between Ni and Fe I can almost convince anyone to cut me more slack than I actually deserve through their genuine goodwill towards me. I seriously try not to, but dang it can be tempting."

My eyes with snap to someone and I'll just have this feeling that they are not safe. My rule is that I make no effort to get to know these people and never allow myself to be alone with one. I went through a phase where I questioned this sense. So I would casually ask my friends ""So what was that person?"" and without fail the response would be something like ""STAY AWAY FROM THAT GUY!"", ""He get's off on hurting people."" or ""He does terrible things to women."" So now I just trust my inner bastard alarm."

I think the closest I've come is when I know I need to help someone and I manipulate the situation into one where we end up in a space together that we can talk.

Sometimes, I hide information I know because I don't trust the environment around me and I will only reveal it if it would be useful for me.

infj,3d41vs,confustulation,9,Mon Jul 13 10:23:27 2015 UTC,"I'm an HSP.  I also ranked really highly in almost all introversion facets.  HSP traits and introversion are both linked to dopamine sensitivity.  The more sensitive you are to dopamine, the less outside stimulus you require, and the more easily you can be overwhelmed by stimuli.  We all exist on a spectrum, and some introverts, although more sensitive to dopamine than extraverts, have a lower sensitivity than other introverts.  Introverts with a very high dopamine sensitivity tend to be HSPs, because they require very little stimuli in order to feel rewarded, and a ""normal"" amount of stimuli overloads our brains.  I think people saying that HSP is confused with introversion don't quite understand the underlying mechanics of how different brains react to different levels of dopamine.  HSP is often congruent with introversion (not all introverts are HSP, and not all HSP are introverts--there are a very small number of extravert HSP, but the overwhelming majority are introverts)."

infj,3d1rr0,mhjobe,7,Sun Jul 12 20:40:49 2015 UTC,"I used to be really into gaming. Particularly god-type games and strategy games. In these games, I often resorted to cheating. I like having the decks stacked in my favour, and took some sort of delight even against computer opponents, in making them dance to the tune of my drummer.  I realized that I prefer to be in situations where I'm in control. The dimensions of the field, the lay of the land, the location of all participants are all known quantities (fie on the fog of war), and rules of engagement are all crystal clear. Perhaps I've given my units a slight advantage. Or a completely imba advantage. Even with the mastery of a game or sport, there are so many elements that are beyond anyone's control, so why not take an extra advantage if you can? Besides, I hate losing.  Herein lies the crux of the matter. Life is scary. Relationships are scary. The bounds of the field are not known, the rules are not clear. We do not have control, we can only control our own actions. We can't control how people react to us, or what they think of us. We can't know what they are thinking, we can only conjecture. Even if they tell us what they're thinking, or what they want, perhaps there is movement under the surface which shades their words with a subtlety which may escape us if we're not really looking. How do we balance what others want while maintaining ourselves and our needs?   It's all unpredictable. And that's the point. We can't ever know for sure, only make educated guesses. The wiser we get, the better we get at knowing ourselves, and others, and making guesses. We're improvising life, which is the best case scenario. And it's scary. So how do people react to fear? Some can retreat into their tower, isolated, overlooking the terrain. We can even peer into the Machiavellian machinations and tinker with them, maybe give ourselves an unseen advantage over others with some sort of satisfaction, and watch how the game plays out. Or one can venture out into the field of battle, make oneself vulnerable, and rely on one's wits, one's comrades, and come what may."

infj,3d1rr0,autourbanbot,6,Sun Jul 12 22:38:16 2015 UTC,"The best that can be done is to shine a light on your dark side, and so it's great that you are examining that aspect of your unconscious mind. Probably the worst that can be done is to be so afraid of your dark side that the little signs and gestures that it throws your way are completely avoided, denied, or ignored.  Carl Jung spent a lifetime relating his conscious and unconscious minds. It is when I keep my dark side in the dark that it gains power over me - like some sort of monster that, unknown and feared, torments my soul relentlessly, and cowers me under a rock. It's when I shine a light on it, examine it, and gain an understanding of its significance in my life, that its power fades to oblivion.  Perhaps more significantly, analyst Liliane Frey-Rohn observed this paradox, ""'Too much morality' strengthens evil in the inner world, and 'too little morality' promotes a dissociation between good and evil."" James Hollis points this out in his book ""Why Good People Do Bad Things"" page 204 in his chapter on Shadow Work, and regrets that it is so seldom recognized.  My thinking is that the moral fundamentalism that Hollis refers to mispositions the subject away from a healthy humility, and narrows the thinking to an unwise degree. I find it worth greater examination in my life that I am such a strong INFJ, yet enjoy the sport of chess (top 5% competitively) so much, but the game is aggressive and violent by nature. In this we enjoy a synchronicity.  One thought is that, in order to heal this world, I must understand this world; and this world is a most violent one! It is unfair to say that to understand violence is to promote it, or to unnecessarily use it. Many chess lessons of tactics and strategy may be employed more creatively by the imaginative and intuitive INFJ; but why must we negate our potential by stigmatizing ourselves for having an ""impure"" thought?"

Just from my own speculation, my tendency stems from knowing ""too much"" about someone or something. Most of us INFJs can tell whether or not someone is lying to our faces, and that perhaps leads us to our coldness. We are good at what we do daily--reading deeply into things/people--and that can either become a tool to melt a heart or stab it right through.  Edit: I should add that you are normal.

Luckily, I had an awful experience that taught me about the true dark side of manipulation and helped me stop the habit. Sometimes I wrestle with the urge or dark thoughts but I made a conscious effort to avoid going down that road. It's not an uncontrollable urge, so if if you make an effort to avoid this behavior it quickly drains to nothing. Find some good cause you can focus on so you don't get bored and resort to this behavior.   I hope this advice helps a little bit. Speaking from experience, while the manipulation may have an addictive rush of power, it's not worth it and will honestly take you down some very dark roads if you pursue it."

infj,3d1rr0,Horouto,4,Sun Jul 12 23:47:25 2015 UTC,"This describes my experiences pretty well. When I was younger my MBTI tests always came up as INTJ, but I didn't quite feel that cold and logical about everything. The descriptions fit well enough at the time, so I didn't question the incongruities as much as I probably should have.  In those days there were periods where I thought I could be a sociopath. I had that ability to 'shut-down' emotionally, which I later realized was a defense mechanism. With that realization came the freedom to be myself more fully, and the tests shifted to INFJ.  Even so, I feel like I drift between TJ and FJ all of the time. I tend to experience situations from both perspectives simultaneously, but I tend to react from my gut much more often than from my mind.  So maybe you're kind of like me in that way?"

Everyone is unique and no one person will ever fit the description perfectly. It's a spectrum meaning that your personality leads more towards those traits and ways of thinking but doesn't mean you don't have moments where you shut people out. So long as you use your logic for good, I wouldn't be too worried about it. Don't go to the dark side, they lied about the cookies."

We read between the lines very well and can quickly grasp complicated theories.  We like deep discussions, not just about people and the world around us, but also about intellectual concepts.  Remember, Thinkers feel and Feelers think.  The difference is whether logic or feeling determines their final decisions.  There are dark sides to the INFJ.  Hitler was an INFJ.  We read people very well, and if we are not very well developed emotionally, we can use that to manipulate others.  INFJ/ENFJ are also the types most likely to be cult leaders.  We can also use our understanding of people to hurt others when they have hurt us so deeply that we cut off (cobra mode).  So ...

I'm usually cold and aloof with people I don't know well, and continue to come off as such unless they start opening up first.   If I'm serious enough about something, I can become a really good liar. I'm not good at lying with games and stuff because that to me is all fun. But when it comes down to business, I can be manipulative in order to get the outcome I want.

It is hard to forget seeing this side of yourself when the real part of you is so loving, caring, understanding and kind. The other side is the opposite: dark, conniving, manipulative, and out for revenge.   Instead of running from this side like I used to, I learned to love it. I learned to love the badass me inside myself, because in a sense its my only protector.   Maybe we are the only people that see this dark side in ourselves, and that is what gives us the ability to NOT be able to hurt others and manipulate others for our own gain. We understand that this dark side is a monster of sorts that will never gain enough satisfaction from hurting others to ever be satiated. And because we understand this, we can't do it to others. We lock away this sociopath. While we may always feel its presence, we at least learn to understand over the years that it gives us strength and insight more than it gives us pain and misery."

infj,3d391k,lzimmy,2,Mon Jul 13 06:01:57 2015 UTC,"I have no intention of making up with him but whenever he does it, I find myself having strong feelings for him again.   If you have no intentions of making up with him, nor do you want to turn him down flat and reject him, the solution is in your own resolve.  If outward connections are going to continue, that means you have to truly realize that you don't want him in that way and cut off the feelings from your side.    Like most, you're fully capable of interacting with people on a daily basis that you don't care about and it's not even a big deal. You need to mentally get your feelings about this guy to that level. This requires a lot of work on your end.  Maybe make a list of all of the reasons he's NOT good for you. List every reason that the relationship failed and all of the things you didn't like.  Remind yourself why you shouldn't be attracted to him.  Maybe make another list why you do end up getting feelings for him when you interact so you can recognize why it's happening and then how you can stop it.  The only person who can control how you feel is you.    You're going to keep getting hurt and falling for him until you harden your heart and realize that he's truly not good for you.  It's possible to have friendships with these types of people, but first you need to be incredibly clear with yourself and put up some emotional boundaries.  Unless you tell him to, he's probably not going to to stop doing what he was doing, and so it's up to  you to control your own feelings and how you're being affected.  When he does something that makes you like him more you can mentally think, ""The reason why I'm feeling this right now is because he did something kind/complimented me/was funny/etc. and those are things I naturally find attractive. I know that this is not something I want so I'll just appreciate that good quality of his and not be influenced by it. I can love and care for someone without being in love with them, and this has no power over me."" or something.  One day you'll feel absolutely nothing when he does stuff like this and you can be real friends instead of being trapped in a one-sided relationship. Good luck!"

infj,3d391k,ihatenerdlets,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:22:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly I was kind of in the spot of the guy you have in your life about 8 months ago. As an INFJ one of the hardest things for me to do is to move on from the person who I believed to be the love of my life.  The first thing you need to do is be direct with him. Don't give him false hope that some day you guys may get back together. Let him know that you still do care about him as a person and a friend. (If you do feel that way of course) No matter what happens he will likely take it extremely hard, and for people like us we kind of just need to. I know for me it wasn't until about 3 months after things ended that I was able to see that things wouldn't have worked out and that I had to move on. Probably the best thing you can do after you clarify things with him is keep space between both of you for a while anyway. It will help both of you loose attraction to each other.  If you want to stay really good friends after, try going back to him later once he has moved on as well. Saying your sorry that things couldn't work out and apologizing for anything that may have been your fault would probably mean the world to him. It will give him trust and respect for you again even if its not to the same extent as it once was.  Doing this will probably be really hard. You will need to be harsh with yourself and him. But in the end its the best thing for you and him and you need to remember that. Sorry if this wasn't the most helpful. I just wanted to defend the guy you know, because I know how hard it can be to be in that position."

When you listen to other peoples stories, hear their regrets and what-ifs, and you think ""it's not your fault"" , you can then relate that to yourself.  It is not your fault.    I am sorry for your loss.  EDIT:  I've been thinking about you & your post and I wanted to add a few other thoughts.  I realize my original comments may have come across a little bleak, and didn't really offer much advice to you on where you are at now in the early stages of grief.    In the first couple of weeks, I mindfully practiced compassion.  Compassion for myself, my family, my brothers friends and compassion for my brother.  Going back to work helped, it forced me to keep my mind off of him a few hours a day.  I spent hours going through old photos, remembering all the good times with my brother.  My family and I would reminisce about good times and about his decision and the rollercoaster of emotions we felt about it.   I talked to his friends.  I found comfort talking to people that also cared about and loved him.  I'm not going to tell you that things will get better.  That pissed me off when people told me that.  When you loose someone close to you from suicide, it leaves a crack in your heart.  That does not mean that I no longer experience happiness.  I am happy and my life has gone on.  While there were times that I found comfort in talking to other people about my brother, I did go through a stage where it was too much to try to carry other peoples grief and my own at the same time. I think this is the INFJ part.  I wanted to heal other people.  It was too much though, and I had to back away.  So to TLDR it -  It is important to talk about it, it is not your responsibility to heal everybody.  I would check out the Survivors of Suicide site."

I've never lost anyone to suicide, but I did lose someone to a drug overdose once, and it felt like losing them to suicide. It wasn't someone I had been in touch with in years, but I still felt very affected. I made an ""emergency"" therapy session, I found my only friend in town who was also friends with this person to check on them (as they were closer with him than I was), and I wrote a really long email to the ex-boyfriend through whom I knew this person, just reflecting. I am glad you are going through this with his family. Are there other mutual friends; can you lean on each other?   As someone who often has fleeting thoughts of suicide, I can't reiterate enough that this does not reflect on you. I'm not getting much of a read from your post on what his internal world must have felt like, but the health issues sound dire, and I'm sure there were other factors in his decision, but I highly doubt you were one of them.   All the love in the world to you. xoxo"

infj,3cz0ym,damnilovelesclaypool,5,Sun Jul 12 04:27:41 2015 UTC,"I'm so very sorry for your loss.  I strongly encourage you to seek professional help.  Suicides are very difficult to come to terms with.  I think you need an independent third party to help you see that:    It is not your fault.  There is nothing you could have done to prevent this.  It is not your responsibility to help his family through this.  Be supportive of them, but you do not need to shoulder their grief along with your own.   Again, I'm so sorry and I hope you can find some help to help you come to terms with what has happened."

infj,3cz0ym,PluviusReddit,3,Sun Jul 12 06:12:19 2015 UTC,"I'd like to start this off by saying that I'm sorry for your loss.  I'm an INFJ, my best friend is an ESFP, and the relationship you had with your friend sounds extremely similar. Going off of some of the other losses and struggles in my life, dealing with it is the hardest part. What I've usually done is just focus on something else, some other task. It works for a while but then when you remember one thing or something at work or home pisses you off it reminds you of everything else that's happened and it hits you like a brick wall. So don't bottle it up. I couldn't imagine losing my best friend, but if he did die, I have a group of friends I'm almost as close with to turn to and these are the same people he is close to. Talk about it to people. I've found talking gets your thoughts in order quicker than anything.  It's not your fault, if it was, you wouldn't have been his best friend. In fact, speaking from someone who's almost ended up on that other end, you're the reason he stuck around longer."

infj,3cz0ym,_Ajna_,2,Tue Jul 14 03:07:56 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry to hear about your loss. I would strongly recommend joining a support group of those who have lost someone to suicide. I volunteer for a suicide hotline (and also have battled depression for a decade) and I can tell you that someone in a suicidal mindset is not themselves. They are in a dark place that is a result of an unbalanced brain (to put it very simply.) They are unaware that the pain can be lifted with the correct treatment, and act impulsively and take their own life to relieve their suffering. This is not to say they don't have legitimately difficult life circumstances, but oftentimes, there is something psychological at play as well that is sparked by their stress.  My thoughts are with you <3 Remember that your friend didn't want to leave you, but they knew no other way out of their suffering at that moment."

infj,3czdd5,joantheunicorn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:14:05 2015 UTC,"I have little to no experience with ESTJ, but I can share my experiences with an INFP as an INFJ. At first you will probably get along perfectly and you will connect with them greatly, but there are some issues that can arise. As an INFJ you will likely want to tell them what you think they should do because you have a very strong feeling about it and you care about them immensely. The thing about INFPs is that they seem to view the world in a way where everyone should discover their own path. This can result in a situation where you can feel very frustrated when you see them heading down a path that you know will fail. In my opinion the best person for an INFJ is probably an ENFP. Those are just my thoughts from my personal experience though."

infj,3czdd5,Thunder_54,3,Sun Jul 12 04:26:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, my mother is extremely controlling towards me in a few areas. Her main area is her kitchen (a close second is cleanliness of HER house). The woman cooks and bakes like a dream - she is a Martha Stuart clone in cleanliness and craftiness and finesse in the kitchen. I am more the type to wing it in the kitchen....I try to clean as I go, I don't have some method and technique things down, such as basics of baking. This drives her insane. She seemed to forget starting when I was a teen that every movement in HER kitchen was deeply criticized. Obviously it still affects me now in my early 30s. My mother is a wonderful human being, I would literally take a bullet for her to save her pain, but goddamn if she doesn't drive me up a wall some days. I have sworn off her kitchen numerous times but what if I want to make eggs for breakfast or cook my dad a new recipe I learned?!   When she and I team up, watch out. We are both outstanding planners and creators. We have put together parties that leave everyone thanking us profusely and talking about it for weeks after. When we butt heads, it is a battle.

People asking for help in screwing up, seeing therapists, or being thought of as being outcast or dismissed.  ..As you can probably tell, I'm not a fan of the way people can treat us sometimes as INFJ's.

But it also means that I heavily gravitate towards INTJs, INTPs, ENTJs, and even ENFPs more than most other personality types.   I also think a lot of that has to do with maturity of the people you associate with as well as work/school culture. I experienced this ALL THE TIME until I got to high school and got involved with people who were also 'weird'."

I am not (yet) a professional counselor, but I would like to share my thoughts on this.  When it comes to romantic relationships, you may be unconsciously (but surely) trying to be completely honest with yourself. More for INFJs than others, we tend to demand raw genuineness from our significant other. I mean raw genuineness as in no filtering, willing to be true to our hurts and all. If your SO was divinely forgiving and accepting of your said behaviors, this post would not even exist.  The tricky part is that everyone masks their fear of vulnerability with something, in your case seemingly honest anger that's perhaps derived from the abuse you experienced by your mother. This feels like a ""out-of-body"" experience because it comes out automatically, sometimes unintentionally. It is upsetting, then, because you want to keep the image of a loyal friend, a kind employee, a generous family member, and a great significant other. And I'm sure you are!  Everyone needs a venue to vent, release. This is just a suggestion from a fellow redditor, but seek someone who will listen to you, someone who you feel is trustworthy--a confidant, a good friend.  No one is without blemish. I'm sure you will handle this well. Good luck."
infj,3cyw5p,shinbum,2,Sun Jul 12 02:23:51 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for your comment! There is probably a lot of vulnerability (and feelings of sadness) as you say underneath what would get expressed as anger. Perhaps due to not healing completely from everything and due to still feeling child-like at times...that is also in conflict of how I'd like to be processing it through this as an adult.  Maybe with time and venting...things will get better.
infj,3cyw5p,shinbum,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:25:51 2015 UTC,"You're most welcome ;)  I would like to believe that there is a child in all of us, and this child has both the look of innocence and a burning energy to whine and yap.

infj,3cyw5p,kookacat,5,Tue Jul 14 00:14:53 2015 UTC,"No, I totally feel you. I realized over the years that I adapt to different relationships, depending on who the person is and what they are in my life.  I'm pretty reserved around my parents, albeit I show more aggression with them because I can be defiant. I'm more open to speaking my mind with them on certain things like my independence, finances, grades, etc. but not on emotions and life events, really.   On the other hand, how I am with friends vary from friend to friend. I know that sounds really two-faced, but believe me... I try not to come off that way. For me, it only varies with communication. Some friends of mine, for example, are avid texters so I tend to carry conversations with them via text. Some of my closest friends are very outgoing and animated and I tend to become that way around them. Some of my other friends are reserved so I am a bit more reserved around them.  Maybe it's the Fe acting in me to do that. I have gotten myself in some trouble with that, because it can come off as being two-faced. Because of that, I try my best to be completely honest with the people I'm around without being too vulnerable. I pick and choose who I show certain emotions to... like anger, sadness, extreme happiness, etc.   I'm not the kind of person to wear my heart on my sleeve. I'm normally and naturally reserved, but I try to adapt to the people around me."

Something that I have begun to get slightly better at is talking with people about both my happiness and my sadness.  When I was in high school and even through most of college, I only talked about the good things going on with my life. Then something made me realize that even though inside there were feelings of imperfection...it came off to others as me being a perfectionist.  Also, it was interesting how the people that got along well with other people were being real and balanced and found a way to talk about both positive and negative experiences.  I have to keep reminding myself it's all about ""progress not perfection."""
infj,3cyw5p,BygonesBeByeGone,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:36:24 2015 UTC,"That does give me a new perspective. Also, something you said helped me to realize that it is possible that I might only feel ""safe"" displaying anger as an emotion with certain people that have proven themselves to be secure and loving. With that, though, it could also be why the immense guilt can settle in after something like this occurs.  It's a piece of me that would be great to reduce or be rid of entirely. Also, feeling upset can drain energy.  I'm also private, so can relate to what you're saying...it is often easier for me to listen rather than openly share unless very comfortable with a person."
infj,3cyw5p,demesure,2,Mon Jul 13 21:32:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you for sharing.  INFJs are one of those types that are extremely in tune with what others are feeling and are needing, yet not in tune with what's going on inside of ourselves. It's because we have a Fe function, not a Fi function.   And a part of ""Fe"" is adjusting oneself to the outer world. INFJs naturally love to see balance in things, so based on who we are interacting with, we might be playing that role of balancing out the relationship. Does this sound like what you do?  If that's the case, I think you're absolutely normal. You mentioned abuse. That's something that I hope you can heal eventually from. I don't think I have any practical advice other than that many of us feel like we're changing ourselves based on the environment/people. You're not alone!"

infj,3cuyce,LKaseR,6,Sat Jul 11 20:53:56 2015 UTC,"This is a classic error in thinking. Firstly, consider that a person needs to find an environment in which to flower. If a career affords a living but not a life, then perhaps it is not the environment in which to flower.  One of my biggest early discoveries as an adult is that, though it is best to accept personal responsibility whenever possible, it is not always right to do so. No more so than a plant that is in too much sun and needs to be transplanted to a shady microclimate on your property would be blameworthy for wilting if neglected too long in an inappropriate environment.  I have most recently discovered that I have been mistaking depression in my own life for my simple but profound need to enjoy solitude and to recharge from the incredibly stimulating yet utterly exhausting daily treks into the outside world. The more that I accept this need, the better the recharge - the more that I resist it, the more conflict and pain I experience.  The biggest challenge I face is to foster in other intimates an understanding of this need, and do not feel offended by my need to periodically withdraw from the world, sometime for long periods of time. Think of  Gandalf the Grey, who disappears into the fiery abyss, only to not only improbably return alive, but transformed into the spiritually superior Gandalf the White!  If your feelings of depression last more than a few days, then something in your life is seriously out of balance. Nobody should accept anything less than whatever happiness may be gained from life, and so please be encouraged to continue seeking your own happiness.  I try to remember, in my darkest moments, that the darkest moments are just before dawn. Nighttime is there to provide punctuation between a bad day, and the following morning, when I may start anew, and exercise my gratitude for the gift of another day, and other lesser blessings."

If you're constantly depressed and fatigued, perhaps ask yourself what's triggering this? The job? Not enough rest? Not enough support? Again, forgive me for assuming but I try my best to help. :)"

I think that's maybe what the song is about too. Just because you'd rather be at home, doesn't mean you should avoid social interactions. You'll miss out that way."
infj,3cua52,zacharyfmtaylor,8,Fri Jul 10 23:22:05 2015 UTC,"I think the trick is to identify the social interactions that you will enjoy, and avoid the ones where you will be like the video - wishing you were somewhere else.  For me, that's basically avoiding the really loud, crowded nights out, where you are yelling to be heard, can't hear anyone unless they are specifically shouting at you, and it's a 15min squishy wait to get a drink."

If you feel the absolute necessity to help people (verbally, physically, emotionally, however), do so. The method is yours, so is your outcome. We INFJ's, in my opinion, learn best by experiencing everything ourselves; no one can lecture us to enlightenment. So do what you want to do, and do enough with the same passion you had as you wrote those very words up there. As for the result of your life philosophy, again, is yours. I thank you for your passion, I can almost feel the heat. Good luck."

Yet, it's the exact opposite. I feel intensely, and it boggles me as to how people can fiddle around talking about their problems, ideas, and goals. Yet they never do anything and it just makes me want to scream, toss them to the side and grow as a person.   But even now I worry that I'll end up demotivating them if I do that."

My mind can't handle tip toeing and trying to do a balancing act of somewhat caring about someone and offering advice.  It's like I have to give myself to them, or slice the cord clean.

Maybe you just traveled too fast for her to keep up? As an INFJ, I often need to reevaluate my friendships and determine what the pace is of each one of them. Then I re-adjust myself to fit whatever need the other person has. But sometimes, I am smothered and that pushes me to withdraw a bit. But I wouldn't close people from my life if they smother me with affection - that spot is deserved for people who break my trust, and from what I'm reading, it doesn't seem like you did anything to break her trust. You were just being overly affectionate. I'd say give her some space, but don't cut off communication entirely. When people just cut communication off from me abruptly, I tend to do the same. But when it comes to affection, I need breaks from it. I don't like being bothered about every single thing I'm pre-occupied with at every single moment, and if you are doing that, then I suggest tone it down a bit. Give her time to think, and I think she'll appreciate that very much."

infj,3cvuhc,Intempestivity,2,Sat Jul 11 06:03:31 2015 UTC,"This will be really embarrassing but...   I told her about how I was getting too emotionally attached to her. That I noticed that she was getting a little uncomfortable with my physical affection (I'm sorry I really tend to go overboard on this. It's something I should learn to control.) ... That I decided to cut off before she feels too suffocated with me. Also I noticed I was getting a little bit possessive, so I wanted to back off before I cause any damage.   But it didn't work, and she knew that I was giving her really sad looks (Again, mistake on my part to not conceal my feelings. She knew that I knew that she would see how i'm feeling). I told her that I missed her quite a bit after awhile, and that I've started being emotionally attached after the first one-on-one convo. She was kind of shocked, but acknowledged that there was a connection. She also said that she would most likely get attached to me as well in the long run but i was going way too fast for her to follow.   I think (just a gut feeling but I'm not sure of this) that she feels overwhelmed because I told her that I was confused about my feelings (Hint: Les) but really now that I think about it that was a mistake too. I didn't clarify with her the next day that I am not into her romantically. I figured that she would want space, so we didn't really talk much the next day.   Also, I sent her a chunk of text telling her to allow me to love her (platonically) even if she couldn't reciprocate. The mushy stuff that chases people away. I still cringe thinking about it."
infj,3cvuhc,hintofsass,2,Sat Jul 11 06:54:31 2015 UTC,"When people have come on too strong for me, I need to retreat.  I might need a few days to distance myself from the event, or a few weeks.  It depends on what was said and done.  For me, personally, if I've opened my heart to someone and let them in, even if I need to distance myself temporarily for whatever reason, I usually come back same as before, after I've had some time to cool my heels.  It's only when they have seriously violated my trust that I close them off forever.  Obviously, I can't speak for your friend, but if you two were as close as you say you were and the conversation you had just overwhelmed her but didn't make her feel betrayed or unsafe, she might very well just need some time to clear her head and then she'll come back--slowly at first, but in time it will be like it was again.  At least, that's how I'd be if it were me."

infj,3cs2ff,lookforlinda,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:17:14 2015 UTC,Your social life sounds fantastic!  I don't drink either and I don't go out very often. I love 1-1 coffee dates and small group settings.  I don't have an SO right now but I do have friends and family that I'm very grateful for.
infj,3cs2ff,floodster,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:46:24 2015 UTC,Drinking helps us a lot for parties. Personally I don't drink which causes me to never be in the mood for going out for parties. But I'm perfectly happy just chillin.
infj,3cs2ff,giotheflow,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:40:46 2015 UTC,"You just described my perfect social life. I really think INFJs are really quite satisfied with a really small group of trusted people. An inner circle. Any more than 10-15 usually means I can't develop the deep relationships that I prefer. Nights out are okay, but I much prefer it if the places I go are quiet enough to hold a conversation and don't have too many people."
infj,3cs2ff,Intempestivity,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:55:30 2015 UTC,"I think whatever is comfortable to you is healthy.  I think forcing yourself to do something that you will find draining, irritating and unfulfilling because of peer pressure or you think that you have to do it to make other people happy is unhealthy.  What you wrote in your OP sounds a lot like myself.  I don't do birthday parties--much like you, my husband and I have some time off and go and do something together.  I meet with friends one on one, and that's around once a month.  Drinking is shit and so is going out after work--I used to do these things, but they made me feel tired and annoyed.  I never enjoyed them.  I'm much more at peace with myself now that I don't include such activities in my life, and I think that's a good thing."
infj,3cs2ff,thellamarevolution,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:22:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's healthy. I enjoy one on one connection as well. I don't like throwing bday parties for myself either. What's important is whether you're happy and getting your needs fulfilled emotionally/socially. Some people are content with a small social circle. The advice of ""you need more friends"" and ""you should go out more made things draining for me."
infj,3cs2ff,kookacat,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:34:16 2015 UTC,"I'm very similar to you. People often say that I need to go out more or go to parties and stuff like that, but I don't agree with them. I have tried, but it does not make me comfortable, I hate it. I see no reason to push myself into doing something that I don't want to do, just for the sake of pleasing other people. I interact with people in small groups, and when they take off to the party, I head home. I mostly get this from extroverts though, I sometimes feel as if they have it harder understanding us than vice versa."
infj,3cs2ff,jeff233,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:07:01 2015 UTC,"I think it's whatever you feel comfortable with, but also knowing how to balance your quiet time and socializing time. Mine used to be outbalanced (more social than quiet) and it overwhelmed me; on the other hand, sometimes I would spend more quiet time than I needed and that made me emotionally volatile and cynical. I'm more a one-on-one person so I like getting coffee and lunch with my friends. But I don't mind spending time with groups of 3 or 4, depending on what we do and who they are... as long as I get rest afterwards. I'm not fond of big events like parties and normally don't go to them unless it's someone I consider important in my life and/or will have a lot of acquaintances and mutual friends to be around."
infj,3ctad6,PeenoNoir,6,Fri Jul 10 16:28:24 2015 UTC,"I relate. This caused me troubles when first moved to where I live now. It's my husband's home town and he was so eager for people to know me that he would just start telling them all these things about me. None of it was really sensitive but I felt like he had just stripped me naked and asked everyone what they thought. I had to tell him to please let me speak for myself and be patient. I don't even like it when Netflix wants to post my viewing history on Facebook. I death stare the TV and think ""No way, that Avatar the Last Airbender marathon is between me and my sketchbook. . . and also nobody look at my sketchbook!"""
infj,3ctad6,Demomaroo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:46:20 2015 UTC,"I hope you find the right balance so you can defend yourself without feeling exposed. I'm in such a situation with my blood relatives and instead of defending myself I decided to retreat and just let them talk amongst themselves. On one hand it's great not to be involved in the drama but my silence comes across as validating their point of view. I would've defended myself if I could have, they think. You just can't win. Good luck!"
infj,3ctad6,Demomaroo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:04:49 2015 UTC,"I get close to people, just few and slowly. And since there is a wide variety in those people I've found that what is safe to share in one group may not be safe to share in another. Even if it's just the shows I watch or the foods I eat. Everybody has an opinion."
infj,3ctad6,VelociraptorPatronus,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:35:08 2015 UTC,"I wish I could be more like my ISTP husband who doesn't get ruffled by other people's opinions about him.   Good or bad, I get affected. Ugh."
infj,3ctad6,Brazilian_jp14,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:46:59 2015 UTC,Haha! I had the same experience when I moved to my husband's country and began hanging with his social circle. I found there was a lot less pressure making my own friends because his involvement made me feel very self-conscious.   I actually do post my films to letterboxd but its anonymous and no one knows I do. I do it because I love to make lists!
infj,3ctad6,cookiehermit,3,Fri Jul 10 18:07:05 2015 UTC,I'm secretive because I want to control what people see of me so they don't judge me.
infj,3ctad6,Subcommandante_Khan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:30:18 2015 UTC,"Damn, me too"
infj,3ctad6,jeff233,2,Sat Jul 11 01:03:29 2015 UTC,"I certainly relate! I've been told I exert an independent and confident vibe when with others that I am not close with.  It was surprising when I heard it (from an INTJ), because those are definitely not the words I would use to describe myself.  I think it depends largely on what you are secretive about, since it is completely natural to not tell somebody every single thing in your life.  I just don't see the need to, particularly if it is something mundane or something I don't think is anything very interesting or special.  My social media profiles are almost dead-like.  I am secretive on my emotions, judgments and thoughts.  I can feel intense emotions but I keep them within myself (though close friends of mine, who broke into that hard external shell of mine, would be able to tell) almost all of the time.  It's rather difficult as we INFJs tend to shoulder other people's emotions on top of our own, hence I sometimes get the feeling that I am overwhelmed with something.  I'm not as secretive when it comes to people I care about, but there is still a certain subconscious filter depending on who it is..."
infj,3ctad6,americanpharoah,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:18:50 2015 UTC,"Yup, I don't like people getting close to me usually."
infj,3csxxt,__leatherandlace__,2,Fri Jul 10 14:52:02 2015 UTC,"You are aware that you're doing it so that's always step one in managing a problem. I think the best thing to do is to try and keep track of when it happens, what triggered it, who triggered it etc. You'll notice patterns and eventually you'll be able to predict when you are feeling anger or manic. If you don't notice patterns, just notice when it happens and take a moment to self reflect.   I don't have any diagnosis, but I often go into a rage for no reason and will be hard on my s/o. I'm slowly trying to get better. I always try to self reflect and then apologize even though it can seem hard sometimes."
infj,3csxxt,infjthoughts,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:02:52 2015 UTC,"It's good to hear that you are aware of your behavior with your s/o. Admitting we're wrong is always really difficult, for anyone.    I really appreciate your input.  But what I've found lately is that though my awareness is increasing, it makes me feel lonelier or just worse.  It's nice to be able to see when things are happening but I just feel so guilty for reacting in a negative way.  Thank you again though.  I really do appreciate your kindness."
infj,3csxxt,shinbum,2,Sat Jul 18 17:48:14 2015 UTC,"I was never officially diagnosed, but I have had personal experiences with that. I can't confidently say that my method will work for others, but I keep a private journal with me all the time for cathartic fulfillment. I write--more like rant--on that pocketbook whenever I can't seem to handle a certain situation/idea/thought. I really hope you find your venue."
infj,3csxxt,shinbum,2,Fri Jul 10 21:43:20 2015 UTC,"I do this exact thing!  And what's interesting is that I tend to do it in times of distress as well.  When things are going well, I hardly ever have anything to write.  Do you feel the same way?"
infj,3csxxt,lookforlinda,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:49:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's true for me too. But those times haven't happened in a long time. There's been always something to write."
infj,3csxxt,bokehtoast,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:54:01 2015 UTC,"I can identify with this to an extent. I've gotten a lot better at regulating my emotions over the years. My ""manic episodes"" are rare but they're mostly internal.   I've spent a lot of time recently looking for stress and anger inducing triggers and trying to work my life around avoiding these things. I don't want to eliminate challenges and hardship completely from my life, but I have OCD tendencies that will probably bother me for the rest of my life. I used to think by working hard at some things I could improve them, but now I'm realizing some things just aren't worth the time or effort. It's just part of my personality and inclinations."
infj,3csxxt,PeenoNoir,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:36:47 2015 UTC,I used to be diagnoseable as BPD and no longer am.  I have been in therapy for a long time and completed a DBT program which really changed my life.  PM me if you would like to know more about my experiences.
infj,3csxxt,CrownChief,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:23:03 2015 UTC,"Wow, I am impressed because I thought that one of the defining characteristic of someone with BPD is that they won't acknowledge it. They live in denial and thus make it impossible to treat. But you are self-aware and committed to managing it so bravo!  ""Some research links the propensity to be annoyed to particular genes, those associated as well with some forms of bipolar disorder."" http://bit.ly/1SdykQA  You can confront the issue directly or you can learn to distract yourself from it.   If you want to increase your patience with others then you must learn breathing techniques and learn to be humble because we are all bumbing idiots and need mercy and love.  If that doesn't work then try to shift your focus away to something else that uses your body or mind. Ignore the elephant in the room."

infj,3ctov1,PeenoNoir,9,Fri Jul 10 18:14:24 2015 UTC,"I agree with jeff233. I've always tried to explain it by comparing it to someone who is so good at math they come up with the right answer but never show their work. Our brains do that with other kinds of information. You know it, your just hard pressed to explain to anybody how you know it because your brain didn't show it's work."

infj,3ctov1,shinbum,8,Mon Jul 13 01:20:38 2015 UTC,A good example is when you use your Ni and have gut instincts about someone.You seem to know the person better than they know themselves.But if you explain your intuitions to another type they most likely will think you're a space cadet or wannabe psychic which is basically   another word for a mystic.edit: and the more you try explain what you know the less other non INFJ types will comprehend you..
infj,3ctov1,jeff233,4,Fri Jul 10 18:25:25 2015 UTC,I feel like it's not so much that I know the person better than they know themselves. It just that I can make connections between things that aren't apparent to them which helps them to see their situation  more clearly.
infj,3ctov1,Thunder_54,4,Fri Jul 10 19:17:34 2015 UTC,"I've had my intuition dismissed numerous times, which is why I have ignored it. Many times, my insights have turned out to be right."
infj,3ctov1,jeff233,3,Sat Jul 11 13:49:16 2015 UTC,"the more you try explain what you know the less other non INFJ types will comprehend you..

infj,3ctov1,danyalzia,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:41:09 2015 UTC,What I have noticed with S dominants is to avoid talking about Ni in general. They do not get it and their  stone like dullness must really suck lol..
infj,3ctov1,Tikem,3,Sun Jul 12 23:03:01 2015 UTC,"Being a mystic doesn't come from Ni, but from Ni+Fe. It's when you get insight on people out-of-nowhere, like in a moment you were thinking about something, and then suddenly the irrelevant thought happens in your mind, which gives you the answer of the question you asked in your mind subconsciously. It's what those descriptions say ""Aha"" moments. Fe helps you coming to the conclusion by absorbing the vibe and emotions of people around you, then those social cues are interpreted through your Ni to give a canny insight. No doubt, INFJ is potentially a great lie detector by nature."
infj,3ctov1,bezald,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:12:37 2015 UTC,"Very interesting. Maybe I'm not INFJ afterall? My experience has not been this ""out of thin air"" mysticism at all. To continue the math analogy I find that my intuitions are based on ""proofs."" It's very disjointed at first but then I can internally organize it, find the logic and then relay it as A->B->C."
infj,3ctov1,Thunder_54,3,Fri Jul 10 18:45:31 2015 UTC,"No, I think that's quite normal. It's not so much that you think it's ""out of thin air"", but rather that other people find the ""disjointed"" logic outlandish and hard to follow."
infj,3ctknf,iwannayoutube,6,Fri Jul 10 17:43:59 2015 UTC,"It's OK to have boundaries about intimacy as well as physical cheating. And it's OK to speak up and say that it worries you especially if you approach it as ""This bugs me a little and I want to deal with it before it turns into a big deal for me."" A couple points to consider, did he reschedule your time together or just cancel? And is this game like an online thing with scheduled events that he can't control?"
infj,3ctknf,Demomaroo,3,Fri Jul 10 18:05:27 2015 UTC,"^ I second this comment. You've indicated that in the past, he's talked to you about everything, even lustful feelings about other people. This is a very good sign, and suggests he would probably be open to talking to you about this."
infj,3ctknf,TheQuietudeAbides,3,Fri Jul 10 21:34:33 2015 UTC,"I mean if it was a guy friend you could tell him to stop texting and focus on your time together and it would seem fine. But since it's a girl it can give the appearance of jealousy or like you feel threatened. I do think you should address it is some way because everyone has to have boundaries and say what they feel is acceptable and what is not. And I also know that your gut is a really good indicator of things, kind of like your sub conscious sending you signals that something is not quite right. So it could either be a sign that something is going on between them, or just that you feel she is getting in the way of your relationship. I don't know how exactly to go about the conversation, but I feel if he is faithful and cares for you he will see where you are coming from and be willing to make adjustments or pull back on his closeness with her."

infj,3cshtf,mirror_effect,4,Fri Jul 10 12:24:36 2015 UTC,"I do a lot, mostly when I'm in a negative state of mind though. When I'm happy I'm usually doing something I enjoy, I spend less time focusing on myself and more time either contemplating the things around me or enjoying my friends, etc... I want to be a part of the world. When I'm in a neutral mood by myself I usually just passively observe things until I find myself becoming either happy or unhappy. My focused introspection isn't very positive, I have to work at it through meditation."
infj,3cshtf,mariecatoinette,3,Fri Jul 10 13:51:49 2015 UTC,"Do you ever sit down, lay down, or lounge around alone in silence, to analyze or measure your emotional and mental state?  I’m new to this but I thought it was INFPs who are masters at self-analysis and that we INFJers have a blindspot for ourselves but can figure out other people.  Anyway my answer is yes, all the time and still not enough. But probably more than half the time I'm focusing externally and analyzing other people.  That stillness paradoxically energizes me more than almost anything else. I effortlessly “get into the flow” and then ofc I want to stay there as long as possible. It’s addictive and I resent anyone or anything that interrupts and takes me out of the zone.   The act of thinking about life is just like having a ball of yarn set before me. Naturally, I try to untangle it.   My attention focuses first on the people I care about but if I don’t have any ready “material” then I will move onto a looser connection which can be a real person or a character in a film, tv show or book. In my silent space I recall their words, actions, emotional responses and then analyze the connections and contradictions between them.   Do their words match their actions? Do I detect some disconnect between their stated emotional response (the words they use to describe their feelings) and their subconscious emotional response (their body language, tone of voice, expression of their eyes, etc.). Are they lying to themselves? Are they lying to me to protect their sense of self? We are all the unreliable narrators of our lives. This sounds negative but it works equally well in the other direction. Happy, shiny people are brilliant at constructing their positive world.   I like to figure out “the space” in which people live…their personal narrative, their sense of themselves, their motivations. One person might consider a situation a problem while another might suppress or ignore it while another might be oblivious to it and not care at all. So what is a person’s tolerance level. What matters to them? Which incentives do they respond to? What are the stakes of their lives? How do they see cause and effect? What are their hangups? Do they exhibit fallacious thinking?   The answers to these and other questions allow me to see clearly the friction in people’s lives and what their options are for changing it. Or why things work. For those particular people in that particular circumstance. Etc.. It can be about positive things just as well as negative. When I am having a problem my emotions make it very difficult for me to find the clarity and objectivity that comes naturally when it’s not about me.   I get the biggest buzz and I feel the most productive and that I produce the best quality “work” when I have the sense of unlimited time and space. I get claustrophobic and paralyzed when there’s not enough freedom for my mind to expand how and when I want.  However, I can’t help but do it when I’m face to face listening to someone but it’s more in the background because I’m too focused on performing my part in the moment. I’m also multi-tasking because I’m trying to figure out on the spot how to communicate with the other person in a way that’s not only understandable (because it’s abstract and complex) but polite and non-confrontational.   What we see can be confrontational even if we ourselves are neutral and open-minded. I usually feel like, ""I'm just the messenger. Please don't shoot me.""  I’d better stop because it feels like I could go on and on about this for a long time."
infj,3cshtf,PeenoNoir,2,Fri Jul 10 15:35:50 2015 UTC,"Introspection is a huge part of my daily life. I do just that which you mentioned: sit down in silence, analyze my emotional/mental state. Usually, what goes through my mind tends to be negative. I ask myself Am I crazy/mentally ill? the most. This is perhaps because I am a depression/suicide survivor. The biggest one is almost always self-dissatisfaction; I am discontent with who I am, where I am, what I am doing how much. In that, I notice the pattern that I hate but embody without resistance: constant growth. Constant growth intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually (in terms of religiosity).  I maybe do this at least twice a week."
infj,3cshtf,shinbum,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:52:45 2015 UTC,"I just constantly question myself. All day, every day if there is a problem I'm trying to solve. I can never tell if how I'm feeling is real, or self-imposed. I know perception is reality and I'm constantly trying to figure out the most unbiased truth of any situation. I drive myself crazy. I will write out how I'm feeling until I've gotten every single thought out ... and then I will talk to multiple people about an issue I'm obsessed with and weigh the feedback I'm getting to decide what is actually happening, and what the most appropriate way to proceed is.    *Edit: These kinds of thoughts are predominantly negative and anxiety-filled, and fueled by interactions with other people that I get paranoid about. Maybe once every 5 years I have a seriously painful epiphany about an aspect of my own behavior that I do not like and then beat myself up over it for a long time, which is the beginning of my earnest and thorough attempts to change it.

If she refuses to cooperate or if she gets angry and belligerent, take it to her landlord.  That way, you can say you tried to resolve the issue quietly, but she just wouldn't cooperate.

infj,3cs7xm,Demomaroo,3,Fri Jul 10 17:56:54 2015 UTC,"About insomnia, I had it from the time I was a little kid until about 2 years ago. I’d miss days and days of sleep and then crash and wake up in a chair somewhere with my friends saying “You haven’t moved in 12 hours. We had to check to make sure you weren’t dead.” The biggest thing I found to help was Melatonin. It’s an over the counter supplement. I don’t take it very often. But when I’ve had a bad night I’ll take it the next couple of nights to get my sleep pattern back on track. I also do my best to go to bed the same time every night, even if I know I won’t sleep right away. Since I started getting really serious about my sleep schedule I’ve got it down to about 4 sleepless nights a year instead of a week."

infj,3ct7k3,roarker,4,Fri Jul 10 16:06:38 2015 UTC,"As INFJ we can be out of touch with our bodies and what they need. This can be very important if you are dealing with depression or any type of emotional control issues. Get to know your body and give it what it needs. Exercise in some way that you enjoy, avoid crap foods especially fats and sugars, avoid things like caffeine and alcohol which can cause your mood to roller coaster. Make sleep a priority. Learn to breath. It’s weird but it works. These things are effective and you can start them at any moment. If you have a support system of other people use it. Talk to people who care about you or even share here for some encouragement. Do something so that your SO doesn’t feel they are the only one carrying the weight with you. Thank your SO for supporting you and for the things they do right. These are the best things I know to do immediately."

But I know I HAVE to, for my health.  I'm throwing a small girl's night tomorrow involving desserts, but after that I'm try to stay away from sugar. I'm already pretty good about caffeine and I don't touch alcohol.   Hopefully finding a therapist will give me another emotional outlet, but I'll try to confide in close friends in the mean time. Thanks a lot for your input, and if anything else comes to mind I'm willing to try pretty much anything that might help."

I've also included a few other activities that helped me work through some of the worst of my depressive episodes.   Lay down on your back, arms flat on your sides.  Curl your toes and feet while breathing in through your nose to a count of three.  Hold the tensed muscles along with your breath for another count of three.  Slowly release the muscles in your feet while breathing out through the mouth to a count of three.  Repeat with your calves.  Then your quads/hammies/glutes.  Then your abdomen.  Your fists and forearms.  Your biceps and shoulders/upper back.  Your traps and neck.  Your face.  If you're still tense, repeat, starting at the toes.  Repeat as many times as necessary to calm yourself. If you're not in a place where you can lay down and tense your muscles, just do the breathing.  In through the nose for three, hold for three, out through the mouth for three. Repeat a mantra to yourself.  Mine usually consists of ""I am [full name], I live in [place], and I am ok.""  It is useful to do this while doing the above breathing exercise. Sometimes, you just gotta cry it out.  Get a pillow and sob.  Scream in to it.  Punch the pillow.  Cry until you're worn out, then put on a funny film. Funny films in general are a good thing.  They might not make you laugh when you're dealing with depression, but they helped make me feel a bit less raw. Animals.  They are magic healers.  If you have a pet, spend time with it.  If your friend or family member has a pet, ask if you can spend time with it/borrow it for a little while.  If you have the energy, volunteer at an animal shelter. Try to put that emotion in to something productive.  Write.  Draw.  Sculpt.  Paint.  Collage.  Build a treehouse.  Anything creative and productive. Pamper yourself.  Again, it would help make me feel a bit less raw and a bit more normal.  It could be anything from a really luxurious bath bomb to painting your nails to changing your hair (be wary with the hair, though--don't make any rash haircuts while depressed.  It might make you feel better for a week, then you might hate it.  Colouring's ok, because that can be changed).   You can beat this thing.  Just take it one day at a time.  If you ever really need to talk to someone, PM me.  My inbox is always open."
infj,3ct7k3,Intempestivity,2,Fri Jul 10 18:06:01 2015 UTC,"I've actually been taught that sleep trick before, it works really well. Currently at work trying to hold my shit together, but thanks for giving me some things to try/look forward to. I'm going to take a long bath as soon as I get home and just cry until I feel like I've have enough of a release. Totally wish there was a rent-a-kitten service."
infj,3ct7k3,Intempestivity,2,Fri Jul 10 18:13:25 2015 UTC,"You're ok.  Work is only a few hours, you got this.  Another thing I've found super-helpful is guided meditation.  There's an app called Calm which is just perfect for it.  It offers really great medidation options and plays a soothing background noise (I'm partial to the rain one).  You just plug your headphones in to your phone, close your eyes and focus on your breathing.  I used to use it every day during my lunch, and it really helped me stay calm enough to get through the day.  Edit:  And a rent-a-kitten service is an awesome idea.  Do you know if your local animal shelter is looking for fosters?  I don't know your housing situation and if you're allowed pets, but if you want to have an animal around for a while it's a good option if your living arrangements allow."
infj,3cr7xn,TienStoneblessed,2,Fri Jul 10 03:10:36 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry so much about ""why"" it is you think this way. The obsession with self-awareness is just bringing about confusion and ultimately counterproductive if what you want is to meet new people, get into a relationship or expand a current one.  Think more about the process it takes. New relationships whether romantic or platonic take work. You need to put in time, develop common interests or hobbies, improve your empathy, your small talk, all of that.  You shouldn't worry about all your inner dialogue and just go out there and make things happen. Fail. And fail again. It'll make things much easier in the long run.  What you should do is put on some headphones, listen to music, take a walk, or drive. Find a comfortable situation where you can leave the world and lose your thoughts.  Focus on self-improvement vs self-awareness, and revisit the topic when you're ready again. Your mind will clear up which makes organizing your thoughts much easier. Good luck!"
infj,3cr7xn,EverydayMusic,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:46:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've been taking bike rides pretty much daily for this reason. I've been obsessing over self awareness for a while now and I know it isn't good, but it's hard to repress sometimes. Thanks for the advice :D"
infj,3cr7xn,For-realthistime,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:05:59 2015 UTC,"Totally get this. While I haven't really found a foolproof way to combat it, I've noticed a few from the times I've been better about it that I don't mind sharing.   First of all, there are people out there just as ""obsessive"" as you, and everybody is looking for deeper relationships on some level. Your best bet is to define what you want, and be open to something different. In the end, it's not about what you desire, it's about what helps you grow as a person.  Second, try to remember on a daily (or hourly) basis that everyone comes with heir own set of your faults. That sounds weird, but hear me out. You're not perfect, right? Neither am I, and neither is anyone else. The jealousy, envy, greed, lust, insecurity, joy, peace, and whatever else you feel, everyone else feels in their own way. This has a twofold purpose: 1. It helps you reevaluate what ""ideal"" is. Ideal is not perfect, it's striving toward the general direction of perfection, despite that goal being ""unattainable"". 2. It helps you realize that those small, good things you fixate on are constantly surrounded by bad, less desirable things that serve to complete that person. It's just how it all works.   So, basically I challenge you to reevaluate your definitions with a few things. It never hurts, and sometimes it helps."
infj,3cr7xn,kayleyrae,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:38:17 2015 UTC,"I actually fully realized how much I do this after reading Paper Towns by John Green recently.  In it, the main character Q imagines up a version of another person as a means to meet his own needs, fulfill his own fantasies or perception of that person rather than having a complex understanding of a separate human being that exists for themselves. This character would practically romanticize his object of affections' breathing patterns, given the chance.  I know you're not talking exclusively about romanticizing people you're attracted to, but it still false within this false perception arena that the book deals with, and that I've dealt with. Green kind of acknowledges this tendency to fit people into your initial or restricted perception of them, without fully considering the complexity of their being. We acknowledge that each human being is limited to the scope of their imagination and experience, and therefore literally every perspective is slightly skewed. Human beings are each individually a vast collection of thoughts, aspirations, opinions, beliefs, experiences, individual strengths, and weaknesses. How could I ever even hope to fully understand one who I speak to, not being them? I think the simple acknowledgement of the complexity of another person is the start. Being open to learning about them, and realizing that you do not- and will never- have a full grasp on who anyone is. There are things that people will prove to you through time. But we cannot make them one-dimensional or expect them to follow the character outline we've written for them in our heads. First, accept that you don't know everything about them, realize and try to stop when you're imagining things about them that aren't really there. Ask them questions, observe them, pay attention to how they answer, and try to catch yourself when you're jumping ahead of proof in your ideas of them. Sorry if that was no help at all. Kind of went on a tangent there eheheh."
infj,3crp08,Greasypatriot,4,Fri Jul 10 05:59:26 2015 UTC,"Instead of any acting out, ""running away"" and engaging him in whatever arguments, have you looked at returning to court and working towards your mother getting more/full custody over you? I believe courts will hear your perspective. I would also start keeping a record of dates/times/comments your dad makes, if you feel he is being emotionally abusive. Courts would look at this too.   When you are a teenager, sometimes it is very easy to just be mad, have outbursts. A teenager's brain is also developing, especially portions of the frontal lobe can be ""down for construction"" during teenage years and this can make controlling emotions very difficult. INFJ can be prone to outbursts or getting very passionate about things that upset us. Going forward, it will help you the most to think clearly, document what is happening where your dad cannot see it, know your facts and legal rights and advocate for yourself. I don't know the whole situation, so I could be off of course. There may be people at your school such as a counselor or school psychologist who can help you research your options as well."
infj,3crp08,joantheunicorn,2,Fri Jul 10 07:43:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I have been hesistant to use the courts as they are the reason I'm here. I haven't considered logging them yet, I'll definitely have to do that."
infj,3crp08,Shaftronics,3,Fri Jul 10 17:02:18 2015 UTC,"You're fine. People think they can walk over INFJ's just because we prefer silence and being non-confrontational. As passionate people, our anger is as turbulent as the amount of care and concern we're capable of showing.  Keep that tranquil fury. As you get older, you'll cut down on the volume and loudness, which makes it better.  In your specific situation, I do believe you're old enough for the courts to take you seriously. Have a serious talk to your mom and step dad. It's time to fix your life, lad."

infj,3crp08,JustBeeNice,2,Fri Jul 10 17:04:46 2015 UTC,"Get some distance if you can, either by leaving to be with your mom or by keeping busy and out of the house. Learn anger management so you can focus that rage into something useful and learn other skills that will help you break the pattern you see besting the men of your family. I say this as someone who also had a parent with serious anger issues. As an INFJ you are emphatic and prone to rage. Don’t let his bad habits become yours. Don’t soak in his problems. This is the best way you can help him, yourself, any family you have in the future."

If I do this to much I get kind of depressed because I literally waste my time away living in my inner world/mind.

infj,3cp02k,Chewlip,2,Fri Jul 10 00:12:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, this, if I spend too much time in myself, I start feeling down and kind of guilty. Having a child has made me come out of that quite a lot. It's still something I make time for though, when she's in bed, or if I take her for the a walk in the stroller. If I don't have that time I do very badly. It's one of the reasons I often need a break from people."
infj,3cp02k,lzimmy,14,Fri Jul 10 05:06:18 2015 UTC,"Yep, I've always had an extremely active inner life that has been more than capable of keeping me constantly preoccupied with something. I'm either consciously thinking something through logically, having pretend conversations with people, imagining a variety of scenarios, wandering around way off in the future, or coming up with stories--which is basically just my default background process that my brain uses to sort through my subconscious feelings and ideas about things. When I'll finally tune in and pay attention to those it's like, ""huh, it's interesting that there's been a recurring theme these past two weeks, I wonder what I'm trying to tell myself?"" and then I can think that over using my more refined and conscious thought processes to determine what's going on.  After I figure it out, my brain moves on to other themes and issues.  This isn't even taking into account all the Ni outputs that pop up in terms of sudden new ideas and gut-level intuition and urges.   I like being able to retreat into my brain any time I want to. If something is externally boring, I can instantly zone out and have a wealth of amusements. The bad thing is that my body goes into auto-pilot while I do this and I'm often just staring off into space or doing some sort of repetitive task that doesn't need my full attention. I have to be careful though because it's not uncommon to make myself laugh and smile and then realize people can see me. It's always awkward when people ask what you're laughing about and there's no way to explain it without looking crazy."
infj,3cp02k,americanpharoah,4,Thu Jul 9 18:04:24 2015 UTC,That reminds me of being so bored at school and I would turn conversations with friends into these fantasies. They'd ask about what happened the day they were away and by the end the teacher had slapped the other teacher and this chain of crazy events had happened and the person listening would look at me like WTF?... I could have gone on for hours. It was like my imagination was constantly ready and waiting to turn the mundane into something exciting. Anything to escape the tedious maths lesson or whatever class it was.
infj,3cp02k,lzimmy,3,Thu Jul 9 18:20:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, taking something that has a very boring face value or purpose and then trying to squeeze all the meaning and imaginative uses out of it as you can is something I've always liked doing.  Friends would point out something mundane, and then I'd be like, ""...or! instead XYZ could have happened!"" and it's always something silly or absurd that would completely tickle me as a concept and they'd be pretty unimpressed.  It was great when I found those friends who would take those silly observations and inventions and either laugh, or then build off them too.  I've tried explaining the way my brain works to friends in the past and I've often been greeted with confusion.   I don't know how strictly literal and linear brains work and what that would be like. What do they do with all the extra space?! I might be drab and quiet on the outside, but my noggin is bursting with sound and color."
infj,3cp02k,americanpharoah,3,Thu Jul 9 18:34:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah I found one friend who could bounce off it and it when we were together it was so light and fun. When I was about 10 I remember getting 100% in creative writing because my stories were so crazy. But as you get older everything becomes serious and the opportunities to be creative diminish. Even so, that drive to create something is still there, to make a fantasy up out of nothing. Whenever small kids are around I enjoy it because they are so open to their imagination and they are a captive audience. I feel like part of me will always be 5 years old, and not all that interested in the dull parts of being an adult."
infj,3cp02k,lzimmy,5,Thu Jul 9 19:14:09 2015 UTC,"Definitely. I actually feel like I'm aging in reverse. I've always had that active imagination and was a fun-loving kid, but even when younger a part of me always enjoyed being worthy of responsibility (not that I always wanted the obligation of duty) and I made sure I acted ""properly"" in society; I could also be a bit shy. But that inner childish sense of wonder, exploration, and play is something I've never outgrown.  The only difference is now I just let it out a lot more and don't care if people don't get it.  The nice part is I now have the resources to have adventures on a global scale, and due to my ""maturity"" no one can complain about how I choose to spend my time and money. It's nice to finally get to indulge in that side freely :)  Also, I love playing with my nieces. It's a nice reminder. Although they will listen to me like an adult, they play with me like a kid; I think they recognize that part of me and enjoy when I let it out.  Although kids now are a lot less wild and free than when I was younger, or at least in the US they are. Everyone is so afraid about what might happen that they aren't allowed to wander and explore anymore. Parents are so overly concerned about potential injuries that they've limited their children from the activities that even they grew up with. There have been times where I've had to go, ""No girls, this is how you go down a slip-n-slide!!!"" and give them the permission to cut loose."
infj,3cp02k,americanpharoah,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:00:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have a nephew that I enjoy palling around with but his mother is a major helicopter parent which kind of takes the fun out of it. You can't get out the door without 6 questions about shoes and jackets and what you can and can't do. Part of the fun of life is running with bare feet and climbing a tree and scratching yourself, or getting covered in mud or freezing cold in the rain. That's how you know you're alive. There's a lot of fear and perfectionism in parenting these days, no one wants their kid to get hurt, or worse, they don't want to look like an irresponsible parent, so the kids end up sitting in their room playing the ipad all day. I grew up in a rural area and that risk taking and adventure was the highlight of that period. Take that away and you take away the joy of childhood. The times I had that freedom were the moments I realized I was in charge of my life and I had to take responsibility. Some of these kids will grow up feeling pretty powerless and missing a part of themselves."

Simply put, my teachers in HS would tell my parents that I don't talk at all.

One of my go-to's was to go through whole books that I knew really well (i.e. Harry Potter) in my head. One book would take me about 2 hours. It was great.

My inner world has always been my ‘safe place’ - somewhere I can retreat to whenever the external world is dissatisfying or becomes too much to handle.   I think it’s pretty awesome that we (although obviously not exclusively INFJs) have the ability to construct complex internal landscapes that can keep us entertained for minutes, if not hours, on end.  It only becomes a serious problem when it turns into ‘maladaptive daydreaming’ - when it starts having adverse effects on your day to day life and significantly replaces your participation in the external world as a form of escapism.  I have found that my daydreaming has significantly reduced now that I am busy with life and am actively seeking out experiences that excite/fulfil me. Nevertheless, it's still entertaining/comforting to retreat into my inner world every now and again."

INFJ as a whole tend not to be big romantic players. We are more like snipers. We don't take a shot at love often, but when do and we hit it's pretty epic. In the mean time we feel pretty lonely, isolated, alien. And some of those things will crop up now and then even if you have someone. Embrace  your weird and look for a woman who is willing to do the same. That will cut out a huge number of people, but it will be worth it when you find it. As far as a suggested route, get involved with things you are passionate about on a deep level. Things that challenge that part of you. The people you meet on that path are more likely to also be deep people."

infj,3cqfki,DopeGrandpa,5,Fri Jul 10 11:45:57 2015 UTC,"First of all, I'm sorry that you don't feel like anyone understands you; that's a very frustrating and sad place to be in, at least from my experience.    I think it's hard to be myself because there's always this fear that I'll be rejected or misunderstood. Although I think that's probably a fear for most people, regardless of MBTI type. More often than not, I don't act like myself around others because it's easier to act like them in order to make them feel comfortable and feel like I'm a part of a group, even if I know in my heart that I don't fit into that group. I don't know what route you should take, but I can tell you about mine so far. For a long time I felt very alone, and I didn't think I'd ever meet other people who are like me. I didn't feel like I fit in anywhere until I started volunteering at a sexual violence center in my city a couple years ago, where almost everyone I work with is either an INFJ or INFJ-compatible. This is the only area of my life where I feel myself being genuine with others and making real connections. So based on my experience, my suggestion is that you seek out other INFJs in your life. It's not as hard as you might think, but only if you're looking in the right places (disclaimer: obviously INFJs can exist and thrive anywhere, but I'm speaking generally)"

But there are many types of 'weird' - coming up with unique ideas that others couldn't possibly think of, getting naked in public, wearing underwear on your head, or having a peculiar hobby. Just make sure the thing you're being remembered for is beneficial towards how you want to be seen. Remember, perception is everything. ... On that note - Confidence is key to fucking everything.

infj,3crq5l,YogiJess,3,Fri Jul 10 06:12:21 2015 UTC,"That is really the tricky part about most decisions we will encounter throughout life. Everything is potentially a gamble, and the outcome of each choice may be to our liking, or perhaps it'll only be for awhile. It is not uncommon for some people to make career changes at different stages of their life. I think to put it in the most simple way, at least from my perspective, it depends on yourself and what you feel most comfortable with. How well do you do under pressure and in situations where life may offer many uncertainties? Are you prone to panicking or do you have enough composure to overcome most challenges.  Any adventure offer it's own set of challenges, and I'm sure some will advice you to go for one thing over the other, because it may offer more stability. It's difficult for any of us to guide you in the direction that is most suitable for you, because all paths can lead you to a life that will give you a deep meaning. On a completely personal note, I'd probably be drawn towards Psychology as I feel I could tend my cooking needs and curiosity better in my spare time, than vice versa. It all really depends where your heart is most at as well as what your mind feels would be best for you. Do you feel like there is a stronger pull with either, because that might be an indicator, although one doesn't really know until one tries. When we lack experience or knowledge with something, it is typically more difficult to make an estimate of what you'd be the most happy with.  Both choices sound interesting to me, but I have a natural curiosity for most things in this universe. Hopefully someone else can offer you more words of wisdom and perhaps it'll help you with a final decision. Life is too short to live with regrets, don't be afraid to choose ""wrong"", as even that can lead your life in the exact direction it needs to go. I'm content with what I'm doing, but I'm always looking at new options too. I want to enjoy life and my views and perspective on it may not be shared by many, but nor does it have to be. As long as I'm happy, then I really have nothing to complain about. Some of us thrive taking risks whereas others love to play it safe, a mix of both can yield really great results but again it all depends on the individual."

infj,3crq5l,shinbum,2,Fri Jul 10 10:14:44 2015 UTC,"One thing that helped me make the decision to go post secondary school was figuring out what I didn't want to do.  Out of high school I got a job at a saw mill. The pay was fantastic for someone with very little experience. The job was highly repetitious and predictable. My Co worker would tell me if I stuck around long enough I could eventually work on a piece of equipment (like a loader or something). That's when I realized that even the most desirable job that the saw mill was very repetitious and predictable. I could not see myself advancing in a career where every time you step up its just a different form of repetition. So I quit that job and went to college.  I would think back on jobs that you have had and find things you didn't like vs things you liked. You may love creating new dishes and flavors,  but not like having to work evenings and weekends. You might love listening and helping people, but not like being in a more office type environment.   I would say that you have the answer somewhere inside. It might take some time thinking about things but you will get there."
infj,3cr85q,yellowducky22,7,Fri Jul 10 03:12:21 2015 UTC,"There are several ways to go about seeing a therapist. If you are a college student or live near a college, there are usually free counseling centers on campus that offer therapy to its students as well as the community. These are usually done by students in a counseling program, but are always supervised by a licensed or doctorate level person.    If you have insurance through work or are on an insurance plan, there is usually a list provided that includes therapists/counselors from different disciplines (social work, counseling, psychology) that accept your insurance.   If neither of those are options, therapists in private practice often accept self-pay. Additionally, agencies or group practices often work on a sliding scale as well.   Therapy/counseling will be exactly what you want to talk about. Counselors listen to what you have to say. At times they will reflect what you say in a way that may not have been conscious to you before. At times they might provide feedback or insight as to what they are hearing you say. Therapists never force you to talk about anything you don't want to, though they might gently point out things that aren't always pleasant or comfortable. The therapist's main job is to do no harm and ensure you feel understood.   I have been to counseling before and I am a counselor, so that's where I'm coming from on this. This is a quick answer to your question, which deserves a lot more attention than I can give in a response on my iPhone. I encourage you to at least consider trying therapy. If you don't like it, or feel it's not for you, you don't have to keep going. Good luck!"
infj,3cr85q,andtherobots,5,Fri Jul 10 04:09:56 2015 UTC,"In my experience psychologists are very understanding with regards to compatibility. They're looking for a good connection as much as you are. It took 3 tries for me to find one that I got along with, I had to tell one that I wasn't comfortable, another told me that he wasn't sure we were going to make progress because of differing personalities (He broke up with me >:( ) but the person he suggested was perfect.   That said just find one and give them a call. They're there to help you and want you to be happy. In my experience it is totally worth it to call and just take it step by step from there."

I went to one who I think may have been a psychotherapist and she was trained in a specific type of therapy (EMDR) that was really crucial for me to feeling better. I also went to a counselor who didn't offer much feedback and just listened which I found frustrating because I wanted to discuss things with her. I think they key is to have an idea of what you want to get out of it and what you need."
infj,3cr85q,americanpharoah,2,Fri Jul 10 04:24:36 2015 UTC,"I'm a therapist myself and see one. You have to find who is right for you. Like others said, you can find someone through your insurance, psychology today, online, or even a referral from your pcp or school. I suggest clients to ask questions to their therapist to see if they're the right fit you. Each person wants different qualities. I prefer empathy, listening and allowing me to my own choices. I have learned that I don't do well with preachy, forceful types that may make insensitive comments (I have experienced this from a life coach). If someone doesn't feel right for you, it's okay to seek another therapist."

Like others have said, if you are in college, please please utilize your counseling center. That is how I was first introduced to counseling. If you are not in college, there are several community based counseling centers. You just need to do some research on your part. Usually it is on a sliding scale ( I am not sure if you have insurance).   I am letting you know though there ARE different styles of therapy. I am not sure what issues or problems you are looking for but some people view therapy as you come in every week and talk about your weekly problems. That is life coaching. Psychotherapy which is utilized for people who have a diagnosis of a mental illness is pretty structured."

I found her because I probably know 5 or 6 people in my real life who have gone to her at some point. She's expensive, so I don't go as much as I should, and has suggested I find a therapist on my insurance. The thought of talking to someone else and starting over again basically freaks me out though so I just get by with her. I don't suggest this lol.  Definitely also do not stick with someone who isn't helping you.

Similar in that the universe, spatially, curves in a 4th dimension that isn't perceived in our 3 dimensions. Time is something separate that is also perceived. These universes ""bubble"" in and out and can also split apart as the ratios of matter/darkmatter and dark energy (unknown concept that could source from many ideas but is perceived in our physical explanations for what we observe) shift around one another in their confined bubbles. Potentially more dimensions upwards and this is just another layer. Most likely infinite. Everything is duality and different expressions of dualities ratios to itself.

infj,3cpb2u,RBONES,2,Fri Jul 10 06:52:04 2015 UTC,"The majority of my thoughts are of this exact nature. For me, they are true and I live according to them (i.e. do as little harm as possible, be exceptional in all actions, even when they are awkward actions, or clumsy ones, because they will effect self and others somehow - butterfly effect style).  Some fun things I love to consider and roll around with:   Physical reality solely perception based. Brain as a highly evolved organic quantum computer and transceiver - thus all perceptions are instantaneous renderings of pure data/information. Infinite dimensions, not numbered or mapped. Think of it of being in a meadow. What you perceive as ‘the third dimension’ is the nearest blade of grass to you. You see it the most clearly. It is what your current physicality’s information construct is optimized for perceiving. When you dream, your mind is not making things up, you are just freeing yourself from certain physically optimized perception devices and entering a different set of perception devices - an auxiliary energy body if you will - and thus, the blades of grass which were on the other side of the field are now right in front of you. So you can see why there isn’t a ‘first blade of grass’ or a ‘third blade of grass’ but only blades of grass that are relative to where you find yourself as an observer and renderer of information. Prime method of travel is by thought. Infinite Multiverses, which themselves are infinite and contain infinite universes, which in themselves are also infinite. Because of the above, all infinite possibilities, lives, creations, etc exist, but not in one’s immediate perceptual vicinity. (i.e. ideas arrived fully formed to an artist - in a parallel ‘perceived future’ timeline, her creation already exists and her ‘perceived past’ - present - self picks up on what she has already created in the future, thus creating a slightly different parallel copy - this goes on forever in all parallel timelines exactly like a fractal. This is how things like remote viewing and intuition are possible. You travel across an information-scape of all possibilities and all existences in order to gain future, past or parallel present information. Since thought is boundless, there is no limit to what information you can gather. Your understanding is the only limitation (you can see only what you understand or what you open yourself to understanding). All of infinity is fractal (and holographic - a micro whole contained by a macro whole) by nature at its core - repetitions and variations on very rudimentary information. I like using the analogy of music for this - very basic frequencies (sine wave) representing physical manifestations of note information which are then manipulated into complex timbres - the note remains the same but it can be made to possess ever more complex harmonics. Infinite versions of self in all of the above (i.e. as a simple example, in an infinity of universes you are living my life and all infinite possible variants of it - right down to the infinitesimal minutia). Soul as an information construct - sizeless, weightless, formless, but self-aware. Consciousness = information that is fully self-aware. Can inhabit any form of life as well as experience the inanimate as living. Body solely as a vehicle for soul interaction - experience gathering and experience creation to add to already infinite novelty database that is Totality. Because information is sizeless, weightless, formless, etc; it implies that everything is based upon perception of information via rendering. Physical life = information rendering information, like a piece of graphics software (that itself is composed of information) rendering an output (a separate set of information rendered according to the rules of the software it was rendered by - you could view the graphics program as the optical segment of one’s brain, and the rendering as what one as a soul perceives). Everything, no matter how outlandish, is possible. Maybe not in this world or in this universe, but most certainly possible. For an infinity to exist, this is an absolute must. There are likely worlds and universes which could see our world as entirely implausible. There is infinite life right from the most infinitesimal speck of a single cell, to the most amazing, elegant and complex of intelligent life. In all of this infinite life there is life that is infinitely more intelligent than us, and infinitely less. Any form of life you can imagine exists somewhere/somewhen/somehow/somewhy etc. Everything that ever is, was, and will be, happens and exists for a reason - even things which seem like they cannot possibly occur or exist for any useful reason. Because of cause and effect, we are effected by everything, everywhere, everywhen, and so on… We are all the universe’s own computations, experiencing its own computations - forever. Even if we cease to exist, at some point, somewhere, we shall exist again. Anything linear is only linear because it is perceived as such. In information land, everything exists and is happening all at once, in a single infinite instance (this is why I chuckle when I hear people speaking of the ‘arrival’ of a singularity, when it is all that ever has been! The only arrival as such, is the overall population’s eventual united perception that not only everything is tied to everything but everything is everything and everyone is everyone else). Systems of any sort change as spiral like oscillations (history repeating itself but never quite the same each time around because of lessons learned, information successfully acquired and assimilated, etc). States of noise/chaos indicate major change is occurring as old systems decay and new systems evolve from feedback patterns that evolve from the resulting noise of said decay. (This applies to micro, macro and all in between, within and without - breakdowns lead to breakthroughs style, on the scale of Totality). This is always happening, and it is sort of what Terence McKenna picked up on with Timewave Zero, however it’s not something that occurs in a static linear manner like that, rather it is always happening, more like interlocking, superimposed, bubbles with cascading cause and effect that reverberates in all infinite ‘directions’ of what is perceived as time. To elaborate on the holographic nature of Totality - the whole is available within all that it contains. This implies that everything that can be known is already within you and learning is a process of becoming aware of those things through seeing them reflected in what you perceive - a simple example being seeing something in a book that you find incredibly uncanny. The ‘assimilation’ of learning that knowledge is really just you activating your connection to knowledge already present within.   I could go on and on and on… perhaps it’s all just the ramblings of a crazy dreamer… or perhaps there is something to it ;)"

infj,3cpb2u,DUTCH_M0NEY,2,Tue Jul 14 18:33:17 2015 UTC,"My big theory:  The universe organizes itself according to fractal patterns, each one iterating on a scale so vast and so tiny we can hardly conceive of more than one level in either direction.    Life exists to develop into new universes, evolving over time until intelligence takes over from chaos and chance.  At some point, life learns to reverse entropy, effectively creating a 'Big Bang' and a new universe for itself.    We'll live as gods in the aether, floating between existences.    I see that happening within the next thousand years, assuming we live that long.  Some of those of us alive today might actually manage it."

Now days, the ""big bang"" is believed to be more of  a ""big bounce"", and forgive me if I'm wrong here, but I believe modern theories say that universes expand to a certain extent and then snaps back all at once, where it ""bounces"" and creates another big bang, and somewhere in there there's talk about the generation of multiple new universes at this point."

(might have mistyped something here)  c) Bio genesis some kind of rock and living off sun.   d) Fractals all, systems, things, products, living or non have same pattern in one way or another in some form or another, although like mbti etc it can look different but may also have some what different or similar means to an end, maybe mbti is not a good example.  e) Something about quantum mechanics, double slit experiment, when one observe it changes behaviour has to do with some other dimension or something heh.   f) Something related to Conway's theory game of life or related  g) or some other things that humans don't usually comprehend, systems, plants, universe/galaxy  h) also as some from elsewhere talked of species survival, like as sun goes away will need a some other planet then another galaxy, and so fourth then some say me may need to create a big bang as this one may go as well heh.  i) also yeah there's the singularity thing or that humans and genetics, nano tech, and cyborg may interchange or adapt in different ways, as time goes on (as with anything) things adapt or things becomes possible.  j) I'm not saying the bible does not have good wisdom (multiple meanings. analogies etc and age old lessons from time/and many witness, experience or writers) or not important but on in the realm of theories and equations, forgot as few theory related on it universe may come from nothing as ""nothing"" isn't really ""nothing"" and the quantum's, and quantum fluctuation, also there some paper on it that had 10 somewhat equations and proofs of things coming out of nothing and universe, if you think about nothing and this universe both can be a strong force if looked at the grand scale and the pressures it can achieve. and some more things that I didn't add yet.  Sorry very vague and not really explained at the moment. Maybe some others I erased not sure but may know later.  edit 2: few things also my last part, ""J)""   edit 3: about bible writing or somethings.  edit 4: On a side note.

infj,3coyjm,americanpharoah,5,Thu Jul 9 17:56:52 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing for me is work environment.  I need to be working for a place that places values on their customers and employees.  Pretty much all companies say that they do, but almost none walk the walk along with talking the talk.  I recently took a position at a non-profit, and it's honestly the best thing that's happened to me in terms of career satisfaction.  The money that the company makes goes right back in to things to help their customers, employees and the local community--not to line the pockets of the CEO.  The company I work for also does a ton of charity work and fundraising, and everyone, from the C-level down to customer service assistants, has paid days off every year to go volunteer at a charity of their choosing.  In regards to being managed, autonomy is huge for me.  I am most productive when I have a manager that allows me to work at my own best pace, and in my own best way.  I do my best work in small, intense bursts of activity--I'll hyperfocus for two hours straight and get done a solid morning's work.  Then I'll need to break it up a bit, go for a walk or have a chat and clear my head from what I was just doing, then I can go back to it again for another two to three hours.  If I'm clock-watched and forced to be plodding through something for eight straight hours, I wilt--productivity halts, my brain gets tired and I dig my heels in.  I'll actually get less work done in eight hours with someone watching over my shoulder than I will in five hours going at my own pace.  With regards to the job itself, my main necessity is I need to constantly be learning and solving puzzles creatively.  I get bored really quickly, and if I have to repeat the same mindless task over and over, I'll get really irritated because I see no point.  I used to really piss off my teachers in school because I never did homework, because I saw no point to it when I'd learned what I needed to know in the classroom.  The only homework I'd do was things like book reports, because it was interesting to me to dissect a story and write about it; it was analysis and interpretation, not just mindless repeating of information.  My grades suffered because of it (I would get high marks on all my tests, but get mediocre grades for the course because 60% of my grade was homework), and as an adult I know you can't just not do the pointless work--but if I have to do it, I'll be annoyed and quickly demotivated.  TL;DR:  There are three key ingredients for me.  I need a work environment that matches my values and places people above profit, I need a manager who allows me freedom to do things my own way and at my own pace, and I need a job that allows me to constantly learn and solve puzzles in creative ways."

infj,3coyjm,lookforlinda,2,Thu Jul 9 21:40:35 2015 UTC,"I couldn't answer this question until I read a book called Drive by Daniel Pink. It's a wonderful read about what (he considers) truly motivates us at work and how most professional environments get it wrong. It really resonated with me.   He proposes 3 elements to have a happy work life: autonomy, mastery and purpose. Having the autonomy to own your work and be responsible for it. Having the sense of getting better at something / developing a skill. And doing something for a reason. Not necessarily an altruistic reason, but having the feeling what you do matters and fits in a grander scheme of things.   My perspective of my work drastically changed after reading the book. I realised I needed autonomy in my job because I could be ""difficult"" and didn't respond well to micromanagement. I would bore easily if I didn't get the sense I was developing a skill and getting better at something. And (probably most importantly) the work I was doing had to mean something (according to my own values) otherwise I would get disillusioned with what I did.  So I quit my job and ever since use these metrics when considering new work options.   IMO it leans itself to working for yourself (a goal of mine) but this is a big step and a scary one!  Anyway highly recommend the book if you're struggling to find motivation with what you do."

It's unfortunate, but it gets easier to accept and see past once you understand how your functional stack influences the way you see the world.   EDIT: A bit late but I just noticed the second part to your questions. I've always let finding someone just happen, I rarely, if ever, go after someone, unless my gut tells me to go for it. I've learned to sense attraction (eye contact, body language, tone of voice, etc) but even that can be unreliable. Still, the key to me has been to be open to forming a bond whenever and wherever possible, without intention. Let things develop as they will, and if either party sees potential, something will come of it. Building a strong foundation of self esteem, confidence, and personal development will take you far - focus on that and embracing others openly and it'll all fall into place. :)"

I have only been in one relationship, and that woman, also an INFJ, approached me. She knew of my love of literature and hiking, and was brave enough to chase that. We hit off really good, and were happy for a long time. Unfortunately it came to a bittersweet end, and we have both been single thereafter, remaining good friends.

You can join MeetUp groups, there are some for introverts and I bet for artists as well. Then look for the quiet girl sitting alone. Be the one to make her day by smiling at her, then maybe talking to her. Ask her how she came to join this group, ask her how she likes the group, etc. Ask if she has other groups she's in as well. Then maybe ask her out for coffee or ice cream or something like that. Ask, ""What's your favorite coffee drink?"" and let that be the opener to asking her to have one with you.   If you go out with her, ask her questions about herself. What does she do, what are her hobbies, favorite movies, does she have pets, etc., etc. Asking questions is pretty easy and people love to be asked things about themselves. :-)  Maybe not the advice you were looking for, but being a woman I thought of things that would have attracted me."

I felt different from other men mainly because I didn't engage in a ton of masculine activities.. I mean, I played soccer but that was practically the extent of it all. I wouldn't even call soccer masculine compared to football.  Just a social norm that's been hammered into my head.  I recently found out I'm INFJ, along tied with ISFJ qualities, it's truly an inner battle..  But I had no idea of these concepts when I was younger, let alone a year ago... So my differences that made me who I am, such as reading, writing, and plunging into deep philosophies and analogies, etc. made me feel extremely insecure about myself.. So I suppressed a lot of my ideas in the universe I call my brain. I had a very hard time relating to other guys.. Even to my best friend, who I've known all my life.  In regards to relationships.. I've had quite a few.. And I think that's because I was trying to fill in the empty hole in my chest that grew bigger and bigger through suppressing who I really am. Every single one of them ended terribly...  So I'm at that point where idgaf about a relationship.. Idgaf about sex.. I just want someone who I can lean on and someone who can lean on me... A true companion.. Because my ISFJ longs for that connection... Very conflicting.  I just let life unfold it's course. So far, I've been introduced to an INFJ girl who actually gets me.. We can talk for hours about anything and everything.. It's very relieving and I've never felt this free before (excuse the sappiness lol)  I really feel for you bro.. I too expressed myself with drawing and painting as a child.. And I got picked on a lot by it, also. I've always wanted to become a father and husband.. So I totally get that desire.

infj,3cnnsc,duncanatwork,2,Thu Jul 9 14:01:06 2015 UTC,"Felt different from other guys for being fairly sensitive. Also for the fact that I seem to get along better, quicker and easier with women than men.   Found my wife through reddit. Put up an r4r ad after moving to a new place. She responded. We were FWBs for a year, I had not only strong feelings for her, but my brain was randomly blurting out, 'I could love this woman', 'I could marry this woman', and I want to provide for this woman. Figured she would never feel the same for me so I held those feelings back. She told me she was attached. Year later we are now married. She's an ENFP, by the way. Amazing woman."

Just curious.  1 - I am the only INFJ in my community. I am treated like a lunatic almost every day. I feel very different especially when the other guys try to drift their true emotions to anger and silence, when I would actually cry about it and think deeply about a particular situation. I also feel very different when we all listen to a particular song or watch a movie and I'm the only one who is so disturbed by the depressing tone and plot.  2 - If you're talking about an intimate, significant other, then that's TBA."
infj,3cnnsc,DeadMage,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:38:02 2015 UTC,"INFJ male here, also 20 years old.  If you're just starting to learn about MBTI, please take the time to make sure you're not an INFP, which commonly mistypes as INFJ. (I say this to everybody)  1-  Growing up, I felt different than other guys for two reasons:  A) I felt I was more sensitive and emotional than others, or at least more kind.  B) I felt like I was on a different intellectual level; I had a better understanding of how the world work and I was just generally more aware of the big picture.  2-  Ok. Stop. Being an introverted type is not an excuse to be asocial or a crippling character trait. You should be embarrassed of joining the ""DAE too introverted?!"" circlejerk. The INFJ is ""the most extraverted introvert"" and has functions that are extremely useful in relating to other people and developing relationships.  As an answer your question, I've met a number of girls who I have had a genuine connection with. The trick is to keep yourself open to opportunity and to never abandon a romantic pursuit just because you're unsure. Take risks and put yourself out there.  I suggest OKCupid for online dating to meet people."

It takes a lot of work to develop a good profile and learn how to craft a good first message, and at times it may feel like a waste of time and effort, but you'll never catch a fish if you don't cast your line.  I feel like I've reached a point where I at least have a functional understanding of the trade, so to speak.

I would listen to some artists that inspire you, think about whatever puts you in the mood of the pieces you are performing so that you can totally fully go there when it is time. IMO it is all about being in the right headspace. Your body will follow naturally.    Do not be afraid to tell the person working the board how you want it to sound of it doesn't feel right to you.

Also a tv presenter was talking yesterday about how it's ok to be 'good enough', we in society and especially INFJ's are prone to perfectionism and become obsessed with getting it just perfect. Sometimes when you focus on just being good enough you relax and actually perform better. Gratitude is also helpful, write out a list of things you are grateful for and it can kind of ground you and reduce the pressure of feeling like this is make or break. Finally, look up some breathing exercises. Even a few deep breathes to the bottom of your stomach (lots of people do it wrong so take a minute to read up) can really relax your whole body and make you present rather than in your head obsessing.

My sister's reaction to the abuse was very different (and her reaction shaped what she experienced). She is ESFJ, which seems consistent with her approach of placation, putting on a mask, and trying to create harmony, often at her own expense. She actively cultivated a place in the family dynamic.  My reaction was to withdraw into an inner world of fantasy and in particular, philosophical reflection, take refuge in introversion, and despite getting the brunt of the abuse (because I was not cooperative and would not play along with the false reality created), I could not make myself say the sky was green if I saw it was blue. So my attitude was - right is right, and if I am going down, I will go down in FLAAAAAAAAMES!!  I definitely think those early experiences of injustice and abuse have intensified my awareness of injustice, my lack of tolerance for it, and my willingness to be destroyed rather than play along. It has actually worked to my advantage in some serious ways in my life and has probably saved my life, but the truth is, I don't really feel I have a choice because I have no desire to put up with the crap I was forced to tolerate in my childhood.  How has it affected you? On a personal note, I am sorry that you had a shitty start and am sending you a hug and a high five as a fellow survivor and especially INFJ survivor."

From here this acts like a funnel where I will find what is useful or important to me. By this time I will have probably seen another image from Se and I repeat the process until I have enough information to be motivated to action or to complete a picture of reality.

Stop making judgment, and start feeling what could happen or what could have happened. It's also preparing to both the likely and the unlikely. Inconscious Ni is the gut feeling. Feeling like you won't like something, or that you WILL like something, as well as natural ability to anticipate future dangers. Many times I use Ni to make hypotesis at absurd. Absurd doesn't mean impossibile, only very a matter of likely and unlikely.  The main concept behind it, is that things and people many times aren't as they seem, and there could be something behind it."

Lol  Or when we used to go fishing, he would bring this random girl from the neighbourhood, and they'd be fooling around right next to me. Then he'd call my name to get me to look over at them.  Awkward!  I think I was like 16 then, and they were 18ish.  I stoically kept fishing lol.  When he rang the doorbell and I opened the door, often the first thing he did was twist my nipple.  My uncle is an ESTP too. He was cool. Owned a lot of pinball machines, him and his wife restored them and sold them again. Pretty fun growing up around."

Maybe it's just my sensitivity, but she has this really blunt arrogance but does it in a sweet way so that people think she's ""refreshing"" whereas I just find it obnoxious.

He smokes copious amounts of weed on the daily, and is really into bikes and works as a bike mechanic in a local shop (in fact he's at bike mechanic school out of state right now). He's pretty cocky and finds sexual humor in conversation fun. He's also very business and money-minded. In all he's a good natured dude but he's ALWAYS on the move or doing SOMETHING. He has spoken about his past to me before, but I'll keep that to myself. Suffice to say he is much less reckless than he used to be. Which I can see because within his impulsiveness/short sightedness is a plan. He acts on things very quickly.  He and I get along very well because we share the same functions but in reverse."

Very business-oriented, fast-paced, and loves setting goals and meeting them. I think the general impression we get, at least through these online forums, is that ESTPs are flighty, action-oriented, risky, etc. Although I see those qualities, my ESTP cousin is actually well grounded and well respected at her work. I think the environment in which they grow up has a huge influence, especially for personalities like ESTPs.   The other ESTPs I know, who are men, are also very highly achieved and career-focused. They can be fun and kid-like when they're off the pressure, though. I actually enjoy their presence as long as they're not getting mad. (Then... it's scary.)"
infj,3cj09t,Intempestivity,2,Thu Jul 9 06:13:01 2015 UTC,"I've known two ESTPs; one unhealthy, one healthy.  Both were former colleagues.  Both were cocky and very salesman-like.  The healthy one exuded a great energy, could be a bit intense, but overall was a decent chap.  He would not hesitate to round up twenty people for beers after work if he was having a bad day or had something to celebrate, although he never stopped to think about the impact he would have on others.  I could only deal with him in small doses, but he was all right in said doses.  The unhealthy one was a clinical narcissist.  I truly hated him--once I got to know him.  When I first met him, I thought he was a nice bloke; he was very involved in his community and would often talk about his girlfriend's kids whom he had helped raise from a young age.  He would goof off a lot and had a terrible tendency to turn any conversation in to something about himself, which was annoying, but it was only after knowing him for six months that I saw the truly toxic side come out.  He would use that charm of his to manipulate anyone to get what he wanted.  He was incredibly selfish, and that cockiness would turn in to pure arrogance when he was talking to people for extended lengths of time--he looked down on everyone.  He lied, all the time, about everything, to the point where he couldn't keep track of his lies and people caught him out--and when he was confronted with that, he'd lie some more and try to gaslight the person confronting him (""I have no idea what you're talking about, I never said that"").  He didn't handle any sort of confrontation well, actually.  If he couldn't lie his way out of it, he turned in to a sullen child and stared at the floor, refusing to answer simple questions.  He treated his girlfriend like absolute shit.  Her mother died, and after a couple of days he left her home alone because he ""couldn't deal with it"" and ""needed to go out with the boys for some normality.""  He lied to his girlfriend all the time, telling her that he was sleeping off a hangover at a friend's house when really he was out at a football game, or that he had to stay late for work or was at the gym when he was out drinking with his friends.  He thought these were funny stories and would share them in the office, and he didn't understand why no one else found it funny.  He constantly made fun of his girlfriend, too, and thought it was the most hilarious thing in the world to scare her to the point of tears.  He was also a sexist asshole.  ""Women don't want to work full time, they want to have kids and families.""  He'd try to couch his sexism as being family-oriented, but if you tried to bring up any viewpoint that differed from his (""Maybe some women aren't interested in raising families and are more satisfied with a succesful career""), he'd get even more sexist (""Well, they're not really great women then, are they?"").  On top of that, he used Se so heavily that he was obsessed with anything material.  Designer jeans?  Gotta have them.  Hipster glasses are in?  He'd buy frames with plain glass lenses just to get the look.  Latest tech?  It's totally on his desk to try to get people to ask questions.  This obsession led him and his girlfriend in to huge amount of debt--they had to triple mortgage their house AND get loans in order to pay off their outstanding credit on their cards.  Se also drove him to overindulge with food--he put on a good twenty pounds every year I knew him.  And Se combined with loose morals resulted in him hitting on anything female within a hundred foot radius.  On a work night out, a bunch of us went to see the Rocky Horror Picture Show, and hit up a local club after for a drink or two.  At said club, after not even half a pint, he was stumbling around like he was ""drunk"" and groping women's chests and bottoms.  ""Oops, sorry, I'm so tipsy right now, haha!""  No, he wasn't.  I was watching him on the sidelines the whole time.  He also was slimy to women who would give him rides home after going down to the pub after work.  Several women refused to give him rides after the first time they offered, and when asked why, it was because he would hit on them in the car, or ""accidentally"" brush their legs and when they looked over at him, he'd be grinning.  I'm sure if anyone would have given him a chance, he'd have cheated on his girlfriend in a heartbeat.  TL;DR:  I've known ESTPs.  I find them intense, and can only take the healthy ones in small doses.  Unhealthy ESTPs are essentially narcissists and are toxic."
infj,3chgt2,anonymous22353,41,Tue Jul 7 23:04:00 2015 UTC,"I used to feel the exact same way growing up, I'm a 23 male right now btw. I wanted a girlfriend badly starting in middle school, but I was always self conscious about my pizza face, growing up in a poor family, and my family's messy lifestyle (small case of hoarding). I never pursued anyone in high school except asking a girl out for prom, which was a no and I was devastated. Went to uni for two years flirted with a few girls, had a couple dates but never even got a kiss. Joined the military after and since being at my first base, dated two girls short-term and had a long term relationship with a very special girl. Sadly that ended almost 5 months ago. What I've learned is love finds you when youre at your highest point. I experienced everything with this woman, first kiss, first dance, first bj, sex, all that good stuff. I can safely say I loved her but we were incompatible for a future life (issues with religious preferences). My best advice is stop trying to look for a girlfriend, but start talking to them as friends. Look for opportunities to make new friendships. That may spawn as a relationship, or hell, they may have a mutual friend that finds you attractive. Putting women on a pedestal isn't healthy for a social life and you lose out on a lot of good friendships. Sorry if that was long-winded but your story host home for me"
infj,3chgt2,Aztoniish,5,Tue Jul 7 23:49:46 2015 UTC,This is very solid advice. I'm a 24m and I have had that problem my whole adult life. Putting women on pedestals literally ruins you're chances.. because you live inside you're head. Once a girl on a pedestal you literally cant get to her. You're to scared to talk to her as a person. Once you combine this with a yearning for a deep and intense connection us INFJ's tend to have... you have a cocktail for loneliness on you're hands!

infj,3chgt2,MemoriesOfSelf,8,Wed Jul 8 11:49:30 2015 UTC,"30-something/M INFJ here. Lots of spot on advice in the replies here already.  I would also encourage you to find a different perspective your situation. If you're anything like me, I think what you're seeking is a little bit more primal and basic than simply wanting a girlfriend. I think what you're seeking is connection, and I think realizing that can be incredibly empowering.  Connection can come in different forms: emotional, intellectual, physical, spiritual; each isn't more or less valid, as humans we will need all of these to varying degrees. Having a relationship can certainly satisfy some of these, but it won't be and shouldn't be the be-all and end-all of meeting all of your needs for connection.   My advice would be to seek any and all of these out. So no, don't stop looking for a girlfriend, but perhaps instead place priority on making connections with the females you meet, even if only platonic, or temporary, or occasional; whether it's someone you say hi to at the gym regularly, or in my case, some rather attractive women I have the pleasure of dancing with in my class. As far as hooking up is concerned, certainly that counts as physical connection, but not much else than that, and I suspect most people in this /r wouldn't find that terribly satisfying in the long run. I think finding as many sources of connection will take the edge off of not having a girlfriend as well. So seek out activities you like that can allow you the opportunities to make more connections. Building that trust that we need, which is going to be so crucial for any long-term relationship, is a time consuming project and we need to start with any of these small sparks of connection we find anywhere in our lives, lighting the dark path."
infj,3chgt2,drukq,7,Wed Jul 8 04:52:51 2015 UTC,"I can relate to this! I was not really into the idea of dating throughout high school and the first three years of college. Hookups were a big turn off, despite it being what college students are supposed to do. It also probably didn't help that I was in the closet, so I basically just didn't do anything relating to love.  Then senior year it just hit me: I want a boyfriend. I want to try being a couple with someone. I didn't want to hookup. What I did was use OKCupid. It took some time and a lot of answering questions, but it worked and now I'm part of the dating world! I've met wonderful people, and while there is heart break, I've found it all to be worth it when you find an amazing person >/////<  My advise is to not compromise on your ideals. Don't listen to everyone that implies you need to go hookup. There are people out here who don't do that. Also, take the time and go slow. Be sure you are confident in what you want from life before you try to find a match. Trust your gut and get to know people. Eventually you'll find a very nice person to go out with :)"

infj,3chgt2,BananaJuice1,5,Wed Jul 8 10:29:25 2015 UTC,"23-F-INFJ - It is intimidating to focus on a monumental task like finding someone you can develop a romantic relationship with. Try taking small steps towards this goal. You have no chance in finding a girlfriend if you don't even talk to girls. That is step one.   Here are some tricks I have used:   Try talking to a girl in class or try to partner up with girls during assignments. Try to have a conversation while leaving the classroom so it seems natural to walk out of class together. Ask where they are headed next and say you are going in the same direction to continue the conversation. Ask to work with them outside of class on a project or homework for the class you share.  Ask girls in class/club meetings if they are going to an event on campus and, if they say yes, suggest meeting up there since you are both already going anyway. Try to go to events like those alone and talk to girls who are by themselves too.  Introduce yourself to your neighbors (if they are girls) by apologizing for your noisy roommate, asking if they have a lighter, asking if they would like a box of cookies leftover from your bake sale, etc. Say ""Hello"" in the hallway and try to do your laundry/wait for the bus/walk to school/etc. at the same time as they do and start conversations.  If you have any close friends that have girlfriends ask for their help or if they have any nice friends they think you may get along with.  Join clubs and attend meetings!    From there you will develop friendships with girls over time and, once you truly get to know them, you can determine whether they could be suitable romantic partners for you. From there just be honest about your feelings and hope she feels the same.  Hope this helps! Good luck!"
infj,3chgt2,Juliptherabbit,6,Wed Jul 8 03:42:06 2015 UTC,"Hit the gym (helps with attractiveness and confidence) and in parallel drill into yourself the very true assumption that  25% of the girls you see in any location would love to have a friendly chat. They don't want to be hit on but they do want to be entertained. Stop looking for a girlfriend in the selfish sense. Make yourself awesome and spend a little courage trying to make girls who you might be interested in a little more happy, 30 seconds at a time. Smile more even if you don't get a smile in response."
infj,3chgt2,m1sta,3,Wed Jul 8 08:28:26 2015 UTC,"Probably the best advice on this thread. Forget the girlfriend goal and just focus one step at a time, reaching out and talking to girls. Get to know them. Be friends with them. Take interest in what they do. Then if there is a romantic spark, let it come, but don't make the goal of getting a girlfriend your driving factor when talking to ladies, we'll pick up on that, and it can be a bit off putting.  Some will say but that's how you get friend zoned! If you're friend zoned, its because the girl never saw you as a potential boyfriend/mate/SO whatever. So if that happens, move onto the next one, don't get stuck in that trap too long.  Anyways, just focus on making friends with them and if anything else comes of it, and you're interested, then that's when you should focus on the girlfriend goal. But don't jump to point Z without going through A thru Y first.  Good luck! :)"

The local OKcupid scene is pretty bad. No mutual friends with any single friends (at least none they wanna set me up with). I'm pretty worried I  won't meet anyone. I REALLY want a family and all that jazz. I know I'm only 23, but I have no experience, and I was just really hoping to have met someone at this point in my life.    For advice: Just put yourself out there. You don't want to end up in the position I'm in. I x1000 regret that I never acted on any feelings I had for anyone or that I never just talked to any cute girls I had an interest in. I would tell myself ""I'll talk to her tomorrow.""

infj,3chgt2,sebneversleeps,4,Wed Jul 8 03:58:31 2015 UTC,"oh god..that feeling.. i am almost 34 now and, by the grace of (god/really dumbfucking luck) am just recently married (tho not sure how things will turn out.. we both kinda just plunged into it, from worlds apart i.e. across an ocean).    like you, i was far too shy to ever make a move, didn't even try until the last few months of my college life, and while that worked out briefly (also through dumb luck), i didn't have a real girlfriend until i hit 31 (through okcupid), which was awesome.    thinking back on college, if i could do it again.. i'd probably still be too shy.  i am inept at small talk.  i would advise me old self to 'just do it man!' but i know in the 'moment' my mind would be blank, as it most often is.  i dunno, maybe it helps to just realize that everything (like everything in this universe/existence) is kinda bullshit and well, you might as well just fuck it and go all out.  i doubt it would have helped my old reclusive self without living the office worker life for 10+ years but anyway.. just can't reiterate enough how bullshit all existence kind of is and how retarded (sorry if this offends) our feelings of apprehension about talking to the opposite sex can be.    in the long term, a few of the things that helped me were (this is not going to be terribly pleasant but, just sharing my experience):   chat cam sites (i know, yeah, sad, i probably spent a few thousand on chat cam sites over several years) talking to girls while doing my 'kinks', and getting positive response for being so 'sweet'.  it helped a lot to think that, well maybe there are nice attractive girls out there who, at some level, do appreciate a nice sweet guy even though, nice guys finish last as redpill would ram down our throat. getting involved with anyone, attractive or not, if they seem to be friendly and good natured.  yes, i feel like i used someone, i still feel guilty about it, i must have been a terrible person. but anyway, i know that while we were involved (it was through Okcupid) we shared a tenderness and sweetness that was a breath of hope in a long lonely life.  i hope she's doing well.  man.  anyway, it really helped to gain some confidence, have some hope that in spite of being a 'bore' and a 'pussy' as some might put it, there are people with whom i can connect.   as i got older i just kinda came to accept there's a high probability i'll be alone for the rest of my life and i might as well just fuck it and enjoy what (healthy constructive) pursuits in life that i can.  this release of the desperation to become involved helped, to a degree, with the anxiety of talking to females.  what does it matter, when i'm prepared to die alone?  might as well just enjoy what little moments i have, right?     my advice is horrible.  only got married because well, i got lucky as shit (or maybe not, still don't quite know how it's going to go down).  OK cupid was a painful exercise in silent rejection but on occasion got to go on dates and have a nice time.  got a lot more 'responses' (relatively) when i became more open and honest on my profile, which i think infjs are good at.  the advertisement of positive self is so clearly fake but if you can meld the good and bad of your life, women really did respond to that in a better way.  all this goes back to (for me), embracing a love for life on my own terms and embracing the fact that i could be alone for life.    i got married to a person who i met through work-travel many years ago. we were both lonely and (slightly, me more than her) oddball people, and somehow we fell in love and decided to try to make a life together in spite of her not being from the USA (doing the immigration process).  if there's any bit of advice i can really say worked, it is to remain in tune with life as a whole (photography, pursuit of learning about music were my main methods), keep a sense of movement/evolution/storyline going regardless of the sadness (i remember crying in sadness of loneliness in my room scarcely a year and half ago..man), life keeps going, you gotta keep trucking.. some people seem destined for a life of pain but that doesn't mean it will necessarily last a lifetime.  the women who you will be able to connect with, will love the tenderness of your heart with their whole being, and that feeling is just.. so sweet it makes all the pain OK"

Then almost out of pure fluke I met a girl that later became my wife.  After I was with her for awhile I didn't have those thoughts of missing out on girlfriends in my late teens/early 20s.

And I mean that in terms of self-improvement because you're probably an awesome person. Try new things, spend time with yourself, and don't see having a girlfriend as a goal. I've never been in a relationship but from what I've seen from my guy friends; hook up culture leaves them worse off than if they just took advantage of being single. I've also noticed that a good majority of people in relationships aren't ready for them. You do you."
infj,3ci4as,shinbum,9,Wed Jul 8 02:15:59 2015 UTC,"You want a very introspective look on love? Read 'the road less travelled' by M. Scott Peck. It's an amazing book that really sorts out all the ways of looking at love, and what real love actually is. I'm reading it right now and am having a wonderful time, though it is an intellectual challenge.  That being said, I'm infinitely more comfortable and able to GIVE love than receive love. I feel this is because I am aware of the effort and time I am giving to what I am loving, and I am sure of its importance to me.  I understand here that the love that I give is truly love because it requires enormous effort, suffering, and vulnerability. Luckily, true loving is always a path that leads to growth, even if it accompanies pain. And that is love as my heart sees it. I love conservation and the natural sciences. I love my closest friends who know of my hardest times. I love one woman. There are many other facets in my life that I care greatly about, but these are what I love. I have the will to love them, because love is not a feeling but an act of will and courage.  Do I like receiving love? I would say so. A dark side of me has received love before, but never sees it because I do not believe I am capable of being loved. I have to constantly fight this inner demon. Is that receiving love or loving myself? Both? Or something else entirely?"

infj,3chh3k,shinbum,7,Tue Jul 7 23:06:24 2015 UTC,"I have a girl friend from back home who's like a little sister to me. I think INFJ's tend to be very protective and loyal to those who are close to us, and shit started to hit the fan for me when she started to get really close to this other guy. It seemed that every few weeks there would be some new story about how this guy was emotionally manipulative. Again and again though, she would find some reason to justify it because she really liked him. I was friends with the guy, so I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt, and left it up to the girl to figure things out. Yet every single time I heard about this, my mind just got stuck on it until I became emotionally drained because I knew how it would end. Finally, come this one day, the girl and I are talking and she starts telling me about how this guy has been talking up a second girl, and my friend starts crying.  When I heard that, I snapped and it felt like someone just turned the thermostat way down in me. Now, I've been angry before with a very ""hot"" feeling, if that makes sense. But this, this rage was cold. Felt like the lights just all went out in me and on the surface I had a cool calm demeanor.  What happened afterwards isn't really important to the point, though it wasn't fun. I let loose on this guy in a way that was so atypical of me, and it was like I was deaf to anybody who wanted to reason with me. Needless to say, guy and I aren't friends anymore, and it's been something I deeply regretted because of how much I upset my friend. I definitely should not have acted out, but the cold rage got the better of me. But I've never regretted my protectiveness, because to see one of my friends so deeply hurt broke me in a new way that day."
infj,3chh3k,augustusprime,2,Wed Jul 8 04:12:19 2015 UTC,"I know the cold rage you speak of.  There's been a couple of times when I've wanted to go apeshit in defense of a friend or family member, but because of logistical reasons I physically couldn't.  I'm going to say that's a good thing in the long run."
infj,3chh3k,Intempestivity,6,Thu Jul 9 07:12:32 2015 UTC,"Considering we tend to respect and empathize with the emotions of others, this makes total sense to me that you ""snapped"" in response to someone taking advantage of your emotions and disrespecting them after you trusted him with this secret you had. I think you did the right thing. We have the tendency to let people trample over us with these issues, and you built up the courage to set the record straight!   Personally, I haven't ""snapped"" yet. I almost did but I really chickened out. Long story short, I was bullied relentlessly by some girls I lived with. I chose to be the bigger person and ignore them, which was probably the better decision, but sometimes I really wish I would have freaked out and showed them I wasn't anyone to mess with."

One was the first person with whom I became close freshman year of college. She liked a mutual friend of ours, she confessed her feelings to him, and he politely let her down. Then she did it again, and he handled the situation very gently a second time. When she told me she was thinking of expressing how she felt a third time (because she just kept getting ""mixed signals""), I verbally exploded on her. This was 12 years ago so I can't remember what I said anymore but I know I felt terrible immediately and I still feel embarrassed when I think about it. She sat there stunned for a second and then got up and left the room. I must have apologized because we remained friends for another year until we were supposed to get an apartment with said guy and another mutual dude friend of ours and she decided to have sex with dude while he had a girlfriend. I told her she ruined the dynamic between the 4 of us and that I wasn't going to willingly live in a weird atmosphere like that and basically door slammed on her.  The second time requires too much backstory but involves my 2 best friends from high school and a woman they befriended, but with whom I never felt a connection. We all moved to different parts of the country but they spent more time in our hometown than I could & remained closer with each other than I felt like they let me. I was trying to coordinate my '09 Christmas visit home with them and none of them returned my calls over a 6 week period, but I witnessed them communicating with each other on Facebook, etc. I finally exploded on one friend's voicemail when she didn't answer for the umpteenth time. It turned into a HUGE argument between all of us. Miraculously, I did work my way through it with the friend who actually got the explosive voicemail and we're still very important to each other. My other ""best friend"" and I are still in touch occasionally but aren't anywhere near as close as we used to be.  He is still very close with the woman I never liked much. She has always lived in our hometown, he just moved back a couple weeks ago, I might be moving back in a couple months, and the whole thing gives me anxiety. It's dumb. I wish I didn't care about him anymore but we played such an important role to each other in high school that I can't just door slam and move on.   I took a long, hard look at myself after that argument and realized I needed to work on my intense anger issues. I haven't snapped on anyone since."
infj,3chh3k,Skryym,2,Wed Jul 8 01:13:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you for sharing your story, I pictured both the scenarios, and hated that those happened to you. But I guess we do snap when we feel necessary.."

It would be truly terrible because, while people have hurt me, everything truly wrong in my life is because of me and not others. Me freaking out would just wreck things even more.  If 'snapping' is defined as an angry freak-out, then I have only snapped once, and it was in complete privacy. I had to push a one row hay-rake uphill into a shed. I was having a hell of a time. I figure a lot of pressure from other shit in my life was building up, and that seemingly insignificant moment of frustration was what took me over the edge.

infj,3chh3k,jeff233,4,Wed Jul 8 03:20:21 2015 UTC,"I did kind of doorslam and burn to someone a couple of years ago. He was some guy I'd seen around but never talked to. He added me on facebook and I humoured him by adding him back, to be nice. He turned out to be a huge creep who would write these really long messages detailing who he expected me to be in order to be friends with him and all the things he wanted me to do ""when we hung out"" (I stressed that I would never hang out with him). One day I just deleted him because I was sick of it. He then made the mistake of asking why I deleted him. I put him in his place by explaining in great detail all the things I'd observed that were wrong with him, underlining his social ineptitudes and misplaced sense of superiority over other people. That stuff is really hard to swallow, so his first reaction was to assert that someone must have put me up to it, because that wasn't the person he ""knew"" me to be; I was a benign, adorable and naive girl who would never be so cruel and forthright with him.  I think INFJs can be very scary if someone rubs us the wrong way, especially if someone tries to assert that they know us better than we know ourselves. Often people like that presume they know us based on shallow information like our hobbies or appearance, or because they have taken things we have said literally, rather than seeing the subtext that sits behind every bit of information we output.  I think it can be incredibly hard to balance that need to do things the right way at the right time, without giving someone else the opportunity to beat us to the punch.

But anyways, after screwing with me for a few weeks, in ways that I couldn't do anything about without making myself look like the bad guy, he decided to wait for me after school and block the gate with his bicycle.  When I saw that, I snapped and just kamikazed into him at full speed, no braking at all.  I fully expected to break my own bones in the crash, I didn't care.

And when someone has crossed our lines, we watch, wait, and strike.  We throw all that shit in their face and then walk away, never looking back.  When we are done, we are DONE.  I've done it to a roommate who betrayed my trust.  She actually shook as I layed in to her and then packed her shit up and was gone within 24 hours.

I'm thinking of a few different friendships during which I noticed some things that rubbed me the wrong way but I ignored them, and then when those persons did me wrong, suddenly I noticed a million other things I found to be objectionable about their personality/demeanor and wondered how I was ever close with them in the first place.   Somewhat related: Do you ever feel like people latch onto you, and want you to be their new BFF, but you do not feel a connection at. all. and have a hard time deciding how to handle the situation? I feel like a pompous ass, but this happens to me often. I must send the wrong message and accidentally make people feel very comfortable with me. I don't know how to stop doing that!"
infj,3cg8cp,Randomaster08,3,Tue Jul 7 18:14:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes and yes. I've been told I'm warm, friendly and caring. A good listener. Someone that has a high tolerance for things that others wouldn't put up with. I have my flaws, and mines may clash with theirs where there may be no more ""working things out."" Like you, all of the things pop up in my head once the fallout happens....there's always signs.  If you want to give others the benefit of the doubt, it's easy to overlook."
infj,3cg8cp,DecimisMeridius,3,Tue Jul 7 18:54:03 2015 UTC,"Oh this sounds too much like me! As a guy, i think my Fe can get a little out of control sometimes due to repressing some aspects of myself in order to ""fit in"" (something I am doing less of now. I make friends with those I feel I should be friends with, but after a while I realize I have nothing in common with them and really don't enjoy being around them, even if they are good people. When these friends eventually drift away (either by time or something else) I feel relieved that I don't have to put up an act anymore. Ive noticed that setting my personal boundaries and a sort of ""check list"" system before I let anyone get too friendly with me has helped me avoid these kinds of situations from happening again. Its pretty tough not wanting to be friends (or at least friendly) with everyone, but its worth putting one's foot down and choosing who one considers a true friend."
infj,3cg8cp,UppongeleGodavari,2,Tue Jul 7 23:05:34 2015 UTC,"I haven't lost very many friends, but  those few that I have just haven't left a lot of sadness in me.  Now, sometimes I do feel a certain amount of regret over exactly how the friendship ended, but learning who I was away from this specific individual I have in mind left me feeling waves of relief as well.  It helps that I was able to perform the INFJ ""Door Slam"" and simply cut ties, but though I felt some lingering regret for the circumstances, I never felt bad about not having them around anymore.  It sounds bad when I put it on ""paper"", but I cannot lie about how it felt."
infj,3cg8cp,throwawayrom1113,2,Tue Jul 7 21:42:37 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, the last one of those was a relationship where after it ended I just felt relieved.

infj,3cg8cp,lzimmy,2,Tue Jul 7 23:09:24 2015 UTC,"I relate 1000% OP.   All of the people I've dated were my friends before boyfriends. There was one guy in particular who I liked a LOT as a friend... But he used a lot of emotional manipulation to get me to go on our first date.   I knew he was a good human being with a good heart so we started dating. In my mind it seemed logical to date him, but my emotions weren't there. Every time he felt the attraction but I didn't, I kept telling myself 'Well... You're being selfish. Why isn't your heart in this? He's clearly a nice man who deserves love and kindness and he likes you. These doubts will pass.'   Well, said doubts didn't pass and his manipulative behaviour continued to the point it became abusive. I think he recognized he liked me more than I liked him and wanted to do everything possible to hang on. The break up was SUPER ugly.    tl;dr version- I completely understand OP and think your efforts to focus on the people you genuinely enjoy is a great direction to head with your life."

I don't really have any tips for this besides just learning that saying no to friends and hangouts at times is actually okay. That just comes with practice. We feel like we're letting people down, but honestly who cares? People forget about it before you know it.  I also lead the e-board of a Christian ministry in college. It's very easy for me to listen to others and, unless I have another opinion, go with what they say if it makes sense. It has its advantages because others feel valued. But at times, it's hard for me because the people on my e-board are all passionate and strong-willed, but can also be stubborn and hardheaded.  I've learned that in those circumstances, instead of letting others plow me over with their plans as I'm making a critical decision, I need to write down the important points of what I want to accomplish long before the meetings even start. Then, it's okay for my response to be ""thank you for your thoughts, I'll think on it and let you know my decision."" It gives me time and space to take a step back, look back on what I wrote when I had a clear head, and make a decision that is informed and adheres to my own values."

Understanding the development of cognitive functions in people helps explain why.  Almost all the long term relationship stories that start when a INTJ is young, end up the same way that yours ended. Almost all the long term relationship stories that turned out good started when the INTJ was at least in their late 20s. There are exceptions to the rule, but this is the usual pattern."

For me, it really depends on the people I am around. If they are comfortable with saying I love you, I probably will be too (or at least grow to be okay with it), because it makes me happy to say that. But some people aren't totally comfortable with it, so I worry about making them uncomfortable or something, and I suck at making any sort of first move unless necessary."

infj,3cgyjp,jeff233,3,Tue Jul 7 22:06:00 2015 UTC,"I wonder if this is a specific point where INFJs tend to diverge because the introversion can vary so much?   If it's someone I know I'm comfortable with (friends from undergrad /hs / ms or church or family) I'm quick to express what's on my mind. These people say ""I tend to come on strong.""   If it's a complete stranger I'm quick to express myself too- I strike up conversations with strangers a decent amount if I see something to comment on that might somehow brighten their day... ie when I see the custodians at my local gym I'm usually like ""Everything looks super clean! Thank you so much for your hard work!"" They probably see me extroverted to a weird extreme, but I get strangely bold knowing they won't recognize me on the street.  I'm told I act very unexpressive toward people who fall between those two extremes. I was called ""quietest person in the room"" for a lot of high school. I don't know if it's necessarily fear that keeps me from expressing certain things to certain people. I spend a lot of time thinking about whether or not what I have to say interests a specific audience at a specific moment in time.   EDIT: to build on to what /u/joantheunicorn said, my expressiveness increased a TON after my older brother died ~2 years ago. I'm still trying to understand why... But yeah!"

I was afraid to tell people that I was looking for a new job, because I didn't want to hear all the ""What about job security"" and ""Oh, no, you'll have to start all over--it's easier to stay where you are"" comments.  Eventually, I said fuck it, and told some trusted friends I was looking for a new job.  I got nothing but encouragement, and eventually landed a new job that makes me happier than I could have thought.  Try to find a couple of people who you really trust, people who you know won't judge you, and mention that you're thinking of doing some volunteer work.  See how they react.  If they are supportive, try it again.  And again.  It gets easier each time you do it; you just have to make sure you're telling the right people."

Some things I've learned:  It's easy to fall into a pattern of boring food. My SO lived for years on basic-ass burritos and ramen and PB&J. She could probably have done that forever, but not me. Can't oversell the value in /r/veganrecipes...though it tends to be dessert-heavy. Oh She Glows is also a good resource--in fact, there's a number of great (if self-righteous and wordy) vegan bloggers who post tasty recipes regularly.  Get a good seitan recipe (it's time consuming, but relatively easy and WORTH IT).   You're gonna miss eggs in the morning, but a block of tofu + spices + a potato masher = a reasonable facsimile for scrambled eggs. Not the real thing, but close enough.  Gardein is a company with a pretty full line of meat substitutes. I try to only get them occasionally since they're mostly chemicals, but when you have a craving for the texture / taste of meat, it comes close enough to trick you. You're a pescetarian? They have pretty dope fried ""fish"" pieces that I use in fish tacos. When I'm drunk I can't tell the difference.   Get high, eat fruits.  Get a blender--you'll be surprised how close you can get to creamy sauces without dairy products using soaked cashews and/or silken tofu.  You'll miss cheese. There's bullshit vegan cheeses, but they're not cheese. I miss cheese.  If you're doing this for health reasons, be super careful. Vegan food is not necessarily low-calorie. Be careful of how quickly you drain that olive oil bottle. Also, Earth Balance is a pretty good margarine that holds up in a frying pan."
infj,3ces1d,sirhandel,3,Tue Jul 7 14:36:57 2015 UTC,"Vegan here! Tips I would have would be to try be conscious of your protein intake try have at least one meal at day with beans, lentils, tofu etc.. they may sound boring but you can get experiential and make lentil tacos, bean burgers etc. Buying from grocery stores is far cheaper than going to a health shop. When I first became a vegetarian I was buying everything from them and found it was costing me a bomb. Now I still frequent health stores because there are things I want that I can only get there, but with regards to nuts, seeds, lentils buy them from the grocery store. My biggest advice is invest in a food processor, it doesn't have to cost a lot but get a decent one and it will be your best friend. It can turn any veg into a sauce, make raw snacks, the list goes on. I would be lost without mine! I like jamie oliver's website, also his youtube challenge actually features some vegan recipes. There's a youtube channel called tastemade and they do a series which is called raw. vegan. not gross. which I quite enjoy. I also find pinterest a great resource for everything from sweet snacks to dinners. I also just search for recipes I used to love and see if I can make them vegan. Goodluck! :)"

Veganomicon is well organized and has both recipes for basics and more interesting stuff. If you're looking for a seitan recipe that doesn't turn out like a wet spongey mess (as most of my seitan attempts do), check this one out.   I have never really had a problem balancing my diet or feeling under nourished. Eating a well varied diet with veggies, grains, beans, and soy products served me well. I do harbor a bit of a baking addiction, but it led me to a job as a baker in a vegan bakery and some friendships with cool vegan folks.

A couple years ago I uploaded my cookbook as a Zip file to /r/vegan and it seemed to get some praise. Lots of basic stuff but lots of fun things as well. I've added plenty to it since then of course, but I haven't updated the file.  I really like chickpea tacos and these really fake peanut noodles for super cheap/easy stuff.  Lately I've been doing kale chips a lot: just throw kale on a cookie sheet, drizzle with coconut oil, sea salt, and greek seasoning and then put in the oven for 15 minutes at 350. This has become my go-to snack.  Another dish that is surprisingly easy is Hasselback potatoes with some homemade garlic margarine. You can google that easily enough but if you make the above two dishes, a simple stir fry with maybe some seitan for density (I recommend the fake chicken from Trader Joes, it's really good), and then a box of roasted pine nut cous cous from that Near East brand (again assuming you're from the US) or whatever you've basically just made a really complex dinner that will impress anyone.

By the time I hit middle and high school, it was suddenly ""cool"" to be vegetarian and I didn't have to worry about it so much.   Today, a good portion of both my male and female friends have switched over to vegetarian or vegan diets for a variety of reasons, which has been nice. Not all are NFs, some are NTs as well, and I think at least one SF cousin. Her husband, who's very into hunting and fishing, went vegan for at least a year and he said he felt great.  Considering the plethora of arguments for a vegetable based diet, there are many types who would go for it based on different reasoning. That being said, my immediate family are all NFs as far as I can tell.   In terms of recipes, there are some great books out there now on vegan baking and cooking, as well as a variety of vegetarian magazines and blogs.  I find a lot of new stuff at places like Pinterest.  With so many vegan items in stores now it's rather easy to have that lifestyle imo. Or at least a lot easier than what it used to be.

One big reason is he's not good with money (which sets me off because I've been married and my ex-husband embezzled from me). I've also noticed I am increasingly less attracted to him sexually. I think this is because he doesn't take care of his body, but combined with the fact that I'm constantly cleaning up after him and I'm providing for him financially, I've started to feel like I'm dating a teenage boy, which is not sexy.   We've had SO MANY conversations about money. I don't know how to fix that problem. I've told him that if I get offered this new job, we are getting a financial advisor, and that's that. However, this new job is 2000 miles away, and I'm super nervous about even letting him make this move with me.  The household stuff ... I've found it's better if I make him lists. It annoys me to no end that he can't just see the stuff that needs to be done and do it without having to be asked, but that's me having unrealistic expectations, so I've decided to just be grateful he'll do anything I ask him to with no objection.   And finally, the physical stuff. I've recently worked up the courage to tell him I haven't been attracted to him sexually lately and he seemed to take it all right. I tied it to the financial troubles, which we have a plan to tackle. I haven't worked up the courage to talk to him about his hygiene, though :( It's stuff you'd only notice by living with him. Actually, a couple things I've only noticed since I've been unemployed the last few weeks and have been home to see. I don't know how to tell someone they're gross without them being terribly hurt, and I don't want to hurt him.   I'm torn because we have an amazing connection intellectually and emotionally, like none I've experienced with previous SO's, and really, with few people at all. I'm scared about how hard it would be to find that with someone else. Not really sure if we've become more like each other over time, but I'm thinking not. I'd like to blame him for some of my bad habits, but that's probably just an excuse. He says he's grown less tolerant of injustice since dating me, but I doubt that's true, either. Maybe we've just made each other more aware of some things about ourselves. And yeah, I'd say that's desirable.   I hope you're doing ok. Seems like you're asking for a reason."
infj,3cfqta,BygonesBeByeGone,5,Tue Jul 7 17:22:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!   Also yes most entps are absolutely terrible at managing money. I don't really know how to best approach this but a financial advisor sounds like a great idea. Also, if you're supporting him financially maybe just make most of the financial decisions?   As far as being less attracted to him sexually, I think there are ways to motivate him to care more about his body. You have to make him want to care and also be supportive in helping him make certain lifestyle changes. I personally make an effort to eat well and stay active mainly because I want to be able to use my body how I want and I just feel and look better. Perhaps suggesting an active activity that you two can do together might help. The important thing is to make it fun, and if it engages the mind even better. I personally really enjoy soccer and yoga. And eating well helps a lot. To encourage this you can perhaps throw in some third party thoughts on the matter. Socrates: “No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.” This is pretty motivating for me. Also regarding the hygiene issue: If you are nice and bring it up with kindness he may be hurt temporarily but will realize the truth of what you're saying. Maybe putting it in terms of, ""You do you, but if that is making me not want to have sex than that's your problem"" (or maybe more tactfully, my Fe is eh)   As far as household stuff. Yes lists are really helpful, and yes ENTPs absolutely despise doing housework. If he does what you ask of him than I would say take that and run with it. It's going to be a battle to try get him to take initiative on things that he really probably doesn't care about.  It sounds like you are supporting him in many areas that he should perhaps be supporting himself. I'm not saying that his behavior is your fault, as it is clearly his own responsibility, but you might be enabling him. ENTPs are notorious for doing the minimal amount of work that they can get away with and if they see no reason for them to change than they won't. I know it may be difficult but sometimes the only way for an ENTP to learn is to stop doing things for them.  It sound like he has some maturing to do. And you can help him, if you think he's worth it. It's going to be a lot of work though.  And I don't want to tell you that you should break up with him but you seem unhappy in this relationship. I'd like to invite you to ask yourself these questions: Is he the one? If he never changes from who he is now, would you be okay with that? Are you patient enough and willing to spend the energy required to either deal with him as he is now or to help him grow and develop as a person?  Yes, ENTP-INFJ chemistry is amazing, almost addicting. It's strange how such different people can enjoy so much about each other yet also be driven insane by the same traits. Also I know it seems like you won't be able to find someone else. But there are a lot of ENTPs/INTPs and lots of people that you may be compatible with. Don't stay settle for fear of being alone. INFJs are also fairly notorious for staying in a relationship even when they know it's not working. I hope that you're able to figure out what you want and need to do.  Sorry for the disjointedness, I would say that I'll reorganize this later but I know I won't"
infj,3cfqta,BygonesBeByeGone,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:40:48 2015 UTC,"Wow, it seems like you came here looking for some insight from us, and I got a ton from you instead! Thank you so much for taking the time to selflessly share all of this with me, it's very helpful. Quite like having a financial planner as a 3rd party to get the monetary issues in line, I seriously appreciate the Socrates quote you floated here as a 3rd party for the physical issues - I think I'm gonna use that when I do have the conversation with him, in the kind and supportive way that you suggested.   Couple things you said were so accurate it hurt:   It sounds like you are supporting him in many areas that he should perhaps be supporting himself. I'm not saying that his behavior is your fault, as it is clearly his own responsibility, but you might be enabling him. ENTPs are notorious for doing the minimal amount of work that they can get away with and if they see no reason for them to change than they won't.   and   INFJs are also fairly notorious for staying in a relationship even when they know it's not working.   As far as that first quote goes, he seems to be realizing his minimal efforts on an existential level regarding his career right now, mostly due to the fact that I may or may not be getting this job and we may or may not be moving. He's been looking forward to leaving his job and is realizing that he needs to leave it regardless of the outcome of my interview. Maybe I need to piggyback on this momentum, though I feel crappy kicking a man when he's down.   And that second quote? Is it possible that we're also notorious for just not being able to decide what the right decision is? Because I truly don't know the answer to those questions. IS he the one? He could be! But I think the fact that I've been divorced makes me question my own judgment. I was wrong before, I could be wrong again. Gah.  Anyway, he and I clearly need to have a serious discussion, and I feel much more prepared after your post than I did before it, so thank you."
infj,3cfqta,Herrokitty17,3,Wed Jul 8 01:57:40 2015 UTC,"My current SO is an ENTP and admittedly, we've broken up and gotten back together a time or two but that was due to issues mostly unrelated to ENTP/INFJ compatibility. We have, however, used our specific known strengths and weaknesses as ENTP and INFJs to work through our issues and have now built a pretty solid relationship. In the process, though, we struggled with a few things. For example his desire to debate everything became a chore rather than intellectually stimulating and it started to feel like he was constantly questioning or undermining me personally. Being that I know I struggle with criticism and having him constantly question and debate everything I said put a significant strain on the relationship. Being that we are both interested in MBTI I was able to tell him how his devil's advocate approach to everything was wearing on me in a more black and white approach versus telling him how it affected my feelings (since, you know, ENTPs struggle with those lol). Discussing relational difficulties in a more ""scientific"" manner has really helped us to build a better understanding of one another and how to best approach situations knowing our types.   He and I were very similar to start with in terms of general likes/dislikes but I don't know if we've become more like each other over the course of our relationship. If anything, I think we've grown to appreciate and accept our differences which I think is wonderfully desirable. To be fair, I could easily see myself molding to his whims at the start of our relationship before I became comfortable speaking up for myself and expressing my opinions. Through our relationship we've both learned and grown a ton - specifically for me it was learning to express myself :) If you guys are mature and committed ENTP and INFJ can learn a lot from one another!"

We both had mental disorders but we worked through that together. We both lived in SoCal and he ended up going to college in NorCal so we did the long distance thing and would visit each other and he'd come back home for the summers.   Long distance we lasted about 2 years and our relationship was almost 4. Eventually he broke up with me because the distance got to him and we were so young, he wanted to see what else was out there and experience college more I think. The reason he gave was he wasn't in love with me anymore but we're still good friends. I couldn't choose a better first long term relationship.   We would talk a lot about psychology, philosophy, mythology, etc. He liked to debate but was also very thoughtful in his own ways. I don't think we became like each other but we were very close and developed the same interests."

There were times in the beginning though, even when the relationship was good, that I fantasized about leaving her for a less clingy more assertive woman. Her emotions really irritated me at times and I just felt like she was a doormat, which was a turnoff, but these issues aren't relevant anymore. We are great at communicated how we feel/think to each other and I think that is how the issues were resolved. Edit: As far as INTP's go... I know one, a friend. Used to be friend actually...

infj,3ccfmw,aeschenkarnos,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:39:40 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'm not a pacifist and I do not agree that violence is inherently wrong. It's just a means used to achieve ends, and its morality is dependent on the consequences and motivations. Most of the time it's desirable to avoid it, because most of the time the consequences are worse. However, there are exceptions to that.  So I'm competely okay with the kind of violence that basically amounts to stopping people from doing horrible things even if they really really want to do those things, even if their lives depend on them doing horrible things, and especially even if they don't agree that they shouldn't be allowed to do horrible things.   If you want to think less of me for that, I'm okay with that too.  A literal interpretation of the word ""contract"" creates this kind of misapprehension that people should somehow have to agree to it in advance, or that it should follow principles of contract law, which gives rise to a lot of libertarian nonsense. It's not that kind of contract."
infj,3ccfmw,meecho02,2,Tue Jul 7 10:41:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not a pacifist either. I also don't believe in the right/wrong view of the world.

But no one is in the position to judge another person -- because if I were immersed in the totality of that person's ""shoes"", e.g. had the same parents, family, relatives, friends, environment, life experiences, thoughts, feelings, genes, body, soul, basically everything that comprises that person, I would act and be the exact same way as that person. I can merely say that an action doesn't meet my needs (violence doesn't meet my need for safety.)  The philosophy of nonviolence is not the same as pacifism. We agree, that an action is dependent on the motivation, or the intention. Cutting a person's belly open leading to that person's death can be both nonviolent and violent -- if a thief does it with the intention to harm it's violent, if a surgeon does it with the intention to help it's nonviolent.   It's pointless to think less of you for your viewpoints.  The definition of ""literal"": taking words in their usual or most basic sense without metaphor or allegory. So yes, I'm going by the definition of ""contract"", which is: ""an agreement having a lawful object entered into voluntarily by two or more parties, each of whom intends to create one or more legal obligations between them."" Key word is ""voluntarily"". A Social Contract isn't a contract unless both parties are aware of the agreement. So if you don't agree that both parties need to be aware of the agreement, maybe a better term would be the Social Dictum. Either way, it's still one-sided, covert, and if you expect the other party to somehow read your mind then you're going to keep end up getting hurt and losing friends like OP describes."
infj,3ccfmw,aeschenkarnos,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:00:59 2015 UTC,"I can see your viewpoint, however I can't see any benefit in accepting it for myself and I certainly don't think it would be accepted by wider society. It doesn't pass the Idiot test and it definitely doesn't pass the Asshole test. If a society is to adopt a founding philosophy, the philosophy must be capable of withstanding the actions of Idiots (well-meaning but irrational and uninformed) and Assholes (intentionally destructive, and/or willing to self-advance at any cost to others). Anarcho-syndicalism, fundamentalist non-violencism, libertarianism (or whatever variant of these you want to call yourself) survives neither of these.  Also, my expectations that the other party should be basically considerate of me and not lie to me and not intentionally hurt me are reasonable. That's axiomatic, or tautological. Agreement to that point is my test of reasonableness. I don't think that's a standard that requires them to ""read my mind"" or ""sign up voluntarily"", and if I lose those people, all to the good; they're not friends, and not worth trying to be friends with."
infj,3ccfmw,meecho02,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:43:27 2015 UTC,"Nonviolence was advocated by Martin Luther King Jr (Civil Rights Movement), Gandhi (India's Independence) and Nelson Mandela (ending apartheid in South Africa). It is very much championed and honored by society.   Doesn't matter what you define reasonable. Unless you are explicit in your wants and needs, you expect people to know what you need without you telling them (""read your mind""). Difficult road to travel when you could simply voice your needs, but to each his own."
infj,3ccfmw,kookacat,4,Wed Jul 8 05:44:55 2015 UTC,"I used to be very black and white with things like these. However, I've learned to see more in the gray and just be overall discerning. It really is about learning what amounts of trust you give each person you mean, and which people to keep at arm's length. Not all friendships are meant to be deep anyway. The earlier we INFJs learn and understand that, the better time we will have at socializing and keeping ourselves safe. I still have some people shut off from my life for good, but those people, I feel, truly deserved it and have no part in my life. Others, I just keep at a distance. Some, very few, I really trust and I like to keep it that way."
infj,3ccfmw,TheMom4040,2,Mon Jul 6 22:54:53 2015 UTC,"Yours is a solid, balanced approach. People tend to act in their own best interests, regardless of whether they are inherently a good or bad person, and we can't trust everyone to always act in what is our own best interests instead of theirs. Also certainly there are many of us that avoid manipulative people (as the OP described self-behavior) no matter how ""nice"" they are to us personally, because we don't trust/like manipulative individuals. Learning who to trust and who to keep at arm's length is an important skill, especially since most of us can't simply shut anyone we can't trust out of our lives, for example: professional relationships at work, family relationships, people within our larger social groups, etc. Sounds like you have a good handle on getting along in this world."
infj,3ccfmw,Teacupbunny,3,Tue Jul 7 17:52:14 2015 UTC,"You could have just described me, and I struggle with the same issue. For a while I warned people ""I am much nicer until you get to know me"" essentially sabotaging friendships before they could begin. I think a better way, and what seems to be working for me, is making sure people know your deal breaker, being loyalty, and placing responsibility on yourself to think things through before door slamming. Like I said, I still struggle, but have managed to salvage a few friendships now and am so glad I have."

infj,3ccfmw,BananaJuice1,2,Tue Jul 7 03:41:58 2015 UTC,I tend to follow the black and white thinking for things like this. I definitely need to work on it because I don't find it particularly healthy. I've got a small problem at the moment with one of my closest friend (who's an ENFP). He's cheated on his girlfriend several times this year whilst she's been completely loyal to him. I would say it's none of his business but I know her to be an honest and salt of the earth character. Is it okay that I can't trust him as much any more? It just goes against everything I stand for :(
infj,3ccfmw,TheMom4040,3,Tue Jul 7 08:59:57 2015 UTC,"In addition to whether you trust him as much, it may also be about figuring out how much you respect him now?  (And if you spend time with her, about whether you feel like you're somehow complicit in what he's doing by remaining silent?)"
infj,3ccfmw,BananaJuice1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:57:41 2015 UTC,"I'd say I've definitely lost a considerable amount of respect for him! There must be an element of guilt there as well- as you say.

infj,3ccfmw,BygonesBeByeGone,2,Tue Jul 7 19:31:34 2015 UTC,"I had this exact issue with a best friend. I completely understood that she was falling out of love with her college boyfriend - it happens. But I did NOT like that she was inviting men over to her apartment to cook her dinner while her boyfriend was at work, and that she was kissing other boys. I never even really liked her boyfriend to start with, but he grew on me over their 4 years together; I felt bad for him and I just wanted her to do the right thing & break up with him before she pursued other interests. She did, finally, but I've watched her make a series of other seemingly obvious, poor decisions in her love life since then and I've had to distance myself from her."
infj,3ccfmw,BananaJuice1,2,Tue Jul 7 18:31:25 2015 UTC,"Ah right, distancing someone like that was probably a smart move! In my opinion being disloyal & dishonest just goes against our INFJ values if anything."
infj,3ccfmw,tentativesteps,2,Tue Jul 7 19:35:24 2015 UTC,"I think what's lacking is empathy.  At some point down the line, you have to deeply recognize that people simply do not have the same level of consideration of others that you might, and that we are all just flawed in general.  It is true that some malicious behavior is unforgivable, but a surprising number of things (and even deep betrayals) are forgivable in the end.  A few of my reckonings came when I almost threw away long, valuable relationships over some serious missteps over the other person's part, and I realized that I would regret tossing these relationships aside 5, 10 years down the road.  When deciding to go Jekyll and Hyde on someone, please first consider if you are doing your future self any benefit by acting a particular way."

I wish I hadn't been so helpful in the beginning because to do much of anything now would likely be seen as petty on my part. I mostly ignore him now but we're going to still have some connection due to the organization we're now both a part of. My instincts say to doorslam but I'm trying to break the habit of doing that.

infj,3cfo2g,throwmeaway_peas,5,Tue Jul 7 15:28:56 2015 UTC,"Do you think that your reaction has anything to do with the fact that you're now out of your comfort zone?  You said you recently left a job that was stress-free and comfortable because it didn't pay enough.  I'm guessing that you had done this job for a while and knew it and the people in your department relatively well.  You're now in a new place, doing a new role and learning the ropes, and that's scary because you're suddenly a bit of a fish out of water.  Companies have grace periods for a reason.  No one is expected to know the role straight away, and everyone is expected to have a learning curve.  They hired you because they thought you were right for the role and a good fit for the team.  It sounds to me like your problem with the job may be that you are lacking confidence in yourself and your skills because, for the first time in perhaps a long time, you're not in your comfort zone.  Change is scary, but it is the only way to grow.  I say give it a month, minimum, and if you still feel the same as you do now, then by all means, walk away.  But right now, it sounds like you're not giving this job or the people in it a chance, and it's because you're scared and lacking confidence.  I could be wrong, of course.  I don't know you, I don't know your skillset, I don't know your job or the people you are working with.  But that's what I'm getting from the above paragraph."
infj,3cfo2g,Intempestivity,2,Tue Jul 7 17:45:40 2015 UTC,"This happens to me in every new job, whether I've worked there before or not. It takes me about six months to really feel comfortable and secure in any new position. I assume they don't treat you badly and it's an ok place to work?  Please give it a month and promise yourself you'll evaluate things then. You are going to feel uncomfortable in new situations, but they will subside in time."

infj,3cfo2g,PluviusReddit,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:57:41 2015 UTC,Hey I agree with all the above. Try and hold out for that first month. I also think part of your stress might stem from wanting persue your passion. Last year I was in a position where I was working in a comoany that was quite similar ti what you described your old job too be. I would then talk to my friends and muse abouty passions and my dreams. Later id head home and cry myself to sleep because I was stuck in a place where I felt I couldn't persue my passion. I am now in a job that gives me the flexibility to work and earn a living while I persue my dream. I think it might be wise to figure out what part of the pain you are feeling is coming from your job and what oart is coming from you not persuing yoir passion.
infj,3ce2co,hollz22,5,Tue Jul 7 04:44:24 2015 UTC,"yea, I am infj and I can really relate to this. It's tough for us to reach out to friends when we need help/advice because as you said they don't know us as well as they think. I usually use those moments as opportunities (although really a more accurate word here would be tests) to share more with them and see if they can be trusted. We are a very rare group with this big emphasis on trust and loyalty. I find myself constantly testing and re-testing everyone I know to make sure they can be trusted and/or remain trusted."
infj,3ce2co,hmdingshma96,3,Tue Jul 7 05:54:31 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Fact of the matter is I'm okay with keeping to myself and letting my thoughts stew in my head, although it might not be the healthiest. If we actually do share we expect that you understand us a little by now and how to find equilibrium in a conversation like we strive so hard for, if you insult that then I shut down, you lost your opportunity.  From that point on the person is put into a different category, more specifically they'll never see the real ""me"" again because they've insulted it. Call it immature, it sure can be at times but its a core value that I and I believe many others hold close. I have other people i can be me with, I don't have time to be around people who can't understand me."

While the friend you described sounds like an utter jerk--you're better off without the person--please understand that people can't know what is going on in your head unless you tell them--others aren't as intuitive as you are."
infj,3ce2co,Eudemonia66,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:07:10 2015 UTC,I am currently dealing with a very similar situation. I opened up to an ENFJ who I believed to be a friend and had my boundaries breached. I hold myself accountable for ignoring my intuition on this one but I sincerely wanted to believe that this person was trustworthy considering the similarities in our personality styles. It's disappointing for me but I've had to put a wedge between myself and the ENFJ in order to sort my feelings out. I also agree that I as an INFJ I tend to expect others to intuit where my boundaries lie without clearly expressing myself. In my case it's also a conflict avoidance strategy.

If you're anything like me, you cannot be told and want to follow your instincts/desires- whether it ends in making mistakes or success you learn a more valuable lesson  either way. My advice is to eliminate relying on people financially if possible because they end up having more 'power' over big decisions.

infj,3cdbrz,jenayvo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:53:49 2015 UTC,"Thats the problem.  I have always been able to support myself financially but I was in an accident and lost a really good paying job and feel like i've taken 3 steps back in life.  I really wish I didn't have to depend on anyone for financial support because thats when I struggle more than anything.    I totally relate to everything you said.  I would rather just make a mistake and learn from it rather than have you make the decisions for me and control my life.    For me, everyone in my life has learned that they cannot force me to do anything, and like you said it ends poorly for everyone.    Its so weird too.  I have a mentor she's an ENFP, love them, and she is supportive of every single decision I have ever made and I can't tell you what an impact it has made on my life.  Even when I mess up I am able to bounce back and recover so much faster with her by my side, not trying to take control or tell me what to do, but to simply support me."
infj,3cdbrz,jenayvo,2,Tue Jul 7 05:10:29 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear about the accident. It sounds tough now but it's not a life sentence, if you prioritise working your way out of debt and to health you will be okay. Not sure where you're from but I know college in America is often a huuuuge step backwards financially. I'm in Australia and while I can postpone paying my fees till I start earning money, day to day expenses are still big and I can only fit a casual job in on the weekends during semester time. If it's not for a degree you're deeply passionate about or require then honestly DO NOT do it. I've seen a lot of friends drop out because they were just pressured into going and hated it. It's a huge responsibility that sounds like it will just be a burden on you right now. That's great you have a supportive mentor, you will need those people in your life who can offer you sound advice, but will not push you into anything and can laugh/cry with you about mistakes you might make along the way with out being preachy or saying ""I told you so""."

I have only completely lost it on a few people, but I left jaws dropped.  Mainly because I'm just so reserved and quiet, and no one ever thought I had the ability to produce that much rage.    The humiliated in public or attacking a vulnerable is spot on and I will drop you completely and never look back.  Thats the part no one can understand about me.

I have tended in the past to take abuse after abuse from those close to me for too damn long, but in the end enough is enough and I explode like a volcano. Then I essentially ice you out forever, you don't exist to me and you may as well be invisible even if I see you in public. These days my tolerance for taking people's bullshit is so low I tend to let people go before they get to treat me so badly I want to explode. It always irritates me when people totally treat me like crap and then expect to get back in my life like nothing happened, I feel like they're treating me like a fool who will fall for their mind games. I don't care if it's been years since I saw you, if you screwed me over  keep walking cos I'm over you and I don't give second chances to those who don't deserve my loyalty.

infj,3cdzhc,Intempestivity,5,Tue Jul 7 09:01:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think it has anything to do with him being INFJ and is more to do with him acting like a jerk. There are a lot of red flags here, the controlling behaviour and potential for emotional abuse (trying to make you jealous by hitting on other girls - at least that's how I see it as an INFJ myself; running hot and cold;lying to you about dating others - the description you give almost sounds like he was gaslighting you). Also the description of him, eg immature, flippant under stress sound like excuses for the above mentioned bad behaviour. I'm sorry this doesn't answer all of your questions but I get an immensely bad vibe from this story and I hope that doesn't hurt you. I know that chemistry and attraction are difficult to let go of and the best advice I can give you is to go with it if you must, but treat it like a limited time only kind of deal - enjoy what is good about it while it lasts, and let it go gracefully when the time is up."

No. Hanging out with a bunch of exes only indicates, at least to me, is that he is indecisive, especially disrespectful to his current, if any, gf and changes his mind ""like a girl changes her clothes"". But the thing is that he probably will likely stop hang out with his exes, if I have relationship with this guy and tell him how I feel about it. But still... a big turnoff"

""I'm sure if I just did x, they wouldn't behave this way!""    You can't change him, and if he's playing head games with you now, there's really nothing to indicate he won't continue to do so if you got in to an official relationship with him--they might even get worse."
infj,3cdzhc,BananaJuice1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:25:31 2015 UTC,"I got your point but I should have explained further. My prediction above is based on how he behaves: as soon as he finds out that I do not like something in particular about him or in general, he instantly changes his behavior and sticks to it no matter what, even when he is very mad at me. This is because he is a very rule-based guy , so I guess he has a desire to comply with ""my rule"", especially because he already knows I leave a guy whom I find unfit for me. I think his obsession with rules is partly because he knows he is unstable and ashamed of his behavior. I do find his head games troublesome, though."

infj,3cbf21,Intempestivity,3,Mon Jul 6 16:29:35 2015 UTC,Very thorough! I'd very much like to read more of what you have written. Have you done this with any other types?
infj,3cbf21,CrabFlab,5,Mon Jul 6 17:31:58 2015 UTC,"I can't take credit for putting this together; this is what I received when I completed my officially adminstered test and it's my official MBTI profile.  All I did was transcribe it from a print-out in to a digital copy to post online.  I thought it might help people who are confused with regards to INFJ and what exactly that means in terms of behaviours and preferences.  I'd be happy to transcribe the second half of it, though, where it discusses how to utilise the functions with regards to Communication, Making Decisions, Managing Change and Managing Conflict, if you feel it would be interesting/useful at all."
infj,3cbf21,CrabFlab,2,Mon Jul 6 17:39:48 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see! I appreciate the transcription either way.   I'd love to see the second half, if you don't mind taking the time to type it :)"

infj,3cbf21,Wooliebear123,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:33:29 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of information out there on the cognitive functions and how they work; there's whole books on it.  There are a couple of pages in the report on the cognitive functions and how they work together (Ni Fe Ti Se), and I can transcribe those as well if you really want me to.  I just thought it would be helpful for people to get an in-depth level of MBTI that is not readily available outside of the actual report profile."
infj,3cbf21,Dayrien0108,2,Mon Jul 6 19:38:22 2015 UTC,"Oh, ok. I just think that these four(eight) letters are not enough for a type. Because looking at them people may think that INFP and INFJ are really simmilar types, differenting only by the last letter, while in reality they are very different. It confused me when I was introduced to MBTI. Only cognitive functions helped me realise what this whole MBTI thing is about."
infj,3cbf21,Dayrien0108,2,Mon Jul 6 19:54:17 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of resources available to help anyone who is interested determine the difference in the functions and how they work together.  If you're looking at the basic tests that are available for free online and the generic descriptions accompanying them, then yes, it can get confusing, because they're not done in any great detail.  J and P are very different.  A P-type would have the facets Casual (relaxed, easygoing, welcome diversions), Open-Ended (present-focused, go with the flow, make flexible plans), Pressure-Prompted (motivated by pressure, bursts and spurts, early start unstimulating), Spontaneous (want variety, enjoy the unexpected, procedures hinder) and Emergent (plunge in, let strategies emerge, adaptable).  I don't have any more detail than that, because I didn't type P in any facet, so my report doesn't go any deeper.  I can outline the facets for Extraversion, Sensing and Thinking, if you'd like?  I've already done Introversion, Intuition, Feeling and Judging in the original post, and Perceiving in this comment."
infj,3cal20,Captain-TomTom,30,Mon Jul 6 12:06:06 2015 UTC,Because you are focusing on all the negative sides. Think of it like discovering a superpower. At first it's out of control and hard to live with. Then it opens a world of new possibilities.

infj,3cal20,zacharyfmtaylor,18,Mon Jul 6 13:26:17 2015 UTC,"First of all, feel lucky you discovered your type at a young age.  You can easily research your strengths and weaknesses and know where and how you need to develop.  Feel bad for the INFJs who go there entire life not only misunderstood but never knowing why.  Make sure you make it a priority to learn as much as possible about your type.  Secondly, understand that you are not alone and that there is tremendous support out there.  Yes, being an INFJ is especially difficult for males because we have feminine characteristics that don't exactly agree with gender roles in society, but that just means your social and professional success may be more difficult -- but NOT impossible.  Remember that there are potential mates out there who would love to be with you.  Your job as an INFJ is to practice gratitude as often as possible because it's way too easy for us to become negative.  Get regular exercise and eat healthy.  Establishing a healthy social life is also incredibly important.  I don't know about other INFJs, but all my life's problems tend to become small after positive social interactions, especially if they are with beautiful women.  Learn to really become aware of where you get positive energy from, then cultivate it in your life.  Also, as of today, no longer hate being an INFJ.  Just see it as a challenge that will bring great rewards."

infj,3cal20,shinbum,2,Mon Jul 6 21:51:59 2015 UTC,Well I'm lurking around now and see similarities to myself and others. I don't feel as alone as before. There were a few introverts in my family and they... unfortunately committed suicide. I teeter on that edge off and on because the disconnection from so many people is painful to deal with. It's like... Why can't I just get myself together and be like everyone else.   So now I'm just seeing what is so great about being an INFJ. I'll learn in time I guess.
infj,3cal20,Ariadne11,8,Tue Jul 7 02:46:21 2015 UTC,"There are many people who have learned to love their identity as an INFJ. Please, hang around this forum for a while, and see. Many INFJ's live happy, fulfilled lives. It isn't a disease, it is a wonderful gift."
infj,3cal20,le_funny_memer,12,Mon Jul 6 13:38:26 2015 UTC,"It sounds like your issue isn't with being an INFJ, it's being told you are one. After all, you didn't have this stress beforehand. It only started when you took a test and, expecting something else, got a result that you didn't like.  But what are you going to do about it? I mean, it's the way you are. Do you ever get angry at yourself because you failed to grow wings? Of course not, right? That doesn't make sense. Growing wings was never an option. You're stuck with things as they are so ask yourself: what are you going to do about it?  You tried personality change, and that didn't work. The way I see it, the only other option is acceptance, which it sounds like you've not bothered to attempt.   The only thing stopping you from having peace and clarity is you getting mad at yourself for getting a four letter combination on a couple of self-administered tests. Dude, there is so much more to life than this. Who cares about the MBTI? If reading about INFJs makes you queasy, don't read about INFJs. If you want peace and clarity, then do things that make you feel peaceful, and focus on what you're thinking until it's clear."
infj,3cal20,bazoril,2,Mon Jul 6 13:53:35 2015 UTC,"There are two ways to look at this, one choice is for you to be upset that you are an INFJ because all your faults seem to be reflected back at you.  On the other-hand you might see that there are others like you, that they seem to to go through the same mistakes as you. You might learn from their solutions to similar problems."
infj,3cal20,fietsvrouw,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:17:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for the different views and advice. Well I never knew my type before (vaguely anyways) and I always hated the way I am and tried to change it but the more I changed the more I just winded up staying the same. You can only do a facade for so long. Majority of my family is extroverts and I somehow winded up being the black sheep and becoming an introvert. You would never guess I was related to my family if it wasn't for looks. I act so different from them and I've always been ridiculed for it. So I've internalized it... (Again... another symptom of an INFJ) and tried to fix it by emulating their personalities and I've been miserable.   After learning so much about INFJs all I can see is the bad things about them that I seem to be doing constantly. It kind of feels like I'm in a perpetual state of wanting to belong. Another way I've tried to position myself in people's inner circles is that for some reason I have this label on my forehead that says: EXPOSE ALL SECRETS TO ME! In a sick way... I could blackmail everyone I work with people everyone seem to want to bombard me with problems they have. (Not that I'd ever want to do that though.) It's a lot for me to process at one time. I just recently discovered that my parents (Particularly my father) are narcissistic as well and that was an eye opener and yet I still somehow blame myself for the treatment I get from them.   I feel like I'm rambling incoherently but I've been so stressed lately that I'm getting physically sick.
infj,3cal20,fietsvrouw,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:33:09 2015 UTC,"i responded to you above, but then I saw your post here. Definitely stop focusing on the INFJ description and how it spells your doom. There are some subreddits for people who are raised by narcissists, and having parents who are narcissists changes how you relate to everyone until you can work through that damage, one of the main ones being an inability to defend your borders (so people overshare etc.) It damages self-esteem and will definitely leave you feeling all alone in the world if you do not collapse into their pathology and live in their finctional world with them. (Can you tell I know something about being raised by narcissists).  I can recommend /r/raisedbynarcissists/ as a starting point. They have a lot of other resources including related subreddits in their sidebar.  You can sort this out."
infj,3cal20,shinbum,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:04:52 2015 UTC,"I am not sure why getting something else would change anything for you. The types are a shorthand for clusters of characteristics and more importantly, the way in which you relate to the world. Getting a different answer won't change who you are. The description gives generalizations.  Being an INFJ does not force you to be a perfectionist, or force you to feel that no one understands you. If you are unhappy with characteristics about yourself, I would suggest working on those things either on your own or in therapy. Get your locus of control back inside yourself and work on self-acceptance. I mean, if you like who you are, a label is not going to be an issue. What you definitely do NOT want to do is keep taking the Meyer-Briggs test and looking to it for answers to how to fix those things.  There are many shades to all of those characteristics. You can have a tendency to seek perfection without being tied in knots over it or preventing yourself from ever completing something. You can use the types to identify that some things about you are not as predominant socially, but you can just as easily look at the types and say - wow , there is a whole group of people who share this experience, and use that to feel less isolated."
infj,3cal20,onspace,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:59:19 2015 UTC,"Maybe you fear being yourself, may that have been caused by social pressure, a deciding moment in your life, or something else. The root of that anxiety, no one can know but you. Maybe it's something else. There is a solid line between self-pride and self-contentment, choose one. Maybe you in reality feel exclusive about yourself (which is all right, we ARE the 2%), and the attitude only backfires as hating who you are. Be proud, be content. You are great the way you are."
infj,3cal20,Greenbananas123,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:20:32 2015 UTC,"I'm curious at what you'd rather be. As for me, I sometimes wish I was INTJ because I can't for the life of me say no to someone or stand up for myself. But I think it's more my overused of Fe and utter lack of Se that is making me feel like that."
infj,3cb8c1,ivorydolphins,3,Mon Jul 6 15:38:04 2015 UTC,"No. I've never felt like I have ever needed more friends than I can keep track of. In fact, I've told my wife a couple of times now, ""I think I have enough friends now. I'm not really looking for anymore.""  I can see why you would feel inadequate. My wife is friends with everyone. Seriously. Everyone. The connections she makes and how she can network is short of unbelievable. But, I know I could never handle that many people at once. I have trouble with the amount of actual people I call friends -- which is close to single digits.  Though it might be scary, maybe it's time to branch out and try to find a new group or person to be friends with.  More than half of my friends are from online. Playing the same game or from talking on the same forums. These friends have been some of the people that are closest to me and it all started with having a common interest. I've kept in contact with them for 7+ years."
infj,3cb8c1,duncanatwork,2,Mon Jul 6 16:54:20 2015 UTC,"Most of my relationships are online ones as well. I've turned to game streaming as a source of socializing, and it makes me feel 'fulfilled' but not overwhelmed.   My issue is more of a self esteem one I think I have to work on. Have to stop comparing myself to other people and also try to make some new friends. I recently started a league club at my college and will be the 'president' and my acquaintance will be the other 'president'. Hopefully this will help me form relationships with others in a relaxed environment. Thanks for your input."

infj,3cb8c1,Intempestivity,3,Mon Jul 6 20:57:48 2015 UTC,"The right people will understand and respect your need for introversion.  It's not a burden, and it's nothing personal against them.  If someone does take it personally or acts like you needing time to yourself is a burden on them--then they are not the right person for you.  When I got my MBTI results, I was surprised that one of the points it made was that Introverts draw very strong lines between friends and acquaintances.  I asked my practioner, ""Doesn't everyone do that?""  And he laughed and said no, that Extraverts and Introverts define relationships very differently.  What we would view as acquaintances, an extravert views as friends.  What we view as friends, extraverts tend to view as close friends.  It made me feel relieved, because chances are the extraverts in your life don't have nearly as many friends in the way that we would define them--they have lots and lots of what we would call acquaintances that they view as friends.  Which makes sense--ain't nobody got time or energy to invest in forty or so deep and meaningful relationships.  It just doesn't happen."
infj,3cb8c1,Puffling_,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:08:34 2015 UTC,"I know you're right, I just have a hard time with that. I tend to feel bad that people think i'm ignoring them or I often get people saying t his behind my back like 'oh, she's stuck up' or 'she's a bitch' since I suddenly retreat back to my space and I guess it gives off bad vibes to the extroverted people I know.   I do that as well. I call most people I know acquaintances, which has actually insulted some people lol although I don't have bad intentions, and very very few people I've called friends. For me, a friendship is a real time investment, and since i'm quickly tired from socializing, it becomes almost an 'opportunity cost' situation in my head. I kinda go 'is this worth spending x time with y person? not too worth it? I rather stay home and play video games then or veg out/go out alone'  I'm glad to know i'm not the only one out there like this, I never thought I was 'strange' or anything and of course I knew there must be many others like me but I've rarely met them IRL"
infj,3cb8c1,Puffling_,2,Mon Jul 6 18:18:34 2015 UTC,"I get you.  This would happen to me in the dining hall while I was in college all the time.  I would sit down with one or two friends to eat and I could literally sit there and enjoy a conversation for HOURS. It wasn't uncommon to spend 3+ hours just talking to a friend or two in the dining hall.  On the other hand, as soon as the group grew, or someone joined us that I didn't know very well -- I would find pretty much any excuse to leave as I could. I would quickly become overwhelmed or uncomfortable.  Similarly, if I entered the dining hall alone and saw one or two of my friends sitting together, I would join them; if I saw a big group of friends or a group of friends that included people I didn't know well, I'd sit by myself and eat quickly and leave.  What I can tell you is that despite this ""quirk,"" I made tons of friends and was in plenty of relationships.  What really helped was living in a dorm situation with roommates. The close quarters sort of forces you to from relationships with the people in your area and I've found that once people get to know me, despite my slightly awkwardness (some people are actually attracted to it...) people tended to like me!  High school played out well for me too.  The key was getting involved in clubs or activities.  I can be awkward when interacting just for the sake of interacting.  First day of school being pushed out to recess or lunch and not knowing anyone was a nightmare.  However, when there is a purpose or goal that I am able to focus on while working with others, I find I become more more relaxed and actually pretty socially adept. For me it was student government, but I can imagine this working with just about any type of club.  Further, if you find yourself an established member or leader in a club, you'll likely find that you are FANTASTIC at helping new members acclimate.  New members won't overwhelm you, and because you know what it is like to feel uncomfortable in new situations, you will be excellent at helping new members feel welcome and get them engaged. This is where I shine and I imagine you have the capability to shine too.  Also, these clubs and activities will give you something invaluable -- a relatively socially safe place to forge friendships.  You'll make friends without ever having to face the awkwardness of random social encounters. Once you figure it out -- it feels like an INFJ life hack.  TLDR; Random social encounters with people (especially groups that include people you don't know) will ALWAYS feel awkward.  INFJ life-hack is to get involved with a club or activity you love.  Engage in the activity and people will naturally be drawn to you."
infj,3cb8c1,CrabFlab,3,Mon Jul 6 17:07:56 2015 UTC,"That is exactly me. I will spend hours with one person but when more people come to the group I run away. My introverted-ness coupled with my social anxiety (which funny enough, got worse the more isolated myself which in turn made me isolate myself more lol) makes it a bit hard for me to get involved.   I will actually be doing exactly what you said, I am forming a League of Legends club at my college and as one of the founders I will be able to be in an environment that I 'control' a bit so it won't be as unpredictable and i'll also get to meet people with similar interests. Hopefully this will help a lot :)   Thank you for your advice, you made me feel even more excited for the fall semester for the club to finally start meeting."

I miss my college days :) Going back to grad school next year myself, but I don't think it will be the same.  Make sure to enjoy your undergrad!  P.S. I read your comment about self-esteem above -- I've been there too.  What you'll eventually realize is that you are your biggest critic by FAR and that you are giving everyone else the benefit of the doubt.  While you will be your harshest judge, you will be everyone else's biggest advocate -- it's no wonder you'll lose in that comparison.  Every time you are are having self-esteem issues, remember that.  It will become a thought habit and eventually you'll internalize it. Even a modicum of confidence in yourself will result in an explosion the INFJ brand passion that attracts other electrically.

infj,3cb8c1,__leatherandlace__,2,Mon Jul 6 18:26:54 2015 UTC,"No, I don't really feel that way.   I used to, though.   These days, I am pretty comfortable the way I am. Once school ends, you'll find that the number of times you're forced into giant similarly-aged groups is almost zero. From then on, you'll be dealing with exactly as many people as you want to (for the most part), and the number of friendships your average person considers themselves to have will plummet. Most people who have been out of school for a couple of years can count their real friends on one hand.   For extroverts, I imagine this is a shock. Where did all my friends go?   For me, it was a relief. Now I can have some peace!  Currently, I have 6 good friends. I'm married to one of them. That's enough for me. Most people I know, extroverted or not, have about the same.   I'd say try not to worry so much about what other people are doing. There are people who enjoy things you don't, and things you do that other people wouldn't. It all evens out, you know what I mean? Don't beat yourself up for preferring red over blue."
infj,3cbx7k,Damnit7563,8,Mon Jul 6 18:40:58 2015 UTC,"I've had this discussion with my INFP friend before :)  What she feels is me being ""cold and straightforward"" is me getting tired of dropping hints that she didn't pick up, so I get blunt and tell her that she needs to give me space or she's doing x which is frustrating to me or that I think the decision she's so determined to carry out is a bad one.  She knows now that it's nothing personal and that I still love her, but she's kind of bad at reading people and I'm kind of bad at communicating directly, so every now and again this fizzes up.  Maybe have a talk with your INFJ friends and ask if they were trying to get a message across and maybe you missed a hint or got some mixed signals, and tell them you'd like them to be more direct with things of that nature--and if they get blunt when they're direct, don't take it personally; we're just crap at getting words out of our mouths.

There's times where I'm actually very warm as usual. When being straightforward, I do it to make things clear and to make sure other people understand my position in a rational way, and when I'm exiting the more extroverted part of the cycle. Sometimes I'm ""cold"" for no reason at all other than I don't feel the need to express anything in particular.  Don't take for granted that your friends are angry at you only because they act cold.

If it were me, personally, I'd have to meet up with the ex for closure.  I'd need to bring up the fact that we had talked about those things and that being ""uncomfortable"" when friends teased them about them is kind of a shitty excuse for a break up.  I'd need to know if they were lying to me when we talked about those long-term plans, or if they are lying about the real reason for breaking up.  It might be that they have no real good reason for breaking up and are using it as an excuse, but even so, I'd rather know that their feelings had changed if that was the real reason.  But, that's me.  If you feel the same, then you have to meet with them.  If you'd rather close the door and never open it again, then you need to not meet with them.

It's happened to me before -- some joke about commitment and (irrationally) my entire life flashes before my eyes -- all the opportunities I'll miss, all the options in my life that are cut off.  My commitment aversion is actually a product of relationship trauma in my past, but I won't get into that too deeply. The main point is I felt completely stuck in a relationship that was abusive. It took my months to build up the courage to get out of it, and during it I came the closest to depression I've ever come in my life. The thought of being in that position again terrifies me.  There is now a point in every relationship I have -- and I've learned to expect it --  a minor commitment panic attack. I can't prevent it, but I do try and make the most out of it -- I can't always do it.  If he just freaked and made a dumb mistake (we all do -- I have) -- and he is willing to explain exactly what happened and why it was a mistake (and you believe him) -- it may make sense to give him one chance.  The other possibility is that he's been brewing for a while and this is an excuse.  This would be indicative of other problems in the relationship (lack of communication/trust etc.) and in that case it would probably be better to just move on. If this is the case, as an INFJ, I imagine you know already and just haven't been willing to accept it up to now."
infj,3cbiuz,Puffling_,2,Mon Jul 6 18:07:27 2015 UTC,"The other possibility is that he's been brewing for a while and this is an excuse.

I would ask and clear up the misunderstanding/assumptions/etc.. Communication, regardless of what happens in the end, brings personal peace."
infj,3catcr,dandy-lionn,8,Mon Jul 6 13:32:27 2015 UTC,I do feel like this. Sometimes it plays into the INFJ “Nobody understands me” thing which can turn into a bit of a hot button if what I’m trying to get across is important to me. Other times it’s a sign that my emotional batteries are running low and I’m just not coping with life as well as I would like to be.  Then I either need to withdraw and take care of myself or spend time with my inner trusted circle of people having low pressure fun.
infj,3catcr,Demomaroo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:11:32 2015 UTC,"I can dig that. Letting off a little steam, or taking a break (even just a brain break) usually helps."
infj,3catcr,BygonesBeByeGone,4,Mon Jul 6 17:01:59 2015 UTC,"YES. However, what I've learned by practicing improv and realizing how it translates to real life over the last couple years, is that often, I'm not being clear with my words. I'll think that I am, but when I think about it from the other person's perspective, I'm either not deconstructing my complicated thought patterns enough, or I'm dancing around what I really mean because I don't want to hurt someone's feelings/I feel selfish by asking for something I need.  My therapist says that being assertive is HARD:  H - Honest A - Appropriate R - Respectful  D - Direct   If any of those are missing, it's not assertive.   I also try to call to mind what the other person is going through, if I know what they're dealing with in their life at the moment. If I don't, I make something up to evoke sympathy and gain some patience, because we've all got our baggage."

I saw my ex out with a group of girls shortly after we broke up. I told him off in a stellar fashion in the email. He knows he screwed me over and disrespected my entire family and that's why I dumped him. So I claimed some local bars as ""mine"" in the email and told him to go elsewhere.   Next time he saw my best friend in a bar, I wasn't  even there, he hightailed it out of there like the coward he is. She would have given him the death stare and he can't  handle any amount of conflict.   No regrets. Do I recommend it to others?? Eh...depends on the situation."

infj,3cbp06,Teacupbunny,2,Tue Jul 7 02:55:02 2015 UTC,Nearly our whole relationship he never wanted to go out and do anything fun. He was always tired and went to bed at grandpa time. Then suddenly he's out with a group of college girls 10 years younger than us? My reasoning was quit acting like you are young and hip when I really know you're  a crotchety tired old 31 year old.   Ass.
infj,3cbp06,joantheunicorn,3,Tue Jul 7 03:08:22 2015 UTC,"Depending on the relationship, five months isn't any time at all. Write the letter to help you continue your journey, but think long and hard before sending it.  I definitely think having a good relationship with an ex is possible, but every situation is different. Remember that this is someone you once decided that you needed to completely cut out of your life for your own benefit. How many future problems do you really foresee stemming from this?"
infj,3cbp06,mynewaltaccount,2,Mon Jul 6 20:53:36 2015 UTC,"I've written a few letters but I never sent them. I was in the other boat though - he dumped me and I had fantasies of how sending this heart-wrenching sob story would make him turn around and take me back. I am so thankful I never sent those letters - it would have been mortifying. However more than anything those letters helped me verbalise everything I was feeling, the experience I went through and it was a positive and cathartic thing for me to do. Gave me my own form of closure within myself."
infj,3cbp06,jenayvo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:57:50 2015 UTC,"I actually did this as well after a 5 year relationship. I never expected a response, but I never really had a chance to express my true feelings on the subject and I just needed to let them be known as a form of closure for myself. There wasn't any expectation of getting back together. The letter ended up being 10 typed pages and was very respectful. Actually, had her parents look at it before I left it for her.  In the long run, it helped me more than anything, I felt more comfortable knowing that I put it out there for her to know. I just didn't want those thoughts to be swirling around my head anymore."
infj,3cbp06,My3rdLeg,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:34:37 2015 UTC,"I have done it. One ex profusely apologized and had no idea how much he hurt me (we had a short-term involvement).  Another probably was pissed off, when he receieved it. It has helped me, but it's important to know that they may not respond how you want.  I think if you see them again in the future, it might be awkward."

I mean yeah I'll flirt and hint about sexual things if I get the feeling it's appropriate, but it seems like your female INFJ wasn't getting your strongly uncomfortable signals.   Have you thought about fighting fire with fire and being extremely vocal with how she makes you feel when she does that? It accomplishes two things at once."
infj,3cc1d5,Demomaroo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:28:31 2015 UTC,"This was discussed. We haven't spoken. I think she is looking for someone that can text her all day, and talk about dating/relationships. I can't fulfill that right now. I would prefer to keep my love life private to most."

I think this is probably the case. The last time I was at a party I was cornered by one and was pretty much interrogated at a distressingly close distance. She was very friendly and fun, but also like a juggernaut charging through a series of personal boundaries without slowing. Someone else mentioned that she had been relentlessly grilled by the same woman when seated next to her at dinner. It's definitely not the case for all of them, but I've personally experienced it."

infj,3cc1d5,Skeletress,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:11:30 2015 UTC,"I have never seen that in an INFJ, but remember that it's a series of scales. A person could be seriously introverted and be an INFJ or only a little and still considered INFJ. Maybe she is more moderate in some of her function. In my experience INFJ empathy keeps us from doing that sort of thing unless we, for some reason, get it into our heads that it is the thing that person really needs. It doesn't sound like you knew her well enough for her to be making that kind of call. I'm sorry she hit you in your trauma history. That is seriously rough."
infj,3cc1d5,Skeletress,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:29:32 2015 UTC,"I suspect she might be an ENFJ, since she was the type that wanted to text all day. She says she has tested as INFJ multiple times, and doesn't seem to have anyone else to talk to. I had to tell her that daily texting isn't my thing. Later, I did say ""Wow, all of these personal topics are triggering.  I feel guilty.""  I should have done a better job at stopping the questions when they were coming. We haven't spoken since, but I'm okay with that. I need some alone time right now."
infj,3cc1d5,Skeletress,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:44:43 2015 UTC,Understandable. And when and if you do speak to her you'll be better equip to deal with it. If I try to deal with things like this before I've had some time I usually just make it worse.

Hans Zimmer, especially Gladiator is my classic concentration soundtrack. And as for Sigur Rós I don't even now what to say. Just amazing. I've seen them live too and it made me love them even more. Has been my favorite band for years!  I'm always listening to something, especially when I'm studying.   Cinematic Orcestra is weird, mesmerizing and often instrumental so it's good for studying.  Portugal. The Man is one of my favorites too. Not always the best concentration music but I like to listen to them when I need some boost.  Asaf Avidan has a unique voice and I just love it. Good relax music.  Also, The Tallest Man On Earth  Alexandre Desplat  Mika  2CELLOS  And that was just some examples, my list could be endless!"

They're some of my favorites, but when I'm trying to concentrate on work, I have to listen to something more ambient or something I'm not terribly familiar with - otherwise, my brain puts too much energy on the music. I love to chill to solo piano artists like Christopher O'Riley or George Winston ... and Rhye is fantastic. Ben Howard, too. Some of Moby's albums, like Wait for Me, are perfect. But mostly, I need silence!"
infj,3c9lcp,giotheflow,3,Mon Jul 6 06:24:14 2015 UTC,"I will second George Winston and Rhye. The former for many years of inspiration when I could get my hands on a piano- whether they're the aging decades old rustic beauties on Catalina Island, or in an sound isolated performing room beneath a college building. The latter, because the music videos to Open and The Fall are deeply moving. And the gender realization for the singer switched on a nostalgia lightbulb to figuring out Tracy Chapman...  Silence is lovely. During long drives or road trips it keeps me sane as much if not more than the audiobooks and music."

Any way you could continue them now with a method where you could meet other people? (Enjoy drawing? Go take a drawing class- etc.)  The other posters have really good ideas re: ending this loneliness. I don't have much to offer, but know I sympathize with you 10000%"

infj,3c86ch,Cindifrid,2,Sun Jul 5 21:17:17 2015 UTC,Upvotes for the hearty laughs   TAKE THEM!!@@@
infj,3c86ch,Cindifrid,6,Sun Jul 5 21:45:43 2015 UTC,"It seems ""getting involved with your interests"" is a common line of advice, but I don't feel that my personal interests were even much of a contributing factor for my friendships before... I held student leadership positions in college that fed me a constant flow of people to interact with. Those positions had nothing to do with my interests in consumable media, fitness, cooking, etc and those interests have literally never led me into meeting someone new.  Right now I go for runs every single day, I lift weights in my own home, I cook creative things frequently, I do other common introvert things like read, watch shows, and dig into hours of new music.  It feels as if I might need to force myself into some kind of new, more social hobby. I have no idea what that might be, though..."
infj,3c86ch,Cindifrid,5,Sun Jul 5 21:58:13 2015 UTC,"Funny that you bring up the fitness aspect- I was just talking about this with my mom during a drive back from our relatives' house. One of our friends met her husband through her spinning class.   Fitness classes may be a great way to meet people...? And as awkward as it might feel at first, I met -tons- of people going swing-dancing during undergrad. The swing community as a whole is pretty friendly.  Try to look for places that have ""dance-nights"" with free lessons beforehand, that's when a lot of the socializing happens."
infj,3c86ch,BygonesBeByeGone,3,Sun Jul 5 22:00:27 2015 UTC,"I love yoga, but that isn't very social -- probably part why I like it. Dancing? Hm... That's interesting. How does that work as someone who goes at it alone?"
infj,3c86ch,7sshare,5,Sun Jul 5 22:15:20 2015 UTC,"In my experience, there's typically lots of singles that go to dance classes and they pair you up upon your arrival during lessons. Oftentimes, they switch your partner periodically so that you meet more people (whom you can ask to dance with you later.)   When looking for classes, be sure to look for the catch-phrases ""no partner required"" or ""singles welcomed."""
infj,3c86ch,Chaseshaw,5,Sun Jul 5 22:24:11 2015 UTC,"This is a terrifying, yet intriguing possibility... I will consider it!"
infj,3c86ch,shinbum,15,Sun Jul 5 23:11:25 2015 UTC,"While I agree it's probably harder for INFJ's to make friends after we're done matriculating with people in school because of the reasons you listed (as a woman I often loathe when men introduce themselves to me at bars when I'm trying to hang out with friends), I think this is definitely an adjustment that everyone has to make after they graduate college. What are some of your interests? The best thing I ever did for myself was to sign up for improv classes. I met a lot of people like me and enjoy a rich social life thanks to that community. Try taking whatever classes speak to you, or joining a book club, or something like that!"
infj,3c86ch,shinbum,7,Sun Jul 5 20:30:26 2015 UTC,"OP, I am in exactly the same boat. I am also one year out of a questionable grad school experience and I have a hard time imagining a happy future. Loneliness just seems so inevitable. It is the elusive ""friend group"" which I desire but feel unable to obtain, mostly because of my socially disastrous desire to possess said friend group. I don't have any advice. Just commiseration."

infj,3c86ch,SilkenSails,5,Mon Jul 6 02:12:50 2015 UTC,INTJ here-- same problems. How I coped:  a good church  a book club (that covered material that was genuinely interesting to me)  community college classes (they're cheap and a good way to learn fun / stupid things like painting or whatever)  make friends at work / from [above] of the ENF-flavor and crash whatever they're doing from time to time
infj,3c86ch,meecho02,4,Sun Jul 5 21:15:25 2015 UTC,"I had the same thought and was too afraid, so I chose grad school. :/ Hopefully I'll find somebody over at New York City..."
infj,3c86ch,SilkenSails,4,Mon Jul 6 00:58:18 2015 UTC,"I'm currently one year out from grad school, it didn't help and it's probably one of my biggest life regrets thus far. Make sure you're going for the right reasons."
infj,3c86ch,meecho02,3,Mon Jul 6 01:13:20 2015 UTC,I will keep that in mind. Thank you. I'm sorry I couldn't be of help but received help.
infj,3c86ch,SilkenSails,5,Mon Jul 6 01:14:58 2015 UTC,"I experienced this too. I'm 31 now.  If you want to understand why this happened (from my perspective, wise and biased if I don't say so myself): it may be because a person is attached to their identity, or ego, or false self. The twenty something, college age or fresh out of college (recent grad). Well, at some point you aren't going to be that ""recent-grad"". It's going to creep up on you. Here's the news, you aren't your ego, you aren't your identity. But who are you if you aren't your identity? What you are is much more beautiful, much more amazing than that.   If you want to learn how to cope, how to learn from this experience, I suggest reading lots of books. Books are tools. A person has put a lot of time and effort into writing a -- months or years, and that's after experiencing all they've experienced. I could recommend at least 30 books that have helped me in the last 2 years. But i can't tell you what to read until I know what you want to learn, e.g. What specific problem are you grappling with right now?   If you want to know what to do, well there's infinite things you can do, but more than likely they are going to distract you from what's really bothering you (because you aren't interested in bars and clubs, I am inferring you are on a path that realizes it's just another distraction.)   Finally, the absolute most beneficial thing I did to help myself was to take a meditation course. Specifically, a vipassana meditation course as taught by S. N. Goenka. You can learn about it via videos on YouTube or checking out dhamma.org. It was the hardest 10 days of my life yet most rewarding as well.   Best of luck."
infj,3c86ch,jeff233,2,Mon Jul 6 07:54:26 2015 UTC,I've been trying to read more to sort out my own issues much of which are INFJ and social anxiety-related. Mind if I mooch off of this thread and ask if you have any recommendations? :)
infj,3c86ch,infjtoday,5,Mon Jul 6 14:30:19 2015 UTC,"Second OP, you're not mooching. It's hard to make specific recommendations without knowing your situation, what you perceive the problem to be, etc. But I was considering creating a course to help others the way I've been helped in the last few years by these books, or as I consider them, these ""tools.""

I especially need to work on esteem issues, breaking negative thought patterns, and being more mindful of my present surroundings so these all seem like they can help. I have the MBTI personality book and love it :) definitely a good recommendation."

Especially if it leads to us figuring something out!  I would also like some book recommendations. I actually had come to the conclusion that reading books could be very helpful, but I struggled to find any that didn't seem pop-science-y or like cheap cash grabs. I know that ""finding myself"" is one of the bigger things I need to be working on, I just don't want to waste too much time going in the wrong direction -- I feel I've done that plenty already."

infj,3c86ch,aalitheaa,3,Wed Jul 8 10:57:51 2015 UTC,I think it is generally a struggle for INFJs of any age to make meaningful connections.

I mean I am in my thirties but I have that INFJ urge to grow and learn how to successfully find a partner and forge a deeper connection to others.

Some groups meet regularly and have core members, so you'll get to know people through repeated meetings, but you'll also get a chance to continually meet new people too.   I definitely recommend it.

infj,3c952w,7sshare,4,Mon Jul 6 01:35:18 2015 UTC,"One thing I do -- usually when I'm driving and thinking -- is contemplate the idea that reincarnation is real and that after each life, we have the opportunity to choose what our next life will be like. I.e., I ask myself, ""What if I chose this life?"" It's an interesting mental exercise, and it gives me some perspective."
infj,3c952w,below_the_line,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:16:46 2015 UTC,"Huh interesting. I've never seen any reason, factually or intuitively, to believe in reincarnation, but I guess belief doesn't really matter for this exercise. Or maybe it does? Here's how it goes for me:  What if I chose this life? Well, I didn't, reincarnation is a fanciful idea, a creation of the human mind to ward off the fear of an existentially meaningless existence. For all that I can tell, anyway, that's what it is. Maybe other people have seen a larger truth and know something I don't. But for me right now there is no reason to believe in it. But does it matter if reincarnation is 'real' or not, if the idea helps me get through my life with greater ease? Well personally I find it difficult to latch onto an idea that I feel to be untrue, even if I know it will help me. Regardless of my beliefs...if I chose this life on purpose, I chose one horribly pained and self-defeating head to inhabit, so why would I have done that? Do I need to atone for something in a past life? Is it my lot to suffer because I deserve it? Is that what my life comes to? But this atonement probably does not entail a lifetime of suffering. After all, what could someone do that is so bad to deserve a lifetime of suffering chosen on purpose? Especially one of my past selves, because in this life I'm pretty harmless. It is more likely that if I chose to suffer horribly, it is because this suffering is meant to cleanse and purge me of some spiritual fault - hubris, narcissism, solipsism. Can I give up and let myself be purged by my own suffering? This is probably what needs to happen.  Huh."
infj,3c952w,below_the_line,2,Mon Jul 6 17:12:03 2015 UTC,"Mine usually goes something like this: Why would I have chosen to live my life alone? Maybe in my last life I had a complicated love life or a devastating loss, and I chose something more simple this time. Or maybe I had a wonderful marriage and chose to honor it by living this life without. Or maybe I've had all those experiences, and this time around I wanted to find out what it was like to live alone. Or, hell, maybe I have a soulmate I've been with through the ages, and I won't be with him until our lives sync up again.   It's not so much about changing myself. It's more about feeling as if someone with my best interests at heart (me) had some say in the various events of my life that don't feel as if they're under my control. Even if it's all imaginary."
infj,3c952w,Demomaroo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:15:56 2015 UTC,I just wish this kind of thinking could hit me with that kind of impact you're talking about that gives you a new perspective. The harder I try to change myself the less likely I seem to be able to change anything.
infj,3c952w,Demomaroo,2,Mon Jul 6 23:36:25 2015 UTC,Have a plan for the things you can change. Protect that plan because INFJ is bad at that and will let the needs of others derail them. Realize that you can only stretch yourself so far and triage view of your goals. Some of them are not going to survive and you have to spend your strength on the ones that will.

infj,3c9r5e,yeahsureokayetc,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:13:53 2015 UTC,"First of all, welcome!  To both this community and the interesting world of MBTI.  A quick rundown of the MBTI:   It is your core.  It doesn't change, and it's what you naturally gravitate to without the use of anything that may alter your mind chemistry.  Think of it like your dominant hand--left handed people can become very good at using their right hand, even to the point where someone familar with them may see them write so flawlessly with their non-dominant hand that they believe the right hand is the dominant one, but it's not and it never will be, because it will never feel as comfortable as using their left hand. Extroversion vs Introversion:  This relates to how you gather your energy.  Extroverts get energy and feel buzzed being around people.  Introverts give their energy to others and need alone time to recharge.  At a party, an extrovert will go and go and go, and at the end of the party they will need to wind down so they can sleep, because they're buzzing from being around so many people.  An introvert starts to feel mentally and physically exhausted by the end of the party and desparately needs to crash and be alone so they can refuel. Sensing vs iNtuition:  This relates to how you gather your information.  Sensors are deeply rooted in the physical world, and prefer to gather information based off of what's in front of them--what they can see, hear, feel, smell and taste.  They are very, very good at being in the moment.  iNtuitives live in their heads.  They gather information from the impressions they get in their environment.  They prefer to think through problems rather than work through them physically.  They read between the lines, and enjoy working with abstract theories and would rather conceptualise future events. Feeling vs Thinking:  How you make a decision based on the information you have received from Sensing/iNtuition.  Let me preface this by saying Feelers think and Thinkers feel, it's just that feelings don't factor in to a Thinkers decision and the black-and-white bottom line doesn't factor in to a Feelers decision.  The best example I can come up for this one is if a company is going under.  A Feeler would do their best to minimise redundancies and loss of assets, even if it means it takes the company an additional five years to recover.  A Thinker will make the necessary cuts to get back in black as quickly as possible.  That doesn't mean that the Thinker doesn't feel bad about losing those people or assets, or that the Feeler hasn't considered the impact that retaining them will have on the company as a whole--it just doesn't factor in to the final decision. Judging vs Perceiving:  This is how you deal with the outside world.  Judgers need order and organisation in their life, and Perceivers need spontaniety.  Say there's a last-minute change of plans.  A Perceiver will just go with the flow without so much as a ruffle of their feathers.  A Judger will be thrown for a loop, unless they've planned to have plans change and mentally prepared themselves for a deviation from the original set order.   Here's a good intro to the basics of MBTI.  When considering these options, remember that this is in relation to who you are at the core, and what feels most comfortable to you in your natural state."
infj,3c9r5e,Intempestivity,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:53:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for writing all that, but it didn't help me enough unfortunately. I know the functions and types so well that I realize that there's 20 different sites with 20 different explanations without any clue which description is the right one.  Based on what I've shared, where can I go from there? How do I find the answer?"
infj,3c9r5e,Intempestivity,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:03:30 2015 UTC,"Well, the site I linked to is the Myers Briggs Foundation, so I'd start there.  I've had an official test administered by a registered practitioner, and I can say that the information on that site is accurate with regards to what the MBTI actually is and how the functions and types work.  The statements they use to illustrate the particular nuances of each function are similar to the true/false agree/disagree statements used on the actual test.  And if you'r desparate to know your type, find a registered practitioner and take the official test.  Again, the site I linked to has resources for that, because they train and certify people in MBTI--so it's probably the best resource you're going to find on the internet."
infj,3c9r5e,Intempestivity,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:58:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I do appreciate that you're trying to help. :)   It doesn't feel like my problem is not knowing the functions well enough, but rather that I actually just don't know myself enough. Like, even if I did ""the official test"", it'll probably not be accurate since I don't know what I really do vs what I think I'm doing.  I've taken at least 10 different tests (including the 16-personalities) at least 10 times each. 100 tests and they all give me different results. I've gotten the following more than once: INFJ, ENFJ, INTP, ENTP, ISFJ, ESFJ, INFP, ENFP.   Do you see how confusing that is to me? I thought knowing the functions better would help, and it did. I narrowed it down to INFJ and ENTP, but because I don't actually fully understand myself, I don't know how to be certain. I constantly feel like I'm switching back and forth in between them. It doesn't help that I'm not healthy right now (and I haven't been for quite some time), because the descriptions and videos generally portray types when they're healthy, which leads to more uncertainty. ""Who do I truly enjoy being? What do I actually enjoy to do? What would my life be like if I could do whatever I want? How do I actually think and work when I'm calm and comfortable?""  That's why I wrote the post and the text I linked to as well. It's basically ""hey this is a glimpse of me, what does this mean?""   I don't want to come across as not appreciating your help, but the thing is that I wouldn't have posted here if I felt like I could find the answer myself. If I know how to get the answer, that's what I'm pursuing. At first I thought I could find it by knowing MBTI better, that didn't solve it so it's on to the next step, use all my knowledge to summarise myself and ask other people who might know more than me. I need a second opinion basically.   I've already tried the route you're suggesting; I'm getting to the point where even if I read everything there is to read, it won't matter because I still don't even know myself. Regardless of my internal knowledge, I'll never be able to figure it out without external assistance.   I'm asking for help because I'm at my wits end. :)"

The best thing about INFJ girls is that if you tell them how you feel and they don't agree, they will never put you down for showing emotion and being truthful, because that's some of the qualities we admire most. Take the leap and tell her how you feel!   Also, my boyfriend is an INFP/J, so if that makes you feel any more comfortable.. :)"

I wish you the best of luck with her regardless of whether you share romance or friendship in the future.    I saw your post about communicating this stuff to her and her response that seemed disinterested- How do you know she isn't interested? Could you elaborate a bit on that?   Personally, as an INFJ I would feel really nervous if someone wanted to 'worship me like a goddess' because that amount of attention feels odd but just spending time with her and being open to discussing the things you are BOTH passionate about will strengthen your relationship. Quality time > nearly everything else"

I bet you can make her day by telling her you admire that in her * :)  Possibly on topic: I have a friend who is quite creative, who once told me her thoughts about me through a song. I was flabbergasted and super flattered (even though there was also a component of 'do you even know what you're doing' in there :D ). Perhaps, if you feel like airing your feelings to her, you can draw on your own talents to do it in a creative way. But just telling is also fine.  . * ..if you're honest about the romantic part. If not, things might be more complicated, obviously ;)"

And supports all my ""missions"" I go on. A lot of your post made me smile because it has some tones of our dynamic as well.  I am definitely the planner out of the 2 of us. Sometimes we refer to it jokingly as I'm being ""bossy"". Really I can be quite bossy when I want to, but I try to be conscious of not running him over emotionally. I find the key is giving him time and space to process, and not demand that he come up with an answer right now. This is hard for me because I often I have several plans for any one event and I may overwhelm him in the process of offering so many choices.  As far as mothering I do enjoy taking care of him, cooking for him and doing things around the house. He does the same for me by taking care of yard work so I try to show my appreciation by doing other household tasks. We try to be even in distributing mundane household tasks and do a pretty decent job of appreciating each other. We have the same expectation as far as cleanliness level so that helps a lot living together.   I am a ""grab the bull by the horns"" type person so I smiled when you wrote that sort of thing about her. I firmly believe we get one shot at life and you have to create the life you want, as opposed to letting life ""happen to you"" and I do realize now this flies in the face of the way some INFPs operate. I have an almost insatiable thirst for ""something more"", having purpose with my life. Sometimes I think this INFJ/INFP combo can get frustrated based on that and breakdowns in communication. He teaches me to slow down and live in the moment and bit more which has helped me relax considerably since we started dating.   He is definitely a ""go with the flow"" type, but sometimes (IMO) life just requires a decision. Seemingly black and white decisions that I have no emotional attachment to, I just want a damn answer so I can plan the rest of the food/transport/etc. drive me especially bonkers: ex. ""Are we going to my parent's place or your parent's place for Thanksgiving?"" He will put such decisions off for weeks. He has definitely expressed that it is good for him to get out of his ""comfort zone"" and have to make decisions about things or plan. Long range planning is something we are working hard on. I would like to relocate to a bigger city as a couple in the next 1-2 years and so I have already begun planning the beginning stages with him because I know it will be a much slower, more difficult process for him.   In the spirit of grabbing the bull by the horns, I would say go for it and tell her more how you feel, but you may be weighing that over the loss of a friendship. So I realize this may not be right for you. However, it is so infrequently that we run into such love in our lives that it can be so tempting just to give it a try. He presented it to me by simply stating he would like me to be a bigger part of his life and it worked out great. I was scared, but if there is one thing I can say about my INFP is that he is loyal and he is a man of his word. This is exactly what I need."

infj,3c7q5f,catsidy_,5,Sun Jul 5 18:01:24 2015 UTC,"I'm with an ENTP currently. As much as I'd love to talk to my ENTP, I feel this sense that I need to give him his space so I shouldn't bother him with small details about my life. I feel as though your INFJ might be doing the same thing. He views you as someone extremely independent and does not want to smother you.  As INFJs (with well-developed Ti), if we do have an emotional problem we will want to address that with ourselves first to find out if that specific emotion is internal or reality-based. How we feel heavily impacts our view on things in terms of relationships but we ultimately understand feelings are our own.  Though I am female, sometimes I do wish my ENTP would spend more time with me. I've given him a lot of space and lately it feels like the amount of space has been widening. I haven't addressed this with him yet because I don't want to sound desperate for his attention which I am. This morning actually I think I exploded and sent him a spam of ""I miss you"" etc texts after a few days of not seeing him (though we do text back and forth every few hours or so between doing our own things). He said ""Good,"" etc which is funny.  I feel like I've put myself in a position where I'm too afraid to ask for more of his time because I've come from emotionally dependent relationships where I was too clingy and I don't want to ruin this. This is the first healthy relationship I've had where he's nurtures my independence and creates an atmosphere where our statements must be rational.  If I look at this situation rationally, he speaks to me on a daily basis, a few texts here or there. We see each other couple times a week. I see that he cares but I don't see it from an emotional standpoint. He doesn't talk out loud about feelings with me and I think that's what I feel is truly missing. The gap that I feel isn't time and space per se, but it is an emotional one.   How do I address the silence to find out what he's thinking?   You're trying to find out what he's thinking. Tell him how you're feeling. Give him something he can work with then he will address and reciprocate.   As a less emotional person, what are some tips for making sure I'm meeting his emotional needs in general?   His emotional need is knowing how you feel (Fe). That makes him feel connected to you. I'm sure he understands that you're not one to be excessively emotional, but it is still a need that INFJs tend to have. You can talk about yourself, we are natural listeners. Tell him you've been feeling tension lately and you're not sure why, it'll trigger his Fe to ask why or explain.  Hope this helps."
infj,3c7q5f,demesure,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:39:08 2015 UTC,"This is incredibly helpful on so many levels. Thank you for your input! Do you find yourself wishing that he would bring up his emotions with you? If so, would you prefer for him to bring it up, or would you ask if you wanted to know? (I suppose in short, how straight-forward are you about your needs?)"
infj,3c7q5f,demesure,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:35:14 2015 UTC,"Because I understand that he doesn't bring up his emotions, I'm more reluctant to ask if not at all. It would be random to do so in relation to our dynamics. ""How do you feel, about this, us, in general?"" just doesn't seem to fit because I've learned to judge how he feels through his actions in order to compensate my needs. Though I have asked him how he feels about me/us once or twice, he's mostly dumbfounded at such a ""profound"" question. He doesn't know right away nor does he seem like he wants to find the words to describe what he feels. ""I like us"" seems to summarize it. Feelings are stagnant for him and things are always ""good."" I guess it's a stability I appreciate in contrast to my emotional volatility. I would still like him to tell me how he feels from time to time, even if it's the same answer, but it's not something I want to impose on him. We like our autonomy. We do things because we want to do them.  In a sense, I'm putting his needs before mine which is causing me so much internal conflict. Your post has really made me self-reflect. Maybe I should re-evaluate my approach on this or maybe it's not a serious issue worth addressing."
infj,3c7q5f,demesure,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:01:04 2015 UTC,"I can definitely sense the internal conflict you mentioned. As an INFJ, as far as my research is concerned, perhaps it would help you emotionally to write him a letter. Whether or not you give it to him is less important than the fact that you need to process your perspective on this subject. Knowing what you think and how you feel is never a bad thing, so more self-reflection couldn't hurt. I wouldn't view it as a serious issue at the moment, but based on past experiences, it could become one if unexpressed emotion builds up unhealthily over time. Feel free to allow your reply to be your outlet. (Sorry for the advice if you're not wanting it. If I see an issue of any sort and I think I can help, I do. ENTJ for the win, right?)"
infj,3c7q5f,MemoriesOfSelf,2,Mon Jul 6 13:54:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your help ENTJ :)  I know unexpressed emotion can build up, I won't ever let it get to that. We're very open in communication so my SO would address my concerns. Even if I didn't say anything, he would eventually pick up on it. Writing things down has helped in me in the past in processing my feelings.  But this whole thing I like because it teaches me how to handle something different. Yes I'm uncomfortable somewhat, but you gotta get out of your comfort zone to try a different approach and soon it'll be in your comfort zone right? Even now, as I'm looking at his actions, it fortifies his care a lot more than temporary words. This is something new and refreshing to me.  Anywho, best of luck to your new relationship! It's gonna be a thrill to learn about each other and your different approaches. As long as you two have your eyes set on what's important, you'll get through everything."
infj,3c7q5f,MemoriesOfSelf,6,Wed Jul 8 00:26:01 2015 UTC,"ENTJ! ENTJ's are interesting, if not intense. In this sense, their drive and the can-do-and-do are very important to INFJ's, I think.  1) This depends on how long the silences are. Often I need a black door and to stare at it, while my mind works through millions of things that bother me under the sea level of my awareness. Unfortunately, it's hard to develop skill to get better at this, so he might require a bit of understanding and space on your behalf. There also may be something he doesn't want to dump on you and working through it alone. You might want to insist on that you don't mind for him to share (if you do, of course).  2) Let him know that you are emotionally blind(er). Try to play a game with him, when every now and then you ask each other, out of the blue, how the other feels. This might help both of you to get on the same page of what to expect from another. Additionally, mention that he should tell you if he feels that you are missing something and you will do the same. INFJ's like mind reading, but defer to directness. Also, I, for one, sometimes can't decide how I feel (in general), so there might be a bit of confusion.  3) Try to avoid running over him when you are on a mission; healing is not fast for INFJ's. As a side note, it happens that while we really appreciate solutions, at times it's not about the nail.  All of the above is just my point of view and his views might be very different!  EDIT: I must add that I do not think ENTJ's are somehow emotionally handicapped. I do think that ENTJ-INFJ relationship requires certain level of maturity and development of the respective inferior cognitive functions, but, as an example, I'm not completely oblivious to my surroundings (Se), although I can be clumsy at times, although it's developed, so I believe an ENTJ is well aware of the product of their Fe.

If he's choosing not to talk to me at all at the moment (not in an angry way, he's just avoiding me from what I can tell, which is very out of character for him), do you think it would be wise to try to ask him questions or rather to back off for a little while until he talks to me?"

The idea of having full autonomy is enticing, but the reality of it is much more stress from that unstable paycheck, and having to handle everything (hate dealing with minor details), that I rather not have.

You can't strong-arm a company by showing it how much you need it. Reddit hasn't been listening to the cries of its user and this situation was able to convey the exact problem. Even if all subs were to go private, there is still a large user base.  When enough users leave and Reddit knows this is serious. It'll go into damage control, and maybe the people will come back.

It's not like people come to those decisions on a schedule ;).    Seems to me like you have two choices: First, you tell her honestly how you feel -- that you don't think that you want a purely sexual situation because you are looking for something more substantial and see how she reacts.   If she thinks you're honestly serious about a relationship, maybe that will be enough to nudge her forward.   Or you  move on. Now that I'm middle aged, I have come to the conclusion that any situation that may cause extra pain or drama in life is really not worth it.    Good luck, I do hope you figure it out :)."
infj,3c68dt,Acerophobe,2,Sun Jul 5 05:58:27 2015 UTC,"OP from what you've told us, you seem to be wrestling between an understanding of what you truly want vs. making the girl you're interested in happy and banking on the hope that it could lead to more.   Might I suggest that you can liken it to someone not having a job at your company and still asking you for a paycheck. Sex, at least for me, is something physical deeply connected to the emotional and spiritual. One without the other makes it little more than a shell, and if you're like me, that would wring me dry. But again, I'm one INFJ out of many. You may be different, so take my two cents for what it's worth."
infj,3c68dt,augustusprime,2,Sun Jul 5 06:19:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not gonna tell you what to do because I think either way you'll learn something about yourself moving forward. So think of it something like this...  If you decide you want to try and be with her with the hope that maybe she'll want to move forward into a real relationship, you could be wrong and she'll move on as you crave more emotional connection. Of course, there's ways you can slow the process, but seeing as you've already heard that she's into you I have a hard time imagining you not craving more. This path leads to pain, obviously. But good things can happen along the way.  It could also turn out how you hope and she develops stronger feelings for you. That's also a possibility, but I don't know her so that's up to you to think about.   The last option is the hardest imo. Walking away from this now is our way of protecting ourselves from potentially getting hurt. It will still hurt, but you and her will be able to move on and search for someone who can fulfill your immediate desires much better.   I'm a bit tired, but hopefully that makes sense and helps solidify your thoughts. I'm sure there's more options available, I just don't know enough. You're definitely best suited to judge your ability to handle the potential outcomes. Good luck sir, I wish you the best."

Girls tend to show up when you're focusing on being true to yourself and being creative, productive and passionate.   Ive fucked a lot of girls. I dont remember most of their names and I wish I hadn't been so cruel to them or so cheap with my own body. Ask yourself if you want the physical side of the emotional connection.

infj,3c5ggq,lykke_lis_tears,2,Sun Jul 5 02:47:54 2015 UTC,"In my experience, the best I ever felt was when I didn't have sex or masturbated in a long period of time, read 3+ months to half a year. The serenity was almost overwhelming. Our physiology, to my understanding, forces us to seek mates to procreate IF you are experiencing and satisfying the arousal. However, when this feedback loop is broken (consciously or due to circumstances), and after a little while it takes for chemical/hormonal storms to subside, you enter a sort of a plateau that lacks horny episodes. But, every now and then during your sleep your brain may remind you that you have genitals, but as long it's contained in your sleep only, you will not 'break the cycle'.  This needs to be a conscious decision.  P.S. Incidentally, I had this aforementioned experience when I was 24, I think.   P.P.S If you think you can school yourself to avoid attachments, and don't mind parties, maybe go for casual sex?"

At that stage you don't see much difference between males and females in terms of inherent values (gosh, does it sound sexist, but that's true; perhaps because it's, too, subconscious), you don't expect anything from anyone and take them for their actions. You stop checking out others and people look much more beautiful in general, as if the fog is gone.    In regard to how people treat you... well, your behavior does change a little bit: I became more grounded. As a result people do react to you slightly differently (in a good way different), as if you are infused with something...

In our society, that's usually a holdover from some pretty unhealthy, convoluted Victorian values.   Guilt is ""I have done something bad;"" shame is ""I am bad because of what I have done."" It's good you can feel shame--it means you're not a sociopath. However, masturbation shouldn't be something that elicits either of these feelings. It is natural and healthy. It is a time you can freely explore your sexuality, let your mind wander, and really enjoy yourself.   There is nothing intrinsically wrong with casual sex, but it sounds like it is not right for you right now. If you feel shame after masturbating, you will almost definitely feel even more after casual sex. This would be a disservice to you and your FWB.   Again, I can't stress enough that you need to address your shame first before anything else... even pursuing a relationship. You need to have some idea of who you are and be comfortable with yourself before you can be in a healthy relationship. And trust me, you don't want to be in an unhealthy one.  Also, once/if you are in a relationship, you shouldn't give up masturbation. That's you time. Sex with yourself and sex with others fulfill two different psychological needs.  Personally, I've tried casual sex, but it wasn't for me. I had some good experiences, but I was always looking for something more. I've tried NoFap, and it definitively wasn't for me. Sure, there was a calmness after a little while, but I believe it came at the cost of suppressing all of my desires and emotions. This was extremely unhealth and I personally believe it screwed with my sex drive long term. I noticed differences before and after, and I'm not happy with the results. I also stayed in an unhealthy relationship once and got married because we were friends and the sex was amazing. I rushed into that relationship because I'd had a crush on her for years, and I ignored every alarm and warning in my head as the relationship progressed--I wouldn't recommend it.  You're young; you have plenty of time. Just focus on being open and honest with yourself for now, and masturbate all you want. The rest will follow.  Edit: You should watch Brene Brown's TED talks on vulnerability and shame. Also maybe read Models by Mark Manson."
infj,3c5ggq,SureAviator,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:49:07 2015 UTC,"Nope, disliked it. FWB might be better though, actually be able to build some sort of a connection. But casual sex? Just went against my beliefs/values and I always lost a bit of respect for myself each and every time."
infj,3c5ggq,CatWithHands,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:31:56 2015 UTC,"Wow... Im 22, male, infj and I went in the exact opposite direction of most everybody in this thread. I guess most of it for me stems from how I view the relationships I have with other people. To me, it's much more fulfilling to let myself build many close relationships  rather than looking for ""the one"" to pour all my love and affection into. In a way, I have relationships with everybody I meet and I'm happy to let those relationships grow or change overtime as they will, rather than try to control it or set limits for what I can let myself feel or do with another person. Because of that, I've had sex with probably 100ish different people because it's something we both like to do and are comfortable sharing with each other. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy sex and think it can add a new level of closeness between people, but I have very few reservations about what sex should mean in the context of the many varied relationships I'm a part of."

You should never, ever feel bad or ashamed for masturbating. Masturbation is a NATURAL HUMAN BEHAVIOR.  Now as far as casual sex and FWB they can both fulfill your urges but please just use protection for your own health. You can have casual sex & self respect while respecting your partner(s), it just takes some practice. If you play it safe with protection then you can preserve your health for the type of relationship you really want and gain some social skills in the process."
infj,3c5ggq,crassly-cautious,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:08:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not a man, but can identify with what you're saying. If you're not into casual sex, then it's not for you. Some people find it shocking, b/c they're projecting how they would feel.   I think you know how your body is better than anyone else. If you truly feel you would want to leave an FWB, then it's not for you. You deal with excessive horniness by mastubating or focusing your energy elsewhere. There's also the option of finding a girlfriend, like someone said."
infj,3c5vp7,lookforlinda,6,Sun Jul 5 02:55:55 2015 UTC,Yes. Code is art. Data is beautiful :) I enjoy the creative problem solving that programming affords.
infj,3c5vp7,shinepuppy,4,Sun Jul 5 04:07:04 2015 UTC,"I do!  I use SQL for Oracle, Business Objects, Worksmart, Visual Studio and Cognos.  I will be learning Java for more interactivity with Worksmart, and I have a working knowledge of Visual Basic.  Learning code is basically like learning a new langauge.  It drove me crazy for a while, and I had to unpick things over and over to try to understand them--but then one day, it was like the penny dropped and I suddenly could read and write it fluently.  I love that.  The problem solving aspect of coding is really fun and deeply satisfying, and I love learning new tricks as I go along.  I also enjoy the fact that I have a legitimate excuse to shut everyone out for hours.  My team is very supportive, though, so if I need collaboration I can sit down with someone and walk through a piece that's stuck.  I can get frustrated when I get stuck on a problem for days on end and no amount of collaboration has come up with a resolution.  Also, our data tables were slapped up very quickly and had special snowflakes built in to them (WHY?!  Give us everything and let us code the special snowflakes, don't put them directly in the tables!), so searching for the right fields can be a bit of a nightmare.  It's a great sense of relief when that piece of code finally works, or I finally determined that one field out of many thousands that's the correct one I need, but it also is annoying because I could have been doing better things with my time other than trying iteration after iteration to find the one that works.  The one thing I will say, though--if you're learning code and you're not planning on going in to contracting, you really need to research the company you end up working for.  EVERYONE needs programmers now, whether they're massive global conglomerates or small independent businesses.  They need web programmers, they need BI developers and they need analysts.  Make sure you're working for a company that aligns with your values.  I did the same job at a soulless company that didn't care for its employees, and I was truly miserable.  I loved it at first, when I was learning the role and learning how to use the interface and how to make reports that the senior managers wanted to see, but then I reached a point where I was bumping against the ceiling and had no where else to go, I kept getting empty promises from my general manager and HR, and at that point, I started to become disillusioned.  I hated it so much in the end, and I felt so empty--and at first, I thought my actual job was a part of that.  I ended up taking a similar position at a decent-sized non-profit who do a lot of charity work and value their customers and their staff above all else.  My initial thought was that if I don't like the job still, at least I'd be making more money, and I wondered what it would be like working for a smaller company with a couple of thousand employees instead of a global giant that had just under a hundred thousand.  Well, I fell back in love with the job.  I have a passion for it again.  And I realised that it was the coorporation I was working for previously that made me feel so angry and upset.  It was the empty promises, the micro managing, the constant rhetoric of improving themselves combined with the hypocrisy of refusing to change methods and strategies.  The fact that no one listened when my team discovered problems within the company and suggested resolutions.  The fact that all I was to them was their code monkey, nothing more.  I wasn't a person to them.  Being at a company that allows me autonomy, that trusts and listens to what I have to say, and in a role that allows me to creatively problem solve and creatively present those solutions--that has made all the difference.  I've only had experience with developing solutions for people and logistics within the company, so I find that interesting.  I think if I had to work in the accounting or risk section of the company, though, I might not be as keen.  TL;DR:  Yes, coding is great for INFJ types.  It helps us to develop Ti while satisfying our need to be creative and problem-solve.  However, make sure you're working for a company and in a department that aligns with your values, or you'll be miserable."

INFJ types seem to be best at coming up with large ideas it seems. Let me try and break down how programming works for me.  So I'm developing an android app. It needs to have a functioning user interface written in XML with all the buttons n shit written in java, and then it needs libraries imported to make the VOIP feature function, and it needs to communicate with a MySQL server to function as the account manager... etc etc. Its not one big application but more like 500 tiny programs, each button requires like ten lines of code to describe what it does. But anyways, I can describe the data flow and what everything needs to be but writing the actual bits and pieces of code is hard. IxTx types are a lot better at coding than us but if you're passionate dont let that discourage you. I'm doing it though I'd much rather work with people"

infj,3c5vp7,nyxbit,2,Sun Jul 5 10:53:35 2015 UTC,"I understand coding, but I do not program extensively, nor involved directly in developing. How I see it, though, is that its current market is in need of many more apps for different devices and platforms, and so I think it's possible to earn your living in this area. However, sometimes interests of management and the actual developers clash... and since you are the one who's actually pouring hours upon hours into the product, you may find it hard to comply with a request that may be not fully thought through.    Before you make the final decision, I'd suggest to check subreddits on programming and see what to learn first.   I'm considering quitting my dead-end job   To quote Yoda: ""If no mistake have you made, yet losing you are … a different game you should play""."

If I could move into something with human-interaction and visual representation in mind, like front-end web dev, I'd be a lot happier.  Don't straight-up quit your job (even though I know it sounds so nice to do). Unfortunately someone with a job is always more appealing to hire than someone without one. Work on side projects in your free time, so that you can still work where you're at while applying to programming jobs. Having little projects, and therefore passion, to show is often more important than credentials when applying to coding positions."

MBTI at least provides you with a preferential way you input and output information and depending on that is how you process and convey yourself.

But now when I look at them just a few seconds longer our eyes lock and a secret channel of communication opens and disappears once you finish your conversation leaving no trace behind. You don't speak about it, you just... know. There's also the more sensual eyes which I will pretend not to comprehend because keep that to yourself. Someone please tell me they feel this way too. I know a lot of us can't even look at ourselves in the mirror, but I cannot be the only one here.   My hands fly about when I talk   Well I visualize as I speak, so my words have to convey pictures in my head which I draw out into the space in front of me and around me. It's like I have an interactive hologram of my ideas I'm trying to show you, but only I can see, so each of my hand movements correlates to a part of my idea that I'm ""touching.""   If you tied my hands behind my back and attempted to have a conversation with me, my shoulders would be wiggling non-stop.   That's funny. I don't think I would be able to convey an idea. I must use my interactive hologram to assist my explanations.   each new place they land upon is equally latched onto with intensity. The eyes of Ni and Se are one in the same -- it is a combination that alternates between zoning-out into space and then snapping back into reality and reconnecting   I do this. I will focus so intently on one object/your eyes that I don't see anything around me. I create this space where everything is blurred out except this object/you and I. You can literally walk and stand next to me and I will not notice because I'm too focused. When I'm listening I do the ""lock-on"" but when I'm processing I do the ""zone-out""—even though I am still ""looking"" at you, I'm not ""seeing"" you, I'm seeing my thoughts flutter in front of me."

infj,3c46iq,CmdBelial,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:34:31 2015 UTC,"I look for loyalty, conviction (they have their core beliefs and are consistent in following through with those, even if those beliefs may be different than mine) and their actions matching their words. A sense of humor, clever, doesn't have to be well educated but a natural curiosity for learning/adventure. Someone more spontaneous than me is good usually as I can get stuck in my own ways sometimes. I am childfree so not wanting children is an absolute must.   I look for balance. My current boyfriend is a great balance to my personality. We contrast in being joking/serious, he doesn't like to plan and I love it so I usually take the lead on that. We both have a tendency to get in our own heads or be lazy at times, so we try to keep each other busy and kick each other in gear. We are intuitive and supportive of each other when we are sad or upset. Communication is super important and can take a lot of practice. Honesty is important for INFJ so that might be a key value for you.   If you are a male looking for a female mate, I would caution you to watch out for girls who are demanding/emotionally manipulative and drain you emotionally. I observe a lot of women who boss their men endlessly and the guy gets the 1000 yard stare in his eyes, like he's given up on life. Someone who is a good match will support your goals and dreams just as much as you support them."

When I was looking for a partner, like you I definitely wanted someone introverted like me. People who share functions (particularly Ni) tend to understand each other's verbal communication especially well. So though ISTJs and INFJs do not share any functions, I find that my S.O and can understand each other really well nonverbally. Honestly (and this is gonna sound weirder than it actually is) when we are alone sometimes we'll just communicate through grunts and we'll completely understand what the other is saying. And I actually saw a video on YouTube where an Infj and her best friend communicate through grunts too which is funny. It's really neat to experience. ISTJs are also super reliable which I love, esp being a bit unpredictable/absorbing others' emotions. I like his logic and how loyal he is. I do need to make sure to be concrete and use examples when communicating with him. But he is similar to me in all the right respects, while also balancing me out and complementing me in all the right ways. And I met him on okcupid! 99% match on there--so it is possible to find a really nice match online; just keep looking :)"

infj,3c46iq,pinkattack,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:29:14 2015 UTC,I love my ENFP. They are extroverts but they also like time alone. So it could be that your significant other occasionally likes to go out with a group but is 80% of the time fine to stick with you and a close inner circle of people. Just remember that the introvert/ extrovert this is a scale. Some people are way towards the middle and can go either way.  What I looked for was a good friend. Trustworthy and with a big heart for people. Someone who thinks my weird side is awesome and lets me be myself.

I'm currently seeing an ISTP and it's been steady for the most part (except for the fact that we're just not quite official yet or whatever). Honestly, he's so much of what I want in an SO - laidback, intelligent, great sense of humor, a handyman, some similar interests (sports, books, pop culture, etc.), practical, honest, confident (minus the arrogance), reliable, and kind. Although personally, my convictions are that he has to be a Christian; for him, faith is a journey and I don't mind walking alongside him with that because my own has been a journey too. I don't need someone so put together. I just want someone to share life with.   We actually have the same functions, just in different order... so I guess we're not completely different in that sense. I'm not sure how these functions have been interacting between us. I feel that when I'm with him, it's allowed me to exercise Ti and Se more, because those are his two main functions. I'm a pretty adaptable person and I've been learning how to be more laidback when I'm around him (because I'm normally so uptight.) The only drawback I've seen is that he's not an initiator so I do all the initiating and planning... which is kind of my thing anyway. I'm also obviously more emotional and intense than he is, but I think his levelheadedness has helped me in keeping composure and not overreacting to things. I like to think that my emotional intelligence is rubbing off on him a bit too ;P  But I think it really is up to you to decide what/who is best for you. Even though we're INFJs, I'd like to think we're still diverse enough to have different preferences and tastes when it comes to SOs."

From my own experience, I seem to always look for genuineness in a woman. This is harder to find than said. But, every time I met somebody and didn't take into consideration genuineness, I always ended up being disappointed--one-way, if that makes sense. All things aside, when it comes to intimate relationships, I think trusting your intuition is the best way. I felt that I truly loved someone when there was no reason why I loved her.

You two just don't connect that way and it's okay. You will meet very cool people in your life whom you don't have romantic chemistry with. It doesn't mean you screwed up or something's wrong with you, it just means people are different.  Now to INFJ-dissect:  I'm assuming he had a sudden idea that it would be fun if his new girl could really hit it off with his friends. I'm curious as to why the other chick didn't make you feel included more by incorporating you into the group. But from my understanding of his approach, he's looking for a girl who is outgoing and knows how to direct a conversation. He had no intent of getting to know you in that first date on a more one-on-one intellectual level. I'm also assuming that is what you're looking for, getting to know someone more intellectually before investing emotion.  I would def say what /u/joantheunicorn said, at least something that conveys your agreement and voices your side of what you were looking for. To be more tactful, I would say ""I agree, you're a cool dude but because it was a double date I didn't get a chance to connect with you as much as I wanted to. Blah blah thanks bye.""

All of the INFJs I have known (three lifetime friends and a partner) are so dominated by their head and heart that they can seem like robots in human flesh at times. The body is the last connection made.  Suggestion that has worked for at least one friend who needed to dance in public: Practice with one of those people you have a deep connection with. Understand that the issue is likely with dancing in public, where your strength/weakness to connect with individuals is mostly useless--how can you connect with 100 onlookers in a deep and meaningful way? Impossible.  Club style dancing will likely be the worst, because there is no one to really connect with. At least with swing, or Latin, or ballroom, you've got a partner.  It doesn't help that dancing is very ""of the moment"" as opposed to something you can plan. Though there are styles that involve looking ahead --- the ones mentioned above.  Connect with your partner, or connect with yourself. Forget about the other people on the floor, radiate that amazing thing inside, and nothing else will matter. Act the part, if you must. Everyone will go along with it.  And if you are doing Latin dance, you have to wiggle it.  I hope this helps."

I do like your external viewpoint on the whole dancing matter - you've pinpointed some reasonable (probable) underlying issues. Dancing can be really scary if you're in a room with a bunch of people you don't know, where here you are unleashing yourself upon the world in all your body moving glory (or only half-assing it out of fear, making it look worse). The lack of individual one-on-one connection does make it feel awkward, but there is power in connecting with a group - it's not impossible!  I once had a breakout dance with some new friends I made in Mexico, we all clicked so well and just ended up focusing on ourselves having fun, being idiots while dancing and singing, and all of a sudden everyone around us wanted in on the action. We were honestly ridiculous, the music was Latin(o) so we were wiggling it, but it was our vibrant energy that others seemed to pick up on. The fact that we were 'looking silly' did nothing to deter people, they joined in.  It was such a liberating and fantastic experience, and certainly gave me some confidence to shrug off my fears of others' scrutiny and just dance. Thanks for your insight ;)"
infj,3c21uu,lzimmy,9,Tue Jul 14 14:51:30 2015 UTC,"I actually love dancing for fun, not that I go out and do it much.  I usually just end up dancing around my house while I clean, it's the most effective way I've found to get motivated about folding laundry.  I've never really done lessons or anything, but I grew up with impromptu dance parties in our kitchen thrown by my mother, so it's always been a spontaneous and fun thing for me.  When the stakes are low, I have no difficulty going out and making a fool out of myself. On a recent cruise I even danced by myself in a room of strangers to get people onto the floor, and luckily it worked. All it takes is one willing idiot!  That being said, I am horrible at learning choreography, it just doesn't stick. Also, I have a love-hate relationship with partner dancing. I'd love to be able to do it, but I have an irrational fear about it. Since there are set moves and rules, it's like trying to have a conversation with someone when you don't know the language.  Also, since I've always been an independent go-getter, I'm super bad at knowing how to surrender and be lead.  Added to the fact that rubbing up against attractive men isn't something I do frequently, it messes with my head and confidence, or makes me incredibly self-aware in a very awkward way. The result is basically like I've been shot through the forehead with an invisible bullet. The entry wound is invisible but it's like the rest of my brain is completely blown away except for whatever controls the most rudimentary motor skills and then just enough of my higher processing to realize how hopeless and sucky I'm doing. Torture!  Although I did go to an impromptu square/contra dance at a conference recently and had a blast dancing with everyone, but that's probably because we all had no idea what we were doing.  Anyway, a goal of mine is to be able to slow dance/partner dance with someone someday and be good enough to actually enjoy it.   tl;dr: I'm fine on my own when I can dictate my own moves, or dancing with others while not physically connected; once someone else is leading or it's coordinated moves, all bets are off. Also, I'm pretty picky about what kind of music I want to dance to."

The advantage this dance has over most others, in my perspective, is that it is highly structured, with lots of rules and conventions. Of course within that structure is a lot of expressive freedom, but have rules works for me far better than something that is very loose and improvisatory.  As an added bonus with dancing in general, not just tango, it's given me more security and comfort being physical and communicating physically with the opposite sex, another thing that I've found difficult in general.

So I like to go to a lot of shows and watch local bands (so this isn't like dancing at a club, more like rocking out), and for the LONGEST time I found it so hard to do anything but sway and bob my head with my hands at my side. The arms in particular was what got me - it always felt weird to do anything other than bending them at the elbow.   I recently went to Bonnaroo, a music festival here in the states, and somewhere between everyone being so open and nice and the drugs I was taking (don't judge), I learned to absolutely stop giving a fuck (for real) and just let loose. It started with just joining in clapping, but raising my hands above my head while I did it. Simple, but a big step for me. Next thing I know I'm fist pumping, jumping around, and laughing with people. The absolute best for me was moshing at Against Me! and Slayer. You're too busy trying to not get knocked down / knock other people down to even think about how you look.   Anyway, I somehow managed to take a lot of that back with me. When I go to shows now, instead of standing at the back pretending to be an audiophile (it actually does sound best back there, but truthfully I was just nervous), I push straight up to the front of the stage get into it.   So I guess my advice to you would be to go to a good punk show, get right up front where the only way to get out is to hop the rail, and wait for the music to start.

You could do her the favor of saying forget about it, but then, it isn't very nice of her to leave you hanging either. Your call. But I'd emotionally clock out of this ASAP if I were you. If it's just the lesbian angle that's bothering her, she's going to need to address that on her own if she's in the closet and that'll require some time."

The theory proposes that the primary function of consciousness is well-circumscribed, serving the somatic nervous system. Inside this system, consciousness serves as a frame that constrains and directs skeletal muscle output, thereby yielding adaptive behavior. The mechanism by which consciousness achieves this is more counterintuitive, passive, and ‘low level’ than the kinds of functions that theorists have previously attributed to consciousness. Passive Frame Theory begins to illuminate (a) what consciousness contributes to nervous function, (b) how consciousness achieves this function, and (c) the neuroanatomical substrates of conscious processes.

infj,3by5xx,Horouto,4,Fri Jul 3 03:16:52 2015 UTC,"Oh cynicism. My oldest friend.  Being cynical is simply my expression of my intuition. It only takes so many empires falling and hearts breaking and plans failing to create a cynical worldview. Cynicism allows me to plan realistically instead of diving headfirst into failure.  When I hear optimists complaining about the failed outcome of their pipedreams, it truly bothers me. To me, it seems like shooting for the stars is just a huge energy expenditure with almost guaranteed failure.  It's especially hard being married to an optimist. They cut corners too close and come back crying. And you have to give them all the love you have instead of implying ""I told you so.""  Unfortunately, logical cynicism leads to emotional depression. Whereas logical optimism leads to emotional hope and (usually) temporary disappointment.  Despite being cynical myself, I'd rather be optimistic, purely because of the beauty of hope. It doesn't matter if it's true of false; hopeful people are the happy ones."

If you don't aim for the stars, you're aiming too low. The reason overly optmistic people fail is because they forget to look behind them, thinking that nothing will come from there being an optimist and all, thats where cynicism comes in. A balance of anything is usually a good thing. Too much of anything is always a bad thing. I understood that concept since I was 6 years old. Only crazy people who think crazy things and are not afraid of failure change the world. Do you want me to name a few million people that without their crazy thoughts and their courage to take failure head on, how different the world would be? It's okay to fail. Luck isn't always on our side, thats why we try a hundred times maybe a thousand and maybe a million. We only have to get it right once. Luck is irrelevant if you try enough times.

The only way to completely assure that you'll get the long term result you want is to progressively work through each step along the way.  Don't jump ahead as much as you might want to.  By taking all of the little steps in between, you can lay the foundation for a stable relationship, plus have much more control and peace of mind.

Keep in mind, there's much more you should probably know about this person before you start betting everything. I understand the panicked feeling because I was the same way leading up to a recent date. Just make sure you stay true to who you are instead of letting your emotions guide you blindly and I think it will all work out."

And I am :)  I'll sometimes wistfully think about being in a relationship since the idea of it is so attractive, but then I'll think about it realistically and realize that the opportunity cost is still too dang high for my taste.

infj,3bw82i,protagonizer,7,Thu Jul 2 19:00:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, that would certainly have been true when I was younger, because I felt a great deal of pressure to find a girlfriend so that I could be 'normal'. It doesn't bother me now I'm older and care far less for the opinions others have of me.  I am single, and you could say that it's by choice. Admittedly, I make zero effort to pursue a relationship. I just don't feel the need to. Being lonely isn't ever a problem and life is much simpler and easier by myself. I'm also extremely picky, not because I'm arrogant and think I'm something special but because past experience in relationships has made me perhaps overly wary of letting someone in. It's all too easy to get carried away when meeting someone new and failing to pick up on all the signs that you are not right for each other. Also, if I am going to start a  new relationship with someone now at this point in my life, I would want it to be with someone I could settle down with so finding the right person is extra important. More important than any pressure to conform with the cultural norm of being in a relationship."

I get sad with the idea that I will be alone all my life. I'm almost halfway now and I think if nothing changes soon it will be too late. Men seem to have a best before date with their first relationship.  Being strongly introverted and expected to make all the first moves hasn't helped.
infj,3bw82i,islander85,5,Thu Jul 2 21:46:57 2015 UTC,"If we're talking about relationships between men and women, I think the biggest factor is age, not type. That is, between the ages of ~20 and ~30-35, men are more likely to be unintentionally single than women. But by ~35-40 and beyond, it reverses. I know lots of women in their late 30s and 40s who are really bothered by being single but can't find anybody, while men of the same age feel like they've won the lottery.  The dating world is skewed by the fact that men generally prefer to date women their own age or younger and women prefer men their own age or older, and that male fertility is less affected by age."

infj,3bw82i,CaptainCharlie,2,Fri Jul 3 08:06:49 2015 UTC,"It can be hard to tell... I've seen it vary so much from person to person, from those who start to love the freedom and flexibility of the single life so much that they see no reason to pair up, to people who are just waiting for the right person (who may or may not eventually arrive).  I've known people who've given up hope and stopped trying completely, only to find a great relationship out of the blue. Life is unpredictable.  That said, if you're 32 and male, and into women, you'll probably find you'll have a lot more opportunities in the coming years than you ever did in the past.  (All of this assumes you live in western society... I don't know how true any of this is globally)."

infj,3bw82i,CaptainCharlie,4,Fri Jul 3 19:07:59 2015 UTC,"I relate a bit more to the female infjs I've talked to than the males on this one. Like lzimmy said, the main reason I have for being single isn't others not showing interest (which I find out later because I'm bad at taking hints). It's definitely my choice. I enjoy being on my own lately. While I do love the idea of a relationship, when it comes to actually going through it, it stresses me out and it takes someone very special to make me want to put in the effort to be in a relationship. Whenever I try and push myself into being with someone I end up miserable or do stupid things, so no thanks. I figure it'll happen eventually, so no rush.   I've had problems with self esteem, but that's usually the months following a breakup."

infj,3bw82i,ThenThereWasReddit,6,Fri Jul 3 01:51:34 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is a pretty big part of the issue. Men being the ones to initiate and pursue while women generally are on the receiving end. If a woman chooses not to pursue anything, that's still running with the general order of things.. she'll still have opportunities because she's still going to be asked out. On the male end.. if he doesn't pursue, most women won't initiate anything so nothing happens.  I think if an infj isn't quite content in the state of their sense of self they may have no intent to actively seek out and share themself intimately with someone.  It seems that infj women can grow in their sense of self while still having the opportunities to date without having to initiate. She may very well find someone during her journey and be able to grow with him. Infj men can try to grow to a point where they have a firm sense of self and may then want to actively seek out an SO but everything up to that point is a solo journey. He doesn't get nearly the same opportunity to find someone during his journey who will grow with him. Who knows the opportunities that may have been missed in this time.  The infj might also see no reason to ""date"" if they are already content in their current state but this would imply that they would act once they meet someone they truly connect with."

I do not want to roll over in the morning and be nose to nose with someone.

Its hard to find someone that shares your same values, beliefs, dreams, aspirations, and above all else, can hold an organic conversation that isn't effected by ego. I guess that's why I've always gravitated towards older women, and vice versa.   On top of that women aren't normally initially attracted to someone who believes materialistic things can't provide happiness. Try and explain that one on a first date without sounding like a bum.  I figure the women that I'll have a deep initial connection with are probably in college right now and busy with life in general right now. The college thing and I didn't mesh well (remembering facts and repeating them is my kryptonite) maybe in the future it'll call me back. I'm doing fairly well without it and I don't have a mound of students loans to deal with. I realized a little while ago that my career isn't something I'm hoping will make me happy, I already know it won't make me happy.  So yeah, basically I focus on myself a lot both mentally and physically, good friends and family along with it and that's all I need to be happy. You can see where a partner is kind of in the back of my mind. I've just never met a women and it not feel a little forced.. Hopefully I can be proven wrong though."
infj,3bw82i,beeman4266,3,Fri Jul 3 20:08:14 2015 UTC,"I have the reverse sort of problem when it comes to attention from the opposite sex. Even if it does satisfy my vanity a little, any gratification is overwhelmingly outweighed by the intense loathing I feel towards any male that finds me attractive. Is it a question of sexual orientation? No, I know myself well enough to be clear that I'm straight (more or less). These are just one of the many opposing desires that dwell in me, that of wanting to look physically nice while absolutely hating any admiring gazes directed my way.  Sometimes I see girls my age (I'm 29 now) get dressed up and made up and I feel a stab of envy, despite it being something totally within my grasp. Deep down inside, I think much of my repulsion towards attention have to do with my never having been a physically attractive adolescent, so it feels hypocritical of me now to betray my inner sense of my own uniqueness and of feeling separate from the rest of humanity. Also, having an unusual degree of insight into how men view women has made it hard for me to play the role of a 'hot girl' with perfect aplomb.  Sigh. Talk about self-created problems."

Anyway, I'd agree with the trend you've observed, OP. Out of the five, there's one guy who would LOVE to date whereas the girls are pretty happy being single. However, the guy's also significantly older than the girls (30 vs 21-24) which may play a big role in that too.   I'm a 22 F INFJ and the IDEA of dating seems nice, but  1. No one has expressed interest for ~3 years 2. It seems wise to stay single for now  I'd like to build my life up a bit more and steady my footing before I  invest a lot in a relationship with someone special.

Most women I've met either online or in person lose interest after I tell them I don't have transportation or that I'm currently in a dead-end job. Just have to keep trying I suppose. I just didn't want to become drained of my emotions for wanting to find someone to connect with. It's very infuriating that men 9 times out of 10 have to be the one who engages or pursues after the women. It'd be nice for once if a women could be the one to start it, in fact I find it to be something I look for in women.  I personally don't have a care in the world if I have less than my SO. It's not something that really bothers me. I just felt like it bothered women because that's the type of behavior I've noticed. It could have been something else that made them lose interest though so it's just speculation on my part.

I was an only child with zero relatives my age within my vicinity so later I confided in strong friendships. Teachers often praised me. Adults thought I was mature. I was kept away from bad things so I developed an insanely naive mindset toward the world with a dash of intuitive skepticism that I convinced myself was wrong because you should never ""judge."" I conditioned myself to ignore facts in favor of my own perspective based on how I felt.  In my childhood, every impacting action came with someone guiding me with wisdom. My mother, my friends, their parents who all shared some of their own stories. I was a kid, but the concept I understood was that hard shit happens to everyone in their own way and you just have to deal with it. I developed a great well of empathy and insight as a child still trying to understand it all.  I was insecure with my identity, but confident with my values. Despite all the failures, pain, and mistakes, I retained an optimistic and chill vibe because I've experienced what it feels like to really connect with people. The world is shitty but it can also be a beautiful place if you create that beauty and spread it.   I believe that beauty starts with being courageous enough to be vulnerable to others. If they hurt you, it's okay because you're strong enough to handle it and forgiving enough to understand it is because of their own pain. Love, the purest kind, happened to me."

I was home schooled till high school and didn't really have any friends other than a few neighbor kids. All the people at church bullied me for being curious and outspoken about my thoughts. They didn't like a kid questioning their religious fantasies.  My parents would always be on me about something. Either I wasn't serving enough, being righteous, or just plain choosing to ""follow the devil"" for any disobedience to their demands. On top of that they didn't bother to parent. Home school was being handed a book at 8 years old and told to read. I only learned to read because my 7 year old sister taught me when I was 4-5. They Essentially locking me away with curfews boundaries and groundings often and refused to create any kind of meaningful life for us kids because they could only think about the end goal dying on good terms... There is no life when all you can think about is what comes after its already gone. In my Childhood I had nothing but myself, my siblings, and 2 consistent people in my life and floaters from around the neighborhood. I got by just being a kid and enjoying my childhood ignoring the negative and focusing on being creative and making worthwhile experiences with what we had.  I developed depression, low self esteem, the bullying and constantly being degraded for everything I said eventually made me extremely introverted. Like one of those kids you see in the corner who never talks or tries to interact with anyone. It was pretty bad.  I eventually went into a timid rebellion that started when I was 11. I argued constantly with my parents for a year and a half that I wanted to go to public school where I had a chance at a real life. What would have been my sophomore year I eventually just started attending school and regular classes following people I knew to their next class until a teacher caught on and had me see a councilor whom I eventually convinced my parents to meet and get me enrolled. From there I struggled throughout the whole high school experience every day to achieve some kind of personality and standard for myself and even pushed far enough to graduate with the rest of the kids my age despite being a year late.  Its been a bumpy road to get to where I am today. I don't know where I stand or where I am going, but I'm happy on the path I'm walking. Since then my social skills have improved a lot, my world view is open and accepting compared to my previous close minded religious outlook, and I got past apologizing for being who I am and actually enjoy being someone who frustrates linear minds for being so dynamic on my view points.  I still have trouble having a connection with people. There are only a few throughout my life who've gotten close to an interpersonal relationship, but for some reason I either sub-consciously keep people at an arms reach or I just give off some kind of vibe that keeps people from wanting to get close to me."

They still hold onto the same beliefs they had back then, and don't accept their failure... It makes it really hard having to just see the same people who fucked over a good part of my life.

infj,3bwm94,esotericelijah,3,Sat Jul 4 06:55:50 2015 UTC,"My dad was a violent, abusive, drunk POS police officer.  Probably an ENTJ or ENFJ. My mom was awesome and supportive though. ISTJ if I had to guess. I am also the oldest child and have 2 brothers. Needless to say I was around quite a bit of verbal and physical conflict in my home life, which did show while I was at school too. I wasn't a troublemaker though (dad would beat me if I was disruptive at school), however I frequently got into fights at school and in my neighborhood. my parents wouldn't punish me for fighting and even encouraged it in most cases. They despised people who were ""cowardly"" and ""spineless"". Anyways, they divorced when I was like 14 and since I hated my father I stayed with my mother (after leaving my father she became a totally different person and I was able to get away with anything I wanted to do). I got arrested when I was like 15 for theft and started drinking and doing drugs habitually. I was sent to military school not long after my arrest and graduated when I was 17. Immediately after graduation I did a semester of college only to drop out. I felt like it was a waste of time. I needed money because I was into the party scene, so I started stealing... a lot. My personality during all of this time was extremely aggressive and reckless. I almost thought I was invincible haha. Now that I'm 22 and have a kid on the way I've chilled out a lot (frequent LSD/mushroom trips had A LOT to do with it too). I'll still put my foot in someone's ass if they fuck with me & mine, but I'm more open to the peaceful solution than I used to be. I am an ENTP btw."

Glad you're doing better though, I'm 22 as well and have made my life stable. Actually, you kind of remind me of a friend of mine that I'm rather close to, but he lacks any violent tenancies.   My brother is very violent. He knocked out two of my teeth last Christmas. We don't talk."

LSD helped curb that but I credit a lot of it to my ENFP brother, my INFJ gf, and my ENFP uncle. I feel like  at heart I am a non-violent person, and the only reason I used to be aggressive is because of my own fear of being abused again. I'm not proud of those ways at all. These days I absolutely refuse to fight unless it's unavoidable... that being said I haven't had to fight anyone in years. i have a lot of theories on why I am the way I turned out (don't we all haha?). i don't think I've worked everything out all the way yet though. a big part of me wants to kill him still... not to contradict myself. I know that's wrong and take it as a sign that I still have some things to work on."

Mostly only child as my one sibling was 12 years older and married at 19. Father died when I was 12. Mother moved me away from friends and family and purposely alienated me from family. However she treated others wonderfully and everyone loved her. I was the scapegoat and my older sister picked up her habits of demeaning me.   I ended up pushing away anyone as soon as I started to really feel close to them. That is still a struggle even though I understand what's happening.

infj,3bx5mk,lzimmy,8,Thu Jul 2 21:53:27 2015 UTC,"For me, even though Ni (Introverted Intuition, our main function) is a perceiving function, I feel the need to act on that information.  I can spend a lot of time imagining scenarios, ideas, and ""perfect systems"" but then eventually I'm going to hit a point where I go, ""Ok, I think I have a solid idea of what I want to accomplish now and how to do it, let's get started"".  Judging means as much as I love theory, it's useless without practice.  I can stew over new ideas for hours, days, etc., but unless I ultimately do something about it, it's a masturbatory exercise.  Also, I need deadlines in order to perform.  Without them, I can procrastinate and stew a bit longer than necessary. Realistic goals and expectations activate me.     Unfortunately, this also means that after awhile I'll simply find certain activities ""pointless"" and not worth engaging in if I can't justify long term benefit from it.  Not that it stops me from doing them completely, I'll just be incredibly aware of how much time I'm wasting and feel guilty about it.    Unlike the common J stereotypes, my environment isn't always outwardly tidy, but I have my own system that works for me and I always know where something is when I need it."

If you're an INFJ, your judging is going to kick in every time you deal with the outside world for the most part. Internally you may feel very open-minded and perceptive because of dominant Ni, but when you have to act, you will engage your judging functions. So dating and relationships can definitely fall into that category.  I'd say yes, but my original response was from my personal point of view, so your mileage may vary."

infj,3bx5mk,demesure,3,Fri Jul 3 16:31:24 2015 UTC,"The judging function just means you extravert with either feeling or thinking (whether dominant or auxiliary), meaning that is the function that people tend to see. It is more focused on organizing either feelings or thoughts based off of emotions or facts in your external world.  For Fe, you feel what other people feel and have a need to form a general conclusion as to why they feel that way.  For Te, you use facts to string together a conclusion that makes sense based off those facts.  Both are based off of external things, which is why it has the name ""judging."" It values structure because that is the way you process things. Because J-types have Si/Ni dominant or auxiliary, it is so messy inside our heads we need order and control over our external environment. When you develop your more tertiary/inferior functions, you won't be as ""anal."""
infj,3bx5mk,Demomaroo,2,Fri Jul 3 04:20:04 2015 UTC,"It's more a matter of if you tend towards structure or a more loose and casual way of doing things. Anal or overplanner could apply if your judging function is super strong and you can't be loose or flexible. Most people are more towards the middle. For instance I know I work better if I have a plan in mind, but I work best when I'm mentally and emotionally prepared to adapt if that plan doesn't work out.

infj,3bvrqq,Demomaroo,8,Thu Jul 2 15:34:02 2015 UTC,"So, I despise small talk. At work I obviously do ""suck it up"" and just do what is necessary to not seem like a bitch and I've gotten decent at it, though I need about an hour of no talking once I get home to decompress. But I decided a while ago (with much encouragement from my ENTP SO) to fucking let that shit go with making friends. Here's what I mean by that; if I am getting to know someone and I feel like talking about something deep with them, I do. It's amazing how most people will really open up if you just launch into conversation with them like you've known them forever. Obviously avoid social faux-pas like being overly affectionate/familiar, but if you just allow yourself to talk the way you want to talk, people will respond to that. And for those that don't, that ""reject"" you, well you can still view that as a positive because now neither of you wasted your time and energy trying to mesh. Something it took me a really long time to really grasp is that (especially if you're in an urban area) there are literally billions of other people out there in the world, it may sound cold but you have zero obligation to be friends or try to be friends with someone who only likes a version of you. It's cliché as shit but seriously, be yourself and if someone doesn't like you fuck 'em. We have a tendency to want approval from everyone around us and it's really hard to fight against that and just embrace our awkward, weird, dry sense of humor (in my case at least) and desire for deep interaction.  As far as in business, someone else will have to help you there. I feel like I'm wearing a mask all day long and it's awful and exhausting. I do most of my networking via email so I don't have to keep my face neutral and friendly while cringing at my own word choices."
infj,3bvrqq,Super_Brownie,4,Thu Jul 2 16:25:45 2015 UTC,"Business major + INFJ here. Plenty of experience with career fairs and networking activities. I'll be honest, going from conversation to conversation wore me out more quickly than most other people. Hated small talk, so I was baffled by this for a while.  A few tricks and adjustments to my own mindset that I picked up along the way:  1) Share things you otherwise wouldn't. I had to very consciously decide to do this. INFJ's have an incredible tendency to go through a million thoughts in a second. When the person I was networking with shared their experience or a thought, I had to latch onto what was going through my head and choose to share about it verbally instead of dismissing it mentally.  Stupid example: Dude shares with me about how his family has a cottage near Seattle they visit all the time and all the different things they enjoy. Rather than processing the IDEA of vacation or sports, I brought it down a notch and shared a story about how I really enjoy kayaking and how Seattle sounds like a good place for that. God knows why, but what we tend to dismiss turns out to be interesting things to share with others.  2) I major in supply chain management. I'm NOT passionate about fulfilling purchase orders, calculating finances, etc. People are baffled when I say this, because they assume SCM would be all about that. But I've made the choice to see my major through the lense of how it affects people and systems.  Example: Instead of talking about a spreadsheet model or statistical trends I couldn't care less about, I choose to see that I love what I do because managing a supply chain effectively frees up resources that organizations can otherwise use to have a greater impact on communities they do business in. It's a side door into my passion, but it's also something very few people besides INFJ's can do and I think it gives us a competitive edge.  Basically, ignore the crap everyone else is stepping through, and realize that you have a unique mindset that you can leverage. People you network with will love it when you give them this fresh perspective.  3) You are a people person. Yes, we INFJ's have a love-hate relationship with people, but we have a gift of taking in information from around us and piecing together the world in a way others can't. You can read the other person's feelings, use that and RECIPROCATE. When they're revved up about a topic, ask them questions and listen. Then summarize it back to them based on what YOU intuit. More often than not, the response is, ""wow! That's a really unique way of looking at it!""  As an INFJ you are a person of passion and purpose. While others see cold hard results, you see hope and revel in the joy of constant improvement. These are things others value, but seldom see for themselves. Your personality helps you see those things, but you must make the conscious choice to share them.    TL;DR: 1) Say things you would otherwise consider stupid, 2) Talk about the topic at hand with passion, even if you have to trick yourself to enter that state of passion through a side door, 3) Exercise your gift of intuition and feeling as an INFJ."
infj,3bvrqq,augustusprime,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:50:30 2015 UTC,Thank you. These are things I need to work on.
infj,3bvrqq,Joishere,3,Fri Jul 3 12:43:07 2015 UTC,"LinkedIn. Yes, it may be one of those social (business) networking sites that most people either love or hate.  But once I figured out how to add more friends and then once several accepted my invitations it was a relatively simple and easier way for me for me to correspond with people with only a tad of small talk and asking professionals in my field about if they knew of any openings at their agency because you are searching for a job/position.  That alone gave me about 8-10 leads on potential jobs in the area that I wanted to work in.   Also, FB is a good way to add friends (especially if you add friends of friends/suggested section). I recall one day where a nice lady, unbeknownst to me and was only a friend of a friend sent me a sweet PM saying how she really enjoyed reading my positive posts and then named one article that really gave her some new ideas.  A couple of days later after us responding back and forth a couple of times, we decided to go have coffee. Now previously, if I had tried to step out of my comfort zone...it would have made me feel that me trying something (even slowly) like we did would have made me come off creepy, lol.  Now I realized that her approach was actually both slowly building, kind, and non-creepy b/c she didn't just randomly ask ""hey you want to do something"", without us have ever making acquaintance before.  I guess what my suggestion would be to start out trying these things online with people that you seem to have things in common with and then gradually increase contact, maybe first by saying that you have something in common, and then would like to talk/hang out sometime, and then later maybe even exchange numbers to text to meet up sometime.  Both of these has worked for me, because it avoided a lot of the small talk by watching to see if the person had a tendency to have deep/insightful posts first, rather than noticing that they are surface and just want to post about basic things.    Last but not least, I searched on Meetup.com for people that had like-minded interests, such as hiking...wanting to learn a new skill together, or even a cool foodie group that likes to go to try out new restaurants in town together. That has been an awesome experience for me, as you tend to meet several people, and can decide after some talking who you'd enjoy talking most to at these events.  Either way, I wish you the best of luck...and please do know, that this is something that I've also had to to gently push myself to try out...and this is coming from someone in their late 30s.  But, better late than never, as the saying goes. :-)"

Message me anytime you'd like. :-)
infj,3bvrqq,demesure,2,Thu Jul 2 19:08:07 2015 UTC,"That’s close to what my loved ones say. “Stop trying to be a normal person. You suck at it. When you are yourself you are really bizarre and people don’t know what to do with you, but everything about you works better.” With small talk my problem is that I just can’t find any safe ground. Most of the common questions come back to things where my answers, if I’m honest, are bleak and stop everyone dead. I don’t want to be the woe is me person. These are things I’m trying to move past and build a more positive life. Dealing with people by email is absolutely wonderful."
infj,3bvrqq,Intempestivity,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:26:41 2015 UTC,"I'm the same with small talk--I either inadvertantly shut a conversation down, or go way too deep.  It's difficult for me to find middle ground.  However, something I've found useful is to ask people questions about whatever they've just mentioned.  They're usually pretty happy to talk about themselves.  Also, INFJs tend to remember personal details about others--so I might remember that someone is really in to video games or loves to bake cakes, but I won't remember their name or where they went to school.  This actually served me really well with regards to networking just recently.  In our Diversity and Inclusion working group, we were talking about partnering with charities to share information, resource speakers, create toolboxes, etc.  Our current focus is disabilities and mental health.  I remembered that in my work induction, I met a guy who worked for a mental health charity for years and said it was still something he was really passionate about.  One phone call later, and he's reaching out to his former contacts to set up meetings to start up an official alliance with them.  Networking in action.  He was actually really impressed that I remembered that mental health was something really important to him and that it was his former line of work; almost nobody brings it up or reaches out to him on the subject.  So even if you aren't great at small talk, turn it around and ask questions.  You might uncover someone else's passion, and that information might come in useful some day."
infj,3bvrqq,LunaInfj,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:06:33 2015 UTC,"I need to get less timid about asking those kinds of questions. I am the same way about not remembering names as well as the personal details.  I also used to work for a major charity and we went through that shame sort of partnership only it was between groups for Cancer, Heart Disease and Diabetes. Since all their prevention messages were the same they teamed up."
infj,3bvrqq,LunaInfj,2,Mon Jul 6 11:08:26 2015 UTC,"Ni is receptive toward what others say, making them feel as if what they say has value. Fe makes other people feel understood because Fe really repeats back to someone your comprehension of what they've said. If you're well-developed, you can really use your Ti to expand a conversation toward a further direction. And Se provides a tangible goal that is able to be reached.  I think INFJ has one of the greatest functional stacks for communication. Understanding what your strengths and weaknesses are as a person, can nudge you in the right direction. If you have trouble with initiation, it is just the matter of gauging whether someone wants to be approached or not. First impressions are important in business because sometimes they're the only impression. In both business and personal, make sure your introduction/small comment is during an appropriate time and about something both of you can relate to (weather, work, shit talking about someone's incompetency, pointing out an observation).  If you have trouble continuing a conversation, talk about something that shows your value. Meaning, bring some of your own insight or opinion into the conversation. What do you think of x? How should you approach y? Because we are NiFe, our conversations only seem to last if there is depth in it. So use that to your advantage.  Also, make sure you provide some sort of way to further interaction. Whether it's a casual ""see you around"" or inviting them out for coffee/lunch etc. It implies you want to see that person again as opposed to a normal ""okay end of conversation bye now."" Don't forget when you do see that person again, express a sense of enthusiasm. Sometimes it just nonverbally seeps through.  Hope this helps. The comments in this thread are great."

I identify as a feminist, and not one of the misandrist feminists that are running rampant on the internet currently.  There is a particularly hateful breed of ""feminists"" out there at the minute man-bashing, and this particular quote read like their rhetoric.  I am not a misandrist, nor do I agree with this ""angry feminist"" that has cropped up all over the internet just lately.  I am very involved in the movement for equal rights for all--not just women's rights, but LGBTQ rights, rights for those with disabilities and ethnic minorities, to name but a few.

It will make her feel as if she is the one that brings fun into the relationship, it in a way validates who she is. If both of you are outgoing, it becomes difficult to ""hear"" yourself in a way. Your partner doesn't contribute what you lack, they contribute the same exact thing.  Self-esteem is just being okay with who you are, knowing your flaws, and knowing what is bullshit. I head Models by Mark Manson is a very good book for guys learning what true confidence is. I've read some of it myself, and much of it explains to you what the fundamentals of being a secure person is. None of that PUA temporary bullshit people try to feed you.  So yes. An extroverted and adventurous girl can feel attracted to someone like you. They already have. You just gotta learn how to keep them."
infj,3bublx,infjtoday,7,Thu Jul 2 05:29:37 2015 UTC,"I'll be married nine years this November, and we're both really, really happy.  I'm as in love with him as I was when we first met over a decade ago.  I don't know how to describe how I ""knew"" he was right for me--we just clicked.  We work well together, we have interesting conversations and we support each other.  He is honestly my best friend, and has been from the get-go.  He makes me happy.  I make him happy.  It probably helps (a lot) that's we're both pretty far up the introversion scale.  We can give each other space without taking it personally, because we both know how important that space is.  He's an INTJ, so he struggles to understand why I don't do everything the same way he does sometimes--it's illogical to him why I would leave a pile of papers where I can see it, so I can remember to do something with them, instead of just filing them away and then retrieving them from the file.  But if I don't see the papers, I will literally forget about them!  Inferior Se at work there.  Conversely, I don't always understand why everything simply has to have a reason--the fact that it feels right is good enough for me!  If we're driving and we come across construction or diversions, I'll be like ... ""This way.  It feels right.""  And he wants a reason why I want to go that way, like is it in the general direction of where we're trying to get to?  And I don't always have an answer other than ""it feels like the right way.""  It usually is the right way, to be honest!  I've probably picked up on some subtle something or another, like the position of the sun in the sky or a landmark, but I haven't consciously registered it.  But those are really the only times we have that are ""challenging"", and I can't really call them that, because they're not really a massive hurdle to anything at all.

When I asked my husband if he knew how I got there, he outlined more or less that exact thought train, lol (excluding the Meatloaf bit)."
infj,3bublx,Intempestivity,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:48:33 2015 UTC,"I've been married for 17 years. Many people say that the first two or three years are a honeymoon period, but that's not what we experienced. I'd say that even up to even five years our relationship felt emotionally raw and brutal. If it wasn't for the fact that we were both in a very authoritarian religion that looks badly on divorce, we probably would have separated.   We are both introverted and both came into the marriage with certain expectations of what life is ""supposed"" to be. She's my partner so I feel an insatiable need to connect with her inner life in minute detail, and more than anything I want her to connect to me in the same way. The problem is that 1) The degree and depth of the connection I wanted isn't actually possible and 2) She was raised in a home where feelings weren't really ""shared"". It caused a lot of misunderstanding. She came into the marriage expecting that I would take on the role of patriarch as outlined by the church we were raised in. She wanted me to tell her what to do and to immediately have babies. I expected her to make her own decisions and I wanted to put off children until we were out of college. That also led to a lot of misunderstanding.  But things smoothed out. I realized that I was being way to particular and that my expectations were extremely unreasonable. I realized that my wants were not for a real flesh and blood human being, but for a fantasy. It's almost like my desire to be perfectly known by another consumed my want to better know who I was with. Also, she found her own voice and identity as we began to exit the church that has dominated our lives. We swapped fantasy for reality and dropped the stupid pretense that our expectations were somehow entitled to us. It turns out that we love one another in spite of our failures to perfectly live up to one another's wants. We're happy because we learned to accept one another's faults.   It's difficult sometimes to really beat back fantasy, because I can really get caught up in romantic narratives and grand gestures. I can also get in trouble because I feel that with your spouse, not others, that it's better to get to the core truth and deal with it than walk around the subject only to spare feelings. Sometimes wanting things 100% real and 100% authentic can become an obsession, and I forget that certain ideas are psychologically difficult to handle. Ideas I've been turning over in my mind for years can come as a shock to someone who hasn't ever considered them. That's a good way to start a fight. So as much as I want to share everything, I've learned that it's not always the best thing to do, even with the person you love the most."

infj,3bublx,bezald,2,Fri Jul 3 04:24:37 2015 UTC,"My boyfriend/love of my life is ISTJ. I've actually seen a lot of INFJ/ISTJ relationships on the INFJ forums. I think for some INFJs, ISTJs can be just what they need. I don't think I could have handled an ISTJ when I was younger though, but with many past relationships and a much healthier idea of a good relationship, I'm hoping this will last.   He's my rock, he's the person I trust more than anyone I've ever known, he listens to me without judgement. These are the things, after so many years, I realize I need and that make my life so much better. I am so afraid though that I'll start falling into old, unhealthy patterns eventually and end up ruining it. :-("

infj,3bublx,LunaInfj,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:02:26 2015 UTC,"After reading about it for the past year, and taking every personality test I can find, and watching sooooo many INFJ vs INFP comparisons, videos, etc. I'm pretty certain I'm INFJ, if there's any other type that fits me it might be INTJ.   Like I said though, I wouldn't have been able to deal with an ISTJ when I was younger. Also, I knew him for 5 years as friends and we grew closer and closer over a long period of time before I considered him as more. Had some difficult times over those years as well though. But one of the best things about him is that he's been really open to listening when I need something from him and then working to adjust a bit as needed. For example, I told him once it would make me happy if when we said good night he'd tell me he loved me more often and he really took that to heart. I'm careful what I ask of him though as he really does take those things seriously so I limit it so it's not too much for him.   Interesting though as INFP seems less likely to pair with ISTJ as they seem more different. INFJ being a bit more ""science/data"" minded than INFP."

infj,3bublx,LunaInfj,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:23:46 2015 UTC,"I've been with my ENFP for 14 years, 11 married. We had a rough patch and I considered leaving, but then we took the Meyers Briggs and it changed everything. We found a published paper on how INFJ/ENFP relationships tend to function and it was us to the letter. Armed with that information we made some serious changes in how we deal with each other. With that new understanding my marriage has become the best thing in my life by far. I knew he was right for me because I was a life long insomniac, but when he was around I could sleep like a baby. Also we were friends for a couple years before we got together so I already knew him very well. The hardest things from the INFJ standpoint have been getting INFJ during fights. If things got to intense I would stop thinking verbally and not be able to talk to him, which made him furious before he understood that I wasn't being stubborn and just needed cool down before going on with the discussion. The second hardest thing was the subject of the INFJ/ENFP paper, which was that I as and INFJ need to make all kinds of plans and think about the future. He, as an ENFP, finds plans constricting and resists them. So despite being best friends and in love we tripping each other up in our practical lives."
infj,3bublx,bezald,5,Sun Jul 5 00:38:17 2015 UTC,"Do you have a link to said paper??  Yay this is super encouraging! I LOVE MY ENFP. I love her long timeee. I know it's magic that will last bc we just click, and we just get/support each other and we are each others' best friends - which is really all I'm looking for in life: a partner in crime :)   We trust each other so much, even if it's been a ton of work to get to this point. We also love talking about our futures bc A) she trusts me to execute our vision B) she has awesome/fun ideas.   She is patient with me when we fight, but I've also worked on fighting through my natural infj functions and push myself to make my thoughts heard (even if I have to raise my voice, which I rarely do) so we can work through things. Any relationship takes work and this one is waaaay worth it.   We've also been through issues with being on time/flaking, but my ENFP has pushed herself to work through flaking on ppl bc she can see her impact on her friends/me/she doesn't want to be that person anymore. I'm still working on the tardiness thing with her. As for my need to plan - I've compromised in my own head bc I'll book a day for her to plan something and then just tag along for whatever spontaneous ride it might be :)"

infj,3bublx,Demomaroo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:34:08 2015 UTC,"I've been together with my partner for 7 years, married for 2. There have been moments when I've doubted whether it was the ""right"" relationship, but the longer we stay together, take care of each other, and get through tough times together, the deeper our bond gets.  My sister-in-law said it best: nobody is perfect, and you will never find anyone who doesn't have at least one thing about them that drives you crazy.  Communication is key. Our relationship is built on a foundation of honesty and talking to each other about what we feel. Communication smooths over a multitude of wrinkles. My spouse sometimes gets upset that I tend to hold my feelings in and turn them over in my mind until the pressure builds and I have an emotional breakdown, but over time, as that pattern has become clearer to both of us, it's happened a little less.  Part of me wonders sometimes if there's somebody I could be happier with, but those moments are usually when I'm feeling unhappy in general rather than unhappy about the relationship.  We take turns feeling vulnerable with and trusting the other to take care of us, and we make sure to each take care of the other when they need it. It helps to have an idea ahead of time not of what makes a perfect partner, but of what makes a sustainable partnership."

infj,3bublx,TheQuietudeAbides,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:39:39 2015 UTC,"No idea. I took the test to learn more about myself because I was in a place of bad depression and anxiety, and really needed some information about what my strengths might be. I tend to believe it doesn't really matter what personality type you partner with as long as you both communicate and agree on what you want out of the relationship. There are always hurdles, and communication is always needed to get through them."
infj,3bublx,bezald,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:03:36 2015 UTC,"I'm interested in compatibility trends because there tend to be very strong ones for various types.  I don't exactly agree with you. There's a reason one sees some INFP-ESTJ relationships and no successful INFP-ESTP relationships, you know? Generally speaking, the most successful ones make sense cognitive function-wise."
infj,3bublx,TheQuietudeAbides,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:51:48 2015 UTC,"Married 5 years, became a MFF triad recently. (M=ENTP, F=ESFP) Like everyone else has said, it's super DUPER important to communicate. I don't find this to be too difficult since my spouse and I share the Fe Ti functions but it's been a bit more challenging with our third who is a sensor. I find with her it's important to keep things based in reality, not get too abstract except on certain topics she's very well-versed in. With him, communication has never been overly difficult; even when our T and F bump up against each other badly, or the J and P make us drive each other insane, the fact that we can always just sit down and talk it out (even if we feel like we're going insane trying to find a common ""wavelength"" sometimes). I've never spent more than 24 hours angry with him or more importantly feeling unresolved. We are both independent but appreciative of company and we are best friends that respect each other. That part is really important; the ""shiny, new!"" will wear off eventually and being best friends is what will keep you together and solid. We've never fallen completely out of love with each other but there have been points where we slumped into a rut romantically and being able to talk to each other about that and still enjoy each others company helped us make it through that long enough to remember why we loved each other and fall in love all over again. It's insanely challenging to date me and I know that; both my partners are incredibly giving and forgiving and that's important for an INFJ. I feel incredibly satisfied and complete right now and know that no matter what happens in the future, my ENTP will always be there and my ESFP will always at the very least be my very close friend. It takes work and you have to be paying attention and you have to communicate about everything, but I don't think it's impossible for INFJs to eventually find a relationship we don't want to constantly change and improve, that we just accept and enjoy."
infj,3bublx,bezald,2,Fri Jul 3 16:34:15 2015 UTC,"I've been with my fiance for over 8 years (married this October!) We met in university, and were both in a partying phase. I remember 6 months in, we went to a wedding. It was an open bar, and we were already pretty drunk at dinner time and he said something along the lines of, ""this is different from the other relationships that I've had. I don't see an end to us"" implying he saw a long term future. I remember thinking, that's really sweet, but this guy has barely scratched the surface. Once he finds out the real me, I doubt he'll think that way..  In the months that followed, we both opened up to one another about life (23 and confused about what to do after university) and it turns out we both didn't know what we wanted. We were both getting tired of getting drunk for half the week and wanted friendships that didn't revolve around going to bars.   We spent countless days and nights talking about life, meaning, and how to get satisfaction. It turns out that the more we got to know each other, the more we realized we share the same beliefs, values, and goals. We were able to express what social conventions didn't make sense, without judgement from one another. I think that's when I realized we would be great partners in life.   We're both introverted and intuitive, and he is more of a thinker than I am. While I go off of emotion to make decisions because I just 'know', he always has to understand why. Sometimes that is frustrating to me, but other times, he balances my impulsiveness out. Conversely, he is so much of a thinker that he can rationalize himself into oblivion, and I help him frame decisions from another perspective so he can finally move forward.   I'm happy to say that it has been relatively smooth sailing, and the things that felt challenging at the time were actually lessons learned about one another and life."

We aren't mushy or constantly snapping lovey selfies - we rarely do PDAs - I would say we are deeply in love and a lot of it is behind closed doors... We have nothing to prove to anyone.  I would say the best thing my husband gives me is space and understanding. He figured out before I did that I need time alone or just us to recharge and always tried to help make that happen.  In turn, he got into reading and similar subjects to me because he saw how much I enjoyed it. I don't think he had ever finished a book before we were together.  On the flip side - He also got me into travelling and going places I'd never had the confidence to go to. The challenge is getting me to make the most of each day - he is always wanting to be busy, but I need to soak things up slowly. All these years later we are still looking for the middle ground."

The first two were long relationships (one nearly 10 years, another four) but short marriages (a little over a year each time).    I knew that the third one was a keeper when he immediately started talking in-depth with anything I brought up. Talking to him was effortless and comfortable, and he genuinely laughed at my jokes.     The next clue was that he was a grown-ass man who did things like take the trash out on his own, and do his own laundry, and use the vacuum cleaner.  He paid his bills, called his Momma, and never forgot a single thing I said (even when he didn't appear to be listening).    After we moved in together I realized that I'd made a really good choice, because he takes no offense if I disappear into my woman-cave for hours on end, and happily accommodates my loathing of large social events while simultaneously nudging me into a social life that I actually enjoy."

infj,3btxyw,carelessdrifter,5,Thu Jul 2 16:01:43 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I've found that INFJs and INFPs tend to write very differently; I can spot a mistyped INFP immediately.   INFJs tend to be much more analytical and precise than INFPs and their writing reflects this. INFJs also seem to be more focused on doing and putting plans into real-world action while INFPs tend to cocoon themselves in their own worlds more.  Both INFPs and INFJs can be very creative and I've actually found INFJs to be better writers, generally speaking."

Even now, I have an idea for a story (may be short, may end up being a novel, not entirely sure how it's going to evolve) itching to get out, and it's definitely a fantasy story.  I understand people pretty well, finding it fairly easy to connect with others, and I find people more interesting than cosmic laws.  I do find things such as quantum mechanics interesting, but people more so.  Likewise, my INFP friend is a true artist, but she's better with drawings than with words--and not everything she paints is beautiful.  She captures a pretty dark side of the human psyche when she wants to.  She, however, struggles to understand other people and can sometimes be a bit blunt with her opinions.  She's actually not that great with words at all--there have been plenty of occasions where people have been offended by things she has said when she meant the complete opposite of how they interpreted it."

I suppose there's some basis for these stereotypes, but they downplay the abilities of INFPs to understand reality and of INFJs to invent.   As a counterexample, my INFJ is much more interested and much better at creative writing and inventing characters and storylines than I am. And I regularly help her with strategy and tactics and figuring out how to navigate challenging real world situations due to my ability to understand both the good and ugly sides of human nature."

I'm 19 and I started working there a year ago at entry level with little to no skills in any profession or industry. Fast-forward to now: I have more developed leadership skills, analytical skills, and time/resource management skills. I get the chance to troubleshoot solutions to both inventory problems and people problems. Am I passionate about ensuring on-time delivery of packages? Contributing to materialism and the wealth of some multi-billionaire? No, but I can say that I learn something new every single day. I empower others and I pass on what I've learned to them. I'm taking advantage and building skills that, considering my age and background, I would not have the opportunity to anywhere else. So...dream job? Hell no. It's challenging. Especially mandatory 50hr weeks. One day I'll move on to something that better aligns with my values - hopefully that pays better. In the meantime, I'm interested in growing with the company, simply because that opportunity is available to me. (I interviewed today for a position on the leadership team and feel confident that I'm the strongest candidate). The job takes grit. It's all so arbitrary, but I paint meaning where there is none. I am a teacher, a leader who serves others, and an innovator from the time I punch in on that time clock. You can love any job if you can just find reasons to be grateful, to consider yourself fortunate. I hope this doesn't fall on deaf ears because really-- this is the number one trade secret: Be happy.

Maybe take some baby steps with your passion. Quiting your job and settling on something else just to make more time for your hobbies might create other problems.

infj,3btvpn,beeman4266,4,Thu Jul 2 02:49:32 2015 UTC,"One thing that I found difficult to do initially, but was vital for my own well-being, was learning how to draw boundaries.  I used to try so hard to make everyone else so happy that I neglected my own self in the process.  Now, if I need a break from people, I say so--and they understand, because they know it's nothing personal, I just need to recharge.  It's much healthier than holding it all in and then freaking out."
infj,3btvpn,Intempestivity,2,Thu Jul 2 04:22:17 2015 UTC,"I used to do this.  If you're getting to the point where you need to ignore people in order to get time to cool and calm yourself, then you are probably going in over your head. If you are anything like me, then you'd agree that it feels nice to be that person who other people can come to for comfort; to be the person who is always there no matter what. The issue I found with that is that I was not being fair to myself.   Instead, you might want to try to set some new standards. You shouldn't let it get to the point where you need to ignore people. Instead of being the person that drops everything and responds to someone within 5 seconds, maybe wait a few minutes, finish up what you are doing, and then talk to them. Then, when you are talking to someone, if you find yourself thinking ""hmm, I've been talking to them for 45 minutes now, but I would really rather be doing ______"", then just finish up the conversation and go back to what you are doing.   When I did this at first, it felt wrong to me to place my own wants and needs above those of others. But it was pretty quickly that I realized that nobody really cares that much once they get used to how you operate. That's why I called it ""setting a new standard"". You can still be a friend to people, a role model, whatever you want to be. You don't even have to tell them ""I'm going to start taking some time for myself."", even if that is what you are really doing. Just do it and they will adapt. Have a certain level of respect for your own time and other people will get in tune with that and everything will eventually balance out."
infj,3btvpn,griever989,2,Thu Jul 2 05:49:19 2015 UTC,"The most important thing I learned as an INFJ is to respect and follow my own desire for recharge time. Some days I get up in the morning and I am still so drained I have to take a nap an hour later. What you need to master is finding a way to let other people know when they have to respect your need for a bist of distance.  My mother broke up with her long-term partner half a year ago and I was supposed to be her rock. It was so draining that I myself bordered on depression, because in her own desperation she did not respect my boundaries, limits and capabilities. I can only advise you to never let it get that far. You will pay a high price.  What I learned however is that people that love you will understand. I had an open talk with most people close to me at one time or another and I told them that there are times where I can't function socially and that there are times when I can't be that rock. So these days, when my mom starts complaining in texts and I know that I don't have the energy, I tell her exactly that in those exact words. She has learned to accept that and she realized that it does not diminish my love for her.  Another example where I didn't handle it well was a few weeks ago, when I was supposed to attend a party. I woke up knowing that I was not in a good place. I tried to really change it. I played uplifting party music, I treated myself to a bubble bath and I tried to get in the mood for some fun with friends. It did not work. Instead of suffering through this evening I just cancelled. And it was the right decision.  Your limits are there for a reason. You need to respect them."

However, what bothers me is that I like you am a vocal point for a lot of different people, but no one returns the favor when I need it. So often times when I am faced with hardship I'm left alone in the cold to deal with it myself. It just seems really unfair... Idk if its because people think I'm just strong enough to handle it or maybe I'm just not expressive enough about how I am doing... It just seems hard to find support when you are the support"

These two sentiments seemingly conflict.  Are you really interested in playing peace keeper all the time or is it possible you do it to meet other people's expectations?  Maybe that's why you feel vindictive or resentful sometimes.  Perhaps try being be a bit more selfish or less concerned when you don't want to deal with other people's problems.  I find my mediating efforts are more reactive these days.  I guess I use it as a subtle diplomatic tool to persuade or gain trust from others rather than in as a proactive tool.

infj,3brj61,wildernessexplorer,28,Wed Jul 1 15:55:43 2015 UTC,"Criticism that is constructive in nature does not bother me at all.  Rather, I tend to appreciate that someone is taking time to correct me or give their opinion.  Maybe there is something I could be doing better, etc.  I generally reserve constructive criticism for people I respect, so I take that in stride when I receive it.  That said, I am a sensitive person, and comments that are overly critical or negative can upset me easily.  Sometimes a person's idea of ""criticism"" is really just rattling off complaints, offering no advice, being hurtful instead of helpful.  This really gets to me.  It makes me feel like I'm failing as a human on some infinite level, or at least failing the person delivering the criticism.  I don't really become offended over anything ""external"" if that makes sense.  I don't take it personally when someone makes a hideously disagreeable comment about politics, for example.  I like to discuss those things and try to find some common ground.  I guess my point is that I am not easily offended in general, but when things get personal, I do take it personally.  (Derp!)"

infj,3brj61,gdubbz,15,Wed Jul 1 22:22:07 2015 UTC,"Offended?  No.  It requires a sledge hammer to offend me.    Am I easily hurt?  Yes, some things can hurt me very easily.  I seriously don't like being laughed at for my foibles by a group of people.  Bullying of any kind tends to make me angry.    If it's someone I don't know, then cruelty sorta rolls off my back.  Why bother with responding?  I probably won't see that person again."
infj,3brj61,Chessiecat,4,Wed Jul 1 20:19:45 2015 UTC,"I also encourage and welcome any constructive criticism. It is really appreciated if someone would take their time, to help me improve in an area where I may be lacking. This is of course not the responsibility of anyone else to do, but if I am to offer someone help, I do like to take the time and give some input or guidance that hopefully is valuable.   When it comes to learning and teaching, sure there may be standards which works for most, but it is important to keep in mind, that not everyone learns things best in the same way as others. I like to observe things first when I encounter something new, then I typically proceed to attempt myself. Other times I prefer having someone guide me as I follow step by step, it depends on the topic.  I am however not easily offended, in fact I don't recall the last thing that offended me. When it comes to people throwing their opinions or insults at you, it usually shows more about them, with the way they present their views or wrath. A lot of humans are less savvy when it comes to dealing with their own frustration, so they often make target of others because of their own anger and inability to relay their thoughts in a proper way. If you can't communicate your frustration in a competent way, then you more than likely need to work on your social and human skills.  Perhaps this is simplifying matters too much, but in this sense I just have a hard time to be offended, since a lot boils down to other humans being ignorant and bigoted. That said I do understand that there are those with issues who perhaps for very valid reasons can't control their actions completely. Maybe this is a completely separate topic but it is also something to take into consideration before you start taking offense from anything said.  There is every chance that my view and natural calm manners is viewed as unnatural , but then again what is natural? If the large majority of people get upset easily, should this be considered the norm? Food for thought at least. Overall try not to take things too seriously or be offended by too much, it does depend a lot on the context of things, hopefully if you are speaking to someone respectful they will reciprocate in an equal way."

Few things actually offend me to the point I respond: 1) When people attack me BECAUSE of my personal values and beliefs 2) When people assume my feelings/intentions/etc. without talking to me about it first  As far as constructive criticism goes, I welcome it with open arms.

On first review, it sounds like, ""you teach who you are to others"", and that's not particularly deep, mysterious, nor fitting.   However, if the meaning were more along the lines of ""KNOW YOURSELF WELL, BECAUSE YOU TEACH YOURSELF WHO YOU ARE.""  that makes a lot more sense.  If the topic is about discovery and finding yourself through introspection, it's more likely or relevant that your subconscious and unknown self will reveal or ""teach"" your consciously searching mind who you are in your entirety. In order for you to learn who that is, you have to show up to class and do the work :P . At least that's how I interpreted it.

These interactions I had with myself lead me to surprising discoveries about myself (duh), how I work, what lurks below the surface of my conscious, led later to an agreement with Jung's idea of archetypes (to some extent, not fully at the moment). However, at the same time it felt like using a magnifying glass in direct sun: incredibly illuminating, but beware of burning the subject.   so they heard me yelling at myself from inside my pants   Haha :) I can imagine that. My most successful ringtone was Geiger counter noises. O, the looks I was getting :D"
infj,3bsaiq,MemoriesOfSelf,2,Fri Jul 3 23:37:43 2015 UTC,"Don't feel shame about that! It's how I mull over a lot of important decisions; I act out the scene in my head but often out loud, answering the different ways I anticipate the other person(s) might respond. It helps me sort out how I feel about things without risking another person(s) getting hurt by my raw, unprocessed feelings (which I find can be quite sharp and often not really ""authentic"" to how I actually feel. A lot of times I feel like my J comes out in my initial reactions to things, with the Fe assigning a negative judgement to something before I can process it through my more perceiving and open Ni.)"
infj,3bsaiq,altruisticspring,2,Thu Jul 2 13:34:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I don't worry too much about talking to myself, when I externalize the thoughts and let them sink again to re-evaluate. <- A fancy description that is, haha It's just that I did take it to a completely different level, where I started impersonating a character, in fact two characters at once. To both of whom I can relate, and how that made me feel. My original post wasn't very clear, please accept my apologies!"
infj,3bsaiq,MemoriesOfSelf,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:42:31 2015 UTC,"I talk to myself quite often, (hopefully when people don't notice,) but when I do, I find that it's one of the only times when I purposefully engage in argument. Because I can always win, haha. But it's usually like I'm talking to another person, and I kind of try to think of all the possible arguments they might have to my point, and contest them. It's a little odd I guess, but it helps me understand my worldview better. It must result from a combination of the Ni and Fe, wanting to figure things out together."
infj,3bsaiq,jeff233,2,Fri Jul 3 07:14:00 2015 UTC,"Boy, do I get looks when I talk to myself at work :P I find it quite entertaining to observe people in this mode and see how they react and what it brings out in them.     to think of all the possible arguments they might have to my point, and contest them   That's much closer to what I, ehem... did once. It started by pretending to be two characters to whom I can closely relate, two sides of my personality, who, frighteningly so, claimed my attention later at unexpected levels. It didn't go over board, nor I need nor needed admittance, medication etc. A valuable experiment, that I still keep with me, but being slightly worried of it being to comforting to go into this again.   It must result from a combination of the Ni and Fe, wanting to figure things out together.    I think you are absolutely right. Ni allows the existence of 'another' due to its nature of acquired complexity. And Fe, well, it wants an objective opinion not always available externally, so... :)"

infj,3bsaiq,sexydeathmonkey,2,Thu Jul 2 03:46:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, I definitely agree about reading a poem aloud to properly evaluate the meter and diction.  What prompted this topic was actually from reading  Marcus Aurelius's Meditations.  Besides savoring a particularly good passage, his sentence structure happens to employ very few periods/full stops and quite a few commas and semi-colons, so a single sentence can easily become the entire paragraph. Re-reading it aloud helps with not only the enjoyment of the content, but a deeper understanding and correct pacing of it."
infj,3bsaiq,altruisticspring,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:35:01 2015 UTC,Interesting to have stumbled upon this. I started to read books aloud to myself a while ago.

infj,3bq4ve,RBONES,39,Wed Jul 1 06:30:02 2015 UTC,"I notice a theme of a lot of us growing into ourselves and our confidence as we get older. While age could be a primary factor in maturity, there are a lot of young subscribers to this sub who are simply trying to learn more about themselves. I'm in my early 30s and still find it fascinating. If they need a little reassurance from a few other INFJs to get out of a mental rut, or move on from a bad relationship, or boost their confidence, I see nothing wrong with that.   We all have bad days, we all have problems. If I'm having a bad day and don't  feel like replying to someone's relationship issue here, I just don't that day.

Here's an INFJ thing for you: It's healthy for us to express ourselves through Fe -- for example, by writing what we feel. What you see as people wallowing in self-doubt, I see as people using this forum as a safe place to express themselves when they're in the grip."
infj,3bq4ve,below_the_line,10,Wed Jul 1 09:20:11 2015 UTC,I agree. I've always liked to think about this as a support group and I know our affinity for counselling so it's really a complementary situation.

It just sounds like you're complaining about the subject matter in these threads. No one is forcing you to stick around here and read about other's issues. Go somewhere else or be the change you want to see in this community. But don't make others feel bad for coming to this community as a safe haven for support.

I miss coming here to find issues that specifically pertain to INFJs... nowadays it's just problems people have with social settings or others wondering about things that may or may not be connected to our personality type.  We're all feelers, and we all like to help others and be helped. I think everyone gets that :) It's hard for all of us to have to put up a strong front and help everyone out all the time and to be socially aware of so much that others miss. That's the reason there's a sub listed on the side called /r/infj_support_group  It doesn't have many posts on it, but I think we should repurpose it to post some of the more personal and less personality-oriented problems we'd like advice for. That's why its in the sidebar, no? :)"
infj,3bq4ve,sarcasticIntrovert,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:46:45 2015 UTC,I saw that sidebar for the support group and frankly there is so little activity there it didn't seem worth looking into let alone posting on.

I'm relatively new to this sub, but I've had similar thoughts.  I've been professionally typed, and while I know there are variations in type, there's some posts that make me think the poster is perhaps better suited to another type.  Something I see a bit of here that kind of bolsters this type of thinking is people saying ""I used to be xxxx, but now I'm INFJ!""  ... you don't change type.  Someone who is ISTJ may grow and develop inferior functions as they grow and develop as a person, but your core is your core, and that's your MBTI.  I think there's a lot of people who have taken the online versions of the test (nothing like the actual versions, by the way), and either because they're daydreamers, or because they're sensitive, or any other myriad of factors, they end up ""typing"" as INFJ.  Just because a person has strong emotions that doesn't make them an INFJ."

infj,3botl9,kawaiisithlord,3,Tue Jun 30 23:29:08 2015 UTC,"For me personally, I typically equate open mindedness with acceptance. Without trying to be argumentative, I personally don't see anything very open minded about finding something (eg, your aforementioned views on polygamy, gay marriage, and abortion) ""gross"" or ""scandalous"". That's (again, in my perspective) not open minded, because you're judging it from the get go. Now, that's just a human characteristic, and as long as no one hurts anyone else in any way or infringes on their beliefs or rights, I don't see anything wrong with having dissenting views on things. I just honestly don't understand how automatically finding someone's actions gross, despite not openly treating them like garbage makes someone open minded. Shouldn't treating people with respect and compassion be the bare minimum for interaction? Accepting or being open to differences is something entirely separate. I'm definitely open minded, so to speak, to listening to anyone who can peaceably elaborate on the matter. :)"
infj,3botl9,poppy_moonray,2,Wed Jul 1 00:28:39 2015 UTC,"I think what you're talking about is technically social acceptance, which is tolerating the differences between groups of people without necessarily taking them on to your own, in which case that would be equitable with open-mindedness, as acceptance means you take on other's ideas in to your own philosophy.  And social acceptance is sort of where we get in to the grey area--at what point do we draw the line within social acceptance?  Is it ok to understand, from an intellectual perspective, why people may do things that you personally disapprove of, and is being tolerant of their decisions?  Or is tolerance more of an emotional based reaction, where you are able to sympathise with why someone would do things and, although you personally would not do those things for various reasons, you do not disapprove of them or of the people who choose to engage in such actions?  For the record, I agree with you that social acceptance and open-mindedness are the same thing, and I believe that tolerance is more emotional and less intellectual, and one should not call themselves open-minded or socially accepting of others unless they actually don't disapprove of their actions, regardless of whether or not they themselves would participate in such actions."

I guess that's the crux of my feelings toward it right then and there. I commend the OP and others for not treating people poorly, and fully agree that everyone has reasons for their actions. There's been innumerable times where someone's said or done something to myself or a loved one where I'm seriously baffled as to their justification or logic in acting that way, but regardless, they had their reasoning for it. I do find it important to try to empathize and see their viewpoint, and I believe I overwhelmingly do. My only hmm moment, I guess is confusion over how someone can mentally find someone's behavior ""gross"" but consider themselves open minded on the subject. I consider myself open minded on all the topics OP mentioned, but I definitely don't find them gross or scandalous. We can take a different topic, in this instance let's say bestiality, and I'd fully admit that I find that to be ""gross"" and ""scandalous"", and therefore I'd conclude myself largely close minded on that subject because unless someone can prove definitively to me that the animal can consent and isn't hurt, I don't think it's moral or acceptable behavior.

It just syncs up with the other person's brain, even if the person is horrible and I disagree with everything they stand for.

For me I am very open minded but I can understand other people's perspective. If they sway me with logic I can easily move over.  For example, with the gay marriage debate I have very strong feelings that the Supreme Court made the right decision. However, I can also understand this is deeply upsetting to people who have strong religious convictions. I don't have to agree with them or change my belief, but I don't feel the need to argue over it.  I was also very supportive of inheritance taxes, but someone pointed out how that effects family farms. I hadn't considered that point of view so I am now undecided until I do more research.

It's like being in a box with zero width, height and depth and being in a box with infinite width, height and depth. With either box you have no understanding of the box.    Is it possible to ""reject everything/accept everything?"" Either way it seems impossible to function in life. You both reject everything and accept everything. You are both you and not you. Logic and reason both make sense and don't make sense. Logic and reason both (make sense and don't make sense) and don't (make sense and don't make sense). Both meta-acceptance and meta-rejectance make sense and don't make sense. And so on.    So this subjective boundary X (now a range between two angles) is likely accepting/rejecting to the point the world beings to crumble and no longer have boundaries. But then the boundary doesn't exist beyond the boundary. It's like a 2D plane with only one face. Is that still a boundary? Or like a one way door that you can only tell if you passed through it if you didn't pass through it. Is that still a boundary?    Perhaps rejecting everything and accepting everything only seem extreme because we can't seem. ""I don't understand this therefore it must be like this."" Which is arguing from ignorance.    TL;DR: Yes because we haven't passed through the door and therefore still see the door. No because we haven't passed through the door and therefore don't not see the door. Maybe because we haven't passed through the door and therefore haven't seen both sides of the door.    Edit: grammar and added edit."

infj,3botl9,7sshare,2,Wed Jul 1 07:02:17 2015 UTC,"I think that if you disapprove of something someone does, even if you understand it on an intellectual level, that's not being open-minded.  I don't think you should have opinions on people's lifestyles.  Why would you have an opinion on someone who has coloured hair, or whether or not they marry, or what they do with their bodies in any way, shape or form?  It may not be something you would do to your body, but that doesn't give you the right to judge anyone who does it with theirs.  That's closed-minded.    Understanding something intellectually and having an opinion on it is different to being tolerant of other people's actions, even if you personally would not engage in them.  For example, I would never dye my hair bleach blonde, get a spray tan, get fake nails and tattoo eyeliner on.  I don't disapprove of anyone who does that, though.  I don't think they're shallow or fake or any other negative adjective you may think could apply.  I also would never cut my hair very short, wear men's clothing and wear a binder.  I don't think people who do are gross or wrong, and I certainly don't disagree with it.  I think they are who they are.  In both examples, I'm happy that those things make the other person feel happy and fulfilled.  To answer your question, is there such a thing as being ""too open minded""?  Yes, if you can socially accept behaviour that is harmful to others, then that's too far.  Again, I'm talking about social acceptance, not intellectual understanding of reasoning or psychology.  If you can let a person hurt an innocent person or animal because that's just who they are, that's taking open-mindedness too far."
infj,3botl9,demesure,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:30:09 2015 UTC,"Lately I have really been feeling that most people's opinions are projections of their own inner conflicts, and are rarely based on sound information. I used to hold very strong opinions but now I am rather proud of the fact that I can stand aside from things and not argue with people. But I also feel fickle and indecisive, because I find myself not willing to commit to viewpoints, or honestly not really caring enough about social / political issues to do any research."

infj,3botl9,poetichearts,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:19:15 2015 UTC,"I read recently (don't remember where, sorry) about how with our judging (Fe) function, we can be too dismissive of new ideas and that we should be open and allow things to process through our more perceiving (Ni) dominant function first. To me, this seems like a good approach; if you're anything like me, your intuition is often more ""authentic"" or based in reality than your feelings. If I let myself respond emotionally to something new, it's often a negative or badly judgmental response. But if I reserve judgment and let it kind of filter through my Ni matrix until it finds some good connections and integrates, my response is much more measured and logical.  So, I'd say let yourself have time with new ideas. Yes, be open minded but when you've allowed yourself enough time for your mind to really evaluate the idea fully, trust how you now respond to it. You might change your mind later and that's fine. I know we INFJs struggle with this concept, but it is often not a black and white issue. There are degrees of complexity to everything and it can be hard for us to reconcile that, in addition to struggling to separate how we feel with the empathetic vibrations caused by other people's strong opinions."

I feel the same way about a lot of things, I could fall onto either side of the debate depending on the day. I sit back and can see how people come to their beliefs and realize there is no point fighting anyone, or trying to prove people wrong, nor is there necessarily a 'right' or 'wrong' opinion. The people who I enjoy conversing with the most are the ones who are open minded and don't take a firm position, rather than the people who are certain they are right. So is there a thing as being too open minded? Well not really, I think.. thinks about it from the other point of view"

With every other person, when I say things I know what kind of reaction to expect.

But, as long as I mention what is bothering me, she will do everything in her power to try to make me feel better, and on points that she knows bother me, we have a connection where she understands not to push it. We've known each other for a long time though. I knew an acquaintance in school as well who I'm pretty sure is a ENTP guy. He likeed to play devil's advocate a lot in class, but whenever I spoke to him, he seemed like a perfectly nice and considerate dude, as long as I made myself and my position known.

Might be tough for the others, but I found no sense in planning an event I wouldn't enjoy anymore for people I didn't like. No guilt.  Things are different when my heartbroken mother needs me and I know she is sitting at home crying. This can happen on days on which I don't have the energy to indulge her self-pity. I just want to shake her and tell her to get a grip, but that would be highly inappropriate. So I ask her call a friend instead of me, because I can't help her that day. That makes me feel guilty."

I introduce myself and shook her hand, my palms were really sweaty, which made me even more nervous. We and our mutual friends all end up going to a bar together, we flirt, I get close to her, she pulls away. At that point I thought I blew it, went to the bar to get a drink. Then, all of sudden she shows up right by my side and looks up at me with the biggest bedroom eyes. I was in a trance, I just kissed her right there and then. Instant connection, we made love what seemed like 100 times that week. It was the most passionate sex of my life, everything before in comparison was boring and empty, sans when I first lost my virginity in highschool and sex was exciting because it was new. I told her I loved her at the end of the week accidently. Even though it was true, I wasn't about to tell someone I had only known a week that I was in love with them. I said it during the heat of the moment, and stopped with terror when I heard the words come out of mouth, but she said I love you too, and it was on from there."

Does the individual in question exhibit some form of character that triggers receptivity in you? Or engages in an unusual behaviour towards you that you wonder about the underlying reason behind it (not necessarily intention but perhaps a sequence of events that shaped up to it)?

I had no idea how much more there was to him, and that he would end up basically saving my life.  Although sometimes my intuitions are right. In the years before I really got to know my first girlfriend, I knew that something was going to happen. After I got to know my her, I knew something was going to go wrong if I asked her out.  Nevertheless, I followed my heart.  Sure enough, the relationship came to a bittersweet end.  But even though she's gone know, she's going to be involved in my future.  I don't know if one of us will need help, or one of us will have an accident, or we are going to be forced to work together on a project, or we'll actually end up back together...  but something is going to happen.  For better or for worse, something is going to happen with her in it.   I just know it.  Another example was an old highschool teacher...  she never actually taught any of my classes, but I had a really good feeling about her.  On the last day of senior year I came into her classroom and talked with her.  I found out that she chose the same career path and used to be a naturalist, and that she said I could help her with conservation work that summer.

A cheater accuse me of cheating. I'm open to looking at my flaws and growing, but I also wish others would see that they are looking at life through their own frame of reference. I know if I point things out bluntly to them, our relationship would be ruined. It's uncomfortable when someone is angry at you for telling what you think."

To me what this describes is precisely the same thing as science does, only in different language. It's a guideline manual that helps us navigate around the world using different perspectives, the more perspectives we understand the more adaptive we can be when encountering unexpected situations in life. Learning about this theory in no way demands a person to abandon their ability to reason, the two can operate coincide each other.  I don't know what kind of people you've encountered before that makes you shun on this so eagerly, but if it displeases you so much feel free to cast that downvote, whatever makes you happy."
infj,3bntq4,Chessiecat,-1,Wed Jul 1 08:48:05 2015 UTC,"Language is all important.  This describes no deep science, nor any intelligent concepts.  This is woo-woo hand-waving garbage, and you should feel ashamed for having given it the time of day.    This is not a guide-line or a manual.  This is pure, brainless trash assembled for the gullible to give them a sense of control in a world where they control nothing.  This is not a theory.  A theory requires a testable hypothesis.  You can only test this crap subjectively.  I am appalled that in a day and age where we can scan the mind with an EEG, where we can manipulate the psyche with everything from electrical stimulation to drugs, where we are beginning to understand our brains in ways we have never chanced to do before that there are people still happily waddling along behind any fool offering 'special powers'.    Go find someplace else to peddle your wares.  We don't need it here.  We're already full up on plenty of bullshit that doesn't require an abandonment of rational thinking to believe."
infj,3bntq4,Chessiecat,3,Wed Jul 1 09:30:32 2015 UTC,"I take great concern at this reductive statement regarding brain scan and biomedicine. Even with undeniably advanced technology we still can not understand the brain to its entirety, otherwise treating mental disorder would be a much easier task. It's so much more than just having MRI scan and popping pills on daily basis, traditionally therapy is required to alleviate symptoms of disorder as much as possible, drugs are only there to prevent relapses.  When we talk about therapy we must also talk about subjectivity. Aaron Beck developed CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) as a model to help patients understand the cycle of depression better, and it had since been used as standard treatment for many other conditions such as eating disorder and anxiety. Dr. Marsha Linehan developed DBT (Dialectal Behavioural Therapy) specifically to tackle Borderline Personality Disorder, a highly problematic condition where patients suffer from overwhelming fear of abandonment and fluctuation of emotion. Linehan derived DBT partially from the Buddhism concept of ""mindfulness"", and had since benefited many BPD patients in the world.  According to you, CBT and DBT could have very well be an entirely subjective creation too, but if it does help us better understand human psyche I don't see why it should be shunned upon.  What I find even more odd is that if you are so repelled by subjective construct, why are you even on an MBTI subreddit? There are not enough empirical studies done on MBTI to prove its existence in objective world, it's just a framework for us to understand human psyche like CBT, DBT and chakra.  Like I said before, learning about chakra does not entail abandoning ones ability to reason, it just means seeing things from more than one perspective. I can wholeheartedly believe in the result of MRI and biomedicine while still integrating the understanding of chakra when thinking on certain topics. There is nothing to fear about chakra as new idea, it may or may not be applicable but there is nothing to lose either way.  And what do you mean by ""we""? What makes you presume that you speak on behalf of everyone on this subreddit?"

Your comment is the epitome of rational close-mindedness and intolerance. It is akin to an atheist verbally vomiting all over a religious person for handing out pamphlets in public.

infj,3bla9r,enfpgyal,11,Tue Jun 30 03:33:02 2015 UTC,"I tend to think INFJs are prone to LDRs in general. The idea of being connected to someone, yet maintaining some independence and personal space seems to be something we'd flock to. I don't think he's going to have a problem with it, but whatever helps you feel more connected to him will be good. Skyping at least once a week so you guys can see each other helps solidify things and keep them feeling real instead of just abstract text.    But when it comes to text, I think writing letters is also very intimate. Seeing someone's thoughts written in their own hand can be very personal and something they can take out and re-read and cherish. When was the last time you received a love letter--it's long overdue! We do well when we get the chance to collect our thoughts before we say them, so this might be a good way for you guys to share your feelings. Also, having a letter arrive in your mailbox is almost a forgotten pleasure these days. It might be fun!"
infj,3bla9r,lzimmy,8,Tue Jun 30 04:26:13 2015 UTC,"Yeppp I'm in this situation too. For me, I feel better connected over regular skype sessions than by text.

We would typically be on Skype as much as humanly possible, fall asleep with Skype on, and sometimes wake up to one another on Skype as well.  Even if that doesn't work for you two, I'm sure you'll find a way to make it happen, INFJs know how to commit if we're bonded at a deep level."

We used Skype a lot, and I sent him a lot of photos. I wanted to feel we were not far apart even if we couldn't see each other with little things, like wanting to know what caught his eye during the day or planning things to do when we had the possibility to see each other. We also watched movies and played games online. (but he was an ISFJ so he was really into this kind of stuff like me)"
infj,3bla9r,isil90,2,Tue Jun 30 10:46:49 2015 UTC,Male INFJ here and I have had a lot of experience with LDR.  I was very close with my SO so in my head it was much less of a long distance relationship.  I would often consider my SO reaction to things I was doing without them having to be around. We text and spoke on the phone often (Skype wasn't really a thing at the time). My biggest issue was some of the phone call that went on much longer than they should have.  I found it draining to be sitting on the phone in complete silence or very slow conversation . I felt at that point it was encroaching on my alone time. I was the one way from home going to school so I often had people overload. I had a hard time ending to phone call in those situations because I didn't want to hurt her feelings.  It's an odd concept but even when I am away I still needed time alone.   For me I didn't need constant reassurance that she was still thinking about me.  I could just tell by the text messages and phone calls that everything was alright.
infj,3bla9r,6the6bull6,2,Tue Jun 30 16:33:32 2015 UTC,"Just be consistent in contact. If you say you will skype/call/facetime at 7, then do it. Send gifts, just because. If they are into you, and you make a regular daily effort, they should be fine with long distance. Don't let interactions stay superficial, be real, deep, share the emotions of your day. It just could be harder for you to stay focused on this relationship if the new city and new friends distract you. I know from experience going a week without unexplained contact, not answering texts or emails can be really hurtful to an infj..they may feel forgotten and hurt."

I can only tell you what worked for us and I think the fact that we share dominant Ni helped. Anyway, the best thing for us was being consistent. We had a schedule and spoke every night if we could as soon as I got off work. He sacrificed sleep with the time differnce just so we could have that time. Granted, a lot of the time he fell asleep after ten mins but that never bothered me because he was there when he was meant to be. We would tell eachother early in the day if we had plans with friends so we could adjust our evenings if we wanted. We took turns flying out every 6 months. We had secretly decided early on that we wanted to marry eachother (we have known each other for twelve years) and when he proposed 5 years ago it gave us more direction and focus. Finally immigration is all over! And we married last October. Be flexible, make sure you are going in the same direction and be consistent to establish trust.   Good Luck!"

I would say make time to Skype/FaceTime him, not just texting/calling. If you two are working, schedule a time at the end of the day. Frequent face-to-face communication is really important. He may not always show that he misses you, but let him know that you can't wait to see him! Also, when I was in a 4-month LDR with my boyfriend, he sent me a small care package with things that reminded him of me or something that represents an inside joke between us. Little thoughtful things like that really made the LDR better. Hope this helps, LDRs aren't easy but it'll be so worth it in the end."

Everyone thought my mother was great so I didn't even realize how horrible she was until recently. Do some reading on narcissism and emotional abuse, you might recognize your childhood there.

When you are raised by narcissists, or otherwise controlling unhealthy parents, you develop parts of your brain I think to protect yourself, to ""tune in"" to how they are going to behave on any particular day, to feel unworthy of love (or anything), to never trust, and to eventually accept the blame for everything that goes wrong.

infj,3bjlwg,brizzle227,10,Mon Jun 29 19:28:49 2015 UTC,"I guess my only advice is be very clear about stating your feelings (or lack thereof) about something. Sometimes INFJs can read more into a situation than what's actually there.  The only times I've had ""problems"" with ENTP friends is when their actions and words weren't matching up, which leaves things open to assumptions and interpretations. That's dangerous, because our minds can fill in those blanks very creatively. It's better to just have things out in the open where they don't become problems. Also, don't deliberately hide things from your INFJ, even if you're doing it because you think they'd rather not know.  Whatever it is, knowing you kept it from us on purpose is so much worse than whatever you're trying to protect us from.  Anything that can be interpreted as being disingenuous or manipulative is a big red flag for us. Not that I'm saying you'd do that, but it's something to keep in mind.   The only thing we ever fought about were social/ethical issues, and although the discussion got very heated, it was in no way damaging. We'd both get riled up and then forget about it the next day and go on business as usual. Things got so much better for both of us when I took them completely at face value and they just accepted I had certain boundaries/principles I wasn't interested in them trying to dismantle.

infj,3bjlwg,jeff233,3,Mon Jun 29 21:49:12 2015 UTC,"The ENTP thread is insightful.  We are definitely more goal-oriented and tend to want to plan things just to stay organized with our lives. My ENTP is spontaneous and prefers not to stick to a schedule which I'm okay with because I have impulses too (Se). He's patient in waiting for me to finish doing something before moving onto something else.  We listen more than we talk. We absorb your tone more than your words. We like our alone time to recharge. We don't find a need for a lot of social stimulation. We will initiate if given the chance. Our conversations are of substance and we find it difficult to entertain the details that happen daily.  Coming from a biased ENTP-INFJ relationship, my SO really does complement what I lack. An important aspect is open communication and not being frustrated with each other's method of approach. If you share the same values, you two can solve problems and reach conclusions very easily. Wish you all the best."

infj,3bjlwg,bigbohemia,2,Mon Jun 29 23:34:35 2015 UTC,"I (female INFJ) recently ended a relationship with a male ENTP. Our relationship was great and our chemistry was almost instant. If it hadn't been for him cheating I'm confident we would still be together. What was interesting, though, were the traits that were exasperated during the break up. His desire to debate EVERYTHING was no longer enticing and thought provoking, instead it became a constant fuel on any fire. It was as if he couldn't turn his devil's advocate off, making working through a really tough situation near impossible. My sensitivities of course were enhanced and my overthinking went into overdrive causing me to dive deeper in to my own head and be even more conflict avoidant. Had our situation not been so bleak, we could have worked through these individual stances to come to a solution and a better method of communication.   That said, I can see how that scenario could occur in any INFJ / ENTP relationship if there is a communication breakdown during a time of high stress. I don't wish infidelity on anyone so I pray you never have to deal with that, but keep those traits in mind if ever dealing with a tough time in your relationship."

infj,3bk42e,joyfulmastermind,8,Mon Jun 29 21:40:56 2015 UTC,"I think you need to let go of this one. Go out and be social and maybe you'll meet other potentials!  Yes, maybe after a long time you could reconnect, at least as a friend, if you are convinced he has changed. But don't expect it or wait for it, or you'll do yourself a disservice.   INFJs are - or at least I am - very forgiving, often too much so, when I find that really things that bother us about someone now will probably continue to bother us down the road.   He's giving you reason for pause. I doubt you'll easily get over what he has done. If you do overlook it, it might bite you later.   For me, it's super important in a relationship that my values align with my partner's. You're already seem to be saying that he is going ""against your morals."" If I were you, I'd try to run away now before you start idealizing him or believing he'll change!"
infj,3bk42e,infjtoday,5,Mon Jun 29 21:57:01 2015 UTC,"This is stuff I need to hear more often. One thing I keep saying to myself lately is ""Why do I always find people with so many problems?"" I'm attracted to people who ""need"" me, and then I am disappointed when they're incapable of being an equal participant in a relationship. I end up being an enabler, which is never fun.   It's relatively difficult for me to meet new people. Usually it happens in classes, when it's easy to start up a casual conversation about an assignment or a professor. Since it's summer though, and my summer job is a lonely computer one, I barely even see anybody else in a day, let alone get a chance to socialize with them. I think I'm just going to wait until fall to try and meet people again. I have enough planned this summer and enough friends that it shouldn't be a problem."

Have a good summer either way!"
infj,3bk42e,Paragonight,3,Tue Jun 30 05:03:38 2015 UTC,"It can be difficult to let things or people go, because we typically attach us damn well to others, that if any kind of detachment should happen, something would break..possibly within us. This is the struggle we live with, because we want to believe that people can change, and what if they did!  In that sense it's easy for us to get caught up in thoughts about all the ways a person might redeem him- or herself. Truth is that sometimes we just need to let go, but our forgiveness can be to our own detriment. Depending on where your own morals are, I believe that it is important to not compromise them, because it  potentially jeopardizes your entire integrity, and you could find yourself forgiving even more and end up being a magnet to people that are trouble.  I do choose people I let close carefully too, although typically they manage to filter themselves out through actions or rather lack thereof. It can be difficult to make true friends, but not impossible. We do have to keep a fine balance between letting people in and also shutting out those who's values aren't in alignment with our own.  Typically those who we get along the best with, are those who do not impose directly or indirectly any kind of problems. It's a gamble if you wish to forgive him, and already thinking about second chance. He may never do again, but none of us can guarantee you that. In the end it's a choice you have to live with, can you deal with being let down another time, even if that will be the last one you'll accept? Or do you do believe it's better to let go, and start on a new adventure to find someone who will not put you in such a position in the first place.  There really isn't a right or wrong way, it's your call, personally I'd always be skeptical, but it's because many lack the effort to actually deal with their issues. That said some people can change, but hopefully you can judge him well enough to make that that final decision."

For me it is definitely more about trust."
infj,3bk42e,lzimmy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:50:13 2015 UTC,"In this case, it didn't affect my trust in ""us"", but it affected my trust in him, if that makes any sense.

infj,3bk42e,joantheunicorn,2,Mon Jun 29 22:20:13 2015 UTC,"I think u/joantheunicorn made a good distinction.  There might be unwelcome actions we don't agree with that don't necessarily translate into being a personal transgression or make them a ""bad person"". There are other things that are very minor that could end up being deal breakers. People we love can make really stupid mistakes. We will make really stupid mistakes that will hurt loved ones too.  I think there's a lot to be said for forgiveness, but you also need to realistically look at whether this person is going to be a negative influence in your life in general.    Talk to him and lay it on the line as honestly as possible. Say how much you care for him but also how worried you are about his actions. Let him plead his case before passing a final judgment.  It's surprising how far kindness and understanding can go in helping someone get their act together than simply cutting them off. Eventually you're just going to go with your gut, but make sure everything is in the open first. Regret is an entirely avoidable emotion, but it requires putting in some effort and going that extra distance to make sure nothing was left unsaid or undone.  Ultimately you're the only one who can make this call."
infj,3bk42e,kookacat,2,Tue Jun 30 04:42:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I always get ""it all on the table"" before burning a bridge. At least all my stuff from my side of the table. If they want to withhold, that is their deal."

I have a tendency to be cold as hell when I've realized that person is not worth my effort or time anymore.  For me, it really depends on who. I was in a toxic relationship for about three years on and off. Took that entire time before I could finally shut him out of my life for good. Other guys I've dated, I had no problem letting go. It was scarily easy. Guys who've played with my feelings after that, same thing. No problem slamming the door in their face.  It really depends on what has been done that hurt me/others. I can hang on to someone as long as I can if I think they're worth keeping/if I am blind to their folly.

infj,3bktrb,danyalzia,2,Tue Jun 30 01:13:26 2015 UTC,"Ti and Te are very different. For one Te is objective, hard, external logic, Ti is internal logic (some could argue it's not objective externally because of it's internal nature). Having high Ti wouldn't make you look like an INTJ but like an INTP rather.  Also I wouldn't get caught up too much in the nicknames. the differences lie within the functions (which you've mentioned here a bit). But really the nicknames are just that--nicknames. But as far as why INTJs got that nickname, I think Intempestivity is spot on."
infj,3bktrb,Thunder_54,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:59:02 2015 UTC,I think an INFJ with high Ti can look both like an INTJ (as both are Ni dominant) and INTP. Fe is an acting function after all.

infj,3bktrb,Intempestivity,3,Tue Jun 30 16:57:52 2015 UTC,"I think it's because ""masterminds"" are associated with logic and executing decisions without feelings.  INFJs use feelings in their decision--it's our default primary function.  We are pretty much the only personality type that can create an idealised vision and then put a plan in to action to see that vision achieved.  INFJs are known for planning and being able to bring plans to fruition.  We just have to be doing it for a greater cause.  INTJs need a logical reason to be creating plans; INFJs need a moral one."
infj,3bktrb,demesure,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:05:42 2015 UTC,"Te has more purpose rooted in rational systems that are made from facts. It will discard theories and concepts that are not supported by relevant facts. Ti is mostly just analyzing and using facts to shape its theories. It will discard facts that do not support its theory, so it is more subjective rationale.  Fe is similar in its purpose being rooted in the harmony of others. It is harnessed from external emotions evident in others. Fi has stronger inner values, it is harder for them to be understood because they process through their subjective morale.  INTJ is the ""Mastermind."" INFJ is the ""Master Manipulator.""  Hitler was INFJ."

infj,3bcpdb,LennonsGhost,5,Sun Jun 28 03:18:20 2015 UTC,"So do INFJs, the thing with INFJs is that we can seem outgoing, because the Ni is essentially invisible to other's whereas what people first see is Fe. Fe is associated with creating an emotion of where everybody is on the same wave length and in agreement with one another.

A common thread in business nowadays is the application of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. It can be applied to employees, customers, and even the entire company. What she saw was the natural-born gift you have in understanding other people's needs. Your place isn't just selling a product, your place is building a vision that makes people want to buy the product.  Think of successful companies like Starbucks, Chipotle, and Apple. Why are they so successful? They appeal to the moral aspect of people to motivate them to action. They have their quality product, their stores are comfortable, they create a sense of community, they create a sense of respect, and give you a sense of self-fulfillment.  Don't think of it as having to deal with people on a daily basis and having to retreat, but rather creating a seamless idea that is always present regardless of your presence."

(Easier said than done, I never listened to that advice when given but now in my thirties I wish I had... So much wanting was such a waste of my time and energy)  First, I came to realize over time that these great packages weren't always great once you get to have it for a while. Some people who have seemingly amazing relationships arent so good and some people I enter so badly to be with ended up prooving to not be a great match after all. Second, we just feel these things stronger than others and you're playing it up in your mind because no one else has entered your life to reroute those ""need to love"" feelings. Third, every relationship is mostly about timing. Not just attraction. It is the hardest thing to accept since we feel we can control that. Like it isn't a good enough excuse why a relationship didn't blossom. But know this. There are so many people out there that are a great package just like her, you'll find one where the timing works out better. You're so young, you have time on your side. and the feels. You'll be fine."
infj,3bbyfe,hintofsass,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:07:00 2015 UTC,"Just to speak about me personally - I was super hung up on someone for a while. After a period of time, I was 95% over them, but that little bit just hung on, and on, and got in the way. It took me a while to realize that a relationship would not have worked out with the person anyways. I tried so hard to meet/date other people and focus on work and friends, but I was not 100% over it like I wanted to be. I never really felt like I had the closure I needed. I eventually decided to have a brief conversation with the person just to make sure the door was closed to anything in the future.   This helped a lot. I'm not necessarily recommending that to you, but I felt that it gave me the freedom to move on.   What really did it was falling for someone else who was a better fit for me. So, if you don't do this already, consider getting out more & meeting more people. Maybe you'll find someone who'll capture your interest similarly, and the timing could work out in your favor this time. If you don't, hopefully it will help distract you.   I kind of feel like this all could be terrible advice, but this is how it worked for me :/  In theory if you just focus more on other aspects of your life and give it time and such it should help, as you know, but we are infjs... :/ Good luck."

At one point I tried to push myself out of my comfort zone by joining different groups and getting out and extroverting more, and then I realized that I really enjoyed that and I got a group of friends out of it. Good distraction, connection, etc.   If you don't get out much with friends, maybe force yourself to do that. Not for the purposes of dating - do it for the purpose of living your life and making friends - but you also never know when you might meet someone.   Re ""falling for someone else"" - I randomly met a guy when I was out, and my Ni started going off like crazy. I had a MASSIVE immediate crush/infatuation...and this time it actually worked out. This plus the closure conversation got me past that last 5%.   If you don't feel like dating, don't date. Just make sure to live your life and do things that are fun and make you feel good.

My argument was that no one would ever clean up the stagnant shit at the bottom of the pot if they never had to smell it.  But sometimes it was just because it was fun.  Or I couldn't help myself.  Or I screwed up.  I try hard not to do that any more.  Partially because it's distinctly less appropriate in a professional work place than in a WoW guild or forum.  But also, because sometimes what I may FEEL is the best for someone else is not my place to create.  My impression as I've gotten older is that it is inappropriate to offer my ""service"" if it's not invited, and there are almost always better ways than impish behavior to offer that service when it IS requested.  If I'm just doing it to enjoy the aftermath, then I've really only served myself.    Intention matters.  If you're stirring the pot to amuse yourself, then it's probably best to find that amusement without toying with other people.  If you're doing it to try to make the world a better place, and if it's not HARMING anyone, then it's probably just fine.  And yes, I suspect that it is a VERY INFJ thing to do."

In that sense it's a balancing act of knowing when to let your impish side out or keep it restrained. I come from an environment, where people can mess with each other as well as make fun of themselves. I do believe there is a certain value in being lighthearted. If you can laugh at yourself, then you typically have a larger understanding of things as well as can take in return what you dish out.  I do think we are very perceptive and can anticipate most outcomes with a high accuracy, which perhaps is why it is that more tempting to ""nudge the hornet's nest"", as you DO realize what you are capable of setting in motion. While we all have different morals, it is also something that is constantly shifting, often based on our mood too. This is why even when something may be globally perceived as sinister, it can sometimes be needed to nudge something in a specific direction, so that you can move boundaries and perhaps also discover new sides of yourself. It's difficult to do with people that are highly sensitive, which is why it is best to apply certain behavior to people you know can take it.  I'm sure some will see this as a pure negative trait, but everything is relative. Overall treat others as you wish to be treated yourself, but many humans seem not to do this. I don't know about you but I'm not the type to be easily offended, in fact I expect any kind of behavior so in that sense, nothing really surprises me anymore.  Fun topic and I'm sure others can relate as well!"
infj,3bba2u,MemoriesOfSelf,2,Sat Jun 27 18:03:51 2015 UTC,"I'm sure some will see this as a pure negative trait   Yeah, I thought I might get some gaff for this, though it hasn't happened yet. Some comment like ""sounds like just being an asshole."" To which I'd reply... no one makes people get angry. There's a difference between being cruel and, in my particular situation, stating your opinion of how the future will look in no uncertain terms. It's their choice to be riled up by ideas."
infj,3bba2u,MemoriesOfSelf,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:22:59 2015 UTC,"Adding to that and what I said myself too, I like to believe that I have such composure, which makes me not be easily fazed by what others typically may take offense from. I'm not saying that it would make certain behavior be more right or wrong, but it indeed depends on circumstances and those involved.   People do hold very strong opinions and perhaps to reverse this entirely. Take kindness and consideration, some people may even perceive this as being rude, no matter how preposterous that may sound to most sane individuals, anything can be misinterpreted so in that sense, we are all kind of crazy and there is no right or wrong. Food for thought at least, although humans often have the ability to make simple matters complex and vice versa. You can never please everyone, but some are convinced that their view is the only ""correct"" one."

Stirring things up, I do, but only when I reckon that things need to move in either direction and stagnation is way more harmful, even if I know that there will be parties hurt.

infj,3bba2u,kookacat,2,Mon Jun 29 07:46:59 2015 UTC,"This is like Cobra-Mode light.  We know exactly what buttons to push, and we can push them a little bit to stir up some controversy, or we can mash them in with a closed fist and rip a person to shreds.  I used to do this with people who mildly annoyed me--I'd play devil's advocate and throw in a curveball that fucked with their worldview.  Not enough to rip them to pieces, but enough to make them defensive and belligerent.  I'd then sit back and watch rather amusedly as they tried to come up with a logical reason why their opinion was better than mine and fail miserably (because that's the point of opinions--they're subjective, not objective, and there's no logic that says one is ever better than the other).  Are you familiar with Cobra Mode in the INFJ?  Basically, because we read people so very well, we know their insecurities and fears.  We know what they don't want exposed, we know how to push their buttons.  Normally, we don't go there, but if someone crosses our line, we do.  We watch, we wait, we bide our time, and when the moment is just right--we strike.  A few well chosen words brings down their fragile little egos.  We can scratch the surface, or we can devestate them.  It's actually quite a scary and dark side of the INFJ in certain circumstances.  As I said above, I've used it before to get under people's skin, and I've even gone full-on Cobra when people have pushed me way too far.  I try to avoid it, though."

infj,3baytt,pelneem,5,Sat Jun 27 14:05:15 2015 UTC,"Writing down your thoughts may help. When you see it on paper it may be more clear as to why you are in this slump. Just start writing how you feel and see what comes out. Also junk food is only going to make you feel worse. You may not feel like it but make a conscious decision to just go on that run or eat something  healthy. You might be surprised  at how much better you may start to feel. You also may be on a depression  but sometimes  getting on meds don't aways fix the problem . As an infj when I get into this kind of loop as you are the best thing has been to extrovert a bit,  explore something  new. Try out a new class of something  you are interested  in or next time a friend asks you out don't say no. Just fucking go, just do something.  Your introversion  just makes  you sit and spin, getting a change if scenery  has a surprising effect. Best of luck to you."

infj,3baytt,Intempestivity,4,Sat Jun 27 19:54:46 2015 UTC,"I've been through a few episodes of major depression in my life, and it definitely sounds like you're dealing with depression.  While all of the advice about forcing yourself out, making yourself exercise, eating healthier, etc, are all good coping methods and they all will help a little, they won't deal with the underlying problem that is causing the depression.  For that, I really, honestly would recommend a therapist.  You don't need to take meds (I've always refused them, even when doctors told me it would help me get through the worst of it), but you DO need to talk to a professional about these feelings and help to identify the root cause and how best to handle it.  The fact that you acknowledge that these feelings and behaviours are not normal for you is a good sign--it means you're fighting it, which is a hard enough job in and of itself.  The thing with depression (as I'm sure you know), so much of your energy goes in to fighting to stay functional that there's not a whole lot left to try to claw your way out of it.  This is why I'd recommend a doctor above all else, as they can be a vital source of support and strength when you need it most.  In the meantime, here's some things that have helped me cope in addition to professional help:   Writing and drawing, when I had the energy. Funny films.  It sounds stupid, but it helps me to escape and forget.  When my depression has been really bad, I couldn't even focus enough to read--so I would watch a funny film.  It might not make me laugh, but it helps make me feel a bit less raw when I'm in a bad place. Animals.  They are such amazing natural healers.  If you have a pet, spend time with it.  If you have the energy, volunteer at an animal shelter. Going for a walk in nature, when I had the energy to do so. Pampering myself.  A nice bath with some really posh bath bombs would make me feel a little better. For stress, try to find a healthy outlet, and utilise the outlet whenever possible.  Holding it all in will cause physical reactions in you eventually.  I ended up with shingles because I allowed myself to get so overworked and anxious for an extended period of time. I find meditation very, very helpful.  There is a brilliant app called Calm.  It plays calming background noises (I'm partial to the rain one) while doing guided meditation (""feel the tension leaving through the soles of your feet, and gently relax the muscles in your legs"", that sort of thing).  You can even set a timer so it reminds you to take some time for yourself.  This app is incredibly, incredibly useful, and I used to lock myself in my car, put my headphones on and meditate every lunch at work. A therapist taught me a great meditation technique to use when trying to get to sleep, and I've used it often since she first taught me how.  When lying on your back, curl your toes and tighten all of the muscles in your feet while breathing in slowly through your nose to a count of three.  Keep the muscles as tight as possible while holding your breath for a count of three.  Slowly relax the muscles while breathing out through your mouth to a count of three.  Repeat with your calves, then your thighs and glutes, then your back, then your abs--so on and so forth, all the way up to your scalp.  If you still feel tense, repeat again, starting with your toes and going up through your scalp.  The most I've ever had to do this before I was relaxed enough to sleep was three times.  It's incredibly effective.   I wish you all of the best of luck in overcoming this, and if you ever want to talk more, please feel free to PM me."
infj,3baytt,Intempestivity,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:06:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I will try that technique when i go to bed :) and all the rest too, i can always come and see what to do when stressed out :)"
infj,3baytt,Intempestivity,2,Sun Jun 28 21:14:30 2015 UTC,"I hope you find it useful :)  Another tip:  Give up caffiene, if you can.  Stimulants make anxiety worse. And if you can stand a bit of old-lady smell, get some lavender essential oil and put one or two drops on your pillow.  It's a bit of aromatherapy and it's very effective. For lethargy, get a an orange essential oil and put a couple of drops on your wrists or neck--any pulse point will do.  Orange and citrus wakes up the mind.  It won't make you run marathons, but it does help you feel more alert.  Also, I don't know how bad your anxiety is or if you get panic attacks, but some coping mechanisms that help me with a panic attack:   The breathing part of the sleep exercise.  In through the nose for three, hold for three, out through the mouth for three. If you can do so, sit on the ground with your knees up and your head between your knees. Repeat a mantra to yourself.  Mine usually consists of ""My name is [full name], I live in [place], and I am ok.""  Even if you just say it in your mind, it can help calm you down. Sometimes I dissociate during panic attacks.  When that happens, I put my pony tail holder on my wrist and snap it once or twice--the short, sharp pain helps ground me a little. I get a glass of ice cold water, force myself to sit down (preferably on the floor--it helps me feel more stable) and sip it slowly.  It helps ground me and keeps me from dissociating because of the intense cold of the water in my hand and mouth, and forcing myself to do something slowly and in small increments helps focus and calm my mind. Some people find talking helps.  I personally can't talk very much in the middle of a panic attack; my mind's moving too rapidly and talking ramps it up even more.  I will talk to someone after I've calmed down a little, though, to help sort through my thoughts and feelings.   Hopefully you never have to use this advice, but I thought I'd throw it out there because depression, anxiety and panic attacks do tend to arrive hand in hand."
infj,3baytt,infjtoday,2,Mon Jun 29 05:40:05 2015 UTC,"How would you describe a panic attack? I read a little bit about it yesterday and when i think back i think i had one. I felt really faint, out of breath, thirsty and like i was gonna get a heart attack and got heat wave. I luckily managed to walk home and felt fine then. I already use one mantra, where i tell myself that i can do this and everything is fine, and then take a deep breath. I think your advice will be really helpful."
infj,3baytt,edweeeen,2,Wed Jul 1 08:32:45 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a panic attack.  I personally feel really shaky and sick and like I might faint, and I tend to go either really hot or really cold.  My heart rate also rises, and I can feel a very quick heart beat in my pulse points.  I also sometimes dissociate with my panic attacks, which is worse than the attack itself in some ways--I feel like I'm looking at everything through a giant plate of glass, and I'm not really a part of anything happening around me.  A panic attack never  lasts more than a few minutes for me; dissociation can last a few hours if it's really bad."

infj,3baytt,jeff233,2,Wed Jul 1 08:22:16 2015 UTC,"I, too, have had these feelings of letahrgy, unhealthy foods, and lack of sleep.  My suggestion is to find something that makes you active and set a goal you can achieve that takes time and requires only you yourself to motivate. I play soccer, work a job I like, have the latest game systems with a sizable collection, but always felt what you describe yourself to be going through.  Then one day I decided I wanted to get stronger since I work at a hospital, the patients have gotten heavier, and I wanted to pull my weight more. (No pun intended) And I wanted to last longer in soccer since get winded after 5 minutes of running, even after playing for more than a season.  The thing with this is that I don't do this for others. I'm doing this for me. I want to get stronger, last longer. I started running last week despite feeling dreadful. People were at the track and I thought they were silently judging the fact that I was walking around the track after one lap jogging. But I had my music and blocked it out and slowly realized they were not judging me at all. I ended up doing 10 laps, more than half walking.  Then to get stronger I signed up at the gym. Had a free personal trainer session and it kicked my ass. My arms were so weak. But when I went to work they the next day, I felt a difference in my strength and ability to pull patients. But I knew it was only a few days working out and to have lasting results I need to make this a routine.  I feel much happier, I have more energy, and even naps don't give me a sluggish feeling anymore, or last a few hours.  Tl;dr: Find something that will make you want to get better. Perhaps something active to get the blood flowing, and you will notice a difference in your mood in all your other activities. I hope you find something that works for you!"

For example, exercise--I do it five times a week.  It's a part of my routine.  I take advantage of opportunities at work to learn more about coding and further my knowledge base.  Other things I'll do in spurts--I'll get through three books in one weekend, for example, then maybe the next weekend I'll go out and indulge my love for photography, etc.  I kind of do whatever takes my fancy; I don't force myself to do anything.  If I go a couple of weeks without picking up a book, that's ok--I was doing other things that interested me.  The hard part is accepting that I will never be done--I will always have another book to read, another picture to take, another creature to sculpt, another fundraiser to complete.  I try not to dwell on that and instead look at the flip side--I'll never be one of those people who just mindlessly goes through life without any passion."

That helped me put things into perspective, and I now try to remember that there's only so much a human being can reasonably do.

Though, our experiences and external environment do shape who we are and how we choose to handle those experiences.  Second of all, get over yourself. People hurt and people get hurt, that is part of life. People can be selfish, but they can rise and become selfless. The essence of the human experience is not limited to objective reality. Purpose doesn't exist by itself, you give yourself a purpose. You can argue that we're alive just to procreate but I think that's the basic primitive purpose of life. There's also a greater purpose that transcends the collective and that is your individuality.   Third, you perceive the world through Ni. Your need to understand people is partly Fe. And trying to make sense of it all is Ti.  Your problem is that you seek something that you can never achieve. And that is truth. You have to understand that everything you think and feel is a perception of the objective truth and objective truth will never exist in a way you can experience.

Concerning the other things, I'm quite  comfortable with the absurd and I agree that we create our own meaning. I also agree that an objective truth concerning anything other than a few narrow things (maths and science to an extent ) isn't possible. My issue is not really with the hurt or disappointment (I think I shouldn't have used the word 'heartbreak' in my op), I accept that all that is part of ""the human condition."" I think my issue comes in with the idea that I should chose to make ""the human condition"" generally and the idea of interpersonal relationships specifically my personal meaning. I don't think anyone can give me anything but opinion on that matter. Of course I'm human and my biological imperative (having babies) makes part of me want to just play the ""human condition game"".

Humans are just thrown into a world with nothing given to them, each of us sentenced to a limited amount of time in this universe. What to make of it? What should we spend our time doing? What happens after this?  I think that neither science nor philosophy can provide an adequate answer. Life is like having a free event ticket when you have nothing else to do; you don't know what's going to happen, but you might as well go because the alternative sucks.   In my opinion, we might as well support and love each other in our journeys while we're at it. We can share stories and experiences together, but just like we can never 100% fully understand the universe, we can also never understand each other 100%. Because that would be boring, wouldn't it? Would you read a book knowing exactly what is in it in its entirety? Would you live your life knowing everything in the future (then you will realize that free will is an illusion!)?

You don't like the unknown. When you anticipate their actions and predict following events, it bothers you that your understanding was not sufficient enough.   Realistically speaking, you can predict people. It's more difficult for INFJs to do so because our Ni is quick to judge based off other people's emotional states (Fe). Because your function is less developed, you create this idea of them based off of what you've gathered (Ni). You use your Ti to make sense of all of it. Our Ti is our tertiary function, which takes more time to hone depending on your experiences. A lot of INFJs have not developed their Se yet because it is their inferior function. We don't control it very well. It's being observant to your surroundings, noticing facial expressions rather quickly, noticing actions, even taking actions and acting on physical impulses.  You have to understand that NiFe takes small details to build a bigger picture. Those small details are not usually evidence based. To use NiFe effectively, you have to be around the person more and see more of their different emotional states. You need more small details to build a bigger more defined picture that is accurate. A well-developed Ti will look at a person's actions rather than their feelings to make a judgement. Other types, specifically Ne/Se doms don't have this problem because their conclusions are usually evidence based.  If you understand your functions more, you can try to compensate for your default mechanisms.   Philosophically speaking, you can indulge yourself with Ni ideas and theories instead of taking action (Se). Or just learn how to read people better if it bothers you that much."

This could be incredibly frustrating for a person that thinks incredibly different from myself, but if we are supposedly the same type, it's possible that Fe  kicks in and I make intense sense...  ... When I start going all ""Ni"" on shit, what I'm really doing is observing the ever changing yet ever going acting out of human drama... While you can say that I can never truly know someone, what I would say in response is that you are not wrong in the slightest, and in fact, while I can only understand people insofar as they relate to myself, even in this respect I will percieve only the product of my own blindness...  What people are is unknown to me, what people are in relation to me is unknown to me, but it is also possible that this is simply free will made manifest...  I'm trying to cut my shit short, but I find it difficult, because I'm realizing that I can't really shortcut my way to self expression, and as callous as it seems, I don't honestly believe in the ""unconditional love"" and ""integrity"" that I am literally giving my life away to express...  All I can really say is that stories of redemption, and perseverance... AND IN FACT, EVERY IDEAL MENTIONED IN THE LOG OF HUMAN HISTORY never relied on results to validate attempts, and any reading of situations and character has to be discounted against the idea that the falling of inanimate objects can't be seen as the ultimate verdict rendered against a consciousness that can kick walls, brace itself, and do anything it can to survive the fall.  Thepopular sin amongst infjs is to see the maneuvering that people do as somehow a misrepresentation of their character.... Fuck it, I lie for self preservation of my character even when my need for self preservation is straight screaming at me... I am no more real than the other fuckers in the room...  But to presume the intent of the post; I love simply because I do, and my own state and choices will bring me... Whatever...

Go out and try some different hobbies- find something that really interests you and grips you, I've picked up the guitar in recent months and have really enjoyed it. As for (2), no we can not come know someone completely but we have to give them the benefit of the doubt and trust them sometimes.

She's very cuddly and bubbly and emotional, needs a lot of affirmation... and sometimes that energy drains me, but I love her and she's one of the most loyal, reliable people that I know. She's very open and honest with me, and calls me out on my shit so I appreciate that a lot about her. Can't really discuss deep issues with her but she's a very social person, and helps me out in that regard."
infj,3b95k5,kookacat,3,Sat Jun 27 02:14:19 2015 UTC,"This is spot on. When I was an insecure little brat she would always inspire me to stop thinking about what others thought of me. She developed into a very independent person in the sense that if you bring her down, she will drop you. But she is very clingy with her boyfriend. They have to see each other 24/7 if they're not working. She cannot take criticism well at all because she feels that everything she is doing is right and justified. She's okay if someone else doesn't like her, for a second it'll bother her if someone thinks she's a ditz or too bubbly, but ultimately she wouldn't care. She never tries to control someone and has a ""you do you girl"" type of attitude.  Always loyal, seeing past my mistakes. She's a simple girl, always happy. She talks a lot and goes on and on about something and I'll listen sometimes tuning in a out of what she's saying but ultimately getting the ""jist"" of it. I dormed with her for about a year, that was a great experience. ESFJs are pleasant and their depth is more so in trying to figure people out rather than life and other novelties. Her expertise was in make-up, hair, and fashion. I felt like an idiot approaching those things but eventually I developed my own sense of style that she very much approves. Whenever she's around, I felt more comfortable in social situations because she had that quirky awkwardness yet approachable and friendly vibe.  She was simple and refreshing in my life.  During our time apart, I grew into a more confident and secure person. It's difficult because I feel like I've changed and listening to her talk about daily activities and nothing of ""substance"" isn't stimulating to me anymore. She's in a comfortable place in her life with no plans of growth. It concerns me but I know ultimately it's her life."

It doesn't mean their feelings are not affected, but they definitely don't get really really hurt by them.  I think ESFJs hate conflict, though, so when criticisms come their way, they'd rather just hear it out and save the relationship than come off angry and create a hostile situation. And they actually think on it (or talk about it to other people). They don't like criticisms, of course, because they like being relaxed and happy with everyone."

I knew her since HS and we were good friends back then, but living with her was very different and I got to see every different side of her. We never really fought, except for one time... which was actually my fault. I was grateful she called me out on my mistake and told me that I hurt her feelings. I hate passive-aggressive type of people and thankfully, she's not one of them.  I haven't hung out with her much this summer, though I'm going to be living around her in the same dorm again, and I've found that I really miss her affection and warmth. She was such a positive person and it really balanced out my negativity and pessimism :p I've also learned to be okay with being cuddly and such too hhahahahaha"

We have certain things that we butt heads over, but our love and respect for each other trumps any minor issues or disagreements we might have. We have been through a lot of shit together. We both are open and honest with each other and definitely share the same values regarding what we expect from a friend or a deep relationship. I was just telling her the other night, we both just accept each other as we are. I like that, I can be completely myself around her - the good, the bad and the ugly and we just always work it out."

She is definitely open and honest with me, but I can't be with her because she reacts rather badly. We both do accept each other as we are, at least we did.  Maybe it's my problem that I don't respect what she's doing with her life now. I feel as if we're at different stages and her approach just goes against my entire belief. I can't be completely myself around her anymore. But we always end up working things out, and I will continue to be there for her because I do value her as a friend."

infj,3b95k5,cheeziepuph,2,Sat Jun 27 00:38:04 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean. Thing is when I ""deepen"" the conversation, my ESFJ friend basically says ""why are you making things so complicated, stop, it should just be whatever makes you happy."" That is her answer to everything. ""Whatever makes you happy.""  And as an INFJ, I think we can both agree just because something makes you happy doesn't mean it's good for you. You can argue even if it's good for you if it doesn't make you happy, what's the point. I guess the point is what is the thing you value the most?  At the same time, I see happiness as a state to achieve through balancing your life. Not temporary pleasures that make you ""happy."" This is frustrating."

Well, I do but they are somewhat under the radar of my awareness (yet, the boiling is there, if you know what I mean). In your case I'd say that you two might have different emotional values in regard to the emotional issues you mention.

In fact, he may be reluctant to reveal how he actually feels about a lot of things. I am very sensitive to what other people think of me, and I am also usually quite unaware of my emotions until I write  down all of my thoughts and organize them on paper. This might sound weird, but Fe for me generally means that I focus on what other people are feeling, and sort of absorb that rather than feeling my own emotions. These are somewhere in the depths of my un/subconscious, and I have to really pay attention to figure myself out sometimes. It can be a very gradual process to really open up to people and show them my true self.  Also, as a guy, I think it's pretty common to listen to someone's problems, and then immediately try to solve them rather than taking the time to share a moment of understanding/empathy. Especially back in my earlier relationships, I would always forget that the most important thing I can do is just to really listen and try to understand. Solutions can be talked about later, after we are both ready for it. He may not understand this yet."

Their ideals can match up well due to the similar order of their functions.  They can end up jealous of each other as INFPs are good at processing their internal emotions and INFJs are good at making weird intuitive jumps and understanding their world uniquely. The one's strength is the other's weakness.  INFP uses Fi, Ne, Si, and Te and INFJ uses Ni, Fe, Ti, Se.  It is interesting how similar they test and how truly different they are; they seem more yin and yang than twins.    This INFJ lady is married to an INFP gentleman."
infj,3b88mh,cannabisanonymous,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:45:20 2015 UTC,"I am an INFJ female (33) with an INFP boyfriend (34) and we live together. I will get back to this subject but my phone battery is nearly dead and I'm at work! ;D  I think in general relationship  communication does become stronger with age - it is a skill that most people need to actively work on for sure!   Edit:  In regards to springing up the conversation, I am going to recommend a video to you! It is called A Tale of Two Brains and it talks about how men think vs. How women think.   https://youtu.be/3XjUFYxSxDk  Now, I am not trying to be sexist and say all men or women think the same but it is an amusing concept to consider. Especially The Nothing Box.  When I have had guys tell me I ""spring"" things on them it is because it appears to come out of the blue. In the woman's  mind everything is sort of interconnected like a web. A guy is doing whatever he is doing, reading or cooking or dinging around on reddit and that is what he is doing. He may not be ready to jump into a seemingly random subject - especially an intense subject.  So I try to lead in to ""heavy"" conversations. I might say ""hey boyfriend, I know you just got home from work but we need to discuss your mother's christmas party, either today or tomorrow, let me know!"" Or ""don't  forget we need to discuss our new apartment lease by Wednesday, let me know when you want to discuss!"". I would ask him how he would like to be approached about ""heavy"" topics.   Another thing about my INFP BF (and I've read this) is that it is very hard for him to open up verbally. I try to make a point to tell him I realize  how hard it was for him to get that topic out in the open and how much I appreciate his efforts.   When you have a concern and he wants to ""get in the middle"", does he seem like he wants to give advice? Is he giving you advice and maybe feeling like you aren't  taking his advice? He may need to work on backing off a little and give you time to process. INFJ likes to give advice as far as I can tell (yay reddit!) And while the answer can seem obvious to us, a lot of people just want someone to listen and empathize, not fix it for them. I ran into this a lot in previous relationships. I just wanted my ex to empathize, ""oh, that sucks. ::hug::"" but he never could do that for me. INFJ really loves to be right. Is it possible he is dismissing a subject because he felt he already gave you the ""right"" answer? I am just speculating here of course!   Now, since I don't know your man, I am going to add one thing because I ran into this issues several times when I was younger. Make sure he is respecting you. There is a fine line between not having reactions or putting off issues because of personality differences  and just straight up being indifferent to what is going on with you. Obviously the latter may warrant a breakup. Just something to keep in mind.   Lastly, for introverts especially I feel it is SUPER important to be able to request alone time and have your partner respect it. There are no games like ""I am gonna say I want to be alone but I really want you here"". No, if you want alone time you have to assert yourself and take it. If either of you need processing time you need to ask for it calmly and respectfully. Especially when there is a conflict going on, it may be best to each take a bit of time to yourselves and revisit the topic."

infj,3b98r2,demesure,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:40:52 2015 UTC,"Least favorite: Se. It causes me to binge excessively and act impulsively. Sometimes, I've a difficult time controlling my spending habits too. But it's more general impulsiveness I need to work. I spend a lot of time thinking about my actions only to let my Se take over. Favorite: Ni. I like having insight into people's lives. I like being able to read into situations and predict outcomes based on patterns and trends I see, and being right about it.  I do hate being stuck in the Ni-Ti loop. IT SUCKS ASS. A huge cause of my anxiety is being stuck in the Ni-Ti loop, which causes me to rely on my Se function.  I feel indifferent about my Fe. I wish I was less intense and maybe a little more uncaring of people and what they thought of me, but at the same time, I like being approached by people and being a go-to person for them. It puts my Ni to good use."
infj,3b8ga5,VelociraptorPatronus,3,Fri Jun 26 20:32:10 2015 UTC,"I wish I had an awesome friend/coworker like you who would crochet me a blanket, you can never have too many blankets. They are excellent for comfort and I strongly assume that most enjoy comfort.  When it comes to giving other people anything, I do believe we benefit from being cautious with expectations, as they so easily can be shattered. I'm not going to defend this coworker of yours, because I would much agree that her reaction most of all seems rather unappreciative of the work you put into it.  That said though, I know that we all react very differently to everything. Some people express a lot of enthusiasm upon receiving a gift whereas others seem more void of emotion. The thing to take notice of is that, even those that do not express ""joy"" might actually feel it but it can be very difficult for them to show it. This by all means may not be the case in your situation, but from my experience, it is a possibility.  I myself am not the type that will give you an almost unreal celebration upon receiving a gift, but my reaction also greatly depends on who is giving it and what I'm receiving. In general I much prefer to give than receive, but that's just a preference, I do love receiving even small gifts, which some may deem insignificant, however as classic and cliche as it may sound, the thought behind the gift does mean a lot. I'm sure many can have their interest bought with luxurious gifts, but I much prefer when people take the time to give something that is personal and meaningful to me.  There is no doubt that when someone puts in 1 and a half month of work, that is dedication and a sign of passion and/or love. I could hardly blame anyone for not feeling disappointed when they see their work receive almost no recognition. This naturally will mean nothing in comparison, but I'm happy you made it, I will always value and appreciate people like you that put in effort, which few others seem willing to, especially when it isn't about a family or partner.  This may also not be of use to you, but to me, I have no expectations of others, I'm sure some will find that sad or wrong a such we are all different. I believe that there is some truth and strong value in the saying that ""true love is when you give everything and expect nothing in return"". I always hope that my actions and words resonate well with other people, but at the same time I also realize that they simply may not. As such, I find myself be a lot less disappointed whenever a ""negative"" experience happen.  People that do care, and will adore what you have to offer, they will notice it and reciprocate. The people who are meant to mean a lot to us, will be in our lives and become a significant part of it. As to what qualities everyone on this planet see as important, well that is really up to each individual to decide, I most certainly have no right in telling someone how to act or think. Hopefully though people with a somewhat decent common sense will act accordingly to every given situation.  Thank you for being a thoughtful person, and don't be discouraged when the actions of others do not fall into alignment with your expectations and hopes."
infj,3b8ga5,Paragonight,2,Fri Jun 26 22:00:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you for such a thoughtful response, I love it. I didn't expect tears or elation, just more appreciation. I suppose though now I'm going to assume that reaction from others, just so I don't get my feelings hurt. This isn't the first time it's happened. I wish that people appreciated art in general more, like society used to."
infj,3b8ga5,Paragonight,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:04:44 2015 UTC,"My pleasure. While I strongly do encourage everyone to build up some kind of defense to protect their own feelings and other areas where one may be vulnerable. I also believe that one needs to be cautious with not closing off completely, as this can prevent you from some wonderful experiences. This is by all means a delicate matter and finding the right balance can take time.  Art is most certainly a very fascinating activity, it likely has a strong appeal to those who appreciate creativeness. I don't think it has gone lost or for that matter even close to, it has however expanded a lot, even into the digital age. I understand not everyone recognize digital as impressive as traditional methods, but it is however a valid way for people to express themselves with.  We all have our preferences, which is exactly as it should be, but it is easier to connect with people who display a broad range of interests. Art can often be very inspirational as well as motivate you. Take pleasure in all those people, events and objects in life that move you."

In fact, I'm sure you have and you'll get to cash in on those points one day when the universe and stars align ;) what's wrong with ""cool thanks.""  Maybe she didn't like your blanket? maybe she's got a thing against those type of blankets? maybe she really didn't know what to say.  It really doesn't matter if you poured yourself into that project or not, that's not her responsibility and you shouldn't try to push hat on her... it's cruel and controlling.   This is not and infj thing but rather a self-confidence thing.  I've been creating and showing art for 20 years now (both commercially and privately).  For every ""hey that's great"" I get a fair amount of ""ho-hums"" too.  When working commercially it's brutal and I've walked away with some hurt feelings before.    So yes, you're too attached and you're hoping she'd give you more props for taking the time to make the blanket, but it's simply her choice on how she should respond.  Now it'd be NICE if she responded that way, but you should never expect someone to come gushing with the comments."

infj,3b8ga5,kookacat,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:49:04 2015 UTC,"HEY!! Chin up, this has little to nothing to do with being an INFJ. It could happen to any type. I feel this has to do with people who appreciate home made gifts and hand crafted items and those that do not. I knit, sew, make a little jewelry and cross stitch and I am very selective making gifts for those who will appreciate it appropriately.   I have made a mistake making a few not appreciated  or under appreciated baby gifts. It is very tricky. Blankets and stuffed animals are my go-to now because babies grow out of clothes so quickly. I have observed that typically those folks that do not fall into the artsy/craftsy/creative spectrum are typically the least appreciative (not all! Some!). So it may take some intuitive observation to see if the person might appreciate such an item. Another idea would be to present them with a few options, ""hey! I would like to crochet an item for your baby, could you choose blanket/elephant/beanie hat?"". Then if they turn their nose up at the word crochet, you march right to Target and buy them a box of diapers instead and call it good!!   The only thing about my personality that relates to my hand made items is that I literally pour my heart (and a lot of thought) into the item I am making. I select the yarn or materials very carefully to meet the needs of the person receiving it. So yea, when someone isn't as excited even close to what I was....major bummer. So yea, do a bit more detective work and I think that'll  help. Don't crochet for this chick again, make yourself something nice now. :D   BTW are you on Ravelry.com? There is a group on there called ""selfish"" knitters and crocheters, they got burned and like to make more stuff for themselves now. Hehhehe.   Also, I love your username."

I'm working at a gas station and, while most of my customers are pretty cool or at least neutral, some are just complete shitfuckers. For example, I had this woman and her son come in today. The son was pretty young; no more than five or six, I'd wager. The mother was younger (twenties or early thirties), overly processed blonde hair, had huge sunglasses, and walked with a strut that just screamed of an overly inflated ego. Anyway, I noticed that the woman was filling up two of our larger soda bottles with water while her son was bouncing around beside her. And then she crossed the Moral Event Horizon by pushing her son away and yelling ""back off!"" at him.   Now, my hands on this issue are tied. My manager wasn't in so I couldn't confront this woman directly; I also couldn't review the video footage and send it to the police or social services without my manager's consent. All I could really do at that moment was charge her extra for ice. I know it was only a token effort, but charging her for ice (which raised her purchase from $1 to $1.75) was all I could really do to her without jeopardizing my job or my employer. And even then, this woman got pissed off at me because I charged her for ice.   Honestly, I just hope that kid understood what I was trying to do. I hope he realized that I was doing what I could to stand up for him, to give him assurances that I'd get my manager involved in this, and that his mother is out of control.   Hours later, I'm sitting at home wondering if what I did was the right thing to do. Should I have confronted her, even though I could loose my job and open myself and my employer up to a lawsuit? Should I have gotten my co-workers to back me up? Or is what I'm doing right? Was this just a regrettable, impulsive action perpetrated by a very frustrated mother, or was this just another event in a long line of abuse?   But yeah, dealing with people can be extremely stressful. That's why it's important to cherish the people who are actually pretty cool."

infj,3b3jl3,48valentine,2,Fri Jun 26 03:06:12 2015 UTC,I think that an Infj with a well developed Fe can have what I would call empathic response.No one can really know what someone is thinking but an Infj is probably the closest type to that.

I don't think most people have that issue, so while it seems like a huge thing for me, it's just a regular thing for a lot of people, which leads to me getting kind of sensitive   that the person hasn't appreciated how difficult it is for me to open up.  Then I realize that in the grand scheme of things, my quirks and sensitivities don't really affect anyone but me, so just try and get over myself."

I definitely agree with /u/for-realthistime regarding vulnerability; it's tough, but y'know, you learn to discern the ""good"" kind of vulnerability (e.g. the sharing of ""raw"" thoughts or emotions like you said) from the ""bad"" kind (e.g. that disheartening realization that you're being manipulated), and ultimately, I think the ""good"" kind of vulnerable truly is something that all of us as human beings need in order to connect with one another and grow as individuals.

I'm the therapist in my family, the masseuse too (so you can see how that worked out for me) and talking about my feelings doesn't come up. Only when I'm angry. I get pushed so far that I finally talk about those raw emotions, but I hurt people in their weak spots because I've pent up so much (and then, us INFJs are ridiculously perceptive, so we know pretty much everyone's weak spots). You can see how that turns out bad. I find it best to talk...ONE, to people that I really trust; TWO, in small spurts of raw feeling information (not blurting it out, but if my feelings intertwine with something they are talking about, then it's more natural and I become less anxious and worried about it for the days to come); and THREE, not at all sometimes; there are going to be things that I'll want to know about others that certain people will never want to know about me. Not everyone is as wondrously curious as we are, and that's okay. It's kind of what makes us awesome. So...I agree with the initial reddit comment up here, sometimes it's going to be awkward, and if you have the courage then that is so awesome of you! But some things are special, and scary, and odd, and so deep people may have never thought of it before so sharing those things with acquaintances might be shocking, if not, scary.

It is natural to want to organise people's emotion, but their feelings are ultimately not your responsibility. Refrain from ""fixing"" people's emotion is not a selfish thing to do, because a lot of times it is something only the person can come to terms themselves. Basically, don't participate in someone else's journey of growth without invitation, no matter how much you think you can help them.

I'm introverted to the max but I still let my friends to stay at my place till 4 in the morning just to listen to their problems.

infj,3b2g4h,Herrokitty17,4,Thu Jun 25 13:37:40 2015 UTC,I volunteer at an animal shelter. Way better than my real job dealing with people
infj,3b2g4h,UR_Face,2,Thu Jun 25 19:50:57 2015 UTC,i imagine that would be a really tough job for an INFJ.
infj,3b2g4h,Herrokitty17,7,Thu Jun 25 13:56:27 2015 UTC,"Truthfully it's extremely rewarding. I work in fundraising at the shelter so I have contact with the pets we care for but I'm not working with them directly all day. I know the compassion fatigue rate is much higher among those that do. There are it's rough days but for every sad thing I see, I see three extremely wonderful things so it makes it worth it. I also get to bring my dog to work with me everyday, and she really helps with my anxiety.   As you can imagine I work with a lot of ""animal"" people so I'm surrounded by like-minded individuals which is also nice. When I worked in a more corporate for-profit job I never really felt like I fit in. At the shelter, I do :)"
infj,3b2g4h,Paragonight,8,Thu Jun 25 14:07:50 2015 UTC,"i understand.  i think i would just find it tough to see hurt animals and ones needing to be put down and stuff.  i've always gotten more upset at hurt animals than hurt people.  probably makes me sound crazy, but i think it's down to animals not being able to communicate their feelings with us."
infj,3b2g4h,Paragonight,3,Thu Jun 25 14:12:16 2015 UTC,"We may not have the same developed way to communicate with animals as we do with other humans, but there are still many ways to read them such as their behavior.  If an animal is hurt, it's attitude to it's surroundings is often quite different from usual, and it often doesn't take much observing to notice this visual change.  I don't think there is anything remotely crazy to get upset seeing animals hurt, nor if you do more so than with humans. Our perspective on life and value is different, some would never place the life of an animal above a human, but others would, it's all a bit relative to each individual."

If you spend time with an INFJ, it feels like they know you so well, yet you're still reluctant to reveal truly deep stuff in case they're not really looking for that level."

I think HSP is more likely to occur in people who score quite highly as introverts, as introversion vs extroversion tends to be related to outside stimulus and dopamine levels.  Introverts are more sensitive to dopamine than extroverts, and thus need less of it to get the same reaction, and too much is very overwhelming.  HSPs, it's theorised, may be even more sensitive to dopamine levels and thus need even less outer stimuli than your typical introvert.  Edit:  Spelling."

infj,3b487w,Plazm,2,Fri Jun 26 02:45:15 2015 UTC,My psychologist is an infj and she's amazing! Sometimes we are off topic and exploring our Web thinking.

Other times we are very on point and make remarkable discoveries about myself and why I am the way I am. I am very thankful I have met her!!

infj,3b487w,kvismyname,2,Fri Jun 26 05:00:16 2015 UTC,"One of my very good friends is also an INFJ. She's the wife of one of my best friends and just sort of fits right in with the whole social circle of nerds that we've got going on. Some of the others' SOs, well, uh, not so much. I wouldn't say that our conversations are stilted or anything, but then again, we've known each other long enough that we're both pretty chill about a lot of things. Admittedly, I am still reluctant to discuss certain things, but that extends to most people. I generally don't go around talking about the worst lows of my depression to a lot of people.  One of my good friends from school, who I worked with on a year-long project is also an INFJ. She was the group manager, I was the group editor. So, the two of us both being our perfectionist INFJ selves lent itself well towards pushing our group to do their best. Sort of. We probably didn't push too hard, because (in keeping with the stereotype) we also strove to avoid conflict within the group. Apparently, I wasn't intimidating in that sense, but people really felt bad if they felt like they were disappointing me with their efforts. So that's something, I guess. At any rate, our group of 11 people was the only one that could claim that everyone showed up to the final major group edit before the 300-page project was due (the project also had a poster session and powerpoint presentation earlier that month, it was a huge undertaking, hence why it was a year-long course), and we got an A overall for the course (well, I know for sure that I did, anyway)."

As we grew into adulthood and got closer, we always sort of knew that we were carbon copies of each other, and we frequently express appreciation at the fact that we understand each other. We've had our struggles though, as being friends with an INFJ doesn't make you stop being one.   Also I've had feelings for her on and off over the years, and so has she, but the timing was always bad. (She's in a relationship right now, and I'm going through a break up) But that's another topic I could go on for hours!  As for the weird vibe you're getting, I sort of felt that from my friend when we were first getting to know each other. Opening up and realizing that someone may actually be a lot like you is exciting but kind of scary, and I know I was incredibly skeptical at least, when I first got to know her. She just be acting cautious because she's (certainly) not used to interacting with someone of the same personality type."

Surprisingly, I find idealists can do a lot with coding in this day and age. I don't know if you had heard of the term ""blockchain 2.0"" or ""ethereum"", since you like open-source stuff I think I should tell you about this fascinating breakthrough in tech world. Blockchain is an invention derived from Bitcoin protocol while ethereum is a platform for anyone to build open-source, decentralised software on blockchain.

I grew up in a heavily T family so I assume my Ti is pretty well developed for an INFJ (two TJ parents and a TP sibling). However one of my favorite parts of writing software is that the way I see computers makes code feel almost like art to me which I think comes from my Ni with strong Ti backing it up. The different languages to me are like the difference between forms of art to an artist. Oil paintings, watercolor, charcoal, photography, etc are all just different forms to represent the content being expressed.  It's just a matter of learning the techniques unique to each one.  That said, I work full time programming at an office job and it can really suck the enjoyment out of things when I'm forced to write and don't want to. I'm considering finding a different day job and coding as a hobby, doing freelance jobs when I can. I don't think I will ever give up programming completely though, I enjoy it too much. Since you're already going for journalism you may want to start with a web focus. Understanding the technology might be a big advantage as more and more content is moved to digital."

Introverted INtuition gives you the capacity to learn anything you put your hands on, so if you want to make a shit ton of money become a software engineer. However, INFJ's are also extraverted feeling so I find a dilemma that I need to be helping the world and studying people or psychology rather than objective systems. INTJ's, strictly based on type, are more likely to enjoy computer systems because of their objective thinking preference. So if you study computer science you might feel that you aren't working truly as you were made, and that you have to sacrifice part of yourself to do work in computer science. If you wish to blend the two, I would say focusing on User Experience so that you can deal with the human-computer relationship.  I hope this helps!"

infj,3b3fjz,bezald,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:58:10 2015 UTC,"People are hiring developers with barely any experience and/or no college degree because developers (especially mobile/web/database) are in such high demand by every company trying to stay relevant in the modern business and social environment.  That said, there may be an element of bubble involved because, to some extent, the field seeks to make itself obsolete -- but only right after it makes a whole lot of other fields obsolete.  :/  Also, shit ton is relative.  You will make a lot more than many other fields after a few years, but you will likely start quite low.  The people really making a shit ton of money are the ones who slave away at that lucky start-up and/or climb into senior management."
infj,3b3fjz,Deeseamon,2,Thu Jul 2 05:30:06 2015 UTC,"Just take an intro course and see if you like it. I know an INFJ in the field, so the personality is compatible, but there's no way of knowing if you personally like it until you try."
infj,3b3fjz,prowler33,2,Thu Jun 25 18:18:05 2015 UTC,"Fair point, thank you."
infj,3b14ge,nyctanthous,15,Thu Jun 25 03:09:46 2015 UTC,"Hmm, perhaps you could try investing in the cognitive functions of the INFJ—particularly Fe, which is where this ""codependence"" primarily, if not solely, stems from. People with a strong and healthy Fe function will typically be accommodating, polite, and aware of social cues and the emotions of others, sometimes sacrificing some of their authenticity in order to maintain harmony, but despite this, they still have a sense of their own identity and are also aware of their limits.  Additionally, the fact that you are ""lost and despondent...[,] irritable, vitriolic, [etc.]"" at times suggests that you may be close to entering a Ni-Ti loop, or in other words, fairly close to shutting off/pushing aside your Fe function in order to dwell in the more cold, objective realm of Ti. While this may ""help"" you in one way or another, in the end, you may end up further isolating and embittering yourself.  So, what should you do? Look further into your personal MBTI type (it'll at least partially help you), and more importantly, take care of yourself. Of course, the latter is much easier said than done, but 1.) you DON'T deserve to feel so world-weary and drained out, 2.) you definitely DO deserve to cut yourself some slack and give yourself a break from the people who have been causing you such grief, and 3.) YOU ARE WORTH IT; you are so, so, so, so much more valuable than you may give yourself credit for, and you deserve to be happy and taken care of.   Seriously, even if it might not seem like it sometimes, you really do matter.   Anyways, I apologize that you've been feeling the way you do and that life isn't looking up, but you are capable of overcoming these troubles. You are strong, you are important, and again, you matter."

A book I found helpful is Codependent No More by Melanie Beattie, and also just taking baby steps, you don't have to fix all the relationships in your life in one go, just take it one at a time and one interaction at a time. If you need a listening ear feel free to PM me. Best of luck!"
infj,3b14ge,RegisteredTM,2,Thu Jun 25 08:06:53 2015 UTC,"Awesome. Thanks for this input. I read a Melody Beattie book, I honestly can't remember if it was codependent no more or another one, but I swallowed it up in about a day and it was really helpful. After that I sought out a CoDA group. I went to one meeting and it was super therapeutic. I had an awesome time, I cried in the best way, and promised I'd go back, but haven't been able to bring myself to do it. I think I was socially overwhelmed honestly. They were all really supportive and great, but I felt a social pressure at the same time. I felt that wasn't the most healthy prompt to go back.  Also important for me to internalize that I am working on it and accept myself where I am at each moment. Thanks for the feedback and invitation."
infj,3b14ge,jeff233,3,Thu Jun 25 12:30:38 2015 UTC,"I've had the pleasure of getting to know a number of fellow INFJs and there is no question that people pleasing is something we all struggle with to some degree. It is difficult because we are so naturally aware of how everyone around us feels and it can seem like the easiest thing to do is use that awareness to keep everyone happy and maintain harmony. Next thing we know we've lost ourselves completely to the relationship. I've made a concerted effort to notice when I'm molding myself to others' preferences and placing their needs above my own, but it's a slippery slope and I think it's something that requires vigilance and regular adjustment to maintain a balance. One thing that helps me when I'm feeling guilty about saying no or enforcing boundaries is to ask myself what I would think if the roles were reversed. Would I be upset with my best friend if she didn't text me back right away? Probably not, and most reasonable people wouldn't. (If someone can't be reasonable about such things, is this someone you really want in your life?) Most of the time I realize that I'm placing these expectations on myself, and that I don't have to be superwoman. And finally, it helps to remember that I am not a bottomless pit of energy and empathy. If I don't look after my own needs I will be drained and will have nothing left to offer those I love."
infj,3b14ge,americanpharoah,3,Thu Jun 25 14:05:56 2015 UTC,"I am constantly doing things that I don't want to do in order to please other people.   That's a altruistic characteristic with INFJ's. I think it's something you'll just have to get used too in a sense. I will literally clean up the living room in the mornings after my roommates and I made a mess of it last night and I will sometimes say to myself ""how the fuck can you be so messy? Why can't you just clean up while you make the mess"", ect. You just have to learn when to say no, and to always consider the favor/thing being asked of you first before saying yes or no.    It is confusing and makes me feel lost and despondent for days out of the week, and to boot it makes me irritable, vitriolic, defensive, and resentful to people who don't really deserve it at all.   Same here. Try and look at it this way:  Your Happiness is a bank, and when someone asks you for a favor or to do something, they make a withdraw from your Happiness Bank in doing so. All friends that have accounts open with your Happiness Bank are given a credit line, some higher than others depending on how close you are too them.  When you get a friend that is constantly withdrawing from your Happiness Bank and not depositing anything back, these sort of side-effects may incur from it. If this does happen you need to put a hold on your friends account until they clear up the debt with you.   Do you get what I'm saying?    I also had the observation that although the INFJ personality is 1-2% of the population, it has the largest and most active subreddit community of any of the personality types by far.   I think part of the reason for this is because INFJ's seek to be understood and in doing so come to the internet because it is a place where we can find that understanding.     All in all we all have our strengths and weaknesses within our own INFJ personalities that we have to bear/overcome. I know I've been falling towards the edge of being more cold about the world which I'm doing my best to change and get back within equilibrium so that I do feel for my fellow humans more. I feel like a lot of life is like a uphill battle but with INFJ's it's a uphill battle with smaller hills upon the main hill.   I also liked /u/nyctanthous response on the issues that you're facing.  I hope their words of encouragement helped you!"

Without deadlines or some sort of imposed structure, I'll simply do the least amount possible. There's so much stuff to catch my attention and procrastinate on that I need a routine or a schedule to actually accomplish anything. I've been convinced since I was a kid that if I kept to the ""perfect"" routine that I could basically become a super-hero in terms of skills and accomplishments.

I'm still in the bad habit of giving false hope when an acquaintance invites me somewhere I don't want to be. I please them in the moment, and reassure them of how exciting it sounds and how I really would like to go. But ultimately I know in my head whether or not I'll be there.  With my main group of friends (who I've known for 10 years), I've been better at only committing when I know I can. Otherwise I'll be up front if it's something I don't want to do. They'll still attempt to persuade me... and I'll admit occasionally it works... but they're good about giving me my space if I firm on it.  Luckily they are understanding. It makes those situations a lot easier."

My google Keep is filled with notes like that. It's good to know I'm not the only weirdo lol  To answer your question, yes I think it's very much Ni at work. I tend to make music videos spontaneously in my head while listening to music. Sometimes it's dancing choreography, but more often it's like what you described: sort of a story line. Ni, in my opinion (in this specific case), takes in what you're giving it and instantaneously outputs the pinpoints of connectivity it has regarding the song through your lens. It's like the marriage of dreams and imagination. One being in control and the other not lending any control. This is why the images flow so easily and have so much feeling and meaning behind them.  I used to take long walks in the middle of the night (like 3am) because I liked being outside alone.

Blocking the outside world can be a tremendous help with that, but I don't think is absolutely essential. For example, I'm at peace when I'm driving or at the gym. It's two moments when I'm on autopilot and there's a rare chance for someone to truly bother me. No interactions, maybe just passerbys.  I listen to music that has meaning. In actuality, I was the one who gave it that meaning. Whether I looked up the lyrics and related to it. Whether the soft tones calm me down, or whether I had a deep connection with someone who enjoyed that song. I give it that special meaning.  Nothing is better than being in solitude with music. I sometimes forget about it now that I'm older and busy. But when I bring meaningful music back into my life within a comfortable setting. I'm at peace.  It's something that I'll always have."

I love listening to music while walking too. My music influences what comes to mind depending on the rhythm and melody of the song. I imagine scenarios to fit the particular mood of the song I'm listening to; for example, I might associate more upbeat songs with fight scenes or hurried travel, and more wistful songs with fictional characters' moments of quiet reflection. I'd never thought of it as being INFJ specific and just attributed it to my daydreaming tendencies, but you're probably right.

infj,3axr7q,Roamin-Rambler,5,Thu Jun 25 10:29:12 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, yes. My mom grew up in a pretty stoic household so she doesn't always say ""please"" and ""thank you"". She doesn't stop to consider other people's feelings, but she expects others to always consider hers. Everything I know about thinking of the other person, I get from my Dad.  I've always had a great relationship with both my folks, but as I get older, she seems to understand me less and less."
infj,3axr7q,lenniek11,4,Wed Jun 24 15:10:44 2015 UTC,"Yea, my parents really don't even know me. They will say things to my SO sometimes like, ""I never knew he liked x"" when x has been an interest of mine for years.   I specifically remember telling my mom she didn't know who I was when I was around 13 or 14 and she laughed and said I was being dramatic, so I just pretty much kept to myself after that."
infj,3axr7q,KStreetFighter2,4,Wed Jun 24 15:25:02 2015 UTC,"For sure. I think my Mom thought I was an extrovert because I was quite animated in one on one situations, so she was always pushing me to do social stuff, I think she presumed that me being alone meant I was depressed when I was actually happy like that. They also didn't understand that I could only be happy doing things that were meaningful to me, they would encourage me to work hard in everything, which left me flat because it all felt so pointless."
infj,3axr7q,americanpharoah,3,Wed Jun 24 18:26:36 2015 UTC,"parents and brother are all E/Istjs... I was certainly the oddball growing up.  I'm really reluctant to pull the INFJ card out and play it, but yeah... I think we are misunderstood because we live in our own worlds much more so than other children growing up.  I'm 42 and my parents still don't understand me :)"
infj,3axr7q,justanontherpeep,3,Wed Jun 24 15:01:59 2015 UTC,My parents have always struggled understanding why I'm sensitive. My mom is an ESTJ and my dad is an ISTJ with a pretty mean sense of humor. I'm immune to anything he says now but I really struggled with it growing up. I think the best thing that happened was my parents getting divorced. My mom married an INFP when I was young and he's been such a big positive influence in my life. It was nice to have someone I could relate with better. Fortunately my mom and I have the same interests so overall we got along pretty well.
infj,3axr7q,murk-lurk,3,Wed Jun 24 20:25:57 2015 UTC,"I think my dad and I understand each other and are very alike (I'm a female, btw). I think he might be an INFJ, too. But it wasn't always that way. I don't think he understood me when I was younger, but he was going through a lot of shit.  My mom is a person who sees you as she wants to see you. She doesn't understand you, she just tries to tell you who you are. So, I don't feel understood by her, but I don't have any issues with this much, anymore. She is who she is."
infj,3axr7q,JupiterK,3,Wed Jun 24 21:26:16 2015 UTC,"While my parents are great people, I can't say either of them knows me. We can get along to a certain extent but there's never any meaningful interaction. My mother, who I suspect is isfj, is very caring but she has immense difficulty acknowledging or accepting other points of view.. so not much understanding there. My father(possibly some sort of inxx) is more or a less the stranger I grew up around. He never put much effort in trying to get to know me. We never really interact.. it's more like we just exist in the same space. I can tell he's the more open minded one but we've still yet to reach a point where we actually talk."
infj,3axr7q,CloudhuntOoo,2,Thu Jun 25 03:59:59 2015 UTC,"Sounds like my home. My mother is definitely ISFJ and while she is caring and always has been, she is also unable to relate to me often, nor able to talk about abstract concepts much.  My father is.. just there. Never really had a problem with him or anything and he does a lot of stuff physically for me and my mother, but he is pretty much a stranger to me, although I am very skilled at reading people. He almost never shares his thoughts, but is only a bit more open when he is drunk. I suspect him to be an ISTJ, but I could be wrong. Definitely introvert though."
infj,3axr7q,Glassland,2,Fri Jun 26 21:11:40 2015 UTC,"My dad is INTJ and my mom is ESFP.  My dad and I get along pretty famously.  We had some pretty long discussions on both theoretical ideas and subjects we're passionate about.  We both know how hard it can be to make ourselves heard and clearly understood to other people as well, and our similar temperments result in a pretty good understanding of one another.  My mom and I often struggle to see eye to eye.  She is not at all a fan of theoretical discussion, preferring to talk about events that have actually happened and things she can relate to in the physical world, and she is always in the moment.  She often tells me that I think way too much and need to focus more.  We both are strong feelers, and we can hurt each other's feelings quite easily due to a lack of understanding between our two very different world views.  Similarly, my brother is an INFP and my sister is an ESFP.  Growing up, my brother and I understood one another a lot more than my sister and I did.  My sister could not understand why my brother and I would rather read a book than go out to a party, and we didn't understand why anyone would rather go out and party than chill at home.  We are all grown up now and understand each other a lot more, but yeah, ESxx personality types and INxx personality types really do struggle to understand one another's viewpoints."
infj,3axr7q,Intempestivity,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:07:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah my dad is an Entj and my mum Esfj.Me and mum get on pretty well, although she does love her trivial chats.I never really could get on with him and Mbti does at least partially explain why."
infj,3axr7q,Thunder_54,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:47:45 2015 UTC,I can relate. I have a similar dynamic with my mom who is an ISFP.
infj,3axr7q,zeroffn,2,Wed Jun 24 21:30:41 2015 UTC,It isn't just you guys... >_<   It gets better when you move out
infj,3axr7q,zman4000,2,Wed Jun 24 16:31:14 2015 UTC,"Yep! Growing up , sometimes my mom would say things to me like ""You're acting like a girl!"" if I would show ANY emotion. This was really detrimental to me in the sense that I tried to be someone who didn't show any emotion in front of her after a while. My experience though has really made me think a lot about the social constructs surrounding gender that we have created and how destructive they can be."
infj,3axr7q,CecileHugo21,2,Wed Jun 24 18:55:20 2015 UTC,"That's a good thing though, that you know her and yourself. It could be a phase or just a daughter thing. My mom's an ESTP so our thought processes are quite different, which, yeah, does make me feel special to a certain degree, but it also feels really sad because there are so many things she doesn't quite comprehend. But with you and your daughter, she has you as a sort of comfort net. You can understand her even when she doesn't want to be understood. She's very lucky...even if she doesn't know it ^"
infj,3axr7q,CecileHugo21,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:14:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean, it depends on the mother/father-daughter/son relationship, right? Example: When I was 16-17 I wasn't very close with my mom. We didn't share very much, but I'm 21 now and we talk a lot. There are some things we will never agree on, even now that I'm older and her flaws have become more visible, BUT because of her I'm wise enough to know that all those little things she did/ does are to point me in the right direction and from her own experiences.Much like what you do for your daughter. Most moms sacrifice so much for their kids so...know that if she doesn't see it now, just keep at it, at those little things, and hopefully as she'll grow to be as loving as her mom :D (ps. It's so nice to see that you put your love for your daughter above the arrogance of telling her that you know her ""oh-so"" well. Not everyone is like that >.<)"
infj,3axr7q,mashmysmash,2,Sat Jun 27 05:02:12 2015 UTC,"No, not really. My mum (ENFJ maybe) and I get on great, the only time we clash is when I don't comply with her ""OCD."" She guilts me into doing things, and often tries too hard to get me to express what I'm feeling, when only 50% of the time is there a problem to express. We have exactly the same humour, laughing at what seem to be random things. My dad is an INTP, we have long discussions sometimes and I get on great with him too."
infj,3axr7q,hintofsass,2,Sat Jun 27 14:46:34 2015 UTC,Yes. Or rejected
infj,3axr7q,Nazmazh,2,Sat Jun 27 17:43:35 2015 UTC,"My dad definitely doesn't comprehend the introvert need to recharge thing. He's an engineer, so very mechanical in his thinking. I just tried to answer a personality test as I thought he might answer, and the result was an ESTJ (like my brother, which would explain why the two of them get along so well). My brother definitely fits the ESTJ profile better, but that's probably because he is much more extroverted than my dad.  My mom is a bit more understanding, though, not entirely, I guess. She might be an ESFJ. I'm not really sure about the typing on either of my parents to be honest.  I honestly can say I love my family dearly, but there's something to not living with them anymore. Once I moved out and was less bound by their schedule and rules (nothing oppressive by any means), I felt much more relaxed. I prefer to do things as I get bursts of energy and inspiration far more than their ""do things now because now is when they should be done"" attitudes. Nevertheless, I do greatly appreciate the organizational skills I picked up from them."
infj,3axr7q,CecileHugo21,2,Thu Jun 25 16:26:32 2015 UTC,"My situation is kind of weird. My mom is an ESTP, the complete opposite of me and my dad is supposedly an INFJ. I am an INFJ. Except, I get along with my mom more than my dad because, well my mom raised me, not my dad. Throughout my life, I always felt like my mom didn't get me when I tried to explain things. I would tell her, ""But I didn't know. I had two options so I picked the one I thought you wanted, what I thought you wanted me to do."" And I was more often wrong, than right with her. She didn't get that I had so many scenarios, so many thoughts and options in my head. She was/is too stubborn, but I love her for who she is, even though we think quite differently. Now, my dad is, in most cases, a horrible person. He is selfish and critical and knows everyone's flaws, and sets himself above the rest. He is, what I'd call, the shadow of an INFJ. Perhaps, that's why I am not him. But sometimes, as I've gotten older, I realize how my dad thinks. He always makes the wrong mistake, but his thought process, his confusions with endless possibility and not knowing himself makes sense to me. So I sort of pity him. I love him too, in my own way. And so to end this ""gentle rant"", I'll answer you by saying, ""Yes"". Misunderstood? Absolutely, even by another INFJ. Both parents? Well, that depends on how you look at the situation. All you can do is learn from your parents. Whatever MBTI they are, take the good, and remember their mistakes so you don't practice them. Hope this helps in...some way :)"
infj,3axr7q,shinbum,2,Fri Jun 26 02:03:41 2015 UTC,"As a 23-year-old male INFJ, I've grown physically, emotionally, and perhaps spiritually independent from my parents. But, ever since consciousness, I don't think my parents ever truly understood me (or I hope that they do they just don't say it). I am full of tears, I sit at a coffee shop all day writing on my journal or reading, I don't attend parties, and I have 3 brother-like friends who are closer than my real brother.  We all ""get along,"" but people including my parents tell me that I'm super INFJ. I don't expect ANYONE to understand my inner world. The attention and care are appreciated, but that's as far as that goes."

infj,3azvag,alexisdr,8,Wed Jun 24 21:00:56 2015 UTC,"Being an INFJ involves more than fitting the ""description"" of an INFJ on websites and stuff. It has more to do with the functions than a description or the letters.  I suggest you do some research on the functions and see which fits you best. For INFJs, our functions are stacked as: Dom - Introverted Intuition (Ni) Aux - Extraverted Feeling (Fe) Sec - Introverted Thinking (Ti) Inf - Extraverted Sensing (Se)"

I am good at gathering information and making a case on someone's  behalf, especially observing their needs and emapthizing with them to help realize their goals and dreams. I can be very tenacious, like you said, with meetings and emails. I definitely feel my strength is in writing persuasively, but if I am passionate and knowledgeable  about a topic I can go toe to toe with whomever in person to get the job done as well.

infj,3aye4x,keepcali16,4,Wed Jun 24 14:27:12 2015 UTC,"To be honest, MBTI isn't really made for type compatibility, more about recognizing how you (and others) process the world. To understand why you might get along with one, look at the functions. ENFPs are pretty much our ""shadows"", meaning we both have N-F-T-S as our function order, but where we'll extrovert, they will introvert and vice versa.   In practice that can mean we both have similar interests and a similar orientation to the world, but just skewed from how we'd naturally approach it. It's like coming at the same thing from two opposite sides. We might even agree most of the time, but have very different reasons for doing so and methods for putting that reasoning into action.   In my experience, ENFPs can be delightful, and when we put our heads together we can approach an issue completely from all sides. However, because our functions run in the same order, when we run into problems, it's sometimes more useful to have someone with a different stack type, like a T or S, to balance you out instead.  It's possible to go into a tailspin with ENFPs where neither of us can pull us out of the descent until crashing.   Haha, if you initiate even just a little with an ENFP, if they reiprocate they can pick you up and carry you away with their enthusiasm and interest, so don't worry about it."
infj,3aye4x,lzimmy,2,Wed Jun 24 14:56:59 2015 UTC,"That's beautifully articulated and accurate. From my experience, I completely agree with how we bounce off of one another, but can also crash if not careful. As with any relationship, I suppose it is a fine balancing act. Appreciate you talking the time to respond!"
infj,3aye4x,bezald,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:22:36 2015 UTC,"yes and no, imo. there's a reason INFJs mostly end up with INTPs, INTJs, ENTPs and (sopmetimes, but more for friends) ENFPs and it's very evident from the function stacks. so yes, there's a lot of gray area when you use MBTI to consider compatibility, but i wouldn't say there's zero connection or should be zero connection.  there's a reason why the INTJ and ENFP boards are obsessed with eachother + why seemingly most of each type is with the other one.  i DO definitely think that certain MBTI types tend to have a more natural connection overall, but real life of course creates many other variables and and relationship can technically work if things align and both people put in the effort."
infj,3aye4x,lzimmy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:09:20 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you. I think knowing  how someone thinks and processes information is a useful tool for determining compatibility, but the way most people use it on these forums is equivalent to saying ""All Earth signs get along, also Capricorn and Cancer are an ideal match. Where can I find a Cancer?"".  Knowing someone shares the same judging functions as you do or is introverted can help determine if you're going to have a higher probability of mental compatibility or how you like to spend you leisure time, etc. but it's not guaranteed.  Individuality plays a huge part in this; there are even INFJs in this forum that would probably not get along with me in person because we share different principles. MBTI in terms of relationships isn't useless, but the info only takes you so far.   I definitely think certain connections are more popular than others, and not sharing any functions or similarities with another type will probably result in a lack of compatibility and understanding. But love is a strange force, and it's hard to account for its influence, let alone individuality. Any tool that can help you understand someone  better is useful, but even useful tools can be used incorrectly with poor results."
infj,3aye4x,bezald,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:43:44 2015 UTC,"But astrology has literally nothing to do with how people process the world. I get what you're saying, but it's on a different level where various trends are clearly observed.  Like, to me it says a lot that I've been involved in various MBTI communities for years and have yet to see a single successful INFP-ESTP pairing, you know?  i wouldn't tell all INFPs to avoid ESTPs but i wouldn't disregard this either."
infj,3aye4x,lzimmy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:45:31 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely not saying MBTI is equivalent to astrology, but some people seem to use it that way, as if the types were signs and that there's no psychology or reasoning behind it. They'll talk as if they somehow find someone in the proper type it's ""destined"" to work out.   There are definitely types where I'll read through their functions and how they manifest in possible behaviors and thinking and it's either a huge turn off or will make me nod in agreement. I'll also find out the types of my best friends and it's no surprise they land in a distinct cluster of the same personality types. Certain relationships are more common, but never assured.   I just get the feeling when other types come in here saying, ""I want an INFJ"" they're looking for a very objectified idea of someone and not the real person they're going to encounter. I guess I'm just saying it's fine for broad strokes, but it doesn't account for nuance."
infj,3aye4x,hintofsass,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:01:48 2015 UTC,"Can, stressing can, be bootiful. Also leaves room to crash and burn. Takes maturity and understanding/acceptance of differences from both involved parties.   On the bright side, when it is going well - it's fan-FUCKING-tastical! :DDD And no one person or situation can break up this magical pairing.   I think it also depends on how confident said infj is with themselves and their traits and how much they and their enfp like/accept their own special brand of derp (met an enfp that rejected her derp throughout bouts of dep) because they tend to bring that out in us tenfold :)"
infj,3aye4x,SeanRK1994,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:03:14 2015 UTC,"INFP here, but I sort of float between these three types, and ENFJ on occasion. I would expect that the common NF traits give these types a similar way of thinking and seeing the world, while the complementary traits serve to balance what can be extreme qualities, such as isolation, cynicism, indecisiveness or a need for approval. The ENFP brings an INFJ out of their shell and shows them ways to be more open to other people, giving them the benefit of the doubt at least, and the INFJ can give the ENFP encouragement in making and committing to decisions, as well as being more independent in other ways. Just a guess though"

infj,3axf1h,moonlightsidhe,5,Wed Jun 24 17:50:06 2015 UTC,"That is exactly how I react to emergencies as well. I got caught in a major subway shutdown complete with a walk on the tracks in darkness with elderly people and a dwindling air supply, and then capped off with a stampede when people started panicking. I remember marveling how so many people's brains just seemed to shut off, or how the policeman who lifted me off the tracks just grabbed me and shoved me out of the way like I was one of the hysterical ones, even though I had been supporting an older lady who was having trouble not getting crushed by the traffic flow.   Before I learned about being an INFJ I used to berate myself about getting all bent out of shape if something didn't turn out just right or some other little thing while being able to be calm and efficient in a major emergency, and it's nice to know that other people are the same way :)"

(Well ... some people still ask that).  I used to agree with them and think there must be something defective in me because of those two vastly different reactions ... nope, it's just how I'm wired :)"
infj,3axf1h,lzimmy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:41:26 2015 UTC,Also same. I go into autopilot. Also helps I'm fully cert. in cpr and first aid and renew every year.
infj,3axf1h,lzimmy,3,Fri Jun 26 02:06:47 2015 UTC,"Over my lifetime, I've encountered only a few emergency situations, and for the most part I do very good job keeping my wits about me and handling things to the best of my ability. I'll know what resources are needed to help, and have what seems to be a reliable ability to triage people and situations so I can focus on the most important task at hand and delegate the others.   However just recently I witnessed an incredibly disturbing, difficult, and heartbreaking tragedy which unfortunately involved people I care about very much. I've never felt so completely helpless in my entire life. I did what I could to assist, but for the most part it was entirely out of my hands and there was nothing to do but watch and keep out of the way. For a person who likes to help, being stuck in the observer's position was anguish, in more ways than one.    When I couldn't do anything, I kept thinking, ""Why am I here? Why am I seeing this?"" over and over again. In the end it was a good thing, because when the police report had to be made there was someone who had a complete timeline of events, knew there was no negligence involved, and could vouch for all parties involved. And more importantly, some day I'll be able to tell my friends it wasn't their fault and they did everything humanly possible to stop that bad situation when they're finally ready to hear it. For me, the stress of not acting in an emergency far exceeds the stress of being the one who's actively helping.     And once the danger is gone, once life is back to normal, I spend hours in a weird suspended state (currently in that), analysing and evaluating and processing what has just happened. While that's happening in my head, the rest of me is on autopilot--I drive without thinking about it (I guess Se is still in effect here), I crack on with whatever needs to be done, be it work, housework, whatever. I'm unable to focus my Ni on anything else other than processing the event (yes, I do realise that writing all of this out is part of my processing this particular event--forever analysing myself while analysing my environment). While this is going on, I may feel sick and a bit tired.   This describes me very accurately post-emergency.  I'm not sure if it's Ni, or if I've gotten sooooooo stressed out that I've actually started using the rarely-accessed Ne. I get locked in my head and it seems all I can do is run scenarios, looking at each possibility for each of my actions and analyze where I could have gone wrong and what could have happened instead.  Instead of Ni's clean ""do this, now do this, and this will happen"" future-oriented predictions, I feel like I'm being flooded with all the eventualities that could have possibly happened from any combination of events during the past crisis, and I obsess over whether what I ended up doing was in fact the ""right"" thing. It's like the blinders Ni uses to protect us and give us that useful tunnel vision are suddenly removed and I'm drowning in a sea of alternate paths, and it's almost mentally paralyzing.  Usually once I can confirm that my initial Ni plan was in fact the best course of action I could have taken, I'm free of it.  It also helps if I can compare my experience against someone else who was there and make sure my choices were logically valid.  But yeah, depending on the severity of the event usually I'll desperately need an emotional purge.  If it's no big deal I can end up shaking it off, but usually I'll burst into tears later when I have space and privacy.  In regard to the event I just wrote about, as the witness, I had to recount the story to everyone else who was related to them, living it over and over again as I had to deliver crushing news to people I care about, and then go through their emotional trauma with them. I've never been so emotionally exhausted in my life. Considering I was just on the sidelines, it's difficult for me to entirely comprehend what my friends who were actively involved were/are going through.    Anyway, I have a lot of respect for the people who choose to be the first-responders and helpers of society. Level-headed, practical action in the face of disaster is such a mental/emotional balm for me and it allows for others to get on the same page and focus up.  I only take on that role when necessary, I don't think I'm mentally equipped to severely doubt myself on a daily basis after getting the job done."

I'm not sure if it's Ni, or if I've gotten sooooooo stressed out that I've actually started using the rarely-accessed Ne. I get locked in my head and it seems all I can do is run scenarios, looking at each possibility for each of my actions and analyze where I could have gone wrong and what could have happened instead. Instead of Ni's clean ""do this, now do this, and this will happen"" future-oriented predictions, I feel like I'm being flooded with all the eventualities that could have possibly happened from any combination of events during the past crisis, and I obsess over whether what I ended up doing was in fact the ""right"" thing. It's like the blinders Ni uses to protect us and give us that useful tunnel vision are suddenly removed and I'm drowning in a sea of alternate paths, and it's almost mentally paralyzing. Usually once I can confirm that my initial Ni plan was in fact the best course of action I could have taken, I'm free of it. It also helps if I can compare my experience against someone else who was there and make sure my choices were logically valid.   YES.  This very accurately describes the aftermath in my head!  For several hours I questioned if I did the right thing by leaving, even though the dispatcher said it was ok and the driver was completely fine.  My husband and my boss both said that I'd done everything I could have possibly done, and as I'd come across the accident and hadn't witnessed it, there was nothing more to be gained by staying, and only after having multiple people confirm that it was the right course of action did I settle.   Anyway, I have a lot of respect for the people who choose to be the first-responders and helpers of society. Level-headed, practical action in the face of disaster is such a mental/emotional balm for me and it allows for others to get on the same page and focus up. I only take on that role when necessary, I don't think I'm mentally equipped to severely doubt myself on a daily basis after getting the job done.   I was thinking this exact thought earlier today.  I couldn't cope with this sort of thing on a daily basis, and I have serious respect for anyone who does, whether it's their profession or if they have agreed to be first aiders/first responders."

Thank you, that's very kind of you to say that. It was horrible, but it really wasn't about me and although I've come to terms with it to a degree, I still feel incredibly bad for the people immediately involved.   YES. This very accurately describes the aftermath in my head!   Haha I'm glad I'm not the only one, not that I'd wish that on anyone. Is this what Ne users go through all the time?

infj,3axf1h,erosenoir,2,Wed Jun 24 22:52:00 2015 UTC,"Yes. This is normal to feel detatched and cry afterwards as you can have an adrenaline rush followed by an adrenaline dump. I think it is a lot going on with brain chemicals at that time.   I respond really well in emergencies, start yelling orders at people (someone has to) and get super decisive and bossy. I have been trained a bit in first aid and such so I'm  a bit more help than some folks but not as helpful as like a nurse or doctor. The worst thing is when people stand  around gawking so if I can do nothing else I shoo them away."
infj,3axf1h,erosenoir,2,Wed Jun 24 11:01:34 2015 UTC,"The worst thing is when people stand around gawking so if I can do nothing else I shoo them away.    There were two old men stood on the side of the road gawping today.  I just ignored them because they were out of the way, but it really annoyed me that they were even there.  It's like, if you're not going to help, just leave.  I'd never heard of an adrenaline dump before, but it makes sense--a sudden burst of adrenaline is going to have a pretty intense chemical effect on the body.  I've been googling it, and the nausea and exhaustion definitely factor in to my post-emergency reactions.  It'll be interesting to read more about it and see if the post-adrenaline stage can impact how we gather and process information."
infj,3axf1h,JupiterK,6,Wed Jun 24 12:32:59 2015 UTC,"Yea, I had a huge adrenaline dump once, I had a student that was coming at me and another student and punching walls and screaming. I yelled to another student to go get help, tried to clear passerby and just burst into tears after the liaison officer took him.   Gawkers can also be dangerous. I was near an accident in a parade (kid was sitting on a trailer wheel well and fell off, got run over...he's  fine but it was pretty sobering at the time). People were standing around, police were trying to get through so I started moving people and saying ""if you are not helping you need to step aside!"". One guy was trying to record it on his phone, so I snapped at him. I get absolutely livid when people try to record scenes like that - it is none of their business. Someone is suffering and having one of the worst, most vulnerable moments of their life, why the fuck would you tape that? Its sick."

As long as they respect each other's needs for physical activity or quiet time, it's a nice pairing.

I can't agree mainly because of this:    It is very important for ENFJs to feel noticed, appreciated, cherished and loved—often, as in all the time. This isn’t inspired by insecurity, but rather by their idealistic notions about what love should be. They won’t ask for these things, however; they expect their significant others to offer them automatically without any prompting.   I could care less the personality type, because type doesn't dictate how a person acts, but the person I am with has to tell me what they want. Or at least this has to be an open conversation. The way I show appreciate may be different from the way another person notices if they are appreciated. For example I'm not the type of person to say ""I love you"" and some people expect that. This is one of those things that has to be a compromise.   These quizzes are interesting but not much to expect from them."

Feeling aimless is extremely common, especially as a student. I think we spend so much time and energy focusing and worrying about the future that we neglect to cultivate a sense of self in the present - without realising that it is the experiences that we have in the present that determine who we are/what we do in the future.  Therefore, first and foremost, it's important that you look after yourself in the present: get regular exercise, sleep and eat healthy, continue with counselling, spend time outside/in nature, take yourself out on cute dates to places you've always wanted to go to, read self-development/self-help books, and practise mindfulness. I know how difficult it can be to find the motivation to do these things, but it's vital towards the road of recovery and it'll be worth it in the long run.  I've gained a lot of comfort in realising that, contrary to socio-cultural ideologies and pressures, that there is no time limit in which you have to ""decide your purpose"" and that there is no 'one path' you have to take - there's no limit to all the things you can possibly pursue in life.  I suppose you need to just get out there and experience life/as many things as possible before you are able to make an informed decision regarding the career/s you want to have/paths you want to take (meanwhile filtering out everything you don't want). Sometimes you meet people of value/develop big ideas in the most unexpected places.  I recommend going to a whole range of meetups (meetup.com), get an INFJ pen pal!, solo travel (if you have the financial resources to do so), volunteer in your city, start a creative blog, apply for internships in fields that interest you, OH and I've found that writing out a bucket list (places to visit, people to meet, personal goals etc.) and placing it somewhere highly visible to remind me of the ever-growing amount of things to look forward to keeps me inspired and motivated. Have faith you'll figure it out.  Just don't forget to breathe and be kind to yourself! :)"

ETA: i also go to a weekly DBT group and it has helped TREMENDOUSLY. mindfulness is awesome, and working with my group has seriously changed my life for the better. i feel like i'm becoming my old self again, albeit kind of slowly and (obviously) not exactly the same."

People refuse to help each other out, there is no support or training, people get thrown into the deep end and given responsibilities with no power to enforce them and there have been many redundancies lately which has put people on edge as well.

Since I'm a Special Education teacher,I don't 'teach' the entire class, but work 1:1 with my students (with the help of aides).  Most days I'm able to do lesson plans for an hour (more if students are out), which gives my schedule the perfect balance for me.  This past Friday for instance, I spent 70% of the day sending emails, doing reports and making lesson plans, 30% doing fun activities with the students.  Now, one thing that can make or break a job are the people you work with--and part of the reason I love my job so much is for the supportive, wonderful people I work with. Few jobs have it and it took me a while to find the right place, but I'm so grateful to have found my ideal job :)"
infj,3ax849,ImpatientWind,12,Wed Jun 24 05:56:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think you'd be better off with, ""Want to have dinner with me?"" Grand gestures mean less than just being there. But hey, I don't know you or your INFJ, so take that with a grain of salt."
infj,3ax849,below_the_line,8,Wed Jun 24 06:11:03 2015 UTC,"This comment hits me.  My SO said this to me and I have been hooked ever since. Let me do an INFJ dissection of that question (don't laugh at me). First of all, it is dinner which implies he is interested enough to spend possibly a few hours into his night with me. Second, he didn't say ""you"" want to have dinner with me, which seems like he's putting me on a pedestal too soon. Didn't say ""want to have dinner"" and left it at that, he added ""with me"" making it a lot more personal. Not only that but he asked and I could've said no, which means I could've rejected him and he would've been completely fine with it. Confidence. See /u/Intempestivity 's post. He actually said ""want to have dinner with me tonight?"" which I would've said yes to but I had something to do so I suggested tomorrow night, meaning I am clearly interested as well because I still wanted the plans.  So intricately crafted I don't even know he knew what he did. He was just being ENTP.  Not to take that situation out of context, we were working on a project and had our lunch breaks together. Really hit it off. I found him attractive. Usually when people ask me questions, they expect me to ask them the same question, like permission to talk more about themselves. He didn't do that. He asked me a question, I answered. Asked him, he disregarded and kept the topic on me. I have never met such a confident person equally as mysterious as I've been told to be. He was attractive, but I disregarded the possibility of him liking me because I didn't think he would for many reasons.  After work, that's when he texted me that question. And from that point I knew he was clearly interested. And cue the 2-second INFJ dissection in my head before I responded.  It is refreshing to have someone be direct with you. Everyone I have encountered does this ""hey let's hang out"" type thing which is so vague. I have to work with them back and forth for plans, that is if I want to hang out with them. If I don't, it just seems like an empty gesture that's said just to be nice. Sometimes they do what you (/u/ImpatientWind) do and voice how they feel so early on, I don't feel the same way at all. It's as if you're saying ""I haven't known you very long but I've fabricated who I think you are and I don't care how you feel, I feel this way, do something about it."" Excuse you."

I'm just giving you that observation because 99 times out of 100, saying that cold turkey is just a bad, bad, horrible idea. Also, I feel a great deal of empathy for you, cause I'm the kinda sappy helpless romantic who likes that kinda thing... So I feel for you.   Honestly, there's no real safe bet to get anyone to notice you. There's lots of good ""how to get with an INFJ"" advice out there that's generally sound... Generally. But, you know really I think that in general if you're happy with who you are and are genuinely yourself, in a likeable way, you should feel comfortable striking up a conversation. Conversation being more than just ""How are you?"" although if you genuinely mean that question it might not be a bad idea.   Anyways, I don't really know if this is helpful at all.

Ask her on a date. Start off with something ""cute"" like ""Hey, I've got a raging boner for crush on you (etc etc) and was wondering if you'd like to go to dinner with me sometime (or whatever)."" To be quite honest I, another INFJ lady, prefer expressions of feelings to be as to-the-point as possible. The worst she can do is say no, and remember, you can't make someone like you - if she rejects you, have your sad time and move on. Save the ""I need you in my life"" for when you're in a serious relationship."

I think when my BF asked me out he stated how important I was to him and said he wanted me to be a bigger part of his life and get to know me better. It was very sweet, but he also asked and gave me time to think about whether or not I wanted to date him."
infj,3ax849,Intempestivity,2,Wed Jun 24 11:12:05 2015 UTC,"I would freak the hell out and run away from that so fast.  Even if someone meant it just as in they wanted me to be their bff and not their partner, I would still freak out and run away.  First off, accept the fact that she has her own autonomy and the right to say ""no"".  If she isn't interested, as much as that sucks for you, accept it and move on.  Don't keep forcing the issue at hand and back her in to a corner.  If you already know her a bit and have had a couple of conversations, just casually mention that you would be interested in taking her out on a date and see what she says.  Be honest and to the point, but not overwhelming.  If you don't know her at all, then tell her that you'd like to get to know her better on a date.  Be honest and to the point, but not overwhelming.  Seriously, that's all you need to do.  If she says no, accept it and move on.  If she says yes, great, plan a date."
infj,3ax849,lzimmy,2,Wed Jun 24 12:14:09 2015 UTC,"Not advisable.  I'm not sure there's any type that finds desperation attractive? You may feel that you need her in such a strong capacity, but letting her know that might freak her out. If I felt someone ""desperately needed"" me or they were going to do something stupid, I'd feel an incredible sense of unwanted obligation.  It might make her run away because she doesn't want to be personally responsible for your feelings and well-being, especially if she doesn't think she can fit the bill.  Just say, ""Hey, I really like spending time with you, want to go out tomorrow?""."
infj,3ax849,EverydayMusic,2,Wed Jun 24 14:14:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think that statement would be perceived well.  We analyze with a lot of feeling. The first thing I would (personally) ask myself is ""What is the motivation behind this desperation?"" ""What do they want from me and why?""  Your best bet is being genuine. Whatever that means to you. Almost all INFJs would see any kind of bullshit from a mile away. It's an instant turnoff."
infj,3aun0u,freshasthedickens,15,Tue Jun 23 17:20:51 2015 UTC,"The best part about intimacy is that you can feel anyway about it, and it is neither weird or otherwise incorrect. Without a doubt I'm sure you will hear many tell you otherwise, but those are the people that have already been lost in a restricted view of it. While I by all means don't mind whatever people think of intimate acts, I do believe that it is important you find someone who understands how you feel and is willing to embrace that.  The most fun and pleasure you'll gain is if you feel comfortable, and this isn't excluded to just intimacy. Just think about the passions you have and what really makes your mind become vivid. We all have different drives and directions, I guess if I have to speak on behalf of myself, I am not very limited. Whenever people block themselves from enjoying something, due to whatever criteria they may have, then you quickly realize that a lot of conditions have to be met before you will experience any joy.  We do live in a world where we are constantly bombarded with ""ideas"" of how a man or a woman should be. Maybe I'm blessed that I don't need someone to tell me what I enjoy, but I do feel that a lot of young people especially end up just committing to social standards or ideas that hey perhaps deep down do not really wish.   Intimacy can be many things, there's no doubt it's a physical act, but it can be equally enhanced mentally. Having a partner that allow themselves to be open to the idea, that intimacy and especially sex is more than just penetration and release for both, you will more than like find yourself enjoying this part of life too. That said it will just not be something that everyone is equally into, but if you can find someone who has the same desire and drive, then you will likely appreciate it more than with someone who just isn't a great match for you.  If you asked most people if they would prefer sex compared to something more simple and innocent as holding the hand of their partner, I do not doubt that most would choose sex. The curious thing about this is that, if you are well in tune with your own emotions and passion, then you actually could enjoy holding the hand of your partner even more. It very much depend on the mood and how you perceive the given moment. Some people prefer sunsets others dawn, and then there are those that enjoy both."

But remember, it is a connection with another person. That impacts sex, and when it's ""just"" a physical act, you take out a big part of what impacts how good it is.  Your deepest connections are sex-free. That's fine. But do you think if you added sex, theoretically, it'd be deeper connection? A big part of it is also mindset - if you focused more on connection, you might find it amazingly cool."
infj,3aun0u,ImpureHedonism,3,Tue Jun 23 23:48:17 2015 UTC,I can go either way - I do enjoy the physicality of sex itself but I don't really appreciate it unless it's with someone I care about.   That being said I have a super high sex drive with my SO lol

Without it I'm fine, however there's things that aren't as vibrant as they otherwise would be. It sorta makes everything else more enjoyable.  Unfortunately it's never as great as you remember and I never feel ""connected"" with the other person like I feel I should be, maybe I've never been with the right person though.  If you're partner is into and having a good time though, isn't that all that matters? That's the way I look at it. Especially considering Fe it makes sense: its impossible to have a good time if others aren't, but if others are enjoying themselves you are too."

You don't need sex to be attracted to someone because you see it as just a physical act. Not sure how other well-developed Se INFJs feel about sex, but to me it is a form of communication that is only complete if a strong emotional connection exists. I want all of my partner physically, mentally, and emotionally and sex can reveal just how close, comfortable, and soulful my relationship really is.  /u/Paragonight has a point on ""how our world is bombared with ideas of how a man and woman should be."" I think this post accurately encompasses that idea."

I completely agree. The best sex of my life has always been with someone I have a strong emotional connection with. When I was younger and just ""hooking up"" sex was okay, but it was only for pleasure and I didn't really care about it, but in a deeply committed relationship it's a TOTALLY different story and a major component to a healthy bond."

infj,3aun0u,lbsmith5,4,Wed Jun 24 03:10:40 2015 UTC,"It might be a sexual attraction vs romantic attraction thing.  First of all, sexual attraction is the intrinsic attraction to someone and desire to do sexual thing with them. Romantic attraction is the intrinsic attraction to someone on a romantic aspect and desire to do romantic things with them, like cuddling, kissing and so on. Generally, what is considered the most common combination is heterosexual heteroromantic. But that's not always the case. Some people also identify as asexual (don't feel the need to have sex with someone), or aromantic (don't feel the need to have a romantic relationship with somone). To most asexual people, sex is boring or meaningless. They might still have a sex drive, and might masturbate (and many asexuals do). To me, sex is an important part of my life and my connection with my partner, as well as romance.

infj,3atuml,jeff233,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:46:13 2015 UTC,"This most certainly is a matter of perspective and I greatly appreciate how varied people choose to look on it. I would not be surprised if many people disagree with me, but to me it is like this. Either we are all significant or all insignificant. I like to believe that we are all significant and we do influence the greater scheme of things, no matter what it is you do.  You may find yourself working in a job where no one will notice you, you don't meet people or perhaps you simply live in a remote area with no human contact. How can this possibly influence anyone or the greater picture? It may not do presently in a direct way, but you have literally no way of knowing what will come your way. None of us can see the future. In addition to that, you may already of placed your impact on this world, with actions of the past. I know the people I've influenced in my life, and while we all may feel small, the prints we leave on the world branches out eternally, and it doesn't even stop when you are long gone.  In this sense, all we do does influence everything that happens in this world, I actually would feel somewhat ignorant to think it did otherwise. That said, I do completely get how someone would think ""the stuff I do really doesn't matter"", and while that may be your opinion which you are more than allowed to have, someone else may view it in a different light.  Take something like trust, our in entire world relies on trust. There are however many levels of trust, and even if you ""do not trust"" any other human, you actually still indirectly do, as your existence relies on it. From the person who delivers the goods to a store, to the garbage man who empties your trash, the entire world is connected in one giant web, even more so today than ever before. Just take the internet, it is more than likely I would never have read many of the things even just written in this thread, you may feel that whatever you contributed was not important or great, but it actually enriches my life to see and read how other people feel. It helps me understand others better and be very appreciative of how far humanity has come. We still have a long way to go, especially perhaps so in regards to making everyone feel like they matter.  Even if you don't disagree with this, the truth is, we wouldn't of come this far alone, so either we all are significant or everyone is absolutely insignificant, all life matter, even if you may not feel that way."
infj,3atuml,Paragonight,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:39:13 2015 UTC,"I have a different perspective. We are all insignificant. I think thinking that empowers us to do greater things.   You are insignificant in the scale of the universe. But you are the universe just as the universe is within you. We are made by the same tiny particles in our environment. The death of us and the death of stars birth new forms of life and energy. The concept of thinking your life is significant is funny in the sense that you think of yourself as someone important, to be respected, it creates this sense of entitlement, that you deserve everything that you have. Whatever you have contributed is not important nor great. It was simply a contribution. Your significance does not help you understand others better nor does it make you feel appreciative. No one owes you anything for doing what you do. Your significance is arrogance and recognizing your insignificance can make you see just how human we all really are. Each and every one of us.  No we wouldn't have come this far alone. We cannot be alone. It is impossible for us to exist independently of each other or our surroundings because you're part of this universe as it is a part of you. But I could just be an existential nihilist."
infj,3atuml,demesure,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:07:37 2015 UTC,"That is the beauty of existence. There is no right or wrong way to interpret it, granted I'm sure many will argue otherwise. To me it isn't important if we are or aren't significant. I more than understand those with the idea, that nothing really matters or that we are insignificant in the scale of the universe. I guess it all depends on what you are comparing things to, as always everything is relative.  A good question would be; ""How does having either view influence your life?"" I am in complete agreement that no human will ever owe me anything, but many others do indeed feel entitlement. I welcome everyone to think and come up with their own conclusions about life and the universe. Whatever each of us choose to believe will give our life the most meaning is what is important, it doesn't matter what you, I or anyone else believe. In that sense, whichever perspective we each may hold, it is up to each individual to decide if that is negative or positive. We all look at things quite differently, I have no problems myself with accepting whichever way people choose to look at the meaning of anything. Most of us likely benefit from being around those with a view which fall in great alignment with our own, but I appreciate just as much to observe and learn from those who are no where near that.   It is easy to underestimate others and their intentions, and every word and idea of something can hold a very different meaning to each of us. You may associate significance with what you described, but it is however just your view, which is no more correct or wrong than that of someone else. Likewise anything I write is just my view, I don't need others to respect it or to feel important, I'm just a simple being passing through life, and I don't care much for status or labeling things. Some people will find negativity everywhere, others more positive experiences and some complete neutrality. In the end everything is indeed just a matter of perspective."

I'm not disabled but do have a chronic pain condition (ehler danlos syndrome) and I've found it gives me a lot more patience than I think I'd have otherwise because I can relate. That said, it's still really hard sometimes when the disability prevents us from doing something and I have all this anger at this invisible force that's controlling our lives. I try not to take it out on them and mostly succeed. And they are forgiving and understanding which helps.  This will sound odd but the best thing you can do is give up; that's the advice my spouse's shrink gave them in regard to anxiety and depression. Holding out hope in an unresolvable situation like chronic illness or mental illness is a recipe for heartache and stress. You have to give up that hope that someday things will be like they were before. They won't be. And you have to honestly look at yourself and make sure that you can live with that because it's unfair to both people if you stay and end up resenting them."

infj,3aqsti,guywhohateshimself,10,Mon Jun 22 19:28:39 2015 UTC,"I think ENFPs are great. Their quirky sense of humor is what draws us in and the hint of something deeper is what makes us stay. They are just sincerely, genuine people who will go to great lengths to insure that they are acting inline with their morals. They talk to the weird kid, bump up the group's energy to make sure everyone's having a good time, and love to genuinely compliment people. I probably laugh and smile the most when I'm around my ENFP friends. I think ENFPs are really good at breaking people out of their shells, and I love the person I get to be when around them. They are so non-judgmental that people just become way more relaxed and unfiltered around them.   We are also both pretty close to the middle of the introversion/extroversion scales, so neither type really dominates the conversation - there's usually a good flow (even better if it's one-on-one). Both types have a good balance between thinking and feeling, so it's not like an emotional roller coaster 24/7. My ENFP friend is also kind of the classic underdog that you always want to root for. Whenever he wins or gets success, I just get happy for him and it inspires me to work harder. Whether or not INFJ-ENFPs are the ideal romantic or platonic relationship, I don't know. All I know is I love spending time with them, and if there were more people like them, the world would be a much better, goofier, and more authentic place."
infj,3aqsti,twigstix,10,Mon Jun 22 22:35:13 2015 UTC,"Honored to have inspired this! I feel it's only appropriate I give a shot at answering this. I can't possibly capture all I think of you, but I can try.  I only have a handful of ENFP friends, but one I've known for four years and I consider one of my closest friends.  Something about her just draws me out of my shell. When we're goofing off and having fun, it's like my personality is climbing out of the cave of my mind and embracing the light for the first time. At first it's uncertain steps, but it's like my ENFP friend is like ""come on! There's a whole world out here."" Some of my most memorable moments have been with her or would never have been the same without her.  Small example: We were both recently at a friend's wedding, and I saw this other dude walk by with a fantastic suit/jacket/tie combination. Introverted me just tells my ENFP friend and admires from afar. ENFP lights up and excitedly tells me to just go and tell him. I do, and we all have a laugh and a great conversation. Such a small thing, but just one of the many examples where the ENFP just draws out everything in me.  On the more serious end, I see my ENFP friend as one of the few who understands me and whatever thoughts I wrestle with. I lead a Christian ministry, which puts me in many situations where I struggle hard to balance caring for my team, accomplishing something, and taking care of myself. Whenever I bring these up or anything else, my ENFP friend just asks questions which are so on point and challenge me to think in a new way. By the end of pretty much all our conversations my mind is CHURNING with fresh ideas and I feel like I can take on the world.  People say ENFP's can be flakey with commitments. I see that, but you legitimately just follow your heart and your passions and they lead you all over the place, who can fault you for that? We INFJ's easily stand our ground and immerse ourselves in a cause, so it's an interesting contrast. But honestly, your tendency to jump around is something I sometimes envy. It reminds me there's more to life and I can't keep my head down. Being around you inspires me to think out of the box.  TL;DR: ENFP's are amazing because they delight just in being alive. We connect so well and get creative and have a blast together. You make me think in a new way and make me realize I'm not taking on a bit scary world all on my own. My world gets a whole lot bigger and more hopeful whenever you're around."
infj,3aqsti,augustusprime,8,Tue Jun 23 02:43:08 2015 UTC,"My longest/best relationship was with an ENFP, although we didn't know each other's types until the end.  There are certainly some traits that clash... their restlessness, our lack of spontaneity... but I found for the most part the ENFP to be like the other side of the same coin.  I don't know if all of these things are strictly ENFP-related, but I'd say their compassion, their childlike energy/curiosity, their affection... there was always a level of our intuition being very much aligned... communication was an issue sometimes, but for the most part, we knew what the other was saying or thinking without words.  And that was always a really powerful thing.  Yes, they can be exhausting and drive you crazy.  But when they're happy and it's because of you, there's no better feeling as an INFJ to bask in that warmth."

Where I'd naturally go left, they go right, up is down, and in and out are all backwards, yet there's a direct and equal correlation. We act and are driven by very similar things and come to similar conclusions, but the focus and approach are just reversed.  It's like looking at a flipped image of yourself; it's both incredibly familiar yet very different.   Being friends with ENFPs is like getting to watch yourself make decisions in an alternate universe.   I have a lot of love and respect for you guys and enjoy spending time with you.  You're different, but in a very comfortable and predictable way. With the right ENFP, it can feel like you're one complete unit and can tackle the world."

In his words:  ""You understand so much of how things are and why they may be that way (good), but then you go ahead and fall into those trap often (bad).  Honestly, I feel like I’m fairly centered in 2 extremes with varying degrees of areas where I branch out, but you’re like both extremes at once, overall, both average to the middle, but we’re both so different, I just thought of this and found the symbolism very meaningful and correct.  Here’s a pictorial graph of how it might work, overall we both average to the middle (give or take), but how we get to the average is drastically different.

They're easy to get along with, nothing complicated just a walking piece of simplicity and happiness, full of energy, refreshing. When I first started college knowing no one, I met an ENFP girl who introduced me to her friends and her sibling. She seemed to be what held the entire group together because of her openness, acceptance, and genuine concern for others. She would recruit new people through initiation and inclusiveness no matter what kind of person they were (Ne going all over the place with Fe as shotgun). Very compassionate and courageous in my opinion with a selfless attitude.  I encountered an ENFP later at my work. She was also open and accepting. But I notice that ENFPs don't seem to live in this world. Their Ne goes through all these ideas. Their thinking is optimistic and their knowledge is of untangible things that sometimes are not supported by facts but by pure intuition. They don't know much of what is going on in the real world but they do try to seek the unbiased truth (Te). They have this innocent sense of ""oh what is that, how does it work"" as if everything new that interest them is a wonder that they must take apart and understand. ENFPs get along with everyone. If a person annoys them (very difficult to annoy an ENFP), they'll bite their tongue. Behind closed doors they'll rant about their disbelief in how shallow/crude/etc. that person is while trying to make sense of it.  When I do talk about something in depth with an ENFP, they listen and have this wonderstruck attitude that makes me feel like what I'm sharing is being appreciated. They have this comforting energy. Generally, ENFPs are one of the most pleasant types to be around."

I like being around people, and we are both really in our heads a lot too. In that way, I relate to them.  My female ENFP friend is full of passion. Love conquers all, makes great money as a saleswoman. I really, really like her, although her overflowing passion for a lot of things get her in trouble sometimes (broken hearts, mostly).  I can easily talk to ENFP's about anything, but there's that time in the conversation when we kinda mean the same thing but we disagree on how to apply certain ""ideas"" into practice. Maybe it's the J/P difference, or intuitions clashing?? Does that make sense? I also think they're more philosophical, creative, and positive in general, and are able to make themselves happy on their own. We are more logical, crafty, and idealist, but are solemn people.

I have absolutely zero experience when it comes to ISTP romantic relationships, but there seems to be plenty of past topics about INFJ/ISTP interactions.  I'd suggest you do a search on ISTP in this sub and you'll find plenty of advice if you don't find what you're looking for here.   FWIW, the ISTP operating manual seems encourage making everything as open and unambiguous as possible. If you have feelings for this person, mention it.  If you want him to initiate things, say so. They aren't going to take offense and seem to prefer people were incredibly direct and open about their feelings than simply dropping hints. They are definitely not mind readers and don't seem to enjoy being put in that position.  If you'd rather not assume, the best way is to be very open about it."

Even if he has feelings for you, he might not want a relationship. You'll never know. As far as I can tell, after a month and a half of hanging out, you have enough merit to ask.  Figure out what you really want. A downfall of the INFJ is that we become too invested in someone else it becomes too difficult to pull back and much easier to delve deeper.

infj,3anwi7,nismo267,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:28:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your concern. I have told a therapist and a psychiatrist in the past, and I was medicated for a while, and you're right, the voices did go away. There were several reasons why I stopped taking the meds, not the least of which is that I am surrounded by 'spiritual' people who believe the voices are real and you can and should live with it. And I do believe the voices can be good for me sometimes (when I realize the voices are my own, they provide insight into what I really think). I have been debating getting back on the meds and you may have pushed me in that direction."
infj,3anwi7,Northerncrafts,3,Mon Jun 22 13:54:39 2015 UTC,"Yep, I can see where you're coming from and the voices are real however only to you. Your mind created them. The ideas that they vocalize are not necessarily true and can become damaging over time. They do not exist to other people and if you begin to invest and allow them to have control in your life, you will become more submersed in your own mind versus living externally with everyone else.   Living in your own mind will be a major problem, especially if you are an internal person to begin with. The voices have the potential to submerge you into a false world and it will likely be that you will lose grip on reality. This is a problem because the false reality you may be heading into, often is for many clients incredibly terrifying, demeaning, depressing and unpredictable. If you let this continue and you start falling into that world, you will have an incredibly hard time getting out.  It is like a toothache. You have a cavaity and if you go to the dentist to get it filled, the pain may be there (may be not) but he fills your tooth, you have a filling, and your life carries on. If you don't go to the dentist, your cavity will eventually get to the root of your tooth. It can spread if not treated and if left for too long, your teeth will have to be pulled- or fall out in extreme cases.  If you live externally and be brave in getting treatment, you will have saftey, predictability, happiness, and you will be in control. I don't know what the severity is but depending if this is new or how loud the voices are, the condition can be assisted if caught early enough. The condition can also be made much more livable and dealing with it now, I guarentee you, will give you more clarity.  Best wishes."

TL;DR nothing diagnosed, but eating & sleeping problems, panic attacks, ""hallucinations,"" skin picking, suicidal at some point (not anymore)  I've never been diagnosed with depression or anxiety or anything of the like, but I still had a crap couple of years with my parents which led me to eating problems (I don't think it would be called an actual disorder) where I didn't eat breakfast or lunch, but big snack and dinner, and sleeping problems where I slept on average 2-5 hours a night, never more, sometimes  as many as 2 sleepless nights in a week no matter how tired I was.   I also had some panic attacks where I couldn't breathe for short amounts of time (but I don't think it qualifies as anxiety either, it was periodic and only happened a few times, was just constantly stressed but these happened when I was away form all the stressful things, almost as if i couldn't take the rest).   There were also a few years where I was completely isolated (I isolated myself) and wanted to commit suicide, I tried a few times one year. Besides that, it affected my grades where I became one of the worst students.   Now I have what I think could be dermatillomania (I pick at my face, back, neck and arms constantly, my arms are scarred all over and bloodied every day). I also have these sort of ""hallucinations"" (I hesitate to call anything by these names because nothing is diagnosed, I've only seen a psychoogist once for half an hour) where I can hear and feel my phone vibrate with messages and phone calls from my parents, as well as them fighting int he streets, which fills me up with sheer dread each time each time I hear it even if I feel normal when I get an actual phonecall from them. It's happened while I was staring at my black phone screen or could see my mom on the couch.  Last thing only happened twice: once it wa a form of night sweat where I woke up shaking and with cold sweat (I thought it was a myth) completely startled in the middle of the night, and I felt genuinely afraid. Another time I woke up and was paralized and sweating but I wasn't scared, it was just a freaky experience where I woke up not knowing what was happening. I definitely wouldn't call either of these night terror based on descriptions I've heard, and nothign I said here was diagnosed, it's just things that happened that affected me. This was mostly while I was 11-13 but some of it still happens now (""hallucinations"" and sleep problems mostly) - I'm 15."
infj,3anwi7,TheQuietudeAbides,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:09:36 2015 UTC,"I have issues with depression and anxiety. To me, being INFJ is about how I interact with other people, and depression is about how I interact with myself. Anxiety (social in my case) has some of both. And depression for me has also led to some deep bad mental habits (self-criticism, self-sabotage) that may have become part of my personality at this point.   To me, being an INFJ means getting tired out after hanging around people because I can feel acutely everything going on in the room, it means always turning things over in my mind before and after the fact, and it means having certain kinds of compassion and motivation in specific situations.   Depression, on the other hand, is more related to my self-image and self-definition and habits of self-treatment. Therapy has helped me see this more clearly.  My anxiety has been mostly chemical, and meds have helped it (but they don't change my thinking habits, thus depression is still and issue).  I guess it's pretty clear cut to me."

Really, though, the majority of my mental health issues center around my excessive amounts of anxiety.   It can be hard sometimes, but I'm usually able to manage. For example, I'm rather anxious right now because I've been having some stomach issues for the past few days. Since my anxiety has a large focus on GI-related problems, it's been... rather overactive as of late. And, you know, it's making things hard for me; I can hardly sit still, I'm too nervous to eat much of anything, and my mind is constantly categorizing possible causes of my stomach issues and their potential results. But, you know, I'll manage. I'll go for a long bike ride today (assuming my stomach permits), attend a Monday church service, and I'll don my uniform and go to work tomorrow. I might be anxious the whole time, but I'm still going to do my best to keep on keeping on.   As for type influencing mental illness... Honestly, anybody can develop a psychiatric disorder, regardless of type. You could get an ESTJ with severe ADHD and you could see an xNFP with OCPD. However, I do believe that personality type can influence the progression of mental illnesses. For example, I'd believe that ExxJ types with ADHD would be more able/willing to fight their disorder than, say, a dominant perceiving type (ExxP and IxxJ). I would assume that thinking types (especially STs) would be able to fight their anxiety better than feeling types, but I also would assume that feeling types would be able to fight depression better than a thinking type due to their deeper connection with their values and emotions.   tl ; dr - You can't help the hand you're dealt, but you are in control of how you play your hand."

infj,3anwi7,Nazmazh,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:45:58 2015 UTC,"I've been aware of my depression and anxiety for a while. It took me over a year of being aware before I finally got the nerve to seek treatment for it, and that was only after I nearly bottomed out due to being stressed and coping by avoidance. But realistically, I have probably been depressed most of my adult life, probably extending further back into my teenage years. I just wasn't aware of what depression was.  I've found that counseling was very helpful in helping me get things back into control. Even just having someone to just talk to and get myself out of a somewhat toxic loop in my own headspace was very helpful. My counselor taught me a few cognitive behavioural therapy tricks to help break myself out of spirals.  I still have that strong ""protect myself, keep my guard up"" urge that INFJs have, so I really haven't told too many people about my mental health issues, though, like my counselor said, I'd want people to know if I had a broken leg or flu and couldn't function, so why should depression/anxiety be any different? It's something I'm working on, I guess.  Someone very close to me, who I believe to be an ESTJ also has confided their depression to me. I know that we both handled our lows very differently. They got very huffy, snarly, and generally just miserable to be around. Pretty much the case was that they were unhappy, but would not address what was the cause, only lashing out at every thing, person, and situation around them. On the other hand, I basically shut down and withdrew from anything social, but was very careful to try to keep a ""happy mask"" on, so to speak, when I did have to do anything with others. I'd hate to be a nuisance to my friends and family with my problems, but I'd also really, -really- hate to be pitied or coddled.  Like I was discussing with my counselor, it's largely a difference of introversion/extroversion. Now that I've gotten more into MBTI stuff, I see that it's a little bit deeper than that, but the basic principle still applies. As an ESTJ, they wanted to re-assert control over whatever they could (I understand that type to be very much about ambition, outward organization, and optimizing productivity, which can make them very bad at things like recovery/recharging. I know this particular one treats ""downtime"" like it's a dirty word and outright rejected the idea of not working a job that made them clearly miserable - not working at all, in their books, would be even worse).  Meanwhile, I withdrew and turned my negative feelings towards myself. I just wanted to be left alone to sort through things on my own. I hate feeling vulnerable and weak, which is what most attempts at sympathy and kindness, no matter how well-meaning and genuine they are, leave me feeling.  So, I apologize for the bit of a rambling response but, to get back to your main point, yes, sometimes the want to be alone with your thoughts, even negative ones might just be an INFJ thing, but I would argue that depression takes the worst/most negative traits of our type and amplifies them, as it does with other types."

The two guys I'm close friends with are awesome, genuine people. The way they show care, contrary to female ESFJs imo (my roommate's an ESFJ), is less overt and in-your-face. Like what you said, they're really down-to-earth and I really appreciate that about them. I'm comfortable around them, and find myself opening up to them a lot, maybe not necessarily about super deep thoughts but just life in general. I love spending time with them because they aren't overwhelming. As far as hot-cold dynamic, I totally understand. I guess they can come off as a bit shallow. That's certainly what I first thought of them when I met them. They just seemed indifferent, not cold, but just aloof and seemed like people who do not care for depth and thought. But I found that I was wrong haha.  As far as the ESFJ guy I dated, I think it didn't work out because he was too complacent-seeming for me. I'm a very passionate, intense person and he was kind of a softy. Also, I guess... it sounds awful, but he was a bit boring and I wish he had more of a backbone because he was unassertive and unassuming. I like adventure and spontaneity, and I needed someone who could be both fun and steady. I think I'm learning that I'm attracted to xxTP types, actually. But anyway, I'm still friends with this ESFJ guy (our breakup was immensely and awfully non-chalant), but he's kind of one of those people who grew to be annoying... which I don't think is due to his personality type but more to his decision-making skills.   I can't imagine myself dating another ESFJ... and that's just me. I need someone thrilling but also brutally honest and in-your-face with me, and ESFJ men aren't really that.   On the other hand, your ESFJ might be more mature than the guy I dated... so I think you should work on getting to know him more. I do admire their practicality and down-to-earth personality, like you said, so maybe that's something that will impact the way you feel about this dude."
infj,3aon4w,justanontherpeep,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:05:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!  Yup, totally see the occasional shallow waves coming in and out. I think the shallowness only occurs in the social world, though. In other areas of life, like work and finance, he seems very serious. Other than that, pretty simple guy. Doesn't need much, loves sports, mostly happy. The very logical mind of his does clash sometimes.  I do have trouble with his less-than-blunt nature, too. I've never been the blunt one in any relationships, but with this one, I seem to be the one asking those questions.  What do you mean by your ESFJ man's decision-making skills? Would you care to elaborate?  Thanks again!"
infj,3aon4w,justanontherpeep,2,Mon Jun 22 07:29:53 2015 UTC,"I work with him in a newsroom so I see and interact with him fairly often. I think he's just spiraled downhill because he's been lacking  motivation in life, and focused a lot of his time on trying too hard to change the way he appears to people. It really does come off as trying too hard, and gets a bit annoying when it starts to rub off on his social interactions with the people around, especially with me.   Maybe for me, I see him this way because he's one of those people I've doorslammed out of my life, not deliberately but more so just gradually. And it's not out of spite or anything because our breakup was so chill. I just intuitively did it haha."

infj,3am9e5,angelsambition,20,Sun Jun 21 16:44:46 2015 UTC,"First of all, I love this question.  If it were up to me, I would honestly go with the nomadic travel lifestyle. (that is, if there was nothing tying me down, keeping me where I am now.) It's such a dream of mine actually, but one I'm too scared to probably ever attempt to achieve. I'd really love it more than anything if I was able to live in one spot for a month or two, or however long.. and just go to the next place whenever I decided. I'd like to think I'd get a job doing whatever I could, wherever I'd be, and just work my way around from place to place. I wouldn't mind it one bit.   This is the kind of life I always day dream about living. Sometimes I get legitimately sad and anxious and worried that I'm wasting my life because I'm stuck working 2 jobs in the same town I grew up in. Because I'm not traveling and experiencing new things like I want to. I want to be able to soak up as much knowledge and experience as I can, from as many different places and cultures as I can. I want to be thrown into new and surprising situations with new and surprising people and be able to watch myself grow and mature and just see what kind of person it all turns me into.   But the sucky part about life is that I'll probably never get the chance to do any of that. Not with these all these ""necessary"" things, like rent and a car payment and groceries and just living. I usually loathe the mentality of ""oh if I had more money I'd be able to do A and B and C.."" but it's true for me, and especially when it comes to wanting to be able to travel and do things like this. Bleh. Also there's the relationship issue. I'd like to think I could handle doing this kind of thing all on my own, but I know I'd get really lonely. I could see the loneliness getting too heavy and me getting too sad about it. I don't know if I'm a strong enough person to be able to live that kind of life. But I want to be."
infj,3am9e5,xmoon_kitten,4,Sun Jun 21 17:51:43 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about the travelling lifestyle a lot lately, and this is pretty much how I feel - you've expressed it perfectly! There's technically nothing major tying me down to my current location, so I can't really say that's what's stopping me; more the fear of travelling like this on my own. It's not something I think I'm cut out for, at least not at this moment in time. I hope that you do find a way to achieve this to some extent; when I feel lousy about this and worry I might never travel places, I try and tell myself that maybe I'll be able to some day if I meet the right person to share it with and help me along the way. That sounds a little co-dependant to rely on someone else, but I guess the most important thing is making sure you're comfortable with what you're doing."

I'd like to encourage you to at least research the possibility because you never know what may happen."

Lived in Thailand for a while, etc. I absolutely adore the nomadic lifestyle and it completely destroys the alternative except for in one regard: it gets kinda lonely. Like in an existential way. You meet people all the time and do wonderful things together - like the time in Cambodia I met a French-Canadian AIDS worker and a German about to launch his own tech company while touring the temples of Angkor. I just met them earlier that same day at my hostel. And a day later, they were gone forever.   And however long after that, you go home and realize that nobody is on your level. Like you had all these deep and crazy and fun and scary and enlightening things happen to you and when you try to give those thoughts some life your friends say ""oh cool"" and keep scrolling on their smartphones.   A part of me wonders, then, if having the permanent abode can be good for this reason: people can come to you and participate in shared experiences. If I had a plot of land to do whatever I wanted with, I'd make a big ass martial arts training studio and let whoever felt like coming a place to practice and learn. I'd also make a free art studio and encourage people to make something beautiful for their home and community. Think about all the cool people you could meet with something like that who would then able able to really connect with you."

It has it's perks, meeting different types of people and seeing different geography and types of weather is an adventure. It was hard for me to make good friends that would stick around(text/email/ect..) even if i moved across country. I've met some people who I could imagine being genuine friends with for my whole life, but was never in one place long enough for us to get to that point in the relationship. It's a hassle and I think consistency in relationships is important to infjs, or at least me. I don't see anything wrong with travel, I love it actually, but sometimes you need somewhere to call home. I still haven't left North America, and I I would like to, so I'm not quite don't traveling yet, but I'm about to be on my way back from Hawaii to Texas in July."

infj,3am9e5,mirror_effect,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:50:48 2015 UTC,"This is a hard question for me, because I've been struggling to answer this myself for almost two decades now. I have a sincere desire to explore the world, but just as strong is the need to retreat and lay a foundation somewhere for my future.  Despite having a large circle of friends and acquaintances that I sincerely enjoy and care about, there is less than a handful of people (basically my immediate family) that I deeply love and need. They are the anchor that tethers me to the world--in a good way--and unless they are traveling with me, there's only so far I will wander until I feel the tug of that bond and it brings me home again.  Each member of my family has a bit of the adventurer and wanderer in them, so if we could travel as a nomadic tribe, we could do that indefinitely. In terms of just myself, in the past few years alone I've rented a house in Croatia, helped elephant researchers track their tagged animals in the South African bush, swooned over the architecture of Barcelona and Madrid, ate my way across Paris, fell in love with the Scottish highlands, attended a meditation retreat in New Delhi, explored the treasures of the Hapsburgs, soaked in turn of the century Hungarian bath palaces, seemingly walked every inch of Prague, kayaked through Stockholm, ate the best gelato while wandering the streets of Florence and the canals of Venice, and just last week I was enjoying the midnight sun of Alaska, wandered its pristine wilderness and saw its glaciers before they become extinct...and that's not even all of it.  The thing I learned is that no matter where I go, what I do, and what wonders I see, the only thing in this world worth anything are those few people I come home to.  When I'm not stomping all over the globe, I pretty much stay in one place, working on my own business and farming. Right now I'm trying to save up for some farmland where I can live self-sufficiently in a tiny home. Like many here, my dream is to have my own place where I can live almost off-grid and do what I want in privacy and peace.  In the cold months I'll travel.  I've been working this model of switching between one mode and the other and it seems to be working for me just fine. However, if my ultimate nightmare comes true and I somehow lose my family, I'll probably give up all my stuff and float around the world untethered, or retreat into near-total seclusion. But for now my balancing act seems to work."

infj,3an4fm,Welwell,5,Sun Jun 21 21:18:28 2015 UTC,"She is pretty immature and I pretty much have myself figured out at this point so that is really why this has been difficult for me I think.   Both of you are still figuring yourselves out at this point. It's not that she doesn't like relationships anymore, but she does not know how to deal with her emotions and chooses not to. She fools around with a lot of guys because she feels insecure and needs that validation to feel complete. It's the same reason she talks to you. If she honestly wanted to get her life together, she would take your advice, and she would get her life together. But she talks to you to feel good about herself. And if you stop talking to her, she'll find someone else.  Part of being an INFJ is giving so much emotional support it becomes tiring after a while. Tiring because nothing has changed despite your efforts. That's were the Ti kicks in to actually evaluate the situation and provide a solution. If that solution isn't taken with a grain of salt, we understand that it's ultimately up to the person to make their own decisions.   You have an undeveloped Ti which makes it more difficult for you to see the more rational side of your situation. It makes it even more difficult because you care deeply for this person. But you seem to have already figured it out. You know what you have to do. And as another INFJ, I'll tell you that you're on the right path thinking you have to take care of yourself first before you can others.  And a step above that is learning how to cut people out of your life who bring you down and stunt your growth. Good luck."
infj,3an4fm,demesure,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:49:13 2015 UTC,Yeah I could have worded that better because I know I still have a lot of growing to do but yeah you're definitely right about a lot of that. It's interesting you mentioning the undeveloped Ti because normally I'm actually pretty good at being rational and I've definitely used my Ti to help some friends out in tough situations before but I've never really been this emotionally invested I guess. It feels like my Fe is overpowering my Ti or something. So maybe you're right and my Ti isn't as developed as I thought. Thanks a lot for the help.
infj,3an4fm,Intempestivity,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:04:47 2015 UTC,"You're good at being rational for others.  You want to offer them the best advice possible, and you can see the best course of action for them and recommend they take it.  However, when it comes to your own emotions and connections, Fe will totally overpower Ti.  Fe is how you act on your own decisions.  Developing Ti will help you take a step back and realise that factoring your feelings in to your own decisions is not always the best thing for yourself, just as it isn't always the best thing for your friends.  Everything demesure said is spot on.  You're still learning and still growing, and you absolutely need to take care of yourself, and that doesn't always mean including your feelings in your decisions.  As your Ti develops, you will learn how to draw boundaries for your own mental health and how and when to remove poisonous people in your life.  (Not saying your ex girlfriend is poisonous to you; there will be people you care about who do far worse to themselves and others, and those people need to be removed).  You will get there with time."
infj,3an4fm,mcsilly2009,3,Tue Jun 23 07:43:01 2015 UTC,"I am a male INFJ, and I can relate to you. I think that it is in an INFJ's nature to want to be able to help people and in extreme cases, to fantasize about rescuing themselves from others or from themselves. I believe it comes from our idealism.   One lesson you will probably learn many times in the next many years is that it's very difficult to change people. More specifically, the people who need the most changing often are the ones who change the least and end up disappointing you the most. You may also be there for people who have their shit together but who are just going through a tough time. Over time, you will find that these relatively stable people will respond very positively to your support, and you may be surprised that some people didn't ignore what you did for them.  One of the hardest things you will have to learn to do is to lower your expectations of other people. It's difficult because of the idealism, but over time, you will find that having lower expectations does not preclude you from helping others. It just protects you from repeated disappointment. Also, make an effort to expend some of your humanistic energies on people who seem to need it less but who actually may respond to it more."
infj,3an4fm,demesure,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:44:56 2015 UTC,"It comes from our idealism to an extent. Anything beyond that is our need of purpose, it makes us feel useful because we use our two strongest functions comfortably and we're good at it.  I don't believe you should have any expectations of people. Who are you to have expectations of someone else? Though, I do believe in standards. Realistic standards. And as an INFJ, it's difficult to draw the line when your empathy sees all these reasons for the way someone is. You just have to learn that those reasons are never an excuse for bad behavior. People ultimately have control over themselves."

We tend to attract people who need help. It's tough, but it's important to learn when your efforts are hurting you more than they're helping the other person. In my experience, the kind of people I attracted growing up were the kind who subconsciously took advantage of my caring nature. My mom often had to step in with me and my friends because I put too much of my energy into a person I couldn't help. These two types of people, INFJ's and the people we attract can be described as givers and takers. We're givers. The people that we help that leaves us drained are takers. Even when they try to give in return, their nature saps our energy and leaves us drained.  That's why it's so important to know yourself and when to avoid putting forth an effort to help someone who can't be helped by you. One of the most important things I learned to say was telling someone that I am not qualified to help them deal with their problem and to encourage them to seek out professional help. However, it's more difficult to recognize a harmful relationship when the other person just has an incompatible personality type instead of a real emotional health problems. I found myself stuck in an emotionally abusive friendship for five years. She didn't intend to hurt me. Our personality types were just too different. I hate conflict to the point where I'll avoid it at all cost, and I eventually got to the point where I was anxious all the time for things like being late to meet with her or having an opinion that was different from hers, or ""wrong"". I learned to recognize when I was wrong when she'd counter my opinion with a firm ""no."" followed by the correct opinion. I was her Igor. If you ever find yourself in that kind of relationship, it's important to listen when others tell you what they see is happening. Having another friend to help pull you out is a huge help and friends like that are valuable and should be kept around.  I apologize for the incredibly long rant. I've had a lot of experience (most of my life) with people who leave me drained because of my personality type and I don't want to see a fellow INFJ go through the same problem with it that I did.  TL;DR: Your health is #1 priority. Learn to recognize when you're setting yourself on fire and how to tell them to seek help from trained and qualified professionals. Also, feel free to message me any time. I've never met a fellow INFJ in person and it's nice being able to talk to people who actually understand where I'm coming from and how I feel :)"
infj,3an4fm,ashgage19,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:30:35 2015 UTC,"We have a tendency of helping people who are hurt and then once they feel better and have a confidence boost, usually we're the ones that are dropped or taken for granted. In my experience, it's somewhat my own fault for being a push over or for being too upfront in ways. At your age girls definitely tried to take advantage of me often.  Nowadays when I'm trying to help someone I'll be able to tell in an instant if they'll be a receiver of my information or if they're going to nod and only sort of understand, daydreaming in their own world. If I feel as though the other person doesn't care to listen to what I have to say or is taking advantage of that help, then I usually cut that person out in some way or end the conversation.  Fe and even Fi, can be difficult functions for us INFJs to get comfortable with. Communicating with other human beings is arguably the hardest part about being an INFJ."

infj,3ammrd,Paragonight,4,Sun Jun 21 19:44:32 2015 UTC,"Blessed or cursed with our ability to ponder over the actions of others, it can be to our own detriment if we don't learn to deal with our thoughts. While I don't believe there is one universal recipe that just magically works for everyone, (would be amazing if there was though), it is perhaps for the best. When I say that, I mean it in the sense that no matter what similarities we may share, on a personal level or experience wise, there will always be a multitude of aspects that sets us all apart. So what may work for me or someone else, could be completely useless to another person. That said I do believe there are many ways we can improve the state of our mentality.  One of the things we need to recognize about each other is that we take very differently to disappointment, defeat and otherwise negative experiences. I would say most of us get hit hard emotionally when such occur, but others are capable of turning it into something positive. Perhaps because I from a young age participated in competitive sport and thrived with it, I've always thought that losing and disappointment is a part of life as well as winning is. Yes it feels much better to be on the winning side of things, but when you lose or otherwise are rejected, you need to learn from what happened. The better one become at accepting that it is okay to fail, it is normal to experience a relationship of sorts that ended in less than ideal circumstances, then you can progress as a person.  In addition to that, you also need to understand that it is not your fault. None of us are responsible for how other people ""choose"" to act. We may be able to influence them to a certain degree, but the end choice is always theirs. Forgive yourself and take comfort in that it is alright to have a mental relapse. There are so many things in the world, completely random things that can trigger past emotions within us. Out there in the future, there might be the most sweetest, kind and gentle man who you have some sort of relationship with, and he'll accidentally trigger an emotion that just starts avalanche of feelings. Trust me on that, I've been that person to someone, but thankfully even if tears did flood, they can quickly go from painful ones to joyous ones. The important part is to recognize and separate the good ones from the bad.  Typically I find it that those people who are worth investing your time in, no matter if it's a friendship, relationship or other type of involvement, the best way to assess a person is to watch them consistently perform and showcase their personality over a longer period of time. By all means this is no guarantee that the person is all that they seem to be, as most of know or have experienced, people often change.  I like to believe that the core person I am today will be intact when I reach a much older age, hopefully I'll be much better in every regard and that people in general get better at finding inspiration to do the same.  Our minds can be very fragile, and that is by all means no mystery considering the amount of information overload we have to deal with in today's modern world. From media to social standards, no wonder if people end up being a bit bonkers with all the expectations lol. That said, I do believe in that we are all capable of strengthening our minds. It may come more easy to some than others, but you have to start somewhere and you do that by believing in yourself. If you can slowly learn to accept, that certain things are just outside our control, such as the action of others, then you'll give yourself an advantage in the long run. It may be difficult to adjust to, especially when one so badly want humans to treat each other well.  I am sorry that your ex cheated on you and that you now are stuck to your bed for awhile, but treat yourself better by allowing your mind to receive positive thoughts. What happened is the past, and while it hurts and still feels relevant, the important thing is that you have every chance to make that become a very distant memory. It may take awhile, but the more you can fill your life with good memories and people, the less place there is for negative thoughts. I know many may be or feel they are placed under circumstances where one sees no other choice but having to deal with their situation, but this is not true. We all have a choice, but more often than not, we either deem the other option impossible or we lack the courage to overcome it. It can be done, and we can get better, but it will require action of some sorts. Very few things change by themselves, including the ocean of bad memories that people of our past keeps crashing towards our shores.  Hope you can find motivation to overcome this, even if you without a doubt will have suffered too in the ability to trust others. Don't let anyone stop you from being the person you are, and whatever your qualities may be, there are people who will see that and never put you through such misery again. This may be difficult to fully see, but sometimes it is a blessing in disguise to have people leave our lives who had no good long lasting intentions anyway. All the best to you Herrokitty17, time to become a little heroine yourself."

If that doesn't work, I try reading. I am used to escaping into books, so it typically works well enough.  If that doesn't work, I try a movie - a bizzare movie. Something off-beat that other people haven't heard of.   If it's too crappy to distract me, I find a new one.  If none of these work, I go a little crazy for a day. Let everything out. Pour it all out of my eyes and nose. Until I fall asleep. Typically, the next day, I am able to accept that it is now OUT. And I usually have to take something for a massive headache.  If you end up at the last option, know that YOU HAVE NOT FAILED. Everyone has a bad day. Everyone gets overwhelmed by something. That's all it was.  Best of luck to you in healing.

It was interesting, to suddenly have so many strong, clear feelings for a while, even though they were mostly anger and sadness. But it got progressively better with time (weeks, months). Mostly.  I found that the feelings that wouldn't go away, the ones which forced my mind into that movie loop of betrayal, unfairness and abandonment, were actually much older (and powerful). The breakup didn't cause these feelings. The breakup just brought me into contact with them.   So it wasn't a question of an event in my life I had to deal with or a relationship with another person, but it was decidedly about me.   I don't know if that helps you.

infj,3al5r0,Apostle_1882,9,Sun Jun 21 07:22:52 2015 UTC,"A few thoughts on this. The one thing I have accepted from a young age is just how incredibly different all of us are. Even the closest friend/partner/family, whomever you have or do feel the most connected to, can at times present you with some sides that make them look like a complete stranger. I think we are all prone to doing this, and it typically happens during some kind of miscommunication or where words were just misinterpreted in the context of the relevant topic.  In addition to that and I feel this goes for all humans no matter our personality type. The more restricted you are in your requirements and expectations of others, as well as yourself, the more difficult it becomes to achieve an inner peace and comfort. We all judge people instantly from the second they say something, however how much value we put into what is being said varies greatly. If you possess patience and are willing to put effort into something, then I typically find that the end results are better overall.   I'm sure many fellow INFJ do agree that the best experiences we've had are those that are of significant length, because it typically gives us greater meaning and pleasure. That is not to say that brief joys can't be found, but it just depends on the actual event.   I'm content being alone as well as in company, although when it comes to being with someone, I much prefer small groups or just a one on one type of contact. The quality of such communication feels much better to me, than say in comparison to that of larger groups where anyone can fade into the background. Many people do put a heavy emphasis on looks in our world, no surprise considering how the media forces it actively as well as passively into our minds. Again, I could not care less how anyone looks, as it tells me very little about their personality. Some of the most beautiful people in this world are those that are considered both less attractive as well as very attractive. Basically, anyone on this planet can have a stellar personality that will appeal and attract everything that beats within your body and mind. I do know that this is not the case for a large chunk of the population and I'm completely okay with that. In the end none of us know when someone will enter our life and completely catch us off guard and change how we feel about things or perhaps just give us a fresh new perspective.   I do understand that all of this may be completely irrelevant to someone who has an impossible criteria, but every is capable of refining themselves to open up new opportunities. That does not go without saying that it might be a difficult challenge, but personal develop never stops, it is a life long journey. I've seen people, older than me as well as younger that have changed their mentality to open new doors. One thing that is guaranteed is that, nothing typically will happen by itself, we do have to take action to combat whatever struggles or obstacles are in our way from ending up where we would like to be.  I don't know what type of life you've had so far, but you are still young, heck I'll say someone who is in their 90s is still young, and it's never too late to rethink things and try new things. I do guess that because my mind works in this way, it is also the exact reason why I don't envy or think other people's lives are more wonderful, as I have the ability to do tailor my life to my own liking. Most of us do, but we often let fears or obstacles block our way to reach new grounds."

infj,3al5r0,SureAviator,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:16:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, I appreciate it. I have wondered and considered making a thread here asking if changing personality types is possible? Sometimes I when I break things down to their simplist form, everything is a yes or no, do this or don't. If I just do, instead of not doing, trying to ignore all the other chatter, then I should get results, right? I am trying to take more chances, and take my opportunities when they come, but it is so exhausting being social and I feel like I'm wearing a mask the whole time which is effort. How do you tailor your life, for example? Fear does prevent me doing a lot of things, especially when I'm on my own doing them."
infj,3al5r0,Paragonight,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:25:26 2015 UTC,"Always welcome! I recognize what you say and the troubling part is that at best it seems like one is facing a constant dilemma. On top of that we have to throw in our own personal preferences, and attempt to match it to the best of our ability with everything else in the world that we need to interact with. I actually do enjoy many activities with others, in fact I even prefer in comparison to doing alone, and vice versa when it comes to other things.  Overcoming fear I'm certain has multiple approaches, typically it would be suggested to face it. The scary part to others is that what we may fear, could be something that is considered a fairly easy and simple task, yet for whatever reason it just impedes us greatly to act. This can be difficult for others to understand, and depending on what options you do have available it can become even more complex. Ideally if one can find another person, be it friend or partner, who does exhibit compassion and ability to understand of your struggles, then you will be a bit better off. Again to circle back around a bit, this in itself is a task that is very taxing in itself, when one find it so draining to interact and maintain all these standards that are typically expected of you. That said it is not impossible, but it does present a very real issue that I'm not really sure how we as society get better at dealing with. Everything we do is a time investment and it is our most valuable resource, so we are careful who and what we spend it on.  On a very unrealistic level I do sincerely wish I could be there for a good many people, because despite only having been a brief time on this planet, I do feel I've experienced most of the positive emotions one will encounter in a lifetime, and I would want anyone to feel that kind of comfort and peace.  At the end of the day, I typically end up asking myself the same question when I'm faced with any sort of challenge or otherwise important issue. ""Am I happy and content being where I am?"" If the answer is No, then I need to change things. This may sound like a simple question and by all means I know everything is a lot more complex. Even so I do believe that it's something that many people perhaps overlook with their own life. I see people that keep dreading around the same situation and people, who they could leave or at the very least decrease their time with, but something in them makes them be stuck in the rot. I don't like being in a situation where I'm not content, so that's why I believe even if it will be challenging, we should all look for the inspiration and drive, to somehow get us to wherever it is we need to be. Some people can do that by themselves, others need professional help, there is no shame in any of the paths we take. I just know that once I get old one day and I'm at the end of my time on this planet, I want to be able to reflect back on my life and feel like it was all worth living. I already feel by now I've had some of the most powerful experienced that one can achieve in this life, and if this is not the case for you or others reading this, then I would encourage them to do anything possible to make it happen. Each day is a gift, even if many find themselves in dreary circumstances.  One last thing I will say is that, I very much believe the key/lucky part for me is that I tend to consider my mind for strong. Where I see other give up, give in or simply have no desire to put in an effort, my motor kicks into overdrive as I want to do what I set my mind to. For better or worse, I typically don't stop until I've achieved it. Hope you can find some inner strength and overcome your fears, I have been lucky meeting someone years ago who made me open up even more, and the same is possible for you and anyone else. That is most certainly why I very much love kindness in general, that is something that will always warm my heart."

Now it's like I can socialise on the face of things fine, but it's never deep enough to satisfy and I know these people can't be on that level.

infj,3akjts,dezbah,11,Sun Jun 21 02:41:15 2015 UTC,"I feel this hard. My friends tell me I'm a strong person too, and I also have really low self-esteem. They don't have to be mutually exclusive, haha. Having times where your self-esteem falls really low counts as hard times too, and getting through those can only make you stronger. But in the here and now, it sucks a lot. I find that thinking of things I should be grateful for can sometimes make it worse, because I tend to feel guilty easily and beat myself up for not being appreciative enough. That just makes me spiral more quickly, and it's not productive or helpful for me at all. It can be really hard to get up and do something in these times, but I found that practicing my hobbies can help me feel a little better because it's something I enjoy and I also feel like I'm good at it, plus if it's something that requires a lot of concentration, it can distract me from the negative thoughts. Even if it's not a hobby, just occupying my mind and/or body with something can help me feel accomplished, which can get my self-esteem up a bit and distract me for a while- something like cleaning, doing the dishes, organizing, writing letters to a friend, etc. And then after I finish and feel accomplished, I also like to treat myself to something like you mentioned, like nice food or something.   I find that just treating myself or talking it out doesn't help as much with self-esteem. Thinking. ""Okay, I'm worth something"" is really hard, even if it's true and everyone can see it but you. It really takes a lot of effort from the inside to change a belief that has been there for years. I also find it really difficult to take a leap of faith and just believe- I have to have something tactile to help me believe, which is why I find that combining changing my thought process with activities that make me feel good about myself (not just feel good, like buying a new pair of shoes or eating chocolate, but good about myself! For me that would be like maybe putting on makeup, taking the dog for a walk, vacuuming, etc), so that I have tangible results that my mind can latch onto while trying to challenge the thought that I'm worthless, useless, etc.  Take small steps and remember to keep your support network close by (: Best of luck!"

That hole of negative thinking will consume me and spiral into a deep depression. I've done it too many times.  Something like my first break up felt like the worst thing imaginable. Just when I think I've been through my worst, I get into a new, more intimate, relationship and fall into an even worst depression when that ends.   Okay, that's common. Just when I pick myself up and get a great job and feel good again, I lose that job and move far away from my friends. Then I pick myself up, make new friends and just when things are perfect I find myself in a coma for 2 months, completely immobile and vulnerable in every possible way. The depression gets worst and worst. I keep zero contact with all friends, old and new. I resent everyone for not being able to help me (I can only help myself). It's just rock bottom.  It's actualy not... it can get worst. I get into crippling debt, fall in love again, become co-dependant, feel equally needed, and get dropped in another instant. Another break up.  This is a cycle of life that can happen. At any age, any situation.  I am a college graduate. I was in a fraternity. I had lots of adventures that can give me endless amounts of conversation. There will always be bad that can come with the good.  We can't stop the roller coaster that is life. It can bring us great friends, it can give us bad health. Timing can place us in the perfect job, or a crappy one.  Currently I'm incredibly happy. I feel blessed that I'm even alive, and that I have a second shot at life. I'm alone, still in debt, and with family problems. But I have  great job that gives me purpose. I have fun friends. I have activities to look forward to.  Self esteem is a personal thing. I can work out to feel it, I can have a great conversation with someone new to feel it. I can buy a new shirt and feel it. An old friend can bring up a past memory. I can play a nostalgic game. I can go through old photos. All of these trivial things can help.  Find what works for you. Journal. Make new friends. Pick up a new hobby. Find a good song. Make music or art. Take a random class.

You know all the reasons why the situation shouldn't affect your outlook on life and your view of yourself, yet you keep feeling like crap, which only makes you feel worse about yourself, because someone who's as smart and strong as you supposedly are shouldn't be so out of control of her feelings, right? I think we INFJs are truly gifted at beating ourselves up.  Here's what I've done recently that has helped with my self-confidence:    I've taken a couple of classes. One was on performing well under pressure, and I walked out of that one feeling like I'd learned something useful and contributed a lot to the group. It was a great psychological boost.  I've talked with a therapist whose opinion I respect who keeps gently telling me that I'm very hard on myself.  I try to remind myself as often as possible about recent times when someone outside my close circle has spontaneously shown affection or friendship toward me (when I'm really down, thinking of my nearest and dearest tends to make me feel guilty or angry).  I immerse myself in an activity I'm not good at, because any sign of improvement feels like a win.  I pick up a book that engages my mind. (I'd recommend The Practicing Mind, which talks about how everything we do is practice of one type or another, and how we often feel as if we're failing when in fact we're learning.)    Maybe some of those ideas will help you. It helped me to write them out.   As a side note, there was a recent link on this sub to a piece about how Fi is expressed in INFJs. I can't look it up without losing what I've typed so far, but the piece talks about how deeply we feel things and how poisonous that can become if we don't find an outlet for those feelings.

infj,3akjts,OneYearSteakDay,3,Sun Jun 21 08:40:09 2015 UTC,"So here's the deal: You can't think yourself confident.  It's that simple.    What you CAN do it take actions and get engaged in tasks that justify being confident in yourself.    Here's what I mean: Say I tell myself all day, every day, that I am confident in my ability to repair washing machines.  Twenty four hours a day, seven days a week I'm telling myself ""I am good a repairing washing machines, I am confident in my ability to repair washing machines, I am a good washing machine repair man.""  Fast-forward to the day that someone asks me to repair their washing machine and I fail miserably, my self esteem is shattered, my self confidence is gone, fuck washing machines and fuck me too.     I was confident in my ability to repair washing machines, so why did I fail?  Here we tend to assign blame to ourselves: ""I couldn't repair the washing machine because I suck, I'm bad with tools, I'll never be good enough to fix things, I should just go sit in a corner so I don't do any more damage to anything else.""  We blame ourselves for the failure when we never really took the time to learn to succeed.    Now lets rewind all the way back to the beginning: What if, instead of telling myself that I'm confident in my ability to repair washing machines, I took the time to learn to repair washing machines?  Now I'm in a scenario where I may not be confident, but I am becoming competent.  Twenty four hours a day, seven days a week I work towards being competent in my ability to repair washing machines.  So one day my mom asks me ""Hey, can you fix this thing?""  Hell yeah I can!  I fix that sucker right up and... I'm more confident.    I have proven to myself that I am competent, which in turn makes me more confident, which in turn makes me more competent and the cycle repeats.    TL;DR: Don't try to make yourself confident, prove to yourself that you have a reason to be confident.    TL;DR2: Competence does more for confidence than confidence does for competence.    TL;DR3: Fake it 'till you make it is spectacularly effective in the mean time."
infj,3akjts,mcsilly2009,3,Sun Jun 21 11:51:31 2015 UTC,"I (male INFJ) have struggled with career related self-esteem for years despite having the trappings of success. Career and personal life are different, but low self-esteem often has a single cause that radiates into different areas of life.  One thing I have struggled with is persistence in finding something that helps me build my confidence. I jump around a lot and often quickly abandon things. I read a lot of books sometimes, exercise sometimes, take up art sometimes, and so on. Jumping around a lot is sub-optimal because I usually don't feel like I've accomplished much but it's better than wallowing in self-pity. If there is something you are passionate about, then focus on that. If there is not, I might suggest you take up a high intensity exercise routine. Exercise will not solve the root cause of your self-esteem challenges, but it is the best ""here and now"" solution that I am aware of. When I am exercising intensely (primarily weight lifting, basketball, sometimes running), my mind clears and often stays clear for hours afterwards. That period of clarity can give you head space to think more rationally about yourself and your self-worth. On top of that, you will get more fit, sleep better, improve your metabolism, perhaps lose unwanted excess weight, prevent disease onset, and so much more.   I exercise 6 times a week for an hour or more each day. It takes a lot of time and a good amount of discipline, but it's been one of the best things I've done to help fight my depression. I plan to make exercise and good diet priorities for the rest of my life. Find a routine that works for you, and do your very best to do it. Try to learn to love it so it doesn't feel like a chore. Get creative and research how to do it better. Do it alone and with friends.   If you are too exhausted or depressed to exercise, try to find a therapist ASAP.   I wish you the best, and even though I don't know you, my best thoughts are with you."
infj,3akjts,BirdsMilkCake,2,Mon Jun 22 05:59:34 2015 UTC,"Another ""strong person"" here with low self esteem. Right now I am focusing on what ""sparks joy"" or makes me happy, and disregarding the negative feedback I normally give myself. It's not easy though, and I worry that I will wear my closest friend out by relying on him so much. But I don't want you to feel alone in this.   I would say find something that nurtures you and gives you joy, like walking a dog, doing a daily yoga practice, meditation or (what I do) give yourself a mini spa experience every weekend. Sometimes when I am down on myself (looks, intelligence, whatever) the best thing to do is to ground myself in my body and really truly experience whatever my senses are telling me in that moment. IDK if that makes sense, but it works for me because my body is a lot more forgiving than my mind is."
infj,3akjts,TheQuietudeAbides,2,Mon Jun 22 03:51:42 2015 UTC,"Whenever this happens to me (even without a breakup - I've been married 2 years and still have low self-esteem and struggle with depression), and whenever it gets really bad, I always end up seeking validation from others and then not believing it when they provide it. But here are some important things to remember:  You are not selfish for asking for help! Nobody makes it through this world alone. No one. All of us humans need each other. You are doing yourself a big favor and demonstrating self-respect, not selfishness, by asking for help. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  You are human. Every human being has an emotional core that needs care, and sometimes we just need to regress into childhood and let others care for us. Sometimes that is the healthiest thing.  And because you have this emotional core of humanity, you are worthwhile and beautiful. You are. Yes, you are."
infj,3akjts,Pixie79,2,Tue Jun 23 16:38:26 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you're feeling so down. It's perfectly normal to have periods in your life where you just feel completely and utterly depressed.   Do you feel down primarily because of your unrequited love for your friend? Have you tried telling him how you feel? Or are you 100% certain he will not be interested in you? Rest assured, no matter how beautiful, intelligent, witty, funny, sweet, kind, etc you are, there will ALWAYS be people who aren't interested in you. This is how life is! The trick is finding a person that is as crazy for you as you are for them (it does happen!! and is very worth the wait!) In the meantime, just continue doing things that are GOOD for you - sleep enough, eat healthy, exercise, keep learning new things (take up a new hobby, music, dance, etc), and best of all, try helping others (volunteering at a shelter, working with habitat for humanity, being a mentor to a child) - I find that when you focus on doing good for others it really lifts your spirits in ways that nothing else can. I wish you the best and please rest assured that these valleys in life do not last forever! /hugs"

If he seems interested (or even more scared than you) then go over and say hi. If you end up getting along then share some contact info and you'll at least have a friend to hang out with, and more importantly to introduce you to his friends who may be closer to what you're really looking for. I'm sure there's tons of stuff going on all over NYC, especially around NYU.  Good luck! I know this is all easier said than done.

I have ESTJ kids that freak the hell out come finals, and the very few INFJs I have scooch by just fine.    Basically... just breathe, go in knowing you're not ""the only one who is dealing with anxiety"" and let yourself and college find each other.  There'll be some ups and downs... there'll be people you meet that will be life long friends, and there'll be that roommate you hate (I'm 42... been out of college for a while, still friends with folks from college).    Now for some INFJ stuff... College, for me, was something else awesome.  I struggled a bit here and there, but compared to high school? Oh man, college was great because guess what? you meet other like minded people (this is not necessarily INFJs) who become great friends.    Classes (after your freshman year) are awesome.  You get professors that really, really give a damn (and some that don't... I happen to give a damn).  You get to try on your ""Adult pants"" too and it's fun... sometimes it sucks, but it's fun over all.    Til this day, I am extremely thankful for my four years in college (And 2 in grad school...although that was just me doing research).

infj,3ajktl,joantheunicorn,3,Sat Jun 20 22:37:23 2015 UTC,"I graduated from a liberal arts college in 2014. Here are my thoughts a year out:  If you want to stay grounded in college, remember that it will end and you'll still be the same person on a fundamental level. Growth happens in our lives, emotional tendencies overtake other aspects of our character as they ebb and flow, but nothing ever goes away. You'll have the same past, the same family, the same origins and roots, and all the same psychodramas. College is an easy way to forget all that for four years, which is why it can be a shock to graduate only to see that you've spent your early twenties imagining you've become part of a community that will last forever because how could one live out such intense, shared experiences with others in a secure, stimulating environment if it's not ""true."" But it will go away, and the illusory security you found in that world—anxiety-inducing or alienating or challenging or painful or joyous as it may have been—is always torn away from you in the end.   Beware forsaking whatever hobbies, interests and relationships you had in high school in the service of your ""new identity"" even if you feel you're ""changing"" or ""evolving"" or ""maturing."" When I went to college 2000 miles away from home, I stopped talking to my high school friends because I had at last found ""my people"" or ""people who were on my level."" I regret that decision. I also stopped playing music after 7 years of participation in band and choir, my perpetual excuse being ""schoolwork then friends then career bullshit then fifty more steps ahead of where I'm at right now."" In my four years at college I felt I didn't have time to live because I was systematically prioritizing everything that had to do with securing the regard of others, whether they were professors or friends. Fight for your hobbies, interests, and deep commitments. Carve out space for your life, and cultivate who you are beyond your identity as a student and friend. Don't graduate and find that all you're left with is what you had before college, and that for four years you've been neglecting these things from your ""past"" while you were being a student. If I could go back I would have gone for a lighter course load and given less than my all to my schoolwork so I could have found time for music. In the writer Joan Didion's words, don't put yourself in a situation where you ""run away to find [yourself]"" only to find nothing:  ""To assign unanswered letters their proper weight, to free us from the expectations of others, to give us back to ourselves — there lies the great, the singular power of self-respect. Without it, one eventually discovers the final turn of the screw: one runs away to find oneself, and finds no one at home."" —On Self-Respect  Take advantage of on-campus counseling resources. After college you'll never again be able to access therapy quite as easily so take advantage of it for the sake of your own personal growth! Taking steps towards dealing with any ""unfinished business"" you may have from your past can only help you both in the present and future, and in your early twenties could make all the difference in your unique, lifelong effort to live authentically and meaningfully."
infj,3ajktl,Kyrmana,2,Sat Jun 20 22:36:28 2015 UTC,"Wow, your music point really hit me. I stuck with my university orchestra right up until my student teaching. I wish I would have picked it up again after college. :("
infj,3ajktl,Kyrmana,3,Sun Jun 21 01:30:03 2015 UTC,"A) I'm a senior right now. B) Honestly, took me two years before I really started socializing in school. I remember my freshman year, I would just go to class and walk out... and that pretty much sums my entire day. It did help that I worked and I made friends at work, so that was the sum of my social life. I moved out after my freshman year and lived by myself for some parts of my sophomore year before I started dorming my junior year. That's when I had to learn to open myself up to people more (regardless of whether or not I liked it or them, for that matter). I'm not a party person and thank God, I lived at a dorm where everyone wasn't into that stuff too (it was a Christian off-campus dorm so go figure). So all of my friends were cool, steady people who knew how to have fun without getting into stupid trouble or drama.   Because of my dorming experience, I actually have an easier time talking to people in class. I became a lot closer to my peers in my major... sadly, most of them graduated because I'm a year ahead of my class and I took my capstone with the seniors while I was a junior. But it's opened me up to explore different classes. I'm starting my Art minor this coming semester as a senior so I'm honestly just stoked to venture into a different schpeel of learning and meet different people along the way.   Academically, just have fun and really try to get something out of each class. You'll find that some professors are really terrible and some are great and wonderful. Those wonderful professors... build a relationship with them (professionally of course). Ask them questions and really learn from them, because the professors I had who were just brilliant and open ended up being the ones who gave me fantastic letters of recommendations for jobs and scholarships.   Even if you don't find yourself socializing so much, I think it's important to build a solid network during college. Internships are a lot of fun, you get experience, you make friends, and it's a good resume builder.   Good luck though! Just be yourself. :) There are other introverts and INFJs out there who are going through the same."
infj,3ajktl,s0yj0y,2,Sun Jun 21 00:28:39 2015 UTC,"Overall I enjoyed college. I got to live by my night owl nature, choose which classes I wanted to take....for the most part. I found organizations with like minded people and did some volunteering. I was able to complete my classes and hold down a job or two which kept me nice and busy. In retrospect I don't know how I did it. I made time for some partying too.  I did not enjoy dorm life - too much like high school with drama and everyone dating and sleeping together and partying. I was there to get actual work done. I did much better living with a friend and also ended up moving back with my parents which saved me thousands, if not tens of thousands in student loans.   If you change majors, it is NOT a big deal. People will act like its the end of the world. You will be fine. I would encourage people your age to especially watch your finances as FAFSA loans and such can be lingering in your life for decades. I am 33 and still paying on my loans, unfortunately, even working full time. Hopefully one of them will be paid off in the next 12 months! Taking out loans is something to think long and hard about....if you can work at all and pay even some as you go, it will save you a ton in interest years down the road."

As for college itself: I've chosen a subject that attracts many introverts (media informatics) and for the most part it felt like school without having to speak up all the time for good grades. Lot's of practical tasks because it is a ""Hochschule"", not ""Universität"" (idk how it is in your country) and neither the college itself, nor the city are that large.

It was great when I had at least one friend in a class that I could sit with and study with. It helps to know someone when you need a partner or need to do a group project. Its also good to have a way to escape stress. I wrote poetry and played guitar. If you are able to, take at least one class a term that is for fun. I always tried to sign up for exercise classes to help keep me healthy and it is also a great way to relieve stress."
infj,3ajktl,BirdsMilkCake,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:14:23 2015 UTC,Thank you for the advice. I have a few questions for you. Did you befriend any of the extrovert trying to reach out to you? Did any of them end up being your good friends  Also what did you do for meals? Especially in the beginning of college.  Were you Sitting alone etc
infj,3ajktl,jeff233,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:26:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, I made friends with just about everyone that wanted to hang out. While living in the dorms, I ate at the dining center. When I lived off campus, I cooked my own meals. Since college ended, I didn't keep in touch with many of my college friends because most people moved away, but it was nice to have people to study with and go out with once I was 21. I have to say, extroverts are the easiest people to stay friends with as long as they are understanding of your need for alone time. Just try to say yes to invites and get out of your comfort zone."
infj,3ajktl,SaucyKitty,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:43:57 2015 UTC,"I went to college.  Academically, what is your major? I loved my major, and so academically, it didn't feel crazy. I loved what I was studying, and that made it feel less like work, despite long hours.  Socially: try to push yourself to get out. My first semester of freshman year I was like a hermit. I went to class, went back to my room. Hid. By the time I got to junior year I had come out of my shell a bit and found people I really enjoyed being around, and I wish I had pushed myself to get out more, sooner. As an introvert, I'm often one to shy away from seeking groups and outings.... But I can tell you that now being out of school for a few years... I miss the social aspect. I wish I had taken advantage of being around other people that were at the same point in their life as I was. I wish I had done more. Been MORE involved. So try to push yourself to do that, even when you don't feel like it. I missed out on a lot of opportunities (I feel) because of my desire to be alone. Which we need on occasion. But we also should use the experience to challenge ourselves.  Good luck. College is great, but it's also what you make of it. My first semester I was crying and wanting to leave, but then, by the end of the second, it was home, and my friends were my family."

infj,3aj2ih,Bane_of_Minorities,9,Sat Jun 20 17:59:57 2015 UTC,"I spend a good portion of most days by myself. Although I'm often solitary, I'm never lonely. This might sound strange, but I think it's partially because I carry around a good facsimile of everyone I know in my head. Besides all of the other things I think about, I can easily have a conversation with anyone I know, even if just pretend, and it feels like the real thing. I do genuinely love spending time with my nearest and dearest though."

I'm not interested sex.  I've actually started to be annoyed by feelings of sexual desire.  The only reason I would want to have sex with someone would be to further the emotional connection in a relationship.  I figure if there comes a day when I feel the need/desire for a relationship, I'll pursue one.  Until then, I'll be happy as I am."

They often have a ton of energy and will try to test their boundaries as a rebellious teen might. I would suggest adopting an adult dog or cat as an alternative. They can be just as loving and loyal, but have already been through their 'crazy' phases. Their personalities will already be fully developed as well; you can see them as they are when you go to adopt."

infj,3aj2ih,Sephirona,3,Sun Jun 21 03:26:09 2015 UTC,"Lately I've been in great need of alone time. In fact, I went as far as cancelling my cellphone and using only facebook and my landline to communicate. Not only that but I also didn't get a bus card this month and have been using exclusively my bicycle to commute. This is great because I can just turn down invitations if I claim I am too tired to go out. Note that this was partially economically motivated.   I don't mind spending days on end alone but sometimes I feel like I could go crazy if I don't talk at all. But I'm not really demanding to fill this void. Making a few posts on reddit is enough for me.   (P.S.: There's been a lot of posts lately about INFJ's overusing their Fe or asking about other people's alone time lately. I wonder if we're all related by some mystical force preceding our existence.)"
infj,3aj2ih,CherryDaBomb,3,Sat Jun 20 23:21:26 2015 UTC,"I'm almost always alone at home, and I'm pretty happy about it. It gives me a lot of time to do my own thing and reflect on subjects and concepts that interest me. I've never felt lonely being alone, but perhaps that has something to do with the fact that I'm very happy with most of the online communities I'm a part of and can connect with people through that? Like others have mentioned, while a relationship would be nice with the right person it would also need to be with a person who really understands my desire to be alone for long periods of time. Plus, they should be honest, interested in bouncing ideas back and forth, all that jazz. But it's also nothing I haven't been able to find in friends online (with the exception of the physical aspect) so I suppose that's why I'm not really in a rush.   I can be very talkative, animated, and happy around the right people irl, but I do end up quiet and sleepy after a while when I get tired of it and become somewhat like a flattened basketball. ovo"
infj,3aj2ih,bensyc,3,Sun Jun 21 03:52:35 2015 UTC,"Well, I'll break the circle and say I'm alone far more than I like. I do live with my boyfriend, and that's nice, but he's an extreme introvert and I feel a little too clingy with the amount of attention I like. Unfortunately he's the only one around right now, so it's a struggle.   In general, I never really ""prefer"" to be alone. If the choice is between going somewhere with friends or going to that place alone, I'd almost always rather have friends. It's only the people who aren't in my circle that drain me. Maybe I'm not an introvert, but it's what has always come up, as long as I can remember. But going back to the choice, if I know my friends won't appreciate the event, I'm happy going by myself. I'm not afraid to be alone, but if I can bring people who will be a pleasure to be around, I'd rather do that."

But to be honest, my life feels totally empty and I feel very, very alone. I wish I could be like y'all and feel happy with my loneliness, but I feel pathetic and worthless.

I visit my parents about every other week, and we don't talk otherwise. Its how I grew up, and it's how I have stayed. I completely enjoy being in control of every aspect of my life, being independent and solitary. But at the same time I want to socialize, but can't force myself to, let alone trying to date. I want to be in a relationship so bad, but I can't seem to let go of my independence :( I could easily live the rest of my life alone, I am satisfied with the smaller things in life, and I have more than enough hobbies to keep me busy.

While some may find it boring, there can be advantages to having a friend whom feels similar and doesn't mind just being quietly around each other. Although even this may be draining, if one feels the need and obligation to entertain the person they spend time with, but it is entirely possible even if perhaps a bit more rare."
infj,3ait3v,Paragonight,2,Sat Jun 20 17:05:40 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  It happened to me before I was even self aware. I would see people constantly and after a while just get sick of them.

It's weirdly just as important as spending quality time with people I love (friends, family or if I'm in a relationship).  Solitude is invaluable!"

I try to be gentle, and I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings if they've been considerate and civil as well, but I think it's our right to be able to voice our thoughts and bring in new information, too. With luck I'll find myself in an environment where disagreements are for the sake of improving everyone's knowledge of the subject and where being wrong is understood to not be a reflection on someone's character  or intelligence (it's also super annoying when people resort to angry ad hominems to try to make up for their lack of a point). If it's some random stranger who butts in making rude remarks that don't add to anything, though...I can be pretty curt."

If needed, I'll usually take the short cut and just ignore their stupidity (which is often the case with my friends)... OR, if it's actually a valid opinion, just accept that there are differences in the world. I say stupidity because more often than not I'm getting a whole lot of non-sense from people who just like to debate. They'll circle around or even change their original point for the sake of sounding right. To me that's just annoying. But of course there are exceptions.  I like learning what makes people tick. So I try to find the beauty in what motivates a person to think the way they do, or hold such a strong personal opinion.

infj,3akqdd,nyctanthous,2,Mon Jun 22 02:29:13 2015 UTC,Before I was conflict averse because I did not have a strong enough opinion to support my stance. I was too afraid of offending the other person. I did some self-reflecting and realized that maybe I was too easily offended and I would apply that logic to others.  Now when someone disagrees with me I try to understand their point. I let my curiosity run wild. I question their perspective and use rationale (Ti) to combat their ideas in a way that they can understand (Fe). I'm also confident in my own perspective because I understand what my values are and I know that it's okay if someone disagrees with me. You're more respected when you have your own thoughts regardless of agreement. Usually if their opinion is blatantly illogical I use comical sarcasm to combat in hopes they can see just how ridiculous they are. A cool person who knows what they're talking about can take it very well. Someone who doesn't and takes it to offense triggers my Fe to comfort them.  A well-balanced Fe-Ti can rock the boat and stop the boat.

Honestly I wouldn't have survived probably if my istj mother wasn't a math teacher and could hold my hand through the whole thing ha.  I got decent grades (I think it ended up being like a A- or a B+). My advice would be to not expect to learn the processes of HOW each problem gets its answer (I.e. Gaussian elimination) , but at least try and pick up the patterns of how to solve them (I.e. Okay these numbers are multiplied together and the answer is divided by 2).  Infjs are good at systematizing, so just work your problems in the way that makes sense and you'll find yourself getting them right more often than you think. Also, khan academy as some great videos for harder topics."

I can also be prone to making ""dumb"" mistakes in forgetting obvious steps and the like.  My advice:   Practice, practice, practice.  This is the single biggest thing that took me from struggling with homework problems to being able to just do  homework problems that consisted of pages of algebra and calculus problems. Flashcards.  Use flashcards to quiz yourself on definitions of logarithms, trig functions, etc.  I did this for my PhD written exams and it helped my recall tremendously.  I wish I had done it sooner in my studies.   Take your time with homework problems and check your work.   Work on homework problems in a group.  I did this all through my later undergrad and all my grad classes and it was an importance piece of the process for me.  This one may or may not apply to you: I eventually found out through some neuropsychological testing (IQ and the like) that my ""processing speed"" is delayed relative to the rest of my cognitive function.  This means that I should have been getting extra time to do my tests all along, which would have helped with all the dumb mistakes I made when trying to rush during timed tests.  Unfortunately, I found out too late in my studies to do anything about it.  On the other hand, it really helped me contextualize my struggles with testing and resulting average/poor grades and helped me stop feeling like an idiot.  If you have the resources to get some testing, it MIGHT help you, but again, this may be irrelevant to your situation.   Good luck and feel free to PM me or ask questions."

I second study groups- but in groups where we agreed to ""work on the homework together,"" I usually came with the assignment already completed and then double-checked answers with people and explained myself to whoever was lost. You learn things FASTER and MORE THOROUGHLY when you explain them to someone else. Additionally, I noticed the 'people-pleaser' part of me that wanted to help everyone else took precedence over my tendencies to procrastinate.   Taking your time with your work like they said will help you feel much less anxious in your classes. The perfectionist part of me caused me to procrastinate A TON in undergrad. I'd say to myself ""I really don't want to do this. I'm just going to screw up anyway.""  The main way I overcame that was by starting assignments way ahead of time so I could ask questions in OH if I was ever unsure and going to study groups (like discussed above). This is SUPER important in your first-year classes so you can build a strong foundation of knowledge pertaining to your major.   Once I got to higher-level chemistry courses I didn't need to go to OH as much because I could google most of my questions and ""logic out"" the rest. But it requires a strong foundation, which you are MORE than capable of building if you put in the time. Don't lose heart and good luck~ :D"
infj,3ak55v,Cindifrid,2,Mon Jun 22 00:14:12 2015 UTC,"Hi. I used to be ok at math bit it pissed a lot of my math teachers off because I wouldn't do it thier long add boring conveluded way.  I am a silly INFJ that got into operating things on the engineering side of the world.   What helped me with math was dissecting formulas, running them backwards and then programming that stuff to automate. When you make a program to do an equation  you really get to learn it inside and out because you touch every part of the formula.  I know a lot of places say INFJs need artsy type jobs.  Technical jobs can work for INFJs given they have some freedom to refine how they do things as long as the results are good.    INFJs need a creative outlet and we are very good troubleshooters and very good consultants and can find optimal meathods of doing things.  I had difficulty with my math teachers because all the extra fluff and excessive steps. I was routinely marked down because I found the answer quicker and more efficient. I contribute this to my abandonment of further math and still have a disgust knee jerk reaction to forcing myself to do meaningless mundane problems that ill never use.   The bottom line is beyond certifications no one gives a shit. On the job when you make real money no one cares how you came to the answer as long as the answer is right and you are within whatever regulations you have to follow.    INFJs might not be human Xeroxes what it comes to technical crap but we sure can understand many pieces if a problem taking in info from all over to efficiently solve complex issues. That makes us valuable in any engineering.  Many see us as negative. We are not negative so much as we are the people of potential.  We are not ""Yes men"". We are the ""what if"" and ""why not"".  The engineering community is not used to this as many are black and white cut and dry personalities. They just do what they know and don't innovate much.  The companies that come out with breakthrough processes and products listen to thier visionary INFJs.  I have an honors degree in networking.  I was a systems admin. I operated a handful of engineering plants. What I do effects the health and safety of a lot of people. That gives me pride. It can be done. You might not have the highest scores technically. It might take a bit more time, but a cert is a cert and a degree is a degree.  If you take some time outside to break these things down.. maybe incorporate it into something just for yourself. Just to check yourself I think your scores will improve.   Stay curious."
infj,3ak55v,EvilPhd666,2,Sun Jun 21 05:27:36 2015 UTC,"I found that if I made an effort to include all the units in my calculations and writing out each step in the equation it helps to makes sense of things. Taking the long road at first to see how units cancel out and how the equation changes with each calculation helps it to become more instinctive.   I love math,  once you figure it out it is extremely predictable."
infj,3ak55v,6the6bull6,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:26:35 2015 UTC,"I was in the same position as you last fall! Like you, I often miss details and make really obvious mistakes in math. I also had to relearn a ton of really basic mathematics concepts that I'd forgotten, plus I've always been anxious about math in general, so it was a terrifying first few weeks. Unlike with other subjects, where reading a passage a few times allows me to grasp the concept, it's not enough for me to just read about calc - I need to be exposed to lots and lots of similar problems of varying difficulty to remember how to do them without references. Easier problems so I don't feel like a hopeless wreck, and harder problems so I learn more and am prepared for what comes my way on tests. I was lucky in that my father is very good at math and has to do a lot of it for his job, so I would go to him for pointers when I got stuck or couldn't remember a (basic =_+;;;) concept.  One thing I've always been told no matter where I am in math is ""practice."" It's definitely important to familiarize yourself with multiple ""mathematical"" scenarios that come about. Eventually, after familiarizing yourself with multiple problems in one section, you start to develop an understanding of how calc relates to the more elementary subjects you learned in the past, and that's a pretty satisfying feeling. Dealing with logs/lns becomes easier once you get used to recognizing the kind of problems that need to be derived with them, and that can only come with practice. Afterwards, it's just about being extremely careful to pay attention to each step you write so you don't overlook something small. It's very hard work, and I don't think I'd have gotten an A if it weren't for the class curves and the fact that my teacher saw I was working my butt off out of terror, but you can do it! I'll be sending good vibes your way. \o/"
infj,3ak55v,Sephirona,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:31:18 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of good advice on here.  I have some suggestions for conceptualization.    As an INFJ, I find that remembering narratives/concepts is much more intuitive than remembering ""random"" facts or formulas. It is a must to understand the concepts (how we did we get to this formula?). I rarely ever memorized formulas, since I could pretty much derive it when I had to use it (not all that efficient, but every time I derived it, I ended up memorizing it naturally). It helps to read a bit into the mathematician and their thought processes during their discovery (their objective, their previous failed formulas and why). This helps build perspective / context and will help you understand the essence / limitations / assumptions of the formula. As a result, you'll be much more fluid and creative in solving problems.  Also, don't forget to search up examples & applications. Find out how it ties into the real world! I can't stress this enough. If you see how it relates to  the world around us, it might earn a bit more of your respect and appreciation lol. I explore math / statistics like a kid in awe. Make sure you bring out that inner curiosity. Run through the examples as if you were telling or being told a story, it will stick. Personify formulas, concepts, problems.  Side note: if you get really into this, it can be time-consuming and lots of fun. Make sure to budget your time accordingly & don't get too carried away lol.  For really abstract ideas, if you have a problem concentrating or understanding, it might be helpful to think about it with eyes closed (sometimes relaxing on my back, I find it also helps imagination run even freer). I suspect this works because of inferior Se. When I have my eyes opened, I'm getting visual sensory input, and it probably drains some of my energy without even knowing. Hence, I tend to get frustrated much quicker.  It's also nice to just close your eyes and breathe deeply when you need a break.    (I majored in Statistics.)"

I don't have great advice since it usually just clicked for me but hang in there and tutors are readily available. Don't be afraid to ask for help either. I have plenty of times.

For example, I tested into precalculus, but I started with beginning algebra, followed by intermediate algebra to fill in any gaps so I wouldn't struggle as much.  Also, ratemyprofessors.com is an excellent website where you can look up professors at your local college, by subject, and read what other people had to say about them. It'll help you pick professors that you're sure to get along with without getting stressed from class.  Good luck :) You'll do great"

infj,3afgvy,beeman4266,7,Fri Jun 19 18:26:21 2015 UTC,"I'm an INFJ 20 year old female and I totally relate. My grandpa just died, I just returned from the U.K. to the US, and started another school class for summer. Honestly, when I get into the kind of mood that you are in, it is when I start adding up all the details into one whole instead of keeping the details separate from each other. I FREAK OUT when I have to deal with more than one big issue at a time. I simply can't do it. These past few weeks, dealing with so many things, I became a lot more depressed, hating everyone, feeling helpless, etc. But how fast can you switch out of your moods? I think the thing that helped me most is telling myself that my bad mood won't last forever, and being able to add a positive voice to my head besides the negative one that constantly lurks below the surface.  I constantly feel like I am giving and giving. I've never had a relationship, and I desperately want to give my love to someone, because giving is exactly what I know how to do, appreciate doing for the ones I love.  On the note of listening to people... My mom drives me up the wall with her ESFJ self. She talks constantly of her complaints, and I just have to sit there. If I talk to anyone, it is I that meshes with their self, not them meshing with me. And also like you, my best friend is my everything. Only around her do I feel like I am truly myself, unburdened by anything.  You know what I think my biggest problem is? It could also apply to you. We need to speak up more. Yes, it is the nice and right and natural way for INFJs to be so giving and great to people, but I think we need to sometimes fight against this and speak up for ourselves, no matter if it will hurt the other person. Something another INFJ told me after I posted something like this online is that our ""self"" matters just as much as another's ""self."" We shouldn't have to sacrifice our happiness for another's. I think there is a good balance that could be found between being giving and standing up for yourself. It's not that we can't stand up for ourselves, its that we choose not to out of the kindness of our hearts, and that aversion to conflict. The only way to grow is to change, I suppose."
infj,3afgvy,phaedrablair,3,Fri Jun 19 20:43:39 2015 UTC,"Wow this actually rang true to describing what I deal with and how my brain works incredibly well.. Firstly, sorry for your loss, its been a while since I've lost someone close so I can only try to empathize with what it might be that you're going through.  The details all adding together is so true when I feel stressed.. I package everything together in a box and remind myself of said box consistently throughout the day go remind myself not to let go to much, in fear ill forget what I have to do. Responsibility such as a relationship scares the hell out of me, hence why, like you, I've never been in one. I just don't feel comfortable giving myself to someone knowing how I feel changes moment by moment, person to person...  It's a cycle though, I get angry and stressed because I'm around too many people throughout the day so I take it and take it, only letting our small hints that im upset or frustrated, only to blow up in one instance over something small and inanimate. You're right about the never speaking up thing.. I never let the people I'm mad at know I'm upset because it would detach myself from what I've tried so hard to cultivate.. An objective point of view that isn't affected by emotions.. Oxymoronic isn't it? Considering well.. Yknow.. That's why I let my anger out on things not people, I feel horrible afterwards if I yell at someone or raise my voice because I know it could impact how they feel in a negative way, and there's nothing worse than that to me..  So I'm forever stuck trying to give small hints as to why I'm upset or even upset at all. I've told people why I'm angry before but honestly it just makes it worse because I know nothing can be said or done externally to change how I feel on the inside.  And oh my god.. Youre so right about having to adjust to other people.. There's one person I don't have to do that with and its my best friend. It makes you wonder if we'll ever find someone that we don't have to adjust our personalities in order for them to be more comfortable.. It sounds whiny but god damn, we can generally learn anything.. It's just that none of it comes naturally. Except empathy, that shit can go to hell sometimes.  Sure I can talk my client about her friend at church (I'm a personal trainer) and make her believe I'm fascinated by it.. But it doesn't mean I'm enjoying myself. Is there actually someone out there that gives me energy instead of taking it?"
infj,3afgvy,phaedrablair,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:56:40 2015 UTC,"""...nothing can be said or done externally to change how I feel on the inside."" THIS! This right here. It's incredibly difficult for me to describe to people that what happens in the outside world will not help with my inside world. The work has to come from the inside and then works its way out.   I think its a godsend that we have at least one person that we can be completely normal with. It's so relieving. And I am sure we will find others out there that leave us feeling the same way. I am just hoping to find one other person, someone I can have a relationship with for the rest of my life. Also, when you say that we can learn anything, that is so unbelievably true as well.   You're right that talking to others is more draining than fueling for us. The only time I have ever been fueled by a conversation with someone is when we are talking about concepts instead of everyday things. I could go on forever about psychology topics. I guess another thing that really gives me energy is when I know that the person I am having the conversation with is benefitting from what I am saying, or I am benefitting from what they're saying."
infj,3afgvy,Intempestivity,3,Mon Jun 22 18:46:00 2015 UTC,"I wanted to say I'm sorry for your loss.  Also, you're spot on with that standing up for yourself--INFJs need to speak up for the sake of their mental health.  It's terrifying and really, really hard at first (I used to shake and feel sick when I was telling someone that enough was enough), but it's necessary, and it gets easier with time and practice (I don't even hesitate to draw boundaries now, and it doesn't make me shake or feel ill).  Another thing, most other personality types won't be hurt that you tell them it's too much.  They're generally oblivious to the fact that it is too much for us, and quite often they'll actually be relieved that you told them and not hurt at all."
infj,3afgvy,phaedrablair,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:10:24 2015 UTC,Thank you.

I always wait or actively try to find people more like me but always end up in the madness of emotion & people puking all their emotions & troubles on me. Cause it seems like its either that or i am completely alone in the world & that gets annoying too. It is exhausting. Do you know what empaths are? I'm pretty sure I'm one. Wish I could just turn it off sometimes. The emotional sensing and feeling of others & just be a logical guy for a while, selfish, and focus on me. But its like I'm forced to listen & feel everybody's emotions & I get sucked into them like a whirlpool appearing in a peaceful lake that I'm floating on. It's been quite a ride. Interesting to see everyone's views & ways of life but taxing and exhausting. I try to just enjoy the ride now... This to shall pass & the next experience awaits. Anyways, I feel ya.

infj,3afgvy,Intempestivity,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:35:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your thoughts.  The stretching yourself thin.. I believe I'm the definition of that. I give just about everyone I see on a daily basis an immense amount of my energy. When I'm with them, I'm being the best version of me I can at that moment. This gets difficult when you're interacting on more than a 'hello' basis with 20+ people a day, a third or more are clients that I have 100% focused on me for 30 minutes.. I believe this is what's causing me so much turmoil, its significant emotional and physical stress that I can't immediately help and it starts to weigh heavily. Unfortunately this leads to me being stretched thin, and I can no longer be the best version of me when I haven't had time to simply think.. I believe I'm running on borrowed time at this point.  However in the same breath I feel hypocritical because I've done this to myself and at times enjoy it. I discovered not too long ago that seeing people around me progress their situation in life whether it be their physical or mental self or tangibles makes me happy. I enjoy surrounding myself with people that work to improve themselves everyday, my parents however have hit a wall and I think that's where everything lies. I see them doing nothing and assume it's okay to do nothing, I can never tell them how happy I am that they gave me the space to be who I am but they undoubtedly took that route because they never actually found themselves.."
infj,3afgvy,qrd,3,Fri Jun 19 22:14:15 2015 UTC,"I'm a 30/f and I'm going to give you a bit of advice that a psychologist once gave to me:  Stop taking stuff off of everyone else's plate.  She analogised life to a big dinner party, and everyone has their plate in front of them.  On your plate is some stuff that was there when you sat down (stuff you were born with) and stuff that you have consciously added to it (choices you've made throughout life).  Everyone has their own plate, and you are currently picking food off of everyone else's plate and making a rather unstable tower on yours, one that will collapse if you don't return every one else's stuff.  To bring the analogy away from food--you're hurting your own mental health by not putting other people's problems back with them.  It's difficult to do, because as INFJs we like to fix everyone and everything on an emotional level--but you can't.  The only way I've been able to deal with it is listen to people's problems and afterwords, ask myself if there's anything I can do to control or assist in the situation.  If the answer is no, or I have done all I can (you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink), then I let it go.  It's not for me to keep it on my plate.  Easier said than done, yes.  But it does get easier every time you practice it.  Another thing that is pretty vital to not letting this sort of thing drive you crazy or happen too often is to speak up about it.  If a friend constantly unloads on you and it's bringing you down--say so!  Tell them that you're happy to offer them advice, but if they're not going to take steps to better their situation, you really can't deal with the amount of emotional baggage they're dumping on you,  and it's not fair to you to have to carry that with you.  Many other personality types don't actually realise that you take their rantings home with you--as far as they're concerned, it was just a vent that went out in to the ether.  Again, something that's quite difficult at first, but will get easier with practice."

I also just give an excuse to people when I can't emotionally handle hanging out with them; I tell them I'm not feeling well.   Hope you find some rest soon :("
infj,3afgvy,perfectIie,2,Fri Jun 19 21:36:11 2015 UTC,"I'm also a 21 yo male INFJ, and I've definitely experienced this. From what I've encountered, it tends to come in waves. I hit a point one or two times per year, where everyone's ""stupid bullshit"" as I often refer to it as at that point, gets to be too much. Generally around that time, I try to start looking for things to occupy myself for me, and that solution is nice for two reasons. Not only does it help exercise your other functions and take the constant strain off of your Fe interactions, but it also can give you an excuse as to why you can't listen, help, or give advice that much. If you have something ready like ""Hey, I don't have much time to talk now, I'm headed out to the gym/a meeting/a date/ dinner, etc"" then it gives you leverage. And in a lot of cases, it also makes people stop for a second in their mind and go ""Oh... damn, I bother them a lot with my stuff. I might want to pay more attention to that."" The clueless ones won't do this, but in a lot of cases, it serves both of the purposes that I talked to really well. I wish you luck!"
infj,3afgvy,HopefulRomantic527,2,Sat Jun 20 00:56:58 2015 UTC,"I totalllly relate to everything you said. I'm 23 F INFJ. Basically after years of being the mediator and THE ear for everyone in my life, I've realized a few things:  1) We need to let people grow.    If we are always there for a person, they will eventually depend on us to always be there. This is no good for anyone. We aren't able to focus on ourselves because they will eat up all our time (and we have a hard time resisting helping them). They won't learn to be independent / process their own problems individually.  I suggest listening to their problems once. When they start complaining about it a second time, ask in a nice way whether they would like to improve the situation or not.  If they would, then ask them what they think they should do about it. Don't give them answers but ask questions that make them think critically in other perspectives.  If they would not, then tell them you've heard this before and don't find to constructive to hear it again. (I would be blunt as hell at this point. It would probably surprise them because they wouldn't expect you to react this way. Hopefully this would be enough to get them to reconsider how they want to deal with their situation.)  Of course you can spin it in a nice way like saying how you really care about them and want them to be happy. You want to help them help themselves get out of their negative mindset.    2) Prioritize yourself.    I know you love your family and would do anything for them, but you need to help yourself so that you can thrive. You need space, get space. Don't feel bad about it. For all you do for your family and loved ones, you are the one that deserves the most love, space, respect. You must make demands for your own needs. If someone does not respect that, it is time to reconsider their intentions and their impact on your growth. It is only fair that you do this. If your other family members have no problem CAUSING/PROLONGING the conflicts (shit talking, complaining and not dealing), you MOST DEFINITELY have the right to distance yourself from their bs. You are only taking care of yourself and it is MORE THAN FAIR TO DO SO.    TL; DR:    Seriously, put your foot down and demand what you need. Aim to solve the root of the problem, no bandaid solutions.  Bandaid: accepting complaints from these people with no intention of every solving the problem, prolonging these problems (wasting time and energy) True Solution: Get people to learn to process their own problems / think for themselves / find their own solutions to their problems through trial-and-error.  If you don't say how you really feel, nothing will ever change."

The prioritizing myself is so hard, I'm being honest when I say that if I dealt (I mean be in the presence of) everyone that demanded my attention throughout the day I would have 2 hours in the morning to myself if I'm lucky.. I only work 4 hours a day if that gives you an idea. I struggle with wasting time in the morning by doing my routine I've always done, sit on my computer and do nothing of particular importance and ponder. I understand what you're saying though and I've been trying to work on it.  The distancing part is so difficult too, my parents and I work together with a means of income, I'm an only child (and grandchild on my mom's side, that side also lives literally across the street.) I'm also very open with my drug use, not that it's severe or anything but they know I smoke, so naturally I'm very close with them. They never judge me and see me as an equal in every way, however at the same time if I were to say I'm moving out they would drop anchor quicker than imaginable. This house holds too many bad memories. This trip to Vegas showed me that my personality is partially tied to this house, its holding me back and I don't know how to fix it."

I want to help them with their problems, but they all refuse to just stop and listen and try to work things out. They refuse to try and see things from the others perspective. Because I know what they both think and how they feel, I know how it can be solved. I try and give advice, but they're quick to write it off.

infj,3afmft,lzimmy,6,Fri Jun 19 19:09:32 2015 UTC,I would rather get a live plant or even bulbs to add to my yard rather than cut flowers. It is a nice gesture. I usually give live plants as well if I think the person would enjoy them (ex. Grandma).

I'd definitely prefer to give more tangible support in those times.   Yes, I definitely enjoy live plants, but when I had a smaller place it was an issue finding space or light for them. I also enjoy giving live plants to people who I know will enjoy them, like my mom and more nature-y friends. If I don't know someone well, I'll default to cut flowers since I'm not sure if they'll consider taking care of a plant as a burden or not. I have a friend who was so bad with plants that she didn't want to tell me the little one I got her died because she felt too guilty."
infj,3afmft,Chessiecat,5,Fri Jun 19 21:31:35 2015 UTC,"I'm an INFJ female and...ugh.  Seriously guys, you're giving me a half-dead plant that I now have to watch die entirely over the course of several days.  Then I have to clean up the corpse after it's shed flower bits everywhere.  Not cool.    Get me chocolate.  Kiss me.  Hold me.  Go for a walk with me.  Take me to a movie.  Have a deep conversation about our emotions.  Fuck me like a whore in the alley behind the grocery store.  Bite my neck until I squeak.    Do not get me flowers."
infj,3afmft,Herrokitty17,2,Sat Jun 20 05:27:54 2015 UTC,"If you think of them realistically as the severed sexual organs of a once living thing, it puts them in a new perspective. It's like someone showing they like you by giving you a box of raccoon nipples or something. In terms of ""love language"" modes, gifts is dead last for me by a mile, while physical touch is number one. I'm not sure how flowers managed to skirt the system so well, but I still like them. But I agree, cleaning out the slimy flower soup in the vase when they're dead is pretty gross."
infj,3afmft,hintofsass,3,Sat Jun 20 19:29:38 2015 UTC,"I'm an INFJ female and I love receiving flowers. My ex would surprise me with ""just because"" flowers all the time and those meant more to me than any fancy dinner. The gesture really touched me.   Conversely, I purchased flowers for a man once (not that ex boyfriend, he's an ENTP and I knew him well enough to know he'd think it was a waste of money and would rather me save money or buy him a milkshake! lol) and he didn't know how to respond and later confessed he thought it was weird because he had never been given flowers before and didn't think guys were ""supposed"" to get them. I don't know what his type was but he didn't appreciate them and so I've since decided no flowers for men unless I know they happen to like them."
infj,3afmft,Paragonight,3,Fri Jun 19 19:31:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's strange how flowers when genuinely and spontaneously given can eclipse other ""nicer"" gifts.  I don't know why this is. Maybe their impermanence makes me value them more, and it's something I really like which I don't buy for myself?  It's rare for me to have the same reaction to most other small tokens of affection (not that I'm an ungrateful bitch or anything), unless they've picked up my favorite trashy snack or something, since that pretty much fits my same criteria of impermanent and something I'll deny myself haha.  I might have to marry someone who gives me a bouquet of Cheetos, or a spring garland of Cinnamon Toast Crunch :P   You've also hit upon my exact concern about men and flowers. I think some might appreciate them, but I think most just never thought to expect them and therefore they might not have value as a gesture?"
infj,3afmft,Paragonight,3,Fri Jun 19 20:46:22 2015 UTC,"I LOVE FLOWERS dey so pretty :) it's the thought that's most important to me, not how much you spend on them. That being said I do enjoy classier flowers - my SO gave me orchids that are now by my bed."
infj,3afmft,Paragonight,2,Fri Jun 19 19:51:53 2015 UTC,"I think the thought is necessary, or at least the best part.  When not associated with a holiday or event, receiving flowers is a physical reminder that someone not only thought of you favorably, but actually acted upon it. What's not to like? I think the only flowers I have an issue with, if that's even a thing, are when they dye daisies really garish and unnatural colors. Otherwise, I'm pretty good with anything.  I'd probably even love it if someone brought me a tiny sheaf of wheat I could put in a vase haha."
infj,3afmft,justanontherpeep,3,Fri Jun 19 20:53:05 2015 UTC,"As a guy I've never received flowers but I would not react negatively if I did. My exact response would depend on the person who is giving them. If it was a jester of a friend, I would believe he/she is just trying mess with me. Should there be reason to celebrate, such as a birthday, or like you mentioned as a congrats on a theatrical performance, I would think of it as a gesture and kindness. I have once received randomly in my mailbox a chocolate bar, not quite sure from whom or why, as it was rather odd but amusing none the less. In do believe in general I have no issues at all with what most people do, the reaction to anything depends on the specific issue at hand and the parts involved :)"
infj,3afmft,justanontherpeep,2,Fri Jun 19 20:51:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a lot depends on context. Still, I'm happy to see you'd be open to it. Unless they really think they're pointless and wasteful, I think men deserve to be shown some spontaneous affection like that. I mean, why not?"
infj,3afmft,jeff233,3,Fri Jun 19 21:37:12 2015 UTC,"Precisely so, I actually encourage both men and women to be spontaneous and creative. I am an open book really, but a lot people tend to be comfortable with just assuming about others even if they are dead wrong, instead of actually attempting to establish some kind of connection and understanding. The blame can probably be put in many places, such as the social standards and expectations we've accepted. I'm sure to many people, especially men it is an issue that perhaps would make some question their manliness. If only more men especially and people all around grasped that you can still be manly and also show and receive affection such as this posted example. But what do I know :P"
infj,3afmft,Sephirona,3,Fri Jun 19 21:43:54 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, that's true. But luckily I think a lot of people are starting to question these kind of gender-based norms and customs and there's starting to be a social shift. I think it's pretty ridiculous that open forms of affection like that are only ""supposed"" to be delivered in one direction unless it's a recognized special occasion. Why wouldn't a guy want to feel appreciated? He's a human being and you'd assume feeling loved would be a welcome thing regardless of gender.   But like others have said, not everyone is about flowers...but that's not to say those flowers couldn't be surprise sci-fi paperbacks, milkshakes, etc.  It's just that we already have this symbol in place where flowers=caring and I'm curious how possible or welcome it would be to make that more universal between the sexes."
infj,3afmft,Jackoffknifefighter,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:21:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah one can hope so. Everything you wrote I agree with and any progress we can see with humans developing a more open and receptive mentality, I would more than welcome and embrace.   I enjoy affection and gestures and if people genuinely take the time to show me they appreciate something I did or mean to them, then I would want them to feel safe in expressing their feelings towards me in any way they are comfortable with.  A lot of things in general are shifting in our society, we do see progress with so many things and one can only hope it'll keep going that direction. That said and unfortunately so, sometimes things take one step forward and two steps backwards. I'm not the complaining type, but it can be disappointing to see things behind held back. We all have so much potential and there is nothing more wonderful than to see things ""blossom"", be it relationships, or just humanity in general. While I do very much value diversity, I would still rather have another open mind, than someone who will blindly refuse an idea that does not fall into alignment with his/her current belief."
infj,3afmft,Jackoffknifefighter,3,Sat Jun 20 14:26:59 2015 UTC,"Guynfj (clever, eh? amirite??) - I like plants, a lot.  I'd be into wildflowers, vegetables or things like cactus or unique plants... the way I was brought up, it's been drilled in my head that ""flowers are for girls"" and at 40+, that would be hard to change."
infj,3afmft,islander85,2,Fri Jun 19 22:19:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's really hard to shake the social programming we've grown up with, but it's great there are still things someone could casually gift you that you'd like! In fact, a lot of those succulents are not only incredibly sculptural and interesting, but also a lot easier to deal with than cut flowers. I'd actually really dig that as a gift, good idea."
infj,3afmft,islander85,2,Fri Jun 19 23:08:00 2015 UTC,"Fwiw, I do the flower thing for my wife a lot. She loves it"
infj,3afmft,islander85,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:27:27 2015 UTC,"Well done! Usually there's the traditional response gift of hugs or kisses, so luckily it's something both people get to enjoy :D"

infj,3afmft,jeff233,3,Fri Jun 19 20:43:24 2015 UTC,"I hope a girl gives you flowers some day.  As someone who can appreciate them as more than just a gesture, you definitely deserve that experience!"
infj,3afmft,PRETTY_MOTHERFUCKA,2,Fri Jun 19 21:34:43 2015 UTC,"I really relate to how you say you don't always like gifts when you don't expect them. I'm the same way. I certainly appreciate the thought, it's very sweet, but yeah - I inevitably feel pressured to reciprocate and it can feel awkward, haha.  That said, flowers are lovely to look at and smell, but I don't really like getting them at all precisely because of their impermanence. It could be argued that that's part of their charm, but I don't like the thought that money and sentiment was spent on something that won't last. Would much prefer some sort of hardy vegetable or fruit-bearing plant as a gift.   Heck, get me a potato plant. I will love it with all my heart and think of you every time I water it."
infj,3afmft,PRETTY_MOTHERFUCKA,2,Fri Jun 19 22:15:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's a lot to be said for living plants! Especially ones you can attach special meaning to. My mom still has a cutting of a plant that used to be in her first apartment she shared with her roommates in college.  Now they each have a bit of it that's still growing 40+ years later. They called each plant Philip, after their hot, heart-breaker downstairs neighbor haha.   For Mother's Day I picked the most amazingly huge head of leafy lettuce I've ever seen from the farm where I work and gave it to my mom. It was as large as a bouquet and she loved it. I then made a pretty great salad, so bonus."
infj,3afmft,PRETTY_MOTHERFUCKA,2,Fri Jun 19 22:56:48 2015 UTC,"I'd be happy but a little overwhelmed. I mean, what am I going to keep them in? How do I prolong their life? In which location would they look the best? Will they aggravate my allergies? What flowers are in there, anyway? Should I put a cloth underneath whatever I store them in? If so, what color cloth should I use?"
infj,3afmft,RedStar1946,2,Fri Jun 19 22:29:19 2015 UTC,"Hmm, good points. Let's practice! ""Happy Cake Day, Jackoffknifefighter!. Congrats on your first year!!""  How was that?"

infj,3afmft,hotdimsum,2,Fri Jun 19 22:40:32 2015 UTC,"Haha! You don't have to know the flowers to enjoy them. Those are tulips and they'll fit into any bottle or glass you have, as long as it's not filled with alcohol :)  Put them somewhere you can see them frequently so you can be reminded that someone wants you to feel special! That's pretty much the only rule."
infj,3afmft,hotdimsum,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:46:51 2015 UTC,I've never been given flowers (or anything really) But I would loves someone to give me flowers. Yes I know is not the done thing to give a man flowers but I gave up on the whole man thing a while ago now.
infj,3afmft,MemoriesOfSelf,3,Fri Jun 19 22:17:47 2015 UTC,"This bums me out, guys should be given gifts of appreciation! I think a lot of the ""man"" code or whatever is a bit too stringent. Like, I know some men don't wear anything pink because it's too girly or it will somehow make people question their sexuality. The thing is, I can't even wear pink well, and I'm a girl. If you look good in pink, rock that! A dude who doesn't care what other people think and is confident in what they like is far cooler and ""manly"" than one who toes the line out of fear.  Go ahead, want those flowers dude! Loud and proud, brotha!"
infj,3afmft,zman4000,2,Fri Jun 19 23:03:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks, It's a hard one. I find women get more upset then men when a man does something outside the norm for what men are seen to do. I don't know why some people get so upset by it. I still have problems with having the confidence to pull it off sometimes, but I'm getting better slowly. I'm seen as not very manly most of the time, I do have a phone that everyone says is pink though.  I read an interesting article on pink washing where girls could play with any colour toy or clothing they liked as long as it was pink. I tried searching for it but it looks like pink has been taken over by the breast cancer movement now.  Both men and women have a long way to go as far as equality go, there are a lot of social norms that are slanted to one or the other."

One in particular just sparks a piece of my brain that causes near fits of creativity and wonder.  That said, like any other introvert... she and I function on different levels.  She has her needs (lots of friends, lots of activities, etc) and I have mine (close knit circle, down time, quiet)... and it works fine.  But to call a room full of ENFPs exhausting is a little overly simplistic and unfair.    Personally, I find the energy of some ENFPs to be absolutely invigorating... especially when it comes to shared interests, etc."

They are absolutely not worth your time or energy, and they're particularly not worth your life.    Try to channel your pain in to writing or drawing; I found that would help me a lot (still does).  The thing with us INFJs is we like to believe the best in people, always ... but sometimes there just isn't anything good there.  It took me more than twenty years to learn how to cut poisonous people out of my life, and I wish I'd been able to do it sooner.  Stop talking to him, stop connecting with him.  Block him on your phone and your social media.  He doesn't deserve you.  You need to let yourself grieve for a while, and when you're ready, you'll be able to let him go completely--but you won't ever reach that point if you keep him in your life.  Once you're able to let him go, you'll see that there are people out there who will love you for who you are, and respect you as a person.  They won't be slimeballs like this jerk--and he is scummy to have treated you that way.  Don't surround yourself with scum.  I know it hurts so much right now.  Keep breathing.  Take things one day at a time, one hour at a time if you must.  Try to put all that pain in to something productive--draw, write, sculpt, build a birdhouse, exercise, whatever.  Maybe see if there's any place in your area where you can volunteer--it will help take your mind off of things and I find helping others always makes me feel a little bit better in myself.  Animal shelters are particularly awesome places to volunteer, especially if you're feeling down.  There's nothing like giving a homeless animal a bit of care and affection to take the edge off of raw emotions.  If you ever need to talk (30/f here), then feel free to drop me a PM.  I've been through a few episodes of major depression, and I know how it feels to be completely numb and hopeless.  I'm living proof that this horrible feeling does not last forever; you can and will feel happy again."
infj,3ad9pn,Intempestivity,4,Fri Jun 19 05:24:04 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your advice and I want to thank you. I have been writing out my feelings and I've been trying to stay productive. I realize that he's not worth my time, however, it's difficult to just throw people out of my life. I am doing all that I can to move on, it's just my feelings are hurt. Writing does help me tremendously and I will continue to do that."
infj,3ad9pn,Intempestivity,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:11:10 2015 UTC,"It is difficult to throw people out of your life, but it's necessary.  That's a lesson I learned when I was a bit older than you are now, and I really do wish I'd learnt it years ago.  When you separate yourself from someone in every way possible, the emotional ties eventually dry up and fall away, and you feel happier and healthier in your own mind because you're not taking on everyone else's crazy."
infj,3ad9pn,Lamzn6,15,Sat Jun 20 04:40:04 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I'm so sorry for the immense pain you're feeling.   Secondly, you CAN feel better again. It's completely possibly and likely. I promise.   You're young and sexuality is new in general but on top of that sexual abuse is shattering. Maybe you can ask a parent or guardian to take you to a counselor. This is a healthy way to sort through feelings. Or if you're dealing with severe depression you need to see a medical doctor.   You're an INFJ so you're sensitive and when you feel pain it channels inward over and over. Other people experience pain too but there are people out there that have felt pain the same way you have.  And they came out stronger for making it through.   It's okay to make posts like this and I'm glad you did this. It says you truly want to get better, you're just not sure how.   Please try to understand that although you've been violated, you are not dirty. The acts done to you are bad, but nothing is wrong with your body or you.   Teenage boys are rather horrible. Somehow many of them figure out the errors of their ways and later deeply regret the ways they hurt girls when they were young. But it's important for you to stay away from this person right now. He has nothing more to offer you at this point in your life.   It seems silly but if you could try wrapping your arms around yourself so it's like a hug, you can feel your self love giving you the strength to put one foot in front of the other to figure this out.   Please do not hurt yourself. I've come close a few times myself but it only transfers pain to the people that love you and would miss you.  It's not a good option.   Edit: 29/F here. Now you have a few of us that can help you. Don't hesitate to pm me."
infj,3ad9pn,Horouto,3,Fri Jun 19 05:27:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I have tried to go see a counselor multiple times before about some other personal reasons, and I don't get much help from them. I'm struggling with this battle on my own, due to nobody understanding me and my feelings."
infj,3ad9pn,Horouto,10,Fri Jun 19 16:15:42 2015 UTC,"It really breaks my heart when I hear things like this.I mean I was lurking around here (because uh....reasons)and I didn't expect to bump into this.In my eyes here's what you should do:   Cut all ties with him, how you might ask? Threaten him by calling the police he won't dare to touch you. Of course calling the police would be the right solution, but knowing you INFJs maybe you don't want to hurt him. So just threaten him with it. And if he shows even the smallest sign of disobedience ,actually call the police. You might be shy and so on, but really it might be the only solution. I mean if I was there I would step on his neck or something for you. I really dislike people like that. Don't be weak, stay strong or he will keep on exploiting your weakness against you. Give him nothing to exploit in short. Fretting over the past will get you nowhere, what happened has happened and that cannot be changed. What's actually important is the steps you will take after what happened. ""You can't start the next chapter of your life, if you keep re-reading the last one""  I am going to paraphrase my favorite qoute about this topic because I can't seem to recall it "" If you keep looking at the past you won't be able to see infront of you and you'll only end up with a sore neck"". Take what has happened as a lesson for the future, this is not the end of your story. If anything ""Life doesn't get any easier, but you get stronger"". You have to also understand that we've all had our fair share of problems, some worse than others. But it's not that uncommon for 1 in a million problems(assuming there are 1 million legitimate problems , there is definitely much less though)  to happen to people. There are 7 billion on this planet so things like that aren't as uncommon as you think. What I am trying to say here if all these people beat their problems down ,then you can too. You're no less than them.   3.Do something that will occupy you, that will help you forget the pain and start a new chapter. What you need to understand here is the following: Pain is a good teacher, it helps people grow and evolve. But when you are stuck in it, then you aren't making any progress. Don't make your life revolve around this issue, your life is worth more than that.Go and experience the world , make new geniune friends that will protect you and actually help you.You were brave enough to post what has happened to you. Stay brave.  These are just some tips out of the top of my head, hope they helped! If you need anything else don't hesitate to PM me! ^ ^"

I have been trying to stay occupied by writing and other little projects, but I can't stop thinking about him. I really am trying though. I know he's not worth it and he has damaged my heart. It just sucks because while he continued to show me whatever it was, he was loving my best friend."
infj,3ad9pn,zeymad,3,Fri Jun 19 16:20:59 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean.The real question is why do you keep thinking about him, are consciously or maybe even unconsciously still hold some kind of expectation for him or maybe do you still hold feelings for him? Well that is irrelevant , honestly don't worry about it. Overtime you will forget. 10 years from now you might look back and then might even laugh. Just continue to occupy yourself with things, this actually a great time for you to develop good habits. I mean thinking about it is fine, as long as it doesn't pain you. And if it does, you need to stop pitying yourself.Pitying yourself won't change anything now would it?Yiou should be feeling awesome since this malarkey is almost finally over. It's all mental now. xD  Edit: I just remembered something important, keep smiling. Smiling actually MAKES you happy . So keep a smile on at all times! Fake it till you make it type of thing! Thats how you get over these things most of the time. You need to sit with yourself and be honest about why you are feeling what. If you know the root of the cause you 'll feel much more at ease! You'll also be able to resolve the issue easier. Smile through everything okay?  :P"
infj,3ad9pn,Duke_Leto2,7,Fri Jun 19 18:08:44 2015 UTC,"Talk to somebody you know and trust, if you have somebody you trust enough. You really need to let whatever support system you have help you.   As for my thoughts: First and foremost you need to stop talking to him. Today is the day when he goes into your rear view mirror and starts to fade away. Use that intuition of yours: he is clearly toxic and clearly has caused a lot of pain for you. The faster you rid yourself of his presence, the quicker you can recover. And you WILL recover. It takes time to recover from the pain. He's hurt you in ways that you may have to work to heal from. But you are young and learning, and you will continue to learn, and you will find better people in the future. Nothing he did is remotely your fault, and I think you know that, but you're still beating yourself up over it. You really need to try to be your own best friend right now. Whatever happened that you feel responsible for (even though I assure you youre not), forgive yourself. You're a good person and you have a lot of time left to be a good person and to meet other good people and do lots of good things. But you have to heal, and it will take time. Be patient, support yourself, and take it a day at a time."

infj,3ad9pn,zeymad,4,Fri Jun 19 07:16:40 2015 UTC,"Wait, you're still talking with him? Look, you need to ignore and stop thinking about him. I understand you're traumatized, but you need to relax. Think about other things; maybe go on a walk or talk with a friend. Make sure to go outside plenty–Sunshine and the feeling of wind will do wonders for the psyche. It sounds like being alone with your thoughts is the last thing you need right now. Don't stop being active and doing things until you're able to approach matters with a calmer state of mind."

If not for our experiences, we wouldn't be who we are. This time of pain and hurt will teach you things for the future and make you much wiser and stronger. I think us INFJs need to be shaken up like this every once in awhile. It's how we delve deeply into the human condition. I know you're very young, but I'm sure you can appreciate the knowledge of older people who have gone through something similar.  I think the best thing for processing feelings is a distraction. When I was 14/15 it was football. I took all my pain and anger and hurt into the weight room and onto the field. It was a great outlet. Now that I'm older I take more easily to music and writing. Just be patient, and for the love of everything good keep living. There's so much more to be seen.  EDIT: Also, all the people saying to cut ties with this person are right."

infj,3ad9pn,phaedrablair,3,Fri Jun 19 16:29:43 2015 UTC,"Hey, I came late to your post but see you have gotten some excellent responses and you sound even a bit more optimistic in your replies. This is good! Little steps are still taking steps away from all this!  Here is what I have learned that I wish I would have known a lot sooner to check if people are liars and users.   Actions and words HAVE to match!   If someone's actions and words don't match, I can barely bring myself to trust them. I had an old abusive boyfriend who would tell me he loved me but then flirt with other girls at parties and make picky comments about my breasts, or hair color or whatever. He would say one thing in private but his actions did not match what he was saying. This always, always caused me upset butterfly feelings in my stomach.  It caused me headaches and crying and I couldn't figure out what was wrong. He was inconsistent. A good man (not a boy!) who truly loves you will say that he will stand by you AND his actions will SHOW that he stands by you.   Any boy that won't listen when you say no, or even one who is pressuring you and making you uncomfortable needs to get kicked to the curb immediately. I waited too many times in my life excusing the bad behavior of others when I knew deep in my heart it was wrong. INFJs have a very strong sense of right and wrong. We need to exercise it and believe it! I also think young ladies do not listen to our instincts enough, we may let a man coerce or even dominate us. We tell ourselves ""he didn't mean to....it was just that one time""....but there is a reason those red flags go off in our heads. Something is wrong.   But you have seen the light now. He did whatever he did, but you can drop the famous INFJ doorslam and say, ""NO MORE!"". You have seen how he is and you will not be played by him any longer. I always liken it to a board game....the abuser goes back and forth with you, all their tricks and manipulations, engaging you in their game. A doorslam is you turning over the whole game board and yelling, ""I am not participating in this anymore!!"". This experience will make you more wise and more brave, so if someone else tries to coerce you, you know how to spot it. This is good. These are skills you are going to need later in life.   We are here if you need us. Being an INFJ teen can be very challenging, it can feel like the whole world is out to use us. But we can gather tools for survival and even thrive. As we grow and mature it does get a lot better."
infj,3ad9pn,wiggins1313,3,Fri Jun 19 18:07:44 2015 UTC,Thank you so very much. It is very challenging being an INFJ at my age because of my emotions and how I tend to handle situations.
infj,3ad9pn,48valentine,3,Fri Jun 19 21:00:34 2015 UTC,"I used to teach at a high school. I had one male student who I was pretty sure was gay and had not come out yet, and another female student who had 8000 types of drama going on any given day, she had a lot of trouble regulating her emotions. One day I sat them down, they were both so upset and angry all the time....and I said to them, ""do you realize you are not going to feel like this the rest of your life? You won't feel so angry/sad/confused all the time? About the time I got to my late teens/20s everything started to fall into place...."" and then we had a nice talk about what major catastrophes to avoid (ex. Don't get pregnant/knock up someone, dont wind up in jail and don't overdose on drugs, etc). Keep focused on positive things such as school, GOOD friends and taking care of yourself and you will get out the other side.  And whoever said high school is the best years of your life is full of shit. ;D Its after, because it is whatever you want to make it!"

infj,3ag17z,SureAviator,8,Fri Jun 19 21:06:46 2015 UTC,"It's pretty much a four stage deal.   Stage One is a good mood; my temper isn't part of the picture.  Stage Two is annoyance. I'm not really angry, but I'm frustrated by someone or something.  Stage Three is aggravation. I'm getting mildly angry and throw myself a little pity party. This is typically the turning point of my temper; I'll either use my anger constructively or I'll progress to stage four.  Stage Four is fuck up as many things as possible. You ever hear the term blind rage? That's what it's like for me when I truly get angry. I usually end up breaking things or assaulting people. Thankfully, I've only rarely become this angry."
infj,3ag17z,Jackoffknifefighter,5,Fri Jun 19 22:33:36 2015 UTC,"My guess would be no, or at least not directly. I think it's possible for people of a certain type to be more prone to certain behaviors than others, but I don't think it grants or prevents certain thoughts and actions. For instance, let's say an INFJ has a horrible temper but feels guilty about lashing out at others and therefore has learned to internalize their feelings. That doesn't mean they're less angry or temperamental than a different type that doesn't feel like editing themselves as much.  It's just that you'll notice the temper on one and not the other.   As far as myself, I don't have much of one at all anymore. Over time I've become rather stoic in terms of negative emotions. I used to burn with rage during my childhood, which most of my friends don't seem to believe to be possible, but that diminished in my late teens.  That's not to say that I don't ever lose my cool, but it's really hard to get myself riled up or to find something worth getting that angry about. I used to have a hard time not escalating my tone when someone else was escalating theirs, but I've been much better about it. Mostly when I slip up it's because someone else is in a foul mood and since I'm so used to ""mirroring"" my environment it can cause problems. Some can push my buttons a lot better than others though, I just try to avoid them."

We all interpret things quite differently, even with overall similarities, there will always be small things that set us apart from each other.  The most unattractive quality I can think of in another human is when someone feels the need to force their belief onto others. Especially extremist of any kind that discriminate others and/or otherwise display hate, anger, ignorance and bigotry, those people I prefer to steer as far away from as possible.  In regards to believing in a religion myself, not currently at least, but I'm of the opinion that the universe more than likely holds multiple elements that us humans can't quite comprehend.

infj,3ae4de,santasmic,2,Fri Jun 19 19:13:08 2015 UTC,"Prepare yourself for a long read.  I believe there is a consciousness that connects everything in the universe, and it's what people refer to as the soul/spirit/mind.  They are all one and the same.  It moves through us and connects everything in to a collective whole--not just individuals, but anything and everything living.  Our sense of self is derived from the branch of consciousness that flows up and in to our individual bodies, but it is a branch, not a bubble--we are not separate from the whole, though we are individuated.  We all have the ability to access this consciousness; some of us are born able to tap in to it, for others it takes lots of practice to even get near it.  This is what most people tend to refer to as ESP/psychic phenomena/mediumship.  Unfortunately, due to the intense focus in Western religions on the individual, the majority of people have lost the ability to feel this underlying connection the majority of the time, and as such cannot immerse themselves in it and can be dubious of people who can and do.  Because they can't feel the consciousness that connects us all, they also have lost touch with the fact that what they do to and for themselves ripples out and affects everything, and then returns back to themselves.  People born in Western society who utilise Western religion and innately have ability to feel it will often not realise what it is they're feeling--they term it as an intense connection to God or Jesus, and that said deity will speak through them or move them to help others.  Again, it's that whole individual focus--they don't realise that they're connecting with everyone and feeling the ripples; they believe they're connecting with one individual's power.  Along with a connection to each other, we have a deep connection with nature.  Again, many people have unfortunately lost touch with this connection, but there's a reason that many will find nature soothing, whether it's the woods, open fields, the ocean, or even animals that have been domesticated and raised as pets.  It's because they're connecting with that force in the most basic of ways--there's no emotions to deal with when it comes to nature, at least not on the complexity of the human emotional scale.  If a dog is sad or angry, it will be in reaction to a physical stimulus, not because it was suddenly dwelling on the fact that the cat was being an asshole two weeks ago.  Nature heals our souls, it smooths the ripples.  It lets people tap in on the most basic of all levels, and even if we don't necessarily realise that's what's occurring, the soothing influence it has is felt universally.  In addition to tapping in to nature's consciousness, and indeed, other people's individual branches, we can use some of that energy to manipulate the ripples through the whole.  Not necessarily magic, as such, but if you pull the power of the consciousness of nature in to your own individual branch, you can then transfer it to someone else's branch who may not necessarily be able to hold on to a connection on their own.  That's it in a nutshell--I don't want to write a massive manifesto!  I came to these conclusions because of my own experiences and learning about different belief systems and finding those that resonated with my experiences.  I have always been able to tap in, for whatever reason.  I have heard and seen things that people refer to as ghosts, which are in my opinion individual consciousnesses that are lost in the connection--they still don't realise they were a branch; they think they're a bubble, so when they find themselves in the greater collective, they struggle to connect properly and as such leave one piece of themselves on the surface.  I've been able to see and hear these since I was little.  I also have a tendency to know when a particular movie is about to be shown on tv (it will just pop in my head a day or two before and then I'll randomly see it on the television), or when a song is about to come on to the radio or my iPod.  I used to do tarot readings for people that were incredibly accurate.  I can feel other's individuated energy--some people are quite soothing, others are empty, still others can be like little needles.  I think the fact that my parents did not want to influence my beliefs at all really helped me identify what exactly it was that I did believe in.  If we had questions about Western religion (my parents were raised in two different versions of Christianity), they would answer them, but they felt it was wrong to force it on us--as such, we were never baptised, and we weren't made to go to church; we only went if we wanted to (my parents didn't go to church themselves any more).  I experienced several different Westernised churches and it all felt wrong to me because it focussed so much on the individual and on one individual deity, which didn't mesh with what I'd felt and experienced all my life.  So I learned and experienced other religions, and found the pieces that made sense.  Which brings me to where I am today.  Sort of Buddhist, sort of Wiccan, not subscribed to any one religion.  As I said before, if a particular religion helps someone and they come to it from a place of love and use it for love and kindness without forcing it on others, then that's not a bad thing--it's just not for me."
infj,3ae4de,Intempestivity,2,Sat Jun 20 05:28:29 2015 UTC,I can relate to this thought pattern and agree with the idea of a collective consciousness and/or things within the universe we as humans can't even begin to comprehend or define :)
infj,3ae4de,hintofsass,7,Sat Jun 20 07:22:40 2015 UTC,"Short answer, yes.   Long answer, I'm not religious and I'm not spiritual either. I wish we could just keep the few good things that come from religion (social support, meditation, charity, loving your neighbor, etc) and trash all the rest of it. Religion is so easy to twist and misuse to bad ends. On the whole I really believe humanity would be better off without it. That isn't my decision to make, though.   I guess ultimately it doesn't bother me as long as it's unobtrusive. Proselytizing, that annoys me. Creationism in science classes, kids not taught evolution because Jesus, or not taught proper sex ed for the same reason, that bothers me. Telling LGBT people they're going to hell. Suicide bombers. Restrictions on women's rights. And so on. There's a whole awful lot of that we can live without."

It rejects all forms of religious hierarchy, and gives me a place where no beliefs are forced on me, where I am free to evolve and struggle in my own beliefs, and where I can find support and silence and intelligent, liberal people who also seek something greater than themselves and are usually comfortable admitting that they do not fully understand the spiritual, whatever it may be. It's experience-based rather than creed-based, and no matter your religious experience it is valid because you have experienced it. There are no ministers (or, anyone who wishes has the power to minister). The only accepted doctrine is that ""there is the light of God (or whatever word you like) in everyone."" There are a few more conservative branches that are more like traditional churches, but I'm part of what's called an ""unprogrammed Meeting."""

I really have no need to think about mysterious forces of the universe or whatever when there's so many things in our world that move me in some way.

infj,3ae4de,ThePhantom394,2,Sun Jun 21 06:31:11 2015 UTC,"I take what is available from all known religions and will probably never stop learning about each one. Baptized as a Christian I quickly came to question religion as a small child and went through an Atheistic phase in High School.  Ten years later and I guess I would consider myself either Agnostic or Buddhist. Likely the latter these days as I very much appreciate mindfulness and am interested in dissolving what is left of my ego.  Religion takes hold as a subjective experience and I would never question another person's beliefs to their face or downright attack them. On the other hand, I am not a fan of people who attempt to indoctrinate those around them and that is my biggest issue with religion. The unity and love present in some areas is a beautiful thing to witness, but the grey area of profit, control and in some cases racism and condemning others, is something I really cannot respect. Deep down I do honestly believe that the powers that be have an agenda to cull the population and keep us on a low vibrational level of fear. I mean, 80 people on Earth control 50% of the total wealth. Isn't that level of unfathomable greed indicative of pure corruption? In my mind this links to a lot of religions.  Having been down many hallucinogenic avenues, I will say that deep down I resonate with the thought that this reality is much of an encoded Matrix. Encoded in the sense that each seed has its own package of properties that comes into full effect in this world. This blooming is mesmerizing.  In the grand scheme of life I feel this is a ride, and that reincarnation is likely what will occur. I subscribe to the Hindu belief of Samsara in more ways than I do not. I feel as though we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. Wherever this ""Godmind"" is, is likely what we're all looking for. I very much believe in other dimensions or planes of existence and feel these are true if one is to look at the Electromagnetic Spectrum of light as one example of all that can exist that we are not aware of.  I reject that science will answer everything. Maybe in the sense of this physical reality. We have lost touch with our spirituality in the world at present and are placing much of our faith in militant Thinker types or those who only wish to apply a paste of pure logic to every possible thing in this reality. With the influx of the industrial revolution, everything is different. I feel this is the wrong way of doing things and will only lead us further astray.  Like other INFJs I get a deep sense of when something is right or wrong. Not just morally, but on a universal level. The world at present is full of shit to put it bluntly, and it's a shame that much of everything taught in the western world is a downright lie to keep us living in fear."

At the end of the day, I guess I'd say that sentience seems to lend itself to at least some degree of religious thought. The mind of God would likely be too complex and nuanced to build a religious belief structure and presume that it was completely in accordance to God's will, but seeing as we box ourselves in and indulge in lazy thinking anyway, recognizing the ""whore of Babylon"" when you see it is no worse than becoming overly analytical and pedantic... Asked for an honest answer, I would acknowledge the existence of God fairly readily, but I would only devote so much energy into trying to convince people that they are best served to view the world in these terms."

As an infj-male, I'm incredibly sensitive to when other people are getting uncomfortable with my presence. I wasn't always conscious of the creeped-out feelings that my curiosity brought out in others, but getting called on it taught me fast.  Now, I'll usually watch from afar. I'm still incredibly curious, but I've learned to give people their space. This holds extra true for the people I live with. I very much love having my Bestie living under my roof, so I don't want to do anything to jeopardize that relationship.

You were putting aside things you enjoy, 'saving for later' I'd call it. I do it! But when I stop that delaying, I suddenly get the magic back. And every time I'm as if caught by surprise: did I not do it before? Why did I stop? I think INFJs are prone to getting lost in details of bigger pictures; the older we get the bigger the picture we observe, but we get totally detached from the actual scale of our involvement in that picture. But that is in fact the source of the magic—participation.    So, as a how-to, do what you were delaying for a long time and just do it. Wanted a garden? It's the right time! Do you want to go to that concert? Today is the day.

One thing I can tell you is that INFJs are perfectionists and idealists by nature. Pretty much everything revolves around that. When we look around at the world we only see the flaws, what could be improved upon, and as a result we sometimes see things as ugly.   Is environmental consulting really that bad? Or was it just not up to your expectations? And I'm not trying to insult you here - I have an idea of what pretty much everything is going to be like in my life so when I'm wrong, I'm disappointed. I don't even consciously do it. My friends birthday is on Saturday and I already have ideas of how my night will go; I don't even know where the party is.   Anyway, to me, it also sounds like you're getting a little bored of monotony? Just a stab in the dark, but that's what it sounds like. Find a passion of yours and just push yourself into it. Spend one of your insomnia nights just diving into something amazing.  Hope that helps :)."
infj,3ac54z,santasmic,3,Fri Jun 19 00:05:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the reply :) no insult taken - I think a lot of people attracted to environmental consulting are taken aback once they get in. There are for sure some organizations and non-profits doing fantastic work, but my experience with private consulting is they find the legal loop holes just so oil companies can put in a new pipeline and they can get the money to 'reclaim' it later sigh I certainly had unrealistic expectations in that regard.  And I definitely feel you on the expectation bit. There's a wedding coming up in 2 weeks and I'm already dreading the small talk. Thing is though, sometimes I have a great time in large gatherings and just have fun so it's just as possible for that to happen too..I just generally don't focus on it :o/ maybe I need to actively try to do that...I default the negative expectation a lot.   And deeefinitely sick of monotony! My job now is decent because it's not stressful, I work fairly independently, but it's the same thing over and over. I'll have to (re)explore what my passions are - it used to be into music and environmentalism, but maybe there's another avenue that I can explore, or explore those again in my 30's with a different perspective.

I finished a Social Work degree thinking that the whole fight for the people, and make the world a better place thing would be a great fit for me.  Two years into my first job as a Social Worker and I became disenchanted with the entire system.  I noticed my job was to fight the state to care for it's own people.  And, the state almost always won the fight.  (I live in a ruby red state)  Realizing that I have failed at being a Social Worker, I decided to leave my job to find other employment.  Now, two months later, I'm still unemployed, and considering an entirely different path altogether.  The longer time goes by that I'm unfocused, the more disenchanted with the world I become.  My job search has turned into a rabbit hole of sending out my resume, and obsessing about finding a place for myself.  Fortunately, I have a very wonderful support system who have more faith in me than I have in myself at this point.  Honestly, I'm beginning to wonder if there is a place for me. Yikes, that got dark fast.   Sorry, really just wanted to come show support to you.  Seems like I turned it into a wallow. Please take away from this rant that you are not alone.

What I wasn't prepared for was that my skills in word smithing would be used not for the benefit of the individuals served, but to savor the bottom line of the agencies involved.  I wasn't prepared for the lack of support from the state, other agencies, or colleagues.  I wasn't prepared to be expected to work while taking vacation in another state, while taking sick time because I couldn't roll out of bed, or basically 24 hours a day even when I wasn't on call.

As an INFJ, 1-1 conversations about deeper topics are refreshing to me. Although I could have 120423230 chats with friends about the meaning of life and still never feel like I've figured anything out for myself.  I'd also like some advice on getting out of a multi-year funk. I started with distraction, then some serious introspection and soul-searching, and now I'm floating along VERY detached.  My memory is very poor, and the days, weeks, months are all blurring together. I definitely feel like a shell as well. I've had insomnia for about two years but Kundalini yoga, meditation and working out has helped. Now, I would say I just want to sleep more than anything.   Our idealist natures really screw us over.

My sleep has definitely improved since my external situation has, but I still have nights where my brain just won't shut up.

After much searching, I've found that Complex PTSD is a better framework to describe my symptom. It's different from classical PTSD in that instead of a single traumatic event that causes it, it's... complex. :P Trauma sounds bad, and I didn't think anything bad had happened to me, but that doesn't mean I wasn't profoundly affected by some difficult times in my life (which I had partly burried). I also have a bunch of emotional abandonment issues thrown in for good measure.  There's a support site with more information at http://cptsd.org and the wiki page is good too at https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_post-traumatic_stress_disorder  Also, studies have shown that a lot of people with BPD have complex trauma histories too. There is a lot of overlap in symptoms. BPD seems to be overdiagnosed. It's often used by psychiatrists to label 'difficult' patients, and is very disproportionately applied to female patients (similar to how doctors used to diagonse women with female hysteria)."

Examples include people who have experienced chronic maltreatment, neglect or abuse in a care-giving relationship, hostages, prisoners of war, concentration camp survivors, and survivors of some religious cults.

From a young age I've always felt that something wasn't quite right with my personality. I had trouble fitting in socially my whole life, and now I'm just trying to figure out what exactly is wrong with me so I can get out of this rut and move on.

It's sad because I was prescribed medication that made me a walking zombie/vegetable due to this misdiagnosis. I was numb all the time, like I couldn't feel pleasure or pain. They told me I would be like that forever, that I would never be free of depression or BPD, and that I would just have to learn to 'cope'; that made me hopeless. I knew I was getting close to committing suicide. Long story short, I had an encounter with God that I can't even properly describe and it was like everything just broke off me, literally in an instant. I haven't been depressed since; that doesn't mean I don't have days when I'm sad, and I still have to work on fixing mentality stuff (like wrong thought patterns, self-esteem, ect.) but I realize now that nothing is or was wrong with me.  I'm not saying it's the same for everyone. I'm no expert, and I know different people have different issues, but here's my advice: don't let that label define you. It's just a name someone gave to a group of symptoms. Don't let it make you hate yourself, or feel as though you haven't made progress. As others have said, misdiagnoses happen.

Bpd doesn't develop because of anything you did wrong, so please don't add guilt or shame on top of an already difficult situation :)   Most of us fall in a spectrum, even with bpd traits. A lot of people have them, and maybe you have some traits too. Radically accepting you have some traits (if you do) and trying to understand why can be life changing. Bpd can be fixed and a diagnosis doesn't exist so you feel worse about yourself. No, it exists so you can get better and live a life you never imagined. The distorted thoughts and pain will begin to subside. Bpd is very painful and requires treatment. And it's usually the product of emotional, physical and/or sexual abuse, particularly abandonment, even as a very young child.   As children we are so sensitive to our attachments with parents and other figures, and even the threat of losing this can be devastating. People who develop bpd are not bad- on the contrary, they are in deep pain, and many were abused, neglected, mistreated, abandoned, etc.  It sounds like you may not even have bpd, and I'm not trying to say you do. Perhaps you can talk with your doctor or a therapist in detail about this, so you can gain a better understanding of what thought patterns and traits you exhibited that may have led to this as a possibility. If you have any traits, they are not your fault but the product of upbringing and even genetics or both, and nothing that can't be fixed in a compassionate way. You aren't alone in this at all. If anything, it could be the start of a life changing experience. I should know, because I was ""diagnosed"" as having some bpd traits related to my attachments toward people (anxious and nervous and needing to befriend all people) that were from a childhood of losing people often. With therapy, it is better. I can live my own life now. I was never taught how to get better or see clearly, and someone has helped me with that. It's only been 4 months."

I do enjoy visual communication but I don't know if it makes output of ideas any easier for me.  I have been told I talk with my hands a lot and even made a post about it here!   https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/204fp1/fellow_infjs_do_you_talk_with_your_hands_a_lot/?ref=search_posts

I had always associated this with having a Spanish father and growing up with Spanish culture.  I understand what you are meaning when you say "" I do enjoy visual communication but I don't know if it makes output of ideas any easier for me."" I do pause while communicating in ASL, but this has more to do with making sure I am not using PSE(pidgin sign language), but when I finish communicating an idea using ASL that idea is totally understandable and clear vs. in English I am still left with the feeling "" Did they understand what I was trying to explain?"""

I write a fairly well-known blog on ASOIAF, and I definitely relate to writing as a hobby and in preference to speaking.  However, it varies depending upon the scenario. Some INFJs (like myself) are somewhat 'covert'... meaning we can pull off public speaking without too much difficulty. In my career as a technology educator I have become quite capable in this regard.  I would say that INFJ quietness is much more manifest in places like team meetings, classrooms, group dinners, etc. I am very much the kind of person who listens and approaches people afterwards, than the type to brazenly interrupt with a criticism."

I spent 8 years in HIV education for clinicians and now have my dream job working on an initiative in Alzheimer's primary prevention.  We collect a thousand descrete data points per doctor office visit and use the electronic medical record database to make prediction models or study which drugs work best for which people based on their characteristics.  On a social level many other scientists are awkward too, so that's always a trip.  I'm honestly awful in math...seriously seriously awful.

Feeling types would try their damndest to minimise redundancies, even if it means taking longer to get back on their feet.  Thinking types make the necessary cuts to get back in the black as quickly as possible.  That doesn't mean that Feelers don't think about the practical implications of their actions or that Thinkers don't feel bad about the job losses.

You can, of course, through practice become very good at your inferior functions, but you can never retype, because your core never changes.

My practitioner told me lots of people can confuse themselves because they can be very good at using their inferior preferences in day to day activity, but that's not their ""true"" MBTI because it's not what they naturally gravitate to.  For example, he is an INTJ, but the first time he did the MBTI he came out as ENTP because of his job.  When he went through his results with his test administrator, he realised that a lot of his answers were things he was good at--not what he preferred to do.  For example, I'm good at logic.  I can out-logic and out-technicality with the best of them, and I can use logic as a base for my decisions without including my gut and feelings in to the equation.  I can present facts to a board meeting and recommend a course of action.  However, that's totally not my preferred way of doing things.  I'd much rather go with my gut.

infj,3a8smn,pseudomuffin,2,Thu Jun 18 20:03:21 2015 UTC,"Date both of them?  Sorry, I realize that may not be helpful to other people. But you should know that it is possible to be a happy, bisexual, INFJ with one of each sex (like a matching set! Yes!) just in case you were wondering.  More to your point; if you are a mono type of person then that decision of who you want to devote more time to is going to have to come from a lot of experience with them. It's hard for us to open up, it takes a long time, and by the time we've figured out ""Ok, yeah, I'd like to be exclusive with you"" yes I think it's entirely possible to also be experiencing that with another person as well. Try not to overthink it is the only answer I can give. Who do you feel more connected to? Who makes you feel more comfortable, or conversely uncomfortable but in that way that makes you feel like you are growing as a person?  Hope this helps at all."
infj,3a8smn,Super_Brownie,6,Thu Jun 18 03:38:17 2015 UTC,"Date both of them?   As someone who has been in a poly relationship, this is a valid answer. Though currently in a monogamous relationship, I was open with my partner about my ability to love more than one person at a time. I told them that the choice to keep our relationship monogamous or non-monogamous was his to make. (Since I was comfortable operating under wider circumstances.)    More to your point; if you are a mono type of person then that decision of who you want to devote more time to is going to have to come from a lot of experience with them.    This. I tend to emotionally value all of my friends the way I value my partner, with the only difference being that I am physically/romantically affectionate toward my partner.  Another method is to get everyone comfortable spending time together. It will increase the amount of time you can spend with those you care about. It also helps foster positive group morale."

Then I also met another girl a week later and also went out on a few dates (this was all ""get to know you stuff"").    The second person I wanted to get to know more on a romantic level thus ""hanging out"" was going to be tough.  So invited girl #1 out to dinner and explained that I enjoyed her company but had feelings for someone else.  Girl #2 is now my wife, Girl #1 is happily in a relationship.

In this instance, I believe the rules are justified and there for a reason so I'm not going to ""do what they tell me"" and ignore the policies. :P  I mean, I also kind of feel like even if it's NOT justified, you don't just discard it.

infj,3a6xyy,Intempestivity,3,Wed Jun 17 19:22:25 2015 UTC,"Depends on the rule.  Most INFJs will follow rules that they feel are important and tend to rebel against policies and rules if they don't see a purpose for them.  In contrast, ISTJs need to follow the set rules and policies until they are told a reason not to; they don't really care if there's a purpose for them or not.  If there is a legitimate reason for the rules and policies and other people don't follow them, it can really piss off an INFJ.  For example, if there are checks and balances in place to ensure that something's done correctly, and if it's not done correctly it will result in damage either to people or the company, and people are ignoring those checks and balances to take a shortcut, an INFJ will be haranguing their asses to complete those checks."

If the rule is stupid and enforced I'll bitch about it being an inconsistent rule until it gets changed.   People that just follow rules blindly and are rule nazi's are no fun at parties and I question their critical thinking. For example at the arrivals at an airport. There is a place next to where arrivals show up at that says ""no parking or waiting"" and it's never enforced and there's tons of people there always waiting and parking.   So I could A go find a place I'm allowed to park at or B wait there and if my arrival shows up before I get yelled at I can get my arrival quickly and all is peaceful. If I get yelled at I just move and repark somewhere else. It's stupid to have that rule there because now you're forced to either enforce it or the rule is pointless. Enforcing it costs tons of resources tho, and what does the airport gain?  Maybe some good knowledge on which people they should probably frisk in the security lines based on knowing if they follow all the rules or not?  That's the only positive I can think of lol"

infj,3a6xyy,Intempestivity,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:36:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, no. The dictionary definition of ""policy"" is a deliberate system of principles to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes. A policy is a statement of intent, and is implemented as a procedure or protocol.  I don't have to agree with it. It's set in place -- in the place of work, anyway -- by higher ups far beyond a peon's pay grade, and if you want to remain employed there, you're expected to follow it. It just depends upon how large or small the policy breaking is and who catches wind of it. :P  The problem is when people in clinics continually break policy because it suits them, but others in other clinics are following the broad requirements, you're in the middle.  You get the people you work with snarking at you (or low level managers) because you won't just do what they want, which makes shit unpleasant; you have to defend yourself and your pushing is seen as a problem. When you go with peer-pressure and do what the people in the trenches that you work with are telling you to do, the ""brass"" (so to speak) snarks at you for not following the organization rules.   It's a matter of knowing when to make waves where, but the purpose of my question was because I wish everyone would just do what's set up in the guidelines as they said they would when they were hired. :P"

INFJs would be holding meeting after meeting with the top brass to see how they could improve the policy so that it's meaningful and people are more likely to stick to it.

infj,3a1lzt,KStreetFighter2,9,Tue Jun 16 14:57:12 2015 UTC,"Overall, I really like this write up and I think most of it is spot on.  I do have an issue with some of your descriptions of the feeling functions though.  In a number of places you associate feeling functions with emotions and these two things are not necessarily interchangeable.  It is my understanding that feeling functions have more to do with value based judgments and almost nothing to do with any underlying emotion behind that judgement.    Interpretations such as this lend themselves to seeing thinking functions based on pure logic as cold and dispassionate with feeling functions, conversely, being fiery and emotional but I think that if you merely observe people using either logic or value based reasoning you will find that each are equally as emotional about things they care about/find interesting."
infj,3a1lzt,random_parallel,4,Tue Jun 16 17:26:42 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right, and I think it's my fault for using imprecise language. I did use emotions as examples because generally that's how the feelings, well, feel. But the reason I used the word ""feeling"" is because in my mind that also encompasses things like morality and values.   A more precise way of describing the difference between thinking and feeling in terms of MBTI would be objective evaluation vs subjective evaluation."
infj,3a1lzt,random_parallel,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:13:19 2015 UTC,"I did use emotions as examples because generally that's how the feelings, well, feel.   I totally understand that. I think Jung and others did a dis-service by using the feeling nomenclature to refer to values based judgments.   A more precise way of describing the difference between thinking and feeling in terms of MBTI would be objective evaluation vs subjective evaluation.   I always thought objective simply referred to extroverted functions and subjective to introverted.  As in, extroversion deals primarily (solely?) with ""objects"" i.e. ideas, people, etc... in the external environment while subjective deals with the individual ""subjects"" ideas, observations about people, etc...  I could be totally off base about that though."
infj,3a1lzt,random_parallel,2,Tue Jun 16 18:24:00 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree that thinking and feeling are terrible words in general as they are both intellectual functions.   As far as introversion vs extroversion goes, it more has to do with the application of a function. For example if you use Ti you are concerned with the logical consistency of ideas, if you use Te you are concerned with the most logical way to implement ideas. The users are either applying the thinking function to the ""inside world"" or the ""outside world""."
infj,3a1lzt,_mildude,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:39:16 2015 UTC,"I was more referring to your use of subjective to describe feeling and objective to describe thinking functions.  AFAIK both thinking and feeling can be subjective or objective depending on the orientation in which they manifest.  sorry if this is nitpicking, after my fourth cup of coffee in the afternoon I can sometimes get a little... analytical"
infj,3a1lzt,bezald,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:09:43 2015 UTC,"introverted functions are also referred to as subjective and extroverted functions are also referred to as objective, yes."
infj,3a1lzt,justanontherpeep,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:12:37 2015 UTC,"I like love analysis and in depth discussion! I used the Ti vs Te example to try to illustrate that no matter if the function is applied to the outside world or the inside world, thinking as a rule is still based in objective facts and logic.   In contrast, whether or not feeling is applied to the inside or outside, it will still be subjective. In this case subjective only means that it takes into account someone's (again internally or externally) emotions, values, morals, etc. instead of objective facts and reason.  It's important to note that everyone uses both things; every person has to be able to look at things objectively and subjectively to some extent, MBTI is only going to tell us what someone prefers to use."
infj,3a1lzt,justanontherpeep,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:13:47 2015 UTC,"I definitely think it's complicated because Fi, which is technically about values; also seems to correlate quite strongly with actual feeling. Of course, theories aren't immutable and people will have their own takes on them over time and whanot... I guess it's good to emphasize that they aren't exactly about feelings but there is definitely a relation. or... something? idk, all of this ends up in kind of fuzzy territory"
infj,3a1lzt,justanontherpeep,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:39:50 2015 UTC,"Yea, the reason I used ""feeling"" is because I've found that most feeling types will ascribe an emotional reaction to their values. That's why when strong feeler types (like INFJs and INFPs) talk about their morals, they are often said to be ""passionate""."
infj,3a1lzt,zenlittleplatypus,3,Tue Jun 16 21:16:32 2015 UTC,"/u/KStreetFighter2 thank you for taking the time to write this.  I have some questions (which are not meant as me being mean, I'm asking out of curiosity)... where do you get this info from? how did you come to these statements? can you list sources and how you arrived at this article?"
infj,3a1lzt,Thunder_54,2,Tue Jun 16 16:35:13 2015 UTC,"You're certainly welcome, I enjoy doing it. I love the stuff so I've done a lot of my own research. Generally I read, watch, or listen to whatever I can find on the subject just because it's an interest of mine. When I write a post like this, I try to describe my own understanding of the topic, which is why I don't source anything. So take it as you will, I know I take everything I read (especially online ) with a grain of salt."
infj,3a1lzt,morningchuu,2,Tue Jun 16 17:26:56 2015 UTC,"fair enough - I didn't see that and it just helps me out a bit when reading stuff.  What is hard is when I see stuff that's written in the definitive however I pick up it's in the subjective.    I think what you have is pretty good, well written, well thought out but it helps for me to know these are your own thoughts (which is like perfectly A-OK, right? It's just a subjective way vs a definitive way).    I think a lot of this personality stuff is highly subjective to begin with very little hard evidence (a lot of posts are ""I know a girl who's an infj that does XYZ, therefore ALL infjs do XYZ"" which is simply untrue).  but then again, if I didn't care about infjs, I wouldn't be here myself.    thanks for posting again, I enjoyed it"
infj,3a1lzt,joantheunicorn,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:06:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly thank you for the criticism; it might have been a little over zealous of me to use the word ""definitive"" but I only meant that it would help (hopefully) help anyone unsure about INFJ/P figure themselves out.   And I completely agree, I think a lot of stuff is subjective in MBTI, it definitely paints in broad strokes. I try to stay as analytical as I can and always make sure I mention that a person is still an individual no matter their type to compensate."
infj,3a1lzt,EverydayMusic,2,Tue Jun 16 21:09:20 2015 UTC,"well I'm not knocking any of your research, a lot of it I agree with... what I would love is for a team to sample data from 1000s of personality types (of the same type).  You know ""based on 1000 infjs responses to XYZ""    But please never stop observing, learning and growing in your passions."
infj,3a1lzt,otwu,2,Tue Jun 16 22:27:23 2015 UTC,"YEP! I'm an INFJ, and that proves it. :)"
infj,3a1lzt,jeff233,2,Tue Jun 16 14:58:12 2015 UTC,I will be honest I have always identified as an INFJ but after this post and scouring the Internet some more I identify with both INFJ and INFP. I have taken the MBTI multiple times throughout my life and always ended up as an INFJ (except for one time I somehow managed to get INTJ).   After reading your description as well as this article I found I am beginning to question what type I actually am. Seeing as how I identify with each type it's tough for me to tell.

infj,3a41jh,SureAviator,3,Wed Jun 17 01:42:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm just disgruntled lately, but I wouldn't take anything if it was possible for me to change types. I'd much rather be ESTP like in a heartbeat. I hate knowing too much & feeling too much & my own standards are restricting but I can't see not following them, & can't stop thinking about the future. I'd rather live today for today"
infj,3a41jh,inefjay,8,Wed Jun 17 20:42:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if it's necessarily an INFJ thing, or just a ""me"" thing, but I have boundless empathy. I truly love to know other people's life stories, thoughts, and opinions, and am mainly a listener in conversations. I know that my friends (and complete strangers that I have met) also appreciate this trait."
infj,3a41jh,SmokeAndWishes,2,Wed Jun 17 05:21:53 2015 UTC,Totally agree with this. I find it hard to walk away from a conversation with a new person when they're easily talking about their life story. I always have so many different questions.
infj,3a41jh,Sublimebro,5,Wed Jun 17 23:30:42 2015 UTC,"This is really hard to answer.  I like myself. All of my personality... my thoughts, my inner world, my empathy, my precise judge of character.  I would never imagine switching to any other ""type"". I wouldn't be myself.  ...that in itself is scary to think about"
infj,3a41jh,EverydayMusic,3,Wed Jun 17 04:35:32 2015 UTC,"I like being able to predict how people will behave, despite having just met them, or knowing little to nothing about them from an objective standpoint. I dislike not being able to brag about this talent to others, because I can't for the life of me articulate how I knew that so-and-so was going to do such-and-such, so they just think I'm nuts ;P"

I also like that I can just go off in my head somewhere and ""leave earth"" for a while.  No need for exotic vacations, they exist in my mind."
infj,3a41jh,justanontherpeep,2,Wed Jun 17 13:42:46 2015 UTC,"I love everything about being an INFJ, but my favorite thing is my compassion.  I care so deeply about other people.  It can be exhausting, but the world needs a few bleeding hearts like me.  I can touch a lot of lives, in both big and small ways, and to me it's the most fulfilling thing imaginable."

infj,3a4rpa,perfectIie,4,Wed Jun 17 05:41:15 2015 UTC,"I was enjoying the article up to the point where the writer talked about INTJs and their functions and said ""can you say schizophrenia?"". This came off as sarcastic, callous to people who suffer schizophrenia-like symptoms (I don't even think its in the DSM anymore?), rude to INTJs, comparing functions to a significant and debilitating mental health issue and just unrelated/unprofessional if they are going for a professional-type level of understanding in their articles."
infj,3a4rpa,joantheunicorn,2,Wed Jun 17 14:10:50 2015 UTC,"And I'm not even going to bother reading the article now, thank you for saving me the time."
infj,3a4rpa,bazoril,1 point,Sat Jun 20 10:36:13 2015 UTC,"No, you're not alone. I respect my Fi but I listen to my Fe more. Fi doesn't show up unless I'm in my room, discovering my inner world only to discover how emotional overwhelming I am with it. Right now Fe and Fi are in conflict but I'm going to listen to my Fi because it will help me with this situation that I'm currently dealing with. My Fi world is doing all right (and I think they're quite sturdy) unless I'm tapping into very old memories where Fi has not been dealt with. I also notice they are very private and I have yet to express them to anyone."

infj,3a4rpa,jesusstartedinagarag,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:47:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think the author of that article understands much about the subtleties of INFP and INFJ.  There is an extraordinary amount of overlap and even people who spend their whole lives studying type have to discern carefully between the two depending on a person's other proclivities.  In another article they relegate INFP love to soft, ""puppy-dog-eyes"" love which is a serious over-simplification.  I would tend to think that if you relate more to Fi than Fe that you are most likely an infp rather than coming up with a completely new theory about how Fi is stealing its way up the functional stack of an infj."
