Drugs,3dzwsq,long_wang_big_balls,10,Tue Jul 21 03:42:18 2015 UTC,"The reason I never got parole after going back was that she came to my hearing and said she was scared of me getting out. I actually wanted her there. We had mended our relationship and I had a home plan, a job and one of the local pastors of a church come to my parole hearing in 2007. I was on my way out the door man. Then the parole officer after hearing everything asked if anyone else had something to say. The cunt raised her hand and said she was scared about me getting out. The parole officer asked, About what? She says, ""I'm scared he won't talk to me right?"" TALK TO HER RIGHT!? Stupid fucking bitch. Parole says, ""Oh, so your not scared of physical harm, right?   ""No comment.""  The parole officer looked at her and said, ""Thank you so much for being here thus morning Mrs. Bitchfromhell. I know it's been a struggle for you during this."" He then looked at me very quickly and rendered his verdict. I'm going to recommend that you come back in January 2009. It was 2007 at the time.   I never talked to her again. When I got settled in at prison about a year later I started talking to one of the legal law clerks. He said he could help me fill out all the necessary paperwork for divorce. He was just another convict that had been locked up for 30 years and had learned how to navigate the court system behind bars. And he was pretty damn good. Real nice guy. He had killed his mom with an axe.   Anyways, he got it done for me and I paid him 11 bucks in honey buns. He didn't even want them but I gave them to him anyways.   January 2009 comes around and one morning one of the CO's tells me to get my blues on. Says it parole day. I tell him I'm not going. A lot of guys heard this and even the CO is like, ""What?""  I told him I want going. ""You have to go"", he says.    ""Okay, but I'm going to tell them to eat shit. ""  ""Uh, okay. You don't have to go."" he said with a bewildered look.   I was the talk of the unit that day. I only had a year left and with good time coming back to meet me I was going to be out in July. I could have taken parole and then had a 4000 dollar fine to pay within a year. Fuck that. I had been on the particular unit for 2 years and was comfortable with everyone there. Why put myself through such a financial burden with the chance of violating if I didn't pay? I wanted parole 2 fucking years ago and had everything set up for me to succeed. So I just waited.   When I got out in July I went to stay with my parents until I could get on my feet. Nobody would hire me. Job after job after job said that policy prevented them from hiring me. I finally saw an add in the paper for taxi drivers. I went and applied and they couldn't have given 2 fucks. I ended up doing that for 4 years. It was actually one of the funnest jobs I've ever had. I still moonlight on the weekends because that shit just gets in your blood. Being a part of a city, having a free pass to go anywhere at anytime, driving drunks, sorority girls, drug dealers and prostitutes around is just exciting. It feels like you're still part of the game. And I can kick people out of the cab, we can pull over and go to to toe if you want, you want to act crazy, I can act crazy. It's just fucking exciting. Most people talk a lot of shit in the cab and want to test you. Most people don't realize I'm 6'3 and 230lbs until I get out if the cab. Most everybody calms the fuck down when I get in their face on the side of the road. Not everyone, but most. Those that don't, I just get in between them and the door that they always leave open, close their door and then return to the drivers seat and leave them there. I've only come to blows once. The guy pulled out fucking little wrench and swings at me. He's so drunk he can hardly stand up straight. I took his wrench away from him and threw it like Brett Favre about a mile away. Pretty sure it was a spiral. I pushed him and he fell right over cussing and hollering. I got in my car and left. It's some shit like that every time I drive and I love it.   But you are right, the wife was the worst."

Drugs,3dzwsq,xNuckingFuts,36,Tue Jul 21 19:28:22 2015 UTC,"I've never hated a baby so much. One guy thought he was going to be cute one night. There was an Officer, Corporal Hill. He was bar none the most sadistic meanest motherfuckers I had ever met.   The worst thing about boot camp was standing at attention. We would have to get at the end of our racks an hour, half hour before count time. Then they would come around to each squad Bay and make us count off.   SIR ONE, SIR!  SIR TWO, SIR!  And on and on until everyone had been counted. And we would have to stand there until count cleared which might take another hour. Just fucking standing there for 2 hours. 3 times a day. Well one night Corporal Hill steps out of the Squad Bay to take a break from his usual glaring at us from his desk. The fucking guy would make us stand there for hours and just sit there and stare at us for hours hoping that we twitched or let our eyeballs drift away from perfect center so he could scream, ""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU LOOKING FOR? OH, YOUR BABY?! IT'S UP HERE DICKWAD. COMES GET IT AND BABYSIT FOR 4 DAYS.""  This one guy decided to take advantage of the 40lb baby on his shoulder while Satan himself is gone. He chucks the baby on the concrete and starts kicking it. There were 50 guys in that squad Bay trying not to fucking break out in laughter like they were at a Louis C.K. show with guns to their heads. I was gasping air between my closed lips and then I saw it. Corporal Hill was at the window smoking a cigarette watching this whole brew haha. He came in around 10 seconds later and cussed this kid worse than I've heard anyone take a verbal reaming. The poor guy ended up having to carry the fucking thing for a month and he had an extra 2 weeks added to his outdate. They charged him with destruction of state property.   Fuck it was funny though. ."

Also, no way in hell anything other than MJ is staying in municipal courts unless evidence disappeared and was never lab tested. I was one lucky fuck when it came to punishment and courts, but I was unlucky as hell about getting busted. That was my last drug charge, and after several priors, I am pretty sure jail would have finally ensued."

Drugs,3dzwsq,RuffRyderRoll,30,Tue Jul 21 00:51:03 2015 UTC,"Don't fucking do it.  The price you will pay is absolutely higher than you can imagine. My grandmother dies while I was locked up. My mom asked me if I wanted for her to try to get me a furlough for the funeral. If you go to a funeral, you are handcuffed and shackled in your prison blues and when you arrive your family is asked to leave the viewing for you to be alone for up to an hour and then back to prison. I wasnt about to do that to my family. I also missed my little sister going through high school. I missed several years of her life and it is one of my deepest regrets. We have a great relationship now. She finished up her undergraduate at UT and now lives in Memphis and is working on her law degree.   The fun I had selling drugs couldn't ever compare to the years away from my family and the people that loved me. I was 4 hours away from my hometown and you don't want your family coming up to visit a whole bunch not only because it's hard on them but it's hard on you to get that familiar feeling of being with family and then to watch them leave. It is fucking Hardcore rip your Guts out type shit. It never was and never will be worth it.  But if you're going to do it, you must be prepared that it's all going to blow up in your face in an instant. And I say be prepared because it's probably going to happen."

Just a hunting knife, nothing badass. About 4"" long. I completely forgot I was wearing it, just put it on in the morning like I had been doing when I was camping. A cop snatched me up and put me in lock-up saying it was an illegal weapon. The knife wasn't even illegal, but he claimed it was over length. A lawyer ended up getting the case dismissed, but it cost me exactly $1000. After it was all over, I asked him, can you please give me a break down of how much time you spent on my case? When he did,  it added up to way less than the thousand I had given him, so I said, now that my case is over, can I have the rest of the money back. He explained that's not how it worked. So I said, well, as long as you still owe me like five hours of your time, you can be the one to go down to the court house and get me copies of all my paperwork.  After it was all over, I made a point of going down to city hall to collect the knife from evidence. It was only like a $25 knife and it was a big hassle to claim it, but fuck if I was going to let them take my knife."

That was a well-told tale. What kind of background are you from? It felt middle-class ish but you don't give much of a feel for the environment you live.

Drugs,3dzwsq,AnusDefiler,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:47:54 2015 UTC,"Keep him on the straight and narrow. You usually get out on probation leaving a boot camp and not parole. The difference is the street time. On probation none of the time on the streets counts against your actual sentence. So if you've got a 6 year sentence and do a year locked up and are kicked out on probation, well, if you do 4 years and 11 months on the street and violate you have to start back over from where you left off. Parole on the other hand is like doing time on the streets. The time you are free counts against your actual sentence. 10 year sentence with 5 locked up and 4 on parole means you only have a year left either way."

I literally saw fight or flight come into his being. He did what he always does. Gave me a big hug and said he was so glad to see me. I just shrugged it off and asked if he had any weed. He pulls out a blunt and I told him to introduce me to everyone of his new friends. He just told them I was a good friend from back in the day. He wanted me see some of his new work. I puffed on the blunt for awhile. I just kind of stood there wondering why the fuck I as there. He went into the house to do something and I just left.

Whenever if get drunk I wouldn't get a hangover, and even more surprising, Every time I've done MDMA I usually feel pretty good the next. The closest I've come wo a hangover would probably be when I went to the end of semester pub night (which was on a Thursday night with school the next day) and I only got 2 hours of sleep. The next day was probably the worst I've felt in my life, but that's just because I was exhausted."
Drugs,3e3uwi,Wolfmans_Brotha,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:42:59 2015 UTC,You're also really young so your body bounces back quicker. I'm 20 and have drank thousands of times. I used to have a drinking problem along with one of my friends. Each time we drank we would just split a handle of Captain throughout a night. I never felt hangovers but now whenever I drink I get a headache the next day. Still nothing compared to what some of my friends get though. Just never use this as an excuse to take more drugs tho. It still has all the negative effects on your body even if you don't feel it the next day

Drugs,3e2nlp,itsyaboyshamoun,5,Tue Jul 21 16:13:38 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Potency cannot be reliably guessed most of the time due to the plants' variable potency. In low doses achieved through smoking or as an additive in ayahuasca brews, it will likely be much more pleasant than just taking down a bunch of seeds.  From Erowid's Datura dosage page:   As a general rule, Erowid neither recommends nor discourages the use of any psychoactive, however, in the case of tropane alkaloid-containing Solanaceae plants, we think it is important to note that an overwhelming majority of those who describe to us their use of Datura (and to a lesser extent, Belladonna, Brugmansia and Brunfelsia) find their experiences extremely mentally and physically unpleasant and not infrequently physically dangerous.  There is no way to guess a reasonable dose, because potency of the plant material itself and appropriate dose for an individual appear to vary so much. The question of what ""reasonable"" means for something that so often leads to such ridiculously negative effects is hard to say.  As an admixture plant in some traditional ayahuasca brews, smoking blends, or other preparations, parts of these plants are generally used in very low doses. Because of the serious adverse consequences associated with tropane alkaloids (scopolamine, atropine, hyoscyamine) intoxication and the wide variation in doses used, we are unwilling to even speculate about specific dosages for the leaves, flowers, and seeds of these plants.  If you are considering ingesting Datura-group plants, please read extensively from the collected experience reports and never take them without a reliable, sober sitter who understands the likely health issues and who can stop you from walking in front of traffic. Please note that fatalities from ingesting Datura do occur and hospitalizations seem to be quite common, in spite of the relatively low rates of psychoactive use of these plants."

The below is a transcription, so all errors are mine.   I'm sorry, but I honestly laughed for a good minute when you asked if angel's trumpets were comparable to shrooms. I don't mean to belittle you, but thank God you came here for advice before you started picking flowers [...] it's not a trip at all. It's like constantly waking from a dream, only to wake up in another dream; there is no way to tell what is real or when it will end.   In my head, I'm at my grandmother's house, having a real conversation with her. I can smell ham baking in the oven. I can hear her voice. I can feel the chair under my ass, and then the next second my friends are holding me down because they said I was throwing all the beer into the campfire whilst screaming obscenities. Then I think I'm okay, I'm fine, I've got a handle on this.   And for a while, I do, until my 6th-grade gym teacher walks out of the woods and starts talking to me. I'm 25 and had completely forgotten about this guy and what he looked like, but all of a sudden there he was and the campsite around me gradually turned into my middle school gymnasium and for a while I thought I was playing volleyball with a bunch of hot chicks who were obviously not middle-schoolers. In reality, I was rolling around on the ground shoving handfuls of grass into my mouth.   There are no words to describe what it's like to be completely insane for two days and not have any idea what is real.   If you're gonna play with tropane-containing plants, get a whole bunch and grind it finely. Tropanes are notorious for having different concentrations of alkaloids between plants, and even between parts of the same plant. Then start low. Low, low. With a week between doses as you work your way up. Smoking is preferable; you don't want to put any more into your body than you have to to sit there and keep absorbing once you've gone insane. Put the rest of the material out of reach, and don't redose in that session; part of the delerium is feeling totally sober and forgetting that you've even taken anything. Even then, it's best left alone."
Drugs,3e2nlp,galmse,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:40:39 2015 UTC,"I have been curious about datura/jimson weed/etc for years and I've read a lot about the plants.  My opinion is that for the vast majority of drug users it's too dangerous.  Too hard to dose, too long lasting, too strong.  On the other hand, if you use drugs in a ritualistic, ""shaman"" manner there might be some value in it.  Most of the positive reports on erowid are from people who grew the plants and then made a preparation, slowly sampled it, and truly wanted to experience a different realm.    Personally I will not touch the stuff.  I am not interested in a total disconnect from reality or potentially poisoning myself."

People often hold a belief that after 3 days of tripping, you can't trip anymore because of tolerance. Well I managed to trip every day for almost a month straight on magic mushrooms. People online were arguing with me that ""that's not possible.""

Drugs,3e2nlp,Domerican,2,Tue Jul 21 14:55:50 2015 UTC,"Well relating to Datura if you hit one catagory you would most likely hit them all. However with something like LSD you may have a difficult experience while tripping that you get through but it doesn't necessarily mean it was a bad trip. Likewise, your trip could be a Bad Trip because of outside variables but it may not be a Train Wreck. You might move past it and be alright by the end. I think it just splits it up to allow for people to document their experiences in a more specific way. However I do get what you mean as they are all very similar."

When you talk to the doctor tell him - exactly what you took - exactly how much you took - when you took it & tell him everything about your symptoms. He'll know what to do.    Try to stay clear of all drugs for the moment, including coffee, cigarettes and/or vapes.    Edit: I partially retract my statement about staying clear of all drugs - if you have any benzos at hand (diazepam or lorazepam, for example) you can try taking a therapeutic dose, it should decrease your agitation and the seizure-like symptoms.

Drugs,3e3itr,r4cid,0,Tue Jul 21 19:39:47 2015 UTC,"Sounds similar to brain zaps but worse, if I were you I'd see a doctor if it doesn't pass soon and definitely stay off any more drugs."
Drugs,3e3itr,r4cid,0,Tue Jul 21 18:44:50 2015 UTC,What is brain zapps? It feels like electricity shooting through my body right before i drop and have a siezure
Drugs,3e3itr,r4cid,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:50:36 2015 UTC,"They're quite hard to describe but Google it and you should find lots of people describing them on drugs forums like 'bluelight', usually after stopping medications like SSRI's. Here's a definition I found:   Brain zaps: It feels as if your head, brain, or both have experienced a sudden shake, vibration, tremor, jolt, electric shock, or zap. Some people describe the head and brain zaps symptoms as if the brain has been suddenly jolted by electricity or strong electric charge.   My only experience with them is after a two day MDMA binge (~1.5g) the day after I was sitting around watching a movie and it felt like when I really focused my brain would cut out as if I was about to have a seizure. None of mine actually led to a seizure and I'm epileptic so I'm very prone to seizures, so don't stress too much - however I'm not a doctor I'm speaking purely on my experience. Also mine lasted maybe a week but after the first few days they were a lot less frequent. If you drive they could be a real problem though.   My advice would be lay off any drugs for now, and think about seeing a doctor if they don't seem to improve - especially if you live somewhere with free healthcare, it's what it's there for."
Drugs,3e35a0,YeaImStoned,8,Tue Jul 21 16:27:35 2015 UTC,"I'm no psychologist but isn't there a difference between the mental illness depression, and depression caused by a breakup, death, etc...? I'm depressed and I have had good trips on both shrooms and acid. However at those times I had not recently suffered any personal losses.   Correct me if I am wrong, but you said you are getting depressed because of the breakup, so I am assuming you do not suffer from depression, you are just feeling depressed over a breakup.  In that case, my advice is no. Do not trip until you get over your breakup. And trust me you will get over it eventually. Take it from someone who has suffered lots of losses, most were deaths, but I've lost a love once or twice as well. It takes a long time and it can be hell but it ain't the end of the world.  If you insist on this keep the dose low. Do not eat an entire eighth. Take 1.5g or 2g at the most."
Drugs,3e35a0,RectumToucher,0,Tue Jul 21 16:47:03 2015 UTC,"My depression was not caused by the breakup, i should have been clearer about that, I have been feeling depressed ever since high school and have been diagnosed, I am just feeling a bit more sad than I usually would after a break up"
Drugs,3e35a0,RectumToucher,2,Tue Jul 21 16:51:40 2015 UTC,"In that case, I still do not think it is a good idea to use shrooms to get over the breakup, you will more than likely have a bad trip and that could make your depression worse. Wait until you are over her, then you can go ahead and see if shrooms will help your depression. The good trips I've had certainly helped me with mine. The bad ones made it worse for a while, but I never had a life scarring bad trip, and I've had more good ones than bad. Hope this helps. Good luck."
Drugs,3e35a0,dopegame300,4,Tue Jul 21 17:03:19 2015 UTC,"I'm telling you this from experience. If I were you I'd stay the hell away from shrooms. Last time I went in with a positive mindset and throughout the whole trip I was having depressing thoughts that made the trip pretty bad. I've heard this is a lot more common with shrooms than acid. If I were you I'd honestly probably do neither but I think you're safer with lsd than shrooms. Psyches used to be my  favorite until that trip, I ain't touch psyches since. That was over a year ago."

Just a thought."
Drugs,3e35a0,thearlonian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:47:41 2015 UTC,"Second.  I find with disassociatives its easier to take a step back, so to speak, and look at your emotions objectively.  This is still possible with ""traditional"" psychedelics but if you don't have a strong mind you can get sucked into the negative emotions/thoughts and go to really dark places."
Drugs,3e35a0,fuckingliterally,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:58:07 2015 UTC,"A dissociative like ketamine has the most consistent anti- depressant effects IMO. Weed and psychedelics, as someone with depression, causes me to naval gaze far too much. Dissociatives do the exact opposite, but just make sure to use them responsibly. If you prefer or only have access to psychs (dxm is an easy enough to acquire dissociative, but I would understand if downing a bottle of cough syrup isn't your cup of tea), then opt for one that is described as less ""mindfucky"", such as LSD or a 2cx.  Don't underestimate the effectiveness of a sobriety break, but if you want to take on your issues with a substance low- moderate doses of ketamine are useful."

I would recommend a very light LSD trip outside on a beautiful day. LSD makes me appreciate the worlds beauty and not focus on myself or whats going on in my life. i think you need to remember how beautiful life is and how beautiful it is to live rather than do internal reflection on your break up.  stick to mary if you can though, and find one new hobby, just one. that will make the best impact on your life, finding something new to be interested in.

Drugs,3e35a0,justinj90,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:10:15 2015 UTC,"From my experience with mushies, usually whatever mood I am in whem I begin my trip is the mood that is going to be amplified once I start peaking. I have grown my own before and had them in abundance to take whenever, but I would steer clear of them if my mind set or setting was off. There was only one instance where I was feeling a bit down that day and I figured ""hey, mushies always make me feel happy  and able to appreciate life more, let's give them a try!"" So I took them while I was feeling down and all that succeeded in doing was me on my floor going through all the mistakes I have made up to that point in my life. It wasn't necessarily a bad trip, but it didn't lift me out of my slump like I hoped, it just sort of amplified it and made me focus on it. I would have to assume a similar reaction would happen to you, you might relive all those painful moments just amplified to the point of making it worse. I would try mdma if you are set on tripping, I have always felt a rush of euphoria and gratitude for my life and others around me on mdma."

I feel as if my parents personally act as if drug are 'evil' when often times they are quite the opposite; obviously not in this case for you. But I know the negative impact parents' acknowledgement of drug use can have and how easily it tears relationships apart. But in future drink lots of water and consider all possible things that may lead to a bad trip beforehand; make sure you are 100% ready before taking an intense dose of a hallucinogenic or any psychedelic drug at all.

Because I cannot believe how much this trip related to mine. And mine was 75% good and 25% bad. I paniced at the beginning but I calmed down. And afterwards the trip still scared me.

Drugs,3e0z4c,dank_fetus,3,Tue Jul 21 11:55:58 2015 UTC,"Another case of set and setting. Had your mother not come out to bring the trip from 0 to -100, you may have just played around with lovely 'big question' insanity for a few timeless hours.   The first time I dropped LSD with a friend, my mom obviously caught us. This was no THC high. That was years and years ago but I remember my friend crying and going into a negative mindset even though my mother wasn't going to tell his mother that he had been tripping. This dude was freaking the fuck out so hard that he called his mom himself to come pick him up! Fucked himself over.  Seeing my friend freak out brought out my empathetic nature and I ended up actually being very content, because I didn't care about any 'consequences' my mom would give me. I only cared about making the people close to me feel better. It felt right.   The next day though, that shit sucked! I convinced my mom (who drug tested me while I was tripping) that I was only high on weed because there is no way dollar store drug tests have the ability to detect hundredths of micrograms of a lysergide in your urine. Still got in deep shit because 'the devils lettuce will ruin my life.'   After my first trip I:   Fell in love with lysergides.  Learned the utter importance of set and setting.  I've had a 'bad trip' since then at my own place but I absolutely could not imagine how deep in mental hell I could've divulged into if my mom had walked in on me peaking and made me go to the hospital.   I'm sorry you had to deal with temporary insanity anguish. Your mother turned the trip from a learning experience ('difficult' introspective trips are not bad trips, quite the opposite) to a nightmare experience. Instead of waking up the next day and feeling like ""woah."", you woke up the next day with a hospital hell trip on your mind and every uninvited anxiety it brought with it.   The woes of drug demonization. :)  Glad your mom didn't find out you were tripping."

I had no idea how to fast or what that really meant though, so I ended up vomiting, and passing in and out of conciousness for the entire day and night until the sun went down and came up again. 24 hour mushroom trip and I felt like my ego died anytime I tried to fight it I just forgot who and where I was and what I was doing. I lived with my folks too and after 18 hours of being high they came home, and I thought I had come down but as soon as I tried to stand up and act normal for my parents again I forgot who I was and what the nature of reality around me was like, just starting making bird noises and laying on the floor. Parents wanted to take me to the hospital, I somehow convinced them on the ride that I'd be fine in a few hours. Got back home, ate some food, got a lecture about being yourself and not doing things just because they make you cool, and immediately came down. 24 hours layer, as the sun had risen again about an hour before.

Drugs,3dxdq7,tyler896,2,Mon Jul 20 22:35:05 2015 UTC,"There actually was a bit of a Temperance movement in Australia at one stage, and they were successful in passing laws banning alcohol sales in one part of Australia (The Capital Territory) between 1910 and 1928. I think some other states also made attempts to ban alcohol but I don't think the laws ever passed."

Drugs,3dxdq7,tyler896,2,Tue Jul 21 03:41:59 2015 UTC,"I'm really not to sure about why the law was repealed but if you're looking for resources about it this link might be a good start. It lists a number of resources including book which I believe discuss prohibition in Australia. Although it is worth noting that it was a pretty unique arrangement in a couple of ways. The ACT is a tiny area, and so during the time when prohibition was in effect people could easily go across the border to a very nearby town and drink there. Not only that, but it wasn't actually illegal to consume or posses alcohol, just selling it was illegal. So people would go over the border and purchase alcohol and bring it back. Apparently even the laying of the foundation stone for the Capital had a wine list despite prohibition being in effect. From what I gather it seems like most people thought that ending prohibition was inevitable, since it was so easy for people to drink and purchase alcohol legally at a nearby town that it didn't make sense to hold people to a different standard when they lived so closely."

Also, if the dose was given to somebody else (without their knowledge) they'd have no idea. So I'd recommend starting small and working up slowly and if you feel anything then you've done too much.

Seems like you're writing it off entirely because of your tolerance but shit dude, you still took an entire fucking Cheeba Chew Decadose and then went on to drop LSD and MDMA like nothing, as if all three drugs didn't have a reputation for cross-potentiating each other massively. Might be just me but based on my experiences I really don't think edibles (or heavy pot use in general) have much of a place in hyperspace, if you catch my drift. It's not just a candyflip that went wrong here -- the cavalier attitude towards your MJ intake perhaps played a larger role in all this than you perhaps feel comfortable in acknowledging right now. At least, if you have a similar relationship to cannabis that I once did."

I smoke high quality Colorado medical Marijuana all day every day, (not dicksizing, I swear) as well as dab on a semi regular basis, and take edibles, which often have no effect on me at all. I have taken Cheeba Chew deca doses several times before, even before work (I'm a waiter), and been fairly high but fine. It's not as if I'm some lightweight who took a deca dose thinking it was nothing and got his world rocked. I knew what I was in for.   Also, I've started a regiment recently that almost always involves eating high amounts of edibles while on psychedelics. I always find I chain smoke weed while on psychedelics, and can never seem to get as ""high"" (background marijuana high behind the tripping) as I want. Edibles serve to help with that and intensify the trip I suppose. Plus, if I take high dose edibles while not tripping, I usually get tired and pass out, something that can't happen while tripping, so it's perfect."

Only time I've Candyflipped was at Ultra Music Festival this year, and I took the MDMA later than I probably should have, so it wasn't too overwhelmingly crazy... I was planning to push the dose higher and the timing sooner this time, but I think I'll be quite content to stick with just LSD after reading your trip report. The crowd at a Rush concert isn't quite the best environment for being that fucked up.   I took a massive dose of mushrooms last time I saw Rush, and it was a great fucking time... but I did see two grown-ass men get into a fight like right near my group of people.

It's a fiendish, short lived euphoric stimulant and in my opinion really changed rave culture for the worst. Doesn't really have any of the magic that MDMA does.  To replicate the experience of the good old pressed pills that actually had MDMA, I usually mix in about 100 mg of caffeine with my starting dose. You can even do less really. Caffeine has some pretty good synergy with MDMA. You can also mix in some amphetamine, though this will rob away some of the empathogen effects of MDMA. Even 5 mg of amphetamine should be enough, but if it's speed paste you might need more like 20 mg since 75% of that is going to be water weight and inactive cuts.   If you want to really feel ""fucked"" get some MDA."

I could be on a winding road riding for 5 or 6 miles before realizing that the familiar (read as: incontrovertibly and flawlessly identical, as seen in my peripheral vision while not paying attention) lining of trees and evenly spaced houses didn't mean I was still near the start of the road. I would just be lost in my head, eyes half-closed enjoying the breeze, and the roads were all recently done over with asphalt so the uniformity was something that could easily fuck with someone lost in their own head.  That lasts until you get to a steep hill or an intersection with a busy street (or grocery store) where a bunch of people in cars can see you through tinted windows. At that moment, life becomes extremely complicated again. Thankfully, when you get to an intersection with people, you spend a minute or two leaning on the bike without drawing attention to yourself before hitting the crosswalk button, wait for about two minutes to get the walk sign, then half-assedly kick yourself on your bike across the street while all the cars in the street look at you, which takes 15-20 seconds. In first-started-smoking-weed time, that all adds up to about 4 or 5 hours (except for when you crossed the street, which lasted two eternities in your head at the time), so you had plenty of time to ignore the actual situation at hand and contemplate how your bike-riding day went from wicked simple to wicked complicated and how important that must have been"

I got in to a fight with a good friend, could still walk and talk, nothing really unusual. The weird shit started happening after the fight. I started talking to myself, I felt like someone was next to me and i was talking to that person. i couldn't see him, but I was talking about something, can't remember what. I saw a high metal structure that went over the railroad and I climbed it. Still talking. I climbed on top of it and then started walking on a narrow steel beam. Talking to myself, screaming and walking on the narrow steel beam. I was 5 meters above the railroad, If I fell, I would have cracked my skull open on the rails or the concrete. I then climbed down after 15 minutes, kept walking and talking and then I snapped back in to reality. I knew that what just happened was fucked up and stupid. I had no idea why i did any of that and was VERY confused. I was delirious. No idea how i didn't fall. I have no idea why I did any of that.  I have tried to kill people quite a few times when drunk, but thankfully I was either too drunk or people stopped me. Poured motor oil on someones door, but didn't light it on fire. Punched a lot of walls. I think I threw away my new phone. Nothing really seriously horrible or terrible. Don't drink anymore, not going back to that life."

Never happened with meth in the past.   Read up on panic attack vs heart attack symptoms and you'll see that it's very unlikely you suffered a heart attack. I too thought that I did.

I have no recollection of the entire week but I have been shown pictures and messages of my complete insanity and incoherence. No idea how I didn't die honestly.

This manifested itself in me thinking the sun was going down)   Some time between 2 and 4 hours into the trip I began to cry and never stopped until the trip was over.

I've done enough of both, together and separate to know what i'd be in for. I've taken harder drugs and odder drugs. Should have been no problem.  I was wrong  Something happened. I don't know what. 2 hours after ingesting and things just weren't right. I had bad trips before, this wasn't like that.  I wish i could describe the torrent that i faced. I had trips where i questioned my existence and became scared of my own consciousness i handled that fine. I had trips where i was certain i was going to die or already had died, rocking myself back and forth asking mother mary for help.   This time i got lost in some drug storm of hell. My mind was spinning one way and my body the other. My heart wanted to leave my chest and i believed i was on the brink of heart attack and death.   Nothing of this trip resembled what taking dxm would do. There was no dissociation, no trippyness. The benedryl didn't synergize with it, nor did it do what it does when taken alone. Just my body and physical mind being thrown around in a dragging sledge of what i dont know. I desperatly tried to skype with a friend but i couldnt talk anymore. I could only pace around and think the same thoughts that i kept forgetting because who could focus in this.   After having enough of this i had one last hope and thank god for vicodin. I pop 3 pills and whoooooosh, it all disappeared. Everything stopped. My mind and body and soul chilled out and i was back to life."

Drugs,3dzuyj,Ktaostrophe,5,Tue Jul 21 04:32:19 2015 UTC,"This is somewhat long and will probably get lost but... I was trip sitting a friend who was on a large dose of 25i, I had taken him up a local mountain that I knew quite well. We were both on large doses of opiates, smoking weed, and taking whip-its (nitrous). Once we ran out of those things I asked if he had anything else that wasn't 25i so I could get higher and continue to be his mountain guide.  He pulled out a container of pure alprazolam powder (pure xanax). I know this powder was pure because I had been helping the person he bought it from (source) ""prescribe"" it when the source had the alprazolam in 2mg bar form. Now I dont know if you any of you have ever put a 2mg xanax bar on a scale but it weighs out to alot more than 2mg due to the fillers, binders, and other things in the pill. With this powder 2mg of xanax/alprazolam weighed 2mg. Thinking I had a insane tolerance I stupidly laid out a line of it. Eye balling it was about 50-60mg. Last thing I remember was getting to the top of the mountain with my friend. Then I woke up almost 5 days later in my bed facing some of the worst withdrawals of my life. I had apparently gotten home somehow then slipped into a short term coma. Luckily for me my tolerance to benzo's had saved me from dying.  I stopped messing with drugs since then and am almost 6 months sober.  TLDR: Took opiates and 50-60mg of xanax while I was supposed to be trip sitting and slipped in a coma for 4.5 days.  One other noteworthy story from my using days, I'll try to make this one short.  My fourth trip on mushrooms I decided to go for the hero dose of 5g. About 45min in I decided to continued to munch on shrooms until I had ate all we had which was 7g. I was indoors but it was raining outside really hard. Flash forward a few hours and I start sweating profusely and become nauseous. I go into my bathroom and sit by the toilet drenched in sweat. I then lose all sense of time and become convinced that I am not in my bathroom or sweating, the reason I was wet was because I am somewhere outside in the rain and have been for hours. It felt so real I can still remember feeling raindrops. But I was not outside, I was still in my bathroom with friends in my house. Eventually a friend comes in to check on me and calms me to my senses. I go to my bedroom and try to sleep but cant so I just think. I realize I have been doing drugs wrong. I had taken 5g to escape my situation then kept eating mushroom to stay away. I realized I could not keep using drugs the way I was or I would never go where I wanted to in life. Sadly I forgot about this insight from my trip and a few months later had the incident with the xanax I mentioned above but have been sober since then :) Edit: Added shroom story"

I filled the vial/bottle (big dropper) halfway with water and took 10 drops. 15 minutes later I decided to just take it as a shot and slung it back.  5 minutes later I can feel myself coming up so I figured it was the best time to eat a sandwich that had been sitting in my hot car for an hour.   10 minutes after the sandwich I started to feel very sick and went to the bathroom to throw up. The next 4 hours consisted of me puking my guts out to the point there was a little bit of blood. I thought I was going to die and felt terrible because my room was a mess, I didn't want my family/friends to have to clean it up after I died.   I had the most intense visuals.

We broke up & I bought some MDMA cuz I was fiending.   I was blowing through it because I couldn't get as high as I normally do. I thought maybe I just wasn't doing enough. Once it was all said and done, I realized that had been my first time doing MDMA. The powder I'd been snorting with my ex had been meth.  You can do 2-3 grams a night of meth, so since I thought I'd been doing 2-3 grams of ""MDMA"" all along, it didn't end well when I did 2 grams of actual fucking mdma.  The high was nowhere near as intense or euphoric as I was expecting, which is why I kept blowing more and more. Eventually I didn't feel high at all, I just saw heat waves everywhere. You know how you see heat waves above a black top when it's hot as fuck outside? It was like that. I thought my brain was just frying itself. Then I went blind. My shutter vision was so bad my eyes were opening and closing so fast I couldn't see shit. Scared the fuck out of me, fumbled my way to my Xanax bottle popped a few bars and passed the fuck out.  Woke up the next morning, stupidly did another g. Bringing the total to 2 grams of MDMA in 2 days. Same thing happened as the first day.   Next week was the worst of my life. I had horrible brain zaps to the point I had to take off work and I couldn't drive. I had intense auditory hallucinations. I could hear the song I had been listening to while I was getting high playing from every heat vent of every house I went into, so loud and clear it was like I was listening on my iPod when I put my ear up to the vent.  Could not sleep. I would just lay in bed twitching. You know how you jump right before you fall asleep? Like you're falling in a dream? It was like that but every 4 seconds. After a few days when I could finally sleep, I had night terrors so horrible I wish I hadn't slept in the first place. The lack of sleep caused horrible hallucinations, figures moving in the dark and my anxiety was so fucking bad I had to stay wacked out of my mind on Xanax and sleep with all of the lights on. I wouldn't go anywhere in the dark.  Luckily after a week everything went back to normal. (sorta, my short term memory is fried but that could be from othe stuff). Really glad about that too because the brain zaps felt like the onset of a stroke or a seizure or something, for a while I thought I had permanently fucked myself up and I had brain damage or something and would be stuck like that forever.

Drugs,3dzuyj,DrugsAreEdgy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:38:05 2015 UTC,"Alright, not sure how many people will read this, but I'll write it regardless because I think it's just so damn funny.   So me and my boy, my best friend, Brian, were freshly graduated from high school and we were never more ready to party. Where I'm from this usually manifests itself in a week long vacation to our local beach town, dubbed senior week. You called it sweek if you were a cool kid. Anyways, we get to our shitty hotel room and immediately start smoking weed. We don't stop for the rest of the week. We had gone up with 6 tabs of DOc/25i (4 DOc, 2 25i,) two ounces of weed, and a decent amount of various alcohol. As you can expect, we went home with nothing.  The third day we decided it was time to trip fucking balls, so we go to our friends house, where everyone was already peaking. We had both only tripped once before, and we were NOT ready for the mental assfuck that we were about to receive. We were scared shitless. I was on the floor of the bathroom, convinced I was going to vomit, even though I never did. Brian was convinced he was the father of a non-existent family. Then we went to carrabba's for a ""family dinner."" For those who don't know, carrabba's is a terrible Italian chain restaurant with overpriced food. I may have just been tripping hard, but I'm almost certain that the waiter was gay and hitting on me.  After we had all came down, that's when the shit really started to hit the fan. My friend Maddy asks us if we want to do some dabs. There is only one correct answer to this question. So she breaks out the dab rig and brutally takes Brian and I's dabbing virginity. We had been smoking a lot of weed for about the past month, so we had a decent tolerance. So we were handling fine, until we decided to go to a party. We get to the party and it was all the cool kids, jocks, and whatnot that would never talk to us when we were in school. Maddy then conjures up a double honeycomb perc bong, seemingly out of nowhere. Me and Brian exchange a ""Oh shit we have to smoke more"" look. When the bong was handed to us, the badass, popular, high school graduates were vocally surprised about the two nerdy kids taking fat bong rips. This just made Brian and I want to show off. So we tried, and then promptly failed.   After the bong leaves Brian's hands, I can see something different in his face. His mouth was slightly open and his expression was barren and distraught, as if his mom was diagnosed with cancer on the day he got fired. I ask him,  ""Dude are you ok?"" After carefully pondering the answer to this for around 2 minutes he responds, ""no, no"" ""Do you want to go home?"" He can barely shake his head up and down and murmur ""yea""  So now I have to find a ride back to our house at 1am for this asshole. Being only slightly less fucked up than him, I began texting any and every friend I new was in town for the week. By this time the party was getting fucking huge. Kids were showing up in groups of 15+, all passing us as Brian sat lost in his mind on the front porch. He started freaking the fuck out. This was unlike anything I have ever seen. I have seen a girl been so high that she cried because she thought she somehow lost her eyelids, but I have never seen someone as incoherent and just straight fucked up as Brian was on the front porch to this kids house.   Finally I get a call from our friend Dan. I had texted him ""Me and Brian need help"" and then never responded to his 20 some texts. I explain the situation to him and he gets in his truck to come save our sorry asses. I tell him to meet us at the royal farms down the block from the party. We begin walking there, and I realize just how fucked up Brian was. He was stumbling harder than I have ever seen. Harder than when he blacks out. All he is saying this whole time is something along the lines of ""so sora so sora."" I think he meant I'm so sorry, but  idk. When Dan gets there we pile in his car and I tell him the story over Brian constantly repeating ""Dan. YOU'RE THE MAN"" over and over again. We get him inside our hotel room and put him on the couch where he began to vibrate. I'm not fucking joking when I say this, his body began to shake in fucking waves of vibrations. I was kinda scared I had permanently fucked him up.  After all of this, I find my roommate Ric down the hall getting drunk with some of our friends and playing video games. I tell him the story and he gives me a beer. I then took like 6 or 7 shots of baylees and ate some crabs. It was a fun day.  This is the only time I have ever witnessed someone ""greening out."" It was pretty funny. When he woke up the next day I asked him about it, and he said that he didn't remember anything past that fatass bong rip.   tl;dr friend does dabs then smokes weed and becomes the highest I have ever seen anyone be."

I remember feeling like at least 12 hours had gone by, but when I looked at my watch it had only been an hour. when I was finally able to put oone foot into reality, I got up, and staggeredover to mybest friends room to let him try some of this amazing powder.

I was under the impression it was going to be either bunk or weak enough to where my condition would be manageable after a few hours; my only reason for these assumptions was because it came in the form of a sugarcube and I just couldn't believe anyone still sold those.  So of course, I realized it was real L when I started tripping my balls off shortly before midnight and we had to leave to go home at like 2:30 am. Trying to get out of the city was a nightmare because all I saw was a wavy mess of bright lights, tracers from other cars and people running around. Anxiety was through the roof. Once we got out of the city and onto the interstate, the lines on the road started zigzagging and criss-crossing. Holy fuck. Then it starts pouring down rain. Holy fuck! Then the rubber part on one of my windshield wipers starts peeling off! Omg. Finally, the rain stopped, and believe it or not, I actually got used to the crazy visual effects from the striped lines, since I could feel that I was properly centered in my lane. However, I kept getting my attention pulled to the sky by the near-constant lightning. I'm not kidding when I say that this was the wildest display of lightning I've ever seen, with or without LSD. Streaks flashing across the sky, merging with other streaks and ripping around in all directions. Insane!

One friend of mine who moved here from Australia introduced then to us, since weed is apparently so expensive and low quality, they need to chop to conserve weed and get higher.   Personally, i think it's fucking vile. You take beautiful, lovely tasting weed, which tastes even nicer through a nice clean bong, and taint it with dirty, poisonous, addictive cigarette tobacco. Yes, it gets you higher, but it can make you puke (We call it ""chopping out"" and it is not a fun experience).  In summary, the incredibly strong physical addiction that comes from nicotine and cigarettes coupled with the already psychological addiction factor from weed is a sure recipe for nicotine addiction. Something you DO NOT WANT. Smoke weed, it's not nearly as addicting, doesn't taste like asshole, and won't make your bong brown and disgusting and every hit taste like tobacco. Chop water is truly one of the most vile substances on this planet.   If you do chop, I have no problem with you, just don't start others up on that shit. Nicotine addiction os serious shit. My friend from Australia is so addicted that he won't even smoke weed unless he has a cigarette to chop with. And all we do is smoke weed.

Drugs,3dza7i,shikuto,2,Mon Jul 20 22:24:45 2015 UTC,"This report comes from someone who did so much of these drugs that its' almost impossible to tell what caused what. He should be dead!  Now, if we're just guessing, I definitely lay it on the DOC, as the DOX series has tremendously long lifespans at super low doses. Taking 300 mg of a DOX series, even across an entire month, would be insane!  This is why drugs should be legal: no one would bother with these RCs to get high if better alternatives were legal, and thus, people wouldn't almost lose their fucking legs because they wanted to get high and have absolutely no clue what they're doing with untested chemicals that could kill an elephant at these doses.  Shulgin reported activity at the 1 mg range! Normal dose is like 2.5 mg. This is like eating a gram of acid, or downing an entire bottle of jack daniels, five times over! This kid was fucking nuts."
Drugs,3dza7i,Flying_Dutchmann,0,Tue Jul 21 04:20:13 2015 UTC,"I can agree with everything aside the notion that nobody would use DOx series or NBOMes or other current RCs if drugs were legal. There are folks that strongly prefer, say, 25b over LSD.   It's all up the individual preference and what they're looking for in their drug."
Drugs,3dza7i,iAmTheTrip,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:11:26 2015 UTC,"DOC is actually a well respected drug. Unlike the NBOMe series, it's quite safe in moderate doses. I'd certainly try it if other psychedelics were legal."

Drugs,3e0kvn,MethoxetamineLover,14,Tue Jul 21 02:41:00 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you found a clinic to get tested. Just to ease your mind a little, you should know that it is actually extremely unlikely that a needle stick will give you HIV, even if the guy is HIV positive. Probably no greater than about 0.3%, and that would be if you were stuck right after it was used. If it had been sitting out for hours or days and any blood present was dried up the risk is practically ZERO.  I think Hep C is more resistant than HIV but a single needle stick still has a very low chance of transmission.   Needle sticks are a somewhat common occurrence in health care and research settings so there are protocols in place. Consult with the clinic and follow their advice on follow-up testing.   You will probably be just fine :)"

They'll usually have your results back in 3-5 days and it shouldn't cost more than $50 (some places are free). The sooner you find out, the better.

That shit was incredible, probably the purest experience I'll ever have with it.   Now days MDMA is MDMA, but you should still test it. Unlikely you will find pure powdered MDMA on the streets.   Molly used to mean ""MOLecular"" ecstasy, so you just got the powder. Now it's any powder you can eat that will make you feel different. It is extremely easy to cut powder, since you can literally throw any white to off-white powder in and never be able to tell.  Ecstasy is generally used to refer to pills. Which, honestly were the better option as they're still easy to test and you could at least inspect them carefully and look them up online to see what was likely in them.

It's also important to realize that most dealers usually get their supply from another dealer. So now you have to not only trust that your dealer isn't fucking you, but you have to hope that their dealer isn't fucking them. (this really only matters with drugs that can be cut (coke/mdma) or drugs that have a large variety of substitutes (lsd/mdma) because people can save a pretty penny by cutting and using research chemicals in place of their advertised product.  If you can find a reliable source for your drug the only thing to do after that is use it in a responsible manner. im not really going to get into this too much because it's so specific to every drug, but make sure you do your research. For psychedelics make sure you don't have any history of mental illness in your family, for stimulants make sure you don't have any heart conditions that could make you more susceptible to some sort of incident.  TL;DR - Don't trust dealers / get test kits if you want to use something like mdma or lsd to make sure you're getting the right product / do your research on the drug"

Drugs,3dxe6c,Borax,14,Mon Jul 20 09:53:55 2015 UTC,This isn't really breaking news. It's been known for a long time that MDMA is neurotoxic.   23 times a year is a huge use frequency with this drug. Especially sustained over 6.5 years. The recommended amount is 4-5 times a year at most.
Drugs,3dxe6c,Allternator,4,Mon Jul 20 21:04:18 2015 UTC,"EDIT: I just made the calculations again and it's 43 times per year on average, not 23 as the parent comments say. (281 tablets / 6.5 years = 43 tablets/year). If so, my comment below makes less sense.  I agree that this is not really breaking news. Lots of studies have demonstrated that there's a correlation (and possibly a causation) between MDMA use and decreased memory, so the finding of this studies are not really something new and unexpected, but rather further evidence of the known facts.  However, I don't think 23 times a year is a ""huge HUGE frequency"". It's less than once every two weeks, which is a perfectly possible frequency for someone who uses MDMA often but is not a heavy user (e.g. an addict). Given what we know about MDMA, it's a high frequency, but not something that it unrealistic for habitual MDMA users.  In fact, the interesting thing about this study (albeit the sample size is a shame) is that it adds further evidence of the possible risks of MDMA without studying ""pathological"" users that take MDMA very heavily, but studying users that take MDMA with a high but realistically common frequency. The frequency of use of those users is very comparable to the lower end of the ""harm reduction"" frequency of use (1 time per month for 12 times per year)."

Sample size is too small and the causation does not necessarily equate to correlation. The men who take the MDMA could be also excessive drinkers or be less intelligent than the sample size who didn't take the MDMA. You would need a larger sample size and all the men being as similar as possible to each other, aside from taking the MDMA.  Obviously I don't think its completely safe,  but the brain is extremely complicated and it's annoying how because of the status of illicit substances, proper tests cannot be conducted.

It would be good to run it against light users who may do it 3 times a year (which is probably the average if that)  along with binge users who may go heavy for 4 months & then not touch it for several years.

Drugs,3dxe6c,tyler896,3,Mon Jul 20 22:14:49 2015 UTC,"I feel like for every study that says ecstasy is bad, there are studies that tell a different story. Here is a study that came a few months before the one posted by the OP:  http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/feb/19/ecstasy-harm-brain-new-study   However, Halpern was sharply critical of the quality of the research that had linked ecstasy to brain damage. ""Too many studies have been carried out on small populations, while overarching conclusions have been drawn from them,"" he said. For a start, some previous research has studied users who were taken from a culture dominated by all-night dancing, which thus exposed these individuals to sleep and fluid deprivation ‚Äì factors that are themselves known to produce long-lasting cognitive effects. Non-users were not selected from those from a similar background, which therefore skewed results. In addition, past studies have not taken sufficient account of the fact that ecstasy users take other drugs or alcohol that could affect cognition or that they may have suffered intellectual impairment before they started taking ecstasy. In Halpern's study only ecstasy users who took no other drugs and who had suffered no previous impairment were selected.  The resulting experiment whittled down 1,500 potential participants to 52 selected users, whose cognitive abilities matched those of a group of 59 non-users. ""We even took hair samples of participants to test whether they were telling the truth about their drug and alcohol habits,"" said Halpern. ""Essentially we compared one group of people who danced and raved and took ecstasy with a similar group of individuals who danced and raved but who did not take ecstasy. When we did that, we found that there was no difference in their cognitive abilities."" In other words, previous studies highlighted problems triggered by other factors, such as use of other drugs or drink, or sleep deprivation.   I don't believe MDMA is completely harmless - everything in moderation. However, to say its completely harmful without taking into consideration other studies that have been done doesn't give a complete story, especially since the quality of research studies in MDMA has varied in the last 20 so years."

Drugs,3dxe6c,hashmon,5,Mon Jul 20 21:48:02 2015 UTC,"Dutch researchers used MRI scans to study the brains of 10 men in their mid-20s who had taken an average of 281 ecstasy tablets over the previous six and a half years   Based upon the above excerpt, each man on average potentially took ~4 tablets per month those past 6.5 years? If anything, this is just another anti-MDMA article that only shows quantitative data based off of long-term abuse of the drug, and not the long-term usage with harm reduction being practiced."
Drugs,3dxe6c,shitlord_traplord,14,Mon Jul 20 09:55:36 2015 UTC,"Not everything that shows negative results is automatically anti-drug propaganda. I think it's merely a proof of concept. In this kind of research, extremes are often used to determine the major effects and after that there's a place for researching the nuances, such as what happens when you use the recommended harm reduction techniques. There's no point in immediately going there if you don't even know what the primary effects are. So no, it's not an anti-MDMA article. It's just science."
Drugs,3dxe6c,Flying_Dutchmann,2,Mon Jul 20 10:21:02 2015 UTC,"It's a little irksome that pilot studies like this get large scale media interest and are also presented as definitive proof when similar studies which show, for example, the detrimental effect of alcohol on memory don't seem to get as much coverage, if any."
Drugs,3dxe6c,-DR34D-,3,Mon Jul 20 15:54:31 2015 UTC,"The only thing going through my mind is what a damn waste of mdma.........  Doing it that often, surely the negative effects start to encroach on the benefits.  For me, nothing comes close to mdma in terms of feeling so good however I certainly feel it takes its toll on the brain which is why a decent amount of time is needed to recover. I think anyone who has had good mdma will know what I mean, that total rush, the sheer magic absolutely must come at a price.  I have had pills (maybe 40mg if lucky) and a long time ago when I was doing all the dumb things, I went Fri/Sat/Sun with 2/5/8 pills in a day.  By Sunday, even though I had 8 pills, I felt maybe a 1/4 what I felt on the Friday night and the negative effects over the following 3 or 4 days were not good.  They included depression (which I have never had) All I can say is that after that I have huge empathy for people that suffer depression because prior to feeling it myself, I thought well they should just think happy thoughts........how na√Øve of me.  Then I had nausea, muscle weakness & lethargy on top.  Forgot what my point is now.......  **I suppose one thing is not to get in an us versus them mindset. There are too many people who act like drugs are evil & have a very narrow point of view, they believe all the crap thrown at them & never question it at all.  It is important we do not mirror that & try and look at these things objectively even if it shows our lifestyle choices to be in some way detrimental.  Personally if you told me to take 2 years off the end of my life to feel that first time mdma euphoria for one night, it would not even take a thought process, I would trade that experience in a second for that amount of time."

Drugs,3dzudx,yoitsjustin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:07:10 2015 UTC,"I tried a couple of SSRIs (Zoloft and Lexapro) for anxiety and they were both ineffective and had pretty intolerable side effects. Some people certainly find relief from SSRIs, and that's great for them, but I agree with /u/Skippitydoodah that they are total garbage for others. They're uncomfortable to start and stop, too.   Hydroxyzine was also a bullshit drug for me. It didn't even make me tired when it was supposed to, just made me feel shitty in the morning and gave me awful dry mouth.  I'm currently on Remeron (mirtazapine) for anxiety, some depression, and also to help me sleep (it makes you sleepy when you take it). It seems to help a little bit, but weight gain is a very common side effect so if you are concerned about that then stay away. It also gives me dry mouth. Honestly, right now I would not recommend it. It's mostly used for depression, and not anxiety anyway, but I'm going to probably stick with it for another month or so and see how it goes.  For shorter term relief of anxiety I've had decent results with valerian and chamomile for getting to sleep. Effects are subtle and might be underwhelming to you.  Kava kava is another ""natural"" thing you can use for anxiety, but it may cause liver damage during long term or excessive use and I think it is still banned in some countries, though not the US. I have also had some good experience with using this occasionally, but it also sometimes gives me a stomach ache or makes me feel completely lazy the next day (which can be good on a weekend but not good when you need to be motivated to study or work the next day). Even though it's a ""supplement"", (or beverage, traditionally) it has real effects. It can be somewhat intoxicating even, like being buzzed on alcohol combined with a slight sativa buzz too in how it changes visual and auditory perception (but only slightly, like a small hit of sativa, it's not psychedelic or anything).   Honestly, the thing that has helped me the most is continuing talk therapy. Find a good therapist/MFT/psychotherapist that specializes in anxiety, especially in whatever age group/demographic you are in (i.e. teenagers, young adults, students, military veterans, senior citizens...). Try weekly sessions for a while, if your insurance will cover it. If you are a student, see if your school offers counseling for free, do that as often as they will allow, and if it's not enough supplement with a private practitioner. Figure out what makes you feel anxious and teach yourself to deal with those experiences/feelings differently.   In my experience psychiatry is a bit of a sloppy practice, and you have to try a bunch of drugs to see what sticks. My doctors have also been very anti-benzo and I understand why -they are super habit forming and tolerance increases rather quickly. They are also the most helpful thing for me for limited short term use. I keep some on hand that I get from someone else who has a prescription.   I find it best to use drugs to have more fun, not to rely on any in order to feel just ok. I'm still trying to figure this all out myself, so it's just food for thought. Sorry for the long post.   edit: also, sorry for not sourcing any information, but I don't think anything I said that wasn't just opinion can't be found by a quick search online."

The ceiling dose is 25g you won't get any higher anymore you will only make the side effects worst. I always drink a gallon of water a day and it also helped out with the trip made my fully hydrated and had no stomach aches at all and I think this played a big part in my trip by getting rid most of the side effects.

They still have no idea and I took them in high school and now I'm 20. I do drugs every day to kind of combat depression, and id like to be open with my parents about it but they are too judgmental and will probably freak out and not talk to me about personal things. But that's just my issues. I think the best way to tell your parents is to just be open about what is hurting you and your depression, tell them you need help and you feel really bad about taking the pills (if you do, it's okay if you don't), but just be calm about it and ask them for help if that;s what you want.

We barely talked the entire time and he obviously didn't trust me anymore.   Time healed it obviously, we are on good terms and he trusts me now. But that was like 6+ years ago. My advice; stop stealing his medication. It's more trouble than it's worth, you certainly don't want to ruin that relationship.   As for telling them, come clean. Tell your dad you have a problem. You've been feeling very depressed and you need help. Admit about taking the drugs, tell him your sorry, and if he's a good parent he'll help you get the help you need."

Take a .5mg, which is a totally normal dose for a first-timer, and see what it does. You will likely come the ""oh, I get it now"" conclusion. But if you're a person with chronic anxiety, be careful, as these drugs are not to be taken regularly for more than a month. It's very easy to become attached to the sense of normalcy that washes over you when it hits your system  All of this said, you could probably eat all of those pills in one gulp and simply sleep for a day or two, save for reckless behavior that sometimes happens while blacked out. It's a very safe substance in general. BUT, just don't let it become a habit. Anecdotes on this forum will provide you plenty of evidence as to why not to take 'em regularly."
Drugs,3dya0b,bj_dnm,2,Mon Jul 20 17:19:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with both of /u/LossForwards' comments here. There's always a small risk that you could have an adverse effect (as with any drug/medication) but 0.5 mg is a fairly conservative dose, and you probably won't even notice much of an effect other than a subtle decrease in anxiety.   If you still feel nervous about taking the drug you could crack a tablet in half and try 0.25 mg a few days before you fly. Do it a couple of hours before bedtime so if it does make you sleepy it's ok.   If you tolerate that without any issues (which is most likely) then go ahead and take the 0.5 mg when you fly, as advised by your doctor. If one tablet does not calm your nerves after an hour or so it's probably ok to take another, but consult your doctor about that possibility. If you take too many you will probably be fine, just go into a very deep sleep and forget anything that happened before you took them. To prevent that, maybe only take as many as you will need for the whole trip (like 2 for there and 2 for the return trip, and one extra, leave the rest at home). That way you will not accidentally take an excessive dose.   I'll go ahead and echo the advice that you should not drink alcohol while taking it nor should you take it more than recommended by your doctor (amount or frequency)."

Drugs,3e0i7g,TheRealVictorWard,2,Tue Jul 21 04:15:15 2015 UTC,"I have a couple of questions for you, good sir.   2c-b mimics the effect of serotonin while MDMA makes your brain release it.   Is this why a large populous of people become depressed, sad or feel a bit down after they try MDMA?  There is not enough serotonin in the brain, and so the brain has to produce more?

Drugs,3e0i7g,Sathanel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:55:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is most certainly healthier to mimic the effects of serotonin release than to actually release them as harshly as MDMA does.  While not much information on 2C-B is known because it's a relatively new drug and there hasn't been a lot of prolonged use/abuse of it, based on the way it works, it's a relatively safe drug that can probably be used fairly frequently without any noticeable harm. With that said, nobody knows for certain.  I went through a period of doing 2C-B once a week and I didn't notice any issues as a result of doing so."

Then what about LSD; does it mimic the effects of serotonin or make the brain release it?   Classical psychedelics are serotonin agonists, meaning they bind to serotonin receptor sites, i.e. mimicking it.   It is healthier to mimic the effects of serotonin, right?   Giving a straight yes answer to this question feels weird, but psychedelics don't have the hangover effect that MDMA does and can generally be used more frequently without causing physical damage to the brain."

Drugs,3e0lvd,shikuto,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:21:20 2015 UTC,How does that work though? I'm not saying you're wrong I just want to update my own information. Wouldn't the drug always have some sort of influence on serotonin no matter the person?
Drugs,3e0lvd,Xero32,0,Tue Jul 21 04:22:53 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. I don't really have an answer for how it works. Mostly because science still doesn't have an answer as to why hallucinogens actually cause their effects. We know that LSD, for example, acts on our dopamine and serotonin levels, but we don't know why that makes LSD makes us trip balls.   I'd liken it to any pharmaceutical, though. Just as ""Lyrica may not work for everybody,"" psychedelics are much the same. They just happen to have a much higher success rate than a lot of pharmas."
Drugs,3e0lvd,shikuto,0,Tue Jul 21 04:33:17 2015 UTC,acts on our dopamine and serotonin levels   Not true. It doesn't release dopamine or serotonin. LSD is a bit more complex as it also binds to other receptors but most psychedelics mimic serotonin and work on your 5-HT 2A receptor.
Drugs,3e0lvd,Xero32,0,Tue Jul 21 10:53:20 2015 UTC,"I never said it released a damn thing, don't put words in my mouth. If something binds to the 5-HT 2A/B receptors, that will affect the overall levels of serotonin."
Drugs,3e0lvd,shikuto,0,Tue Jul 21 12:16:27 2015 UTC,"That's not how psychedelics work as I said, doesn't have to do with serotonin levels."
Drugs,3e0lvd,Xero32,0,Tue Jul 21 12:25:00 2015 UTC,"Psilocin has been shown to cause an increased level of serotonin.   LSD has also been shown to increase serotonin levels, albeit only slightly.   Now, if you go back to my original comment, I mentioned that we don't know why these drugs cause psychedelic effects. I never claimed that the increased levels of neurotransmitters caused the effects, and refuted that I have any knowledge of the mechanism. Y'know, because there's no evidence showing why we trip while using psychedelics.   Nothing either of us has posited is false, except that you claim the drugs don't affect serotonin levels. Now, can we stop arguing about this?"
Drugs,3e0lvd,shikuto,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:17:57 2015 UTC,"Nothing either of us has posited is false, except that you claim the drugs don't affect serotonin levels.   Lol what ? Read your post man:   acts on our dopamine and serotonin levels, but we don't know why that makes us trip balls.   You said that they work on our serotonin and dopamine levels and said that is the reason they make us trip, which is false.    never claimed that the increased levels of neurotransmitters caused the effects   Yes you did. Read your post.  I was wrong about them not increasing the levels, that's right.  I admit that. And you should just admit that you were wrong about the reason psychedelics make us trip, instead you try to make it look like I read your post wrong.

Take a magnesium supplement to ease the muscular tension you will feel with the comedown, also make sure to eat and stay well hydrated, this is key. Drinks such as Pedialyte or Gatorade will replenish electrolytes that Adderall depletes, but water itself is just as critical.  If you have access, a 5-HTP and L-tyrosine supplement will help to replenish neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine which will subsequently improve your mood and overall feeling.  Also, if available, benzodiazapines or a small (5-10mg) dose of hydrocodone will aid you well for the 24-48 hours after your ""binge."""

Drugs,3duz1p,SmellsLikeWeedSpirit,118,Sun Jul 19 19:15:45 2015 UTC,"YOU CAN GET OUT OF THIS. I know through the depths I dove into alcoholism that recovery is VERY daunting, but it can be done, and it should be your number one priority, above seeing your kids at this point. You didn't state much about the details of your use, but a taper facilitated by a medical facility is VERY common, even with people who are deep in the benzo hole. That's where you need to be.  But until then, dude, you can fucking do this shit. I'll PM you my fucking phone number if you want to talk. I know that may seem weird and overly forward, but the gravity of your situation warrants it. I know how alone you probably feel, and I've been there, and I know that talking to people can help immensely in calming you down. Being inside our own heads while in withdraw is one of the scariest, hopeless things you can deal with. Get out of you head, if even for a conversation for a few days. I'm no doctor or anything, but I will happily talk to you if you think it will help. Any time, any day.   Let me reiterate though: YOU CAN CONQUER THESE DEMONS. Many have. I'm four years sober from alcohol and have tested the waters with benzos and somewhat understand the destruction they can cause. I've caught a glimpse into it, it's scary, and in the beginning there may seem to be NO light at the end of the tunnel, but dig a little deeper for your own sake, and for that of your children. If you've ruled out suicide hotlines, rest assured that  I'm PMing you my cell. You can text me or call or whatever you're comfortable with. I'm no physician, but I've been to those dark places and I'm still here today and I am VERY thankful for that. You can be too."

Drugs,3duz1p,iamalsojoesphlabre,3,Mon Jul 20 10:39:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah man. I was just listening to a podcast about how people with darkness in them, or who've at least seen that darkness, can always see it in others, and are generally attracted to them as a friend.   My last horray consisted of pouring the ass end (I never left much, wasn't much of a waster) of every bottle I had into one small cup and sipping at it 'til it was gone. Those following days (months in total, went through the cycle enough times) spent in my room(s), cold with twinges of pain and things darting in the corners of my eyes. The cup of water that I couldn't, while very dexterous in my daily sober life, get to my mouth because of the shaking. The strange auditory hallucinations that seemed to repeat over and over and over again... a weird, indiscernible old-timey radio conversation that I eventually began to believe was mocking me, along with my roommates muffled conversation that may or may not have even been happening, which I was also convinced was about me. The St. John's bridge was maybe a 15 minute walk and while I didn't ever let myself get too far down that line of thought, it was there taunting me along with the rest of my mind.   The worst part about withdrawing from things is how you CANNOT seem to see the light at the end of the tunnel, even though sometimes it's just a few days away. That return to normalcy seems fucking impossibly far away. But god damn, if crawling through that river of shit and coming out clean on the other side (to quote good ol' Shawshank) isn't one of the absolute best feelings on the face of the planet, I don't know what is. It makes a little buzz seem like a joke of an experience.   I don't know man. Life is hard sometimes. I don't regret those years because it taught me how weak I could be, as well as how strong I could be. I'm not a brick wall or anything now, but I definitely feel like I am able to handle rough situations with a lot more grace. And lest we not forget how easy it becomes to let the petty bullshit roll off your back. Learning to cut the bullshit out of your life is one of the many lessons conquering demons will hand you. There are so many people in this world that I'd love to meet, like you, and talk to, and when I begin to notice a pattern of ambivalence about the important shit in life in a ""friend's"" personality, I will turn respectfully and walk right the fuck away in hopes of running into folks like you, who actually have something to say.   Thanks for responding to my post. OP didn't write me, but I'm not assuming the worst by any means. I know the rollercoaster of emotions that comes with being where he's at, and I'm hoping he is maintaining, just maybe a little scared to look at this thread, as I would've been."

US strangers are reading your story but it isn't too late for you to change for the ones who matter most. Drugs don't own you. They don't take you. You take them. So take them away.

Drugs,3duz1p,borisvanshliten,5,Mon Jul 20 00:04:59 2015 UTC,"Right now it sounds like you're in a very painful and heartbreaking position. As I'm sure you unfortunately know very well by now, opiates take away everything positive and beautiful in your life, stripping you of your money, family, hobbies, self-respect, etc. It sounds like you would greatly benefit from doing an inpatient rehabilitation program. If you have attended one in the past, go again, and ask yourself what you could do differently in an attempt to maintain sobriety this time around. A standard 28 day program may not be enough; tbh I would try to do a 60 or 90 day program...and even that may not be enough. It is important to take time to heal yourself and start to discover inner peace and resuscitate your self-esteem. It's crucial to be ""selfish"" when you first start getting clean: you need to put yourself and your recovery before everything else in your life.   Your children need you in their life and despite any ways you may have wronged them in the past, they're going to want their father to be around them to see them grow up. They want you rooting for them in the stands at their baseball games, to see you in the crowd at their ballet recitals, to have dinner with you every night after you get home from a long day of work, not a long day of hustling for dope.    While it is important to get clean for your family, getting clean must ultimately be done for you. When the counselor your children saw remarked that they would be better off without you, he couldn't be any further from the truth (and I'm guessing that the counselor actually said they would be better off without you if you're using).   Getting and staying clean is not easy; you will have to put up a fight if you want your life to change. Measures that you may feel to be drastic, such as attending a long-term treatment program, going to Narcotics Anonymous meetings every night, accepting that you are powerless over these drugs, will most likely have to be taken. If you end up going to rehab, try to get the most out of it possible. Recovery is done in baby steps and the best way to start making positive changes in your life is by starting to make small adjustments in rehab. If you don't make changes in rehab, you're most likely not going to start making them once you're back in the real world. Use that time to strap on the training wheels and start making minor adjustments in rehab while you have tools and resources constantly at your disposal.   In your post you said that nobody cares about you. While I'm sure it feels like nobody gives a damn about you, like the world has turned its back on you, there are loads of people that care about you. Your wife and kids do, your fiends and family does, the thousands of counsellors that are available for you to speak to care, even the individuals of r/opiates care about your wellbeing! You have a tremendous amount of worth and you can accomplish anything you want in this life. The ball is in your court, however, and your success will be measured by how badly you want to succeed and overdone this horrible disease.   Doing things like going to court messed up on Xanax are only going to set you back. I understand the need to mask your feelings, to temporarily hide behind a wall of bliss inducing chemicals swirling around in your bloodstream. I know what it's like to feel like you and everyone around you would be better off if you ended your life. Please get your firearms out of your house and into the hands of a trusted friend or family member. As I'm sure you've heard before, suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. As a heroin addict myself, I've been there too and I know how strong those feelings grow to be. But there is always hope, friend. There are people out there that love and care about you and you are just as worthy of that love and the right to live a happy, wholesome life.   My condolences in reference to your friend that passed away. It's never easy to lose a friend, especially to a drug overdose. If you don't pursue some help, you too may meet this same terrible fate...this is the road that opiates lead us down. And sadly, there's a good chance that your daughters could find you overdosed again, but you may not be so lucky to make it through again. Finding you dead would be something they would never get over. There is a reason you have survived thus far. You have a purpose on this earth, a purpose that includes being a positive role model to your children and a loving husband to your wife.   You can do this. Check with your insurance company as to where you can attend an inpatient program. Don't waste your time with outpatient until you've successfully completed an inpatient program. There are free rehabs that you can go to. Get involved with NA or AA. Some people hate on these groups a lot but to be honest I don't think there's any legitimate reasons to (to each their own) because they are wildly helpful and will allow you to see you're not alone in this fight. NA and AA absolutely do work if you work the programs. Don't be scared off at first! It's not a cult and you'll meet a lot of awesome people, from homeless crackheads without a pot to piss in to doctors and lawyers that are complete dope fiends. But everyone is there for the same reason: they're all addicts and that bond is exceptionally strong.    Utilize these organizations to foster a positive support system for yourself. Recovery takes time: it took you years to get into the hole you're in now, and it's going to  take years to dig yourself back out.  I apologize for the wall of text but I really wanted to let you know that there is a light at the end of this soul-crushing, murky tunnel or addiction. Believe in yourself! There's a ton of resources available these days for addicts. Start by getting yourself into detox and heading right into a rehab program. Do it for your kids, do it for your wife, but most importantly, do it for you! You are in charge of your life - while you don't have control over opiates, you do have the power to change. Obviously I don't know you but I know you can get things together. Any addict can. Good luck!! PM me if there's anything I can ever help you with."

It sounds bad and horrible because it is. Whether it's your heart giving out because of the pills or the bullet to the brain, death is a very real path you're life could take very soon. But there's good news! There are other paths that your life could also take! Better paths! The fact that you're here seeking help is even more evident of that in my opinion. You have options no matter how deep in the hole you think you are. There is always another option. Always. People may disagree, you may disagree, and that's fine. I want you to know that it doesn't have to end how it appears it's going to end. You really have to open your mind and try to find sense in this spiral into darkness. Getting to a better place may mean leaving everything behind. If you truly are to help yourself, then perhaps you can find it within you to change it all out of sheer will power. Or perhaps you may have to buy a one way ticket to Peru or Canada or Mongolia and just get away from this dark place. Get away from the drugs. Some call it reinventing yourself. I call it letting the mind roam free. People may disagree and say that my advice is shitty but what I want you to really think about this hard. What do you want and how far will you go to get it? Whether what you want in the end is a bullet to head or to one day walk hand in hand with your children through disneyland, these both are very real paths. The have equal potential to occur.

Opiates all trigger the same receptors, induce the same general effects and can certainly cause dependency. Wd's do tend to be dose dependent but that will increase over time with tolerance. Also, people generally don't start out banging 3 bags of heroin a day, weaker opiates at the very least can raise tolerance to the point where stronger drugs are needed...Bottom line; this forum is safety and harm reduction forum not a dick measuring contest."

Maybe the pills made em feel better but no one liked being around them when they were f***ed up.  It seemed like the longer they were hooked on pills that more and more friends faded  away.   I can only speak for myself but even i reached a point where i couldn't afford to care anymore.  I would reach out repeatedly and i was lied to, taken advantage of and stolen from.  Eventually one of these people i use to be close with died.  I'm not sure if they got too bold or intentionally overdosed but it hit me very hard. It's not that i don't care, i cared deeply in fact, it's that i couldn't afford to care.   I can only care so much and it's  wasted on people that use it for selfish gains(i.e. to escape reality and be numb to the world).  Fortunately i also have friends that have pulled out of it and every single person stood up for themself and asked for help.   Nothing anyone else did for them was permanent until they took it upon themselves to be their own savior.  I assume that applies to you too.  Don't be afraid or ashamed to ask for help.  These drugs are not you,  they are not who you are.  You obviously love your kids and you need to stand up for yourself and escape the hold  these pills have on you.  You're  still in there and you're  stronger than them.  Prove it to yourself."

He's a Master Sergeant now with a career worthy of a man's respect.  Drugs are a distant memory and he defined himself.

Drugs,3e0d4u,bebe202,7,Mon Jul 20 23:59:39 2015 UTC,"The way the brain works is there is a balance of exciting and inhibiting forces. When the exciting forces get out of control,  or the inhibiting forces are reduced, you have a seizure. Lots of things amp up the exciting forces, or dampen inhibitors, including all kinds of drugs, flashing lights, sleep deprivation, etc. etc.    People have different brains. Some people have seizures extremely easily, they have them just doing day-to-day things. Some people are really not seizure prone and it would take 3g of tramadol to get them seizing. You just happen to have a brain where some combination of MDMA and conditions is enough to kick it over the edge.    I would seriously advise you to stop doing MDMA. You have a pretty ironclad connection between it and your seizures. Not only can seizures in themselves be bad for your brain, but its really dangerous because you can really easily lose consciousness and severely injure yourself falling to the ground like a sack of potatos. People die. Its also really really traumatic for everyone trying to have fun at a show or festival to see you collapse and bleed out on the floor and be taken away by paramedics, its a night ruiner for sure.    Try some other drugs. MDMA ain't for you."
Drugs,3e0d4u,951,-4,Tue Jul 21 00:18:41 2015 UTC,I agree 100%  I've seen tons of people collapse and seize at concerts or festivals. It has left a huge imprint on myself and I will never try MDMA because of all the health risks. I was at a concert one time and watched someone rolling pass out on the ground seizing. He had so much sweat rolling off this body it looked like he jumped in a pool. I watched him be wheel chaired off out of the event. This ruined my high and made the vibe of the concert a lot darker. Later I found out that he was a 14 year old kid who ended up not making it. MDMA is dangerous for most people. I don't recommend this drug to friends because of how dangerous it can be.
Drugs,3e0d4u,TrippyHipT,-1,Tue Jul 21 00:37:52 2015 UTC,Well the kid was 14 so that most likely had something to do with it. MDMA is fine just try it in a safe setting your first time.
Drugs,3e0d4u,tripple-glaze,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:29:28 2015 UTC,"IMO, this can happen without any warning. I'd used MDMA for 8 years with no problems. One night, I took a normal dose from a batch I'd been chipping away at for nearly a year. The purity was quantitatively known to me. Out of the blue I had a seizure and developed a 105 C temperature. Just like you, I had an abnormal EKG.   That's just the nature of MDMA. Is it safe? Yes for the most part, but relative to other drugs it's acute toxicity is fairly high. Every time you take it, even at a moderate dose, you are assuming some risk. I am convinced MDMA is not a drug you can chronically without eventually having some issue like this."

This is so you are fully hydrated so you don't end up having a bad stomach and it will also filter out the toxins of your body or anything you don't need from nutmeg. Drinking a gallon of water a day is also very good for your health. Eat some good food nothing too sugary or too salty and don't try to fill yourself up. Smoke some weed on the come up it will get a rid of the nausea and makes the trip better the colours gets a lot brighter and stronger. I would take 25g if I were you I know it's a high dose but a lot of people did 25g their first time on nutmeg including me it's the ceiling dose so you won't get any higher if you take more than 25g you'll just end up making the side effects worst. If you do what I say you'll be fine just stay hydrated and you will have a good time. Do a trip report if your going to do it

Molly Measure uses a weight dependence which leads to sensible doses for light people, but for heavy people the doses become very high as it doesn't account for the nonlinear weight response that MDMA actually has.

Drugs,3dzgdr,Cornkrise,3,Mon Jul 20 19:57:35 2015 UTC,If you have no experience with Xanax then you don't know how it will affect you. You might just get sleepy and disoriented and it will make the experience not fun at all.   When the Xanax wears off there is generally a rebound effect for me where I feel more anxious.   Personally what I recommend is taking 0.25 at the start. If you're still very anxious then take another 0.25. Xanax only lasts 5 or 5 hours so try to spread out your doses.

Drugs,3dzgdr,Undercorpse,2,Mon Jul 20 20:23:17 2015 UTC,"Xanax before events usually makes me pretty tired. I would recommend not taking it before, but have some on hand (maybe even up to 2mg) and use it as needed. If you end up not needing it, you'll save yourself from losing your energy, since it is a 12 hour festival.   A lot of times, just knowing that I have some on me prevents my anxiety or panic attacks from coming on and I end up not even using it. It's just the peace of mind knowing that if something does happen, I'm ready"
Drugs,3dzgdr,Undercorpse,3,Mon Jul 20 20:13:54 2015 UTC,"Yes. I've actually carried it around with me in case of emergency, and it does help put my mind at ease, that if I were to need it, its right in my pocket. Thanks, I might just do this instead."

Drugs,3dzgdr,thunderbi112,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:21:24 2015 UTC,"Yes. Its most of the anxiety comes from before getting there. So I was thinking maybe I take it before to get me there, because usually when i'm there already i'm fine, because the adrenaline and excitement comes in. So hopefully it wears off while im there, and i experience no negative effects."
Drugs,3dzgdr,hellayaked,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:45:16 2015 UTC,Take .5 mg or less before you go and save the rest in case you need it later. Without a significant tolerance you should still feel noticeably more relaxed and taking the whole thing will likely have a negative effect on your driving.  You shouldn't get any rebound anxiety unless you take it several days in a row.

That being said, if you feel like you will be able to control your use and not use it super often (3 months between rolls is generally what's recomended), then I wouldn't think it would cause that much damage. Also, since you'd be doing it two days in a row, be prepared for a hangover that will probably be pretty bad."

Drugs,3dv6a4,speeddealer420,3,Mon Jul 20 09:02:43 2015 UTC,"Drugs can affect those things, but plenty of other things can do that too. It's more about overindulgence than it is about the specific object of desire. Some people hurt their loved ones, compromise their jobs, and tax public health resources with excessive drug use. Other people do some/all of those things by gambling too much, eating too much, playing videogames too much, having sex too much, watching porn too much, or working too much. Anything that's pleasurable can lead to behavior that's harmful to others if the person enjoying those pleasures starts pursuing them over everything else.  Drugs may have more of an effect in certain areas (e.g car crashes) but I think it's important to note that a lot of the issues caused by drug abuse are not unique to drugs but instead a general symptom of the abandonment of a person's former priorities in favor of pleasure/thrill-seeking."

Drugs,3dwe0d,finallychill,2,Tue Jul 21 01:17:25 2015 UTC,The act of smoking weed chills me out more than the high. Also without a high tolerance my weed highs are paranoid and bad every time. I like drinking alcohol and it's more fun for me to play drinking games and stuff when I know I'm not going to trashed because I'm such a lightweight. Like I said I enjoy the act of taking the drugs almost more than the high's themselves.

Drugs,3dwe0d,ShawneeAlice,2,Mon Jul 20 15:02:12 2015 UTC,"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19514967   Didn't read this one, but it looks like it gives a pretty good overview. The wikipedia article about the P450 system is good too. Basically we have a huge array of liver enzymes that break certain bonds in molecules to generally make them less toxic to us. For example you could eat a handful of pure serotonin and your liver would destroy all of it, same goes for phenylethylamine (which is apparently a decent stimulant if you get it directly into your brain) so you don't feel any effect.   Some drugs such benzos, anti-seizure medications and anti-depressants are either deactivated over time by these enzymes or alternatively some are metabolized into a more active form. Some drugs cause inhibition by binding up the enzyme more permanently or down regulating gene expression. Prozac and Paxil, once though to be pretty safe to use in anyone can absolutely wreak havoc if you lack the enzyme to efficiently eliminate them.   This P450 system also exists in your brain, though the ways these enzymes interact with medications are not well understood. It's thought that Wellbutrin, and some of the SSRIs partially work because they alter metabolism of neurotransmitters by increasing/decreasing the activity of these enzymes though this is mostly speculation and only backed up by some small in vitro studies as far as I know.   Almost all people have some variation in this system which is why different tolerances exist. Some people completely lack a certain enzyme and can have strange side effects from psychotropics especially since they effect our experience of the world. In the general population though, simply trying a few medications until one works is the best way to go. But for people with complex mental health issues, it's worth looking at which drugs they have reacted badly to.   There's a company, who I used to think was just scamming people, that will sequence your P450 genes and give you a list of which subtypes you have and how certain medications will effect you. It turns out to be pretty useful if people can't tolerate psychiatric medications despite trying several. In my experience their panel lines up VERY well with which drugs they have failed."

I can't get a decent effect from benzos without probably increasing my tolerance even more. As for the local anaesthetics, I had to have some recently during a very painful procedure. I got three shots for it instead of one. Between some of the shots I tried to ride the pain but it was too much so I had to ask for more.   Luckily I think my alcohol tolerance is pretty low."
Drugs,3dwe0d,SgtFaecesProcessor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:34:32 2015 UTC,Do you have to tell the doctors etc that you have a tolerance for anaesthetics & the reason why?  Does this cross over to the general anaesthetics as well? Would you be more likely to wake up during an operation & because of tolerance are you more at risk of death during general?  Does it also mean if you are trying to beat an addiction to them that normal sensations are translated into pain?  I would never get addicted to these things or try them out as I am a naturally lazy person & the effects seem to mimic my default demeanour.

So I have a range of ways I can behave & if I wanted I could probably keep up with other guys who think they can out do me. My way of thinking, I see no reason to spoil their illusion, it makes them feel good to take an abstract thing like needing more of something than the next guy to feel more like a man then I think, who am I to deny them of that."

Drugs,3dy1iw,Crawling_To_My_Goals,2,Mon Jul 20 14:05:10 2015 UTC,"Good question. I haven't read many studies, just talking from my experience and the experience of others, but I think it depends on the person and the amount that you smoked and drank. A few beers made me an asshole for days, 1 joint made me slow for a few days. Some weed strains don't have that effect on me. Some people can become slow and weird from an occasional joint, some can smoke daily and be ok. Same with alcohol.   Ask the people around you if they are noticing changes and keep logs on your mood to see if weed has an effect on you. Smoking weed makes me a nice person, but it also makes me feel like I am not moving towards the person that I would like to be. Smoke, keep a log and see if you notice or like the changes."
Drugs,3dy1iw,HalfPastTuna,2,Mon Jul 20 14:16:37 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, I can smoke loads and then be fine the next day and then some days I can have one joint and for the next few days I will feel like a fucking potato.

The important thing (with any drug) is to note if you feel side effects that are lasting for more than a day or two. If that happens you need to stop for awhile.  Also, try to keep your brain and body engaged and active in every day life. The more active your brain is, the less you're going to see the negative cognitive side effects from drug use (in general)."
Drugs,3dy1iw,tripbin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:29:18 2015 UTC,"I think regular and long term are separate quantifiers. You can be a short term regular user or a long time but occasional user.  Regular is a subjective and vague definition. I would consider something like mdma once every two/three months or cocaine/weed every week/two weeks regular.   Long or short term would be defined by how long you've used or plan to use.   I would consider you a short term regular, but not daily, smoker. I wouldn't consider use long term until used at least a better part of a year."

I had one summer where I discovered hash oil and was pretty much baked as a cake for 6 months. During that time, I lost all ambition to be the outgoing alpha-male type in preference for relaxing and learning something new, hiking or longboarding, not unhealthy things, but not socially stimulating things. Toward the end of that period, I started to get depressed  when I got back to college as I hadn't been social with new people in so long and was essentially kinda just feeling the fogginess and knew that it was just killing my abilities to socialize when I was usually super friendly and outgoing and it really put me down in the dumps for a while until I quit and regained all my confidence and did some serious thinking about my life. I'm all good now, but but I'm trying to tell you not to accept that fogginess overtaking your life for extended periods of time. You will eventually ""forget"" how to be the sharp minded person you normally are. Where ""faking it till you make it"" is a good way to get yourself used to being an ""alpha-male"" until you no longer remember how not to be, this was the exact opposite.  Then again everyone is different and I have friends who smoke like that all the time and have no problems at all. Its all about you and how pot affects you."

Drugs,3dz2fr,Jebediah19,2,Mon Jul 20 18:17:53 2015 UTC,"Notes: This is the simplest procedure I have come up with to obtain essentially pure amphetamine sulfate, but I've had mixed results.  First, you're dealing with some pretty small volumes here, which means no margin for error, or you'll need expensive microscale glassware.  Second, DCM and ether are hard to find (controlled substances), and xylene just doesn't dissolve the free-base very well, so yields are low.  Overall, I've found it's more trouble than it's worth, so I frequently just do the first 3 steps to reduce the volume of solid and preserve my nasal cavity.  Advice:   Use smallest volume of liquid necessary to dissolve the amphetamines. 10 mL doesn't seem like much, but if you try to do the A/B extraction with 100 mg of Amp in 250 mL of water, you won't get anything. Be patient, especially with the A/B extractions. Getting as much product as possible into the proper phase can take time, so be patient and keep gently mixing. Every time I rush a procedure, I either spend more time fixing the problems I created, or throwing out the whole mess. Get a chemistry lab textbook to help you stay safe and efficient. Leaning how to do an extraction from an Organic lab book will help you avoid a lot of common problems. Don't substitute hydrochloric acid for sulfuric acid. Amphetamine chloride is unstable as a solid and will not last long."

Drugs,3dyn91,Colin_Baunach_,3,Mon Jul 20 16:32:27 2015 UTC,"The DMT Nexus Forum has the information you're looking for and so much more. That being said, the Glass Vapor Genie and the Machine are the two most widely recommended. Both work by melting the DMT into a copper mesh and then using a torch lighter to vaporize it quickly and efficiently. I don't recommend a normal Vapor Genie for this though or any other typical vaporizer, it will smell bad and can be hard to clean.  If you prefer to use an eCig, apparently it works very well if done right. Here's a great post by u/uncooluserid on r/DMT on how he accomplishes this: ""This method ABSOLUTELY works. I have been smoking DMT consistently since the end of 2008, I have tried numerous methods including: Bubble/pookie (it's a meth pipe) stem pipe the machine Glass vapor Genie Weed pipe Bong Volcano Laced joint Hash oil vape pen and of all the ways I have found to do it, over the last 6 years now, has been an e-cig using a Nautilus Mini. It is absolutely effective, and absolutely allows for breakthroughs WITHOUT the need of a lighter, complicated intake system, or wall outlet. I have shared this with a large number of people, many of them having issues in the past with taste or difficulty smoking. This method makes it 100% easy. No learning curve, no harsh taste, no worry of not getting enough fast enough, no reloading or not being able to blast off with others. I currently use a regular Kanger tech battery attached to a plain old Nautilus mini. The gravity fed nautilus tank is IDEAL. This is my preferred space shuttle and I absolutely see no reason to use anything else (personally).  DMT saturates into Propelyne glycol, meaning that it will dissolve from it's crystalline state into a liquid form if added to a 100% PG solution. This is an option, but putting it into a 100% PG solution doesn't allow the molecule to recrystallize, and after 6 months may be a little weaker than when you first made it. The answer is to use a mixture around 90/10 or 80/20 Propelyne Glycol to Vegetable Glycerin. Using a mixture with even a small amount of VG in it seems to allow your spice to reform a matrix and, because it's still safely stored in the tank, it doesn't oxidize, lasting  much longer. The only catch is closing the airflow to your nautilus tank, filling a cup with hot water, and dipping your tank into the water until your spice has remelted into the solution.  Additionally, UNLIKE WHAT A POSTER BELOW WROTE, mixing DMT into a e-cig juice is a extremely pleasant smoke. The multiple options of e-cig fluid flavors allow you to compliment the DMT smoke however you want, and the low heat from the battery doesn't burn the DMT, allowing it to vape at a low temp and not be harsh. IT TASTES LIKE ANGEL KISSES ON YOUR EYELIDS BROTHER! Here is another MAJOR benefit to the E-pen method: You are NO LONGER restricted to only 3 hits. ""You only get 3 hits"" is a myth, and only applicable due to certain intake methods. If you make your intake method as simple as possible (for example, hold it up to your face and just keep breathing) you can feasibly take as many hits as possible within 45-60 seconds before the DMT starts being fully consumed by your body. That's right, it's not a 3 hit rule, its a 45-60 second rule, and even that isn't always applicable. Do you know how many times you can hit an e-cig in 45 seconds? A lot. I usually only manage to take 4-5 really big hits, where I am completely filling my lungs, before I forget I am even holding a pen. The correct solution ratio is NOT a microdose, but the correct ratio IS the most important part of this method. So, the ratio myself and many friends have found to work best is 1 gram of DMT to 1 Ml of e-cig fluid. You can even push it and go up to 1.2-1.3 ml, but much more and you'll start to notice that it will take a couple more hits to achieve complete breakthrough. I do sometimes like to mix a solution with more fluid than DMT to smoke at festivals for a slower and more controllable onset. If you want to make some hyper space juice though, go 1 gram to one milliliter. Here is how you mix the solution: Crush up your molecule into a fine powder (if it is freebase crystal) so that it melts more readily under heat. Larger chunks of crystal take longer to dissolve. You will need to place your spice into a small glass vial or jar (I use a 2 ounce glass vial from the health food store), then take your Ml of fluid and pour it into the vial with your spice. this will seem like a really small amount of fluid compared to a pile of powdered material, and it may not mix right away, but don't panic! Once we are finished it's going to look like like any unassuming e-liquid. After mixing the two together, boil some water in a kettle. Fill two cups with hot water. With the first cup, make some tea. It will be quite lovely and relaxing. With the second cup of hot water, dip your sealed glass vial into the water, being careful to not completely submerge it. The vial will essentially double boil the DMT/e-liquid, applying low enough heat to melt the molecule and mix it with the base fluid.  The spice will have melted within less than 5 minutes, it's really fast, and when it's done it will look like e-fluid with oily rainbow swirls running through it. This is your finished solution. A 1:1 ratio will make roughly 2 Ml of finished, ready, Hyperspace juice. Once you've got this, simply pour it into your nautilus mini, prime it up like you would any other tank, turn on the battery, and puff until you cant remember how. Once the solution is mixed, you can take it ANYWHERE and it looks completely inconspicuous, even more inconspicuous than a joint or hash pen. You can smoke it in bed, on a windy mountain, or even in public at an event if you'd like. No learning curve either, just hold it to your face, and fill your lungs each time (I usually double press the button on the battery to avoid the automatic shut off time). With this ratio using a full gram I typically get 10-15 full trips w/ breakthrough per milliliter, so if you have 2 Ml of solution, that's roughly 20-30 full trips from 1 gram, which is actually really really good bang for amount of spice used. Basically a 50mg blast off each time rest assured, and none of your smoke is lost/wasted/burned."" I hope he's ok with me pasting his old post cause this is the second time this morning I've pasted it haha Best of luck to you!"

Drugs,3dyn91,tsunautic,3,Mon Jul 20 20:13:15 2015 UTC,"Sorry about that... Still haven't figured out formatting on mobile yet.  Your best bet is to buy a Glass Vapor Genie, a torch lighter, and a Chore-Boy Copper Scrubber.    Tear off an eyeball-sized section of the copper scrubber and torch it to burn off any residues.  Heat the copper with the torch and then drop the DMT on to it to melt into it. Put the copper inside the Glass Vapor Genie and then while holding the torch above the top, aim into the bowl and start inhaling, it should vaporize the DMT.   If cost is a problem, your best bet would be a meth pipe. DMT is a tricky substance, if you want more in depth tutorials, go to the DMT Nexus Forums, all the information you could ever want is there. Hope this helped a little better."

Theres a difference between drug USE and drug ABUSE. You could use cocain every weekend/every fortnight and not be addicted (addiction actually takes work you know. regularly using over a period of time).  Are there dangers? Of course. Are drugs largely harmless? No."

Start doing that shit on Monday morning because you're too tired, then you have a problem. At college I ended up smoking skunk and drinking daily, and that was probably a low point for me. Nowadays I've done a lot of 'harder' drugs and haven't developed an addiction to any of them because I treat them with more respect... and yet I am fucked if I can completely quit drinking, cut it down yes, cut it out hell no."
Drugs,3dw373,mollaigh,46,Mon Jul 20 00:41:35 2015 UTC,"Not everyone has the same brain as you. Some people get zero response from SSRIs and don't get comedowns unless they heavily abuse MDMA. I wouldn't recommend taking MDMA while you are depressed as there is a chance that the comedown will make things worse. However for some people taking MDMA will show them ""what its like to be happy"" lifting the depression enough for them to talk to someone about it, make positive changes in their life or other depression alleviating actions. If they get a 1-2 week afterglow rather than a comedown (pretty common for first time users) they might be able to push themselves out of depression."

SSRI's affect your serotonin almost immediately after starting them. However the possible positive effects take 2-3 weeks to come in to full effect.
Drugs,3dw373,DeltaGunner,2,Mon Jul 20 12:29:02 2015 UTC,"SSRIs definitely are effective from the outset. Unfortunately after a while your brain just gets used to the raised serotonin levels and you get trapped in a spiral of increasing doses and the addiction is no joke - withdrawal effects are horrendous. Great for a few months if you find yourself in a terrible place but as a long term treatment they don't seem much cop. Nowadays  I take St Johns Wort three weeks on one week off just to give a little lift, but really most of it is therapy, exercise, meditation, diet, sleep and of course trying to reign in the 2 day long drug binges."
Drugs,3dw373,bj_dnm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:52:37 2015 UTC,"While SSRI's do start working on receptors immediately after starting them, the 2-3 weeks for noticing the effects comes from the pharmacodynamic profile. Basically you want to reach a steady state concentration of SSRI in your blood, and the amount of time it takes to reach this steady state depends on the half-life of the drug. SSRIs have a long half life, and hence a long time is required to reach steady state concentrations."

This year, for my birthday, I took MDMA for the first time (accidentally did twice as much as I should have, but that's a tale for Erowid) and it kicked my year off RIGHT!

Drugs,3dw373,2sang,11,Mon Jul 20 01:02:59 2015 UTC,"It has helped me by providing a new perspective on my life. That ""happiness"" from MDMA allowed me to see that my state of depression wasn't a normal state to be in but I had slowly gotten used to.  It doesn't ""cure"" depression, but it can help by showing people the door for the way out. Sometimes people who are depressed are trapped in a spiral and forgot what it's like to be on the outside.  Sometimes MDMA also helps people confront and overcome their anxieties. There are lot of people that have memories or concepts that give them anxiety and stress them out, so they don't even want to deal with them. This trauma is coped with through repression or escapism, but on the MDMA high one can comfortably address the skeletons in their closet and figure out how to deal with them. This may be why MDMA is beginning to be used to treat PTSD.  MDMA doesn't magically cure depression but it can be a helpful tool for addressing it. Using it to escape from depression is definitely not helpful."

If you think about these things while on MDMA they probably won't be painful at all.  That lets you get a little perspective and realize that you don't have to have so much pain associate with those thoughts.  That's basically how MDMA PTSD therapy works.  It teaches you that you can have the thoughts without the pain."

Drugs,3dw373,bluebluebluered,3,Mon Jul 20 04:47:53 2015 UTC,Dude this is with therapy. And in small controlled doses. 100mg with no tolerance or less is not going to give you a horrible comedown if you've never taken MDMA before. Especially if you've been going through therapy to help deal with some of the causes of your depression. As u/Timberwolf_88 said the chemicals your brain releases allow for a more 'easy access' therapy session. This is also why it's useful for PTSD and another such things. Don't just go getting fucked up on a half gram and hoping that will help with any mental illnesses.
Drugs,3dw373,rberg89,2,Mon Jul 20 10:46:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's how it works at all.  I extremely limit my MDMA consumption because otherwise I get insanely depressed. Like, crying-every-day depressed. Yeah, there's other shit going on in my life, but try to run to happy-place-ville on MDMA and come back the next day and you're like, everything fucking blows and I hate myself.  Yeah, MDMA is depression-inducing if anything."
Drugs,3dw373,Timberwolf_88,3,Mon Jul 20 04:44:26 2015 UTC,"People with lower levels of serotonin will get heavier comedowns, that's because you use more serotonin (MDMA lets your brain use more of your serotonin reserve than usual, that's why you get the euphoria).  If you get a heavy comedown then MDMA prob. isn't the drug for you. But most people don't get this unless they use very large amounts of MDMA while using.  I have seen and experienced both sides of the coin, I've done MDMA in small, medium and large (extended) doses. First few times I did just a bit along with weed and that went just fine, I experienced barely any comedown at all.  Then I had an extreme week of MDMA/Alcohol/Weed-partying with a friend, we slept maybe 1-2 hours every 24 hours and were constantly refilling with more weed, more booze and more MDMA. We had a blast but the comedown lasted for about 2 weeks. I have a high level of serotonin in my body to begin with so ""all"" I was experiencing on my comedown was just very indifferent, something felt off and I know I wasn't sad or depressed about anything -Life was good. But I couldn't really find any real joy during those two weeks. That's because my serotonin levels were lower than usual and my body couldn't use the substance to the same extent to make me feel happy.  Ever since I've learned how much is enough for me and I've found a good balance in my usage.  I have a friend who is deep into LSD and Weed, she's a very experienced drug user and had a great time while trying MDMA for the first time. She does, however, have low serotonin levels to begin with (and fairly big mood swings in her everyday life because of this) and her comedown after what I'd consider a rather small dosage of MDMA (3 lines in one night) was severe. She was feeling extremely depressed for about a full week.  TL;DR - MDMA is NOT depression-inducing, but it fucks with your signaling substances in your brain, and if you don't have ""normal"" levels of serotonin in a sober state then comedown will be heavy."
Drugs,3dw373,_paramedic,3,Mon Jul 20 05:57:00 2015 UTC,The empathogenic nature of MDMA can help some people connect better with others or with their own emotions.
Drugs,3dw373,Timberwolf_88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:44:59 2015 UTC,"MDMA works by allowing your brain to release more signaling substances than usual (it allows a greater flow of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine). Both dopamine and serotonin releases is what sparks an euphoric sensation whereas norepinephrine is a stress hormone that increases heart-rate.  MDMA works for people with anxiety or depression by showing you a constant flow of good emotions. If you've ever managed to stress your way (hyping yourself) to getting a tiny little kick while happy then you know what that kick feels like (everyone has).  These good emotions and this state of euphoria will not help you with depression or anxiety, etc. unless you talk to someone about these troubles while on the serotonin release however, thus a psychiatrist or a good friend is often needed.  A lot of people I'm good friends with that have done MDMA with me have ended up talking feelings and you show loads of true affection for each other, we also have one friend who had an extremely bad childhood; he had a full release of emotions and troubles that he's kept tucked away for almost 20 years. a few months later he picked up his pace, took his degree and traveled the world.  In general terms MDMA works by helping you break down the mental barriers you've set up in your mind, and it does so at an astonishing rate.  A patient who would usually need about 50 hours of therapy before the defenses are brought down and the core issue can be dealt with would (on MDMA), on average, need only about 5 hours of the same type of sessions before the core can be reached."

Drugs,3dw373,Timberwolf_88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:49:55 2015 UTC,"Completely depends on what kind of depression your friend has. And the most useful setting for MDMA the first time (especially with someone who is depressed/have issues) is NOT a party, but rather a secure, safe and welcoming/comfortable environment, some MDMA and possibly some weed to help the body relax a bit when one can tense up from the stress hormone release. I'd suggest an Indica strain for a body high rather than an uplifting head high."

But the very dull feeling, that the best parts of my life have already passed. And I couldn't figure out a solution. So the next feeling was ""why go on, it's not going to solve anything"".  Now my first roll. I did it on a festival, so no teurapeutic sessions but just a very good time, with good people and music. What it did show me was that I can feel good again. I did realise this was a state of mind, just induced by some chemicals. So I also realised that those depressed feelings where a state of mind, something that can be changed (with or without some chemical help). That was what made the difference to me. I can change how I feel."
Drugs,3dw373,hashmon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:22:08 2015 UTC,"OP, I've rolled well over 100 times, and I've never gotten a ""comedown."" I always absolutely amazing the following day. It's called the afterglow. I think MDMA has incredible potential in helping people overcome being depressed, if it's used properly. (Don't combine it with stimulants or alcohol- that's the most important thing.)  Are you bring up ""comedowns"" because you've actually experienced that, or because you've read about it? Because every single person I know IRL who takes MDMA, quite a few people, says he feels greet the following day. And from what I can tell online, most if not all of the reports of ""comedowns"" involve mixing MDMA with other drugs, usually several other drugs (and I'm not even counting weed), and it usually also involved taking WAY too big doses. There seem to be some exceptions, some people who feel shitty the day after taking normal doses MDMA for whatever reason, but they're a distinct minority. The key is getting pure stuff and taking it in a controlled setting. It can show you a new light in life; it's up to you to run with that energy."
Drugs,3dw373,relbatnrut,2,Mon Jul 20 14:37:59 2015 UTC,"You're an anomaly. Most people I know feel distinctly weird the days after MDMA...if not bad, then off in some way. Doses are usually 125mg. Not mixed with anything except weed.  It makes sense; it's not exactly subtle in what it does in your brain. It wouldn't make much sense it releasing a bunch of serotonin didn't make you feel strange for a while.  Obviously different people react differently, but I think you're extrapolating too much from your experiences. There's a reason why there are thousands of threads all over the internet with thousands of views about depression after MDMA use."

Drugs,3dw373,Timberwolf_88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:40:38 2015 UTC,"It's a well documented fact that the body uses more serotonin and dopamine than usual (it's what's creating the high), and those levels are lower (not as low as initially thought but still lower than when sober prior to taking MDMA), so yes, it's very common for people to feel emotionally disconnected, just generally indifferent or outright depressed if you're a person with low serotonin levels even when sober.  First off I'm questioning whether or not you have any idea of what you speak of. And secondly I question what you claim that you're selling is even pure MDMA. Most of the MDMA/E sold is in powder or pill form, and more often than not mixed with other shit (caffeine is extremely common, so is amphetamines) which gives the user both different highs but also very different afterlow and comedowns."
Drugs,3dw373,hashmon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:23:14 2015 UTC,"Have you felt depressed after MDMA? People you know? Or are you just regurgitating Internet rumors? I'm interested in the former, nit the latter.  Look. I have a decade of intimate experience with MDMA. Yes, I've taken (and sold) my share of methylone and what not over the years, but I've taken lots and lots of tested MDMA and MDA, as well. What's normally associated with the experience, from everything I've gone through and have seen others go through, as well as the stories you can read about the history of MDMA therapy, is that it leaves people feeling spectacular the following day, and usually for days after. This is why it' so effective at treating PTSD. You should listen to some of these people who have had their very severe trauma headed by MDMA; it's very touching. They don't speak of over overcoming some nasty day after blues; they talk about it positively changing the direction if their lives, giving the, meaning and inspiration again, etc. It's a long process, and MDMA is the primary factor. That's the effect it's always had on me, as well, and unless maybe you're part if a very tiny minority that may respond negatively (people on a lot o psychiatric drugs may be in that category), I'm sure it'll do the same to you. It's an amazing substance, and should be legalized ASAP so this society can collectively begin to heal, cause we're all fucked up."

Drugs,3dwqpm,chocolatellama,11,Mon Jul 20 04:17:45 2015 UTC,"Apparently it works well if done right, I haven't tried this but u/uncooluserid had a great post in r/DMT about what he does. Here's the text of it: Ok, don't listen to the nay-sayers in this thread. This method ABSOLUTELY works. I have been smoking DMT consistently since the end of 2008, I have tried numerous methods including: Bubble/pookie (it's a meth pipe) stem pipe the machine Glass vapor Genie Weed pipe Bong Volcano Laced joint Hash oil vape pen and of all the ways I have found to do it, over the last 6 years now, has been an e-cig using a Nautilus Mini. It is absolutely effective, and absolutely allows for breakthroughs WITHOUT the need of a lighter, complicated intake system, or wall outlet. I have shared this with a large number of people, many of them having issues in the past with taste or difficulty smoking. This method makes it 100% easy. No learning curve, no harsh taste, no worry of not getting enough fast enough, no reloading or not being able to blast off with others. I currently use a regular Kanger tech battery attached to a plain old Nautilus mini. The gravity fed nautilus tank is IDEAL. This is my preferred space shuttle and I absolutely see no reason to use anything else (personally).  DMT saturates into Propelyne glycol, meaning that it will dissolve from it's crystalline state into a liquid form if added to a 100% PG solution. This is an option, but putting it into a 100% PG solution doesn't allow the molecule to recrystallize, and after 6 months may be a little weaker than when you first made it. The answer is to use a mixture around 90/10 or 80/20 Propelyne Glycol to Vegetable Glycerin. Using a mixture with even a small amount of VG in it seems to allow your spice to reform a matrix and, because it's still safely stored in the tank, it doesn't oxidize, lasting  much longer. The only catch is closing the airflow to your nautilus tank, filling a cup with hot water, and dipping your tank into the water until your spice has remelted into the solution.  Additionally, UNLIKE WHAT A POSTER BELOW WROTE, mixing DMT into a e-cig juice is a extremely pleasant smoke. The multiple options of e-cig fluid flavors allow you to compliment the DMT smoke however you want, and the low heat from the battery doesn't burn the DMT, allowing it to vape at a low temp and not be harsh. IT TASTES LIKE ANGEL KISSES ON YOUR EYELIDS BROTHER! Here is another MAJOR benefit to the E-pen method: You are NO LONGER restricted to only 3 hits. ""You only get 3 hits"" is a myth, and only applicable due to certain intake methods. If you make your intake method as simple as possible (for example, hold it up to your face and just keep breathing) you can feasibly take as many hits as possible within 45-60 seconds before the DMT starts being fully consumed by your body. That's right, it's not a 3 hit rule, its a 45-60 second rule, and even that isn't always applicable. Do you know how many times you can hit an e-cig in 45 seconds? A lot. I usually only manage to take 4-5 really big hits, where I am completely filling my lungs, before I forget I am even holding a pen. The correct solution ratio is NOT a microdose, but the correct ratio IS the most important part of this method. So, the ratio myself and many friends have found to work best is 1 gram of DMT to 1 Ml of e-cig fluid. You can even push it and go up to 1.2-1.3 ml, but much more and you'll start to notice that it will take a couple more hits to achieve complete breakthrough. I do sometimes like to mix a solution with more fluid than DMT to smoke at festivals for a slower and more controllable onset. If you want to make some hyper space juice though, go 1 gram to one milliliter. Here is how you mix the solution: Crush up your molecule into a fine powder (if it is freebase crystal) so that it melts more readily under heat. Larger chunks of crystal take longer to dissolve. You will need to place your spice into a small glass vial or jar (I use a 2 ounce glass vial from the health food store), then take your Ml of fluid and pour it into the vial with your spice. this will seem like a really small amount of fluid compared to a pile of powdered material, and it may not mix right away, but don't panic! Once we are finished it's going to look like like any unassuming e-liquid. After mixing the two together, boil some water in a kettle. Fill two cups with hot water. With the first cup, make some tea. It will be quite lovely and relaxing. With the second cup of hot water, dip your sealed glass vial into the water, being careful to not completely submerge it. The vial will essentially double boil the DMT/e-liquid, applying low enough heat to melt the molecule and mix it with the base fluid.  The spice will have melted within less than 5 minutes, it's really fast, and when it's done it will look like e-fluid with oily rainbow swirls running through it. This is your finished solution. A 1:1 ratio will make roughly 2 Ml of finished, ready, Hyperspace juice. Once you've got this, simply pour it into your nautilus mini, prime it up like you would any other tank, turn on the battery, and puff until you cant remember how. Once the solution is mixed, you can take it ANYWHERE and it looks completely inconspicuous, even more inconspicuous than a joint or hash pen. You can smoke it in bed, on a windy mountain, or even in public at an event if you'd like. No learning curve either, just hold it to your face, and fill your lungs each time (I usually double press the button on the battery to avoid the automatic shut off time). With this ratio using a full gram I typically get 10-15 full trips w/ breakthrough per milliliter, so if you have 2 Ml of solution, that's roughly 20-30 full trips from 1 gram, which is actually really really good bang for amount of spice used. Basically a 50mg blast off each time rest assured, and none of your smoke is lost/wasted/burned. This is the third time this topic has come up, with people saying it doesn't work. I think It's time I write you guys a tech with some pictures. Next time my supply refills I will show everyone a step by step walkthrough for this really wonderful method."

If it's just cotton and a coil it's be hard to get the dmt to burn right so that you get all of it and break through. Throw dmt on a bowl of bud and torch the shit out of it or do a dab of it. Pookies (bulb pipes) aren't that hard to use either and they start vaporizing the dmt at more comfortable temps.   Vapes also rip a lot harder than a bong. The water and percs help worlds. DMT through my nice 2 foot roor absolutely wrecks my lungs. You don't want to vape it and ruin your trip because you cough and you feel like you can't breathe going into it. You don't have much time between the hit and the trip. Not worth it imo.  I have done it with a globe for wax. It hurt. Bad.  Do DMT normally. The conventional way drugs are done are done for a reason. It's the easiest and most efficient method. Don't try to reinvent the wheel when it comes to doing your stuff."

Zaps, from what i understand - with very little scientific research on the subject - are most likely due to some kind of nerve or brainwave abnormality. I wouldnt be too concerned. At the peak of those years it was a daily occurance - and as terrifying as it was, i got used to it. One of the times i took shrooms during those years, the zaps occured many times that night, and for once was accompanied with a vision of breaking glass, within my mind. Scary shit, but even scary gets old. Im fine these days...

Personally i love the zopiclone hallucinations as the GABA effects keep you ultra calm through its just wierd and alien. Not sure how it would mix with MDMA tho. Im guessing the amp of MDMA destroyed the calmness of the zopi and kicked in the paranoia/anxiety.  Those hallucinations match up 100% with zopiclone imo. check out ambien (zoldipem) trip reports for some similar accounts."

You even put yourself under restriction for coke because you could feel the addictice potential. Althought when I read this line: ""I was desesperate for something"" my mind changed a bit. Like if your parents start restricting you and you become desesperate for a buzz, in a sense you might actually have a small problem at some point. Im not saying youre an addict but maybe you gotta rethink your consumption and the reasons why you do it. I can admit ive had a similar pass  where i would always try my best to get my daily weed and I can also tell you this isn't necessarily permanent. As for what a counselor would say: same usual shit talk bout drugs. Maybe if you get a good one he'll  understand some of the reasons why you take drugs but it will always end up with him trying to make you realize its useless. And your parents will probably never understand although they might accept it at some point. I understand this can be a real big source of stress and it might always be as long as you take drugs under their roof. The only tip I can give you is inform yourself as best as you can and then decide what you wanna do with your drug consumption.

Only my fifth doc recognized medication is a small part of a larger set of therapy for treating ADHD.  The majority of people prescribed ADHD medication have no mental conditions whatsoever, they were just not too bright and not too interesting, but taking a stimulant helps out in both of those departments. Hell one of my best friends has been prescribed adderall, not for anything related to ADD or ADHD, but to ""improve mood"". That is the listed reason on her medical chart.  The rest of 'em that actually do have ADHD are being given stimulants without guidance and therapy. Really?

If you can somehow make them understand that recreational drug use is fine then go for it, but I have never witnessed parents with the means/desire to send their child to a drug counselour be convinced that recreational drug use is ok (especially while you're still a minor).  Additionally, at your age you can expect to hear nothing from this counselor but what you would expect. They have seen many of ""your type"" before and will not be magically convinced by you that drug use might be ok. The best you can probably do is convince them you will stop or stop until you are not dependent on your parents, which they can forward onto your parents.

It doesn't help when the people telling you you're wrong about drugs are wrong themselves, it's frustrating.

Drugs,3duv1e,marijuanapots,28,Sun Jul 19 18:40:00 2015 UTC,I think this is really true. I would buy for a weekend but wind up snorting 5he whole weekend supply on friday. Then I'd hermit the rest of the weekend.  However I got tired of being depressed every sat/sun so I just kept doing bumps all weekend until it became bumps during the week so I didn't feel sad. It's not necessarily addiction because one day I realized I was being rediculous about it. Rook 4 days off work. Locked myself inside assuming I'd go through crazy withdrawal. I didnt. I did feel super depressed and contemplated suicide for lime 2 mins but after those 4 days I was done. Yet when I went abstinent of alcohol I felt suicidal had terrible withdrawals and didn't want to be alive for almost 2 weeks.

If he puts a couple 8 balls on the table, guaranteed they will keep going back & back & back until there is nothing left, it is like a compulsion.  He also said its a waste because they do not get any higher. Another thing he told me & I tend to believe as he has been doing it for 30 odd years & that is doing lines of coke is also a waste. He said it was for people who want to look the part & feel like rock stars.  He gave me this little mechanical device (pre loaded:)) and said it administers a bump at a time & that is all you ever need.  Interested to see what others think of that.  The other thing he told me was that he can tell instantly if the coke is crap because it blocks up his nose and causes inflammation.  He put me in contact with someone in Vegas while we were there who got me some & he got some too (on different days)  He came to my room & I gave him some, he took a bit and said ""what the hell is this shit""  I don't know, he is your contact, I said. He was straight on the phone & got me a replacement, no questions asked.

I can control the urges to buy it, but at the mention of it I want some to put up my nose asap. I don't enjoy cocaine, it doesn't make me feel high. I know that I have done it, and can tell when it wears off, yet I don't feel up from it or any euphoria. Despite the fact that I don't like it, I find thoughts randomly drifting through my mind about how much I would love to do a line or gum some. The only thing that could cause these thoughts is my brain craving it because it's so addicting. I personally don't like it when I'm on coke, so idk why I crave it other than the fact that it stimulates the brains rewards system and makes me want more. Every time I do coke, I don't want to do it again after. However, someone offers me up some lines and I'm on it. After the first all I want is more coke. It's a confusing drug. Its something that doesn't seem too addicting at first, but what it does to your brain draws you in very quickly."

Drugs,3dx7pj,getmeoutofthiswormho,6,Mon Jul 20 07:42:07 2015 UTC,"MXE is really weird in the sense that really low doses(15-40mg) give you a 'functional high'. The 'warm blanket' feeling, the alcohol-ish tipsyness(speaking of which: if I take a bump of MXE and drink a single drink, I'm exactly where I need to be for the night) and the very mild uplift are all very very nice. However, when you start dosing higher(50-200mg) you get the more hallucinogenic type effects like intense close-eyed visuals and the dissociative stuff that leads to 'holing'.  This kind of duality in usage allows MXE to become VERY appealing very fucking quickly. I didn't redose excessively during my experimentations with the drug but very very often I would leave for a social interaction by taking a bump and then come back home and get involved in the dissociative experience. This kind of versatility leads MXE to become a VERY FUCKING APPEALING DRUG.  So yes, it is very good for chilling out and relaxing and it is very good for going out and being social, but I advise caution because this versatility makes the drug very appealing for re-dosing and regular usage. I've never been addicted to anything but nicotine but MXE's the closest thing I've come to it.  I've never taken ketamine but if you're not interested in the dissociative experience, if redosing is your only concern and you trust your levels of self-control, I'd advise MXE to be 'better' here.

Drugs,3dvu62,etofantomas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:23:20 2015 UTC,"Well humans are very complex, so it makes sense that it would be much more difficult for a parasite to have more powerful control over us.  Keep looking though, I recall reading about several different parasites that alter the way people behave.  Also, all it takes is one mutation or something and a parasite that was once powerless against us can suddenly have a huge impact.  Can you imagine if cordyceps evolved to affect humans?"

My body and music had excellent synergy, I'm a decent dancer normally but I'd say it improved the timing and without question the feel of the music.  I can imagine Candy flipping or just LSD by itself would be an even more intense experience, trance/ reggae for me would be perfect for it; but any music would be amazing.   MDMA for me personally made me a MUCH better dancer and I'm curious to know what others think of that fact, I can imagine any mind altering substance; effects the way music effects your conciousness and thus music itself."

They are an improvisational band that plays their music and then they modify it according to how much the crowd likes it. They are one of my favorites and I'm a really crazy dancer like I don't give a fuck what anyone thinks about how weird I look I just go with the flow. When I was happy and present in the moment I was moving exactly to the music and then I was able to add my own additions to the music through my movements. Like a symbiotic relation where the music was controlling my movement yet my movements also controlled the music. I felt one with the music and I could tell they knew that because they'd be looking at me and even rapped about me at one point haha. It felt like I was the conductor and those two dudes on stage the orchestra. Amazing experience.

Playing the drums or guitar on a psychedelic is the most powerful experience I've ever had. It's like you and your band mates connect in a deeper level of communication than words, you start thinking with the same mind and taking it places you never thought you'd go, you play so fucking hard, and so long. You'll play a song and get lost in the jam, all of the sudden it's been 35 minutes, the song you started playing is nowhere to be found. It's like meditation, you get into a trance and lose your ego.

Further to this you can also try spreading your dose over the course of 30 minutes to make the comeup less abrupt.

Drugs,3dxqfi,Crawling_To_My_Goals,3,Mon Jul 20 14:52:11 2015 UTC,"Get crystal MDMA and weight about 150mg of it. That shouldn't be too much and will be a comfortable roll. The comeup is uncomfortable for many people. You just have to relax, know your dose and maybe supplement."

Drugs,3dwk9w,Juicy_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:12:02 2015 UTC,"What drugs are you considering?   Weed, for example, is simple. Take your buds, bake them for around a half hour at 225¬∞ or so to decarboxylate inactive cannabinoids into active varieties. Then toss them in the freezer, with some 95% isopropyl alcohol in a separate jar, overnight. In the morning, put the buds in the jar, and shake. Place back into the freezer, repeat a few times over six minutes or so. Filter out the plant material, and evaporate the alcohol off. Dank liquid you can use right off.   Other drugs may be a bit more of a pain. They may not be soluble in propylene glycol or vegetable glycerin, in which case your vape will be useless for them."
Drugs,3dwk9w,chkethley,4,Mon Jul 20 03:28:42 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a lot of work for the weed. I have a chamber that can use dry herb, so I just grind it and put it right in the chamber, works perfectly well."
Drugs,3dwk9w,Keshick,3,Mon Jul 20 04:35:27 2015 UTC,"I agree! Dry vape is fantastic, especially if you've got a variable temperature vaporizer. It's possible to really tailor your high just the way you want it.   His original question, however, was in relation to a vaporizer that one would use for nicotine juice. It's also much more stealth to use oils. Mix it in with nic juice and there's absolutely no scent. I can vape my ganja throughout the day at work, and nobody has a clue."
Drugs,3dwk9w,flPieman,2,Mon Jul 20 04:47:44 2015 UTC,"Ah, right. I didn't realize he wanted the drugs to be in liquid form.   Haha, that would be interested to smoke marijuana with no one smelling it. I mean using a vaporizer even with dry herb still smells way less strong than something like a joint, but if you got near it it's still stinky.   Don't they make THC juice? I've seen it before, I think. Never used it though so I don't know if it smells or not. Also it's green (the ones I've seen) so that might be a red flag if it's vaped in public.   Idk. I'm not helpful lol"
Drugs,3dwk9w,Keshick,2,Mon Jul 20 04:58:23 2015 UTC,"Hahaha it's all good! That's why we're here, to share information.   I can't attest to whether or not prepackaged THC juice smells or not. Honestly, the QWISO method I detailed has some scent to it if vaped by itself, but mixed with a flavored juice and it's indistinguishable. I was able to ride in the truck with my journeyman, vaping my juice, and he had absolutely no idea. For months. Absolutely wonderful, if I say so myself.   Another benefit is that additional washes can be performed, and each one will be more of a sedative. Third wash knocks me right the hell out.   I don't see green liquid being a red flag - lots of nicotine e-juices are green. My only concern would be if an obvious minor were vaping near me. That could be considered contributing to the delinquency of a minor where I'm at."

People try to reinvent the wheel with their drug use but you simply don't. Drug are done the way they are because it's often the easiest and most efficient method. When it comes to drugs the easy way is the best way. Swallow your pills, acid on tongue, dmt smoked regularly, bud burned with a lighter or made into edibles, bomb your e.  Keep. It. Normal."

Yes, people have had bad trips which ruin subsequent trips or even ruin weed. Trauma from bad trips can be so intense that people feel worse sober for a long time afterwards. I managed to break things that badly.  It doesn't seem like you hit any sort of personal psychological issue there. Apparently you just wanted it to stop, and went down a bad path because you can't simply stop a trip like that.  You need to get better at handling those things and/or give it some time and trip in a different environment.  Don't let the fact that you experienced wonderful things before deceive you into thinking that psychedelics normally only give you pleasant stuff. They can also bring negative things. That's not dangerous or harmful; your reaction is what causes the harm."

Drugs,3dv9xn,soulman12397,3,Mon Jul 20 07:22:28 2015 UTC,"The immediate problem was that you did it by yourself, and more than usual. Shrooms can get very overwhelming at high doses. I once took and eighth of cubensis, and after two hours i wasnt feeling it so i ate another eighth and 30 minutes later it all hit me at once and i got an immediate feeling of dread and anxiety. Eventually i started having a good trip, but not before i passed out in a gas station and almost had the police called. I havent done shrooms since, but I am a big fan of acid and i find the trips a lot more enjoyable. My advice would be if you are going to do shrooms again, you HAVE to be in the mindset that everything will be ok. try writing a note or something before you trip that says something like ""I took shrooms, this isnt permanent, everything is fine.""

After a while some of the caps that I ate that were working wonderfully during the first part of the evening, and as the night dragged on the trip started slowing down, so I figured,  ""Hey, lets smoke, that'd probably keep it rolling a bit longer.""  Keep in mind that I smoke on a pretty regular basis, so I ended up sharing a J i had with a buddy of mine. Soon after the J stopped burning however, I started feeling flashes of numbness in my body. Almost like I was close to having a seizure. I knew I needed to leave where I was immediately and try to calm myself down. I ended up freezing my nuts off outside staring up at my dorm room buildings, which were wiggling around and swaying with the breeze. I could feel my brain rolling around inside my skull and could feel every muscle in my body trying to stay relaxed. After I rode out the intense visual/body high part of the trip, I eventually felt cool enough to go back inside, but I still felt a bit off.  Usually after tripping I feel alright the next day, but something felt weird when I woke up. After a while, even smoking weed started to trip me out, but after a couple times I was able to get over the anxiety I was feeling at the time.  I don't think the effects are permanent, but I know what you're talking about and it kinda freaks me out too."

Drugs,3dwawa,TripAddict,2,Mon Jul 20 05:23:48 2015 UTC,You should be fine. I took well over 900mg my first time and had a blast!
Drugs,3dwawa,Tnyrbt,2,Mon Jul 20 11:51:01 2015 UTC,"As a person who's taken high doses of dxm with no trip experience whatsoever, I believe you'll be fine, but heres a few tips:  Take some benadryl, between 50-75mg is enough to stop the itches.  Dont scratch the itch!! You WILL itch like crazy but dont scratch, it wont help.  Smoke some weed and calm down.  Create a playlist of your favorite songs. You'll thanks me later.  Enjoy your trip to the Dextro-verse"
Drugs,3dwawa,drugaway69,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:16:43 2015 UTC,"Whether or not you can handle it is a little bit late to discuss. Instead take these helpful tips to help you through your journey   calm music / music that you like. If you're a fan of death metal I might suggest choosing something a little more mellow lol. Stay hydrated try not to do any activities that will require fine movements (washing dishes, being around family without blatantly looking out of it) You will feel disassociated so your motor skills won't be as great, vision will blur, and you might have some hallucinations (depends on the person.)   Robotripping in general is pretty dumb (IN MY OWN HUMBLE OPINION) so hopefully this will be enough for you to learn your lesson / wouldn't recommend repeated use. If you've done psychs you'll most likely be able to handle the head space but it might be slightly more chaotic. Best of luck"
Drugs,3dwawa,fiendforever,13,Mon Jul 20 01:59:57 2015 UTC,Robotripping in general is pretty dumb so hopefully this will be enough for you to learn your lesson   You were fine right up until there. Whats with the ungrounded pointless and detrimental criticism of a completely viable drug. You might as well have said Dissociatives are dumb. No reason to needlessly hate on any drug.  Personally I hate DXM but thats no reason to talk down to other people who enjoy it
Drugs,3dwawa,drugaway69,2,Mon Jul 20 02:22:07 2015 UTC,"Was referring to kids who hear about drinking cough syrup from friends and take too high of a dose (like the situation in this post). DXM has high abusive potential and can cause long term damage (as can most drugs) so idc   ungrounded pointless and detrimental criticism of a completely viable drug   Datura could be considered a viable drug but to most it isn't. Saying DXM is a viable drug to use is just your opinion. My point was that abusing DXM isn't a good idea (which it isn't), and as far as ungrounded there are enough posts on this forum alone that show DXM isn't perfect and can cause problems."
Drugs,3dwawa,fiendforever,2,Mon Jul 20 02:34:05 2015 UTC,My point was that abusing DXM isn't a good idea (which it isn't)   I thought you might compare DXM to something that has legitimate dangers like datura soo yea let me ask plainly.   How exactly is using DXM recreationally any  more harmful than any other dissociative? As far as I know it isn't any worse than say MXE at all. So what problems are you referring to?  I am honestly just wondering what criticisms you have because I would say the general consensus on this forum and across the internet is that DXM is a perfectly viable and relatively safe substance
Drugs,3dwawa,drugaway69,2,Mon Jul 20 02:38:33 2015 UTC,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_use_of_dextromethorphan#Risks_associated_with_use  Read the first paragraph of that. It looks like DXM has only been used regularly since maybe the early 90's(?), goes on to say brain damage has not been  proven or disproven. Can lead to a slew of other things and can cause withdrawal symptoms. While I'm not trying to say that it will damage you from using it recreationally, I am saying that there is still potential for it to be more harmful than people generally think.  Again, I'm sure there is potential for it to be abused relatively safely. I never said it would be more harmful than any other dissociative, I'm sure it wouldn't fuck you up anywhere near as badly as something like datura. But it is important to keep in mind that even though it's legal, it's still a relatively new drug and long term effects of recreational use are still fairly unknown ."

Drugs,3dxdjr,znayu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:42:02 2015 UTC,"You might want to up your dose a bit. Also keep in mind that (especially when snorting) you will want to redose. Either limit yourself by only taking one dose with you or just prepare for redosing. I find that the high lasts only around 2 hours after that it's just stimulation. I'm usually able to sleep 6 to 8 hours after my last dose, but the last 3 hours aren't fun at all because I came down already."
Drugs,3dxdjr,znayu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:50:52 2015 UTC,Ive never messed around with amphetamines much(the occasional 10mg IR adderall once in every blue moon) so i don't really wanna over do it. Id do my initial dosage before leaving to work then if i felt like redose id bring a small dose and do it either a third or half way through my shift
Drugs,3dxdjr,LordDongler,3,Mon Jul 20 09:55:19 2015 UTC,"If all you want is to stay up, look into Modafinil or one of its prodrugs (check out /r/afinil for sourcing). I think it would be wiser to try speed first and if it doesn't work for you give 2-FMA a try. Speed is more fun, but 2-FMA supposedly lasts longer.  EDIT:Also, I'd dose orally to get longer duration."

Drugs,3dvq3o,DoctorJello,2,Mon Jul 20 00:19:25 2015 UTC,"First of all you're aiming a bit high with dosages. There's this idea that the bigger you are the less hard you trip/roll. That's not true. There's also very little to no cross tolerance with mdma so I'd say if you want to do this you do 3/4 of the tab (as close to 75ug) as you can and then the one 100mg. I find LSD can overpower MDMA if you overshoot and LSD in something you usually want to dose lower than the MDMA. Then take .05 and the fourth quarter if ya want. I recognize this doesn't change much but you may very well find yourself overwhelmed so I say better to start low. You can't untake your drugs, you can always take more. Good luck with your flip :)  I will always recommend you take a substance alone before mixing it but I feel that there isn't much risk. That being said I still HIGHLY recommend the mdma alone first."

Drugs,3dvq3o,plainpenguin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:52:54 2015 UTC,"Given I would also consider myself highly apathetic, I think I'll go with just the MDMA. Do you think 150 followed by a 50mg redose an hour and a half later is good or would you do it differently? Also how's cannabis while rolling? Does it synergize with MDMA like it does for psychs?"
Drugs,3dvq3o,Pretentiousandrich,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:06:10 2015 UTC,The mix is amazing and also is actually better for you because most of the neurotoxicity mdma is related to the rise in body temperature. Weed lowers body temp and significantly reduces the mdma neurotoxicity. Google it if you don't take my word (I would recommend the roll safe website).  Don't roll alone. It is an empathetic drug. Do it with a great sound system to techno or house with people you care about. Trust me on this.

Drugs,3dvq3o,plainpenguin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:57:50 2015 UTC,"As the other guy told you, I would recommend doing it with people you know really well, as far as the redose goes, it'll probably last 30-60 minutes longer. I didn't do a redose, but some of the people I was with did it, and it lasted a bit longer for them, but I didn't really feel like it mattered that much. But yeah, about an hour and a half later seems like a fine time to take it, depends on how fast the first dose kicks in for you I guess."
Drugs,3dvq3o,thirdegree,2,Mon Jul 20 11:45:06 2015 UTC,"Alone. Candyflipping is amazing, but imo it's best if you know what parts of the experience come from which drug. Plus MDMA alone is also amazing."

Drugs,3dtols,lonbaws,4,Sun Jul 19 12:12:26 2015 UTC,"Excellent question. At the time of tripping it wasn't very personal. It was just me taking in everything. To start off it was very mindblowing and most of it was hard to interpret while it happened. The days after the trip was more personal, it did make me reflect on life in several ways afterwards.   You should try it out if you want to, I highly recommend this one. I do think I started out hard tho. I tried lighter doses, 50mg, 80mg and 100mg. At under 100mg it's a lot more introspective and personal to me."

I was surprised by the auditory hallucinations, the pitch noise was extremely loud and it felt like it got all the way to the center of your head.  It hurts a lot to snort this chemical just so you know, but you'll pretty much forget about it once it kicks in. I tried oral at 200mg and it did nothing.

Drugs,3dtols,thecheezed,2,Sun Jul 19 15:23:40 2015 UTC,"The whole void thing lasted what I believe was everything from 20 minutes to 30 minutes, it's hard to tell since I couldn't tell the time when I wanted to, and your perception of time is really blown to pieces. It feels a lot longer than it lasts which is typical for a drugs like DMT and DPT. It was 3 hours of the true effects, with 2 of those hours being overly body sensation focused. The first hour being the more psychedelic part. Then it fades away which takes about an hour.  It definitely lasts a lot longer than DMT. Erowid states the duration is about 2 to 4 hours which is true. I noticed that the more you dose the longer the experience will be."

Same with tv, computer, phone etc; Do shit during your trip to wear yourself out at the end. Sitting around all night with friends chatting is too casual. When you're done tripping, you want to feel DONE.   Now if you aren't opposed to the drug route xans are useful but I recommend valium or kpins (valium first imo)  Or you do what I do and take an adderall to power through the next day. Take a half dose on the comedown and then the another half dose +5mg 12 hours from when you want to sleep. Your adderall will wear out when you're ready to go to bed and you will pass the fuck out."

Drugs,3dvgai,zeitgeist11,14,Sun Jul 19 21:24:43 2015 UTC,"you've gone and developed social anxiety yourself I'm afraid. anxieties that you develop during a trip often persist after it's ended if they're not resolved before you come down. I'd like to tell you it'll go away by itself but unlike post-trip depression SAD isn't due to a chemical imbalance in the brain, but due to a self-defeating attitude towards social interaction.   the main thing you need to realise is that 99% of what you are feeling is entirely in your head. your personality hasn't changed at all, you are NOT a fundamentally more awkward person than you were before but once you become fixated on what you're saying, whether you seem awkward etc. etc. it means you're using all your cognitive faculties focused on those things rather than, as in someone without social anxiety, enjoying the conversation and coming up with things to say. social anxiety is nothing more than pathological self-awareness, where you're so concentrated on trying to say the right things you end up saying the wrong things... it's analogous to someone trying to be funny. social interaction, like humour, isn't something that can be forced. it needs to be spontaneous.    what you need to do is develop an attitude change. you need to go into interactions NOT worrying about what you're going to say. you will notice that any conversation you have where you aren't worrying goes very smoothly. the issue with social anxiety is that it's self-propagating, so bad social interactions caused by the social anxiety feed the fear of coming across as awkward, meaning that you become even more self-aware and, as such, more awkward. so long as you realise that this prison you feel like you're in was one you built for yourself you will have the means to escape it. I know saying ""don't think about the anxiety"" just makes you, well, think about the anxiety (another reason why anxiety disorders are so insidious- the only way to actually get rid of them is literally to stop thinking about them), but if you go into a conversation and arm yourself with the knowledge that your actual ability to have a good interaction with someone is unchanged, and that the anxiety is itself what is causing your issues, over time you'll regain the confidence to talk to people again. you'll find that with each good interaction the nervousness will become less and less crippling.   another good tip is that you should use the successful social interactions you have as evidence to prove to yourself that you're improving. it's fairly typical of anxiety sufferers to wallow in self-pity that they are not getting better but that is not conducive to recovery... the more you worry, the worse the worrying becomes. like I said, it's a self-sustaining cycle. instead, keeping a kind of mental record of how much better you're getting (because if you approach the coming months in the right way you WILL improve, and fast), will give you confidence which is what you're fundamentally lacking."

They make it to show why you should legalize things because compared to alcohol they are much better/safer.  The problem is that this video and many like it show how horrible alcohol, thus giving fuel to people wanting to ban it. A video like this will never ever convert someone who is against the thing you compare to alcohol. And a person already using/liking the drug you compare to alcohol is already converted and the video means nothing except for maybe some educational benefit.  It would be a much better strategy to just talk about the benefit of legalizing and try and get facts on why we should legalize it. As in, how does society benefit from having it legalized compared to having it illegal."

Drugs,3drul6,JM1210,3,Sun Jul 19 13:10:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure about the quote from Terrence Mckenna. Is having people being re-opinionated because of shrooms really something the government would be incentivised to prevent? I can't imagine that the DEA was discussing the scheduling and said ""Oh no! Taking these, people might realise that they're kind of okay with their lives - better give it a class A"".  The reason pysilocybin is illegal is because it is illegal. Back in the 60s-70s when the war on drugs started and we ended up with blanket laws based on ignorance, pysilocybin got caught in the net despite being a soft drug. And since then there hasn't been enough effort to reverse this (like there has been for weed) and we have a culture, at least in policy making that assumes that drugz er bad. So it stays that way.  Maybe it's conformation bias, but I notice this all over reddit where when the way the government does something comes into question people assume that we're living in some sort of Orwellian state, saying that policy is really an instrument of control. But it's not that simple. Just because a policy isn't sensible - even objectively so, doesn't mean that it's some sort of instrument of mass control. It could just be a bad policy, which means an effort needs to be made to change it. For example, effort was made to legalise weed, and here we are with the legal states are propping up."

I told some of my family that I'm waiting to apply for a job so I'll pass a drug test. Weed is literally the only thing that helps me sleep. I've been on many different sleeping pills all to very little success. No otc meds worked. And prescription either wouldn't work or had massive side effects that would leave me unable to function even when given more than 12 hours between taking it and needing to get up. Weed is the hardest thing I really do anymore. I fucking hate drinking. And I'm 19, so it's a hassle for me to even get beer, which works to a much lesser extent. I got 12 hours of sleep this week. My aunt teared up, clearly hurt by this fact. My dad looked saddened. I didn't see my uncle's face. It's the only thing that lets me sleep God dammit. I don't go to work high. I don't drive high. I treat it just like I would alcohol, because that's the way the law should handle it. And as a younger generation begins taking power and gaining influence we see the stigma begin to change, but these ties run deep. And for most of my family religion is heavily involved too, only worsening their feelings of sadness they have as they feel I've chosen the wrong path. I know what works best for me. And I'm gonna do what it takes to be the best version of me, even if it means upsetting them. Unfortunately the next step up requires reliving that period of no sleep.

But we've used it so long and people enjoy it for it to be controlled like any other drug.  While current drugs are used by less people due to false information of them being unsafe or fucking you up.    I do think in the view of someone that drinks alcohol, or doesn't think alcohol is that bad (which is a lot of politicians), this can make quite the impact on their view.

I definitely think he does a good job of helping those unaware of the specifics of psilocybin and the sort realize how silly it is to keep psilocybin, THC, mescaline, and others of the sort in such a drastic schedule, especially compared to something as OTC as alcohol.  I'm not discounting the spirit of his video, because it's a solid, useful piece of information, but a lawyer or someone else well versed in logic could see that there isn't much of an argument by comparing things.

Your friend is wasting his clonazepam and he really ought to just take it normally for multiple reasons:   It's a waste of Clonazepam. Clonazepam, like most benzos, has >90% bioavailability sublingual and oral, whereas when you smoke it, some portion of it gets burned, and some portion of it gets exhaled. You'll get higher if you put the Clonazepam under your tongue instead of in your vape. The fillers produce nasty combustion products which are likely quite bad for your lungs (carcinogens and tars and/or irritating smoke).  The smoke has to taste utterly vile.  Smoking pills in general marks you as someone who doesn't know much about drugs and might not be that bright (ie, an easy mark)."
Drugs,3dut74,lgnrogers,9,Sun Jul 19 18:09:17 2015 UTC,I took kratom for 2 years (6 grams toss and wash 4 times per day and yes that's a lot of kratom) it got me off of hydrocodone and isn't near as addictive as subs. With that being said though you need to be careful because it is still an addictive opiate. Take as little as you can every dose and try not to go over 2 times per day. I also suggest throwing some off days in there. It can work wonders but it can also just be an addition tradeoff.

Now, take this paste, and roll it up into medium-sized balls and swallow it.

Then calculate how much the different opioids equal to in an opioid youre familiar with and dose according to that.  For example say youre familiar with hydrocodone. Youd usually do 20mg doses. so you have 10mg oxycodone and 7.5mg hydrocodone. Oxycodone is about 1.5 times more potent so its equivalent to 15mg hydrocodone. 15+7.5=22.5.

I'm leaning toward DMT as this point because I like that it's a short but intense trip, I'm just worried that it might be too powerful of a chemical for someone as inexperienced as me. I'm thinking either DMT, real shrooms (since AcOMET is just shrooms without the mindfuck), or a double/triple dose of AL-LAD to give me the intensity of an acid trip with the shortened duration. Any thoughts?"
Drugs,3dvebx,Keshick,0,Mon Jul 20 02:39:11 2015 UTC,"You started with rather strange drugs so this isn't as straightforward as  had hoped but I still have some advice.  I'd usually say start with shrooms but seeing as you've taken al-lad I'm reluctant to recommend that. I say do either, but make sure you know your acid is real (tasteless) or at least know the chem you're dropping. Shrooms is a really smooth psych to start with so you'll manage just fine.  DMT I say you get (and save seeing as it doesn't stay around long when it gets around) and do it after shrooms at the very least, preferably after acid as well.   Nothing will prepared you for a breakthrough, so you either use it in light doses for fun or just go for it. There's not much of a middle ground.   I suggest mescaline, sassafras (mda), mdma, 2cb, and even ketamine before dmt though tbh. Salvia is also a great middle drugs between psychs and dmt Gives you a broad spectrum of psychedelic knowledge before dmt."

Xanax is an intermediate acting benzo with its effects taking place within 30 mins and lasting for 3 hours ime. Xanax is used for panic and anxiety attacks. Xanax is also the strongest in terms of sedative properties. Etizolam is very similar to Xanax with less powerful sedation. Klonopin takes effect in an hour or so and last 6-8 hours for people with general anxiety. It is not very sedating in my experience, but there still is a calming effect.

Also would you happen to know anything about the timings? Acid first wait an hour then the shrooms and wait like 2-4 hours for MDMA?"
Drugs,3dtl8g,relbatnrut,2,Sun Jul 19 18:39:13 2015 UTC,250mg MDMA is huge and the drugs will potentiate each other. Go for 100mg instead.

We can legalize drugs if we educate on a personal level and tell the truth to the young about the horrors of getting hooked on drugs like Meth and Heroin and the life long scars it leaves so that the youth will not want to go that route. At the same time if we help the ones that are hooked get clean through free/inexpensive methadone clinics and rehab facilities.

If I had a child and they were around age 14 I would be like ""hey let's go grab lunch at your favorite restaurant "" then when we got in the car I would tell them we had to make a quick stop and I would take them by to a NA meeting or a methadone clinic. After I showed them that I would sit down at lunch and tell them that as they get older they will be exposed to many drugs and some drugs like weed will never ruin their lives others will. Taking a couple pain killers like Vicodin here and there can be fun and will make you feel great can end you down a hard road. I will tell them that they will encounter people that can smoke casually in social situations and they will also encounter people that can do the harder drugs every once in a while and not get hooked on them but that was not the case for their father and a lot of other family members they share traits with. If I had children of my own when they hit their early teens I would let them know of the alcoholism and heavy drug addiction that runs in the family every few generations or so and that they may be prone to getting hooked on certain drugs. I will also tell them the truth to any question that they have especially when it comes to drugs. I will tell them what the drugs actually make you feel like and why people like using them(unlike when we were lied to at that age) I will tell them some drugs like marijuana are relatively harmless there are other drugs out there that are not and will very much so harm them.  I bet a huge number of junkies would not be in the situations that they are in now if someone took the time out to tell them and educate them on drugs when they were younger. I also bet you that if our government actually helped severe drug addicts instead of just throwing them in prison that it would greatly decrease the number of junkies we have today. Just think about it for a moment a heroin or meth addict gets arrested gets charged with a felony and gets thrown in jail...what does that accomplish??  They get thrown into jail to go through intense physical and mental withdrawals alone and in a very cold very dark very unforgiving jail with no help whatsoever only to get spit right back out on the street with no help and on top of all of that a felony charge or two. Most guys that I know go to jail dry out and the first thing they do when they get out is shoot up. But let's think of it and say a drug addict gets thrown in jail for a few months gets over the withdrawal and decides now that they are out they are going to start their life over and get a job and start a family or make amends with the family they have only to realize that it is incredibly hard to get a job with a felony or two that pays anything at all and if they are lucky enough to find a job it's gonna be tough to get good pay or your bosses respect with a felony record.

With these around drugs will forever be a controversial and divided issue. It's like alcohol just because its legal doesn't mean people change opinions and suddenly think its great. I agree that in the future with much more research in place hopefully opinion will be swayed on certain drugs that are less harmful but there will always be poor individuals who will fall into addiction and also die from od etc. and with this around it always stay a controversial issue. This is just my opinion though."
Drugs,3dq1nt,mihahahai,5,Sat Jul 18 20:07:14 2015 UTC,"I agree, in a way. I believe if we ever reach a point where most/all drugs become legal there would be a certain level of purity and quality which would lead to two things:   safer drugs  stronger drugs   These two things are not inherently good nor bad, but thinking about it we would need controlled safe places to take some of them. It would be hazardous if some inconsiderate person would work/drive/whatever under the influence of one or more substances. Danger would range depending on the drug, but still. I can't see general legalization without some strict rules around it. At least a psych test or something.  Of course, these  things really boil down to common sense and the individual. I, personally can't trust most people for anything as it is.  I'm no expert, but this is my impression of this hypothetical situation."
Drugs,3dq1nt,Aegist,10,Sat Jul 18 17:51:39 2015 UTC,"Drug addiction is a problem that will probably never disappear from the world completely.  Unlike what you might think, legalization is actually the best weapon against addiction. Portugal decriminalized drugs 14 years ago, and since then, the number of drug addicts went down by 50%!  There are also less deaths from drug ODs in Portugal since the decriminalization. It almost seems paradoxical, but it's a fact - when you legalize drugs, drug use sinks significantly. Even though legalization is a better step to take, a decriminalization of all drugs is a great start.  Also, legalization would allow the authorities to promote harm reduction information and help keep users safe. Drug use when drugs are illegal is dangerous - you can never be sure what you're taking. But legalized drugs would reduce harm by allowing users to choose just the right amount of the drug they want to take and therefore prevent accidents.  Portugal now connects drug users with communities to help them get rid of their habits, and it works. Users are sent to support groups, socialize and make human connections and that makes it easier for them to get rid of their addiction.  I highly recommend EVERYONE here to read the article I linked to, it's very informative."
Drugs,3dq1nt,Seicair,2,Sat Jul 18 18:43:37 2015 UTC,"I think you're both missing the key fact here, that most addiction is about the individual much much much more than it is about the drug.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY9DcIMGxMs  Tobacco is easily the most addictive of them all (pharmacologically speaking) and it is already legal.   The act of legalising and educating the public about these more serious drugs (Heroin and Meth in particular) will help alleviate much of the addiction immediately, and if done correctly, the money made from taxing the sales of these drugs could be reinvested into welfare and psychological support groups and practitioners who will achieve much more in lowering addiction than any criminal law could ever hope to achieve."
Drugs,3dq1nt,phacid,2,Sat Jul 18 20:54:06 2015 UTC,"Right now, people see addicts.  They see people who've been doing drugs so long they cause problems, or they see people who got caught by the police.  They don't see discreet, nonaddicted people who like altering their consciousness in politically incorrect ways.  If drugs were fully legal, slowly that would change as people would talk about it more openly.  It would take a long time, maybe even a generation or two, but most drugs would be treated like alcohol is now.  I could even conceive of many drugs being more accepted than alcohol, because of the relative risks and effects.  Edit- long article about heroin, including occasional recreational use."

What's more is they'll hold up a single champion like the President who signs a piece of paper. And that will be it. No one will know about the extremes this country and world went through to lock up addicts and ruin lives over so very little.

Like /u/flamebrain63 said, I think that in the future, governments will talk about drug prohibition the same way we talk about Alcohol prohibition now. It'll look primitive and just wrong.

The people who perpetrated acts that made those names significant faced no negative repercussions. You and I know big players in the drug war but most don't. We take interest in this stuff. I probably couldn't tell you who started prohibition. Hoover? Just a guess.  That's the thing too. Many people don't or didn't see the parallels between drug prohibition and alcohol prohibition. if everyone learned that prohibition was a failure and saw drug prohibition come along why did they put their weight behind it for the last half century?  It's just too easy to craft a narrative that is easy on yourself when you're the one who fucked up. People will just eat it up.

Yes, it is a slow process, but I like to think of it as an exponential growth process. As time passes, the rate of the people who understand the War on Drugs is pointless grows and grows.

Drugs,3dq1nt,tyler896,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:52:48 2015 UTC,"And they will definitely note that the Presidents who ushered in the Drug Warz (Nixon, Reagan, GHW Bush) were all old enough to personally remember the end of Prohibition.  They would have known first hand that these types of laws are unenforceable, yet they pushed for their passage anyway. (& now they wonder why no one has any respect for the law any more)  I expect pot to be legal in most jurisdictions by 2020. The rest a decade or so after that.  The obvious compromise position is to legalize weed, & maintain the status quo on the rest.   When people see the nation NOT fall into chaos, realize how much new tax revenue is being produced & note that organized crime still have all these profitable businesses that are avoiding taxation; well, the rest should happen pretty quick."
Drugs,3dq1nt,drEofcactustree,2,Sat Jul 18 20:17:34 2015 UTC,"I think we need to advocate just how racist the War on Drugs really is. Michelle Alexander wrote The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration In the Age of Colorblindness and that's really the only thing I see persisting in history books. The WoDs needs to be presented as a policy of policing that was extremely, deeply, and systematically unjust. Not just because we all like drugs. It was always about holding down people the establishment did not agree with: blacks, other minorities, and counter-culture people.   I read about the 3/5th compromise and Jim Crow in my history books. I hope to read about the same thing with the WoDs, too.   Nixon, Regan, Bush...these guys need to have a black mark by their names for all time for what they've done to America. They dirtied the process of American Democracy by locking up and taking the rights away from a very specific class of people.   When you read about Prohibition, you read about the consequences of organized crime and whatnot. No history book cares at all about citizens' right to get drunk after. They don't write about how it was unjust to force morals onto people. You won't see a ticker-tape parade image of people celebrating in the streets. History books say this: Prohibition happened, then organized crime happened, then Prohibition was repealed.  Our organized crime/consequences of the drug war are thus:   Drug cartels and an explosion of violence and crime outsourced to other countries (include the hundreds of thousands of direct casualties) Racist enforcement of drug policing (include how we stripped the rights away from nonviolent drug offenders so their lives as citizens were ruined) Expansion of police militarization Expansion of surveillance state Explosion of prison population"

Drugs,3dq1nt,MadderLadder,2,Sat Jul 18 22:07:47 2015 UTC,"It is happening at a rapid rate here in the USA. It is no longer an option as not only is it bleeding us dry in terms of the cost, and the American public is coming around to the fact that warehousing otherwise innocent humans and the blow-back of turning them into animals that will just return to prison is unethical. The American public has made it very clear we will not stand by and allow scum to profit off of our fellow man's misery. Unfortunately, for many lawmakers, it is not taking place due to altruism, nor compassion or commonsense, but having run out of options.   It is interesting to see the process taking place as the case is being made to the public; both dems and repub politicians are now publicly stating mass incarceration as a result of the failed so-called ""War on drugs"" is a abject failure.  President Obama last week was the first president is US history to visit a Federal Prison and sit down men that sold a couple of baggies and are in for 10-20 years ruining lives. He has already provided clemency to 60+ non-violent son's, father's, brother's in order to give them a chance to restore families and we are hoping for more to come. Former President Clinton last week spoke to NAACP and apologized for his part in signing into law failed policies (3 strikes, allowing racist crack vs power cocaine sentencing discrepancies which has devastated our African-American communities) into law. House Republican Leader Boehner has said he welcomes further legislation that will put an end to this.  But what has forced the puritanical hypocrites on the right and left into reality is the fact that the cartels and terrorist are in on the game and for the later has become a major source of their funding. Most illicit cocaine and heroin that ends up in Europe routes through Africa where islamo-terrorist get a piece of the transit action.  It has become clear that decisions have been made at a high level (no pun intended;) that the war is over and we are starting to make the transition. I am guessing we will see legalization and regulation of most all recreational drugs in the USA in the next 5 years if that. I am guessing the biggest obstacles at this point is the illicit drug trade is such a major part of the US economy that it needs to be handled with kid gloves.   The only losers will be the prison industrial complex (scumbag privateers who would make money  off a scab if they could) teaming with one of the most powerful unions - Correction Workers Union. In addition,  the military arms purveyors who ""the war"" was initially designed for so they could sell ""drug"" producing countries helicopters, surveillance gear, ""training"", etc. to ""assist in the eradication"".  In reality,  it was really corporate welfare provided by Reagan to defense contractors after the end of the cold war to fill the vacuum for their goods and to provide military entree into foreign countries."

Drugs,3dq1nt,thirdegree,2,Sat Jul 18 15:50:27 2015 UTC,Why?
Drugs,3dq1nt,zouloum,2,Sat Jul 18 17:20:49 2015 UTC,"if I understand you correctly, this would seem to be a very puritanical view of things with a preconceived notion that ""all or most drugs and drugs use is bad"";  FACT: Most every living creature wants to reach ecstatic states and others trying to relieve trauma. When it comes to humans, some do it with Yoga, some by running, some by twirling, some by speaking in tongues, and yes many in fact most be imbibing substances. When a piece of fruit falls from a tree it ferments and creates alcohol. Birds and other critters drink the nectar and get high. Throughout the natural world there are cases of animals getting high.  FACT: People will get high on whatever is available. If there are bad drugs around they will do bad drugs. if there are good drugs available, they will do that. The #1 substance people around they world get high on are solvents - mostly glue. Simply because it is available and cheap. Offer them something else and they will take it. For those that are abusers, addicts, and in trouble, it will be handled as a mental health issue as it should.  FACT: When the public is offered good drugs, it will assist many that are self medicating now. There is great efficacy with MDMA and mushrooms in relief of PTSD and other emotional trauma. Those that continue to self-medicate will do so with regulated substances rather than faring on the streets.  This is surely needed as the psychiatric industry which is another abject failure who is still performing electro-shock therapy and frontal lobotomies as well as over prescribing big-pharma poison that they spend billions on to make sure they do NOT make you feel good when you take them i.e. that they do not get you ""high"".  FACT: Most every legitimate study including one of the most comprehensive to come out of the USA performed in the 70's by the Nixon administration recommended full legalization and that when this occurred, you would initially see a slight ramp up on usage, followed by status quote flattening out of usage. Current legalization of cannabis in some states are proving this to be true."

Drugs are more available than ever, cheaper than ever. Addiction as common as ever. A government more corrupt than ever.  But we also know more about drugs than ever.  We have better medications than ever. Despite the illegality of drugs, groups like this one exist to actually help people.  The experiment has failed, we can do no worse, & so much better."

Drugs,3dsk0l,KushAlien,5,Sun Jul 19 02:49:13 2015 UTC,Bang on the money there. I would chain vape like crazy when drunk or wired and not feel satisfied. Given up ciggies and e-cigs for a few weeks now though and I'm tempted by cigarettes more than e-cigs. As someone else stated - my lungs never felt better than when using e-cigs only.
Drugs,3dsk0l,unkleskev,4,Sun Jul 19 10:12:14 2015 UTC,Everyone that makes this claim never gives a reason other than the fact that they are convincing themselves they are not satisfied.
Drugs,3dsk0l,AutismHour,4,Sun Jul 19 13:37:18 2015 UTC,"Tobacco contains drugs besides nicotine. The MAOIs harmine and harmaline contribute to nicotine's reinforcing properties by increasing the lifetime of dopamine in the synaptic cleft.

Drugs,3dsk0l,LordDongler,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:22:56 2015 UTC,"Most e-juices are made with USP-grade nicotine, which doesn't contain significant quantities of beta-carbolines. There are a few made with ""whole tobacco"" alkaloids, but they also contain the nitrosamines which increase their cancer risk. Sourcing (or extracting) these alkaloids from, say, Peganum harmala, isn't difficult, but not worth the effort for me because of the negatives:  MAOIs are addictive on their own, and also increase the addictiveness of nicotine. I'm not really trying to quit, but I'm not interested in becoming more addicted either. And I'd guess that the mid to long-term effects of smoking cessation (depression, weight gain) are caused by MAOI cessation and not nicotine WD."
Drugs,3dsk0l,galmse,3,Mon Jul 20 21:30:25 2015 UTC,Its a lot of different things that contribute to why its not as satisfying we started off with ciggs not ecigs so we are addicted to the tobacco and the hit a cigg gives and an ecig while being good in there own class will never compare to a cigg.

Worth doing some research though as ecigs vary a lot with the amount of vapour they are able to produce, I had ones that weren't able to produce much and I didn't get all that much satisfaction from them. Ecigs also have the added benefit of tasting fucking great (if you choose good juices!) and allows you the opportunity to change flavours if you were to get bored of one! I have to say that I find them much more enjoyable than I ever have cigs. I haven't totally quit smoking though, I still smoke when I'm at work (I work behind a bar, usually got 2-3 shifts a week) and since I'm UK I smoke my joints with tobacco in them (this is the one I find really hard to stop if I'm honest, the weed high/smoking experience just isn't as enjoyable to me without tobacco :/)"

Drugs,3dsk0l,AutismHour,4,Sun Jul 19 15:08:28 2015 UTC,"I was a heavy smoker (20 to 30 per day) for many years.  I'd tried various quitting methods, but I always went back because I realised I simply enjoy smoking even once the physical withdrawals were over (and man were those bad).  I switched to an e-cigarette coming up on 2 years ago and haven't looked back.  There was an adjustment period of about a week where I felt like I really wanted ""real"" cigarettes, and I'm sure if I'd been drinking or taking any substances during that week, I would've grabbed a pack; but then the strangest thing happened.  I suddenly started really enjoying my e-cig.  Now, nearly 2 years later, I can't imagine lighting up a cigarette.  The ""dirtiness"" of smoke kind of grosses me out, but the clean and fresh flavours of my e-cig vapour are like heaven.  As others have said though, you need a good e-cig, not some cheap disposable or even a cheap refillable.  I use Kangertech tanks/vaporisers, and only good quality battery systems.  My ""on the go"" is a smaller non-adjustable battery with the Kangertech T3'D, and my ""at home"" system is a large GS-Power 35W Gravity Mod system with the Kangertech Mega on top.  I mix my own liquids, both because it's far cheaper but also because I like experimenting with flavours."

Cigarettes gives a lot more nicotine in a shorter time, and they ""feel"" better to smoke in my honest opinion, especially when drunk.  Also like /u/bookerdewittt said, don't buy gas stations electronic cigarettes. If you want to vape then get a nice vape-mod."

Drugs,3dsk0l,RefrainsFromPartakin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:09:37 2015 UTC,I believe this is because of the PG. I used to vape 6mg mostly PG juice and hated the throat hit and got hardly any buzz. I've now gone up to 18mg but 75/35 VG/PG mix and there is hardly any throat hit. I don't think the nicotine content has much to do with throat hit.

Vaping definitely sates the urge, but it doesn't exactly fill the metaphorical hole in quite the same way. I liken this to how after a smoke, you want another thirty minutes later.  I still have cigarettes sometimes. Drinking,  cocaine, tripping...something about the actual feeling of smoke down your throat does something for me.   I guess I have a hard time making a quantifiable comparison. Sometimes I wish I had a cigarette. But I don't want to return to being a smoker.

Drugs,3dsk0l,RefrainsFromPartakin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:53:38 2015 UTC,"Cigarettes (well, tobacco in general) contain mild maois that influences the satisfaction that you get out of them on a neurochemical level. I've never had a smoking habit but even then I find myself wanting a cigarillo over my ecig at times. With that said, the maois also drastically increases the addictive qualities of nicotine. If you're not yet a habitual smoker IMO its much better to stick with ecigs, not just because it is less physically taxing but also because it doesn't screw with your reward system nearly as bad as the real thing.  Just as an added fun fact on top of this already only tangentially related post, but coffee also contains some maois that does the same thing."

But if you were to invest ~$150 in a nice box mod set up like the sigeli-150 with something like a mutation v4 atomizer and then grab some PG-dominant, high-nicotine vape juice for that harsh throat hit cigarette smokers know and love, you will have a much better time."
Drugs,3dsk0l,BrassPounder,6,Sun Jul 19 04:03:33 2015 UTC,"Lol what, why recommend a sig 150 and MXV4 to a person who has no experience with vapes? Learning how to build,  ohms law, and battery safety is not something most beginners want to do. And why would you recommend using high PG, high nic juice on a setup like that? Thats going to be painful as fuck if they cloud chase (which is what the sig 150 and the MXv4 are for). Use high VG, very low nic if you're gonna drip. The amount of vapor and hear you get from a cloud-chasing rig like that will make for plenty of throat hit and flavor.   I'd recommend something like the Coolfire 4, or the Kanger subbox kit, with 3 nic juice if you're a non smoker who wants to vape"

It was meant to be taken in hyperbole showing the two opposite sides of the spectrum at their respective worst/best.   I didn't expect a person new to vaping to know what a sigeli 150 was, or even a mutation for that matter. If they did happen to know these things, then they would most likely not need entry level advice.   Furthermore, the only piece of actual advice I gave out, which was the first thing said in my post, was to head over to the section of reddit dedicated to vaping.  The inclusion of a high-nic, PG dominant juice was to counter the notion that no matter what any vape hit will be ""weaker"" or sub par compared to a regular cigarette. It is possible to make your vape hit just as harsh as a cigarette, it's also possible for your vape to hit even harsher than cigarettes if you really wanted it to. I used a hypothetical situation to make it clear that you get what you pay for."

Even with high end equipment and juice, all I end up thinking is ""this sucks, why am I not smoking and actually getting enjoyment"". Seeing people with e-cigs is a mystery to me. I honestly wonder if they have ever smoked and how they can tolerate such an awful substitute.   E-cigarettes just fall into a weird middle ground for me. I don't think they are worth it. I'd rather smoke and assume the risk or just abstain as tough as it is at times. If one had a serious tobacco habit and actually savored the stuff, I don't think they would find them comparable."

First time I blacked out on Xanax I popped 2.5 bars and chugged a beer. That was on Monday, I awaken in my room (which is pretty much torn to pieces) on Wednesday wondering what the fuck happened. My friends tell me I went to work on Monday acting like a full on retard and just giggling in my own little world making pizzas. Then I woke up on Tuesday, took another 2.5 bars and went to my buddy's house and gave him 2.5 bars too, he immediately passed the fuck out and I smoked 2 grams of weed, went through 48 whippits, and found some Vicodin and ate that as well. Went home to get dressed for work, went back to my buddies place because I was HIS ride to work and he was still dead asleep. I wake up my homie, make him call in to work, and clean up all of the shit in his living room and go to work. Then I apparently went home and tried to make a fort out of my computer desk, decided it wasn't worth it after moving every fucking thing in my room, then passed out. From what I hear though I'm the most polite and friendly ""blacked out on Xanax"" guy"

Drugs,3drlqh,Widebodyslim,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:40:07 2015 UTC,"Man I learned my lesson but I was so lucky.  I never got in trouble and they pinned it down on a 'bad' batch of weed and the cops wanted to blame it on amphetamine overdose.  I even told the hospital what I took and said it was like Jimson weed (datura) and they had no idea what it was and no drugs besides weed and benzos showed up so they let me go thinking I was just sleepwalking.    Honestly I'm surprised I even got a second chance because, apparently, I said I used like 9-10 different drugs and that's the reason why they checked.  I never even got charged and my school assumed it was sleepwalking.  Not going to push my luck or make that mistake again."

Light-moderate use (if you're lucky) - You'll notice some tissue death and ""craters"" forming. Can heal itself over time if you stop insufflating EVERYTHING. If you pick at a scab over and over it will not heal.  Moderate use (unlucky) - Tissue death and craters are permanent. Probably won't heal up well but the puss might stop eventually.  Moderate-Heavy use (worst case scenario) - Deviated septum, ""BLOW HOLE"" as mc ride puts it. Shit doesn't grow back. If anyone ever happens to see inside your nose they will know."

Drugs,3dtyv2,cannagod,7,Sun Jul 19 13:10:25 2015 UTC,"Weed + amphetamine can be a very euphoric combination, and towards the latter end of an amphetamine dose weed is great for relaxing.  You can take the IR at any point after taking the XR, but the sooner you take it the more likely you are to experience negative side effects (unless taken concurrently, which will probably make you somewhat high). Its totally fine to stop taking them over the summer. Plus if you've got a stockpile towards the end you can sell them for great $$ :) Snorting pills is shitty but if you must then grind up the little balls in the XR and snort the resulting powder. Just avoid snorting IR pills entirely.    However, snorting your prescription is likely to give you a bit of a rush. Unless youre fully aware of the risks of recreational amphetamine abuse then you may want to stick to your prescribed oral ingestion. For ADHD it works much better when taken as prescribed."
Drugs,3dtyv2,look_inside,2,Sun Jul 19 13:27:09 2015 UTC,"Very insightful. I appreciate the detailed response quite a bit. Can you elaborate more on why snorting the IR is bad? I would never snort the XR, however, last night when I tried snorting the IR after vaping copious amounts of weed, probably 2-3 grams, I felt an immediate rush that sobered me up and made me feel much more relaxed while still high if that makes any sense. I also only snorted half of one pill, and my friend snorted the other. So I'm not sure how a full 10 mg would affect me."
Drugs,3dtyv2,look_inside,2,Sun Jul 19 13:42:26 2015 UTC,"Im not exactly sure about the composition of your specific prescription, but most IR formulations are 95% binders and fillers and only 5% active ingredients. So basically you're gumming up your sinuses so much that it defeats the whole purpose of snorting; fasting absorption and faster onset.   With the XR formula, the little beads have much less crap in them and relatively much more of the good stuff."
Drugs,3dtyv2,stickieickie,2,Sun Jul 19 13:51:46 2015 UTC,Snorting any pills is bad. Id recommend to strictly stick to oral use. Or it WILL become a problem if you use it regularly.
Drugs,3dtyv2,AutismHour,2,Sun Jul 19 17:30:36 2015 UTC,"Okay so ....  If you smoke weed on amphetamines it will be too much fun and it will become a drug party, not an aid to recover from an allegedly life-crippling mental disorder. Because if you think about it, you have a mental disorder that prevents you from accomplishing your goals in life and are taking amphetamines to combat it. Or at least that's what your mommy and your professional doctor told you, right? All fun and games because your doctor said it's cool, but if you have the kind of symptoms associated with ADHD and quitting weed wasn't your first solution for you, your mom, and your doctor, then you don't have ADHD or anything near it. Or at least it isn't affecting your life that badly.  A true medical use of amphetamines to treat ADHD is a 4-8 week period where, combined with lots of behavioral therapy and coaching, one learns the proper studying/living/planning strategies one needs to succeed in life, and then they taper off the medication. Unless your doctor is coming up with an actual plan combined with therapy, they never, ever thought ADHD was a real disease and never, ever thought giving you amphetamines would help you long-term in the first place.  TLDR: ""I'm taking amphetamines to cure this totally real life-crippling mental disorder, it's not because it feels good and the doctor said it was okay"" - said no one ever."
Drugs,3dtyv2,AutismHour,2,Sun Jul 19 13:53:52 2015 UTC,"When I said I was diagnosed with ADHD I should have clarified that it was a very loose diagnosis. All throughout high school I was in the top 5% and scored a 35 on my ACT, so I don't think that I actually have ADHD, I just think I'm a naturally fidgety person, hence why I was prescribed the medicine.  And to clarify, I'm not trying to brag or sound like a dick, I'm just trying to provide a bit more insight to my situation in order to clarify."
Drugs,3dtyv2,stickieickie,2,Sun Jul 19 14:40:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my point is ADHD isn't a thing any more than any other set of character traits for any person is a ""thing""."
Drugs,3dtyv2,AutismHour,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:04:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Weed is a big problem if you have AD(H)D. Unless youre using it in small amounts in the evenings/night to get to sleep on time. Other than that, weed has always been counterproductive as fuck for me.   Though what comes to the your argument on the treatment, CBT+short term medication wont always help manage ADHD on the long term. Alot of people require long term medication.   ADHD isn't a thing any more than any other set of character traits for any person is a ""thing"".   AD(H)D is a disorder of the dopaminergic system. Its an actual life-crippling disorder in some cases. I cant follow any long term goals if im not using stimulants, i cant concentrate for shit, i forget shit constantly, i procrastinate, im late from every appointment or thing i have to go to including work, i get frustrated and have anger problems.  Trying to teach myself ways to cope only helps with some of those symptoms to a degree, stims on other hand just magic cure it."
Drugs,3dtyv2,stickieickie,0,Sun Jul 19 17:28:25 2015 UTC,"I have it too. Every organism that has ever existed has had to cope with genetic variation, some more than others. With the ""daily stimulants just seem to work"" logic, we could have most of the ""conditions"" in the DSM ""cured"" with stimulants and downers alone.  I've seen the 30 and 40 year olds that started this shit 20+ years ago. There is no long term stimulant, benzos, or opiate use. Tolerance will always be there. And for the couple people that claim they have been on the same dose of X for 20+ years and haven't needed to take more? I hate to break it to them, but if the same 20mg dose of adderall is ""doing the same work"" it did 20 years ago, then it's placebo and wasn't necessary in the first place. Because if it was needed ... then you'd need to slowly increase to have the same effects. It pretty much amounts to a catch-22."

Except its proven that AD(H)D is a dopaminergic disorder. There is solid proof on why and how stimulants help manage it.  Sure, the tolerance happens. You need to take breaks, when talking about long term medication the breaks can be even months long. Also ive noticed that the dose needed to have therapeutic benefit from amphetamine doesnt increase anywhere near as much as the dose to get a recreational buzz off it.  Also im not sure about the genes, i nearly died of hypoxia on birth."
Drugs,3dtyv2,stickieickie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:32:25 2015 UTC,"Yes it's okay that you don't take the medication regularly. One thing that is overlooked by many users and parents alike is that many of these drugs that are being prescribed for mental conditions such as ADHD/Bipolar disorder/depression are widely misdiagnosed. There is no certain test that a psychiatrist can look at and say ""Okay we're 100% positive you have this.""  It is okay but keep in mind that every drug has it's drawbacks. While you still feel like you're getting work done keep in mind that weed negatively affects your ability to retain information. So although you can ""sober up"" with your amp, there's a chance you will not retain everything. Don't know  Don't base it upon when you begin to lose concentration. if you start doing this every time you lose concentration your automatic reaction will be ""alright I just need some amp."" and that's how dependency starts."

It's sad that they don't realize the reason why newer, cheaper, and more dangerous substances continue to flood the black market is due to the vilification of the more well known and proven to be safer chemicals these knockoffs imitate. These idiots are labeling MDMA analogs as synthetic canabanoids, which are nothing alike. Fucking morons reporting bullshit without doing the most basic research.

Drugs,3dtwhb,moardownboats,-2,Sun Jul 19 12:52:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah I am usually very good about doing my research. I know it is advised against doing opiates and MDMA in conjunction with one another, but only in considerable doses of both. I figured .1 g of molly would be inconsequential, same logic for the combo of molly and the coke. I also had a lot of trouble finding much of anything on tizanidine, so I figured it couldn't be too bad but of course had the moment of panic that maybe, the combo of everything together would kill me. I also enjoy speedballing on occasion with my coke and oxys. Thank you for your response though!"

Drugs,3dt8ub,TheNarcissist0,8,Sun Jul 19 05:59:21 2015 UTC,"Seriously being a self diagnosed narcissist is an oxymoron within itself. The chances you have clinical narcissism are probably abysmally small.  This post makes me think you're just sketched coming down. Even if you were a narcissist, I wouldn't worry about this because why bother? You're in it for yourself anyway so what do you care if stimulants increase your narcissism? Why would you follow advice from dipshits like us anyway?"
Drugs,3dt8ub,disposable125,4,Sun Jul 19 06:49:02 2015 UTC,There are levels to narcissism. He isn't necessarily at the point where he can't see any faults in himself and if he sees narcissism as a fault it makes sense he wouldn't want it to worsen too much.

Which is fine, I think everyone's got a bit of that in them.   Go see a psychotherapist if you're curious about getting to the bottom of this would be my advice   Also, might narcissists be particularly susceptible to the addictive properties of stimulants?   Sure, would be the answer to that question. susceptible to the addictive properties of any drug really, since your garden variety narcissist considers themselves beautiful, untouchable and entirely incapable of being at fault  To repeat, I think the self-awareness you display in this post probably rules out the possibility of your being a pathological narcissist"
Drugs,3dt8ub,Dharma_bum7,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:00:45 2015 UTC,"your garden variety narcissist considers themselves beautiful, untouchable and entirely incapable of being at fault   Oh yes. I can see how this might make narcissists more susceptible to addiction. That is very insightful.   I think the self-awareness you display in this post probably rules out the possibility of your being a pathological narcissist   Yes, I'm sure you're right. This is also the reason I have yet to seek the opinion or evaluation of a professional. If anything, I'm a functional narcissist. Like I said, it doesn't bother me. I don't see it as a weakness necessarily.  That being said, I still think my concerns are valid. If recreational stimulant use does indeed aggravate the symptoms of narcissism, it might ‚Äî given time ‚Äî transform me into a deluded, pathological narcissist.

That is to say, yes, prolonged and heavy stimulant use will indeed turn you into what could be kindly described as 'extremely eccentric' but that has little to do with your identification as a narcissist. that's more or less how she goes, friend- I've actually been down this road so I could explain in more detail if you like but your basic passage down the road to hell aboard the good ship USS Tweak looks something like this:  -The honeymoon phase: increased sociability, focus etc. you know this  -The pronoaic phase: this is when you start to seclude yourself, focus on your various tweaks. This stage, though the cracks will be beginning to show, is extremely beautiful. You will discover hidden connections, esoteric knowledge, possibly messages directed straight at you in almost everything you look at. You may feel like you are uncovering the hidden truth of the universe. You'll probably feel that god or fate or whatever your diseased fancy calls  it is working in your favour. This is more or less the beginning of the end, when the delusions really begin to get into full swing  -The paranoiac phase: full on tweakerishness and extended bouts of psychosis. This is where it gets b-b-bad- again you're probably aware of this  I've kept it vague since everyone's different so the exact details from tweaker to tweaker will vary but that's the general pattern. I hope it helps you to get an idea of how pretty much anybody, not just a narcissist (pathological or otherwise) can go from the honeymoon phase to slowly circling the drain  sorry for the length"

Drugs,3dtg1g,abaddamn,2,Sun Jul 19 07:50:56 2015 UTC,"This may not be what your seeking but find a hobby or passion. It seems like your relying on drugs to enhance your reality. Which theres nothing wrong with but now you seem to think sober reality is boring therefore relying on something else for your own happiness.  Start bettering yourself. Physically and mentally. Go workout, eat healthier, go meditate, dabble in flow arts, read enlightening books about the universe that exists outside and within yourself. The more you work on yourself and the more you learn about the world that permeates thru your perception of reality, the more awe-inspiring sober reality becomes because you discover a deep connection with the world around you. This is just coming from my personal experience because i used to constantly take mdma and that fucked me up and turned me into a zombie for a year. I started getting into psychedelics and started using it as a tool to expand my consciousness and to face my problems. And honestly now, i feel zero desire to roll. Ive only taken mdma once this entire year (festivals lol). Everyday reality for me now is a constant trip because i find everything is so amazing and inspirational. I also find it helps alot by surrounding yourself with people that are also bettering themselves as well. Cuz i used to have friends that just wanna fucking party and roll all the time and it gets old. As much as love as you have for those people, you might want to start cutting it off. I dont really know your situation though so take my advice with a grain of salt."
Drugs,3dtg1g,indigonights,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:18:26 2015 UTC,You're totally right :D Thanks for telling me what you went through. It really means a lot to hear that and yes it wasnt easy to cut off those connections but I knew it had to be done otherwise I could have gone off the deep end. Hobbies oh yes definitely getting that groove back but I have to train myself to not get distracted and start internet reading on certain websites.  As for life being beautiful it's slowly getting there - and never seems to be an easy trip of just recovering your brain back to normal as something else can and will drag you down out of nowhere.   Interesting your experience was based on MDMA. I tried it once with a mate and I have to say it wasnt fun at all. I felt the head defrag effect when I peaked but after that it felt like I just was not comfortable in this headspace at all.  And to top it off horrible comedown immediately afterwards. Never again but then I've tried prozac to deal with this and the depression and that also felt very similar to MDMA but with weird body side effects and also feels like certain antibiotics.   So yes my medicine of choice is coca tea which has no side effects and pretty much does the job while allowing me to sleep when I want to. That and omega 3 tablets once a day.
