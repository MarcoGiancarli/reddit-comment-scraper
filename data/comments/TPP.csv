TPP,3contl,RAndrewOhge,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:18:22 2015 UTC,"The Trans-Pacific Partnership — Is It Bad for Your Health? From The New England Journal of Medicine - NEJM.Org  By Amy Kapczynski, J.D.  June 10, 2015 - DOI: 10.1056/NEJM-p1506158  Article  International trade deals once focused primarily on tariffs.   As a result, they had little direct effect on health, and health experts could reasonably leave their details to trade professionals.   Not so today.   Modern trade pacts have implications for a wide range of health policy issues, from medicine prices to tobacco regulation, not only in the developing world but also in the United States.  The Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) is a case in point.   A massive trade deal now reportedly on the verge of completion, the TPP has nearly 30 chapters.   A draft chapter on intellectual property (IP) alone runs 77 single-spaced pages.  The full health implications of the TPP are hard to judge, not only because its provisions are complex but also because the draft text is a closely held secret.   Even members of the U.S. Congress can see it only if they agree not to talk publicly about it and if they leave their pens and phones (and, until recently, their expert staffers) at the door.   But several key chapters have recently been leaked and reveal that the TPP could have a substantial impact on health.  Groups including Médecins sans Frontières and Oxfam warn, for example, that the agreement could threaten the lives of millions of people in developing countries.   Their concerns stem primarily from the leaked IP chapter and the effect that patents have on the prices of medicines.   In the context of human immunodeficiency virus, for example, patents increase the annual cost of antiretroviral therapy from around $100 per person to $10,000 per person.  The TPP could impose obligations on developing countries that go far beyond any existing trade agreement. Indeed, some proposals in the leaked IP chapter seem directly targeted against innovative measures that developing countries have used to maximize the use of low-cost generic medicines.  For example, India allows patents on new drugs but not on new uses of old drugs or new forms of known drugs that do not increase therapeutic efficacy.   These provisions have paved the way for generic versions of lifesaving drugs such as the cancer treatment imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) in that country.1   But such limits on patent eligibility could be outlawed by the TPP.   Reports suggest that there may be some kind of phase-in period for developing-country members, but only for some parts of the agreement.   And at best, a phase-in period would merely postpone some of the TPP's effects for a few years.2  India is not a party to the TPP negotiations, which have been conducted by 12 Pacific Rim countries: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States, and Vietnam.   Why, then, would India's laws — sometimes word for word — be targeted in the TPP negotiations?   For one thing, other developing countries have started to follow India's lead.   For another, the TPP is a platform agreement designed for other countries to join, and it will establish a new baseline for future international negotiations.   The risk regarding access to medicines in developing countries is real.  Though it is less widely recognized, the TPP could also have a direct effect on health in developed countries.   For example, the leaked IP chapter contemplates major extensions of “data exclusivity” provisions.   These laws prevent drug regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration from registering a generic version of a drug for a certain number of years — and as a result can substantially affect the prices of medicines.  In recognition of this fact, President Barack Obama's fiscal year 2016 budget proposes rolling back the data-exclusivity period for biologic drugs in the United States to 7 years from 12 years, yielding a projected savings of more than $4 billion over the next decade.3   In the TPP negotiations, however, the United States is proposing a 12-year term of exclusivity.   Such a requirement would lock the United States into a policy that many observers, including, apparently, the President himself, believe inflates the cost of medicines unjustifiably.   Even if the number of years required by the TPP is negotiated downward, the lock-in effect remains a concern, because trade agreements can be extremely difficult to amend.  The cost of medicines is no small concern in the United States today: spending on prescription drugs in the United States jumped 13% in 2014 alone.   The recent experience with new hepatitis C treatments shows that even lifesaving cures may be rationed in the United States — whether implicitly or explicitly — if we fail to contain drug costs and promote more efficient innovation.   The TPP, however, could make moves toward more rational drug pricing in the United States difficult and even imperil existing provisions that help to contain costs for government programs.  A 2011 “annex” to the TPP, apparently proposed by the United States, would have mandated that all countries use “competitive market-derived prices” or benchmarks that “appropriately recognize the value” of the drug in question when establishing drug prices.   A just-leaked December 2014 draft omits these provisions but still contemplates substantial procedural obligations for governments and makes clear that these rules apply to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).   The text is difficult to decipher and still in flux.   But consumer groups argue that the annex could create opportunities for interference in the decisions of CMS and render health programs in all TPP countries more vulnerable to drug-company influence and more difficult to reform.4  In March 2015, a third bombshell dropped: a draft chapter on “investor-state dispute settlement” (ISDS).   It would empower foreign companies to sue member countries for hundreds of millions of dollars in damages in a wide range of cases in which they argue that their expected future profits have been undermined.   These challenges would be heard by “arbiters” — typically private lawyers, many of whom cycle in and out of industry — with no prospect of independent review by a national court.   Such provisions have been included in trade agreements before.   But the scale of the TPP would substantially increase the number of companies that could bring such challenges.   Firms have already used provisions like these to challenge an astonishing range of laws, from minimum-wage laws in Egypt, to tobacco regulations in Uruguay and Australia, to core aspects of patent law as they apply to medicines in Canada.   The ISDS provisions alone could interfere with domestic health policy for decades to come.   Under their auspices, policies covering a wide range of issues, from food and tobacco labeling, to patent law, to drug-pricing rules, to environmental protection could be challenged in participating countries — including, of course, the United States.  The course that the TPP takes is not yet set in stone.   Negotiations continue, and the Obama administration could work toward an agreement that excludes provisions such as ISDS and the health care “annex” or that incorporates robust safeguards to protect health.   Congress has an important role, too.   As of early June, it was in the midst of a fierce legislative battle over whether the TPP and deals like it should be “fast-tracked.”   If Congress takes this route, its ability to influence the treaty will be much diminished: fast tracking allows passage of a trade treaty with only a simple majority vote in Congress and also denies Congress any opportunity to make changes to the agreement's text.  Much hangs in the balance in the coming weeks and months.   If the TPP includes robust ISDS provisions and the expansive provisions proposed in the IP chapter and the health care annex, the United States could be signing away its authority to regulate critical aspects of health policy for years to come.

TPP,3c0gnh,RAndrewOhge,3,Fri Jul 3 17:19:48 2015 UTC,"Leaked: What’s In Obama’s TPP Trade Deal  So – watch out for the TPP, all you who want to protect American sovereign rights. Because once it is enacted, our entire legal system is up for grabs.  By Michael Grunwald, July 2nd, 2015  A recent draft of the Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade deal would give U.S. pharmaceutical firms unprecedented protections against competition from cheaper generic drugs, possibly transcending the patent protections in U.S. law.  POLITICO has obtained a draft copy of TPP’s intellectual property chapter as it stood on May 11, at the start of the latest negotiating round in Guam.  While U.S. trade officials would not confirm the authenticity of the document, they downplayed its importance, emphasizing that the terms of the deal are likely to change significantly as the talks enter their final stages.  Those terms are still secret, but the public will get to see them once the twelve TPP nations reach a final agreement and President Obama seeks congressional approval.  Still, the draft chapter will provide ammunition for critics who have warned that TPP’s protections for pharmaceutical companies could dump trillions of dollars of additional health care costs on patients, businesses and governments around the Pacific Rim.  The highly technical 90-page document, cluttered with objections from other TPP nations, shows that U.S. negotiators have fought aggressively and, at least until Guam, successfully on behalf of Big Pharma.  The draft text includes provisions that could make it extremely tough for generics to challenge brand-name pharmaceuticals abroad.  Those provisions could also help block copycats from selling cheaper versions of the expensive cutting-edge drugs known as “biologics” inside the U.S., restricting treatment for American patients while jacking up Medicare and Medicaid costs for American taxpayers.  “There’s very little distance between what Pharma wants and what the U.S. is demanding,” said Rohit Malpini, director of policy for Doctors Without Borders.  Throughout the TPP talks, the Obama administration has pledged to balance the goals of fostering innovation in the drug industry, which means allowing higher profits, and promoting wider access to valuable medicines, which means keeping prices down.  U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman has pointed out that pharmaceutical companies often have to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to get a new drug to market, which they would have little incentive to do without strong protections for the patented product.  But Froman has also recognized the value of allowing much cheaper generic drugs to enter the market after those brand-name patents expire.   In the U.S., generics now comprise more than five-sixths of all prescription drugs, but only about one-quarter of drug costs.  Advocates for the global poor, senior citizens, labor unions and consumers as well as the generics industry have accused the administration of abandoning that balance, pushing a pharmaceutical-company agenda at the expense of patients and taxpayers.  One critic, hoping to illustrate the point and rally opposition to TPP in Congress, gave POLITICO the draft chapter, which was labeled “This Document Contains TPP CONFIDENTIAL Information” on every page.  U.S. officials said the key point to remember about trade deals is that no provision is ever final until the entire deal is final—and that major compromises tend to happen at the very end of the negotiations.  They expect the real horse-trading to begin now that Obama has signed “fast-track” legislation requiring Congress to pass or reject TPP without amendments.  “The negotiations on intellectual property are complex and continually evolving,” said Trevor Kincaid, a spokesman for Froman.  “On pharmaceutical products, we are working closely with stakeholders, Congress, and partner countries to develop an approach that aims to make affordable life-saving medicine more widely available while creating incentives for the development of new treatments and cures. Striking this important balance is at the heart of our work.”  The draft chapter covers software, music and other intellectual property issues as well, but its most controversial language involves the rights of drug companies.  The text reveals disputes between the U.S. (often with support from Japan) and its TPP partners over a variety of issues—what patents can cover, when and how long they can be extended, how long pharmaceutical companies can keep their clinical data private, and much more.  On every issue, the U.S. sided with drug companies in favor of stricter intellectual property protections.  Some of the most contentious provisions involve “patent linkage,” which would prevent regulators in TPP nations from approving generic drugs whenever there are any unresolved patent issues.  The TPP draft would make this linkage mandatory, which could help drug companies fend off generics just by claiming an infringement.  The Obama administration often describes TPP as the most progressive free-trade deal in history, citing its compliance with the tough labor and environment protections enshrined in the so-called “May 10 Agreement” of 2007, which set a framework for several trade deals at the time.  But mandatory linkage seems to be a departure from the May 10 pharmaceutical provisions.  In an April 15 letter to Froman, Heather Bresch, the CEO of the generic drug company Mylan, warned that mandatory patent linkage would be “a recipe for indefinite evergreening of pharmaceutical monopolies,” leading to the automatic rejection of generic applications.  The U.S. already has mandatory linkage, but most other TPP countries do not, and Bresch argued that U.S. law includes a number of safeguards and incentives for generic companies that have not made it into TPP.  “With all due respect, the USTR has…cherry-picked the single provision designed to block generic entry to the market,” Bresch wrote.  Generics are thriving in the U.S. despite linkage, saving Americans an estimated $239 billion on drugs in 2013.  But the U.S. is the world’s largest market, and advocates fear that generic manufacturers may not take on the risk and expense of litigation in smaller markets if TPP tilts the playing field against them.  One generics manufacturer, Hospira, reportedly testified at a TPP forum in Melbourne, Australia, that it would not launch generics outside the U.S. in markets with linkage.  The opponents are also worried about the treaty’s effect on the U.S. market, because its draft language would extend mandatory patent linkage to biologics, the next big thing in the pharmaceutical world.  Biologics can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for patients with illnesses like rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis B and cancer, and the first knockoffs have not yet reached pharmacies.  The critics say that extending linkage to biologics—which can have hundreds of patents—would help insulate them from competition forever.  “It would be a dramatic departure from U.S. law, and it would put a real crimp in the ability of less expensive drugs to get to market,” said K.J. Hertz, a lobbyist for AARP.  “People are going to look at this very closely in Congress.”  Drug companies are already pushing for TPP to guarantee them 12 years of exclusivity for their data regarding biologics, although the draft text suggests the other TPP nations have not agreed.  Jay Taylor, vice president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said it’s crucial for TPP to protect the intellectual property that emerges from years of expensive research, so that drug companies can continue to develop new medicines for patients around the world.  “These innovations could be severely hindered if IP protections are scaled back,” Taylor said.  “This is especially important in the area of biologic medicines, which could hold the key to unlocking treatments for diseases that have thwarted researchers for years.”  U.S. officials would not discuss the status of the TPP talks.  But they suggested the May 10 Agreement did include a milder form of linkage, although it didn’t prevent regulators from approving generics mired in patent disputes.    They also believe a 2009 U.S. law included a form of linkage for biologics, although again, that law’s dispute resolution process for patent issues was not as prescriptive as the TPP draft.  And they cautioned that any pre-Guam draft would not reflect recent negotiations over “transition periods” that would delay the stricter patent standards in developing countries like Vietnam.  In any case, Kincaid said U.S. negotiators are determined to strike a balance between innovation and access in the final product.  “While this is our touchstone, the negotiations are still very much in process, and the details of a final outcome cannot yet be forecasted,” he said.  But Malpani of Doctors Without Borders said U.S. negotiators have basically functioned as drug lobbyists.  The TPP countries have 40 percent of global economic output, and the deal is widely seen as establishing new benchmarks for some of the most complex areas of global business. Malpani fears it could set a precedent that crushes the generic drug industry under a mountain of regulation and litigation.  “We consider this the worst-ever agreement in terms of access to medicine,” he said. “It would create higher drug prices around the world—and in the U.S., too.  https://www.popularresistance.org/leaked-whats-in-obamas-tpp-trade-deal/#"

Essentially, the idea is that this treaty will benefit the very wealthy and hurt the middle class and poor. You might have heard that Obama was given ""fast track"" authority over the TPP; what this basically means is that he now has the unilateral authority to approve* the treaty, despite the fact that the American public has almost no clue what it entails, while representatives from multinational corporations have been active participants of the negotiations. The comic suggests that the public has been kept ignorant of the treaty because they would oppose it, because it is going to ultimately result in the transfer of money from poor people to rich people.   EDIT: The bill that Congress passed actually requires that the full text of the TPP is made public for 60 days before Congress decides whether or not to ratify it.

TPP,3bdb0v,Menaus42,24,Tue Jun 30 21:11:26 2015 UTC,"From /r/Abstergo_Industries at /r/explainlikeiamfive  And here's another thread from the same subreddit (links to quote below)  https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3az0fa/eli5_what_does_the_tpp_transpacific_partnership/   The Trans Pacific Partnership is a trade agreement between the U.S. and numerous other nations around the pacific ocean. If passed, it would affect everything from tariff policy to environmental protection to intellectual property. Below are some pros and cons:  Pros: - Free trade is a good thing in the right situations. Any of you who've taken introductory level Macroeconomics will likely already know this, but trade between nations allow each country to specialize on producing what they have the comparative advantage in. - By removing barriers to trade such as tariffs and quotas, the TPP agreement would allow U.S. businesses to trade profitably in markets they are currently unable to do so in. For example, Japan has very high tariffs on pork products in order to protect their own pork industry. If TPP passes with Japan as a member, these tariffs would be done away with and U.S. companies could then compete in Japan on a level playing field. - TPP installs new intellectual property laws in an attempt to protect the original rights holders. This is obviously a hotly debated topic, and there are costs and benefits on both sides of the issue.  Cons: - TPP could possibly be very detrimental to the environment. Under the leaked TPP Environmental chapter, corporations could sue governments should they enact environmental legislation that would hurt their business. Essentially, TPP asserts to the world that business's profits are more important than the health of Earth. - This partnership would allow companies to sue countries. Let that sink in for a moment; instead of working in the best interest of their people, governments of member nations would be liable for damages and compensation if they passed legislation that hurt a foreign companies business. Environment, public health, zoning codes - all are potential vulnerabilities under TPP depending on the wording of the final draft. - Intellectual property law would once again be strengthened. While some protections are a good thing and help to ensure creators are properly rewarded for their time and effort, if taken too far such legislation can prove detrimental to creativity and innovation. While the supporters of the TPP believe the provisions contained within are a good thing, the opposition to the TPP believes in the other side of the coin.  I hope that's clear/informative - I'm currently an intern on the Hill and have been exposed to TPP as it's been progressing. If anyone has any other questions I'll be glad to answer when I get to work today."

If an investor from one country (the ""Home State"") invests in another country (the ""Host State""), both of which have agreed to ISDS, and the Host State violates the rights granted to the investor under public international law, then that investor may bring the matter before an arbitral tribunal.

No, no!’ said the Queen.Sentence first–verdict afterwards.’  Stuff and nonsense!’ said Alice loudly.The idea of having the sentence first!’  `Hold your tongue!’ said the Queen, turning purple.  `I won’t!’ said Alice.  `Off with her head!’ the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.  — Lewis Carroll, “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland”  Fast-track authority is being sought in the Senate this week for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), along with the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) and any other such trade agreements coming down the pike in the next six years.  The terms of the TPP and the TiSA are so secret that drafts of the negotiations are to remain classified for four years or five years, respectively, after the deals have been passed into law.  How can laws be enforced against people and governments who are not allowed to know what was negotiated?  The TPP, TiSA and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (or TTIP, which covers Europe) will collectively encompass three-fourths of the world’s GDP; and they ultimately seek to encompass nearly 90 percent of GDP.  Despite this enormous global impact, fast-track authority would allow the President to sign the deals before their terms have been made public, and send implementing legislation to Congress that cannot be amended or filibustered and is not subject to the constitutional requirement of a two-thirds treaty vote.  While the deals are being negotiated, lawmakers can see their terms only under the strictest secrecy, and they can be subjected to criminal prosecution for revealing those terms.  What we know of them comes only through WikiLeaks.  The agreements are being treated as if they were a matter of grave national security, yet they are not about troop movements or military strategy.  Something else is obviously going on.  The bizarre, unconstitutional, blatantly illegal nature of this enforced secrecy was highlighted in a May 15th article by Jon Rappoport, titled “What Law Says the Text of the TPP Must Remain Secret?” He wrote:  It seems like a case of mass hypnosis. . . .  Members of Congress are scuttling around like weasels, claiming they can’t disclose what’s in this far-reaching, 12-nation trade treaty.  They can go into a sealed room and read a draft, but they can’t copy pages, and they can’t tell the public what they just read.  Why not?  If there is a US law forbidding disclosure, name the law.  Can you recall anything in the Constitution that establishes secret treaties?  Is there a prior treaty that states the text of all treaties can be hidden from the people?  To Congressmen who say they cannot reveal what is in a treaty that will adversely affect the lives of hundreds of millions of people, Rappoport says:  Wrong.  You’re lying.  You can reveal secret text.  In fact, it’s your duty.  Otherwise, you’re guilty of cooperating in a RICO criminal conspiracy.  A Corporate Coup d’État  What is going on was predicted by David Korten in his 1995 blockbuster, When Corporations Rule The World. Catherine Austin Fitts calls it a “corporate coup d’état.”  This corporate coup includes the privatization and offshoring of the judicial functiondelegated to the US court system in the Constitution, through Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provisions that strengthen existing ISDS  procedures.  As explained in The Economist, ISDS gives foreign firms a special right to apply to a secretive tribunal of highly paid corporate lawyers for compensation whenever the government passes a law to do things that hurt corporate profits — such things as discouraging smoking, protecting the environment or preventing a nuclear catastrophe.  Arbitrators are paid $600-700 an hour, giving them little incentive to dismiss cases.  The secretive nature of the arbitration process and the lack of any requirement to consider precedent give wide scope for creative judgments – the sort of arbitrary edicts satirized by Lewis Carroll in Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.  To date, the highest ISDS award has been for $2.3 billion to Occidental Oil Company against the government of Ecuador over its termination of an oil-concession contract, although the termination was apparently legal.  Under the TPP, however, even larger and more unpredictable judgments can be anticipated, since the sort of “investment” it protects includes not just “the commitment of capital or other resources” but “the expectation of gain or profit.”  That means the rights of corporations extend not merely to their factories and other “capital” but to the profits they expect to receive. Just the threat of a massive damage award for impairing “expected corporate profits” could be enough to discourage prospective legislation by lawmakers.  The Trade in Services Agreement adds additional barriers to proposed legislation.    TiSA involves 51 countries, including every advanced economy except the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa).  The deal would liberalize global trade in services covering close to 80% of the US economy, including financial services, healthcare, education, engineering, telecommunications, and many more.  It would restrict how governments can manage their public laws, and it could dismantle and privatize state-owned enterprises, turning those services over to the private sector.  It would also block the emerging trend to return privatized services to the public sector, by limiting or prohibiting governments from creating or reestablishing public utilities and other “uncompetitive” forms of service delivery.  It seems that the TPP, TTIP and TiSA are not about the sort of “free trade” that would free local businesses to sell abroad.  They are about freeing international corporations from the government regulation necessary to protect the economy, the people, and the environment.  They are about preserving privatized monopolies and preventing competition from the public sector.  And they are about moving litigation offshore into private arbitrary tribunals – the sort of tribunal that might have lost Alice her head, if she had not awakened from her bizarre dream.  http://www.globalresearch.ca/sentence-first-verdict-afterwards-the-alice-in-wonderland-world-of-fast-tracked-secret-trade-agreements/5457359"

TPP,39iudb,RAndrewOhge,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:46:56 2015 UTC,"Friday Vote: Congress Rushing the TPP Through Even Though They Know Americans Will Lose Jobs  By Melissa Dykes - June 11, 2015  There’s nothing free about free trade.  The only reason Congress is holding out until Friday to vote on the TPP according to Politico is “They’re trying to resolve a last-minute hangup over aid for workers who lose their jobs to free trade”:  House leaders, confident but not yet certain they have the support to pass sweeping trade legislation, are aiming to bring the package to a floor vote by the end of this week — even as they rush to resolve a last-minute hangup over how to pay for aid to displaced workers.  The vote to grant President Barack Obama fast-track authority to negotiate a massive Pacific Rim trade deal will be extremely tight by all accounts.   Senior aides and lawmakers in GOP leadership are intent on scheduling the vote at the moment they believe they have the votes locked up — ideally by Friday, to spare supportive lawmakers the possibility of another weekend of attacks by trade foes back in their districts.  “We’re doing very well, we’re close,” Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who’s been at the forefront of the GOP effort to round up support, said Tuesday of the current vote count.   If Republicans want to bring the trade legislation to the floor Friday, they must decide Wednesday. [emphasis added]  This means Congress is WELL AWARE a lot of people are about to lose their jobs once the TPP that none of us have even gotten to read goes through.  They should be; secret negotiations for this thing have only been underway now for SIX YEARS.  NAFTA on steroids doesn’t even really begin to cover what we do know of the TPP.   It’s not like any previous trade agreement we’ve ever seen.   Where should we begin?   The fact that it’s going to make Obamacare look like a happy fun time stroll down a sunny lane, or the fact that it’s basically facilitating the U.S. merger with China? (Bye bye national sovereignty, hello TPP!)  For starters, here are ten reasons why you should oppose it straight out of the gate.  It’s not like the economy and job markets don’t already suck as it is these days.   Food service is one of the fastest growing job markets in this country.   Enough people have been mumbling under their breath about how robots are about to take a lot of the jobs that Google CEO Eric Schmidt specifically felt the need to respond to this “unfounded fear” at Davos earlier this year.  Now these crony idiots in Congress are about to completely sell us out so the middle class isn’t just dead, it’s dead and they’re gleefully kicking the carcass around.  Of course, if it were the Dems in charge, it wouldn’t be any different, either.  And they’re all in on it, even “Libertarian Lite” Filibuster-Things-That-Won’t-Change-Anything Rand who last year gave a speech talking about how Obama should prioritize the TPP by the year’s end.  This Friday just wasn’t near fast enough for Rand… but aw shucks, I guess it’ll have to do.   Even after writing about that video before by the way, people still couldn’t believe it and found ways to make excuses for it as if he either didn’t say what they just saw and heard him say or he must have a very good reason for doing so.  Yeah, he did have a good reason.   He’s a sold-out shill. It’s pretty simple.  The corporations running the government we all pretend we still have are attempting to enslave us all.   The people are no longer represented by anyone in our so-called government, unless you count corporations as people too my friend the way Mitt Romney does.

TPP,39da4c,RAndrewOhge,3,Thu Jun 11 00:09:26 2015 UTC,"Leaked Text Shows Big Pharma Bullies Using TPP To Undermine Global Health  Watchdog groups says 'leak is just the latest glaring example of why fast-tracking the TPP would undermine the health of Americans'.  By Deirdre Fulton, June 10, 2015  Newly leaked TPP text ""is clearly intended to cater to the interests of the pharmaceutical industry,"" writes Dr. Deborah Gleeson in her analysis. (Photo: ep_jhu/flickr/cc)  Bolstering long-held criticisms from public interest groups, newly leaked sections of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) show how Big Pharma is employing ""an aggressive new form of transnational corporatism"" to increase profits at the expense of global health.  The TPP's ""Healthcare Annex""—which seeks to regulate government policies around medicines and medical devices—would give big pharmaceutical companies more power over public access to medicine while crippling public healthcare programs around the world and ""tying the hands"" of the U.S. Congress in its ability to pursue Medicare reform and lower drug costs.   ""The Great Treaty is taking shape in complete secrecy, because along with its undebated geostrategic ambitions it locks into place an aggressive new form of transnational corporatism for which there is little public support.""  —Julian Assange, WikiLeaksIn a scathing analysis of the leaked text, which was published Wednesday by WikiLeaks, Australian public health expert Deborah Gleeson declares:  The purported aim of the Annex is to facilitate ‘high-quality healthcare’ but the Annex does nothing to achieve this.   It is clearly intended to cater to the interests of the pharmaceutical industry.   Nor does this do anything to promote “free trade”: rather it tightly specifies the operation of countries’ schemes for subsidizing pharmaceuticals and medical devices with the aim of providing greater disclosure, more avenues for pharmaceutical industry influence and greater opportunities for industry contestation of pharmaceutical decision making.  The inclusion of the Healthcare Transparency Annex in the TPP serves no useful public interest purpose.   It sets a terrible precedent for using regional trade deals to tamper with other countries’ health systems and could circumscribe the options available to developing countries seeking to introduce pharmaceutical coverage programs in future.  The TPP, currently being negotiated behind closed doors, would link the United States with Pacific Rim countries from Canada and Chile to Japan and Australia into a new regimen of so-called ""free trade"" rules that would cover 40 percent of the global economy.  ""The leak is just the latest glaring example of why fast-tracking the TPP would undermine the health of Americans and the other countries and cost our government more, all to the benefit of pharma’s profits.""  — Lori Wallach, Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch  President Barack Obama is trying to gain Fast Track approval from the U.S. House of Representatives as early as tomorrow, having already obtained it from the Senate, which would grant him increased power to push the TPP and other mammoth trade pacts through Congress.  Public health groups have long been part of the coalition of TPP opponents, charging that it would undermine efforts to ensure access to affordable, life-saving medicines in both the United States and abroad.  Wednesday's leak appears to bolster those claims.  According to the New York Times, which obtained the Healthcare Annex in collaboration with WikiLeaks, the document provides pharmaceutical companies with ""new opportunities to challenge the decisions of trading partners on which drugs they will offer their citizens through government health care programs and the rates at which they will reimburse drug sellers.""  The Times continues:  A version of the Trans-Pacific Partnership annex that leaked in 2011 made explicit reference to “competitive market-derived prices,” promising drug companies the chance to appeal rates deemed insufficient.   Those are gone, “a victory for the non-U.S. partners to some extent,” Ms. Gleeson, the Australian expert, said.  But Pacific accord negotiators do appear ready to grant pharmaceutical and medical device makers more power to influence participating governments.   The 12 countries involved, and any others that might join later, would have to disclose rules and guidelines for deciding which medical products would be made available through government programs and at what rate providers would be reimbursed.  Drug companies and medical device makers would have to be given “timely opportunities to provide comments at relevant points in the decision-making process.”   And governments would have to offer a review process “that may be invoked at the request of an applicant directly affected” by the decisions of national health care authorities.  Watchdogs say such provisions could give Big Pharma more influence over Medicare, particularly as regards pharmaceutical and medical device procurement and reimbursement.  In a fact sheet (pdf) distributed in response to the revelations, Public Citizen's Global Access to Medicines Program said the text raises critical questions such as:  Could companies use the Annex to compel Medicare to cover expensive products without a corresponding benefit to public health?   Medicare reimbursement is limited to products that are “reasonable and necessary” for treatment.   But the TPP ""recognize[s] the value"" of pharmaceutical products or medical devices through the ""operation of competitive markets"" or their ""objectively demonstrated therapeutic significance,"" regardless of whether there are effective, affordable alternatives.  Furthermore, noted Peter Maybarduk, director of the Global Access to Medicines Program:   ""This leak reveals that the Obama administration, acting at the behest of pharmaceutical companies, has subjected Medicare to a series of procedural rules, negotiated in secret, that would limit Congress’ ability to enact policy reforms that would reduce prescription drug costs for Americans—and might even open to challenge aspects of our health care system today.""  As the Times reports, pharmaceutical firms and their trade associations have filed by far more lobbying disclosure forms on TPP negotiations than any other industry, according to the watchdog Sunlight Foundation.  Of course, concern over the TPP's implications for healthcare policy wasn't limited to U.S. stakeholders.   The Sydney Morning Herald reported:  Trade and healthcare experts are deeply concerned that the TPP agreement has the potential to undermine Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and other similar health programs such as that administered by New Zealand's Pharmaceutical Management Agency.    They say TPP countries will face a much greater risk that big pharmaceutical companies will contest government decisions relating to the listing or otherwise of medicines for reimbursement and engage in expensive litigation, with the result that consumers will pay more while corporate profits will be protected.    ""The annex highlights the great influence of Big Pharma in the debate over the TPP,"" Australian National University law professor Matthew Rimmer told the newspaper.   ""Big pharmaceutical companies will use procedural rules to bully countries in the Pacific Rim to roll back their public health regimes.""  TPP opponents said Wednesday's revelations offer just one more reason for lawmakers to demand increased transparency and oppose Fast Track legislation.  ""The leak is just the latest glaring example of why fast-tracking the TPP would undermine the health of Americans and the other countries and cost our government more, all to the benefit of pharma’s profits,"" said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch.  Meanwhile, WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange urged readers to consider the latest leak in a broader context.  In a statement released alongside the leaked text, Assange said,   ""It is a mistake to think of the TPP as a single treaty. In reality there are three conjoined mega-agreements, the TiSA, the TPP and the TTIP, all of which strategically assemble into a grand unified treaty, partitioning the world into the west versus the rest.""  He continued: ""The Great Treaty is taking shape in complete secrecy, because along with its undebated geostrategic ambitions it locks into place an aggressive new form of transnational corporatism for which there is little public support.""

TPP,39da4c,MindStrings,2,Fri Jun 12 07:16:07 2015 UTC,"Outlined and heavily suggested in the agreement is the facilitating of a practice known as Evergreening.  A drug company develops a new drug and receives a patent which stops other producers from making the drugs for 20 years, effectively monopolizing the market for that particular compound and its derivatives.   This leads to preventable suffering and death in developing countries where people rely largely on access to generics.   There are many provisions in the TPP that will expand the monopoly of big private pharmaceuticals on foreign nations, undermining regional public health care in favor of protectionist laws for corporate profit and intellectual property rights on anything from chemical compounds (Pfizer and Johnson Johnson) to crops/food (monsanto seeds protected suing farmers left and right).  While in the US the TTP also prevents congress from passing laws to lower drug costs.  This agreement has very little to do with trade and a lot to do with global economic liberalization, were no stone of human activity is left unturned and everything is made profitable. Governments are left to the mercy of giant multinationals; domestic regulations regarding anything from education to environmental or public health care and intellectual property rights are invalidated by the explicitly stated all encompassing rights of foreign private business conglomerates to generate profit."
TPP,398j6w,RAndrewOhge,2,Wed Jun 10 00:55:26 2015 UTC,"10 Reasons the TPP Is Not a 'Progressive' Trade Agreement  By Ralph Nader - June 09, 2015  ""History shows the very opposite of progress,"" writes Nader, ""when it comes to these democratic sovereignty-shredding and job-exporting corporate-driven trade treaties -- unless progress is referring to fulfilling the deepest wishes of runaway global corporations."" (Photo: CWA/flickr/cc)  ""We have an opportunity to set the most progressive trade agreement in our nation's history,"" it states on BarackObama.com, the website of the president's ""Organizing for Action"" campaign.  One must seriously question what President Obama and his corporate allies believe to be the definition of ""progressive"" when it comes to this grandiose statement.  History shows the very opposite of progress when it comes to these democratic sovereignty-shredding and job-exporting corporate-driven trade treaties -- unless progress is referring to fulfilling the deepest wishes of runaway global corporations.  The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) set our country's progress back through large job-draining trade deficits, downward pressure on wages, extending Big Pharma's patent monopolies to raise consumers' medicine prices, floods of unsafe imported food, and undermining or freezing consumer and environmental rules.  The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is formally described as a trade and foreign investment agreement between 12 nations -- Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam.  The White House is now pressuring Congress to Fast Track through the TPP. Fast Track authority, a Congressional procedure to limit time for debate and prohibit amendments to proposed legislation, has already passed in the Senate, although only after an unexpectedly rough ride.  Here are 10 reasons why the TPP is explicitly not a ""progressive"" trade agreement:   Over 2000 progressive groups recently sent a letter to members of Congress opposing fast track. ""Fast Track is an abrogation of not only Congress' constitutional authority, but of its responsibility to the American people. We oppose this bill, and urge you to do so as well,"" the letter reads. See it in full here. On the other hand, supporters of the TPP and its autocratic, secret transnational governance, include Wall Street, Big Pharma, Big Ag, oil/gas and mining firms, and the Chamber of Commerce--in short the plutocracy does not tolerate voices and participation by the people adversely affected. Only six out of the 30 total chapters in the TPP have anything to do with trade. So what makes up the bulk of this agreement, which was shaped by 500 U.S. corporate advisors? Jim Hightower writes: ""The other two dozen chapters amount to a devilish 'partnership' for corporate protectionism. They create sweeping new 'rights' and escape hatches to protect multinational corporations from accountability to our governments... and to us."" After six years of secret negotiations, Fast Track legislation would allow President Obama to sign and enter into the TPP before Congress approves its terms. It then requires a vote 90 days after submission of this Fast Track legislation on the TPP itself and changes in existing U.S. laws to comply with its terms. No amendments would be allowed and debate would be limited to a total of only 20 hours in each chamber of Congress. By limiting debate and preventing any amendments to the agreement, Fast Track prevents challenges to any issues about how America conducts business with the countries included in the TPP. Some of the countries in the TPP -- Brunei, Malaysia, Mexico and Vietnam, for example -- have terrible human and labor rights records. Those conditions attract big companies looking for serf labor and their accommodating governments. Millions of U.S. manufacturing jobs have been lost due to NAFTA and WTO being railroaded through Congress. The TPP would only expand these offshoring incentives. These types of deals ultimately increase the income inequality gap by displacing well-paid middle-class workers, negating any benefit to lower prices of goods. According toa report for the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR), the TPP would result in wage cuts for all but the wealthiest Americans. The American people have yet to see the full text of the TPP -- it has been negotiated in secret and shown to members of Congress under demeaningly strict secrecy. We only know about some of its terms because of leaks. But Wall Street and industry operatives, who seek to benefit enormously from the TPP, do have access to the text. Why so selectively secretive? Supporters of the deal outright told Senator Elizabeth Warren, ""[trade talks] have to be secret, because if the American people knew what was actually in them, they would be opposed."" The TPP allows corporations to directly sue our country if federal, state or local laws, government actions or court rulings are claimed to violate new rights and privileges the TPP would grant to foreign firms. Firms from TPP nations operating here could attack U.S. regulations over cancer-causing chemicals or environmental concerns before tribunals comprised of corporate lawyers that rotate by day and night between acting as ""judges"" and representing corporations attacking governments. These decisions then cannot be challenged in U.S. courts -- and U.S. taxpayers will get stuck with the bill. So much for our precious sovereignty! The proponents of the TPP claim that it will raise labor and environmental standards. However, the labor and environmental standards included in the TPP are equivalent (or less stringent) to modest ones agreed upon by House Democrats and President Bush in May 2007 in trade agreements with Peru, Panama and Colombia. These provisions have not been effective -- Peru has since undermined these laws, and the Obama Administration has done nothing to enforce them. Nothing in the TPP suggests the unenforceable rhetoric-- cited by President Obama -- will be any different now. TPP will further weaken America's regulatory watchdogs -- we can't use our own government to over-rule TPP tribunal decisions that over-rule our health, safety and economic protections as non-tariff trade barriers. Senator Elizabeth Warren told POLITICO: ""This deal would give protections to international corporations that are not available to United States environmental and labor groups. Multinational corporations are increasingly realizing this is an opportunity to gut U.S. regulations they don't like."" Keeping the United States from being first in health and safety protections is un-American. Prescription drug costs will increase. The TPP includes terms that would limit access to generic drugs and curtail government power to limit the price of drugs. See Public Citizen's report ""The Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) threatens access to affordable medicines."" The TPP could potentially undermine reforms of Wall Street and threaten U.S. financial stability by providing the institutions that caused the 2008-2009 financial crisis a path to circumvent U.S. regulations, such as limiting capital controls and prohibiting any taxes on Wall Street speculation. See the letter sent by Senators Warren, Markey and Baldwin last year to U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman.   http://www.commondreams.org/views/2015/06/09/10-reasons-tpp-not-progressive-trade-agreement"

TPP,38jzww,RAndrewOhge,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:53:06 2015 UTC,"Trans-Pacific Partnership: Why WikiLeaks Is Offering $100K For a Copy Posted: 04 Jun 2015   WikiLeaks is offering $100,000 for a leaked copy of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, says the Washington Post.     It especially wants to see the agricultural chapters, as do we all.  For the WikiLeaks video (and pitch) that explains why it wants those TPP chapters, click here.  It’s worth trying to understand the TPP.    Since my earlier post on it, I’ve been collecting items to help clarify the various stakeholder positions on this agreement.  For the TTP    The Obama administration, for reasons incomprehensible to Paul Krugman, among others, is very much for it.    It claims across-the-board benefits for U.S. agriculture.    For example:  Vegetables: U.S. exports of fresh and processed vegetables to the TPP countries face tariffs as high as 90 percent.   Under the agreement, tariffs across the TPP region will be cut, offering new market access opportunities to U.S. producers and exporters of fresh and processed vegetables.   In 2014 the United States exported almost $5 billion in fresh and processed vegetables to the TPP region.  The USDA’s has produced fact sheets on what TPP can do for individual states.   I checked the one for New York.    The expected benefits to the state are expressed generically, not specifically to New York State:  Fresh and Processed Vegetables: U.S. exports of fresh and processed vegetables to the TPP countries face tariffs as high as 90 percent.   Under the agreement, tariffs across the TPP region will be cut, offering new market access opportunities to U.S. producers and exporters of fresh and processed vegetables.   In 2014 the United States exported almost $5 billion in fresh and processed vegetables to the TPP region.  Dubious about the TTP  Start with Robert Reich’s 2-minute video: “The Worst Trade Deal You’ve Never Heard Of.”  He calls it a Trojan horse.    It allows corporations to sue governments for passing regulations that might affect corporate profits, among other bad things.  Paul Krugman votes “thumbs down” on the TPP.    He argues that trade agreements aren’t all that economically beneficial  and seem to be mostly about intellectual property rights–patents and the like.    He asks: “Why, exactly, should the Obama administration spend any political capital – alienating labor, disillusioning progressive activists – over such a deal?”    His slides illustrate these points.  Senator Elizabeth Warren tells Rachel Maddow that corporate lobbyists and executives—not the American Public—are involved in the TPP negotiations. Joseph Stiglitz makes the same point.  Henry Greenberg and Stephanie Shiau write in the Journal of Public Health: “As it stands the TPPA poses serious risks to global public health, particularly chronic, non-communicable diseases.   At greatest risk are national tobacco regulations, regulations governing the emergence of generic drugs and controls over food imports by transnational corporations.”  Eric Crosbie, MA, Mariaelena Gonzalez, PhD, and Stanton A. Glantz write in the American Journal of Public Health about how trade agreements prioritize investment and intellectual property rights over health.

TPP,38g0sx,RAndrewOhge,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:41:31 2015 UTC,"IMPLOSION RULE BY CORPORATIONS: TPP PARTNERSHIP IMMUNE TO THE LAWS OF SOVEREIGN COUNTRIES.  The Transatlantic and Transpacific Trade and Investment Partnerships have nothing to do with free trade. «Free trade» is used as a disguise to hide the power these agreements give to corporations to use law suits to overturn sovereign laws of nations that regulate pollution, food safety, GMOs, and minimum wages.  The first thing to understand is that these so-called «partnerships» are not laws written by Congress.   The US Constitution gives Congress the authority to legislate, but these laws are being written without the participation of Congress.   The laws are being written by corporations solely in the interest of their power and profit.   The office of US Trade Representative was created in order to permit corporations to write law that serves only their interests.   This fraud on the Constitution and the people is covered up by calling trade laws «treaties».  Indeed, Congress is not even permitted to know what is in the laws and is limited to the ability to accept or refuse what is handed to Congress for a vote.   Normally, Congress accepts, because «so much work has been done» and «free trade will benefit us all».  The presstitutes have diverted attention from the content of the laws to «fast track».   When Congress votes «fast track,» it means Congress accepts that corporations can write the trade laws without the participation of Congress.  Even criticisms of the «partnerships» are a smoke screen.   Countries accused of slave labor could be excluded but won’t be.   Super patriots complain that US sovereignty is violated by «foreign interests,» but US sovereignty is violated by US corporations.   Others claim yet more US jobs will be offshored. In actual fact, the «partnerships» are unnecessary to advance the loss of American jobs as there is nothing that inhibits jobs offshoring now.  What the «partnerships» do is to make private corporations immune to the laws of sovereign countries on the grounds that laws of countries adversely impact corporate profits and constitute «restraint of trade».  For example, under the Transatlantic Partnership, French laws against GMOs would be overturned as «restraints on trade» by law suits filed by Monsanto.  OREGON OUTLAWS MONSANTO: OREGON JOINS AUSTRIA, BULGARIA, GERMANY, GREECE, HUNGARY, IRELAND, JAPAN, LUXEMBOURG, MADEIRA, NEW ZEALAND, PERU, SOUTH AUSTRALIA, RUSSIA, FRANCE, CHINA, AND SWITZERLAND IN BANNING GMOS  Cigarette companies can sue for warning labels on cigarette packs, because these labels discourage smoking and thereby constitute «restraint of trade».  Efforts to control environmentally damaging emissions would also be subject to damage suits brought by corporations.   Under TTIP, corporations would be compensated for «regulatory takings», the corporate designation of environmental protection.   Of course, this means taxpayers would have to pay damages to the polluting corporations.  Countries that require testing of imported food, such as pork for trichnosis, and fumigation would be subject to lawsuits from corporations, because these regulations increase the cost of imports.  Countries that do not provide monopoly protection for brand name pharmaceuticals and chemical products, and allow generics in their place, can be sued for damages by corporations.  Under TTIP only corporations can sue.   Unions cannot sue when their members are harmed by jobs offshoring, and citizens cannot sue when their health and water supplies are damaged by corporate emissions.  THE ILLUSTRATED PROTOCOLS OF ROTHSCHILD’S ZIONISM: HANDBOOK OF OBAMA FOR NWO  Obama himself has no input into the process.   Here is what is going on: The Trade Representative is a corporate stooge.   He serves the private corporations and will go on to a million dollar annual salary.   The corporations have bribed the political leaders in every country to sign away their sovereignty and the general welfare of their people to private corporations.   Corporations have paid US senators large sums for transferring Congress’ law-making powers to corporations.   When these «partnerships» pass, no country that signed will have any legislative authority to legislate or enforce any law that any corporation regards as inimical to its bottom line.  Yes, the great promiser of change is bringing change. He is turning Asia, Europe, and the US over to rule by the corporations.   America’s First Black President is proving himself to be the Uncle Tom of the corporations.   Any and everything for the plantation owners and nothing for the slaves.  Only those who have sold their integrity for money sign these agreements. Apparently Merkel, a Washington vassal, is one of them.  According to news reports, both of France’s main political parties have sold out to the corporations, but not Marine Le Pen’s National Front Party.   In the last EU elections, the dissident parties, such as Le Pen and Farage’s, prevailed over the traditional parties, but the dissidents are yet to prevail in their own countries.  Marine Le Pen objects to the secrecy of the agreements that establishes corporate rule.  As Europe’s only leader, she speaks:  «It is vital that the French people know about TTIP’s content and its motivations in order to be able to fight it. Because our fellow countrymen must have the choice of their future, because they should impose a model for society that suits them, and not one forced by multinational companies eager for profits, Brussels technocrats bought by the lobbies, and politicians from the UMP [party of former president Nicolas Sarkozy] who are subservient to these technocrats».  It is vital that the American public also know, but not even Congress is permitted to know.  How does it work, this «freedom and democracy» that we Americans allegedly have, when neither the people nor their elected representatives are permitted to participate in the making of laws that enable private corporations to negate the law-making functions of governments and place corporate profit above the general welfare?  http://politicalvelcraft.org/2015/06/03/implosion-rule-by-corporations-tpp-partnership-immune-to-the-laws-of-sovereign-countries/"

TPP,36warc,RAndrewOhge,1 point,Fri May 22 17:27:55 2015 UTC,"If Trade Is War, It’s Time We Fought Back  By Sonali Kolhatkar - May 21, 2015  Photo: A demonstrator hoists a sign during a 2014 rally in Toronto. (Shutterstock)  It is not often that members of Congress get the opportunity to weigh in on international trade.   But negotiations over fast-track authority for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) in recent months have given elected representatives the chance to voice their opinions on how the government should engage with other countries financially.   For example, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., released a report this week highlighting various promises that presidents have made over the years as they touted the labor benefits of so-called free-trade pacts like NAFTA, and pointing out how they fell flat in living up to those promises.  But Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (a Vermont independent who is a presidential candidate) are among a tiny handful of lawmakers who are openly skeptical of the TPP.   The battle lines over the secretive multilateral trade pact pit Warren and Sanders against President Obama, as well as most Republicans and Democrats.   A day after dozens of Senate Democrats blocked debate on fast-track authority, most capitulated with a little arm-twisting and deal-making from Obama, and they voted to move forward with the debate.  For decades now, we have heard the claim that free trade is equivalent to freedom in general, that if corporations were allowed to freely do business around the world without having to contend with tariffs, regulations and other so-called trade barriers, it would naturally result in an equal playing field and prosperity for all.  But in fact, the rich have gotten richer, the poor poorer, and the planet has been thrown into peril.   And while international trade does not manifest in lethal bombs, its impact on communities is similar to that of war, as detailed in a new book by Yash Tandon titled “Trade Is War: The West’s War on the World.”   Tandon, who has decades of experience as a high-level negotiator at the World Trade Organization (WTO), said in an interview on “Uprising” that he agrees with Warren, and that she is “on the right side” on the TPP.  The fact that trade deals are negotiated behind closed doors speaks volumes.   The draft of the TPP is so secret that one trade expert, Michael Wessel, who was privy to the details, wrote that “anyone who has read the text of the agreement could be jailed for disclosing its contents.”   He does admit, however, that “[w]e should be very concerned about what’s hidden in this trade deal—and particularly how the Obama administration is keeping information secret even from those of us who are supposed to provide advice.”  Tandon also revealed that it is typical for WTO ministerials to make decisions in secret, in so-called “green rooms.” He explained,   “I’ve seen it many times. On the last day of the conference, the speaker reads out a statement, presumably agreed to by consensus between the parties, and simply bangs on the table and says ‘agreed!’ and nobody objects ... there is no discussion. The process is totally flawed and conspiratorial.”  If free trade is indeed supposed to bring freedom, there should be no reason to conduct negotiations in secret.   Defenders of free trade, conceding that in hindsight NAFTA’s benefits were overstated, now claim that the TPP is different.   In an Op-Ed in The New York Times, Obama’s former chief of staff, William Daley, writes, “When [trade] barriers disappear, we prosper.”   We are supposed to believe Daley, the same man who was tapped by President Clinton to “lead the fight to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement,” and who admits that “[t]he mistake we made in the 1990s was overestimating the potential of NAFTA's positive impact.”  Tandon reflects that, in actuality, “there has never, ever been free trade.”   Going back through history, even “the so-called golden period of the English mercantile system in the 19th century was never free trade. It’s a myth that’s created.”   Using the more euphemistic term of “theory” to describe it, Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz wrote that free trade is “based on numerous assumptions, many of which are simply wrong.”  In fact, the same nations that promote the ideology of free trade today—the U.S., Europe and Japan—created their wealth through protectionist policies that gave privilege to homegrown industries over foreign imports.   Having gained economic dominance through such protectionism, they now spout free trade as a key to world economic equality.  Daley argued, in his defense of the TPP, that “[t]here is no path to middle-class prosperity without tearing down barriers to American exports.”   Really?   Here are multiple paths to middle-class prosperity that do not require leaps of faith in a theory based on many wrong assumptions:   Make it extremely easy for Americans to form and join unions;  pour money into the social safety net instead of into corporate subsidies;  eliminate student debt;  raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and tie subsequent increases to inflation;  strictly enforce all domestic labor and environmental standards;  offer free, quality higher education in all states;  and create a single-payer health care system.   All of those direct, simple pathways to economic freedom have been proved to work in various capacities in countries such as Canada, Sweden, Norway and others. And none of them requires secret negotiations.  In fact, Ann Jones, writing from Oslo for the Los Angeles Times, said Americans are “crazy” to reject the Nordic model of socialism, which she described as “a balance of regulated capitalism, universal social welfare, political democracy and the highest levels of gender and economic equality on the planet.”  A Gallup Poll in March found that there is still strong support for what is termed “foreign trade” among Americans.   The pollster asked the question, “Do you see foreign trade more as an opportunity for economic growth through increased U.S. exports or a threat to the economy from foreign imports?”   Of those identifying as Democrats, 61 percent saw it as an “opportunity,” as did 51 percent of Republicans.   Tandon responded that such results are not surprising, given that “[c]orporations have penetrated policy-making structures within practically every state in the world.”   A case in point is Daley, who was a managing partner at Argentière Capital AG before he crafted government trade policy to favor the likes of his former employer.  As the title of his book bluntly states, Tandon maintains that “trade is war.”   He explained that “over the last 500 years, with the emergence of capitalism as a global system, that’s when trade became war. England went to Africa and started colonizing Africa.”   The same happened when Britain traded with India through the East India Co., kicking off centuries of colonialism, and when Britain traded with China, leading to the Opium Wars.   Tandon concludes that history shows that trade has resulted in “unmitigated, relentless war.”  Tandon is not against trade in general.   After all, humans have traded goods and services since the beginning of recorded history.   “Trade does not have to mean war,” he says, but in the current political discourse, policies favoring corporate elites over the rest of us are what passes for free trade.  While trade pacts have had disastrous effects on U.S. workers, globally and historically even worse examples abound.   Today, Western trade policies in Africa have resulted in inequities of bizarre proportions.   Across the continent, nations that once had strong agricultural traditions are now importing more food than they produce.   Citing an example that illustrates the ludicrous outcome of free trade in his own country of Uganda, Tandon told me, “If you go to my country, you will find in the shops chicken legs from Belgium! We have free-range chickens all over the country but they can’t compete against imported chicken, which is subsidized by Belgium.”   When seen through such a lens, trade is indeed a war.   And, like war, it creates refugees.   The poverty resulting from free trade is driving migration to Europe through the northern African coastal state of Libya, and many thousands of migrants are dying on their journey across the Mediterranean Sea.  But as in most wars, there are two sides.   Corporate backers of free-trade policies have led a highly successful propaganda effort to equate trade with freedom.   But in likening trade to war, ordinary people the world over are pushing back.   In real terms, the WTO has suffered many setbacks, thanks to the sustained efforts of activists and even governments of some developing nations.   Similarly, the TPP has strong popular opposition in the U.S., as well as among the populations of the dozen or so other countries involved.   Tandon calls for “nonviolent guerilla warfare” against the violence of Western-imposed trade deals.   In that case, anti-trade activists are the necessary foot soldiers in this global battle against so-called free trade.  http://www.truthdig.com/report/page2/if_trade_is_war_its_time_we_fought_back_20150521"

TPP,36s8hw,RAndrewOhge,2,Thu May 21 18:31:02 2015 UTC,"Apple, Facebook, Google Missing From Tech Lineup Against TPP  Sam Thielman - 20 May 2015  More than 250 tech companies have signed a letter demanding greater transparency from Congress and decrying the broad regulatory language in leaked parts of the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership trade bill.  The TPP would create an environment hostile to journalists and whistleblowers, said policy directors for the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Fight for the Future, co-authors of the letter.   “TPP’s trade secrets provisions could make it a crime for people to reveal corporate wrongdoing ‘through a computer system’,” says the letter.   “The language is dangerously vague, and enables signatory countries to enact rules that would ban reporting on timely, critical issues affecting the public.”  Among the signatories are activist, sci-fi author and Guardian tech columnist Cory Doctorow. “Democracies make their laws in public, not in smoke-filled rooms,” Doctorow wrote.   “If TPP’s backers truly believed that they were doing the people’s work, they’d have invited the people into the room. The fact that they went to extreme, unprecedented measures to stop anyone from finding out what was going on – even going so far as to threaten Congress with jail if they spoke about it – tells you that this is something being done to Americans, not for Americans.”  Also on the list were prominent members of the open source community, including David Heinemeier Hansson, creator of the popular Ruby on Rails web development framework, image hosting company Imgur and domain name manager Namecheap.  There was a notable absence from the letter of big, international tech companies like Apple, Google and Facebook. Apple and AT&T are part of the president’s International Trade Advisory Committee (which advises the Oval Office on matters relating to industry) and their representatives have presumably been able to read sections of the bill that would apply to their industry.  The letter’s signatories also criticized the fast-track bill – known as the Trade Promotion Authority – which is being discussed in Congress this week.   If passed, the TPA would give Obama a yes or no vote on the trade pact without the ability for legislators to amend it.   The fast-track bill needs to be passed to even give the TPP a shot at approval.  Several other companies and industry trade groups sent statements to Congress in support of the legislation, among them Cisco and the Consumer Electronics Association.   The Seminconductor Industry Association (SIA) said:   “SIA strongly supports trade promotion authority (TPA) and applauds the introduction of this bipartisan legislation. TPA paves the way for free trade by empowering US negotiators to reach final trade agreements consistent with negotiating objectives laid out by Congress. Free trade is especially critical to the US semiconductor industry, which designs and manufactures the chips that enable virtually all electronics.”  TPP has sparked a growing row within the Democrat party. Senator Elizabeth Warren renewed her attack on the pact this week, issuing a scathing report on past trade deals.  Of particular concern to the tech community is an “Investment Chapter” of the TPP drafted in 2010 and leaked by Wikileaks.   The letter’s signatories argue the provisions would allow corporations to use an international legal system to override national sovereignty:   “The TPP Investment Chapter contains text that would enable corporations to sue nations over democratic rules that allegedly harm expected future profits. Companies can use this process to undermine US rules like fair use, net neutrality, and others designed to protect the free, open internet and users’ rights to free expression online.”  The section has likely been revised in the last five years, but whether the provisions have changed has not, and cannot, be disclosed.  “The future of the internet is simply too important to be decided behind closed doors,” said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future.   “The Fast Track/Trade Promotion Authority process actively silences the voices of internet users, startups, and small tech companies while giving the biggest players even more power to set policy that benefits a few select companies while undermining the health of the entire web.”  http://www.truthdig.com/eartotheground/item/apple_facebook_google_missing_from_tech_lineup_against_tpp_20150521#"
TPP,362vj8,RAndrewOhge,1 point,Fri May 15 17:12:14 2015 UTC,"Sen. Warren’s Critique of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Puts Prickly Obama on Defense  Posted on May 14, 2015  Photo: Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and President Barack Obama earlier this year. (AP / Jacquelyn Martin)  Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s unyielding criticism of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade treaty has driven President Obama into uncharacteristic contortions as he defends what he alleges to be “the most progressive trade deal in history”—a deal that contains certain elements he won’t allow the public to see.  Some members of Congress are remarkably limited in their ability to access and interpret the bill.   Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who acknowledged that he has yet to read every page of the deal, told NPR: “I bet that none of my colleagues have read the entire document. I would bet that most of them haven’t even spent a couple hours looking at it.”  NPR explains:  [E]ven if a member of Congress were to hunker down and pore over a draft trade agreement hundreds of pages long, filled with technical jargon and confusing cross-references –- what good would it do? Just sitting down and reading the agreement isn’t going to make its content sink in.  For any senator who wants to study the draft TPP language, it has been made available in the basement of the Capitol, inside a secured, soundproof room.   There, lawmakers surrender their cellphones and other mobile devices and sit under the watchful gaze of an official from the U.S. Trade Representative’s office while they peruse the pages.   Any notes taken inside the room must be left in the room.  Only aides with high-level security clearances can accompany lawmakers.   Members of Congress can’t ask outside industry experts or lawyers to analyze the language.   They can’t talk to the public about what they read.   And Brown says there’s no computer inside the secret room to look something up when there’s confusion.   You just consult the USTR official.  Brown added, “There is more access in most cases to CIA and Defense Department and Iran sanctions documents—better access to congressional staff and others—than for this trade agreement.”  Warren’s criticisms of the deal center on a part known as Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS). She and many other critics have said this clause would allow corporations to sue governments—including the U.S. government—whose regulatory laws threaten to limit corporations’ profits.  An exchange about ISDS between Warren and The Washington Post’s The Plum Line on Monday went like this:  WARREN: I’ve sat with many legal scholars to talk about this issue, and I have not seen a draft that would do what the president says he has already accomplished….Hillary Clinton in her book raised concerns about precisely this issue. Just last week, some of the top legal and economic minds in this country, including the president’s mentor from Harvard, Laurence Tribe, and Nobel-prize-winning economist Joe Stiglitz, raised exactly this concern.  PLUM LINE: Is it theoretically possible to write ISDS in a way that precludes it from overriding regulation?  WARREN: It doesn’t directly tell countries to repeal regulations. It imposes a financial penalty, which has caused countries to change their regulations…[ISDS mechanisms] never had the authority to override regulations. What they had was the authority to impose a monetary penalty directly against the government and its taxpayers. That’s the point at which governments have backed up and said, “we can’t afford this, we’ll just change the law.”  PLUM LINE: You can’t envision even in theory a way to structure ISDS that would assuage your concerns?  WARREN: Once a group of independent arbiters, whose decisions cannot be appealed, can issue a money judgment of any size, then the ISDS problem arises….Here’s what you could do. If corporations had to go through the same procedures that anyone else has to go through to get the trade deal enforced, then the problem wouldn’t exist.  Now, if a labor union says, ‘Vietnam promised not to work people for a couple of dollars a day, and to raise working conditions, and then failed to do it,” they have to get the U.S. government, through the trade rules, to go to Vietnam and prosecute the case. If corporations had to do the same thing, then it would be a level playing field…ISDS gives a special break to giant corporations, a break that nobody else gets.  The Plum Line also asked Warren how financial interests could use ISDS to weaken regulations on big banks:  PLUM LINE: What you’re arguing is that six years of fast track, plus ISDS, could ultimately result in the weakening of financial regulations? You’re not saying ISDS itself would do that?  WARREN: Absolutely right…six years means that whatever the Obama administration has committed to won’t bind the next president. If that president wants to negotiate a trade deal that undercuts Dodd Frank, it will be very hard to stop it.  PLUM LINE: Couldn’t a Republican president simply go straight at Dodd Frank? Would this be any easier than that?  WARREN: Absolutely. Because trade will be fast tracked for six years….A direct run at Dodd Frank potentially takes 60 votes in the U.S. Senate. But doing it through trade authority needs to be done with 51 votes.  PLUM LINE: But wouldn’t that require a direct change to U.S. legislation?  WARREN: It’s possible to punch holes in Dodd Frank without directly repealing it. For example, harmonization of the capital standards and leverage ratios could be adjusted to help the big banks without ever directly contradicting Dodd Frank. But the effects of Dodd Frank would be severely undercut.  Obama’s responses to this and other criticisms were summarized by Talking Points Memo:  Obama has repeatedly shot back that Warren’s criticisms are “ad hominem attacks and misinformation that stirs up the base but ultimately doesn’t serve them well.”  A week ago Obama once again jabbed at Warren saying she is “absolutely wrong” to say the deal could potentially allow participating countries to get around Dodd-Frank regulations.  “Think about the logic of that, right?” Obama told Yahoo News.   “The notion that I had this massive fight with Wall Street to make sure that we don’t repeat what happened in 2007, 2008. And then I sign a provision that would unravel it? I’d have to be pretty stupid.”  Obama has also shrugged of[f] Warren’s claims that the ISDS procedures would weaken financial regulation laws as “bunk.”  Going back to late April, Warren challenged Obama and his administration over his secretiveness with the TPP in a blog titled “You can’t read this”:  The Administration says I’m wrong – that there’s nothing to worry about.   They say the deal is nearly done, and they are making a lot of promises about how the deal will affect workers, the environment, and human rights.   Promises – but people like you can’t see the actual deal.  For more than two years now, giant corporations have had an enormous amount of access to see the parts of the deal that might affect them and to give their views as negotiations progressed.   But the doors stayed locked for the regular people whose jobs are on the line.  If most of the trade deal is good for the American economy, but there’s a provision hidden in the fine print that could help multinational corporations ship American jobs overseas or allow for watering down of environmental or labor rules, fast track would mean that Congress couldn’t write an amendment to fix it. It’s all or nothing. ...  We’ve all seen the tricks and traps that corporations hide in the fine print of contracts.   We’ve all seen the provisions they slip into legislation to rig the game in their favor.

TPP,34y7om,RAndrewOhge,1 point,Tue May 5 15:29:44 2015 UTC,"How the Trans-Pacific Partnership Is Just More Trickle-Down Economics  By Robert Reich - May 5, 2015  This post originally ran on Robert Reich’s website.  Have we learned nothing from thirty years of failed trickle-down economics?  By now we should know that when big corporations, Wall Street, and the wealthy get special goodies, the rest of us get shafted.  The Reagan and George W. Bush tax cuts of 1981, 2001, and 2003, respectively, were sold to America as ways to boost the economy and create jobs.  They ended up boosting the take-home pay of those at the top.   Most Americans saw no gains.  In fact, the long stagnation of American wages began with Reaganomics.   Wages rose a bit under Bill Clinton, and then started plummeting again under George W. Bush.  Trickle-down economics proved a cruel hoax.   The new jobs created under Reagan and George W. Bush paid lousy wages, the old jobs paid even less, and we ended up with whopping federal budget deficits.  Then came the bailout of Wall Street in 2008.   It was sold as the means of preserving the economy.  It ended up preserving the jobs and exorbitant pay of bankers, but millions of Americans lost their shirts.   Small savers were wiped out, and homeowners never got the refinancing they were promised.    No conditions were put on the Wall Street banks for what they were supposed to do for the rest of us in return for our bailing them out.   None of their top executives even went to jail for causing the crash in the first place.    Here again, nothing trickled down.  Now comes the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  It’s being sold as a way to boost the U.S. economy, expand exports, and contain China’s widening economic influence.  In fact, it’s just more trickle-down economics.  The biggest beneficiaries would be giant American-based global corporations, along with their executives and major shareholders.  Those giant corporations initiated the deal in the first place, their lobbyists helped craft it behind closed doors, and they’re the ones who have been pushing hard for it in Congress – dangling campaign contributions in front of congressional supporters and threatening to cut off funding to opponents.  These corporations made sure the deal contains provisions expanding and protecting their intellectual property around the world, but not protecting American jobs.  Supporters of the deal say it contains worker protections.   I heard the same thing when, as secretary of labor, I was supposed to implement the worker protections in the North American Free Trade Act.  I discovered such provisions are unenforceable because of how difficult it is to discover if other nations are abiding by them.   On the rare occasion when we found evidence of a breach we had no way to force the other nation to remedy it anyway.   The Trans-Pacific Partnership is far larger than NAFTA – covering 40 percent of America’s global trade.  If it’s enacted, American workers and consumers will be made even worse off because of another provision that allows global corporations to sue countries whose health, safety, labor, or environmental regulations crimp their corporate profits.  It establishes a tribunal outside any nation’s legal system that can force a nation to reimburse global corporations for any such “losses.”  Big tobacco is already using an identical provision to sue developing nations that are trying to get their populations off nicotine.   The tobacco companies are demanding these nations compensate them for lost cigarette sales.    This provision would mean less protection from corporate harms here in America.   It would require that when the potential cost of a new health, safety, environment, or labor protection is weighed against its potential benefits, the cost of reimbursing corporations for lost profits is added in.  I’ve been through enough regulatory wars to know this added cost could easily tip the balance against protection.  The arguments in favor of the deal aren’t credible.   The notion that the Trans-Pacific Partnership will spark American exports doesn’t hold because the deal does nothing to prevent other nations from manipulating their currencies in order to boost their own exports.  The argument that the deal will help contain China makes even less sense.  Does anyone seriously believe American-based corporations will put the interest of the United States above the interests of their own shareholders when it comes to doing whatever China demands to gain access to that lucrative market?  Big American-based corporations have been cozying up to China for years – giving China whatever American technology China wants, letting China “partner” with them in designing new generations of technology, and allowing China to censor their software and digital platforms – all in exchange for a crack at Chinese consumers.  What we should have learned by now about trickle-down economics is that nothing trickles down.  If the Trans-Pacific Partnership is enacted, big corporations, Wall Street, and their top executives and shareholders will make out like bandits.   Who will the bandits be stealing from?   The rest of us.  http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/we_learned_nothing_from_thirty_years_failed_trickle-down_economics_20150505#"
TPP,34aw6e,RAndrewOhge,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:11:11 2015 UTC,"2,009 Orgs Call On Congress To Oppose Fast Track Authority For TPP  By CTC, www.citizenstrade.org April 28th, 2015  Unprecedented Unity Against Bill to Railroad into Place a TPP Replicating Failed Terms of Past Trade Pacts that Offshored Jobs, Lowered Wages and Exposed Consumer and Environmental Safeguards to Attack . WASHINGTON, D.C. — An unprecedentedly united movement of labor, environmental, family farm, consumer, faith, Internet freedom and other organizations escalated their campaign to defeat Fast Track trade authority for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) today with a joint 2,009-group letter urging Congress to oppose it.  As the TPP text leaks revealed that the pact replicates and expands on the most damaging provisions of past U.S. trade pacts, thousands of organizations nationwide have educated their members about the TPP’s threats to American jobs and wages, food safety, affordable medicines, the environment, financial stability and more.  The pact also replicates the labor and environmental framework first established in George W. Bush’s final trade agreements, which recent U.S. government reports reveal has proved ineffective.  These facts have generated wide opposition to the agreement and undermined the White House effort to characterize it as “progressive.”  “Fast Track is rigged to give special rights to corporations at the expense of workers and consumers,” said Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.  “We’ve seen this before and it has led to massive job loss. We cannot get better trade agreements until we get our priorities straight.”  “While we are not currently permitted to see the terms of the new trade deal, what we do know is the Fast Track process enables trade deals that hurt everyday Americans and stack the deck in favor of corporations,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers.  “It limits public and congressional oversight and does not allow effective enforcement. We need trade policy that strengthens our country — ensuring the rights of workers, and protecting consumers and the environment. We need a democratic and transparent trade process that offers a fair shake for American workers. Fast Track fails these standards and should be rejected.”  The Fast Track legislation would allow the president to sign and enter into the TPP before Congress approves its contents with a guarantee that the done deal would then be voted on within 90 days after it is submitted with ordinary congressional review, amendment and debate procedures forbidden.  If enacted, the legislation would alsoallow whomever may be president in the next six years to unilaterally select trade partners, launch new negotiation, set the terms and sign and enter into any and all agreements before Congress approves pacts’ contents or trade partners and then railroad such future deals through Congress.  “President Obama may believe the TPP is good for America, even if from what we have seen of the text we strongly disagree, but who knows who will be president next, and if Congress approves this Fast Track bill that unknown president would get unacceptable powers to unilaterally dictate trade policies that are do or die for American jobs and wages and the consumer and environmental safeguards on which all of our families rely,” said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch.  The unprecedented opposition to Fast Track has been fueled, in part, by the administration’s admission that the TPP is modeled after the Obama administration’s biggest trade agreement to date: the 2012 U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement.  That pact was sold with the same claims being made for the TPP — that it would lead to more exports and more jobs.  But three years into the deal, U.S. exports to Korea have declined 5 percent and the goods trade deficit with Korea has ballooned 84 percent, which equates to the loss of an estimated 85,000 American jobs using the same trade-jobs ratio that the administration used to claim the pact would create 70,000 jobs.  “Fast Track for the TPP fails to address our nation’s massive and growing trade deficit or currency manipulation in member countries of TPP negotiations,” said Roger Johnson, president of the National Farmers Union.  “Congress should maintain its constitutional authority to address these concerns by rejecting TPA legislation that removes it.”  Leaked texts first published by the Citizens Trade Campaign, and more recently by WikiLeaks, further reveal U.S. negotiators pushing extreme investor-state dispute settlement and intellectual property provisions for the TPP that would jeopardize environmental protections, consumer safety standards, Internet freedom and access to medicine in the United States and throughout the Pacific Rim.  “We have serious environmental concerns about the pending trade agreements which is why we oppose giving a blank check to turn those into law,” said Peter Lehner, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council.  “These agreements could undercut many of our bedrock environmental and public health protections.”  “Congress should reject this retrograde fast track legislation that is designed to usher in the secret Trans-Pacific Partnership — a trade deal that is a raw deal for consumers,” said Wenonah Hauter, executive director of Food & Water Watch.  “The fine print in Fast Track contains an all-out attack on America’s consumer protection and food safety laws. Fast Track allows U.S. trade negotiators to trade away vital consumer safeguards to win giveaways for big business in the TPP or other trade deals.  The safety of American consumers is up for sale under Fast Track.”  “MoveOn.org‘s 8 million members are adamantly opposed to Fast Track legislation that would grease the way to passing the TPP, and hand over even more power to massive, unaccountable corporations,” said Ben Wikler Washington director for MoveOn.org.  “This is a basic, threshold question for Democrats: Will they stand with Elizabeth Warren and the public? Or will they vote against the people that, at least in the past, elected them to office?”  Other organizations to sign the letter include 350.org, Action Aid USA, Alliance for Retired Americans, American Sustainable Business Council, Consumers Union, Defenders of Wildlife, Electronic Frontier Foundation, League of Conservation Voters, NAACP, National Nurses United, Presbyterian Church USA, Presente.org, SEIU, Union of Concerned Scientists and United Methodist Church General Board of Church and Society.  The letter notes that the Hatch-Ryan bill’s much-touted negotiating objectives “are entirely unenforceable,” that its transparency provisions “fail to match even the level of transparency found in past practice,” that “provisions that would ostensibly enable Congress to strip Fast Track authority from trade agreements … are, in fact, more difficult for Congress to trigger than simply voting down a Fast Tracked agreement in the first place,” and concludes that, “Put simply, this is the same failed Fast Track process that has delivered harmful trade agreements again and again.”  https://www.popularresistance.org/2009-orgs-call-on-congress-to-oppose-fast-track-authority-for-tpp/#"

TPP,2ya2e0,swiftrob,2,Sun Apr 12 11:57:34 2015 UTC,"4 Ways The White House Has Gone Full Doublespeak on Fast Track and the TPP  Maira Sutton | Mar 7, 2015  Sen. Ron Wyden and Sen. Orrin Hatch are now in a stand-off over a bill that would put secretive trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement on the Fast Track to passage through Congress.  The White House meanwhile, has intensified their propaganda campaign, going so far as to mislead the public about how trade deals—like the TPP and its counterpart, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP)—will affect the Internet and users' rights.  They are creating videos, writing several blog posts, and then this week, even sent out a letter from an ""online small business owner"" to everyone on the White House's massive email list, to further misinform the public about Fast Track.  In a blog post published this week, the White House flat out uses doublespeak to tout the benefits of the TPP, even going so far as to claim that without these new trade agreements, ""there would be no rules protecting American invention, artistic creativity, and research"".  That is purely bogus, much like the other lies the White House has been recently saying about its trade policies.  Let's look at the four main myths they have been saying to sell lawmakers and the public on Fast Track for the TPP.  Myth #1: TPP Is Good for the Internet  First, there are the claims that this agreement will create ""stronger protections of a free and open Internet"".  As we know from previous leaks of the TPP's Intellectual Property chapter, the complete opposite is true.  Most of all, the TPP's ISP liability provisions could create greater incentives for Internet and content providers to block and filter content, or even monitor their users in the name of copyright enforcement.  What they believe are efforts toward protecting the future of the Internet are provisions they're advocating for in this and other secret agreements on the ""free flow of information"".  In short, these are policies aimed at subverting data localization laws.  Such an obligation could be a good or a bad thing, depending on what kind of impact it could have on national censorship, or consumer protections for personal data.  It's a complicated issue without an easy solution—which is exactly why this should not be decided through secretive trade negotiations.  These ""free flow of information"" rules have likely been lobbied for by major tech companies, which do not want laws to restrict them on how they deal with users' data.  It is dishonest to say that what these tech companies can do with people's data is good for all users and the Internet at large.  Myth #2: Fast Track Would Strengthen Congressional Oversight  The second, oft-repeated claim is that Fast Track would strengthen congressional oversight—which is again not true.  The U.S. Trade Representative has made this claim throughout the past couple months, including at a Senate Finance Committee hearing in January when he said:  TPA puts Congress in the driver’s seat to define our negotiating objectives and strengthens Congressional oversight by requiring consultations and transparency throughout the negotiating process.  Maybe we could believe this if the White House had fought for Fast Track before delegates began negotiating the TPP and TTIP.  Maybe it could also have been true if that bill had ensured that Congress members had easy access to the text and kept a close leash on the White House throughout the process to ensure that the negotiating objectives they had outline were in fact being met in the deal.  However, we know from the past several years of TPP negotiations, that Congress has largely been shut out of the process.  Many members of Congress have spoken out about the White House's strict rules that have made it exceedingly difficult to influence or even see the terms of these trade deals.  The only way Fast Track could really put ""Congress in the driver's seat"" over trade policy would be if it fully addressed the lack of congressional oversight over the TPP and TTIP thus far.  Lawmakers should be able to hold unlimited debate over the policies being proposed in these deals, and if it comes to it, to amend their provisions.  It would be meaningless if the new Fast Track bill enabled more congressional oversight, but if it did not apply to agreements that are ongoing or almost completed.  Myth #3: Small Online Businesses Would Benefit from Fast Track  Then the third misleading claim is that Fast Track would help small businesses.  Their repetition of this has become louder amid increasing public awareness that the TPP has primarily been driven by major corporations.   What may be good for established multinational companies could also benefit certain small online businesses as well.  The White House says that tariffs are hindering small online businesses from selling their products abroad, but research has shown that the kinds of traditional trade barriers, like tariffs, that past trade agreements were negotiated to address are already close to non-existent.  Therefore it is unclear what other kind of benefits online businesses would see from the TPP.  Even if there were some benefits, there are many more ways that the TPP could harm small Internet-based companies.  The TPP's copyright provisions could lead to policies where ISPs would be forced to implement costly systems to oversee all users' activities and process each takedown notice they receive.  They could also discourage investment in new innovative start-ups, even those that plan to ""play by the rules"", due to the risk that companies would have to sink significant resources into legal defenses against copyright holders, or face heavy deterrent penalties for infringement established by the TPP.  Myth #4: TPP and Other Secret Trade Deals Are a National Security Issue  The last, and most confounding of the White House's assertions is that the TPP and TTIP are an ""integral part"" of the United States' national security strategy, because its ""global strategic interests are intimately linked with [its] broader economic interests.""  As we have seen with the U.S. government's expansive surveillance regime, ""national security"" is often invoked for policies even if they directly undermine our civil liberties.  It is hard to argue with the administration whether the TPP and TTIP are in fact in the United States' economic or strategic interests, since only they are allowed to see the entire contents of these agreements.  Either way, it seems like a huge stretch to say that we can trust the White House and major corporate representatives to determine, in secret, what is in fact good digital policy for the country and the world.  We may be hearing this line more and more in the coming weeks as the White House becomes more desperate to legitimize the need for Fast Track to pass the TPP and TTIP.  Conclusion  The fact that the White House has resorted to distorting the truth about its trade policies is enough to demonstrate how little the administration values honesty and transparency in policy making, and how much the public stands to lose from these agreements negotiated in secret.  The more they try and espouse the potential gains from Fast Track—while the trade agreements this legislation would advance remain secret—the more reason we ought to be skeptical. If the TPP is so great and if Fast Track would in fact enable more democratic oversight, why are the contents of either of them still not public?

William Barber  by Deirdre Fulton, staff writer, Feb 27, 2015  ""This deal would give protections to international corporations that are not available to United States environmental and labor groups,"" says Sen. Elizabeth Warren. (Photo Credit: EFF w/overlay)  Congress is expected to introduce a so-called 'Fast Track' bill—which would accelerate passage of the corporate-friendly Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and other trade proposals—as soon as next week.  But despite the Obama administration's aggressive push to speed approval of problematic trade pacts, opposition to Trade Promotion Authority and the deals it would advance is mounting.  Earlier this week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) penned an op-ed for the Washington Post outlining her criticism of the TPP provision known as 'Investor-State Dispute Settlement' (ISDS), which she claims would ""tilt the playing field in the United States further in favor of big multinational corporations.""  ""This free trade agreement is another step in a global race to the bottom."" —Senator Bernie Sanders  Such provisions ""would give protections to international corporations that are not available to United States environmental and labor groups,"" Warren stated in an interview with Politico published Friday.   ""Multinational corporations are increasingly realizing this is an opportunity to gut U.S. regulations they don’t like.""  Warren and other senators took to the chamber floor on Thursday to further voice their concern that passing Fast Track authority, which would cede the nuts and bolts of crafting trade agreements to the executive branch for at least four years, will undermine the U.S. economy.  ""The talent and tenacity of American workers hasn’t changed—but our leaders’ commitment to them has,"" said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio).   ""And nowhere is that abandonment more clear than the free trade agreements we now approve with little oversight and minimal debate.""  Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, called on Congress to ""develop a new set of trade policies, which work for the ordinary American worker and not for large corporations and big campaign donors.   We need to create decent-paying jobs in this country for a change and not just in other countries around the world.""  He added: ""This free trade agreement is another step in a global race to the bottom to boost the profits of large corporations and Wall Street by outsourcing jobs; undercutting worker rights; dismantling labor, environmental, health, food safety and financial laws; and allowing corporations to challenge our laws in international tribunals rather than our own court system.""  Also Thursday, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) introduced a new tool for Twitter users to ask three key congressional leaders—Sen. Ron Wyden, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, and Rep. Steny Hoyer—to come out against Fast Track.  ""The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) talks are stalling while the White House assures its trading partners that this secret trade agreement won't be amended when it comes back to Congress for ratification after the President signs the deal,"" Maira Sutton explained for EFF.  ""That's why the Executive is scrambling to get its allies in Congress to pass Fast Track,"" she continued.   ""If they succeed, the U.S. Trade Representative can block remaining opportunities for the examination of the TPP's provisions by lawmakers who could ensure that this secret deal does not contain expansive copyright rules that would lock the U.S. into broken copyright rules that are already in bad need of reform.""  And National Nurses United held its own press conference Thursday ""to sound a Code Blue on Fast Track,"" calling special attention to the TPP's implications for food safety, drug prices, and access to medicine.  ""While there are many good reasons to reject Fast Track, the nation’s registered nurses are particularly concerned about these trade agreements' threats to public health and safety,"" said registered nurse Deborah Burger, a member of the NNU's Council of Presidents.  In an op-ed at The Hill on Friday, North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP president Rev. William Barber, who spearheaded the Moral Monday movement, called on Congress to ""slow down.""  ""We have learned that when these trade deals get rushed through, working people get the short end of the stick,"" he wrote.  ""The TPP reminds us of the North American and the Central American Free Trade Agreements. Most of the victims of these deals have been poor, minorities, and other members of what used to be called the 'working class'.""  ""The issue now is to slow down the process of ratification,"" he added. ""The people most affected—southern workers in particular—need to have a chance to challenge the potentially transformative—and damaging—TPP.""   http://www.commondreams.org/news/2015/02/27/fast-track-looms-opposition-mounts-corporate-friendly-trade-deals"

TPP,2v7uld,flarn2006,2,Sun Mar 8 21:53:38 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Since it requires all 12 of the participating nations to agree, it will take a long time.  It started in 2005, I personally don't think it will be done until 2018 at the earliest.  TPP gets in the news occasionally when someone wants to talk-out against global trade or wikileaks leaks a draft."
TPP,2v7uld,Lodley,1 point,Mon Feb 9 02:36:58 2015 UTC,"Trans-Pacific Partnership:       The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a proposed regional regulatory and investment treaty. As of 2014 [update], twelve countries throughout the Asia-Pacific region have participated in negotiations on the TPP: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States, and Vietnam.  The proposed agreement began in 2005 as the Trans-Pacific Strategic Partnership Agreement (TPSEP or P4). Participating countries set the goal of wrapping up negotiations in 2012, but contentious issues such as agriculture, intellectual property, and services and investments have caused negotiations to continue into the present,  with the last round meeting in Ottawa from 3–12 July 2014.   Implementation of the TPP is one of the primary goals of the trade agenda of the Obama administration in the United States of America.  On 12 November 2011, the nine Trans-Pacific Partnership countries announced that the TPP intended to ""enhance trade and investment among the TPP partner countries, to promote innovation, economic growth and development, and to support the creation and retention of jobs.""  Some global health professionals, internet freedom activists, environmentalists, organized labor, advocacy groups, and elected officials have criticized and protested the negotiations, in large part because of the proceedings' secrecy, the agreement's expansive scope, and controversial clauses in drafts leaked to the public.

TPP,2uc7aa,RAndrewOhge,1 point,Sat Jan 31 20:50:20 2015 UTC,"TPP = NAFTA on Steroids By Jo Comerford | Jan 28 2015   Republicans in Congress want to work with the Obama administration to fast-track the passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).  The TPP is the largest—and worst—trade deal you’ve never heard of, having been devised in secret by representatives of some of the world’s largest corporations.  It’s so big and has the potential to do so much damage, it’s been likened to “NAFTA on steroids.”  Will you help spread the word about fast track and the TPP by watching and sharing the video right now?  http://youtu.be/3O_Sbbeqfdw"

After leaving the plaza for a moment around 3:15 pm, Trepanier reentered the plaza to grab his bag. An officer stopped him.  “The [officer] approached very aggressively, and directed [Trepanier off of the plaza,” the witness said. Trepanier insisted that he needed his property but the officer persisted.  “All the sudden that officer and another officer started to assault Lionel really violently. They manhandled him and wrestled him to the ground. His face was jammed into the cement. He was prostrate on the ground and immobilized—utterly no threat what so ever—and they started punching Lionel very aggressively … punching him in the back of the rib cage repeatedly.”"
TPP,1uolnj,Shark_Lazers333,1 point,Wed Jan 8 03:41:24 2014 UTC,"The Trans-Pacific Partnership Would Ban ""Buy American"" and ""Buy Local"" Procurement Preferences  There isn't much online to explain what exactly the following means, but I will do my best to deduct conclusions. Here is my source: http://www.exposethetpp.org/TPPImpacts_BuyLocal.html   The TPP's procurement chapter would require that all firms operating in any signatory country be provided equal access as domestic firms to U.S. government procurement contracts over a certain dollar threshold.    All TPP foreign investors involved will have equal business opportunity in America as any American would. (?)   The United States would agree to waive ""Buy American"" and ""Buy Local"" procurement policies for all such foreign firms, eliminating an important policy tool to use U.S. tax dollars for U.S. job creation.    Foreign investors will not have to pay taxes, and will not be obligated to create jobs for Americans.   Some corporate TPP proponents argue that these rules would be good for the United States because they would ban domestic preferences in all signatory countries, allowing U.S. firms to bid on procurement contracts in other countries on equal footing with domestic firms.    So yes, basically the 12 countries all have access to each other's foreign markets, and are all treated with the same rights as domestic business owners and investors."
TPP,1uolnj,snsr,1 point,Wed Jan 8 06:30:05 2014 UTC,"I'm wholeheartedly opposed to the content and context of the TPP; particularly the corrupt manner in which the US Trade Representative has sought to enact it.  That said, in and of itself buying and selling debt is not that big of a deal. What is a big deal is the (lack of) regulation of markets where collateralized debt obligations are bought and sold, as well as the dishonest manner in which those financial products are rated by credit agencies.  .   The deal would require domestic law to conform to the now-rejected model of extreme deregulation that caused the crisis.    While the TPP does force normative, overriding changes to domestic laws in countries that accept the 'treaty', aside from public opinion things haven't really changed since the financial crisis in the USA. Deregulation is still the norm,  Glass-Steagall has not been reinstated, and you still don't have the right to discharge student loan debt in bankruptcy court.   The extension of this normative requirement to include enforcement of intellectual property rights should be particularly concerning to anyone reading this website. Third party liability, as potentially required by the TPP, is a serious threat to open communication on the internet.  .   In other words, we will force entire countries to buy our debt. As a student, if Vietnam purchases a stock in my debt, Vietnam would OWN me.   I don't think investors would be forced to purchase anything.  In your scenario  investors from Vietnam would, in a fashion, collect the money you borrowed from a bank. They purchased the right to collect your debt for less than the total amount of that debt including interest. They would not own you."
