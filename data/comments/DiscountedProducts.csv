Because of this, I bought myself the Logitech TK820 thinking it's trackpad would be better, but it's just as bad. (Just bigger.) But I do appreciate the standard sized keyboard that comes with the TK820.  If you are used to using Apple's Magic Trackpad, you will be sorely disappointed with the Logitech K400 & TK820 trackpads usability.

DiscountedProducts,388f2n,mwrenner,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:55:18 2015 UTC,I keep hearing that. But then again I hear that none of your choices actually matter in the end game. I've been fighting whether I should play it or not.
DiscountedProducts,388f2n,Binary_Omlet,2,Wed Jun 3 05:22:47 2015 UTC,"In terms of the very final bit, no it doesn't matter too much.  But there are a ton of things throughout the game that make each playthrough pretty different.  I mean, you can kill off your whole party in the second game and they're just not there in the next one.  Either different characters take their places and do it differently or you're SOL.  It's more about crafting the story.  I mean, what did you really expect for the ending?  There's a big bad that you gear up to deal with at the end.  Was it ever really in doubt that that would happen?"
DiscountedProducts,388f2n,mwrenner,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:42:15 2015 UTC,No but I was just kind of had high hopes for the whole save state dragging on to the next game thing. And let down when I learned it didn't matter. I really had high hopes for Mass Effect and when I heard that a kind of slashed them. I think I may give it a try eventually. So hopefully  the sale still going on on payday.  Edit: words are hard.
DiscountedProducts,388f2n,Binary_Omlet,2,Wed Jun 3 07:59:49 2015 UTC,"Oh man, there are tons of things that carry over.  It just doesn't have a ton of impact on the last mission.  But the rest of the game changes a lot  Side missions unlocked, different options available.  The ability or inability to save other characters lives.  The development of relationships with the different characters.  And a lot of it pays off big in three. It just doesn't impact the final mission."
