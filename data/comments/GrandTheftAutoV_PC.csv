GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e379o,vesko18,4,Tue Jul 21 17:36:37 2015 UTC,It's not that bad. It's like a 5fps drop.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e379o,_TheEndGame,0,Tue Jul 21 18:45:59 2015 UTC,"Very bad for me though. 5FPS drop means I go from 20fps to 15fps, which is quite significant in terms of performance."

I would be standing still getting 150 fps (that was my cap at the time) and as soon as I jump it would stutter and drop to 90-100, but that's what the program is reading. For all intents and purposes, it feels like it drops to 2 FPS as the stutter is happening, then once I land on the ground it quickly comes back to 150.  How could they mess up the game that bad that something as simple as jumping causes stuttering?"

GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2hxl,ManSkirtDude101,11,Tue Jul 21 13:27:18 2015 UTC,Any chance you were modding?
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2hxl,Dommy73,5,Tue Jul 21 13:28:55 2015 UTC,For realz it looks like the thing is trying to verify the game files :|
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2hxl,TheRealGaycob,10,Tue Jul 21 17:24:06 2015 UTC,91MB
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2hxl,ben876,7,Tue Jul 21 14:48:01 2015 UTC,My update had also 91MB (Steam version) as others report.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2hxl,Darkj3sus,4,Tue Jul 21 14:15:15 2015 UTC,403MB for me on retail disc. That looks like you had modded your files and it's replacing them with stock files.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2hxl,NemoEsq,2,Tue Jul 21 16:02:31 2015 UTC,It is replacing the RPFs you modded (if you modded.) Use OpenIV to circumvent that. There is a tutorial for doing this on the OpenIV website.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2hxl,MowwMoww,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:52:26 2015 UTC,Yep that was it thanks
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2hxl,Valeriun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:20:29 2015 UTC,400 MB on R*SC for me.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2hxl,zanesix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:19:20 2015 UTC,It's probably replacing the RPF's you modded with the new and un modded ones. It was actually around 400 MB's for me.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2hxl,gabrielvis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:26:15 2015 UTC,mine was 400 mb
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2hxl,Pinksters,2,Tue Jul 21 19:31:40 2015 UTC,No..it was around 400mb for me on Steam.  Others were reporting 90mb.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,ringadu,10,Tue Jul 21 12:47:53 2015 UTC,The field of view is limited because of clipping in certain vehicles. It's easier for them to limit the slider than fix the clipping.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,aidanrooney95,6,Tue Jul 21 15:30:03 2015 UTC,"The clipping is minimal, besides, people like me couldn't care less about clipping, if it means that you get a playable FOV."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,SwanChairUh,7,Tue Jul 21 15:57:50 2015 UTC,"Minimal, that's your opinion. A lot of people would find it distracting. I really don't understand why they wouldn't just allow the slider to go higher but give a simple warning once the FOV starts clipping in vehicles."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,SwanChairUh,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:57:30 2015 UTC,"Someone just told me theres no clipping in vehicles at all, so yeah no issues in upping FOV anyway!"
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,aidanrooney95,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:53:08 2015 UTC,"When using the modded fov, there is certainly clipping in about every vehicle. Vanilla of course doesn't clip."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,JustRefleX,2,Tue Jul 21 18:58:49 2015 UTC,"Yea that's true, which is why many people use the FOV mod, but i don't think Rockstar wants any clipping as it makes the game look broken/unfinished."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,Soulshot96,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:59:03 2015 UTC,They could add a fov slider and add a max limit each vehicle. Fine the FOV would change in vehicles then but still better than stuck at the current fov
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,ThisPlaceisHell,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:55:46 2015 UTC,"I used the FOV mod, if a mod can have different values for 1st person FOV for vehicles, on foot, ADS, why can't the fucking developer? Its NOT HARD TO DO. Dial in the right values in the FOV mod and you get no clipping anywhere, and a higher FOV. Your argument is irrelevant."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,Spankinator92,3,Tue Jul 21 19:27:42 2015 UTC,"Because of shit like this, I'm so glad I'm a PC gamer. Modders can step in and make the right decisions that these game companies refuse to. It's unfortunate that something as simple as field of view is still not getting the proper treatment from major game companies in 2015 though. Some seriously archaic stuff, that fov slider."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,SnowBr0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:39:36 2015 UTC,"Can't in GTA: Online though, which sucks :("
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,ghuldorgrey,4,Tue Jul 21 17:52:49 2015 UTC,"there really is no excuse tbh. The only argument that comes close to being reasonable is that it can be ""advantageous"" for those who prefer higher fov. Advantageous as in ""He sees more on his screen! That's like cheating hurr durr"" If they added a better slider, that argument would also be bullshit since you can turn it up yourself"
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,de_Fedora,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:40:06 2015 UTC,Just use the fov mod.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,ghuldorgrey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:38:05 2015 UTC,Yea but not possible in multiplayer
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,de_Fedora,6,Tue Jul 21 17:10:05 2015 UTC,I have used it since launch. No ban for me.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,Soulshot96,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:25:00 2015 UTC,Seriously? I thought it would be instant ban somehow. Might give it a try then.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,SnowBr0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:42:18 2015 UTC,Definitely worth using. Makes it 10 times more usable to be in first person

GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,SnowBr0,2,Tue Jul 21 17:22:02 2015 UTC,Raises hand  I too have been using the FOV mod Online without any issues...
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,Smokenspectre,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:28:45 2015 UTC,Can't in GTA Online.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,rakov,2,Tue Jul 21 17:53:37 2015 UTC,Yes you can.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,SnowBr0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:57:16 2015 UTC,They said today it's bannable.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,TicklishRocket,2,Tue Jul 21 17:58:51 2015 UTC,Source?
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,SnowBr0,2,Tue Jul 21 18:07:32 2015 UTC,"You can keep downvoting me all you want.   ""we are not actively targeting players using mods in Story Mode, nor are we explicitly implementing protections against them in-game. Our primary focus is on protecting GTA Online against modifications that could give players an unfair advantage, disrupt gameplay, or cause griefing.

GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,TicklishRocket,4,Tue Jul 21 18:10:56 2015 UTC,"FOV  creates an unfair advantage, just as much a giant ass monitor does or does not. I'd say the p2p netcode creates more of an unfair advantage, where the host can manipulate anything he/she wants without repercussion."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,Speedyhatcat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:43:18 2015 UTC,Not just host. Everyone can. P2P isn't bad but Rockstar didn't bother with any kind of verifying data.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,osborn2shred11,2,Tue Jul 21 19:23:39 2015 UTC,It says nothing about the fov mod and they have said that from the start. No one has been banned for using the fov mod so I guess it's your loss ¯_(ツ)_/¯
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,SwanChairUh,2,Tue Jul 21 18:18:09 2015 UTC,"Doesn't mention any specific mod, it mentions mods in general. FOV Mod is an unauthorized mod. And yes, people have been receiving 14 day bans because of the FOV mod."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,Smokenspectre,0,Tue Jul 21 18:57:31 2015 UTC,"The people that reported being banned for using the fov mod were in fact using other mods in multiplayer alongside the fov mod, so no the fov mod will not get you banned."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,Slenderman327,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:14:52 2015 UTC,"Actually i know a few people that used only the fov mod, and where banned for 14 days. also this has a poll with almost 500 people saying they have been banned for it. and tons of topics on rockstar support. The reason being is the FOV mod uses a memory patch, the server picks it up quite easily. If you can link me to an official statement from Rockstar stating that you will not be banned. Until then I will advise people to not use it in multiplayer."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,aidanrooney95,2,Tue Jul 21 19:25:25 2015 UTC,they said they don't want to patch it as they don't want their game to be an fps which is pretty dumb
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2duj,Slenderman327,13,Tue Jul 21 13:31:27 2015 UTC,Then why the fuck put first person in the game? Let us decide how we want to play the game. Give us a better field of view and make it so we can have proper prone stances.

GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e0tpa,Manic020,18,Tue Jul 21 02:31:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah same thing happened to me. Been banned for a month, still not unbanned. They don't give a fuck."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e0tpa,Atari1337,3,Tue Jul 21 03:30:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Their support responses were 100% copy/paste replies and didn't address half of my messages to them. They just basically plug their ears and say ""ur banned stfu fggt"" until you give up."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e0tpa,picodroid,-13,Tue Jul 21 16:32:28 2015 UTC,"since u are banned for a month u got banned before for 2 weeks. they ""should"" not give a fuck tho"
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e0tpa,yeekeke,6,Tue Jul 21 05:08:41 2015 UTC,"Here, you dropped these: y, o"
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e0tpa,CarpetFibers,2,Tue Jul 21 11:44:45 2015 UTC,That's the thing. This is my first ban. It doesn't say a release date either. Pretty sure it's permanent. I've contacted rockstar support multiple times.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e0tpa,Atari1337,4,Tue Jul 21 05:32:31 2015 UTC,Rockstar don't do permanent bans. If they did the script kiddy count would be way lower.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e0tpa,ExogenBreach,2,Tue Jul 21 06:12:42 2015 UTC,Rockstar absolutely does do permanent bans.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e0tpa,erich00041,2,Tue Jul 21 16:15:37 2015 UTC,"Well I beg to fucking differ. I haven't been able to access any online features, let a lone play with my friends, for weeks."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e0tpa,Atari1337,3,Tue Jul 21 16:50:42 2015 UTC,You are talking out of your ass though.  You have no idea if this guy really got a persistent ban or not. Rockstar's banning and cheat detection claims cannot be trusted.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e0tpa,viveislife,4,Tue Jul 21 11:21:06 2015 UTC,"Although that may be the only thing you can really do R* does not give two shits since they are so ""confident"" of their anti cheat system. Its fucking broken."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e0tpa,bma5298,4,Tue Jul 21 07:43:06 2015 UTC,"The entire netcode is broken by design.  They fucked up things which no studio has ever fucked up. And in fact, their latest anticheat system consists of checking things in memory, but if you were to put another system in the middle to selectively drop packets which coincidentally are the 'you get xx damage from xx weapon' ones it would almost be immune. A rewrite would cost them too much (as they chose this setup to save money on dedicated servers, even if some choices are just plain stupid).  tl;dr i can't wait for a fully functional stable FiveM release so I won't have to deal with Rockstar's incompetence anymore."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e0tpa,Not-an-account,24,Tue Jul 21 10:08:04 2015 UTC,So when ecerybody's car explodes and it says USER killed everybody. That person is usually innocent?  I was in a lobby where that happened and everybody freaked out and reported the guy.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e0tpa,Sn3ipen,26,Tue Jul 21 03:18:32 2015 UTC,Yes. The cheater focused trainers have had the ability to blame innocent players for blowing up the whole lobby for a long time. It's even an option on the PS3 mods.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e0tpa,Rusty4x4,20,Tue Jul 21 03:23:04 2015 UTC,"The way you can sometimes be sure is that the framed person blows themselves up too, but it's marked as a suicide."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e0tpa,DigChrono,7,Tue Jul 21 06:17:49 2015 UTC,Almost all trainers have that ability.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e0tpa,Chvrche5,2,Tue Jul 21 04:56:01 2015 UTC,"Thats what i thought durring the session too and said that nobody could be this stupid, but i guess the stupid ones where the people who reported the poor guy."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e0tpa,Sn3ipen,4,Tue Jul 21 03:32:28 2015 UTC,"If you're legit and had no mods installed contact Rockstar support. Tell them what happened, provide any evidence to prove you innocent and ask for the funds to be removed. Try to use proper grammar and be polite and professional."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e0tpa,Robert_Skywalker,3,Tue Jul 21 15:34:37 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure you are wrong. I had a quick scroll through your previous posts and saw mods mentioned a few times. Have you ever used mods in the past in GTA V? Even if you're not using them now your account may have been flagged, you don't necessarily get a ban straight away."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e0tpa,jordan78790,5,Tue Jul 21 14:13:58 2015 UTC,Both of those have happenned to me countless times but no ban here. OP have you done anything else in the past that may have gotten you banned?
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e0tpa,ShipWreckLover,5,Tue Jul 21 09:26:08 2015 UTC,"When this happened to me, bar the banning bit,  I took the initiative in calling up R* and was told that they were aware that that was a tactic the cheaters used and that I wouldn't be banned for it."

GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e0tpa,DerBlutigeBaron,4,Tue Jul 21 13:01:32 2015 UTC,"If the whole lobby freaks out and start to report you, i am pretty sure you can be banned."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e0tpa,Sn3ipen,2,Tue Jul 21 16:13:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah like you said you can't, however I'm sure you know that getting alot of money will make the anti-cheat start tracking your stats ?  That's the problem of Peer-to-Peer, as the system doesn't know if it's you (the hacker) who is getting the money or another hacker spawning it.  But looks like R* is trying to create a half dedicated server with GTA V PC like half of the network data via P2P and the other half via R* cloud for tracking."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e0tpa,funmw2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:32:06 2015 UTC,"Chances are, there's no cheat monitoring system in place. The most Rockstar are willing to put their time into is preventing cheats, like in the most recent patch. I've had 10 million GTA$ poured on my head by a modder, and I didn't get banned. The most likely reason for modders getting banned is number of reports, and video evidence submitted to the Rockstar ban hammer email."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e0tpa,CapCharlisimo,2,Tue Jul 21 20:05:30 2015 UTC,"I am 90% sure you're lying and just salty about being banned for using mods, but just in case you aren't, email Rockstar or open a ticket and provide some sort of evidence."

GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e0tpa,TheRealGaycob,10,Tue Jul 21 09:37:03 2015 UTC,"I can tell you now that it wasn't being framed or reports from other players that got you banned. It was definitely the ""too many transactions"" part... as explained here, receiving a large amount of hacked GTA$ in a short time can get you an almost instant ban. If you have sincerely not used trainers online before, I would advise you contact player support, explain your situation and ask that they verify that your account has not been flagged before for dll or asi injections. The ban was issued out automatically and is a result of a flaw in their detection system, whereas bans which occur in banwaves often have been verified manually."

GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2558,CH00SEAUS3RNAM3,2,Tue Jul 21 17:36:55 2015 UTC,It's not really fixed. Jump in a T20 and cruise around at top speed and the hitching is pretty blatant.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2558,ice445,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:50:13 2015 UTC,agreed... my initial thoughts were that they fixed it but if you play for an hr you will notice the stuttering still but now i get over 60 FPS almost always... the most it dips down to is 55; so the stutter is confusing to me

GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2558,SporadicSheep,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:56:09 2015 UTC,"There's a new bug where you get extreme stuttering when you jump. Also, driving around causes random stuttering as well. Can't comment on crashing into cars though. At least they fixed the shooting stutter. But really whatever they did in the IGG updates that ruined performance, they need to just undo all of it. This is atrocious performance problems that I fear might slip past the net of user reports and bug fix patches and be a permanent affix to the game."

GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3dzsch,satrnv_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:04:06 2015 UTC,"Way too taxing. FXAA doesn't look good enough, MSAA is a FPS hog and still there are so many edges I can cut myself. Only TXAA or frame scaling are good enough, but might as well watch a slideshow at that point. I am exaggerating of course, but I prefer high frames (with current setup I almost everytime get around 80-90 fps) than looks. If I put absolutely everything on maximum I get around 30-40 fps, absolutely playable, but I prefer a smoother gameplay."

GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3dzsch,kaspar737,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:13:41 2015 UTC,How do I do this?
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3dzsch,DJMooray,2,Tue Jul 21 13:45:34 2015 UTC,"Open up the nvidia control panel, go to ""manage 3D settings"", click on the ""Program Settings"" bar, select GTA V (gta5.exe), and you should get a whole list of graphical options. You should find ""Antialiasing - FXAA"", turn it to 'on'.   here and here are the settings I use, I would recommend using them, as they have helped increase my performance and reduce stuttering. Might not work for everyone but it's worth a try. If you use MSAA, try using MFAA as well. The idea with MFAA is to make, for example, 2x MSAA look like 4x MSAA but at the performance cost of 2x MSAA. If you don't use MSAA then I would just leave it off"

GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3dzsch,Shadow_XG,18,Tue Jul 21 15:29:51 2015 UTC,I have no idea why but since this patch I have got a decrease in FPS. The stuttering on the whole has been fixed but somehow I get lower FPS. I used to get a steady 70 fps but now its in the 50s and 60s which seems very strange. I would update my drivers but the new drivers are very unstable on my system for what ever reason. (I have a GTX 970 running on 350.12)  Anyone else having this issue?
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3dzsch,Silent991,7,Mon Jul 20 23:09:42 2015 UTC,"I've got even worse performance now as well, i would actually say it is worse than the 1.28 patch. at least it was playable in 1.28, now it dips all the way down to 11 fps in some places. I'm using a r9 285 and an fx 8350."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3dzsch,Setiuas,0,Tue Jul 21 01:18:48 2015 UTC,"Though the fps drop is not ""great"" I can deal with it (in my case at least). And I guess we will just have to hope that there is a better fix in the next patch.  Edit: Not sure why the down votes but ok"

When most nvidia card were getting absurdly low performance last patch, Amd GPUs were doing great. My theory is the tables have turned after this update, it's not unplayable by any means, but dropping to 40 fps from a solid 55-60 isn't too pleasant.

GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3dyw0i,Nuguns21,20,Mon Jul 20 18:50:06 2015 UTC,Definitely a new update. 400mb like he said in post.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3dyw0i,darkknightxda,6,Mon Jul 20 19:54:08 2015 UTC,My steam update was 91MB  *update  specs  gtx 760 OC  amd fx-4130 4.3ghz  *8MBGB RAM -.-   Performance FIXES! Frame drop is Gone - hard stutter is Gone - Ammunation no longer lags At All - Minigun frame drop is Gone - Micro stutter still remains.   So they narrowed it down. Yesterday it was almost unplayable and was angering. I can sit happy with this
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3dyw0i,Nuguns21,3,Mon Jul 20 21:24:27 2015 UTC,you should download more ram

GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3dyw0i,litehound,0,Tue Jul 21 05:19:50 2015 UTC,"Save money for a bit longer and go get a new motherboard and an i5 4460/i5 4590. The i5 is for around the same price as the 8350 but beats it in single threaded performance. If you still want more performance then you can get an i7 4790k while they are being cleared out for intels new Sky lake CPUs. And if your graphics card fails for some reason, you have integrated graphics to keep you playing GTA5 at XBOX 360 graphics."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3dyw0i,Bentosen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:24:18 2015 UTC,The 8320 was amazing for me when I upgraded from my FX-4100.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3dyw0i,litehound,0,Tue Jul 21 05:20:10 2015 UTC,"Its a matter of perspective. I didn't notice how bad the 8350 was until I got my current CPU and saw all the smoke and mirrors fall apart. The problems start with its design, where two cores will share one FP scheduler. That means if both cores want to use the FP scheduler then one has to do nothing and wait for the other to finish.   Try this in a game, open task manager and right click the game's process and set affinity. Turn off the physical cores 0, 2, 4, and 6. Watch the games performance become unstable because the cores you just turned off are using the FP scheduler while your logical cores running the game want to use the FP scheduler too. Normally it would avoid having one core waiting but with the other core doing something else in the background, it has no choice.  The focus hidden in the FX series processors was to save money. That's why you don't see any AMD processors for competing in the enthusiast/business market. An enthusiast doesn't care about cost and a business knows its making an investment that will pay off the $1000 chip."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3dyw0i,bob1001,2,Tue Jul 21 10:13:38 2015 UTC,"The 8320 is a great little thing, can only assume the 8350 is good as well."

I feel like performance still may not be 100% of what is was before the igg patch but if anything that part is very objective and I may be wrong it's definitely extremely close.

GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3dyw0i,Moyk,15,Mon Jul 20 20:19:18 2015 UTC,its 91MB for Steam users...  and 0.400 GB(based on 400mb patch) / 65 GB = 0.6% change in code.  Are you a guru because your positive thinking is enlightening.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3dyw0i,w0ss4g3,11,Mon Jul 20 20:22:36 2015 UTC,"Erm, I hope you realize that most of the 65GB are textures, audio, and other heavy content. Actual ""code"" definitely makes up a minority of the overall size.  Also, sometimes a 0,01% change of the code can mean a huge difference."

GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3dyw0i,KrabbHD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:01:42 2015 UTC,"True. But, 90mb of code is still a shit ton of code. Most of the game is probably music and textures anyway.    I guess most, if not all shaders need less space than 90MB.  For comparison, a very basic Bloom shader needs 144kb. SMAA is ~1400 lines of code. That's around 60kb's.  Again, 90mb is a shit ton of code."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3dyw0i,Geicher,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:22:13 2015 UTC,They could probably fit every bit of actual code in the game within 400MB. 90MB is a game changer.

GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e1ssg,Aphexes,3,Tue Jul 21 08:20:47 2015 UTC,Is your card overclocked from the factory? If so try putting it back to reference clocks. I had to lower the clocks on my msi gtx 970 by -75 mhz and the crashing went away.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e1ssg,Eazy-Em2,2,Tue Jul 21 09:45:58 2015 UTC,It's a custom PCB and I've done my best trying to underclock this card. Not much luck there.

GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e1291,vesko18,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:53:18 2015 UTC,I would have thought it's more graphically intense than SP because:   More concurrent NPC car models/colours Many MANY more customised cars Many customised characters Possible to fire 30 times as many weapons at the same time   Especially since I have set density and variety options fairly low for SP and this doesn't seem to affect MP as I get the same density and variety others get.

GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e1r83,B-Knight,3,Tue Jul 21 18:48:50 2015 UTC,Bro there are bad FPS drops everywhere still. The update did literally nothing. Here's a small list of problems:   Ammunation now stutters really bad to a point where the game actually freezes for a few seconds. Crashing in a car causes long term and short term stuttering Shooting causes long term and short term stuttering Shooting AT cars causes short term stuttering FPS has dropped by about 10-20%+  Stuttering is still very well there. It just isn't as clear as before and can actually be triggered by doing nearly anything where particles appear. The game is a fucking mess.

GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e1s6i,pasuu,4,Tue Jul 21 08:31:29 2015 UTC,"If they had more armor, the savage would be a lot more worth it, but because a single rocket can take out ANY helicopter, you might as well use the Buzzard.  The Savage has explosive rounds (identical to the jets) and the secondary is lock-on rockets fired every 0.5 seconds.  Buzzard has miniguns on each side. They can be a little buggy sometimes, not dealing any damage or not hitting its target. The secondary is firing two lock-on rockets with a reload interval inbetween.  If you just want something to use for contact missions, the Savage is great, but the Buzzard can be just as useful yet not as effective."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e1s6i,Spankinator92,2,Tue Jul 21 08:43:14 2015 UTC,And how would you compare Hydra to these helicopters?
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e1s6i,Spankinator92,2,Tue Jul 21 08:47:53 2015 UTC,"well, the hydra is just a ""better"" Lazer jet. Hydra is better off being used as a regular jet that can hover if absolutely needed.  The Hydra can't aim very effectively if you are hovering. Helicopters are much more maneuverable and mostly better in places where you need to hover in place.  It has the same weapons as the Lazer jet. Explosive rounds cannon and 2x lock-on rockets."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e1s6i,jordanjam,3,Tue Jul 21 08:55:28 2015 UTC,"It's worth mentioning that the Hydra is not as maneuverable as the Lazer though, so it's not better in every way."

The lazer has so much better acceleration that it is so much more useful in a dogfight. The hydra is useful for free for alls because of its strong rudders.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e1s6i,Big_Adam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:43:28 2015 UTC,Still annoyed people can't use the second gun on the savage.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e1s6i,pigpaco,3,Tue Jul 21 08:55:46 2015 UTC,They patched it. Now the copilot can shoot rockets (savage).
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e1s6i,Big_Adam,2,Tue Jul 21 14:10:00 2015 UTC,Fecking ... yeeeesssss
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e1s6i,Firebaall,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:11:44 2015 UTC,No doubt.  The Savage should have Cargo Bob style health.  2-3 rockets should be needed to take down a Savage.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e1s6i,JuneSnowpaw,3,Tue Jul 21 17:39:16 2015 UTC,The Buzzard is the best in terms of dodging homing missiles and all around balance for flying.   The Valkyrie is fun if you have friends/crew.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e1s6i,TheRealGaycob,3,Tue Jul 21 08:32:59 2015 UTC,Yeah the Valkyrie is fun but it's like moth to a flame. Few shots from an AR and it'll start smoking and cutting the engine out :P
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e1s6i,JuneSnowpaw,4,Tue Jul 21 09:47:00 2015 UTC,No need to worry about AR's when a hacker just blows you out of the sky when he hears you having fun :)
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e1s6i,GFaure,3,Tue Jul 21 09:52:00 2015 UTC,"I think they all have their place. I own all 3 by now and think the Savage is better for missions than the Buzzard due to it's killing power. Buzzard is still my favorite when i'm on my own though, it's much more agile and quick, but the delay on missiles means it's slightly less dangerous, and the minigun feels underpowered compared to the explosive minigun on the Savage. When there's more than just me playing though, Valkyrie all the way. It's so beautiful, it's agile, decently fast and when you have all your guns manned it's simply a wrecking machine. Range is a bit meh and you will take fire if your frontgunner is not capable though."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e1s6i,GFaure,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:15:37 2015 UTC,I hesitate between buzzard and savage.. is savage worth buying because of its power even if it hasnt that mobility as buzzard?
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e1s6i,Chvrche5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:25:14 2015 UTC,"If you don't plan on harassing people in freemode the Savage is still a solid choice. People with homing missiles will shoot you down in 3 seconds, where as the buzzard can sometimes avoid them by being more agile. For missions and shooting npc's from range either is good, so go with the one you like better looking. I found that the Savage's size is something to take into account too though, I've crashed a few times because my huge mainblades get stuck somewhere. The buzzard is much smaller and easier to navigate, land somewhere or fly between buildings. I guess that is just a matter of getting used to though. Don't take the hydra, in reply to your other comment. It's not convenient because it's not mobile enough. You can make it work but it will be overclassed by heli's. (unless of course you have a missions where you need to shoot down a plane). It's a fun vehicle, but that's it."

GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e1s6i,osborn2shred11,2,Tue Jul 21 09:45:45 2015 UTC,"I bought the black one and almost always play the Airwolf theme on my Self-Radio every time I hop in it. Its sleek design and retractable landing gear, and it being the fastest helicopter made me decide on buying it."

GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e253y,_TheEndGame,2,Tue Jul 21 12:27:14 2015 UTC,"Dont be a drama queen. You're not being punished because you chose to support the gaming industry. All game shave bugs, all games have performance issues. GTAV is a huge game. It is completely normal that every patch brings its ups and downs. The game isn't perfect, but considering how much content there is to it and because it is playable even with the various issues, I think it deserves more respect than you're giving it. At least they're trying to make the game better with FREE content ever so often. Not like other major companies like Activision with thr COD serie (which doesnt have performance issues most of the time, but shitty campaigns and barely any support and free additions after release), Ubisoft with Watch_Dogs and Assassin's Creed (which were unplayable upon release, using full buggy DRM protection, downgraded from their potential, and even unfinished) and EA with many titles (DLC whoring here. But they're getting better with stability upon release and they have an amazing support team, which actually is a good thing)"
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e253y,nextqc,6,Tue Jul 21 11:56:33 2015 UTC,"If you think rockstar updates the game for free because they care about us you are very mistaken. Every update brings more ridiculously priced items in order to encourage people to buy the shark cards. ""They are trying"" and ""It's a very complex game"" is not an excuse. The game ran fine before and after the update everyone had issues. How much testing do you think they did before releasing the update? Of course they cannot test every setup but when the majority of players are having performance issues I doubt they really tested the update. I understand that profit is their goal but when they ignore us in such a way they should not have our trust nor respect."

GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e253y,nextqc,2,Tue Jul 21 20:31:01 2015 UTC,"Even though OP has said it, I'll say it too:   Rockstar don't give a fuck about the fact their updates are free. Their latest 'ill gotten gains' update is literally released JUST so they can earn some money. This is obvious because things like a golden fucking jet costing $10mil would never be bought without the help of modding, EXTREME grinding or buying shark cards. What one do you think they chose? Let me just remind you R* are a BILLION DOLAR COMPANY. BILLION. Do you have any idea how much money that is? Their AAA game which they built themselves with a group of over 100+ should not have bugs, especially when they have a billion dollars sitting in their pockets."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e253y,B-Knight,0,Tue Jul 21 15:39:29 2015 UTC,"I am a programmer. I know how software development work. I know that to make a small app you need weeks to make sure it works fine. GTA is so huge that even with a 100+ team, it would take months to test every single parameters. So most companies only test the new stuff with the most popular actions. When doing bug fixing, fixing one thing can lead to breaking multiple orhers without the programmer noticing. Even with a 100+ people team, it might not be noticeable. Keep in mind that they are 100+, but a lot of these arent even testing the game itself. Plus there are parameters that are hard to test like being multiple people on a server in a closed patch testing environment. For that, they need to have feedback from the community to apply patches ever so often. Rockstar does give a shit. If they didn't, they wouldnt even bother to drop patches. Yes, I agree money is driving them the same way money drives everyone. Every game has bugs. Some are just really hard to detect. Currently, GTA is playable. Its not broken. Yes there are performance issues from time to time. But what would you expect. Patches are going to roll in soon. Just be patient.  Now, for the Ill gotten gains update. Its new free content. Yes they want to make money with Shark cards. Yes $10G is a lot for a golden plane. Or is it? Would you rather have a sense of accomplishment or just buy the fucking plane and say the game sucks because its not challenging. It is easily doable to acwuire the items from that update. You just have to work for it. Imagine if you bought CoD and you could buy your way up to prestige 10. Would you rather want to pay real money for it or work for it? Its the same thing here. The goal of the update was to give players with too much money more ways to spend and more incentives to keep playing the game. This is good. Not bad."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e253y,kaiworm,3,Tue Jul 21 16:15:45 2015 UTC,"You honestly think the community is going to work for it? Lol. We must be talking about different communities. Especially since this plane is no different than the original luxor and, with mods, I can make a normal luxor gold anyways. Bar the drinking but, woop de doo, $10Mil for a drink!  As for the other bits, some parts you're right others not so much. I literally just played on the new update which was meant to be the patch for the performance issues. My game now crashes when entering ammunation or freezes dramatically, my FPS has dropped by about 20%+, stuttering is caused by anything that releases an effect or particle, the game stutters so much to a point where shooting accurately is a thing of the past ( This is a pretty big feature if you ask me ) and many, many, many more...   On top of that, R* has a team of DEVS over 100+... Game testers are abundant. Seriously. We're talking about a billion dollar company that releases games played by millions around the world. People are employed to test this shit and seeing as its widely an issue nearly everyone is getting, the fact that not even one tester or even a dev for that matter got the problem just shows that either they didn't test it or, as I said, don't give a fuck. It's really hard to miss something that 99% of your PC community is getting.   As for free stuff, yeah I love 'em for it. But they're slowly starting to turn into money whores. It's not that obvious right now, but it's definitely happening. They're brilliant devs, never denied that, but they really need to buck their ideas up, be more transparent about the games state and actually fix shit. And fast. They ARE NOT short on man power or will power so there is literally no excuse. Especially for a problem as big as this.  EDIT: Just made myself a little more clear."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e253y,Zombybomb,3,Tue Jul 21 16:27:58 2015 UTC,Something as ridiculous as stuttering when jumping is not excusable no matter how big your dev team is. How could they have missed that?
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e0s7t,Amadeus_Ray,5,Tue Jul 21 02:02:18 2015 UTC,Well on release day it was a mostly solid game with good performance for most players. A few bugs here and there.  Now the game is getting worse with every update because each update breaks something new or lowers performance for no noticeable benefit.

GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e0s7t,TKoMEaP,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:03:49 2015 UTC,"Pretty much the same.   Game still gets updates every other week or so, mods are of course banned in Online (this includes mods that are for only Single Player, since the game does not recognize if a mod only works in Single Player or not, so best to just remove the mod if you wanna go online), and there are still a bunch of hackers in Online.   However, story mode is a blast, so definitely play that if you haven't already.  Online is pretty much only fun with a group of friends or if you only play popular custom matches. Other than that, it's pretty easy to get burnt out in.   And R* hasn't necessarily supported mods or anything, policy is pretty much the same as all other GTA games (tho, I wouldn't say they are being hostile, they just don't really care).   Biggest difference from day one is that Online will actually adjust to your settings, where in the past a LOT of graphical settings had no affect Online."
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e2200,serzhanja,4,Tue Jul 21 10:28:33 2015 UTC,"Alright, good idea. First off, do not use the in-game benchmark since it has very different results from the actualy in-game performance.  Now, for benchmark areas:   Vinewood street, the main one Area around Grove street Beach in Los Santos (any place) Paleto Bay + forests around Paleto bay Sandy shores + speeding on the highways Then, take a vehicle, start driving fast with it and crash into something multiple times, observe the fps. Take minigun, start shooting around. Throw C4s at cars and make them explode, the more explosions the better benchmark :D   After all this, it would be very very useful if you could play the game for about 2-3 hours without closing it and THEN try to re-do some of these benchmarks since GTA tends to run much better in the beginning than later on mainly because of the memory leak where RAM is constantly filling up (mine goes from like 6 gigs all the way to 13 in several hours).  Good luck"

Those fps drops means your CPU is limiting your double GPU's power. Upgrade to some latest i5/i7 CPU and you will get 60+ fps.   Or you can disable SLI and play with single GPU to stop any CPU bottlenecks. Also try lowering settings which require CPU power. Draw distance scaling, Anti-Aliasing, etc."

GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3dxzdd,4i60r,2,Mon Jul 20 17:24:51 2015 UTC,"How many people have sent a ticket to Rockstar, because they hadn't recieved their rebate?"

GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3dxzdd,ParagonXIX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:12:38 2015 UTC,I've sent in three and got a reply to one about two weeks after the game came out and they where not aware back then and they still haven't answered my 2 from last month.   But I'm 110% sure they know about all the problems.
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3dxzdd,Chokinghazard5014,-3,Tue Jul 21 05:04:42 2015 UTC,I just sent one.  Strength in numbers.  I wish we could SPAM them with hundreds/thousands of them.   Where is Anonymous??
GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3dxzdd,archdemon001,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:49:46 2015 UTC,"Not anything that would do.  10,000 ""I have x graphics card and cpu and I have x problem"" complaints is worth less than one ticket with proper diagnostics attached.  Chances are that they are aware that many people have ""fps probs with good grafix card"".  Event view and action center's reliability monitor give some information on crashes.  Dxdiag has a txt file you can save.  The launcher.log file in your gtav documents for petty problems that could be solved yourself.  You are being obtuse in wanting to spam."

GrandTheftAutoV_PC,3e1ts2,Meh_broken,2,Tue Jul 21 09:28:20 2015 UTC,It started on the fist patch on the 20th April  I had a false positive and had to exclude it way back then.   Glad you are sorted though
