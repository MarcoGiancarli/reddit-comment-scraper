ChiefKeef,3dxuov,theKozey,9,Mon Jul 20 12:54:26 2015 UTC,"There is tons of new drill music coming out all the time. Some older/classic artists have been arrested or killed, but not all.   Newer artists to check out that are good are Benji Glo, Red Chapo, 30ShotRico, Dae Dot, Reesemoneybagz, Blasthisass600, JusBlow600, ManeMane4CGG, Oblock Ocho.   Older artists that are still in Chi making new music are SDot, Lil Reese, Edai, Lil Herb, Lil Bibby, Lil Mister, Rico Recklezz, Billioinaire Black, Prince Dre, so many others.    nobody cares about the chicago beefs anymore   DJ Akedemiks, Rap Catchup, and Kollege Kidd among others would care to disagree with you.   The beefs are still there, Chicago has had some of its worst violence in recent months.   It doesn't seem dead to me, maybe not as much spotlight on it as 2012/13, but its still there."

Plus a mod messaged me and basically told he he's not gettin banned. But I thought a personal attack gets someone banned? Even if it's on someone trolling, and I don't troll except for a good reason... All choppa does is troll and you can't personally attack him. Shit make 0 sense at all  Learn to save your sub from becoming a shithole from a bunch of kids trolling saying they have music and riling up lil kids.

And your right it doesn't justify action just because someone is upset, but the only purpose of informing me of your song collection is to harass and insult other users, the reason politics is justified in the way it upsets people is because those are discussions that need to be had.
