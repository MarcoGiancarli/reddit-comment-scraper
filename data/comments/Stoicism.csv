As a Stoic, part of your duty is to find what you are a best fit for, both in your own nature, and society's.  If you jump in to make comments and they help others (or at least, don't harm them), then there's nothing wrong with them per se. Stoicism is all about underlying motivation and intention.

Do I just accept whatever happens and follow a specific path given to me? How much do I forge myself and spend time on choosing a career or is it not even worth worrying about?

Not directly related to stoicism, but if doing good with your career is important to you, you might find that it's possible to do good in more than just the obvious philanthropic careers by looking into ""effective altruism"".

Stoicism,3e30w7,Chanthien,10,Tue Jul 21 15:56:33 2015 UTC,"Preferred indifferents are just that, indifferent. They do not result in passions, their attainment or lack thereof have no emotional consequences to a sage. (Expect for what you are translating as ""protopassion"", of course.)  Even a sage makes decisions, though. Everyone conscious has to. To quote the song (Rush?), even if you choose not to decide, you still have made your choice.  What it means to say that one indifferent is preferred over another is just that: when there is a choice to be made, some things will be chosen (the more preferred of the less) over others. To the sage, for which these preferences are genuinely also indifferents, there will be no emotional consequences of the results.  The Stoic definitions of virtue don't even make sense without preferred indifferents. To be virtuous is to act according to nature, which is to behave in a way that optimizes more over less preferred indifferents."
Stoicism,3e30w7,cleomedes,3,Tue Jul 21 16:51:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your answer. I believe your reply answers my question about preferred indifferent perfectly. But your reply also helps me realize that what I actually wanted to ask was about preferred indifferents with regards to positive emotions.  More specifically, now that we agree that preferred indifferents have no emotional consequences for a sages, and that a sage is the ideal that all practitioners of Stoicism should aspire to even if they may never realize it; does that mean the Stoics truly believe that ideally one should not feel any positive emotion whatsoever toward anything other than virtue? Is there, in other words, no ""middle ground"" whatsoever between hedone and chara?"
Stoicism,3e30w7,jimstride,6,Tue Jul 21 17:08:39 2015 UTC,"the Stoics truly believe that ideally one should not feel any positive emotion whatsoever toward anything other than virtue?   If I may... what do you mean by 'positive emotion'? Do you mean, for instance, joy as opposed to, say, grief?   Would grief then be regarded by you as a negative emotion?   I don't think the ideal man of the Stoics allows himself to get carried away with any emotion, positive or negative, that is, (respectively,) rational or irrational.  As to whether or not the ideal man prefers one indifferent to another... I would recommend you get yourself a copy of Arrian's discourses of Epictetus and read book 3, chapter 22, 'On the calling of a Cynic'. It is much better to go direct to actual extant sources than to refer to modern intepreters' interpretations!   Epictetus' ideal was the Cynic Diogenes and, in a different way, Socrates, both of whom he idealised. His view seems to have been one in which, (where these two sages were concerned,) all externals were dispreferred, that is, they counted for nothing, virtue alone and unadulterated being choiceworthy.  Hope that helps."
Stoicism,3e30w7,cleomedes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:13:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply. I understand and largely agree with your point regarding indifferents, but I was really more asking about indifferents with regard to Stoic psychology.  Regarding ""positive emotion"", it was more a turn of phrase to help describe the Stoic idea of harmful and healthy passions. So I don't really use the word to talk about joy or grief in general because such things were not included in Stoic psychology.  That's one reason why I asked this question in the first place, actually. I didn't realize that when the Stoics talk about harmful (pathe) and healthy passions (euphatheiai) they mean a concrete group of passions instead of some vague idea. Pathe include craving, aversion, pain, and hedonistic pleasure; while euphatheiai include joy, discretion, and wishing.  So in that scheme, both ""ordinary"" joy and grief would be consider harmful, except that the Stoics still acknowledge that normally joy is ""positive"" as opposed to negative ""grief"". But as far as I know, there definitely are healthy passions (euphatheiai) that are recognized by the Stoics as something only the Sage possess but practitioners of Stoicism can still sometimes catch a glimpse of.   So I'm not sure how to understand your point that the ideal Sage would not feel any emotions, whether rational or irrational. Especially since the ideal Stoic way to live is according to nature, which for human beings means being rational and social. Of course the Sage would only feel joy toward the truly good (virtue) and discretion toward the truly bad (vice); but those are still passions (euphatheiai)."
Stoicism,3e30w7,Night_anthem,3,Wed Jul 22 02:35:59 2015 UTC,"does that mean the Stoics truly believe that ideally one should not feel any positive emotion whatsoever toward anything other than virtue?   If you take ""emotion"" to refer to either pathe or euphatheiai, then yes. However, the line between ""proto-passions"" and either is really not clear. Affection and gratitude both seem to have been not only regarded as acceptable, but actively cultivated; see Seneca's On Benefits for a lengthy discussion of gratitude, or this fragment of Hierocles for advice on cultivating affection. In Marcus Aurelius I.9, he admires a teacher of his for being free of passion and filled with affection, in the same sentence, so clearly affection is not a passion (or at least not always). For more, see this FAQ entry."

In any case, I don't think making places for affection would weaken the Stoic edifice too much; and Robertson does make the convincing case that a rational desire for virtue (boulesis) can translate to a rational desire for oneself and others to flourish in accord with virtue; which could then take the form of affection, benevolence..."

Stoicism,3e30w7,domperalt,4,Tue Jul 21 21:28:20 2015 UTC,"Don't confuse passions with emotion.   Passions are emotional attachment, and the unhealthy passions involve attaching our emotions to things beyond our control.  But a Stoic Sage cultivates a natural and benevolent affection for all people. She wishes them good fortune, even though whether they have such fortune is beyond her control.  Please note the ancient Stoics actually argued vehemently against the idea that one should work to purge oneself of all emotion. Stoic training is not about avoiding emotion, but avoiding attachment to emotion.  So a Stoic Sage might feel pleasure when eating a steak, but she also won't complain if she goes for weeks eating nothing but bread. A Stoic Sage may enjoy living in the city where her family resides, but will not hesitate to choose exile if that's what virtue demands."
Stoicism,3e30w7,malfight,2,Tue Jul 21 17:52:15 2015 UTC,"Passions are emotional attachment   ""attachment"" is, I think, a Buddhist way of looking at it rather than a Stoic one. I can't think of a Stoic text that describes it this way. The Stoics, rather, focused on assent, whether or not one jumps from a feeling to an intellectual judgement. They may have been referring to something similar using radically different conceptual infrastructures; I don't know. I don't think ""attachment"" was really part of the Stoic intellectual toolbox, though."

My take is:  (1) You're right, Epictetus and the ancient Stoics - living in the times and places they did - would not have agreed with post-Enlightenment, post-Freudian agnostic atheism. On the other hand, since their concept of god(s) is so different from the divine concept that modern atheists reject, any hypothetical dialogue on the subject would border on meaningless.  ...and...  (2) One reason Epictetus praises Zeus et al. so much is that he values the rational part of the human mind so highly. Humans seem to have a special something that no other animal has. Where does this special ability come from? Well, without any concept of evolution, and without Steven Pinker around to explain it, how else could a man living 1,900 years ago understand it? Epictetus therefore conceives of each person's Reason as a tiny portion of the divine, a spark from a larger flame. So, assuming that you also ""believe in"" and value the human capacity for logic and reflection, maybe you can at least appreciate Epictetus' sense of piety."

I think it shows how defensive people are about their identities.  A few thoughts:   Stoicism was developed over a course of centuries and spanned multiple civilizations. The boundaries of Stoicism are not clearly defined. I think it is more accurate to say that there is a core nucleus of ideas that are central to it and a cloud of other less substantial beliefs and conclusions that surround it. In other words, there is not a ""Stoic"" shaped box that you have to fit into. Maybe it is more accurate to say, where does one fit on the Stoic spectrum? If someone is skeptical enough of a person to reject religion and replace it with science/logic, it surprises me when they are interested in adopting a philosophy wholesale as opposed to deconstructing it and examining its elements. Philosophies are not religions. They do not completely fall apart if you pick out pieces quite like religions do. I also find it interesting that atheists so often presuppose that people that are religious are also illogical/irrational.

Either way, you have to admit that, starting the worldview of someone who is not already familiar with your religion, it's going to be very hard to construct a rational chain of arguments showing him why it is true. But I don't think you should interpret irrational as meaning insane or stupid. It just means you can't really prove you're right, like you said.

Yes, Stoicism was a large system with elements developed to integrate well with each other. That you can't be inspired by any of it unless you believe all of it seems like an unwarranted conclusion to me.  Going on a not particularly Stoic rant...  Many philosophies and religious traditions offer valuable insights. To adopt any of them wholesale seems to me to be an indication of remarkable lack of capacity for independent thought. To reject all of all of them is to neglect some of your best resources for making your most important decisions.  To identify one-self as an X (Stoic, Christian, Epicurean) is sometimes a convenient short-hand for quickly communicating the philosophy or religion one finds more agreement with than others, but this has dangers as well. (See here.)  I consider it not just a valid option, but an essential responsibility (at least to the extent needed for moral decision-making) to do ones best to develop for ones-self the best philosophy one can (and do ones best to follow it!), using all of the resources at ones disposal. To attempt to abdicate this responsibility to some pre-existing teacher or school of thought is to neglect ones essential responsibility as a rational being."

To think that the ancients were irrational for believing in God (and to think billions of people around now are irrational for believing in God) doesn't speak to me of that kind of humility.   I find the same problem with a lot of atheists who are interested in Buddhism, they rarely seem to even know about the full depth and range of Buddhism, before they start claiming stuff like 'it's all cultural accretions'. You hear the same thing from people interested in Stoicism, who claim that the Stoics just happened to be theists because everyone else around them was. This does a tremendous disservice to the full theistic implications of their system. They were the great theists of their day. I'm not even sure if they ask themselves why the Stoics were so interested in God, and what, if anything, Stoicism would lose (or if it's coherent at all) if God was ignored."
Stoicism,3duu6z,paniniconqueso,5,Mon Jul 20 03:21:28 2015 UTC,"""Engaging with a tradition in a charitable manner"" seems like an essential pre-requisite to using such traditions as resources; you can best be inspired by something if you actually understand it. To engage with a tradition does not mean believing it, or even thinking it plausible. Indeed, it is quite possible to engage charitably with something you think absurd by current standards. Consider, for example, the Stoic assertion that people living in the northern hemisphere can never have contact with those living in the southern, because the equatorial regions of the Earth are too hot to be travelled across. (See the Lectures on Astronomy by the classical Stoic Cleomedes, from whom I stole my username.) This is not something I take seriously, and indeed it would be absurd for me to believe it. However, reading classical Stoic scientific accounts can be useful in understanding their system as a whole, which in turn is useful for mining it for inspiration.   What is important for engaging with a tradition in a charitable manner is to read it first with an intention to actually understand it, and secondarily to focus ones attention of those aspects that you consider most useful and insightful, and consider carefully how they might be adapted and adopted. It is also, of course, possible to read material with an intention of attacking it, and the results can be very different, not just in emphasis but in beliefs about what they said. An awful lot of philosophy carries a lot of ambiguity, and a charitable reading will tend to interpret ambiguous statements in ways with which the reader would most strongly agree, and and uncharitable one in ways the reader considers most obviously wrong. Too charitable a reading can also be a problem, because the truth may not be either, and indeed is most interesting and valuable when it is too alien to the reader to be either. (This is why I put understanding first in priority when reading, ahead of charity.)  My main objection in writing my comment above was to the attempt at dissuading non-theists from looking into Stoicism at all."
Stoicism,3duu6z,cleomedes,2,Mon Jul 20 04:06:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with all you say. My intention personally is not to stop non-theists from looking into Stoicism. In fact, I think the opposite should be encouraged, and even if they come to the diametrical opposite conclusions of the Stoics (and end up becoming Epicureans or something like that), at least they would have done it in a better way than not investigating it at all. However I think it does a disservice to the Stoics and to seekers if one doesn't state what the ancient Stoics believed. I really don't like it when people say that 'it's okay to pick and choose, you don't need to believe in what the Stoics believed etc, it's okay to be an atheist and not believe what the Stoics believed', because even if that is true, these are responses that have the end result of squelching investigation before it even begins.

It matters only for bookkeeping, when doing such things as organizing books in a bookstore or library or similar activities. If you are trying to write a book or article on Stoicism and claimed they were atheists, that would be an inaccuracy, and a major one at that, but that isn't what most people are up to. If you are reading Stoic (or any other kind of) material and finding much of it insightful, just stopping and switching to something else when you discover something you disagree with is horribly wasteful.  Encouraging someone to read Epicurean material rather than Stoic after they have been reading Stoic material and finding it useful, but given no indication of sympathy toward Epicurean views, just seems like bad advice to me. This is not to say that it would be bad for the OP to read Epicurean philosophy, but nothing in the post suggested to me that he would find Epicurean writing more valuable than Stoic.  Disagreeing with one aspect of a philosophy is not a reason to stop studying a philosophy, particularly given the nature of the surviving Stoic writings, which survived in part because of their inspirational value to those whose theological views (mostly Christian) were no closer to Stoic ones than atheism. What matters when selecting inspirational reading is how well it inspires, how much it shifts how you look at the world, improves you as a person, or gets you to see the world in an entirely new (to you) way. If you have to ignore it modify some (or even many) aspects of it, so what?   When I participate in this subreddit, I try to make it clear what is my personal view, and what is the classical Stoic view, often only really even discussing the latter, limiting the former to what I think those interested in Stoicism might find useful. That I disagree with enough classical Stoic material that I can't really be classified as a Stoic is not, I think, of any importance."

There is a kind of arbitrariness at work whenever we isolate Stoicism (or any other such movement) from all the immemorial influences which have moulded it. Paradoxically, it loses its integrity if one extricates it from all that has preceded it, all that runs roughly parallel with it, and all that follows on from it.     Stoicism is a very large collection of moving targets within a much larger historical, social, linguistic, intellectual, religious and moral, landscape.   Thus, for example, by way of illustration:    There is no opposition or contrast, in fact, between poetic mythology and religious philosophy. They are different methods of teaching religious truth, adapted to different stages of intellectual development. Myth is the poetic philosophy of a simple age, for whose ears the mystic truth must be sweetened by music, an age whose eyes cannot bear to gaze on the Divine splendour unveiled. Philosophic theology is for an age of rationalism and inquiry; it would have been unintelligible to the simple imaginative childhood of the race. Maximus [of Tyre] has the same faith as Plutarch that the mythopoeic age possessed, along with an enthralling artistic skill, all the speculative depth and subtlety of later ages. It is almost a profanity to imagine that Homer or Hesiod or Pindar were less of philosophers than Aristotle or Chrysippus. It was assumed that the early myth-makers and lawgivers possessed a sacred lore of immense value and undoubted truth, which they dimly shadowed forth in symbolism of fanciful tale or allegory. The myth at once hides and reveals the mystery of the Divine. If a man comes to its interpretation with the proper discipline and acumen, the kernel of spiritual or physical meaning which is reverently veiled from the profane eye will disclose itself. And thus the later philosophic theologian is not reading his own higher thoughts of God into the grotesque fancies of remote antiquity; he is evolving and interpreting a wisdom more original than his own. In this process of rediscovering a lost tradition, he pushes aside the mass of erroneous interpretations which have perverted the original doctrine, by literal acceptance of what is really figurative, by abuse of names and neglect of realities, by stopping at the symbol instead of rising to the divine fact."

I'm only up to page 444 in the chapter SUPERSTITION but already I know I'll be sad when I get to page 626 and the end! Thus far I have enjoyed the chapters on PLINY'S SOCIETY; MUNICIPAL LIFE; THE COLLEGES AND PLEBEIAN LIFE; THE PHILOSOPHIC DIRECTOR; THE PHILOSOPHIC MISSIONARY; and, THE PHILOSOPHIC THEOLOGIAN."
Stoicism,3duu6z,jimstride,2,Mon Jul 20 13:05:43 2015 UTC,"I just want to add to that by saying that reading and writing too are great ways of reminding oneself. Of course they always were. Yes, I think Socrates says precisely that somewhere or other too (is it towards the end of Plato's Phaedrus?)   Suffice to say, stop reading and you go stale. This applies to writing too. But reading for me is one of the great elixirs, a moral elixir. It is primarily through the activities of reading and writing that one is able to cure one's moral ills."
Stoicism,3duu6z,jimstride,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:18:35 2015 UTC,"Personally I think it's the diametric opposite, which is that reading and writing can be, like any other method, ways of distracting oneself, and hiding from the actual task of living. There's nothing to say that someone who has read and written a lot must be a good person."
Stoicism,3duu6z,paniniconqueso,4,Mon Jul 20 14:15:29 2015 UTC,"Reading and writing are activities almost entirely under our control.   Right from the beginning the Stoics were big readers and writers. They practised bibliotherapy and scribotherapy big time, ie., they engaged, almost exclusively, in these two activities. Zeno landed in a bookshop in the Piraeus after his ship capsised. What does that tell you? He would pay extortionate prices for the right books. Chrysippus wrote probably more than any other ancient philosopher. The emphasis in their philosophy is on the faculty of reason, or the logos. That is no accident. The reasoning faculty expresses itself through words and language, through reading and writing.   Name me one person who has not been improved through reading and or writing. Obviously it has to be the right stuff. If you read rubbish your mind will get cluttered up with same. But people who read a lot of philosophy and great literature are improved by what they read. And soon as they discover the power of the written word, which is infinitely more powerful than the sword, their improvement begins. One of our responsibilities in life is to ensure that everyone is taught how to read and write.   Edit: I put it to you that reading and writing ARE living where human beings are concerned. There is no human life outside the word. It is the word (the reasoning faculty) that distinguishes man from other animals."
Stoicism,3duu6z,jimstride,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:51:00 2015 UTC,"Right from the beginning the Stoics were big readers and writers.   Yes, and I'm saying they might have been wrong. We're talking about how the Stoics were not right all the other time, yes? Their relationship to the book (or more accurately, the scroll), or the later Christian fascination with the actual book and its technology of writing, does not actually lead necessarily to moral success or happiness. I'm not saying it didn't for some people, but it may not for others. Christians are the ones you really want to talk to about the love of the Word, they took it to its limit. But at the same time as I can appreciate someone like St. Augustine and his Confessions, I can also appreciate those who never wrote anything down, or who never read anything. I think there are many illiterate people who are far, far better people than Seneca or Marcus Aurelius or St. Augustine.   Name me one person who has not been improved through reading and or writing.   Me. I've read the Stoics in both Greek and Latin, I've read a bunch of philosophy, and still read a lot for pure enjoyment and a desire to 'improve oneself', and I write quite a lot, in a variety of languages...so I'm well aware of the seductive power of the word. My room is strewn with books and manuscripts and notes.  Personally I feel like your approach completely neglects the fact that language is fundamentally oral, not written. Marcus Aurelius' use of writing a diary or something like that for himself is something that is entirely contingent, a product of the kind of person he was and where he lived. It's not something to be valued as a universal therapeautic means.   Language is something that is intrinsic to us, but I feel it's mistaken to conflate that with its manifestations, in reading and writing. These are technologies, and like all technologies, they can be misused. In fact they draw us away from a more direct approach to life. Which can be good in some times, bad in others."

Stoicism,3dt6o1,cleomedes,7,Mon Jul 20 13:10:03 2015 UTC,"If find the lists of virtues, ancient (here, here) and modern (here, or questionnaires here or here) , useful for getting a feeling for what sorts of things to consider.   The Stoic belief about the relationship between emotion and beliefs about good and bad can be brought into play here. Most commonly in Stoic writing, the relationship is used to identify when you have a false belief about good and bad, when something external happens that causes an emotional reaction. The use can be inverted, though. Thing about what personality characteristics excite emotional reactions from you; these can help you determine which you, personally, find important.  Better than the questionnaires, therefore, I find thinking about people (real or fictional) doing things for which my reaction is ""wow, (s)he's awesome!"" or ""wow, (s)he's horrible!"". Think about the things people do that are particularly effective at exciting admiration or disgust. Instances of hypocrisy seem particularly effective. Paint a mental picture for yourself of someone who advocates industriousness, but never does any work. How do you react? Do to the same for other virtues in one ore another of the lists.   Either think of an example, or invent one, writing (or describing to yourself) specific incidents that illustrate the hypocrisy, and think about your emotional reaction. Better yet, imaging yourself doing those things. What is your reaction? Shame? Embarrassment? How strong? Does it matter to you if you ""get caught""? Edit: Rank ordering the different virtues based on your emotional reactions can be useful here. Don't limit yourself to the ""high level"" broad virtues, but the individual sub-virtues.  The issue of customizing the virtues you value to yourself is more modern than ancient (although it is hinted at in Cicero's On Duties), but one I have found valuable.  Edit 2: Personally, I was a bit surprised at myself sometimes, and it still isn't clear to me how to react to instances where my ""gut"" reaction differs from what, on an abstract intellectual level, I think my reactions should be.  Edit 3: The reason why you should consider whether it matters to you whether you ""get caught"" is that it helps disentangle whether you actually value it, or just fear possible consequences."

Bad, would be the opposite.   But to answer your question, I would say that there is nobody who can claim to be truly good, or bad. What is good and bad really? Let us focus on 'bad'. Is anyone truly bad or evil? Do villains exist? Are we so conceited that we think we figure so much in somebody's thoughts that they would have our harm in mind all the time? I believe that the nature of evil does not exist. There is no such thing as evil (I know, tall claim, but I am open to debate on this). There is no evil in this world, and everyone is just doing what he or she feels is best for them, trying to survive, trying to be happy. Nobody is bad, and consequently, nobody is good either."
Stoicism,3drlzw,mindsoul,8,Sat Jul 18 19:59:53 2015 UTC,"This is arguable. Stoicism was certainly not about having pleasant experiences, but to the Stoics, virtue and eudaimonia were not separable. ""Happiness"" does appear to be a misleading translation of ""eudaimonia"", but it isn't unrelated either.   The central point of the video, that our emotional experiences are reflections of our thoughts, is indeed part of Stoicism. The Stoics would also have agreed that thoughts and beliefs that lead to unhappiness (although not necessarily unpleasantness) are mistakes.  The difference lies in why they are mistakes. The video indicates that thoughts that lead to unhappiness should be avoided because they lead to unhappiness, while the classical Stoic view seemed to be more that they indicate an incorrect understanding of good and bad. Correct views of good and bad never lead to unhappiness, according to the Stoics. I don't remember the Greek terms, but I remember a translation of the distinction along the lines of ""a sage will experience pain, but not distress."" If this seems contradictory, consider the emotional state and physical sensations of a marathon runner who has just won a marathon, after pushing himself to exhaustion.   To be fair, this distinction (edit: in why these judgements are mistakes) often tends to be blurred by Epictetus in particular.   Edit: Put a bit differently, I think the Stoic attitude was that distress is related to moral illness in the same way that pain is related to physical injury and illness. In both cases, your goal should health (moral in one case, physical in the other) rather than just the elimination of one symptom. A ""feeling"" or ""impression"" (emotion without assent) might be analogous to physical discomfort that isn't an actual injury. You might feel pain from a pin bring pressed against your skin, even if it doesn't penetrate it. This pain might be analogous to an ""impression"". ""Assent"" to an impression that something other than vice is bad is analogous to the pin actually puncturing your skin, causing an injury."

I tend to find that the more you tell yourself ""positive"" things to  change your negative emotion of the event to good one (so you can deal with it) you're setting yourself up for failure. You are still in submission of your feelings. Leave the emotions aside.

Stoicism,3ds16c,Latinenthusiast,5,Sat Jul 18 22:16:47 2015 UTC,"I have since found some problems with Aristotle's philosophy. For example, Aristotle's assertion that virtue is not necessary and sufficient for eudemonia.   This was, indeed, one of the primary disagreements between the Stoics and the Aristotle.   Classical Stoicism was indeed a virtue ethics. Teleology and pantheism were indeed important elements of Stoicism as well, but if you look at the theoretical basis the Stoics presented (see oikeiosis), their theological views don't seem to have played a significant role as a justification for their ethics.  If you are interested in a basis for ethics that is inspired by ancient Stoicism, but fully informed by modern context and by an expert in modern academic ethical philosophy, I recommend Lawrence Becker's A New Stoicism. Given your background and inclinations (atheistic, virtue ethics), I strongly recommend this book.   Unlike some of the more ""practical"" books that present modern adaptations of Stoicism, Becker does a very nice job of making clear where the differences between his ""New Stoicism"" and classical Stoicism are. Indeed, a significant fraction of the book is notes comparing his own view with the classical Stoic one, and I have found his descriptions there some of the clearest explanations of not just his philosophy, but how the theoretical basis for classical Stoicism might have worked.   What Becker arrives at remains, I think, a virtue ethics, although I don't know enough about other instances of modern theories of virtue ethics to comment on how typical it is of them."
Stoicism,3ds16c,cleomedes,4,Sun Jul 19 03:24:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you I will definitely check it out!  Is Lawrence Becker's approach strictly atheistic in nature? The only reason why I am asking is because I am not strictly atheistic in nature. I am not a Christian philosopher but I do like a lot of the work of Descartes, Leibniz, and Plato.   I think we can ground ethics in human interests without relying on Gods while still thinking that god/s exist for other rational reasons."
Stoicism,3ds16c,cleomedes,3,Sun Jul 19 17:21:58 2015 UTC,"Becker seems to be completely atheist, but I don't see anything in his ethics that actually contradicts theism either, although it would be unusually disconnected from theism if adopted by a theist.

You need to have more realistic expectations about how people will act. They will betray you and sting you. You will be hurt by it (a brief impression)  But, you must realize that the only reason people act this way is because they don't know how to act good. It hasn't been trained into them.

It is like the training of an animal: ""If in the course of trying to train a horse, we punish him, it should because we ant him to obey us in the future, not because we are angry about his failure to obey us in the past""  Seneca realized there are situations when it is appropriate to respond to the misconduct of others by feigning anger. So long as you do not actually let it make you angry, it is okay to pretend to be angry, if that is the only way to correct a person's behavior. So long as you do not actually become just as depraved and selfish, it is okay to make calculated mimicries of this, because sometimes that is the only language some people understand. But always remember that you are not really going down to their level. Seneca would advise you, as always, to use caution and restraint. Do not react rashly; plan.

For instance, I came to know Stoicism because I followed a blog that talked about it, because I wanted to improve my financial situation, because I was having a child, because my wife and I dearly wanted one, because we've been together for 15 years now and love eachother, because I met her online on a long-gone chat forum one and a half decade ago, because I had a sense of humor she really liked, because I was lucky enough to inherit my wits from my mother.  So who should I thank for finding Stoicism? Myself? The blog owner? My financial situation? My child? My wife? My mother? In reality, finding Stoicism was a happy coincidence I think. It's probably due to all of the above that I now follow my interpretation of the philosophy, in any case it certainly wasn't something I did on my own. Had any of the things not happened, I could have been a cynic, dead, a marathon runner, or a deep-sea fisherman without arms, who knows?

They may be lonely, some may just have a need to constantly reach out, and surely there are other reasons.   They're usually not looking for help, and most would get offended if you told them something like ""Well you're causing your own problems, and you could do X to deal with it"".   It's not our duty to help others or fix the world. Feeling that you've ""found the truth"" leads to this kind of thing. What works for you isn't going to work for everyone.

I need to focus on not just accepting that I don't control my environment, but that I don't control, can't change, and shouldn't want to change people."
Stoicism,3dpine,dmedlock4rc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:18:14 2015 UTC,"I'd say this is in and of itself an emotional response. But that is obvious. However before you attempt or unknowingly judge someone think about the following. Has the person ever been introduced to such a philosophy? If not, it is reasonable to expect them to act in a way that does not reflect such a philosophy. Or perhaps they have been introduced but not in the proper setting for discussion and reflection. Even then if they are interested, whose to say that they are indeed in the same state of mind that you were in and therefore the introduction would not have influenced them as it did you.   You see everyone is fighting their own demons and struggling down their own roads. What they do reflects upon their own experiences and influences and since their experiences and influences have been different from your own, it is not reasonable to judge someone at all. In fact it is only logical to lightly show them the right way, preferably without lecturing and more of leading by example. When discussion does occur around the subject of Stoicism or anything related, be gentle and patient. Monitor their reactions so you do not overreach yourself and annoy them, else the seeds you plant will not grow. Just like a plant, learning takes time and needs to be properly attended to. There is no need to rush a lifelong lesson."
Stoicism,3dpine,johnnyfitbaw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:58:10 2015 UTC,"I feel superior to people who don't follow this philosophy and I feel guilty for it. Not that I go around letting people know, but whenever I come across a person with no self discipline and who run their lives carelessly and based off what feels good, I look down on them. I feel like a horrible person.   If you yourself live up to 'this philosophy' then you (most certainly) are a superior person. But don't kid yourself, for in truth there are few if any who are able to discipline themselves, and live truly virtuous lives. But if you are one of them I congratulate you.   What does it say in the book of the Christians?   Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.   as well as:   Judge not, that ye be not judged.   Edit: Epictetus, 1. xvii. 17-18:   there is no just place for pride even on the part of Chrysippus, if he merely interprets the will of nature, but himself does not follow it"
Stoicism,3dpine,shahgaltaligu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:48:49 2015 UTC,"Epictetus tells an anecdote in Chapter 2 of the Discourses in which Aggripinus flat out asserts his superiority over a friend. The friend doesn't want to attend one of Nero's grotesques but fears the consequences. ""Well then,"" says Aggripinus, ""it was fitting for you to take care how you should be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no design to be anything superior to the other threads. But I wish to be purple, that small part which is bright, and makes all the rest appear graceful and beautiful. Why then do you tell me to make myself like the many? and if I do, how shall I still be purple?""  If you are the purple thread you will regularly run into the brown threads. Those threads, though, are your brothers and sisters, and if they err it is because, as Aurelius said, they lack knowledge of the good. They haven't embraced reason in the way you have.  There are perhaps two impressions that you have assented to. First, that less developed people are distasteful. They repel you. Second, that you are bad for finding them distasteful. I've actually experienced this myself. Here's how I deal with it:  I would not assent to either of those impressions. Instead I would say that you are improving yourself in a way that most people don't, so it's only natural that you are surrounded by less developed people. Those people are, however, your fellow humans and you were made to live in community with them. Perhaps you can help them. You can certainly love them. You should, in fact.   We're all little parts of the same universe after all. We ARE them.   Posting this is a gutsy move and does credit to your study of Stoicism. I don't see this as the dreaded ""humble brag."" You don't want to look down on people and you would like to get some advice from the rest of us to help you improve. That's admirable."
Stoicism,3dpine,johnnyfitbaw,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:19:54 2015 UTC,"Why can't one be proud occasionally? Why can't you enjoy feeling like a worthwhile member of the human race? It's like you can't feel good about having made a good stoic choice, despite the fact that this is the whole point of stoicism.  OP, here's my take (not that I should be giving advice). You have an ego. It is not the most important thing in the world to you, so don't fight it. Don't devote your energy to it one way or another. What I tell myself is that it's ok to feel pride, as I know I'm a good person. But part of that is knowing that I wouldn't let pride get in the way of doing the honourable thing (helping others, not being a jerk)."

Stoicism,3dkql0,DJ_RP,5,Fri Jul 17 01:40:54 2015 UTC,"Great post. I think what's truly valuable about the stoic approach is how it made a better life more accessible.  What I mean by this is that it provided a simple and relatable outlook to help shape how people should think and act regarding complex behaviour like playing the role of the victim.   I read a relevant article (completely unrelated to stoicism) that illustrates a modern psychological outlook on this topic (see here http://www.angriesout.com/grown20.htm). To me the stoic view is a means to help people stand outside the emotions and thinking patterns of the roles described in the article without getting into technicalities.  Granted, modern understanding is more studied and complete of the subject overall, but how does the wisdom get transcribed for the common men and women in the world? We seem to have lost this accessibility and there is no convenient vehicle to deliver this understanding any longer, other than through a costly process of counselling and therapy."
Stoicism,3dkql0,Simpsonite,4,Fri Jul 17 06:09:09 2015 UTC,I disagree with your last sentence I think there is a way to understand it without therapy or counselling but it requires work on the end of the individual. Or requires self analyzation skills that people don't develop or choose to ignore.   I do agree with your thoughts about the stoic view and the article. It is almost showing you the game that is being played and then shows you that you have an option not to play the game
Stoicism,3dkql0,ostiedetabarnac,3,Fri Jul 17 12:21:25 2015 UTC,"That's the thing isn't it: the skills aren't just disseminated with schools of thought like they were with stoicism, now the individual must seek them out."
Stoicism,3dkql0,Simpsonite,3,Fri Jul 17 13:22:57 2015 UTC,Yes I think that's part of the problem; too many voices offering too many solutions on leading a life of contentedness. It's not the nature of a Stoic point of view to 'market the brand' so to speak compared to some religions for example.
Stoicism,3dkql0,sortefugl,6,Fri Jul 17 17:00:18 2015 UTC,"It's a good write-up. The last part really resonated with me:   Do not think how unlucky of me for these events to have occurred, but rather, how lucky of me to have survived these events unharmed, Will unbroken, with the ability to recover, and adapt to the current situation. Not only will you feel weight lifted off of your shoulders if you practice this but you will see a boost in those around you.   It occurs to me that some of the happiest people I've met, were also among the most unfortunate in terms of the difficulties they faced in life. I think it's because stress forces you to either become stronger or break, wether it's physical or mental stress. And just knowing that the difficulties we encounter will make us stronger, can be a valuable asset. While it may seem morbid, even the greatest disasters can be a blessing in disguise. Because when we encounter lesser disasters, we can remind ourselves that we have gone through worse. If you have seen all of your family die in a fire, and your mental balance is intact, what else can life really throw at you?"

Stoicism,3dk55v,ReefaManiack42o,3,Thu Jul 16 23:11:37 2015 UTC,"Even in that particular example. Let's say you didn't relieve that stress. And so you have more tension, cortisol, adrenaline and generally just a bad chemical cocktail building up inside of you.   This could manifest itself in more negative emotion and a general lack of focus in various areas of your life that otherwise you wouldn't have had if you managed your stress correctly.   Think about the butterfly effect. Even the smallest and seemingly inconsequential actions in the moment can have a huge impact on a longer timeline. Think about a decision you made regarding a path you made in life. Your life could've been vastly different given one option over the other.  Positive and high vibration activities attract and produce more of that and vice versa with the negativity. Micro scale actions literally make up macro scale results."
Stoicism,3dk55v,bebestman,5,Thu Jul 16 23:25:54 2015 UTC,"Well, take your example, if meditation is good for the individual, then those benefits will diffuse into society. Increased mood can help increase others moods, increased physique will increase performance in whatever other work one does for society, never mind the idea of leading by example.   No man is an island,  Entire of itself.  Each is a piece of the continent,  A part of the main.  If a clod be washed away by the sea,  Europe is the less.  As well as if a promontory were.  As well as if a manor of thine own  Or of thine friend's were.  Each man's death diminishes me,  For I am involved in mankind.

Stoicism,3dk55v,graematicus,8,Thu Jul 16 22:50:51 2015 UTC,"You might have lost a nuance of this quote in your conclusion: Aurelius effectively states that there is no difference between ""good for the bees"" and ""good for the beehive"", as a detriment to the one implies detriment to the other. Or more concretely, something that harms society as a whole harms the person themselves, even if on the face of it it seem beneficial for the individual.  In your case it then the contra-positive applies that what is good for the individual is good for the society, even if on the face of it only the individual is helped. This can come in the form of better externalities - less litter, no smelly socks, better looking houses - or more opportunities for others - a better education as a physician, more capital goods. Essentially, there is no purely selfish act.  Or another way to read it is to say that no act is beneficial for the individual if it is not done for the greater good. I think there is no easy way to distinguish between those two readings, at least not at first sight."
Stoicism,3dk55v,Astartes_Pius,3,Thu Jul 16 23:28:57 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this.

Stoicism,3dkeao,UnlimitedRed,10,Fri Jul 17 07:08:59 2015 UTC,"It varies.  We recently lost our son (June 22). He was born too early, and he survived for 47 minutes in our arms. It was a difficult first week with the funeral service, and the sense of loss and sorrow. But the medical professionals who spoke to us, said that we showed a lot of optimism, openness, and that we didn't appear traumatized or beside ourselves like you would expect. The mortician also seemed surprised that we were doing as well as we were under the circumstances, and commented on it twice.  I think they saw that as a strength, and didn't judge us for letting go so fast. But we felt for quite a long time that we had to put on a mask of sorrow when we went outside. The memories we had while carrying our child were good ones. He wouldn't have wanted us to mourn for weeks, so we didn't. We would sing, carry on with our hobbies, watch movies, and just let the day-to-day continue like it always had. In the first 5 days or so, that was difficult, but it didn't take long to feel happy again. When we met friends and family however, they could barely look us in the eye, and we had to appear more sad than we truly were. And we had to comfort them, because my mother and my wife's mother didn't take it well either.  I called my brother and spoke to him on the day of the funeral service. I made the mistake of telling him that we were on our way into the city, to walk around and enjoy the sun. I know him well. Although he didn't say anything, I think he resented us and thought it a bit respectless. To us it was the highest sign of respect: Our son gave us so many beautiful memories together, in the short time he could stay. The best way to honor that memory and those great times is to make them live on.  So we did and we do. I'll appear sad in front of people who expect me to, or who needs the comfort (My wife, mother, my mother in law). But I moved on on the day of the funeral service, and haven't really felt sad since."

Especially with this being r/Stoicism. Practicing stoics generally regard things out of their control indifferently (or at least we're supposed to, it would be really difficult if were your own son). Also he did have emotions about it. He said he in the first and second lines that had a difficult time and a sense of loss and sorrow. Two very appropriate feelings that you said he didn't have.

Stoicism,3dkeao,jimstride,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:17:09 2015 UTC,"Well, you're entitled to your opinion but it doesn't alter the fact that he came across as a callous cold-hearted bastard.   Firstly, he didn't carry the child around for six months, his wife did. So what right does that give him to speak for her??? What were her feelings? That's what I want to know. And then we discover that they were quite different from his own for he says that he will    appear sad in front of people who expect me to, or who needs the comfort (My wife, mother, my mother in law).   How patronising of him! Are women somehow less than men? Did not Seneca and Musonius and others argue that women were men's equals when it came to philosophy?    But I moved on on the day of the funeral service, and haven't really felt sad since.   That is not normal. And it certainly isn't Stoical. I already mentioned how Epictetus took in a new born child that was about to be exposed. But also he speaks of getting down on his hands and knees and playing with children and of greeting them with cries of Happy Saturnalia! And he also speaks of sympathising with the bereaved. And there is the story of the man who ran away because he could not bear seeing his child ill and Epictetus tells him that that was not the right hing to do. That if everybody simply ran away and abandoned their sick children society would fall apart. That anyone who felt anything for the child would be there for that child. These examples show that the philosopher, the man who tries to put Stoic principles into practise, and who invariably fails, is a person full of the tenderest feelings.   And then there is Seneca who was cut up with the loss of loved ones. And do you think Marcus Aurelius felt no sadness at the loss of so many of his children in childbirth?  The poster speaks of ""medical professionals"" who remarked on the fact the ""we""    didn't appear traumatized or beside ourselves like you would expect.    The mortician too   seemed surprised that we were doing as well as we were under the circumstances,    Tragic circumstances   and commented on it twice.    That's not surprising.   I think they saw that as a strength,    No one can know whether they ""saw that as a strength"".   and didn't judge us for letting go so fast.    Maybe they did; maybe they too were playing the unphilosophical game of masking their true feelings.     The memories we had while carrying our child were good ones.    ""we""??? The woman carries the child!  And so the post goes on:   He wouldn't have wanted us to mourn for weeks, so we didn't.   Of course he wouldn't have wanted anyone to mourn but he'd have been gobsmacked had no one done so. Stoicism is not about pretty sayings. One has to get the balance right.   We would sing, carry on with our hobbies, watch movies, and just let the day-to-day continue like it always had. In the first 5 days or so, that was difficult, but it didn't take long to feel happy again.    Again it's all about what he merely thinks. Nowhere is the story of the agony and hurt of his wife told.   When we met friends and family however, they could barely look us in the eye, and we had to appear more sad than we truly were.   I find this sickening to read.   And we had to comfort them, because my mother and my wife's mother didn't take it well either.   Sounds like his wife, his mother, and his mother in law were the real Stoics here. But actually none of these beings is ""his"" to call his own. No doubt if he could get over the death of his child so quickly he could quickly get over the death of his wife and mother etc., too.    I called my brother and spoke to him on the day of the funeral service. I made the mistake of telling him that we were on our way into the city, to walk around and enjoy the sun. I know him well. Although he didn't say anything, I think he resented us and thought it a bit respectless.    The brother was right, it was respectless.   To us it was the highest sign of respect: Our son gave us so many beautiful memories together, in the short time he could stay.   No, no! To the poster it may have appeared to be ""the highest sign of respect"" but what about to his wife?   The best way to honor that memory and those great times is to make them live on.   Sounds like ""the show must go on"".  The post, as I said, read very badly. I'm sorry that you and all those who have given me the thumbs down in this virtual arena aren't able to see that."
Stoicism,3dkeao,sortefugl,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:27:40 2015 UTC,"As you said by the end of your post, you are the only one who reacted this strongly to my wording. Why? Am I threatening your sense of expertise in my Stoicism? Do you suspect that I am in fact a sociopath, or someone who romanticizes sociopaths?  In any case, I am happy to talk about how I feel about this matter. There are no questions that are taboo, or out of line, or too personal. My wife and I both went through hell. Soon after the birth, my wife was hit by a car. It was during my exam period. My father was sick.  I was incredibly fortunate to start reading about Stoicism just before all of those challenges.  Here is my post on predaddit when we decided to terminate the pregnancy: https://www.reddit.com/r/predaddit/comments/3aakqz/i_guess_it_was_not_meant_to_be/  I posted about it before on this subreddit here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/3aieq3/how_has_stoicism_changed_you/csd03xc  And here, where I felt absolutely destroyed: https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/3aieq3/how_has_stoicism_changed_you/csg6gyd  Even so, maybe the coldness you percieve in me is true, and the result of a coping mechanism. Could that be likely too?  Do you truly want to know how my wife feels? In the week our sons death, she wouldn't touch cold meat from the supermarket fridge, because it reminded her of our son. It felt like the body that was stored in the morgue. She was so attached to his dead body, that when she kissed his forehead goodbye, she wouldn't wash her lips for days. She couldn't stop crying, and wanted to nurse and hug everything in sight, because no mother's instinct allows a woman to leave her child, even in death. She confessed to me, that had she been allowed by the health professionals, she would have dragged my sons dead corpse along for weeks, nursing it, until it felt apart from rot. I held her for hours upon hours, and she held me without sleep. By the first night she was practically wailing. She felt an intense, almost inhuman guilt, that I feared would bring her to the brink of insanity - a guilt because during our sons few living moments, she had a hard time recognizing him as her own, and felt she hadn't shown him enough love. She blamed herself. I thought for a moment she would never be sane again, because she felt haunted by a face that she loved so dearly, but just couldn't bear to witness knowing that it would never grow old. I showed her pictures of him, because even though it appeared to make it so much worse in terms of grief, it was also the only thing that calmed her down. Yes, I may have been wrong. Maybe she was out of her mind. Maybe I was too. The second night wasn't any better, she thought she was going crazy. I had to keep reminding her she was just tired, using all the tricks I knew to keep her calm from meditation, yoga, stretches, to all I have ever read about psychological techniques.  Is that the truth you want to hear? How am I supposed to deal with that /u/jimstride ? How would you? What would you do? I felt like I had to block away all my feelings at that point, it was the only way I could help her and myself. Do you trust that when I say we were doing good, I mean relatively speaking? I felt like I just had to endure. I felt like I had to help her endure by any means possible.  I struggled with my own demons, but they had to wait. I wasn't prepared for two things: Being a father, and how much you love your son unconditionally (That made the loss very difficult). I wasn't prepared for the birth either, and how much I would feel her pain. After being awake for hours and hours in constant anxiety, I tried calming myself down by opening Reddit - while she was passed out from exhaustion. My son was born and died on July 22, Father's day. Reddit was full of Father's Day related posts. I sat there, alone, in a room beside my wife who was passed out from pain, giving birth to our soon-to-die first-born son, reading father's day posts. Do I have to impress upon you how I felt? But I had to be awake, I had to be calm and clear-headed for her. For him.  I remember sitting beside her as she was breathing heavily, and I was breathing rhythmically along. She thought I was breathing to guide her. In reality, I was also breathing to hold back my own intense anxiety. When I met my son, I sung for him. I broke down several times in front of the staff. I have never, in my adult life, cried as hard as I did then. I wanted him to know that I was proud of him. I wanted to show him the world. But I can't. I never will be able to. Do you think realizing that was easy?  My feelings are there, /u/jimstride. I can talk about them. But few want to hear them."

In the week our sons death, she wouldn't touch cold meat from the supermarket fridge, because it reminded her of our son. It felt like the body that was stored in the morgue. She was so attached to his dead body, that when she kissed his forehead goodbye, she wouldn't wash her lips for days. She couldn't stop crying, and wanted to nurse and hug everything in sight, because no mother's instinct allows a woman to leave her child, even in death. She confessed to me, that had she been allowed by the health professionals, she would have dragged my sons dead corpse along for weeks, nursing it, until it felt apart from rot. I held her for hours upon hours, and she held me without sleep. By the first night she was practically wailing. She felt an intense, almost inhuman guilt, that I feared would bring her to the brink of insanity - a guilt because during our sons few living moments, she had a hard time recognizing him as her own, and felt she hadn't shown him enough love. She blamed herself. I thought for a moment she would never be sane again, because she felt haunted by a face that she loved so dearly, but just couldn't bear to witness knowing that it would never grow old. I showed her pictures of him, because even though it appeared to make it so much worse in terms of grief, it was also the only thing that calmed her down. Yes, I may have been wrong. Maybe she was out of her mind. Maybe I was too. The second night wasn't any better, she thought she was going crazy. I had to keep reminding her she was just tired, using all the tricks I knew to keep her calm from meditation, yoga, stretches, to all I have ever read about psychological techniques.  Is that the truth you want to hear?    Anything I say after that pales into insignificance. Clearly you both did your best under some of the most trying circumstances imaginable.

Why do any children have to die? Had it at least served a purpose I would have felt some comfort, but it was just a cosmic and tragic coincidence. It was a highly unlikely occurence, and it had no more purpose than the toss of a coin. It was so meaningless.  I remember suddently feeling intense anger and frustration. If I believed in God, I would have been angry at him for taking my boy away. I felt an urge to ram my fist into the laundry machine with all my force, and break the glass. But just like I chose not to cry, because it wouldn't help my situation, I chose not to be angry. I kept the anger in check, and decided that since the universe was indifferent, and there was no meaning behind what happened I had to find my own meaning.

As Robert Greene points out in Mastery (not a stoic book at all, but still a great book on flow): once you have created the habit yourself through repetition, the body can take over and you enter flow. This is when you dont have to think about about a set of actions anymore. The same can be achieved through intense concentration.

If you need to get through a fairly boring task or study for some skill, having music with no words is one of the best ways to drown out distracting white-noise-type thoughts and think clearly about the task at hand. At least for me.  The other thing is that you keep mentioning ""flow"" and so I think you might be familiar with Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi?  His main point is fairly simple, the right conditions for entering a state of flow are to have the correct combination of competency and challenge. Namely, your competency should be slightly below the level of challenge of the task at hand.  This diagram sums it up pretty clearly."

Stoicism,3deegd,ProfDuude,2,Thu Jul 16 13:00:52 2015 UTC,"So glad you brought up FLOW and Mihaly, it's all I kept thinking as I read through this thread. He's definitely worth checking out IMO. Very much a Stoic thinker, here's one of my favorite quotes by him:  “How we feel about ourselves, the joy we get from living, ultimately depend directly on how the mind filters and interprets everyday experiences. Whether we are happy depends on inner harmony, not on the controls we are able to exert over the great forces of the universe. Certainly we should keep on learning how to master the external environment, because our physical survival may depend on it. But such mastery is not going to add one jot to how good we as individuals feel, or reduce the chaos of the world as we experience it. To do that we must learn to achieve mastery over consciousness itself.” — Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience  I wrote about FLOW on my site here (http://thinkrighteatwell.com/clear-your-head/) , There's a similar flow diagram on that page as well as Mihaly's TED talk which is really good.  I also find Sam Harris's guided meditations to be helpful."

I haven't been that interested in Harris' work since ""The Moral Landscape"" to be honest, thought that was a very long book just to make a very simple metaphor.

Most people have the issue with the internal drive part. In this case, I think the quote is wrong and that emotions are absolutely necessary and useful to achieving flow. I always feel a little frustrated while going, then elated when I see progress, and then a little proud when I'm done. I won't lie, part of the way I get in the state is that I want to prove I'm better than others and then I push myself to prove it.   The flow itself consists of always moving forward and having this momentum where you keep making progress without second guessing yourself. You write without editing, and you create without reconsidering. This doesn't mean it's perfect though, just that you don't stop the momentum to take a step back.   For example, I could be writing an email and I could be worried about how exactly I address the recipient and what my word choice is, and am i grammatically correct, and is the email clear. Or, I could write it as best as possible in a few minutes, take a quick look over it, and move on."

I'd actually disagree with this claim. Evincing competence and taking risks and getting lucky are more critical to outstanding success.   Many, many successful people are disorganized and survive only with the persistent aid of an executive assistant. It's not that they lack skills—but many do lack the ability to 'monotask' for hours at a time. Larry Page is an excellent example: habitually messy, but a creative and insightful thinker.   Success aside, if you want to improve your ability to stick with habits, try reading 'The Power of Habit' by Duhigg.

My first gig out of college was driving a millionaire angel investor to and from work. He paid me $500/week for about 15 hrs on the road.

Edit: I would also advise AGAINST buying or reading the entire book. I read it. It's extremely repetitive. Find a summary of it online. If it's surprisingly short, it's because the book is surprisingly repetitive. The message is ""cue --> routine --> reward."" Every habit has a cue. You need to change the routine. Keep the reward the same. Here's a book review. Here's a summary.   And to answer your initial question, I've done some research of my own. When I intend to get into a flow state, I have a ritual. I put on my headphones, select my music (usually some sort of jazz or classical), I set up my phone with my pomodoro, and I flow. I believe the ritual triggers my mind to enter a flow state. You can make up your own ritual. Some people tie their ritual to scent. They spray a fragrance or light a scented candle.   Another thing that helped facilitate entering into a flow state is meditation. After doing research, I've come to the conclusion that no real discernible difference exists between the types of meditation (mindfulness, transcendental, etc.). Just choose a style and go.

The ancients saw extreme emotion as something like a sickness so of course they sought to calm the passions. The modern meaning of passion is more like a high enjoyment. To understand the difference, contrast joyfulness with mania: The latter is a passion in the ancient sense while the former is not.  Not sure where you get your emotionlessness from. In general it is a very modern idea, more specifically from Romanticism, that emotions are good in themselves and are something higher than rationality. In antiquity, at least the way I read it, emotion and rationality complement each other."

What the Stoics tried to avoid, sometimes translated as ""emotions"" and sometimes as ""passions"", really doesn't line up with either exactly; all of the different possible English translations give the wrong impression, in one way or another.  The simplest way of getting across what I think they meant is to look at the two primary assertions they made about ""passions"":   They are caused by mistaken value judgements, incorrect beliefs about what is good or bad. They are strong enough to cause you to act against your best judgement.    With regards to the second, the emotion doesn't have to actually cause you to act against you best judgement at the moment, it just has to be strong enough that, if they were to conflict, the emotional reaction would overcome your self-control.  If seems to me self-evident that emotions with these properties should be avoided, although in the first case it is the cause that should be avoided, the passion merely being the symptom."

In stoicism, the only good is virtue (moral wisdom) and the only evil is vice (moral ignorance).  The eupathe are: Wishing (the desire to do virtue in the future), Caution (the aversion to being vicious in the future) and Joy (the experience of being virtuous in the present moment).  Impressions, which can take the form of sensory input, automatic thoughts and automatic feelings (emotions), cannot be avoided.

From Stoic Living for the Modern Soul http://www.amazon.com/Stoic-Living-Modern-Dmitri-Mandaliev/dp/1496191242/   I put it to you that a stoic has feelings and is in touch with them perhaps more than most people. This is so because the stoic confronts and accepts their reality in as fearless a way as is possible. And when the stoic fails, they do not wail and bemoan their error. The stoic picks himself up off the ground and marches forward, acknowledging the error as well as the fact that he is human.   Does your child or spouse die? Do you really believe you could have no feelings of pain or remorse for such a thing? If you fight your feelings and suppress them they will rule over you. Emotions will have their day, it is just a matter of time. However, they do not need overrun you. A stoic will sit with these feelings, allow them to sink in and not struggle with them. This is a painful experience. Yet from this pain comes strength, resilience, and ultimately self-control"

And you're absolutely right. Apathy isn't the death or repression of emotions: it's the ability to rise above them, to distance yourself from them and thus rob them of their power. See passions and toxic emotions need a consenting host to survive. When you step away from them and refuse to consent they quickly run out of fuel, fizzle out and die. The more often you succeed in doing this the weaker your passions and toxic emotions get, the easier it is to rise above them.  The Stoics used a number of tricks to get this done. I've also found a few good ones in Eckhart Tolle's books. One that I use consistently is to observe myself getting angry/bitter/cynical/jealous etc. Observation creates separation. I believe they call it Cognitive Distancing in CBT and it works well for me.   The hard part is breaking old habits and establishing new ones."

Stoicism,3d7wkl,minustwofish,2,Tue Jul 14 06:13:20 2015 UTC,"In particular, I suggest looking at some of the sources listed in this question. The Stoic Week booklets are free online and a good place to start. If these work for you, the books by Donald Robertson are closely related (Robertson being heavily involved in Stoic Week), but go into greater depth.  If you don't like the Stoic Week material, and perhaps want something with less modern influence, the Holowchak or Buzare might be worth trying.   My personal advice is to spend a little time experimenting with different exercises, for example by following a Stoic Week, and then pick one or two exercises to try to establish as a habit, to really focus on solidly integrating into your life. At least for myself, trying to maintain too many chages in habit at once is a recipe for failure."

Being worried about ""thinking incorrectly"" only leads to further anxiety. Recognition is the first step to internalization but even the noblest among us are not free from malign thoughts, it's what we do with them that is important."

It's really just about seeing through the general bullshit that most people spend their lives worrying over. It's the kind of essay that would be great to read with a teenager so you could answer any questions they have. But I think they could relate with it.   Can anything be more idiotic than certain people who boast of their foresight? They keep themselves officiously preoccupied in order to improve their lives; they spend their lives in organizing their lives. They direct their purposes with an eye to a distant future. But putting things off is the biggest waste of life: it snatches away each day as it comes, and denies us the present by promising the future. The greatest obstacle to living is expectancy, which hangs upon tomorrow and loses today. You are arranging what lies in Fortune’s control, and abandoning what lies in yours. What are you looking at? To what goal are you straining? The whole future lies in uncertainty: live immediately.      We are in the habit of saying that it was not in our power to choose the parents who were allotted to us, that they were given to us by chance. But we can choose whose children we would like to be. There are households of the noblest intellects: choose the one into which you wish to be adopted, and you will inherit not only their name but their property too. Nor will this property need to be guarded meanly or grudgingly: the more it is shared out, the greater it will become."
Stoicism,3d65da,jgi,2,Tue Jul 14 01:25:02 2015 UTC,"One of the lighter books on stoicism that I've read is called Stoic Living for the Modern Soul. It is only 62 pages long. It doesn't focus on any of the boring history of stoicism or the the physics or how any of it should work in theory. It's just practical advice from a modern stoic written in plain english. http://www.amazon.com/Stoic-Living-Modern-Dmitri-Mandaliev/dp/1496191242/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1436870260&sr=8-2&keywords=Modern+Stoicism+Living  Another light book that I found helpful was The Art of Living. http://www.amazon.com/Art-Living-Classical-Happiness-Effectiveness/dp/0061286052/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1436870442&sr=8-1&keywords=the+art+of+living This book is sometimes criticized because it is a paraphrase rather than a translation of the Enchiridion. But there is no doubt that it is very light reading and doesn't focus on any of the history of stoicism or the theories either. Just practical advice albeit with some amenities, but I really enjoyed it. If you wanted a really casual, light inspirational read, then this is probably a good choice.  Meditations by Marcus Aurellius by Gregory Hays isn't really as much light reading as the two aforementioned books, but it's a really great intro for beginners into meditations as it's written in plainer english than most other translations.  There are books that are highly recommended on here like Stoicism and the Art of Happiness, but personally I've found the book too dull and boring. It might be because I've already gone through the author's Modern Stoicism course but I just haven't been able to get through it. Also, the history of stoicism is a lot less important to me than practical advice of applying it in a modern world, so when the author goes through so much detail of talking about the history of it, it turns me off a bit."

As for Epictetus, he probably did develop his lessons logically, but that is not reflected in the notes that his student took - and that is all we have.

Stoicism,3d5nlf,Klapra,11,Mon Jul 13 20:16:26 2015 UTC,"Philosophical ideas of stoicism, converted in many ways to fuel good - willing philosophical thoughts in our modern society with the struggles we may have today. This is for me, and anyone willing, to save and read when in need of calming ones mind. To let a stoic way of thinking relieve me from stress and struggles, and lead me to live a more fulfilling life.   Acknowledge that all emotions come from within.   “Today I escaped anxiety. Or no, I discarded it, because it was within me, in my own perceptions, not outside.” — Marcus Aurelius   Find someone you respect, and use them to stay honest.   “Choose someone whose way of life as well as words, and whose very face as mirroring the character that lies behind it, have won your approval. Be always pointing him out to yourself either as your guardian or as your model. This is a need, in my view, for someone as a standard against which our characters can measure themselves. Without a ruler to do it against you won’t make the crooked straight.” — Seneca   Recognize there is life after failure.   “Does what’s happened keep you from acting with justice, generosity, self-control, sanity, prudence, honesty, humility, straightforwardness, and all other qualities that allow a person’s nature to fulfill itself? So remember this principle when something threatens to cause you pain: the thing itself was no misfortune at all; to endure it and prevail is great good fortune.” — Marcus Aurelius   Read purposefully, and apply your knowledge.   “Don’t just say you have read books. Show that through them you have learned to think better, to be a more discriminating and reflective person. Books are the training weights of the mind. They are very helpful, but it would be a bad mistake to suppose that one has made progress simply by having internalized their contents.” — Epictetus   Challenge yourself to be brutally honest.   “‘A consciousness of wrongdoing is the first step to salvation.’ This remark of Epicurus’ is to me a very good one. For a person who is not aware that he is doing anything wrong has no desire to be put right. You have to catch yourself doing it before you can reform. Some people boast about their failings: can you imagine someone who counts his faults as merits ever giving thought to their cure? So, to the best of your ability, demonstrate your own guilt, conduct inquiries of your own into all the evidence against yourself. Play the first part of prosecutor, then of judge and finally of pleader in mitigation. Be harsh with yourself at times.” — Seneca   Reflect on what you spend the most time on.   “A key point to bear in mind: The value of attentiveness varies in proportion to its object. You’re better off not giving the small things more time than they deserve.” — Marcus Aurelius   Remind yourself: you weren’t meant to procrastinate.   ""Concentrate every minute on doing what's in front of you with precise and genuine seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with justice. And on freeing yourself from all other distractions. Yes, you can, if you do everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions override what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical, self-centered, irritable. You see how few things you have to do to live a satisfying and reverent life? If you can manage this, that's all even the gods, if present in your frame of mind, can ask of you.” — Marcus Aurelius (modified)   Put the phone away and be present.   “Nothing, to my way of thinking, is a better proof of a well ordered mind than a man’s ability to stop just where he is and pass some time in his own company.” — Seneca   Remind yourself that time is our most precious resource.   “Not to live as if you had endless years ahead of you. Death overshadows you. While you’re alive and able, be good.” — Marcus Aurelius   It's important we deal with obstacles we face and that we do not try to run from them.   ""Do not disturb yourself by picturing your life as a whole; do not assemble in your mind the many and varied troubles which have come to you in the past and will come again in the future, but ask yourself with regard to every present difficulty: 'What is there in this that is unbearable and beyond endurance?"" — Marcus Aurelius"

Stoicism,3d4qh0,SkepticalFaith,2,Mon Jul 13 14:43:56 2015 UTC,"At last. I think your arguments are really sane, and I think as you about this question. (I thought I am alone who thinks ""the answer of that question is out of our control"")   From the beginning I saw Stoicism as a truly Agnostic school.  The real deal (in my opinion) is that: Are Human beings more than an pile of Atoms?  Do we really exist as we think?Or we are just our own illusions about ourselves?    I believe we are far more than overly complicated piles of molecules... That is my religion."
Stoicism,3d15vy,Clementius,39,Sun Jul 12 17:42:22 2015 UTC,"I attempt to follow the Stoic separation of the emotion into two parts (the ""impression/feeling"" and the ""passion"") (or three stages, following Seneca's analysis of anger), as described here. The Seneca quote there is about anger, but really applies to compassion as well.  The feeling of compassion, as it is before judgement is passed, is natural, and was, I suspect (like affection), even cultivated by the Stoics (see the Hierocles here). The trick is to keep your judgement separate from it.  Chrystal's revision (1902) of the Hutcheson and Moore translation or Marcus Aurlius's Meditations:   Let the leading and ruling part of your soul stand unmoved by the stirrings of the flesh, whether gentle or rude. Let it not commingle with them, but keep itself apart, and confine these passions to their proper bodily parts; and if they rise into the soul by any sympathy with the body to which it is united, then we must not attempt to resist the sensation, seeing that it is of our nature; but let not the soul, for its part, add thereto the conception that the sensation is good or bad.   So, feel the compassion, recognize the sensation, do not suppress it, but do not assent to it either. It may point to a method of acting justly, for the good of society, for which purpose it is appropriate for your rational mind to make and execute plans, but the mistake, according to the Stoics, is to jump from ""I feel sad because of this"" to ""it is bad.""   Put differently, when you see something bad happen to someone, it makes you feel bad. When your internal monologue makes the statement ""this awful thing happened to X"", that also makes you feel bad, above and beyond the direct sight. It's like reacting to a broken foot by punching yourself in the head. So, I think the Stoic advice would go, don't say that, but instead say ""is there something I should do about it? If so, what?"" and proceed from there. If the answer is ""No, there is nothing you can do about it"", just accept both the event and the sensation. If the answer is ""yes, you should do this..."" act accordingly. In other words, don't ignore the impulse, but reach a conclusion about something you can control, rather than something you cannot.  Note the connection with the three disciplines.  Is this easy? Hell no. It's a whole lot easier to rant about something, to yourself or to those around you or on the internet, than it is to actually do something well thought out and strategically sound, or simply to accept  in circumstances where there is nothing to do. Complaining comes easily. What it accomplishes though, is mostly making yourself feel worse, particularly of you are just complaining to yourself or those that already agree with you. Volunteering time, giving money to the right people to do effective things, or otherwise being effective takes both effort (including doing the research about what actually is effective) and sacrifice of time and money, and does not come easy at all. It may not be the most traditionally Stoic approach, but deliberately returning your attention to the original, unjudged sentiment here is actually useful as a reminder, if you can manage it without applying the judgement.  edit: added link"

Stoicism,3d15vy,whatahorriblestory,16,Tue Jul 14 01:04:18 2015 UTC,"I had that problem for a long time.  I still do sometimes.  Empathy and compassion are some of the most important virtues to me.    What I did was something about it.  Empathy hurts sometimes, and that pain is unpleasant, but it's not 'bad.'  I use my empathy and compassion every day in both my professional and my personal life.   They help me to connect to people and understand where they come from, which is important to help them through their own struggles.    Perhaps I can provide a meal and company to a homeless person.  Perhaps it's helping someone see their problems in a new way, empowering them to overcome themselves in relation to the problem, if not the problem itself.  If talking or helping doesn't have the impact I had hoped...at least I tried.  The rest isn't in my control.    In any case, for me, the important part was to do what was in my control.  You may not be able to change the world all at once.  We are all in positions, however, to help individuals, if they'll have it.    Exercise your compassion.  It's easier said than done, when exercising it doesn't always yield the results we hope for; when that happens, it's outside of our control.    Exercise compassion as a virtue, even when it's hard.  Also, accept that there is injustice and suffering in the world.  Do what you can.  Choose to see the good you have contributed to rather than suffering you can't stop.  Accept both your limits and understand the limits of others, even if those limits are subject to change as people grow.  Understand why people do things that create suffering in their own life and the lives of others.  And understand that suffering does not need to be a 'bad' thing.   Suffering can be an opportunity for growth and change if the person suffering will let it.  Lastly, understand the role of 'choice' in suffering.   To truly help someone not to suffer, they have to choose not to let things that, in their mind, contribute to their suffering continue to do so.  And they have to be empowered enough as individuals to see that they do, in fact, have that choice.    I think most people make choices based, in part at least, on their emotions.  You have a gift to understand the often less-than-rational part of their choices.  Sometimes it hurts.  But if that's where they are at, that is where they must be met if you want to help them.    Edit: some grammar, I'm on mobile."

Now, for example, if you think about the pain in the world, a good approach is to ask oneself ""what can I do about it?"", if it's something that happens beyond your radius of possible action, then it's better to acknowledge it for what it is and let it be. Perhaps a good way of understanding this would be as controlled empathy; something bad happens, and this brings pain to others, it is fine to realize that this is something undesirable but that it can't be changed. In this way empathy is triggered without indifference but acceptance.  Nevertheless, there are many things within the radius of action, and it's in there that helping make the world a better place can be achieved."

Never pressured him, kind of just tried to be a good example for him. But he became a toxic person in my life. He wasn't ready to change or help himself, so nothing I offered him helped. Instead is getting mad at him I kind if just stepped back. I still talk to him at work. But I don't have emotions invested in him any longer. It was dragging me down. He actually came back around once i started to avoid him and now he's been to rehab and aa meetings. I don't think I'm the one that helped him, but I'm glad someone did."

You don't just want to keep your job but also your peace of mind, and of the two peace of mind is more important.  Remember everyone has what they think are good reasons for what they do.  You're fortunate in that you're just not the kind of person who violates the law in your work.  Therefore this isn't even a choice for you, therefore nothing to worry about.  How they respond to your integrity is entirely up to them.  You can try to convince them, but as long as you put a good effort in, your ultimate eloquence isn't even up to you; it comes down to your education, personality, and how much you've practiced rhetoric in the past.

Referencing professional codes of ethics (whether to them, or just in your mind) may be helpful:   software engineering system administration   In the end, if they don't relent and the pressure (on time, mental energy, organizational ability) leaves you unable to ethically perform your job effectively, you may be obligated to resign.  Or, at a certain point they may demand a firm commitment on what/when you can deliver, and your answer may force an ultimatum.  Remember, stay calm, respond rationally rather than from anger/fear, and take the time to listen to what they're saying, then evaluate for a moment rather than immediately responding to first impressions.  Better to respond slowly than rashly.  As a practical matter, silence can be a powerful tool in a negotiation, and taking your time to respond can project authority.  Replying by email to their questions may give you time to frame your thoughts and make them concise. It also can't hurt to have an electronic trail of the situation (though I wouldn't focus too much on fitting the whole background story in, you might say ""unfortunately I can't do X because it violates my understanding of Y law or Z regulation""). Be aware this may throw down the gauntlet so to speak.  These situations can be stressful but a great opportunity to practice virtue as well.  I've been in similar situations a few times so I can relate.  Even if things don't go the way you prefer, you might find it less stressful in the end to be without a job but out of that situation knowing you did the right thing and I think you'll find in your next job your confidence and charisma have grown from the experience, even if you don't handle this one perfectly.  Best of luck, and please do follow up with how it went!"
Stoicism,3d10d7,mithrowaway98,9,Sun Jul 12 16:57:14 2015 UTC,"Stoicism is a very rich philosophy. Everyone on the planet practices at least some part of it. However, the core value of Stoicism is that virtue is the only good. If you want to live life to the fullest at the expense of personal virtue, then you'll always feel conflicted. When Seneca urges us to live every day as if it were our last, he is not telling us to have more thrills or to scratch things off our bucket list. He is urging us to become excellent people and to express that through our actions."
Stoicism,3d10d7,brazosite,3,Sun Jul 12 17:10:02 2015 UTC,"Succinct and correct. I want to expand that virtue, that is here arete, does not necessarily mean living according to Christian virtue as the modern Western reader would likely read this. Rather it means exercising control over your opinions and thoughts, what you strive for within that framework is not exactly restricted by ancient Stoicism and the ancient authors wouldn't have reason to write about that, as the society they lived in already provided the norms to live by."
Stoicism,3d10d7,bebestman,2,Sun Jul 12 17:28:12 2015 UTC,"So 'virtue is the only good' implies simply having a set of strict and sound moral values for oneself, rather than simply following those that society provides?"
Stoicism,3d10d7,cleomedes,13,Sun Jul 12 17:33:12 2015 UTC,"Stoicism is an example of a virtue ethics rather than a deontological one; it isn't really a matter a following rules, but being a person with certain properties. I think I've seen a Seneca quote along the lines of ""following the law is a meagre sort of innocence.""   In other words, what matters in Stoicism is what kind of person you are. Which do you care more about, your own pleasure or the good of society as a whole? Are you brave, or cowardly? etc.   If you look at Stoic writing, you see much more about how to think, what viewpoint to take, what to value etc., than on specific rules (do X, don't do Y).  If you shift how you think, wise decisions will follow naturally. If you fail to correct how you think, you will behave foolishly, whatever rules you follow or actions you take, even if they are the exact same actions as a different person who has corrected their thinking.  edit: Let's compare two people Alice and Bob. Alice is a true Stoic sage, valuing and judging as the Stoics thought you should. Bob wants pleasure, but he is pretty sophisticated about it; he isn't satisfied with mere sensual pleasure, but wants eudaimonia, fulfilment. He also has a brain implant that tells him exactly what a Stoic sage would do in the circumstance he is in; if he just follows it, he behaves exactly as a sage would. So, the then goes on and lives exactly following everything the implant tells him.  According to the Stoics, Alice will actually achieve eudaimonia, and live a fulfilled, virtuous life. Alice gets everything she wants, because she wants nothing that is not in her power. She does as much good for the world as anyone in her circumstance could, and she knows it. Bob, on the other hand, fails to achieve this, because even though he also has does as much good for the world as anyone in his circumstance could have, he has not actually achieved what he wanted, which has happiness. Bob is trying to play a game where you only score by wearing the gold medal.   edit 2: This brings up an interesting feature of Stoic philosophy. Where as many believe that people value things because these things make them happy, the Stoics thought the cause and effect of this assertion are reversed: people are made happy by things they get because they value them. Conversely, the Stoics thought things cause people distress because they think them bad, not vice versa. (This only really applies, I think, to the rational aspect of emotions; animal impulses, ""fancies"" and ""impressions"" as the Stoic jargon is usually translated, can cause the pleasurable or painful sensations, but not happiness or distress of the sort that corresponds to eudaimonia or fulfilment or their lack. For an extreme example, if you truly convince yourself that the physical sensation of pain is not a bad thing (an admittedly monumental task), then the physically sensation of pain won't disturb you, in the sense of preventing you from flourishing or having a fulfilling life.)"

The general question of ""What would a Stoic do?"" comes up from time to time and people give wildly varying answers with little substantial reason behind them.  An example is when people stumble upon Aurel's passage on not reading books anymore or Seneca's comment on the horrible sound of musical instruments. Or when people ask what kind of career the Sage would work for and so on.  I still maintain that an ancient Stoic and a modern Stoic would have different views on this matter and it is an open question for the modern reader.

Feel free to incorporate anything of mine you like.    A good related discussion can be found in p. 82 of Sharple's Stoics, Epicureans, and Sceptics.   For other background (related more to my other comment below, but the issues are intertwined), I find the ""character strengths and virtues"" approach to positive psychology, advocated by Seligman and others, has a lot in common with classical virtue ethics."
Stoicism,3d10d7,bebestman,2,Tue Jul 14 01:19:29 2015 UTC,"From the FAQ linked in the sidebar:   Arete (in the context of Stoicism, excellence of character, or virtue) is the only good; departures from arete the only evils.   Some things are up to us, a consequence only of our character; everything else is not up to us, and independent of our character. Things which we appear only to influence can and should be separated into factors that are entirely up to us, and entirely independent of us. The impossible is never compulsory; the unavoidable, never forbidden. External events are not features of our character, and so can be neither good nor bad. There are four basic virtues (properties of an excellent character): wisdom, justice, courage, and self-control.    What I wanted to stress is that nowhere does it say that a Stoic has to follow strict Christian rules, Islamic rules, secular systems of morality or whatever. Ancient Stoics did not write about following the rules of their society or not because at that time there was just no concept of non-Roman morality: Their rules were the only rules. Conversely, living in a time where you are free to choose your ethics, things are different. Personally I believe that there is a rather small set of moral universals that are essential to living a virtuous life, but this set is extremely small and more specifically does not include avoiding any kind of sensory pleasure via movies, music, drugs and so on."
Stoicism,3d10d7,cleomedes,2,Sun Jul 12 17:40:45 2015 UTC,"Ancient Stoics did not write about following the rules of their society or not because at that time there was just no concept of non-Roman morality: Their rules were the only rules.   This takes the case a bit too far, I think. Ancient Greek philosophy started in an environment in which each city-state had its own independent government, with different governments having very different political systems, ranging from autocracies to aristocracies to democracies to mixtures of varying sorts. Many such philosophers (including Zeno; see here) wrote books on what they thought the rules and traditions of such cities should be, and they were often anything but conventional. The Cynics (who strongly influenced Stoicism, but not in this specific aspect) went so far as to advocate a complete rejection of social conventions and traditions.  By the time we get into time from which all  surviving Stoic works originate, the Roman Empire, circumstances were more than a little different, but the Romans were certainly aware of a vast diversity of cultural norms, and different provinces of Rome were apparently quite diverse, and allowed to be such. This extended even to religious observances; the Romans were syncretists, and respected foreign religious observances, places, and customs (or at least thought they should). I'm a bit rusty on my history, but I think I remember a story of Cato demanding hist troops pay tribute at the local shrines they passed through in Africa, and another where plagues (I think during Marcus Aurelius's times) were attributed by some Romans as retribution of the gods on Rome for desecration of religious sites in the middle east by Roman soldiers. (Christianity got itself into trouble not because Christians had their own religious ceremonies and customs, but because they refused to participate in the religious customs of the local populations as well. The idea that you wouldn't at least go through the motions of participating in the worship ceremonies of one god because you worshipped another was apparently seen as bizarre, intolerant, and anti-social.)  (This is, of course, something of an over-simplification; Rome lasted centuries, and the social, political, and spiritual climate certainly varied greatly over that time.)  The Stoics (and many other philosophers) did, I believe, think that virtue was universal, although the specific actions of a virtuous person might vary from one culture to another, just as which side of the street one should drive on will vary from one country to another. There aren't many cultures that value foolishness over wisdom, cowardice over bravery, etc. Even dogs and chimpanzees seem to have a sense of justice. While the details of how each culture might vary, the Stoics thought that the basic psychology of human moral development progressed toward action for the good of the ""cosmopolis"", the society of all rational beings. (See oikeiosis.) Different humans of different societies might have different ideas of what precisely is good for the cosmopolis, and how to get there, but I think these were seen more as technical than moral issues, and such advice concerning it as survives is clearly under specific contexts.  The Stoics were really quite harsh on the pursuit of pleasure for its own sake, although they did recognize leisure as a means to virtuous ends (see Seneca's Of Leisure). You might argue that the Stoics did pursue eudaimonia, sometimes translated as ""happiness"", having argued that virtue was necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia, but ""eudaimonia"" is not quite captured by the English word ""happiness"". I have seen it argued that it is better translated as ""flourishing"". An ancient Greek talking about seeking eudaimonia might be closer to a modern English speaker talking about seeking ""fulfilment"" than ""enjoyment"".  edit: Sorry, /u/bebestman . This comment started off in response to a small element of your comment, and degenerated into a response of much wider scope, but less relevance."

Stoicism,3d10d7,sikfoq,2,Sun Jul 12 17:23:59 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna say something, disregarding your questions and what it says. Why would you feel pressed to follow a stoic lifestyle if doing something outside of that philosophy makes you happy and doesn't harm anyone else? Stoicism for me is about evolving as a person and enjoying life as I do not, as a non believer, have more than one.   Don't practice (in the sense of following it to follow it) the philosophy, instead take in what it has to say into your life and the good aspects of it and make your own life, as an individual, not a stoic, more fulfilling. I do this with all religions and philosophies I come across. Lessons have been learned from Islam,  Christianity etc. even when I don't believe in a god, life after death or any prophets.   The only prophets that are in this world for me are my friends. The people that I look up to and admire. For their kindness, ease for forgiveness and  acceptance. These are the people that showed me how I want to live.  Thankfully stoicism is a great philosophy and I fully believe almost everything it encourages but I'm still going to remain open minded to different philosophical ideas.  Edit:clarifying"

For me personally (I'm sure others disagree), living in the moment, and fitting as many incredible memories into each of my days has so far been the most satisfying and ""full"" my life has ever felt.

If a person is a habitual psychotropics user, meditation is wasted effort:  Your nervous system (brain) is constantly in a cycle of extreme ping-ponging from one state to another; you are highly variable, inconsistent, not to mention a classic ""hungry ghost"" who wants to consume wisdom like sugar -feeding the ego- rather than be consumed by ""transcendent wisdom"", ""buddha nature"", or maybe ""logos"" as it relates to virtue within a Hellenistic mindset.  You want something you cannot have:  If your motivation is fear, then virtue will always convert to vice; it may appear to be ""virtue"" in how it corresponds to populist wisdom founded in new age garbageheadedness, but you will be constructing a false path.   MDMA is simply going to wreck your nervous system. Psychedelics will corrupt the desire for virtue by creating a false impression of that virtue; we know what justice is but social conditioning clouds that sense over time. ""Lucyheads"" will simply become an ambiguous, diffuse mess. Marijuana is a medicine, and along with other entheogens and psychotropics, is not a ""party drug"" so much as a situationally appropriate compound.   I was not able to sustain an actual meditation practice, or have a visceral experience of impermanence, interdependency, virtue, or the radical self -""is-ness""- until I was clean of substances, and learned how to be relaxed (via mindfulness) in solitude.  Hungry ghosts cannot calm the fug down so that sitting meditation or general mindfulness can be practiced: that is why I say what I say about the quality of your nervous system."

What will you pay attention to today? Firstly, you must recognize what is your top priority and that which is most important to you and your salvation. When you realize this, the rest will fall into place. Remove your judgements which have colored all that you have done and that you see. They are like a chain around your neck, which is tied to horses leading you astray. Put the chain down and walk free. Put your energy into that thing which saves and builds a strong base. Notice that when you try to juggle too many things you inevitably lose your concentration and drop something. Is it a great calamity? Perhaps not, yet you would prefer to not waste your efforts. Therefore, do not juggle, Be like the master craftsman who uses one tool at a time and plods on at his own pace -- there is no rush and no reason to rush. Recognize how often you have cut yourself and done a disservice to your aims by rushing.   If I had to make a suggestion, I would say to focus on your health first. It can be a really good base that everything else can follow from. By committing yourself to a good diet and working out every day, you'll be able to have more energy, more confidence, more happiness, and be willing to try new things, take risks, and challenge life.

You can't change it, so you might as well get something out of it, right? And besides, did you think that you're a sage? You're not. I'm not. Nobody on this forum is. So these things are going to happen. You will never be perfect; you'll just approach perfection, if you study and practice regularly.  I would make a T-chart. I'd actually write it in pen and paper. It helps focus the mind (like Marcus's journaling). On the left write ""What did I learn?"" On the right write ""What can I fix?""   Perhaps you learned that you would rather not express political opinions when you don't have to, because nobody gets much out of it. Perhaps you can somewhat fix things by apologizing to Ted. By the way, if you apologize I recommend doing it once, completely, and then never again. They accept it or they don't, but groveling won't help anyone.  You seem like a person who might hold himself to a high standard. That is certainly useful, but then again there is a freedom in realizing that you're not perfect and you never will be. Accepting this lets you view yourself with some sympathy. Like Seneca says, it allows you to become a better friend to yourself. As Stoics we are to be kind to our fellow people, but we are also called to be kind to ourselves. Correcting our faults need not come with a big dose of guilt. Look at the Meditations; here's a man who is honest with himself without beating himself up. He writes to himself as he would write to a close friend.   As for your work schedule, your diet, your working out etc. I would view this as an opportunity. It's good training. If you can force yourself to muster some discipline and follow a schedule in the bad times it will be MUCH easier to do in the good times. It will build character and expand the soul.  And consider this: 1.5 months ago when you were happily rolling along were you REALLY being tested? Were you REALLY developing as a person? Perhaps you were, but not as much as you are about to. Easy living is NOT what builds a life, right? This is. This is where a strong soul is forged. How else would it happen? How can you grow if you're never tested?  Since I am a Stoic theist* I'd also say that God has given us the tools we need to achieve virtue. Epictetus said this too. You have all you need. It's reassuring when you think about it like that.  Finally I would be really interested to hear back from you. Did any of our advice work? Did you learn something that we can use? Please keep in touch. Better yet maybe start a blog and let us follow your progress. Watching somebody break through (and you WILL break through) is heartening.  *No offense to my atheist brothers and sisters! Big tent!

Stoicism,3cwpgr,stoicismtoday,2,Sat Jul 11 12:48:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with Mike in the comments.  I too have sort of struggled with the insistence of some that belief in god or other rational agency ordering the universe is in some manner necessary for one to be an adherent to stoic philosophy.  Perhaps it is, but if so, then I will happily continue to learn from stoicism without being a stoic.  Epictetus (and others) mentions providence and related issues such as signs, omens and various forms of divination.  I do not believe in any of these things.  Their efficacy has never been demonstrated to me.  I truly see no reason to hold to either them or any manner of prime mover/logos/god.  To me, the answer to the question is of course atoms, and we have very good reason for holding to such an answer given the progress of scientific knowledge.  Now, I can believe in some manner of fate, if by fate it is meant something like causal determinism (or probabilistic determinism since I also hold to quantum indeterminacy).  Stoicism is about striving to be eminently practical and rational in our actions and attitudes towards natural phenomena (including social phenomena, which is merely a subset of natural).  This pragmatism functions equally well whether one posits a rational order to the universe or a probabilistic determinacy, either way, one must deal with the universe the way it is, and the best way to do this is with the light of reason illuminating our steps.  Every departure from this method invites needless confusion, misery, and suffering and inhibits us from living our lives to their fullest."

In a time when everyone has an opinion and voices it at a level that is on equal ground as everyone else, and when we are constantly bombarded by criticism and outside influences, the thought of following an ethos that teaches introspective thoughts rather than outward blathering is very attractive.   To me, stoicism isn't really an idea or philosophy to follow - it's almost a method of therapy and coping in this insane world."

The ancient people had nothing, he says, Marcus Aurelius did not even have a play station. What is this guy smoking?  He thinks that science is going to solve all problems, he even talks about changing one's neurons in our brains to solve problems... What he seems to wish is very similar to some dystopic scenarios we know from science fiction films where the evil guys argue exactly like this one in the video.   Okay, I have to agree that Stoicism was in fact a method of coping with a shitty existence in ancient times.   I do not agree. Stoicism has never been a method. Stoicism is a philosophy. Stoicism is certainly a philosophy which also offers methods for coping with the bad sides of the human condition, but it is first and foremost a philosophy."

There are a lot of theories flying around that if humanity hits the gas on technological development, we may possibly see the technological singularity in a few decades.  And that's really down to the point the vlogger is trying to make - he's bought into the theories that we're on the cusp of the technological singularity, which would make all of our ""human"" problems non-existent. Contentedness with where you're sitting at is contrary to getting fired up to change the world.  And that's what drives his shots at stoicism - Why psychologically adapt your mind to accept the world as it is, when the means to adjust the world to your will is just beyond your fingertips? Of course, my personal response to this would simply be ""Why not both?"".  P.S. Transhumans wanting to modify their brains is not automatically dystopic in nature.

To not be controlled by unexamined feelings, habits, imaginings, etc. For me, it's about more fully being myself, as I exist in my own skin and in this moment and juncture of my life. I have goals, I have plans, I have my concerns about them, etc...but what I want from stoicism is to be less prone to the many changing currents in my life, mind, subconscious, heart, etc that can become distracting, or compelling. So in that sense it's about mindfulness.   I like your summary   Stoicism is the philosophy that the only thing necessary for living a good life is to work well with those things that are in our control.   I guess I might say, it's about, as far as is possible, choosing who to be, consciously, and understanding, that things that seem compelling or immutable, fears, anxieties, obsessions, addictions, etc are nowhere near as powerful as we make them."

Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions.  [...] But if you suppose that only to be your own which is your own, and what belongs to others such as it really is, then no one will ever compel you or restrain you.

Stoicism,3ctydv,bebestman,3,Fri Jul 10 23:54:28 2015 UTC,"""Stoicism is recognizing that being a virtuous person who selflessly works for the common means training oneself to be a virtuous person, and that the key to that training is to not attach oneself emotionally to things beyond one's control.""  To explain my sentence, I think the biggest hindrance to leading a true Stoic life is to confuse its means with its end. Too often, I think Stoic techniques are applied to selfish ends - ""practice this and be more productive!"" - but that's not it. Stoicism requires, to paraphrase Marcus Aurelius, the recognition that we are but a small part of a common humanity - like a hand or foot. To be the best part of humanity we can be, we have to rid ourselves of desires and attachments beyond our control, including our own egos. The Stoic techniques are a great means to that end. But tranquility isn't our goal - tranquility is merely a useful way to ensure we act virtuously.  But only if we direct our tranquility towards that end."

I had a conversation with a Zen monk awhile back about the prevalence of ""mindfulness"" in business/etc. One thing he noted to me is that it's quite possible to use Zen/mindfulness techniques without context, but without the Buddhist focus on compassion you end up with (in his words) ""a bunch of very productive sociopaths.""

Before that, I was a new age garbagehead, a free-floating sociopathic, narcissistic infant with no actual personality of his own. I had no virtue, and Epictetus would have rejected me as a candidate for instruction.  Understanding how a question can be right or wrong in the 1st place -before the conclusion is supported by valid premises- is an important step in knowing what I have jurisdiction over, what I control from moment to moment, and why I should give a fug about any given situation or person.   Psychosis is a permanent condition -likely to get worse as dementia sets in- but for the moment, I can ""re-boot"" my nervous system/awareness about ""reality"" and satisfy existential needs.

The Stoics had a wider idea that included epistemology.  Formal logic isn't really about finding deductions or instructions, but about determining how and whether they are valid. Most of the examples that logic teaches does sound obvious, and they are. Logicians stress the form of a logical argument, and that this is what makes the argument valid. There are rare cases I can think of where logic says something is valid, but most people wouldn't guess it is. There are some popular puzzles that are like this though. You could say that logic is useful when your reasoning requires dozens of steps and several different kinds of argument forms, like with mathematical logic.  Where logic tends to shine however is where the invalid or fallacious forms of reasoning seem similar to the valid forms of reasoning. There is this idea out there, and I forget where I read it, is that what makes fallacies compelling and persuasive is that they are similar to the valid forms of reasoning. I like this idea. Because every ""fallacy"" has a valid form as it's exception. And it makes sense of the idea of why human beings make mistakes of reasoning in the first place. It is Socratic in a way, who taught that people did evil out of mistakes of reasoning, not necessarily malice."

Sit down with a piece of paper, I personally prefer a whiteboard, but anything you can write with will do just fine. Then think about when, why, and how you think about the things that you can't control. For example, a lot of people struggle because they constantly think about that guy/girl they like. Well why do you keep thinking about this person. Just thinking that you ""like"" this person is a coup out. You need to dig deep if you want to get over it. Does this person represent a deeper anxiety of feeling unaccepted, lonely, some sort of validation for your life style? Is it possible that you romanticized this person i.e. do you only think of them in the context of pleasing situations? This is the type of active introspection that will really help you analyze your environment."

Stoicism,3cnuia,bird_flipper,8,Thu Jul 9 10:32:31 2015 UTC,"The quotable Epictet.   In every affair consider what precedes and follows, and then undertake it.   Ancient Stoic material will be somewhat thin as your fate would be set by your pater familiae or such. However, in modernity we make our own choices. A somewhat Stoic approach is to gather a reasonable amount of information, make a decision if by chance - after all, if the decision is hard, that means it is so close to hardly matter - and then distance yourself from the outcome. As an exercise, write down your motivations, and review when in doubt. If circumstances change, you can revisit your decision and try to make a new change.  For example take a student deciding on his college major: After asking friends, family and professors and consulting a few professionals he decides to pursue civil engineering over electrical engineering, since he believes that for the same amount of work, he will make more progress in the former and thus make more money to pursue his goals. He writes the data down and his goal.  After his first year, there happens some event, halving the demand for new real estate and doubling the demand for electronics. Now our hypothetical student can review his choice and make an appropriate change, if necessary. He kept his calm because he realised that with either choice he might be wrong."

That would mean that you do not exercize your ability as a being capable of reasoning.   I think you should collect as many information as you can (or can comprehend) and then make the best choice you can make at that moment.  The choice is completely in your control, so investing energy in that is good. How much you know to base your decision is somewhat in your control, so bothering with that is also good."
Stoicism,3cnuia,langejansen,2,Fri Jul 10 07:34:26 2015 UTC,"Are you saying all this because of his ""if by chance"" phrase? I'm assuming that he didn't mean randomly, since otherwise it would have seemed pointless to gather information. I took it instead to mean to merely pick one of the two options somewhat randomly if they were so close that it's incredibly difficult to pick which one is better. I think, in these cases, it truly is difficult to know which is better and the unknown factors that you aren't accounting for often swamp the small differences between the two things that you are aware of."

Stoicism,3cms3v,SemperMelius,5,Thu Jul 9 03:02:06 2015 UTC,"Antifragility is a property exhibited by Stoicism, neither an extension nor a different thing. For those that have not read the book, antifragility is the ability of a system to benefit from volatility as opposed to something fragile, like a porcelain plate, that suffers from volatility or something robust, like a car tire, that is indifferent to volatility.  More precisely, a Stoic is antifragile, Stoicism only insofar as systems of knowledge are antifragile. This property is nicely illustrated by Epictet's passage about being at a dinner:   Remember that you must behave in life as at a dinner party. Is anything brought around to you? Put out your hand and take your share with moderation. Does it pass by you? Don't stop it. Is it not yet come? Don't stretch your desire towards it, but wait till it reaches you. Do this with regard to children, to a wife, to public posts, to riches, and you will eventually be a worthy partner of the feasts of the gods. And if you don't even take the things which are set before you, but are able even to reject them, then you will not only be a partner at the feasts of the gods, but also of their empire. [...]   The Stoic will enjoy the benefits of life as they come and go, not unnecessarily strive for them and not suffer beyond measure when they go away. The more volatile life is the more the Stoic can enjoy this beautiful mess and strive in it. The ordinary person however is fragile, as he clings to what he has been given and cries when it is lost, that is the more volatile his life is, the more he suffers.  An aside, what is popularly seen as ""stoicism"" with a lowercase ""s"", emotionlessness, is being robust in this triad: Volatility neither hurts nor benefits the person. Therefore I am always eager to point out that the Sage laughs and laughs a lot, when he has reason to.  Did this answer your question?"
Stoicism,3cms3v,bebestman,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:25:05 2015 UTC,"Talebs triad includes the fragile, resilient and antifragile as you mentioned. However, wouldn't Stoicism fall into the resilient category more than the antifragile category? Epictetus starts the Enchiridion by saying that we should be indifferent events out of our control. Wouldn't a Stoic feel indifferent to external volatility by this logic? In what I have read, the Stoic truly does tend to be the tire you describe."
Stoicism,3cms3v,bebestman,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:38:38 2015 UTC,"From ""Antifragile"":   So he [Seneca] played a trick on fate: kept the good and ditched the bad; cut the downside and kept the upside. Self-servingly, that is, by eliminating the harm from fate and un-philosophically keeping the upside. This cost-benefit analysis is not quite Stoicism in the way people understand the meaning of Stoicism (people who study Stoicism seem to want Seneca and other Stoics to think like those who study Stoicism). There is an upside-downside asymmetry.  That's antifragility in its purest form.   (Emph. mine) Not Stoicism as Epictet saw it? Maybe."
Stoicism,3cms3v,Dodfire13,2,Thu Jul 9 15:58:16 2015 UTC,"This is my take on the distinction, I'm curious on others thoughts on it.  Both philosophies deal with how man can be Virtuous in a chaotic, volatile world.  Stoicism is a defensive approach. By training the mind to be rational and understand exactly what is in our control, the external world cannot harm the Stoic.  Antifragility is equivalent to saying ""the best defence is good offense."" By adopting the attitude that every challenge is an opportunity for growth, the external world cannot harm the Antifragile."
Stoicism,3cms3v,meco3,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:08:18 2015 UTC,"Reading the book now so I won't weigh in too much.  I think stoicism prospers in a chaotic environment.  I see stoicism as a process that can best be learned through use, and that chaos provides the opportunity to practice what is preached.  This practice then creates, over time, an individual who is anti fragile."
Stoicism,3cms3v,bebestman,0,Fri Jul 10 16:56:23 2015 UTC,"I have a question about this because I'm still not quite sure if I understand Stoicism, yet.  You say that Stoics enjoy benefits of life as they come and go.  Reading in this sub and from what I've heard about Stoicism, it appears to me it is striving to not react strongly with/to emotion, not to make attachments because they cause suffering.  But, reacting to emotion and making attachments is inherently human; part of life.  So denying these things, isn't that not simply experiencing life as it comes?  Isn't that an act of defiance against human nature, a struggle to achieve something that is not naturally occurring?  Sorry if I'm not asking this clearly.  It just seemed that your response contradicts what I've read about stoicism.  Is about just enjoying life at face value?  Or is it about apathy (something I feel people have to work at to achieve)?  Those things are mutually exclusive, in my mind."
Stoicism,3cms3v,meco3,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:08:59 2015 UTC,"Emotion is the reaction and is caused not by the external event, but by our judgements and thoughts about it. Beyond that there are some reactions which are inherently biological. A simple example is a broken cup: If my sincere belief was ""My happiness is dependent on this cup"", I'd be devastated. If my sincere belief was ""There are other cups that will work just as well"", I'd just go on living. And so it is with all things small or big. However if I burn my hand, I'll cry out in pain, and if a family member dies, I'll cry for a day, but in both cases I'll go on living.  Modern folk philosophy has a love for emotion, the Stoics do not. Humanity doesn't come from having an emotional reaction, most mammals have that too, but from the choice of how to respond to any situation.  So, to come back to the example of the cup, I believe ""this cup is beautiful and useful"" and I believe ""one day this cup will leave my life."" The cup will bring me some enjoyment while it is here and I won't be sad when that is over.  Read some more, ask some more. Gladly also here."
Stoicism,3cms3v,bebestman,0,Thu Jul 9 13:27:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you for that!!! So about the cup that you have accepted will one day will leave your life, doesn't that stop you from enjoying the cup on an elevated level?  Or are you saying that's what should be avoided?  Let's take a couple in love for instance, assuming the person will one day leave you... Wouldn't that create a defense; a wall that you put up to keep yourself from getting hurt when that assumed time comes, and wouldn't that cause you to not enjoy the relationship as intensely as possible?  And what if you're wrong?  What if that cup or person never leaves you and you've misused time with them?  I guess I'm wondering if Stoics believe you can have the highs without the lows, or do they believe the highs are not worth the lows so they avoid both?? Sorry for all the questions, but I like your explanations!"
Stoicism,3cms3v,meco3,3,Thu Jul 9 14:42:07 2015 UTC,"So about the cup that you have accepted will one day will leave your life, doesn't that stop you from enjoying the cup on an elevated level?   I say not at all. Personally, it even enhances the pleasure, but that is not exactly the point as the Stoic strives for virtue, that is reacting to the world appropriately, not pleasure. With regard to enjoyment of the cup, I say that knowing it will leave me makes the time all that more precious: Tomorrow it might be over, enjoy it while it lasts. On the flipside, if I belive that the cup will be there forever I might be more careless with it or disinclined to give it much attention.   Or are you saying that's what should be avoided?   Not exactly sure what you're getting at. Avoid making your happiness dependent on that which you can not control, in this case whether the cup is there or not.   Let's take a couple in love for instance, assuming the person will one day leave you... Wouldn't that create a defense; a wall that you put up to keep yourself from getting hurt when that assumed time comes, and wouldn't that cause you to not enjoy the relationship as intensely as possible?   Again I say, not at all. All relationships will end, one way or another: One partner breaks up with the other, or they don't and they stay in love until one of them dies, at which point the relationship ends. Is it then irrational to be mindful of this fact? Not at all.  Your opinion is surprisingly popular by the way, but mistaken from the Stoic point of view. The sage enjoys the feeling of being in love - we call this a preferred indifferent - but he won't control it and most certainly he won't believe ""this will never end"" and ""my happiness is dependent on this feeling of love."" If you believe those, of course you will be unhappy when the relationship ends, if you believe the second, but not the first, of course you will put up a defence, if you believe the first, but not the second, you will be sorely disappointed. But if you believe neither, as the Sage does, you will be calm at all times.  Before we move on, try to remember a time where you knew your experience will end but at the same time you enjoyed it. It might be small talk with a stranger in transit, a flower you passed by, or a travel destination. I assume that in not one of those cases you would say that you put up a defence, because there you naturally thought both ""this will end"" and ""my happiness is not dependent on this.""   And what if you're wrong? What if that cup or person never leaves you and you've misused time with them?   See above. All things end one way or another, with some luck however you will have a loving relationship until the end of your life and you will be free from the pain of loss. But that is besides the larger point, being that your happiness should not be contingent on the external stuff outside of your control, but on your reaction to them.   I guess I'm wondering if Stoics believe you can have the highs without the lows, or do they believe the highs are not worth the lows so they avoid both??   You approach this from a hedonistic standpoint (sensory pleasure) and the Stoic strives for virtue (reacting in an appropriate matter). My larger point however is that in striving for virtue the Stoic will achieve happiness the Hedonist will never know. Personally, I guess that a strictly Stoic life will shave off some extreme pleasure but thwart almost all psychological pain, so it is a good tradeoff.   Sorry for all the questions, but I like your explanations!   Only fools never ask questions. And thank you.  Two last things. One, Stoicism is an ancient philosophy and you are reading modern interpretations which will mix original works, psychological interpretations and personal experience, so proceed with caution. Which brings me to my second point, that I was mainly talking about psychology, but it has  little immediate bearing on Stoic philosophy."
Stoicism,3cms3v,bebestman,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:18:02 2015 UTC,"You are great - thanks for taking the time to respond!  I do like the idea of appreciating something in the moment, not worrying about it lasting forever, but just taking in the moment.   I think I find it very difficult to let things happen organically, I have a very type A personality...that was just a digression.  So - the attachment part of Stoicism:  Am I wrong in interpreting it as it's not about not making attachments, but not allowing those attachments to be the sole source of happiness?  Like it's not about keeping distance from attachments, just also being accepting of the fact that if these attachments are to be lost, you will not be lost?"
Stoicism,3cms3v,meco3,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:45:42 2015 UTC,"That is certainly one way to put it.   Like it's not about keeping distance from attachments, just also being accepting of the fact that if these attachments are to be lost, you will not be lost?   I want to correct myself, that is a very succinct way to put it.   I think I find it very difficult to let things happen organically, I have a very type A personality...   The philosopher needs to train for life as the athlete needs to train for a competition. A change of view this massive won't happen over night.  Let's end it with a quote from Epictet:   Never say of anything, ""I have lost it""; but, ""I have returned it."" Is your child dead? It is returned. Is your wife dead? She is returned. Is your estate taken away? Well, and is not that likewise returned? ""But he who took it away is a bad man."" What difference is it to you who the giver assigns to take it back? While he gives it to you to possess, take care of it; but don't view it as your own, just as travelers view a hotel."

Stoicism,3cml9q,Phaint,10,Thu Jul 9 02:05:59 2015 UTC,"Pretty much any visualization exercise works in writing: write them rather than ""visualize"" them. For me, it helps maintain focus.  Lots of issues become easier to think about rationally, and handle emotionally, with a shift in perspective. Writing about events from a different perspective forces your mind to take that perspective, at least a little bit, for a little while. So, write about your situation from the perspective of a sage, or a benevolent spirit, or a (real or fictional) character whose wisdom you admire, etc. Sometimes, if you are in a conflict, it is useful to write from the perspective of those you are in conflict with.  Treat writing like ""practice thinking"": write your internal monologue as you wish it to be, rather than what it is, reword it over and over.   Use writing as a tool to focus attention, to remind yourself of advice you want yourself to follow. I believe this is much of what M.A. was trying to do.  See this journaling exercise, posted here a little while ago.  I put down some other ideas here."

For presumably there is no like minded person on the battleground he can talk to or share his hopes and fears with, and he is a philosopher, after all, a man who thinks a lot about life, about existence, about the meaning of life, about death, about other people, about the world, about (the) god(s), about time and space, and whatever crosses his mind in the moment and, generally speaking, all the sort-of stuff that most people apparently aren't aware of or aren't aware they're thinking of or, if they are, the sort-of stuff that they too for whatever reason keep to themselves. Stuff that is unspoken and stuff therefore that was strictly his, i.e., under his control."
Stoicism,3cml9q,MinotaurWarrior,3,Thu Jul 9 07:43:34 2015 UTC,"Marcus Aurelius Antonius Augustus writes specific formulations of stoic principles. There's basically two ways of composing such thibgs: top down, where you just think on some big topic like virtue or nature and try to narrow your thoughts down into a paragraph or less, or bottom up where you face a situation in your life, think about how to face it stoically, and then generalize it a bit.   For example, today it suddenly started raining on my way to work. So, I thought about how it's nonsense to get upset about the weather, if for no other reason than that the rain is in fact a very good thing overall, and I'd rather be caught in the rain than caught in a drought. I might generalize this a bit to arrive at the principle, ""often what seems a misfortune to you is is caused by a great fortune to the many, and to take it as an malady is to injure yourself not only in the wailing and gnashing of teeth, but also in tearing yourself away from the good of the  community of rational animals.""  I might also think about the nature of courage, and think, well, courage isn't always straight forward - extreme sports and roller casters are about facing fears, but I hardly think the sage would spend all his time at the amusement park or a base jumping gathering. So what's that about? ""Do not think the conquest of a vice such as cowardice is in itself a virtue, for indeed such can be accomplished by other vices yet more overpowering, such as desire for pleasure. The conquest of a vice is only good if done at the service of a virtue""   That's how this practice usually goes for me."
Stoicism,3cj4a4,emviy,7,Wed Jul 8 08:50:56 2015 UTC,"Overall, not bad. My major objection is that it perpetuates the myth that the Stoic attitude toward emotion depends on whether it is positive or negative, when it really has nothing to do with whether it was positive or negative, but with whether it interferes with acting in accordance with reason, which is behaving virtuously, or showing excellence of character. Mistaking a present advantage (external commonly regarded as good) for a present good can result in a ""positive"" emotion, but it is still a passion, a disease of the mind. An ""impression"" of a present disadvantage might be regarded as a ""negative"" emotion, but provided assent is not given, the mind is sound, the emotion indifferent.  The quotes used to illustrate the points were very well chosen. I would wish more complete references were given for them. This isn't just academic triviality; guidance on where to go for greater context and further study is an important part of all educational material."

He delivers well researched introductory lectures with far more depth than other channels like School of Life. He's often incredibly overt about his own views, but if you don't mind I'd recommend subscribing. If that does bother you, you should probably avoid any video that goes near politics.   Personally, I'm a fan of the fact that this video goes into the history and philosophical background rather than launching straight into the practical stuff. Too often stoicism is just treated as a set of mental tools rather than a true philosophy that begins it's normative claims from a series of presupposed positions (determinism, universal reason, etc). My only major criticism is that an introductory lecture should probably point towards certain books and further information, but academyofideas never usually directs the viewer towards anything more. That's super nit-picky though.  Overall, great video."

Stoicism,3ccdf5,Prokopton,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:30:33 2015 UTC,How did you get your samples for the 'consequentialists'?
Stoicism,3ccdf5,MinotaurWarrior,2,Mon Jul 6 23:30:44 2015 UTC,"The ethical reasoning variable was measured by analyzing responses to the ""trolley problem"", the crux of the problem is whether to allow five people to die and one to live without intervening,  or to intervene and condemn the one man to save the five. I collected open responses to this scenario and looked for instances where the participant made their decision with particular attention to the outcome rather than the nature of the act of intervention (deontology), or peesonal characteristics of the person Intervening (virtue ethics). So for instance, arguing that ""saving five lives is better than one"" is a value judgement about the possible outcomes, and treats the outcome as 'good'. Participants who argued that condemning one man was murder and therefore impossible,  or that condemning a man so callously was not virtuous, or any other reasoning not prioritising the 'best consequence' were grouped into an ""other"" category. I would like to have split them further but there was a large majority of consequentialists. And I had a lot of null responses to this item too, mainly with people refusing to answer or trying to change the rules of the scenario (guessing that the lever used to intervene would set off a bomb and kill all six men instead, when this was never explicitly part of the dilemma).  One thing I noted was that this was a single item measure. It did require detail and showed practical use of ethical reasoning, which avoids the issue of people not knowing which philosophical school they relate to, since in my experience thats not common knowledge. However, in my analysis of epictetus' advice I had neglected to note that it was in the context of habitual behaviours over a long period. When he says ""men are not disturbed by events, but their thoughts about them"" this is a broad statement, rather than specific. With hindsight, in my discussion I argued that a single measure of ethical reasoning in response to a moral dilemma did not accurately reflect the kind of consistent behaviour to which epictetus reffered. Nor did answering the trolley problem a certain way indicate consistency in their ethical reasoning, people may have answered using consequentialist reasoning despite being mostly deontological about their decisions in daily life.  Excuse my formatting, im on my phone.  Edit: fixed Epicetus quote"

Stoicism,3c9ita,seanuskr,14,Mon Jul 6 12:41:40 2015 UTC,Noice ! Keep posting :)
Stoicism,3c9ita,Buddhamama42,2,Mon Jul 6 05:55:19 2015 UTC,"As an aggregate of traits, characteristics, attributes, experiences, thoughts, etc., I personally, am special. Very few people are. Not better or worse, just uncommon in regards to personal history.  Separate all those attributes, and none of them are unique, but this whole thing that is ""me""? it is semi-unique.  I would be careful blogging about material, ideas, writings which are commonly available to the public; be a way pointer, not an interpreter. Stoic principles are already present as natural instincts, and actual Stoic writings are best used as a trigger to activate those instincts."
Stoicism,3c9ita,sikfoq,2,Mon Jul 6 19:28:49 2015 UTC,"and actual Stoic writings are best used as trigger to activate those instincts.   Who gets to decide who is a Stoic though? Maybe this blogger is just as Stoic as the originals? Or maybe it's useful to have people interpret them in more modern language? After all, I know I'm not reading the original Greek."
Stoicism,3c9ita,yayfall,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:13:44 2015 UTC,"I would not pin a Stoic badge on someone based on their history of reading various texts from key thinkers. Consistent behavior permits me to consider a person relatively skilled in the application of Stoic practices.   I am not saying the blogger does not practice Stoic principles, or fails to support the tradition, I just have a personal crusade regarding action vs. theory."
Stoicism,3c9ita,sikfoq,2,Tue Jul 7 18:41:22 2015 UTC,"I think that it is my opinion concerning such material, ideas, and writings. Many people are intimidated by stoic writing and interpretation. I am not a perfect Stoic practitioner, but believe to be further along than many. I just want to make the teachings more accessible to people.  On your thought on being special. I appreciate the input, I guess the point I meant to build to but left out would be just because you may think yourself to be special does not entitle you to anything. Just because you were told again and again that you are a princess or a prince, does not mean that anyone else view you as that.   And as an aggregate you may be right your specific traits, characteristics, attributes, experiences, and thoughts may make you unique. But I look at all of these on a spectrum, an ever evolving spectrum. Much like an RPG.   But the most important point you make is that people are no better or worse. To which I agree, I may think of myself to be more intelligent that my friends, that does not make me better than them.   But if I may ask a question, it is more of a thought experiment,   If everyone is special, no one is.    How would you defend approach this statement?"
Stoicism,3c9ita,sikfoq,2,Mon Jul 6 21:17:20 2015 UTC,"""if everyone is special, no one is""   I don't consider that to be a valid statement in propositional form: Is everyone special? (non-question). Are people capable of being special -consistently or periodically? (possible) Is the quality of specialness a possible constant? (no).   ""If"" as a pre-condition does not produce a ""then"" as a consequence if ""everyone is special"" cannot be a question in the 1st place.  Of course, what does it take to be ""special"" or unique? Perhaps that descriptor/qualifier does not work, and ""uncommon"" is the best way to characterize my personal brand."
Stoicism,3c9ita,yayfall,2,Tue Jul 7 18:37:24 2015 UTC,"Wow, that is an awesome analysis. Truly blown away, but I agree with you uncommon may be the best word simply because of the connotation of the other ones."

Stoicism,3c8c2q,steelfeel,11,Sun Jul 5 21:12:58 2015 UTC,"Step outside yourself, look at the world around you from the point of view of an alien anthropologist, or perhaps a benevolent (to humanity as a whole, rather than you in particular) spirit, but with the same values you have, the same ideas abount what the best outcome for the world as a whole would be. What would such an alien or spirit recommend?  Pushing it even further, write three letters, each letters from such a spirit, one for each choice,  each trying to persuade you that each choice is correct. After writing these, consider which is most convincing to you.  Imagine different outcomes from each choice. Imagine yourself as an old person in each outcome, looking back on your choice, and write your current self a letter of advice from your future possible selves.  In each case, remember that unhappy people are often destructive (or just as often ineffective) people, so sometimes the ideal choice for society for some ideal person may not be the best choice for you.   Consider this advice attributed (incorrectly, IIRC) to Aristotle: ""Happiness is the exercise of vital powers in an environment the offers them scope."" (An orthodox stoic would drop the ""influence of the environment..."" part). Figure our your own strengths of character, which virtues and vices you are most and least prone to. In which future are you best able to exercise your virtues? Fall victim to your vices? (Look up the self-tests by Seligman et al. here to provide food for thought.)  Read and reflect on this essay.   Pick a handful of characters, real or fictional, whose wisdom or judgement you admire, and write yourself a letter of advice from each.  Yes, this is all a lot of work. Its a big choice, though, so its worth some reflection. I find writing essential to forcing myself to organize my thoughts, and provide input for analysis.  Edit: to explicitly call out a common themes here: force yourself to shift perspective to a variety of perspectives not your own, and write. I find both, in combination, significantly help me make better decisions, particularly where the criteria for success are ill defined."

For when Vespasian sent and commanded him not to go into the senate, he replied, ""It is in your power not to allow me to be a member of the senate, but so long as I am, I must go in."" ""Well, go in then,"" says the emperor, ""but say nothing."" ""Do not ask my opinion, and I will be silent."" ""But I must ask your opinion."" ""And I must say what I think right.""

You will do your part, and I will do mine: it is your part to kill; it is mine to die, but not in fear: yours to banish me; mine to depart without sorrow.""   Seneca's Of Peace of Mind ch 4:  Could you anywhere find a miserable city than that of Athens when it was being torn to pieces by the thirty tyrants? they slew thirteen hundred citizens, all the best men, and did not leave off because they had done so, but their cruelty became stimulated by exercise. In the city which possessed that most reverend tribunal, the Court of the Areopagus, which possessed a Senate, and a popular assembly which was like a Senate, there met daily a wretched crew of butchers, and the unhappy Senate House was crowded with tyrants. A state, in which there were so many tyrants that they would have been enough to form a bodyguard for one, might surely have rested from the struggle; it seemed impossible for men's minds even to conceive hopes of recovering their liberty, nor could they see any room for a remedy for such a mass of evil: for whence could the unhappy state obtain all the Harmodiuses it would need to slay so many tyrants? Yet Socrates was in the midst of the city, and consoled its mourning Fathers, encouraged those who despaired of the republic, by his reproaches brought rich men, who feared that their wealth would be their ruin, to a tardy repentance of their avarice, and moved about as a great example to those who wished to imitate him, because he walked a free man in the midst of thirty masters. However, Athens herself put him to death in prison, and Freedom herself could not endure the freedom of one who had treated a whole band of tyrants with scorn: you may know, therefore, that even in an oppressed state a wise man can find an opportunity for bringing himself to the front, and that in a prosperous and flourishing one wanton insolence, jealousy, and a thousand other cowardly vices bear sway. We ought therefore, to expand or contract ourselves according as the state presents itself to us, or as Fortune offers us opportunities: but in any case we ought to move and not to become frozen still by fear: nay, he is the best man who, though peril menaces him on every side and arms and chains beset his path, nevertheless neither impairs nor conceals his virtue: for to keep oneself safe does not mean to bury oneself."

It is within our power to shape the society that we live in and we should therefore not be passive (for we are here not to be passive, but to act). Don't get into a fight, but show them what's right and what's wrong - they themselves obviously don't know.

I believe stoics would try to do something to directly stop the unfair action, so long as they are convinced their action would help.   If person A is stealing $10 everyday from person B's drawer and I know about it, then I would do something to directly stop that. It could be letting person B know, or talking with person A first to get him to understand the wrongness of his actions.   As Marcus says, "" All these things happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what is good and evil.""  If it is in my capability, I would try to get person A to understand his wrongdoing, but also get person B to understand it as well(maybe he's agreed to lending person A money but that person is just taking complete advantage of the guy's generosity)."
Stoicism,3c4ktl,daruki,3,Sat Jul 4 20:47:45 2015 UTC,"Stoicism is about accepting what you can't control, changing what you can, and acting virtuously.  I don't see anything virtuous about doing nothing because ""the victim is allowing themselves to be hurt""."
Stoicism,3c4ktl,Echospite,2,Sun Jul 5 08:01:11 2015 UTC,"This is exactly the dilemma that Socrates/Plato outlines in the dialogues with Meno. There Meno argues that all virtues are representation of the same thing (God?); Socrates lists the four cardinal virtues (Wisdom, Courage, Temperance (self-control) and Justice), and says that they are often in conflict and even contradictory. you can not have the both ways at the same time. You simply cannot stay in control if you want to be just, and you can not be just if you want to keep it under control.   From the Stoic perspective, I like the idea that moral follows nature. if you think you can fix it, then you morally must. if you think you can't, then remember that impossible is never obligatory."
Stoicism,3c4ktl,lmrx,2,Sun Jul 5 18:58:56 2015 UTC,"Right... But what about the example of Cato and the nature of man as a reasoning actor also suggests that if your non-action makes you complicit in injustice - even to a slight degree you are a slave who's freedom is forfeit.  It seems to me (possibly as a result if Irvine's reading if the stoics, possibly because of the popularity of stoicism as another self help shtick, possibly something else) we get way to focused on tranquility and not enough in freedom and arete (I'm liking the word virtue less and less these days).  So, if non-action makes you complicit action is obligatory.... But not anger or indignance about the injustice.  I think maybe HD Thoreau's Cynic Transcendentalism helps us here when he discusses the duties of a citizen of a democratic state and the moral duty to engage in civil disobedience lest your freedom is surrendered.  Moreover, I do not see how self control is sacrificed by ANY action you would take - at least not for a stoic for whom the only things over which you maintain control are internals.  Indeed, temperance - for stoics - seems like the one that is never in contradiction with any of the others.  Can you come up with an example?"
Stoicism,3c4ktl,StoicBeCuZ,2,Sun Jul 5 20:39:51 2015 UTC,Be more specific. What do you mean by:    You see someone doing something unfair/bad to someone else.

It would make sense that she would focus there in general but the effectiveness of her methods are more than questionable. As a moderator of r/stoicism I am concerned about the censorship and the corporatization. In the end, reddit is a platform, if it falls out of favor like many before it, the community will just shift. What is important in the end is arete (personal excellence) and tranquility.

Stoicism,3c5js6,phoenixvictory,10,Mon Jul 6 01:59:00 2015 UTC,"I view reddit as I look at any business that provides a venue for socialization. The closest ""real life"" examples would be bars, clubs, and some coffee shops.   Reddit is like a very large bar with nicely organized space and furniture, plenty of space for side-parties and private functions, little or no service (no or very few waiters or bar tenders), bouncers that have historically done the minimum necessary to avoid damage to the property or being shut down by the police. Consequently, it has a (mostly well deserved) reputation as a place where some really despicable things go on.  Recently, the bouncers have gotten more active. This has made a lot of people upset, but hay, it isn't their bar.    Now, the management abruptly fired the popular and apparently (from an outside point of view) very professional music director (trying to maintain the analogy with the bar) with no transition plan. This leads me to some head scratching abount what the management is thinking.  Now, when the management of a business starts behaving erratically, it's pretty reasonable for customers to start keeping an eye on alternatives, even if the erratic behavior didn't effect them directly yet.  Ultimately, a community is about the people, not the site that hosts them. If there is a change of venue, the community will of course shift as well: some members will not make  the transition, new ones will arrive, some conversational styles are more suited to some venues than others. Shifts in community are inevitable anyway, though. The regulars here now are not the same group as were here a year ago, who were not the same as two years ago.  Edit: None of this is really related to Stoicism itself, though."

As far as I know about the banned subreddits, if banning them meant the end of reddit, the end of reddit would be well-deserved.

Uh, except that it does. Actually, I'm not being accurate: it says to take whatever the world throw at us with a smile and thankful for it, since it is God's will.

It roughly translates as ""prove your words with things"", that is with your actions.  The test of philosophy (what we might now call ""spiritual teachings"") is not speaking eloquently about the good life but in one's actions, in leading a wise and virtuous life.  Ancient philosophers took it further: since philosophy was about living well not waxing poetically, one's philosophical principles could be disproven by acting in such a way that contradicted them. This was not considered an ""ad hominem"" because the proof was in the pudding, not in the ideas.  The Christian gospel of Matthew puts it similarly: ""by their fruit you will recognize them."" Who? The false prophets who merely appear to be teaching the way to live (the gospel), but are really just hucksters, wolves in sheep's clothing, abusive gurus and late night infomercial salesmen. Good trees bear good fruit, and bad trees poisonous bad fruit.  I think this basic idea may still have a lot of relevance to our times.

The idea, I think, is that by having constant stoic thoughts you will eventually have more stoic action. That's my opinion anyway.   As for what I'd put on a stoic wristband?

The friends in your example might be content, but are they doing to duty to work for the common good? Are they helping others? Are they following the dictates of reason? No, because they are attached to their sloth.

Stoicism,3blx7n,duffstoic,7,Tue Jun 30 18:10:30 2015 UTC,"That is an interesting question. In my opinion, one important thing in Stoicism (and many philosophies, I guess) is an underlying desire for self-improvement. Is not only the desire for contentment (which is part of it) but also to live a virtuous life. According to a common definition of virtue, consisting of justice, self-discipline, courage and wisdom, it is not difficult to foresee situations in which you have to leave your confort zone to do what you think is the right thing. Stoicism claims that by doing so we will eventually be more content than if we just take the shortcut of self-indulgence, as it seems to be the scenario that you depict. At the core of it all, I think there is the desire for living a life worth living. Then it depends what everybody means by it.  For what you say of your friends seems that they focused on the part of not being distressed by externals events, but may have forgotten others such as self-discipline, which according to Stoicism, may decrease their satisfaction with life in the long run. Hope this adds something useful to the discussion. Looking forward to hear from others!"

As I have learned (...or misinterpreted), in order to gain contentment you ought to change your own view on the matter, granted you have NO CONTROL on the matter. But, if you have control, and the desire, you do your duty. In this exact scenario its not even a duty... it's... common sense. The shock for me came because having fairly mastered desire (because I viewed it as a source of trouble), I stumbled in a place where lack of desire was overwhelming, and the results were damn shocking.

It is not excellence as a human being to lie around in filth and do nothing in one's power to change it.  In the Discourses, Epictetus repeatedly encourages his students to give up desire and to direct aversion away from things that are not in our control to things that are. But the point of this was not mere contentment -- that is an Epicurean ideal -- but that of directing our attention to living well by completely giving up desire to control that which is not ours to control or avoid that which we cannot help but encounter.  Your friends are neglecting that which is within the sphere of choice -- the ability to tidy up, clean the dishes, and otherwise exercise their power and responsibility. That is not Stoicism!! Accepting 100% what is not in our power, we are freed to aggressively act upon that which is in our power. Stoicism is emphatically not a passive philosophy when it comes to that which is up to us! It is only passive with regards to that which is not up to us."

I think it was Epictetus, see this comment by /u/jumpstartation (only place I could find this on Reddit):   We should keep these verses at hand to put them to practical use, and not merely use them by way of exclamation, as when we cry, 'Paean Apollo!'* And again, when in a fever, we should have the judgements at hand that apply to that; let’s make sure, if we’re struck by a fever, that we don’t cast all of that aside and forget it, saying, ‘If I return to philosophy again, let things come about as they will,’ and go away somewhere to take care of our poor body. Won’t the fever go there too? But to practise philosophy, what does that mean? Isn’t it to prepare oneself to face every eventuality? Don’t you understand, then, that what you’re saying amount to something like this: ‘If I ever again prepare myself to face every eventuality with equanimity, let things come about as they will’? It is as if someone were to withdraw from the pancration because he has received some blows! Though in the pancration, it is possible to withdraw from the contest and so escape a beating, but in our case, if we were to abandon philosophy, what good would that do us? What should a philosopher say, then, in the face of each of the hardships of life? ‘It is for this that I’ve been training myself; it is for this that I was practising.’ God says to you, ‘Give me proof of whatever you’ve competed in accordance with the rules, whether you’ve followed the proper diet, carried out the proper exercises, and have obeyed your trainer.’ And then, when the time comes for you to act, will you quail? Now is the moment to suffer a fever; may it proceed as it should; to undergo thirst, may you undergo it in the right spirit; to undergo hunger, may you undergo it in the right spirit. Isn’t that within your power? Who can prevent you? Yes, a doctor may prevent you from drinking, but he can’t prevent you from bearing thirst in the right way; he may prevent you from eating, but he can’t prevent you from facing hunger in the right way.   —Epictetus, Discourses 3.10.1-9  Link to this section of the Discourses"

I had a loss and I emailed William Irvine about it. I'll paraphrase him here: what would your friend want you to do? Would he want you to be miserable or would he want you to be happy?  Your grief honors the dead, and later your happy memories will honor the dead.

At another, he reckons up the pains of mortal life and claims that, were we offered it as a gift instead of being thrust into it, we would decline. In either case, life, properly regarded, is only a journey toward death. We wrongly say that the old and sick are ""dying,"" when infants and youths are doing so just as certainly.

Having said this, with regards to the passage in the link and modern work, which is often very alienating and, as people have argued in different places, separates oneself from their ""species character"" (in that it isn't done as freely conscious activity under their own control but is often a regimented process within which they are only one of many inputs subject to external control), how should we view this? In my mind, I'm not sure that the average worker getting up in the morning should view life in a cubicle as being similar to what the birds and the ants are doing, and do not feel that that sort of life is what ""nature demands"". So while I agree with the logic of Marcus in general, I do not believe that a genuine Stoic interpretation of that philosophy is to gleefully head into the office for another day of wasting away one's short life."

I'm a moderately driven person, though, and I'll always be working towards my goals in life, and those goals are my purpose. The job I work is due to a desire to reach my goals.

The Stoics divide emotions into two classes, impressions (sometimes ""feelings"") and passions. See here. Impressions are emotions that happen to you, so trying to control them is a mistake, but passions are the result of your judgements, your beliefs about good and bad. These judgments are explicitly listed as things ""under your control"". The English translation is a little misleading here. The Stoics did not mean that changing is easy. What they meant is that what needs to change in order to change the emotion is yourself, your own character or personality. (Edit: see this FAQ entry.)  They recognized that changing your character is tremendously difficult. They did not seem to advocate trying to do so through force of will alone, but rather reason and exercise; see the books and articles on exercises listed in the FAQ."

You rather observe and take the impression of what is happening towards your feeling (I.e. Growing anger).   To not get affected by the exterior I use to analyze the situation towards my favor by being patient and think ""he must have a hard day"", ""you don't know his/her pain, that led her/him to do this"".  The most important thing is the ""letting go"" where you don't trigger passion and confine yourself in the present. As soon as you ""let go"", other feelings and capturing thoughts will take place.

Obviously this is something you want, but know that no matter what happens you can be happy. If you don't get the job you might be disappointed at first, but soon you'll probably feel the same as you always did.

SO make sure your work is good enough, so that you can confidently stand behind it, and if they hoe in with unwarranted or harsh criticism call them on it. Even if you don't like confrontation, don't allow yourself to be steamrollered. Even saying ""I think that criticism is harsh and unwarranted"" lets them know they're out of line.  From a more Stoic perpective, you're doing this for YOU not for THEM. The goal is not to get your advisor to pass your work - your goal is to do the best possible job that you can on your work because presumably this is something you're passionate about, given that you're doing a PhD in it !!  So work to your own very best standards and ignore what your advisor thinks. When you have produced work that you are happy with, they can go whistle.  If worst comes to worst make a formal complaint to your University and ask for another advisor. If you are confident in your work and they're being a dick, let them deal with the consequences of their own intransigence.  Tl:dr The goal is to produce work to your own satisfaction - to produce work that you are proud of; not to produce work that your advisor will ""pass"". Work hard for your own satisfaction.

I was looking to see things with indifference, accepting situations as they were and doing my best to be a good student. I even was content for a little while. I too was in the grasps of a thesis supervisor that was less than compromising and downright bitchy. I had a low paying academic job (research assistant) and I wanted to do my best at being an humble little employee/student.   In my mind, I absolutely had to finish my phd to get the job I dreamed of...  Frankly, I was pretty much dying inside. I was content but not thriving. I was doing ""o.k."".  Looking back, I see that period of my life as being very ""gray""...  I went to Paris and it hit me like a ton of brick: when something isn't growing, it is basically dying and that is exactly what was happening to me. I was ""settling"" and ""accepting"", being relatively tranquil but man, I'm just too ""alpha"" for that shit!  I basically said fuck it! I left academia and that puffed up, egoic and basically useless world behid. I got back into business, signed the biggest deal I ever had and got a job offer that I couldn't refuse, earning more than twice what I had ever managed... I got back into shape both physically and emotionnaly, set out ""outside of my control"" objectives and frankly, even if I miss most of them, I don't care because it gives me juice and I LOVE the man I've become and the man those outside things kind of forces me to become.   So you know what, I hope you look at your present situation and say: fuck that! Accepting things and doing your best might work but why put unnecessary burdens on your path? Academic work is always like that: you think your advisor is a stuck up bitch? You'll stumbled upon even worst for sure. What makes you think it will get better? You want to give it an honnest try but why exactly? What are the values that are driving your behavior?  I'll probably get downvoted into oblivion with this but sometimes, stoicism as it is somehow put forth in here or in other books is very passive and lacks the energy that some of these old sage probably had... I think you need to want to improve yourself as much as you starve for oxygen to be a successfull person, no matter how you define success (being virtuous, tranquil) but in my case, having very defined external goals just motivates me better than trying to be virtuous as my mind doesn't seem to grasp that concept and make it real enough to drive me through boring days...

Zen pushes the idea that everything is connected, like two sides of a coin. You can't just have one side of a coin, that doesn't make sense! It's quite an interesting idea to sit and think about. You can apply it to quite a lot. I'm only the person I am because of other people who shaped me. In that regard, they're as much a part of me as myself. It can lead you to appreciate things more."

Stoicism,3bbrlj,uftone1,26,Sat Jun 27 18:31:40 2015 UTC,"Being ""attracted to Stoicism"" and meeting Stoic ideals are very different things. Stoic study, at least as practised by Epictetus and other late Stoics, is primarily about self-improvement; a Stoic sage has no use for Stoicism.  I find the analogy with athletics most useful. It is the sedentary couch-potato who has the most to gain from exercise.   It also makes sense to work on particular weaknesses. Just as everyone does, I have strengths and weaknesses of character. So, I work hardest on my weaknesses in Stoic exercises, and play to my strengths in ""real life"", just as an athlete would in athletic training and competition. Even after my training, my weaknesses are still weaknesses, just not as bad as they would be otherwise.   Someone who took a snapshot of my life now might conclude that the Stoic exercises made me worse- after all, the things I work on are the things on which I am weakest. This would be to confuse cause and effect, though. The same could be done with aspirin and headaches: if I look at all people who have recently taken aspirin, I would bet I would find an above-average proportion of people with headaches. One shouldn't conclude, though, that aspirin causes headaches.  Like physical training, it is very easy to start off too ambitious, to try to much too fast. This increases both the likelihood of discouragement and the chance of self-injury. Things like the collection of practices in Stoic week are great... for a week. Long term, I prefer picking one practice, working hard at it until it becomes natural, until it feels unnatural to skip it, until the habit has proven it can survive major disruptions in your routine (vacation, illness, a new job, etc.). Only then, add another.   As far as details of practices goes, several of the Stoic inspired exercises by the Stoic Week folk involve visualization. Personally, I find it much easier to maintain focus on the topic if, instead of just sitting there and ""visualizing"", I write, maybe with a clock with a chime every minute.  As far as setting low or high goals goes, I find it helps to look at the whole question differently. Instead of setting goals concerning results, set goals concerning process. In practice, make your goal be to follow the practice, stopping to assess if the process is working every few months. In day to day life, make it your goal to be a virtuous/good person right now, in the the present moment. You can worry about the next moment when it comes.  That's not so ambitious, is it?  Eternity is nothing more than a sequence of moments strung together."

Looking at virtue, and finding out what is virtuous, I think it is helpful to consider opposites. Imagine a great sin- and then imagine its opposite.   Some aspects I've explored.  -7 deadly sins and the 7 corresponding virtues  and  -The Buddhist Paramitas, or perfections   -This is a great discourse on Karma given by the Buddha, that goes into the effects, both in this life and the next, of the whole range of virtuous and unvirtuous behaviors.   And this, although on the surface is focused on gaining wealth, is a fantastic treatise on virtues that lead to prosperity, by Ben Franklin.   I think one of the best ways to develop virtue, is by self reflection. One of the exercises given by Rudolf Steiner, called 'retrospection', is a process of viewing the days events, but in reverse. By viewing yourself as you go through the day- in reverse- you see in your minds eye, a chain of causality- and begin to grasp the meaning of events and actions in your life. You can replay scenes and imagine how you could have improved, and see what habits and deeds would come to good fruition. The very act of seeing yourself from the outside, in your mind, impresses a self awareness and to some extent I think automatically develops virtue- because wisdom begins to ripen in your mind as you consider and meditate on your conduct and choices."

The soul is always happy, never depressed, except when it gets attached to the body, and material things.

It's all round.   The direct denial that any of these things (anything at all external to the self) is evil at all is so central to Stoicism, I think, that it's hard to see how this objection to Stoicism has anything to do with Logos; someone who believes these things are evils should have much bigger objections to Stoicism than the mere question of God. It isn't like the declaration that these things are indifferent was something added on in a attempt to rescue or explain the concept of Logos. This declaration is if anything more central to Stoicism than belief in Logos itself. Put differently, I think an atheist who denies that these or any other external things are evil is much closer to historical Stoicism than a theist who believes these things are evils (although neither would be considered Stoic at all by historical standards, I think).   Of course, these things are all typically considered ""unpreferred"" indifferents, and the question of why a divine logos would include them did come up; this is largely the topic of Seneca's On Providence.   edit: This doesn't mean that the question of Logos isn't problematic. Our understanding of physical science has come a long way in the past ~2300 years, and I think the idea that the order of the universe requires something analogous to human forethought and planning (as implied by the idea of divine providence) is well past its sell-by date. Whether the universe can be said to be conscious is a little different; panprotopsychism is as plausible an account for the origin of awareness as any alternatives I am aware of (that is, not very), but I don't see the computational machinery that would make planning or forethought an element of it."

Certainly there is no malice in nature, a better word would be ""harm"", or as you mentioned further down ""unpreferred"" indifferents. But boy, there's some really terrible indifferent ""semblance of appearances"" out there.  I just don't see how the natural world all around us can be described as ""well ordered"".

Stoicism,3b3wbm,KlugerHans,3,Fri Jun 26 01:23:41 2015 UTC,"What could possibly be meant by a ""terrible indifferent""?  Also, I don't think the Stoic rationale in arguing that externals can neither good nor evil was really motivated by theology; Zeus, Logos, etc. were generally not mentioned in their arguments for this position, or related Stoic inspired modern positions. (Indeed, modern people who self-identify as Stoics often seem to be atheists, although I think this has more to do with theistic modern people having a stronger tendency to self-identify according to their religious beliefs rather than their Stoic ones, even when they are equivalently influenced by Stoicism.)  For a rather modernized take (more inspired by classical Stoicism than a repetition of it), think about the purpose of normative judgements (good/evil, better/worse, even preferred/unpreferred). The purpose of the concepts involved (good/evil etc) is to allow the user to make judgements concerning what action to take, what decisions to make. Normative concepts that have influence beyond that-- any evaluative judgements that influence you more than needed for you to make an optimal choice-- are unnecessary, and if they influence you to make bad choices (which is often true when the normative judgements themselves cause strong emotional reactions), the concepts used are defective. The voluntary use of such concepts when such judgements cause distress, when negative evaluative judgements of things that are not options in choices you have to make, is masochistic. To use such concepts is to use a defective tool, one that is sub-optimal for achieving its purpose and inflicts pain on its user.  Hence, the terminology preferred and unpreferred: the level of influence of the normative judgement needs to extend far enough that the one making the judgement makes optimal decisions, and no further.   I just don't see how the natural world all around us can be described as ""well ordered"".    The universe is extremely well ordered, just not from the typical  perspective of humans in daily life. The basic laws that govern nature (physics, chemistry, etc.) are both mathematically simple and apply universally to a boggling level of perfection. (edit: Of course, this actually argues more against than for a psychologically anthropomorphic deity, and in any case has nothing to do with the moral argument and the ""problem of evil"".)   I bet that if the ancients had our knowledge of evolution and the crippling diseases and conditions that are a by-product of it, they would be singing a different tune.   If anything, I think the ancients had a far better appreciation of the pain in life than those of us in modern times with resources sufficient to do things like post on reddit. By historical standards, even modern standards of the world as a whole, most of us live very luxurious lives. This may part of the historical appeal of Stoicism; with all the challenges posed by day to day life, they could do without those caused by defective notions of good and bad.  edit: grammar"
Stoicism,3b3wbm,cleomedes,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:37:36 2015 UTC,"What could possibly be meant by a ""terrible indifferent""?   I gave you several general and specific examples of natural evil. These are harms. They're only indifferent because they are not in your control.   The fact that many are gratuitous adds weight against a well ordered cosmos.   The universe is extremely well ordered, just not from the typical perspective of humans in daily life.   Nature is ""red in tooth and claw"" not just for humans, but for all living things.    The basic laws that govern nature (physics, chemistry, etc.) are both mathematically simple and apply universally to a boggling level of perfection   Perfection? What about biology?

They're only indifferent because they are not in your control.    This directly contradicts the assertion that they are indifferent. The Stoic assertion that they are indifferent is not just some weird gratuitous redefinition of the word ""indifferent"" to mean ""not in your control;"" the assertion has substantive meaning. They meant that it is a mistake to think them bad, evil, harmful, terrible, etc., or make any other kind of normative judgement concerning them beyond what is necessary to choose one thing rather than another.    Perfection? What about biology?   Biology is just a side-effect of physics. All of the atoms in our bodies follow the laws of physics, apparently to perfection. This is a far greater order and perfection than what was envisioned by theological explanations (Stoic or otherwise)."

That sounds like a rigged game. Atoms follow the laws of physics. What's physics? Physics describes the motions of atoms. Anyways, biology is far from perfect. Ask any medical doctor or anatomist.   MAAA says:   We ought to observe also that even the things which follow after the things which are produced according to nature contain something pleasing and attractive. For instance, when bread is baked some parts are split at the surface, and these parts which thus open, and have a certain fashion contrary to the purpose of the baker's art, are beautiful in a manner, and in a peculiar way excite a desire for eating. And again, figs, when they are quite ripe, gape open; and in the ripe olives the very circumstance of their being near to rottenness adds a peculiar beauty to the fruit. And the ears of corn bending down, and the lion's eyebrows, and the foam which flows from the mouth of wild boars, and many other things- though they are far from being beautiful, if a man should examine them severally- still, because they are consequent upon the things which are formed by nature, help to adorn them, and they please the mind; so that if a man should have a feeling and deeper insight with respect to the things which are produced in the universe, there is hardly one of those which follow by way of consequence which will not seem to him to be in a manner disposed so as to give pleasure.   Now, I don't know why the emperor thought lions had ugly eyebrows, but it sounds to me like if you added some human vestigal organ to the list, this would be the stoic response to the issue. Sure, maybe on it's own it looks bad, but in the proper context, you can see how it is the result of beautiful principles."

But I think most people could easily come up with better ideas to improve the cosmos. How about creating the world and everything in it in six days, rather than hundreds of millions of years of unnecessary pain, suffering and death?  Darwin made everybody think about that one."

They usually tackle moral evil (people doing bad things) because it's easy to refute; Free will. Natural evil they avoid like the plague, no pun intended.  The New Testament scholar Bart Ehrman wrote about it a few years ago, explaining all the justifications and why he finds them unsatisfactory.  http://www.amazon.com/Gods-Problem-Answer-Important-Question-Why/dp/0061173924  In fact it was this problem that resulted in him de-converting. It wasn't the scriptural ""variances"" that he is famous for writing about, but the simple, everyday problem of evil notably phrased by Epicurus.  “Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?”"
Stoicism,3b3wbm,KlugerHans,2,Fri Jun 26 00:32:37 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you are confusing 'divine logos' with divine providence?  If not then maybe the following can help. You have of course to try and make sense of things metaphorically.   So logos is an active 'fiery' principle which is found in living beings. Fiery because that is the most active of the four elements. It is also Zeus himself, (or Apollo in his chariot crossing the heavens, i.e., the sun,) and it is in every man, for Zeus has given every man a particle of his fiery self. In man this fire may be spoken of as his divine soul. This soul of his, is also his mind or his reason, or as Anaxagoras called it nous. Logos, then, is thought and speech, it has to do with words and language. Without logos in the universe there can be no objects / forms. So look into Plato's ideas / forms / archetypes also. Without this active fiery principle there is literally nothing; everything is together at once and nothing is differentiated. So there is just one great mass of indistinguishable passive stuff awaiting the arrival of active logos and when that happens the world and everything therein appears. When active logos interacts / reacts with this passive stuff, men awaken from their slumbers into the world. They become conscious of trees, of animals, of men and women, of mountains, of rivers, etc., etc.. It is very important."

Could it not just be a case of ""Sour grapes"" ?  From the Wiki entry, for those unfamiliar;  ""The Fox and the Grapes is one of the Aesop's fables, numbered 15 in the Perry Index.[1] The narration is concise and subsequent retellings have often been equally succinct. The story concerns an anthropomorphized fox that tries to eat grapes from a vine but cannot reach them. Rather than admit defeat, it denies they are desirable in a rationalisation that has been identified with cognitive dissonance."""
Stoicism,3b3wbm,KlugerHans,3,Fri Jun 26 16:14:47 2015 UTC,I don't think anybody truly knows the complete answer to your question. The Stoics denied good and evil but then they introduced the previously unheard of terms 'preferred indifferent' and 'dispreferred indifferent' in their stead.

I want to be happy, not indifferent. That's not unreasonable for me to ask. That's why I've been sort of fading away from stoicism, because it stops making me happy and makes me neutral. And neutral is a fine line before something bad happens to me and I happen to not deal with it in a very stoic way. I want to be happy so that when something bad happens to me I'm just less happy, but not sad."

I shouldn't have to imagine her dying a gruesome death to appreciate her. Me being a good and virtuous man doesn't really make me happy. Helping and supporting others does. Being successful to be able to provide for my family does. Having a big group of friends does. And stoicism doesn't advocate for diving boldly headfirst into life but rather cautious, timid steps (""Life is more like wrestling than dancing"" Marcus Aurelius)   It's just such a ghastly paranoid philosophy to imagine things going wrong at any moment. I don't want to live my life imagining what could go wrong, but rather imagining what could go right.  But I thank you for your perspective."

While we wait for the ship we can walk along the shore and enjoy the sights: maybe find some interesting shells to examine and enjoy. But when the captain calls we should eagerly leave them behind and return to the ship.  I have an 8-year old daughter. I take joy in her every day; her sense of humour, her amazing wisdom, her unique perspective. But ultimately I know we'll be parted. Worst case, she could get sick and die. Best case she will one day move out of the house and live her own life. If I am elated by her presence, I will certainly be disappointed by her absence: I will suffer. So I choose not to suffer. I take joy in the lot that I've been given while anticipating that it will be gone some day because that's the nature of the thing.  I think joy is a Stoic virtue. It comes from being mindful of the nature of things. My daughter is mortal: she will surely die. I am my daughter's father: she will surely leave the house and start her own life that will only peripherally involve me. This is the way it should be, I accept that it is good. And that leaves me able to fully enjoy the time that I have with her rather than worry about the future or pine for the past."

You want life to be all sugar and no salt? What kind of life is that? What kind of life is it where all you feel is saccharine over-saturated joy that you never understand the value of because you've never suffered?   For me stoicism is for the people who have already chosen defeat, merely by entertaining the idea to begin with. There are other ways to view the world around us. And I will not bottle my emotions, even suffering, in the pursuit of a philosophy that my core values don't agree with. I will suffer, and I will feel joy at times too, neither of which make me weak or strong, but both of which make me happy."

As far as them never realizing the true value of happiness because they do not indulge in anguish as much, I think that's a very subjective matter and impossible to tell. Certainly, I don't think stoicism excludes one from feeling the highest elevations life can offer. In fact, the Stoic will be able to feel higher elevations more often because she takes contentment in simple things.   Stoics cannot eliminate suffering entirely, but they have found a way to minimize it. They feel ""proto-passions"" but don't let them grow into monsters. Ironically, the cynism that suffering cannot be overcome or eliminated is what a Stoic would naturally expect and learn to accept. They aren't sages; just humans doing their best to cope with a cruel world.  As dmogle said, though, we can agree to disagree and I wish you well in your own approaches to life."

For something to get you the general ideas quickly, there are a few resources on the web that you might find interesting, particularly (copied from the FAQ):   Our own Stoicism FAQ. Donald Robertson's blog has several useful introductory posts, including The System of Stoic Philosophy (edit: this one is pretty abstract), A Simplified Modern Approach to Stoicism, and An Introduction to Stoic Practice: The Three Disciplines of Stoicism. The Stoic Philosophy is a transcript of a 1915 lecture by Gilbert Murray. Captains of the Soul by Michael Evans is a short overview specifically tailored for members of the military. Stoic Week's 2014 Handbook, 2013 Handbook and 2012 Living the Stoic Life booklet   It also may help to notice which specific Stoic works interest him. The three most commonly read authors (Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, Seneca) can come off very differently. Maybe start off by trying to read what he is reading; the basic works are usually pretty short (but also very easy to misinterpret).

Stoicism,3az5fc,robosarous,2,Wed Jun 24 17:49:57 2015 UTC,It's a good enough lecture for beginnings. But the lecturer interprets Stockdale's stories from Vietnam to indicate that Stoics have made a mistake by saying virtue is sufficient: the lecturer believes that supportive social relations are also necessary for living the good life.
Stoicism,3az5fc,0149,2,Wed Jun 24 20:28:37 2015 UTC,"I also thought it was rather terrible, its overview is passable, but the fact that she brushes off some of the consequences of stoic thoughts consequences with a ""I dont like it"" is laughable and sad for a Yale lecture, if you want to criticise stoicism you have to look at the base assumptions we make and point out where we err, and then the consequences of those assumption changes will lead to new end results"
Stoicism,3az5fc,rDuck,2,Thu Jun 25 08:52:27 2015 UTC,"I don't agree. I think you can criticize stoicism based on its consequences. The fact that those consequences contradict many people's very strong and basic views on life are a good indication that there is something wrong with stoicism. It would be somewhat better if such criticism would point out the reasons (and thus perhaps the basic assumptions) why those consequences are wrong, but that is not always possible.   It is a standard technique of criticizing a theory in moral philosophy to point out that the consequences of a theory are wrong. For example, it is very difficult to argue against consequentialism, looking at its assumptions, but looking at its implications (it may require you to kill innocent people to save a greater number of people) show that it cannot be right (or at least so think many people).  The point is that many theories are (intentionally or not) complicated, and the link between conclusions and base assumptions is obfuscated. For me personally, some parts of stoicism that I find valuable pertain to its arguments, some to its basic assumptions about human nature, and some to its conclusions on how to live your life.   But I do not follow stoicism because I somehow agree with all its base assumptions, then follow through a line of strict logic, and consequently come up with a clear set of rules on how to live my life. I think if you really believe this process is true, you are just deceiving yourself with a set of post hoc rationalizations."

The category of the impression is something somewhat contested throughout the Stoic tradition. Chrysippus--in some contrast with his Stoic elders--argued that the Stoic person is capable of receiving multiple impulses.

The important thing is that the Stoic consider his ""assent"" carefully. Assent entails an opinion, including an opinion from a Stoic perspective."

It looks like this was as small and cheap as I could make it.  The typography was lovingly crafted in InDesign to maximize readability at small sizes, all with the goal of getting the book to be as small and pocketable as possible. I modeled the fonts, leading, etc., on a Bible I had handy. I went with Lulu over Amazon, CafePress, or other self-publishers because they offered the smallest size book. It's around 4.5x6, so it can fit in a back pocket or, more easily, into a coat pocket.

While I think this a beautiful definition, popular usage does not differentiate.

Stoicism,3awxxu,jimstride,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:13:24 2015 UTC,"I find the only sad thing about this article to be Mr. Holiday's perspective on it.  For such a prominent spokesman for stoicism to espouse such antiintellectualism is tragic indeed.  Philosophy, even for the ancient stoics, consisted of both theory and practice, and a formal understanding of theory was required in order to act virtuously.  ""Theory, which teaches how one should act, is related to application and comes first, since it is not possible to do anything really well unless its practical execution is in harmony with theory."" - Musonius Rufus.  Even Epictetus - the most outspoken in his derision for philosophical discourse acknowledged the importance pedagogically of pushing the hardest theoretical parts of stoicism as written by Chryssipius.  Chryssipius himself did much work on logics and ontology (the existence of things... um... like race for instance). Yet, I get the impression that Mr. Holiday wants us to believe that this is not philosophy or relevant to what philosophy is.  To quote justice Scalia: pure applesauce.  If reactions which aren't virtuous arise from irrational or incorrect ideas, is it not important to have those ideas are critically interrogated and found to be sound such that we know what we know and do not know about them?  This seems obvious to me, and it was clearly obvious to Musonius and Epictetus.  Seneca and Aurelius give a more mixed picture, and the Greeks are clearly on the side of theory.  Related to this precise article - consider ones reaction to the NAACP controversy.  If you react towards this issue with derision and criticism due to Ms. Dolezal's perceived misrepresentation, is it no important to know whether or not it was - in fact - a misrepresentation?  What you call 'race' matters for your reaction.  Are you not unjust if you react on the basis of an understanding of the subject that is in opposition to the nature of the thing?  I would say so.  Clearly.  I often feel that Mr. Holiday wants us to believe (and perhaps he does - in my view - naively believe) that these 'intellectual issues' are irrelevant (unless, of course, he writes about them, then they are important.  He is a marketing guy after all.. gotta sell books!) and that his oft-stated yet seemingly woefully uninformed disdain for academics colors his views on the value of what academics have to say. In short, I see Mr. Holiday's thinking and argument on this matter and others as consistently biased by irrational emotional impulses because it seems patently obvious that philosophers and academics at large contribute to theory and our understanding of nature by focusing directly on tough problems, most of which have implications for our behavior.   How, exactly, could he argue otherwise?  It is as if he argues that having a PhD and making claims that contradict his common sense makes the work irrelevant and or stupid.  I am unprepared to give Mr. Holiday such intellectual authority.  I encourage all stoics to do the same.  When I asked him in an earlier thread what - exactly - his issues were with academics and philosophers he puerilely stated that they have tenure and such live a life that is a crime against stoicism.  Even if one overlooks Seneca's statements in favor of such intellectual retirement,  one wonders how exactly he squares this with the tenure of Marcus Aurelius as emperor for life.  Did he have to face life's hardships as a former slave like Epictetus?  Was he at the whim of market forces?  No, he was at the whim of the same forces that threaten academics (political, substantive, existential) and he - like many academics with tenure - chose to behave in a way that utilized that advantage to the good of his community.  That is virtue.  This article make me joyous, not sad, as it actually attacks what I see as one of the largest problems with the institution of academic philosophy and academics generally (though, definitively NOT the academics as individuals or the ideas that they develop), which is that the incentive structure and normative culture of academics does not encourage or reward those (at least not outside of high ranked private Liberal Arts and Science Colleges) who engage in scholarship to improve their own and the human condition.  I am in a position to know as I have worked as an academic in research universities, liberal arts colleges, and as a consultant and researcher in the private and international organizational sectors.  Academics in academia are tragically disincentivized from engaging the public and working through our their work is relevant.  This failure does NOT render their ideas necessarily irrelevant (though some might be), but simply inexplicit.  Not a terrible crime, but a shame nonetheless.  Meanwhile, in the private sector academics are encouraged to cut corners, and sacrifice truth and honesty for expediency and 'pragmatism'.  It's a tough problem we find ourselves in as followers of nature, when nature is so much more complicated than the ancients believed.  More tragic to me are the academics, who for all their knowledge, deploy it to not behave any more wisely.  Rather, many strive to be 'average joes'.  IT was not always so, as academics like ancient philosophers were viewed as rather eccentric because they lived the lessons of their scholarship.  I, as a stoic, strive to do so... but it makes me an odd duck.  KlugerHans points to another major and related problem not addressed in the article - the problem of interdisciplinary in academic work.  The expertise is often not all in the same room to deal with some of these complex problems.  For instance, I think philosophers can handle the relevant information for the NAACP case, but certainly cannot in the Climate Change case in the article.  The latter case is deeply complicated with difficult climate science, policy science, and ethics that all must weave together in mutually reinforcing ways to reach a conclusion.  The former does not require such sophisticated understanding. The empirical scholarship here is remarkably clean cut.  The climate change project is massive and deeply deeply consequential for our individual and collective behavior as stoics if we wish to act both prudently and justly in accordance with nature.  It is difficult for me to imagine any other institution than academia pulling together the necessary focus and breadth of expertise, but it will certainly require academics focused on each part of these complicated problems.    It will most definitively not be dilettantes like Ryan Holiday, who seem to have a rather exaggerated view of his own expertise, and a lack of humility for those which he knows little.... the strength of his consistent invective notwithstanding.  It takes more than cold showers, an entrepreneurial spirit, and a tough guy attitude to be a sage.  It also takes humility, understanding of difficult things, and a willingness to hear and find the good in all forms of wisdom.  tl;dr: Mr. Holiday misrepresents the importance of theory and academic work for stoics.  He does so for mysterious but possibly unstoic reasons.  Academics have problems that are directly addressed by this article and others (like KlugerHans): Lack of perspective on the practical relevance of their work and the necessity of interdisciplinary to understand the nature of certain problems.  Ryan Holiday should try develop a bit more humility and self-criticism if he is going to be a wise and just spokesman for (stoic) philosophy."

This article of yours displays the self-same lack of ""humility and self-criticism"" you attribute to Holiday.   I refer you to the so-called 'New Stoa', specifically their so-called 'College of Stoic Philosophers':   Academic philosophy emphasizes abstract intellectual problems and arcane conundrums that no one ever solves and no one ever wins. Stoic philosophy doesn't do that. It never did. Instead, it gives you the keys to living life well, in good times and bad.    In my own mind I have the idea that nothing good for humankind as a whole ever came out of academia. But maybe I'm being hard on the academic community!  Edit: I picked the following more or less at random: https://www.academia.edu/13144020/Free_Will_and_the_Divergence_Problem?auto=download&campaign=weekly_digest  How relevant is this sort-of jargon-filled nonsense to living well?

I would say you are being absurdly hard (and ungrateful ie: unjust) to the academic community.  In my response I'll start here:  your random choice was an unfortunate one: the paper is attempting to reconcile notions of free will, human control, and freedom with current understandings from physics about the nature of, well, nature,  in other words, it is directly relevant to stoic conceptions of choice and self control and an attempt to understand that choice in the context of the nature of the universe as we currently understand it.  I'm no expert In this field, mind you so I'm missing some of the subtleties, but I got that much from charitably and with humility giving the paper a reading.  Now, I'll grant you the language is difficult (Asian scholars often write prose that are particularly turgid in English, but I am so impressed by how much they contribute despite this), but that doesn't make it useless in itself or as a stepping stone towards something exceedingly useful.  Frankly reconciling psychology, philosophy of mind, and theoretical physics may require a bit more subtly of language than when we thought the whole world was made of a small number of elements and we thought the disease was caused by phantoms.    Socrates famously said that the Unexamined life wasn't worth living, and Marcus Aurelius was quite firm that new truths should lead to new practice. Academics focus entirely on uncovering these truths, or revealing when we know less than we did, often for pay far lower than what they would get in the private sector.  The best do this because they see it as a duty and a calling,  the worst due it to produce papers for the sake of producing papers.    There are useless marketers, authors, painters, ceo's, teachers, plumbers, etc. in their respective fields... Yet it seems that academics are strangely singled out as a class worthy of wholesale rejection in the basis of their... I guess... Subtle boringness and non-obvious applicability to you right this second?  What gives?  Meditate on that.  What emotion is driving such an unjust conclusion?  Do they make you feel bad about yourself in some way the math teachers often do - inadvertently A to their students?  Did a jerk prof humiliate you?  What is it?  Honestly.  When I see unreasonable claims, I have to think impulses are to blame,    I see no sensual argument for your conclusion that nothing valuable has come out of academia: the Internet, nuclear power, medicines, methods for ensuring equal representation in elections, economic management, public health, most programming languages, removing many common sense understandings through careful reasoning and evidence about each others and ourselves, not to mention just straight up self knowledge about our nature and history.  Nearly every big idea that some person has about these issues where first developed and disseminated by an academic.  Indeed, unless you are reading your Stoics in Greek and Latin your very translations were done by academics.  That we have pieces together so much about ancient stoicism from the fragmented text is a project of academics.  You're welcome, stoics.  Now let's turn to New Stoa.  That statement is demonstrably false as i read you to be interpreting it:  that the stoics were unconcerned with these arcane questions and found them a silly waste of time with no relevance to living well).    I hope that the new stoa doesn't endorse such a view.  The foundations of logic (which continue to be developed to this day), epistemology (likewise), contributions to key debates about physics were developed by and important to the stoics as they framed how we are to understand ourselves and live. They were the fence and the soil from which ethics and ultimately our knowledge of virtue arose!  Understanding nature requires self-scrutiny, scrutiny of others, and scrutiny of things.  This sometimes is made easier for specialists through the use of jargon to compensate for the limitations of everyday language.  The stoics - particularly the First and second stoa - but possibly the third (so much has been lost - and the Romans themselves could be rather anti-intellectual themselves... They are often noted for the low level of scientific development) ENGAGED with these ideas directly... Particularly the teachers of stoicism.  Did 'lay-stoics'?  Probably not.    Now, did the Stoics EMPHASIZE these questions (as the quote states?) No. They (like I) think that the role and priority of scholarship should be to help mankind.  However, a cursory look at the history of scholarship shows one often needs to engage these seemingly intractable problems for a long time before the next breakthrough.    This is often a deeply unprofitable activity In The short-run.  So, academics (all of whom were academic philosophers at the time) came together to form universities that funded their studies by the provision of instruction.... Much like the ancient stoic teachers.  Epictetus had his students STARTED with Chryssipius's very difficult, jargony, abstract, and unclear text.  They were expected to master it.  Why would he do this if he found such things (like the article you put up as an example of drivel) if it didn't matter?"

Why did the Stoics write parodies of Plato's Republic?   Why did non-academic artists, such as the Impressionists, and their followers, make such a mark on the 19th-20th century world?  I'm not in the habit of making things up. Read the New Stoa blurb for yourself: http://collegeofstoicphilosophers.org/  You speak of useful contributions from academia:   the Internet, nuclear power, medicines, methods for ensuring equal representation in elections, economic management, public health, most programming languages,    But in Stoic parlance these things are indifferents.

When I see erroneous reasoning I try to set it right.  When I see dispreferred indifferents making it more difficult for my community to prosper, I consider it virtuous and excellent to support those activities and make them even more effective and understood.  Do you think Marcus Aurelius sat in his palace with his knees in his arms rocking back and forth as his people were being overrun by barbarians, killed by plague repeating ""it is nothing to me, these are all indifferents, I must be disturbed!"" Over and over?  Did he see ignorance and suffering and do nothing or did he establish chairs in philosophy (even for schools with which he didn't agree but saw as valuable and possibly correct)?   Of course he didn't.  He strove to live consistently with nature.  Note, consistency - Zeno's first rule - later stoics counciled living consistently according to nature.

""Good job, here's your bonus."" Where's the skill? A supervisor is a dime a dozen, but a prime salesman is a thing to be treasured. If you ran a business would you want to promote your best sales staff out of sales?  Might be time to ask for a raise, or an increase in your take. If you're feeling really gutsy you might even politely ask if they didn't promote you because they want you to sell. ""Look, guys, you didn't promote me, and that's fine, but I'm producing. I'd like a raise."""
Stoicism,3au0ja,dmedlock4rc,5,Tue Jun 23 16:26:51 2015 UTC,"This is a good way to look at it.  If you really are performing well then asking for more money isn't out of the question.  At the end of the day you are letting yourself be upset by an external.  Your ability to work is transitory, management could make worse decisions, the company you work for could go under.  All these things are outside of your control.  Circumstances could change such that you are on the street in nothing but tattered jeans."

This sort of thinking of is why so many sales organizations are so damned dysfunctional. Admittedly, not every talented salesperson will take to process-oriented/organizational work, but it's important enough that one should try to grow such people.  This applies to programming & technology too.  Imagine if Robert Hooke hadn't been ""promoted"" out of being a mere technician?"

Imagine you lost all your memories. You now have just got the job as a salesman, isn't it the same job you were happy with last month? Doesn't it pay the same? You can be happy in this job. You are good at it. That can be a source of satisfaction.  Remember if you became the supervisor then you would just have different problems. The problems of all the salespeople would be yours. Moreover you would have to deal with management more. Think of all the trouble you have been saved by not having a new job, you get to keep doing something you like and are good at and know how to do.  Marcus Aurelius was the emperor of the whole Roman Empire and found it very stressful. Contentment is the best thing, at any level of existence.  Moreover this is a wonderful life lesson in dealing with disappointment. If you can deal with this well then you will have calmed your mind and you will gain this amazing power which can give you great happiness for years to come.   Remember in Stoicism the only thing to focus on is that which you can control, which is your reactions and beliefs. The anger is there, how do you want to react? Who do you want to be in the future? Do you want to just let the anger subside over time or do you want to feed it?   Being angry is fine, it is not a problem. It's what you do with it that will define whether this is a problem or not.  Is this any help?"

Ultimately, IMO, ego is a defence mechanism we build up because we feel unworthy. Like somehow we aren't good enough as we are and if we could just become something else then we would be ""good enough"" or ""worth something.""  Like in your example it is easy to take what has happened as a personal attack. As if they are saying ""you are not good enough!"" Anger can then be a primal response to feeling attacked.  However in reality you are ok, everything is as it was before. You are starting down a new path, you can feel your ego really strongly and all the pain it's causing you. That's a big step, most people can't understand that their ego is causing them pain.  If you can take this as a chance to learn about yourself and grow as a person then it can be a very valuable thing. Yeah you are hurt and that is real and powerful and I am sad to hear it. The anger and pain will pass, just try to float with it. Take some deep breaths and tell yourself everything is ok, because it is.   Maybe it's time to start a more philosophical way of living, afterall you say    It is my bruised ego that is causing me the most trouble.   learning to deal with that is a lot of work but could really be of great benefit to you.

Stoicism,3au0ja,Vistian,6,Wed Jun 24 00:29:51 2015 UTC,"I look to my emotions as guages, just like in a car. That's the natural function of emotion - they alert you to when you're ok, and when you're about to break down on the side of the highway. To me, trying to get over an emotion is just another way of letting the emotion be in control - it's like willfully ignoring that my gas guage is low because I don't want to be late to an appointment. You can see the problem there - I ignore the guage, run out of gas, breakdown, and then I'm extra late for the appointment, if I even make it.  Your anger is telling you that there is a problem at work that, if you ignore, will end up worse in the long run. Use your anger to learn about the situation - determine what you can control, and what you can't - then take action. Maybe you determine that you want to negotiate a raise, or maybe you determine that you want to keep your head down and look for a better job - either way, the anger won't go away until you resolve the problem (determine a best course of action), so let it be there. Just don't let it make your decisions for you, and don't wallow in it."

The physiological response of anger is determined by your subconscious mind.  Your brain automatically triggers the chemical reactions that produce the sensation we call anger.  That is the first injection, however.  Each time your conscious mind entertains that anger and gives it a home, you embolden it to keep the chemical soup in your head pumping your next cycle of anger.  Being angry is OK.  Acting angry is not.   Acting angry or not is something you have control over.  The more you do not act (and conscious thought IS a voluntary action) on your anger, the faster it will dissipate.

Stoicism,3at7r7,UsurpThrones,25,Tue Jun 23 09:07:40 2015 UTC,"Repeating an earlier comment of mine:  The FAQ has a question (and answer) on recommended starting points from newcomers.   Summarizing the FAQ entry, good options are:   The Enchiridion of Epictetus is short and easy to read. It was written as a ""cheat sheet"" of sorts for Epictetus's Discourses, reading the Discourses as well can be very helpful for clarifying what is being said. Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, a personal journal. There are several out-of-copyright translations online, none of which are very good. Hard and Hays both have much better translations popular with readers here. Selected essays and letters by Seneca the Younger, particularly De Tranquillitate (On Tranquility of Mind) and De Brevitate Vitae (On the Shortness of Life).  Moses Hadas's The Stoic Philosophy of Seneca is a good printed source for these and other writing by Seneca. De Officiis (On Duties) by Marcus Tullius Cicero.   Popular modern accounts include Stoicism and the Art of Happiness by Donald Robertson and A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy by William Irvine. The later is notable for being popular, easy to read, and controversial; some (including myself) find that he departs significantly from several fundamental elements of Stoicism (see here, here and here).   I also like The Stoics: A Guide for the Perplexed by Andrew Holowchak as an introduction. Holowchak retains much of the ""practical"" emphasis of the Robertson and Irvine, is better covering the historically important theoretical aspects, and modern non-Stoic influences are less pervasive in Holowchak than in either Robertson or Irvine.   I think any of these can be a good starting point, and any of them can be valuable on its own, but each only offers a partial glimpse of Stoicism as a whole.  Most of the ancient sources above are good for browsing, picking random pages and reading a little bit here and there. Each has its own distinct character. A good approach may be to find copies of the Enchiridion, Meditations, and a selections of Seneca, and spend a little time browsing through each, and then focusing on the one that appeals most. Then, pursue supporting material to help give context, unpack references, and otherwise improve interpretation. For the Enchiridion, the best source for this would be the Discourses, and Long's Epictetus: A Stoic and Socratic Guide to Life is also helpful, in different ways. For the Meditations, Stephens' Marcus Aurelius does a good job of explaining context, references, and interpretation.   edit: Expanded the commentary on Holowchak."

He objects to virtue as something that modern people aren't interested in, but first, I think he is wrong: most modern people do want to be good people, and second, even if true, this would only mean that modern people wouldn't be interested in Stoicism. He places great emphasis on avoiding negative emotions and attaining tranquillity, but ignores the central Stoic tenet that tranquillity can only be attained through being a good person (edit 2: a point echoed in some modern lines of thought in modern positive psychology, see here), and that the whole point of avoiding certain emotions is that they interfere with being virtuous.

So many times something was transpiring, I worried outcome would be bad, I realized I was being assumptious and to just acknowledge that something was transpiring and I obviously shouldn't assume what the outcome would be.  Those assumptions were causing me destress, not the event.  Obviously wanting a specific outcome outside of my control is an issue, but I think assumptions are something that can be addressed much more quickly.  e.g. Wife says ""I need to talk to you"".

Epictetus tells us that reason is a piece of God. It's the thing that separates us from the animals.   From the Discourses: ""Well, then, and have you not received faculties by which you will be able to bear all that happens? Have you not received greatness of soul? Have you not received manliness? Have you not received endurance? And why do I trouble myself about anything that can happen if I possess greatness of soul? What shall distract my mind or disturb me, or appear painful? Shall I not use the power for the purposes for which I received it, and shall I grieve and lament over what happens?""  This is a huge difference between theistic Stoicism and Christianity. For a Christian, you can't do it without God. For a Stoic God has already equiped you to do it yourself.

As regards Stoicism, there was a belief in the pantheon of Greco-Roman gods, not an individual God, and moreover, gods who are fickle and temperamental, just as our individual destinies are unpredictable and full of ups and downs. There was respect for the gods but absolutely no reliance on them, nor any theurgic practices of the kind found in Neoplatonism.   On the contrary, the Stoic relies on himself, on his capacity for imperturbability, to become immune to ""the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune."" The Stoic sage feels that he can handle everything the gods throw at him; while not exactly defiant, he is self-contained rather than open to divine grace.

Read, for example, the Chapter 4. Stoic physics from John Sellars' Stoicism, beginning at page 91 (God and Nature). According to Sellars the Stoic God was a philosophical god and can be seen as the providential ruling force in Nature. The Stoics can be seen as pantheists identifying God with Nature. It was also common among Stoics to see Nature as a living being. Sellars points to the theological discussions in Cicero's On the Nature of the Gods, Cleanthes' Hymn to Zeus and Diogenes Laertius.   Stoicism was Greek and Roman, and by no stretch of the imagination was Graeco-Roman religion monotheistic.   In ancient Rome they had to follow the usual ritualistic acts and this they certainly did. However, Stoic theology was rather different to Roman polytheism. On the other hand, I would not call their theology monotheistic because that refers to a personal god. /u/paniniconqueso basically describes the Stoic God as monotheistic god which is certainly not true. The Stoic God was a pantheistic God, the Stoics identified God with Nature.   Saying that their many gods represented a single entity is again a Christian reinterpretation of their beliefs.   The monotheistic interpretation of the Stoic God certainly is a Christian reinterpretation and is wrong. On the other hand, the Stoics were no polytheists, either."

Stoicism,3atxk8,SlothFactsBot,3,Wed Jun 24 12:29:03 2015 UTC,"Personal ability to achive virtue is a core tenet of Stoicism. Having to rely on God removes virtue from your power and since it's no longer in your power it should not be pursued. That's why it was imperative for the ancient Stoics to believe that God(s) have already granted you the power be virtuous. See Seneca Letter 41 and Marcus 2.11 for the example of that attitude.  Stoics do not believe in acetism for asteism's sake. You can practice ascetism but only so it would make you more resillient in your line of duty. To a Stoic, a stereotypical Chrisitan ascetic saint would not seem like a virtuous person, since in the end, he only cares about his own salvation."

The notion that one would need divine aid to become virtuous (other than through our endowment with reason - thanks creator!).  The stoics say time and time again what one needs to become virtuous and divine aid is not among them... At least so much as I can see.  If also find the view that divine aid through grace as necessary field virtue would rather complicate the cosmopolitan values of stoicism.  From my understanding Augustine's break with the stoics was precisely over the point of whether salvation was found within or only in the divine  If anything I'd say stoicism has more in common with deistic traditions than christian  one's.    .

God is CLOSE in Stoicism, and he CARES right? As Epictetus says:   Concerning the gods, some affirm that there is no deity; others, that he indeed exists, but is slothful, negligent, and without providential care; a third class admits both his being and his providence, but only in respect to great and heavenly objects, not earthly; a fourth recognizes him both in heaven and earth, but only in general, not individual matters; a fifth, like Odysseus and Socrates, says, "" I cannot be hid from thee in any of my motions.""   It is, before all things, necessary to examine each of these opinions; which is, and which is not rightly spoken. Now, if there are no gods, wherefore serve them? If there are, but they take no care of anything, how is the case bettered? Or, if they both are, and take care; yet, if there is nothing communicated from them to men, and therefore certainly nothing to me, how much better is it? A wise and good man, after examining these things, submits his mind to Him who administers the whole, as good citizens do to the laws of the commonwealth.  He, then, who comes to be instructed, ought to come with this aim: "" How may I in everything follow the gods? How may I acquiesce in the divine administration? And how may I be free?

Stoicism,3ar6an,highlanderheavy,11,Mon Jun 22 21:07:30 2015 UTC,"According to my knowledge of Stoicism, if you want to take a walk, you should, as long as you're not shirking some other pressing duty to do it.  Stoicism never says not to do things that make you happy. It just says not to get too attached to those things, because one day you might not be able to walk, or walk in the same place. You can find pleasure in a quiet walk, and in fact should since it probably connects you with nature and lets you reflect. But, your ultimate joy should come from your cultivation of virtue."
Stoicism,3ar6an,Snowywoods,6,Mon Jun 22 22:44:41 2015 UTC,"Preferred indifferents are just that: preferred, and also indifferent. Virtue and vice are true good and bad, so the indifferent can never take precedence, but given the choice between indifferents, the one that should be chosen is the one that is, well, preferred.  Marcus Aurelius X.2:   Take heed to what your personal nature craves, knowing that you are solely at nature’s disposition; comply with it and do it, unless it involves injury to your animal nature. But correspondently, give heed to each craving of the animal nature and accept it in full, unless it involves injury to your nature as a rational being: and the rational is ipso facto social. Apply these criteria to life, and do so without fuss.   Certainly there are occasions where a preferred indifferent might be turned down in favor of cultivating virtue (as in the case of some of the more ascetic Stoic exercises), but that is only because it is expect to be useful in cultivating virtue. In other cases (frequently, in fact), the route that better aids the cause of virtue is also pleasurable. When training the body, exertion and exercise are useful, but rest is also necessary.   Furthermore, spending time appreciating nature would, in the Stoic pantheist approach to theology, be virtuous in itself. The inclination to appreciate nature might even be said to be part of a instinct to be virtuous.  If your train of thought went something like ""I wonder what I could do that would be pleasurable right now... lets see... I might take a walk!"", then it might be cosidered less than ideal (the initial compunction to seek pleasure as a primary motivation), though you could do worse. But, if your line of thought goes something more like ""wow, what a beautiful day! I want to go for a walk"", this could very well be considered an admirable impulse, an instinct to be virtuous. In a Stoic theoretical analysis this might be considered an impression that ""it would be good for me to go for a walk"", and assenting to this impression might be virtuous (appreciating nature being pious, a subvirtue of, oh I don't remember which if the four primary virtues, but one of them), perhaps with an internal correction that the choice would be good, rather than the walk itself. See the wiki page on Stoic impressions, emotions, etc.. A very similar analysis of spending time with friends and cultivating affection of other humans also holds."
Stoicism,3at0q8,sonofhekate,3,Tue Jun 23 07:23:09 2015 UTC,"The ultimate goal of a Stoic is to be virtuous, which they (the Stoics) defined as living in agreement with Nature, which meant something very close to what a Christian would call living in harmony with God's will. The Stoics were pantheists: the universe is God. Being ""at peace with all outcomes"" is synonymous with not disagreeing with God. Take a look at Murray's lecture on Stoicism, particularly the second half.    Their Gods, we are lead to believe, have personalities, desires, and plans. Even in Greek mythology this seems to be the case.    When it comes to Greek and Roman polytheistic myths, the Greek and Roman understanding of what they meant was enormously varied and often very subtle. You should not assume that they took the myths seriously as literal truth, even those that took them very seriously.   Cicero's On the Nature of the Gods is an interesting account of the views of several schools of philosophy, including Stoicism. The Stoic view is also covered in Diogenes Laertius. See this question in the FAQ for the Stoic account."

Stoicism,3at0q8,jimstride,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:46:33 2015 UTC,How can the gods be both stoic and still exert force on the world around them? Not unlike we do...
Stoicism,3at0q8,cleomedes,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:52:47 2015 UTC,"You mean, mechanically, how does the mind of God/Zeus exert force? The Stoics apparently had and extensive and intricate theory of physics, but the original sources are all lost, and what we have as resources to go by are a handful of attacks by rivals and summaries (generally very poorly written) by anthologists like Diogenes Laertius. So, all modern explanations of Stoic physics tend to rely on a lot of guesswork, but some flavor of the basic concepts are apparent.  The Stoics believed that everything that exists (including minds) is a body, where a ""body"" is a thing with physical extent and location. Everything that can potentially act or be acted upon (be a cause, or subject to causes) is a body. Bodies can be classified into two classes, active and passive. The ""passive"" bodies are various combinations of the four elements, fire, air, earth and water, and cannot act, only be acted upon. The ""active"" is actually a single body, pneuma (air or breath) that extends through the whole universe, but has different patterns of ""tension"" or ""tone"" in different places, Local areas of higher tension are plants, animals, and at the highest tension, thinking minds. Every state, property, motion, etc. (everything which might be the effect of a cause) in passive matter is a reflection of pneuma.   Human minds are areas of localized high tension in the pneuma. The various gods are the portions of pneuma that extend through relevant bits of the universe, for example Poseidon is the pneuma that extends through the ocean (from which we can infer that Poseidon is ocean-shaped), and all properties and motions of the ocean are direct reflections of the pneuma that is Poseidon.   The pneuma of the universe as a whole is Zeus/God. All acts of all minds (those of all humans and other gods) are literal pieces of the pneuma of Zeus. One philosopher (not Stoic, if I remember correctly, but sharing some of the theology) refers to human minds as ""participating in God.""   Because the Stoics also thought that the universe as a whole is spherical, this leads to an amusing bur ridiculous debate between the Stoic and Epicurean representatives in Cicero's On the Nature of the Gods concerning whether a conception of God as having a spherical shape, as implied by the Stoic cosmology,  is more or less ""perfect"" than the Epicurean's more anthropomorphic conception.  Because the state, properties, and motions of the whole universe and everything in it is a direct reflection of the pneuma of the universe, the thoughts of Zeus are in a way definitive of the truth.   So, the ancient world didn't really have a concept of ""exertion of force"" analogous to gravity, magnetism, etc., but the best way to answer you question might be to say that it is more correct to say that God is the force that causes everything, rather than ""exerts force"" in the modern sense. Also, the idea of a ""world around them"" really doesn't apply to Zeus, because there is no world around Zeus; He is coextensive with the world. As for the other the other gods (Poseidon et al.), they are the forces that make their respective provinces act as they do; they don't exert forces on the world around themselves.  Yes, this is all very alien to modern ways of looking at the world. I sometimes find it entertaining to puzzle through, though,  and it's helpful in interpreting Stoic writing on other topics.  edit: proofreading/grammar correction"

So, is there any way that we too or others have evolved into such states?  We are participating in God but.. is there still free will?  If the stoics saw God as a sphere isn't that to say that they had a concept that there could be ""other Gods"" with their own reality/space and truth?"
Stoicism,3at0q8,MinotaurWarrior,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:53:53 2015 UTC,"Again, I need to reiterate the the existing evidence is second hand, sketchy, ambiguous, and in general hard to interpret. As I understand it...    Surely these beings/forces were designed this way.     Yes and no. The Stoics thought that, on the longest timescales, the history of the universe repeats itself infinitely. So there is no such thing as a ""before"" Zeus, no place for a creator or designer of Zeus. Looked at differently, each iteration is the creation of the one before, and identical to it, eternally into the past and future.   So, is there any way that we too or others have evolved into such states?    I'm not sure what you mean. Zeus is sage-like pretty much by definition; there is nothing remarkable about it. Think of being a sage as analogous to bring a musician that can play in perfect harmony with a piece of music, with the playing of Zeus being the music with which one must be in harmony to be a sage. Put differently, Zeus defines the reference point, so it is logically impossible for him to depart from it.    We are participating in God but.. is there still free will?     Yes, sort of. See the lengthy section of free will in the FAQ.    If the stoics saw God as a sphere isn't that to say that they had a concept that there could be ""other Gods"" with their own reality/space and truth?    No, they seem to have denied the possibility of an ""outside"" of the sphere. The universe is spherical, and the universe is everything. If something isn't part of everything, then by definition it doesn't exist. I'd have to go back and reread some things to be sure, but I think space outside the sphere was  a ""sayable"", which is kind of a weird concept I've never really wrapped my head around. To my best guess, it refers to sets of words that appear to mean something, and are sometimes even useful in expressing facts, but do not in fact actually refer to anything. Don't ask me to say any more, because even this much stretches my confidence in my interpretation beyond the breaking point. If you want to puzzle it out more, I suggest reading the fragments in The Stoics Reader in the physics section."

In Greco-Roman myth, Zeus turned into a Swan to have sex with a woman.   In neither of these religious traditions has the divine been conceived of as capriciously violent or zoophiliac. They're just weird stories.  The Stoics don't seem to think of the gods as having flawed personalities, and Zeus in particular is essentially the name by which they call the universal reason.  As I understand it, Romans more so than Greeks are thought by historians to have viewed their major gods as more like personifications of certain phenomenon than as super-powerful persons. E.g. Aescepulus is medicine, Mars is war. This is complimented by their sort of 'animist' beliefs and practices (lares, ancestors, et cetera). Remember also that one of our major sources (MAAA) was believed to have a genius (type of spirit) that pervaded the Empire and was deserving of worship.

There only exists ""THE NOW"", the past is in the past and the future is in the future, you live in the now and it is the only thing you can loose.   Stoicism teaches us that happiness is virtue, the only way to achieve long-lasting real happiness is through virtue. So strive each day to be virtuous and you will be happy.   Personally I try to embody some kind of Stoic virtue in daily life be it hard-work in my daily job or being helpful to my friends and colleagues."

Stoicism,3any8e,WannabeStoic,15,Mon Jun 22 01:52:45 2015 UTC,I know where you're at and I'd be surprised to meet someone who hasn't felt what you're feeling. It blows. But here is the gosh darn stoic truth: it's gone. It doesn't matter. It's out of your control and so a waste of your oh so precious time to worry about — especially considering it is in the past. Nothing exists but right now. The things in front of you this instant.   This is my basic understanding of what one of the big guys would say.
Stoicism,3any8e,TwainsHair,11,Mon Jun 22 02:58:47 2015 UTC,"The stoic way is to accept that what once was can't be changed, and focus on the here and now.   She was just some girl. Over the last 3 years you've built her up to be a fantastic creature that most likely doesn't exist. She would never be able to live up the hype that a brain can whip up. You have oneitis. Look for love elsewhere. It wouldn't be fair to put your unrealistically high expectations of her on her. You'll end up disappointed and she will feel it was her fault.  Find a way to move on."
Stoicism,3any8e,648262,3,Mon Jun 22 06:57:17 2015 UTC,"/u/TwainsHair has a great response. Besides the fact that it is now in the past and there is absolutely no reason to dwell on it (however difficult it may be), think about it this way. There are so many 'missed opportunities' in life that you don't even know about. Maybe there was a moment where you were debating about buying a lottery ticket but didn't, and it was the winning ticket. Maybe if you would have sat next to someone else on the bus that one day, like that one guy, you would have become friends with him and been invited to his birthday party where you would have met the girl of your dreams. Isn't it a bit ridiculous to get caught up in this 'could've-beens'? Your situation is just another example of one of these crazy 'could've beens' - the only difference is you actually perceive it as such. I know you feel this is a particularly 'special' missed opportunity because it's more emotional or you're more invested in it, but try to see it in the same light as the other examples I have shown you."
Stoicism,3any8e,Nikilled,3,Mon Jun 22 05:43:06 2015 UTC,"I dated this girl that I met my Freshman year of college. Only, I dated her three years after I met her-- she was very desirable when we first met and I had this fuzzy glow when I thought about her so once the situation was right, I went for it.  In retrospect, this was a mistake of enormous proportions. Not only did I assume that she was the same person after 3 years interim (and held her unfairly to the standard of that outdated image) but I assumed that I was the same too, that my likes and dislikes hadn't changed and refined as well. The relationship was a nightmare, especially since we moved in together out of perceived financial necessity.  Even if your lost lady came to you right now, it wouldn't be the same as if you'd started dating her back then. It might be better or it might be worse, but since you have no way of knowing one way or the other, there's no real advantage in pondering the questions of what was lost or could have been. Maybe you lost The One... or maybe you dodged a bullet!"
Stoicism,3any8e,HaemonZERO,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:15:53 2015 UTC,"I had a similar experience, but the other way round. Let me share in case it helps. I was in a relationship that did not end up working. Then we broke up and I spent really bad time. I met a girl short after and started dating her. From the beginning I had the feeling that it was too short time from one girl to the other and that was causing me some insecurities in the relationship and then I broke up. Then I had even worse time because of the contradiction I really liked her and broke up because my insecurities. By some reason I managed to date the 2nd girl again andthings went well for a while. Untill I started hesitating again for not having had enough time for me alone in befween. I tell you this because this feeling of 'what if I (had not dated her so early)' has tormented me for a while. I can sort of overcome it with the following line of thought: I can either change externals following this impulse of mine (ie, break up again) or I can work towards accepting my current situation and get rid of my insecurities. If I follow the first reasoning, no one assures me that in the new situation I will not feel other insecurities that will make me urge to change again (as it actually happened in the past), whereas if I try to accept it I will become insecurity-proof and so happier. The longer we have these insecurities, the stronger they get. So I'd suggest you take one of the two actions: in your case, you either start dating someone else and see if your feeling disappears or start trying getting rid of it by some internal way. If you take the first option it is quite possible your insecurity feeling will disappear, but maybe others will pop-up (eg, do I really love her or I am just dating her because of despair?, ...). I guess it is something we have to be aware of our character, this tendency to obsessive insecurity feelings."
Stoicism,3alqye,PaterBinks,27,Sun Jun 21 13:34:45 2015 UTC,"Your question was a little surprising, to me at least, because many people are skeptical of Stoicism because it seems to require too much belief in fate/determinism.

Stoicism,3alqye,bitjazzy,13,Sun Jun 21 16:48:33 2015 UTC,"Your view is called hard determinism and wasn't shared by the stoics as explained in the FAQ http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/faq#wiki_determinism_and_free_will  Most of the Stoic texts that deal with external issues fit well with the notion that there is no free will. For example they recommend that we either help or put up with people in our lives, because they couldn't act in any other way. Applying the ""no free will"" belief to others makes it much easier to empathize.   The trouble is when it comes to discussions of ""the self"", because you can't shake off the illusion that you do have free will, you can pick between A and B, but as Arthur Schopenhauer says   Man can do what he wills but he cannot will what he wills.   My only recommendation is to think of Stoicism as a framework for operation. What information and people you surround yourself with that kind of person you will probably be.  Try to build habits and ingrain the stoic ideals in your daily life. Don't depend on will power, because that won't work.

Stoicism,3alqye,MindfulMonk,19,Mon Jun 22 08:24:03 2015 UTC,"I've thought a lot about free will in the past, and I've reached the same conclusion as you have. But does it really matter if you have free will or not? After all, you have no control over it. Either you have free will, in which case, everything you do is of your own volition. Or you don't have free will, in which case everything you do is predetermined.  Does knowing it make any difference? If so, what? And what can you gain from thinking about it? Is it worth gaining? If you don't truly have any control, but only the illussion of control - then what is the difference between those two?

Stoicism,3alqye,identity_none,5,Sun Jun 21 17:20:55 2015 UTC,"Two questions:    Have you read the relevant entry in the FAQ? What do you mean by ""free will""?   The modern notion of ""free will"" is very muddled, referring (depending on in individual using the term, and when) to 3 or more related but distinct concepts.   If you mean by ""free will"" simply the negation of determinism- that there are aspects of your behaviour that are in some sense independent of the universal chain of cause and effect- then the classical Stoics would agree that there is no free will, but would argue that this fact doesn't have the consequences that you seem to think it does.  Consider the variously attributed (often incorrectly) argument that people who claim not to believe in ""free will"" never-the-less actually do. Even people who claim not to believe in free will, the argument goes, still look both ways before crossing the street. If they really didn't believe in free will, they wouldn't bother, because they couldn't make any decisions based on whether, for example, they see a car coming of not. The act of looking both ways demonstrates a belief that there is free will in determining whether to cross the street.  I would argue (and I think the ancient Stoics would agree) that ""free will"" as used the look-both-ways argument refers to something completely different that ""free will"" in the ""everything is determined by causes"" argument. For the purposes of ethical philosophy, Stoicism, and an awful lot of daily life, it is the sense used in the ""look both ways"" argument that is relevant.  There are a number of other distinct ways in which the term ""free will"" is used. The ancient Stoics didn't have a concept that exactly replicates the modern muddled and incoherent usage. They did address several phenomena that are closely related, though. For more, see the FAQ."

The act of looking both ways demonstrates a belief that there is free will in determining whether to cross the street.   Surely the reason people look both ways before crossing the street is down to the fact that they are taught to do so at a very young age?   We live in a world in which belief in this myth we call 'free will' rules, and rules absolutely. Its rule is so deeply embedded in our whole way of life that we can do nothing but behave in accordance with its silent promptings. The irony is that free will is not 'free' at all! It is so deeply ingrained in us that it becomes part and parcel of the whole deterministic straitjacket that actually controls all.  One thing about cause and effect is often overlooked. That is, causes and effects cannot be completely isolated; they do not occur in some hermetically sealed vacuum chamber. The truth is there is no clear-cut cause or clear-cut effect but rather one indescribably complex continuum of open-ended events about which one cannot say anything for sure.   Reality is not Zeno's arrow, it cannot be broken up into sub-sections, and therefore perhaps it isn't so much 'modern muddled and incoherent usage' that is at fault as language itself - language which is incapable of defining the moving target of causes and effects, that is, the flux. Am I making sense here? Did David Hume look into this 'observer and the observed' aspect of the universal flux?  So when we talk about causation we are talking in very general terms. We cannot discuss things in precise terms because the nature of the subject doesn't allow us to."
Stoicism,3alqye,jimstride,4,Sun Jun 21 18:00:16 2015 UTC,"I also don't believe in free will, but I do think it's compatible with stoicism (though I'm a stoic beginner).   With regards to the past, the stoic philosophy of not worrying about what you can't change and the fated nature of everything is in clear alignment with a deterministic worldview which tells you there's nothing you could have done differently anyway.  With regards to the present and future I think, strictly speaking, you can't do anything differently than what the laws of physics have already determined will happen. When some people hear this they say ""oh, well if I can't affect anything that will happen, then I'll just sit around and do nothing, since it won't change anything"". Others will react differently, and continue to ""choose"" to try in life and to do things. Yes, this reaction was pre-determined from your genetics and prior events, and there's really nothing that can be done about it. Question is, which of these reactions to the fact that life is deterministic do you want to have? Your answer to this question is determined already, but hopefully you answer it in the latter way, since I believe that way leads to greater happiness in life."

I absolutely believe in the theory of evolution (got my undergrad in biology) and I've thought a lot about this idea of randomness.   Here's another one, do you believe the weather is random? The weather is another example of a chaotic system. It may be incredibly hard to model, so we may not be able to predict it to 100% accuracy, but that doesn't mean there isn't an absolutely true path that a storm system will take.

My understanding of QM is that the quantum ""randomness"" (superposition) resolves upon interaction with a system (measuring device, etc). So whatever uncertainty exists about a quantum state disappears when it enters a chain of causation, at which point the system behaves classically (deterministically).  So whatever quantum woo happens in our brains before the first neuron fires is moot once that neuron fires. And anyway, the quantum woo is no more under our control than the deterministic chain that follows.  So where is the free will located? (Honest question, not rhetorical)"

I've taken introductory physics courses and I've almost completed my masters in chemistry. That doesn't make me incredibly knowledgeable to talk about the subject, but what i will say is this; I've talked to many professors at my university about quantum mechanics and specifically the idea that the thin slit experiment proves that the universe is random, and I'm still not convinced. My take on the thin slit experiment and the apparent ""randomness"" is caused by the fact that we're simply dealing with a frontier we can't see over yet. It appears random to us because we don't have what ever technology/insight/luck we need to figure out whats really going on, YET. 100 years ago we never would have been able to model a storm with any accuracy at all. We would have called natural processes like tornadoes and storms random, but now it is a matter of truth that they are NOT random.   I simply don't have the background to give you physical reasons why i think the notion of randomness in quantum physics is wrong, all i know is that i haven't been convinced and I've spent a fair deal of time thinking about this subject as well. If the popular notion was wrong, it wouldn't be the first time that lots of people believed something and were later proved wrong.   One last thing I'll say about quantum mechanics; People use quantum mechanics all the time to sway opinion on things. The word ""quantum"" itself conjures up images of spooky, almost ""unknowable"" science. Its used to deceive people all the time. stoned hippies use it to justify their pseudoscience even though they've probably never even heard of the thin slit experiment or have a good idea what a subatomic particle is.

If only the chaotic system that is my life could have resolved itself to a present in which I have eaten. Alas that is has not.'? Or do you pour yourself a bowl of cereal? At the level of atoms, nothing ever touches, but that doesn't stop me from petting a cute kitty who wants attention. There's a level of reality at which it makes sense to say 'My actions are a mere result of a complex environment far too complicated to ever exist,' and there are more abstract levels of reality in which it makes sense to say 'I am angry because of my reaction to this person; he himself has no power to make me angry.'"

Stoicism,3alqye,Counter423,-1,Sun Jun 21 23:10:11 2015 UTC,"What tests have you done to see if you have free will or not? Or, are you just accepting determinism because it ""makes sense""?  If you have a belief that you have no free will, then can you at least believe that you can always make the right choice, because you're lucky enough to be a part of a detatched logical culture that tries to wire your brain that way?  This all smacks of religion to me, honestly. Sam Harris, the buddhist*, loves determinism because that religious culture that he has studied and admires is dependent on empathy, not because of philosophical or scientific convictions. It all makes so much sense because our deterministic brain trumps your free-will soul with an uncontrolled inner monologue and responds by nodding and saying, 'that makes sense.' And we take it, because it's the path of least resistance.  On a side note, do you like cartoons or movies at all? I would love to be able to make a point about something but it is hard to visualize and I may depend on the firefighting episode of King of the Hill to get it across.  *edit: that was an unfair exagerration that comes from to much use of body language in my everday speech patterns; please read "" ""buddhist"" "" with those distancing quotes, or maybe closer to my real tone would be, "" buddhisty-guy """
Stoicism,3alqye,GreenLanternWilliam,3,Sun Jun 21 14:11:37 2015 UTC,"You sound very offended by the concept of not having a free will. Sam Harris isn't a Buddhist or religious at all, and i know you know this. i suppose it makes people feel better to try to take down someone who is vocal about an idea they don't feel comfortable with.   The ironic thing is, even without free will, someone like Sam Harris would never result to logical fallacies to make his point. You aren't a very logical machine."
Stoicism,3alqye,Guacomaco,0,Sun Jun 21 17:43:14 2015 UTC,"Harris is the one that gets offended when people badmouth buddhism. I couldn't care less what he or anyone else thinks about my free will. Do you really think I have the power to ""take him down"" even if I wanted to? I certainly don't think I could, and I wouldn't even want to, he's taught me a lot; the man is a genius in both argument and neuroscience. But he does have some baggage from psychology and eastern thought that leads him to say things like ""If you were in that person's place, molecule for molecule, you would have commited the same crime."" What ""me""? Not the Stoic ""me,"" that ""me"" is the one that makes rational choices that help my fellow beings, that ""me"" is nothing more than maxims and background music that define a character playing in a drama; that ""me"" can make a descision not to commit a crime.  If you're not offended by this train of thought, that's fine. But I try to be offended by things like this, Epictetus taught us to think these kinds of things contrary to our true nature as an artisan-fire. If I must believe in determinism, then it would be on the grounds that my point of observation is surrounded by a glow of background radiation that condenses in stages with a self-examining, constructive mind at the center of it. Fine, it's been determined that the universe was leading up to specifically me, and it's my job to live up to my destiny. That's a lot of responsibility you're taking on, really, if you believe in determinism. I wouldn't mind that at all."
Stoicism,3alqye,GreenLanternWilliam,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:03:13 2015 UTC,"I don't mean take him down the in the sense that you'd completely remove him from the public eye or wipe his ideas from the planet. Just look at the facts: #1. You brought up Harris. He wasn't a part of this discussion before you posted. You know Sam Harris isn't the only person on the planet who reached the consensus that free will is an illusion, right?  #2. The things you said about him were untrue. It seems you've got a grudge with the guy, hence why i said it seems you're trying to ""take him down""   In truth, I've never heard Harris get offended by anything related to buddhism. I've heard him offer caviat after caviat when speaking about buddhism in a positive light because he is so careful about speaking positively about ANY religion.   I'm not entirely sure what you're point is with your second paragraph and I'll confess that i don't understand all of it. I will say this, the idea that you have some responsibility to ""live up"" to your destiny is completely fabricated by you. You could die alone under a bridge and the universe would continue on without you. You are lucky to be here, but it is not necessary for you to be here. Many billions of living beings before you died without reproducing and many will after you. The universe is simply evolving and you're a part of it. Do you think a single water molecule flowing down a river has a destiny? Do you think that single water molecule needs to feel like it ""lives up to"" its destiny?"

Stoicism,3alqye,UtopianSloth,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:28:10 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of things that make complete sense and are hard to argue with. That's the 'flat earth' model for believability. The important part is to test things. By coming up with a test for free-will vs. determinism, you will actually be able to see what you mean by free-will.  There isn't anything happening in the real, physical universe, and that's hard to take sometimes. We all live entirely in the past, because there's no sensory information coming from the furute. As soon as you switch over from looking at yourself as being a present creature to being the narrator of your life story, everything changes.  In the firefighting episode of King of the Hill, there are four different men who all have to give the same account of one story. Hank and the gang are volunteer firefighters that are seen as responsible for a terrible accident. The cartoon enters everyone's point of view to do so, with their voice running on top of the action in a narration. The skinny, violent man has an image of himself as a buff trickster-hero with a badass cigarette; this tells us clearly that he smokes because he thinks it's cool on some level; he also sees a literal drill sergeant shouting at him when someone is trying to tell him the rules. His rebellious point of view colors everything in the situation differently, but especially the things that we take for granted- how we look, the background music that's playing, what angle we show a pose from. That rebelling-against-the-machine point of view is the same thing that made him think to do something cooperative by breaking the rules- allocating resources to the most capable member of the team in a way I won't spoil.  In the other memories, it has other jokes; the balding man sees himself as completely bald because that's the way he thinks about himself, and has a self-depricating tone; the mush-mouthed drawler sees himself as urbane and surrounded by hics. The rules-happy leader has another point of view, though- he sees everyone, including himself, as a child just acting like a firefighter. And then, when the alarm starts and they actually have a responsibility, he turns into an adult and they all go to fulfill their duties.  In stoicism, we have to acknowledge, before anything else, that the point of view we have and the point of view of the universe is different. We're living in a story that our souls are crafting for us. There is nothing determined about our reactions to things because we live slightly behind the physical universe in a psychological universe, and we can choose what 'background music' is playing ahead of time in that world.  I guess the hardened point would be: if everything takes place in our brains rather than the real world, we can ignore the physical restraints of the real world in favor for the realities of neurons, which are 'colored' by their connections to our inner personality.  The 'real' point of view- the audience- the one that we all see in the first half of the episode, where all the characters look and act 'normal' as if we were a fly on the wall- that reality doesn't exist anywhere because human life takes place inside of human brains. Third-person might seem like the truest, most perfect world view, but there is no observer like that until we take a step back and do it ourselves in first-person.  You've stayed with me because I entertain you, but you don't really beleive me; it's all too close to supernatural to be real. I can't convince you that the friction of the universe can be overcome by rationality. Fine, fine; you win. I only ask you remember something that every god in the universe is trying to remind you of. Please remember to tell yourself that you're made of particles that escaped being viewed as particles by becoming 'atoms' with electron harmonics; and that those atoms escaped from being viewed as having atomic properties by gathering up into protiens, and those protiens gathered up into eukaryotic cells so that they had another level of scale for self-preservation, and those livng cells gathered into a psychological culture of humans, and that culture of humans grew into the unique self-reflective being that you are now. All of these levels are about combining things and preventing the decay of elegance over time. If you are deterministic, that isn't bleak at all; that one narrating neuron in your head was the point at which the big bang happened, and the universe specifically evolved you to do the same work as the rest of the cosmos: bring things together into beautiful arrangements. And the more you self-program that reaction in yourself, the closer you are to living up to your true purpose."

Stoicism,3aieq3,sonofhekate,143,Sat Jun 20 14:10:17 2015 UTC,"My wife is 5½ months pregnant, and about to lose her child due to complications - a child we have already named, written letters to, and given a lot of thoughts into raising. Read more here. At this stage of pregnancy, an induced abortion is practically the same thing as a birth. So all the pain, but none of the joy afterwards according to our doctor.  On top of that, I have the most difficult exams I've encountered yet as a student, everyone of my classmates are having issues with stress, and a lot of them have even dropped out. Also, my father is sick. He is getting older.  I only started reading about Stoicism a few weeks ago, but I'm happy I did with all these sudden challenges. If I hadn't learned to be grateful, imagine worse scenarios, and to live life to the fullest and use these great techniques to work with grief and bad emotions - I would probably be in a dark hole right now. And so would my wife.  But instead, we are actually enjoying life to the fullest odd as it may seem. I've managed to continue with the exams, and even perform well. I call my father up often, and enjoy the time we have left with him. We also do what we can, to enjoy the time we have left with my unborn son Ragn (We have 2 days left now). I have shed a few tears here and there, and my wife has cried. There will be more tears. But most of the time, we're content and happy in spite of it all.  We want to give Ragn as much of an experience of life as is possible in the last few days. We have been walking in the rain so he could hear thunder. We have played our favorite music for him, by holding the speaker to her stomach. We figured that he would probably be able to feel the g-forces from a swing, so we spent a lot of time on a swing. We went to the beach, and my wife rolled up her blouse so Ragn might be able to see whatever sun peaked through her stomach.  You realize that some day I will no longer be here, just as Ragn will be gone in a few days. Him being gone is beyond our control. And I want to live my life to the fullest, and I want to show him all that life has to offer too. Because isn't that better, to be laughing, smiling, riding our bicycles, having fun on swings? The alternative is to lie around and cry.  Oddly enough, the most difficult thing about all of this is other people. I think they expect us to be far more depressed than we are. They send us flowers, and write all the time when really they don't have to. I'm grateful for their attention of course. But you have to frown a little bit when you go outside, just because it's expected that we're grieving. But really, we're not grieving. We're making the most of it, and we're being grateful. There is so much to be grateful for. At least I have a carreer. At least I have a father. At least I have an unborn son. And when I don't anymore, I still have so many fond memories, and it's better to have loved and lost."

Stoicism,3aieq3,Nicklaus_OBrien,11,Sat Jun 20 16:58:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences during these trying times.    Isn't it a peculiar thing how other people have such visceral reactions to our outlook on life during times they determine should be depressing. ""How dare you look on the bright side."" ""There must be something wrong with someone who isn't beside themselves with depression, anxiety, and tears.""    People love to put on a production to show that they are against what is happening. Poor me!, they shout. Hey everyone, I'm a victim!  When my grandfather died, I was the only family member who did not cry. For me, the funeral was a celebration of his life. All that he had given the world, all that he had done for my grandmother and my family. I'm smiling thinking about it now. It was an honour to have known him, and learn from him. I'm smiling now. Knowing that even your unborn son has taught you lessons of love and understanding, a unique experience that you can use to enrich your own life, the life you live with your wife, and the lives of others.    :)"
Stoicism,3aieq3,sortefugl,7,Sat Jun 20 20:55:58 2015 UTC,"That is exactly how I'm thinking! Your grandfather sounds like a great person, and I think you're thinking about it the absolute right way. You can grieve about a loss, and think about how hard it is going to be looking forward doing without. Or you can contemplate all the things you've learned from a person, and thereby internalize all the positive life-changes that person taught. Remember how he made you smile, how he helped you and your family to become better people etc. Your grandfather must have been a great guy.  When all of this is over, we'll write a list of things we're grateful for about Ragn. There are so many things. He taught me what it means to be an adult. He made me take control over my own life. Without him, I may never have found Stoicism (I looked up Stoicism after contemplating how important it is to set boundaries for a child, without being angry ;). Maybe I wouldn't have  started investing and being financially responsible. I would not have started app development so soon. Since he started growing in my wife's belly back in January, I held on to my non-smoking habit, and I severely cut down on my alcohol intake. I have lost weight and become more active. He has made me a better human being in every single way, by forcing me to take more control over my own life, because I recognized the responsibility I had for him. And that has also made me recognize the responsibility I have for myself.  We have an appointment at the hospital in 40 minutes, so I have to go now. Thanks."
Stoicism,3aieq3,yayfall,3,Sun Jun 21 07:13:53 2015 UTC,"I'm new to stoicism, and started reading about it about a month ago. Many of the stoic ideas are things I already did, but not all, and something about knowing that they were shared by others made them seem even more special in some way. I've been telling my pregnant wife about how great stoicism is and how I would like if she read a bit of it, but she hasn't yet been interested. However, last night, I told her about your beautiful story and she changed her mind and said she'd read anything about stoicism that I thought would be worthwhile. We've been lucky to not have any pregnancy complications yet, but I think your story helped her realize that philosophy isn't just some intellectual curiosity but can have real life benefits for situations that she can imagine.   So thanks for being a catalyst for my wife's interest in stoicism. I hope the very best for you and your family."
Stoicism,3aieq3,sortefugl,3,Sun Jun 21 13:21:52 2015 UTC,"Thank you for sharing. Funny how it all works.  I took up Stoicism after my wife and I had a discussion about temper tantrums a couple of weeks back, when we thought everything was OK. We agreed back then that the way to set boundaries as parents was to be firm, patient, resolute, but never angry. In preparation for that mindset, I decided to read about controlling my feelings - and naturally, I happened upon the philosophy of Stoicism and this subreddit.  So in a way you could say that Ragn made me read about Stoicism, and that has in turn made your wife read about it too. Maybe it won't be for her, and maybe it will. Regardless I hope all the best for you, her, and your unborn child.  It's a great consolation during difficult times, that your difficulty at least inspires others to learn. And if his short existence can help make the world just a little bit better, well.  We wish you all the best. How far are you along in your pregnancy?"

Maybe it won't be for her, and maybe it will.    I think she'll be interested in it. Of course I'm a beginner myself, but having said that, what I've seen of stoicism has a decent amount of overlap with how my wife views certain things in life, and I would imagine that she'd find value in the other aspects of it that she hasn't yet thought about. So yes, there's a good chance that Ragn will have ended up making a lasting impression on my wife and whomever my wife's new perspective will eventually touch.  Of course this is really spectacular, as there have been and will be people who will live long lives in closer proximity to my wife who will undoubtedly fail to affect her in such a positive way. Ragn has, without even leaving the womb, left a huge positive impression on the world.    We wish you all the best. How far are you along in your pregnancy?   Thank you. She's 20 weeks now, and so just getting big enough to start having trouble finding a comfortable position sleeping. If all goes well, we're hoping to welcome a baby girl in November."

Stoicism,3aieq3,sortefugl,3,Tue Jun 23 17:57:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  I had no idea people were still reading this, so I thought I'd give a quick update for you and for others who may be looking up this dusty old thread (To me, it seems dusty and old, because it feels like I wrote my reply so long ago). So my wife gave birth to Ragn yesterday. He lived for 47 minutes and died in our arms. It was highly emotional, and completely surreal. We cried a lot. Then we went back to our rational selves. Then cried again. At one point, I thought my wife had lost her mind, but I managed to calm her down. I don't think it's possible to ever process so many, intense, overwhelming feelings at once, so in the coming days we will have a lot to rationalize, discuss, and put in context. Realizing that this tiny tiny bundle, weighing only 540 grams, and being only 30 cm in length - is my son. And he was. He looked like me. He had the same peculiar bump on the back of his head, and he had my wife's ears. Of course, I expected worse - and in a way that was good. Because even though I was still in complete shock, I was still present enough to be present for him, as his heart kept beating, and he slowly drifted off to sleep. I won't lie and say I was happy, or that I was able to control much less contain my feelings. But I feel like I could better relate to them, and put them in perspective - exactly because I had so many positive associations with him.  You start to build narratives to cope with it all, narratives that in the situation works as a psychological defense mechanism, and a barrier to the huge sense of loss threatening to overwhelm you. We had already figured that he must be strong, because that's the only thing he COULD be, continuing to kick and thrive with those massive growths in his chest. And he was. 47 minutes, even though his lungs didn't work. But it was still a narrative for a tiny early-born baby, that had more to do with our perception of him, than who he was. Every time we looked at him, we felt this narrative build. We would imagine how he would be like when he was born. What he would be like in a year. In two years. When he was an adult. As you build this entire story, the hurt intensifies so much to the point that you feel like your heart is going to burst. Because the narrative you have lost is so much bigger.  I think, when you look into the eyes of your child, that you're hard-wired to see potential. And when you know rationally that this potential is never going to be anymore than a dream. And you know rationally, that the more you think about that dream, the more you'll hurt. You just realize that there is only one thing you can do: Let go. Let go.  So we will. In two days, we'll have him put in a coffin and say goodbye to that little lovely hunk of meat, that the loving father in me loves so dearly. We'll kiss him on his forehead. And we'll let him go. Because it's the only thing we CAN do. And it's what we would have raised him to have wanted.  And when he's in the coffin, we'll close it. Just me and my wife, and the mortician - noone else. And we'll have him cremated, and we'll have the ashes. And once we're ready, we will give him back to nature in a place where we loved to walk. And smile. And laugh. And sing. To him, and to ourselves. And we'll continue living. Because what else can you do?"

And I've already found ways to rationalize, and learn a lot from it - and most of what I've learned I can use when we're ready to try and become parents again.  I understand now, why so many children are spoiled. It's hard to make choices that you know will upset your child, because you can't bare to see them hurt. We've felt that by having to take pills that would kill him, and to terminate the pregnancy. We knew it was the right thing to do, but it felt so wrong.  It's the true test of being a great parent I suppose. Doing what your child needs, not what he or you wants."

I wish you both courage for the days to come.  The part about other people's reactions sounds very familiar. I have health issues that tend to provoke similar reactions from other people. They either tell me they think I'm brave for getting on with my life instead of crying all the time, saying they couldn't cope with it th way I do, or they tell me to remain strong and positive if I show any sign of being slightly sad about the situation (which happens. I do cry sometimes). Truth is, as humans, we're quite scared of other people's misery, because it reminds us that it could happen to us too. That's why I am so grateful of having discovered Stoicism. It helps me acknowledging that shit happens, but that we can lead good lives nonetheless. And by not being scared of other people's misery, I get better at being a good friend (or fellow-human) to people who also have challenges in their lives."

As we walked out of the children's wing, past all the new parents who sat there happy and beaming with their babies in their arms, we were trying to come to terms with the bad news we had just recieved. I remember feeling self-pity, and sorry for myself and my wife, thinking we had it bad.  Then we passed the corner, and saw an emergency doctor walk briskly with a patient on a bed, that was covered head to toe with a blanket - probably dead from a car crash, and with or without a family I don't know. And then you realise that it could always be worse, and that all the people around you whose happiness seems almost threatening on an instinctual level, have all experienced a degree of suffering, and will also eventually lose all their friends and family and die. Sometimes you feel alone, but I think Stoicism reminds us that we're not.   Truth is, as humans, we're quite scared of other people's misery, because it reminds us that it could happen to us too.   A very powerful observation!  Today I walked past a guy in a motorized wheelchair. Usually when I encounter people like this, I avert my eyes, maybe for the reason you say, but this time my reaction was instinctual and not at all awkward. I looked him in the eye. He looked back and I smiled to him. Here I am feeling sorry for myself, and he could be paralyzed for all I know, without even a wife, or any prospect of ever having children ever.  I used to think being grateful, and remembering that others are worse off, was something you did as a courtesy to other people. But really, it's something that helps us too."

I've found that stoicism is all around me. I got in contact with CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) to try to work on some of my less constructive thinking. Over the time i've really just learned to accept myself in whatever state i am, with the idea that i only have a little leverage to change it.   If i feel bad? Yes, it sucks, i can try to do things that will make me feel better, but in the end i learned to accept these periods in which i don't feel in control. I sort of learned to forgive myself for not meeting the standards i hold for myself, because i know, deep down inside, it's not something i can really control. It's not fatalism, it's doing what you can do and accept your boundaries. Feel a little down for a week? That's ok, at least i know it's just my perception of the world that is shifted. Objectively i know there's nothing wrong and accepting these feelings are better than fighting them.  Feel good? Great! But i know it won't last forever. And that's ok. Me learning to forgive myself for not feeling how i think i should feel/act has made the biggest impact in my life. If i could feel/act better i would, so it's obviously out of my control at that moment. I hope this makes sense."

And, while everyone around me bemoans their lives, I've gotten better and better over time maintaining my ""cool,"" if you will, in the midst of everything.  I'll tell two short stories back-to-back to illustrate. Before I'd gotten into this sort of thing, I was once working a car auction. Before long, I realized how shockingly little I knew about cars. This made me nervous to actually drive them. That nervousness made me fairly reckless, especially where speed was concerned. And, every time someone told me I needed to slow down, it made me more nervous. Once I scraped two cars together, they pulled me from the project.  By contrast, at my current job, there was a moment where one of my managers found a mistake I made. It was definitely an oversight of mine, but she proceeded to loose her entire arsenal of anger on me, in front of the whole kitchen, threatening to fire me, etc. etc. And I apologized, fixed it, and moved on. It didn't affect my performance or my mood. I really only thought about when my coworkers brought it up."

Like I said in one of my first posts here: I was basically living this way without realizing it.   It has profoundly altered the way I view life and my capacity for growth. Before I knew anything about it, I was devoted to bettering myself and expanding my ability to understand and empathize with others. Pacifists, murderers, homeless (I had been homeless for a while), thieves, nuns etc I learned how to see things from their perspectives. With this skill I was able to navigate a number of situations. I was able to become more than I was, to push my ego to its limits.   After a while I devoted myself to the idea of apotheosis and now pursuit a life that is founded on the idea that much more is possible than we believe it is.   Is that basically what happened to everyone else?   Real Situation  I have been working at my job since last September. I started as a temp and homeless. When I got hired on (January), I had my own apartment. I told myself, ""I want a certain life for my family. There are things I want to see and do before I die. I'm going to climb as high as I feel comfortable and then just hack away at everything I want"" Within the first month of being hired on I became a welder.   A month after that, I was waved over by two guys in positions higher than me, ""How do you feel about being an Operator?"" I said, ""Of course! I'm all about learning something new! It'll keep my occupied""  I got that shit down now and I'm one of the best Operators in my position even though I've only held it since April.

Stoicism,3aieq3,bebestman,2,Sun Jun 21 13:24:49 2015 UTC,"In the quickest, hardest to comprehend version it could go as follows below. Please take the time to read the whole thing and to reflect on it point by point.  Men and women are biologically different due to evolutionary pressures that manifest in genetic, hormonal, neural and psychological differences that persist until today, leading to differences is inherent ability at specific tasks and the view the two sexes view the world. Also, owing to the biological asymmetry between the sexes, approaches to sexual relations are asymmetrical, that is women do not want the same from men as men want from women as evidenced by the features the respective sexes find attractive and pursue, therefore advice to both sexes needs to be differentiated.  Note, however, that up until now we mentioned no claims of value or morality, nor will we. There will be no claim about what way to act is moral or not, and in that sense TRP is amoral, the same way the law of gravity is amoral, that is not making a claim about morality.  Having laid out the claim to the biological reality of sex differences - without claiming that all differences are biological, of course some differences are cultural - there exist a host of more specific claims such as the dual mating strategy of women, that is seeking resources and genes from different mates, advice for men on how to give the cues supposedly seen as attractive by women like physical strength and stoicism, and finally the reality of various features of the legal system, often under the header ""MRA.""  Note, that I deliberately split up the two paragraphs. The first claims the biological reality of sex differences, the second sketches empirical claims. Further, note that as in all of psychology these claims are somewhat caricatured, that is on paper we stress the differences as in the real world we tend to see commonalities.  So, there are many of ways to look at the subreddit TRP: On one hand it is a self-help forum for men seeking better relationships with women, explaining the many angry men. On the other hand it is a collection of claims about women, explaining the references to research. Of course, owing to the amorality there is no specific prescription for men, see for example the difference between the men claiming ""ride the decline"" as in pursuing plenty of short-term hookups and the men seeking to build families, both exhibiting different behaviours to achieve their respective goals.  If I had to summarize the whole thing in one sentence, it would be this: ""See the world as it is, not as it should be."" Or quoting Epictetus: ""Do not wish for things to happen as you wish, but wish for things to happen as they do happen, and you will go on well."" The point of contention then, I think, is that this is applied to the sexes and some romantic ideals have to be thrown out of the window. The result, again I think, is healthier relationships that are better for both sexes."

Stoicism,3aj0fk,designer_of_drugs,3,Sun Jun 21 06:02:09 2015 UTC,"The core of stoic practice is to do the best you can, and be indifferent to what happens as a result.

Stoicism,3adef1,HaemonZERO,16,Fri Jun 19 05:13:59 2015 UTC,"Two things:   Your assumption that the previous eight months have been wasted is flawed. You made steps to change your habits in order to improve your health; you have lost weight, and I'm betting your fitness has improved. Any exercise you do now lowers your chances of disease in the future. While working on your health, you were exercising self-discipline, and the more you do that, the better you get at it. You've shown yourself that improvement is possible, even when it's hard. When it comes to your health, there is a lot you can't control, but a lot you can control. It is pointless to worry about the genes you've inherited, or your risk of unknowingly catching the flu from someone, or your chances of being hit by a bus. There is a certain baseline level of risk which comes from simply being alive. On the other hand, there is a lot you can do to lower those risks - things like exercise, quitting smoking, eating complex carbohydrates instead of refined ones, avoiding sunburn, limiting your alcohol intake... These are all behaviours which you choose to do (or choose not to do) which have an impact on your risk of disease. So when you say you don't have a choice in whether or not you get health problems, that's only half true.    I think what you might be having trouble with is the uncertainty factor. You don't know if what you're doing now will have an effect later. You may never know, and that's fine. When it comes to your long-term, overall health, some things really are out of your control, and it's pointless to worry about those things. But your behaviours, the things you do each day, those are in your control."
Stoicism,3adef1,Moomium,6,Fri Jun 19 06:05:20 2015 UTC,"Your assumption that the previous eight months have been wasted is flawed.   Yes, I see that now. I think it's possible that I had expectations that were equivalent to the difficulty and effort, and that I was upset because the two didn't match up like I thought they would.   I think what you might be having trouble with is the uncertainty factor.   Agreed. When it comes to physical health, uncertainty has always been difficult for me to come to terms with. I've been blessed with a sense of mortality but as a result have a strong aversion to ""spinning my wheels."" I don't like not knowing because I don't like wasting time.  When I was doing my writing meditations last night I unintentionally used a technique on myself called The Downward Arrow, which my wife identified later on (she's a social worker with a good psychology background and a strong emphasis in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy). I think I was upset last night because of that. Downward Arrow is extremely effective when it comes to revealing core beliefs but it's a bit like undergoing surgery without anesthesia!  Thank you for your gentle council."
Stoicism,3adef1,daruki,3,Fri Jun 19 12:46:09 2015 UTC,"So you have uncertainty regarding your effort and the results it produces, correct?  The uncertainty you experience arises from an incomplete understanding or perhaps, coverage of the mechanism underlying weight loss. If you want to be certain your effort results in weight loss, the best way is to actually measure your effort. In this case, your effort is how much you restrict your intake of calories. This correlates linearly with weight loss - that is, the more ""effort"" you put into restricting your caloric intake, the more results(weight loss) you attain. This, fortunately for us, is 100% in our control and can be measured quite easily.  Assuming you are not the 1% with weird metabolisms, the amount of weight you lose boils down to calories in vs. calories out.   Let's make it more simple and take out the ""calories out"" factor, because often times, life gets in the way and you don't have time to exercise.  So what we have left is ""calories in"".   This, as you said, is what we put into our bodies. We have 100% control over this.   You can buy a scale and weigh your food and calculate how many calories you eat per meal. Then, you'd have 100% certainty knowing how many calories you took in on that day and how much weight you should lose. If you want to eat healthy, cook in bulk during the weekend, calculate total servings and find out per serving calories. ""Eating healthy is expensive"" is just a myth  If you wanted to lose 1lb a week, eating 500 calories under your daily maintenance calories achieves that. If you have faith in your mathematical abilities and you aren't lying to yourself how much you're eating, then rest well knowing what you have done was not in vain.   Sorry for going on a fitness rant, but I just wanted to point out that weight loss is one of the few things we do have 100% control over.  P.S. I would ditch the PGAA stack. Did a quick search and it seems like pure fitness marketing gimmick. You're better off just using an EC stack(ephedrine and caffeine) which can help reduce appetite and help you restrict your calories. Whether or not stoics approve of using such a cheat is unknown to me."

However, other research on the Bod Pod has shown error rates higher than underwater weighing; one study found an average difference of 5.3% between the Bod Pod and a 4-compartment model, and an error rate of up to 15% in individuals!  One of the reasons the Bod Pod is worse than underwater weighing is because there are more variables that can affect the results.  For example, facial hair, body temperature, moisture, and the tightness of the spandex or swimsuit can all alter the results.  And, like underwater weighing, the Bod Pod can have errors when tracking changes over time.

Stoicism,3adqjr,sonofhekate,15,Fri Jun 19 07:50:01 2015 UTC,"Remember than in Stoicism, the four types of virtue are Wisdom, JUSTICE, Courage and Temperance.  We should not get upset or emotionally disturbed about injustice.  But we do have an absolute moral duty to work for Justice. Stoicism is not just about protecting yourself. Stocism is also about calmly and dispassionately striving for justice in the community of all rational beings (the ""Cosmopolis"" or ""Universal City"").  It can be very difficult to explain to people that you regard justice as important but still don't get emotional about it. Sometimes it helps to spell out the concrete steps you've done. ""Look, I wrote to representative A, I signed petition B, I donated to defence fund C, I joined organization D, I went to demonstration E. I'm fighting for the same goals as you, I'm just not getting upset because we haven't yet won."""
Stoicism,3adqjr,TheophileEscargot,3,Fri Jun 19 09:01:27 2015 UTC,"If you have no evidence of the sort that is recognised and demanded by the systems of so-called 'justice' that currently prevail in the world what are you to do? Or if an injustice has been committed against you or your community but you cannot prove it, or perhaps if the perpetrators of the injustice are rich and powerful and capable of silencing you both inside and outside the courts of law, what are you to do?  If you are threatened with court proceedings when you raise your voice; if 'representative A' has his political career to think of; if the petition you signed is ignored; if the demonstration you attend turns into a mass brawl and you get violently beaten; what then?  How much injustice is there in the world that never gets to see the light of day? The world in truth is a place of injustice on an unfathomable scale.  And that's where Stoicism finds its voice. The Stoic however does not waste his time on the usual methods, what you call the 'concrete steps,' knowing full well that the outcome is never under his control, and that, likely as not, might will prevail over right, as it always has done and always will, in a world where material goods are worshipped over and above spiritual ones, no matter the talk to the contrary. The Stoic would abolish courts of law for all the evil they perpetrate.  Stoicism finds its voice in this way, namely, when the Stoic feels an injustice has been committed against him he simply reminds himself that the will of Zeus moves in mysterious ways and that he is above all to align his will with Zeus's.   Epictetus points us towards the example of Socrates and his response to the injustice committed against him: Meletus and Anytus can harm my body but they cannot touch my mind.   It's worth reading Plato, if you don't know the texts, see the Apology, and the Crito, too.   Actually, now I came to think of it, many philosophers have been on the receiving end of injustice. Boethius immediately springs to mind. Christians too. I particularly like S. Stephen's defence, (see Acts of the Apostles) ""Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the holy ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye. Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? and they killed them which shewed before of the coming of the righteous one; of whom ye have now become betrayers and murderers; ye who received the law as it was ordained by angels, and kept it not.""  Those words caused much gnashing of teeth! I could talk on but I'll leave it at that, work calls."

The Stoics Helvidius Priscus and Publius Clodius Thrasea Paetus risked their lives by defying emperors.   Stoicism recognises three disciplines: the Discipline of Desire, the Discipline of Action, and the Discipline of Assent. Concrete steps are not the only part of stoicism, but choosing to take the correct actions is an important part of it.  http://philosophy-of-cbt.com/2013/02/20/introduction-to-stoicism-the-three-disciplines/"
Stoicism,3adqjr,TheophileEscargot,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:34:41 2015 UTC,"If it's a toss-up between the right-wing justice of Cato the Younger and that of Julius Caesar, I'm afraid, (and no doubt this will be much to the chagrin of some Stoics,) I will have to choose the popular practical justice of the latter every time. (Although in truth I have no real admiration for any of these politico-militaristic Republicans.)  And meanwhile in a later age, when Stoicism had moved onwards and upwards, we have the views of Epictetus, harking back to Zeno, who, in his ideal Politeia, would have abolished courts of justice...    Thus, when his students came to him and voiced the idea of a kind-of mass suicide to show ""the robbers and thieves and courts of justice, and those who are named tyrants, and think they have some power over us by means of the body and its possessions [...] that they have no power over any man"" Epictetus told them to ""endure to dwell in this place where He has put you: short indeed is the time of your dwelling here, and easy to bear for those who are so disposed, for what tyrant, or what thief, or what courts of justice, are formidable to those who have thus considered as things of no value the body and the possessions of the body?"""
Stoicism,3adqjr,jimstride,1 point,Sun Jun 21 08:54:57 2015 UTC,"Zeno's book is lost, so we can only deduce what we know about it from secondary references. The book ""The Stoic Idea of the City"" is the best reference I've seen on it.  We know that there are no court buildings in Zeno's Republic. But we don't know why. It could be that there are no extravagant buildings and the work is done in the open or elsewhere. It could be that there it's a community of sages and has no need for law courts because nobody does anything wrong.  The question of whether ancient politics can be described as left or right wing, and which sides were which if so, is a huge one and doesn't seem that relevant to the original post."
Stoicism,3adqjr,TheophileEscargot,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:31:13 2015 UTC,"It seems that the subject of an ideal state occupied the minds of many philosophers, not just Plato and Zeno, but Diogenes the Cynic, too, and also Cleanthes and Chrysippus, who wrote numerous treatises on the government of states.  Yes, ancient politics is better spoken of in terms of the enmity that existed between the rich and the poor. Aristotle tells us that the rich took the following oath among themselves: ""I swear always to remain the enemy of the people, and to do them all the injury in my power."" Politics VIII.  A government was called aristocratic when the rich were in power, democratic when the poor ruled. The rich fought for liberty, the poor for tyranny. ""The mission of the tyrant,"" says Aristotle, ""is to protect the people against the rich"".  Politics, V.  Funny how tyrants, representatives of the poor, have had a bad press ever since!  And Epictetus's idealisation of members of the republican party, those such as Helvidus Priscus, cannot be regarded as wholly unbiased.   In general I agree with you that ancient politics is best steered clear of. But in conclusion, let me just say that whilst Stoics are neither forbidden nor encouraged to meddle in affairs of state, their principal objective is to work on improving themselves, on cultivating their minds; that the precious virtue lain long hidden within themselves may at last see the light of day."
Stoicism,3adqjr,jimstride,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:50:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, a final word, Zeno teaches man that he has a dignity, not as a citizen, but as a man; that besides his obligations to the law, he has others to himself; and that the supreme merit is not to live or to die for the state, but to be virtuous and to please the Deity.  With the advent of Zeno and the Stoics we see a gradual erosion of the old regime, one in which public virtues had always figured prominent. But now it is the private and personal virtues acted out in the presence of that spark of divinity within oneself that count above all else. It is these private virtues, these duties, this conscience, that are to be regarded henceforth as the only 'concrete steps' the Stoic need concern himself with."
Stoicism,3adqjr,jimstride,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:33:56 2015 UTC,"Just ""taking it"" and saying, ""Well God is weird"" doesn't seem particularly Stoic.

But the planet has become an ugly place, as you said and acquiescing (and surviving) to a nightmare would be the best solution for many people."
Stoicism,3adqjr,evil_capitalist123,3,Sat Jun 20 14:13:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why you're getting down voted. I would just echo what others have already said. Good luck teaching Stoicism to other people who aren't ready to hear it. People have been taught in our society that it is a good thing to be offended strongly, particularly over subjects of ""social justice."" If you walk into a room of Marxist Social Justice Champions and tell them that they shouldn't let their emotions and anger get the best of them... you're going to get mobbed out of the room.  Perhaps you can simply try to lead by example? The Stoic primarily focuses on living life the way it should be lived, and teaching others is a secondary concern.   It's almost like an MLK vs Malcom X argument to me. MLK was much more ""Stoic"" with his non-violent, civilly disobedient, turn-the-other-cheek philosophy. Malcolm X was... the opposite. Who had a bigger impact? Who is more respected by ALL of society?"
Stoicism,3adqjr,evil_capitalist123,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:57:16 2015 UTC,"I think people respect MLK because there is a false narrative surrounding his methods.

Stoicism,3adqjr,sortefugl,2,Sat Jun 20 00:14:04 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd say it's a little paranoid to think you're being down voted by racists, but hey, I'm not black so you're perception is your reality.  The reddit stoicism community doesn't like discussing things outside of its ""comfort zone"" for some reason. If you bring in a novel idea that doesn't fit neatly into the normal talking points, you're liable for a good down voting.  And so what if the narrative surrounding MLK's methods is false if that narrative is what people respect? Being ""militantly"" anything is going to alienate a large portion, if not the majority of, society.  This is all kind of a digression anyway. I like that you have a passion and something that you're willing to stand up for. Much of the Stoic community, from what I see, likes to sit around and talk about virtue but rarely (at least in ways that they'll share) gets out there and pursues it in uncomfortable ways."
Stoicism,3adqjr,jimstride,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:38:11 2015 UTC,"When you have someone following you around harassing you for your views, you'll know why I think that. In my time on reddit I've had four people do it. And I've held basically the same views for a while.  The quality of people isn't what it used to be so I'm not surprised if people do just sit around and mentally jerk off to an idea. Not just here, but everywhere.   The problem is that people respect something without understanding. And if they don't understand they're not really making an informed decision. So they're making uninformed decisions about something that is not necessarily true. They're being molded. I don't know. People are definitely militantly politically correct nowadays. lol And militantly offended all the time.   Do you think a post about how Stoicism has changed our lives for the better would go over well? Seems like it would from what you've told me."

We (currently) cannot control the dialogue surrounding race. We cannot control if and when people are hurt. But we can respond. We can act.""  The best action we can take is to continually try and improve our own selves, our minds, our understanding, our integrity, our morality. We can do nothing about family but when it comes to choosing friends, we should try and choose those who have moral standards, preferably Stoic ones, such as, 'virtue is its own reward,' and actually we should extend this choosing to all our dealings with the world-at-large, thus, for instance, if we are to hire workers, or a gardener, or a builder, say, we should enquire as to their values, do they believe in duties, virtue, arete, and so on, and be prepared for them to laugh at us. But people who truly observe the highest moral standards where they themselves are concerned, are I believe, invariably less inclined to value or seek the material things in life, such as flashy cars, flashy cribs, and other such accoutrements, and moreover they are not quick to judge their fellows on the basis of accidents of birth but on the 'colour' of their character, so to speak."
Stoicism,3adqjr,GreenLanternWilliam,0,Fri Jun 19 13:50:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you. That was very beautiful. And I do do that.   I think the confusion comes in -- as it pertains to systemic racism -- if doing such things actually does anything. How can I explain it to others without it sounding as if I am diminishing the cause/struggle?  As an aside: I already live this way. What I am trying to do is educate others on the value of it. I know that in seeking arete (as expounded by stoicism) we can change the world.   There was a thread in r/blackfellas ""Can we Agree on a Code of Ethics"". The main argument was : you're not going to get others to do that. I personally never argued I could get others to do anything, so much as vouched for the goodness of living life as well as we could."
Stoicism,3adqjr,GreenLanternWilliam,2,Fri Jun 19 13:55:38 2015 UTC,"It's very difficult trying to explain Stoicism to others who aren't ready to hear about it. People who are distracted by a thousand things will hear nothing of Stoicism and if they suspect you're preaching some sort of new (to them) 'gospel' with a funny name, they may not like it, they may be put off altogether.  Stoicism has a long history of ups and downs. Currently there is a huge amount of interest in the subject if the Internet is anything to go by. I can remember a time when there were comparatively few people interested in or even aware of the Stoics. So, if the current phenomenon / revival of Stoicism is still waxing, and there is no sign, as yet, of it having reached its zenith of interest, it looks as though we have some way to go and thus more 'converts' to the cause, but their individual paths to the Buddha, as it were, will follow their own idiosyncratic patterns. People will not be forced, they have to be left to find their own way.   And in the meantime it is up to those of us who have already been attracted to the shining beacon of Stoicism to keep its light burning in their own souls and thus in the world so that others, weary travellers and all, may glimpse that same light from afar, and curious to find out more, head in its direction where they will be welcomed by a joyous and happy throng."

Stoicism,3adqjr,dmedlock4rc,2,Fri Jun 19 14:35:22 2015 UTC,"I think I understand your problem after reading your edit. The whole issue with Stoicism is that to us, the value doesn't lie in the teaching, but in what we do with it.  If you walked into a gym and vomited up a bunch of steak and protein powder, nobody would think you're a great bodybuilder, even if you're clearly showing them that you eat great. They'll be impressed when you internalize it and it becomes a part of you.  Now that that little fight club rule is out of the way, let's talk seriously. I love the Enchiridion, and I highly suggest you read it as a kind of 'stoicism for kids'. Its writer, Epictetus, probably wasn't black, he seems to have been from Turkey, but he was an ex-slave (of course, roman slavery was quite different; but let's leave that for another time).   Most notable for racism are sections 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 16-20, 27, 28, 33, 42, and 48. I would say that the ones that have helped me the most, both in racism towards me and when I feel that peculiar vibration run through me regarding others, are: 8, 17, 28, and 42. I will briefly touch on these four passages now in a stunning example of hypocrisy towards my first statement regarding vomiting.  Section 8 says: ""I can't control the universe, so I won't even try, I'm going to solemnly wish for the universe to keep going the way its going."" If you can do that, you'll be happy because you want something realistic. If you can't say that, people will be able to dangle bright promises and dark fears in front of you to manipulate your view of what the future should be like.  Section 17 says: All the world is a soap opera and we are players. We have an executive producer that not only gets to decide how much time we get on screen, but also who we are and what situations we are thrown into. Our job as an actor isn't to change the script, but to act our part naturally; the job of choosing what part we play isn't up to us, even if we really don't want to play a cripple or a poor person.  Section 28 says: Imagine that you're a genie, and just by saying your true name someone could make your body commit whatever act they chose. Wouldn't you be embarrased that you had that weakness? And yet, whenever someone chooses to shout at you or use bad language, whoops, there goes my brain, you can do whatever you want with it. The only person you should be angry at is yourself for letting anger drive your brain around in the first place. I know that when I see someone getting angry I don't see that they are manly and powerful; I see that their mind is penetrated.  Section 42 says- and remember, this is the meaning of life, so don't panic- There are a few things in play when someone wrongs you, like if they speak badly of you or physically hurts you. First, they have to think that it's their duty to do it, or they wouldn't have thought of it in the first place. Where they got that idea that it's their job to hurt you, that doesn't matter and you shouldn't care, because you can't control it. It's over. Second, you can't control who is right in the situation. If you're right and they're wrong, too bad, you have to deal with it. If somebody says that you're different because of your race, that doesn't hurt your race, except in that persons mind. You don't have to let that thought in and let it play with your emotions. Imagine that they were just hypnotised, or that they're just trying to bait you into a reaction, or that they have a mental disease where they lose control of themselves sometimes. Embrace the passive-aggresive line, ""I'm sorry you feel that way."" If they try to turn around and say that they don't just feel that way, it's the scientific truth, shrug and say, ""it's the Truth to you,"" and add mentally, 'but that doesn't change the facts.'  As far as trying to lay down a code of ethics based on Stoic thought. It's not going to happen. Anger is too beautiful, has too many feminine wiles, makes life impossible to focus on. People will always try to harness anger when they feel disempowered, they will drink from her breast and become drunk with her promises of control. When anger fades, they find a razor-sharp lonliness and blame something, and then they cry until she comes back with her soft touch and lifts them into another frenzy, their mouths doing nothing but servicing her even when they feel like they are being fed.  And when two angry forces find each other, like a husband and a boyfriend, and start to fight, she smiles at us, and she says happily, ""They're fighting over me."" And as Stoics, we shake our head in a paternal indifference and try to make some good out of the situation. We pat anger on the head in our own minds, and say, ""you may be seductive to them, but you are mine; I'm not your toy that you control with a tantrum. Now back to bed with you. This is adult time."" Diminishing people's feelings- the bad ones- is exactly what you will be talking about if you try to bring stoicism to the conversation.  EDIT: done editing, clicked save on accident the first time."
Stoicism,3adqjr,vsync,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:20:21 2015 UTC,"Let me just say that this was all beautiful and it brings up a concept I have been devoted to: apotheosis. The idea that man can transcend his nature with such things as stoicism, exercise, and a love of knowledge/growth.

Stoicism,3adqjr,dmedlock4rc,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:31:38 2015 UTC,"Transcend his nature?  Transcend his nature?!  Thank you for your kind words, but I must correct you. Surrounding every one of us is a haze of radiation left over from the big bang that tells us matter was formed out of space and time. Beyond that is a void, then, a blossoming of flowing stars that came together out of that matter. Beyond that, another void of other galactic clusters flowing like liquid, then our own cluster of galaxies that wraps us in mysetious dark matter, keeping the galaxies together without breathing a word of how it can construct something so awesome.  Particles work together to become protons and neutrons; then gravity gathers up 'atoms' into big chunks so that they can interact and become heavier elements; these elements have electron harmonics that form molecules. Molecules work together to form protiens; and protiens work together to form duplicating cells; cells work together to form eukaryotic cells; eukaryotic cells work together to form life with growth potential; life with growth potential works together to form life that connects with other life.  Can anyone in the universe say different? Did we not all come from some force that brings things together into beautiful arrangements? Why in the great universe would I want to transcend my true nature??? I love my true nature- the will of the universe is one with my true nature.  We're all part of the same constructive-over-time universe. We're all brothers in it, whether we're a sentient child learning self-control for the first time, or a sentient Matrioshka System learning to create a bubble universe to escape the Big Crunch inside of. My will is aligned with the greatest will in the universe. The richest/smartest man in the world would be unable to defeat me; a super-strong non-human would be unable to defeat me. The non-human would understand that though we are different in form and thought, we are the same in spirit as long as we work together; the richest/smartest man would try to coax fear and anger out of me, and upon failing- would consider me one of his few true human equals, whether as a rival or a friend.  We're not npcs in an MMORPG fantasy video game, right? We don't really believe that we're elves and orcs, we get it that we're higher than the random programming that someone else decided. Sometimes the game forces some of us to act like an elf or an orc, but if it's not up to us, why get mad at a player instead of the game? Our first goal should be to remember those sad people that lose their lives in the orc/elf game to the total neglect of their real human bodies. We should be focused on that worst case scenario every time we feel an orc/elf hatred, and remember that it's just part of the background information of the universe to make us feel more immersed in the game.  We shouldn't go to forums devoted to the story, we should focus on our real lives- that's just doing the storyteller's work for them! We shouldn't see another orc in the game and say, 'hey, brother'- because we don't know if they're an NPC or another real person! isn't that more important than what the character model you see is? We should talk about the real world in the chat of the game while the game is going on in front of our real eyes, trying to build our relationships and discover what the truth about each other is.  Great, now I'm making analogies about DC and WoW because I'm on reddit... see what too much empathy makes you do? Do you get what I'm talking about, or should I start making analogies about cars and sports? I can go either way."

Don’t feel harmed—and you haven’t been."" / ""It’s silly to try to escape other peoples’ faults. They are inescapable. Just try to escape your own."" /  - Marcus Aurelius.   You have zero control over what other people say, think or do. That will never change no matter what. However, you have 100% control over your reactions to their actions/words. You can choose not to be hurt by what racist say or do.   Also remember that in fact they are the ones being hurt by acting in an unjust way. So when they say racist things you are not hurt but they are because they are acting in an unjust way instead of choosing the good.  2) Community: The acts and words of racists are clealy unjust and we therefore should work on chaning that. That could be done in many ways and I'm not sure which one is best but I guess just being moral and stand up against injustice and say ""This is wrong. Stop it."" when witnessing racism is a good start.  So, don't choose to be personally hurt by racism (because it is a choice to be hurt) and focus on your own actions. But stand up for the good of community and take a stand against racism. Not for your own sake but for others and for stopping injustice."
Stoicism,3adqjr,thedoorlocker,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:40:52 2015 UTC,"Hi there, sonofhekate. I'm Caucasian, so the sort of racism you experience is outside of my own experience, but I would like to pass on a way of thinking that has helped me.  When I encounter conflict I try to identify the problem, identify my resources and identify solutions. I try to focus on specifics so that I don't bog down.   So, an example might be: Dan is being approached by Officer Smith. Dan is with Wanda and Bill. Wanda and Bill have smart phones. Dan has had problems with Officer Smith before.  Problem: Dan may be harassed... he doesn't know at this point.  Resources: Wanda and Bill and their smart phones  Solution: Wanda and Bill politely record the exchange. If anything strange happens they immediately upload it to youtube.  Take it for whatever it's worth. I've just found this to be effective. Here's a recent example (which actually happened).  There was a knock at my door. I opened it. A police officer, smaller than me, took a step backward and put his hand on his weapon. He stared at me and didn't say anything.  I said ""Hello.""  He nodded. I realize that I'm a suspect. That's the problem. Resources: Stoicism and silence. Solution: I'm going to see what he's thinking and I'm going to be calm and polite. I'm not going to move suddenly.  My dog walks out of the house and sniffs his foot. He ignores the dog.  ""What's up?"" I say.  He stares at me awhile.  ""We got a call on a domestic disturbance at this address.""  ""Nope,"" I say. ""No disturbance here. Would you like me to get my wife?""  He looks around. My kids come to the door and say hello. He relaxes. Hand is now off the gun. He calls dispatch and finds out that they gave him the wrong address. He tells me that the disturbance involved a man beating his uncle with a garden hoe. My nearest uncle is two hours away...  Edit: and so that we're clear I was impressed by his professionalism, especially considering that in his mind I was probably a hoe-swinging madman. He did well. Still, it was strange being considered a suspect, and if some people experience that feeling more than others I see how it could be a hardship."

Stoicism,3abxec,anaxarchos,4,Thu Jun 18 21:15:55 2015 UTC,"I loved this paper. Stoicism as a living tradition no longer exists, but Buddhism does. I like how the authors constantly cited currently living Buddhist teachers, in order to better elucidate the texts. Unfortunately we can't do that for Stoicism anymore.  Wasn't so enamoured of how they limited themselves to the Pali suttas (not even the entirety of the Theravada tradition). Buddhism is massive, as befitting its multimillenial history and vast geographical span and the legions of gifted people that filled its ranks. But this is a preliminary exercise so that's excusable...  I personally think that even closer parallels could be made between Stoicism and some forms of Hinduism instead, where the existence of a lasting, permanent self is attributed, as opposed to Buddhism, where that's firmly denied. Stoicism is very much founded on this self. Buddhism firmly denies it.   Buddhism and Stoicism also have very much different ideas about salvation (soteriology), and that influences their respective ways of doing things. Buddhism generally valorises the monastery in a real way in order to ultimately eliminate suffering, like you actually leave your social position and family and become a member of a monastic community, Stoicism also advocates a withdrawl and retreat from the world but in an internal way, by changing yourself. The Stoics used to say that the only citizen, king, priest was the Stoic sage, because (true) citizenship, kingship, priesthood were different instantiations of wisdom which only the elite Stoic sage possessed. This means you can still be in society, in a sense. In fact, as a Stoic sage, you can be a representative and member of the true city, the cosmic city (the city of the cosmos).  Buddhism also poo-pooes the world of the ignorant rest, but it also really advocates isolation and retreat for those select people who want to truly advance to the elimination of suffering: just being a true citizen, a true king, a true philosopher, a true Roman etc isn't enough in Buddhism.  IMO the Buddhist saint would probably see Stoicism as just another way to get more firmly enmeshed in the power and social structures of the world, which is to be fair precisely what the Stoics wanted, because the more you understand your place in the world, and feel at home with Nature, the more you become like God. And that's their salvation.   But this isn't being fair to Buddhism, which is extremely diverse, and although I think it's fair to say that the task in early Buddhism is to separate yourself, Buddhists later came to think that samsara (the cycle of suffering) and nirvana (the end of suffering) is one and the same thing, which leads to the possibility of an affirmation of this world by a wise person."

Stoicism,3abxec,kazoodles,2,Fri Jun 19 12:44:39 2015 UTC,"First of all, SN 44:10. The Buddha did not deny or claim the existence of a self, due to the categorical error of such a conception, but permanence is certainly something he denied, considering that the mark of all things is impermanence and he was very opposed to the idea of an eternal, unchanging self as put forward by the Vedic Upanishads at the time.  Second, Buddhism is bigger than the Buddha, and the idea of a permanent self is DEFINITELY denied in Buddhism."
Stoicism,3abxec,paniniconqueso,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:15:34 2015 UTC,"The Buddha never denied nor claimed the existence of a permanent self.   The Buddha did not deny a self indeed, but he definitely denied a permanent self. This teaching is known as anatta which is one of the most central Buddhist teachings. According to Buddha there is no permanence at all and that is certainly true for the self.  The self the Buddha did not deny can be seen as what we may describe as an emergent phenomenon of several processes today. Traditionally these are called the khandhas (in Pali) or aggregates (in English): matter, sensation, perception, mental formations and consciousness."
Stoicism,3abxec,kazoodles,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:05:59 2015 UTC,"Anatta means ""not-self."" The teaching states that there are things that people mistake as part of your ""atta"" but are conditional and subject to change, therefor not-atta.   The Buddha told us what isn't the atta, but he didn't deny or accept the concept of the atta. It's a pointless question to ponder."
Stoicism,3abxec,respect_cat,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:45:28 2015 UTC,"I've always disagreed with the Buddhist concept that all beings want to attain happiness.   First, it makes the definition of happiness so broad as to be essentially meaningless. Second, if we narrow the definition of happiness, we are led into too many cases of special pleading, and it just doesn't accord with my own personal experience, or other ideas like biological evolution. If evolution shaped every creature to just seek happiness, then we'd have a narrower variety of behaviors in all living creatures. If you conflate the drive to happiness with other drives, and say that these other drives are a means to happiness, you eventually wind up with a meaningless definition of happiness again.   But other than that I think Buddhism is very useful and has quite a few insights sorely lacking in many other ancient philosophies."
Stoicism,3abxec,MisterDamek,4,Fri Jun 19 11:29:23 2015 UTC,"the Buddhist concept that all beings want to attain happiness   I'm no scholar of Buddhism, but I'm not sure that's an accurate representation of Buddhist claims, and to the extent it is, I think it reflects lingering problems of East-West translation. (Even ""attachment"" is better replaced with ""clinging"" as a word.)  My read of Buddhism is not that all beings want to attain happiness, but that all conscious beings experience an unsatisfactoriness in being, and that all conscious beings pursue means to ameliorate that unsatisfactoriness.  That strikes me as very different from ""all beings want to attain happiness,"" and also much truer."

I feel like everyone should have some 'rite of passage' experience, like motorcycling through India or hiking through the Amazon. Sure, there is a possibility of great harm and almost guarantee of suffering - but you'll be stronger when you finish.   I'm concerned that our culture today is too obsessed with 'amusing ourselves to death' -- clinging to social media and TV series hoping to feel pleasure at all times. It's almost like a Brave New World scenario.   But there are still many people who recognize the value of challenging oneself and overcoming adversity."

I've suffered from OCD since the age of 14 and depression since 19, the latter I have overcome (I'm 23 now) and the former will be with me for the rest of my life...talking about ""rites of passage""? Those were rites of passages, day in, day out, for years, from waking up to going to sleep in battle with the poison in your own mind. Motorcycling/hiking, it's external, it's something you can remove yourself from, detach from, something that isn't haunting you your every waking hour. I would not wish any of these upon my worst enemy and I certainly would not wish them up on anyone.   Those illnesses have taken away from me lost loves, missed opportunities, years of happiness, self esteem, limited my potential etc. etc. etc. No-one is going to make an epic biopic of mine and millions of others' battles with mental illnesses, there is no end prize or Valhalla awaiting me after death. Have I become stronger? Yes but I would swap that ""strength"" for peace of mind and for those missed opportunities in the one life I'll only ever get.

Think of others, one may feel debilitated and let himself go, another just accept it, a third uses feelings to improve his condition and in a world with over 7 billion people, don't forget you are never alone. You have already proven dynamism, adaptability and will far beyond most people, you didn't notice but Beethoven went through a similar process, lost his hearing and went on to compose and you have done a lot of the same.

I hope that you remember how valuable you are as a human being even if you do have what you consider to be your talent taken from you. That talent doesn't belong to you either, you could always have a stroke or a forced lobotomy and lose that part of your brain.  I'm not trying to depress you here, I want you to fight! What would you do if I snuck into your house at night and lobotomized out your talent for drawing??? Would you let me? So, what, you're just going to let the depressed part of your brain shut down your artistic impulse? You're not going to fight those neurons as hard as you would fight me with a scalpel???  Are you just the random assortment of skills needed to illustrate, or are you the heart of a constructive and cooperative human? If you're nothing more than an illustrator, then of course you're going to feel bad when you compare yourself to other illustrators, and you'll feel out of place if you can't illustrate. But you aren't your career, you're a creator."
Stoicism,3a8b3b,Relsneh15,3,Thu Jun 18 00:43:23 2015 UTC,"From this it seems the Masons were influenced by Stoic philosophy, but I am not sure if the book accurately depicts Freemasonry.   It's not a strictly accurate depiction, but it's not terribly far from the mark either. That said, Freemasonry draws from the breadth of the philosophical traditions of the West, including the Stoics, the Platonists and dozens of others. The actual degrees are a dense cipher of historical and philosophical ideas, and while there is a narrative there, it's not that of any one preceding view."
Stoicism,3a8b3b,aaronsherman,2,Thu Jun 18 14:20:03 2015 UTC,"""Virtue"" is far from a uniquely Stoic concept (edit: although it was perhaps more central to Stoicism that some others). It was common to many other ancient philosophies and Christianity, in many variations, and it persists still as an important element in some Christian denominations. The wikipedia article gives some idea of its prevalence. So, I'm not sure it says anything about Freemasonry (or Tolstoy) being influenced by Stoicism in particular, so much as influenced by general ethical and theological notions common in Europe at some times in history."

As a Freemason I can tell you that this passage is pretty darn close to what is said during one of the degrees. Yes, there is a striking similarity with what Stoicism teaches, but a few here have mentioned the notion of ""perennial"" human philosophy, and I agree that this idea falls under that category. It's probably not that we copied the idea, but rather that great minds think alike, and in doing so came to inevitably similar conclusions."

That's when we started openly accepting non-tradesmen into the ranks, and it definitely coincided with the publishing of Euclid's geometrics (which could be construed as trade secrets for stonemasons) and the subsequent drop in necessity to join a guild to learn the work, but there were a lot of other factors too. And I'm pretty sure that although the Halliwell Manuscript dates to the very early Renaissance, it's been regarded as a copy of an older document, the implication being that Freemasonry pre-dates the Renaissance."

And although there are some big gaps in the record, which seems to proceed by leaps and bounds, there can be no doubt that unpublished and unpopularised discoveries, unlike Euclid's geometry, (which was used in English schools until comparatively recently - it became redundant in the early 20th century,) have been made in the study of antiquities, eg., stone inscriptions.

I think your interpretation is the best I've heard or thought of.  At that time in the Roman Empire, only a Philosopher would choose to grow out a beard. Wearing one marked a man as a philosopher.   It is interesting to note that Epictetus' hypothetical discourse near the end, about refusing to let a tyrant shave his beard, isn't as improbable as you might think. The Roman Emperor Domitian banned philosophers from Rome in A.D 95 and had the beard of one called Apollonius of Tyana forcibly shaved off when he violated the ban. Many other philosophers shaved their beards to go into hiding."

Stoicism,3a03f3,gronnsaker,7,Thu Jun 18 04:19:24 2015 UTC,"Supplementing the answer from /u/SimulateAnnealing, a traditional Stoic philosopher would find this completely unsurprising. Virtue (arete) (in the classical Stoic connotations closer to the modern notions of ""excellence of character"" or just ""being a good person"" than the more modern Christian-influenced conception of ""virtue"") is necessary for flourishing (eudaimonia), the closest concept they had to fulfilment.  For ancient Stoic sources, I highly recommend Seneca's Of Peace of Mind and Of a Happy Life.   For modern sources, not (to my knowledge) influenced by Stoicism but in good agreement with it, I recommend MacAskill's essay The best career advice you'll never hear in a graduation speech and Seligman's  book Authentic Happiness.   There seem to be two faces of Stoicism, one (exemplified by Epictetus) focused on how to best handle external ""misfortune"", and the other (exemplified (edit: or perhaps ""described"" would be a better word) by Seneca) focused on how to best handle external ""fortune"". Ultimately, both boil down to the same central principles, but they end up looking rather different.  Edit: One of my favourite quotes is from the MacAskill:   If you want lasting job satisfaction, you should do something you find meaningful. And the best way to do something you find meaningful is to do something that actually is meaningful."

Stoicism,3a03f3,MinotaurWarrior,3,Wed Jun 17 02:51:13 2015 UTC,"Life is more like performance art than a building contract, closer to dance or live music than painting. What matters is how it is lived, not what it results in. Nothing that happens before or after can enhance or degrade a moment of virtue or of vice; every moment stands alone.   Virtue is valuable simply because it is virtue, not because of what it results in. We do have to think about the long run to figure out what is or isn't virtuous, but ultimately, I think it is ""the long run"" that doesn't matter. The whole purpose of value judgements is to make the best choices given the information we have and the circumstances we are in, and if we do this, what is the point in judging anything else at all? (This does raise the question of ""what is virtuous"", for which I refer you to the comments of this recent post.)  Transience if multifaceted; depending on your perspective, it can be demoralizing or inspiring, can make you feel vast, or minuscule. Every movement of every atom in your body is part of the intricate web of the history of the universe, processed in the hearts of stars or created in the big bang itself, and follows all the same physical laws when it becomes part of you, and leaves you again. We are not even the same day to day or moment to moment; each of us continually changes. Our boundaries are not as discrete as we think, but each of us and everything else that exists is a brief passage in the greatest performance there can be, each decision a momentary note or phrase. The only thing that matters is: what kind will it be?

You should seek to act for the benefit of humanity, your nation, your community, your friend & family, and yourself. This also meshes pretty well with modern psychological research. A sense of fulfilment comes from meaningful relationships, and a sense of belonging and service to something greater than yourself. What the Stoics add that this fulfilment isn't dependent on actually dependant upon having these things, but simply being the sort of person who would if he could. But especially in our modern society, that's a corner case that's unlikely to be relevant to you. Yes, virtue is possible even in solitary confinement or exile to a small island, but you can focus on the situations you yourself will likely encounter, where fulfilling relationships and service to a greater cause are possible."

You should always act to benefit your self. That way if you do or are any good you will automatically benefit humanity and the cosmopolis.   These are more or less mirrors. The stoic benefits himself by being virtuous and because he's virtuous his acts benefit others. But I think it's more accurate to say that you act for the benefit of others and think in such a way as to benefit yourself.    As for ""your nation, your community, your friend and family"" well where does it say in the Stoic sources that you should act to benefit your nation? And what do you mean by ""your community""? And as for your friends and family - the Stoic doesn't have any friends except other Stoics; and as for the notion of ""family"" does that include your slaves too? Remember, the institution of slavery was closely related to that of a man's family.   Epictetus supposedly got his start lecturing his master on how he shouldn't maim his slaves because doing so was an injury to himself (which was kinda like a pun based on archaic law. Iirc 12 tables table 10 law 1? The one about the rights of a paterfamilias), so yes, I think concern for slaves would theoretically fall under the same category as concern for family. But of course my dad can't just straight-up kill me whenever he feels like it, I shouldn't own slaves, and if I shouldn't put on my black robe awry to toss traitors from the tarpeian rock or tie up parricides in sacks with vicious Beasts and then toss those sacks into the river Tiber. Roman law was crazy. I think we're all on board with that, just like we're all on board with the idea that Zeus isn't real.   Both Marcus Aurelius and Seneca talk about concern for your nation fairly often. Now, admittedly, that was also their jobs, so I suppose it's possible that the concern for the nation wasn't stoic per se, but simply a contagion from the careers of a few Stoics.   Stoics were divided on the topic of friendship. Seneca says to befriend non Stoics and draw them in, epictetus says flat out to not have non stoic friends.  By ""your community"" I basically mean whatever is most relevant to you between the scope of nation & your friends / family. I believe at least Marcus Aurelius places your city in that level, but our modern relationship with cities is hugely different from the ancient relationship with cities."
Stoicism,39ye8c,photios-knut,6,Mon Jun 15 20:19:50 2015 UTC,"I think stoic justice is a bit grander than that. Empathy can be, and frequently is, injust. Consider the nepotist who, out of empathy for his family, treats them with favor. Consider the LEO who, out of empathy,  lets a drunk driver go without a citation because they themselves have driven drunk and understand the motives behind it. Consider the person who, out of empathy for a peer, covers their mistakes and allows them to continue to harm others whose feelings are more distant and hard to discern.  Stoic justice is cosmopolitan. It is concerned chiefly with the wellbeing of all rational animals. If the wellbeing of the greatest community is not effected, then the wellbeing of one's nation is the next greatest concern, then perhaps ones region, ones city, ones neighborhood and then ones family and friends, with yourself being last.   Now, empathy is more just than selfishness, by a degree, but one who is motivated by empathy will be injust towards all those they cannot empathize with.  To start with, humans seem to have a finite capacity for true empathy. We can only come to understand so many people, and only people so close to us in space and custom. I cannot empathize with the billions of humans who live in Asia, because they are too many and have too much diversity of experience for me to fully understand, and as well they are too far away for me to come to know sufficiently well for true empathy, and there are innumerable barriers in the way they conduct their lives for me to understand. I would need to learn Mandarin or urdu or Arabic, and philosophical frameworks for seeing the world, and social norms, and cultural touchstones, and big history from their PoV, and their local history, and their family history, and a thousand other things. It's impossible to act with empathy towards the billions of individual human beings on the earth.  I really think that, especially in our modern world, this is incredibly import to keep in mind. I know someone who works in a small office and remotely manages a large team of Indian professionals. If she acted with empathy, that would disproportionately favor those few in her office who she could empathize with. If she acted with selfishness, that would cause unjust suffering for all but her. It is only by acting with justice that exceeds either selfishness or empathy that all can be treated rightly. For everyone though, we can only be empathetic to a small minority of those our actions affect. If I'm in a mall with a friend, I can empathize with that friend, and perhaps I can exercise a weak form of empathy with the worker I see, but if my friend begins crying hysterically I can't empathize with the invisible listeners behind columns and racks, or those they effect in their professional lives, or their friends and family. If I acted purely with selfishness, I would simply abandon my friend and travel somewhere quieter. If I was simply acting on empathy, I would seek only to comfort my friend, and allow this friend to cry their heart out for so long as it seemed to benefit them. If I acted justly, I would attempt to assist my friend, while minimizing the disturbance done to others. In a sense, simple empathy is selfishness for the sake of another person.   In another way, it is useful to consider the components of the word empathy. The -pathy has the same root as pathogen, pathological, and passion. It is important to not allow empathy to inflict others passions upon you, or in other words, to turn empathy into a means of acquiring vice from others. Epictetus specifically warns against this, advising that the stoic stay away from unstoic friends, and be careful not to be moved away by gossip and stories of trifling things. Do not let your opinion add anything to the observation that another is suffering in response to some external situation.  For example: recently, a teenager I know had unprotected sex with another teenager, and subsequently had a pregnancy scare. I recognized that this was a significant issue for her. I recognized it was entirely irrelevant to anyone outside of close network of friends and family, and his network of friends and family, and so there was no reason to consider the needs of larger communities in handling it. I didn't worry at all, because what was going on had no ability to make me worse. I did not allow my opinion to add or subtract anything from the situation. But I comprehended this girl's feelings and did what I could to bring her comfort using a certain sort of empathy to guide my actions.  In summary: dispassionate empathy is a part of Justice, and sometimes it's the most relevant part, but not always. Sometimes, being focused only on those you can empathize with would lead to injustice towards those you cannot empathize with."

Not so much ""making things right"" as ""things will balance out in the long run, and justice is done eventually"". Also, in personal action, what are we ""justified"" in thinking/doing in regards to our sphere of authority?  I should not have to cultivate empathy if it is already there in the 1st place, nor am I obligated to act from empathy.   Empathy is not automatically compassion; it is recognition of other's subjectivity as like our own but with different attributes -depending on the circumstances.   Compassion and Disgust are both sourced in empathy; itself a raw sensation.  EDIT: Virtue should already be present in terms of recognizing something which has been there all along. A person who ""works at"" being virtuous is expending precious vitality in practicing what they have already mastered."

If you are not obligated to act from empathy, what are you obligated to act from? What is the principle that underlies justice? Mutual obligation? Will-wishing?  You've clearly thought a bit about this, based on this and other comments I realize my understanding is a bit...fuzzy. I really appreciate your help in this :)."
Stoicism,39ye8c,GreenLanternWilliam,2,Tue Jun 16 23:54:39 2015 UTC,"Justice comes from Nature as understood through interdependency, emergent properties of evolutionary process, impermanence, and how we primates are enmeshed with Nature, while at the same time, operating as if we are ""children of divine beings"".  Radical Justice is Nature balancing itself. Societal Justice is artificial, and part of all the social contracts we have devised since humans organized into politicized groups. I interpret Epictetus as saying ""...Nature is beyond our control, and has it's own 'justice'; we have Duty, and that is related to what we can control or not control within society -our jurisdiction...""  If empathy results in spontaneous compassion, and it is within our jurisdiction to act, then normally, we have the Duty to act. However, using Duty as a standard (stagnated ethical principles) means ""Dudley do-right"" is on the scene, and will usually make things worse because of his/her automatic thinking in regards to ""right and wrong""."
Stoicism,39ye8c,GreenLanternWilliam,2,Wed Jun 17 18:58:36 2015 UTC,"I think that our brains are naturally equipped to feel that empathetic vibration, since it is constructive on the level of the psyche. You should get a sort of empathy from your cosmopolitanism, so that even if you run into that non-living self-aware nebula cluster in deep space, you won't consider it better or worse than humanity. But that natural empathy we feel barely translates even to other animals, let alone every constructive force in the cosmos.  As far as the stoic definition of justice goes, I won't pretend to understand it, but it seems to be a response to the concept of the state as a constructive organism that deserves your respect (the Cynics would have something to say about this, I'm sure). Therefore, the root of Justice would be first to rationally understand the nature of the state you are living in.  I think that empathy is really more like a passion than a virtue- you see somebody hurt themselves, and your brain lights up with negative chemicals that tell you the universe has gone wrong. It can help you see a course of right action, just like lust or anger can. But I know that my first order of business is keeping myself free."
Stoicism,39ye8c,Mystletainn_kick,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:08:18 2015 UTC,"I've always understood empathy as the intellectual effort to understand someone else's feelings, thoughts and interests rather than something automatic.  The idea of the state as an organism also makes me wary. Perhaps I'm too much of a child of the enlightenment. Also, look at all the horrible states that exist in the world today. Does North Korea deserve our respect? Even if we were citizens of it?"
Stoicism,39x8kj,LesWes,14,Mon Jun 15 15:24:02 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, stoicism also advocates rational thinking and not making rash emotional decisions.  Are there other people that depend on you? If so, then ""career suicide"" would be incredibly selfish.  In fact, you should be the best you can at whatever you are doing in the moment. The idea of deliberately sabotaging your career or just slogging along doing the minimum is decidedly un-stoic.  Also, your career is an external. It is an indifferent. You need to shift your perspective and realize that your career isn't nuking your happiness, you are.  If you feel like it is in your path to change careers, then I suggest you don't be hasty. Do your absolute best at your job and plot and plan your next move. When it is time for you to drop the hammer, have something else lined up already. Doing it this way will also show your next employer that you are reliable and not subject to flights of emotional fancy. You will come off as cool, stable, and professional.  EDIT: I would guess that these types of thoughts are rooted in a failed expectation of how you thought your life would turn out. Maybe you woke up one morning and realized that you weren't an astronaut or a Power Ranger like you wanted to be? It may sound very un-American, but you should teach yourself to want the job you do have first."

I'm not saying you should quit; I'm just saying that I happened to have read this recently and I think that it may apply:  "" Besides, which would you rather have, a sum of money, or a faithful and honorable friend? Rather assist me, then, to gain this character, than require me to do those things by which I may lose it. Well, but my country, say you, as far as depends upon me, will be unassisted. Here, again, what assistance is this you mean? It will not have porticos nor baths of your providing? And what signifies that? Why, neither does a smith provide it with shoes, nor a shoemaker with arms. It is enough if every one fully performs his own proper business. And were you to supply it with another faithful and honorable citizen, would not he be of use to it? Yes. Therefore neither are you yourself useless to it. ""What place, then,"" say you, "" shall I hold in the state?"" Whatever you can hold with the preservation of your fidelity and honor. But if, by desiring to be useful to that, you lose these, how can you serve your country, when you have become faithless and shameless?""  I don't know..."
Stoicism,39x8kj,GreenLanternWilliam,3,Mon Jun 15 15:50:37 2015 UTC,"I do think there is a fair amount of shamelessness in taking a good salary to provide a service to a company you don't care for, in an industry you don't respect, with people you don't particularly like, solely because the pay is good.    I don't feel I'm choosing between a sum of money and an honorable friend though.  I'm choosing between a sum of money for X years and a lessor sum of money for >X years that may (or may NOT) be more honorable.    I certainly don't work out of feelings of fealty to the general public to be productive.    Thank you for the quote!  It is good fodder for continuing to think on this."
Stoicism,39x8kj,dmedlock4rc,2,Mon Jun 15 16:18:45 2015 UTC,"What he is saying is that there are jobs that you could take that aren't contrary to your nature as a constructive, active force in the universe.  My brother is a chef; I'm training to work in a zoo. He uses his creativity and ingenuity to inspire others and run a team of like-minded individuals. I want to help the poorest species of the world, even if it means cleaning up their poop, and I get so much joy from the faces of children when they see an animal.  Money isn't this real thing that people tell you it is. The vast majority of wealth is locked up in giant piles of money that very few people own. If you were working for land instead of money, would you be okay with 1% of the population owning 50% of the land? No, you would just concede that the soil belongs the them, and not worry about ownership over it.  Just because you have a comparitively higher income than some or a lower income than others does not mean that you actually own any of your money. The money is always going to be magnetically attracted to one of those $10bn+ piles instead of your own account. Even if you save up a bunch of money in your account, there's no telling what could happen to the currency you depend on. Even the fabulously wealthy have been laid low by economic conflicts, so what chance do we have?  You say that you're not choosing between a sum of money and an honorable friend. Fair enough. But Epictetus isn't saying that you're making a choice between getting money and getting a friend. To stoics, the universe views your actions. Your actions are motivated by money while you are at your job because you think that you can own it. You have transformed from a sage into a pile of debt as soon as you agree that currency is a valid way of judging things."

If you have the free time why don't you use that to plan or explore other, more fulfilling options?  Your career doesn't have to be your purpose. You could do some community volunteering or something along those lines to find fulfillment in your life.   Also, what faculties do you have to endure your current situation? Patience, endurance, acceptance, the reason to assess and plan for other options? Employ that faculty for the time being that you'll have to accept you aren't exactly where you would like to be career-wise.  Be rational about it, doing sabotage to yourself would be counterproductive and foolish. Trying to get yourself fired is an attempt to cop out of the responsibility of making your own decisions. Human beings have endured much worse, and you're capable of enduring more than you think. That being said, you do have some power to begin to change your situation. So start doing what you can. Research other options, get necessary education/certifications, apply to other jobs. That will take time, and in the meantime you'll have to endure your present situation.

Stoicism,39x8kj,evil_capitalist123,2,Mon Jun 15 18:56:53 2015 UTC,"You seem to be torn between a desire for money and the things it buys, and a fear of your work place. You should try to hold both of these motives in contempt.  Marcus Aurelius talks about job dissatisfaction at length. He often disliked his coworkers, disliked his work environment, disliked his job duties, and seems to have thought he wasn't terribly clever and disliked asking cleverer people for help. Sometimes, his distaste for his job left him struggling to get out of bed, as he'd've rather stayed in bed than gone to work. This might not be readily apparent on a first read, because what the emperor writes down is his contempt for these motives, not the motives themselves. What he has concluded is that if stoic doctrine states you can live a good life even when imprisoned, then you can live a good life even in a palace. You can also live a good life in a cube.   The stoic contempt for money and the things it buys is perhaps too obvious to state.   What you should do is try to be a virtuous person. At work, be just, be courageous, be temperate, be wise. If you feel dissatisfied, examine the dissatisfaction in depth - so far as it pertains to external things, hold it in contempt, but if there is some suspicion that you might be acting intemperately, foolishly, unjustly, or cowardly, be averse to these vices. Perhaps there is a cowardly motive behind not leaving for another job - or perhaps there is something cowardly preventing you from improving the position you're in (e.g. if you only went out on a limb and asked, you could find more useful things to do). Perhaps you are being unjust by holding onto a job another person would be better suited to, or perhaps leaving it would be unjust and do more harm than good for purely selfish reasons.  Nobody here can really tell you whether to stay or go. What I think we can say is that the way you're currently looking at the problem is unstoic."

I'm currently in a period of restructuring my life so I can earn more in a job that I'd like more.   If I were you, I would head to HR and try to negotiate for at least partial telecommuting. If you do work at home, you can eliminate commuting and use more of your money/time towards things that you like.

So in the moment of anger I simply repeat to myself that it will pass with time and to not do anything that I will regret. When the anger passes I make sure to reflect on my actions during that time. I thank my past self for keeping calm and move on with my day.  For help with keeping calm I ask myself ""Why is this making me angry?"". 90% of the time I come to the realization that what is causing these emotions is completely trivial and not worth the energy. This usually comes from external sources of anger like arguing with someone.   If that doesn't work and im still angry, I use the anger as a burst of motivation to make a plan or set a goal for the future in order to avoid whatever was causing me to be angry. For example, internal souces of anger like failure.  With practice this will become much easier."

Ignoring the problem is hard because they live with you and if they're doing the thing right now, say loud music and they refuse to turn it down, there's a constant reminder of the problem."
Stoicism,39w5ud,Silthanis,2,Mon Jun 15 15:05:36 2015 UTC,"You already know this from your work on worry, but reminders can be helpful.  I'll draw from the Meditations here:   If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.   It isn't your roommate that causes you to be angry - it is your own thoughts and opinions about them and their actions.  Marcus Aurelius' morning reminder is a good place to approach this from.  Your roommate may be self-absorbed, inconsiderate, obnoxious, and rude - all because they are ignorant of what is good and evil.  It is not the actions that anger you, but your expectation that they should act differently.  The other approach is to recognize that your anger comes from the belief that they are causing you harm.  Again from the Meditations:   Let opinion be taken away, and no man will think himself wronged. If no man shall think himself wronged, then is there no more any such thing as wrong."
Stoicism,39w5ud,jimstride,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:42:25 2015 UTC,"Other thoughtless and inconsiderate people's loud music can be hell to put up with. You just have to rise superior to it - which is very difficult. Maybe begin by repeating over to yourself the fact that the planet is over-populated with pathetic mindless morons, anti-social bastards, who can't help being a damned nuisance and who are mostly probably totally unaware of it. Sorry to couch it in these terms but giving vent to strong language is better than bottling things up. Earplugs aren't much good - why should you have to wear them? What have you done wrong? Nothing - so far as we know. So just phrase the whole matter differently, look at things in a different way, so that you don't get upset, so that it makes you laugh - it can be done, I've done it myself (and I'm nothing special, if I can do it anyone can.) And if you get any spare time read about Diogenes the Cynic and his curious way of looking at the world. The world is a bit of a madhouse I'm afraid! Don't give up the Stoic cause."
Stoicism,39w5ud,teamnewg,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:20:10 2015 UTC,"The same logic you apply to worry can be applied here.   If there's something you can do about it, do it, and be productive instead of angry.   If there isn't, realise that your anger is only hurting you, not affecting any change in your circumstances, and is therefore pointless and wholly detrimental.   Loud music for example, you can ask for it to be turned down, you can move out. But, if the roommate ignores you, and you're stuck in a lease which the landlord won't let you out of, then your anger is unproductive. You need to buy some earplugs, and plan for the day you can get out of the lease, or some other action."
Stoicism,39w5ud,sortefugl,3,Mon Jun 15 15:14:24 2015 UTC,"To me, it's recognizing the futility of anger and sheer force of will.  Anger is an emotional response, that wrestles away conscious controls of your faculties. For instance, I was in a hurry yesterday because I needed to print some rapports for an exam. My printer didn't work, and I felt the anger start to bubble up. ""How typical!"". ""Why won't it work?! I just bought new ink!"".  However, I immediately recognized that thinking like that and expressing my anger would only needlessly consume my energy, and make me irrational. So I kept my cool by sheer force of will (Even though it is a hard habit to break: Of all the infernal and anger-inducing things in the world, printers are lucifer incarnate). That helped me to locate and solve the problem: A dirty ink nozzle that I fixed with distilled water and a cotton swab.   Had I lost control and gotten angry in that situation, I probably would have started hammering on it. That wouldn't have solved anything, it would probably make it worse.  I can't think of any instances where anger is helpful."
Stoicism,39w5ud,Silthanis,2,Mon Jun 15 18:07:56 2015 UTC,"Anger can be a spur to action.  Having been pricked by it, though, the purpose is served and we can act without it.  Passions are indifferent, unless we cling to them."
Stoicism,39w5ud,son_of_bokonon,4,Wed Jun 17 10:45:09 2015 UTC,"I'd say that you're taking the first step towards a solution by acknowledging that you're getting angry in the first place. You seem to have categorized it with being worried, and that helps as well. Something that a lot of people try to do is forgo this step and try to make themselves never angry. That's a ridiculous thing to try to do, and it rarely ever works.    I'd practice a bit by studying the methods you use to ease your worry and see how they can translate into addressing anger. Odds are you'll find something that'll be analogous enough to work into a good method. As I'm sure you're aware, it's a lot tougher to deal with anger than it is doubt, worry, or just about any other emotion, so there'll be a good deal of work you may need to put into making your current methods compatible with dealing with anger.       /u/ObjectsinTheMirror makes a number of good points as well, especially when he talks about realizing what you're angry with. Stoicism deals a great deal in understanding what is within our scope of control and what isn't. By analyzing the current situation (the one that's making you angry), you can determine whether it's within your control or isn't. If it's not, then your anger is wasted, no matter how hard you rage. If you find that there is something you can do to change the situation, your emotional energy could be of better use in resolving the conflict.    As an aside, someone on this sub suggested to me a few weeks ago to reach beyond just Stoicism in regards to the viewpoints of life and how different practices and disciplines handle things like this. I was pointed in the direction of Thich Naht Hahn's work. He's a buddhist monk that has written a ton of work, and from what I've read thus far, it's all very valuable. One book in particular addresses your issue directly. Anger, Wisdom for cooling the flames was the first thing I read by him. There's a number of practices in the book that I've found helpful for dealing with anger. It focuses a great deal on the practice of mindfulness and recognizing that your anger as a part of you that should be comforted instead of controlled. Also, some of the maxims found in the book are very close in nature of Stoicism, which is nice. If you're into that sort of thing, I'd definitely check it out."
Stoicism,39w5ud,MinotaurWarrior,2,Mon Jun 15 11:04:59 2015 UTC,"Taking the cosmic view - consider how the situation appears from outside. Think of another person in a similar situation and how you'd feel about that. E.g if you're a British person being passed up for a raise because of nepotism, think about a German person being passed up for a raise because of nepotism.  Practice with small angers. Did you burn your hand cooking, and you're experiencing an instinctive anger driven by pain? Practice your anger management techniques on this. Anger that you know will naturally subside on their own are the perfect cases to practice your anger management techniques.   If it is another person that angers you, consider that either they are not behaving badly, in which case there is no wrong but your anger, or they are behaving badly, in which case it is only some outward sign of an injury they have done to themselves. For instance, in the case of the nepotist employer, they are the only one being made worse by their greed, if truly they are being nepotistic.   If there is anything your anger drives you to do, try to wait to do it until your anger has subsided. Everything well done is better done without anger, and it's possible anger is seducing you by associating itself with certain useful acts - in particular as the vice of anger often acts as a counter to the vice of cowardice.   That's some of what I try to do."

I am not trying to sell you on this idea in the sense of converting you to it, I want you to play with it. I want you to think of its possibilities, I am not trying to prove it. I am just putting it forward as a possibility of life to think about. So then, let’s suppose that you were able every night to dream any dream you wanted to dream, and that you could for example have the power within one night to dream 75 years of time, or any length of time you wanted to have.  And you would, naturally, as you began on this adventure of dreams, you would fulfill all your wishes. You would have every kind of pleasure during your sleep. And after several nights of 75 years of total pleasure each you would say “Well that was pretty great”. But now let’s have a surprise, let’s have a dream which isn’t under control, where something is gonna happen to me that I don’t know what it's gonna be.  And you would dig that and would come out of that and you would say “Wow that was a close shave, wasn’t it?”. Then you would get more and more adventurous and you would make further- and further-out gambles what you would dream. And finally, you would dream where you are now. You would dream the dream of living the life that you are actually living today.  That would be within the infinite multiplicity of choices you would have. Of playing that you weren't god, because the whole nature of the godhead, according to this idea, is to play that he is not. So in this idea then, everybody is fundamentally the ultimate reality, not god in a politically kingly sense, but god in the sense of being the self, the deep-down basic whatever there is. And you are all that, only you are pretending you are not."
Stoicism,39xpb3,Skrioman,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:27:21 2015 UTC,"This doesn't sound very Stoic to me at all, more like Hindu or Jewish mysticism. As far as I understand it, Stoicism doesn't see our fate as self-imposed. Rather, it is imposed from without, and we should deal with it in the best possible way."
Stoicism,39uiuj,ronaldinjo,18,Sun Jun 14 22:08:25 2015 UTC,"I personally think that the idea of a ""sage"" is more useful as an ideal rather than a practical goal. If I build a machine following a design, the measurements may be presented as exact values, and the machine may work best if all parts are infinitely hard, built to infinite precision, sliding surfaces are frictionless, etc., and thinking about the machine in this way is certainly easiest. However, one never expects to actually build such a machine.   The early ancient Stoic view was that virtue was a binary condition, that all virtuous people were perfect in their virtuousness, while all those with any character imperfections were equally vicious. In some contexts, this is helpful, just as it is helpful in mathematics to talk about perfectly flat planes even when there are not perfectly planar surfaces in the real world, while in others contexts, I find this approach more than a little problematic.  I find practical philosophy a bit like exercise. When I have been making a habit of doing exercises, I am closer to my ideal than when I have not, when the habits have lapsed. Just as all athletes have limits on how much they can lift, how fast and far they can run, etc., so too, I think, with philosophy.   When I am in my best physical shape, doing aerobic exercise for an hour a day 6 days a week and lifting 30 minutes a day on 3 days a week, I am in far better shape than I am when I have not. In neither case am I particularly unusual. People in far better shape than I are commonplace even when I am in the best of shape, and those in far worse shape than myself are commonplace even when I have been doing nothing.  In physical conditioning, people start with a wide variety of physical attributes and constitutions, and upbringing and day-to-day life exert an enormous influence. There are many exercise programs, many of which are effective for at least some people, even many of those based on thoroughly misguided ideas about why they might work. In many cases, what is needed is a good fit between exercise and individual.   The situation is similar, I think, for moral and emotional self-improvement. For some people, their daily lives and circumstances turn them into virtuous people all on their own. In others, one or another religious, spiritual, psychological or philosophical practice might produce excellence of character, while similar (or even the exact same) practices might result in severe  emotional or moral injury to another individual. (See Steven Weinberg's quote about religion and good people doing evil things.)   What do I mean by Stoic exercises? All modern practices put forward as ""Stoic exercises"" are enormously speculative, but there is good evidences that such exercises did exist and were central to the education of a Stoic philosopher. Consider, for example,  Musonius Rufus's Lecture VI.   Many of the modern practices do at least have some ancient inspiration, but there are no detailed ancient accounts of what the exercises consisted of, so I think ""inspiration"" is about as strong a connection as can be reasonably asserted. The ones for which the evidence is strongest are the more ascetic ones, deliberately practising enduring discomfort or pain, or doing without pleasures, but I think the historical exercises went well beyond these.  My view that they are highly speculative doesn't mean I don't think the other exercises (or at least some of them) are useful, though. I recommend looking at some of the exercises in this section of the FAQ. One of the short, free, and online Stoic-week handbooks (like this one) might be a good place to start. Personally, I gravitate more toward the writing-based exercises and away from the Buddhist-inspired mindfulness or modern psychology inspired ""visualization"" based exercises in these books. (I do, however, sometimes turn visualization exercises into written exercises.)"

While a calculator can exhibit virtue (arete), virtue for a calculator is very different from virtue for a human being, because the ""nature"" (in the technical Stoic sense) of a human being is different from the nature of a calculator. A calculator cannot distinguish good from bad from indifferent; it does not seek to act in the best interests of the society of rational beings, or regard them with affection, or perform any of the roles a human should play in society."
Stoicism,39uiuj,cleomedes,5,Tue Jun 16 12:54:01 2015 UTC,"I'm convinced that (at least part of) stoicism is about rewiring our brains to put a circuit breaker between perception and reaction. The daily disciplines of stoicism (maxims, meditation, negative visualization etc) are really about establishing a kind of mental ""muscle memory"" that kicks in automatically to wrestle control of ourselves away from our sympathetic nervous system during times of stress.  When you get cut off in traffic you don't make a conscious decision to lose your calm. Typically as soon as I remember to be stoic in a given situation the overwrought emotions drain away as if by magic. The problem is remembering to remember.  The longer you practice the disciplines the more time you spend in a ""stoic state of mind"" and the quicker you get back to it when your peace gets disturbed."
Stoicism,39uiuj,SelfHelpForBastards,3,Mon Jun 15 00:50:26 2015 UTC,"Of course it's possible. Speaking from personal experience, I've found myself to be more Stoic with the passage of time. I think becoming more Stoic is also a natural part of maturing because as kids, we want this and that because we think the world is small, but as adults, we realize that the world is a huge place, and our control over it is minimal. It'll take time, but many people will begin to accept their lack of power over their environment, and focus on themselves instead. Unfortunately, not everyone comes to this realization, and continue to fight against the flow of things.  Another part of it is (I think it's called) cognitive behavioral therapy where we think of things a certain way, and we just keep reinforcing those ideas until our mind accepts it. For example, I keep telling myself in my head that I need to stop caring about X and Y, and eventually, I will come to stop caring about X and Y."

Stoicism,39upab,dmedlock4rc,2,Sun Jun 14 23:06:14 2015 UTC,"I agree that self-respect is really important.  A lot of our problems stem from a lack of self-respect and self-compasion.  A person who eats to much doesn't respect themselves. A person who stays in shitty relationships doesn't respect themselves. A person who drinks to much alcohol doesn't respect themselves. A person who doesn't exercise (except those physically incapable) doesn't respect themselves. A person who is looking for validation by fucking anyone who'll have them doesn't respect themselves.  You know that line people always say ""You have to love yourself before someone else can love you."" Well, I think it's more important to respect yourself. If you don't respect yourself who the fuck else would respect you?  It's kind of a hard thing to do, too. Especially if you've been disrespecting yourself for a while. A fat person has a hard time respecting themselvs because they look in the mirror and say something like ""I'm a fucking mess. No one in their right mind is going to respect me."" So they continue to not respect themselves by eating and sitting on ass. It's a vicious cycle. This is how ""fake it until you make it"" comes in to play, but faking it only gets you so far. You actually have to make it at some point. Doing that will start a cycle of you respecting yourself. You'll start eating better and exercising because you respect yourself. You'll say no to that piece of cake, or going out drinking, or taking abuse in a relationship because you respect yourself."

Complaining on how men are treated in society (as if men have much of any real disadvantage) rather than focusing on what every person can do to better themselves. But I digress.  Could you explain in some more detail the differnece between these two concepts? The article mentions that self respect is how you treat yourself and how you let others treat you. How can you disallow someone to treat you a certain way? The only thing you control is your reaction. I don't see the benefit of speraring self esteem and self respect but I'm glad you got something out of it.

Her fate is outside of your sphere of choice, how you react to her fate is in your sphere of choice.  Also, everything that lives will one day die. No one is immortal."
Stoicism,39tbxj,cleomedes,8,Sun Jun 14 17:22:08 2015 UTC,"Grief and consolation were a major concern both for the Stoics and other classical schools of philosophy. The most extensive discussion I am aware of is from Cicero; see a modern account here or Cicero's The Tusculan Disputations. Seneca wrote a number of consolation letters, some of which you might find useful.  My favourite quote from Seneca is from Seneca's Of Consolation: To Polybius, a letter of consolation to a friend whose brother had died:   As for Fortune herself, although I cannot just now plead her cause before you, because all that she has given us is now hateful to you, because she has taken something away from you, yet I will plead her cause as soon as time shall have rendered you a more impartial judge of her action: indeed she has bestowed much upon you to make amends for the injury which she has done you, and she will give more hereafter by way of atonement for it: and, after all, it was she herself who gave you this brother whom she has taken away. Forbear, then, to display your abilities against your own self, or to take part with your grief against yourself: your eloquence, can, no doubt, make trifles appear great, and, conversely, can disparage and depreciate great things until they seem the merest trifles; but let it reserve those powers and use them on some other subject, and at the present time devote its entire strength to the task of consoling you. Yet see whether even this task be not unnecessary. Nature demands from us a certain amount of grief, our imagination adds some more to it; but I will never forbid you to mourn at all. I know, indeed, that there are some men, whose wisdom is of a harsh rather than a brave character, who say that the wise man never would mourn. It seems to me that they never can have been in the position of mourners, for otherwise their misfortune would have shaken all their haughty philosophy out of them, and, however much against their will, would have forced them to confess their sorrow. Reason will have done enough if she does but cut off from our grief all that is superfluous and useless: as for her not allowing us to grieve at all, that we ought neither to expect nor to wish for. Let her rather restrain us within the bounds of a chastened grief, which partakes neither of indifference nor of madness, and let her keep our minds in that attitude which becomes affection without excitement: let your tears flow, but let them some day cease to flow: groan as deeply as you will, but let your groans cease some day: regulate your conduct so that both philosophers and brothers may approve of it. Make yourself feel pleasure in often thinking about your brother, talk constantly about him, and keep him ever present in your memory; which you cannot succeed in doing unless you make the remembrance of him pleasant rather than sad: for it is but natural that the mind should shrink from a subject which it cannot contemplate without sadness. Think of his retiring disposition, of his abilities for business, his diligence in carrying it out, his loyalty to his word. Tell other men of all his sayings and doings, and remind your own self of them: think how good he was and how great you hoped he might become: for what success is there which you might not safely have wagered that such a brother would win?   The emphasized sentence (emphasis mine) is, I think, particularly important, seeming to mark the dividing line between ""impression"" or ""feeling"" and ""passion"" in the Stoic theory of emotion. (See the discussion and assorted quotes here.) The ""abilities"" he is referring to is, I think, rational argument and rhetoric, and I take him to mean that there is nothing wrong with the ""feeling"" of grief, but that it is foolish for the discursive mind to encourage, amplify, or justify it.   See also Seneca's letter 63. Other consolation letters by Seneca include To Marcia and To Helvia. (Edit: see also letter 99.)  These two pages or Arnold's Roman Stoicism provide a good short overview of ""consolation"" literature.  Where Seneca is fairly practical, Cicero tends to be more abstract; from Cicero's Tusculan Disputations book 3, ch 31-2 (Zeno, Cleanthes, and Chrysippus were the first three heads of the Stoic school):   XXXI. Here some people talk of moderate grief; but if such be natural, what occasion is there for consolation? for nature herself will determine, the measure of it: but if it depends on and is caused by opinion, the whole opinion should be destroyed. I think that it has been sufficiently said, that grief arises from an opinion of some present evil, which includes this belief, that it is incumbent on us to grieve. To this definition Zeno has added, very justly, that the opinion of this present evil should be recent. Now this word recent they explain thus: those are not the only recent things which happened a little while ago; but as long as there shall be any force, or vigor, or freshness in that imagined evil, so long it is entitled to the name of recent. Take the case of Artemisia, the wife of Mausolus, King of Caria, who made that noble sepulchre at Halicarnassus; while she lived, she lived in grief, and died of it, being worn out by it, for that opinion was always recent with her: but you cannot call that recent which has already begun to decay through time. Now the duty of a comforter is, to remove grief entirely, to quiet it, or draw it off as much as you can, or else to keep it under, and prevent its spreading any further, and to divert one’s attention to other matters. There are some who think, with Cleanthes, that the only duty of a comforter is to prove that what one is lamenting is by no means an evil. Others, as the Peripatetics, prefer urging that the evil is not great. Others, with Epicurus, seek to divert your attention from the evil to good: some think it sufficient to show that nothing has happened but what you had reason to expect; and this is the practice of the Cyrenaics. But Chrysippus thinks that the main thing in comforting is, to remove the opinion from the person who is grieving, that to grieve is his bounden duty. There are others who bring together all these various kinds of consolations, for people are differently affected; as I have done myself in my book on Consolation; for as my own mind was much disordered, I have attempted in that book to discover every method of cure. But the proper season is as much to be attended to in the cure of the mind as of the body...  XXXII. But the principal medicine to be applied in consolation is, to maintain either that it is no evil at all, or a very inconsiderable one: the next best to that is, to speak of the common condition of life, having a view, if possible, to the state of the person whom you comfort particularly. The third is, that it is folly to wear one’s self out with grief which can avail nothing. For the comfort of Cleanthes is suitable only for a wise man, who is in no need of any comfort at all; for could you persuade one in grief that nothing is an evil but what is base, you would not only cure him of grief, but folly. But the time for such precepts is not well chosen. Besides, Cleanthes does not seem to me sufficiently aware that affliction may very often proceed from that very thing which he himself allows to be the greatest misfortune.   I rather agree with Cicero's critique of Cleanthes, that ""the comfort of Cleanthes is suitable only for a wise man, who is in no need of any comfort at all""."

This lecture appears to support something I think is generally a misconception, that Stoicism advises that one be completely passive.  Looking outside this lecture, at Stoicism generally, the Stoics certainly seemed comfortable with punishment of crimes, defence of ones society, etc. Is this consistent with the M.R. lecture? Perhaps not; the Stoics were not a completely uniform bunch. One can also interpret it in another way, that the lecture is only an admonition against retribution or retaliation. Action motivated by  (moral) benefit to the assailant, or protection of society at large (both things many other Stoics, certainly, seem to have fully supported), might not have been the intended subject of the criticism. (Edit 2: admittedly, this interpretation doesn't really seem consistent with the blanket statement in the first sentence.)  (See  Plato's Gorgias, much of the contents of which seem to have been a point of agreement between the Stoics and the Plato. Epictetus (M.R.'s student) in particular seems to have been particularly strongly influenced by Gorgias (see this paper). Edit: The idea that the perpetrator of an offense is the one harmed rather than the ""victim"" seems to come right out of Gorgias. )  I have seen it contended, I'm not sure where, that this lecture was a criticism of a Cynic philosopher who made a show of flaunting convention and generally being offensive, and then filed a lawsuit against someone who responded by punching him. (The Cynics were known to have done things like make a show of defecating in public, no more socially acceptable then than now, and similar.) This puts the whole thing in yet another light."

Stoicism,39rcwu,jimstride,3,Sun Jun 14 11:58:40 2015 UTC,"""Excuse me"" which is an abbreviation of ""Would you be so kind as to excuse me please"" is a problematic choice of language since it is so often used aggressively these days. But apart from that initial remark your response was excellent. Your insight into the likelihood that the man you encountered, his behaviour, was due to his previous experience is commendable. Epictetus mentions the story of the youth who threw a stone at Lycurgus blinding him in one eye and how, when the mob brought the youth before Lycurgus for the latter to deal with him as he saw fit, they were astonished that, instead of exacting punishment, Lycurgus took the youth in and educated him and brought him up to be a model citizen."

Stoicism,39rcwu,HaemonZERO,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:03:04 2015 UTC,"i'm curious as to what his reaction was, and if you have encountered him after that. you were empathethic enough to think that the man's behaviour was caused by earlier experiences or smth like that. Did he turn around and apologize? Anger is a normal and healthy emotion, and it's never wrong to use it in a healthy way. This sort of composed behaviours can avoid a lot of conflict (i'm the master of this) but can be the pitfall for when you really have to stand up for yourself. Don't excuse yourself for being punched in the face. Otherwise i think it's admirable that you undergo this process to become a better man."
Stoicism,39rcwu,BrogueTrader40k,4,Sun Jun 14 09:39:26 2015 UTC,"He didn't apologize; he kept cursing. But I figured he was still in the wrong state of mind to have a conversation, which was why I kept walking.   I haven't seen him since, but I made a point to take the same route to and from work. Not to provoke anyone, merely to keep myself from allowing fear to dictate my behavior from here on out.   Great point about the need to stand up for myself. A while back, I read about the difference between antisocial and asocial violence. The former would be the type of violence I experienced - caused by lack of social skills and ignorance. The latter would be the type of violence one might encounter during a home invasion or from someone psychotic or from someone whose sole intention was to do one harm. Thankfully, asocial violence is far more rare.   As a general rule, I try not to engage with antisocial violence. Better to receive harm than to give it, as Socrates would say. But I'd fight tooth and nail were I faced with an asocially violent person."
Stoicism,39rcwu,GreenLanternWilliam,2,Sun Jun 14 11:54:48 2015 UTC,"Nice clarification on the types of violence. It makes me think of the quote ""“Never argue with stupid people, they will drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience.” By Mark Twain.   You did your part, it's up to the other individual to either behave in a 'better' way, or not. it's up to him and his behaviour is out of your control. Walking away and not stooping to his level is the best way to engage these kind of situations in my opinion.   I think it's a nice example for your students and maybe even the guy you walked into."

Either I let my mind wonder to places, or my thoughts seemed awkward to share with her.

Maybe I can be myself and find other people to hang out with but I've got so much anxiety about being judged that I feel as if I have to get away from everyone. It's kind of a pickle."
Stoicism,39qrcl,Zronno,2,Sun Jun 14 15:17:55 2015 UTC,"I find the best way to help me overcome social anxiety is to break down the situation in my head to the point where anxiety makes no logical sense anymore. It doesn't kill the anxiety completely, but it helps pushing to the stage of ""just doing it"" in-spite of the anxiety.  I find the biggest cause of social anxiety with me is how other people will react, what would they think?   For this, other than the obvious stoic practice of not worrying about what you can not control, I find that reminding yourself that they are people too, just like you are, helps as well. Would you judge yourself in that situation? If you won't, why would they?"
Stoicism,39qrcl,iSmokeGauloises,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:28:53 2015 UTC,"Why would they judge? Because they subscribe to a societal notion of ""properness"". You're supposed to act a certain way and behaviour that escapes this norm is mocked if not at least looked down upon. You become identified as a lesser intelligence.   So if you do something that might be seen as weird or jovial, someone might not think that they are able to relate to you or maybe they will think you're child-like, think they're better than you. Now you're in a box where you either hang out with someone who either talks down to you or don't feel connected to you at all. Maybe be yourself while proving them wrong in anything that matters? But geez, I don't want to live my life constantly trying to prove that I'm not a crackpot just because I'm defferent. I don't know man"

It's all a front of traditionalistic  pomp and ceremony and splendour and honour - worthless values - a kind-of appropriation of the hideous human past, that in truth anyway bears no relation to its actual ancient origins other than in name."
Stoicism,39ishj,MinotaurWarrior,5,Fri Jun 12 00:32:43 2015 UTC,"I think the things you list, like ""philosophical stuff"" and, at work while you are getting paid, particularly ""educational material"" are pretty good approaches. Improving skills at least somewhat related to your job can serve well both to do good generally (assuming you think your job is worthwhile) and be an honourable and professional thing to do while at work. Such study might be to improve your skill at the tasks for which you are being paid,  or your study might just expand your skills to enable yourself to take on tasks and duties ""adjacent"" to those you already have. Even if you don't ever plan to perform them, understanding what everyone else at your workplace does can sometimes be very helpful.  Of course, how to do this is much more obvious for some kinds of jobs than others. Technical and artistic skills are pretty much inexhaustible when it comes to how much study and practice can yield improved skills, and for many there are (or can be straightforwardly created) exercises that can be picked up and put down as needed. There are always new technologies to learn, occasionally exercised skills to practice to perfection, relevant facts to memorize, etc. Figuring out what skills to improve and how is harder in some jobs and kinds of workplaces than others, but if you have time and computer (or even just pen and paper and book) access I think there is always some skill you can be working on to make yourself more useful, even if it has to be less directly related to your current duties."

The first rule of stoicism is to sort out whether something is in your control or not. If this president is the classic college manager, they will never respond to a noise complaint because then they would have too much ""babysitting"" (the bane of all education professionals!). If this guy is a classic college racist, then he will passive-aggressively try to bait you into as many situations as possible and then try to appear to be the nicest guy ever to everyone else. It sucks that you ran into someone like that, but the universe is deterministic and it was always going to happen. Not only that, but the universe will determine your reputation for you, too- your pride and unwillingness to accept defeat have nothing to do with how people think of you.   No, wait, John, actually, they had a great deal of what people think of you! Your capacity for blaming people is now your defining character trait to your house president! Your pride also made you angry, and that anger convinced you to smash someone's door with a piece of hardware. My goodness, your capacity for blame is even turning itself around and blaming you right now! Tricky little demon, isn't it? No, it's not your fault, either. You said you were a quite regular person; make this one of your habits. Say to yourself, ""any person who wrongs me does so from the point of view that they are right. If I disagree with them, I am saying that I disagree with the parents who raised them, and the culture who raised them, back into history for millennia. It is much more reasonable to accept what is happening and try to make some happiness out of it.""  So, in your present case, every time he does something that annoys you, meekly bear it out, and then journal it. Write down what happened, how you reacted to it, and, looking back on it, how you could have reacted better. It is not in your control what happens to you, but it is in your control what actions you take. By helping yourself in this way, you can also build up a log of incidents for your house president without blaming, just documenting.   Obviously this guy got the reaction he was looking for from you at first- he knows combat from martial arts, probably. Well, now you know combat, too, as well as the emporers of Rome: only enter a fight where it is in your power to be the victor. You cannot be victorious against an apathetic house leader and a hateful child with the weapons you have now. And every time blame and anger take over your mind, you loose the only weapon you have in the world: your ability to make choices.  I apologize for my long reply, but you had a long question. Also, the seven habits are Mormon philosophy, not Stoic, which is why I chose to call you John."
Stoicism,39iths,GreenLanternWilliam,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:45:06 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the suggestions, GreenLantern.  I did start documenting what he was doing, but it was only at the very end. And when I bought it into the meeting discussion, he claimed I was making it up. Luckily I was documenting it on googlesheets, so it was timestamped. Even then he claimed I was making it up. Essentially he has been trying to turn everything against me.  You are very right, its funny how it has been going. He doesnt let me sleep, so I am restless throughout the day. This makes me more emotional. Then the next time he wakes me up, I get more angry. This downward spiral has been going on, over and over till it got out of control. On top of that is work-related stress.   Just calling him an asshole or whatever and blaming him, is only making me more angry, and is kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy.   Its interesting. I didnt know about the exercises that is recommended in stoicism, like doing uncomfortable things every day, cold showers, journaling, limited stimulation, meditation etc, but I was already doing that before I knew about stoicism.   I know Stephen Covey is sometimes said to have copied everything from Mormon Philosophy. This maybe a bit of a tangent. Since you know about both Stoicism and 7 habits, would you mind sharing why you follow stoicism and not 7 habits or buddhism? With the little bit I know of each, it seems most of the things that are stated in all these ""philosophies"" is similar."
Stoicism,39iths,GreenLanternWilliam,2,Fri Jun 12 05:32:47 2015 UTC,"When I was a Nichiren Buddhist, I was constantly trying to get into other people's heads and raise their consciousness for them. I was like a colonizing English power trying to get into the pagan land of my fellow human's minds, and tell them that things were wrong there. Then, when they didn't listen, I was taught to just ""accept"" things and it would all turn out all right. Accepting things into your heart and loving them no matter what did not help my emotional state, not saying it won't help others.  Then, I got a chronic pain condition. Funny thing, no matter how much you chant and love your pain, it doesn't help your life. No matter how much you hold on to those dreams and relationships that meant so much to you, they won't stay in your grasp. Those things do not define you. Only your ability to make your own measured choices defines you.  Stoicism encourages you to stay with what is best to you, and that will make you invincible with no enemies. I won't give up my will-generated superpower. That's the only part of me that's really me.  Giving up the part of myself that blames/gets angry seemed like a big loss at first, like I was losing a twin that lived with me whole life and everyone expected me to be around. Giving up the part of me that cares about my reputation meant losing some family.  In the terms of Buddhism, your stoic inner Buddha is an avatar of brahma that has the unique power to rise above the turn of fortune and decide their own karma moment to moment; this karma is the real you, not the Buddha nature.  In terms of 7 habits, I don't care to be effective. That doesn't help anyone. Being a virtuous citizen does. If I were to become successful, I would probably choose my bottom line over my wife, and then what would the point of being successful be?"
Stoicism,39iths,GreenLanternWilliam,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:18:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you for sharing your story. I devoted this year to implementing 7 habits into my life. And have been studying it regularly every week. Particularly after this incident happened, I have essentially been playing the 7 habits over and over again, to remind me to not do something stupid, and focus on whats important.   I have to disagree with the statement that 7 habits is about being successful and about the bottom line. Stephen covey uses the word effective, which is distinct from the work success. A lot of the book is devoted to generate general principles to lead your life. He gives multiple examples, and most of the examples are actually not related to business. He asks you to create your own principles and paradigms and centers of influence. Its upto the individual to choose whatever his life centers around, it could be business, work, creating something, family.   As I read more about Stoicism, there are a lot of good things in stoicism too, over and above that of what is in 7 habits. Particularly the exercises in stocisim are very interesting.   I have to say I have only implemented maybe 10% of 7 habits into my life, but my life has changed drastically. (Except for this incident, I guess).  As far as Buddhism, I practice Vipassana on a daily basis. (Except for the week that this happened)."
Stoicism,39iths,duffstoic,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:16:49 2015 UTC,"Impermanence: as long as you exist, you will have a capacity to make moral choices. Therefore there is one impermanent thing inside you. When death has come, we are not- therefore, the observable universe always contains logos. Suffering/Non-self: None can harm you, except if you let that harm happen. Pain and abandonment are just part of the universe that try to get into your brain. The actual, real, invincible part of you does not feel pain, only your mortal body. You have the ability to rise above pain by acknowledging that it is happening to your brain/body/universe, not to you. But you need that 'you' that is the second part.  Alright, after looking into 7 habits a little more, it does seem to have some stoic influence. I'll get back to you on it, I guess.  Edit: From what I can find, The 8th Habit seems to be fairly in line with Stoic thought, but within the 7 habits are some miscalculations.   Independence is good. Thinking about the end of a situation is good. But it only gets you halfway there to ""be proactive"" and ""begin with the end in mind."" You can do that over and over again, but if you don't consider the whole situation- both what comes after it AND what comes before- then you will just hop around from life's dream to life's dream without being a real, whole person. That goes beyond putting first things first. There's a law 0 of life here- knowing what belongs to you and what is other people's property. Only if you concentrate on that will you acheive true independence.  Part 4: Influence others to appreciate your situation by offering up a win-win! Yeah, jerks really respond well to that. Oh, wait, no they don't. They're jerks.  Part 5: Try to listen to someone's problem, yes, but don't get bogged down in their petty emotions. And don't expect someone to listen to you just because you're a good listener- you have no control over what people think of you.  Part 6: As before, don't expect people to do what's for the best just because you rationally explain to them that it's for the best. Getting people to work together is like trying to get magnets to line up the wrong way around sometiems. If part of your life strategy depends on your control over other people, prepare to be disappointed.  Part 7 seems to be about being a good person and having daily habits. Staying dedicated to dailiness is important."

The reason I havent done it is because, I kind of feel like its accepting defeat. If I accept defeat from a bully, I will probably crumble, if something like this happens again in future. Dont you think?  Stephen Covey (7 habits) and stoicism talks a lot about not being angry, not hating people, learning to forgive, focusing on your life's purpose. This is what I have been doing for the last year, and why I was able to be so non-reactive.   Is moving away accepting defeat? When is it ok to accept defeat?  I am definitely not going to take revenge. If I do complain to the conflict resolution agency, it will probably to clear my name, not to harm him.   You are very right, going through this incident has been a source of tremendous growth, has taught me that not all people are created equal.

By trying to endure it, you're being prideful and think that you can handle it, but that is not what you should do as a Stoic. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but Stoicism is not about pride, ego, or anything like that; it is about finding inner peace and focusing on your own happiness. Emotions such as pride has no place in Stoic philosophy.  EDIT: I'd like to add that if this guy claims to know kung fu and acts like this, he is a disgrace to the martial arts. Kung fu is about respect and discipline, not about using your size or abilities to intimidate others."

I am in a contract, so I will have to see whether I can move out of the house. I will only be here a few more months...so.   I also contacted the conflict resolution, but decided not to press charges, because then the battle just keeps dragging on. Just trying to clear my name and move on with whats most important."
Stoicism,39iths,jimstride,2,Sat Jun 13 00:21:30 2015 UTC,"My first thought here was pretty simple – move. This is definitely something that is hindering you from doing more valuable and productive things. I think of my brain as a collection of currency: I can spend that currency in whatever way I wish, whether that's focusing on work, playing games, etc., but I only have a certain amount of currency to spend every day. This situation spends a lot of that currency up front, daily. Get that currency back, even if it's inconvenient for a week or two.  That being said, I think the Stoics do have things to say about this kind of situation. Here's an oft-quoted passage from Meditations:   “Begin each day by telling yourself: Today I shall be meeting with interference, ingratitude, insolence, disloyalty, ill-will, and selfishness – all of them due to the offenders’ ignorance of what is good or evil. But for my part I have long perceived the nature of good and its nobility, the nature of evil and its meanness, and also the nature of the culprit himself, who is my brother (not in the physical sense, but as a fellow creature similarly endowed with reason and a share of the divine); therefore none of those things can injure me, for nobody can implicate me in what is degrading. Neither can I be angry with my brother or fall foul of him; for he and I were born to work together, like a man’s two hands, feet or eyelids, or the upper and lower rows of his teeth. To obstruct each other is against Nature’s law – and what is irritation or aversion but a form of obstruction.”"
Stoicism,39iths,MinotaurWarrior,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:26:54 2015 UTC,"Actually my view of time is exactly the same. That has been my driving philosophy. I consider time to be more valuable than money, because lost money can be recovered, lost time cant be recovered.   It interesting, how inspite of deeply knowing these, i forget these principles and get involved in the blaming game. Thank you for sharing your perspective. Its very helpful in seeing it through somebody else's eyes."
Stoicism,39iths,duffstoic,2,Fri Jun 12 05:41:33 2015 UTC,"Again, it is highly unlikely that your housemate is a moral person of high principles. It is very likely that he is full of passion, that is, he is a completely fucked-up person, ruled first by one demon, say, lust, then by another, say, fear, then by another, say, anger, and so on... in other words he is an extremely unhappy person. You should therefore pity him his wretchedness. The thing one has to be aware of, since passion can spread and infect others with whom it comes into contact, is to ensure you remain tranquil at all times. Don't let a thoroughly obnoxious bastard fuck things up for you. These passionate fucked-up people are everywhere unfortunately. You have to understand and pity them in their fucked-up-ed-ness. Do not take issue with them because they are strong in their passionate madnesses and you are merely a prokopton who has not yet absorbed the Stoic teaching in great depth (ie., so that it has become second nature.) Persevere with your Stoicism and understand that most people have never even heard of the word 'virtue' let alone acted virtuously."
Stoicism,39iths,Kajenx,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:02:31 2015 UTC,"Stoicism is a about being a virtuous person.  Think about some of actions you have taken, especially the hammer incident.  No matter the circumstances, your housemate must have felt physically threatened.  Think about the relationship you are building with this person.  Don't allow it to continue escalating.  Consider apologising for any action that you have taken which does not meet your expectations for being a good, virtuous person.  Do not expect any apology from the housemate.  Do not ask your housemate to discontinue his nightly noise habits.  Focus this conversation solely on your indiscretions.  He may have contributed, but that isn't in your control.    Work on moving out, you have made an appropriate effort to quell the noise.  It might be the best thing for your relationship with your housemate.  You say you don't want to give in, but give in to what?  You have given into your passions already.  Give in to the bullying?  Keep your interests in what you do and not what your housemate does.  Don't give into your passions, that is in your interest.  Ask yourself if you are feeling spiteful.  I'm particularly susceptible to spite myself and sometimes my actions unintentionally and unconsciously reflect that.  It can be a struggle to drop things, but use what strength you have towards dropping any issue you have with him and not trying to get your uncooperative housemate to cooperate."
Stoicism,39iths,jimstride,2,Fri Jun 12 05:44:48 2015 UTC,"I endorse all that kevinlyfellow advises. But before following his advice I would suggest that you consider seeing a doctor and getting a health check up including blood tests to ensure that everything's okay with you bodily. Have a chat with your doctor and tell them that you're stressed out, not sleeping well, and so on - no need to go into great detail. For you never know, there might be some physical problem that is causing you to react to externals somewhat violently. If everything turns out to be okay on that score then either move house or else make peace with your housemate as kevinlyfellow advises."
Stoicism,39iths,stellarMan24,2,Fri Jun 12 19:18:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your response. You are right, its my action and fault.  I guess the reason I was feeling justified is because of his actions. If somebody attacks you, you have the right to attack legally to defend yourself.   This guy has essentially been harassing and attacking me for a long time, maybe not physically but mentally and emotionally. I had tried all other means, and I had to attack and create a scene so people take notice.   But you are right, that I gave into anger. I should have had more control. I will apologize to this guy and to the other people. I should have chosen better methods to attack (possibly gather evidence etc.) where I was not so emotional."
Stoicism,39iths,HarshaKarpos,2,Sat Jun 13 00:41:07 2015 UTC,"If somebody attacks you, you have the right to attack legally to defend yourself.    That is not at all what Stoicism is about. Stoic's don't have 'rights' and they don't need rights: Stoicism is superior to rights. Rights don't solve anything, Stoicism does. The Stoic says, Take my body, take my possessions, take my human rights, break my legs, kill me, but you will never get ME. And please do not associate Stoic ethics with the warmongering ethos of modern nation-states like the USA, Britain, Europe and Australia. The Stoic is at home everywhere: there are no countries only one world.  You talk elsewhere about moving away being a sign of weakness. I put it to you that staying is a sign of stubbornness.   You see things in traditional terms of winners and losers but the Stoic does not see things that way. He sees beyond winning and losing for he sees how the Stoic is always a winner because he never takes sides. So let this housemate have his own way where your body and its possessions are concerned. You just look after your self. Improve your self. Concentrate on that."

Stoicism,39h6qu,tabmonkey,0,Thu Jun 11 18:37:40 2015 UTC,But that's just it: the people who think too positively will end up doing nothing.  You need a little anxiety a la negative visualization to get the fucking positive action in motion.
Stoicism,39h6qu,Blackout0189,3,Thu Jun 11 18:39:31 2015 UTC,"You could also argue that the people that think too negatively will fall into the same trap (I did, anecdotal, sure, but I've known a number of others too). That and they'll also bring everyone around them down while they're doing it. Maybe positivity and negativity aren't the problem, maybe complacency is, which can affect both."
Stoicism,39h6qu,MrSkygack,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:45:09 2015 UTC,"I agree. But I think too much positivity is way more dangerous.  In this study (behind paywall), which is cited in the article, they found that even having positive fantasies about basic needs sapped energy and desire to go out and get that basic need met.  Happiness isn't the default human emotional state, fulfilling a need or desire is. A lot of us are in a place where we don't need to worry about fulfilling a need (food, shelter, clothing, etc.) so we turn to filling desires (getting desirable job, an attractive mate, pursing hobbies, etc.), and having positive fantasies about these things will lower your energy to actually go out and do that. It's like your brain thinks you already have the things you are fantasizing about, therefore, it doesn't produce any anxiety which will prompt you to go out and get it.  Another way to look at it is this: When you're hungry you are motivated to go get food. However, when you are full you don't go out and search for food."

I can't remember which Stoic said it, but when we review our actions, the purpose isn't to beat ourselves up but learn how we might improve upon ourselves. I think your reflection on the incident is very Stoic, and I thank you for sharing it. I wish there was more of this kind of stuff here, as real life is the best way to learn."

You can't be too tough on yourself, especially because you can't change the past anyway. It's very difficult to remain calm in a situation like that, and I know that even the best of Stoic sages, would absolutely struggle to keep their cool, when they are essentially being threatened by a ten ton huge metal truck, driven by someone who is angry. And the guy was right behind you, while you were sitting on a flimsy bike? Scary stuff. Anyone would have difficulty there.  If this experience has taught you that you could do more, then I suppose that is good. But don't beat yourself up about it. Far from it being an example of your lack of Stoic practice, it's a great opportunity! The world threw you a curveball; an almost unsolveable problem. You were challenged two times. You failed the first one, but you passed the second (Where you ignored him). That means that you partially succeeded! You accomplished WAY more than you would have, had you not even attempted to stay calm. I would have gotten pissed too. And like you, it would probably have stuck around in my mind for a while. It's not a sign that you're not doing well, it's just a sign that you have more work to do. And that in itself isn't bad news."

If he would have shown more empathy and that he actually cares, but the animal still had to be killed it wouldn't be as controversial as it was.   As it has been mentioned many times before, Stoicism is not about absence of emotion or being a cold rational machine, but about managing your emotions and not letting them get out of your control.  You can speak passionately and rationally at the same time, but that of course takes time to master."

Interesting point.   I think he may have misjudged his audience. Either that, or non-danes weren't the target. The kind of answers he gives would carry a lot of weight in Danish TV, where emotional displays of that nature would sound absurd, culturally speaking, coming from a man in his position. He also looks like a man who didn't quite know what he was getting into.   Among Danes his message carried a lot of weight, because he managed to explain the reasoning in a very structured manner (And, indeed, because he kept it cool). In fact, most of Denmark rallied behind him after that interview, and the interview is still top 10 of all time in /r/Denmark"

It sure seems like that to me sometimes."
Stoicism,395bvg,MindfulMonk,5,Tue Jun 9 14:33:11 2015 UTC,Maybe it's not that people are becoming more and more emotional but that you are either becoming yourself more rational or that you are now realizing how much people are not rational?

That occured to me; it could just be a relative subjective change and not an absolute one. I can't find any studies about it, and the only signs I have to go by are speculative and anecdotal. For instance, when I watch older movies, people seem to be far less emotional in them.  There could be many reasons for that. I could be wrong in my subjective judgement. It could also be that directors and writers have become better at writing emotionally engaging television and books. But during the same timeframe, we have seen psychologists and therapists encourage emotional connection. People are expected to be ""in tune"" with their emotions now, whereas in the past, it might very well have been considered inappropriate to do that in public.  Anyway, I have no idea. It may be why Stoicism has been revived. People are slowly realizing that in getting in tune with their emotions, they have begun to be increasingly ruled by them. What do you think?"

To me, I saw irritation at two points: (1) when the interviewer was claiming the audience was being distressed by what they saw, and he had to correct the interviewer and (2) when the interviewer twisted the zookeeper's words, claiming he'd said things like ""dismemberment.""  The common ground I see there is that the interviewer was (1) making untrue statements, not merely improper judgements and (2) projecting his irrationality onto others.  I personally know that these are also elements that make it harder for me to maintain my composure. For instance, when someone claims that I promised something I did not promise, or claims to know how something ""really went down"" between people in a situation they weren't there to witness.  I think the stoic way to approach this is to have empathy for the other party, as they are painfully deprived of the truth in a manner contrary to their nature, and also to keep in mind that they can harm no-one but themselves with their ignorance."

Stoicism,394dq7,duffstoic,1 point,Fri Jun 12 10:05:23 2015 UTC,Correcting societal ills is definitely Stoic. But I'm not sure a bio-psycho-social explanation of suffering is Stoic.

The discipline these men exhibited is amazing, and Stockdale's commitment to his initial vow to himself is nothing short of superhuman. To think of the isolation and torture he went through along side all of his men is painful. But to think that he was able to maintain a chain of command and a web of support for SEVEN years that never really faltered is just phenomenal.    His dedication to his men and to Stoicism is one of the best examples anyone could ever hope for in regards to the viability of Stoicism in daily practice. To think that this man allowed this philosophy to essentially guide him and his men through the toughest part of their life is incredibly motivating, if not outright mind blowing.    Do you know if any of his other writings touch on Stoicism or his experiences in captivity?"

Give it a rest man. Admit that you don't know what you're talking about in terms of meditation, as you're clearly casting your own preconceived notions of what meditation is. If you actually believe that meditators are ""dreamers"" and cannot be men and women of action, then you are too uneducated on the subject to have such strong opinions.  One of the things that Stoics like yourself should be able to do quite well is face reality. In this case, the reality is that Reddit is a wonderful place for cross-pollination of ideas/beliefs/practices/philosophies. Subreddits do not exist in a vacuum, and nor should they. One of the things that make them great is the diversity of people that can interact on so many different subjects. Say, like meditation, stoicism, and even financial independence. When people in a particular community don't like the direction, they downvote or moderate the divergent discussion into oblivion. Or they just ignore the threads that they dislike. And if things get too crazy, they unsubscribe or start their own sub. How about /r/truestoicism?  Or: you can meditate on the immense variety of options available to you in this life instead of posting preposterously inane topics about how uncomfortable you are in a sub that relishes the opportunity of experiencing voluntary discomfort."

Stoicism,394f5m,ashaman7,5,Tue Jun 9 04:36:23 2015 UTC,"Courage is, in some ways, the simplest of the virtues. All you have to do is continue to live a good life, however you succeeded on your exams. Make one good choice after another.  That said, there's some psychology that the stoics would use to explain your current state of mind. Briefly, the stoics distinguish between fleeting thoughts, more consistent opinions, and actual truths. The fleeting thoughts are those crazy ideas that jump into your head from time to time--crazy impulses like, ""That cat reminds me of my teacher. I wonder if I failed my exam?"" Since stoics recognize that there's no way to prevent such fleeting thoughts they don't take these thoughts seriously. Here's how. When you have one of those fleeting thoughts, you can make a decision whether or not this fits into a picture, a story, or an overall idea about how the world is. For the case of the cat that reminds you of your teacher, the overall idea is your belief about your success or failure. But the quality of that picture, story, or overall idea depends on the quality of your facts and judgments. And while your facts get confused based on your imperfect senses, your judgments get confused based on your imperfect beliefs. The facts can get confused based on the crazy ideas that you have--for example, even if a cat looks like your teacher, you can't seriously believe that the cat has any meaningful connection with your teacher. Instead, stoics have a core set of beliefs that they use to sift out bad judgments. Those beliefs are, briefly,   You should live well as a human (corollary: don't think you are a god) Living well as a human entails being reasonable (corollary: don't be unreasonable) Being reasonable entails making good moral choices, aka virtuous actions (corollary: don't worry about things you can't control) Good moral choices may entail preferred outcomes, but those are not important (corollary: sometimes good choices will make dis-preferred outcomes, but that's acceptable)   And based on stoic beliefs, the way to judge your finals is this: What is virtuous? Whether your teacher says you did well or poorly on your finals, will that make you more wise, just, courageous, or moderate? Whether your teacher says that you did well or poorly, will you be better positioned to make good choices in the future? Whether your teacher says you did well or poorly, is there any reason to worry about something you can't control?"
Stoicism,394f5m,0149,2,Tue Jun 9 13:50:25 2015 UTC,Accept that you can fail. Accept the worst possible outcome. Then give it the best you have.
Stoicism,394f5m,alreadyredschool,2,Wed Jun 10 14:30:27 2015 UTC,"Remember Epictetus' saying: there are things that are up to us (in our control) and things that are not up to us (not in our control).  Get out a sheet of paper. Make a table with 2 columns. At the top of the left column write ""Not in my control,"" and at the top of the right column write ""In my control.""  In the left column, put things that worry you that are not in your control, such as what your teacher thinks about you, or how hard the teacher decides to grade the exams, and so on.  In the right column write what is in your control: studying the material, asking the teacher what will be on the exam, and so on.  Now remember that you are not a god -- you cannot control everything in the Universe. If you created the Universe, perhaps then everything would go your way and your every desire would be fulfilled. But since you are not the creator of the Universe but a creation of it, you are likely to encounter things that don't please you from time to time. So best to keep your focus on what is in your control, what is up to you, and let everything else be as it is. In fact, aggressively pursue all the things which are in your control. Then you can truly say you did what you could.  Spend some time contemplating other things that you can easily accept like this. Perhaps you can easily accept when it rains outside, because that means you can spend more time indoors doing indoor activities you love. You don't try to control the weather with your mind, do you? You don't cry and call your mom whenever it rains, do you? :) So take that ability you already have to let things go which are not in your control, which you do easily with the weather, and bring that feeling, that way of being into the arena of finals and tests. [If the weather example doesn't work for you, think of something else.]"

Stoicism,38zk30,cleomedes,3,Mon Jun 8 04:00:02 2015 UTC,"Connotations of the word ""Meditation"" have drifted a lot over the centuries - most notably after the introduction of Eastern philosophy and ""New Age"" thinking to the West.   While I would agree that far fewer modern people are familiar with historically ""western"" meditation, I disagree that it has ceased to mean what it always has.  Modern Christians (at least in some traditions) still do meditate following more historical definitions, and still call it that. See, for example, the Catechism of the Catholic Church, or these instructions. The word simply has a very broad range of meanings.  I sometime wonder how the word ""meditation"" came to refer to Buddhist practices like mindfulness, which seem closer to me *but still quite different) to the Christian spiritual practice of ""contemplation"".  Some additional quotes I have on hand providing older historical definitions of meditation:  From Ball's A Treatise on Meditation   Quest. How is meditation to be defined, as it is taken in the former sense?  Answ. Meditation is a serious, earnest and purposed musing upon some point of Christian instruction, tending to lead us foward toward the Kingdom of Heaven, and serving for our daily strengthening against the flesh, the world and the Devil. Or it is the steadfast and earnest bending of the mind upon some spiritual and heavenly matter, discoursing thereof with our selves, till we bring the same to some profitable issue, both for the settling of our judgments, and the bettering of our hearts and lives.   Another definition from the same tradition, this one from Ranew's Solitude Improved by Divine Meditation:   MEditation according to the usual Notion and Acceptation, is taken for any serious or earnest thinking of any matter whatsoever, for what end soever, whether it be good or evil. So Meditating is used in the Scripture, not only in a good sense, but in an evil sense. So Psal.  But ordinarily it is taken in a good sense, for a holy Mind Exercise, or acting the thoughts in any seriousness upon any matter in a spiritual manner. There is a double kind of Meditation.   There is the literary form called a meditation (see here). I'm guessing that this was the sense of the word being thought of when the title was first applied to Marcus Aurelius's journals.  I quite agree that there is no historical evidence to suggest that the Stoics ever practiced anything like ""mindfulness meditation"" or similar Eastern-inspired modern practices, and if it were a prominent element of the philosophy, I would expert that there survive at least some indication of it . This is a completely separate issue from either whether the Stoics were influenced by Indian thought at all (the arguments for which I have never found persuasive, but absence of evidence is not proof of absence), or whether modern people influenced by Stoicism might find these practices complementary."
Stoicism,38zk30,bloodstainedsmile,6,Mon Jun 8 23:18:49 2015 UTC,"I think it's perhaps you who has a misconception of what meditation itself really is.  The thing is while meditation has historically been practiced within a religious context, it itself can (and is, by many many people worldwide) be practiced solely in a secular context. Tell me, is focusing on feeling a body part, or the moving sensation of breath a religious activity? If so, everyone on the planet would be religious.  You seem to imply that if you meditate you do not also -live life-. This implies that you think that meditation is an activity that is only done sitting down alone.  Meditation is something that can be done anywhere, anytime. All it is the practice of regulation and focusing of one's attention. Your misconception of meditation is that it actually requires a posture. It does not. It can be done while walking, while eating - monks have phenomenal abilities of concentration merely because they are trained to do it with every single thing that they do. They remain in a meditative state while sweeping the floor, while eating, while doing virtually anything, and so become very firmly grounded in the present moment.  Meditation itself is merely a focused regulation of one's attention on a particular thing, with increasing relaxation. This focusing helps one to remain in the present, because the object is in the present. This trains the mind to not wander  I'm not arguing that meditation per se is a defacto practice of the old Stoics, what I am arguing is that it is a very beneficial practice that anyone who is trying to become Stoic would benefit from, namely by increasing one's attention span, and helping them center themselves in the present moment, which one might argue, is a very Stoic practice.  Also, you made a throw away account just to post this particular wall of text?"
Stoicism,38zk30,duffstoic,2,Mon Jun 8 07:24:51 2015 UTC,"I would argue that the secular meditation you are describing is distinctly Buddhist in its origins, as opposed to secular Vedic practices, secular mantra recitation, and so on.  What most people who call themselves Stoics today are practicing is secular Stoicism, because ancient Stoics were quite theistic.  But then most people are syncretic in their actual practices and beliefs, and not particularly ideologically clear, which has some advantages and some drawbacks."
Stoicism,38zk30,bloodstainedsmile,4,Mon Jun 8 20:14:44 2015 UTC,"The historical origin is Indian yes, however, it is my contention that the ancient place of origin or associated religious context is of no meaning.   What I describe here is what is classically known as Vipassana, but I honestly could not care less what name one could call the technique by.  What I try to explain is that this meditation is not strictly a religious practice as much as it is a universal mental methodology developed for the refinement of mental focus and emotional clarity, which people then afterwards decided to build religious frameworks and trappings around. The technique stands perfectly on its own without needing any sort of ideology whatsoever.  Doing this practice increases two fundamental skills: objective observation of thoughts and feeling , and the ability to hone one's focus down to a pinpoint and keep it there for extended periods of time.  All it really is is focusing on a stimulus (most traditionally the breath), while taking objective note of arising thoughts and feelings, and returning to the focal point when concentration has been shattered.  The stereotypical association with such as it merely being a reclusive religious exercise is a false perception - once one gains the focus and mental/emotional objectivity, these can be applied most easily to anything, and in the Stoic context that I use it in, in the activities of doubting initial impressions that arise during day-to-day activity, and focusing on a task to its sole exclusion as long as needed.  As many people today are finding out, they can develop clarity of mind and stability of emotions without any of the religious baggage one stereotypically finds associated with meditation.   It can be practiced by anyone of any creed or cloth because it's not a religious ritual at its core, as much as it is a technology for the development of emotional and mental fitness. It is literally training the brain's capacity to regulate itself i.e doing mental pushups. It's brain exercise - something that any human being is capable of doing."
Stoicism,38zk30,duffstoic,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:15:20 2015 UTC,"I've done lots of Vipassana, in S.N. Goenka's style mostly. I've found it very useful. I think Goenka did a funny bait and switch in making a secular Buddhist meditation tradition that was useful in some ways but also kinda tricked people into becoming Buddhists. That was my experience at least. Buddhism is a nice thing, it has been helpful for me, but I've also come to question a lot about it and have found that Stoicism is more of a philosophical home for me.  Unlike u/dontmeditate though I don't necessarily think that ideological purity is important, and I think that secular Buddhist practice can actually be altered slightly to aim at Stoic ends instead of Buddhist ones. The Vipassana technique of Goenka for instance can be helpful in developing the ability of the individual to remain resourceful in difficult situations (it certainly did so for me), and thus help actualize a Stoic ideal of transforming the passions."
Stoicism,38zk30,duffstoic,3,Mon Jun 8 21:44:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you for providing a good example of exactly the perspective I'm talking about.

Certainly one can practice Stoicism by sweeping floors or eating, but for most people reading this comment (literate with access to the internet, likely in developed countries) it is within our control to do much greater good.  Marcus ruled an Empire justly, for example.  I'm sure he quietly collected his thoughts and his composure throughout the day, but every account we have of him is of a man of tireless action.

Stoicism,38zk30,duffstoic,5,Mon Jun 8 14:13:50 2015 UTC,"Quite the opposite, the Stoics don't seem to have much regard for their bodies. To the Stoics, the body is only the temporary vehicle for your soul and your reason. That's why Epictetus casually calls his body useless.   In my translation of The Discourses (Robin Hard), Epictetus refers to his body as his corpse. And he simultaneously mentions taking exercise and otherwise taking care of this corpse of his. He emphasizes prioritizing the cultivation of the mind over the cultivation of the body, but he doesn't seem to neglect the body in an ascetic fashion. He celebrates the Cynic path, but also says that individuals who are not healthy and robust in their physical condition should not take up that path because they will give the impression that such a lifestyle is unhealthy.  Anyway, what I'm trying to say here is that I think that if Stoics do physical exercise for their bodies, at least in some amount, then doing some exercises for their minds might also be relevant. Epictetus frequently uses athletic training metaphors, and also refers to ""hard winter training"", the kind that warriors would do. Young men would leave their families for months or years at a time to study with Epictetus. What do you think they were doing all this time?  It seems to me that while I agree that the proof is in the pudding, in one's actions, that also there is some clear room here for mental exercises or periods of training. Amongst the Greco-Roman moralists, the Stoics have the most numbers of explicit exercises, which I think is part of their appeal to contemporary individuals. The specific ""how-to"" is more interesting because it leads to embodying the principles rather than just hearing about what we ought to do without any path to get there.  That said, Buddhist meditation and its secular forms of mindfulness practice are clearly not Stoic in origin."
Stoicism,38zk30,duffstoic,4,Mon Jun 8 20:25:36 2015 UTC,Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.  There is no need to introduce a metaphor.  Athletics and physical training is a recurring theme in Stoicism.  Meditation involving body parts (as described above) is not.    Is there some room for mental exercise in Stoicism?  Of course there is.  Just not nearly as much as certain members of this sub would have you think.  Stoicism is a lived philosophy.
Stoicism,38zk30,bloodstainedsmile,2,Mon Jun 8 21:25:35 2015 UTC,"Well I guess I disagree here. I actually very recently wrote the following as a note to myself in my personal hypomnemata as part of my Stoic reflections:   Why body awareness for Stoics?   Get the experience of how you feel doesn't determine what you do. Pleasure and pain are neither good nor bad in themselves, only virtue/excellence is good. For example, for developing courage, as defined as feeling fear and choosing to do the right thing anyway. Become more aware of when you are overcome by the passions (unresourceful states) so you can work to prevent them or respond well to them. In other words, as prosoche. As preparation for relaxation techniques, and itself fairly relaxing. Relaxation is useful to practice for responding resourcefully to challenges, exercising self-control and patience, and so on. It is easier to respond to the vicissitudes of life wisely and virtuously when you are relaxed.    You may of course disagree with my assessment, but I think Buddhist secular mindfulness practices can be adapted for Stoic ends in this way.  EDIT: That said, I don't feel a need to do a lot of meditation myself anymore. 10 minutes a day is sufficient, and I usually don't even do that."

Stoicism,38zk30,duffstoic,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:48:36 2015 UTC,"""Secular"" or otherwise, the kind of meditation you're talking about has no place in the Stoic tradition. Marcus would be baffled by your meditation practices.   I stated that I wasn't arguing that meditation was a Stoic practice. Perhaps I need to state again that I believe that it is a very beneficial practice for someone looking to live a Stoic life because it substantially improves one's ability at successfully the performing the fundamental mental exercises that one engages in as part of one's daily practice of Stoicism.   Quite the opposite, the Stoics don't seem to have much regard for their bodies. To the Stoics, the body is only the temporary vehicle for your soul and your reason. That's why Epictetus casually calls his body useless. That's why Stockdale could be tortured in Vietnam for years without effect. In the words of Aurelius: ""A little flesh, a little breath, and Reason to rule all – that is myself.""   It seems that once again you are juxtaposing my words out of their original context. It's quite apparent to me that you have no experience or teaching as to what meditation really is.   The object of your focus in meditation (the focal point) is merely the object towards which we focus on. The object itself is not the main goal (as you seem to be implying), the main goal is the honing of one's ability to focus and ignore distractions, be they external (sounds or sensations) or internal (thoughts and images). The object is merely the tool in which we hone and strengthen our focus, not the end-point.  The end-goal of all of this is the improved ability to observe one's thoughts and feelings objectively, and to regulate these said thoughts and emotions. This allows you to watch yourself better for immediate mental and emotional reactions, and separate your sense of identity from these initial impressions. If you describe yourself as a Stoic, does this at all sound familiar to you?   I'm sure he quietly collected his thoughts and his composure throughout the day, but every account we have of him is of a man of tireless action. He carried out his duties as he saw them and lived his philosophy.   You seem to be concerned that meditation is somehow going to limit one's efficacy in the world, or somehow hinder them from trying to achieve things in the world. I think perhaps you yourself, due to your lack of understanding of what meditation really is, think that meditation is only practiced by people who aim at living in caves, or somehow its full goal is total and complete renunciation.   If your main concern is this, action, I can assure you this is not the truth for 99% of actual meditators out there. The goal of a meditative practice is to not to detach one's self from life, but to enhance one's ability to live via increasing the strength of one's focus and one's abilities to achieve emotional and mental clarity.  If your main concern is time, then if you cannot take 20 minutes out of your day to do practice meditating a bit, then you probably also do not have the time to be reading and studying philosophical literature.   You're describing thinking. Surely we don't need a new word for being mindful and fully present in everyday life? Perhaps we do.   I am not describing thinking, not that you would understand the difference though.   If you had ever actually engaged in the practice of meditation, you would understand that there is a difference between your conceptual mental processes, and your ability to observe and focus. I know that this sounds crazy to you, but as you demonstrate lack of understanding towards what meditation really is, it makes you less than fit to judge as to what it is or isn't.   You might be more true to the original sense of ""Meditatio"" but (right or wrong) in the year 2015 the word ""meditation"" carries too many connotations which can mislead. If you tell someone you're meditating they will expect burning incense and the trappings of Zazen etc.;    In the year 2015, the word Stoic carries the connotation of someone who is uncaring, unfeeling and emotionless. Does the popular conception of the word undermine your ability to apply the principles of Stoicism? Perhaps you need a new word to call whatever it is that we are, to put this concern of yours at ease?   this leads away from the path of ancient Stoicism.   It would seem to me that you are interested in pursuing only ancient Stoicism, as you mention it specifically.   If you have read the FAQ in the sidebar (you should have if you were a ""long-time"" lurker), perhaps you would've known that very few of us are interested in pursuing Stoicism in its most ancient form which you are singly advocating. I recommend that you read that section some more.   Many of us here are even atheists or agnostics, but still practice the exercises and perform the dichotomy of control. By strict qualifications, these people, although living very Stoic lives, wouldn't qualify as ancient Stoics due to discrepancies in worldviews. However, does this truly matter? Very few of us here are interested in pursuing the purest form of ""ancient stoicism"", as that would entail believing in the Gods, and the theory that everything is composed of the different elements.(wind, fire, water, earth), and so forth.  The Stoics that you'd find here are more interested in a living, breathing, evolving Stoicism rather than one that is trapped completely in the past."
Stoicism,38zk30,duffstoic,0,Mon Jun 8 15:39:38 2015 UTC,"If you're not arguing that meditation is a Stoic practice then we are in full agreement on that point.  I would take it a step further and say that for many aspiring Stoics meditation can actually be counter-productive as it comes at the expense of living nobly.  To borrow your example, let's assume that every subscriber to this subreddit spent 20 minutes meditating every day: even if it's 100% effective self-improvement, that's an aggregate of nearly 8,000 hours every day.  Don't you think that time could be better spent?  At some level doesn't it seem frivolous and self-serving?  The Stoic message is simple: Live in accordance with nature.  Do what you can and endure what you must.  Man up. Now I'm not arguing we should never think in a structured way.  For years I've pulled Marcus off the shelf almost daily, and life affords many opportunities for spontaneous Stoic reflection.  However, that is very different from what you and others are advocating, which much more closely resembles the Zen schools of Buddhism.  Stoicism has evolved - even by Roman times all fields but Stoic Ethics were effectively abandoned - but calling your personal ideas ""the living, breathing, evolving"" Stoicism is more than a little pompous.  You're talking about a millenia-old tradition which was fully aware of Buddhist-style meditation (via Alexander's conquests in South Asia) and rejected it.  If meditation works for you I sincerely wish you the best, but passing off your version as mainstream ""modern"" Stoicism is objectionable in the extreme.

I'm not even sure what exactly makes Seneca qualify as a Stoic -- he seems more Epicurean to me. Marcus in some passages sounds more like Jesus than Epictetus.

An academic introduction written by William Desmond and the simple title Cynics provides an overview of cynics and their philosophy (ISBN: 978-0-520-25861-7). The collection, which contains this book, also features Stoics, Presocratics, Sceptics and others.

So I appreciate what I have now, knowing it is temporary.   Epictetus was crippled and old and it didn't stop him from taking moderate exercise. That is, he didn't neglect his body. But, more importantly, nothing stopped him from exercising his moral purpose.   Then I think of Oscar Pistorius: he didn't have any legs and that didn't stop him--nor has it stopped thousands of other ""cripples"" worldwide--from taking part in competitive sports. Pistorius would never have been a match for Usain Bolt, he'd have taken on most ""uncrippled"" amateurs and beaten them soundly for certain.   And then what about the old Sikh guy who ran in the London Marathon last year and completed the 26 miles: 105 years of age was it? Something like that.   I won't mention my activities, but I'm old and crippled as you put it and I can tell you that it doesn't make a difference to what you can do if you have a will to do it. Obstacles can be overcome at any age in any body so long as you exercise your mind.   You're clearly an ageist and you have a stereotyped view of the ""crippled and old"" as you call us. That's a flaw in your character you ought to do something about."

I appreciate running because I know I could lose the use of my legs.  That does not mean I look down on a paraplegic. I appreciate my energy and youth because I will grow old. That does not mean I looked down on my bedridden and senile grandmother before she passed. To paraphrase Epictetus, ""I do not say they do poorly, just that they are"".  I do understand what you mean about the mind conquering barriers. To conquer barriers within your control in pursuit of virtue is great. On the other hand, another Epictetus paraphrasing (I believe), to pursue something outside yourself is not virtuous. (Edit: something about the vanity of going against your own nature)  In short I think my comment was straw manned to some degree, which is fine because you make a valuable point. I agree that one shouldn't hang up the gloves, so to speak, because of age or physical barriers."
Stoicism,38tn21,stoic78,2,Sun Jun 7 20:44:47 2015 UTC,"This interchange has sparked a number of thoughts in me about gratitude and privilege. Now I am wondering to what extent all expressions of gratitude are expressions of privilege, and potentially offensive to outsiders.  For example, the familiar expression ""I am grateful to have food to eat"" before sitting down to eat a meal. To the person speaking, it is a recognition of the contingency of the situation -- I might not have been in a position where I had food to eat, I might some day in the future not have food to eat, and other people in the world do not have food to eat.  Usually there is no one starving in the near vicinity when such a Public Display of Gratitude (PDG) is expressed -- everyone is sufficiently nourished, if not over-nourished, in societies such as the US where I live. But this expression could also potentially be an offensive expression of privilege, a justification for one's arbitrary position in society. Feeling good about my contingent experience, am I motivated to end world hunger and feed starving people? Some would be so motivated, but others would be placated by the expression of gratitude for one's own privileged situation.  At Thanksgiving one year our family went around and said something we were grateful for. Both me and my wife said each other. I thought that was great, until a family member started teasing me about it later, and I realized maybe his marriage wasn’t so great and hearing our PDGs made him envious.  EDIT: Similarly, I've balked a bit when I've heard filthy rich people express gratitude for their fancy homes, luxury vehicles, and expensive vacations. There was a quality to the expression that reminded me of the phrase ""humblebrag,"" as in an expression that appears to be humble but is simultaneously bragging about one's privilege.  I realize William Irvine thinks the point of praemeditatio malorum is for experiencing gratitude to thus reverse the Hedonic Treadmill. Donald Robertson argues that this is an Epicurean view, based on pleasure-seeking as the goal of life, and proposes that praemeditatio malorum is instead about realizing the Stoic notion that externals are neither good nor bad and have no moral weight, no say in whether one is living well or not. If that is our focus, then by practicing praemeditatio malorum we should not feel gratitude but simply a readiness for anything, as well as refocusing our energy and attention on what is in our control. This kind of focus would also eliminate the privilege component of PDGs because having some contingent external thing is neither a cause for celebration nor for expressing our pleasure in having it."
Stoicism,38tn21,duffstoic,2,Sun Jun 7 23:34:28 2015 UTC,This makes a lot of sense.  I think recognizing your privilege is important from a social justice perspective.  But then what to do from there? Cast it aside? Don't bring it up?  I will admit my use of negative premeditation is mostly coming from Irvine.
Stoicism,38tn21,stoic78,2,Mon Jun 8 00:16:44 2015 UTC,"Yea, honestly I'm torn. I think Irvine's approach is appealing and useful. And gratitude research clearly indicates very practical benefits from cultivating this quality that I am tempted to call a virtue. But Irvine's approach is radically different from Robertson's, which calls upon Epictetus. It is one thing to express one's gratitude for an external thing and another to say to all externals ""this is nothing to me.""  In terms of privilege, it is an interesting question as well. Most forms of privilege we cannot cast aside, such as my maleness, whiteness, being born in a developed nation, and so on. And bringing it up can upset people, but so can ignoring it. I've heard some claim that using one's privilege to bring about greater justice is the correct approach, and I am inclined to agree, but I'm not always clear how to do that myself."
Stoicism,38tn21,duffstoic,2,Mon Jun 8 19:45:09 2015 UTC,"I've heard some claim that using one's privilege to bring about greater justice is the correct approach, and I am inclined to agree, but I'm not always clear how to do that myself.   I'm in a field of academia that is very white-male dominated.  One of the best things I've figured out to do so far is to make sure I explicitly encourage everyone who is doing well to consider graduate school.  Usually this takes the form of an end of the semester personal e-mail to the top 10 or so percent (I forgot last term >_<).    Anecdotally, the white males typically tend to already have been considering it while people who are ""less-privileged"" tend to be surprised that I think they could get an advanced degree.  One young woman of color was shocked that I thought she could go to graduate school, which shocked me because she has easily been one of the most capable students I've taught.    So, if you have a mentorship role of any kind, explicitly acknowledging strengths for all people may be effective in breaking up some privilege barriers."
Stoicism,38tn21,stoic78,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:22:51 2015 UTC,"I've done something similar, asking myself periodically, ""Am I doing the right thing right now?"" Usually the answer is yes, but sometimes it is no and I redirect my behavior towards something else."
Stoicism,38tn21,duffstoic,1 point,Sun Jun 7 05:48:06 2015 UTC,"I don't really like the question ""Is what I am doing right now virtuous?"" It is surely enough to ask ""Am I doing my best?"" We can't all be great artists whether of the Van Gogh type or of the Epictetus type but we can all try and do and give of our best.  The problem with the word virtuous is that it has too many negative connotations for those seniors among us such as myself who were born at the end of the Second World War and raised in its aftermath with threats of ""A spell in the army would do you good"" and ""They ought to bring back conscription for these long-haired modern youths"" etc., coupled with values especially where sex was concerned that harked back to a type of Victorian England Stoicism. As young people, we wanted our freedom, we didn't want to be bound and gagged, but to speak out, and so we rebelled and then along came the fifties and the sixties.  Western kids today really don't have a clue as to how hard life was back then. We had post-war austerity, food rationing, the Church of England, and a generally hard working life for the masses, and meanwhile many had profited from the war. So if anyone spoke to us of morals or virtue we would tell 'em to go shove same where the sun doesn't shine. We wanted to enjoy life not strait-jacket ourselves. We wanted to listen to Elvis or the Beatles or the Rolling Stones. Etc."
Stoicism,38twmz,StudyCapital,6,Sat Jun 6 20:00:01 2015 UTC,"I've found diet related issues to be one of the hardest issues to fight as I strive to be more virtuous. Your point about it being a habit is a good one, I think; you can muddle through any temptation through pure force of will, but nobody can do that forever. There has to be a system, the strength of which you can fall back on when you see a fast-food place and want a milkshake. (The devil's got nothing on a chocolate milkshake)  In my experience, the key is to separate the impulse you feel, the impression, from your will. The common thing to do in situations like this is to wrestle back and forth, arguing one way then the other.    ""Hey, a Wendy's, let's get ice cream!""   ""No, we're trying to stay on a diet, and we're trying to avoid gluttony - to gain self-control""  ""But we're so disciplined all the time, what could the one time hurt? And we'll have a smaller dinner, so it'll be OK!""  /Eats Frosty/   You can't win this sort of internal argument. You have to avoid it entirely. Recognize that you aren't really arguing with 'yourself' as the Stoics would define it, instead you're arguing with your base instincts. Hunger; dependence to sugar, salt, and fat; plain undisguised hedonism. This means that no argument should sway you, no rationalization should convince you to go against your principles. If you will be overtaken by gluttony at least acknowledge that that's what you're doing.  Give yourself some time for the initial impulse to dissipate and your reason to kick back in; if you want to get a bag of chips, set a timer for five minutes on your phone and reconsider if you still want them when it goes off. Don't grab food on the way home from work, stop at home and change then think about whether you might be able to make something healthier and cheaper at home.  Finally, you should have a clear system for determining what sort of food and what amount you deem reasonable. I think the best way to do this is to use a calorie counting app, tracking everything you eat and all exercise you do, while setting a calorie goal. If you haven't tried this before, I think you'd be surprised just how much easier this can make things. If you have the calories left for the milkshake, then you can indulge without worry of excess. If you don't, then you can cut the rationalization off at its knees with the clear decision that you already chose not to eat more than xxxx calories.  I hope some of that's helpful. I'm still working on this myself, along with trying to be more diligent in work and less hedonistic in my personal life. Got a long way to go, but Stoicism and life are all about the journey."

Is that helping you? The society? No, it's a pointless, wasteful endeavour. You have now decided to become a Stoic, as long as you strive to be one that is all you and anyone else can ask you of.  Musonius Rufus has said, that to become a philosopher is much more difficult than a doctor, because one has to unlearn bad habits.   The person who claims to be studying philosophy must practice it even more diligently than the person who aspired to the art of medicine or some similar skill, inasmuch as philosophy is more important and harder to grasp than any other pursuit.  People who study skills other than philosophy have not been previously corrupted in their souls by learning things contrary to what they are about to learn, but people who attempt to study philosophy, since they have been already in the midsts of much corruption and are filled with evil, pursue virtue in such condition that they need even more practice in it.   Stoicism has inspired CBT and there are many other effective therapies currently developed, but NLP is not one of them.

Things like black and white pictures, still pictures vs movies, small vs big, etc. The visualization technique combines this with the NLP concept of anchoring. Basically, you're creating a mental association between the original memory, and the modified memory, so whenever the original ""triggering""  memory comes up, your brain immediately recalls your anchored modified memory which you shrunk, made black and white, etc. And because of this, the emotional impact is reduced."
Stoicism,38r74z,sortefugl,0,Sat Jun 6 05:06:35 2015 UTC,"As RPSigmaStigma says, it's indeed an NLP technique. There is actually another NLP technique than the one mentioned, which works far better for past emotions that suddently reoccur.  Whenever you find yourself deeply embarrassed, or confused over something that happened in the past, replay it in your minds eye, but do so by making everything silly. Say it's because you asked the hottest girl in school out back in high school, but she rejected you by calling you stupid and smelly.   Play the scene in your mind, but have this song play over what's happening. Also, make everyone involved have overly dramatic tones in their voices, and have them act in an absurd and funny way. ""Ooooooh! Noooooooooo! You're tooooo smeeeeellly!!!"" add  ""ba-dum-tsj!"" sound-effect. Have them wear crazy exaggerated clothes, and make their expressions exaggerated and stupid.  If you have read the Harry Potter books, or seen the Harry Potter movies, it's a bit like how professor Lupus defeats the Boggart. Remember the Boggart? It's a great analogy now that I think about it. It hides in closets and chests, and they come at you unexpectedly. They take the form of your worst nightmare in order to scare you, or embarass you, and become your worst fear. The only way to defeat them is to imagine them in silly situations, point your wand at them, and yell ""Riddiculus!"".  I've eliminated so many of those former big problems using the Riddiculus method. At some point past shit that pops up can't teach us anymore, and when that happens and the reoccurence of them cause too much stress, it often helps to rethink them and put them in a new light."
Stoicism,38r74z,duffstoic,-1,Sat Jun 6 08:08:31 2015 UTC,"As an NLP practitioner, I wouldn't recommend the ""making it gone"" part. Deleting information rarely works, and if it does work it makes you less intelligent (ignoring makes you ignorant).  Instead, play with the ""submodalities"" like color vs. black and white, size, distance, whether you are seeing yourself in the picture or seeing out of your own eyes, and so on, while retaining the information but changing the feeling.  There are hundreds of methods that use this basic idea. I'm currently writing a book on the subject.  EDIT: Personally I find changing internal dialogue easier for me than changing pictures. I notice my internal dialogue, then notice the speed of the dialogue, the voice tone, and the location of the voice, then make changes like sloowwwwing itttt wwwaaaaaayyy doooowwwwnnn, changing the voice tone to a question? Where the sentence goes up at the end? Or changing the voice to a different accent.

We do not have the past, nor the future. Keeping that in mind, we should strive towards fretting as little as possible about the past and the future and merely focus on being present.  I take this with a grain of salt. I think it's important to be reminded of your past to re-ground what you learned from experiences. I also think it's important to look to the future to not repeat the same mistakes. So moderation is helpful.  But I always ask myself, why am I troubling myself with something I no longer have control over. And that usually takes the edge off the embarrassment/self-resent/whatever I'm feeling."

Any attempt to remove such material is kinda destructive of the unique person you are. Let's have you, warts and all.  Read what Epictetus has to say about habits, habitual thinking, and how the good and excellent man, replaces bad habits with good or leastways less bad ones. It's a lifetime's work.

In the end, these are all just methods.  But anyway, I guess with the thought processes you described, I can start out by cheesily accepting that I have not been able to accept my past blunders for a while, now.   And as for erasing them? They're surely a part of me now, and while they've made me unique (or not), I have learned from them.   But I'll still try to improve.

Stoicism,38nfij,saekheart,5,Fri Jun 5 20:17:20 2015 UTC,"In theory, Stoic virtue ethics is opposed to Utilitarian consequentialism.  Consequentialism says it isn't the thought that counts, it's the effect. Good intentions with bad consequences are bad.  Virtue ethics says it isn't the effect that counts (that is outside of one's control), it's what one chooses that counts. Good intentions with bad consequences, well it's the best you could do with the information and resources you had, so it's good.  Utilitarianism further says that what we should aim for is ""the greatest good for the greatest number."" But in practice, a person who can actually do this (e.g. gives a significant percentage of their income to highly effective global charity) has to cultivate tremendous personal virtue.  Similarly, someone who is cultivating personal virtue will focus on doing good for others and the world at large, because the nature of human beings is that of a political animal.  I think ultimately this debate is theoretical, whereas Stoic ethics are pragmatic. You cannot cultivate virtue without also working towards a more just world, or else you failed to cultivate justice. You can't cultivate love for all humankind (and perhaps beyond humankind too) without actually caring for and doing things for others. And so on.  EDIT: Regarding tranquility, remember that Stoicism was opposed to Epicureanism because Epicurus recommended withdrawing from society and not having children in order to achieve tranquility, whereas Stoicism considered political and familial duties to be essential to virtue and thus a good life and good society."
Stoicism,38nfij,duffstoic,3,Fri Jun 5 18:05:29 2015 UTC,"Totally with duff.  I tend to think that while theoretically virtue ethics and utilitarianism are opposed, I think in practice virtue ethics is a nice heuristic that will approximate utilitarian behavior most of the time.  The calculation of the greatest good for the greatest number for each action is a procedural impossibility.  Virtue ethics is easier and should approximate behavior you'd expect from a utilitarian."
Stoicism,38nfij,StoicBeCuZ,2,Fri Jun 5 18:12:29 2015 UTC,"I should add that Peter Singer, a Utilitarian, has greatly influenced my thinking (the link in my post above is to a book of his about giving money to highly effective global charity as a lifestyle choice). As a result of reading his book I committed a portion of my income to highly effective charity.  But recently I also realized that I actually live day-to-day as a virtue ethicist, specifically some brand of Stoic, because it is more practical for guiding my everyday behavior."
Stoicism,38nfij,duffstoic,2,Fri Jun 5 19:03:56 2015 UTC,"The benefits to humanity are a frequent consequence of virtue, but virtue is the only goal.   Consider first the case of a prisoner is solitary confinement. Can they do anything to benefit other persons? No. Is the prison external to the will? Yes. Can a person be virtuous and live the good life regardless of external impediments? Yes. Therefor living a life of virtue doesn't depend on helping others.   But also consider the case of the stupid person, or simply an ignorant person, who by some means is frequently incorrect with regards to external things, despite being incredibly wise and managing their own  soul perfectly. Someone who cannot help but say and do the wrong thing, thinking it be the right thing, because, for instance, they believe poison to be medicine, or cannot discern between tears of joy and tears of sadness in others, or have been tricked into thinking an innocent man guilty and a poor course of action beneficial. Such a person is in a way a prisoner of their stupidity, and though their virtue disposes them towards the good, their cage of idiocy keeps it at arms length.  Finally, consider men who's best laid plans are scattered by the winds of fate. A person who, serenely, hands great power over to one they truly believe will use it well, not realizing that they are in fact delivering this power to one who will use it ruinously. Or perhaps they make to oppose a tyrant, but fail, and in no way impede tyranny, but only bring ruin to himself and his fellows, and also inspire suicidal acts by those he loves as they despair at his failure. Or, more mundanely, someone who supports financial policies (both personal and political) which, though they believed to be beneficial to mankind, actually bring only ruin.  But at the same time, it is impossible that a man should live comfortably to nature and be an enemy of man, or not strive as best as they can for the benefit of all, because we were made for one another, and it is our nature to seek out the benefit of mankind."

Stoicism,38mopi,sleepingin,24,Fri Jun 5 05:13:30 2015 UTC,"Envy comes from wanting something external and seeing someone else get it.   The root cause is the external desire.  The thought process I go through to deal with that external desire is to remind myself that it is futile and irrational to get carried away by this desire. Firstly, being external, it is out of my control, so coveting it is tantamount to trying to control the outside world. If I covet money, then I am trying to make the world give me something. The world is subject to its our set of causation, so who am I am to try and mend it to my vain little desires. Especially since those desires do not give true happiness. They are illusory and fickle.   So if I envy my friend because he has more money than I, I remind myself what a vain and futile object of envy it is, and that money is not a true source of happiness. I practice negative visualisation whereby I have no money at all and he has much more. I visualise how in that circumstance, life goes on, the consequences are not so bad. I remind myself that having money says little about either of our intrinsic worth.   Before meeting my friend, I visualise the interaction, how he wears an expensive watch, and flashes his credit card, and shows off his successes. From the safety of my visualisation, I imagine how silly it is to be envious of these things. I remind myself that if he needs these things to justify his worth, he probably is intrinsically incomplete. I imagine how stressful it must be for him to have his self worth tied up with something that he can easily lose.   I also try and have positive role models in mind who personify the ability to have their self worth be independent of financial success. This helps convince me that money is not essential for happiness and self worth.   I build resilience in this way, and then when I next see my friend it is much easier for me to indulge his vices and to let the envy wash over me harmlessly."

Stoicism,38mopi,lordlaser9,2,Fri Jun 5 20:39:15 2015 UTC,"I'm going to sort of backpack off from this post... When you see something that you envy, you must take into account the time and effort that person put towards attaining the substance you envy. When I keep that in mind, I imagine all the things I was able to do with the same time.   There's an example of this in either an essay by Epictetus or Marcus. If two of you go to the market, each with 5 coins, and one of you purchases a head of lettuce for 5 coins, you may be envious that the other has food. However, you need to remind yourself that the other person invested something to get the head of lettuce.   Edit*: Forgot to mention that the above post is spot on. Thanks for the post.  I am not doing the best job of explaining this process, I'll see if I can find the excerpt"
Stoicism,38mopi,stoicized,13,Sat Jun 6 05:13:09 2015 UTC,"Contemplate the character of the target of your envy. Are they lustful? Frequently stirred and aroused by things external to the will? Driven away from the commands of reason by this passion? Are they greedy, having valued much you hold precious below the value of coin, and thus surrounded themselves with wealth at the cost of integrity, relationships, and the welfare of others? If so, then there is nothing to envy in them, for they are worse than you - their lives worse than yours.   Is the person you envy great? Have they attracted company with magnanimity, wealth with industry, influence with wisdom, and fame with bravery? Then consider what it would be like to be in his position with regard to externals, but absent his virtues, and what a poor life it would be, constantly disappointing others, and being undeserving of what you have. So truly, what you desire are his virtues, and those are within your power to obtain.   Is the person you envy much the same as you in character, but you envy them because of some character given to them by nature - beauty, health, fitness,  intellect. First consider what sort of a thing you are, and how you would feel to be evaluated by the standard of a photograph, or a tree, or  horse, or a calculator, and that this is how you are comparing yourself to this other person to find yourself lacking. Then, consider that to be upset by this is to be upset at nature and how she alloted traits to you and to him, and this is an absurd dispute to engage in. First, to be setting yourself against the whole of the cosmos, something so tiny against something so grand, second, that you are but a part of nature, and so to oppose it is like if an atom within you were to become your rival, and finally, that all of your good qualities come from the same process that assigned such things to the person you envy."

So truly, what you desire are his virtues, and those are within your power to obtain.   This is a really nice way to think about it. If the traits are within your reach then your steps are clear; to obtain those traits that you wanted. If they are not, because of nature or whatever other forces, within your grasp then there is no meaningful point to fret over it.   Contrasted with the other poster:   I imagine how stressful it must be for him to have his self worth tied up with something that he can easily lose.   which seeks to resolve envy by essentially putting down the other person such that you now feel as successful as him."

Stoicism,38mopi,-WISCONSIN-,2,Fri Jun 5 19:26:13 2015 UTC,"One trick is to realize that their achievement doesn't save them from the threat of envy, stress or unhappiness. Recognize that the person you envy wakes up is faced with just as many stressful situations as you are. The stress might be making it to an interview on time, giving the interview or closing a major financial deal. Those are privileged things to stress about, but you can't discount the reality that their life is only contextually better than your own. Internally, the struggle for feeling successful, enough and appreciated is universal and can only be eradicated by Stoic techniques, not by achievement.  Don't seek to achieve. Seek to grow."

Stoicism,38mopi,lordlaser9,2,Fri Jun 5 20:57:28 2015 UTC,A stoic doesn't resolve envy.   A stoic tries not to let envy occur in the first place. You have to be indifferent to everything outside of your sphere of choice. What people have has literally nothing to do with you.  Feeling envy is an evil and not in accord with nature.  Better worded responses in this thread if you have read stoic texts.
Stoicism,38mopi,Counter423,2,Fri Jun 5 18:29:40 2015 UTC,"""And what must I say of envy? It is the worst of evils. I call it envy whenever someone is grieved over the success of others. All grief is a disease, and envy is the worst grief, whether we call it a passion or a kind of pain which borders on grief.  But the method of cure which I have mentioned is in all cases the common one. We must observe what is shameful and to be shunned in the instances of those who are caught in the violent grip of these diseases, for in such men the disgrace is clearly seen. But we must not think that we do not have our share of disgrace because we do not see it in ourselves. The lover is blind with respect to what he loves; the insignificant vices which we overlook in ourselves because of our blindness cannot be overlooked in others because they are so large.  Hence we must find some mature person who can see these vices and urge him to reveal with frankness all our errors. Next, when he tells us of some fault, let us, first, be immediately grateful to him; then, let us go aside and consider the matter by ourselves; let us censure ourselves and try to cut away the disease, not only to the point where it is not apparent to others, but so completely as to remove its roots from our soul. For if it is not removed, it will be watered by the wickedness of the other diseases dwelling in the soul and sprout up again. Therefore, we ourselves must pay attention to each of the diseases which we notice in our neighbours to see if any of these ills are in our own soul. For this disease must be cut out while it is still sprouting and before it has become so large as to be incurable.""  Galen"

I'd recommend meditating regularly on the following passage from Marcus:  ""How much trouble he avoids who does not look to see what his neighbor says or thinks or does, but only what he does himself, that it may be just and pure.""  Repeating mantra-like passages like this throughout the day assists me greatly in my stoic practice. I carry around a small Moleskine notebook filled with ""Stoicisms"" that I've collected since being introduced to the philosophy. If I recall correctly, the ancients did something like it as well.

Stoicism,38m3vn,blackbird518,19,Fri Jun 5 02:40:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to directly answer your question. I believe you are focusing on the trees and missing the forest. The number one thing you need to help get over relationships is time. Given enough time, this too shall pass.   That being said. Some stoic exercises that will help make things easier in the interim.    Accept each emotion and feeling. Don't stop yourself from feeling emotions because they don't feel good. You cannot control your emotions. You can only control how you deal with them. Perception is a Stoic discipline. Recognize that your emotions have no ability to harm you. Only by perceiving them as harmful do you allow them to harm you. Action is another stoic discipline. Experience the negative emotion, then get moving with your day. Experience the next one, and keep acting. Spend a little bit of time trying to understand it (don't spend hours, just a minute or two), then let it go and keep moving.  You cannot control his behaviour, only how you react to it. He may do shitty things, he may do kind things, he may be selfish or generous. You cannot control this. You are only responsible for your actions and your perception of his actions. If he does something negative you can allow that to hurt you, or you can re-frame the action and see that he is hurting and does not know how to communicate this in a healthy way. Refer to step 1 for a stoic way to respond. You can be hurting. Emotions can hurt. Experience the emotion, then let it pass.    Aside from those first two methods of working through difficult situations I have a bunch of preferred methods as well that are not primary stoic exercises but stem from the stoic writings of Seneca and Marcus Aurelius.    Practice your contemptuous expressions Meditate for 3, 5, 10min. Whatever is comfortable. And practice 'negative visualization' Avoid the Narrative Fallacy. Find the strength to maintain an honest perception of the events in your life and your reactions to them. The Narrative Fallacy may help you find short term comfort through rationalizing away these painful emotions. But in the long term you will still have to work through all the suppressed hurt. Or, continue to lie to yourself.    Finally, really take home the stoic discipline of action. All of the above are exercises to help you work through all these tough emotions. But this doesn't mean spend your entire day wallowing and meditating away. Fill your life with action! Find new activities. On Wednesday's, volunteer at an animal shelter. Join a flag football league. Join an improv class. Start working out, or do yoga. There are tens of thousands of new activities you can be doing for an hour or two each day. Those hours are going to fill you with a rush of dopamine, endorphins, seratonin, cortisol etc depending on what you're doing and will absolutely take your mind off of your current situation.    Remember, time will help all of this. I think you should revisit your friendship with your ex after a month or two of practicing the above exercises. You'll be in a much more clear and grounded state of mind."

You're on the right track and you more than certainly have the endurance to keep moving.  As far as Stoicism is concerned, Action is mandatory of anyone who would consider themselves a Stoic. A Stoic has the responsibility to bring happiness to their fellow man by working (and playing) in ways that improve the life of themselves and of the rest of mankind. Philanthropy is a good word to describe these actions. Expanding a little, there are three primary disciplines that most stoics agreed on. In that link, they called the discipline of Perception the discipline of 'Assent'. The article does a powerful job of introducing the disciplines and their virtues and if you are curious about the inner-workings of Stoicism, I recommend The Inner Citadel. It is a phenomenal book that really works through the expansion of these disciplines through the writings of major ancient Stoics. It is, however, a little tough to start with and I've already given you a few thousand words to read as it is!  If you're looking for a good, light read that will definitely help with the discipline of Perspective, I would grab Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, the Gregory Hays translation. This is collection of short writings, phrases, sayings, euphemisms and reminders that Marcus Aurelius wrote in his personal diary to motivate and ground himself during his 20 years as Emperor of Rome.   Remember, you're working on you right now. What other people are doing is not important. You have more than enough resources and willpower to work through this in a healthy way. Good luck!"

Stoicism,38m3vn,ZackSam,7,Fri Jun 5 09:05:44 2015 UTC,"Geckel nailed it over all, so I'm just going to focus on this:   Does this mean that I need to let go of my desire, my love for him? Is it selfish to love him? Is my love causing me to tighten my grip? I am afraid that by letting go... I'll lose him   You should let go of your desire, yes, in a certain technical sense - but I wouldn't stay too focused on that phrasing. You shouldn't cease loving him, but you should loosen your grip. Love is unselfish - a fundamental expression of your nature as a social animal. But no matter how it may feel, your love isn't specific to one person. Epicurus says:   With regard to whatever objects give you delight, are useful, or are deeply loved, remember to tell yourself of what general nature they are, beginning from the most insignificant things. If, for example, you are fond of a specific ceramic cup, remind yourself that it is only ceramic cups in general of which you are fond. Then, if it breaks, you will not be disturbed. If you kiss your child, or your wife, say that you only kiss things which are human, and thus you will not be disturbed if either of them dies.    That's a shocking passage that's hard to come to terms with (especially in our society, where we're comparatively insulated from death). But the approach is valid. What do you love? A human, an adult, a man. A person who loves you in return, has supported you, shares goals with you, et cetera. Insofar as you love him for being a human, direct your love towards humanity. Insofar as you love him for loving you, direct your love towards loving beings. On the day to day level, this attitude just makes your life better, but in times of loss, it should also lessen that. If he is gone from your life, that doesn't mean love is gone.  Stoicism isn't opposed to intimate, loving relationships. It opposes conditioning your life satisfaction upon things you can't control."
Stoicism,38m3vn,MSPaintClock,2,Fri Jun 5 11:15:17 2015 UTC,"I liked the example of the ceramic cup. But how would one go about rationalizing the separation from another, complex human being? Spending the past three years of my life with him has changed me as a person... in a way he rounded me out as an individual. I still have my flaws and quirks but he has become a part of who I am. He's influenced me and I have him, we both have changed and grown as a result of this reciprocity. It isn't easy to unassign specific meaning to him because he is a large part of who I am in this present moment.     Through this separation I am able to see him for who he is as a person, as a man... not as my ex. I can see his own flaws and his strengths with greater objectivity. In momemts of clarity I can rationalize how stepping away from the relationship is the healthier option for us as individuals and as a couple. But this only makes me love him more, makes me appreciate him more as a person.  Edit: Thank you for your response and your advice. I really appreciate it!"

Stoicism,38kky2,Corrupt_Philosopher,3,Thu Jun 4 20:43:11 2015 UTC,"This question reminds me of Zen And The Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance. What is quality? How do you know which thing is better than the other? The answer is you will know once you see it.   One good way to know if an action is virtuous is to try to imagine how you would feel after you commit the action. Do you feel bad? Do you feel regret? That is a good indicator that you should pick the other option.   As with most things in life though, it depends."
Stoicism,38kky2,MindfulMonk,3,Thu Jun 4 21:12:56 2015 UTC,"(This is mostly a repetition of my comment in this old thread.)  I think the Stoic approach would go back to their central conception of virtue, original stated as ""living consistently"", expanded to ""living according to Nature"", eventually elaborated into something more like ""to act in accordance with good reason in the selection and rejection of things according to nature.""  What, then, is ""according to nature""? To the Stoic, the highest thing ""according to nature,"" for a human, is the benefit of the whole community of rational beings. In choices with no impact on this community, ones country, city, community, family, and self come in decreasing order of priority. See these quotes on oikeiosis for more.  The virtues enumerated by the Stoics (wisdom, courage, justice, etc.) are all absences of different vices, which are in turn different kinds of mistakes in reasoning in the selection of things according to nature. For example, justice is the opposite of injustice, which might correspond to getting the order of priority wrong (for example by acting to benefit ones self at the expense of ones family, ones city over the community of rational beings, etc.).   Just to be clear, this order of priority does not necessarily mean supporting the ""status quo"" of any of these things. Sometimes one can best benefit ones country by changing the type of government, etc.  Even within ""self"", there is a hierarchy. Marcus Aurelius X.2 (in which the whole set above ""self"" is grouped as ""social""):   Take heed to what your personal nature craves, knowing that you are solely at nature’s disposition; comply with it and do it, unless it involves injury to your animal nature. But correspondently, give heed to each craving of the animal nature and accept it in full, unless it involves injury to your nature as a rational being: and the rational is ipso facto social. Apply these criteria to life, and do so without fuss.    This hierarchy roughly corresponds to the Stoic physics concerning different kinds of motion. See the text from Simplicius's Commentary on Aristotle's Categories quoted as text 62 of Inwood and Gerson's The Stoics Reader.  This conception of virtue seems less purely altruistic than other (more Christian influenced) interpretations.   Also, in practical terms, the Stoics don't seem to have gone through this analysis with every decision. Instead, they seem to have justified general rules for behaviour on these basis, and then tried to follow these rules. See Cicero's discussion of war in On Duties, and Seneca's Letter 94: On the Value of Advice and Letter 95: On the Usefulness of Basic Principles."
Stoicism,38kky2,cleomedes,2,Fri Jun 5 03:32:58 2015 UTC,"To me, practicing Stoicism is about following the virtue of nature and channeling that through my actions and thoughts.  Deciding what's right and wrong in any given situation is not always easy. But when you break a situation down to one of the core values of Stoicism (you have control over your own mind and actions, not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength) these situations usually become a bit easier to rationalize. In the situation you presented, I would think about it in simpler terms. This person wishes for the plug to be pulled, your input should no longer a factor. It does not effect you directly, it is their pain and their life, and ultimately their wish."

Don't strive to please society. Strive to please yourself. I guess this sounds hedonistic but I don't see hedonism and stoicism being mutually exclusive.   If you pick up a dollar bill on the street, it is your choice to turn it to the police or not. Whose to say that making the police find the owner of the dollar bill will take up more police time than the dollar bill is worth? But what if a homeless man is down the street starving and could use a pizza? Who's going to reward you for your generosity when you go home and your kid is also starving?  By fitting into society, you forget one VERY IMPORTANT member, yourself. Make your own judgments. Would you pull the plug? Well does it look like the person needs release from his pain? Does you think he should strive and get better? Is it within your means to continue his medical payments? Will a god come down and smite you for making the decision you did? Or will you get people around sympathize, if not applaud you, for making a hard decision?  We are only good people when we are all good people at the same time, therefore, be a utopia. But just read Brave New World by Aldous Huxley to find out how that wouldn't work out."
Stoicism,38kky2,winndixie,-1,Fri Jun 5 19:59:15 2015 UTC,"Well the first thing I think to realize about Stoicism is that it is about practical ethics, not ethical theory. Ethical theory is the main thing that philosophers who study Ethics do in the contemporary world, but this wasn't even a thing really until Diogenes Laërtius reframed philosophy in the 3rd Century CE as about doctrine, school, and founder, aka about ideas rather than lived reality.  So the question you asked was a theoretical question about biomedical ethics (unless you, right now, have a loved one in this situation and are actually wondering what to do). Stoicism has little to say about such matters.  But as to how to live virtuously, actually, right now not theoretically in some time in the future, Stoicism has a lot to say about that."
Stoicism,38jqrj,smith137,4,Thu Jun 4 18:04:09 2015 UTC,"While I appreciate that Tim Ferriss has encouraged his readers to read Stoic primary texts (especially Seneca's letters), I have to laugh whenever I hear Ferriss' name associated with Stoicism.  Tim Ferriss' philosophy of life can be encapsulated in the phrase, ""cheating within the rules.""  For example, he publicly boasts about his winning at kickboxing on a technicality, by losing weight rapidly using a radical dehydration technique, thus weighing in at a much lower weight class, then gaining back the weight in a sport that has not yet adopted such extreme measures, then pushing his (much smaller) opponent out of the ring.  I know a friend who was involved in Argentinian tango (in Argentina) around the time Ferriss was learning this art form. For those not aware, tango is improvised couples dancing, where the man ""leads."" According to my friend's report, Ferriss hired a woman to choreograph a Tango dance and then they did their choreographed performance, fooling the audience into believing that Ferriss was leading when in fact he was an unskilled noob to tango.  Ferriss' ""world record in tango"" is literally him standing there while a woman spins around and around, something that would never be seen in tango at all. You can watch the stupidity of this record in all its glory here on YouTube.  The only business Ferriss has ever successfully started himself was a supplement company that made many wild promises for it's nootropic supplement. The supplement industry is an unregulated industry known for its wild promises of miracle cures that have not been backed by any evidence whatsoever.  Everything Ferriss does is within this idea of ""cheating within the rules,"" whereas Stoicism is based on the idea that virtue (areté) is the only good. Ferriss sells promises of wealth, health, and fame, and clearly seeks these things as ends in themselves without regard to cultivating virtue. His ""Stoicism"" is the ultimate in sophistry."
Stoicism,38jqrj,duffstoic,2,Thu Jun 4 20:49:46 2015 UTC,"It's easier to make a simplistic catch-all condemnation of an individual rather than examine complexity and nuance isn't it?  Some of Ferriss methods may indeed be questionable. And so I'd wager are some of yours. But he has also undeniably helped many people - both through his books and his charitable works. While not successful in starting a business per-se he has written several bestsellers and advises many successful startups. He makes efforts to share how to do all of this, for free and for money.  If we look at the stoic definition of virtue rather than the modern one (which you don't seem to be), it goes something along the lines of living as humans were designed to live, to live in accordance with nature.  We see Ferriss learning, contributing, pursuing wealth and health but also advising not to cling closely to any success or failure.   I'd say if Ferriss calls himself a Stoic, give him the benefit of the doubt or at least acknowledge all his works. Rather than give the equivalent argument to ""Marcus Aurelius had no virtue, he ordered people to be fed to lions for Chrissakes, click here to see the horror""."
Stoicism,38jqrj,salinungatha,5,Fri Jun 5 03:54:04 2015 UTC,"Stoicism is growing in popularity. Naturally then we will see ever more people sticking to the label and ever more people emerging as the Holy Disciple deciding who is a True Stoic and who is not.  Never ever forget that what we view as Stoicism is basically the private diary of a Roman Emperor, the cliff notes version of a former slave's teachings as recorded by a Roman official and a collection of letters by a fantastically wealthy, albeit sickly and extremely educated person to various people in his life. Meanwhile the school has ben alive for hundreds of years and I guarantee that they don't see eye on eye on many issues beyond the sovereign precept. Oh and the whole thing is written in the context of Ancient Rome, which kind of does not easily apply to modern life.  The point here is that Stoicism leaves a lot of room for interpretation and needs a lot of work to be put in modern context. While in Ancient times morality was imposed by society and identical to the laws and religious precepts, in modern Western society we only have laws left and it is up to us to define morality. So here for example we have room for work on a modern version of Stoicism, which might just include the rule ""Thou shalt stretch the rules as far thou can."""

Ferriss' bio is made up entirely of ""cheating within the rules"" activities: his cheating at martial arts, his bogus tango world record, his scammy supplement business, and so on. That's what he decides to publicly advertise. And his methods focus on tips and tricks for fooling others in order to gain fame and fortune. Fame and fortune are ""indifferent"" to happiness, not according simply to me or a modern definition of virtue but an ancient Stoic definition of virtue. Epictetus, Musonius Rufus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius all condemned those who pursued fame and fortune directly through shady means.  Did Ferriss raise money for Charity:Water? Yes he did. Charity:Water happens to be a controversial charity that supports Christian missionary work in Buddhist Cambodia and sadly is probably not very effective at its mission, but is great at marketing. Ferriss also clearly has other virtues (just as everyone has a mix of virtue and vice) such as discipline in exercise, but weirdly prefers to emphasize not virtue in physical cultivation but hacks and tips and tricks, superficial stuff.   ""Marcus Aurelius had no virtue, he ordered people to be fed to lions for Chrissakes, click here to see the horror"".   Comparing charlatan Tim Ferriss to Emperor Marcus Aurelius is pretty silly."
Stoicism,38jqrj,duffstoic,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:42:25 2015 UTC,I never thought of it from that angle. While I do agree with a lot of your points I do believe that it is good to have someone with his level of influence promoting stoicism. He can reach a lot of people at once and when he tells people to read stoic literature and mentions Seneca's name it brings a lot of exposure to the lifestyle. That way people can go out and educate themselves around the philosophy and make their own decisions about what it means to them.

Should a Stoic care about this issue at all? What would a Stoic do regarding this issue?   Is shaming a good method to change behaviour? Shaming can work on some people, but the same can be said about other methods like positive reinforcement. Just because something is effective doesn't mean you should do it and that there isn't a better way. Shaming is seductive, because it is easy and some derive pleasure from that. Personally I find shaming a vice and would refrain from it. There are more useful methods of behaviour change.  Is hating fat people ok?  Hating other people is a vice and is also irrational. I hope this doesn't require explanation and if someone does need it, please read Meditations, Discourses or Letters.   Should a Stoic care about this issue at all?  Stoicism is not about passivity and being only concerned with yourself. This is explained well in the FAQ https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/faq#wiki_does_stoicism_encourage_passively_accepting_your_fate.3F Depending on your own individual circumstances you can judge how important this issue is to you.   What would a Stoic do regarding this issue? If the Stoic judges the issue to be important and relevant(he/she can do something about it) the Stoic would act accordingly. The first and foremost thing is that a Stoic would lead by example, looking after your body is a good thing, health is a preferable indifference, but what you eat and if you exercise is under your control, if you have a disease that causes you problems that is not under your control.   Lead by example.  Impacting change on a very global scale is usually a waste of energy and I tend to recommend to help those in your immediate circle. Do you have a friend that has a problem with weight? Try to help him without shaming. You can try the following:   Eat out together and try to nudge the menu to healthier choices. Invite him to a dinner, try to make simple dishes that if he asks on how to prepare it it would be super simple.  Nudge him to go for a walk, then progress to a slight jog or join the gym with you.    TL/DR. Decide if the issue is important to you currently. Lead by example. Spend you effort where it matters(you can see the fruits of your actions). Try encouragement instead of shaming. Find a virtuous path to help others."

Grounding your opinion in scientific facts is good, but digging a bit deeper and staying skeptical a bit longer until there is more good studies is often the better path to take.  That being said, why did I mention it works on some people? Because we know that shame, guilt and even fear societies exist. A well known example of a shame society was traditional Japan(think samurai's), one would commit seppuku to avoid living with the shame. Was this the optimal society? Would I want to live in one? No, I would rather live in a society based on virtue."

Interesting link debating the study. Sounds like ""further research is needed"" as they say at the end of every journal article, but I don't think the ethics boards would allow direct fat shaming as an experimental condition, so we will have to continue to speculate.  I think it is at least a plausible hypothesis that shaming increases stress-relieving addictive behaviors, as that concurs with my observation of people actually suffering from addictions who indulge in their addictive vice to escape bad feelings. Being publicly shamed induces bad feelings, so I think it is likely that people who emotionally eat would do so in response to being publicly shamed. Also obesity is correlated with stress itself, and being humiliated is a stressful event."

Or your sense of good and evil may differ from theirs. In which case they’re misguided and deserve your compassion. Is that so hard?   I obviously do not have the same worldview as these people. I do not view fat people as an evil. And to view fat people as an evil, which I believe these people do, is a terribly misguided view. Everyone is just living their life the best way they can. For some, they are exceedingly thin, others fat, but neither evil. So when someone is so filled with irrational hatred as to put a class of people into a category of evil, I just feel sorry for them.

Gluttony is no doubt a vice, but most people are not obese because of gluttony but due to a variety of environmental factors, increased fructose consumption, and the processing of various foods. (See also Fat Chance by Dr. Lustig.) Fat shaming is an ineffective strategy in any case for changing behavior of those that do overeat due to gluttony, according to numerous studies like this one. Therefore fat shaming individuals on the internet and participating in group hatred is a vice. We ought instead to show justice and temperance towards those who are obese, not hatred. Anger is one of the chief ""passions"" that we ought to transform or eradicate in ourselves, as Seneca argued. But other people's hatred, including the group phenomenon pointed to here in the OP, is not in our control. We ought not to hate these haters either, but pity them, for their vice causes their own downfall in terms of eudaimonia (living well, happiness)."

An obese woman with a diet coke is slightly ironically funny, but an obese woman with a milkshake isn't actually funny, it's sad at most, if that's pitiful to you. Putting images of people that are overweight up with no actual comedy happening in the image isn't funny, it's just being a dickhead. If it was actually funny, it could also work in /r/funny or wherever else.  A fat guy at the gym gets off the treadmill and sits down for a second to catch his breath and it's funny? He's at least trying. The person taking the picture is the one I feel worse for, their lives are so shallow, or they have been hurt so much that it gives them glee to get fake internet points for taking pictures of overweight people.

With casual and frequent posts like that, it normalizes the ""fat people suck"" narrative -- now it's no longer a story about how I was very inconvenienced in a plane, but it's a story about a fat guy who is minding his own business and still deserves ridicule for existing.    To answer your question: I would definitely ask him/her to move,  or (if that didn't work) ask the stewardess to reassign my seat. If no solutions are possible and I am destined to stay there, I would just try to deal with it as best as I could. My comfort is important, but harboring those negative feelings or being offensive is only going to make it worse for everyone. It just is what it is at that point...

Stoicism,38dved,-Enkara-,-6,Thu Jun 4 04:21:22 2015 UTC,"sometimes you need strong emotions like hate to force others to change. If people didn't grow to collectively hate racism and racists, there would be alot more openly and proud racists in the world etc"
Stoicism,38dved,Harvestmans_lost_leg,4,Thu Jun 4 06:12:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can really force others to change.  What you can do, and what is often seen as forcing change, is using fear to make people conform to your wishes.  Nationalist movements and religions have done this for thousands of years.  Look around you though, as a class of movements, religions and nationalisms are crumbling.  Social justice is the same human social mechanic wearing new clothes.  It's not actually fighting racism and sexism, just forcing it underground through fear of shame.  Meet the new boss, same as the old.  What little you can do is expose people, especailly children, to experience.  Racial integration in schools is probably the biggest effector of actual change in racist views in the past 50 years.  Aside from that, you can only change yourself.  Only by being the best, most understanding, most wise version of yourself can you really encourage others to say ""Wow, that person really has it figured out.  What makes them tick?  I want to be like that."" and thus begin the process of change.  Since ""the world"" in this context is comprised of individual people, and since individual people can't be changed, the only way to do your part in changing the world is to evolve into the best version of yourself.  Hate comes from lack of understanding, so if you hate racists, you're not becoming more understanding or compassionate.  You're just the new hater, the new shamer of anyone you disapprove of.  You fall into Neitschke's abyss, your shadow consumes you and you become as bad as those you hate."

Anyway, it helps me face anything that would normally make me angry, sad, anxious, frustrated, etc. The ""inconvenience"" has a broad definition. It includes dealing with traffic jams, inconsiderate drivers, long lines at the super market, or anywhere else, stupid comments made by anyone anywhere, sports teams losing, people who are rude, selfish, ungrateful, unfortunate events, such as the flooding of a condominium. Anything. I ready myself and welcome opportunities to remain calm, rather than to explode with negative emotions.  For me, serenity equals happiness. That is what I 'm trying to achieve.

Reciting mantras, practicing simple drills (is this good,  bad,  or indifferent?  What sort of thing is this, broken down into its general components? Etc.), various sorts of meditation, exposure, and finally just putting forth effort to control yourself when you can will all help. I'll note in particular that you can't expect to just pull stoicism out of your pocket when extreme unpleasant emotional swings occur - you have to work your way up by practicing with the small stuff. You might not even bother to try to keep in check the minor injury you do to yourself when, e.g. You burn your dinner and are mildly annoyed and disappointed, but that sort of situation is often the best practice."

For then I should be deprived of a great prize both of war and of victory, a prize such as no human being has ever yet obtained. And what is this prize? To forgive a man who has wronged one, to remain a friend to one who has transgressed friendship, to continue faithful to one who has broken faith. Perhaps all this seems incredible to you, but you ought not to disbelieve it; for surely all goodness has not yet entirely perished from among men, but there is still in us a remnant of the ancient virtue. And if anyone should disbelieve it, that but renders the more ardent my desire, in order that men may see accomplished what no one would believe could come to pass. For that would be the one profit I could derive from our present ills, if I could settle this affair well and show to all mankind that there is a right way to deal even with civil wars."""
Stoicism,38eivh,StoicBeCuZ,2,Thu Jun 4 16:30:22 2015 UTC,"I recommend compassion.  Put yourself in his shoes and remember he's no sage.  It sounds like he's flaking out with some sort of anxiety/emotional reaction that's got him feeling trapped.  Others ARE still prisoners to impulses and don't reflect on them.  Also, note that your reaction is part of the destructive cycle of irrationalism.  He has a series of emotionally guided choices that make him feel trapped and guide his action. Now, your indignation and anger is guiding yours.  Emotions run amok are killing this friendship.  It's difficult to remain indignant if you recognize that you are suffering from the same destructive mode of action as your friend.  I'd say the tough but stoic thing to do is objectively and with humility work through the situation.  Read Seneca's moral essay 'On Anger'.  My guess is, if your honest, your anger is driven a great deal by the surprise you feel about your friends behavior.  You are angry because he is doing things that violate you expectations.  It's unclear how your emotional reaction is his fault?  Someone didn't read their meditations and take to heart the expectation that your going to meet people very far from stoic Sageness.... Reading Aurelius generally is good advice because he struggles with the same feelings of impatience and frustration with his fellow man and has many self admonishments about how to think about it.  Then, you decide if you want the project and the friendship.  If so, stow you shit and approach your friend with the understanding of his faults that you should have had before and help him be the better person by example and with compassion.  If not, then follow the modal advice on this thread and cut bait... But not because your pissed, and 'avoiding people who make you upset' or because you are a self-righteous tool who can only tolerate those who meet your standards but because YOU want to abandon this Friendship.  YOUR FRIEND isn't making the choice for you not is your friend responsible."
Stoicism,38eivh,Aurelen,2,Thu Jun 4 06:20:55 2015 UTC,"This sounds pretty tough.  I think talking to other people about it, like you're doing here, is going to help you clear your head a little. Other than that, it sounds like your main priority is figuring out how to move on while preserving as much of your energy as possible. It's rough, but accepting that your former friend flaked on you and not expecting anything more from him would probably be best. Since you're on a Stoicism sub, I'll mention that this is where Stoicism is really helpful. Reading Stoic texts and adopting a Stoic perspective gives you a bone-deep sense that you can only do what's up to you and others' reactions are entirely up to them, and that cuts down on the negative feelings in times like these.  Some final thoughts about friendship. In my experience, you can't predict what people will be like when shit gets real except based on what they've been like in other such situations. No matter how many good vibes, great times and long conversations somebody might have with a friend, when that friend is counted on to do something that's not in his immediate interest, he might get terrified or decide it's not worth it, or have any number of other personal issues that make him quit. Good times are one thing, but putting time and energy into something because another person asks you to is another. That's been my experience, at least.  Good luck and hope this is worked out soon, OP."
Stoicism,38eivh,duffstoic,1 point,Thu Jun 4 09:45:43 2015 UTC,"My Stoic 2 cents:  First remember Epictetus' distinction: there are things up to us and things not up to us. Your friend's behavior is 100% not up to you. There is literally nothing you can do to get him to call you up and apologize or ""make him"" take responsibility.  At times like this in my own life, sometimes I've vividly imagined someone apologizing to me in my mind just to get closure for myself, because in reality I cannot force another to do anything, but it makes me feel better anyway.  All that is in your own behavior is your own actions and ""use of impressions,"" which is to say what you do and what you make this situation mean to you.  Marcus would recommend forgiveness, which I think is also the noble thing to do. But you also ought not to trust this friend with completing important projects again, for he has shown that he is untrustworthy on such matters. He may still be trustworthy as a drinking buddy, but not on work projects.  So the big question is, ""what will this event mean to you?"" I'd start there, making a list of what you think it means currently, and then exploring alternative meanings/responses."

It takes about 25 years on average to grasp the mettle of Stoicism. You will then be in a position to decide whether or not it adds up and whether or not it is for you. And don't believe anyone who tells you that playing at being a Stoic for a week and doing stuff that really has nothing to do with Stoicism will help. Stoicism cannot be learned overnight. It takes years of reading and hard study to acquire the right mentality, one that will enable you to live if not entirely Stoically at least relatively contentedly and philosophically.

Stoicism,38as83,lordlaser9,8,Wed Jun 3 11:43:06 2015 UTC,"The honest answer is that Stoicism was built for a world where food choices and ethical problems associated with food were very different from those of the modern, developed world.  What would a Stoic say about artificial sweetener? Food picked by poor immigrant workers? Organic? The Stoics had nothing except organic. These are problems they couldn't address.  With respect to diet, the Stoic framework can provide an answer. If your diet is a source of anxiety, shame or confused principles, you're not being Stoic about it. The anti-Stoic dieter is the perpetual fad dieter who is never comfortable with their body and never proud of their diet for the courage/habit formation it represents. They are constantly swayed by the judgments of others.  I say eat what you want (though think about animal ethics), and eat food that nourishes an exercise regime, especially weight training. Most ancient schools of philosophy, but especially the Stoics, were interested in weight training as a metaphor for moral progress."

Stoicism,38as83,saxonthebeach908,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:16:59 2015 UTC,"Just some insight into what I eat since changing my diet and my life: Every day I run to my local grocery store and buy:  two bottles of Ito En unsweetend Green Tea,  a bottle of Ginger Kombucha, a salad of only spinach, romaine, tomatoes, mushrooms, beansprouts, and carrots (salad bar); a can of Sardines in Olive oil, and a bag of microwave-steam Broccoli.    I eat the salad and sardines(yes) with my hands.  I don't use dressing and I usually drink about 40 oz of water with that.  Later on in my shift, I order 2 spring rolls and a small order of brown rice from the asian restaurant nextdoor and eat that with about 3/4lb of broccoli- this is also when I drink the Kombucha and take my fish oil and glandular complex.  I drink the two teas throughout the day while I work.  (warehouse work).  Usually fill my nalgene (32oz) about 6-8 times a day as well.  I haven't had soda in about 2 years and also don't eat anything containing: ""sugar"" as an ingredient(it can be in the nutrition facts as long as granules of sugar haven't been dumped into the mix); corn syrup of any sort; aspartame; maltodextrin; caramel color; any colorings; actually, pretty much anything that isn't made up of less than 8-10 ingredients.  I try to keep everything as simple as possible.  I shit about 3-5 times a day and always have tons of energy- always regular and don't get headaches or colds often.  I don't eat any red meat, and only consume pork and chicken sparingly.  I eat a lot of sardines, shrimp, salmon, fatty tuna, and nuts for my proteins and try to eat chia seeds and hemp powder a few times a week.    Edit: Breakfast is usually a whole-grain sprouted, flourless cinnamon raisin english muffin (whole protein: 18% dv of protein and fiber alone) with raw almond butter (4 tbsp/2 servings) and a lot of water."

Stoicism,38as83,bloodstainedsmile,3,Wed Jun 3 11:03:40 2015 UTC,"Isn't stoicism fundamentally about how to deal effectively with the overwhelming complexity of civilized life when our brains evolved to handle a much simpler world? Understanding and accepting what is within and without our control is the key.   Similarly, the paleo diet/lifestyle is about how to handle the overwhelming complexity technology has added to our food when our bodies evolved to handle a much simpler food supply. Instead of trying to exert further and finer control over our bodies and food, the paleo/primal movement is about accepting the hand our bodies have dealt us and working with the one thing we do have definite control over, which is the removal of modern innovations that serve only the superficial senses (refined sugars, processed foods, sedentary lifestyles, etc.)"
Stoicism,38as83,bloodstainedsmile,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:00:39 2015 UTC,"Well-said; I upvoted. I think we can agree on this refinement: your passion for Paleo is really about the anti-Stoic nature of capitalist scientific developments, which (as you state) encourage the production and sale of foods that have immediate, dazzling impact on the senses and possible addictive qualities, rather than on products that encourage balanced decision making and long-term, systemic health.   Properly, Stoics would have no qualms about using technology to leverage greater rational relations to one's food. Paleo is a safe option in the face of Monsanto, etc, but Stoic courage indicates that we should seek methods to eradicate anti-sage food products while stimulating sage-making food products.  I'd also challenge you with the idea that many products of science (though certainly not all) are better for the long-term health of the individual than traditional paleo options: whey proteins, well-constructed vitamin supplements, pasteurized milk, etc.   None of my arguments really contradict your claim, they just reshape it a little to argue that you're really anti-capitalist, not anti-technology."

The kinds of meditation people do now that they call Buddhism (Shamatha and Vipassana specifically) were largely invented in Thailand in the 19th century or are even more recent inventions. Same with yoga and other such practices."
Stoicism,388sdu,duffstoic,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:35:34 2015 UTC,"Buddhism makes metaphysical claims – Aurelius eschewed and even somewhat rejected metaphysics (if Irvine is to be trusted, I have purchased but not yet read Meditations).   that's true. although it needs to be modified a bit, because the practices today,although invented, draw a lot on the past (or attempt to do us). for example hatha yoga, as part of my academic sanskrit studies, i went to a nice seminar where a scholar was talking about newly translated documents (sanskrit is vastly understudied) from the late middle ages/early modernity where a lot of physical exercises were described, which scholars generally thought were a very recent thing (18th-19th century). same with meditation in the buddhist sense, it was around, just not very widespread among the laity or the monkhood even. the great thing about religions is that they always change but like to change by drawing upon their tradition or imagined tradition. i'd like to see that kind of thing happening more with modern stoicism. i happen to have a major in ancient greek and know a lot more about ancient dead stoicism than the kind of stoicism that people now practice, and i'd like to see them engage with the stoic tradition that still survives instead of wholesale ignoring it (like stoic physics or stoic logic or stoic grammar).   i guess by traditional buddhism i mean a buddhism that consciously tries to maintain that kind of tradition. i think a lot of contemporary 'western buddhism' has consciously rejected that. if you go to an actual zen temple, in europe or america or elsewhere, they're very big on tradition, and they're really not what you call a 'silent meditation' type of thing, cause they involve sutra study and chanting and so forth.   also have you checked out other more popular kinds of buddhism? i myself really like pure land buddhism."

You have to internalize the ideas in Stoicism so that it becomes your character to respond patiently in any situation.   Musonius Rufus writes that philosophy is one of the toughest things to learn, because you have to unlearn the bad habits you acquired while a doctor with a good mentor can acquire good habits from he beginning.   The person who claims to be studying philosophy must practice it even more diligently than the person who aspired to the art of medicine or some similar skill, inasmuch as philosophy is more important and harder to grasp than any other pursuit.   People who study skills other than philosophy have not been previously corrupted in their souls by learning things contrary to what they are about to learn, but people who attempt to study philosophy, since they have been already in the midsts of much corruption and are filled with evil, pursue virtue in such condition that they need even more practice in it."

Stoicism,380kzk,MSPaintClock,3,Mon Jun 1 08:00:21 2015 UTC,"For me, my teenage years were particularly hard - probably harder to face than anything else in life so far. (I'm 29, for the record.) The truth is, though, that life will always have its turbulent and calm periods. Life routinely throws curveballs, which makes reasoning more difficult and the truth harder to see. Being a teenager is just a particularly difficult curveball.    As things get tougher, your brain becomes preoccupied with survival (in a social or just plain physical sense) so it's hard to override your more base impulses, like ""I must fight back against the haters"" or ""I need to feel better right now, so I'm going to binge on <insert addiction here>."" It's harder to stand back and say, ""Actually, the problems I'm worrying about can all be fixed and spending more time on the internet, or letting myself be consumed with anger, will just exacerbate them.""   The thing is, though, that philosophies like stoicism exist specifically to help you rise above those impulses and handle life rationally. So of course you can use stoicism to address your current problems! That's what it's there for. Sure, it's easier to master your behavior when your life is going well, but there's also less motivation to do so because it's easy to become complacent.   But more generally:  Don't listen to people that say, ""You're a teenager, you don't understand."" ""Adults"" bring out that nonsense because it's easier wave your feelings aside than actually take you seriously. On the other hand, even as a very mature teenager (you sound like I was) there is still a lot left to be experienced in life and trust me: life will surprise you, overturn much of what you thought you knew and it will blow your mind. So it's important to remember that your thoughts and feelings are valid - never let anyone ever shit on them - but also realize that there's plenty to be learned from everyone and every situation you find yourself in.   I guess what I'm trying to say in a very roundabout and unfocused way that given that you're already studying philosophy on your own and thinking seriously about it, your reasoning facilities are probably pretty darn sound, and philosophy will help you deal with the kind of turbulence and emotional disturbances that both teenagers and adults have to deal with.   Have confidence in what you think and feel, but also keep an open mind."

In any case, my experience is that virtue brings out a sort of quiet, tension-free cheerfulness that's usually very resilient. I think it's because focusing only on what's under your control gives you a deep sense of security and makes many sources of tension vanish."

I find that this alleviates a lot of the stress I feel when people I care about are overflowing with emotion around me. I also tend to pick up and internalize the emotion of the people around me. But this has helped me out."
Stoicism,37wdvp,omegawhitemage,3,Sun May 31 00:11:54 2015 UTC,What about when they are emotionally lashing out at you. I find this to be my biggest button. 99% of the time i give 0 fucks but when I am attacked by one person with this emotional spew I cant help but get angry. Its not that I cant take a step back its that I don't want to. I feel the need to punish their behavior. Reasoning has been unsuccessful.
Stoicism,37wdvp,mikeisrelic,3,Sun May 31 03:08:47 2015 UTC,"It depends what they're attacking you with. Honestly with someone insulting me emotionally it's only hurtful if it's something I haven't dealt with in myself, at which point its a good cue about something I can explore in myself. Therapy is a super useful place to explore these if you have trouble on your own."

Think about the last confrontation you had, and what you should have done better. Now imagine reacting the way you should have. Play the whole thing out. Act it out if you want to. You need to make a commitment in your personality to act differently.  Then, hopefully in your next conflict some of your ideas that you envisioned come to pass. You reflect and refine your actions and commitments further. Repeat"

Stoicism,37wdvp,cleftscout,5,Mon Jun 1 13:06:28 2015 UTC,"I would say, set your expectations for yourself, and then set yours for them.   Since they've already proven themselves rather difficult to deal with, you should expect that whenever you see them, and remember to be conscious about this, so that the emotion of the moment doesn't take you away. Stoicism is about having minimal expectations of everything and everyone around you.  Likewise, try to be vigilant regarding yourself. When in an interaction with the said person/people, watch your feelings. Feelings are infectious if you don't watch them. Choose to react how you want to, but do not let yourself reflect that energy back towards them increasing that feedback loop of negative emotions.  Personally I also find that replying or speaking in monotone also works for me. Make no anger, no sarcasm, no emotion whatsoever show in your voice. My mother is difficult to deal with, being that she misinterprets everything I say into a demand or a statement of dissatisfaction, when all I do is make requests or state facts.   What I've learned that works with me when dealing with her is to speak in a factual, monotone way so that she doesn't have any emotional content in the conversation to use and freak out about.  The bottom line though, is that you can't control someone else's behaviour.. so expect the worse from them, and manage it while making the choice to emotionally detach yourself from him/her."
Stoicism,37wdvp,bloodstainedsmile,4,Sun May 31 09:50:49 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly sure everybody experiences that to varying degrees - this is really a cliche, but humans are social creatures.  So far, long-term, I've found persevering in Stoic practice to be very helpful. The more you acquire a Stoic perspective, the more you become centered and calm even in these situations. (I think you can generalize that to saying that, the stronger your sense of self, the calmer you're likely to be in any situation.)  Short-term, of course, that's hard, because you haven't built the right mental circuitry yet. I agree with u/omegawhitemage that taking a step back and reminding yourself this is their situation helps. I've also found that accepting the fact that my emotional state is currently whatever it is helps me and actually makes the emotions fade. (This is an idea you might see in the writings of some psychologists, for example Nathaniel Branden, and in some Buddhist writings. This is an allegorical story of the process that I like a lot: https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/449671-one-evening-milarepa-returned-to-his-cave-after-gathering-firewood )  And really long-term, changing your situation as much as possible helps the most. Yes, Stoicism helps us deal with troublesome situations, which is why we practice it. But it would be insane not to change the situation to make it easier for us as much as possible. In most cases, we aren't powerless or held in captivity and at least in the long term we can change our situation significantly."

Stoicism,37wdvp,dairic,1 point,Sun May 31 13:57:33 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, what I try to focus on is if the outbursts are about something that's happened in the past is realizing that 1.) you can't go back to change what happened and 2.) the you of the past may have acted one way but the you of the present is ready to confront whatever your dealing with head on and with an attitude of acceptance. Accept the outbursts that happen around you as ok. When they happen, rather than focusing on the heat of the moment instead merely acknowledge the present and focus on the resources you have available to you to resolve the situation (if that's what it calls for, sometimes outbursts are just people letting off steam. If that's the case, let it happen and chalk it up to, ""ok, that's how they feel about that"" thumbs up done). One resource you always have available is a level head and it's more often than not your most useful tool. That doesn't mean you can't let things affect you. You're totally justified in reacting in whatever way you're naturally compelled. The point, though, is to pass those reactions through a filter of ""this is what is and isn't - these are the battles worth fighting and these are the ones that I and everyone else who engages them will spin their tires forever on - what effect am I going to allow this to have on me?"" By the time you answer those questions about whatever situation you're in you'll be past the knee jerk phase of being confronted with an out burst and ready to meet the situation with the ever important air of empathy. I find the golden rule in dealing with high emotions is to slow way down and listen more than you speak."

A year without going on a date. A year of having nothing which I consider to constitute essential parts of a healthy life."" How do you know these things? How do you know it will be a year exactly and not a year and 2 days, or 6 months, or 43 weeks and a day? You don't, and you can't.  I'll tell you what -- I went on a ton of dates when I was unemployed, broke, and living with family once I fixed my attitude about it, which was that I would simply go for it and see what happened. Confidence is sexy, and you get a lot more dates when you ask for them than when you sit at home and whine about it. :) There's always an excuse. I had a friend my age at the time who didn't have a car and so he said, ""I don't have a car so I can't go on dates, waaa poor me."" Meanwhile I was having my dates pick me up and drive me places just because I matter of factly said to them, ""I don't have a car, so can you pick me up at my place."" Other times I would ride my bike. If a date cared, I'd just move on to someone who didn't!  And that to me is the Stoic approach: focus on what is in your control, and do that aggressively while letting go completely of what is not in your control.  What is in your control in this situation?   You can study programming and practice 4-6+ hours a day. You can apply to jobs or contract work or an internship. You can meet ladies and ask them on cheap, fun, creative dates. You can exercise self-control with your addiction. You can make new friends or keep in touch with old ones on the phone or Skype or texting. You can pursue other positive, fun hobbies.   What's not in your control?   Whether a specific company hires you. Whether a specific lady says ""yes"" or ""no"" to a date. Whether you feel compelled to indulge in your drug of choice. Whether your friends blow you off.   Keep what's in your control firmly in view and pursue it with everything you've got, and let everything else slide."

Stoicism,37w0ql,duffstoic,9,Sun May 31 20:23:12 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I understand where you're coming from. Just graduated a few months back, still living at home, and pursuing software development.   In regards to ""being someone's assistant"". That won't go away for a while, regardless of your profession. Especially in software.   Imagine spending months coding an application/widget/program only to have your boss or higher up decide it's not going to be needed any more.  I didn't like that path. I'm choosing to follow my own path working independently, building a few start-up applications with clients. I work from home and program probably 5-10 hours a day depending on which day it is, that includes weekends. In my free time I work on physics and occasionally software for my website Infinity Spark and a few recreational activities of course.   I love it.   I have full responsibility for the applications, don't call anyone boss, and don't have to work in a cubicle.   Do I love it because I'm happy all the time? No. Absolutely not. If you know programming, you know it can be incredibly frustrating at times. Those times are the best times though, because the feeling you get when you finally solve the problem makes it all worth it.   Rambling a bit to give you perspective of what this path is like. If you're dead set on getting a job in the field, my advice to you: build software. Don't wait until you're ""ready"". Start now at whatever level you're at.   Game [ unity, libgdx, corona, javascript ] - make it. Website [ drupal, wordpress ] - make it Web app [ ror, django, cakephp, node.js ] - make it Bash script to do pretty much anything? - make it   The more experience you have and the more tools you know, the more attractive you will be to companies.   Solving puzzles? Not that important when they ask you to solve a coding problem and you can write down a working program off the top of your head in the language their team uses.   Every interview I've had, they spent 90% of the time asking me about my projects and experience I had on my resume: few small mobile games I made using LibGDX, my experience with WordPress and my knowledge of bash scripting.   Good luck with everything.   tldr:  Learn by doing. Build something.  Edit:  Yes, it might not appear that I've answered your question, but I know what you're feeling. The best way to get it to go away is to take on new projects. Learning by simply answering questions on code academy won't cut it. You've got to get your feet wet and start developing."

How do I give up all the hopes and dreams that some parts of myself are still clinging to?   The 'trick' I've found is not to try to eliminate the desires, but to cultivate desires for virtues more. Don't try to eliminate your desires directly, but simply acknowledge them and remind yourself that you value virtues more. It takes a lot of practice, but stuff like seeing your goals in comparison to the size of the universe helps. In some sense, virtue is 'big' like the cosmos is big."

These are all very pleasant things to have. They make your life rich and interesting. The problem is that if for whatever reason you can't have any of them, you suffer. Like you are suffering now. That's why Stoicism is useful. When you have things, you don't get too attached; and when you don't, you can do without.  Somehow you have to conceive the possibility of being happy with nothing. Just by yourself, left to yourself, left to your own nature, in your natural state. This isn't as impossible as it sounds. Just a few short years ago, you were a child, and you were quite happy, eating, playing, sleeping, without any thought for the future. You didn't have anything. Somehow you were always happy, and life provided food, a place to sleep, parents, friends, without any worry or effort on your part.   Giving up hope doesn't mean resigning yourself to a miserable life. I just means that you stop worrying, live each day in the most virtuous and balanced way that you can ,and let the rest take care of itself."

Probably the biggest source of happiness or unhappiness is your attitude to yourself (that's just my speculation right now).   If you're doing everything that's in your power to get to where you want to be, you won't feel self-reproach or self-loathing. That's a huge component of well-being. (That's Stoicism in a nutshell, of course - focusing solely on what you can do and ignoring the rest gives you serenity and joy.)  Of course, doing everything you can means doing it intelligently; working a very productive 4-6+ hours like /u/duffstoic said (instead of 10-12 hours that mostly get spent spinning wheels), keeping in touch with friends as others have said, staying healthy, etc. That way, you know you're not fooling yourself and you're investing your energy as best you can. That involves significant mental effort, of course, because you need to keep noticing what works for you and what doesn't. I think it's best to take it one step at a time and not rush, but never stop moving forward. Otherwise, if you try to change everything about your life at once, you could burn out and really set yourself back (speaking from experience)."

I'm not trying to be confrontational or aggressive, but is that really true? Or are you afraid of what it means to consider that life has no meaning? I'm not trying to somehow brag when I say I've lived years with the belief that life is inherently meaningless, and I know a few other people who feel the same way.   However, it is an uncomfortable mode of existence, especially if interpreted a certain way. If my life is meaningless, doesn't that mean I could just pointlessly throw it away? Why not do harmful drugs and be the biggest asshole on earth? Why does morality matter?  However, I've resolved this by saying that I could not be a happy human being if I lived as if there were no such thing as morality or purpose, and have constructed my own. I believe anything that leads to human suffering is immoral. I believe I have a purpose to improve my own life and the lives of others.  Side note: given my morality, if the whole earth vaporized instantaneously it would not be a bad thing, necessarily. It would end all suffering. (Suicide is bad because it causes others to suffer.)  I consider it the same way if you were given $100,000,000 and told to spend it any way you see fit. Sure, you could refkect on how meaningless money is and spend your life wasting it, but that would just lead to misery. If instead you spent it in a wise, disciplined way, donating to charities, living reasonably and taking on fulfilling hobbies, you'd be a much happier human being.

But there are also some social norms I strongly reject, for instance, excessive consumerism (which may also be rooted in my upbringing). Also I generally chafe at acting normal all the time, and I know many people who generally think I'm a weird guy, because I think superficial conformity is mostly a waste of time.    which cannot be said to be any more objectively desirable than abject misery   Do you mean in a strictly philosophical sense? As I've said before, I know little about rigorous philosophy. Still, I could see how that if there is no meaning to life, there would also be no meaning behind happiness and sadness - they are all the same. That's fine. But personally, philosophical considerations aside, I'm certain I greatly prefer happiness and life satisfaction. Now, it's hard to determine exactly what I want out of life, but that's why I turn to philosophies like stoicism, Buddhism, and different religions - as well as scientific studies - to see what humans more more less satisfied with their lot in life. I think I have a pretty good idea of which direction I need to head towards, at least.   I like calling myself a happy nihilist, or willfully ignorant one. When I think about the universe, everything seems pointless, but I do know I derive a lot of satisfaction out of pretending as though there was a purpose in life and being optimistic, and there's research to back that up. As someone who has lots of experience dwelling on the negative, I find being positive makes me a much happier and effective human being, even if it may seem like a philosophical cop out."
Stoicism,37rxve,5np,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:56:30 2015 UTC,"I think making an effort to be extroverted, admired, charismatic and well-presented is a waste of time. Same goes for displaying wealth (but slowly accumulating wealth through frugality can buy you a lot of freedom). I reject those kinds of norms, because being so concerned with others' opinions is a recipe for misery. However, I believe that loving, being loved and being kind to people are essential to happiness. I also believe that living morally, selflessly and intellectually is essential to having a satisfying life. I also realize I'm casually flipping between life satisfaction/happiness, because I'm still trying to determine which goal is more worthwhile.   Why even try to be happy at all?   Because my subjective experience of life matters to me. Doesn't it matter to you? If forced to choose between a happy, satisfied, meaningful and easy live versus a depressing, difficult and horrible one, wouldn't you choose the former - even if you were a full-fledged existential nihilist? Or would it truly not matter to you, because you see no difference between them?"
Stoicism,37rxve,epictetusdouglas,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:05:37 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I think we're more or less in agreement here. I just try to not dwell on some of the darker implications of nihilism and instead focus on finding the most pleasure, but in a mature, long-term sense. Doing coke and sleeping with prositutes won't make me happier, of course - they might do the opposite. Living minimally and kindly just might make me a happier person.    any happiness I may achieve is contaminated by the knowledge that there's nothing necessarily 'good' or 'right' about being happy   As I've studied Buddhism in the past, I try to mindfully detach myself from such judgments and not dwell upon them. They're only depressing if you think they are! So I suppose I've created a disconnect between my abstract conclusions and how I feel about them. They exist in the same category in my mind as the knowledge that we're made of stardust - somewhat interesting to think about abstractly, but ultimately not emotionally impactful, or consequential to my day-to-day life."
Stoicism,37rxve,Sophic_Periphery,5,Mon Jun 1 19:21:20 2015 UTC,"Epictetus would say the meaning/reason of life is to live well in whatever station we find ourselves, not as brute beasts but as a being with a fragment of God, reason to guide our decisions and actions. The meaning of life is to live according to nature."

Stoicism,37rxve,Counter423,5,Mon Jun 1 20:09:02 2015 UTC,"I remember the first time I used LSD, I was sat on my bed going through an incredible journey and I thought ""What is the point in doing anything in life as it's all meaningless anyway?""  I sat there for a few moments, wondering how I could answer this... and then it hit me ""Well, what's the point in not doing anything?""  It was a hilarious, life changing experience and I've tripped various times since and I've come to understand that, fundamentally, our only real aim is survival. Simply 'being' is all we need for purpose :) Everything else is just added. I always feel great when I re-visit these thoughts, as it really put things into perspective."

Because not doing anything would be worse. It's better to work towards goals and make yourself a better person. The alternative is rotting in a nihilistic funk."
Stoicism,37rxve,1PillarBow,2,Sat May 30 03:35:45 2015 UTC,"Oh, I do think that human life requires meaning, just as it requires reason and social connection.  I think this is why screwing with someone's sanity, solitary confinement, and making people do meaningless activities like breaking rocks or moving them around are the three most horrific tortures used in penal systems.  However, if we accept that we are part of the universe that is conscious, reasoned, and social than by experiencing the world, learning about it as best we can from the vantage we are in (regardless of that position) than living well ( virtuously and mindfully ) should supply all the meaning one needs.  From this perspective conscious reason IS meaning, and the more fully employed it is the more meaning one experiences.  Stoicism - to me - is a framework for doing this in any situation.    If life were meaningless, or if meaning were irrelevant than I have no clue how one could be a stoic, as I have no way to figure how virtue could be the sole good, or source/identity of meaning."

Stoicism,37rxve,epicbunty,1 point,Sat May 30 18:07:43 2015 UTC,"I think of these things in the following way:  Everything is meant to follow nature. If we observe nature, we can see that a cat does not question his existence as a cat, or his purpose. He merely is cat, and does as a cat. His entire existence and purpose thus, is to be as ""cat"" as he can be, to hunt, to eat, to sleep so thereforth, until his ""catness"" dissipates e.g. the cat dies.  In the same way, you as a human being, are meant to do the things that a human does - a human works, a human loves, a human eats, creates, solves problems, grows old and dies - all the things according to the things which he finds himself capable of.  If a cat doesn't question his ""catness"", then why would you question your own humanity? You are by very definition human, and so should seek to do, and do well the things that are found within your human capacity. Be as human as you can be, while you can be.   When your humanity is dead, then so too shall your purpose for being, be lost. This is the way of nature.  All things in Nature's creation exist as they are. You are no different."

Stoicism,37rxve,Fart-Ripson,1 point,Sat May 30 07:14:58 2015 UTC,"Epictetus pretty much said we're here for the benefit of the universe, and not ourselves. We have no meaning because our meaning doesn't belong to us. It's like if someone's feet were conscious they'd probably think the only reason they existed was to be attached to and moved around by legs. It's only when you view them from the perspective of the whole body that their purpose is known: to walk. In the same way we're probably the feet to the body of the universe. We're not gonna know."
Stoicism,37rxve,duffstoic,1 point,Sat May 30 10:12:04 2015 UTC,"Just another thing about this part ""It seems like a pretty safe conclusion that the mind sprang from life, and is not a necessary ingredient for it.""  That's pretty arguable if you read idealism. All we really see is our perceptions of the universe. No human has ever seen anything from a non-human perspective. We have no evidence any of these supposed universal rules actually exist, other than that they seem like they do. Some people even doubt life or death is an actual thing. Here's something relevant:  “Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.” -Marcus Aurelius"

After youre done you can finally sit in peace, to conclude that standing wasn't that bad and that the chair either way is made (up) from it's meaningless parts. But the whole is greater than the parts and maybe along the way there started existing something.  Just like surface tension, it stops existing if you take apart the constituents. That doesn't make it completely non-existant."
Stoicism,37rxve,PeaceH,1 point,Sat May 30 17:24:29 2015 UTC,"In his book, The Dance of Life, Havelock Ellis presents living as an art, one best characterized as a dance. In this, he follows the ancient Greeks who chose the image of dancing because, unlike walking or running, dancing is not generally viewed as a goal-oriented activity leading from point A to B. One dances for the sheer joy of the activity. It is the process more than the product that counts. And this is how the good life is to be lived. So, when someone asks, ""What is the purpose of life?"" they should answer, ""Life is not purpose, life is art."" The meaning is found in the doing.  This is a revolutionary and truly unique way of looking at the world. It is a way that finds the question of cosmic purpose irrelevant.  I also find question absurd and unanswerable, as it can only be contemplated from a religious perspective that relates to eternal love or acceptance which is unprovable.  Some Native American beliefs on the purpose of life I have read about were simply that the purpose of life is to create and sustain the next generations life. IOW, the purpose of life is to children.  This actually makes some logical sense.  If you consider evolutionary theory, we have evolved to become conscious beings; so if you believe in a Supernatural conscious creator (God or Spirit), then you could posit that He or She intended for us to evolve into continuously higher intelligence levels through an unbroken chain of millions and billions of generations through random mutations and selective pressures.   If you don't believe in a Supernatural conscious creator, then our purpose is to procreate simply because that is what separates us from non-life matter.   But still that is like saying that the purpose of a stream is to flow.  With the stream there is no flow, and without flow there is no stream, just water; so to assign purpose to something just because it exists is not logical without religion."
Stoicism,37rxve,Counter423,1 point,Sat May 30 22:33:06 2015 UTC,"The first part of your comment on life as an ""art"" very much reminded me of this excellent video. I think there is something to creativity and being human. Life can be described as a ""dance"", though some would disagree. Marcus Aurelius wrote “The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing, in so far as it stands ready against the accidental and the unforeseen, and is not apt to fall.”  I suppose, depending on whether you have a goal in mind (having children) or not, that life is either a ""dance"" or a ""wrestling match"". In reality though, having children is a wrestling match without a goal. There is no point at which your children stop being related to you.   Just looking at the terms used, ""wrestling"" and ""dancing"", they are merely different modes of movement. Whether you are alone or not, there is always something/someone you are dancing/wrestling with. It all depends on if you are striving for something external or internal. So I certainly agree that meaning is ultimately found in the doing.  How broadly did the author use the term ""dancing"" as a metaphor for life?"
Stoicism,37rxve,FuturePrimitive,1 point,Sat May 30 22:41:02 2015 UTC,I learned from Meditations that you are supposed to live from moment to moment in tranquility until you eventually transition from this life to the next.
