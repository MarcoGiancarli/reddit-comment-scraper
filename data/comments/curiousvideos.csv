curiousvideos,3e32kg,zhegames,2,Tue Jul 21 17:26:27 2015 UTC,"i agree with that sentiment, but i think this story's moral was more ""loyalty is subjective, nuanced, and sometimes dogged."" War, in this story, seems to actually have some value, as if a medium for the brothers to display their loyalties and ideals - ancestral heritage or american assimilation. Even the Imperial Japanese veterans would later fight for the US in Korea, again using war as a means of reidentifying themselves.  if the brothers had say, unwittingly dropped bombs on their siblings and killed them in WWII, there would definitely be more of a ""fuck war"" vibe"

I feel ""Academics"" is the pursuit of knowledge, almost for the sake of acquiring it.   And that's fine! There's nothing wrong with having an institution that is dedicated to stockpiling knowledge. If we are unhappy with how universities prepare people for work, we should design a system that was actually intended to do so."

This series covers human augmentation and it will come in 4 parts:    Part 1 (releasing this Friday) will explore the essence of humanity before we start augmenting it Part 2 (releasing the following week etc) will explore physical augmentations of the human body Part 3 will explore mental augmentations  And Part 4 will examine human life extension   If that sounds interesting to you, I hope you'll keep coming back and stay tuned.  Each month I'll explore a new scientific topic with a series of 4 videos.  This video specifically was also a submission to the Big History Project's contest which asks the same question.

It's a very linear thing, and the common chain analogy that we're all familiar with does not hold.  If I'm going from point A to point Z and have to hit all the hops betwixt them, the hardest to pass hop matters the most.    It's a lovely counter intuitive solution and the video was far more interesting than the title let on.    Maybe a castle analogy would be better; your internals may be nigh wide open, but with tall enough walls and a sturdy gate, it matters little barring traiterous elements within.  That said, the weakest link will forever be the users!  Note, not an expert, but this was the conclusion I reached."
