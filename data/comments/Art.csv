Art,3e0ncs,I_would_kill_you,2,Tue Jul 21 11:26:44 2015 UTC,"A ""study"" is a general term for a drawing or painting that is done by looking at reference (real life, or photographic) and attempting to faithfully copy it, usually for the purpose of learning.  Most likely the creator found a picture of Bruce Lee and had it open in one window, then in a separate photoshop window created a ""freehand"" painting while looking at that photo for reference, possibly with the help of measuring guidelines to ensure accuracy.  Generally speaking, most ""digital paintings"" are not edits of photographs, though they may be studies of photographs."

Art,3e2dux,The_Pappy,0,Tue Jul 21 12:54:59 2015 UTC,I love sex!
Art,3e2dux,redskyblueheart,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:48:59 2015 UTC,Wow. I really love this. Texture is really amazing to me. Takes a second for my eye to figure the thumbnail even. What do you mean where do you go from here?
Art,3e2dux,redskyblueheart,2,Tue Jul 21 13:49:52 2015 UTC,Thank you very much! That was just my way of asking for feedback / constructive criticism / things to keep in mind in the future.
Art,3e2rpb,JoshByer,2,Tue Jul 21 14:48:24 2015 UTC,"Awesome, as always!"
Art,3e2rpb,matta_av_tras,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:18:44 2015 UTC,What's this style of art called?

Art,3e3hk9,swimlab,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:50:54 2015 UTC,"Why not start with a reverse image search?  https://images.google.com , click on the camera icon, upload the picture.  You'll probably want to crop it first so it only includes the art itself, or take a better picture.  You might find similar styles.  Without a signature, though, it's going to be almost impossible to verify, even if it is a well-known artist."
Art,3e2qm3,thedeadmann,2,Tue Jul 21 14:39:47 2015 UTC,Not sure if I agree really....Thoughts?
Art,3e2qm3,TheSemenArsonist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:40:11 2015 UTC,she sounds about as authentic as the things she rails against imo
Art,3e2qm3,bmc1010,2,Tue Jul 21 14:58:06 2015 UTC,"interesting... some of the stuff I agree with, such as ""We can hope the next cycle will be anticorporate. Corporations have won – your worth is based on what you make, not what you do or what you say.""  But it's kind of hard to take the original quote seriously when she spends half the interview talking about being a world travler.  Not even getting into the fact that that mind set is a huge part of the problem that artistic types are in now, where it's next to impossible to earn a living wage and are constantly hit up (and willing to give, wtf) for free or way under priced art."
Art,3e2qm3,should_not_ever,2,Tue Jul 21 15:40:25 2015 UTC,It is a very commercialized statement. Self promotion to make money through selling herself as an artist?
Art,3e2qm3,TemptThePuffin,2,Tue Jul 21 18:26:15 2015 UTC,"Druggie (I tried crack five times) Thief (who got her name because she used to steal food) Product doesn't sell (If you’re doing it for the money, you’re not doing art.)    selling herself as an artist?   Doesn't this sound more like narcissist?   she’s even been homeless at points in her career.    Color me surprised."
