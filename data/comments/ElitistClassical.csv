ElitistClassical,3e5b6i,electricbath,3,Wed Jul 22 01:55:16 2015 UTC,"A note about this piece:  The piece bears the inscription that  ""In order to play the theme 840 times in succession, it would be advisable to prepare oneself beforehand, and in the deepest silence, by serious immobilities"". Does that mean to repeat it 840 times or was Satie just being cheeky?   Some performers attempt to repeat it 840 times, others for a fixed time period, and others just repeat it until they are frustrated and sick of it. During my sophomore year at college, a very ambitious young musician (with the help of some friends) performed it for 6 hours. I sat in on it for a good half an hour before my ears started to resent it.   But don't take my word for it, give it a listen and see what you think.  *Edit: also, a link to the score might be nice while listening."
ElitistClassical,3e5b6i,Chanz,3,Wed Jul 22 02:03:45 2015 UTC,I played for 30 minutes of a 24 hour rotation. Was maddening.
ElitistClassical,3e5xcc,bresnahancomposer,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:11:38 2015 UTC,One of the greatest pieces written for the trombone. I never get tired of hearing it or performing it.

ElitistClassical,3dih1l,i_am_from_cleveland,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:53:50 2015 UTC,"Performing this work is almost as bad as listening to it in its entirety. Don't get me wrong, it has it's moments of clarity and life; But relative to its size, those moments seem so few and far between. I like a bleeding heart romanticized work as much as the next guy, but by the end of Bruckner I always feel like my brain is numb from being so overindulged in sound. Just my personal opinion though!"
ElitistClassical,3dih1l,ScoliosisJones,5,Fri Jul 17 05:47:48 2015 UTC,"I find the divide on Bruckner to be fascinating. I for one love Bruckner. In some ways, I love him for all the reasons you dislike him. His reluctance to just get on with it appeals to me. Idk why. He isn't as clean or concise, but I find that the technique helps up the drama.  I totally get why people don't like him.  Edit: It should be noted that I am a low brass player, which inevitably colors my opinion on him. He has written some awesome low brass parts that I take great joy in playing."

ElitistClassical,3dh63k,_noiresque_,2,Sun Jul 19 01:48:51 2015 UTC,"I definitely would recommend the film especially if you've read the graphic novel.  If you see it, let me know what you're think. Hope you enjoy it!"

ElitistClassical,3ddh9y,pornfkennedy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:20:07 2015 UTC,How does this piece utilize forms of Classical Indian music? Is part 1 an Alap and part 2 Gat? Is the music derived from a raga?

ElitistClassical,3dbfmd,_wsgeorge,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:44:23 2015 UTC,"Lyatoshinsky's one of so so many fascinating composers who came up writing in the USSR's avant-garde 1920s and remained quite interesting under the tighter artistic strictures that characterized Soviet music during the Stalin years (i.e. with some, like Mosolov, the change was more shattering). I especially enjoy those expressionistic post-Scriabin-esque (for lack of a better term) piano works from the 1920s and what I've heard of his four string quartets (the first being his first work with an opus number and the last representing his more conservative later work). Thanks for sharing."

ElitistClassical,3d177i,i_am_from_cleveland,2,Mon Jul 13 09:05:04 2015 UTC,Probably quite well known... but I always think it's one of the nicest bits in the opera (and not something people who haven't seen/listened to the whole thing would necessarily have heard)
ElitistClassical,3d177i,AerateMark,3,Sun Jul 12 17:54:07 2015 UTC,Don't worry about this being too well known.  That rule really only applies to obvious spam like Rite of Spring or Beethoven 5.  This is a great submission!

ElitistClassical,3d177i,AerateMark,2,Wed Jul 15 17:24:19 2015 UTC,"Gorgeous! Liszt did a nice piano version and Lucien Cailliet's transcription ""Elsa's Procession to the Cathedral"" is a cornerstone of wind band literature. Comically, I thought it was a funeral hymn because of the name and the fact that we used to play it so slowly in high school band."
ElitistClassical,3d0a5t,SBookman,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:12:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing. As a enthusiast/collector of art music from the former Soviet territories, it's nice to see any works from that corner of the world getting attention. Not much of Shaverzashvili's work is available to listen to, but I have greatly enjoyed the few works I have encountered, and know he taught other Georgian composers whose work I enjoy (Azarashvili, Kvernadze). This Youtube channel has recordings of his piano quintet and three piano trios, all very nice works, especially the third one from the late 1970s, which has some zesty folk-inspired elements:  https://www.youtube.com/user/RamShemqmnaAdamianad/search?query=shaverzashvili  As an enthusiast of piano writing from that era/region, I do know he's one of the zillion Soviet-era composers who penned a set of 24 preludes, though I've not yet succeeded in locating a copy."
