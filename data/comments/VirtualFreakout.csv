He can do these really fucking weird loud rants about things that he knows stuff about (MLP, Minecraft), and get hits on youtube.  Also, he can do it when his parents are at work, so that's a bonus for him while summer is going on.

VirtualFreakout,3c8uhr,motnorote,3,Mon Jul 6 04:42:43 2015 UTC,People take the skins from CSGO and essentially put them up for a bet.  Guns / Knives are assigned a numerical value.  Depending on the value of what you are putting up the higher the chances of winning said pot pool.  The dollar equivalent is what I believe is taking directly from the steam market market price.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.  Pretty basic explanation.
VirtualFreakout,3c8uhr,patriot945,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:04:29 2015 UTC,"Basically, there are websites that also allow you to trade the skins for real money and goods or a mix of real stuff and in-game skins.  Similar to cards in TCG's the price of a skin depends on how many are currently in circulation."

VirtualFreakout,3c8uhr,its_Gur,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:46:15 2015 UTC,no it would be a combination of skins that are worth 7k usd that he lost
VirtualFreakout,3c8uhr,blackhole885,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:08:41 2015 UTC,So pretty much you CAN trade those skins for real money... not for as much as is the market price on steam/trading price but not too far off so its a shit ton of money
VirtualFreakout,3c8uhr,Bob_Lorincz,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:25:58 2015 UTC,"Well actually you can get higher prices if you don't sell it via the market. When you sell on the market, you can't sell higher than $400 and Steam also takes a percentage.   But selling elsewhere on the web can net you thousands of dollars for a single skin.  Here is a knife that sold for $23,850 (the period in the screenshot price is supposed to be a comma)"

VirtualFreakout,3c0b75,Peterod,-16,Sat Jul 4 06:17:24 2015 UTC,"I got really uncomfortable watching that. A bit too touchy this mom, like she is stroking his back. As others in youtube said, i get strange vibes. Especially because he didnt want/ask for it, she just forced the touching on him. And hes already starting puberty, where moms should stop this.   Aside from that, really cringy for him being exposed like that too the stream. Parents should stay informed of modern trends like ""streaming"" if they want to understand their children."
VirtualFreakout,3c0b75,Brandwein,11,Fri Jul 3 19:51:44 2015 UTC,That was what she was trying to do... By asking questions and staying on top of what he was doing. We don't know if she went afterwards and googled it because this was new to her.
VirtualFreakout,3c0b75,Belvgor,12,Fri Jul 3 19:04:05 2015 UTC,You get uncomfortable when your mom touches your back? Were you touched as a child perhaps?
VirtualFreakout,3c0b75,Brandwein,-4,Fri Jul 3 23:59:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, but only when i was comfortable with hugs/etc, not when i was cleary not in the mood like this boy.  And as a boy age 12-16 its hella more uncomfortable. In that phase, when you are ""cool"" and dont want to be seen as a mommas-boy, it is normal to build distance from the mother.   When you get to adolescence it is completely normal to be close to your parents again."
VirtualFreakout,3c0b75,Belvgor,5,Fri Jul 3 21:54:25 2015 UTC,I think you're reading too much into her body language man.  The way she rubbed his back was pretty normal for a parent with their kid.  It was overly invasive or sexual at all but you're finding things that aren't there.
VirtualFreakout,3c0b75,Lutraphobic,-2,Fri Jul 3 22:33:04 2015 UTC,"Could be either way, that was just my first perception. Im not sure i am correct, thats just how i saw it.  Maybe because of different upbringing. My mother always asked me ""can i hug you?"" before she did since i was adolescent, and i appreciate this.  (Or doing it when i also showed open accepting body language like outstretched arms ready to hug ec.)   Just 'taking' the interaction without consent seems pretty invasive to me, maybe not to others. For me, he clearly showed her how uncomfortable he was with the situation."
VirtualFreakout,3c0b75,eDgEIN708,2,Mon Jul 6 06:37:54 2015 UTC,I can see your reasoning and I'm not going to say that I am right but I guess it is just different for everyone and we would have to know how he is normally with her.  I mean I love my mom but I know if I was his age and streaming a game to people I'd probably be acting super uncomfortable too.

VirtualFreakout,37gw26,Batwaffel,1 point,Wed May 27 16:14:56 2015 UTC,"I used to have fun in SL.   Learned some coding (SL has a scripting language similar to Java that drives the more complex objects), building of objects, modelling etc.  Made a few friends too, some of which I still keep in touch with.  But it is true though, that a vast majority take it waaaay too serious and treat it like an actual real world."
VirtualFreakout,37gw26,impablomations,2,Wed May 27 16:46:17 2015 UTC,I use to play on SL a bit. Mostly to listen to DJs and be introduced to new music since I have a very eclectic taste in what I personally listen to. It was interesting but I felt like I was in grade school from all the drama. Worst part was these were mainly adults over 30 causing it. I eventually left because I was tired of hearing grownups whine or do exactly what this person in the video is doing.

If their profile is full of BS like  ""this is my family, fuck with them and you fuck with the kitty"", or ""I'm a bitch, if you don't like it then GTFO"" - you know the type of profiles I mean - then I kept anyone like that at arms length.  They were generally the ones who took it way too seriously and spent every waking moment in SL.  I had a small business selling pets with rudimentary AI for a while. It was fun learning the coding and gave me a little extra cash every month.  Had a small chain of clothing stores too.  It was fun while it lasted - but these days it seems to be almost completely made up of sexually frustrated housewives 'married' to someone on the other side of the world who choose to use SL to escape their boring marriages."

VirtualFreakout,34s1jh,EdgHG,3,Tue May 5 17:58:38 2015 UTC,Am I supposed to know who this is?
VirtualFreakout,34s1jh,Dezuuu,6,Tue May 5 22:01:37 2015 UTC,Any time they do fucked up Friday there is some sort of argument between someone and it gets really awkward to watch.
VirtualFreakout,34s1jh,blinKX10,1 point,Mon May 4 14:11:35 2015 UTC,Why watch this retarded crap? This is pure unadulterated cancer.
VirtualFreakout,34s1jh,Sporocarp,2,Wed May 6 22:48:34 2015 UTC,Precisely why I stopped
VirtualFreakout,34s1jh,blinKX10,2,Wed May 6 23:17:11 2015 UTC,Is this the dude who flipped out at Darkest Dungeon a few weeks ago?
VirtualFreakout,34s1jh,myr4raccountprobably,2,Mon May 4 18:26:15 2015 UTC,There's enough ill-will and aggression in this video to sustain a dark wizard for 10 years
VirtualFreakout,34s1jh,Johnnyb3Good,2,Wed May 6 17:38:33 2015 UTC,And this is why I don't watch over grown man children and their friends fumble through video games.
VirtualFreakout,34s1jh,AllSeeingGoatWizard,2,Sat May 9 19:39:16 2015 UTC,"Why are guys like this getting sub buttons on twitch when good quality entertaining people work so hard for a shot at it, and get zero recognition"
VirtualFreakout,34s1jh,Shafraz12,1 point,Tue May 12 11:02:47 2015 UTC,Anyone remember wiihaveaproblem.com back in the day. That was some funny shit for monitor breakages
VirtualFreakout,34s1jh,Desther,-1,Tue May 5 17:16:21 2015 UTC,Im sorry but this guy have problems. When you're are old enough you learn to let it go. Just enjoy and try to lear some things if you cant. You cant be mad at the game or the people who you're playing. We're not super good on all the games. It's crazy. I think he is faking it sometimes but i don't know.
VirtualFreakout,34s1jh,UselessIdeas,-8,Mon May 4 20:05:27 2015 UTC,"The two younger people were definitely acting and speaking to him in a fairly douchy way and not listening at all, but seriously turn the shit off if you are so pissed. How do you think punching a display is going to work out."
VirtualFreakout,34jt54,maxturbomatthew396,10,Fri May 1 19:32:23 2015 UTC,"Bashurs ""current"" girlfriend, Clara, was just exposed for being a gold digger. Here is how he found out.   Honestly, I feel for the guy. That said, I think he has some emotional maturing to do and is a little over-dramatic."
VirtualFreakout,34jt54,ahicks88,4,Fri May 1 23:59:39 2015 UTC,Backstory?
VirtualFreakout,34jt54,Vayne13,8,Fri May 1 23:00:04 2015 UTC,He was accused of being a kiddie fiddler and  people were harassing him because of it
VirtualFreakout,34jt54,blinKX10,2,Fri May 1 23:38:39 2015 UTC,I got that from the video but how did it all start?

VirtualFreakout,34jt54,Chicken_McFaggots,14,Fri May 1 20:29:19 2015 UTC,wtf drama escalation
VirtualFreakout,34jt54,thekeanu,7,Fri May 1 22:38:31 2015 UTC,Who are these people?
VirtualFreakout,34jt54,LiteralHiggs,2,Sat May 2 00:27:50 2015 UTC,"Keemstar, he was originally a funny Halo 3 guy, who slowly escalated to numerous games. He's the one on the screen."
VirtualFreakout,34jt54,SketchyJJ,4,Sat May 2 00:29:26 2015 UTC,"The guy on the phone, the girl and her new boyfriend are video game streamers too?"
VirtualFreakout,34jt54,LiteralHiggs,2,Sat May 2 00:35:24 2015 UTC,"I don't know about the new BF, but yes, the guy on phone(Bashurverse) and the girl(Carly BabyLegs) are streamers/letsplayers/etc"
VirtualFreakout,34jt54,SketchyJJ,16,Sat May 2 00:37:12 2015 UTC,I really dislike that guy in the video. He tries to make a situation like this humorous. That popcorn shit was a dick move.
VirtualFreakout,34jt54,ShawnWilson000,6,Fri May 1 23:56:01 2015 UTC,The guy's entire channel is airing other peoples misfortune. He turns twitter into HS. The guy and his channel are cancer.
VirtualFreakout,34jt54,Batmaus,0,Sun May 3 13:42:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the situation was pretty fucked up, but sometimes people try to react to bad situations with humor to lighten things up, granted the popcorn was a bit of a dick move, but I'd try to enjoy myself in a bad situation as well."
VirtualFreakout,34jt54,SketchyJJ,3,Sat May 2 11:37:43 2015 UTC,Why would bashur go on this show when this was the guy leading the charge against him and his criminal history?
VirtualFreakout,34jt54,anon2413,4,Sat May 2 12:59:56 2015 UTC,Damn thats monstrously cruel. I hope he does everything he possibly can to bury her. How despicably sociopathic.
VirtualFreakout,34jt54,Boltarrow5,-1,Sat May 2 14:13:55 2015 UTC,"God, that host is a douche. How could he do this to this poor guy live?  This is really not cool. Have someone mental breakdown on live stream for views? What the fuck is wrong with people."
VirtualFreakout,34jt54,aBagofLobsters,0,Sat May 2 00:31:28 2015 UTC,"Support him? Hell, Im surprised she lasted that long. Shes allowed to see other people after breakups.  Edit: Well, she is a bitch for taking money and screwing him around. Still don't feel all that sorry for him though. Should have seen it coming, you don't date fans. Wise up, hes old enough that he should know better. Hopefully hes learned something from it all."
VirtualFreakout,34jt54,Reddit1990,5,Tue May 5 16:24:44 2015 UTC,"I was never aware of this guy til now, but I actually feel really bad for him. He's a perfect example of how youtube fame could become a total curse for a sensitive person."
VirtualFreakout,34jt54,ToastThing,2,Sat May 2 10:52:13 2015 UTC,"It's going to be interesting after he stops making money from youtube eventually and has to find a regular job. Shit happens and every freaks out sometimes. Normal people don't take videos of it and post it online, though. Ffs, how can this guy be 29?"
VirtualFreakout,34jt54,CommodorePython,2,Sat May 2 18:39:14 2015 UTC,Poor guy.
VirtualFreakout,34jt54,ranktwo,2,Sat May 2 00:10:45 2015 UTC,"It's gone, anyone have a link?"
VirtualFreakout,34jt54,xxDEVOLAxx,1 point,Sat May 2 07:13:58 2015 UTC,How do these people make a living? Is there that much money in ad revenue for a youtube channel?
VirtualFreakout,34jt54,nicodiumus,2,Tue May 5 23:27:58 2015 UTC,yes
VirtualFreakout,34jt54,Shitty_Bollocks,-3,Sat May 16 06:20:46 2015 UTC,"This only has 300,000 views, so he probably has made $10 off of it."
