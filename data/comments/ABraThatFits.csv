ABraThatFits,3e4nwe,daisyprincesss,3,Tue Jul 21 22:46:19 2015 UTC,"It depends, I think. Padded moulded bras tend to be shallow, so you may find that you need to size up to make them work if you aren't shallow.   If the shape doesn't work very well on the two bras you just ordered, maybe the Fantasie Smoothing T-shirt Bra (4510) would work? I think it's supposed to be similar to Fantasie Esme."
ABraThatFits,3e4nwe,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:59:15 2015 UTC,The Fantasie 4510 is my only moulded t-shirt bra and interestingly enough it is a cup size (30DD) smaller than my usual soft cup bras (30E). Not quite sure what that means? I am also unsure how to go about purchasing moulded bras online and figuring out what would fit.
ABraThatFits,3e4nwe,theingenue,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:43:40 2015 UTC,"4510 runs large, so that would explain why you need 30DD instead of 30E."

I ordered a bra from them, and after a month had received no notification indicating that it had been shipped.  I sent 3 freaking emails over the course of nearly 2 weeks and received 0 response.  Every post I've read in this subreddit  regarding their communication has mentioned from someone stating ""perhaps it was sent to junkmail?"" I call bullshit, I honestly think that they don't check their email.  If you send them a facebook message they'll respond. They did when I sent a message about my order.  Turns out they were waiting for fabric from their supplier, and the eta for its arrival was 6 more weeks.. But they said it could very well be even longer than that. Why they didn't bother communicating that to the people who handed over money to them is beyond me.  I cancelled my order and won't be using them again.  edit words are not my friend today."

On their site the bras that are listed are said to be available  for purchase in August, since they are waiting for their fabric to come in. The reason why I emailed them was to ask if I could receive my bras on a specific day of the week when I am home alone and do not have to deal with my parents asking me  why I have purchased more bras. I do pay for them with my own money, however i know my mother will ask me what size they are and I donot feel like explaining to her about properly fitting bras  ect..."

I ordered something from their sale section and just wanted to confirm some details. I chalked it up to them also being on holiday like Comexim. But you're right, it would have been nice if they put a similar notice on the website. The only thing indicating a delay is them saying they ran out of fabric. I didn't know running out of fabric also meant lacking in customer service. Kind of makes me not want to order from them again in the future. I've had Anna from Comexim respond to me in less than 48 hours and I would imagine she's much busier with having to deal with retail accounts as well as consumers directly. I just couldn't resist the great price they had, but I think next time I'm going to stick to ordering from Anna."

Based on your measurements I'm inclined to think that 40HH is a good place to start.  I think Elomi would be a good brand for you, being wide, relatively projected, and FoB. Caitlyn is a fantastic starter bra, and Amazon has tons of other Elomi bras in your size range too."

I looked at the pictures and can't translate that to my head. I'll take a look again to see if I can figure it out.
ABraThatFits,3e3qb7,hurrrrrmione,3,Wed Jul 22 02:14:14 2015 UTC,"You can test for fullness by leaning over at a 90Â° angle in front of a mirror. If your nipples are more towards your head, that's full-on-bottom. If they are more towards your feet, that's full-on-top. If they point straight at the ground/are in the middle of your breast, that's even.  If you don't have a mirror where you can do this, you can try supporting your breasts in your hands as if your hands were a bra. If your nipples are on the top side of your breasts, that's full-on-bottom. If they are on the underside, that's full-on-top. If they point straight out/are in the middle of your breast, that's even."

My measurements come up as 32E based on the calculator, but I can't figure out which style of bra is best. These are the closest I've gotten to a band fitting properly, ever. But the cups are off.   In order I've got on a Cleo Jude, a Cleo Neve (both in 32E), and then a Calvin Klein t-shirt bra in 32DD.  All three move funny in the cups and there is gaping. Clearly I'm not wearing the right cup style but any suggestion for the proper kind would be amazing!"

ABraThatFits,3e3qb7,GeeEmPee,0,Wed Jul 22 02:14:31 2015 UTC,These look the wrong shape for you. Molded cups can be a tricky fit and don't work for all breast shapes - they just might not be right for you.   Are you scooping and swooping?
ABraThatFits,3e3qb7,thisis4reddit,4,Tue Jul 21 21:59:30 2015 UTC,That makes sense. I'm just used to wearing molded cups. I'd like something with a little padding and that's where I've tended to find that.
ABraThatFits,3e3i6e,jetblackwings,3,Tue Jul 21 17:55:20 2015 UTC,"At this point, I'm not sure what to recommend in a moulded-type bra for 40C/D--would you mind posting your five measurements, per the Beginner's Guide on the sidebar? Knowing the measurements helps with recommendations, as does information about shape.  I would, however, strongly advise against ordering the Maddie in an even smaller size than what you have. It will be too small. The gores in Cleo bras tend to tack firmly, so that is to be expected but you won't get a good fit out of this bra. In general, however, you want the gore to tack to your sternum but not to be painful; however problems with gores rubbing are very common."
ABraThatFits,3e3i6e,Goddess_Keira,2,Tue Jul 21 18:32:48 2015 UTC,"Sure, sorry I didn't put up measurements right away. Here are the measurements (if I should post a new thread with these, I'm happy to).  Under 1: 39.5"" Under 2 (tight): 37"" Standing: 42"" Leaning: 44.5"" Laying down: 44.5""  Size recommendations: 40 C/D; Sisters 42 B/C, 38 D/DD.  I used to wear a 38C (Victoria's Secret, Target, all manner of cheap torture device), but I had a baby in the fall, so my cup size went up somewhat, as did my band width. I am also definitely migrated, and can't wait to find a well fitting bra so that I can try this miracle ""swoop and scoop"" thing."
ABraThatFits,3e4rd8,aec1991,3,Tue Jul 21 23:13:07 2015 UTC,The calculator has been sister-sizing down unnecessarily lately. A 26 band will almost certainly be too tight and only 3 companies that I know of make them anyway. I'm getting 28E/F or 30DD/E.   The 32D bras most likely feel too tight in the band because the cups are too small and your breast tissue is partially in the band as a result. Try putting all your bras on upside-down and backwards and see how the bands feel.
ABraThatFits,3e4rd8,hurrrrrmione,2,Tue Jul 21 23:35:16 2015 UTC,"Put the bra on upside down and backwards (hooks right under where the gore usually sits & the cups hanging down your back, no straps). When the cup is too small, the band can feel too small too. Let me know what happens to the bra. Does it slide down and become a belt? If so, your band is too loose. A 24 band would not be ideal because it is SMALLER than your tight measurement. Naturally, you'll want to be able to breathe. So you're left with a 26 or 28 band. 26 bands are a bit harder to find so you might want to use that as your last resort if 28 bands are too big for you. Given that your underbust measurement is 28.25"" though, I think 28 would be your band band size.  Now, your bust. Given your/our size range, the leaning bust is most accurate as most people in this size range are shallow. That means a 6-6.5"" difference between your underbust and leaning bust. This will put us at an E or F cup.   Size: 28 E/F  Given that you're wearing a 30DD/32D, I'm going to guess that you're not very shallow. A 30DD bra has the same volume as a 28E bra so I think you're on the right path. If you're popping out of VS and B.Tempt'd (shallow brands) then that also reaffirms my ""not shallow"" idea. Note though, that shallowness is a spectrum. It's not just the extremes (shallow vs. projected)."

ABraThatFits,3e3bar,margaret3lizabeth,3,Tue Jul 21 17:08:44 2015 UTC,"Jude is too shallow for you, which is why there's a bunch of space between the underwire and your IMF. If you like it for specific t-shirt bra purposes, go ahead, but be aware that the underwire should sit directly under your breast in a well-fitting bra.  Izzy is too small, and seems like it might be a shape mismatch (likely too much room in the top) in a larger size. Because it's too small, it is also too narrow.  I think Lily looks pretty good. Possibly a bit too narrow. The band rolling up is probably normal and just has to do with your posture.  Have you tried any Panache bras such as Jasmine or Andorra?  Could we get your measurements, shape, and projection please? That will help with recommendations if you want some."
ABraThatFits,3e3bar,M_tridactyla,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:04:53 2015 UTC,"I havent tried any Panache bras yet, they are next on my list to try.    My measurements are:  Snug: 34.5  Tight: 33  Standing: 40  Leaning: 42  Lying: 41"
ABraThatFits,3e3bar,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Tue Jul 21 21:00:12 2015 UTC,"Jude is too shallow, you've got some buckling at the bottom of the cup. The wires are too low, but I'm pretty sure you wouldn't be able to get them any higher into your IMF. This bra is a weird one, and very few people fit the shape, which is why there are still so many left online even though it's been discontinued for over two years. So don't worry about disliking it!  Lily, on the other hand, seems a bit too narrow and projected for you. You've got some mild orange in a glass happening - the wires are too narrow to let all of your breast tissue fill the cups, causing gaping at the apex and the top. However, I think this cup volume works for you, you just need a different shape.  The Izzy is definitely too small. The underarm pooch you're getting seems like breast tissue that's leaking out the sides and your right breast is quadboobing slightly.   I think Fantasie bras might work well for you, as they're wider and not quite as projected. As far as tissue migration goes, it's different for everyone. It's really not possible to predict how much migration will happen, if you get any at all. Some people don't experience tissue migration. Others have reported going up a cup size within a week or two - or over a period of months. Yet another option is that you'll have some ""tissue redistribution"", changing your shape a bit but not changing your size. I honestly haven't seen many people need a whole new set of bras once tissue migration happens, so I wouldn't worry about it too much!"

ABraThatFits,3e3bar,lcl0706,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:01:53 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say that you're particularly wide - more like average. Lily is one of the narrowest bras on the UK market.

It might be worth trying this in a cup up, but it's Brastop so that might be a bit annoying to do.  I think the 30 bands will be more comfortable once you go up a size. You look like a good fit for Cleo Marcie and Freya Starlet, too."
ABraThatFits,3e2vna,khasiv,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:23:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestions! ELI5 orange in a glass?
ABraThatFits,3e2vna,khasiv,5,Tue Jul 21 15:26:27 2015 UTC,The wires are too narrow so you get gapping. You can see on the side that the wires are kind of pinching your side. With wider wires the bra would be further back and the top is more likely to be flush with your breast on the top.
ABraThatFits,3e2vna,lcl0706,4,Tue Jul 21 15:29:35 2015 UTC,"UK ""padded"" is not the same as the American padded we're used to, where there's layers of padding and push up.  Padded to the UK brands means it's lined, or softly shaped so it's not totally shapeless, sheer, or unlined, but it's not padded as we think of padded i.e. Victoria's Secret padded.  Molded - now that's more like the VS style cups, where it's seamless (tee shirt bra) and shaped by a heat mold, and the cups are usually thicker and stiffer.  But there's not a lot of true push-up bras manufactured by UK brands.  I'd go up to a 30DD on both of these.  The shape isn't bad.  You should get along well with Freya and Fauve's half cups, just in the correct size.  I'd say you're averagely projected, maybe a bit more so than a lot of people in your size range and I wouldn't call your roots wide on the sides, but that Fauve is too narrow.  Going up a cup size should solve that.  You're neither extremely FOB or FOT, you look pretty evenly full to me with neither overly tall or short roots.  And you don't look particularly close or wide set in the middle.  Once you find the size and brand that works best for you, you should get along well with a good variety of cuts - like plunge, balconette, etc."
ABraThatFits,3e2vna,lcl0706,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:17:10 2015 UTC,"Very informative, thank you!

Since Im here, I'll talk about the policies as far as online shopping/returns.   -You can earn Kohls Cash on anything, and use it on anything. However, say you buy a bra with your KC and then return it, you don't get that KC back. Id say buy some full price(No coupons, Ill explain in a bit), and return to the store that way. You can also mail stuff back like Amazon if there isn't a physical store near you.  -Anything you buy online can be returned at any store, just bring in a receipt(If you have a charge card, we don't needs this.) I say bring a receipt because a, better safe than sorry, and b, depending on how you paid, you may only get store credit as opposed to the money going back on your card. We pretty much have a no bars return policy, we'll take it back regardless of what store you buy it at, or online.  -If you have a Kohls Charge, you can use the scratch offs (the 10/15/30% off) on the bras. The only exceptions to this rule are what we call Prestiege Brands. Think Nike, KitchenAid, Fitbit, etc, those big guys who don't want you to use your discounts. Policy states we have to disclose these brands, and no where on these bras do I see them being labeled as such. Therefore, discounts galore!!  I generally frown upon my store as far as the lingerie, because we have a Hanes rep who comes in and measures and does the dreaded 'across the bust +3 measurements'. They tried to fit me into a DDD, when I'm actually GG. She wouldn't believe me until I actually put her bra suggestion on! But to see these come up now makes me SUPER happy!

It can be reliably found in brick and mortar stores (Kohls, Macys, Target) as well as online (Amazon, OneHanesPlace) for ~20$US.

ABraThatFits,3e22lj,ShereenMasiha,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:36:46 2015 UTC,"If you like the Deco, that's awesome! I'd recommend trying to get another one in 32G so you won't have to start on the tightest hooks.  The Deco and Ruffle My Feathers are kind of opposite in shape; in this size range the Deco is relatively wide and open on top (good for FoT/even shapes), and Ruffle My Feathers is relatively narrow and suited for FoB breasts. It was probably making your boobs hang awkwardly because there was a lot more space in the bottom of the cup."
ABraThatFits,3e22lj,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:25:31 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll try a 32G and see how that works.  Do you have any recommendations for bras with a similar fit to deco?
ABraThatFits,3e22lj,lasercows,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:33:27 2015 UTC,You can buy some Rixie clips for the Deco so you can tighten the band more once it starts to loosen.
ABraThatFits,3e22lj,lasercows,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:17:58 2015 UTC,"I had looked into rixie clips, but they've got fairly mixed reviews. Have you found then useful?"
ABraThatFits,3e0orr,cinnamongoose,7,Tue Jul 21 01:35:14 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go bigger than a 32 band.  It might have felt tight because you're used to looser, but your measurements indeed suggest 32E or 30F and a 34 just isn't going to provide enough support.  Were you checking to make sure the underwires were all the way up in your IMF, as far as you can get them?  I ask because you call yourself projected, which is most commonly accurate in your size range, but the Natori Feathers is a very very shallow bra, and would not be a good fit on a projected person.  In fact, with the exception of the Panache Andorra, it looks like the entire list of bras you tried are shallow - and that can definitely cause all sorts of fit issues on a projected set of boobs including wrinkling and gapping in the bottoms and tops of the cups.  If some gores weren't fully tacking, that's also an indication the cups were either too small or too shallow or both.  Everything at Nordstroms you can find online on Amazon, and most with Prime shipping, and usually much cheaper.  How do you think your root width is, on the sides?  Generally the first bras suggested around here are Andorra, Jasmine, and/or Floris by Panache, and Cleo's Lucy, Marcie, and Lily/Erin.  All are unlined - Lily will show up the least under a shirt but it's also the narrowest in terms of wire width.  All will allow more space for immediate projection at the bottom of the cup than any of the bras you listed above.  If you can track down any of those on Amazon with free shipping and returns, try them on, and post a fit check with your notes and pics if you're comfortable, it will help determine your shape and what direction to take going forward!  Start with 32E, trust me."
ABraThatFits,3e0orr,lcl0706,2,Tue Jul 21 03:34:54 2015 UTC,"Nice, but a little tight in the band   if it's really 'a little' and everything else is ok, I'd suggest buying it: the band stretches in a couple of days wearing (and these days you may use an extender if it hurts)."
ABraThatFits,3e0orr,yellkaa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:55:23 2015 UTC,"Possibly a stupid question but for me it makes all the difference: are you doing the swoop & scoop? Your measurements sound a lot like mine and I feel best in a size 30 band. Scoop & Swoop might also account for the ""extra space"" in your other bra cups."
ABraThatFits,3e0orr,Kaywin,0,Tue Jul 21 19:33:53 2015 UTC,"From fitting friends, I found that a gap near the gore usually means you need to size down the band. Did you manage to try a 28FF just to see? I'd also recommend trying plunges (or balconettes, but I'm not a huge fan of those.) if you are having space on top."
ABraThatFits,3e1sos,yellkaa,5,Tue Jul 21 08:19:17 2015 UTC,"So, there isn't necessarily a particular type of bra that caters to conical breasts. You want to look for something that has lots of projection at the wire, and don't be surprised if she ends up having to size down a cup from what she measures as -- that's pretty typical. I would look for unlined balconettes with a three-part construction, something that might look like a Cleo Marcie. It would also be worth trying something with vertical seams only to allow for the openness on top, especially if she has tall roots. Something akin to a Freya Patsy would be good there.   It's going to be trial and error no matter how you slice it. No bra style or type is universal enough to recommend without knowing exact information about the brand. I would definitely avoid molded cups. They're probably not going to have near enough projection right at the wire to accommodate conical-style projection without buckling."
ABraThatFits,3e1sos,cupcakery,2,Tue Jul 21 12:31:16 2015 UTC,"Balconnettes, which is like the vaguest term ever, tend to be a good bet. In 32D I would recommend Natori Feathers. She'd also probably be a good fit for several VS bras. Also, anything with vertical seams is likely to work. Full cups will probably be unlikely to work, although if you went the Amazon route Panache Andorra might be worth a try, or it might be too deep."

So a 28D has less volume than a 30D, 32D, 34D, etc. A D cup is also much smaller than most people think and than society/media leads us to believe. I measure at halfway between 32FF and 32G and my breasts are fairly proportional.   Here's photos of women wearing properly fitted 28D bras and here's photos of women wearing properly fitted 28DD bras. Hopefully that looks similar to you! :)  Places you can shop online for bras in this size range include Amazon, HerRoom.com, Figleaves.com, Brastop.com, and ebay.co.uk.

A 30C is one cup volume down from that VS 32C bra you have, which looks big enough in the cups but is likely way too big in the band.  I would suggest re-trying these Aerie bras in a 30D, or trying something else in a 28DD - possibly a few of the Cleo unlined bras like Lucy, Marcie, or Lily although go for them quick since they're discontinuing that size in those bras.  Or Cleo Juna in a 28DD - I bet that would work well for you.  Yes, I'd say you are shallow, btw."

It doesn't come in 28 band size, unfortunately, but you could try it in 30D. You may have to do it up on the inner hooks, but there's a good chance it will fit well in the cups.

ABraThatFits,3dzo8d,SlippingStar,4,Mon Jul 20 20:52:14 2015 UTC,"Based on your lying measurement, I get 30FF, so you may want to start there unless you're particularly interested in a 28 band. I'm guessing you swoop and scoop at least a bit, in order to get the underwires into your inframammary fold. That is where they're supposed to go, but they aren't staying there because the bras you have now are too small and shallow for you.   Since you say that your band size is mostly rib, I'm inclined to think that you have narrow breasts. Is all the breast tissue is on the front of your ribcage, with no ""side boob"" or ""armpit boob""? I think you most likely also have projected breasts.  I would recommend starting with Cleo Erin in 30FF (and 30G, if you can afford to get it in two sizes)."

ABraThatFits,3e0yfm,hurrrrrmione,2,Tue Jul 21 15:35:51 2015 UTC,Okay! Maybe try some stretchier 30's or try a 32B like you talked about
ABraThatFits,3e0yfm,hurrrrrmione,4,Tue Jul 21 15:32:28 2015 UTC,"The band should be comfortably snug. Sometimes that leaves marks, just like you'll get marks from your underwear or socks. As long as they disappear within a few hours and aren't painful it's fine.   I would heavily advise against wearing a 32 band. That's bigger than all your bust measurements - you need a band smaller than your breasts in order for the bra to stay up and fit well.  Did you try the CK on upside-down and backwards? What's the bra model?"
ABraThatFits,3e0yfm,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:03:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions.

Chantelle is a French brand so sometimes it's sold in EU sizing or with a combination of UK/US band measurements and EU cup sizes (like on that Bare Necessities link you provided).
ABraThatFits,3e0snw,Goddess_Keira,5,Tue Jul 21 02:56:01 2015 UTC,"It cannot be a UK H, Chantelle doesn't go that high. Their H is an EU H and is equivalent to a UK FF. They only go up to EU H. The Rive Gauche full cup is a pretty deep cup bra, though."

ABraThatFits,3e0vg8,rynia_,4,Tue Jul 21 02:28:52 2015 UTC,"Hi. I was curious to see the comparison between Jasmine and Chi-Chi as Chi-Chi is based on Jasmine. I don't know if Chi-Chi ever uses three hooks. I think Jasmine goes to three hooks in GG cup and larger, so one would think Chi-Chi should as well, but I can't find any info on that, not even on the company's website. Perhaps you can email them to ask? At any rate, the Chi-Chi looks very nice except for, as you know, being small for the larger breast.  I'm puzzling over the Caitlyn. The cups look like they fit you really well. Do you think that there's excess room in the cup after you're all swooped and scooped? A 36G would be both a band and a cup size smaller, so too small I'm sure. if you go smaller it would either be 38FF (where you will mostly notice a difference in the cup being one volume smaller, while the band is the same size but will feel smaller because the reduced cup volume makes the bra smaller all around, if that makes sense. :) Or you could try a 36GG, which will maintain the cup volume of the 38G but with a slightly different proportion, and will have a smaller band.  Edit: Looking more closely, it appears you have the bottom hook on the loosest setting, and the upper two on the middle setting. I don't know if you did that on purpose, but it's sometimes advocated as a way of equalizing tension on the band. A band can sometimes feel fine on the outermost hook at the bottom, but need to be hooked a little tighter on the top two hooks to feel secure there."
ABraThatFits,3e0vg8,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:34:39 2015 UTC,"The Jasmine I have is 38GG, and has 3 hooks in the back, so I was hoping Sculptresse would do that as well. I'll email to ask, as I have plenty of time to wait for their answer because the Chi-chi in GG isn't in my price range atm. I think it might be a bit comfier than the Jasmine. The Panache wires are really firm and I'm still getting used to tighter bands and not having my straps bear all the weight.  Not tons of extra room, it just seemed like after all the swooping, it wanted to creep back out sideways and underneath.  I had taken the Caitlyn on and off a couple times to re-hook tighter and to fiddle with the straps. I kept feeling like I had to pull it down in the back. I didn't notice the mis-hook until I put the pictures up on imgur. By then I was like, eff that I'm not fixing it :)  *I'm still trying to get a handle on the logic of sister sizing... So 38FF & 36GG would both be a little bit smaller? (Making a note in the notebook, lol)"
ABraThatFits,3e0vg8,Goddess_Keira,2,Tue Jul 21 04:06:42 2015 UTC,"*I'm still trying to get a handle on the logic of sister sizing... So 38FF & 36GG would both be a little bit smaller? (Making a note in the notebook, lol)   Yes, both would be a little smaller but in different ways, as I tried to describe but maybe not too well. A 38FF is not a sister size to 38G. A 36GG is a sister size to 38G.   Sister sizes are different band sizes having the same cup volume--here is a neat little chart of sister sizes--sizes with the same cup volume appear in a row in the same colour. As you will logically imagine, the cup shape and proportions have to be quite different in order for, say, a 28JJ to be a sister size of 38G and still hold the same volume in the cups. However, when you stay within one sister size, the cup proportions should be quite similar. There are some instances where going up or down one sister size works very well and gives the better fit, and others where it isn't a good solution.  In the case of your Caitlyn, you would get a 38FF if you wanted the cup to be smaller and the band to be the same. It isn't a sister size because the 38FF is one cup volume smaller than 38G. If a smaller cup is what you need, you would get 38FF and you will likely notice that the band feels a bit more snug because even though it's the same size, you no longer have excess cup volume distributed over the whole circumference of the bra.   If a smaller band is what you need, you would get the sister size of 36GG to get that smaller band while maintaining the same cup volume. If you need both the band and the cup to be smaller, then you would try 36G, but I'm pretty sure that is going to be too small."

For you, you may find that you need 36GG in Elomi and 38GG in Panache brands - in other brands like Freya and Curvy Kate, it may depend.  As far as Elomi plunges go, I have Betty which is spotty and made from mesh and Jocelyn which is made from a thicker more silky feeling fabric.  I think there's Izzy as well?  I also have a Persia balconette which is made from similar fabric to Jocelyn. Have a look on their website!

ABraThatFits,3dxdu9,nidena,14,Mon Jul 20 09:14:04 2015 UTC,I saw those online and the colors are beautiful. I will say that the feel of the BBV line is/was amazing. It was very hard to give those up when I realized that they just do not work. I can still wear their unlined BBV but those did not have memory fit to begin with so I am guessing there is no major shift for them.   Will the bands be less stretchy? They are so notorious for that and it would be probably be somewhat of an improvement if you could depend on a 32 to remain a 32 for longer than a month.   Is there a promo price for the BBV or just the PINK Everywhere?
ABraThatFits,3dxdu9,horkus1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:38:43 2015 UTC,"They didn't seem less stretchy.  If you like the unlined, you may like the Body Lounge that is being launched at the same time.

It's the only thing I wear from VS. I like how comfy it is on days I don't want to feel like I'm wearing a bra at all. Do you think the overall fit/shape has changed much? A stiffer band actually sounds nice, but if the cups aren't as flexible/soft it prob won't fit me anymore (since technically it's a cup size too small, the flexibility was what allowed it  to work on me)."

ABraThatFits,3e09s0,_Pandasaurus_,4,Mon Jul 20 23:32:06 2015 UTC,Could you possibly post your measurements and shape. Without seeing a picture (or knowing your size/shape) my best guess is that the cups are too tall on you. If you have shorter roots that will create gapping right by the straps because your tissue runs out before the bra does. Specifically which bras do this?
ABraThatFits,3e09s0,petitecollegiate,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:54:42 2015 UTC,"36D, and not sure what you mean by shape? Sorry. :/   I never thought of the cups being too tall, but now that I think about it, that makes perfect sense.  I've tried Victoria Secret, Maidenform, Calvin Klein, DKNY, Lily of France, Vassarette, Bali...and...I can't remember what else. I've literally spent several hours trying to find one that doesn't have the gaping issue."
ABraThatFits,3e09s0,hurrrrrmione,6,Tue Jul 21 00:01:24 2015 UTC,Please measure yourself according to the instructions here. We use the measurements to make sure you're wearing the right size and to help determine your breast shape.  Breasts come in all sorts of different shapes and different bras fit different shape breasts differently. So knowing the shape of your breasts will help us troubleshoot why your bras don't fit right and allow us to give you recommendations for bras with a shape that'll fit you better. Check out the shape guide and let us know what shape you think your breasts are. It's okay if you're not sure.
ABraThatFits,3e09s0,petitecollegiate,4,Tue Jul 21 00:25:21 2015 UTC,"I'd look at the beginners guide on the sidebar to get more information about shape. Your exact measurements (without a bra Snug underbust, tight underbust, overbust, leaning overbust, and lying overbust) will help me suggest which brands would be best. Also, are you sure on your size? (have you used our calculator) Even if you've been sized elsewhere, a lot of places in the US use a +4 (or +6) method of sizing that can lead to a less than ideal fit. If you've been sized like that, it could explain why the cups are too tall. The volume wouldn't be distributed right for your shape, even if the cups fit. Also, are you pregnant, do you have implants, or are you nursing? All of those can throw off fit."
ABraThatFits,3e09s0,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:27:50 2015 UTC,"I am pregnant, but didn't think that would matter in relation to this issue. I'm only 8 weeks right now, but went from a 34B (which fit perfectly at the time. No gaping issues) ...to 36D already. :/ I haven't been sized or used the calculator but when I say I've spent literally several hours trying on various sizes and brands I wasn't exaggerating. (Sorry though, I know that's not much help!)  I just checked out the shape guide. I'd say shallow is closest."
ABraThatFits,3e09s0,hurrrrrmione,5,Tue Jul 21 00:41:53 2015 UTC,The fact that this is occurring in every bra you've tried indicates to me 36D is most likely not the right size for you.   Why did you go from a 34B to a 36D? Why/how was 34B not fitting right? How did you arrive at 36D being a good size?  Have you tried scooping and swooping?
ABraThatFits,3e09s0,socaldisneygal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:56:02 2015 UTC,"I always do the swoop and scoop. I went from a 34B to a 36D because of pregnancy...things...bloating I suppose. I'm only 8 weeks but because of bloating I look closer to 20 and my boobs got ""huge"" in comparison to what they were before. I arrived at 36D being my size because it seemed to fit best out of everything I tried. Literally every brand of bra/style at Dillards, Sears, Kohls, and Victoria Secret. I tried on every variation between 34-38 (34 would hardly hook and 38 was just obviously too big) and B-DD. I spent a few hours at each store, over a few days."
ABraThatFits,3e09s0,brafithelp,5,Tue Jul 21 02:13:07 2015 UTC,"That must have been exhausting! This is one of the reasons we encourage people to measure themselves - then you have a lot fewer bras to try on at a store in order to find one that works!  The other possibility is that you need a different shape of bra. Like I said before, measuring yourself will give us some information on your shape.  Did you look at the fullness and root width sections of the shape guide?"
ABraThatFits,3e09s0,Goddess_Keira,4,Tue Jul 21 02:21:44 2015 UTC,"I am pregnant also, 37 weeks. I measured myself using the guidelines on this site right before I found out I was pregnant (42C/44B). I measured myself around 10 weeks, and was a 44C for sure. Last week I swore that my band size went up. Nope, measures a 44G (Which isn't quite right because I have pendulous boobs and soft tissue from weight loss/breastfeeding, so my cup size is smaller.)  I am waiting to buy nursing bras until my milk comes in.    So please measure yourself according to the guidelines, it will help you find a comfortable bras during your pregnancy."
ABraThatFits,3e09s0,yellkaa,5,Tue Jul 21 05:42:54 2015 UTC,"Definitely still measure! US brands are VERY limited in size and shape options. 99% of bras sold here are full cups, which are shallow and only vary slightly in shape. The other 1% are balconette or half cups made purely for fashion, not function. To make things extra difficult, sizes are limited to roughly 32-44 A-DDD, unless you go with Wacoal, which offers G and H. (So about 42 sizes)  The sizing system we use in this sub is UK, which offers WAY more sizes and offers lots more shapes. UK brands offer 28-48 bands in A to KK (UK uses double letters after D... DD E F FF G GG etc), for a whopping 160 sizes! That means you are very likely going to find a better fit in your UK size.  If your bras are universally filled in the center but gaping to the sides, here are some reasons why it might happen:  A) Orange-in-a-glass. The wires are too narrow to let your entire breast in, making the cup look empty. It looks too big, but in reality it is too narrow.  B) Wrong shape. You may be shallow, unable to fill the top of a full cup. You may be very projected, pushing away a cup that is too shallow.  C) The wrong size. This one is usually the culprit. 36D is cut for 36"" underbust and 40"" across bust. Is that you? If not, the dimensions of the bra are all wrong for you! (FWIW I also used to wear 36D... then swelled to a US 38H while preggo. Turns out my real sizes were 30FF to 32J!)"
ABraThatFits,3e0ob1,addpulp,2,Tue Jul 21 01:31:15 2015 UTC,I haven't heard particularly good things about this sticky bra. Most people have said it isn't worth the price; there are similar quality products available on Amazon for like $15.

ABraThatFits,3e02f3,hurrrrrmione,5,Mon Jul 20 22:43:48 2015 UTC,"Measurements are just a starting point; based on yours, you might possibly do fine with something more like 32DD-E. Do you have an idea of what your shape might be (see shape guide linked in sidebar)? You might do best with a different style, as well (perhaps halfcup).  Since 32DDs and sometimes 32E/DDD are often not too difficult to find in department stores (and even Victoria's Secret), you might want to go try out some in that size range in person to see if they feel/look better."
ABraThatFits,3e02f3,bustynerd,2,Tue Jul 21 01:35:50 2015 UTC,"I think the Juna isn't far off & would work in a 32E. I doubt the Neve ever works for you, just a bad shape for you - I think it's the shape making it look so giant & not the size.   I bet Freya's half cups would work. Maybe try Patsy, Lauren, Totally Tartan, Dreamcatcher - whatever Freya ""padded half cup"" (it's more like lined, not padded like a padded push up bra) you can find on Amazon, in a 32E & go from there."
ABraThatFits,3dymyy,araquen,5,Mon Jul 20 16:30:29 2015 UTC,"I also think Elomi would be a good brand for you to start with, and Caitlyn is a great basic bra. Be forewarned; it's full-coverage and while I consider it very pretty, it is not Va Va Voom styling! It often works well for pendulous shapes. Elomi Rita is another good one to try. It's slightly lower in the gore and wires than Caitlyn, and maybe a bit fuller cut  on top.   Sizewise, it will take some trying on to fine-tune that. In this size range the calculator often overestimates the cup size some. Going by your leaning measurement, I'd say to start with both 40GG and 38H in one or the other of those styles. You might prefer the 38 band size because many do find Elomi bands to be stretchy, but it depends on your tolerance for a tighter band. Your old 38s are going to be quite stretched out; no longer true to size. I would also not be surprised if you turn out to be more in the 40G or 38GG size for Elomi bras.  I see Cleo bras being mentioned, but I don't recommend that you start with those because their top band size is 38. Ultimately that may be fine for you, but Cleo runs a bit snug in the band for many people, and if that turns out to be the case for you, you don't have the next band size up available to compare. The parent company of Cleo, which is Panache, has a line called Sculptresse that goes up to higher band sizes so I would direct you to that line at first if you'd like to try Panache bras. Then you have the option to compare 38 and 40 band sizes."
ABraThatFits,3dymyy,Goddess_Keira,2,Mon Jul 20 17:34:04 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks!    I figure once I get the size right, I can then play with style. I'm a little old and decrepit to worry about sexiness in my bras anymore, and I find the deep plunge irksome at times, but that might have more to do with wrong size). The Fredericks was my only option because in my day it was almost impossible to get even DD without it looking like a chest harness, and the Fredericks had a decent compromise between style and structure. Bras have come a long way in the last 10 years, and I am older and frumpier than I was when I first started buying the Va Va Voom styling.    But yeah, started with the Elomi, and I should know Wednesday if the sizes work or not. If the Caitlyns are too much, I'll at least know I have the band and cup right - and that was the important part: eliminating some variables so I can at least start. Otherwise I am stuck with over-analysis paralysis and end up not buying anything (then have my old bras assassinate me when I have to go out)."
ABraThatFits,3dymyy,lauracb,4,Mon Jul 20 18:19:29 2015 UTC,"The calculator has a propensity to overestimate in this size range;It's not that your measurements are bad, its the calculator letting you know it has more trouble in large band/cup combinations.  A 38H or 40GG is a good starting point based on your measurements but you may find that your ""true"" size ends up a little smaller (or perhaps a little bigger, since with pendulousness it is hard to get accurate measurements - but usually the result of that is ""rounding up"" by the calculator). Any of the British full-bust brands that you can get with free returns from Amazon, nordstrom, asos, etc, are fine: Elomi, Panache, and Cleo by Panache are popular examples. Some of the ""Cleo"" line bras are frequently mentioned as good for guessing shape: The Lily or Erin (related shapes) tend to do well for people with more projection; the Cleo Lucy for moderate projection, and Cleo Marcie for shallower shapes. Buying a few unlined/unpadded bras can help you nail down shape and size; once you have an idea what shape and size suit, it will make it easier to find padded/lined bras that work. A lot of us have had to do a lot of trial and error, especially when first starting if we don't know our shape. Free returns will likely be your friend."
ABraThatFits,3dymyy,Shanakitty,2,Mon Jul 20 16:45:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! I'm going to start with the Caitlyn (it's on sale for $38.50 on Amazon), but it is awesome to have other brands to check into. This is exactly the kind of ""narrowing down"" I was hoping for!"
ABraThatFits,3dymyy,HootyMyBoobs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:32:23 2015 UTC,I've never heard that Cleo Marcie is for shallow shapes. It is for projected-ish full-on-top shapes and Lucy is for full-on-bottom. It may depend somewhat on the size range though.
ABraThatFits,3dymyy,Shanakitty,2,Mon Jul 20 22:19:16 2015 UTC,"It is shallower in the smaller cup sizes, but that doesn't apply to OP."

The bra seems a little small all over - I think one cup volume up (so 32FF or 30G) would be better in this bra. The calculator is giving me 28GG because of the difference between your snug and tight underbusts, but I think 30G would be best in most bras. The shape works well for you, though, and I think the torpedo boob will go away in the larger size."

I can try the other size though, but since I ordered it I'll have to ship it back.."
ABraThatFits,3e0h6v,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Tue Jul 21 01:58:42 2015 UTC,"It only looks like it's gaping in the last picture, but that might get worse in a larger size. Try pushing the gore to your sternum so it mostly tacks and see what happens to the cups. Does the gaping go away? Is there overflow?   You seem pretty projected, I'm guessing the bottom gap you got in  the Natori Feathers was caused by not enough immediate projection. Your roots also seem relatively short, which might be why you've had gaping issues in other bras. Have you tried Cleo Lucy?  I saw on another post that you live in LA, so I wanted to let you know about a great boutique called Jenette Bras. They've got UK brands and really nice European brands, too (no Polish though). There are currently locations in Hollywood and Pasadena, with a new location opening in Santa Monica in August. I've heard nothing but good things about their fitters and service in general."

Thank you. I actually did hear about that store but after reading the description on the website I was immediately turned off from it because I assumed they would not have whatever size I was, since I'm not busty/overdeveloped and don't fit into that whole description.

ABraThatFits,3dyqdy,ifeelnumb,2,Mon Jul 20 16:54:15 2015 UTC,"Where exactly do you get the psoriasis? On your back where the clasp sits? At the points where the wires end? Anywhere along the straps or the band?   If you could also do the 5 measurements from our measuring guide and list them here, that would be great.  I'm thinking a longline bra would help you with the ability to switch up where the bra hits you every day. It might also help with the psoriasis in general as the pressure from the band is spread out over a wider area."
ABraThatFits,3dyqdy,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:56:01 2015 UTC,"Lord, I get it all over.  Right now I have it on my side boob under my armpit and on my back shoulders where the straps sit.  In the winter when I can't get sunlight I get it on the material lines under my breasts and on the line on my back.  Let me add that I am not reacting to the fabric or my detergents; I have checked that already.  Usually if I get a small patch it will spread out if I don't find it in time, which is my current problem.  It's also very hard to reach when it's on my back, so prevention is the name of the game.    The Soma bras are actually quite good in general, but I need more variety.  Measurements: snug under 32""  tight under 30""  bust standing 37""  bust leaning 39""  bust lying down 37.5"""
ABraThatFits,3dyqdy,cleverdistraction,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:21:53 2015 UTC,"So with those measurements, it's possible that you might find some improvement in a different size. The bra size calculator is suggesting a 32F (UK cup size) for your measurements.   This is a starting point - it may not be exactly the right size - but it's certainly quite different from the size you're currently wearing. (Note that if you've tried a 32 (or 34) band before and it's felt too tight, if you tried it in a smaller cup size the feeling of tightness can be caused by that.)  I am not well-versed in psoriasis, but maybe you're getting some of the irritation because the bra you're wearing is too loose in the band and thus it's shifting around as you wear it."
ABraThatFits,3dz0q4,DigitalCitizen0912,5,Mon Jul 20 18:05:36 2015 UTC,"Could you add your 5 measurements to the post? The calculator is good but not infallible, and we like to have a human check its work.  US brands kind of all do their own thing as far as sizing goes, so it's generally easier to remember your UK size and then convert individually for any US brands you encounter. For example, Lane Bryant's 40F is roughly the same as a UK 40F, while other brands just use lots of Ds. Meanwhile, UK brands all use the exact same system and pretty much any website that sells them will show the UK size (with the exception of the US' ASOS and Zulily).  Where in California do you live? It's actually not too hard to find bras in-store if you live near LA or the Bay area. I'm in SoCal, so Nordstrom is a great place to go around here, and there are several reputable boutiques that carry bras in this size range. I have 21 Nordstroms within a 100-mile radius of my house, so if you live down here I would guess that the number is similar for you. And that's not even counting the Nordstrom Racks!  I know less about the Bay area but I'm sure there's Nordstrom up there too, and there is a fabulous boutique called A Revelation in Fit in Oakland that carries tons of bras! (The owner posts here on occasion and tells us about her store.)   I'm not really sure about elsewhere in California, but the offline retailer list in the buying guide section of our wiki has a list of all the boutiques we know about, organized by country (and then state, for the US)."

I am in the North Bay and just looked up a Nordstrom Rack in Corte Madera. Hurray! I'm willing to drive a half hour if it means I will be giving myself a serious bra upgrade!
ABraThatFits,3dz0q4,EmmaInFrance,2,Mon Jul 20 18:28:56 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up, Nordstrom Rack can be pretty hit-or-miss. It's definitely worth a look every now and then, but don't go in expecting to find anything that works.  Here's the offline retailer list u/crazymusicalgenius96 mentioned :)  If you take a look at the shape guide and let us know what shape you think your breasts are, we can give you recommendations of specific bras to try."
ABraThatFits,3dza9h,EmilyR2006,2,Mon Jul 20 19:12:20 2015 UTC,"Bras that seem too big and too small at the same time are usually indicating a shape issue. It sounds like all of these bras are too shallow and wide for you; you sound like you have a good amount of projection. You also sound like you could have short roots, as the Deco is too tall and you're getting some gaping near the strap in the Hopscotch longline.  Unfortunately the most projected bras in our size range are all seamed, and most are unlined. The Polish brands are really good at hiding seams, though, from what I've seen. Comexim plunges might work, but the cups could be too tall. Ewa Michalak CHP is probably still too shallow, but it's a possibility. I think you would probably be ok in 60F/65E with EM and 60G in Comexim to get the best balance between narrow wires and projection.   Freya plunge balconies have your name written allllll over them, probably in 28E/F because the wires will still be nice and narrow then. They're the most projected bras in our size range because Freya doesn't scale them to make them more shallow, and they're closed on top so they won't gape. I know you want a t-shirt bra but I think the Freya plunge balconies are going to be the cheapest option and they will probably give you the best fit out of all of these bras. They're like a deeper version of Claudette Dessous."
ABraThatFits,3dza9h,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:59:27 2015 UTC,Thanks. You have given me a lot to look at. I definitely think you are right about short roots. And I think I'm high set too. Most darts on shirts are too low and half adjustable straps on bras are sometimes too long. I've tried some of the unlined freya bras and every one I have tried seems too pointy. Like more pointy than if I'm not wearing a bra.  I'm hoping to be able to go to a boutique that is about an hour away from me soon to try some bras on. And ewa bras I have tried a few and the sizing has seemed different on every one. I wish I could try those on somewhere.
ABraThatFits,3dza9h,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:16:02 2015 UTC,"The Freya plunge balconies come in a variety of different cuts, and some are pointier than others. Arabella, Patsy, and Ada (the most recent Ada is called Ignite) seem to be the most popular and least pointy cuts. Each one has 5-6 sisters, you can look them up on Bratabase.  Which EM bras have you tried? They are all slightly different so it helps to get styles that more people have tried so you know whether the band runs tight or loose."
ABraThatFits,3dza9h,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:24:14 2015 UTC,"The first one I had was a HP Rokoko in 65dd. It worked pretty good until I lost about 10lbs.  I also tried a Mp Truskawki Z Malinami I can't remember if it was a 65d or dd but I tried it after the hp 65dd had gotten too big. The mp the band was good on it but the cups were too small. I have a 65d 3dm summertime the cups are too small on that one. I also tried a 65d Chp Ciasteczko.  That one was impossibly tiny. Both the band and cups were too small.  In the 65 band Ewas I tried some were to big, some fit, and another was tiny. The cups seemed really inconsistent too.  I think there would probably be some that would fit me if I could find the right size. Just so hard to do if you cant try them on with such inconsistent sizing."
ABraThatFits,3dza9h,jlcl119,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:04:59 2015 UTC,"You tried lots of different styles, which is part of why the cups seemed so inconsistent! HP and CHP are both half cups, MP is a padded plunge, and 3DM is an unlined plunge. MP and 3DM are both pretty shallow and HP/CHP are more projected. HP is definitely the most projected out of the ones you tried but it's long discontinued now. The band size can be inconsistent because of the different fabrics EM uses. So most CHPs (or 3Ds, or PLs) fit the same in the cups, but the band size can differ because of the stretchiness of the particular fabrics. For example, the Siodme Niebo fabric is very stretchy and most people have to size down."
ABraThatFits,3dza9h,petitecollegiate,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:18:15 2015 UTC,"Wow. Thanks for explaining some of the styles.  Yeah there was probably a good 4"" difference in some of the bands"
ABraThatFits,3dzbx2,Aperfectfitforme,5,Mon Jul 20 19:24:50 2015 UTC,"You'll need to go up in the cup size quite a bit. Fit for the bigger boob and use inserts on the other side if you want to. The wire sitting too low is a problem with immediate projection, but depending on how the bra scales, it might go away with the bigger cup."
ABraThatFits,3dzbx2,j_sunrise,4,Mon Jul 20 21:04:26 2015 UTC,"I cannot see the photos, because you need to set both the album and the images to hidden and not secret. But:  With a snug measurement of 33 inches you can wear either a loose 32 band or a snug 34 band. With your tight underbust measurement so close I would generally recommend a 34 band for you.   Panache Ariza has a very snug band, most size up in bandsize in this bra. I am not surprised you find it very tight. A 36 band should serve you much better in this bra."

ABraThatFits,3dued4,intangiblemango,17,Sun Jul 19 15:59:35 2015 UTC,"This is awesome - thanks for doing this!  I agree on the moulded cups. I've gone from a 38DDD to a 34DDD, and molded cup bras are a life saver for those transition periods. I noticed my asymmetry a lot more as my weight came down, and molded cups help disguise that (or make it easier to wear a cutlet) too."

ABraThatFits,3dued4,savor,10,Sun Jul 19 19:29:56 2015 UTC,"The last thing I want to note: When you are all 'done' and at your goal, that may still not the correct day to run out and buy 100 new pretty bras. Maintenance is tricky to figure out, and sometimes it takes a little time to figure out where you are going to hang out. I lost a bit of extra weight and one additional cup size since I started ""maintaining"".   Absolutely agree with this part. Maintenance is really difficult, arguably harder than losing, and while you may find that you either lose more with the long-term changes you've made to diet and exercise, you may also find that you have lost weight to a point you can't reasonably maintain and gain some of it back.   At some point, though, it's likely that your cup will gape, or your band will ride up, or your wire will start stabbing your armpit, or any number of possible things that may happen when your bra is just too big.   The thing that happened for me was getting a terrible, painful rash from chafing under my breasts. The material of the bras you continue to wear will factor into this one -  I had several bras at the time that were the sort of fine mesh that Elomi uses, and I think that irritates more easily than some other materials.  Besides molded cup bras, another thing you can consider for weight loss is non-wired bras. It's less critical that these fit you exactly right in order to avoid things like chafing and stabbing wires.    FWIW for other people's knowledge, I originally lost ~70-80 pounds and went from a 38G to a 32G. I've since gained some back and have migrated to a 34G. (Apparently my boobs love being a G cup, or sometimes an FF or GG.)  I haven't found that the perkiness or self-supportiveness of my boobs changed much that I can tell.  I've never paid much attention to my shape, just used trial and error to get bras that fit well, but I've noticed that while I used to be able to wear the Freya Deco both at my largest and at my smallest, since gaining some weight back the shape doesn't work for me anymore.  :-/"
ABraThatFits,3dued4,cleverdistraction,10,Sun Jul 19 17:46:57 2015 UTC,"That's very good and comprehensive. I especially agree with buying bras that fit you now, wherever that is in your weight-loss journey, and with accepting that it's okay to not have ""ideal"" fit, and that a well-fitted sports bra is very important, although paradoxically I didn't have a sports bra until recently. Most of my exercise was walking and stationary bike so an ordinary bra sufficed.  My weight-loss journey unfolded pretty quickly, as I lost weight much faster than I expected in part due to an underlying medical condition that I didn't know I had developed. When I started, I basically had only one well-fitting bra, an Elomi Caitlyn. I wore the shit out of that bra, and I had other bras that I'd hung on to from thinner days that I found I could wear again as I lost. Eventually of course my Elomi was beyond wearing but I had a Prima Donna Menton bra on hand that fit wonderfully and I got lots of mileage out of that one. Then I bought an Elomi and Goddess bra in my new band size, 34, and altered my Menton down in the band because the cups still fit pretty well (magical stretch lace). I also had various smaller-sized bras that didn't fit perfectly but could do the job and were comfortable to wear. They were all very expensive bras so it was nice to be able to get more use out of them.  After about two months, my new Elomi and Goddess bras were swimming on me and since I was in their smallest band size I was sized out. I had a couple of Prima Donna bras from the old days that fit pretty well although not perfectly--but they are comfy, look good, and since Prima Donna is $$$ I am happy to wear them. I don't know that I can do much better, actually. I've bought three new bras in my hopefully final size--a Prima Donna Madison, Prima Donna Sambal (old, long-discontinued style that I picked up at a good price but it was very old stock) and finally a Panache Sport.  I have always been pendulous since my teenage years and have gotten more so from weight gain and loss, but age factors in there, too. I have definitely lost all upper fullness but I was always FoB."
ABraThatFits,3dued4,Goddess_Keira,8,Sun Jul 19 17:22:02 2015 UTC,"This is great! I've lost 90 pounds and gone from a 38F to a 34G. My best friend asked me the other day if I missed my boobs, which I really don't. lol  But here's my issue:  I've stuck with molded cups because they're all I've ever owned.  It's Allah's been very obvious if I'm cold, etc, and the molded cups seem to help hide that. And they do seem to help with shaping (I, unfortunately, have the ""pendulous"" shape that comes with weightloss).  But I'm wondering if I should try a ""regular"" or non-molded cup?"
ABraThatFits,3dued4,DeeAnn2014,7,Sun Jul 19 17:54:05 2015 UTC,"A 34G is the same volume as a 38F, so that makes sense. :) Unless you're wearing US sizes, in which case it is still only 1 cup volume smaller.   There are lightly padded bras that are not molded if you're worried about your nipples showing, and there are also silicone nipple covers that you can get to wear with unlined bras. Since you have a more pendulous shape, it's possible that you're also more projected. Most molded cup bras are pretty shallow. In order to get the best support, you want the underwire to sit in your inframammary fold (where your breast root meets your ribcage), and there should be no skin-to-skin contact, like in the image on the right. If your current bras do that, then you're good to go. If they don't, you should try out some more projected bras."
ABraThatFits,3dued4,Shanakitty,3,Sun Jul 19 19:01:38 2015 UTC,"Omg, thank you!!! Mine tend to do exactly what's on the left and I absolutely hate it! Thanks for the tips, this helps quite a bit."

ABraThatFits,3dued4,Shanakitty,3,Sun Jul 19 19:29:39 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about 'pendulousness' with non-molded cups. I have this kind of boobs too, since I was a school-girl, and I've tried lots of bras of different type, and, actually, I found that non-stretchy completely sheer bras may hold and lift my boobs way better than moulded cups. Look, here is my Cleo Lily which has no padding, no foam, just two layers of completely sheer fabric. And here even is a pic of my old fit check in Kris Line (it turned to be a couple of cup sizes too small) which also is made of two layers of lacy sheer fabric. They both make boobs look any way but pendulous, even so they are not a perfect fit fot me. When you find the one of perfect fit, it will work even better."
ABraThatFits,3dued4,yellkaa,8,Mon Jul 20 12:17:27 2015 UTC,"Great write up! This is all great advice, thank you for taking the time.  I'm not sure how much weight I've lost, but I've gone from a 40FF to a 36GG to a 34H...then gained a little weight back because I slacked off, now back at 36GG. I went from wide roots to average, maybe slightly narrow roots. The bras brand I loved, Elomi, is far too wide for me now; I have tons of space on the sides that isn't so bad on Betty but on Bijou is obvious. I've gotten more projected but am just as FoB as ever.  Getting back into working out and upping my effort is HARD.  SO MUCH YES on the sports bra advice."
ABraThatFits,3dued4,syrusbliz,4,Sun Jul 19 18:05:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much!! I'm in a little bit of a difference situation, I'm unintentionally loosing weight and trying to gain it back. My bra size has been all over the place because of it. I don't know if they're going to back to the same size they were or if they are going to be bigger or smaller depending on how much weight I gain.  I really appreciated all of the ""in the mean time"" fixes. I'm hopeful that I will go back to the same size I initially was so I don't need to purchase new bras. But for now I've been using air pads to make up for the difference. Bands never fit me that well anyway and they are just worse now. I'm going to try some rixie clips next!"
ABraThatFits,3dued4,LadyAnju,4,Sun Jul 19 18:17:38 2015 UTC,"One of the most useful things somebody told me on ABTF is that women who experience weight loss often have deflated upper poles. This helped a lot because I was trying to understand how I could be shallow but lack the obvious breast tissue going up to the collar bone that the shallow guide images have.  Unfortunately I discovered ABTF years after my weight loss (40 pounds on low carb) so I don't know my previous shape, but I suspect I was conical/even. Now I am still conical with tall roots but no volume above my areola. The combination of tall roots and no upper fullness isn't something I would have figured out on my own and isn't a shape that bras are usually designed for."
ABraThatFits,3dued4,syrashiraz,3,Sun Jul 19 21:44:14 2015 UTC,"Super helpful! And congrats on your weight loss!  I just lost close to 35 lbs and am trying to get a better fitting bra. I'm torn though, because I want to lose another 15-20. I went from 36G to 34G/FF, but I'm wishing now that I went for 32 band because the band is already on the second to tightest latch. I haven't noticed the cups getting too big, but that may be because the cups I've always worn were too small.   The bit about sports bras is very true. I can't for the life of me find one that really compresses my breasts and I end up wearing two sports bras (natori 36DDD or panache 36F, plus a really tight size M over the head bra on top). Even this isn't adequate for running and it's like having a large wet sack of flour bouncing up and down on my chest.   Edit: I'm really tall (5'10) so weight loss isn't as extreme on my frame as it is for smaller women."
ABraThatFits,3dued4,xklinx,7,Sun Jul 19 16:54:13 2015 UTC,"With you being a runner, you might want to investigate Shock Absorber bras. I haven't tried them myself, and they have a few models but I see them strongly recommended and I think the key factor about them is that they have the double closure which is one step up from the racer back feature of many sports bras. I suspect that really helps to keep the girls locked and loaded."
ABraThatFits,3dued4,Goddess_Keira,2,Sun Jul 19 17:25:39 2015 UTC,I gotta agree here. I have the 5044 and it's the bomb. I lucked out last summer and got two off Amazon for $29 each.

Now I am slightly small in my 30Gs, I have lost some weight and am now 134 lbs. Since I still have ten pounds to go to my goal weight I think I will hold off on buying a bra until then. Luckily I have kept a lot of bras that are a couple sizes too small. I think I will keep my too big bras too, for when I get pregnant, a couple years from now. In terms of shape my fiancÃ© has commented that they look smaller, as well as perkier! I have also noticed I have to tighten the bands because I have lost some back fat."
ABraThatFits,3dued4,ladylowtide,4,Sun Jul 19 21:35:27 2015 UTC,The time for me to change was when I was experiencing a LOT of back pain. In losing 80 lbs I went from a 38G to a 34HH/32J. Since then of course I've grown to a 32KK / L without any weight gain but that's  a different  story. I fully agree that you shouldn't buy a lot of bras right off.

That is similar to my experience, weight loss, no change in breast size.  Not so sure what my proper bra size was, due to circumstances and due to not being on ABTF, but larger cup size/smaller band after weight loss is true for me.  Frustrating."

Now I've lost a total of 16 lb. so I'm down to 137. I now wear a 32D/DD with most bras fitting better in the DD range.  I also noticed that at first I lost a lot of volume from the top half of my breasts, but they evened back out a fair amount once I hit a longer maintenance phase.   I agree about moulded bras and their versatility in fit. The moulded bras I own were much more forgiving and made it easier to deal with insecurities about ""deflating boobs"" when mine lost their volume for a while."

My enlarged chest was one of the things that bothered me the most about being the weight I was, so of course, it seems to be taking its time going away.   I wore a 36B until the weight gain reached my chest; as I understand it, true 36Bs aren't that common. I was completely married to that cup size--it was the perfect size. Of course, when I used the measuring guide, I got a 34FF. So...yeah, I was never a B. I've actually come to be more accepting of how they are by realizing that they were never what I thought they were, if that makes sense, but I'd still rather drop a cup or two (or three).  Anyway, they've gone down a bit over the last several months, although I don't know how much of it's been cup and how much has been band, since I wasn't wearing the right size.

The Deco strapless is somewhat shallow but doesn't cut in as much as some other strapless bras I've tried, such as the Panache convertible. The Wonderbra strapless seems popular with those who have more projection, but it doesn't look to cut in too quickly, could be worth a shot. Others that might work are Curvy Kate Luxe Strapless or Ewa Michalak's straplesses which are supposed to be especially good for shallow shapes. You might not be specifically full on top, but just shallow which causes more breast tissue to be high on the chest. I haven't tried most of these bras so you might want to check their bratabase.com measurements and should probably make a separate post!"
ABraThatFits,3dwcab,Julez22,2,Mon Jul 20 03:36:46 2015 UTC,"Not really. Like I said I got it more for a temporary fix, specially since it was cheap. I know I need something better, I just haven't had the time to look yet.   Thanks for all the tips though!"
ABraThatFits,3dwl32,nonsensedog,5,Mon Jul 20 03:23:15 2015 UTC,"I felt tempted to ask them what they want consumers to do with their bras if they don't fit. They mention something on their page about not buying their bras & reselling them, but they also don't accept returns/exchanges. When you go to buy the items they tell you all sales final, when they send you a confirmation email they tell you all sales final, and when you receive the package on the order sheet there's a line about all sales being final. Lol."
ABraThatFits,3dwl32,Prettyncharmuese,2,Mon Jul 20 05:02:01 2015 UTC,"There's an agreement box to tick when you check out too, but I'm pretty sure they mean resale as in retail, not one or two you bought for yourself. I will probably straight swap on r/braswap if I guessed wrong on sizing the bands down, though."
ABraThatFits,3dwl32,Prettyncharmuese,2,Mon Jul 20 12:18:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know what they mean. But really, how different is it if I buy to resell than if I buy, it doesn't fit, and decide to sell it? You know? I really wanted that cool cotton bra to fit. ð«"

ABraThatFits,3dwl32,petitecollegiate,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:19:01 2015 UTC,I ordered two. One in my normal size and one a band size down. Whichever one doesn't fit will get swapped I guess. Lol

I ordered (the price is so good) but I think that it's unlikely that it will be a good fit as I'm quite projected and narrow with shorter roots. The colors were just so cute though, I couldn't resist. Are the bands still all huge?"
ABraThatFits,3dwl32,Selofain,3,Mon Jul 20 03:31:57 2015 UTC,"These are past seasons, so they are definitely stretchy bands. I can't say more about the fit than Bratabase does, as I am kind of new to this. I am 2.5/5 even full & projected and I like the fit. The cups are quite stretchy too and I find them forgiving on my shape (I could go a cupsize down from my usual if the seams were less stiff)  edited - re Dessous only, I haven't tried other styles yet"
ABraThatFits,3dwl32,NotACorythosaurus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:25:33 2015 UTC,Well I'll just cross my fingers and hope I can alter them to fit. They're so cheap I just couldn't resist trying. When do you ever find a $10 bra?
ABraThatFits,3dwqgj,atheologist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:15:07 2015 UTC,Montelle Flirt is an unlined half cup. I'm guessing Freya Starlet or Fantasie Allegra (the unlined half cups specifically) would fit her similarly to this; I know Fantasie Allegra is on Amazon. Comexim's unlined half cups may also be worth a shot if she's feeling adventurous.
ABraThatFits,3dwqgj,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:20:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Do you happen to know anything about Alegro bras? Amazon seems to have lots of them in her size at very reasonable prices, but there's not much info on Bratabase."

The Panache Isobel Balconnet Bikini top looks pretty similar, so that might be a good one to start with. Gore height in 30H (closest inputted size) is exactly 3.5"", so hopefully it would be the same in 32GG since it's a sister size.   There's also Panache Anna Tankini, but I have no idea what the cups are like. However, I've seen it on Amazon before for cheap, which is a nice bonus."

ABraThatFits,3dw9vv,t_maia,2,Mon Jul 20 07:51:37 2015 UTC,"The problem with Panache Anna/Isobel is that the wires are really soft. This can lead to a severe lack of support. They fixed this somewhat in newer Panache styles, but it is still an issue.   For this reason lots of Panache fans go for the Freya Sweetheart cut.   From your description though I am thinking of the Freya Banded Halter cut (Pier, In The Mix, Cherish, ... or if you are set on a tankini, Resort.)"

I don't tend to do well with pressure at the back of my neck, so i've always avoided halter necks, but i'm not married to a tank style! just need something i can hang out with the grandparents and not get lectured about my life decisions ;) That's hard with plunge style things being so much more comfortable for me, tho!

ABraThatFits,3dvjl5,hurrrrrmione,15,Sun Jul 19 21:54:59 2015 UTC,"I have seen it in stores and my first impression was that it was way overpriced. I remember seeing a bra for $398 and panties that were about $150 and while that may be a worthwhile endeavor for some people (for a custom made bra, for example), it is pretty ridiculous for the quality that VS puts out.   The size range is even more ridiculous. It only included 32-36 bands and the cup range was A-D. With those numbers, it is no surprise that they sell very little of it. Essentially you would have to be a small-ish to average-ish (but not too small!) breasted woman with lots of disposable income AND with no knowledge of all the other options for luxury bras. Not very likely, if you ask me.   Don't get me wrong - I like VS and I like their bras but if I wear one, I am making a compromise on fit. Sometimes that is acceptable, sometimes not. But I can assure you that if I am paying $500+ for designer lingerie, I won't be making any compromises for VS or any bra brand!  One other note - the items I saw were beautiful. Goodness knows that VS has some gorgeous stuff and this was no exception. Kinda makes it that much more frustrating but anyway - it was really, really beautiful!   Good Luck!"

I don't have much experience with VS as I am not in their size range, but I think it'd be fascinating from a merchandising/marketing standpoint to research why they sell the few sizes they do (only around 16) and why they measure people poorly. If they would only use their vast marketing prowress to advertising correct sizing they could seriously make a lot of business (they would, of course, have to carry far more than 16 sizes. A range of 28-40A-K at the very minimum.)"
ABraThatFits,3dvjl5,Julez22,5,Mon Jul 20 02:25:05 2015 UTC,I just looked through the bras. I personally think it's crazy that they're carrying only ten sizes. Use that money to carry more sizes! It's pretttyyy though.
ABraThatFits,3dvjl5,wayward_sun,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:29:36 2015 UTC,"The thing is that they're doing just fine, from a business perspective, with those 16 sizes. The cost of adding more probably isn't worth it to them."

No way in hell am I paying $300 for a bra. Not even if it comes with a hot man attached. I mean I guess I could see someone paying $100 for a custom bra... (I saw a custom SET on Etsy for $100) but these bras aren't custom. When I clicked on the link for one they came in very limited sizes. But I'm also the type of person to scoff at paying $40 for a VS bra. They're cute, but not worth it, imo. Why are they charging so much for a bra? Like what is so good about it that it costs a couple hundred dollars? I'd tell you to make more sizes, but I wouldn't buy those bras."
ABraThatFits,3dvjl5,cleverdistraction,3,Mon Jul 20 03:09:00 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with the laughter at the prices. I seriously wonder who is buying or will buy these.

My experience with VS bras is they're crap quality and fit terribly (although I'm outside their very limited size range so I can't really say for sure) They also have no concept of proper fit or various shapes or anything so I have a hard time trusting their product. That being said, some women do fit into their sizes and like the shapes of their bras."

I sell Agent Provocateur at my work and although they are expensive (give or take $200AUD per bra) their quality is very high and their bras are beautiful. I don't see why VS didn't launch a line with prices more in that range, not going to the full $400 bra line."

ABraThatFits,3dwd7m,XXthrow01,2,Mon Jul 20 02:11:48 2015 UTC,"I think the band feels tight because it's too small in the cup. The wires appear to be sitting on your breasts, at least at the inner edge, judging from the picture of the front. Try the bra on backwards so you can feel the band without your breasts in the cups.  I think the side bulge is probably at least in part breast tissue that can't get into the cups because they are too small and too short.  Your measurements suggest somewhere between 32DD and 32F, and likely some projection based on the differences between standing/leaning/lying.  The majority of Natori bras are shallow, so it may not be an ideal brand for you unfortunately."
ABraThatFits,3dwd7m,M_tridactyla,2,Mon Jul 20 16:47:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I second this. Her measurements point to about a 32F, maybe 32E. Maybe she's not fully swooped and scooped? The armpit bulge she mentioned is what makes me think that."

I will say that the wires look like they might be a little narrow on the outer sides but if you aren't noticing any marks on your breast tissue nor any sliding from the gore, it is probably just fine. I know you mentioned the band being tight but is it too tight? Have you noticed the hooks really straining from the pull of the band when it is hooked?"

Also, Zulily and SecretSales has the occasional bra sale, for example, on July 12 they had a whole bunch of Panache swimwear and Freya/Fantasie on sale. (~$23 iirc). Aside from asos and figleaves, which you have already been told about, there's also Journelle. It calls itself ~designer lingerie~ which may imply high prices everywhere but they sometimes have some nice sales. Here's what they have in 30E (they do count 30DDs in the results, it's just not searchable by that letter), ordered by price. It looks a meager right now but check back every so often you may find yourself a winner - it's not uncommon to hear ""I was lucky enough to snag this one off Journelle!"" around here."

ABraThatFits,3dvxpx,brala,7,Sun Jul 19 23:53:03 2015 UTC,"Ok, I wouldn't go larger than a 30 band, especially in Freya - their bands are usually super stretchy and long.  28GG is an overestimation by the calculator I think.  I would call you more of a 28FF/G, or 30F... and Fantasie's cups are notoriously generously sized, so it makes sense the Fantasie 30E was closer to a fit on you - but it does look slightly too small.  Freya unlined bras run a cup size large, in my experience, and so you might do well in their unlined plunges in a 28F or FF.  The molded bra you tried in 32F and 30E is the Freya Deco Vibe and I think 30F would have been your winner in it, had they had it.  Yes a Wacoal DDD is supposedly a UK E.  Most of Wacoal's bras are quite shallow, and I wouldn't call you shallow.  Just based off pictures, I'd say you're averagely to mostly projected, even fullness, possibly short roots, and appear fairly narrow to average roots as well.  You might do well in the Freya Decos, and their unlined plunges like I mentioned.  30F is ok to start with, but I bet as you get used to tighter bands and find out how quickly Freya bands stretch, you might wind up preferring 28FF's.  You can find almost all of the bras at Nordstrom and ones that are talked about on here on Amazon for way cheaper than Nordstrom will carry them, and most of them have free Prime shipping and returns.  Possibly check out the Cleo unlined bras - Marcie, Lily/Erin, and Lucy - in a 30F and report back.  They're great ""diagnostic"" bras, since they're unlined and will not conceal fit problems like a molded cup will.  They can help you and us determine your shape better and give you better recommendations going forward.  Hope this helps!!"

ABraThatFits,3dvxpx,lcl0706,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:24:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think all of Freya's cups run big, just their unlined plunge bras.

I do, however, think almost all, if not every single one of Fantasie's bras run generous in the cups."
ABraThatFits,3dvxpx,Crikey-Way,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:50:46 2015 UTC,I wear 32E in the Freya Deco and I also tend to observe some gapping (mostly on my right side) but pulling my shoulders back (which is technically standing up straight) I get a little bit of quadboob in the left but the right is just barely touching it?? Does this mean there's like a 2 cup difference between breasts? Why does it seem like everyone has a gaping issue in the Deco Vibe?  Also I got the same color as OP tried on so a little fist bump there.  Edit: also do you know what shape your breasts are because that might be a big help.
ABraThatFits,3dvxpx,applesangria,2,Mon Jul 20 06:09:02 2015 UTC,"Agree with the good advice you've gotten here. The Wacoal Embrace Lace would probably work well for you in the unlined version. It gives a bit more of a retro shape for some. I personally removed the elastic along the top edges of the cups, and it completely transformed the bra for me. (I'm FOT in a 32G, very different shape than you.)  I also think a 28G or 30F (remember, these are sister sizes and have the same cup volume with a different band measurement) would work.

ABraThatFits,3dvfdx,kittydewinter,3,Sun Jul 19 21:17:22 2015 UTC,"I think Ewa might be just narrow enough for you, I think it is on par with Cleo in a lot of sizes. If you are thinking about the PL I think I would go with your UK size (so in your case, a 75FF)."
ABraThatFits,3dvfdx,khasiv,2,Mon Jul 20 12:06:30 2015 UTC,"Cleo wires and Ewa's wires both work pretty well for me, but we are in very different size ranges, despite having similar shapes (I am also full-on top, projected, and close set), so I can't promise the wires will be right for you. You may want to go on Bratabase and compare some Cleo bras that work for you in your size with Ewa styles that you are interested in.  Both the PL and S cuts work for me, though I need to go up 2 cup sizes from my UK size. I think women with more medium-bust sizes usually do not need to size up, so I would start with 70G/75FF as recommended by /u/khasiv to start out with. Ewa's bands can be rather inconsistent; they are not always tight, but sometimes they do run quite small, so it might be safer to go with the 75 band unless you have reason to believe the band is stretchy (based on Bratabase, for example). I know the band on my S Szykus is not nearly as firm as other 70 bands I've bought from her."
ABraThatFits,3dv8v4,SailorVega,8,Sun Jul 19 20:21:21 2015 UTC,"Just chiming in to say that shape is a HUGE factor in fit, and even in the right size, grabbing a bra with the wrong shape can lead to gaping and other obvious fit issues.   I used to love Freya when I was in the FF cup range, but find them an almost impossible fit in my current cupsize (GG/H). The wires are too wide and not ""firm"" enough, which leads to weird gaping in the cups and the gore not sitting firmly against my chest.  I have better luck with Panache bras (either their main line or especially their Cleo line), and your band size makes brands like Elomi a possibility for you.   Also, please feel free to totally ignore your husband. I'm assuming his experience of wearing bras is nil, and therefore you should feel totally comfortable disregarding his suggestions."
ABraThatFits,3dv8v4,realspectacular,6,Mon Jul 20 02:47:43 2015 UTC,"First off, I would recommend talking to your GP or ideally a dermatologist about the marks on your skin.   Secondly, I think UK 38GG/H is a fair estimate. You might need to go down to a 38G. 38H is your maximum possible size (50 - 39 = 11 and 11 inches = H cup).   Just like breasts come in all sorts of different shapes, bras also come in different shapes. So bras can be the right shape for your breasts, and they can also be the wrong shape, even if they are the size you measure at. And depending on how a bra is the wrong shape, it can look like the cup is too big when it's the right size or even too small.  Do you know which Freya you tried? Was it a molded cup? Where was the cup too big?  Do you know which bra you tried in an F cup? Was this UK F or US F?"
ABraThatFits,3dv8v4,hurrrrrmione,2,Sun Jul 19 20:49:34 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely not an expert, so anyone feel free to correct me, but is it possible that maybe your breasts are more shallow and you've been trying on more projected bras? Although I thought usually larger sizes tended to be more projected. Or maybe the bras you tried weren't the right shape."
ABraThatFits,3dv8v4,littleotterpop,6,Mon Jul 20 03:13:56 2015 UTC,"Gapping at the top could mean the bra is too projected, yes. It could also mean the bra is too shallow (orange in a glass effect). It could also mean the bra is designed for more top fullness than she has, or that the bra is designed for taller roots than she has."
ABraThatFits,3dv8v4,hurrrrrmione,2,Mon Jul 20 03:23:44 2015 UTC,"Okay, like I said I'm no expert! Still trying to learn a lot here :)"
ABraThatFits,3dv8v4,littleotterpop,2,Mon Jul 20 03:24:58 2015 UTC,No problem! I'm still learning as well! :)
ABraThatFits,3dv8v4,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:26:12 2015 UTC,"@hurrrrrmione The first bra was an non-molded cup (Firecracker). I feel like I never filled the top- the stretchy lace just kind of lay there with some mild wrinkles. I also think the underwire was a little low, but I'm still not 100% on underwire placement.  The second bra was also a Freya (Deco) in the US size 38F. I wasn't entirely sold on the band size and ended up putting it on the second set of hooks."
ABraThatFits,3dv8v4,EmmaInFrance,5,Sun Jul 19 21:32:31 2015 UTC,"Not filling the top with some wrinkling sounds more like a shape issue than a size issue to me. Also the underwires crossing suggests to me that you might be close set? How many, if any fingers can you fit between your boobs?  This is me in a bra with a shape that doesn't work for my boobs.  And this is me in a shape that does.  Both bras are the same size.  I think an Elomi plunge like Betty/Jocelyn/Izzy could be a good starting point for you. I'd try one in a 38G and a 38GG to start with. Elomi bras have very generous bands and are designed to be very comfortable. The bands are so generous that I would normally suggest trying a 36 band as well but I think a 38 band would give you skin a chance to heal.  As for where to find them, it's often easier and less frustrating to buy online. Look for sites with free shipping and free returns. Amazon and ASOS are very good for this. Shopping online gives you the time and space to think things through and you don't have anyone pressuring you to make a decision."
ABraThatFits,3dv8v4,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:06:30 2015 UTC,u/EmmaInFrance I can fit two fingers without touching any breast tissue.
ABraThatFits,3dv8v4,lauracb,4,Tue Jul 21 22:30:40 2015 UTC,"Just so you know, you can reply directly to a comment by clicking 'reply' under the comment. And you can tag a user by typing u/ and then their username. :)  For some people their breast shape makes it difficult to get the underwires in their IMF (inframammary fold, also referred to as the breast root). Sometimes a bra that's the wrong shape for you in the bottom of the cup won't be able to fit into your IMF either.   Freya bras tend to have stretchy enough bands that you can sister-size down in the band. So don't be afraid to try 36 bands in Freya. You'll need to go one cup size up - since you're measuring at 38GG, the sister size would be 36H.   Could you take a look at the shape guide and let us know what shape you think your breasts are? It's okay if you're not sure."
ABraThatFits,3dve3x,rynia_,2,Sun Jul 19 21:06:19 2015 UTC,"Your illustration is pretty true for me also. I think of my root as being where the blue line is, but my wires tend to fall where the red line is and I don't have a problem with that. My wires are comfortable on me. I guess that would make me narrow-rooted, but in practice I don't find that distinction to be helpful for me. I'm not going to seek out bras that follow that contour, which for me at least occurs because of being very pendulous and having lots of empty skin up top. I'm concerned with having the wires feel like they're in a comfortable spot and the cups and band fitting well.   You're probably close-set and your larger breast is encroaching on the gore and pushing that wire forward over top of the other. Does that sound like what's happening?"
ABraThatFits,3dve3x,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:10:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's the wire that belongs to the larger side that's moving in front of the other one. That side also tried to poke me in the armpit every once in a while yesterday. I had thought maybe it was getting torqued by the other end of itself moving out front"
ABraThatFits,3dve3x,Goddess_Keira,2,Mon Jul 20 04:27:00 2015 UTC,"I had thought maybe it was getting torqued by the other end of itself moving out front   That sounds plausible. I can't remember if you've tried any Elomi bras yet? They have really wide wires, so that may not work for you, but it's also possible that they'll fit differently enough that you won't get that poking effect. You might want to see how you do in what you have now before ordering others, though. You could try putting a flat cotton pad (like the kind used to remove makeup) between the wire and your skin, to see if that helps the poking at all."
ABraThatFits,3dve3x,vonlowe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:04:25 2015 UTC,"I think it was you who suggested I try Elomi in an earlier post :)  I ordered an Elomi Caitlyn and a Sculptresse Chi-chi, but they haven't arrived so I don't know about either of those yet. I'll have to give the pad trick a try tomorrow."

ABraThatFits,3dvacf,Confusedbra,3,Sun Jul 19 20:34:20 2015 UTC,Is it possible you have breast tissue under that area in the wires which is why it digs and hurts?
ABraThatFits,3dvacf,Moonforehead,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:19:09 2015 UTC,"Now that I tried them on again I think that yes the tip of the wire ended partly where there's still breast tissue, not following the shape of the bottom/middle edge of the bra. It's too much of a narrow U-shape compared to what the bra looks like on the outside.  If that makes any sense. :)"
ABraThatFits,3dvacf,Moonforehead,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:38:43 2015 UTC,Yeah I get that. Maybe the cups are too wide in general or maybe you need a smaller gore?
ABraThatFits,3dvacf,rainydayseveryday,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:41:47 2015 UTC,"The cups fit quite well near the armpits though, so I was thinking of ""wider"" but not fuller cups. But how does that work in terms of sizing? Or is that thinking flawed? Or maybe that's what you mean with a smaller gore? Though there's also the conflict that my boobs are quite far apart, and the middle of my chest is just flat, or well the edge of my ribcage is slightly protruding under my breasts. So a smaller gore would mean a lot of empty cup space?"
ABraThatFits,3dvacf,alidieux,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:58:01 2015 UTC,"If you bend the wires out it can help sometimes. I guess it helps if it's not so bad that it leaves bruising first. I had a bra that bruised me from the gore, and bending didn't help as much as other bras. I've acquired 7 bras, all of the gores dig, all of the cups are the right size.   If the gore doesn't sit completely flat, it's either cups that are too small or cups that are too shallow. Those are the most common reasons."

ABraThatFits,3dvacf,EmmaInFrance,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:44:32 2015 UTC,"Today I actually visited a local bra shop that claim that they aim to have something for every size and shape. When I walked in, I asked for 65 bands. But no. Every size and shape starts from 70 ;)   Change was actually next door, I went there too and they had one bra of 65C (all others were 65D or larger) and only one bra was a 60 and that was the wrong cup. Nevertheless at least I got to try it on, and 60 didn't actually feel too tight either. On the other hand the 65s I tried were not as tight as in some other shops/brands, and I read some local reviews that you can't necessarily determine your band or cup size in Change since the sizes tend to run small. Have you any experience of that, how the sizes compare to other brands/stores?"

ABraThatFits,3ducyp,Moonforehead,2,Sun Jul 19 16:09:40 2015 UTC,Snug was 40.5.
ABraThatFits,3ducyp,LadyVerene,2,Sun Jul 19 16:16:57 2015 UTC,Yeah then I'd go for 40D/DD. try some stretchy band brands like freya but if 40s are too tight sister size to a 42C/D depending on what cup size you end up being more comfortable in.
ABraThatFits,3ducyp,Moonforehead,7,Sun Jul 19 16:44:48 2015 UTC,Bands in this size range tend to be very stretchy as a rule. 42 would almost certainly be far too loose and even 40s would probably be on the looser side.
ABraThatFits,3ducyp,goodoldfreda,3,Sun Jul 19 17:00:32 2015 UTC,Ah alright. I'm not in that spectrum which is why I suggested 40s to start and 42 if 40s prove to be to be too tight. So do you think a 38 would be stretchy enough?
ABraThatFits,3ducyp,Moonforehead,6,Sun Jul 19 17:02:53 2015 UTC,"Not the same person, but a 38 would probably be large enough because they often stretch to ~40""."

They do a pretty good job of locking the girls down, but they aren't magical and I do get some bounce for high impact cardio (like plyo workouts). They are compression sports bras, and the center does not lay flat on my sternum, but they still work pretty well. People also really like the Panache wired sports bra, although I didn't like it that much (gore didn't tack, and it just felt weird on).  It might be helpful to work on figuring out shape in terms of wide/narrow roots, projection, etc. This makes such a HUGE difference in fit - you could be in the exact right size in the wrong shape bra and feel completely uncomfortable."
ABraThatFits,3dv2j4,realspectacular,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:00:01 2015 UTC,I have an Anita nursing bra that I love. Did the boutiques you tried carry nursing bras? Or can they order some for you to try?
ABraThatFits,3dv2j4,AcidStarRuin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:56:32 2015 UTC,Yeah.. They do carry but not in 32 band size and half of the time didn't had the h cups. I want to try on several styles in a 32 h/hh nursing bra but all they try is to sell their stuff telling me about converting 34 or 36 bras in the styles they have if the cup fits..it's so annoying when I asked them about my real size- no clear answer from them and one went to the extent that problem is that I'm nursing and thus sore and not their bra but never suggested a real bra style to suit my needs.
ABraThatFits,3dv2j4,AcidStarRuin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:21:55 2015 UTC,"That's so frustrating. I honestly just lived in nursing camis until about 3.5 months post-partum. That's when I finally felt like I was regulated enough to invest in quality bras before going back to work.   Also I just remembered since I'm wearing it. Cake makes a sports style nursing bra that's quite comfortable though I haven't worked out in it.   I'm currently a 36G (UK sizing) and I wear a Medium cake sports bra. They sell them at Nordstrom (in fact it was the only nursing bra my store had in stock, every thing is online).   I hope you find something that works soon."

However, when I'm actually trying those size bras, it just looks weird in me. ... Apart from these, I've tried countless bras in other brands and never felt comfortable.   How does it look weird? Which bras did you try in those sizes?  Can you make a list, brand, model, size, what did not fit where?  A good strategy at this point would be to order one bra in several sizes and use it to determine your size. Panache Andorra Fullcup is a good one for this, it is great for nursing moms too."

You could try bending the tips of the underwires outward at the gore to relieve the pressure, but if cups all up in your underarms is a dealbreaker, don't bother.  Based on how Jude fits, I wonder if the Freya slips down out of your IMF because the wires are too narrow? Bratabase says they are just a bit narrower than Jude's.   Cleo Neve and Cleo Koko are successors to Jude that are supposed to fit better in general, but are still really wide and shallow. Perhaps they would work better for you? Be aware that Neve has a very tight band if you decide to try it."

The prices are pretty good and there's a sale on right now. You'd want a UK size 8 (US 4 I think?). The bra sized things like some babydolls tend be quite firm but they only do 30B-DD and 32A-G in small bands but that probably doesn't matter if it's in the bedroom and some of the sexy things are labelled as the clothing size with a cup size e.g. 8D-DD and the rest would just be size 8.

How does it fit if you wiggle the bottom front of the bra upwards?   If you're a more shallow shape, maybe check out Curvy Kate. I'm not familiar enough with the Jude to make specific recommendations, but bratabase lists some similar fits. I have a CK Smoothie which looking at your pictures, might work nicely."

ABraThatFits,3du9zm,otterhugs,6,Mon Jul 20 00:36:12 2015 UTC,"The Cleo neve is the most similar cut to the Jude, the Jude was the original and was discontinued two years ago and the neve replaced it (and I believe the koko is replacing the neve) You're like the second person I've ever seen the Jude work for, on most people its a disaster which is why it's still easy to find it even two years after its been discontinued. My recommendation is if you like the Jude, is to buy a few more now and stock up (assuming you're not expecting any changes to your breast size any time soon)."

It's also pretty closed off on the insides and tops of the cups, causing quadboob in even fairly shallow people.  It's pretty much terrible on most people because of that.  I'd be interested to see photos, not because I'm a creep but just because I've never seen it work on anyone who's not extremely shallow, and it's pretty uncommon to be extremely shallow in your size range.

ABraThatFits,3du9zm,Prettyncharmuese,9,Sun Jul 19 18:13:25 2015 UTC,"You're not shallow at all, but this bra is very shallow.  And it's not sitting where it should be.  The underwires are not sitting in your IMF at all, they're well below it.  Eventually the foam cups in this bra will fold over there.  I don't think you have wide roots either, I think the wires in this bra are too wide for you and - probably as a result of the wire width - it also looks to be pushing you east-west, instead of keeping things centered in front.  Honestly, I wouldn't call this a good fit on you, but if you like it, there's no bra police.  Try to pull those wires all the way up to the bottom of your breast as far as they'll go, and see if they'll stay there.  I would be surprised if they do, and would be curious to see how the cup fits differently with the wires pulled up.  Edit - I doubt your quadboob problems are coming from being wide-rooted.  I suspect they're coming from bras that are too small or too shallow or otherwise the wrong shape.  I would call you narrow-average rooted, evenly full on top/bottom, and very much projected."
ABraThatFits,3dvx6o,spotlesstuff,2,Sun Jul 19 23:48:36 2015 UTC,"28DD sounds like a good place to start in my opinion. In the US, it will be nearly impossible to find this size in person, unfortunately. Amazon is a good option.   If you haven't taken a look at the shallow guide, I would start there as they have put together a big list of bras that have a good chance of working for you. The Cleo Juna looks fairly basic to me (I think it comes in beige-y colors?) and it is good for shallow shapes. The band is supposed to be a bit soft and the cup small, so you might want to get it in 28DD and 28E at the same time if you can afford to try them both."

ABraThatFits,3dvx6o,SexyGeniusGirl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:04:13 2015 UTC,I see lots of 30D and 30DDs at Nordstrom :) It's good to be able to try on bras to figure out your shape. I recommend the Natori Feathers for shallow wide rooted boobs (this is me). I got my first bra in 30dd at Nordstrom and they gave me about 8 bras to try on in that size. Good luck!
ABraThatFits,3dtuu5,nidena,22,Sun Jul 19 12:15:15 2015 UTC,"A strong focus on how things like asymmetry, pendulous, ""small,"" and ""too big"" breasts are all normal things that many grown women experience and none of them mean you ""can't wear"" the bras you'd like to, and none of them mean you aren't absolutely perfect and healthy. So, so many people I know had such a hard time in their early teens dealing with self esteem about this.  And from what I've seen on this sub, I think a ""how to talk to your mom/other guardian about proper bra size"" would be useful too, since this age range probably can't go get their bras themselves.  And most of what is concentrated on for fit in this sub is, well, kind of useless at that age. They're not done growing. I mean you could certainly mention ""what to look out for"" stuff like projection and fullness. Most important is proper sizing, sister sizing (since many will likely be non-standard), and where to get their bras. Bras that properly fit young teens are kind of hard to find, so make sure you do a lot of research about where to go for tiny back small cup young girls' bras."
ABraThatFits,3dtuu5,ondrurylane,15,Sun Jul 19 12:42:07 2015 UTC,"[edit: fixed formatting]  I'm trying to remember how I felt as a tween about my boobs...  a) focus on the wide variety of boobs out there and that they all are OK.   b) proper fit of the bra (gore sticks, no quadboob, no lifting back etc). I usually do a jump or two to see how they hold to impromptu movement (sprinting for the bus, commuting by bike).  c) proper ballparking their size. If their underbust is 29"", how can a 32"" underbust provide support? You wouldn't wear trousers several sizes too big just because people told you to. Explain how sizes vary between companies, so that they look for the fit rather than the number.  d) encourage them to have at least one day bra, no matter how small they are. My mum for the longest time claimed I didn't need a bra, so I took an older friend shopping.   e) at that age I believe sport is still compulsory at school. Encourage them to have at least one sports bra, maybe show them the video (I think made by ShockAbsorber) on how free boobs move.   f) bra care. I'm guessing they'll all chuck them into washing machine and tumble dryer. Explain how it affects the bras.   g) an idea occurred to me: teach them to get to know, and look after their boobs. Basically the self examination for breast cancer prevention - the sooner they get in the habit, the better. Even if it's just knowing how their boobs look / how they feel and to look out for anything new / abnormal. That they are likely to be tender / larger during periods.   h) given Snapchat, maybe also mentioning the ""don't send nudes with your face / recognisable marks to anyone"" rule...?  i) if there are any obvious tomboys or girls with body dysmorphia (think shapeless clothes) encourage them to wear sports bras as their daily bras. These provide support and often have binding effect. At that age I had boobs, but I hated having a chest, being brought up with the idea that women encourage rape by showing off their curves. Between 12 and 17 I pretty much only wore baggy t-shirts to hide my boobs.   If you have a local shop that sells a wide range of sizes, maybe team up with them - see if they'd open after hours for your so you can show the girls what's out there, they could try things on, maybe ask the store for a discount for them...?"
ABraThatFits,3dtuu5,picknmixme,11,Sun Jul 19 14:43:58 2015 UTC,"I think the normalization of breasts would be helpful. I remember thinking I was a freak because one breast is bigger than the other, and because I have bumps around the nipples ( I can't remember what those are called). It wasn't until I had access to the internet that I learned about these things. So I would have been in my late teens or early twenties."
ABraThatFits,3dtuu5,deedeethecat,6,Sun Jul 19 13:40:16 2015 UTC,"I not sure how this could be approached in the workshop, but definitely something that reminds the younger girls it's ok if you need a bra before junior high. I was wearing Jockey bralettes at 9 in 3rd grade and needed non underwire bras by 5th. I wore a baby doll juniors section shirt from Old Navy one day and no one would talk to me. An older neighbor girl confessed to me on the bus people thought I was trying to show off my boobs! I was in 5th grade and totally naive to that idea! Boys were still dumb and gross! (Still dumb at 30 sometimes hah.) So for the next 2 years I only wore baggy unisex t-shirts, free ones my mom got at work, souvenir shirts, and the like to hide it. It took until the middle of 7th grade at 13 before I wore anything more fitted in the top again. By then I remember being the only girl in the locker room in real bras, the other girls were in those same Jockey bralettes I wore in 3rd grade. I was always so ashamed or embarrassed that I had boobs so early. By 8th grade a lot of girls finally caught up and started making fun of me for being flat as a board. To which again I went home crying to my mom who was getting ready for implants (oh great I got your small boobs that you're saying aren't good enough?!) and she told me those friends were only bigger than me because they were in 38-40A and that meant they had fat backs (great messaging mom is this how you dealt with it?). Girls are cruel in that age bracket. Moms often still carry their own baggage if they had the same size/shape issues as a teen.  By high school I don't remember any one being a jerk about sizes so maybe by then we all knew what we were dealt genetically. But maybe a strong message that everyone is going to be in different phases for those 4-5 years and try to be sensitive to the early/late ones. Odds are if you're getting boobs at 10 you're also going to be dealing with period supplies in an elementary school bathroom that is open to the hallway with no doors and loud ass crinkling wrappers and no stall trash cans because children don't need that right?  Ugh puberty sucked so hard."

We only have a few reviews of sticky bras, but one that seems to be pretty good is the Tidetell V-Wing Sticky Bra. It's got fabric on the outside rather than being adhesive all over (which many sticky bras seem to be), and you can stick the cups onto your boobs however you like to create the amount of cleavage that feels best for you. I'm guessing the small would work best for you, but measurements will help us double check that."

Turns out when you wear a cup size that is too small, as many women do, the underwire ends up sitting on breast tissue and it's reeeeally uncomfortable, which is why a lot of women don't want to wear them at all! A better-suited size can make a huge difference.  Of course there are also women who, even in a supportive size that is a good fit, don't like underwires, and that's fine too.  :)"
ABraThatFits,3dtzc8,laylee_56,4,Sun Jul 19 13:16:47 2015 UTC,"Cleo Kali is a clone of the Lucy, which is designed for breasts that are more full-on-bottom. If it doesn't cut into your breasts at the top, then I don't think that the Marcie (which is designed for full-on-top breasts) will work for you. It will be much more open on top, and I think it has a little less immediate projection. You could try the Cleo Lily/Erin though. It is for narrow, projected even breasts, and has a fairly narrow gore."

ABraThatFits,3dtzc8,Shanakitty,3,Sun Jul 19 19:31:02 2015 UTC,"Ok, so I guess the Kali is a bit more open on top than the Lucy. Maybe you could try the Panache Envy? It could be too narrow too. Depending on your size (they work best if you're no bigger than a 34G/GG or so), Freya's unlined balconnettes are also fairly projected and are often full-on-bottom friendly, but I think they also run fairly narrow (but with softer wires than you get with Panache/Cleo at least). I am not sure of too many bras besides the Lucy/Kali that are wide-ish and projected. Perhaps someone else will have some ideas. It would be helpful to know your size though."

She thinks that because a model online is practically (if photoshopped) spilling out of the top of the bra, it only covers half her boob. When I mentioned demi cups, she seriously thought her nipple would be hanging out.   Not to mention she believes she's a 34A, and that she has to wear tiny bralettes that she, somehow, manages to shove her boobs into. When in reality she's a 32D, but just won't believe it. Or spend the money on a good bra. She loves that her padded bralettes are $12. It's so stupidly frustrating."

My mum rolled her eyes when I first told her about measuring and brafitting and I was telling her she was wearing the wrong size. They will just say, ""The fitter at x said I was this size and I think they'd know!"" Show her the brabandproject! And see if you can find a before/after thread. Mums need physical proof, otherwise they won't believe.    When I was first finding out my real size and told her I bought a 32H/10H, she said, ""Are you crazy! You can't possibly be that big in the cup!"" And then I put it on and showed her how the gore tacked and it fit perfectly and her eyes nearly fell out of her head. She couldn't argue with the proof and then she got me to measure her. She went from a 38F to a 36H overnight. Mum has helped my bravangelise my sister, my aunties, her friends... it's great.      We also nagged my nana/her mum, who said, quite concerned, ""A 32 band is very small! Like for very skinny girls. Even I was never a 32 band when I was doing ballet as a young lady!"" And I explained how bra fitting had changed and mum backed me up, and now she has gone down a band size (only one, so it's still comfortable) and up a cup size volume."
ABraThatFits,3dsde7,senkidala,14,Sun Jul 19 03:32:39 2015 UTC,"The thing is, she's seen me in my 30E bras (when they fit, I might actually need to go up a cup size or two, my boobs haven't stopped yet!) and she believes that that is my size, but can't put two and two together and realize that her boobs are bigger than mine proportionally yet she's wearing a smaller cup size! I'd probably put my mom at around a 34H or HH from looking at the babandproject, but she doesn't really care about or want to look at things bra-related that I want to show her because she's so sure of her size being what it's not!  When we first went to Dillards she immediately went to the fitter and said, ""Well, she thinks she's a 30DD (my size from first measuring) so can you measure her?"""
ABraThatFits,3dsde7,senkidala,13,Sun Jul 19 03:53:06 2015 UTC,"Oh man, that sounds so frustrating. How can she argue with something that fits you?! Have you taken her to Nordstrom?

It's my favourite to show people because it explains fit issues very simply and shows someone that most people wouldn't think would be an FF, yet the bra fits really well.    You could make a deal with her. Say, ""I'll try on a bra that the fitter wants to put me in, if you try on a bra that I fit you in"", so you can point out what fits well/badly. Once the right size is on and she's comfortable, she might come around. She sounds pretty stubborn, though."

She knows I'm just as budget-conscious as she is, so she isn't worried about me ordering bras every 5 seconds. I've only bought 4, and two of them were covered by money I received for Christmas!  I'm about to begin the complicated task of bravangelizing my grandma, which is sure to be even harder. She asked me where I bought my bras and if I could help her get some bras like the ones I have, but of course she has no idea how complex this question really is! She doesn't want wires, which is understandable as older ladies often don't want quite as much pressure on their ribcages. She's also healing from a very lengthy respiratory infection, which has caused her rib pain right near her IMF for the past 6 weeks (she did a lot of coughing). I don't know how that's going to heal, and I definitely don't think she'd be able to handle underwires for a while."

She let me measure her but she insisted she couldn't be a 32F, and that her 34DD VS cotton bras fit really well. So, I dropped it for a bit.  When I initially started replacing my stuff, she took one of my stretched out 30F Freya longlines. It's not the best fit on her since the gore sits on her tissue, but it was an improvement and I let her carry on.  Then I bought myself an Avocado that I figured wouldn't fit me, but it'd fit her. Showed it to her, tried it on for her, bemoaned that it just was too big. She thought it was pretty, so she tried it on. Surprise! Perfect fit. I told her to take it, she needed new bras anyway and she should try this before spending more money at VS. She didn't like that it was unlined, but she said she'd try it. I also gave her an EM SM and an EM S at this time.  Two weeks later she called me and said she was handwashing them and they were still damp when she was getting ready for work. So, she put on her ""well fitting"" VS 34DD cotton bra, looked in the mirror and thought to herself that she couldn't wear that in public.   She was eager for new bras and new information after that, got herself some more Ewa and Comexim and has kissed those VS bras goodbye.  She still has my old Freya though, but that's okay. She really loves it and it's not a great fit, but it's passable. And now she's passing on the word at work and wants all of her lady friends and co-workers properly measured and fitted.  So, it's not hopeless. It takes time though. I started wearing ABTF almost three years ago, and my mom is just coming around.  You could stealth fit her like I did my mom. The whole ""oh I bought this for me, but it's too big so you try"" thing. Cut the size label out if she'd refuse on the grounds of sticker shock."

Yes, it is way better than your old stuff and so you are reluctant to change, but until you tried on a bra that truly fits you just don't know what you are missing.

Goddess Keira comes in wireless, but not in this size range. Ditto for Elila Lace.   Note that your mother's aversion to wires might come from wearing the wrong size. Wires in 40D are significantly smaller than in UK 40HH, so they pinch and poke. I used to think wires were evil torture devices until I found a bra with the correct wire width.   Think of it like shoes - if you are wearing shoes that are several sizes too small you'll end up prefering flipflops and socks over sneakers and loafers. It is only when you try shoes in the correct size and width you realise that proper shoes can be comfortable - and even better than flipflops or socks.   Some good candidates to try would be Elomi bras with soft wires. Bras that I know to have soft wires are Maggie, Evie and Jocelyn.

ABraThatFits,3dsde7,snowlights,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:44:09 2015 UTC,"My mom let me measure her, and she acknowledges that her current bras are horrible but she is wary of buying online. She had no idea about the scooping and swooping and did have some sticker shock about her size. I'm betting that once I get ABTF and show her, she's going to be excited to get a better fitting bra for herself. (I haven't been able to because of financial reasons.)  My sister on the other hand, let me measure her, but totally blew me off when I tried to explain that her current size (US 44DDD) was way off and what she needs is closer to UK 44H. She understands scooping and swooping, but as soon as she's done doing that, she yanks on the bra and puts it on top of breast tissue. She's got such major quad-boob that it hurts to think about."
ABraThatFits,3dsp0d,MutantToenail,5,Sun Jul 19 02:11:24 2015 UTC,"I have to wear bras that just pretend the majority of my boobs don't exist. I let them stop like half an inch to an inch past my nipple like they want to, and then the rest of my boob secretly exists above it, pretending to be cleavage. So basically I need stuff that's insanely open on top, since my boobs are still happening. There are not a lot of things that fit the bill.  What works:  --Ewa Michalak CHP. Glorious, and the push-up pads at the bottom make up for my lack of bottom fullness.   --Ewa Michalak S. It's basically the CHP but the shape isn't perfect because the apex is too high. Eh. For some reason I'm so much more able to find these than CHPs, so I take what I can get. Same deal with the push-up pads.  --Masquerade Rhea. I still don't really understand how this one works on me since it's infamously shallow on the bottom and I need a ton of immediate projection, but it actually slips out of my IMF the least of any of my bras. I think the shallowness is happy to just go totally vertically, following my boob, so it doesn't even try to be projected enough, if that makes any sense at all.  --Masquerade Georgiana. Same deal.  --Freya Deco Plunge. There's stuff about how some of the versions cut in more at the top than others. Maybe it's because of my size range, but I've never noticed this, and they've all worked pretty will with my roots. I'm sure the Half-Cup would work well too but I haven't found one in my size.  --Cleo Melissa is my best of my unlineds, but it still cuts in some at the top and I dream about cutting through the lace like a crazed person."
ABraThatFits,3dsp0d,wayward_sun,5,Sun Jul 19 02:40:01 2015 UTC,"Sorry for going on a tangent rather than answering your question but... This is a thing? This would explain so much. I've always considered myself extremely short-breasted but maybe this describes me better... At certain angles (like when I lie on my side, or wear badly-fitting extreme push-up bras) my breast tissue can ""squish"" upwards nearly up to my collarbone - but 99.5% of the time, there is literally none even remotely close to that high and it only extends maybe 3 to 3.5 inches above my IMF at the highest, and the vast majority of bras are way too tall for me and wrinkle at the top, yet somehow every test indicates that I have even projection. It doesn't even make logical sense when I think about it, but does this sound like you too?"
ABraThatFits,3dsp0d,adulaire,3,Sun Jul 19 05:25:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, my breasts LOOK like they are average height and extremely FOB but they are actually even. The top half is just mostly invisible stealth boobs. The tissue is always there, though, you just can't see it unless I squish. I can feel it though when I poke my upper chest.  This means I can't really just wear FOB bras because the top edge cuts in. Common knowledge says our boobs don't exist, but I've been hearing this description from other people on here a little more often so I hope we can figure out some bras that work."
ABraThatFits,3dsp0d,goodoldfreda,2,Sun Jul 19 05:32:56 2015 UTC,"My tall roots are pretty shallow, so most open on top stuff gaps hugely and most closed on top stuff fits well but cuts in right at the top. Thank the lawd for Comexim, their bras are pretty much the perfect height for me."
ABraThatFits,3dsp0d,adulaire,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:25:37 2015 UTC,"Hm. In a way I'm the opposite since I look totally even and can only wear short/FOB bras or I get absolutely awful wrinkling/gapping - I guess that's because you have more up above than me? Mine can hardly be felt even if you poke I directly, it really only decides to exist at very specific angles, but it's always bothered me because, like... why is it coming and going like that?   This is super interesting, thanks. We really should talk more about this - I honestly was under the impression I was the only one, who knows how many more of us are out there though! :)"

ABraThatFits,3dsp0d,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:47:22 2015 UTC,"Sorry I wasn't clear - what I meant to say is that it can change in a matter of seconds depending on my bodily position. My breasts seem very short when I'm standing or sitting down, which is most of the time - so short that hardly any bras fit without gapping or top wrinkling. But then if I bend over at the waist or lie on my side, I appear to have very tall breasts, with cleavage almost up to my collarbones! It almost seems like there's, like, an empty pocket of skin that my tissue can just squish up into...? I have no idea if this is normal or really bizarre and sorry if that was a gross description!"
ABraThatFits,3dsp0d,adulaire,2,Sun Jul 19 05:59:12 2015 UTC,"No, this is very normal! Tissue sliding around underneath the skin is something that we've been investigating here recently - it seems that mostly smaller-busted ladies around here have it. It's like my breast tissue responds to the call of gravity, but my skin didn't get the memo so it just moves out of the way. My IMF appears to be about an inch lower than it actually is without a bra because breast tissue covers it up from the inside out. This also happens (to a lesser degree) when I lean over - then all the tissue rushes up to the top and smacks into my collarbones. In a bra my boobs exist between these two extremes. They're basically even, with the tissue being held in place by the underwires at my actual IMF. This also ends up making them more projected as well, because the breast tissue can't spread out quite as far vertically thanks to the underwires."
ABraThatFits,3dsp0d,adulaire,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:43:42 2015 UTC,"That's interesting! Mine are super narrow and self-supporting so I don't have quite the same situation as you but as far as the tall/short direction absolutely!

ABraThatFits,3dsp0d,M_tridactyla,3,Sun Jul 19 17:20:39 2015 UTC,"Mine are 32FF/G, tall and narrow. I live in Polish half-cups. Nice and projected for the lower half of my boobs, wires not too wide, and then, like, /u/wayward_sun says, we just agree to ignore the top half of my boobs.  Cleo Marcie is flexible enough to work. The Marcie clones are hit and miss - much as I love polka dots, the Zia doesn't work; Ellis is better. Panache Jasmine is a tad too projected for me but works otherwise. I suspect Envy and Andorra would be better but I'm picky about wire width so I haven't tried. Freya half-cups are too wide but good otherwise, Cleo Juna was surprisingly successful in terms of wire width and projection.  Some Ewa SMs work, depending on how open and flexible the embroidery is. Fullcups and plunges can work if the top matches my boob slope exactly, but that's hit and miss. Elle MacPherson Artistry is way too wide but the loose top part is very forgiving of tall roots.  One weird thing I've noticed is that I don't have to size up in some bras that run small for most people, like CHPs and the Cleo Juna. I can even wear CHPs that are technically a size too small now and the gore still tacks. Does this happen for anyone else? I guess the extra boob just hangs out above the bra, and the cup is open enough not to quadboob."
ABraThatFits,3dsp0d,cupcakery,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:12:02 2015 UTC,"I've definitely found that I can be flexible in terms of sizing. I measure (and fit very well) in 32Es, but if I find a style I want, I'll buy it in a 30F/FF, 32E/F, 34DD, and give or take a few hooks they always fit fine once they're on. (But for some reason 30Es and 34Es are always no-gos, lol.

ABraThatFits,3dsp0d,cupcakery,2,Sun Jul 19 02:11:52 2015 UTC,"I have very tall roots compounded by pectoral muscles. I'm shallow to possibly slightly projected, wide-rooted, even, and usually wear 32E-F.   Bras that fit (pretty well at least) for me include Victoria's Secret Body By Victoria Unlined Demi in lace (not microfiber; that one cuts in), Curvy Kate Roxie, Parfait Casey, Parfait Jeanie, DKNY Perfect Demi in microfiber (model 453266), and b.Tempt'd Sheer Delight.  Cleo Marcie is okay. The top edge runs into my tall root a bit and wrinkles the lace, and the wires are a little too narrow. I also prefer a taller wire or taller cup adjacent to the wing.  Freya Patsy-family halfcups are disappointing. 32E is too narrow and a touch too small, and 32F is too deep.  Edit: The Harlow bra by Felina comes in a crap range of sizes (32-40 B-E), but it's super open on top, and deeper than other things I've tried (hence it doesn't fit me). Perhaps it's a godsend for someone else in matrix sizing who needs both depth and an open top."
ABraThatFits,3dsp0d,_veritas,2,Sun Jul 19 02:29:00 2015 UTC,"I also have mega tall roots and a ton of projection. I just tried the freya deco again for the first time in a couple years and it was sadness. I was hoping it would stay in my IMF for more than .3 seconds but alas, it crumpled under my projection needs. My best fits right now are the Panache Jasmine and envy. Dat stretch lace. Mmmmm. :)  I'm leaning toward 30FF these days due to a hormonal bc change and I'm dying for a nude seamless (or at least padded seamed) nude option with enough projection and open top. Recently tried the parfait Casey and Jeanie and the edges rolled out too much to make them really wearable. (What's the point of wearing a seamless bra if you can see the edge of it literally all the time?) I make do with the Fantasie Rebecca but it makes my boobs look sad. :( I know it's time for Poland but I'm still apprehensive."
ABraThatFits,3dsp0d,wayward_sun,2,Sun Jul 19 04:55:22 2015 UTC,I kind of just live with the crumpling in some bras. I'm starting wonder if I should reevaluate that.  What do you think of the Panache Porcelains? I found one that kind of worked but the bands don't go small enough.
ABraThatFits,3dsp0d,oooh_snappp,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:26:33 2015 UTC,Definitely way too shallow. Worse than the decos IMO and more closed on top too. I only tried the porcelain viva though to ymmv? But in general they're fairly shallow.

ABraThatFits,3dsp0d,brafithelp,2,Sun Jul 19 18:59:12 2015 UTC,"So I was super bored and thought this might be helpful. I took a picture of myself, sitting down (laziness, but it doesn't make much of a difference in how the boobs look), facing to the side, and traced it. So there's no actual boob in this picture because I erased all that. Just an outline diagram thing.  http://imgur.com/AXJafuq nipple and belly button are purple to get you acclimated.   So if I do a hand bra thing, that whole line up to my shoulder kind of ""puffs out"" the way all the other breast tissue does, up past my collarbone and well into where my armpit because my shoulder. From the front, it looks like I have pretty impressive cleavage, especially for my side, all the time, even when the boobs are free and not bra-ed, hand or otherwise. In activity that would make your boobs jiggle, I jiggle up to my collarbone, and not in some reverb time of way. I'm saying this all to help anyone who's a little confused by boobs this style understand that this is actual breast tissue, not some optical breast illusion, haha.  Also, if you look at what boob there is underneath the nipple, you can see the little tucking in thing that my boob does against my body, and how my IMF goes sort of diagonally up rather than straight across, and not just when it has boob-weight making it hard to see or whatever. The degree of immediate projection means my boobs don't go straight out, but straight UP. So it's a very very tricky place to fill. For a bra to fit nice and snugly into my IMF and stay there, it would really need the cup to barely--if at all--touch my actual chest wall, because there's no way the bottom of a cup could simultaneously sit well on my standard horizontal torso and my dramatically angled-up boob all at the same time.   tl;dr: Tall roots are kind of hard to see/understand if you're new to them, and while finding bras open enough at the top can be a challenge for us, there are bras that fit the bill. The big problem, at least in sm/m cup volumes like mine, is finding bra shapes that compensate for the fact that, because the breast tissue isn't where it's expected to be, understand that I don't have the under-nipple boob that the bra has room for. So, if I understand myself right, what I really would need is a bra that's a smaller cup-size on the bottom and a larger cup-size on top, that would average to hold the same amount of boob but not expect the boob tissue to be evenly distributed.   okay that was still tl;dr, so shorter: I'm still really looking for a bra that's comfortable by the end of the day, and that doesn't end up way down on my ribcage because the wires can't go up fast enough.  But hey, the permanent cleavage thing is pretty cool."

I mean I'm not too bothered by the gaping but still would be cool to find something that fit 100% :P  As for polish, I have a Samanta that people recommended me going down a cup size in but now I just think it didn't fit because I just didn't have enough upper fullness boob to fill it out, and I had a 65GG SM trefl once upon a time that I stupidly sold when I was just starting out, which I also didn't fill out at the top back then, which makes me real confused for sizing since it seems I have to size down in polish but then I'm scared to not have enough projection."
ABraThatFits,3du002,hellebora,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:41:53 2015 UTC,"Maybe try halfcups? If you can find one in your size, Masquerade Rhea might work, but I think you'd need to size down in the cup.    I mostly stick to EM, and quite like the CHP and S styles. Either could work for you, but I think the CHP is a bit more likely.    Kris Line has lots of projection, but you'd still have the spare fabric at the top of the cup."

ABraThatFits,3dqxmc,Julez22,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:30:46 2015 UTC,"Sticker shock happens. It's entirely normal, promise! What also seems to be the norm is dropping down a band size or two and going up a few cup sizes when you measure yourself using the calculator; I rarely see the opposite happen. I guess we all just assume we're thicker/smaller chested than we really are.  Here are a few things that helped me push through with going through with ordering bras in my new size: first, the Bra Band Project helps give you an idea of what your size looks like. These are women wearing 30F bras.(Slightly NSFW) Next, try going out to try on bras. Nordstrom is great if you have access to one(they could actually have 30Fs), but barring that anywhere with a fitting room and a selection of bras will do. Find something with a 30 band, take it to the fitting room, and try it on backwards. That will take the cup size out of the equation and leave you with a good feel for how the band fits. Lastly, order your first bra through amazon, and make sure you're getting something covered under free returns. The sad truth is that you most likely WILL wind up returning/exchanging a few, so accepting that as an inevitability and taking it into account helps. ..Or at least, it helped me. :)"
ABraThatFits,3dqxmc,Julez22,2,Sun Jul 19 08:58:52 2015 UTC,Show her the difference between your past bra and this one! And get her to measure herself! Moulded bras aren't very telling about your shape but you might like the Cleo Marcie as well or also I think Cleo Juna and Deco strapless since it doesn't sound like you are very full on top.
ABraThatFits,3dqxmc,rado999,2,Sun Jul 19 02:44:19 2015 UTC,"She insists that the fancy French bra place is right and she's a 34D. Or 32D. I don't remember.  I'm pretty balanced, only slightly fuller on bottom. My only caveat about bras is that they can't have seams that show through shirts, nor bright colors. And I tend to find lace bits like the Marcie to be very itchy."
ABraThatFits,3dqxmc,SexyGeniusGirl,2,Sun Jul 19 02:48:33 2015 UTC,"Aw, too bad. Yeah I'm even/FOB as well. Maybe the Maddie would work for me...haven't tried it. But I like the Juna. I haven't found the seams to show through shirts, but maybe if you wear really thin shirts. No bright colors? I think it's worth it to try an unlined bra. They really are so comfortable and if you live somewhere colder (I live where most of the year I can wear sweaters) you don't have to worry about seams showing at all. The Deco is very moulded and unseamed so you might like it. Could you cut off the lace?"
ABraThatFits,3ds9ix,LittleBitsofStardust,5,Sat Jul 18 23:35:53 2015 UTC,"I see the calculator sized you at 46FF/G, meaning that either size might work, and the algorithm used does tend to rely too much on the leaning bust which can result in overestimating cup size. Your lying bust is probably more reliable, and using that I get 46FF for you; one cup size smaller than what you tried. Do you think that the Caitlyn was more than one cup size too big?  Otherwise, it's certainly true that Caitlyn is a tall bra and can be too much for a short torso. Elomi Etta is full coverage but is built more for a shorter torso than Caitlyn; you may want to try it in 46FF. The wires under the arm are shorter as well."
ABraThatFits,3ds9ix,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:01:26 2015 UTC,I cut wear Elomi because the gore goes up way past what is comfortable for me. Sorry I can't be more helpful.

ABraThatFits,3drqfy,becksisaunicorn,3,Sat Jul 18 20:39:17 2015 UTC,"None of the bras you tried are particularly friendly towards a narrow, projected shape. Non-Polish padded half cups rarely are, and IIRC the Anneliese is the same cut as the Curvy Kate Daily Boost, which is shallow and wide and works for very few people. The Rebecca I'm not sure about, but I know it has tall cups, which can cause gaping even in the right size.  If you're right about being narrow, projected, and even, Cleo Lily or Erin (can usually be found on Amazon) might work. I'd recommend starting at 38G.   EDIT Looking at your measurements again, 38GG would be good to try at the same time if you can find them with free returns."
ABraThatFits,3drqfy,braaccount,2,Sun Jul 19 02:18:48 2015 UTC,"If 36GG is gaping in the cup,  going up in the band and up 2 cup sizes to 38HH is definitely going to be too big on you.   If you want to go up to 38 band for comfort, the sister size to 36GG is 38G - remember if you go up in the band you go down in the cup to keep the same cup volume.   Since you have gaping you might need to go down in the cup as well? 36G or 38FF is one size down from 36GG.  Did you order from a place that allows returns? You could send them back and get a few different sizes, maybe even of the same brand. It sounds like Freya is the wrong shape for you, Fantasie might work if the cups were smaller, and Curvy Kate might have to go up in band and down in cup 1 or 2 cupsizes. I don't know about the Flirtelle, usually gore not tacking is cups too small. It could be too small band? Hard for me to say.  Sidenote, a lot of ladies recommend finding your size in a non-padded or non-moulded bra, but I like moulded styles too so I understand!"
ABraThatFits,3drqfy,ruby_saffron,2,Sat Jul 18 23:36:56 2015 UTC,"I agree with 38G as a starting point, but gaping isn't necessarily a sign of cups being too big, especially in padded bras. It can happen because of a shape mismatch (which I think is what's happening here in addition to the tight bands) or too-small cups as well."
ABraThatFits,3drltk,LadyVerene,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:58:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not in your size range (and I feel weird giving you advice at all since I'm such a noob lol), but I thought I'd throw my two cents in in case you find it helpful.  First - since I think Comexim is still on vacation, Zathiya has some bras in stock, bonus is that they include the UK size when you order (assuming they converted it correctly). So even if you decide not to order from Zathiya, you might check out their site to make sure you're on the right track for the sizes (sorry I cant help you with specific sizes).   Second - I have read that basic/wellfitting t-shirt runs one cup and band size small, and I would agree with that. My best fitting uk size is 32GG/H, and I tried a 34HH from wellfitting that was fine in the band and probably 2 cup sizes too small. For the other plunges, I have an Arizona plunge (from zathiya) in 75J which I would say fits very close to a loose UK 32h or a tight 34GG (comfortably stretches to ~33 inches). So maybe that will help you pick a size.  Third - I also have short roots (you can look at my previous fit checks if you want), and the Arizona in 75J definitely fits very well in the bottom 3/4 of the cup, but the top 1/4 does gape, especially on my smaller side. So I think reduced cups would benefit me greatly. They would probably be good for you as well, but I don't know if you want to try to figure out your size first. I do believe that comexim does custom for free. I will say that even though it's too tall, the bra is very comfy (and not jiggly like you would expect).  Hope this helps! Sorry I don't have better/more specific advice. Hopefully someone else with more experience will see this post. (I know  /u/buymeflowers  has helped me a lot and has good Comexim advice)"

(If I'm wrong, w_s, feel free to correct me!)  So there's need for immediate projection, but there's actually not a whole lot of fullness below her apex and most of it is higher on her breasts, due to the FOT-ness and tall roots.   On the flip side, I look more like this:  http://i.imgur.com/5hIj0tE.jpg  Lots of immediate projection needed as well, but since I have short roots, the tissue is in a much smaller space and so I've got much more lower fullness."

Of course looking at naked girls screwed up my self-confidence in other ways, because I was short and chubby and had large boobs that sagged instead of being all perky (which now I know is just a thing that happens and isn't bad but STILL), which is basically the opposite of the women you usually see in media, so I spent a loooooong time thinking I wasn't at all attractive.

ABraThatFits,3dro7r,MmkChelsea,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:19:47 2015 UTC,"30F looks like a great place to start. Since 32DD has the same volume cups as 30DDD (UK 30E), this is pretty darn close to the bra size you're currently wearing.   Different US bra manufacturers label their cup sizes differently after DD, so unfortunately there's no direct equivalent to UK 30F in US sizes. It will be a G in most US sizes, but not all. I find it's best to look to see if the number of D's are listed - 30F is 4D aka 30DDDD. If that's not listed, I look up the brand on this list or check their website and see what sizes they offer. If the brand carries 30DDD, UK 30F is the next size up. If they don't, UK 30F is two sizes up from 30DD and three sizes up from 30D.   Fullness is based on how your breasts act in a bra. Are you testing by holding your breasts in a ""hand bra"" or leaning over at a 90Â° angle?  As for close-set versus wide-set, how many fingers can you fit between your breasts at their closest point?  Have you tried scooping and swooping?"
ABraThatFits,3dro7r,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:55:40 2015 UTC,"I leaned over at a 90Â° angle. I must have missed the ""hand bra"" test...  With my bra off, I can fit one finger between them.  I just did the scoop and swoop and they seem to be falling out the top of my bra now.  The underwire in my bras don't seem to go all the way under my breast. Toward the middle, the wires seem to sit on the breast tissue (If that description even makes sense). I think that is why the gore will not touch."
ABraThatFits,3dro7r,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:21:33 2015 UTC,"Both the ""hand bra"" and 90Â° angle are good. I just wanted to make sure you weren't basing things off how your breasts look where they lay naturally.  One finger apart does make you close-set. You'll probably need to look for bras with lower gores in order to get the gores to tack properly - otherwise the gore might sit on your breast tissue once it's touching your skin and that's not a correct fit.   Are you open to ordering online or would you prefer to get bras in a store?"
ABraThatFits,3dro7r,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:35:21 2015 UTC,I am definitely open to ordering online. I figured I could probably find a better bra that way.
ABraThatFits,3dro7r,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:49:19 2015 UTC,"It's definitely easier to get 30 bands and UK brands online than in stores for most locations in the US. Nordstrom has a great range if there's one near you. You can also check the offline retailer list for boutiques in your area.   We typically recommend Cleo Lily or Cleo Erin for starting off when people think they have even fullness. Keep in mind that both these bras have gores on the high end for this size range, so the gores may sit on your breast tissue.  I always recommend Amazon for online bra buying. You can often get free shipping and sale prices on bras, and Amazon's customer service is great. There's also free returns on select bras, which you can find through here (sort via the sidebar Women > Clothing > Lingerie, Sleep & Lounge > Lingerie > Bras).   Other sites you can use include HerRoom, Bratabase, Zulily, FigLeaves, and EBay."
ABraThatFits,3doctj,DoTheTimeWarp,28,Fri Jul 17 22:30:30 2015 UTC,"It looks like you have flaired ribs (perfectly normal, lots of people do) and that one side is shaped differently and flares out more than the other, I have asymmetrical flared ribs too, though my asymmetry isn't very extreme. I don't think it's responsible for any of my back problems (mine come from really horrible posture and weak core muscles) .Its a source of self consciousness for me too, but I don't have any advice other than just try not to let it get to you too much. I've heard wearing a corset over time can compress your lower floating ribs, but my impression was that it would take years of wearing the corset daily and could revert back if you stopped wearing it regularly, so I didn't really see it as a realistic way to do anything about it, I'm just trying to accept it for what it is now ."

Have you tried bratabase, where people list bras for prices lower than retail and sometimes even free? You can also find bras on ebay that are listed lower than what they normally retail for, although they're not exactly brand new/never used. If you live near a Nordstrom or Dillards or an independent boutique you can go and try on bras, find a couple you like, write down the style numbers, and then look them up on the internet."

You may be interested in checking out Contour Corsets.  She specializes in custom and asymmetrical corsets for people with scoliosis, transgender people, and so on.  I'm sure she'd be happy to answer any questions you have about the process.  Just do make sure that you get a custom corset from a reputable source, whoever you end up going with.

ABraThatFits,3doctj,chickwithsticks,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:30:12 2015 UTC,"Not a doctor or an expert, but maybe your back issues are from posture? Do you think you might be slouching or something to hide your rib cage or breasts? Try working on exercises to strengthen your core. You might consider seeing a physiotherapist if a doctor has ruled out other problems for your back. My posture improved greatly after I saw one, and I look like I lost weight because I am standing differently now."
ABraThatFits,3doctj,yellkaa,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:34:11 2015 UTC,"As for your ribs issue, it may also be a kind of scoliosis or other spine issue: my sister has it, and her ribs are asymmetrical too. You may talk to your doctor about it if you want."
ABraThatFits,3dqm5b,Spacekittiesattack,6,Sat Jul 18 14:35:14 2015 UTC,"Hey - I'm in Canada too so I understand the pain in the buttness of shipping. Interesting thing is that Wacoal sizes US and the calculator sizes UK. I get 36F UK for your size, as a starting point (shape and style notwithstanding). That's equivalent to a US 36G. Now it remains to be seen if Wacoal works with your shape - I have narrow roots, close set breasts and lots of projection and they do NOT work for me. The wires are too wide, the shapes tend towards more shallow and they are very matronly on me. Don't be disappointed if it's not appealing to you (even if it does technically fit) or if it doesn't fit. You're just getting started. I think you may be asked more questions about the shape of your breasts and about what kind of shape you're looking to achieve in a bra. Often, depending on answers, Cleo Lucy or Marcie might be suggested as starter bras. You can find great deals on eBay (esp. via Belle-Lingerie or Mish Outlet) that won't break the bank, though it'll cost about 10 bucks to ship back what doesn't fit (and you should only buy if you'll get a full refund, what with still being in the figuring out stage). If you're in Toronto, there are boutiques that stock your size - Secrets from your Sister and Tryst are downtown."

As for breast shape, I wouldn't know where to begin to describe them? Haha. I guess I'll have to wait and see if I like the bra I purchased. I just hope it fits. I've tried on 36 bands before and they felt really tight. Is it because the cup was too small?"
ABraThatFits,3dqm5b,LadyVerene,2,Sat Jul 18 21:33:01 2015 UTC,"A too-small cup can definitely make a band feel tighter than it actually is, yes."

ABraThatFits,3dp2bz,Julez22,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:09:44 2015 UTC,I think any measurements she's going to take are going to be incredibly skewed based on how severe her pectus carinatum is.
ABraThatFits,3dp2bz,boba-boba,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:38:52 2015 UTC,That makes sense. I should've looked up what it is first. Do you have any recommendations?
ABraThatFits,3dp2bz,Julez22,2,Sat Jul 18 15:19:43 2015 UTC,"I'm no bra master at all but I wonder if those no underwire bras might help with any discomfort. Something like this one from Gossard if it fits your shape, and Wacoal has one that's more of a fuller cup.  I think as far as size goes, it might be worth trying to figure out what volume of a cup you need and then working on the band size after? I don't know how to figure it out, but I know Bratabase has you measure your entire boob from every angle, and depending on the bra you search by cup depth and go from there. I guess once you can figure out what depth of a cup you need you just have to adjust the band accordingly. Does that make any sense?"
ABraThatFits,3dp2bz,boba-boba,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:46:58 2015 UTC,Do you mind sharing how severe it is and where abouts your chest may be shaped differently to most people's? It would be useful to know which areas of your chest are likely to affect the way bras fit and where you might have sensitive spots.
ABraThatFits,3dpmlw,reallysaucy,6,Sat Jul 18 05:48:36 2015 UTC,"It depends, I think. To use your two examples, the whole breastfeeding process tends to change a person's shape enough that usually new styles are required after weaning, in comparison to what they wore prior to pregnancy. But weight loss and gain usually don't do this quite as much unless the amount of weight gained and/or lost is significant. So if you just gain 15 pounds or so, you might still be okay with the same styles in a slightly larger size.  We think the size of a person's root is pretty consistent throughout all the changes life brings. I intend to become pregnant someday (not soon, though, I'm only 19!) and I assume my breasts will grow at that time. However, my root will stay the same size, so my boobs will become more projected rather than expanding equally in all directions and becoming a larger version of the shape I already have. My ribcage is so small that I don't think that's actually possible. The trends I've seen here make me think that root sizes vary a lot less than breast sizes among the population, which is why shallow shapes are more common at the smaller end of the size range and projected shapes are more common at the larger end of the size range. That's just my own thought, though, no idea if that's actually true. (Roots are hard to measure!)"
ABraThatFits,3dpmlw,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:17:57 2015 UTC,That's pretty interesting. It does make sense that your root wouldn't change as much but the actual breast could. I guess then that you would more than likely need to find a different shaped bra than what you previously had. It's not just a difference in volume size.
ABraThatFits,3dpmlw,EmmaInFrance,3,Sat Jul 18 20:07:35 2015 UTC,"It really does depend. I think a lot of people lose upper fullness when they lose weight. A lot of people also find that their breasts are radically different after breastfeeding;  Then again, not everyone's boobs change dramatically after breastfeeding. I ended up being lucky and still have fairly firm, mostly self-supporting breasts after bfing 3 kids, each for more than 12 months each."
ABraThatFits,3dpmlw,basylica,3,Sat Jul 18 10:46:58 2015 UTC,"I got lucky too after 70lb weight gain/loss with each of my 2 kiddos, breastfeeding for over 3yrs total, and fairly regular ups and downs.  I'm fairly certain my boobs were FOT before kids and still are but I have less upper fullness so they behave more even.   I actually like my boobs more now :)  I just dropped a decent amount of weight due to changing jobs (going from a size 8 and 30HH to a size 4 and 28H. I'm 5'9 so it takes a decent ammt to cause me to fluctuate) and while I like the same bras, I find certain ones work better for me at 30hh and some were ok, and the ones that worked great before are just ok now. Yk?"
ABraThatFits,3dpmlw,Milfy-Way,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:32:21 2015 UTC,"I've definitely changed dramatically! Before kids, I was a perky B cup but with each baby my breasts have gotten bigger in volume and more pendulous. You are certainly lucky!"

ABraThatFits,3dn3q3,chattyyogalady,2,Fri Jul 17 20:17:58 2015 UTC,"Wacoal's 32H is equivalent to a UK 32FF. In my experience the La Femme fits small, though, so I wouldn't advise trying that if you think you're a 32G.   Natori's 32H is also equivalent to a UK 32FF. Afaik Natori bras run shallow. Natori Feathers definitely is shallow.   Some of the Chantelle bras on sale go to a 32H (again, equivalent to a UK 32FF), but not all of them do (at least on Nordstrom's website, idk about otherwise).   The only bras that are on sale that come in UK 32G are the Freya Deco Spotlight, the Freya Deco Delight (which is sold online only), and the Panache wireless sports bra (which is sold online only as well)."

ABraThatFits,3douv0,TwoTonTuTu,3,Sat Jul 18 01:11:02 2015 UTC,I hear the calculator tends to overestimate in the larger band sizes. Does any of the tissue spill out the front on your current bra? Does the gore tack? I think 40DDD/E-F are possibilities in the best shape. This woman is 40E/F as well.
ABraThatFits,3douv0,Julez22,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:15:11 2015 UTC,"I got 40F/FF using those measurements (sticking to UK sizes because they're more reliable), but I suspect that a 38F/FF would be a better starting place. I have very similar underbust measurements and 38 bands are very comfortable for me.  I would recommend Cleo Lucy, Panache Jasmine and some of the Sculptresse balconettes like Chi Chi (same cut as Jasmine) and Flirtini as good starting points.  One of the easiest ways to bra shop is actually online from places with free shipping and returns. Amazon is really good for this. If you can, pick one bra and order a range of sizes, perhaps a 38F and a 38FF and even add a 40F and 40FF to be sure.   Don't be disappointed if you don't find the perfect bra straight away. It can take several tries."
ABraThatFits,3dplys,yesiamarobot,3,Sat Jul 18 05:41:01 2015 UTC,"Have you tried measuring yourself first? I suggest doing that prior to going into Nordstrom. Fitters seem to be a hit or miss. It's better to have your own idea of what size you are before they throw a size at you that ends up being completely incorrect. What are your 5 measurements? If you haven't noticed, the lovely people around here love to help with measurement checks. It's also much cheaper to buy a nursing bra online rather than Nordstrom. I have a Freya one on my ebay watchlist for $20. You're probably going to spend $50-$75 at Nordstrom for 1 bra. It's suggested to have at least 2 on hand.  I'm 37 weeks and I have yet to give into nursing bras. I know I might have to at some point, but I'm waiting until a month or two post-partum when I'm sure this breastfeeding business works out (I couldn't breastfeed with my first). There's a guide available about maternity/nursing bras. If you haven't read it, it has good advice."

I tried to find a nursing bra but they were godawful and I couldn't find any big enough. I bought a Royce nursing bra in 36J and it was like a slingshot. In reality I probably needed something in the neighborhood of 32M. Literally double the volume they are right now.  I gave up and was queen of getting straps off my shoulders under a shirt, wearing way way way too small bali 36DDD bras.   You don't HAVE to wear em.

ABraThatFits,3dpg2c,yvettesaysyatta,4,Sat Jul 18 04:35:09 2015 UTC,"How old is your current 36C? I only ask because if you're comfortable in a 36 band, you might find that a 36E/36DDD fits you better (that's the same volume as 38DD, but on a smaller band). However, if your current bras are all quite old and stretched out, they might be stretching to 38""+ anyway and so a new 38 band would indeed be best!   If you're squeezing into a 36C (made for someone with an underbust of ~36"" and a bust of ~39""!) then I imagine you probably haven't been swooping & scooping all of your breast tissue into the cup, because you'd have some serious overflow/quadboob going on. You'll definitely need to do this in your new bras :)  38DD should be easy to find, 36E might be a little more difficult but probably not much. I'm not in the US so have no personal experience of VS stores but they definitely make 36DDD and 38DD, it just depends what they actually have in stock."
ABraThatFits,3dpg2c,sympathyboner,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:54:37 2015 UTC,I plan on throwing out a lot of old ones (maybe as old as five years old). So I only have a couple of 36Cs. I recently bought two and this strap free one is a bit too snug on me. That's when I decided to try out this subreddit. So I may go up to 38 but 36 bands usually fit fine on me. It's the cups that are hit or miss for me.
ABraThatFits,3dpg2c,hurrrrrmione,2,Sun Jul 19 21:53:33 2015 UTC,"Most stores should carry 38DD. Victoria's Secret carries it, although their bras might not be a good shape for your breasts. Lane Bryant carries this size if there's one near you. Same goes for Dillard's. Most of the brands and many of the specific bras we talk about a lot on this sub can be found at Nordstrom's. You can also check the offline retailer list for lingerie boutiques in your area if you're interested.   If you'd like, we can give you recommendations of specific bras to try if you look at the shape guide and let us know what shape you think your breasts are."
ABraThatFits,3dnwnc,beautyofspeed,12,Fri Jul 17 20:21:53 2015 UTC,"What's your general range of motion on that side? I'm guessing you can't put your arm behind you in order to hold the clasp of a regular bra so you can fasten it with your good hand.   I was born without my left hand, but I still have most of my arm and use of all joints up to a very small wrist, so even I use both arms to get my bra on. The only part I've found that requires the strength of both arms is pulling the clasp together in the front and fastening it; I use my little hand to stabilize the hooks and then use my big hand to thread the hooks into the eyes. I think a well-placed chair, or anything that comes up to underbust level, could substitute for your hand holding the band in place if you lean against it. You'd have to practice pulling the band around with just one hand if you haven't done that before. I'd suggest starting with something looser (maybe just pick up a cheap 44 band bra or something) so you get the hang of the arm movement without as much resistance as a well-fitting band can give. Once you've got the bra facing forward, the next challenge is getting your limited arm and shoulder into the strap. If your bras can sit slightly below your underbust without being too uncomfortable, I'm guessing that would help. With the strap extended as far as it can go, your hand and arm won't have as far to go to get inside the strap. Then you would pull everything up and tighten things how you like them. The one spot I can't reach on my torso is right where the bra strap on my big hand side goes, so that one has to be adjusted while I'm not wearing the bra. However I can adjust the other strap while the bra is on, so I'm hopeful that you will also be able to!  Of course, this will take some experimentation, but I hope I've given you some food for thought to adapt the bras you already have. You are amazingly strong and resilient, and I know you'll find ways to be independent even with your limited mobility. There are lots of products out there to help you with tasks that usually require two arms, though you'll probably find that you don't need too many of them. I wish you continued healing and good luck!"
ABraThatFits,3dnwnc,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:19:33 2015 UTC,"Ideas were lovely but not realistic. I have maybe 10% mobility of the shoulder itself as I effectively have no rotator cuff - I have a donor rotator cuff that is sewn in to help in anchoring the internal prosthesis. Elbow and down works, trying to move the arm behind me doesn't work, basically I can't even lift the arm to get to my own armpit without using the other arm to manually lift it at my elbow."
ABraThatFits,3dnwnc,Goddess_Keira,6,Sat Jul 18 14:05:16 2015 UTC,"The only front close I can think of is Elila soft cup (i.e., no underwire) model 1515, in US 40K. As you're wearing a UK H cup, you'd need a K cup in US sizes, so brands like Glamorise that make front-close will be out because their H cup is a US H, several cup volumes too small.  There may be some UK-sized front close bras out there I'm unaware of; maybe somebody else will have some ideas."

ABraThatFits,3dnwnc,rsv123,3,Sat Jul 18 01:44:30 2015 UTC,"I know it's not ideal, but you can purchase front clasp findings and alter bras that you already like to suit (probably easiest with plunges)- I'd imagine it wouldn't be terribly complicated to divide a gore and attach a front clasp (might need to use ribbon or a thin strap - maybe elastic? to connect the finding to the gore). Depending on where you live, there may be a specialty boutique or seamstress that does this alteration on a regular basis. Hook and eye closures might be an option as a front-close alteration if the gore is higher, too."
ABraThatFits,3dnwnc,defectiveburger,2,Sat Jul 18 05:08:30 2015 UTC,"Find a GOOD tailor - they may be able to sew in a front clasp and permanently said the rest hooks of you can't find any front clasp bras you like.

ABraThatFits,3dnwnc,basylica,2,Sat Jul 18 05:06:38 2015 UTC,That would be my suggestion too. There are not a lot of options for front close and modifying would give you customized bras and lots more options on fit. Special need means special adaptations.  Should be easy enough to cut straight up a gore and add in front clasps. I'd go hook and eyes in front vs the normal front closure type.  I'd suggest leaving back part alone so you can still make bra smaller as it stretches. It's one of the big downsides to front closures that you can't tighten as band stretches.  I would also suggest discussing adding in elastic or a strip of Lycra (like swimsuit material) in the front so you can slip bra over head or step into it and it will be in position and not trying to fly left and right while you struggle to fasten it.   I can sketch if that doesn't make sense. I sew and those alterations while not free/cheap should not be terribly expensive and make things easier :)
ABraThatFits,3dnwnc,cornycat,2,Sat Jul 18 14:50:07 2015 UTC,"I know that the Un-Bra comes in your size and can be made with a front-closure. It's a wireless softcup bra, so I don't know if the shape would be ideal for professional outfits or high activity levels, but it might be a good option to check out for more casual situations and relaxing. It's supposed to be quite comfortable, and the company is really willing to work with clients to modify the bras based on measurements and preferences."

I reviewed the Comexim Joy longline here in a blog post, if you want to take a look.   The band of the longline has some issues with tension, which causes the wires to float a little at the bottom (almost everyone who tried the bra has said this).  But because of this, it's best to size down in the band. So if you normally wear 30 bands, you probably want to do the 28 band in the longline. I bet 60k, or even a size higher in the cups, might work for you."
ABraThatFits,3dpee4,Ivana_Karamazov,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:28:22 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply!

Make sure to read the bratabase reviews.   The band runs a lot tighter for standard Comexim bras. I have only tried one standard bra so far, which I also just reviewed on my blog! I got it in 60J and it is a perfect fit (it is supposed to be equivalent to 28GG).  So you should be at 65HH (the sister size, up one band) or 65J (if you need a bit more extra room in the cup than I need) I believe!"

It sounds like there were some fit issues to begin with, but when you get into this size range it can be near impossible to impossible to get a tacking gore. However, you say that ""The band is now too tight on the loosest setting, and the cups are gaping at the top and feel too big."" Was this also the case three months ago?   It sounds like your measurements may have changed and the bra is now too small altogether. Cups can feel like they're too big when the bra is too small all over. You can test the fit of the band independently of cups by trying the bra on backwards with the band under your bust (above the tummy) and the cups upside down on your back. Try that and see if the band is too tight then. However, if you've worn the bra a fair amount it may be stretched out. Part of the problem may also be that the bra isn't sitting in your inframammary fold (IMF), the crease under your breasts where the breasts attach to your chest wall. Try to put your bra on leaning forward, positioning your bra directly in your IMF and making sure all your breast tissue is in the cups, then doing it up, and see if that helps at all.  It's hard to say what size might be better in the Alana at this point. After you've checked these things out, can you get back to us with more information?"

I asked a similar question some time ago and the general consensus was that S is narrower in smaller sizes (I was asking about 60FF/65F, which I generally assumed would be my EM sizes) than PL, and that there's kind of an awkward change in fit between S and 3D. 3D is pretty shallow, and S is much narrower for only being one cup volume larger. PL, on the other hand, is somewhere in between them. They said they thought PL would work for me in 60FF, and my best fits are Masquerade Medina and Freya Daydreamer half cup in 28F.

Claudette Sophia might be a good choice but I'm worried it would be TOO shallow - it's a very shallow bra.   If you don't mind the cutting in you get with Dessous, I think I'd recommend getting 28DD at this point. Less alterations for you! 28E would most likely gape and cut in simultaneously, though I imagine the cup volume would be closer to what you need. The shape just won't work very well."

I also have a 30C lepel fiore that fits very well shape wise but my breasts have grown recently and its a little too small :( otherwise most of my bras dont really fit. my best fit is probably fortnight's luna longline bra in 30d. wish it was a 28 cause it rides up sometimes but largely it is very comfortable throughout the day.

I really like Freya's half cups, though the Patsy ones are a bit wide-wired for me. The Lauren half cups are the best, but I think you have slightly more upper fullness than I do, so those might work less well. Masquerade half cups are great too, and I've heard that Fauve half cups are nice for our shape as well. Both Fauve and Masquerade are discontinued now, but you can still find them on Ebay and /r/braswap pretty easily. And Comexim half cups are also supposed to be good for our shape, I hope to be able to try one to verify that!  TL;DR: Half cups forever. Pretty much the only bra I've tried that worked and isn't a half cup is the Deco Vibe. Deco Vibe is a plunge, but the cups are both tall and relatively open on top, which plays nice with tall roots."
ABraThatFits,3dne0c,fireswater,9,Fri Jul 17 18:03:23 2015 UTC,"A 34DDD in Natori is actually  the equivalent of 34E in UK, so probably at least one cup size off for you. The calculator sizes you at 34F or FF, either could be right or sometimes the calculator is a little off, but I suspect one of those sizes is right for you. A 34G in Natori is the equivalent of a UK 34F, because Natori does skip F cup in its progression. They don't skip DD; I guess the 34DD simply wasn't in stock but that's moot as it would not be the right size for you in any case.  Fit is as much a matter of shape as size, and since Natori Feathers is a very shallow-fitting bra, chances are it's too shallow for you and that's why you're getting buckling in the 34G. On the other hand, the 34DDD is too small in the cups which is why the band feels tight. You can wear it with an extender if you wish, though; it's up to you. Ultimately, though, it sounds like Feathers is a shape mismatch for you and you won't get an ideal fit in it.  As for fitting both breasts when you have asymmetry, well, the bra is always going to fit one breast better than the other.  We advocate fitting the larger breast and either tightening the strap or using an insert, but it's everyone's personal choice how to handle that."
ABraThatFits,3dne0c,Goddess_Keira,9,Fri Jul 17 18:59:06 2015 UTC,"A bra leaving red marks doesn't mean it's too small at all, that's perfectly normal.  Is your tight underbust measurement incorrect? I assume you mean 31.5""?"

ABraThatFits,3dod3s,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:01:31 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're closer to 30DD but it would be nice to order both. Shape can definitely be a factor to consider. If you're rather projected and the bra is shallow/somewhat projected, you might want to size up. Betsey Johnson is a pretty shallow brand so you might want to get both sizes. It's on herroom too which has good returns."

Here's some photos of women wearing properly fitted 28DD bras - hopefully that looks similar to you :)  A tight 30 band might work, but as your leaning bust measurement is 32"" I definitely wouldn't recommend going up to a 32C. Sister sizing works best if you stay within one sister size anyway."

ABraThatFits,3dmle5,AsymetricalBoobage,3,Fri Jul 17 14:24:10 2015 UTC,"I think it's much more likely that you're a 42 band not a 44, and in loose bands there's even a chance you'd take a 40, but it's unlikely.  In your size ranger the laying measurement is usually the most accurate but can still sometimes overestimate, it would give us 42G/GG/H as a starting point, this is UK sizing.  UK sizing is used on this sub as the US brands all have different size schemes, stick to UK and convert brands individually, there are resources in the Wiki.  Having one breast much larger than the other will throw your breast measurements too as they are a kind of average of the two boobs, so may UNDERestimate.  I know you have sticker shock but try not to prejudge, and be aware that....  Shape is going to be super important, the wrong shape can look and feel all sorts of horrid including too big and too small at the same time.  You'll need the right width wires (have a look at the shape guide and see if you can work out if you have wide or narrow roots) and the right shaped cup (again the shape guide will help you work out if you're fuller on top or bottom or even in shape).  You must fit to the larger breast;  we pretty much all have at least some asymmetry, the strap can be tightened on the smaller side or for more significant asymmetry you can buy inserts.  Have a look at the shape guide and come back with your assessment, otherwise we can only recommend ""diagnostic"" bras to order and send most if not all back."
ABraThatFits,3dmle5,joanna70,2,Fri Jul 17 17:12:56 2015 UTC,"Okay I took a look at the charts and Im definitely not shallow and Im slightly fuller on the top than bottom. I do get that omega shape that has gotten more pronounced as Ive lost weight. But Im having a hard time figuring out what type of roots I have, even looking at guides. Do you have any tips/links for determining roots?"
ABraThatFits,3dmbvd,PetilsSaxophone,7,Fri Jul 17 12:56:50 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely try 75 band in your case. Which bra have you tried at 75F? UK to EU sizing conversion works odd for lots of brands, so you'd better look for their original size. I mean, if the bra is from UK, use UK size, if it's European - look for what's listed at the tag near EU unless it's French, and so on.   Also, did you scooped and swooped in your 75F? It may have a great difference.  As for European bands: different manufacturers mean absolutely differen things when marking their bands.   I have lots of Milavitsa's bras and all of them correspond the band size on a tag with unstretched band length. I.e. if they are marked as 75F, they have 75 unstretched band. But all of their bras have extremely stretchy bands, so you need to add at least 10cm to find out the ribcage size that may have a good fit with them.   But when I looked for Boobs and Bloomers bra for my daughter, I've found their bands go 'true to size', i.e. if they are 65C, they fit 65-70cm ribcage, not the 75cm one as Milavitsa does.   And Polish bras actually also all have different band sizing system: there are some true and some with those extra 10cm, and those with only 5 extra cm.   Also, do you put the bra on properly? It sounds like a silly question, but my mom with her measurements pretty close to yours have worn 80C almost the whole her life and when I asked her to try on my old 75F's she had thought they are huge untill i asked her to put the bra not as it's shown at the left drawing, but at the right one. It turned out the cups of 75F are actually too small for her. While she still refuses this and buys new 75D's and wears them wrong again =)."
ABraThatFits,3dmbvd,yellkaa,2,Fri Jul 17 13:28:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the assistance!  I tried the 75F Tutti Rouge Nichole, I couldn't fill out at the lacy bit at the top of the cups. I did swoop and scoop but I'm only just getting the hang of it so I might have done it incorrectly. My previous method was just leaning over and letting the breasts 'fall into the cup'. I also tried 75F Cleo Maddie but it felt super tight so I returned it after much deliberation. Perhaps I will try something with a different fit in that size!  edit: I did end up keeping a Panache Marcie in 75FF, it fits on me the same as Masquerade Orla in 80F, good fit overal with slight looseness at the top of the cup."
ABraThatFits,3dmbvd,yellkaa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:12:02 2015 UTC,"Was it gapping at the very top around the place where the strap is attached, like here: 1 2? If so, it's not a wrong cup size, it's a wrong shape. This one in the picture is for shallower breasts with taller roots - that's why it's not working with my projected breasts with short roots.  Also, you may be full on bottom while the bra may be designed for full on top breasts and have more 'open' cups which may result in having some gaping at the top lace. Besides, I've found on Bratabase that Nicole goes a bit larger in size, so sometimes you need to downsize at them."

ABraThatFits,3djjmr,Skybosia,96,Thu Jul 16 19:57:57 2015 UTC,"Can I just say that THIS IS THE BEST POST I'VE EVER SEEN? Not mocking your woes obviously but your illustrations are absolutely amazingly perfect.  So anyway, what I can gather from your drawings is that you have short roots, and omega shaped breasts.  When you stated:   Because of bad boobwear, my boobs run completely underneath my arms and behind my back.   Can actually go in two different (har har) directions. The first direction and the most obvious one would be to say ""Oh you have wide roots!"". However, I'm more inclined to ask if when you feel around that area do you get the same general sense of discomfort if you poked the tissue around your areolas and nipples, or is it a different kind of discomfort? I'm a short lady myself -you tower over me by three inches!!- and I've yet to see a lady in our height range in a wide band size range (think a range of 10 band sizes starting with 28) actually have breast tissue on the back side of her, but of course you could be the first one.  Is it possible that due to a variety of factors -skin elasticity, hormonal changes, gravity due to your breast size, etc- that you're experiencing an elongated inframammary fold that turns into a crease due to gravity? I've got pendulous breasts -although I'm about 4 or so cup sizes smaller than you- and my 'breast root' actually goes past where my breast tissue ends by about an inch. This is common with women who have at least one bust measurement that's over 9 or so inches more than their underbust measurement. I'm also inclined to think if you actually had a far reaching breast root like that your breast shape when leaning might look differently than what it does.  Splayed breasts are problematic -I've got this too- and especially when the.. boob skin bag -I don't think there's an actual medical term for this- is soft and so the breasts tend to swish around in the skin like an egg yolk in a bowl after you crack the egg open, they will go everywhere and anywhere they can.  I can't really give any recommendations quite yet until there's some clarification about your breast root, but I can say that it sounds like in addition to proper fitting bras, purchasing buttonups and other blouses to accommodate your bosom would be something to consider. Since you need to take in modesty and conservative dress into consideration, I think having tops that you don't have to worry about pinning or having the buttons fly off is also very important for your needs."

Just put lots and lots of illustrations in it for us visual types! ;)  So my dog thinks I'm crazy! I've been in and out of tshirts and bras all day! I have had every measuring apparatus in the house after my boobs. Protractors, tape measures, rulers, vises...  Concerning boob roots- I just bent over at the waist 90 degrees. When I do this, ALL apparent boob type skin from under my arm or around my back completely disappears! My boob forms the omega shape- ie; the grapefruit in a sock. If I face a mirror and place a ruler behind my boob at the IMF, I am only 4.5"" across! So, my guess, until I am corrected, is that I have a NARROW root with LOTS of shifted egg whites?"

If you've got soft-tissue boobs, a better-fitting bra will contain the bits that always seem to sink to the middle and make the awful cleavage that attracts all the wrong attention. Don't just look for bras that appear conservative on the model (aside from your colour preference), just trust in the fact that once you have a comfy boob hammock, everything seems better."

Please forgive my general comment making! <3  @ Brafithelp Thank you for linking those wonderful pics of women in my size. Those women looked completely natural and normal to me because I looked at them objectively, instead of how I look at myself, through many years of frustration! That's just the pick me up and inspiration I needed! :)  @ Wambrita Thanks for these great questions to help me pin down the right bra! ""Conservative"" is a subjective word. I would prefer nude. I'm have a fair freckled complexion. I want an underwire; I really feel I need the architecture. :) Because I do a lot of bending, lifting, and the occasional sprinting, and/or tackling, I'm looking for something I won't just come tumbling out of.

Here's how you reply to posts. If you are in the post and you want to respond a comment like I'm doing now, look for the reply button below the post, circled in red  Alternatively, if you are wanting to respond from your inbox, look for the reply button, again, circled in red.  In addition, if you want to create a mention and want the person to see it, instead of doing ""@ Skybosia"", try doing /u/Skybosia instead. Puting the /u/ before their name (no spaces) will send them a notification in their inbox that someone mentioned them, and then they can respond appropriately. Because I tagged your user name, and I'm replying to your post, you'll get a double notification in your inbox.  /u/brafithelp had some good recommendations, I really can't add to that. Sounds like you're okay with unlined -bras with no foam- so that at least broadens your choices if certain bras don't work.

ABraThatFits,3djjmr,brafithelp,11,Thu Jul 16 21:34:45 2015 UTC,"Here are some real people approximately your size (30HH and sister sizes). When well supported, they don't look so overwhelmingly big or ""vulgar"" (don't get me started on that level of judgement).   You have pendulousness to work against, which could impact your fit, but 30H sounds like aa good place to start. 32DDD (32E) is FIVE cup volumes smaller than you need, so no wonder everything hurts! You may find that you aren't so big as that after all, once your pendulousness is accounted for. The extra skin needs to go somewhere, but its lack of fullness means it takes up less cup space.  If it helps, I was a 30GG, one size smaller, and once I was contained nobody would ever describe me as more than ""medium-busty.""  Edit: Bras to try below  Cleo Juna  Cleo Maddie  Panache Andorra  - alternately, Panache Envy  Brands to try: Cleo by Panache, Panache, Freya, Fantasie, Curvy Kate... and there are many many more.  Edit 2: For what it's worth, Wacoal makes a handful of bras in G and H cups (F and FF UK, respectively, so still 3 cups too small, but still better than what you're wearing now!) Also, if you're in the US, visit Burlington Coat Factory. They sometimes have a handful of UK-sized bras by a US brand called Parfait by Affinitas, usually in models that go to a UK G cup (closer still) for $5-7."
ABraThatFits,3djjmr,wambrita,15,Thu Jul 16 20:26:11 2015 UTC,Juna and Maddie are shallow bras I do not think they will work for OP at all.
ABraThatFits,3djjmr,brafithelp,3,Thu Jul 16 20:49:17 2015 UTC,"I specifically aimed for nude and plain, and my own experience with pendulousness is that Juna is one of my go-to bras because the top is forgiving... allows the extra skin somewhere to go. They may very well not work out, but many of our so-called diagnostic bras are lacy or come in bright colors."
ABraThatFits,3djjmr,wambrita,17,Thu Jul 16 20:52:18 2015 UTC,"I legitimately think she's going to run into the problem of the cups being too tall, not unlike that Alexander McQueen inspired dress that Natalie Dormer wore in Season 2 of GoT."

Cup height is an awkward measurement that isn't included in bratabase, so here you go:  Vertical height from end of strap to top of underwire: 6 inches in both sizes  Vertical height following center seam (following the outer curve of the cup, similar to cup depth but in the other direction and outside the cup): 7 inches with the lace and just over 6 inches without the lace for both sizes  Gore height: 3.25 inches for both sizes  I personally don't find Juna to be a very tall cup or even particularly shallow at this size. It's shallower than some of my bras for sure, but not extremely shallow as compared to, say Cleo Neve.  Here is the bratabase entry for 30H Cleo Juna  Here is a comparison of a handful of bra models in the same size. Surprisingly, the Juna isn't so different in depth and width from Freya Patsy Plunge."

ABraThatFits,3djjmr,wambrita,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:14:10 2015 UTC,"I got curious and measured where my IMF is compared to the dip in between my clavicles, I get 7 inches; and from My IMF to my belly button is also 7 inches, and it's another two inches to the top of my lap. (I don't know if that makes me short waisted or what) If I do the pancake boob thing my breast root is maybe 2.5 inches tall, and it sounds like OP may have slightly taller roots than I do, and it's possible that the Juna has the possibility of working for her. Not surprising considering she's 3 inches taller than me and 3 or 4 cup sizes bigger than I am.  I know that the bane of my existence is the fact that I need the depth of a 30FF, cup width of a 30E and the cup height of a 30F. And I still get cup collapse even when the bra is a cup size too large.  I guess the takeaway is that Juna might work for her, so I guess completely discounting it is a bad idea."

ABraThatFits,3djjmr,ms_ashes,7,Thu Jul 16 22:19:28 2015 UTC,"I think your breasts could best be described as, Projected, Splayed, Narrow Roots, Short Height.  ""Close-set"" is very plausible, because you mention you have a 1/2"" space between them when you lean over, but this can be a descriptive characteristic in or out of a bra. You can have breasts that are wide set braless, but when you are in a proper fitting bra they can come together closer, almost touching.  Full on top/Full on bottom is to be determined, because this is determined by how your breasts behave in a proper fitting bra."

My only concern, and it could be that I've misunderstood- for your IMF, it shouldn't move, regardless of where your arms are placed. Your IMF is basically where the underside of your boob meets your chest wall, where the underwire should fit. For me, it's all of the breast tissue, then a rosy pink smile-shaped line that is the IMF, then chest wall.  Edit: Also, I have a few recommendations. YMMV and others can feel free to chip in as to whether they think it'll work :) Tutti Rouge Liliana in 32H, Cleo Molly in 30HH, Fantasie 4510, Fantasie Rebecca.   https://www.google.com/search?q=inframammary+fold&client=safari&hl=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAWoVChMI-Miwm__gxgIVwTg-Ch2kEgv3&biw=1024&bih=644&dpr=2#imgrc=_e7aGuI9mqNeaM%3A"

As a pendulous lady who looks very similar to this drawing, I loved everything about this other than calling the lowest part of where the boob hangs the IMF.  OP: My understanding is that the IMF is where the fingertips are in the drawing of where the hand is holding the boob. We pendulous ladies have boobs that hang down below the IMF, which is why we need immediate projection at the underwire. At least, as I understand it, as I have not found my BTF yet."

I believe the confusion comes more from my drawing errors than from confusion over where I think the IMF actually is.  Maybe I think my IMF seems to move around because I wear bras with such loose bands that the bands move up my back and the cup wires slide down my chest?  Is it possible that loose skin is being pulled along with my boobs when I'm am not supported at all? I have lost a considerable amount of weight over the last few years, somewhere around 60-65ish pounds now, and I'm wondering if my actual IMF isn't being obscured by this?  In general, I measure my IMF as being where my ""pancake"" attaches to my chest wall when supported with my hand. That's where my ""smile"" appears to be.  Thanks again for all your help! Who ever knew there was so much to learn about boob architecture! I certainly hope this is helping other people too! <333"

This self-centered and objectifying theory pissed me off.  And then, as you can see, he became my ex. The bra talk was not the main reason, but it was one of the many reasons. I am really sorry for your experience, and I think this is more like a relationship problem than just a bra problem. A person who trully loves you and cares for you should not comment on your body and your choice like this.

I can understand why your SO would be confused about your bra size though, the media creates a false perception in a lot of people's minds of what a DD looks like. A lot of people think Pamela Anderson is a DD cup. As fusterating as it is just ignore the ignorant comments. My own mother made similar comments regarding my bra size when I went bra fitting with her years ago at age 15. I can just imagine what she would say if I told her I wear  a 32 J bra. Your breasts are fine the way they are ; just because your boyfriend doesn't think they are very large does not mean that they are unattractive or inadequate. Maybe tell him how much he is hurting your feelings and let him read the comments on this thread. I wish you all the best and I hope that you can begin to love your body for what it is. Cheers."

ABraThatFits,3dkbd3,mybraguy,5,Fri Jul 17 09:23:58 2015 UTC,"Glad he's trying to be better. :)  Maybe in the future it'll help if you frame your observations of celebrity boobs in terms of theirs being way bigger than the standard DD's rather then going into what size you are. Otherwise your SO might think that you are feeling insecure with your size and trying to make it sound closer to that celebrity's size, rather then just saying that the celebrity's size is way bigger also... Does this even make a shred of sense?? I'm sorry I'm so so tired.    My husband does the same sort of thing with my bras, he thinks all my bands are way too tight and there's no way my cup size is as big as it is. Even though my boobs are obviously very big, he just thinks I can't possibly be a J."

Not only does she literally constantly have quad boob her bra always rides up like above a low-backed shirt. I'd estimate her at like a 28GG/H if not a 26 band and when I told her that she's like ""that size doesn't exist though and you're forgetting to to add +4""... Ugh it's annoying and she bought me like 3 34D bras all of which didn't fit and she took the tags off of two of them and threw the tags out Bc she knew that I'd like the style of them (the other she was iffy about the color and I'm so glad she was Bc it was quadboob hell)....

I have severe gynecomastia and I currently wear a 36G in most of my bras so I know how important a proper fitting bra is.

If I've learned anything in my life, it's that this is not likely to end well for you.  Wanting to be right isn't always a death sentence for a relationship, but it depends on the person you're involved with. My current boyfriend actually stopped acting like my parent (pointing out small problems, telling me how to cook, etc.) when I told him how much it bothered me. However, I couldn't be too surprised because he was otherwise supportive and would never even think to say anything hurtful.  Other boyfriends, however, had the same need to criticize, but they had a completely different approach. They were hurtful, and they never changed. In fact, they got worse over time. There is a difference between people who have flaws (we all do), and people who are emotionally destructive. You shouldn't have to tell your boyfriend not to criticize your body parts. It shouldn't occur to him as a possibility."

ABraThatFits,3dnid6,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:13:23 2015 UTC,I think the edge is curling out a little just because it's kind of thick? Is there anything that I can do to fix that? The bra does seem pretty flush with my skin.

You can try to curl the edge back in while it's wet and see if that helps. Grabbing the outermost layer of fabric and tugging it gently towards the center of your chest might also help (again, while the bra is wet will be the most effective).  If that doesn't work, you can try sewing the bra as shown here and here (that last link doesn't have the pictures anymore, but you can see most of them here).

ABraThatFits,3dmwr9,margaret3lizabeth,3,Fri Jul 17 15:53:49 2015 UTC,"Almost any bra is going to gape like that when you lean over - that in itself is not a sign of a poor fit, that's simply what happens when you move. That's why we usually judge fit from a neutral standing position. How do the cups feel then? Do they still have gaping, or are they filled out?   Judging by the pictures, I'd say it actually looks like a pretty good fit; on the left side it seems to sit a bit low, as it should be as close to being in your IMF as possible, but pics also make it look like that's your smaller side. As far as I can tell, the other side is filled out nicely and I don't see any obvious gaping from the standing pics."
ABraThatFits,3dmwr9,LadyVerene,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:30:07 2015 UTC,"I've learned a ton today. :)  Thanks a ton! There was a little bit of gaping when standing but not too much at all.  It seems to be a pretty decent fit overall, and it is my smaller side.   I think the bras I normally lean to are padded so the size difference and gaping isn't as obvious.  I also bought a Cleo Izzy in a 36 E and while the band is super too small (maybe an extender would suffice?) the cups seem to be perfect.   Thank you thank you for your help!"
ABraThatFits,3dmwr9,LadyVerene,3,Fri Jul 17 16:47:38 2015 UTC,"Padded bras (especially molded ones) can be tricky fits because they can hide a lot of fit issues. And you're welcome!  As far as the Izzy goes - Cleo does tend to run tight, yes, and extenders are always a good thing to have on hand just in case. To make sure that it's the band being too tight (and not the cups too small making the band feel tight), try it on upside-down - so that the cups aren't over your breasts. Since the cups aren't in the way, that'll let you really judge if the band is too tight or if you need to size up in the cup."
ABraThatFits,3dmwr9,joanna70,2,Fri Jul 17 16:55:36 2015 UTC,"Tango is a tricky fit and can be tall/gappy on many people, you're really below the size range it works well for.  I personally think the wires may be a little narrow, could they be sitting on breast tissue at the outsides?  If so you need a wider underwire and less projected cup, possibly a size smaller.  It's always good to try more than one size and it looks like 36E and 36F would generally be good sizes to try where bands run tight.  The bras you have ordered are at least as projected as this one, Lily is narrower, both are more even in shape, Tango is FOB."
ABraThatFits,3dl4z4,nidena,21,Fri Jul 17 03:51:40 2015 UTC,"Here's how I look at it.  1) Keep your work measurements and life measuring separate and do your best to compartmentalize. It sucks, but I think if your bosses catch wind that you're doing this from someone who decided to feel sassy and go ""Your bras suck, your sizing system sucks because nidena told me so."" you may end up not working at VS involuntarily. I've seen a handful of posts here in the 2.5 I've been ABTF member of people actually doing this, or contemplating doing this. Not saying it WILL happen, but the law of averages imply it can happen.  2) You can look for another job. Maybe selling lingerie at a department store, independent lingerie stores, or another retail job somewhere else, not bra related. Looking for a new job sucks, but if it's causing such a state of conflict, it may help you to do this in the long run."

My goal is to just get customers in a better size they were before, teach them about sister sizes and swooping and scooping etc.  If our DDD's don't fit them and they need less than a 34 band however, I will tell them about online stores and stuff."
ABraThatFits,3dl4z4,Goddess_Keira,2,Fri Jul 17 18:04:13 2015 UTC,"I applied to White House Black Market earlier this week.  I'd like to stay at VS--I do love their stuff, even if I can't wear it any longer (because I'm the kind of customer that wants an actual ""perfect fit"" and will search until I find it), and I love helping seeing my customers' faces light up when they do find an item that fits.  If I'm unable to open my own boutique, applying to VS corporate is one option that I may pursue--can definitely work to change from the inside that way.  :)  I'll just have to see how the next few weeks go."
ABraThatFits,3dl4z4,crazymusicalgenius96,5,Fri Jul 17 13:50:01 2015 UTC,"If you can get a job elsewhere, I think it makes more sense for you to be working somewhere that you won't feel an ethical conflict. Working at VS corporate might prove to be an even more soul-sucking thing for you. Realistically, VS is astoundingly successful as a brand and they're selling an aesthetic that is wildly popular. It's not just that they're fitting bras incorrectly, they've adopted a whole method of fitting that's designed to achieve the ""look"" that they want to sell. And consumers want the look.   Women who buy VS either are happy with the actual fit of their bras, or they don't make a distinction between liking the fit and liking the look. It's been mentioned here numerous times that the fabrics of VS bras are soft and wonderful on the skin, which probably compensates a lot for deficiencies in the actual fit of the bra. It's been mentioned that VS bras are ""designed"" to wear out faster--I don't know about that; I think the stretchy bands, for instance, are created for the fact that the designers know there needs to be ""boob room"" in the bands in order to ""fit"" the max number of potential customers. And, they have enough customer and brand loyalty, more than enough, to not really care about the people they can't fit or satisfy. No company can be all things to all people.  Much as I'm devoted to a good fit, it dismays me that so many visitors to the sub get really nice fits in, say, Panache bras but the bras hurt them like hell. The problem often isn't the technical aspects of fit--it's that the bras themselves are painful to wear and maybe the very things that make them fit also make them painful. I mention this because just getting a technically well-fitting bra doesn't magically guarantee comfort.  TL;DR: Time for a new job."
ABraThatFits,3dl4z4,-tallywa-,3,Fri Jul 17 15:33:16 2015 UTC,"I actually found my old 32A VS bras to be as snug as my UK bras when I put them around my overbust/armpit area, which measures 32"". I could only fit two fingers under the band and everything! These bras are two years old now, and though I haven't worn them in 6 months, the bands seem to have held up remarkably well. Maybe I just didn't stretch them out much in the time that I wore them. With my 26"" underbust, it's possible. The cups were definitely worn out, though. I was putting so much more stress on them than they could actually handle!"
ABraThatFits,3dl4z4,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:51:54 2015 UTC,"Part of the criteria of a good fit is for it to be comfortable, so if it isn't comfortable then it isn't well fitting. Just to address your last part there."
ABraThatFits,3dl4z4,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Fri Jul 17 17:39:59 2015 UTC,"Oh, absolutely agreed. I should have said something more like ""technically well-fitting"" or ""appears to meet all criteria of good fit"". Nevertheless it seems to me in the course of my experience on the sub, that many times a fit seems to be great in every respect but that the poster will almost invariably say something like ""the gore is digging"" or ""the straps are eating my armpits""  that is a deal-breaker for comfort. One would think this should not happen so frequently and makes me think that the design and material are more at fault than the fit."
ABraThatFits,3dl4z4,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:28:19 2015 UTC,"It is a design fault, especially in higher sizes when grading goes out the window.

ABraThatFits,3dl4z4,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:11:26 2015 UTC,"But it happens with the smaller and middle sizes too! And how many times have we read ""bra fits great (and the photos look great) but the gore/side wires are digging in."" Sometimes it's the wire width, but very often the wires appear to fit fine, they just plain hurt."
ABraThatFits,3dl4z4,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:19:39 2015 UTC,"I wish the full-bust brands would get on the padded wire train. That would probably help a lot with the reports of wire-poking we get all the time! One of my bras has wires that are angled in at the outer end, poking my armpit. No matter how much I try I can't get it to point straight up. I'm afraid it's going to rip a hole in the wire channel.  I feel like the only person who isn't irritated by very wide-set straps sometimes. Most people in my size range (all sizes, really) don't like the side-pull straps. I'm not sure what it is about my body that makes me prefer them - my shoulders are narrow enough to fit in my 8-year-old brother's clothes, so I doubt that I have wide enough shoulders for that to make a difference. The side-pull straps are really effective at reducing how splayed I am, so that might be part of it. But the straps never seem to dig in my armpits, even when they're right next to my armpits."
ABraThatFits,3dl4z4,petitecollegiate,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:31:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, padded wires would be nice. You're fortunate about the straps. I have about averagely wide shoulders, and I greatly prefer center-pull straps. A couple of my Prima Donna bras have wider-set straps and they're fine, but they don't seem to come up to my armpits. I don't think I could handle the rubbing."
ABraThatFits,3dl4z4,hurrrrrmione,3,Fri Jul 17 19:49:18 2015 UTC,I can understand having to keep a job! :) Maybe consider telling your store that they're not stocking the right sizes for your customers or that they need to bring in rixie clips (or something of the sort). Inspire change from inside!
ABraThatFits,3dl4z4,Prettyncharmuese,13,Fri Jul 17 04:09:45 2015 UTC,"A low-level retail employee at a big chain store has as much chance of changing store inventory as a customer. There's nothing her manager or even the district manager can do about what the store carries, so her suggestions will fall on deaf ears. Her best hope for someone hearing her request is to e-mail the company, just like anyone who isn't a VS employee would."
ABraThatFits,3dl4z4,petitecollegiate,5,Fri Jul 17 06:14:10 2015 UTC,"While that's a good suggestion, it'll go in one ear and out the other. For a company to change what they sell, they need to hear complaints from the consumer. When I came across this forum, I actually had an online coat with a VS employee via the website, asking if they carried 30DD. She said they didn't. (30 bands only come in A and B cups I believe). When I told her I was going to return like 6 bras (brand new) due to them not fitting, she said she was going to let corporate know that I was interested in 30dd. But I knew it probably wasn't going to matter, unless they saw the chat. I've suggested to my company that we carry petite sizes. As a short person just about everything we carry is too long for me (they really make clothing for 5'9 tall women). They haven't listed to my suggestion because, ""people want our clothing, so they'll alter them if they need to"". So I've been telling some short women to go to a store that does carry petites. But unlike the op, my sales aren't tracked."

I'm wondering because if you went from 36b, that would size down to 32d. If the cups you are currently in are too small, they can make your band feel too tight."
ABraThatFits,3dknee,holidayfun,2,Fri Jul 17 01:31:57 2015 UTC,"I had plenty of room in my old bras. They'd fit loosely on the tightest hooks, and I'd often go to the middle hooks just so they'd be even more loose. I consider myself super flat, so I figured I didn't need any support. :/"
ABraThatFits,3dknee,Crikey-Way,4,Fri Jul 17 01:51:14 2015 UTC,"Regardless of whether not you think you need support based on size, that's not what matters. Choose your support based on comfort. If you're more comfortable with less support, all the power to you, but if it's more comfortable to have support don't downplay that by saying that you don't need it Bc of your size. You deserve all the support you want or need, regardless of size!"
ABraThatFits,3dknee,plutonium743,3,Fri Jul 17 07:42:51 2015 UTC,What are your measurements? I went down 2 band sizes when I started as well but never felt like I was being squeezed a lot. Also going from 36B to 32C is a decrease of 1 cup which may be adding to the tightness.

You could be as much as a 30E (or even 30F, rare but possible for shallow boobs which your close together bust measurements indicate is possible) which is two cup sizes bigger than what you have.  You need to try some more bras in more sizes, firstly to check your size, and then to try on different shaped bras.  One bra tells you very little.  If you post photos you should get replies :)"

ABraThatFits,3dkm5h,wambrita,7,Sat Jul 18 02:00:26 2015 UTC,"I think you can get a better fit to be honest. That gore for starters is too wide, and the cups look either too small or to shallow because you've got overflow, but also the bottom of the cups are lifting off your chest wall, and it doesn't look like you have any kind of skeletal conditions that would cause this to happen and make it unavoidable.  Anytime you have any sort of weight gain, weight loss or any kind of life event that will cause changes to your body to happen (pregnancy) it's advised to remeasure."
ABraThatFits,3dkm5h,28FFthrowaway,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:48:08 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree that the cups don't fit right.  I'm updating my post with my new measurements! Maybe that will help
ABraThatFits,3dkm5h,MidNightMare5998,5,Sat Jul 18 02:01:28 2015 UTC,"The cups are definitely too small--there's a little bit of overflow, and the underwires are resting on your breast tissue!  The band might also be too big, as the other commenter mentioned, but it might also just be that (because the bra is front-close/nonadjustable and used) it's a bit stretched out. I think a 32DD would be a good size to try next, and perhaps 30E. How do 30 bands fit you? (You can turn the bra upside down to check band fit without the cups getting in the way.)"
ABraThatFits,3dizrr,May_of_Teck,18,Thu Jul 16 17:35:15 2015 UTC,"If the cups feel fine, I would definitely just use an extender for now.   Maybe before future purchases you can post a measurement check/shape help post here?"
ABraThatFits,3dizrr,turkeysrule,10,Thu Jul 16 17:55:43 2015 UTC,"Your measurements would be helpful here. An extender is a good idea, especially if it's a little tight. You can make one yourself out of old bras if you're daring enough.   Sometimes it takes some time to get used to your band size, if it's the right one. Going from one that's 4 inches too big and possibly stretched out, it's going to be different. Depending on how tight the band is, you may want a 38 band, a US 36G (US goes DDD, G, H, UK is E, F, FF) is a UK 36F so you would want a 38E UK or a 38DDD/E(DDD=E) US  If the cups fit, and the shape is correct, you're a 36F UK, 36G US."
ABraThatFits,3dizrr,rainydayseveryday,5,Thu Jul 16 17:54:38 2015 UTC,"I think the UK<->US conversion can vary among brands, depending on how many letters are skipped; is DD is E or just DD, is DDD E or F, etc; this has been my observation. (That or I'm just awful at converting UK to US which could also be the case...) (If I'm a 34K US that means I'd sister size to 36J US, right? But sometimes 36GGUK is translated to 36H US so...) That's a reason why members of this sub recommend using UK sizing.  Anyway, I'm sorry. $70 is pretty standard for a new bra that's in season or a colorway that gets produced regularly. If the band is the only problem then the extender sounds like a good way to solve the issue.  Also, it could be that particular bra tends to run tight; those more familiar with the model you're wearing would be able to tell."
ABraThatFits,3dizrr,syrusbliz,5,Thu Jul 16 17:51:05 2015 UTC,"You can get a bra band extender to make the band just a little longer if you need to while you're breaking it in. They're inexpensive on Amazon and can be used on multiple bras. Also, if you haven't measured recently, I suggest doing so again, and putting those 5 measurements in your post.   It seems like your ordering 36F was a happy accident for the most part as you like the way the cups fit. 36F is one size bigger than the calculator originally recommended for you, 36E."
ABraThatFits,3dizrr,crazymusicalgenius96,5,Thu Jul 16 17:59:34 2015 UTC,"One thing you can do to test the band is to try it on backwards with the cups upside down. If it's okay then, usually the cup size is the problem, but since you said the cups are good it could be just adjusting to the smaller size. As for the size on the tag, look for the UK size. If it says UK 36F, then you got the correct size you ordered because Freya sizes their bras in UK sizing.  Posting your five measurements is a good idea. Freya bands tend to run on the stretchier side, though this could vary by style and I don't know how stretchy the Pure tends to be. It might run more firm than other Freyas. Ideally you'd like not to wear an extender, but it's probably worth at least trying it on with one before you decide. If it is only slightly tight and fits well otherwise, chances are it will relax quickly. I would even say try it on for about 10 minutes at a time, if you have the chance, then take it off and try again later--see if you find yourself getting accustomed to the band. Also, you're likely to find that it feels more snug all around when your breasts are full--that's to be expected. Make sure the cups fit well when you're fully engorged."

ABraThatFits,3dizrr,crazymusicalgenius96,4,Thu Jul 16 18:39:09 2015 UTC,I agree with the other posters- get an extender!  Your rib cage may even become smaller with post-partum weight loss.  JoAnn Fabrics and other sewing stores sell extenders for less than $5.  This is much cheaper and faster than waiting for a replacement bra.
ABraThatFits,3dizrr,PhD-Mom,3,Thu Jul 16 18:19:32 2015 UTC,"On label conversions can be very iffy, much better to rely on the resources here in the side bar, the US brands all have different sizing schemes so stick to UK sizing and convert them individually.  For online stores there is info on here about which sizing schemes they use for their selection boxes.  The chances of the first bra that you ordered fitting were infinitessimally small.  Sorry but that's the fact of it, you'll need to try on quite a few hence we recommend going for a store with free returns and ordering each bra in at least two sizes (if money is tight it can be better to order fewer styles in the two sizes rather than multiple styles in one) so that you can work out if issues are from sizing or, if neither fits, probably from the bra being the wrong shape.  If you post your measurements and an assessment of your shape you can at least get guidance towards what might work for you."
ABraThatFits,3dkbgv,Servage,4,Thu Jul 16 23:28:56 2015 UTC,"whenever I move my arm up or in front, they'll gap and my nipples will want to come out and say hi   This is a huge problem. Nipples should never be on show in a bra unless you've bought a 1/4 cup bra (or peek-a-boo, or sheer)  Most stores don't carry many sizes and often fit people into the nearest size they stock. From looking at you, I wouldn't be shocked if you could wear a 28 band or below.  Judging by the first picture, you're wearing your bra too low. The underwire needs to be sitting at the crease/fold at the bottom of your boobs. Under but touching... like a shelf :D  It also looks as though your boobs are too wide and shallow (rather than too small) for the cups, which are more narrow and projected than your boobs. The cups are like glasses, and your boobs need more of a gradual, bowl shape. Imagine trying to fit a glass over an orange... there will be space inside the glass where the orange can't squeeze into it to fill it out! Your boobs aren't managing to squeeze themselves into the cups, or if they are, they simply fall out, and then the cups are empty. Not because your boobs are too small, but because they're too big to stay inside.  The 32A is waaaay too small in the cups! Do you see how there's a space at the front under your strap as your boobs are pulling the cups away from the body, causing the band to wrinkle/strain? Might also be a case of straps needing to be tightened.  The sunnie looks the best fit, but as it's a moulded cup, if you push it with your arm it will scrunch up like that.  Have you tried the bra size calculator on the right?  If I were to eyeball, I'd put you at 28DD/E but measurements will give a better idea as to what's going wrong. I'm pretty sure that the cups of your bras are too small and not held tightly enough to you. It looks like your cups are sliding away from your body because your boobs are wider than the underwires."

ABraThatFits,3dkbgv,MidNightMare5998,3,Fri Jul 17 02:18:39 2015 UTC,"This is going to seem counterintuitive, but I think that both of the cups in your pictures aren't big enough. To me, you look more like a 28D/DD or similar.   Try taking your measurements on this site if you haven't already, and share your results here along with the measurements you took so we can figure out what direction to point you in with more ease."
ABraThatFits,3dkbgv,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Fri Jul 17 03:02:56 2015 UTC,"Hey there!  Just a few quick questions...did you swoop and scoop when you put these bras on? Swooping and scooping makes sure that your breast tissue is all in the cups instead of other places, like the band. When you put on your bra, lean over and gently scoop each boob into the cups with your hands, making sure none of it gets stuck under the wires. If your nipples are suddenly hovering above the edge of the cup, then the 30Cs are probably too small!  Second question: is the gore (the triangular part where the underwires meet between your boobs) touching your sternum? I can't quite tell from the pictures. If it's not touching your sternum, then that's another sign that the bras are too small.  Lastly, have you measured using our measuring guide before? Adding those 5 measurements to your post would also be helpful for making suggestions.  A little gaping when you slouch is normal, but nip slips are definitely not normal. I think there's a bra out there that will work better for you than the ones you've got here. Seeing your measurements will help us suggest a size to start with.  (If you want to keep the ill-fitting ones for fun push-up potential, that's totally fine! You do you. I admit that even in my new size, I've got a push-up bra that is a less than ideal fit on me. I mostly needed a beige bra but it has the bonus side-effect of giving me tavern wench cleavage.)"
ABraThatFits,3dkbgv,joanna70,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:59:45 2015 UTC,"Hi there!   I did try to scoop and swoop before putting these on, what makes you ask? The middle parts do touch my sternum, and I will try to get on the measuring guide as soon as possible :)  How much gapping would you consider normal? Thanks for taking the time to answer my confused boob questions, haha!"
ABraThatFits,3dkbgv,crazymusicalgenius96,3,Fri Jul 17 00:17:26 2015 UTC,"Probably just language but you swoop and scoop immediately after putting the bra on, not before :).  Moulded bras are the trickiest to get right but are the most common in the smaller cup smaller band range, worth trying some different shapes like half cups (padded half cups can be great for shallow boobs, try Cleo Maddie in 28DD/E for example) and seamed balconettes."
ABraThatFits,3dkbgv,hurrrrrmione,2,Fri Jul 17 10:19:52 2015 UTC,"I asked about the swoop and scoop because it can be the difference between occasional nip slips and nipples not actually fitting in the bra. Like /u/xuenylom, I would say that these bras are the wrong shape as well as slightly too small, which is also contributing to the gaping. As for a normal amount of gaping if you slouch, I'm not really sure there is one, but it's usually pretty slight and can be hidden by a t-shirt."

ABraThatFits,3djt9w,_veritas,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:05:17 2015 UTC,"I'm also projected and FOB (and fairly narrow), so I think the Lily could work well for you. It gives a rounded shape, which I really like about Cleo's, and the wires/wings don't stab my underarms, which is nice."

Masquerade Medina is PERFECT in width for me but the wires are too short and I don't think it's projected enough, so I get a tiny bit of side spillage which is then poked by the too-short wires as the day progresses.   I'm not planning on buying new bras until the ones I have are completely worn out (the Deco is getting close which is why the Deco Vibe is next on my list) and I'm not quite sure what to do when that time comes. I feel like Masquerade would have been my dream brand had I found ABTF a year or two before I actually did, but most of the bras that would have worked best for me are long gone now. I should probably try Comexim half cups as they are unmistakably gorgeous and also not too expensive, but I worry they'll be too open on top.

ABraThatFits,3djt9w,jlcl119,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:21:16 2015 UTC,I like the Juna as well as the Lucy. The Lucy is my favorite of all time and I think the Juna is similar in shape but more shallow (28FF works fine/better than the 28F). I'm fairly projected and full on bottom.

My cleos fit fine on losest hooks but since there isn't much of the felt bit under I will get irritated by hooks. I wear extender for a few wearings and the band will stretch and I either move to middle hooks or hooks stop scratching me since they are not being pulled so tight.  They are handy!"

ABraThatFits,3djyyh,MrsJingo,2,Thu Jul 16 23:10:45 2015 UTC,You could be right. I find that rubber stuff really irritates my skin and my strapless bra (which is a size too big) feels like the tightest one I own.
ABraThatFits,3djyyh,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:23:02 2015 UTC,"I think that's the issue, honestly. The welts are still there from yesterday. I used the swoop and scoop method this morning and the band is lower and no issues!"

ABraThatFits,3djyyh,MidNightMare5998,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:06:32 2015 UTC,"I have no, but I will. I will say the band is so tight that it's hard to get a finger between the band and my rib cage."
ABraThatFits,3djyyh,hurrrrrmione,2,Thu Jul 16 22:13:42 2015 UTC,"See if scooping and swooping changes anything.   If it doesn't, I would advise just trying to wear the bra for a few days. You might just need to get used to the feeling. The band also might loosen up a bit within that time."
ABraThatFits,3djyyh,turkeysrule,3,Thu Jul 16 22:18:51 2015 UTC,"Scooping and swooping did help! It's almost like the band was riding too high? When I did initially take the bra off, I was left with painful red welps. For reference, my snug underbust is 27.5 inches and my tight is 27."
ABraThatFits,3djyyh,turkeysrule,4,Thu Jul 16 22:45:12 2015 UTC,I would definitely not recommend going up a band size then. In fact a 28 band might work better on you after you get used to wearing 30 bands.   I'm glad it helped!

I'm very full on bottom, and they give me good lift without gaping, but they also work well with full on top types, because the open top doesn't dig into the tissue and create quad boob.

Depending on your own skin tone, you may find other bra colours acting even more 'nude' than those of 'nude' colour. If you have a light skin tone, 'cream' or light 'yellow' and even light 'pink' colour works better: the nude one may be too dark. And if you have a darker skin tone, with a tan, you may find some brown and, surprisingly, orange bras work much better."

ABraThatFits,3did2n,paintedredrose,2,Fri Jul 17 03:12:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah the Tango II is a super difficult fit in this size range, I would definitely not recommend it to try starting out. I tried it starting out and it was just hilariously bad, I think I've seen one semi-decent fit of it in this range in like a year. Curvy Kate Smoothie comes in beige tone (two different ones actually so you may be able to get a deal on one of the two) and 28D, it may or may not work but since it's molded is more forgiving under clothes than the Tango at least. Smoothie is more closed on top than Maddie, so if you have a taller root or a lot of upper fullness it may not work, but if Maddie's cups seem too tall or kinda gape-y then Smoothie may be worth a go."
ABraThatFits,3did2n,Shanakitty,3,Fri Jul 17 17:49:52 2015 UTC,"For plain beige bras, try Cleo Maddie, Freya Deco Half cup, Cleo Juna (most likely in 28DD). I think there exist nice M&S sets in 28D that come in simple/flat colors but you'd have to get those off ebay. Aerie sells 30Cs/30Ds and you might find some of the bands to be firm (I personally thought they ran true to size). We tend to recommend soft/mesh bras at first because they help diagnose shape and because they are more forgiving."

ABraThatFits,3dkh7g,tokozdragon,3,Fri Jul 17 00:18:05 2015 UTC,"Do you know exactly where the trouble spot on your sternum is? A very low plunge might be able to bypass it if it's high enough, but I wouldn't want to cause you unnecessary pain, so I'd say only go for underwires if you're really unsatisfied with wireless options.  The Freya Deco Soft Cup is a great option for something plain and utilitarian; it comes in beige and black and has a thin foam lining (no push-up, just enough to keep nipples from showing through). Victoria's Secret also has a wireless bra that looks pretty similar to the Deco Soft Cup, so if you have access to a VS store that might be easier for you to try. They also have a longline version of the wireless bra called a ""lounge bra"", which is extra nice because the band is much wider and so the pressure can be more evenly distributed."
ABraThatFits,3dkh7g,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Fri Jul 17 00:40:29 2015 UTC,"It's the last inch or so of my sternum/breastbone, having just poked myself to verify.  ;)    The Freya Deco looks promising, and I do have a VC locally.  I will see what they have. Thank you!"
ABraThatFits,3dkh7g,yellkaa,3,Fri Jul 17 02:01:37 2015 UTC,"maybe, if your breasts are pretty wide set and it's just a last inch, you may try to find a bra in which underwires go around it, not touching it at all? There are some bras with wide and very wide gores, so maybe you may have luck with them?"
ABraThatFits,3dkh7g,otterhugs,2,Fri Jul 17 10:02:34 2015 UTC,"The freya deco soft cup comes to mind, it's wireless and pretty utilitarian, but is still supposed to support you very well. If you'd like to try underwiers that don't touch your sternum I personally feel fine in bras a size big in the band and a size small in the cup (so 32D or 34C for you) as this often is still supportive enough for me but because the cup is too small the underwrites do not touch my sternum, your mileage may vary on that, I don't know if the same trick that works for me will work for you."
ABraThatFits,3dkh7g,rainydayseveryday,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:38:25 2015 UTC,"This is pretty good advice. Also if you pick brands with really soft wires that can bend and then go back to their original shape, like freya or many cheap department store bras, they're so much less painful, and if the gore digs you can just bend it away. Keep in mind the wire length/cup width has to be correct for your shape for this to be valid advice. Otherwise you'll get stabbed somewhere. Or if you really hate gores that much, you can just get a plunge bra where the gore is just a strip of fabric at the bottom, connecting the cups.  Coming from a 32A/30B, no wonder. I have similar measurements, and when I put my old 34Bs on I can't breathe or move, and they leave deep marks after a very short period of time. I have no idea how I lived with those for so long. I can't imagine how bad a 30B would feel.  The freya deco soft cup is super shallow, judging by bratabase. But I don't know much about wireless bras."

The last time I went in there (years ago), they told me I was a 34 or 36C, and I thought they were smoking something. ;)  Of course, then they tried to put me in these giant push-up polkadot crazy things..."
ABraThatFits,3dkh7g,Crikey-Way,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:55:39 2015 UTC,"Well, technically based on your measurements, that isn't the correct size for you, (most people with your measurements would not find 34C to be their best fit, so VS wasn't actually doing anything right by trying to get you in that size, especially the 36C, that's way off) but I'm recommending it because a gore that sits flush with your sternum is a sign of a bra that fits correctly, but if what you're looking for is a gore that doesn't sit flush with your sternum what you want is a bra that doesn't fit perfectly (which is fine, my breasts are close set, I don't always like gores that touch my sternum either). In VS bras I'd recommend trying the 32D first as most of their bras tend to be pretty stretchy, and then moving to 34 if it's too tight."
ABraThatFits,3djx4e,rynia_,6,Thu Jul 16 21:37:15 2015 UTC,"Jasmine seems like the closest one yet! I think 38GG in Jasmine is going to hit the jackpot for your larger breast; the 36GG still looks a bit small. Going to 38GG will be one cup size larger, which hopefully will be just right. It will probably be a little big for your right side, but the stretch lace will help to minimize any gaping you might get, as well as making the strap on that side a little tighter."
ABraThatFits,3djx4e,crazymusicalgenius96,3,Thu Jul 16 21:43:15 2015 UTC,"The Jasmine looks great on you and the stretchy lace is perfect, whereas the closed top bras you've tried and shared here cut into your breasts and don't do any service to the asymmetry. I have the same issues and Jasmine is a favorite of mine (so is the Envy)."
ABraThatFits,3djx4e,ericazibby,2,Thu Jul 16 22:14:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I ordered the next band size in Jasmine, hope its a keeper! Is the Envy sort of cut like the Jasmine?"
ABraThatFits,3djx4e,Goddess_Keira,3,Thu Jul 16 22:21:06 2015 UTC,"I agree 38GG in Jasmine is probably going to be just right on your larger side, and if desired you can pad the smaller or just tighten the strap a bit more, as mentioned above. Envy is fairly similar to Jasmine with more bottom projection (aka immediate projection) and a bit less projected at the apex. Overall, it's quite likely to work for you since you have a projected and full-all-over shape. If Jasmine is good in 38GG, I'd say try that size in Envy also.  The Tango isn't outstandingly great but it isn't bad really. I would call that a wearable fit if lefty stays in there. I'd say keep if it was a good buy, feels comfortable, and you like it well enough that you'll wear it (be sure to try it under some clothes if you're considering keeping it, to see how you like the silhouette). If it cost a lot, doesn't feel comfortable and/or doesn't make you feel good in it, return."
ABraThatFits,3djx4e,ericazibby,2,Thu Jul 16 23:17:25 2015 UTC,"My bigger boob doesn't stay in the cup in my 34 FF Jasmine unless the top I'm wearing is compression-y (like I feel like I could pop out every time I'm bending over unless it's under a tight top), whereas I can get away with feeling less poppy on my left side in the 34 FF Envy. I suspect the Envy has ever so slightly taller cups. That said, I'm pretty short-rooted so maybe that's not the only reason.   I also feel like Envy gives me a projected look while not being as pointy as Jasmine. I like pointy and rounded as look as the projection is good, and it is for both of them which is why they're my favorites.   That said, if I were buying them now I'd keep the Envy in a 34 FF and get a 34 G in the Jasmine."

ABraThatFits,3ditfb,andris94,6,Thu Jul 16 16:48:40 2015 UTC,"The gore looks like it's not tacking and the cups are definitely too small. Also I believe Simone Perele sizing goes A, B, C, D, E, F. So this is actually equal to a UK 30E."
ABraThatFits,3ditfb,plutonium743,2,Thu Jul 16 17:07:33 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely correct. Simone Perele is a French brand, and they use single letters like EU sizing."

ABraThatFits,3ditfb,wambrita,4,Fri Jul 17 14:46:07 2015 UTC,That bra looks too shallow and too small. The wire is probably not in the IMF.  BTW: You should totally shorten band of your bikini top if you are needle-savvy.
ABraThatFits,3ditfb,j_sunrise,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:56:09 2015 UTC,"30FF sounds about right. This bra looks too shallow for you, and the cups seem too small. Is the gore tacking? It kind of looks like it isn't from the picture. That could mean that the cups are too small, or too shallow. But I think they're both of those things.  Edit: holy shallow. This is the smallest cup depth I've ever seen in this size by half an inch, so plutonium is probably right about the 30E thing. So this bra is about two cup volumes too small, and it's pretty shallow."
ABraThatFits,3ditfb,rainydayseveryday,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:29:37 2015 UTC,"UK 30E may be even a bit bigger than this one if they add each cup only 2 cm instead of a full inch, as it's pretty common in European bras."

ABraThatFits,3dfv2v,iWishiWereInvincible,19,Wed Jul 15 23:07:52 2015 UTC,Could you please measure yourself as shown in the beginner's guide and let us know your measurements? That'll help us give better suggestions for bras you can try
ABraThatFits,3dfv2v,hurrrrrmione,14,Wed Jul 15 23:21:47 2015 UTC,"So, I went by the Bra Size Calculator's requested measurements, and here's what I got:  Snug Underbust: 26  Tight Underbust: 24 Standing Bust: 30 Leaning Bust: 32 Lying Bust: 30  The calculator said I'm estimated to be a 26E...? So confused. My boobs are tiny."
ABraThatFits,3dfv2v,Shanakitty,38,Wed Jul 15 23:58:18 2015 UTC,"26E does look about right, but 26 bands are incredibly difficult to find (usually custom order), so you'd probably do better to start out with 28DDs that run tight and then take the band in/buy a Rixie Clip if needed. Here are some examples of women wearing 26Es and its sister sizes. Do any of these women look about like you?  There's this cultural idea that A=small, B=medium-small, C=medium-large, D=large, DD=extra large, and anything above that is insanely huge. That is based on how bras were made before the 1970s and is just not true at all now. Very few women will wear A-cups when properly fitted, and DD tends to be a small to medium bust depending on the band size. Cup size is meaningless without band size, and a 26DD will be much smaller than a 36DD. In terms of volume 26E=28DD=30D=32C=34B, though they are made for women with different proportions. If you haven't been able to find anything smaller than a 30 band, it makes sense that you would end up in 30A or 30B, even though the cups are much too small, because the band is as big as your standing bust measurement, and a too-big band can make the cups seem bigger than they are. A 30A is made for someone with an approximately 30"" underbust and 31"" bust.   Since you feel like you have small breasts, you might have a shallow shape (or stealth-breasts), which are common in this size range. With shallow breasts, the volume is spread out over a wider area and doesn't seem to stick out as far (think of a bowl vs. a glass or a plate vs. a bowl that both hold the same volume), so they can look smaller than they are. Check out the Beginner's Guide in the side bar and try to get an idea of your shape. It's ok if you aren't 100% sure right away, but it will allow us to give you more specific suggestions about bras that could work well for you. Shape is just as important as size in determining a good fit."
ABraThatFits,3dfv2v,hurrrrrmione,14,Thu Jul 16 00:10:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, they absolutely look like me. The girl in the second image in particular who's listed as a 26E looks about exactly like me. ""Cups typically being too deep, not filling out the top of cups... those are generally the traits of a shallow breast...""  That quote really fits me, as my bras tend to be filled out at the bottom of the cup, but the top of the cups are empty. So I think I'm shallow."
ABraThatFits,3dfv2v,joanna70,7,Thu Jul 16 00:20:35 2015 UTC,"How about fullness? Do you think your breasts are full-on-top, full-on-bottom, or even?"
ABraThatFits,3dfv2v,gliterpoison,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:32:19 2015 UTC,I'd say if anything I'm a little more full on bottom. :)
ABraThatFits,3dfv2v,hurrrrrmione,4,Thu Jul 16 04:59:53 2015 UTC,"With 2"" between your standing and leaning measurements for your bust it means you may not be shallow, so stay open minded.  Shallow boobs can often measure the same, or 1"" apart.  You won't probably be super projected, but you may not be at the shallow end of the spectrum either.  remember that the bras you've been wearing haven't wrapped snugly around your body so it's no surprise your boobs fall downwards."
ABraThatFits,3dfv2v,intangiblemango,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:19:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe so. I just knew if anything that I'd be closer to the shallow side than the projected side, but I'm not super shallow, either."

If you decide to buy a bra online, make sure it's free shipping/returns, you'll most likely have to return a couple before you get the right one.   Why I recommend free shipping/returns: I also measured a 26E. I'm currently spilling out of a 32D. I was unable to find a 26E so I tried a couple of 28DDs. They were all huge. They cups were too big and to wide. The band was okay, much better than the 32, but still pulled away from my body at least an inch. It was the most bizarre thing, I think a lot of it has to do with different bra shops have different sizes and women having different body types. It seems like women with small underbusts have a really hard time finding bras.   Be patient! I hope you can find one that fits properly! Good luck!"

Getting a well-fitting bra (even a 28DD will help if you don't want to order customs) will really make a difference. Here's the shallow guide. It has a lot of great bra recommendations (but you'll generally have to get them in 28 bands, and some don't carry 28Ds which is a possibility for you). I suggest the Cleo Juna and Deco Half cup to start.    Ewa Michalak CH and Ewa Michalak HP (Polish brand...not sure about their fullness) might work if you want a 26 band.

ABraThatFits,3dgxij,garden-state,2,Thu Jul 16 04:36:36 2015 UTC,"I think that first Blakely blue one looks the best on you, like the least shallow.  It's very hard to tell in a molded bra whether the wires are the right width for you - molded bras tend to mask a lot of fit issues that unlined bras can't hide.  The Sofies are all quite a bit too shallow for you, with the underwires sitting too low and not in your IMF, and obvious folding/wrinkling at the bottom of the cup.  Unfortunately, this will likely be your result with every molded bra from any American or UK manufacturer.  I've had some degree of luck with Figleaves' house line Lulu Tout, and the Madeline Tee shirt bra.  It runs pretty tight in the band, so size up (probably try a 38DD), or get a 36E and plan on using an extender at first.  It is still slightly too shallow at the bottom, but it's hands down the most projected UK molded bra I ever found.  A super soft bra that is lightly padded but not seamless, that allows for more immediate projection in the larger size range, is Cleo Juna.  It runs a cup small, I'd recommend trying it in a 36F.  It's soooo comfortable.  If you're absolutely dead set on a seamless molded bra, that first blue one is probably close to the best you'll get."
ABraThatFits,3dgxij,lcl0706,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:02:04 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah they definitely aren't on my IMF and sitting too low, but that's an issue I've had with every bra I've tried so far, molded and unlined alike. I might give the lulu tout and Madeline bras a try, I've had pretty bad luck with the Cleo bras I've tried (the wires dig in and are very painful against my ribcage). The only reason I'm confused why you think the blue one fits better is because out of all of these bras, the gore floated the most on that one, and not because of a cup size issue, but more because the shape of the cups didn't seem right (at least that's what I thought). Should I not be that concerned about the gore in a molded bra then? Because the Sofie's and even the other Blakely bra did a much better job of the gore making some contact with my chest."
ABraThatFits,3dgxij,lcl0706,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:12:28 2015 UTC,"Lulu Tout is the brand, Madeleine is the name of the bra.  One bra ;-)  Sorry I didn't word that clearly.  I guess I can't see the gore not tacking from the pictures, so didn't realize it was floating.  The shape of those cups is better, IMO, look at the bottom of it - the wires are at least closer to where they belong.  A tacking gore is a sign of a good fit, but since none of these are a good fit, it's up to you which you'd rather live with - a floating gore or cups folding in half at the bottom.  Either way, you're losing some support.  The gore could float for a number of reasons - cups too small, cups too wide, cups too shallow, gore too wide for the space between your boobs, etc.  Do you have your measurements around anywhere?  You likely won't find a padded or molded bra projected enough unless you go Polish, and since I can't tell what your root width is, I don't know if their narrow wires will work for you.  You could probably have luck with Panache's unlined bras like Envy or Floris, and probably Cleo's unlineds like Lily/Erin, Marcie, or Lucy.  Panache makes Cleo and is known for their firm wires, and also firm bands in the Cleo unlined line.  I don't know what bras you've tried from them, but if the band was tight it could definitely make the wires dig in.

ABraThatFits,3dgkab,hurrrrrmione,2,Thu Jul 16 02:52:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much!  Well, I just tried them all on again and can tell you that this made a big difference. The bands were still cutting in to my skin but I definitely filled in the cups. The sister size is 42G, would that be my next try?  Maybe my biggest issue is with the ""look"" I want? It bothers me to look down and see a big gap between my breasts. I want to look down and see cleavage, but not uni-boob.. Are there any certain descriptions I should look for?   Thanks again for the help."
ABraThatFits,3dgkab,Goddess_Keira,3,Thu Jul 16 03:23:19 2015 UTC,"Hi. I think we need some more information, if you wouldn't mind answering a few questions. Firstly, would you say that you have a pendulous shape? This is extremely common in this size range and is nothing to be embarrassed about. And would you say your breast are wide-set? How many fingers can you fit comfortably between them when they hang naturally?  Also, do you think you could give some more information about the fit of each bra, or some of them at least? Is there one that stood out as the best or the worst? It would help so much if you could give more detailed descriptions. You say they were all varying degrees of being too tight. Which felt most tight, and which was the closest to feeling right in the band? Also, do you have the bras still? If you do, could you please try each of them on with the band done up in front on the loosest hooks, right under your breasts, and the cups upside down on your back? Are they still too tight if you do this?"
ABraThatFits,3dgkab,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:09:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the help! I would say yes to the pendulous shape and  I can fit 1 finger in between.   Parfait by Affinitas Women's Charlotte Padded Push-Up Bra and Elomi Women's Plus-Size Bijou Soiree UW Banded Moulded Bra were both too tight and rigid, felt like they were cutting into my armpits. Also the underwire was poking right in between my breasts.  Elomi Women's Plus-Size Orla UW Plunge Bra was the best fit, just a bit snug and I had to pull the shoulder straps almost to the tightest level. This one really separated my breasts though which was my main problem with it.   Curvy Kate Womens Daily Boost Bra was snug and the underwire in the middle jabbed me.  Curvy Kate Women's Dreamcatcher Balcony Bra the band cut in and it was scratchy feeling. Also jabby middle part of underwire.  I would say the upside down and backwards all but this one were still too tight Elomi Women's Plus-Size Orla UW Plunge Bra was the only one that seemed to fit this way.  By too tight I mean - could barely hook it and felt like I would have deep red marks after wearing for a few hours."
ABraThatFits,3dgkab,Goddess_Keira,3,Thu Jul 16 03:48:59 2015 UTC,"Okay. So if you can only fit one finger, you aren't wide-set. If you're pendulous, almost by definition you aren't truly shallow because your breasts will be much more projected in a bra, which is how we assess this. Parfait Charlotte would have been too shallow for sure, and those Curvy Kate bras are shallow in the bottom and that's not what you need.  I suspect the plunges didn't work well for you because you have soft tissue, which often tends to go hand-in-hand with being pendulous. This is contributing to the droopy look you're getting.   Sadly, going to a sister size of 42G is going to make that drooping worse, if anything. You need to get support from your bands, and often in your size range that comes from going down a band size. At a 40 band you're 1"" above your snug measurement and we often suggest that someone with your measurements would go to a 38 band. That will not work for you though if you still find all the bras except Orla to be too tight.  I want to suggest one different style for you to try from Elomi, and that is Elomi Rita. I think you should try it in both 40G and 40GG, and do always remember to scoop and swoop. Rita is quite generous in the cup, so it might fit you in a 40G but it would be best to try both sizes and see which is better and if you think either fits well enough to be comfortable. The 40 band should be okay and if the cup is fitting you well, you're going to find that the band relaxes after a bit of wear. You should do the backwards try-on with these too. Overall the 40GG will of course be a bit looser than 40G, because it's designed to be an inch bigger around the bust when it's worn.   If you wish, you can post a fit check for this or any other bras you decide to try. Other Elomi bras to try would be their basic Caitlyn bra and their Etta bra, again in 40G and 40GG. I'm recommending that you stick with Elomi for starters, because their bands are more likely to be wearable for you. Also, you should not have to pull the straps to the highest level in order to get lift. Part of the reason you were doing this might have been because the cups were a little bit big even after scoop & swoop, and you were compensating for that."
ABraThatFits,3dgkab,hurrrrrmione,3,Thu Jul 16 04:16:19 2015 UTC,I just placed my order for the Rita in 40G and 40GG. I'll let you know how it goes. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking time to help me :)

ABraThatFits,3dha8i,matsimonster,2,Thu Jul 16 07:04:38 2015 UTC,"I have a similar shape and size and I really like the Panache Sport. It does tend to run tight in the band and the cups may gape too much on top if you're FOB, so consider sister-sizing up in the band and maybe going a cup size down (I personally don't do this, just get the smallest size I wear in other bras, but YMMV)."
ABraThatFits,3dha8i,braaccount,2,Thu Jul 16 12:28:40 2015 UTC,Thank you bunches and oodles! I've ordered the bra and I'm hopeful. I can't wait for a fitting sports bra!
ABraThatFits,3dha8i,syrusbliz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:45:27 2015 UTC,"Panache Sport is a great choice. I'm 36GG, 2/5, FoB and initially got it in 36G (blue/orange colorway). Overall the fit was good but I got a little spillage on the sides so sized up to a 36GG on my next (magenta/orange colorway like on your link) purchase and it's fantastic. (I prefer to have 2 sports bras in rotation.)  If you're short like me, the J-hook is at the perfect spot. If you're tall it could be a bit uncomfortable; just adjust the straps like you normally would and skip the j-hook. (Personally I love having it just for weights.)  Overall it's a little shallow but does a great job of compressing and holding everything in place."
ABraThatFits,3dhap3,tangledThespian,2,Thu Jul 16 07:11:25 2015 UTC,"Both those bras will be shallow on the bottom, the Maddie is wide, not sure on how wide the CK wires will be in comparison (always good to hold them up to each other to compare wires and then compare fit).  If you're fitting them okay (are you fully swooping and scooping?) then you are probably FOT and your boobs aren't fighting bras that are probably too wide, equally you might have a short and wide root which does suit these styles.  FOT boobs are reasonably well served with moulded bras, Freya Deco plunge is a good starting place.  Cleo Maddie comes up large in the band (did you try it on backwards, I'm betting the cup may actually be a little small making the band feel tight?) and small in the cup, most people size up in the cup and down in band for it.  So, if Madddie, when you're swooped and scooped, fits really well, you would want to try Deco in 34E and 34F I'd say."
ABraThatFits,3dhap3,joanna70,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:10:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, rest assured I am swooping and scooping, haha! I didn't think to try the Maddie on backwards, I'll admit, so the cups may have been the source of tightness. Having been in the habit of wearing 36 and 38 bands, I just assumed it was a reasonable adjustment to make. 'This is what an actually snug band feels like' sort of deal. As it is, it still feels lovely on the whole, and I've never worn anything that tacks like the guides say it should, so close still feels great. Plus, no sideboob, no quadboob, no floating underwire.  I've heard good things about the deco! I definitely gave it a look before, but ultimately passed it up for the balconettes. I've come to associate plunges with 'cups I will pop out of', but it's probably time to give it a try in my actual size. Thanks!"
ABraThatFits,3dhap3,joanna70,2,Fri Jul 17 03:57:37 2015 UTC,"With soft tissue you might fall out of them, it can happen even in the right size so it's right to be wary of that.  There are full cups such as Fantasie Rebecca that would give more coverage without being massive."
ABraThatFits,3dhap3,lcl0706,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:43:11 2015 UTC,"Welp, I may have been foolish and just bought a relatively cheap plunge bra from that Uplift clearance sale.. So I guess I can hold off on that deco for now and possibly save myself more trouble later.  I'll keep the Rebecca in mind if I can't convince these stubborn things to stay in a sufficiently large-cupped plunge bra."
ABraThatFits,3dhap3,CherryAmesAgain,2,Fri Jul 17 12:00:47 2015 UTC,"If you're projected & FOB, Maddie is not your bra. It is very shallow & caters to FOT. If the gore doesn't tack, that's a good indicator ithe cups are either too small or too shallow or both.   I 2nd the recommendation to try the Deco. Also Cleo Juna, a cup size up since it runs small in the cup."
ABraThatFits,3dghh2,brekkabek,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:11:50 2015 UTC,"Well, if you're pendulous you're not shallow.  Shallow is when your breasts have little projection (or hanging) away from the body, and where the roots are relatively wide and the breast tissue remains close to the body no matter what position you're in. I have a 4"" difference between standing and leaning OB as well.  I'm assuming you mean 33 in your snug measurement.  I think 32F is a good place to start.  It sounds like you have short roots, which may cause gapping in the tops of a lot of cups.  Have you tried a Cleo Lucy?  Cleo bands run snug, you might want to try a 32F and 34E.  Curvy Kate's Bardot might also be another one.  Panache Envy is another one with a lot of immediate projection that tends to fit well on pendulous breasts, if you don't find it having too much room in the stretch lace at the top of the cup."
ABraThatFits,3dghh2,lcl0706,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:30:57 2015 UTC,"And just to explain a little further, shallowness is about the WHOLE area of attachement, the taller AND wider your roots the shallower you are, on average.  If you have some projection then you won't be both tall or wide, but you might be one of those.  Very projected almost certainly means you are short and narrow.  The root is directly behind the breast, it can't really be higher up as such but obviously pendulous breasts are likely to hang down below the ""inframammary fold"", the lower point of your root where the underwire should sit.  It sounds overall like your root is short and wide, and gapping at the strap can be an issue.  You may also have an omega shape where the breast broadens out as it gets away from the root.  For shape, try leaning over 90 degrees, if your nipples point directly to the floor you are probably even, if to your chin you are FOB, and to your feet FOT."
ABraThatFits,3dghh2,joanna70,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:16:37 2015 UTC,They point directly downward. I'd done this in my first post but I guess I forgot to list it
ABraThatFits,3dghh2,joanna70,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:21:16 2015 UTC,"You said ""likely full on bottom"" but this makes them more even.  Where FOB might be useful is that FOB bras can work well for many shorter roots even where they shape is even to FOT, so don't rule out FOB bras."

Jude?  Even more shallow (seriously, who does this fit?), and when I picked it up off Amazon months ago it was only $19.  Loretta is also a tough fit (and was already $14).  If these bras work for you - wonderful, I'm not trying to take that away.  But I'm really unimpressed so far."
ABraThatFits,3de7gs,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:44:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they took Jude off for a while, and then put them back online 2 days ago. I don't blame them in that case; the bra has been discontinued for 2 years and they're STILL trying to unload them all. But Curvy Kate Smoothie and Loretta do work for slightly more people, and haven't been discontinued quite that long."

The only one in 28 bands is Panache Idina, but there are considerably more options in 30+ bands. I saw a couple Betsy Johnsons, Calvin Kleins, Natoris, a BUNCH of Simone Perele...basically any non-UK brand that's commonly sold at Nordstrom except Wacoal. It says the 30% off will be taken at checkout, it isn't listed in the price (I checked, Idina was still full price for me)."

The bra I'm excited about seeing is Curvy Kate Daily Dream...a redesign of Daily Boost. I've only seen Daily Boost fit one person ever, so I want to see if the redesign made it any better. So far preliminary reports are saying it was successful, so I'm hopeful!"
ABraThatFits,3de7gs,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:45:32 2015 UTC,"I have no idea. If you like the band tightness, stick with 28F. If you think the band could be looser, get 30E. I would imagine the difference in strap length between the two sizes is negligible. The cups are most likely taller in the 28F/30E, which will help with the straps being long enough."

The band runs really tight so order a size up. Cups are kind of shallow and really open towards the center. I got great cleavage with them. This is all for the version without the purple trim on the upper edge of the cup (haven't tried that version, it might fit differently)."
ABraThatFits,3de7gs,plrs199,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:30:09 2015 UTC,I'm looking at the Neve and it seems like only the floral bra in 30DD is a part of the prime deals the rest are showing up the regular price...

ABraThatFits,3dhm43,Helliphant,2,Thu Jul 16 09:57:08 2015 UTC,"Can you give us an idea of whether you are full on bottom or top and if you're very shallow? I think the back looks like you could wear a normal strapless but I'm not sure. Some strapless bras are quite shallow. I think if you're more average projection try Deco or Evie.  Panache Moulded Strapless is shallow and so are many in stores (you're in the bra matrix so you can find strapless bras lots of places! Though because of stretchy bands in some store brands you may want to try 32DD/Es) If you don't think you can wear a normal strapless, a corset is an option. Or there are things like this and this but I don't know if their shapes would work for you. But you kind of just have to try things."

But this is more about where you need the most room in a bra cup, so it's better to judge when supported. Another easy way to get a good idea of fullness is to stand in front of a mirror and bend at a 90 deg angle. If your nipples point more towards your head, you're full on bottom. If they point more towards your feet, they're full on top. If they point straight down, they're even."

Then like a month or so later when I decided to return it, I saw that the same thing had went to 'clearance' but was marked up like $50 from what was on the tag when I bought it, with a better coupon.

I really wouldn't worry much about the wire width at this point, but you could always try Comexim if need be. Freya Patsy isn't super plungey, but it's fairly shallow and it's open on top. The Maddie is good for full on top, but I don't know. And you've not tried the Deco 1/2 cup yet? I've heard Parfait by Affinitas is quite shallow. Sorry I don't have better suggestions!

ABraThatFits,3dfwlm,HedgehogFund,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:38:51 2015 UTC,"I said that because they carry such a tiny percentage of the bra sizes available (like...10%? I did the math once), and the fitters aren't trained well (friend ""K"" took 3 hrs to be fitted as a 34DDD, actually a 30F). But that's good feedback and I'll definitely add that to the list.  As for the fonts, there's not a huge amount I can do without messing with the HTML directly, but I'll play around with it."

I would recommend them to someone who knows that they fit in the bras--shallow, doesn't mind the extra stretchy wings, and doesn't mind being hounded by every sales person (I hate the VS has gone away from customer focused and has transitioned to $$ focused)--because, really, their range of bras isn't much different than any other boutique--Lane Bryant, Frederick's, etc."

ABraThatFits,3dfquv,silvery9,3,Wed Jul 15 22:35:31 2015 UTC,Maybe try a panache envy. That will have lots more projection than the Andorra. It's sliding down because it's too shallow for you and your measurements suggest it's also 2 cup sizes too small as well. The Envy should fix that. Definitely start with a 32G.
ABraThatFits,3dfquv,lcl0706,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:07:23 2015 UTC,Are the wires sliding down after you wear the bra for a bit or are you just not able to get the wires up into your IMF in the first place?
ABraThatFits,3dfquv,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:40:59 2015 UTC,A little bit of both.  I can position it up there but not exactly where it's supposed to be.  It slides down pretty quickly after that.
ABraThatFits,3dfquv,applesangria,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:42:43 2015 UTC,"If your measurements are accurate, then your size should be a 32GG or a sister size 30H or 34G.   I'm baffled as to how a 32F Andorra fit well. I'm guessing that because the cup was too small, there wasn't enough projection or space for the breast tissue. When there isn't enough space in the cup, the wires don't stay where they should. The pressure from the breast tissue pushes them down, creating a space/gap at the bottom and sides of the cup. I think if you had the Andorra in the proper size, that spacing wouldn't be an issue."
ABraThatFits,3dfquv,yellkaa,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:20:55 2015 UTC,"it sits too low down on my chest leaving a gap in the bottom of the cup.    What happens if you try first to put your breasts in the cups, then put the wires right on your IMF, and only after that close the bra hooks? Does it stay on its place? How are the cups when it's there?"
ABraThatFits,3dfquv,joanna70,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:54:12 2015 UTC,"I'd say Cleo Lucy too, wide gore, mediumish wires (which clearly might be too wide).  Cleo Meg if you can find it is like Cleo Lily/Erin which is narrow and even shape, Meg is slightly more closed on top I think.  There are several Freya plunge balconettes which are narrow and FOB such as Ooh La La, Annabel etc.  Just avoid Gem and Rio which are more even to FOT, and Enchanted which is FOB but wider."
ABraThatFits,3dfohw,shellobell333,2,Wed Jul 15 22:17:24 2015 UTC,"This could either be that the wires are too tall or that the wires are the wrong width.

ABraThatFits,3dfohw,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:46:01 2015 UTC,"This could be a fit issue; it can happen if wires are too narrow, resting on breast tissue, and it can also happen if the wires are too wide.

ABraThatFits,3dfohw,joanna70,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:30:26 2015 UTC,"Can be because they're too tall, too short (flesh wrapping over the top, happens to me), too wide or too narrow, hence you have to diagnose the fit overall :)"

ABraThatFits,3dflf2,turkeysrule,2,Wed Jul 15 22:08:05 2015 UTC,"That certainly makes me less surprised! In that case I can see why I'm not too uncomfortable in my bras, and especially the sports bra because its quite roomy."
ABraThatFits,3dflf2,asdf1011,3,Wed Jul 15 22:19:42 2015 UTC,"You say you're in the UK, have you gone to Bravissimo by any chance? They carry brands like Cleo by Panache as mentioned previously, as well as other brands.  You could also check their website for their entire stock. You may like some of their housebrand bras, such as this or this if you want funner, padded bras.   A lot of the bras sold there are unpadded though, so just read the descriptions."
ABraThatFits,3dflf2,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Wed Jul 15 23:51:13 2015 UTC,"Definitely second Panache and Cleo like others have mentioned. Also, Le Mystere makes some really nice padded/moulded bras in pretty styles and colors."

ABraThatFits,3dflf2,Julez22,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:18:03 2015 UTC,"As no-one else has warned you there are good reasons why larger cupped bras are often seamed and lacy/mesh etc.  The seams give support and structure and shape to the boobs, moulded padded bras can only support so much, there is no structure to them, they're depending on the straps holding the foam up, and they tend to be shallower (ie more upright) at the bottom to push the breasts up rather than being able to cup them.  The further issue is that they have their own shape and therefore mask fitting issues, which makes it more difficult to get a good fit until you know more about your size and shape, and we tend not to recommend them at the beginning of finding your ABTF.  And finally, in larger cup sizes there are way fewer of them, and way fewer choices of shape.  High street stores stock them because they're cheap to make once you have the mould, much cheaper than a good seamed bra, and you just change the detail on them.  However, they tend to use only one or two moulds, hence the lack of variatino in shape, you'll either fit that brand of bras or not.  FOB shapes, if you are one, aren't well served by moulded bras, as per the comment about them being more upright in the lower half, they don't give the breast space and will often sit too low because of it.  The bra will then have wrinkles and empty space at the bottom because the breast migrates upwards towards the deepest part.  Lace feels awful when it doesn't fit, it gapes and moves and itches.  Correct fitting bras are made to sit very firm and still against your skin.  I have had bras where the wires are too narrow and the cup too projected and the lace itches in the slight gap at the nipple and elsewhere.  In the right fit the seam sits on the nipple and stops most ""see through"" and the lace/mesh will sit firm.  Most larger cupped bras are more firm mesh than they are lace.  Just all things to be aware of and look out for, hopefully you'll find something you love!"

ABraThatFits,3df4ck,rynia_,4,Wed Jul 15 19:53:17 2015 UTC,"It is small in the cups, but I'm sure you expected that since the wrong size was sent. It looks like 38GG would be about right in the Lily, although I think you will get a lot of loose fabric up top. Instead of Lily, you might want to try the Panache Jasmine or Envy, both of which have stretch lace up top that will fit better. There's also the Sculptresse by Panache Chi-Chi, which is based on the Jasmine but it's from the fuller-figure Panache line. They use a different band, and I think it's nicer myself. I'd order one of those styles in both 38G and 38GG to be able to compare the sizes.  For a different brand, you might want to look into Elomi. Their wires are very wide so in the right size will encompass all boobage. There are many styles you could try, but I'd say their basic Caitlyn (if you don't mind full coverage) or Rita bra are good ones to try first, and I think you would want the 38G in those although again it never hurts to order a couple of sizes. Elomi's bands run stretchier than Cleo so they shouldn't be as constricting in the 38."
ABraThatFits,3df4ck,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:16:33 2015 UTC,"I just ordered a Jasmine from Amazon (yay for sales).  I got a Tango too, but the pictures of it look like the top section isn't stretchy so that may not work out.  The Elomi Rita looks like you can clip it racerback if you wanted to, but that's gonna have to languish on my wishlist until I after I get returns credited. * Also I suppose I should start trying trying to find an insert for the smaller side. Any recommendations or tips?"
ABraThatFits,3df4ck,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:48:38 2015 UTC,"I don't have any specific recommendations for inserts because I don't use them myself, so I'm not familiar with all the products out there. There are quite a few different ones on the market. I'd say just look on Amazon or on lingerie sites like Bare Necessities and HerRoom for what they sell and there are generally reviews from customers. You could also try asking in the weekly General/Small Questions thread at the top of the page if anyone has a favourite brand they recommend."
ABraThatFits,3dgcnj,MeltingEvergreen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:32:11 2015 UTC,"Mya is a molded plunge. If you like it, try more Josie/Natori plunges. Quite a few of them are shallow-friendly.  Fine Form Full Fit is a full cup (I think), but I actually tried it on recently and can comment that it's pretty friendly to shallow and tall roots, which is not common for a full cup.  Quite a few b.Tempt'd by Wacoal bras suit shallow shapes and there might be some you like.  You might also get on well with 34D Gilligan and O'Malley bras from Target. They have an unlined lace one in a bunch of colors that should suit shallow and tall-roots. Most of their bras suit shallow in general, so just go try some on if you've got Target.  If you're measuring 2-3 cupsizes larger than you end up fitting, you may be conical. /u/basylica also had good insight about your ribcage in a previous post."
ABraThatFits,3dgcnj,M_tridactyla,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:05:07 2015 UTC,"Ooooh excuse for Target! :) I think I will definitely need some more try on sessions.   Honestly I'm still trying to figure out the ribcage comment, that it's broader directly under my breast tissue so it kicks out the measurement from my under bust but I don't have the volume to fill the cups based on that difference?"
ABraThatFits,3dgcnj,M_tridactyla,2,Thu Jul 16 03:18:07 2015 UTC,"Yep, a tapered ribcage will be wider at the top (under your breast tissue) than lower down (your underbust), so it can add non-breast inches to your overbust measurement."

ABraThatFits,3ddmk4,lph123,3,Wed Jul 15 13:17:20 2015 UTC,"Hi!  I think 32F is a good starting point with a snug UB of 32.  You may want 30's in some Freyas as they tend to run loose and stretchy in the band, but otherwise I think 30's will probably be too tight.  Enchanted is a different breed than most Freya unlined plunges.  A lot of their unlined plunges are sheer, but the vast majority of them are narrower than Enchanted.  Maybe look around for Dooodle (if you can stand the print)?  It should be narrower.  Also, Patsy and its sister cuts, Bombshell, Eden, Flourish, and Rapture might work.  Minnie is known for catering to very full on top boobs.  I'm not surprised you had extra material.  Maybe try Marcie?"
ABraThatFits,3ddmk4,lcl0706,2,Wed Jul 15 14:28:01 2015 UTC,"It's ideal to try each bra in two sizes if you can, fix on a band length by what's known about stretchiness (read up or post on here, use bratabase.com measurements) such as Freya coming up a band size large for most people.  So in Freya you'd try 30F/FF and in tighter bands like most Panache/Cleo 32E/F.  Lucy likely has wider wires than the Freya, do place them directly on each other to be sure, but Freya plunge balconies are on the narrow side and Lucy is average (I checked on bratabase to see if the Enchanted was measured, in a 32F it's not, and there are no related models listed either which should measure the same).  Usually I'd be recommending Freya plunge balconies as most, though not all, are FOB, and all are pretty narrow and projected.  Cleo Lily may be worth a try, it's narrower than Minnie and has less space on top, so may work.  There are related cuts of Minnie/Marcie that have tighter top halves too, I think Meg was one and you can still find the odd one.  If you are narrow and only moderately projected it is likely that you have a tall root which may affect things.  You may find that sizing down in cups to stop the gaping on top leads to the top edge cutting in even when there is a tiny bit of space at the nipple, if that happens then narrow half cups may be a good option.  Fantasie makes an unlined half cup as does Freya and they go to an F cup I believe.  Most padded half cups, though not all, tend to be wide and shallow.  Polish brands tend to be the go-to if none of these are narrow enough.  Comexim has pretty much the narrowest wires, Ewa Michalak are nearly as narrow (though again styles vary)."
ABraThatFits,3dekwe,alienbanter,2,Wed Jul 15 17:40:59 2015 UTC,"32F, 32FF, and 32G are all likely candidates, but I think that 32FF is the most likely. It is good that you know you are projected. Have a look at the shape guide to see if you are narrow or broad rooted, FOT or FOB (or neither), and short or tall rooted."

ABraThatFits,3dfs87,joanna70,2,Thu Jul 16 17:51:10 2015 UTC,"Freya half cups are all over the internet, both Lauren and Patsy based styles, so if you know they fit I'd stick with those.  Discontinued Fauve half cups can fit similarly and can be found on ebay etc.  I think you need to chek bratabase.com for wire widths on Rio and Gem, most others are FOB, as I think you'll need to go way up in the cup, and as a basic level seamstress I think the alteration you're looking at is much more complicated, or with a not so attractive result, as the one linked to below.  The low gore means you'll not be able to make a true half cup and may end up with no coverage if you try and lower the outer top edge.  You're going to be trying to reduce volume at the nipple as your priority, which may well be possible but is not the same as making it into a half cup.  I think you'd need to undo all seams, bring the vertical seam in narrower at the top, and slim down the upper sheer section at its lower edge too.  I don't think this is why you're thinking about doin git but if you fancy a balconette rather than half cup style Tutti Rouge Liliana is a shallow shaped plunge/balconette.  Oh and if you'd like more of a sheer cup you can delicately cut out the padding on some of these bras though I'd recommend a bargain one from ebay to try it on (and you may want to size down in the cup if wire width allows you to do so)."

That's pretty much in line with what Bratabase gives you. I'd say to get both sizes in what ever style(s) you try, so as to compare the fit until you have a better idea of what works. Have you read the Shape Guide? What would you say about your shape and root width? If you have concerns about too-tight bands, you could certainly try 36E/F as well."

I think I'm more full on bottom but even using the pics and other resources I really haven't been able to say for certain ""yep, that's totally me""  I'll probably try to get a couple of bras that are super narrow or super shallow and just figure it out by process of elimination."

ABraThatFits,3dfaui,peasyeady,3,Wed Jul 15 20:38:06 2015 UTC,"If you've got the 36G in Cleo Lucy, try it on! I don't think it would be a bad idea to do so, just for your own reference.   I think the reason you're getting so much gaping in the Tango is because of your short roots. The cups on the Tango are quite tall, compared to Lucy which is a much better fit so far. The bra is expecting you to have breast tissue almost up to your collar bones, and that's not where you've got it!   You've got the same issue with Lucy, though it's more mild. It's just a little too tall for your roots. I'm worried about the tightness and side fat, though. Were you able to swoop and scoop everything into the cups? Or do you think you still have breast tissue trapped in the band on the sides? This is called the orange in a glass phenomenon, and may be contributing to your gaping as well.  Trying on the 36G will help you figure out whether this is the case. The cups will be taller, but the wires will also be wider, so you can see if any more of that side chub is breast tissue.   ""Back fat"" is actually pretty normal - it's like wearing any other elastic garment. If it feels really tight and uncomfortable, that's not ideal, but if it feels comfortably supportive and still creates some indentations, then I wouldn't worry about it too much."

Too bad it's a bad fit since it fit better on the sides and I really loved the straps and construction.   I did swoop and scoop a ton and push and prodded trying to get that sidefat to move and it wouldn't. As I responded to /u/noys, I tried on all 4 bras including the Lucy 36G and got the same results.

It has good projection right at the band, and the lace is cut in enough that I don't get too much gapping at the top. My only issue with it is that my breasts are wide-set, so the gore is a bit narrow, but that might not be as much of an issue for you.  If you give this bra a shot, keep in mind that the bands tend to run tight."

My breast tissue as far as I can tell is all in the bras and this is just some extra...blech. I just put on a regular sports bra/sleeping bra and it's the same and there's no underwire pushing breast tissue out of that. I think it's just some stretched skin and fat. Although it looked better in the Tango since I think the side are higher and I could sort of tuck it behind the strap and sides of the bra.

ABraThatFits,3dcpx4,catscatsnekocatscats,3,Wed Jul 15 06:21:00 2015 UTC,"With your measurements there's a good chance you're shallow, but equally you may be slightly projected with firm tissue.  The more shallow you are the less that the FOT descriptor is relevant, and you may find that in fact it is a tall root rather than FOT.  You will want a 30 band at least in tight bands like Panache/Cleo, you might want a 28 with an extender in stretchy bands like Freya but less likely.  Don't get hooked up on one size, bras vary in shape, band stretchiness etc, and most of us have 2-3 sizes in our collections.  I would aim at trying 30C/D, if you're shallow possibly 30DD even, and if the band is very stretchy then possibly 28D/DD/E.  Cleo Marcie is a classic ""diagnostic"" FOT bra with narrowish wires, I would also try some classic shallow bras like Cleo Juna/Maddie or Freya half cups as they also work for many FOT boobs that aren't too projected.  Juna and the Freya half cups have stretchy bands."
ABraThatFits,3dcpx4,joanna70,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:43:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much!  I took a swing by Nordstrom's rack today and walked out with a Natori Feathers, 30D.  Overall, it feels really comfy except that the gore pokes eversoslightly into my sternum.  Does liking this bra say anything about my breast shape?  I'm not sure I've got it figured out.  And, what's the next step I should take to find more bras I like?"
ABraThatFits,3dcpx4,joanna70,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:32:27 2015 UTC,"Comfy is always good and has to be a priority but see if you can assess whether the wires are wide enough or too wide, that you're swooping and scooping etc.  I'm sure it will work for you but it isn't uncommon to buy instore and find out that it's less comfy than you thought.  It's why we get into detail of whether bras really FIT, but equally if it's comfy and stays comfy who cares!  Feathers is a very wide and very shallow bra, there is a ton of other suggestions in the Shallow Guide in the Shape Guide, many will be discontinued but bratabase also has a tab at the top of each model's listing with ""related models"" which will bring up bras based on the same cut, though they can vary fractionally.  Personally I like Freya half cups and Fauve half cups (discontinued as a brand) even more, but they're not quite as wide as Feathers."
ABraThatFits,3dcpx4,birdmommy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:44:08 2015 UTC,"Awesome!!  I'll go delve into all the info for shallow breasts.  Looks like there's a lot.  When I took the bra off last night, I found that the outside edge of the wires left a little red mark about 1/2 - 3/4 inch too wide (outside the root of my breast tissue).  It fit well along the inside and bottom curves though, just the angle of the outside curve swung a bit wide.  Other than that, the band and the straps feel good, the underwire sits comfortably in my inframammary fold, and the tops of cups lay nicely along my breast tissue.  I'm not sure I like how it looks under clothing (seems a bit round n' pointy), but I think that might just be part of the adjustment of non-underwire bras to underwire bras."

As long as you don't rely on them for fitting help they're pretty good, especially if you want to experiment with different styles at a lower price point.

ABraThatFits,3dcpx4,birdmommy,4,Wed Jul 15 12:34:57 2015 UTC,I'm not too sure they have a lot of 30 bands?  I know PINK has a few in smaller cup sizes but not sure about more than that?
ABraThatFits,3dco7l,yabluko,3,Wed Jul 15 06:01:35 2015 UTC,"Using this Cleo Lily as a guide, I actually don't think you're quite that far off. Is it a 38F or 38FF? I think you'd only need to go up one or two cup sizes from this.  Using your lying measurement (which tends to be most accurate in your size range) gives me 38G, so I think you're probably closer to 38G/GG than 38H/HH.   The wire width seems like it's the biggest issue, so you need a bra that's wider in the wires while giving you this much projection in front and not going up to your collarbones in height. I think the cup height of this bra works really well for you, actually.  See if anyone on /r/randomactsofbras has Cleo Lucy in 38G/GG. Elomi would probably end up being a good choice for you, too, but nailing down size will help. You don't have to try on a bunch of bras at one time, though we do recommend it if you can afford it. If you can only afford to buy and return one bra at a time, that's totally fine too!   If you're in the US, Amazon Prime Day starts in 40 minutes. There may be some awesome bra deals coming up in the next 24 hours! It's okay if you don't have Prime, you can start a free trial and then cancel it if it doesn't fit in your budget.

Me waiting for the prime day is what made me realize it's time to really check what my bra size is since I plan to get something on sale. I actually just checked and the tag says that it is a eu/usa 38FF. I will look in to a 38G/GG since I suppose going up a size can't hurt right?

I just say 32D because people can process it (which is probably spreading misconceptions about what a 32D looks like, so I feel sort of bad about it.)

I'd be uncomfortable ranting and raving about proper fitting. It's the same reason why, when I'm with friends and having girl talk about periods (I'm assuming we're not the only girls that do that!), I don't bring up how the Diva Cup has changed my life and how tampons and pads are unnecessary evils. It seems inappropriate."

Idk if it's appropriate to talk about in too much depth on this subreddit, but essentially the Diva Cup (along with the Moon Cup and the Lunette) is a reusable silicone cup that you insert into lÃ© vagina during your period.   It's fantastic for multiple reasons because 1) you only have to empty it once every 12 hours because there's no risk of TSS and it holds a loooot of the gross stuff 2) it's extremely cost effective because one $30-$40 investment can last many years (the silicone is extremely durable) 3) IMO it's waaay more comfortable than tampons or pads, to the point where sometimes I forget I'm even on my period, 4) it's better for the environment than tampons and pads, which go on to populate landfills, and 5) it doesn't have the dyes that tampons/pads have, if you're worried about those chemicals being in your body (I'm personally not but hey!).

I feel like my musculature adds the appearance of a lot of ""frame"" size, if that makes sense -- and so I understand why anyone either not well versed in bra fitting or who just isn't looking too carefully might assume a larger band size and smaller cup size. Because of this, I almost always (the last times I have tried purchasing in-store, which have admittedly become more rare) ""double down"" -- I slide up a band size and down a cup volume (i.e., from UK 34H to 36G).   I'm not embarrassed either of my actual size or the size I think people might read me to be -- but I am embarrassed by the possibility that fitters will think I'm ""vanity sizing"" -- going down a band and up a cup when I really shouldn't be."

When she saw the size she pointed at the tag and asked if I needed help finding something else (all in Spanish of course).  I tried to tell her it was okay, but in the end I think she just felt bad that she couldn't get the silly American to understand she was in the wrong size."

So she's wearing 34A's and little girl bralettes that she squeezes into. I actually got her to measure herself, and she's  32D. I even ordered some for her, and she was spilling out of some! And yet she still doesn't believe me when it comes to bra shapes. She believes that demi/balconette cups will only cover half her breasts, because the photos online when shopping for them show women who obviously don't fit in them and more full on top than her.

ABraThatFits,3dc4he,yellkaa,4,Wed Jul 15 21:20:25 2015 UTC,"A while back, when I was first learning about proper bra fitting, I had recently measured myself and was all excited. My mom and a good friend were over and we got started talking about girly things like that, and I mentioned that I recently discovered I might be a 32F. They laughed out loud at that. Literally. And then cracked jokes about a teeny woman with huge boobs 'out to here' (with arm gestures 2 feet out in front of them). It really made me upset. But I'm the type that wants to now prove them wrong, and bravangelize them.   I don't mind telling a sales associate my size, but I've only done it once. I'm actually more self conscious of the fact that I'm VERY full on bottom, and even most bras in my size have a lot of gapping. I felt the need to show the associate my properly fitting bra to prove I actually am that size, I just need a special shape."
ABraThatFits,3dc4he,meezerface,3,Wed Jul 15 07:36:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not self concious about the size, but I am about how uneven my breasts are (one is at least a full cup size smaller than the other).

I still haven't posted here for a fit check (I am now losing some weight anyway, so don't want to make an investment in an expensive bra yet).  The one time I worked up the nerve, automod kicked me back b/c all I've ever worn is an XL sportsbra, so no starting size it recognized, and I chickened out. Maybe when I finish dropping a bit, I'll try it again. :/"
ABraThatFits,3dc4he,SexyGeniusGirl,2,Wed Jul 15 13:56:40 2015 UTC,"Nope. But I do have some body image issues (I see myself as heavy. I was a chunky teen graduating at 185lbs and hit 210 twice when pregnant with my sons - gaining about 70lbs per and taking awhile to lose it) and I by default buy large shirts which generally fit but I'm noticing more this time losing some weight with work that large fitted shirts look hella baggy on me and not fitted AT ALL. I tend to blame clothing because I can't understand how I'm actually smaller than that. I used to get ""you can't really be a 34 or 32 band! That's tiny! How about a 36 or 38?"" When I actually tried to find bras that fit 14+ years ago.  Not many shops carry sub 30 bands anyway, but I'm sure it would bother me if I was questioned about a 28 band fitting me or how it was clearly ""tiny"" and I'm not.  I find it amusing when Id tell people I was a DD back when I was cramming myself into 34DD and they would be shocked because ""you don't look that big"" It's even more fun to say I'm a HH (when I was wearing 30HH) or H!"
ABraThatFits,3dc4he,deathrottweiler,2,Wed Jul 15 14:50:21 2015 UTC,"No, I'm not, but it's because even when I was ill-fitted, my visits to bra stores were like 'Do you have 70F? - Good bye!' But I never, never, never ever buy something or return to the store where a selling woman tells me 'What a noncense, F cup is huge, you're not that big!'. And another one thing to totally make me avoid the store and tell all my friends to do the same is when I ask them for a certain bra size and they are trying to trick me into buying a totally wrong bra size by giving me them instead of what I ask and offering 'help' to avoid me from looking at the tag. It's ridiculous when they offer me 36 and 38 bands - do they really suppose I won't see the fit is totally wrong being 30 inches underbust? And now, when I got my new size, my bra stores visits are even funnier. ""65K, please! - There are no such cups! There are no such bands! Are you kidding? Are you sure this is a size? You are 80D, stop saying that nonsense!""

A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J vs A-B-C-D-DD-E-F-FF-G-GG, both of them work out to an index size of 30:10 (10 cup volumes).  I agree it looks the best on you.

ABraThatFits,3dbj7a,lcl0706,2,Wed Jul 15 00:08:38 2015 UTC,"Maybe a regular 60HH would hit the jackpot? I've been told that the half cups are definitely shallower than the plunges, and the Coco you've got looks the tiniest bit small. The thing that you seem to be struggling with the most is cup height, and the 60Js you've got don't seem to be cutting it."
ABraThatFits,3dbj7a,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Wed Jul 15 00:17:01 2015 UTC,"I think Poison Ivy is designed to be a shorter cup to start with and is cut differently than the classic plunges like Irish Coffee (maybe more open on top). I have a 60HH Vivien with reduced cups and gore that's a perfect fit on me and you're seen my fit checks, I'm a small 28F. I feel like the reductions make the size fit more like one smaller, but with added depth. I think maybe a reduced 60J might be the best bet, because you're also quite projected and will probably need the extra depth."
ABraThatFits,3dbj7a,petitecollegiate,2,Wed Jul 15 00:24:59 2015 UTC,"I think the Coco is the best fit of the lot, actually. The Irish Coffee looks really good until you pinch up the excess cup space. I guess that cup is padded enough to keep its shape even when not fully filled out. The Mint Sorbet is not bad; again it looks like it's closer than it is until you pinch the excess.  I feel bad saying it because it's gone, but I didn't think that 3rd-hand Poison Ivy was a bad fit on you. It seemed to fit like a half-cup even though it's not meant to be, and it looked fairly close (though I see now that it didn't tack), but I fear that's not very helpful because you don't know for sure what the specs on that bra were. If you're not giving up on it, though, I'd probably go for the regular 60HH."

It is likely just barely too small.   Yeah, the 60HH Poison Ivy was a full inch away from tacking. I could stick my index finger in the space. The pics don't look as bad as I remember it feeling - it felt like I was gonna fall right out. I started wondering if a regular 60HH would be the way to go... unless the first 60HH I tried is actually a standard 60HH. Then it would be small. UGH!! I agree the IC is still too tall but with the shape of that particular bra's cup, I don't think I could have gone down a size in it. I fill it out everywhere except the very tippy top. And the Mint Sorbet is just really plunge-y on me, I donno. It's a different bird altogether."
ABraThatFits,3dbj7a,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:06:12 2015 UTC,"I certainly don't have the knowledge or personal experience of Comexim to advise you. I wonder how much difference moving the straps made with the IC, as well as having reduced height. The Coco is just so close! It's what, 2 cm between cups sizes? And it sounds like you need maybe ~1cm bigger in the cup in that one, if I were to guess. But I'm just rambling here.  May as well ask Anna her opinion. It doesn't seem like it could hurt. Perhaps she would be willing to advise you about the different cuts and how they compare in the unaltered versions."
ABraThatFits,3dbj7a,petitecollegiate,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:22:51 2015 UTC,"I hope she can advise.  I'm so bummed they are gone for another week or so.  But, everyone needs a vacation, and she certainly works hard!  I feel like if I were to get a reduced cup 60J it would need reduced 3-4cm or so, instead of their typical 2cm... it's like I'm between sizes lol.  Which is the story of my life!!  The Mint Sorbet is still too tall but only by ~1cm or so, and yes I could use another ~1cm of room in that Coco.  What u/petitecollegiate said about the extra depth in a reduced cup vs a standard size smaller makes sense, and the apex of my boobs does touch the inside of that 60J Poison Ivy, if that makes sense - like there's no extra space in the cup at the fullest part of my boob.  But it's like a skyscraper otherwise."
ABraThatFits,3dbj7a,petitecollegiate,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:34:34 2015 UTC,"You can ask for a custom amount reduced from the cups and added/subtracted from the gore :) Definitely ask Anna though as she knows her cuts best, but be advised that she may give you a tighter/more cleavagey fit than you would prefer if you like to be more locked down. Mint Sorbet is an older cut, which would explain why it's a little different. The apexes of Comexim cups tend to be pretty high (to give that uplifted rounded shape) so thats why so many of us need reductions in height. If your apex touches the inside of the 60J Poison Ivy, you probably need the depth of that size."
ABraThatFits,3dbj7a,petitecollegiate,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:44:35 2015 UTC,"oooh good to know about her idea of a good fit vs mine.  I'm not a cleavagey girl.  I'm a ""keep em separated and held in place"" girl.  The amount of ""cleavage"" I get from that Irish Coffee is the most I'd ever want lol.  I'll have to specify that when I talk to her.  I hope I can translate all of this properly - there is nobody there that speaks English, correct?   Previous emails I've written it in English and in Polish after that, and explained that I am American and using a translator.  The wiki translations page helps with the basic questions, but I'm always afraid Google translate will eff it up good and she won't have a clue what I'm talking about!!"
ABraThatFits,3dbj7a,wambrita,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:48:43 2015 UTC,"There's no one there who speaks english, but she does speak fluent spanish. I email her in Spanish because I'm much more confident about my translations in that (I speak it fairly well). I haven't heard of anyone having big issues though other than the differing opinions of a good fit. At this point she's probably used to all of us crazy Americans flooding her inbox with bad Polish. As long as you keep the sentences simple it should be fine."

I swear I read somewhere she uses Google translate to respond in English!  I should attempt to learn Spanish, I've thought about it a few times.

ABraThatFits,3dau0n,rynia_,6,Tue Jul 14 21:01:33 2015 UTC,"If you're planning to do a fit check on the Lily, it's probably best to wait for how that bra fits you before making further recommendations. Your 40D bra is probably very stretched out, but another reason for boobs escaping under the wires is a too-small cup. The 38GG you ordered is 5 cup volumes larger than a 40D (taking into account that the volume of 40D would be equivalent to 38DD)."

ABraThatFits,3dbquk,ablesch,3,Wed Jul 15 01:07:43 2015 UTC,"Well 32DD is not a sister size of 30F, so that could be problem number one. 32E would be your sister size. Have you tried anything in that size or in a 30F? The cups do look a bit tight in the picture. That could contribute to bruising. Bruising from the wires would generally mean that the cups are too wide/ the wires too long for you. In the pictures it looks like the wires extend out of their casing a little bit and poke out. You could maybe push them in further and sew the channel shut further down to stop that. An alternate explanation would be if the cups are too narrow and the wire is sitting on breast tissue it might also bruise. Without more pictures or a better description I can't definitively tell you which it would be."
ABraThatFits,3dbquk,petitecollegiate,2,Wed Jul 15 01:22:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you, and i have tried a 30F before and it fit better but i got form a speciality shop so it was like 80$ which is why i buy the bras from lasenza but their sizes dont go up that high"
ABraThatFits,3dbquk,petitecollegiate,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:27:56 2015 UTC,"There are 100% cheap options out there for a 30F! Amazon has oodles with free shipping and returns. You can easily find styles there for under $30. Nordstrom (or Nordstrom rack) is a great place to try in stores. Or you can always try on at a specialty boutique then order online for expense. Brastop.com is a great resource if you know what you're looking for. Kohl's has just started carrying non-matrix sizes online. Don't settle for just okay! Trust me, the right size is sooo worth it."

ABraThatFits,3dbquk,petitecollegiate,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:52:10 2015 UTC,"Really? I always see them when I go hunting for rogue 28Fs.

My parfait bra is a 30F but it only stretches to 27.5, and when i stretch it that much it distorts the cups. (Probably why I've always thought I preferred 32 bands)"

It's so funny how ranges are so different within the same stores in the same country. I used to only ever find 34 bands, but its definitely shifted a TON in the past few years. 30 and 32 bands in full bust sizes are readily available around here. Hopefully it spreads to wherever you are! :) Atleast there's always Amazon and the internet. I would be completely doomed without them."

ABraThatFits,3dbquk,joanna70,2,Wed Jul 15 03:41:34 2015 UTC,"My instinct is that the wires are too narrow (see it digging into your flesh?  That is probably actual breast tissue) as well as the cups being too small.  I went from 32DD which caused me great pain, to a much better 30F.  Try some wider bras suuch as Freya padded half cups, not enough info to say whether they might fit but they come in your size and do have wider wires.  The best thing you can do is post a full measurement check as per the instructions in the side bar, as well as information on your shape from the Shape Guide in the side bar.  Do you fully swoop and scoop all your tissue into the cups?  I suspect when you do you'll see the bras are too small for you."
ABraThatFits,3dbquk,rainydayseveryday,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:36:26 2015 UTC,"That bra might be too narrow for you, or like petitecollegiate said the wire could just be too long, if you push them further into the channel they might poke you on your sternum, unless the middle gore doesn't touch your chest, which is somewhat likely because you're in a cup size that's one volume too small. I don't know anything about la senza bras, so I can't really say how the measurements compare to your shape.  You're pretty close though. You were only off by one cup size/band size. a 32E/DDD is the sister size of 30F.   It might be more helpful if you post your measurements, because the calculator gives me 30F but I wear a 32E (except in stretchy bands like freya bras) most of the time to avoid pain, but I think my ribcage just expands a lot when I move around or something"
ABraThatFits,3dbquk,xuenylom,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:49:00 2015 UTC,"I think the others have covered most things but I'll add my 2 cents.   I feel your pain! I wish ann summers made more 30 bands as I love everything they do! UK ex-ann summers employee here, and I would recommend trying out Boux Avenue, Freya, Debenhams ""gorgeous"" range, wouldn't bother with M&S as they have roughly 5 low quality bras in that size, Panache (and their sub-brand Cleo by Panache), Pour Moi, Curvy Kate.  When I does went from wearing Ann Summers ""sexy lace"" 32Bs to 32Ds I found my bra problems did not go away, and that's when I came to this sub, and found out I was 30DD/28E at the time! With a bit of swooping and scooping practice, and a bit of weight gain, I'm a solid 30FF.   When I first was a 30DD I did actually go to M&S but back then there were more options, but I also went on eBay and brastop, two really cheap places to try on bras, the first so cheap that you needn't worry about returning as you can resell, and brastop has a great returns policy. So check out the shape guide and get trying on :)"
ABraThatFits,3dc16r,Boobthrowawayz,2,Wed Jul 15 02:29:44 2015 UTC,Maybe the 34D is the best size for you but it is in the wrong shape. It's possible that your shape has changed.
ABraThatFits,3dc16r,Saskia_C,2,Wed Jul 15 02:54:23 2015 UTC,"I think either 34D or 34DD will end up being a good size for you, but you're getting a shape mismatch in those bras.  Out of all those, the black 34D seemed best.  You look like you have a similar shape to me (shallow with tall roots but not too much upper fullness), so I'll tell you what's worked for me.    As far as brands go, Natori, Betsey Johnson, DKNY, and Victoria Secret have been best.  Specific bras that have worked are Natori Feathers, Betsey Johnson Forever Perfect Demi Bra, Betsey Johnson Retro Glamour Demi Bra.  Since you're in a 34 band, you should have a lot of options in any department store.  I've heard Target's Gilligan & OâMalley bras are good for shallow shapes but I haven't tried them myself."
ABraThatFits,3dc16r,syrashiraz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:39:07 2015 UTC,I had a Gilligan&O'Malley in size 34C through most of high school and it was super comfortable. Regardless of whether or not I was wearing the right size bc I'm pretty sure I haven't grown since like middle school but yeah they have a t-shirt bra that gives a really great shape and a surprising amount of support for a thin t-shirt bra that I got for like $10.... If it wasn't 3 years old I'd still be wearing it
ABraThatFits,3dc16r,Crikey-Way,2,Wed Jul 15 07:41:50 2015 UTC,"Most people need to try on several bras (apparently often 25, I tried more) to get a good fit, you definitely have a shape issue with these bras.  Bear in mind that moulded bras come in a limited rang eof shapes AND mask fitting issues so it's hard to know why they don't fit.  Seamed bras are always more helpful when fitting a new size."
ABraThatFits,3da1mw,boredweirdgirl,4,Tue Jul 14 17:49:41 2015 UTC,"Is it just the top part of the gore (the wire parts that go between the breasts)? If so, you can bend that out a bit so the top part of the wire doesn't push so hard against your rib cage. As for the armpit bit, I'm not certain what to do there; you may need to find a bra with a lower wing."
ABraThatFits,3da1mw,soleoblues,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:37:03 2015 UTC,"OK so I read all the comments and verified the bra in question , it's not the gore but the ends of the underwire that are very pointy and poke against my bones and the arm pit"
ABraThatFits,3da1mw,joanna70,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:50:29 2015 UTC,"The ends of the underwire do form the gore in the middle, wires poking at the armpit can be for many reasons so you have to break down the fit of the bra - are the wires too narrow (sitting on actual breast tissue), too wide, too tall (poking up too high) or too short (flesh wrapping over them, armpit chub)?"
ABraThatFits,3da1mw,nippy_noodles,3,Wed Jul 15 06:39:03 2015 UTC,"Which style did you get? If the wire is digging into your arm pit you might have narrow breasts and the cups are too wide set.

ABraThatFits,3da1mw,Julez22,4,Tue Jul 14 22:54:54 2015 UTC,Aw thanks! I'm glad I could help!  I see you made a comment about having to tuck your nipple in. It sounds like the cup is too small which could be a cause for the wire poking you; it might be sitting on your breast tissue rather than laying outside of it.  Do you mind double checking your measurements to see if you still get 28C?
ABraThatFits,3da1mw,Julez22,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:45:45 2015 UTC,If it isn't just the top part of the gore you could bend out the wire in the armpits too. Just press against a hard surface. You could also push the underwire down so that more of it comes into the gore of the bra. Kind of hard to explain...I saw a picture once on here somewhere. It could also take a couple days to get used to it. Did you try any other little bra company bras and have the same problem? Have you loosened the straps?

ABraThatFits,3d9keg,j_overland_f,8,Tue Jul 14 16:31:19 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I came here to say, darn it! You're perfectly right, /u/j_overland_f,but I would add one thing. That's Underworks' FTM site, so I'm wondering if there's a difference between that swim binder (meant for trangender guys) and this swim binder on their main site.  Sometimes the binders on underworks.com and f2mbinders.com are shaped differently, because the main site actually caters to men with gynecomastia, while f2mbinders caters to trans men like me, with a different body shape. I have no idea if that applies to the swim binder, but they're the same price, so if I were in /u/mybraguy's situation I'd go with the one on underworks.com in case it's different."

I'd assume the swim binder is the same as the others: normal slightly-stretchy nylon/spandex blend except in the front, where it binds, where it's made out of a more heavy-duty compressing fabric. I've never heard of anyone without a prior medical condition getting hurt from using an Underworks binder right."

ABraThatFits,3d9keg,MeltingEvergreen,6,Sat Jul 18 20:37:23 2015 UTC,Years ago I had a TYR brand bikini which was a sports bra shaped top but swimsuit material intended for racing i think. It flattened me like a board but the bottoms had great coverage for my pear shape (before I knew you could buy separates) and I was at an age where my peers didn't have breasts yet so I didn't want to be made fun of or be accused of showing off. It was no harder to get off than a sweaty sports bra. So the racing swimsuit brands might be a good option and surf shirts are really popular these days for sun protection.
ABraThatFits,3d9keg,redshoefeet,3,Tue Jul 14 16:01:04 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on what size you are and whether you need serious support. I have a fitted black racerback sports shirt made of whatever that fabric is that's not exactly lycra but you use for running shirts? I keep it in my car along with a pair of black boyshirt bikini bottoms or a pair of lycra bottoms in case I pop in at the gym and haven't packed my bag with the real swimwear. It has zero support but it covers everything and no one has ever looked at me funny so I guess it looks like swimwear. Maybe a tank top is better though for a guy than a racer back.... :) But there's probably some similar kind of lycra (ish) vest with a bit of inbuilt support or you could wear a bikini top underneath with the same back shape.  Otherwise, there's the whole surfwear thing - all in ones or separates. You can pretty much wear what you want under a rash shirt, it might be a bit irritating if you're swimming for a long time though. There's lots of different square leg one pieces that are used for triathlon and that kind of thing as well, no idea what the support is like on those because I am way too lazy for things like triathlon."
ABraThatFits,3d9keg,tealeaf_egg,4,Tue Jul 14 16:17:11 2015 UTC,"Some mainstream places (Forever 21, VS) sell sports bras with front zip closures, if their sizes are an option for you.

ABraThatFits,3d9keg,tealeaf_egg,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:06:30 2015 UTC,"Hmm, this is an idea. I could wear that under a ""swim shirt"" or a lycra based running shirt. I have a VS sports bra, The Ultimate which has back closures. What's your opinion on the Panache? I wonder about the band, because sometimes with Sports Bras, I have go with a 40 band instead of my usual 38. The VS Ultimate is still a 38, and it fits fine."
ABraThatFits,3d9jhf,Skybosia,5,Tue Jul 14 15:43:46 2015 UTC,"I have no idea about the sizing, but the ""two for 92,25"" offer is in Euros, not zloty. One of those bras is 55 Euros, so you'd be getting each one for 10 Euros less. It's definitely not as affordable as Comexim or even Ewa Michalak. Avocado is more of a luxury brand."
ABraThatFits,3d9jhf,crazymusicalgenius96,4,Tue Jul 14 20:52:22 2015 UTC,"Have you tried any other brands apart from Wacoal? Jumping straight to Avocado from an ill-fitting Wacoal might not be the best idea. It sounds like you might not have narrowed down your correct bra size in UK sizing yet, let alone the Polish size.    While I love Avocado bras (it's the only brand I wear at the moment), they are quite expensive and you probably won't get the right size/cut combination straight away (it certainly took me a few tries). It might be a good idea to troubleshoot your bra issues first to find something that is cheaper and easier to get/return. Once you've got the right size down for your measurements, it will be easier to convert to Avocado sizing and invest in one that you are sure will suit you, as there is a lot more to the RV/NF bras than just immediate projection/lift (and they still do sell some A/K/H cuts as well).      This blog post is a great comparison post about the A/K/H cuts."
ABraThatFits,3d9jhf,senkidala,3,Wed Jul 15 00:08:07 2015 UTC,"RV should be based more on A/K and NF based on H.  I would suggest NF, I tried a H that happened to have top edge detailing that made it too closed on top for me but room at the bottom and by the center gore was plentiful.   Their size guide needs a bit of an explanation.   For band size it uses BTT-5cm which is pretty much snug-10cm (so your regular EU band size converted from the UK/US one) as most people tend to have 2""/5cm difference between BTT and snug. The bands run a little bit tight, about 0.5-1"" smaller than band size.  The cup size is a bit trickier though, it tells you to measure the standing bust in a well fitting bra, but my bust measurement fluctuates from 101cm to 106cm depending on the specific bra. I ended up using the inch measurement my UK cup size corresponded to.  I ended up in 70H which seems to be correct volume-wise. If they have made it even more closed on top than H was I'd size up in cup.  EDIT: NF review https://2cakesonaplate.wordpress.com/2015/06/22/avocado-bra-review-calypso-in-h-cut/  EDIT v2: NF doesn't look as rounded on bottom as H but I still think it's the better option.

It is on the tightest fitting and still slides up my back. My bewbs leak over the top, under my arms, under the gore- which does not meet my chest, and under the wires. I think there are even bewbs on my back! My body looks like modern art when I release the hounds in the evening. I suspect the Essentia bra MUST be a great improvement over my Wacoal! :) Major thanks to Crazymusicalgenius for letting me in on the fact that pricing is in EUROS! Not ZLOTYS!

ABraThatFits,3da8yt,idamayer,3,Tue Jul 14 18:39:18 2015 UTC,"You can buy pre made straps or removable straps and sew them on. It's not terribly difficult, removing the old straps will be the hardest part (risk of unpicking stitches you shouldn't). If the hoop is attached to the band and not in the middle of the strap you only have to unpick the stitching at the front and then pull the strap out of the ring in the back, thread the new strap through the ring and stitch it to the front. Buy a random cheap bra to practice on would be my advice."

ABraThatFits,3d9jbw,oooh_snappp,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:32:03 2015 UTC,"Masquerade or Fauve styles seem to have a lot of the cup styles that have the appearance of what has worked for me. Try looking for bras that have more of a half ""o"" (either cut in half horizontally or slashed / through). I haven't had the chance to try Fauve yet, but I'm dying to try the Emmanuelle. The Masquerade Delphi and Medina has the open top I need, along with Darcy-ish <-- minor quadding, but liveable.   It is very beneficial to read the reviews on Bratabase for these bras, especially in your size. The other thing I found helpful was searching for ""projected tall roots"" and the like in the /r/abrathatfits search bar. Let me know what works for you! :)"

ABraThatFits,3dape0,goddesspyxy,2,Tue Jul 14 20:29:53 2015 UTC,Maybe dye a white bra beige? Are any of your current bras white? You could test it out on a cheap or worn out bra first just to see if it would work.   I hope your new Ewa bra works out!
ABraThatFits,3dape0,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:19:52 2015 UTC,Negative on the white bras. I've found a few styles that fit (and tons that don't) but none of them are white.
ABraThatFits,3dape0,noys,2,Tue Jul 14 22:46:25 2015 UTC,You could try dyeing over the Marcie.
ABraThatFits,3d90hn,meezerface,4,Tue Jul 14 13:11:28 2015 UTC,"You're not awful by avoiding unlined mesh/lace, I tend to have the same problems and preferences.  The Elomi Lexi looks fabulous - definitely a keeper!  The Pour Moi's cups look a little too tall for you.  I'd say you have a fairly short root and/or low set boobs and that's why you tend to have gapping in a lot of full cup styles.  Balconettes may tend to work better on you.  If you were to size down, chances are the wires would be too narrow.  The Keira looks too wide on the sides and possibly too shallow.  If it's not comfortable, I wouldn't loose sleep over returning or reselling it.  Because of your short roots, I think Curvy Kate Bardot would probably work quite well on you.  It is unlined sheer material though.  That said, my skin is usually really picky and doesn't seem to have problems with Bardot.  You may also get along well with Elomi Etta."
ABraThatFits,3d90hn,lcl0706,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:35:52 2015 UTC,Ah-hah! Glad to hear the source of the problem - short roots. :) It does make sense now.   Thanks for the recommendation on the Bardot - do you know if it's also quite projected? I'd heard most CK bras are shallow. Will definitely be trying more Elomi bras.
ABraThatFits,3d90hn,lcl0706,2,Wed Jul 15 09:22:23 2015 UTC,"Most older season CK bras are wide and shallow. They revamped their fit for SS2015 and Bardot is one of them. I find it fairly narrow & quite projected, which I need. Madagascar is supposedly it's sister cut."

ABraThatFits,3d90hn,noys,3,Wed Jul 15 16:53:12 2015 UTC,"Lexi looks like perfection on you! Elomi (and Goddess) do have wide wires, so it's not surprising that it's a bit wide but ~1cm is not a problem so long as it's comfortable. This is a really excellent fit you have here!  I agree with lcl0706 that the gapping in the Pour Moi is due to short roots, and to a pretty great extent this is unavoidable. I'm uncertain if you could wear it one cup size down. I would say try it and compare the two sizes if you like the bra and it's not too much hassle. It seems like there's a bit of extra room in the cup other than up top, but you might quad in a 36G and the wires here do look good. Depending on how much the gapping bothers you, and how the bra looks under clothes, this fit seems wearable.  I am mildly sad that you think Goddess Keira is ugly. (cries softly) However, if it's not comfortable, it's no good. Could be that the very tall gores are a no-go for you. Elomi's Amelia bra might be worth a try as it's spacer-foam, so you won't have the unlined issue. Elomi Etta is a good suggestion as well. It has a lower gore which could work nicely for you."
ABraThatFits,3d90hn,yellkaa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:41:39 2015 UTC,"Glad to finally know the reason for the gaping! I was going to check out the smaller size of the Pour Moi but now it seems like they're out of stock on it, which is a bummer. I have now worn it for an hour in the house and it feels comfortable and supportive, I guess it's more a shape mis-match than the cup size itself.   As for the Keira, I actually do like the colour and I think the style just doesn't suit me very well! ;)"
ABraThatFits,3d90hn,EmmaInFrance,3,Wed Jul 15 09:19:17 2015 UTC,"Elomi Jocelyn has the same cut and the same stretch lace as Lexi. The long discontinued Valentina as well but it's harder to find, it might pop up on US or UK eBay. The new Edie looks like it also has stretch lace but it could be non-stretchy like Betty - I think they are still both worth a try. Elomi Kenza might be a slightly different plunge cut because it has larger cup sizes than the other plunges but it looks identical.  Besides Amelia/Hermione Elomi also has the Bijou molded bra."
ABraThatFits,3d7f1x,TypingWithTRexArms,35,Tue Jul 14 02:39:11 2015 UTC,Did you ever see a dermatologist about the acne? There are many reasons this could have happened and only one is that you were allergic or sensitive to the materials the bras were made from.  When was the last time you wore a bra and got acne from wearing it? 10 years ago?
ABraThatFits,3d7f1x,hurrrrrmione,17,Tue Jul 14 02:54:11 2015 UTC,"The last time I went to a dermatologist was probably 4 years ago.  All said and done he happened to be an extraordinarily bad doctor (in general) but I also had an allergic reaction to the medication that he prescribed, causing hives all over my body.  I was frustrated by him and the reaction and have not gone back since.  I should, though. I still break out on my back along the sports bra lines and randomly in other spots such as my shoulders, so I still suffer from those symptoms, even 10 years later.  The reason I assume it's a result of constant contact or the material is because I can't wear jewelry or anything else that sits and rubs the skin for a long period of time either."
ABraThatFits,3d7f1x,hurrrrrmione,20,Tue Jul 14 03:18:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with u/eveningtrain that it could just be a combination of tight fabric/elastic + sweat + rubbing caused by your everyday body movements. Of course, I'm not a doctor and haven't examined your skin, but that's the most likely explanation.  It could be that if you get into bras that fit better that the acne will decrease or even go away entirely. It also might not make a difference.  Personally I would recommend measuring yourself with our methods and trying some bras we recommend. Then if that doesn't make a difference, I would recommend heading to a dermatologist or r/skincareaddiction."
ABraThatFits,3d7f1x,MeltingEvergreen,10,Tue Jul 14 03:30:07 2015 UTC,"I'm still trying to figure out my own bra story, but highly second r/skincareaddiction it's been a year since I tried their beginner recommended products and with trial and error my skin has been the best it has been in years. it's a great place to learn about researching ingredients in your products to narrow down culprits that cause reactions.  Also since elastic seems to be a trigger, is it possible you have a latex allergy? A lot of higher end bras these days cover the elastic so they don't have raw elastic running the edges of the band, those feel like cheese graters on my skin too."
ABraThatFits,3d7f1x,redshoefeet,5,Tue Jul 14 05:43:26 2015 UTC,"The first thing that came into my head was a latex allergy - mostly because there's still some friction even with clothes at certain points of your body. If you don't get similar issues at say inner elbows, neck, waist...then maybe it's the latex or some other synthetic thing in bras particularly. But that's a pure guess, no special skills.  In summer I get a minor version of this (nothing like it but just that mildly irritating sweat rash), I tend to just stick to pure cotton vests/tanks with those underbras when I'm hanging round the house and sometimes even when I nip out for something quick - most of those have some form of elastic but there are some that are literally just stretchy t-shirt cotton. Probably even the cheaper ones if you can get your hands on some of those."
ABraThatFits,3d7f1x,Goddess_Keira,11,Tue Jul 14 12:16:18 2015 UTC,"I also think /u/eveningtrain is on the right track, so to speak, but although I am not a doctor and certainly can't diagnose you over the internet, it sounds like your situation may involve some form of contact dermatitis. I'm sorry to hear that you had such a bad experience with that dermatologist. Hopefully you can find somebody better who will work with you."
ABraThatFits,3d7f1x,emgoog4,3,Tue Jul 14 03:40:50 2015 UTC,"My bras were causing contact dermatitis! I had terrible eczema for years and suffered because I went to a horrible doctor. Literally, ""your skin is bad, use this and come back in 3 months."" So I went to a new doctor and he gave me some cream that actually worked. It cleared up in 2 days and I can wear my bras again! While your experience may not be as good as mine, I encourage you to get some recommendations and read reviews and go try a new doctor."
ABraThatFits,3d7f1x,emgoog4,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:51:18 2015 UTC,"I will have to try a dermatologist again.  I'm too old for acne and don't want to deal with it anymore.  The last guy must have been having a really bad day or something.  I felt like he broke all the rules.  I went for a general introductory appointment to discuss my issues and determine a treatment plan.  I also had a few key topics to discuss:  1. A blackhead on my back that I had for over 5 years (and still have to this day, 10 years later) and 2. I had a huge pimple ""in"" my earlobe due to wearing earings.  Well, the nurse was eager and popped the blackhead and then told me not to tell the doctor about it because she would get in trouble.  Then the doctor came in and didn't really speak to me at all.  He looked at my skin, took a picture, and asked about the earlobe.  He looked at the ear and said he needed to take care of it that day.  So he sits me up on a table and stands behind me investigating it.  All of a sudden, he pokes me with a needle and totally startles me!  He proceeds to cut open and drain the sore then puts on a band-aid.  All without telling me what the heck was going on or what he was going to do to me.  It was not a comfortable situation to say the least.  Then he said he wanted to put me on Bactrim to work on the rest of the acne and I had an allergic reaction.  I knew he was just a bad apple, but I haven't gotten the nerve to go back again."

Getting a good fit should definitely help, though if you have a known allergy and/or skin sensitivity to the materials used in most bra elastics that would make it very difficult. You won't be able to get a bra that gives good support without it being elasticated. There may be some tricks or techniques you could employ to make bra-wearing more comfortable.  You could start by having a look at the Beginner's Guide and posting your five measurements. Then we can get an idea of your bra size range. We will try our best to help you out."

ABraThatFits,3d7f1x,Rysona,11,Tue Jul 14 03:19:34 2015 UTC,"Could be a combination of the tightness of the band and sweating, I tend to get body acne only when I sweat in tight clothing. Do you like to sew, or would you like to learn? Have you tried any bralettes or wireless bras? Not much support for larger or more pendulous breasts in those, but still more than nothing. You could learn to sew bralettes or even full supportive underwire bras using material that you know won't give you acne or irritation, if you continue to have problems with store bought ones."
ABraThatFits,3d7f1x,soleoblues,5,Tue Jul 14 02:59:42 2015 UTC,"I never considered making my own bra, that's very interesting.  I seem to have the most luck with sports bras, which I wear briefly for work outs, and I believe that is due to them primarily being make of cotton and any elastic is covered.  However, I do break out under my breasts with due probably to the sweating.  Are their any everyday bras that are similar to a sports bra, but less restricting?  Perhaps something like that could  be an answer?"
ABraThatFits,3d7f1x,eveningtrain,10,Tue Jul 14 03:12:12 2015 UTC,"There are! Whether or not they'll work for you depends on what size you are (shape is important, but less so for the ones I'm thinking of) and what breast shape you're comfortable with. We got my mom these while she was going through radiation. This doesn't provide the prettiest shape, but she was quite comfortable in them: http://www.soma.com/store/browse/product.jsp?&productId=570109394&color=7386&cmp=csc_goog_pla&003=9121655&010=sku9908138&ci_src=17588969&ci_sku=sku9908138&gclid=CPWe79Xf2cYCFQeBaQodIE4Epw  If wires bother you, you might have luck with the freya deco wireless as well.  I will say -- the underboob sweat is greatly reduced once you get in a bra that fits. I live in sweaty, sweaty Texas and have traveled to oh-my-god-moist Singapore -- well-fitting bras kept my underboob off my skin and prevented that gross sweat.  Also -- while I was researching some options for my mom, I came across this: http://comfortslings.com/products/ -- it might work for you if you are allergic to most fabrics."

Bras made of silk would be breathable yet strong/supportive, and you could cover any elastic with a fabric casing as well! I have seen beautiful bras made of silk, but they are pricey and not necessarily in your size range as well. Other fabrics besides cotton include linen, bamboo, hemp, and you may do well with modal or rayon (technically a natural fiber but it does get highly processed to be created). You may be able to find store-bought bras that are 100% silk, modal/rayon, or cotton at least in their fabric. But I do think it is worth determining if improving fit alone will help, before you assume it is a sensitivity to a man-made fiber like polyester."

Forever New is a great delicate wash that's perfect for things like bras, and while you may not notice a sensitivity to your regular detergent on your regular clothes, your bra is gonna up a lot more close and personal, with all of that extra sweating and rubbing. I know I'm allergic to Tide, not because anything else on my body was affected-- not my arms, not my feet, not my legs, not even my crotch-- but because I developed a horrible rash underneath my breasts.

Tight (as tight as you can possibly pull it) 3. Around the entire chest 4. Around the entire chest leaning forward (90 degree angle) 5.

And I love the warning you get on figleaves if you're browsing in US$ when the bra is UK sized. It was useful when I first started mail ordering.   But all Amazons size charts are inconsistent like that, I don't know if it depends on the brand or the seller which chart you get or what."

ABraThatFits,3d4h1m,MutantToenail,13,Mon Jul 13 13:26:31 2015 UTC,"Also consider that if they got a hundred emails telling them to change it to our system, then they would probably get thousands of emails saying ""This system is wrong! It told me I'm a 30H and I'm obviously a 36D!"""
ABraThatFits,3d4h1m,devohr901,23,Tue Jul 14 01:19:11 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, it would take probably a mass quantity of complaints from several Amazon users to get them to change anything. But, there's never anything wrong with shooting them an email. It might not change anything, but you never know, right?  I would just state that over-the-bust measurements can be inaccurate depending on the individual shape of the woman, and supporting this type of measurement system on your website leads to many women making inaccurate measurements and purchasing bras that do not fit them.  I'm not the best letter writer, but something along those lines I think would be a good start!  EDIT: More explanation."
ABraThatFits,3d4h1m,ChocoNoir,2,Mon Jul 13 15:32:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with the first paragraph. And I think one alternate way of balancing between the right method and the mass method and decreasing the possible complaints is to incorporate the +4 method to some degree. The over bust method was invented probably because it automatically adds a few inches to the under bust measurement, and we can tell them this is wrong because a lot of people prefer a snugger fit, and the information based on over bust measurement can be misleading. Alternatively, we can suggest Amazon to tell women to take the under bust measurement, but at the same time feel free to add inches. Perhaps have a ""snug fit"" size chart, which adds 0-2 inches, and a ""loose fit"" size chart, which adds 4 inches. The uneducated users can probably still stick to +4, unless it feels so uncomfortable that they want to try a different method."
ABraThatFits,3d4h1m,redshoefeet,11,Wed Jul 15 02:01:47 2015 UTC,"But if you're a reasonable size, the likelihood is that there is no ""above the bust"" that's also under the armpit and doesn't contain actual breast. Even without a bra, if I measure above I get +38. With even a bit of support it's +40. If I wear a 40"" band, I literally fall out the bottom when I move. My real ribcage is 34-35"" at most.  Who ever created this fad? Oddly though, I've been measured for bras dozens of times over what, 20 years, and never had anyone attempt to do the over-boob thing. I'd have fallen over laughing."
ABraThatFits,3d4h1m,crazymusicalgenius96,4,Mon Jul 13 21:45:42 2015 UTC,Some people with very short roots or very shallow tall roots don't have much tissue there. But even my shallow tall roots are still enough to make my overbust six inches longer than my snug underbust. That and the angle of the measuring tape - you're supposed to make it hit where your bra band would sit in the back.

ABraThatFits,3d4h1m,LoisVain,3,Tue Jul 14 06:21:19 2015 UTC,"They've gotten a bit better. Last year after I had baby#1, they measured me the old way and got 34B/C (what I've been wearing for almost 10 years). I recently went in to buy some new underwear and to see if I could find any bras close to 30E (so basically 32DD) that might work. I refused their offer to get measured but I noticed they stopped measuring above the bust. The online calculator has changed as well, but when they calculate you to be non-matrix it says ""We're having trouble finding your size. Try again or visit your nearest store.""  It's also possible that your VS actually has employees who kind of know what they're doing and go beyond what their training suggests."

ABraThatFits,3d8pis,injuredpenguin,2,Thu Jul 16 15:53:34 2015 UTC,"Just saw your post in the general questions board. I have somewhat severe scoliosis, with 3 curves in my spine, the largest measuring in at around 46 degrees. The ribs under my left breast stick out, and my left shoulder blade is shallow, while my right humps out.   Before I found this subreddit I was in a 34B/C, and it fit awful. The band cut in, the straps constantly fell off my shoulders, and the bottoms of my boobs spilled out of the cups. I measured myself according to the guide, but put the tape measure over the fullest part of my ""hump"" and over the ribs that stick out, and ended up in a 32DD. I didn't think a 32 would fit because my 34 band felt so tight already (and I didn't think I would be a DD, because a lifetime of being put down for my ""small"" boobs). Turns out the 34 only felt super tight because the cups weren't big enough for my boobs. With the 32DD, the band feels snug enough that I know it's not going anywhere, but it's not painfully tight. And since cup size is relative to band size, a DD did NOT mean OMG SUPER BIG BOOBS in my case. This is a collage of D cups and G cups found in the beginners guide. And this is a good place to go and see how certain cup and band sizes look in real life.   Now, how to measure. My recommendation would be to measure around the fullest part of her protruding shoulder blade (and ribs, if she has them sticking out where a bra band would fall, like mine would). If the fullest part is nowhere near where a band would normally land, I'd say just measure normally and try the size you get from that. If the band size she ends up being is too tight and hurts her back, you can always go up a band size while preserving the cup size. The easiest way to do that is look up sister sizing for the size your sister is. To go up a band size, you must go down a cup size (because, as I mentioned, cup size is relative to band size), so for example, a 32C's sister size, going up in band size, would be a 34B. There are more comprehensive guides on this, and the beginner's guide has a whole section on fit issues and how to fix them.  When you do measure your sister, post your 5 measurements as a Measurement Check post. Having humans look over the measurements can give you a better size than putting them into a calculator.   Remember, there is no harm in trying any of this out. Don't get discouraged if the first bras you try on don't fit quite right. Because of the scoliosis, your sister's body is unique, and there is nothing wrong with that. I just went for it and measured semi-normally, and the bras I have now fit like a dream. Also remember that the people in this community are here to help, and they can help fix any fit issues you might run into along the way.   I tried to address your major points, but this post is getting painfully long... if you have any other questions, message me and I will help to the best of my abilities :) I wish you and your sister the best on your journey to finding a bra that fits!"
ABraThatFits,3d8kxp,culfere,3,Tue Jul 14 10:14:35 2015 UTC,"You should be fine with a 28 band bra in a style where the band runs tight. You can also use Rixie clips with 28 band bras where the band runs loose. In your size range most bras are shallow, so if bras like Cleo Neve or Freya Deco Soft Cup are good for you then shallow cups are for you. I saw a review on bratabase where someone who bought the Cleo Neve in 28D said the band only stretched out to 26"". Thirdlove also makes some good bras if you find that 28D/28DD are too large for you. Their Plunge Perfect bra was specifically designed for FOB types."
ABraThatFits,3d8kxp,Saskia_C,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:37:33 2015 UTC,"Ah thank you!  I'll definitely have a look for Cleo Neve if the band runs small.  I hadn't thought of Rixie clips, thanks for the suggestion, they might really come in handy."
ABraThatFits,3d8kxp,petitecollegiate,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:23:39 2015 UTC,"I might actually go for 28E with your measurements. I think 28D is likely to be much too small. Parfait Charlotte is shallow and good for FoB, on mine the band only stretches to 26in. As for projected, the easiest tell is wires creeping downward out of your IMF . That means that you need more projection in a style. You can also check braswap and bratabase for any 55 bands that come up. You'd probably wear around a 55F for Ewa Michalak and a 55F/G for Comexim."
ABraThatFits,3d81ex,reallysaucy,2,Tue Jul 14 06:04:03 2015 UTC,I think I'd probably get one bra ASAP and then re-evaluate.
ABraThatFits,3d81ex,Goddess_Keira,2,Wed Jul 15 01:03:57 2015 UTC,"I troll braswap alllllllllllll the time for 32Es, 34DDD/32Fs are posted a lot. It helps when you know roughly what width/depth you need for the cups, because then you can worry a lot less about whether they'll fit before they get to you. I've gotten 5 good bras for $30 including shipping now. I would try to find one that fit, try to get to know your shape as much as you can, then buy more if you see they meet your measurement range. For instance, I know I can't deal with cup depth over 9 inches."
ABraThatFits,3d81ex,rainydayseveryday,2,Wed Jul 15 02:09:59 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, I like your idea but it seems that I would have to know my width and depth measurements. With some digging, I found how to measure a bra for those measurements but how do you figure that out for your own breasts? I feel like I know my shape pretty well (short, average roots; projected; even). I also feel that the Freya and CK bras I mentioned fit pretty well- just some minor complaints. Can I just compare those bras with others?"
ABraThatFits,3d81ex,rainydayseveryday,2,Wed Jul 15 03:41:16 2015 UTC,"I found a bra that fit, checked out those measurements, and now compare bras I'm looking into buying with the one I have that fits.

ABraThatFits,3d73ca,zilbet,5,Tue Jul 14 01:05:40 2015 UTC,"For the Maddie you actually sister sized backwards (if that's what you were intending to do), which confused me for a minute! A 34E/DDD holds the same volume as a 32F, so a 32DD is actually two cup sizes as well as a band size smaller than the 34E. The 32DD is definitely too small in the cup but the larger cup gapes, so either you would fit great in the 34DD/32E or you are too full on bottom for the Maddie. I think it's worth trying that cup size in between though. The Lily is a lot better but it's still a little too full on top for you. It shouldn't be a problem if you're comfortable in it though. I wear bras that I gape in to be honest. However, I'm not sure the wires are encompassing all your tissue. I think you could size up in the cup, but that would likely add more gaping. (Hopefully someone else comments better on this...and if you're comfortable I think it's fine, just maybe not the perfect fit! (: ) The Juna's lace is actually supposed to gape. Tuck it in to see if the other part gapes as well...I think it might a little. I think this one is actually the best shape match for you of these three. The wires seem to go out far enough! If the lace bothers you, you could always cut it off. So I suggest more full on bottom bras (when you want more!) like the Deco strapless, Panache Andorra, and Cleo Lucy. (At least I like the Juna and also like these) Others might have even shape recommendations as well! *edited because I kept noticing things"
ABraThatFits,3d73ca,Julez22,5,Tue Jul 14 02:15:47 2015 UTC,"To me, the best fit for you definitely looks like the Cleo Lily in 34E.  Have you posted your measurements/used the bra size calculator? They're very extensive and could point you in a direction you didn't consider before. I would also recommend reading the shape guide. From what I could tell (I could be totally wrong, only you will be able to decide for yourself by looking at your bare breast) you might be full on bottom, which would explain the top gapping for the Maddie and the good fit for the Lily.  What are your specific measurements? I think that would greatly help everyone here in trying to assist you."
ABraThatFits,3d73ca,MidNightMare5998,2,Tue Jul 14 02:16:47 2015 UTC,"Sorry! My measurements were: Snug: 33 Tight: 32 Standing:39 Leaning: 39 Lying: 38. So now it's saying 34 E as my main size. I tried reading the shape info, but am still confused. I felt like when I looked sideways at a 90 degree angle, the tissue on top vs bottom was about even, but I definitely feel like i'm fuller on bottom than on top when standing. Does any of this help? Thanks for your input! :)"
ABraThatFits,3d73ca,Julez22,2,Tue Jul 14 02:22:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think the sideways thing is terribly helpful, but I think you are more full on bottom though possibly even since the Lily works. (And the Maddie could in the right cupsize...see my other comment)"
ABraThatFits,3d73ca,MidNightMare5998,2,Tue Jul 14 02:26:15 2015 UTC,"Definitely! Another way to tell is to first lean over at a 90 degree angle, and then look at yourself sideways. Generally speaking, leaning over will bring all of your breast tissue front and center, and give you a better idea of where it's placed in relation to your chest. Whichever part seems to be more full when you lean over, (over or under the nipple) is where you're fullest. In the shape guide, they also have the link to this diagram which shows some common breast shapes with numbers attached to them, so you can figure out where you're probably fullest. Not sure if you saw it or not--the guide is very extensive. Once you figure out your shape, they have a plethora of different brands suggested for each one.  Happy to help, and good luck! :)"
ABraThatFits,3d73ca,lcl0706,2,Tue Jul 14 08:15:08 2015 UTC,"I think the Lily looks best, followed by the Juna.  The lace is not supposed to lay flat in the Juna (it's a weird design), and you don't appear to have any gapping where the actual cup is.  The Maddie looks too shallow for you, as it is for a lot of people.  The wires look like they're sitting below your IMF.  I personally wouldn't bother with other sizes in the Maddie."

Well, at least you are in good company! :) Pretty much all strapless bras come with convertible straps, so if it's possible to wear a halter strap with the dress, that may be do-able. Halters can be hard on the necks of we curvalicious ones, but you could take the straps off after the main event and photos I guess."
ABraThatFits,3d74lh,Julez22,3,Tue Jul 14 03:06:41 2015 UTC,How would you feel about clear straps? Sometimes you can get bras with interchangeable straps and might have a clear set that wouldn't be obvious in pictures

ABraThatFits,3d74lh,Julez22,4,Wed Jul 15 01:14:22 2015 UTC,"To get a great strapless bra, you want to make sure you're wearing a band tight enough so it's really important to have the band match your ribcage size! The band should hold up 90% of the weight of your boobs! Unfortunately the only option for really low backs is generally getting a corset, but maybe you'd be okay with a nude strapless? Or even adding more fabric to the back to hide the bra? Hopefully the bride would be understanding. Definitely check out the beginner's guide and give us your five measurements. Also give us an idea of your shape and fullness. You'll probably need a strapless that's more projected because you're breastfeeding."

ABraThatFits,3d7291,Lindsw,3,Tue Jul 14 00:57:04 2015 UTC,"With your measurements I get UK 40FF/G or 38 G/GG, depending upon how tight the bra runs and what is available. Some bras come in 40FF that are not available in 38G and vice versa.    a Chantelle bra that I bought on eBay a long time ago (I believe it's a 38GG)   Chantelle is a French brand, their largest cupsize is FR/EU/US-H, which is UK-FF. If you can see a G in the size tag of your Chantelle it is most likely a FR 100G/US 38G/UK 38F.   Since you liked Fantasie and Chantelle in the past, try some more bras from these brands.   Regarding a sportsbra, Panache Sport is a good one. But since you are doing ok in Freya Active, maybe check out the follow-up model to your 4891?   http://www.freyalingerie.com/active/sports/mouldedsportsbra/zinc15/moulded_sports_bra.aspx?colour=zinc"

ABraThatFits,3d5nc7,crazymusicalgenius96,7,Tue Jul 14 01:39:32 2015 UTC,"I actually experience less jiggle in my new bras, but that may be due to the fact that my old bras were four cup volumes too small instead of just two. Maybe a cup with a higher coverage level would help mitigate the jiggling?"
ABraThatFits,3d5nc7,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:07:38 2015 UTC,Next bra to try tomorrow in prime time will be fuller cup and a stiffer fabric so I have high hopes!
ABraThatFits,3d5nc7,deathrottweiler,5,Tue Jul 14 00:21:01 2015 UTC,"I wasn't familiar with that bra, so I looked it up and I see it's very low in the gore (although perhaps not more so than other bras you've worn in your old size). So it doesn't surprise me that it feels kind of jiggly, although even with your old size being small I would have thought a plunge bra would not hold you in enough to prevent that. Maybe I guessed wrong and your old bras were not so plunge-y in the gore?  Maybe next time, try a style with a somewhat higher gore to contain you more and reduce the jiggle sensation?"
ABraThatFits,3d5nc7,redshoefeet,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:19:42 2015 UTC,"The gore seems about the same as many of my old ones, I think they tended to smash me up and out.

ABraThatFits,3d5nc7,aboywithgirls,3,Tue Jul 14 00:23:12 2015 UTC,I have the same issue. I found a full coverage bra helps. I don't know if makes a difference that the bras I 'jiggle' in were padded and not soft cups (the one I don't jiggle in is soft cup).
ABraThatFits,3d5nc7,Honeychile6841,3,Mon Jul 13 20:05:46 2015 UTC,"Yep, same issue. I find the padded ones leave too much hanging perilously at the top and it moves when I do. For general purposes, the softer ones with a bit more coverage work way better."

ABraThatFits,3d2ntw,KAwesome,48,Mon Jul 13 01:58:22 2015 UTC,"I work at a JCPenney, and I work in the kid's department. For reasons unknown, the kid's department is right next to the lingerie department, so I work in lingerie quite often when I fill in for some other associates. Because of this, I had to get ""bra fit certified"".  The JCPenney bra certification course is basically a joke. They teach us to use overbust measurements, which when I learned, I went home and tried for myself. I'm a 30FF. JCPenney's measurement system put me as a 36C.  The course doesn't teach us any practical knowledge beyond sister sizing and obvious fit issues (gapping, tight bands, etc.). We don't go over any of the helpful tips that actual professional bra fitters know. This leads to many lingerie associates being unknowledgeable when it comes to finding a bra for various shapes.  My advice, don't rely on JCP lingerie associates to be experts. Sure, there are some that know what they're doing, but then there were people like me, who worked in the kids department, didn't at the time know anything about bras, and got all of their knowledge from a crappy online course.  TL;DR: Work at a JCP, don't rely on lingerie associates to be helpful."
ABraThatFits,3d2ntw,devohr901,20,Mon Jul 13 03:29:18 2015 UTC,They teach sizing that way so their one size fits all bra system fits the masses. They are gypping people.

So she took me to JCPenney to get me measured and prove me wrong. The woman measured and decided I was a 36C. I actually laughed and said ok bring me one. When it obviously did not fit, they both gave up. I proceeded to do just what you were advised to do and kept sizing up in the band. It wasn't until I was in college that I discovered UK bras and began ordering online. I know now I'm a 32HH. I was struggling with back problems in a 38DDD for years because no one I saw in the US knew how to help me."
ABraThatFits,3d6lge,paisleypunk,4,Mon Jul 13 22:44:35 2015 UTC,30E or 30DD does seem right from your measurements.   Are you scooping and swooping?

I will try it with my 30D once laundry day is over, but it seems like you're onto something.  Would you recommend ordering a 30DD then?  Just because I suspect they'll shrink a bit in a week."
ABraThatFits,3d6lge,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:59:25 2015 UTC,"I figured it'd make a difference :)   If your breast size changes enough throughout the month that you think it'll make a difference in what bra size fits best, then you should consider owning some bigger bras for when your breasts are bigger and some smaller bras for when your breasts are smaller. So you could either wait a week and see if your measurements change enough that the calculator recommends a smaller size, or you could order some bras in 30DD or 30E now and try them on both next week and this time next month. It's up to you."

Also, any information about your shape will help for recommendations.  I really love my Panache Sport. I believe it goes up to a 40 band and you could probably find one reasonably priced on ebay."
ABraThatFits,3d5sfb,SmellsLikeDogBuns,2,Mon Jul 13 19:35:01 2015 UTC,"Oh right!

ABraThatFits,3d5sfb,Shanakitty,2,Mon Jul 13 19:58:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, those measurements do look more like a 42E/F or possibly a 40FF/G (depending on whether the band is stretchy or firm, and how tight you like your bands). 42E (UK) is the same as 42DDD/F in most US brands."
ABraThatFits,3d5sfb,joanna70,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:00:46 2015 UTC,"The standing bust measurement on its own isn't always useful, the lying is on average the most useful with larger or projected breasts, but sometimes the figure that turns out to be the correct one for the calculation is some kind of average across them.  Basically try on a range of sizes, and not just sister sizes (ie the same volume cups but on different band sizes like 42E and 40F, or 42F and 40FF) to see what fits best.  And remember there's actually no such thing as ""an F cup"" ;-)"

ABraThatFits,3d5sfb,t_maia,3,Mon Jul 13 19:50:42 2015 UTC,"Try Lane Bryant. Their bras don't have the best quality-price ratio, but they have fun prints.   Figleaves and Herroom also have a decent list of bras in that size range. No need to order from these shops, but it is a good idea to look at what they got in stock to get an idea what is out there. Google searching ""bra 42DDD"" and looking around amazon should give you some further ideas.   Size-wise I am getting 42DD/E/F as potential range, that is 42DD/DDD/F with Lane Bryant and 95 E/F/G in EU sizes. Depending upon how tight the band of the bra runs, you might get away with a 40 band. Wearing a 40 band (with an extender if necessary) gives you far more options because many brands stop at a 40 band."
ABraThatFits,3d61ce,helpmeout_ABTF,3,Mon Jul 13 20:18:53 2015 UTC,"The first bra looks really good! That one's definitely a keeper, I'd recommend picking up a few of those.  The 30B plunge might just be too shallow. It seems like there's too much room for you near the gore, and perhaps not quite enough at the apex, which is causing the weird gaping.  All four of the Cleos are definitely not suited to shallow shapes. Out of the four of them, Lucy looks the best, as it's the shallowest.   I would definitely suggest continuing to pursue Change bras. You may also want to try some Aerie bras in 30C/D."

Actually I agree with pretty much everything /u/crazymusicalgenius96 said. You might also want to look into 30C bras from The Little Bra Company (note, they don't make D cups and their bands and cups tend to run small, hence 30C) and you might want to check out their bras made for Target --it's a different, more budget-friendly line which I think is only available for on-line shopping."

ABraThatFits,3d61ce,ChocoNoir,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:27:35 2015 UTC,"That's a good question! Looking at the Change site, it reminds me of this bra although it's not identical. As you can see, they call it a plunge. I'm guessing your exact bra is from a previous season and is discontinued, but that Camille bra looks to have much the same cut. Like all companies they will re-use their cuts from season to season, with different tweaks."

ABraThatFits,3d4zig,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Mon Jul 13 19:05:17 2015 UTC,"Probably. Which sucks for OP and her daughter, because Aerie would be perfect!"

ABraThatFits,3d4zig,noys,4,Tue Jul 14 09:46:29 2015 UTC,"I converted the measurements into inches for ease of understanding as about 90% of people here are either from the US, Canada or UK: snug 29.14"", tight 28.34"", standing and lying 31.89"", leaning 33.07"". 30D seems most likely from these measurements.  How much are you willing to spend? The only wide set unlined bras I can think of are Huit. They are rather expensive. You'll have to dig on Google to find any on sale.  Front closure bras tend to be more wide set because the closure adds extra width. There's a super cheap Wacoal one on Bare Necessities at the moment but it isn't unlined. Front close/closure bras do have a shorter lifespan as you can't use tighter hooks as it stretches out. Not being limited by only unlined bras will open up a lot more options in general.   There are a lot of wireless triangle bras and bralettes (mostly lace) as well as S/M/L sized sport bras that offer a little bit of support."
ABraThatFits,3d6h48,c1357,3,Mon Jul 13 22:12:01 2015 UTC,"I would agree that none of these bras are giving you enough space at the top edge and all of them are giving too much space in the bottom outer area. You're tall-rooted and narrow with most of your fullness close to your sternum. I think your roots may actually touch at your sternum, so I agree that trying to find a plunge may be the best idea for now.  I think the Freya Deco Plunge is going to be your best bet. Nearly everyone who tries it gets gaping at the top and in the middle because it's very open along the top edge. The foam it's made out of is generally pretty flexible. It's a nice low plunge, so it shouldn't interfere with your close-set roots further up, and the wires are quite narrow in this size range. A nice bonus is that the band is very stretchy, so you should be able to wear a 30 band in this bra even as your ribcage expands. I'd recommend trying it in 30DD and 30E just to see how everything feels, and you might consider keeping the 30E to grow into if it doesn't fit when you get it. If the 30E ends up fitting by the time you can get one, try getting your hands on a 30F for further growth."
ABraThatFits,3d6h48,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:07:02 2015 UTC,"Do you mean the Freya Deco Moulded Plunge? I tried that bra in my previous post (I just re-linked the imgur album in that post if you wanted to look), and it did not work so well for me then."
ABraThatFits,3d6h48,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Mon Jul 13 23:44:12 2015 UTC,"Both the 28D and the 28DD look too small for you in those pictures, as you've got some folding at the bottom of the cup. That's what's causing the gaping, I think - the cups are collapsing inwards at the bottom forcing the rest of the cup to poke outwards. Since those were too small for you prior to your measurements changing, I definitely think 30E is the way to go now.   If you're concerned about the gaping I'd try the Deco Vibe in 30E, as it's slightly more closed on top, but still very tall and rounded near the sternum.   Cleo Marcie would also be a good choice but it seems like you're mostly focused on t-shirt bras at the moment."
ABraThatFits,3d5tj9,bettyfair,3,Mon Jul 13 19:25:22 2015 UTC,Which bras did you order from asos? I think I remember hearing that their house brand ran quite small.
ABraThatFits,3d5tj9,SmellsLikeDogBuns,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:42:05 2015 UTC,2 new look ones and 1 asos brand one. I remeber the new look ones being almost impossible to clasp at the back!
ABraThatFits,3d5tj9,crazymusicalgenius96,3,Mon Jul 13 19:51:55 2015 UTC,"ASOS brand runs small in band, so you will definitely find the 32 band more comfortable from them! New Look isn't a particularly well-known brand, so those may also run small. I'm not sure. Darker bras tend to run a little tighter than lighter-colored bras, simply because of the dying process. If the bras were all dark colors, that may also have contributed to the tight feeling. Another thing to keep in mind as you shop!  And finally, it does take some time to get used to the tightness of your new band size. The first time I tried on 28 bands, they felt really constricting. I only wore my first BTF for six hours the day it arrived, as it was a bit uncomfortable. But they do loosen up with time. You may find a brand with stretchier brands, such as Freya, more comfortable at first."

I'm hoping these new ones at 32 will be more comfortable, I don't really wear bras at all at the moment, just sports bras most of the time. If I have to wear one then I wear a 34B that i've had for about 4 years! haha. I really don't like the constricted feeling."
ABraThatFits,3d5tj9,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:09:48 2015 UTC,Interesting about the dye thing! It would be cool for someone to measure a bunch of light bras and compare their band measurements to dark. There should be a bratabase section for that. Where did you get this info?
ABraThatFits,3d5tj9,SmellsLikeDogBuns,2,Tue Jul 14 02:32:50 2015 UTC,"Multiple people have compared black and lighter colorways pf the same exact bra and found that the black one was a little smaller overall. Most recently it was with Panache Envy, which has stretch lace that also was affected by the dye, so the cups fit a little smaller too."
ABraThatFits,3d5tj9,Julez22,2,Tue Jul 14 16:27:09 2015 UTC,"If you still have the bras, you might want to get a stretched band measurement. Some bras, although labelled as 30 or 28, may only stretch 26-27-28 inches."

ABraThatFits,3d5tj9,Saskia_C,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:06:46 2015 UTC,"It may also be that you are unused to a tighter band. 30D or DD makes sense to me but if you really don't like the band, definitely go for 32C/D, which fortunately for you is in the bra matrix and you can find it at many stores. Asos might not have bras that are that great or that fit your shape very well, I don't know, never tried them. If you're interested in trying brands we rec around here, maybe give us an idea of your shape!"
ABraThatFits,3d5tj9,Saskia_C,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:31:19 2015 UTC,I just realised that the one bra i do wear is a 32B and it doesn't fit properly - there's too much room at the top that's unfilled. so i guess a 32d is not going to fit at all :/ they're basically quite small but protruded.
ABraThatFits,3d5ev6,Boobhelpthrowaway,3,Mon Jul 13 17:43:00 2015 UTC,"The Melissa looks quite good; I can see where you get slight quad boob but you're clearly very pleased with it and that's what counts. The Nyla looks pretty good too; just a bit of gapping up top and I agree, in these bras the best cup fit would be right in between sizes. However both look wearable. As to whether you should be buying 38GG or 38H, that might really depend on the bra, although I think most would err on the side of going up a cup to avoid quad boob. Ideally you'd try both sizes and decide which is better, or maybe as you wear these two you'll find that one size works better for you than the other. If you were going to get something in Elomi, for example, I'd probably say go for a 38GG.   The Maddie is kind of surprising because yes, it would be considered more shallow but interestingly, it looks not so much shallow as just small all over. The cups are small and the band is very tight, distorting the wires, yet the wire looks to be sitting in your IMF. That fit has me wondering what Maddie would look like on you if it were available in 40GG, which it's not. If it were possible for you to try it in that size, it would be clearer if the shape is incompatible with yours. I suppose you could look for it in 38H to see if that works better, but I'm inclined to think it's not worth it."
ABraThatFits,3d5ev6,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:09:16 2015 UTC,"I personally like a pretty tight band, so I didn't notice anything wrong with the band of the Maddie. I didn't realize the wires were being distorted! I probably wouldn't buy this type of molded cup again, but $20 on sale it was worth a try.

Also I seem to remember reading that there's some difference in the fit of the standard Maddie and Maddie Pop, but I don't recall specifics."

And I've read that there's a difference in fit between the continuity Maddie and the colorful ones, but it was a blog post that came out right when the continuity Maddie was released.

ABraThatFits,3d4jkz,t_maia,3,Mon Jul 13 22:20:27 2015 UTC,Nipples showing - look up reuseable silicone pasties. I've seen them on sale at amazon for less than 5 USD. They drastically widen your option.   Foam lined cups are not a good idea if you are trying to find a good bra. It is much easier to figure out why a bra does not fit if you have a bra that is not padded - the shape the unpadded bra gives when it does not fit can be very telling. In contrast the stiff cups of moulded foam domes hide a fuckton of fit issues and it is hard to get a good fit in them. Your breasts need to match the shape of the foam cups exactly or it won't fit while in a softcup the lace can contour to your breasts somewhat.

But in-cup quadboob tends to be an issue if the shape of the bra is not ideal for your breasts. I get horrible in-cup quadboob in Curvy Kate bras because of this.   In your case it sounds as if the bra is a bit too small. All the volume that does not fit into the lower part of the cup ends up getting pushed upwards against the stretchy lace. After awhile the tissue then spills over the seam connecting the stretchy lace with the non-stretchy part of the cup. A larger cup might fix this.   That said some women just don't get along with stretchy cups."

Probably should have been in a J/JJ. I only discovered ABTF a few months before I had surgery so I went with ""good enough"".   I wanted an E cup originally (I had to show my surgeon bra band project pictures becuase he didn't understand cup sizes, lol). However, I'm happy with my size now. I'm pretty tall so it all looks very proportional."

ABraThatFits,3d368r,cupcakery,2,Mon Jul 13 05:03:02 2015 UTC,"Panache bands do run pretty tight/true to size. My measurements are a bit bigger than yours (32 snug/29.5 tight), and I exclusively wear Panache among UK brands. 32 bands are more comfortable to me, but I find myself on the tightest hooks within a month, while the one 30K I have has not yet stretched out enough to not need the extender after two months of wear (it is black though, so that might be part of it). So I think I would ideally get a 31 band if that existed. However, I also have heavier breasts than you do now, so I particularly need a really firm band. If you can, order both sizes and see which you think will work best.   In addition to the Jasmine, I would also try Cleo Marcie and Lily/Erin."

The first predecessor of the Lily/Erin cut, Sasha, was based on Marcie but there are noticeable differences. It has a roomier bottom section and a more closed top section. This difference grew especially marked in the Meg version of the cut.  Lily is only good for FoT if you have quite short roots. The top edge is too closed. Usually FoT breasts will get cutting in along the edge, sometimes with wrinkling in the top section because breast tissue can't get in the cup to fill it.

ANY other molded bra would have been better to try than Neve ;-)  You may get along with a Freya Deco plunge (the original one, not the newer ones like Vibe, Delight, etc), but it may not have enough immediate projection either.  Panache Jasmine - close, but not enough projection.  Maybe try Envy.  Panache Envy has a lot more immediate projection than Jasmine does, IIRC.  Freya Enchanted - ok, hang with me here.  Freya unlined plunge bras do run a cup size big in my experience.  You could try it in a 34E.  But Enchanted is an odd bird for Freya.  It runs wider and shallower than Freya's other unlined offerings.  Siren or the Starlet unlined plunge (not half cup) could work better.  There are several out there on Amazon, Enchanted is just a weirdo.  I tried it too because it was so dang cheap, but it was a no for the same reasons as you.  Freya bras in general have softer and more flexible wires as well as stretchier and longer bands than Panache, which is known for their really firm wires, so that could be why you found the Freya more comfortable.  As far as plunges peeking out of your shirts - some of that can be due to the placement of your boobs on your chest (high or low), and there are bras out there with really low gores, and hopefully someone out there has more info than me because I fall out of the center of deep plunge bras so I avoid them.  I don't have the shirt problem because my boobs are set so low on my chest I can wear a bandeau bra without it sticking out of a V neck tee shirt.  So I'm probably no good for advice on that!"
ABraThatFits,3d2q6c,lcl0706,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:05:59 2015 UTC,"Where could I get a bra extender that would fit the Cleo Lucy? I do admit the cups of that fit pretty well, and that seems like it would be a good way to see if I found the band size a bit too snug or if the firmness of the wires were more uncomfortable, since you mentioned that Freya and Panache run opposite on both those spectrums.  I do measure a 35 snug and 32 tight, so you're right that the 38E might be too big in the long run. The way you explained it, it sounds like my issue really is more with the stiffness of the wires, so I guess it'll be hit or miss to see if the extender solves the comfort issues without compromising the fit.  I might give the other Freya plunge bras a go as well, since I did like the feel of the Enchanted, but I do agree with you that the issues I had were mainly shape related, so it probably won't fit great even in the right size.  Thanks for your advice!"

ABraThatFits,3d2q6c,lcl0706,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:56:47 2015 UTC,"Yes! Amazon has bunches of them, both 2 and 3 hook styles, for really cheap. I bought a multi pack with more extenders than I'll ever need in a variety of colors for like $7 with free prime shipping.   The fabric/sewing dept of your local Walmart (or similar store) might have one too."
ABraThatFits,3d2q6c,CherryAmesAgain,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:32:48 2015 UTC,You look as though (like myself and many others) you have a somewhat flared ribcage that protrudes a bit just under your breasts.  I find bras with firmer wires really uncomfortable.    I also wonder if this could be causing the gores on all these bras to float.
ABraThatFits,3d2q6c,CherryAmesAgain,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:06:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess I would describe my ribcage as flared/protruding.  What's even more odd about the fits of these bras, especially in relation to the floating gore, is that I ended up getting a bra extender and trying it on the Cleo Lucy, and with that the cups were sitting closer to my IMF on the side and then seemed too big (as compared to the tight band that was stretching the wires further past my IMF), while the gore was still floating.  So maybe the gore issue is something I can't really get around with the shape of my chest?"
ABraThatFits,3d0eg9,jlove922,15,Sun Jul 12 13:09:50 2015 UTC,I like how UK uses double letters because it lets people feel less intimidated by letters that are further down the alphabet. 38JJ is a lot less intimidating than 38N.

The 28F will keep everything in place and give you extra padding, while the 32C will push everything together for ""buttcrack"" cleavage.  I have shallow full on bottom/side breasts and this is the only way I've ever gotten cleavage.  Just a warning that you might end up with underwire sitting on breast tissue (depending on how badly the 32C fits) so this isn't healthy!  Very infrequent use only."

ABraThatFits,3d1isb,petitecollegiate,2,Mon Jul 13 03:21:48 2015 UTC,"So if you're actually interested in Pushup bras, Konrad (a polish brand) makes them in your size. You can buy them for around $35 on ebay brand new. Plunge styles often give a more pushed together look (atleast on me). Are you shallow or projected? What are you measurements? That would help me make better recommendations. Do you want cakes on a plate cleavage or smushed together? What bras in your new size have you tried?"
ABraThatFits,3d1isb,petitecollegiate,2,Sun Jul 12 20:27:13 2015 UTC,"I'm going for smushed together and the Konrad bras look PERFECT! Thank you for the suggestion! Have you had experience with Konrad bras? Would they give wide boobs cleavage? I really wanna try them out. I'm shallow (in fact, my boobs are very tall, so they're more oval-y when I wear a push-up). My measurements (inches):   Snug Underbust: 27 Tight Underbust: 26 Standing Bust: 33 Leaning Bust: 34 Lying Bust: 32.5   The calculator says it's a 28F but I have 28E's that still work. I also have old 30DD's for when I don't want a tight band.  28E - Cleo Maddie: Gaps a bit at the center top when I slouch but the straps (and the area where the straps meet the top) was hella tight. I quadboob in that area after I swoop and scoop but then it settles back. Outer bottom corners were tight, too.   28F - Parfait Charlotte: Fits great! Was tight where the straps are but much less tight than the Maddie.  28F - Parfait Tamara: Again, super tight on the straps and area where the straps meet the cups. I like the fit of the cups a lot but it doesn't give me cleavage and the lace is itchy.  30DD - Lepel Fiore Plunge and Curvy Kate Desire multiway: Hated both. No cleavage whatsover. I quadboob out of the top without the padding (for the plunge) and the cups flattened my boobies instead of pushing up.   30DD - Freya Patsy Padded Balconette Longline - I gap at the lacy top parts and straps are tight. Meh, decent fit."
ABraThatFits,3d1isb,syrashiraz,2,Sun Jul 12 21:54:21 2015 UTC,"I have not yet tried them, but I've heard they're fairly average all around in the cups in terms of width and projection and a bit firm in the band (as is typical for most Polish). The push-up padding for them is generally the removable type. If you're looking for more cleavage 28E (bigger) is probably going to work better for you that 28F. Konrad makes half cup sizes for both E an F so you could go for the smaller F cup or the bigger E cup. If there's a little bit of quad the push up will just make that look like its meant to be cleavage. The cleavage you get should be much better than cleavage from a bra in the wrong size just because of the added lift. I'm a much more projected shape, so I can't give great advice on what shape of push-up to choose. For the smushed together look you're going to want something that has a low narrow gore that doesn't work against you. I hope that's helpful! Let me know how it turns out :) I'd love to hear more people's experiences with them."
ABraThatFits,3d1isb,TheydontKnow,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:50:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! This is beyond helpful. It never occurred to me that I needed a low narrow gore. Removable cups sound awesome, too. I'll definitely make a post about how it turns out (but that'll probably be a while from now ahaha).    Konrad makes half cup sizes for both E an F             Oh, should I get a half cup or a plunge? I'm okay with a bit of quad boob (it's not gonna be an everyday thing) so a 28E sounds like a good idea. I'm so happy I don't have to sacrifice a good fit anymore!"
ABraThatFits,3d1isb,TheydontKnow,2,Sun Jul 12 23:19:51 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend a low narrow one for everyday on you because of your shape , but it should help achieve ideal cleavage. I meant that they make both a smaller and a larger E and F. So you can have e and a half or little f. Super helpful for those of us inbetween sizes! Plunges will be best for smushed cleavage."

I only included the one set of photos because I feel like they were the most comfortable, yet didn't fit me properly.  Not sure the other bras I tried on, except one was a wacoal convertible. The cups felt okay, but overall the bra was incredibly uncomfortable; band was tight and i think there was a lot of boning or something. I know it needs to be tight especially for a strapless, but the bra just felt really stiff.  Posting measurements in the edits....  Thanks!"

ABraThatFits,3d1cl5,vonlowe,9,Sun Jul 12 18:37:14 2015 UTC,"What bra do you have? The hooks aren't always sewn in particularly well, so you might just want to reinforce it with a couple of stitches. I remember seeing a tutorial post for it a while ago, but you'd have to search for it using the search bar as I don't think it's made it into the tutorials list yet.  Another possibility is that your ribcage expands a lot when you breathe or sit. I know mine does. I'd only be able to wear a 26 band in something very stretchy like the Deco (if such a thing existed, of course).   Wearing the bra multiple days in a row without a rest isn't the best for the elastic, but if this one is just holding you over until you can get one that really fits then it doesn't matter quite as much. If you really like the bra, though, you might want to look for replacements on Ebay as they'll be relatively inexpensive and you already know how it fits, so no need to worry about return shipping."
ABraThatFits,3d1cl5,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Sun Jul 12 18:54:50 2015 UTC,"I have the cleo Juna in 28F, I've had it for just over two months but I've been wearing it most days since the end of may.  Weird that you say that because I remember measuring my ribcage at the start and end of a day and my rib cage went from 24->26 inches. I used to sing in a choir and I have a pretty obvious flow murmur (heart rate changing while breathing in/out, it's normal, mines easy to listen to though.) so I think my ribcage expands easily. Based on what otterhugs said when they were approving the post  and you I'll stick to a 28 band, I've heard that the Juna is known for being quite loose as 28 bands go!  The problems with fit in this bra are that the cups are too separated and slightly too narrow for me, so while it's not a bad fit, I wouldn't re-buy the bra so I believe it should hold out for a couple more months. If not, I do have an old 32D that I can use as a nipple cover until I can buy bras again. Thanks! :)"
ABraThatFits,3d1cl5,lcl0706,3,Sun Jul 12 19:48:01 2015 UTC,"It's entirely possible (probable!) this bra is too small in the cups for you.  If you measure as a 28F/FF, you likely need the FF if not a G in the Juna, which runs at least one cup size small.  So if the cups are too small for you and especially too narrow, your boobs are taking up space in the band, making it fit tighter than it should."
ABraThatFits,3d1cl5,Shanakitty,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:55:44 2015 UTC,"When I bought this, I sized up from a 28E which was my size in the panache sports bra. Now I definetly quadboob a lot in the sports bra and the lace lies completely flat on the left boob and flat across most of the right boob as well, and I know when the juna fits well, the lace isn't meant to lie flat."
ABraThatFits,3d1cl5,eveningtrain,3,Sun Jul 12 21:23:30 2015 UTC,"The hooks always pull out of my bras over time because boobs are heavy, and there is constant tension on the hooks to keep the band firm. This happens even on bands that are too loose and ride up in the back (like my 34H Panache Sports).   You are quite a bit smaller than me, so may not have that problem as much, but wearing one bra most of the time will tend to wear it out quickly."
ABraThatFits,3d11vp,Eggfish,6,Sun Jul 12 17:09:48 2015 UTC,"Mimi Holliday makes the lowest-coverage full-bust bras I've seen, but it's a luxury brand and they're pretty pricey. Also, I don't know if the shape would work for you (they tend to be rather shallow). You might want to look on Ebay to see what's available in your size."
ABraThatFits,3d11vp,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Sun Jul 12 18:02:36 2015 UTC,So I'm around your size and age and I completely feel your pain with the full coverage bras. I love Freya Icon padded plunge. The cups are half padded and half lacy. They don't show under any of my V-necks. I also love Ewa Michalak's 3DM unlined plunges. They come up low and have lots of sexy lace. My personal favorite brand right now is Comexim and if you get the reduced cup and lowered gore they're fairly moderate coverage. I haven't found many halfcups that fit me personally (they're mostly too wide) but if they work for you that could be an option. Curvy Kate Dare is a nice unlined plunge if you can find it. On me it works well for open V-necks.
ABraThatFits,3d11vp,petitecollegiate,2,Sun Jul 12 19:37:10 2015 UTC,"I am also a 28DD but my everyday bra is Natori Feathers Contour Plunge in 30D. It doesn't show under low cut tops, though the fabric comes higher up the straps to create a smooth line, it doesn't come up high in the cup. It's good for a more shallow shape, as well."
ABraThatFits,3d11vp,eveningtrain,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:46:54 2015 UTC,The Freya Deco comes in a half cup style. I am the same size as you and the half cup doesn't show under clothes like the normal demi does. I've got two that I wear all the time with my low-cut tops and dresses because I also find that many bras in my size have too much fabric.
ABraThatFits,3d11vp,herestoshuttingup,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:24:53 2015 UTC,You might like Mat Lingerie plunges with push up padding. They run about a full size small in band. UK Amazon and their own webshop. EDIT: They're also on eBay.
ABraThatFits,3d11vp,noys,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:56:21 2015 UTC,"See if any b.tempt'd by Wacoal bras suit you in 30DD. They have less fabric. Unfortunately, the band might be too stretchy for you to get a good fit.  Calvin Klein also might make some 30DDs that work for you. Supposedly they have pretty firm bands. I don't know enough about the brand to recommend specific styles though, sorry."
ABraThatFits,3d2c0x,spacecharbs,4,Sun Jul 12 23:27:31 2015 UTC,In all 3 pics the bands are riding really high up your back. I looked at fit Check and wonder if a band size down and another cup might improve fit.
ABraThatFits,3d2c0x,basylica,3,Sun Jul 12 23:38:28 2015 UTC,"In her case I wonder whether simply pulling down the band in the back will do the trick. Sometimes a band is tight enough not to ride up, but it has to be put into the correct position. (I have this problem too.) Many women are so used to band that rides up that this position feels right - until you tell them it should be parallel to the ground."
ABraThatFits,3d2c0x,t_maia,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:15:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I never even pay attention to the band at the back. It just felt like the place it's always been so I thought it was fine. I will try your suggestion. Could it ride up because I've tightened the straps and the weight of my boobs is pulling it up?"
ABraThatFits,3d2c0x,t_maia,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:59:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is a potential explanation. Please lengthen the straps again. Straps shortened to the max can hide a too large cup and other fit issues. Lowering the band in the back will hopefully pull the cups out of your armpits."
ABraThatFits,3d2c0x,basylica,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:08:08 2015 UTC,All the 36's besides the panache feel nicely snug. I feel like going to a 38 will feel way too loose. I used the band extender on the tightest setting with the paloma and it seemed too loose and unsupportive. The two elomi were 38 and I could tighten those all the way. I thought you were supposed to wear it on the loosest hook.
ABraThatFits,3d2c0x,yellkaa,2,Sun Jul 12 23:48:25 2015 UTC,Down. Not up. 34 instead of 36
ABraThatFits,3d2c0x,t_maia,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:03:45 2015 UTC,My bad! I don't think I'd be able to close a panache at 34. I can barely do 36. The 36 pulls the skin and fat from my sides into the middle and creates two vertical fat rolls for lack of a better description. Looks bad and isn't comfortable.
ABraThatFits,3d2c0x,t_maia,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:57:02 2015 UTC,"have you tried to close it reversed upside-down with your breasts out of cups for them not distorting the bra and putting the bra right under your IMF parallely to ground?  Look here: http://prntscr.com/7s6b4y The red bra here is small in cup and big in band, so it's riding down and it can really feels too tight in band (because of your heavy breasts pushing it more and more trying to find some room), and the blue line represents a smaller band of a bra with well-fitted cups which will be more comfortable being actually shorter. Any diagonal line will always be longer than the horisontal one, so the band can be shorter if it doesn't ride up."
ABraThatFits,3d2c0x,EmmaInFrance,2,Mon Jul 13 14:40:14 2015 UTC,"Please pull the band of all the bras down in the back. The band of the bra should be parallel to the ground. In all bras the hooks and eyes sit too far up on you. This affects the fit of the bra.    do any of these bras look like they fit,   Jasmine is close.   Out of all three I like the Panache Jasmine the best and the Paloma the least. You got very projected breasts and it is good that you have all that space in front in the Jasmine. Yes Paloma is rounder, but at the price of jamming everything into your armpit. You can wear Paloma if you want to, but I would return it.    There seems to be extra space on the sides of the bras.    This means that the wires are too wide for you.    I really dislike how high the front side part of the Jasmine comes up.    Are you talking about the gore? Take a look at Paloma, it comes up even higher.    The wires don't bother me, but where the band/cup curve to go under the armpit is annoyingly tall and tight.   Are you talking about the part where the strap connects with the cup?    The lace at the top of Paloma isn't taut. I don't know if that's normal or if it means it doesn't fit.   Paloma is based upon Ariza. This is a common problem with both bras and has to do with their cupshape and how tall their cups are.    ordered two elomi bras (caitlyn & amelia) when they were cheap on bare neccessities. I got 38HH and they were laughably large in the cups.    Here wire width comes into play. Elomi has wide wires. You need narrow wires, so all that cupspace to the sides and under the arms that Elomi bras typicall got is wasted on you.    I also tried the Freya Eden in a 36HH, but it didnt work well. There was a lot of extra space on the sides and even with the straps tightened the furthest my boobs still looked droopy.   This is a common problem with Freya bras in your size range, it has to do with the wires being too soft for the weight of the breasts.   If you want to keep trying UK bras, Gorgeous by Debenhams is your best bet IMO.   But I fear you are best served by trying Polish brands. Ewa Michalak, Comexim."

You probably don't want to go down in cup size if it's slight, though another style may fit you better up top.  More important is the digging and discomfort you feel, especially because you're nursing. Panache is known to have very firm wires. This gives lots of support but causes many women to have a problem with digging.   If you want to try a nursing bra, I'd suggest something from Cake Lingerie (they have both wired and non-wired options) or the Freya Pure nursing bra. Nursing bras have softer wires, and you want to make sure that your wires aren't resting on breast tissue because that increases the risk of getting mastitis. Another non-wired nursing bra to try is Panache Sophie. You will sacrifice some support in a non-wired bra, but the tradeoff for comfort is probably worth it.  As for your Floris, you may have success bending the wires out a bit at the sides--some people do this. It's normal to get some marks from a bra band, that should go away within an hour or so after you take it off. However, major discomfort, pain, or marks that don't go away are a problem, definitely."
ABraThatFits,3d0zi1,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:42:22 2015 UTC,"The bra is definitely loose on top so now I wonder if I am not FoT like I thought I was previously. That said, it doesn't feel like a big deal (i don't know how much is too much gap?) and the rest of the bra seems to fit alright.  I think I will move the wires outwards a bit! Is there a tut for this somewhere? I hope I don't ruin the bra! Ugh, the wires did dig way uncomfortably in to my sides. I can definitely deal with the band it wasn't that diggy, just that the wires made it feel worse all around. I will look at my maternity options.   Thanks a lot for your help! I will get on to Cake an see what they have as well.  Edit : OCD about grammar ;)"
ABraThatFits,3d0zi1,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:10:47 2015 UTC,"Hi! As far as the gap goes, if it doesn't seem excessive to you, doesn't bother you under clothes, and the rest of the bra fits well then it isn't a big deal. As for bending the wires, there is a tutorial here but I should mention that I have never used it, nor actually bent wires myself. I mentioned it because it is something that has come up quite a lot, and some of our members have mentioned bending wires with some success, but obviously it is at your own risk. You could try stretching a cotton ball out so it's sort of flat and slipping it in between the wire end and your skin to see if that helps. Very high-tech, lol, but it's not permanent! This I have done and found it to help with side boning on a new bra, but the cotton did leave a temporary impression on my skin."
ABraThatFits,3d151t,Cartwheelsbro,4,Sun Jul 12 17:35:37 2015 UTC,"I think that you're going to be better off in a 30D/DD because your snug and tight underbust measurements being so close together indicate that you don't have much ""squish"" so it will be comfier, and still supportive, for you.  Freya bras tend to run quite loose/stretchy in the band, so in Freya bras you're looking at a 28 band possibly.    The Freya bra hurts around where the band is a lot and there is a little bit of gapping at the top   The Freya Rapture is for boobs that are fuller on top, so its likely it hurts at the bottom as your boobs are getting squashed, and it gaps at the top as you're not fuller on top.  What shape is the 30C? Do you have narrow shoulders? If its a balconette you may want to try a plunge or a racerback/racerback clip or a bra with a U shape at the back.   Also, if my boobs are pushed together at all the gore doesn't tack.   Sounds like you need a larger cup size, and your measurements indicate D/DD so you may need a 28DD/30DD.   I feel like the 30C band is too loose   Sometimes you will need a 28 band, and sometimes (as with Cleo) you will prefer to go with a 30 band. A good way to figure out if the band is the issue, put the bra on backwards and upside down so your boobs don't affect the fit by getting inside the band, and see how tight the band is.  You MAY be a 28D, or you MAY be a 28DD, or a 30D/DD, but shape is totally important as even in the right size, the wrong shape will cause the wrong fit.  Have a look at the shape guide for some ideas about which type of bras to try.  Cleo Lucy / Kali are probably a good idea to try, and I would suggest going with a 30D in them as Cleo bands run tighter."
ABraThatFits,3d151t,xuenylom,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:48:41 2015 UTC,Ahh ok thank you so much for your help! The 30C Calvin Klein bra is just a basic lightly lined bra and looks like this. I might have narrow shoulders but I'm not sure.
ABraThatFits,3d151t,xuenylom,2,Sun Jul 12 18:14:12 2015 UTC,"I may be wrong but that type of bra generally does not seem to fit anyone well (not a full band). Moulded bras are not really the way to go when trying to figure out fit, because unless your boob exactly resembles the shape of the cup, there's either gapping or hidden issues. The best way to find out your shape is to try on unpadded bras. Sometimes you find out that unpadded simply doesn't provide enough support (I don't wear any) but they are great to try on anyhow to figure out your shape. I for example tried on Tutti Rouge's Fifi and therefore have figured out that I need either vertical seamed bras, bras with open necklines, or both, so I figure I'm fuller on top. For you it's likely the opposite - horizontal seams and closed necklines."
ABraThatFits,3d151t,tealeaf_egg,2,Sun Jul 12 19:37:22 2015 UTC,"horizontal seams and closed necklines.   I'm no expert, but OP did mention looking for shallow bras and I would support that, given their size. As far as I know, for shallow breasts, horizontal seams and closed necklines rarely work, and I often see people recommending bras with vertical seams for them."
ABraThatFits,3d151t,xuenylom,2,Mon Jul 13 01:03:35 2015 UTC,You're right. I suppose shallow kinda makes the top/bottom thing less effective. OP just needs to make sure that they find a vertical seamed cup with enough projection near the bottom and open at the right angle to take into account them being shallow but also not as full on top
ABraThatFits,3d151t,tealeaf_egg,3,Mon Jul 13 07:33:46 2015 UTC,"The Freya bra hurts around where the band is a lot   Can you elaborate on this? Is this a breast-tissue-hurt, a poking-ribcage hurt, rubbing-against-my-skin hurt, or something else? Also, did you scoop and swoop properly?"
ABraThatFits,3d151t,joanna70,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:23:25 2015 UTC,It hurts my rib cage. I usually try to adjust it around to see if I can find a spot where it doesn't hurt but that doesn't happen. I do swoop and scoop properly although there's not much there to swoop and scoop lol.
ABraThatFits,3d151t,joanna70,2,Mon Jul 13 14:01:48 2015 UTC,"I know it's counterintuitive but have you tried settling the band down to horizontal, the cups up properly under your boobs (into the ""inframammary fold"") and tightening it?  The worst pain I get is from the band loosening and the underwires being able to move down fractionally.  This causes pain directly under the underwires but can also hurt at the sides."
ABraThatFits,3d151t,tealeaf_egg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:05:44 2015 UTC,Ok so I'm pretty sure the bra is in the inframammary fold but sometimes when I adjust it I pull it down and more on to my ribs which makes it even more painful. I'm worried if I pull it up it'll just sit directly on my boobs which is something some of my old 32A bras used to do and that was really uncomfortable too.
ABraThatFits,3d151t,Brookwood38,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:36:43 2015 UTC,"So have a look at the marks the wires leave and see if you're right, having them down on the ribcage isn't right and will often be very uncomfortable as you've found, if the bra fits right, it will stay up in the IMF and stay there without having the straps super tight.  Try bending the wires around your body while you're wearing them (depends on how malleable they are, if very stiff you may need to do it off the body and with pliers) to see if that also helps, and do a mini swoop and scoop at the same time if you can to keep everything in the right place."
ABraThatFits,3d19ne,jetsetter9488,2,Sun Jul 12 18:13:15 2015 UTC,"Putting your measurements in the calculator gives me 32DD/E, so it's possible that 32E could work better for you. However, looking at your descriptions and your pictures of the Jasmine makes me think that your overflow is being caused by the closed tops of the bras you've tried cutting into your tissue. I think you could possibly have tall roots (it's hard to tell from your Jasmine pics) and pretty much all the bras you've tried (excepting Marcie) don't work particularly well with tall roots in this size range. So I think the quadboob would be solved most effectively with a top edge that's more open than Marcie.  When you've got space at the bottom, is the underwire sitting in your IMF? If it is, and you've still got extra space at the bottom of the cups, then the bottom part of the cup might have too much room for you. If you haven't been able to make sense of that chart in the shape guide with the numbers 1-6 in it, this relates to what I'm talking about. These bras are all suited to shapes 5 & 6 on the bottom, and since you think you're conical you might be closer to shape 4.   So what bras to try now? I highly recommend half cups. I think starting with Freya Patsy would be best at this point; Freya Lauren might also work but it could potentially be too spacious on the bottom. Freya Patsy might end up too wide and shallow for you, since you don't seem to be having issues with the underwires in Panache Jasmine, but it is one of the most open-on-top bras I know of. There are also the discontinued Fauve and Masquerade half cups; these are generally narrower and more projected than either of Freya's cuts. Comexim and Ewa Michalak also make nice half cups that are about average in width and projection. I'm also average in width and projection, and they've been recommended to me."
ABraThatFits,3d19ne,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:42:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I actually have a 30E patsy half cup and I believe it's too shallow. 32DD Darcy (minor quadding), 34D harlequin Medina (so close to perfect) and 32DD harlequin Dephi (slightly too big) actually fit the best so far."
ABraThatFits,3d19ne,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:56:54 2015 UTC,"I have Medina too! What do you dislike about your Medina - what's the thing that keeps it from being perfect? Is it too open on top? Not projected enough? Too wide wires?  My Medina is the closest thing I have to a textbook perfect fit. The wires are optimal width and shape (so Nike swooshy, I love it!), the cups are not too open or too closed on top, the band has been comfy ever since I bought it, and to top it off it's a gorgeous bra. My one gripe is that the wires are too short on the sides, letting some of my swoop and scoop escape. In recent weeks I've realized that it may not actually be projected enough for my bigger left boob (which is how swoop and scoop is being coaxed to escape in the first place). Either that or my boobs are growing."
ABraThatFits,3czo3z,HobbitLass,6,Sun Jul 12 06:08:43 2015 UTC,"The simplified way to measure for a bra is to measure the underbust and the bust (measurements 1 and 3 in this guide). If the underbust is an even number, that's the band size. If it's an odd number, round up for the band size. The cup size is the difference between the bust measurement and the (unrounded) underbust measurement. 1 inch of difference is an A cup, 2 inches is a B cup, and so on.   However, measuring on top of clothes and in a bra that is ill-fitting and/or worn wrong is going to give incorrect results. The best way to measure for a bra is topless. So I would advise you measure your customers without a shirt on whenever possible, and that you keep in mind that the first size you bring them will likely not be their best fit.   Perhaps you could bring them the bras to try without telling them the size? If the bra fit them well and then you told them the size, they'd probably be a lot more open to considering buying the bra."
ABraThatFits,3czo3z,hurrrrrmione,14,Sun Jul 12 06:43:12 2015 UTC,"I'd also throw in a ""you know bridal sizing ha ha ha!"" so they don't get so much of a sticker shock when you put them in a non-standard size."
ABraThatFits,3czo3z,JsterJ,3,Sun Jul 12 09:45:56 2015 UTC,"If they actually got completely topless, but have pretty sagging boobs, how exactly would you measure their overbust? Not specific to this thread, but I never actually thought about this before."
ABraThatFits,3czo3z,le_petit_renard,6,Sun Jul 12 13:05:50 2015 UTC,That is the reason why we use FIVE measurements instead of just two. This is all in the beginner's guide in the sidebar.
ABraThatFits,3czo3z,MutantToenail,2,Sun Jul 12 13:49:37 2015 UTC,But the overbust measurement is one if those five. How would you get that correctly if you boobs extend almost to your belly button? Where do you measure then? Just the fullest point? Leave that measurement out completely? Measure with a bra without padding?
ABraThatFits,3czo3z,le_petit_renard,4,Sun Jul 12 14:06:32 2015 UTC,You measure at the fullest point. =)
ABraThatFits,3czo3z,otterhugs,2,Sun Jul 12 15:46:18 2015 UTC,"The leaning bust is vital for that very reason. I have somewhat conical breasts and both my standing and lying measurements are 37"" but my leaning is 38"" (with a 32"" under bust) and it is the leaning measurement that puts me in a 32E - my correct size."

ABraThatFits,3czo3z,MutantToenail,6,Sun Jul 12 18:39:02 2015 UTC,"The problem is the bras we sell are never correct for the size they say. The band/body is always too tight. And the cup is always too big...   The best solution I can think of would be to enter the bras in question into bratabase. This would allow you to compare the bras you got to other bras and get you a better handle on how they are really sized.   You are a seamstress, so taking measurements should be second nature to you. Spent 2-3 minutes each day on measuring the bras you got and entering them into bratabase and after two to three weeks you should have the whole range.   I agree with JsterJ ""bridal sizing, lol"" - looks like the companies that make bridal lingerie try to compensate for a lot of things that are wrong with the mentality that every woman has to fit into the  32-44 A-DD range, including making their cups oddly sized and their bands very tight to compensate for the too large band.    And then of course there is the whole ""I'M NOT A 32DDD! I'M A 36A!"" Idk if there is anything I can do about that short of cutting the tag out!   Most women do not know their correct bra size. Because of the mentality that every woman has to fit into the  32-44 A-DD range unless you are an alien or a pornstar with artificial boobs, many women insist upon being size X despite their measurements giving evidence to the contrary.   Not telling them the size and or joking about bridal sizing would be one way to handle this.   Best warn them beforehand that the size you bring them might not be what they usually wear.    Part of the problem is the lack of shapes we have. We have 2 bras to pick from...   This is atrocious. Talk to your manager. You need more lingerie options.   Especially for plus-size brides I can recommend that you start offering the Goddess 689.    Also, how do you measure for a bustier?? I'm a bigger girl... And i have rolls that measure larger than my band size... So how do you handle that!?    Same way you handle dresses. Size for the largest part and then take everything else in - if you can.   That said depending upon body shape some women are simply not meant to wear long-line bras, bustiers, bodies or corsets unless they are custom-made. I know I am one. I am very pear-shaped, my underbust is the narrowest part of my body. If a bustier or similar (one piece swimsuits!!) fits my hips, waist and booty and my bust, it will be way too wide around the underbust section. For example I would need around a 50C/D in a bustier to accomodate my chub, but my real brasize is 42GG/H. For me the only way to handle this regarding shape-wear has been to go with a regular bra and high-waist panties/girdles. I swear by Rago."

She says that she works at David's Bridal - they're basically the Walmart of wedding dresses (which isn't to say they don't carry lovely dresses - they do, I bought my dress there and it was perfect for me - but it's all mass-produced and tend to be of lower quality).

You know that the cups in a 38A are the exact same size as the cups in a 36B, right? That's not sizing down in the cup. The cup size is dependent on the bandsize. There's no such thing as a ""B-cup"" because B-cups are different sizes depending on what the bandsize of the bra is."

ABraThatFits,3d1dox,injuredpenguin,5,Sun Jul 12 18:46:13 2015 UTC,"I would definitely not recommend a 30 band for you. The calculator is sizing you down because of the difference in your snug and tight measurements, but you'll almost certainly be more comfortable in a 32 band, with the bonus of having many more options to try. However, your 34C is likely feeling tight because of the cups being too small. A way to test this is to try the band on backwards with the cups facing down on your back, and see how the band feels then. Most likely it will not feel too tight when you do that. You can try this test when you try new bras, too, in order to see if the band size feels too tight.  I'd suggest starting with 32DD and see how you do with that. It's a size you can find in many department stores (and even VS, if you're so inclined) but if you want some recommendations, please have a look through the Shape Guide and post some information about your shape."

Calculator gives me a straight 30E actually. From what I can tell, those measurements sound good. If the 34C is tight, it could be possible that you are a straight 32DD. Usually a band that is supposedly too tight though it is actually too big could be because the 34C is too small in the cups and tissue is going towards the band if the cup doesn't fit. Or the brand runs tighter. Your measurements definitely point towards a 32 band. Your bust measurements are within a 1/2 inch of mine but my UB is about 29/29.5 snug instead of 31.5 and about 28/28.5 tight. You have more difference between your snug and tight, which means you have more squish. Mine is a bit more firm."

I think all three of those Freyas use the same cut, so same thing on those. Envy is a little fuller in the cup than Andorra.  The 30E is based off your leaning measurement and might turn out to be an over-estimate, so I'd suggest trying bras in 30DD and 30E. It's good to try one style in both sizes, and a lot will depend on what's available to you, but if you could find, let's say, a Lucy in 30DD and a Kali in 30E, they should be directly comparable in fit; same if you mixed and matched the Freya styles for size (I hope that makes sense). Andorra and Envy wouldn't fit quite the same. I'd say either try one of those in both sizes, or if you're only going to try one size, get Andorra in 30E and/or Envy in 30DD to start. Of course I am not suggesting that you buy every bra all at once! But if you can get one or two styles in a couple of sizes, that'd be a good starting place. Even start with just one style to cut down on expenses."
ABraThatFits,3czmh3,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:40:52 2015 UTC,"Seriously, thanks so much!! This was really super helpful. Last couple of questions before I take the plunge though  Should I just try 30D and DD (instead of 30DD and 30E) because if I use the lying down measurement, it's 30D. Also, I shouldn't take on the bratabase recommendations (http://www.bratabase.com/recommendations/view/902/) ?? It's really confusing!"
ABraThatFits,3czb3c,nonsensedog,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:39:28 2015 UTC,Curvy Kate bras are designed for full on top breasts. You may have luck with Bardot or Jewel in your usual size but they are a tricky fit. I wouldn't have high expectations.
ABraThatFits,3czb3c,noys,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:51:19 2015 UTC,"I had read that, I was just considering whether to try an FF to start with. I did a Bratabase comparison and the F is definitely shallower than most of my current bras. The FF is bigger in other ways.   I've yet to have trouble with closed cups, and I get a pretty good fit (just short of spillage) in my old Parfait Charlotte at 38DD, which is shallower, but I'm not sure that means anything.  So it seems like finding a stockist is going to be easiest, will probably take a day trip to Philly or Baltimore soonish  if I can find one.  I just realized I'd forgotten to set Bratabase profile public, have done so now."
ABraThatFits,3cyabs,leeeenav,7,Sat Jul 11 21:42:15 2015 UTC,"Ewa Michalak uses a hybrid of European and UK sizing. Bands are in cm but she uses double letters. I've heard people typically go up a cup and band size when ordering there. For Comexim there are no double letters and the difference between cups in only 2cm as opposed to one inch. This means that the further along you go in cups sizes the more different they are (you can't just count to the same number). I should wear a 26FF in UK, I wear a 60F in EM (but it's a tad small in the cup) and a 60HH in Comexim (Which is big in the band and a tiny bit big in the cup on my smaller side). I would try some used first to double check where you should be. When in doubt size up in the cup."
ABraThatFits,3cyabs,petitecollegiate,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:00:46 2015 UTC,Well isn't that confusing! Thank you!
ABraThatFits,3cyabs,beccaisane,3,Sat Jul 11 23:23:18 2015 UTC,"It also depends on what cut you're looking at from Ewa. The PL cut is notoriously smaller and you may need to size up. The soft cup bras seem pretty true to size in my experience, though. And the S cup seemed a little on the big side."
ABraThatFits,3cyabs,SmellsLikeDogBuns,3,Sun Jul 12 05:03:34 2015 UTC,I think it is a bit difficult to settle on one Polish size because of the differences between the brands and then the inconsistencies inside each brand themselves (I've seen that complaint particularly with EM). I think it is easiest to ask for sizing advice for one style from one brand and adjust from there. Or you could try wellfitting.com for Comexim until you are comfortable knowing more about what works for you before ordering direct from Poland.
ABraThatFits,3cyabs,senkidala,2,Sat Jul 11 22:51:26 2015 UTC,"Right, I'm sorry, I should've been more specific in my inquiry. I just see so many beautiful bras and get overwhelmed by all the letters and numbers in the names of bras and the sizes! Haha..."
ABraThatFits,3cyabs,senkidala,3,Sat Jul 11 23:22:33 2015 UTC,"Polish bra sizes are pretty confusing! You could be a different size for each Polish brand, or even two sizes within one of them like I have in Avocado. Bratabase and googling reviews have been so helpful in figuring out sizes.        I haven't tried Ewa Michalak before but I've read that a lot of women tend to go up one band and cup volume (so the band number goes up, but you have the same letter). So a 28HH would fit a 65HH in EM. I think it also depends on whether you go for the padded or unpadded EM styles as I've read that their unpadded bras run smaller, hence the sizing up.     Comexim is a bit harder as the cup increments are not the same as UK. Having tried a few Comexim sizes, I would guess a 70N to be like a 32J/JJ, so I would guess you to be about a 60L/M. I would check bratabase though and compare some band and cup depth measurements."
ABraThatFits,3cyabs,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:47:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah! I'm glad I'm not the only one confused by the crazy sizing! For some reason, I'm more drawn to comexim because I remember reading that EM had consistency problems throughout the bras. I unfortunately can't remember where I read this, or if it was just this one person's account of EM but you know."
ABraThatFits,3cyabs,braaccount,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:40:46 2015 UTC,"I've read that too. Even varying between colours within the same style! I've wanted to branch into EM's HM/SM styles but I've seen so many size inconsistencies, I have no idea what size I'd be.     Comexim is definitely a bit more consistent, though I think the lacy ones fit firmer in the band. Like the Geisha was definitely firmer than the same size in Mint Sorbet and Luna. And I've read that the half cups run a bit shallower (like the Joy) in the cup."
ABraThatFits,3cyabs,BlackieChan,2,Mon Jul 13 02:16:16 2015 UTC,"Ewa Michalak uses the British cup sizing progression, while Comexim uses the EU cup sizing progression (replacing I with HH to prevent confusion with it looking like the number 1). So you'll need two different sizes in the two brands for sure. Additionally, each style made by Ewa Michalak runs a little differently due to fabric differences, and Comexim has a couple of styles that are known to run small.  /u/baysilica wears 28H and used to wear 28HH/J, and owns bras from both EM and Comexim. So she can help clarify which styles you would need to size up in!"

ABraThatFits,3cyabs,BlackieChan,2,Sat Jul 11 23:24:25 2015 UTC,"Additionally, Anna Pardal by Comexim uses British sizing, but the usual advice is to size up in band and cup from your normal size."

I have a bra from the S range, I can't comment on the other Ewa ones or Comexim unfortunately. You're right in that Polish sizes are very confusing!"
ABraThatFits,3czum0,MeltingEvergreen,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:43:33 2015 UTC,"Wacoal black bra--I really like that bra and it looks pretty good. I'm wavering about whether you need the 34DD in it. The cups here look borderline on the small side. If, you've tried both, this would come down to personal preference and comfort. Can you raise your arms high and have your breast tissue stay contained? Do you get quadboob when you move around in it? Those would be signs to go up a cup size.  Natori blue bra--Again, I think this is a touch small in the cup, but if you've tried both sizes and know you feel better in this, trust your own instincts as you will be wearing it. I note the trouble you mention with bras staying in the IMF. This looks close anyways and it seems to me that this type of bandless t-shirt bra, which is so common and well-loved, is very hard to get to stay in the IMF. So if you're happy, I'm happy.  Josie pink bra--this one seems to be giving you more room in the cups and looks like the right cup size. I think it fits you better than the blue one and if it were a choice between those two, I'd go for the pink.  Natori Feathers--this one has a lot more wrinkling in the cup and is much too shallow. It doesn't look to be doing as much for your shape, either. I'd say this is not your bra.  Natori Lynx--I think the 34DD is definitely better than the D. The D looks small in the cup. The Lynx is not perfect, but it's a wearable fit. I would return the 34D and think on the 34DD since you're planning to buy more styles.  Chantelle Rive Gauche--I really like this bra on you. It gives excellent coverage and a nice shape. It looks like your left side is a bit smaller than the right? That's probably why you're getting more wrinkling. If you like it and it feels as comfortable as it looks, I think this one is a keeper. I'd say it's my favourite of the lot."
ABraThatFits,3czum0,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:20:15 2015 UTC,"I tried the Wacoal in a 34DD and there was too much wrinkling across the whole cups, especially on my smaller side. Definitely liked the 34D better there.   The Natori blue/green bra I didn't decide to try on thinking I had tried enough Natori and didn't realize how wide set the cups were. It seemed ok but on second thought it might be going back. Lesson learned always try on.    Luckily I haven't bought the Lynx yet, it was very comfortable but I do prefer molded tshirt bras and will probably try some of the other styles that will be in the sale next week. I will have to double check between D/DD on the other styles. There's definitely space between my breast and the wire on the DD since it's such a pronounced curve, hopefully it won't be difficult to judge fit.   The Chantelle fit wonderfully and is so gorgeous! Forgot to try it under a tshirt to test if the lace leaves bumps. It's a pricey bra ($88) so I will definitely wait for the sale on that one! The first one I tried on had gapping at the top of the cup, so I'll have to do more research on the style that fit better. Maybe there's some discount styles on Amazon."

ABraThatFits,3cypuf,confabulatrix,3,Sun Jul 12 06:51:26 2015 UTC,"Most women will increase by at least one cup size when their milk comes in, however everyone is different.  The breast tissue tends to even out and grow less after you get into the 2nd trimester. In our store for nursing bras we usually recommend waiting until after the 2nd week after birth for the milk to regulate and for you as the mother to know how much of a breast volume difference you experience between feeding because that could make a difference in your sizing. If you decide to wait to take your measurements try to take them close to feeding time as that is when your breast tissue is most likely to be at it's largest measurement.  For the upcoming weeks however we recommend getting a band size larger in your current cup size and tart it on the TIGHTEST hook this way as your rib age expands or your breast tissue grows you can loosen up the band to allow for the growth.  Hope this helps!"

ABraThatFits,3cytlc,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:42:59 2015 UTC,"After getting properly measured, I've tied the Curvy Kate ""dreamcatcher"" and the Cleo Lily. I didn't wear either of them for any substantial amount of time because they were too small (ordered 32E). My other department store bras (American 36D) all pinch very much underneath the armpits and thats why i felt like I needed to pull the bands down. They were hurting."
ABraThatFits,3cytlc,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:59:16 2015 UTC,"I think your 36Ds must have been riding up on you. That would be quite large in the band, and then the cups wouldn't fit right either so the wires were probably poking your breast tissue. How did the cups fit on the Lily and Dreamcatcher that you tried?  It sounds like you want a very rounded, slightly minimized shape. Unfortunately that might be at odds with needing a projected bra and no padding. Lily or its replacement Erin might give you the rounded shape (some women get a very round shape from it; others more pointy), but if it fits it will bring your breasts forward.  Anything I can think of to suggest has either lining, spacer foam, or is molded. Fantasie Rebecca might be worth a try. It is a spacer-foam bra and isn't ideal for projected breasts, but it should bring your breasts closer to your torso."

ABraThatFits,3cytlc,MutantToenail,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:33:25 2015 UTC,Unlined Freyas give a more natural shape that is more natural and a little bit pointy. You also maybe might try the Cleo Lily?  Pinchy wires usually means your wires aren't matching your root width. Bands sliding up just means you were in a band size that was too large for you.

At that small of a size she won't need much support so they should work.  Often bralettes will have littler band sizes  that would work for her. Check around in various childrens sections. I know I used to find them when I was  that age. (My ribcage is still only about 24 inches)
ABraThatFits,3cxp1t,petitecollegiate,5,Sat Jul 11 18:44:24 2015 UTC,"I would say that if the only concern is nipping out for modesty reasons, you could look for bralettes/training bras/sports bras that either have a teensy foam cup in them or insert one yourself (you can buy them at most fabric stores).

If she's forced into a bra that she doesn't even want, she's always going to hate it and not want to wear it. Really if she's that tiny, she probably doesn't need one.   If she does, measure her like you did yourself. There are definitely smaller that 30 bras - just not at VS. other comments have already given great brands. She could wear just small bralettes/bandues/camis if she's smaller than an inch difference."
ABraThatFits,3cxp1t,sobok,4,Sun Jul 12 03:05:42 2015 UTC,"My 12-year-old daughter wore padded bralettes for years. If your daughter doesn't need support, just modesty, they work great. Some examples:  From Target  From Justice  From Walmart  She wore these until very recently, and she's in the 28D/DD range (i.e., noticeably more busty than most of her peers). These worked well for her because she didn't need a lot of support, just some modesty and shaping under clothes. The pads in all of those are substantial enough to cover nipples, but don't add a lot of bulk or size. The pads are also removable, which frankly drove me crazy in doing laundry. I thought the Justice bras were the best quality of the three, but my daughter liked the Walmart ones the best.   If your daughter really has and inch or less difference between her underbust and over bust measurements, a full-out fitted bra is probably overkill. If ""modesty reasons"" means she needs some gentle shaping and nipple coverage, then a padded bralette is the way to go."
ABraThatFits,3cxp1t,realspectacular,3,Sun Jul 12 02:30:05 2015 UTC,"I remember reading about the little bra company starting to sell bras at target, maybe these could work? I think they have 28 bands with small cup sizes. If they don't have them in store you could try ordering online."
ABraThatFits,3cxp1t,littleotterpop,2,Sat Jul 11 18:56:28 2015 UTC,"Several years ago, I would have to make do with a girls sized 10-12 bra because when I started wearing bras I was smaller than your daughter around and in the bust. Several years later, I am a 30DD. I am a teen, but I've seen adults smaller around than me."
ABraThatFits,3cxp1t,talesofa30band,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:01:10 2015 UTC,"Seconding other user's comments to consult your daughter as well, in case you haven't yet. My first ""modesty"" bra was a humiliating experience for me, and I'm sure it would have been less so if I wasn't presented with a bra but involved in the process."
ABraThatFits,3cymgq,HideandSeektheDoctor,3,Sat Jul 11 23:33:13 2015 UTC,Check r/braswap or r/ranfomactsofbra  Amazon is also amazing!

ABraThatFits,3cymgq,EmmaInFrance,2,Sun Jul 12 02:38:16 2015 UTC,"I second the suggestion of Amazon, ASOS can be useful too - especially if you look at what's in the sale/outlet section.   You're around the same size as me. I'm even too and have found that the Sculptresse by Panache balconettes work well for me as do Elomi plunges and so far one Elomi balconette. Elomi are likely to be more expensive.  I would suggest that you choose one or two styles and order them in both 38FF and 38G as a starting point. Make sure you look for free shipping and returns! The great thing about ordering over the net is that you have time to try on the bras, take photos (just for your own records or even to post a fit check here if you feel comfortable) and there is no salesperson to make you feel uncomfortable or pressurised."
ABraThatFits,3cymgq,hurrrrrmione,2,Sun Jul 12 09:48:19 2015 UTC,"Hello, just popping back over to say that I found a couple Elomi bras that I absolutely love. I will definitely be buying more of these in the future. Thank you so much for your help!"

The Freya balconettes, like the Gem and Naomi and Bombshell cuts, are pretty projected. Also the Cleo Lily. I really like the Freya Marvel because it has some immediate projection yet holds everything really close to the chest which perhaps you would like.  Do you know about Bratabase? Once you find a bra that fits you can compare other bras to see if they will fit in a similar fashion. Also you can see what other options you have because a lot of companies make multiple bras with the same cut, but they will have different names. Like the Bombshell and the Daydreamer and the Totally Tartan and the Fifi are the same bra, except some of them have a hideous print and some don't."

Marvel's cup width is wider than Jasmine's, which is way too wide, but one of the Bratabase reviews mentions that it's a ""unique fit"" and might work for narrow-rooted people. I'll check those out. My budget is small, but if anything goes on sale I'll check it out. Thanks for helping."
ABraThatFits,3cyjc7,MutantToenail,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:47:08 2015 UTC,"It's a weird bra, honestly, but one of my personal favorites.

This bra seems pretty projected from what I see on bratabase.    I've seen here that horizontal seams are something to stay away from if you're on the shallow side and can't find the measurements, but cup depth is a good thing to look into when scoping out bras."

I felt like it was a perfect hammock for the FoBness."
ABraThatFits,3cyis1,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:58:14 2015 UTC,Thanks for your input! I might have a try sizing down depending on availability and price. The selection of UK brands on Australian websites is sadly limited...
ABraThatFits,3cx95m,foxyillusion,6,Sat Jul 11 16:16:36 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, outside Elomi, Goddess, and Sculptresse you're starting to look at Polish manufacturers and possibly custom sizes--that's going to get pretty expensive with shipping, and if custom-sized it's non-returnable.   When searching by size, beware the US and EU J cups that might come up, as you need the UK J cup, right, and that is several cup sizes larger. You already know that your Goddess size is L or M cup. So if you see something like a Change or Prima Donna bra in 44J, it's EU sized and won't have a large enough cup. I'm sorry that isn't very uplifting (see what I did there? ;) ) but I wanted to give you a heads-up about that."
ABraThatFits,3cx95m,Goddess_Keira,2,Sat Jul 11 19:12:46 2015 UTC,Ahh! That sucks. I had a sneaking suspicion that I was pushing my luck with getting bras that fit and asking for more! I was looking at the Ewa Michalak bras but I'm a little worried about ordering from them. Most of the stuff I heard is a total miss or bad but when the bra is good then it's amazing.  I'm pretty okay with a 42 and 44 in Elomi. Should I still opt for the 46 in Panache?  I loved the uplift joke btw!
ABraThatFits,3cx95m,Goddess_Keira,3,Sat Jul 11 21:15:14 2015 UTC,"If you're wearing 44J in Elomi then the 46HH would be a sister-size, so it might be best to start with that. If you're wearing Elomi 44HH and 42J, then I'd say go for a 44HH but expect it to feel more snug, unless your snug measure is 45"" or more. If that, then I'd start with a 46HH in Panache Sculptresse."
ABraThatFits,3cx95m,EmmaInFrance,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:35:59 2015 UTC,I have 44HH and 42J in Elomi and they feel very close to me in terms of comfort. I only notice a difference because my 42J is Yolanda/Eva and the bandless part is a little more comfortable to me. My snug measure is right at 45 but I think I'm going to go with 46HH just to be safe.
ABraThatFits,3cx95m,SaltyBlackBroad,4,Sun Jul 12 05:05:10 2015 UTC,The Sculptresse by Panache range goes up to HH in both 44 and 46 bands - if you find a 44 band comfortable in Elomi then I think that you would probably prefer a 46 band in Sculptresse as Elomi bands are very generous and I size down in them.
ABraThatFits,3cx41m,tubebewb,8,Sat Jul 11 15:29:20 2015 UTC,"I know you don't want to compromise on the dress style, but in all honesty it's the best way. Although my shape is much different from yours, I speak as somebody who had the same dilemma of dresses I loved not suiting the bra I had to wear. I did compromise on the dress, because I knew in advance that I wanted my bustline to look its best, and that meant fitting my breasts before I chose my dress. So I took my own advice, you see. I wound up with a grand total of two dresses to choose from, and I still loved my dress and how I looked in it almost 33 years later. My advice to brides is to always, always figure out your undergarments before you buy your dress."
ABraThatFits,3cx41m,Goddess_Keira,3,Sat Jul 11 15:57:31 2015 UTC,What about something like this? It would accommodate a lower back while being supportive and would also allow you to add more padding if you need it. It's not a cheap option but it would probably be more functional than a stick-on or wrap around bra.
ABraThatFits,3cx41m,RainingAgain,3,Sat Jul 11 20:51:09 2015 UTC,"I can't say that I have any suggestions since I'm pretty new here and still trying to figure out my own shape myself, but...

(Your bridal boutique may be able to recommend one). Talk to her about if there are alterations that could be done to an existing dress, or if having a dress made is a better (or affordable) option. I've seen some amazing alterations done to wedding dresses; I suspect that making a dress bra friendly, or building some bust structure in, won't be a big deal."

ABraThatFits,3cyl6u,RalphiWalters,2,Sat Jul 11 23:21:20 2015 UTC,"Are you scooping and swooping?  Also, if 30"" is your snug underbust measurement and 28"" is your tight underbust measurement, a 28 band is too tight for you. If all your bust measurements are 33"", then your size should be 30C."

I thought it looked too small. The 30C in the full cup bra (the bottom blue one and top beige one) gapped a lot in the middle of my chest."
ABraThatFits,3cyl6u,Goddess_Keira,3,Sat Jul 11 23:38:09 2015 UTC,"It is easier to assess the fit if you have the angles in the link /u/hurrrrmione provided, but the 30C is definitely too small. The dark-colored 30D in the first set looks borderline--it's a little hard for me to see. The first beige one is too small in cup so the gore lifts off your chest. The lace one looks the best and might be okay if the gore isn't lifting on that one, too.   It will be helpful to see more angles, but it's looking like your size could be 30D or 30DD, depending on the bra--Aerie bras run very shallow in the cup. I think the calculator sized you down to 28 when it shouldn't have."

ABraThatFits,3cxtvh,txce,5,Sat Jul 11 19:16:42 2015 UTC,Can you put your measurements into this post? Did you use our calculator in the sidebar? Both of those things will help us clarify your results.
ABraThatFits,3cxtvh,crazymusicalgenius96,3,Sat Jul 11 19:22:59 2015 UTC,Oh dear I miswrote the title. I meant measured 90 AA.  These are my sizes:  35.6 inch snug underbust  35 inch tight underbust  39.8 inch standing bust  40.9 inch leaning bust  39.3 inch lying bust  If I use the calculator in the sidebar it looks like it makes sense. Why are they so different from the results pretty much every website gave me?
ABraThatFits,3cxtvh,rainydayseveryday,8,Sat Jul 11 19:31:59 2015 UTC,"Other websites will be very inconsistent and many try to keep you within sizes that the store the calculator is on has in their stock.   If it's not a store calculator, or even if it is, then it's probably based off of the +4 inches/5/or more band method which ends up giving you a bra that's too small in the cup but too loose in the band, which gives inadequate support.  Edit: also you seem to be about a 36DD or E which is 80E/F in eu if i'm not mistaken (I might be mistaken)"
ABraThatFits,3cxtvh,j_sunrise,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:00:39 2015 UTC,I will try to find myself a bra size 80dd or e asap because I'm really excited about this!
ABraThatFits,3cxtvh,j_sunrise,3,Sat Jul 11 20:24:27 2015 UTC,"EU sizes don't have DD, so a UK-DD is an EU-E and a UK-E is an EU-F."

ABraThatFits,3cxtvh,j_sunrise,2,Sat Jul 11 21:29:22 2015 UTC,"Really depends on the brand though! But most sell DD, some skip it and go straight to E but they're not exactly the same"
ABraThatFits,3cxtvh,noys,6,Sat Jul 11 21:35:06 2015 UTC,"A lot of other online calculators will add a certain number of inches (4 inches is among the most common) to your underbust measurement and use that as your band size. While some will still calculate your cup size from your actual bust/underbust measurements (giving the right cup volume but on the wrong band), some will calculate your cup volume based on your bust measurement and their value for your band size (thus vastly increasing the odds that you'll end up with too small a cup as well as too loose a band)."
ABraThatFits,3cxtvh,noys,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:01:29 2015 UTC,It's so confusing though! How can they guess what shape boobs someone has? I have difficulty fitting in a cup d how am I supposed to be ok with aa? They should measure the volume due to different breast shapes!
ABraThatFits,3cxtvh,babykittiesyay,4,Sat Jul 11 20:26:28 2015 UTC,"A 90A has about the same volume as a 85B, 80C or 75D. The weird thing about EU sizing is that a 80 band is made for a 90 ribcage."
ABraThatFits,3cy0nx,bipbopbeep,3,Sat Jul 11 20:16:46 2015 UTC,"38GG/H does sound like a good place to start. Try bras in both sizes if you can, and go from there. In general, it will be easier to find bras in UK sizes than US sizes in this size range. Bras are sized based on where the company that manufactures them is located, not on where they are sold. You can tell whether a bra uses UK or US sizes by whether it uses double letters after DD.  In addition to the Cleo Marcie suggested by /u/crazymusicalgenius96, you should try the Panache Floris (which is based on the Marcie but has a 3-hook band and sturdier straps),  Panache Jasmine, and Panache Envy. The latter two are not necessarily full-on-top shapes but are narrow and projected (particularly the Jasmine), and have stretch-lace upper cups that should accommodate your fullness.  If you have a Nordstrom's nearby, you could try looking there, but a lot of us just shop online. Amazon will have all of the bras suggested, and they have free shipping and returns as long as they are the seller. Often, last season's colors will be on sale for 30-50% off."
ABraThatFits,3cy0nx,Shanakitty,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:11:46 2015 UTC,"Ah, that makes so much more sense! I'll keep in mind to have my sizes written for both UK and US sizes then, just in case. Thank you very much for the additional suggestions, I'll also keep those written down when searching for the perfect bra! I think I might wait until Prime day to try ordering some bras from Amazon, hopefully get some great sales."
ABraThatFits,3cy0nx,hurrrrrmione,2,Sat Jul 11 22:03:53 2015 UTC,"Different US bra manufacturers label their cup sizes differently after DD. This means there's no direct equivalent in US sizing to the size the calculator gave you.   So if you're shopping in a store, look at the UK size on tags. If you're shopping online, it should say on the page for specific bras whether it's sold in UK, EU, or US sizing. If it's sold in US sizing, you're going to have to look up what the UK size equivalents are for that brand."
ABraThatFits,3cy0nx,Goddess_Keira,3,Sat Jul 11 23:37:04 2015 UTC,"Okay, so if you're buying from AdditionElle and Reitmans you're in Canada. You might want to check if there are any specialty lingerie shops in your province, though very few of them seem to stock much from the British brands like Panache, Cleo, Sculptresse, Freya, and Fantasie that mostly get suggested here. You can order from The Butterfly Collection on line with free shipping in Canada (though not free returns). If by any chance, you're living in one of the few Canadian cities that has Nordstrom, try there. Otherwise there are loads of on line sites to order from, but there'll be shipping, exchange, and duty to contend with. Amazon.ca  has just started selling intimates but the one time I checked something on there, the price was about double what I paid in store for the same bra."
ABraThatFits,3cy0nx,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:12:52 2015 UTC,"Haha, you're definitely right about being in Canada (though currently on vacation in Cali).

ABraThatFits,3cx0bf,xuenylom,3,Sat Jul 11 14:53:34 2015 UTC,"Since the pictures and descriptions on the website don't make it clear, someone on bratabase who got to try the FB cut out early did mention that they are unpadded bras.   I had been wanting to try out FB just to see if it solved some of the issues that can be found in larger cup sizes (height not scaling well, width, etc.), but looks like it starts at the current top of the size range (34KK and sister sizes), that's not happening.  It seems most of the larger cup sizes have to be special ordered, which while making sense also kind of sucks for those who need those sizes because they'll be non-returnable and if it's not the right size, you're kinda SOL.   Also, HOLY CATS those are expensive. 389.00zÅ at full price - that's over $100. I get that they require far more material than other bras, and took a lot of work to get the design right so that they do work, but still. That's more than double the price of other EM bras."
ABraThatFits,3cx0bf,LadyVerene,3,Sat Jul 11 15:30:45 2015 UTC,I think she aims to corner the market on this one.  Shame that there still isn't a tacking gore on her model.
ABraThatFits,3cxjcn,OverUkKCup,2,Sat Jul 11 17:46:28 2015 UTC,"I imagine your size differences in the bras you've got are due to scaling problems. Curvy Kate bras are pretty shallow in this size range, causing you to need 36KK. Panache Tango is more projected but very tall in the cups (especially at the sides), so 36K is probably the best compromise for you there. And I don't know which Cleos you have, but if it's the swan print Lily or Cleo Meg, I know those run a little big and very projected, which may be why you can get away with 38HH in those."
ABraThatFits,3cxjcn,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Sat Jul 11 19:27:30 2015 UTC,"It's the Meg and Marcie. They're not absolute perfect fits but they fit good enough, are comfortable, and look great."
ABraThatFits,3cxjcn,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:36:59 2015 UTC,"That's good! You may want to try Cleo Erin in 36J, as I've heard that it similarly runs a little large. It doesn't come in 38HH, though, so you'll need to locate an actual 36J.   Ewa Michalak would probably also work well for you - keep an eye on Ebay as that's where I see most listings in your size range. There were two S bras in 36JJ on there up until a couple of hours ago, but they've been purchased."
ABraThatFits,3cxjcn,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:48:14 2015 UTC,Ewa Michalak is really really narrow and I don't think it would work for my wide rooted breasts.
ABraThatFits,3cxjcn,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:05:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think they're probably similar in width to the Cleos you've got. Maybe a little narrower."
ABraThatFits,3cxjcn,LadyVerene,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:28:11 2015 UTC,It looks like they're a full inch narrow. Even my Cleos feel like they can't be any more narrow without being uncomfortable. I'm most comfortable in super wide bras like Goddess and old Curvy Kate.
ABraThatFits,3cxjcn,talesofa30band,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:41:06 2015 UTC,"I see! I didn't realize the difference was that dramatic - in my size range they're only .1-.2 inches narrower than Cleos.   In that case, perhaps Elomi would work for you. They're the brand that caters best to the wide and projected combo, as far as I know. There are only two models that come in 36K, but there are a bunch that come in 38JJ, so if the cup shape works better on one of those 38JJs perhaps you could alter the band down. Elomi is kind of like the younger sister of Goddess (they have the same parent company) so whichever Goddess bras you like best would help determine which Elomi models would be most likely to work."

ABraThatFits,3cxjcn,talesofa30band,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:18:29 2015 UTC,"The calculator yields 36L (with SS of 38KK and 34LL) from plugging in your measurements. I believe around that might work better. I don't really have experience as I'm much smaller but that might explain why you are growing out of so many things. I honestly am not sure how you are wearing those Cleos with such a size difference.  I hope I helped a little, and hopefully a more experienced person can give more info."

The calculator overestimates in larger breasts, especially when they're pendulous and short rooted. I have a Panache Tango in 36K, but in most balconettes I'd need a 38K because 36KKs are rare. It's weird because both my Cleo balconettes are nearly perfect, even though they're way smaller than the size I'd need."
ABraThatFits,3cxjcn,CherryAmesAgain,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:23:18 2015 UTC,Which Cleos are they? Have you measured them? How much does the measurements differ from that of your 36K Tango?   It could be a shape difference that's making them fit even though they should be far too small.
ABraThatFits,3cyewx,eyelise,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:23:09 2015 UTC,"For projected moulded bras, the only UK ones I can think of are Curvy Kate Love Struck and Roxie. Both have quite a bit of immediate projection. I can't wear the Deco without major orange in a glass but I can wear those. I'm currently in a major love affair with Comexim as they're the first moulded plunge to really fit my narrow/projected/FoB shape. If you want to try with that sizing is probably your biggest issue as their sizes are quite different from the UK. You're probably looking at 65J there. A lot of people find a 65 band to be perfect for in between 28 and 30 so it could be a good option. I'd check out the listings here and on bratabase to see what you can find. They definitely make the comfiest bras I've ever put on my body"
ABraThatFits,3cyewx,petitecollegiate,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:08:20 2015 UTC,"I absolutely disagree, Roxie/Love Struck cut has less immediate projection than Freya Deco, Parfait by Affinitas Casey/Jeanie or any of the Masquerade/Panache Black molded bras."
ABraThatFits,3cyewx,noys,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:57:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you for sharing your experience! It's always interesting to see how many different views there are. It could be a size range thing. I've tried various Decos and they've all been unwearably shallow for me.  I can wear Roxie and Love Struck in that size. Maybe it's an anomaly, but in mine there's clearly more projection and space in the bottom of the cup near the gore in those. Deco cups in 28f are practically flat. Maybe they just don't size down well."

ABraThatFits,3cyewx,noys,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:12:53 2015 UTC,"Polish is absolutely your best bet but you could try to find Masquerade Capella in 30F as it runs big in cup. Set up eBay searches on both UK and US eBays.  I'd suggest trying both Basic options on Wellfitting - plunge and demi. You definitely need to size up in the plunge, not sure about the demi. They have EU sizing with HH instead of I so you'd need 30HH for the plunge."

ABraThatFits,3cybow,Upupandawayyyyyyy,2,Sat Jul 11 21:54:29 2015 UTC,"Getting slightly different measurements each time you measure is normal. Some women's breasts also fluctuate in size throughout the month due to their hormone cycle, so it's possible your breasts were actually bigger the first time you measured versus the second time you measured.  Bras come in all sorts of different cuts and shapes. Since breasts also come in all sorts of different shapes, that means some bras won't be the right shape for your breasts even if they are the same size you're measuring at. Sometimes you just need to get a slightly different size of a bra in order for it to fit right. Sometimes a bra is just not right for your breasts no matter what size you try. So it's possible the 30E you tried was just the wrong shape. (Although it's also possible it was the wrong size, and it could have even been both the wrong shape and the wrong size.)   Are you scooping and swooping?"
ABraThatFits,3cybow,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:35:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response! I am swooping and scooping.  What makes me skeptical is that we tried so many different types of bras and only three satisfied me. If I were actually a 30D, then there should have been more bras that were comfortable than just the three?"
ABraThatFits,3cybow,hurrrrrmione,2,Sun Jul 12 01:59:42 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. Many people on here have to try on tens of bras before they find one that is a good fit.   The two bras you posted pictures of are what's called molded cup bras. Did you try on any bras that weren't molded cups (non-molded cups will not keep their shape when they're not being worn)?
ABraThatFits,3cybow,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:02:26 2015 UTC,"Yes I tried some non molded cup bras, from what I remember we had to play around with them because of wrinkling, I also found they made my boobs extra pointy which was unflattering with a t-shirt on. But that may just be me being nitpicky lol.   After reading the swooping and scooping link you posted, it does seem that my bra wants to pull downward, as showcased in this link. When I swoop and scoop and adjust the bra to sit right at the root, it seems to fit nicely, but pulls down throughout the day, thus I need to keep readjusting so that it sits at the root again."
ABraThatFits,3cybow,hurrrrrmione,2,Sun Jul 12 02:11:17 2015 UTC,"It can take awhile to get used to how your breasts look in unlined and seamed cups if you're used to wearing molded cups. But some bras will give more of a pointy shape than others, and you can usually get a rounded shape in unlined and seamed cups in the right fit.  Sliding down out of the root of your breast probably means the bra  isn't projected enough. A bigger cup size will have more projection on average.   Could you try the Fit Fully Yours bra on upside-down and backwards and let me know if the band feels looser that way?"
ABraThatFits,3cybow,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:32:19 2015 UTC,"Do you have any suggestions of unlined cups that have a more rounded shape? Because some of the unlined ones were definitely more comfortable than others, and seemed easier to ""troubleshoot"" so to speak than the lined ones.   It seems to feel nice when its upside-down and backwards. A good tightness that feels like it wont be going anywhere."
ABraThatFits,3cybow,Kradchand,2,Sun Jul 12 02:41:17 2015 UTC,"Check out the shape guide and let me know what shape you think your breasts are, and I'll see if I can help you with recommendations.   That's how the band is supposed to feel. :D So this means that a 30 band is a good fit for you, but at least in that bra a D cup is too small, which makes sense with your measurements. The band felt tight when you had the bra on normally because your breast tissue was getting in the way of the band because there wasn't enough room for it in the cups."
ABraThatFits,3cybow,MutantToenail,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:47:07 2015 UTC,"They are narrow rooted, projected, full on bottom I'd say.  I'd also describe them as pendulous breasts, which is likely due to having a kid and breastfeeding.  This is good! I feel like I'm getting somewhere. Do you think that it would be wise to try a 30DD and see if that fits me better? I don't remember trying that at the lingerie store. She only had me try 30E, 30D and I believe 28C."
ABraThatFits,3cwvfj,mick_mouse,5,Sat Jul 11 14:01:10 2015 UTC,"Tessa is such a pretty bra, and it looks great on you!  (also I totally need to try that one now because damn it's beautiful)  The way Edie fits you is similar to how Jocelyn looks on me; it's a more natural shape. Though for me it's at least partially because the band on my Jocelyn is too big, so I would suggest possibly sister-sizing down when you try that one; mine's a 36 band that measured nearly 38 inches when I first got it. Same with Betty; bratabase searching shows that 38s tend to run loose.   Envy is very similar to Jasmine so it may or may not work for you, since Jasmine was all sorts of off. I have both of them. I personally find that Envy is a bit higher on the sides (which may be a dealbreaker for you), and has slightly wider wires and gore. Jasmine on the other hand wants a bit more upper fullness; the only time I can completely fill out the top is when I'm on my period (and then I actually quad out of it because wtf). I don't have trouble with filling out the top of Envy and it gives me a more rounded shape than Jasmine does.   As far as the Fantasie 4520 goes - it's likely just the shape of that particular bra that is causing it to not work for you. It looks like it wants more volume on top than you have.   I am going to recommend that you try Elomi Etta. Since you're having trouble with wires poking you in the armpits, and you seem to have a similar shape to mine, I think it may work well for you. It's meant for petite women, or women with a shorter chest, so it has lower sides and a lower gore. It's got a tighter band than most Elomi bras, so stick with a 38 there for sure. It also has narrower wires. I personally find the gore low enough on it that I can wear it under v-necks without my bra showing, though obviously that depends on the shirt as well.  (It's my favorite and best-fitting bra.)  Elomi Rita is also another possibility, as that one, if I remember correctly, is also meant to be for more petite women. It is much more high-coverage on the chest, though. If you try Jocelyn and like it, Lexi will also work for you.   Perhaps retry Jasmine one size cup down? It's a very deep bra, so it may be shape, or it may be size, and that would help figure out which is which.   Oh! And I meant to mention but forgot. Having one breast be larger than the other is 100% normal. Tightening the strap on the smaller side a bit helps a lot with that."
ABraThatFits,3cwvfj,LadyVerene,2,Sat Jul 11 15:12:00 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I was half-joking about short-torso-sized bras, but hells yes, Etta & Rita are totally going to be in my next order. Thank you for the detailed recommendations - this makes it a lot easier to figure out which ones to try out rather than blindly choosing which ones are pretty! I really appreciate this."
ABraThatFits,3cwvfj,LadyVerene,3,Sun Jul 12 00:05:17 2015 UTC,"You're welcome!  And hey, if you're having trouble with wires being too high, there are bras designed specifically to be lower-cut. Etta in particular is probably my favorite bra I own! You also appear to have a similar shape to me, judging by the pictures, so yeah, have to recommend it :)"
ABraThatFits,3cwvfj,Goddess_Keira,2,Sun Jul 12 03:50:39 2015 UTC,"I love the Tessa on you and I'm so glad it worked out. Beautiful bra, and you look fantastic in it! I agree about the shape of Edie, though that is a lovely bra too and very pretty on.  I rather like the Bijou! It's close. I think that for those of us who have just a very slight asymmetry, it can only show up in bras that fit a certain way, and it could be that Bijou is hitting that spot for you. There could also be a slight anomaly in the cup size or shape; it happens. A note about the Freya Deco: It doesn't have that much bottom fullness (more top fullness)--I'm thinking honestly that for a molded plunge, it will not be as good a fit as Bijou. However, it would be interesting to see the comparison.  That size in the Fantasie was better, but it's not the best bra for you and you can do better. The Elomi Smoothing, if it fits you, is a similar kind of bra so should work for that type of use. It is full coverage though. You might try Elomi Amelia as well--it's a spacer-foam bra with some lace trim up the sides, but it's smooth in front. Also for a plain(ish) bra, try my namesake Goddess Keira. Goddess is a sister brand to Elomi, but you have to convert to US sizes. I'm thinking you'd wear a 38G in that bra (= 38F UK) based on the fit of Tessa. Etta is a good rec from /u/LadyVerene, and Elomi's reliable Caitlyn is pretty sure to fit you in 38F. I'm interested to see Betty and Envy on you as well.  The hardest thing is to get something that gives adequate coverage and support, but still allows for a lower neckline. Tessa seemed okay with the V-neck you had on; it just barely peeked out from the side view. The same/similar cut with a less-embellished cup in a skin tone might work."
ABraThatFits,3cwvfj,Goddess_Keira,2,Sat Jul 11 15:46:34 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely in need of a seamless bra, so I'll check out the smoothing as well as the Amelia and your namesake ;)   I'll have to check out a few more plunges or ones that don't come up quite as high because I own a lot of v-necks.  Thank you again for all your recommendations! Truly, I used to haaaaaate bra shopping, but I have to admit that it's been pretty interesting learning about proper size and shape and all that good stuff."
ABraThatFits,3cwvfj,t_maia,2,Sun Jul 12 00:02:28 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! I should clarify that the Keira isn't seamless, it just has flat seams and no decoration except for a mesh panel up top."

ABraThatFits,3cxckb,Goddess_Keira,4,Sun Jul 12 02:41:25 2015 UTC,"Oh dear, I wanted to suggest my namesake bra Goddess Keira because it was made in a dark brown colour, but it only goes down to a 34 band size so it's out. Lately I have noticed more and more bras coming out in beautiful brown shades, but your small band size is your nemesis. I'm pretty sure Chantelle makes some styles in brown shades down to a 30 band. You would have to adjust the cup size because it's in EU sizing; you'd probably want a G-H cup if you try them. Another option might be Polish bras; Ewa Michalak or Comexim might have something in a dark brown. Comexim has Irish Coffee, but sadly it doesn't work as a nude brown because it's got cream-coloured lace all over it.  I think, though, that manufacturers are starting to become aware of this and hopefully soon we'll be seeing more brown shades. If your skin tone doesn't have yellow undertones, a wine colour like this might work pretty well as a nude for you (though not that bra; I just linked it for the colour). Panache Envy's dark purple Cassis shade, now discontinued but possibly still available in your size, might work as well."
ABraThatFits,3cxckb,Goddess_Keira,2,Sat Jul 11 17:05:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the helpful post! Yeah, the small band size is almost the hardest part in my 'brown bra search'. I'll look further into Chantelle, Ewa Michalak and Comexim. I already have a Chantelle bra that fits great, so at least I know that if they had one, it would probably fit well. I also never thought about trying a wine color. I have more dark caramel skin that has a bit of yellow undertone though, so I'm not 100% sure that will work. I'll look into it nevertheless.  It's slowly starting to become more of a known issue though, and hopefully soon manufacturers like Freya, Wacoal, Panache, and the like will start to make more bras for people like me! :)"
ABraThatFits,3cxckb,noys,2,Sat Jul 11 17:12:12 2015 UTC,"If memory serves me, I think the Chantelle Pont Neuf had a brown shade but this was last season--it may still be around. And have a look at old colours in the Rive Gauche full cup, if you can find them. I wish the full-bust companies in general would make more basic shades in different fits, and less of the bright fashion prints and embellishments that are oh-so-pretty but wait! they're not outerwear!. We need some bras that won't show through our clothes! But I guess there's no fun in that. :("

ABraThatFits,3cxckb,Prettyncharmuese,2,Sun Jul 12 03:07:00 2015 UTC,I think there are a few posts from people who have dyed bras. You could probably find those posts.

ABraThatFits,3cxckb,tealeaf_egg,2,Sun Jul 12 03:23:14 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think it would change the shape. I dyed a bunch of bras and they fit the same afterwards. With black bras I think the issue is that they have less stretch, possibly because of the mordants involved with dyeing."

What will make it tricky is if there are 2 or more different fabrics in the bra (eg a polyester section and a nylon section, or poly lace).  Most dyes will only work on one type of fabric, so you may find that the main part of your bra ends up brown but the lace is cream.  If You could find a bra that only has one type of fabric in it and buy the appropriate dye for that fabric you should be good to go :)"

Paging/u/crazymusicalgenius96 to the thread; she is very familiar with all the Freya half-cups. They don't have the push-up but they are lined (except for the new Starlet half-cup which I think has some lining on the bottom but is lacy openwork up top. Starlet is a beautiful bra. :)"

ABraThatFits,3cx7kg,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:26:43 2015 UTC,"It might actually be a single layer of mesh, I don't quite remember. It's definitely sheer.

ABraThatFits,3cx7kg,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:01:08 2015 UTC,"I've figured out that the key to hiding seams is to wear things that are dark and have a busy pattern or thick, textured fabric. I have several shirts with these busy painted applique designs all over the front and they're form-fitting, so it actually hides the seams better than something looser.   The Starlet was too small because I tried it on in 30DD - not my usual cup volume. It immediately became apparent that my left boob needed the larger volume that I typically wear (28F/30E) because I was quadboobing even before swoop and scoop. I imagine in my usual size it would have been a perfect fit, as I tried Fantasie Allegra in 30E and it fit much better."

Unfortunately it doesn't work for me nearly as well as it seems to work for you.   I also own a couple of the other Freya half cup models, and I've found that they are not very similar in shape to the Deco Half Cup. The Deco Half Cup is the widest bra I own, but it's also got a decent amount of projection and demands some upper fullness (which leads me to think that you're probably closer to even with short roots). The other Freya half cups also all have seams and are very colorful, though it's not as hard to hide them as you'd expect! I wear my seamed bras six days a week, with the Deco making an appearance once a week on Friday or Saturday. That's really why I bought the Deco Half Cup - to wear under my light-colored, tight-fitting tops and dresses.   In short, I'm not really sure what other bras exist that are similar to the Deco Half Cup. Both cuts of Freya half cups might be worth trying, and I think you'd like the Freya Lauren better than the Freya Patsy, but they are both seamed."
ABraThatFits,3ctg0v,xaerorazor,22,Fri Jul 10 17:10:55 2015 UTC,"You probably do have very shallow breasts; that's common in gynecomastia. This throws the calculator for a loop. There's an excellent guide written for trans folks that would also be applicable. I still don't know why ABTF hasn't put this in the sidebar or at least clearly linked in the FAQ yet.  I'd seriously recommend checking out sports bras. Because of your shallow tissue, a good non-cup-sized compression sports bra will probably fit just fine. Target's Champion C9 ""medium support"" sports bras are perfect for this.. you are probably either an XL or XXL in their sizing depending on how tight you prefer. (The ""high support"" ones are too projected for you, you definitely want the ones labelled ""medium support"".)  Another nice thing about using these generic sized sports bras is that you can change size a good bit without having to constantly rebuy bras. This doesn't work for folks who are more projected, have more pendulous tissue, etc.. but the big challenge in fitting your body and breast shape is getting something shallow enough and compression sports bras are great at not demanding a certain minimum projection to work."
ABraThatFits,3ctg0v,thaeli,12,Fri Jul 10 18:05:29 2015 UTC,"I think the issue is last we heard, it was still being worked on, the link you gave was asking for more feed back, and was not a completed guide. That was my impression at least and why I haven't added it. At this point though, I guess it really hasn't been worked on in a long time and the info there is good, even if some stuff is missing, I've added it to the trans part of the FAQ."
ABraThatFits,3ctg0v,CatenaryFairy,5,Fri Jul 10 18:59:50 2015 UTC,"Really shallow breasts would not be uncommon for guys, and I think the calculator usually overestimates for men as well.  It looks like the 42C is not capturing tissue at your armpits, so you do want to be looking for a bigger cup to try to get all of that into a cup. Someone with more experience could tell you which size you would actually want to try."
ABraThatFits,3ctg0v,Goddess_Keira,3,Fri Jul 10 18:12:24 2015 UTC,"I'll have to see about getting a fitting shortly.   I'm still coming to terms about wearing a bra full time, and have yet to tell my wife that I need to wear one, I've been trying to ease the idea into conversation. She understands, but doesn't quite expect, that my breasts will grow further."
ABraThatFits,3ctg0v,Goddess_Keira,7,Fri Jul 10 20:30:05 2015 UTC,"I would think that your breasts must be quite shallow, and it will not be easy to get an underwire that fits just right for your torso. I think the calculator can't really take into account your particular fitting challenges and it's overestimating quite a bit in cup size. Of course if you do have further breast growth, the picture changes, but you work with what's happening now, of course.   I'll second /u/thaeli's suggestion of the C9 sports bra. I also wonder if something like this Cacique style might work for you. It's a step up from a compression sports bra but comes in neutrals and is fairly inconspicuous (if that matters) and seems like it could fit your shape well. You might try a range of sizes: 42C, 42D, and 44C. Although you want support, you don't have much projection so you won't need a super tight band and your tight measurement is probably not too relevant for you, at least not just now.  I also wonder if minimizer bras would work for you? Usually we don't recommend them, but the wide, shallow shape of minimizers could fit your needs well. So maybe something like this? I'm thinking 42D-44C is probably your size right now, although the 42C you have on doesn't look bad, just that the wires are a bit narrow in that size and probably resting on breast tissue, which can be uncomfortable. If you don't mind sharing, what make and model is that bra?"

I don't think it will be impossible to find a underwire to fit your torso, and you may find you want or need the support of a underwire bra. This of course will be up to you, depending on your preferences and needs. The Cacique bra and the C9 sports bra are very good starting points, and excellent suggestions. I also would suggest this bali bra. I have very good experiences with this bra and works well on shallow and wide set breasts. The other suggestion would be something like this Leading Lady Bra. This bra works well on shallow breasts, because conforms/contours around your tissue. I hope this helps you. Also don't be afraid to post/ask questions, we are a very welcoming community and try to help everyone. I pretty sure, with enough patience, we can find something that works for you."
ABraThatFits,3ctg0v,curvygg,2,Sat Jul 11 12:04:55 2015 UTC,"I have dealt with gynecomastia most of my life.  It was a little different for me. My gynecomastia is on the extremely severe side of things.  I started wearing a bra when I was 13 and started wearing one full time by the time I was 14. I started out with my sisters hand me downs.  From there, I was just sorta guessing at my size.  About 10 years ago, I went for a professional fitting. I walked in wearing a 42B and walked out of the boutique wearing a 38D! I have grown more since then.  I recently lost 35 pounds hoping to lose some breast size. I was wearing a 38F. I ended up going down to a 36 in my band size and up to a G in my cup size. I've been wearing a bra for almost 30 years now. The truth is that I really don't mind wearing a bra! Now that I know what fits and what doesn't, I am much more comfortable wearing one.  Most places I've shopped at have been very understanding and accommodating. Having breasts, like mine can be both a blessing and a curse depending on how you look at it. Of all of the different health issues I can have as a man, having breasts and wearing a bra is not all that bad.   Depending on your age, you may experience more growth. I had a lot of growth over the last ten years.  ."
ABraThatFits,3cv4y8,59204,2,Sat Jul 11 01:00:32 2015 UTC,"Hi! The Natori bra looks pretty good on. I see what you mean by extra space in the cups, but this may be about as  close as you can get in a non-wired bra. I don't know how to explain the riding-up on you, though. It looks like a good fit in the band. The back is not riding up on you. It's very common to see some wrinkling in a bra band just because it's not a second skin after all, and that elastic looks heavier than most, which could be contributing to the wrinkling.   The bralette looks fine on, but if your breasts are moving around in it then it isn't giving much support. Well, that's pretty typical of bralettes in general. It's probably fine for lounging and brief outings so long as you're comfy in it. It's probably not what you want to wear for an 8-hour day at work or on the go.  Recently I've seen something called a TomGirl bra linked here. It's wireless with an adjustable back. I don't have a link, but maybe somebody else will come along who knows it or you could Google it.  Also, a British company called Royce Lingerie makes exclusively wireless bras in lovely styles. Assuming you're in the U.S. shipping is expensive, but depending on where you live, you may be able to find a stockist as there are some in the States and you can look on their website."

It looks like there's something wrong with the fit of the first bra but I'm having trouble telling from the angle. Can you look in person and confirm if this is what's going on?  1) It seems like the upper edge of the bra is cutting into the top of your breasts.  2) It seems like the wires are sitting too low, not in your inframammary where they belong. I think I see empty space in the bottom of the cup.  If this is the case, I think this bra is too shallow for you or too small, especially at the bottom. Your breasts are pushing the bra down seeking more space."
ABraThatFits,3cvo6y,syrashiraz,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:38:10 2015 UTC,"Well it's weird because the bra that I didn't photograph almost seemed to have too wide off cups, like they extended to my armpits.

ABraThatFits,3cvo6y,hurrrrrmione,6,Sat Jul 11 05:58:35 2015 UTC,"Sometimes if the cup of the bra is too small or too shallow, even if you scoop and swoop some of your breast tissue will be in the band instead of in the cups. The band can then feel too tight even if it's the right size (or even if it's too large a band, though that's not going to be the case for you). Trying on the bra upside-down and backwards allows you to test if the band is a good size no matter if the cups are the right size.  Since your snug and tight underbust measurements are the same, you might need stretchy 32 bands or even 34 bands, but since these cups are too small or too shallow for you, trying the bras on upside-down and backwards might make a difference in how the band feels."
ABraThatFits,3cvo6y,satin43,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:07:23 2015 UTC,"Ok I tried them on like that. They didn't feel as tight, but it's hard to tell if it's still comfortable, idk.

ABraThatFits,3cvo6y,noys,3,Sat Jul 11 06:15:55 2015 UTC,That's fine. The most important thing is that you're comfortable and happy with how the bras fit. Most Freya bras have stretchy bands - maybe you'd like 32 bands in Freya bras. Try some 34DD and 34DDD/E bras as well.

They have a number of styles that are near-identical to Deco (like Delight) but the fit might change slightly on these so it's an option if Deco's cups are a bit large.  physical store locations will often have a pretty good selection of deco sizes so that's an option for you if you want to try one on."

Since you are on the smaller end of a 32 band, I would go with a 70 band for Comexim. 70L should be approximately equivalent to 32HH. Avoid the Basic, as it tends to run a bit shallower and small in the cup compared to other plunges. Also, Comexim's wires are a bit too soft in this size range (gore may not tack), so you may prefer Ewa Michalak. With Ewa, I would start with a 70HH for unpadded and 70J for padded, and see how that goes. I need to size up 2 cup sizes in padded Ewa, but some people keep their normal size, so sizing up once is probably a good place to start."

Curvy Kate might be your friend as those cups (especially in moulded styles) are very wide and shallow. Freya Deco might also work. I've found it to run small and shallow.   In the UK you should be able to find places to try things on in your size. Maybe Bravissimo? Otherwise you can do what many of us do and order from Amazon with free shipping and returns."
ABraThatFits,3cu7rp,petitecollegiate,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:54:33 2015 UTC,"Ahhh I should have probably mentioned my price range... TLBC would be just about affordable if it wasn't for the nearly $50 shipping cost to Europe. And yeah Bravissimo seem amazing - I've been keeping an eye out but their 28D range is really limited at the moment.  I will definitely try the others though, thank you so much for your help! I must admit buying something from 'Curvy Kate' would feel a little bit ironic but I'll do some research, and check out Amazon too. :) Thanks again."
ABraThatFits,3cu7rp,petitecollegiate,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:08:40 2015 UTC,I really really hate their name. I feel like it sounds like a plus-sized only company so at 95lbs I was sort of biased against them. They don't work well for me at all (I'm quite projected) but if you're shallower it could be a good fit. Tutti Rouge has lots of shallower bras but they're hard to get in the States so I've never tried.

ABraThatFits,3cu7rp,vonlowe,3,Fri Jul 10 22:15:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, as far as I know you can only get 26 bands from 3 manufacturers, 2 of which only do 26 bands as custom orders. So you'll have a lot more luck looking for 28 bands.  I wouldn't recommend you go up to a 30 band unless it's one that fits more like a 28 band, since your bust measurement is around 30"".   I think 28D is the best place to start, but you could also try The Little Bra Company if you're interested in trying 28C. Their bras run a band size and a cup size small, so you'd want to order 30C for the bra to fit like a 28C.   Check out this list for bras and brands that are good for shallow breasts."

I saw many bras on sale for under $30. Also, once you find a style or brand you like, you can search eBay for your size and get great prices.  If you really want to try before you buy, because you aren't comfortable with ordering and then returning, then check the ""where to buy"" guide in the wiki that has a list clicking to brick and mortar stores OR go to the elomi website and click ""find a store"", this will take you to brick and mortar stores for you area that carry that brand, but you won't have as good of luck with sale prices (also don't let them measure you, just be upfront that you are not buying that day and are only there to try on styles XYZ in your measured sizes here)."
ABraThatFits,3ct3nm,eveningtrain,2,Fri Jul 10 19:37:11 2015 UTC,"eBay is your friend! I'm a 40 F/FF/G and I love Elomi, but only the plunge bras. I'm short and the full cup Elomi bras swallow me hole. The wires in the gore are way to high and wind up hitting me over the neckline of my clothes and up into my armpits from the sides. So, FYI, if you're a shortie too.    If you were to buy 4 Elomis on eBay it would set you back no more than $80, including shipping. Follow Elomi religiously on eBay and you can score bras under $12. Bratabase is another place to look. A lot of sellers will sell bras for rock bottom prices just to help others out.   My Elomi favorites are the Betty and Madison (both underwire & not current styles in stores).    A super supportive ""grandma"" bra is the Elila (soft cup).  Great support, but I never wear it because of the grandma look.   Another brand I like is Chantell. I have the C-Chic (full cup, underwire) and the C Magnifique (full cup, underwire, minimizer). The C-Chic is a see through cup. The C Magnifique has super, super soft cups.   One last thing. If you go the eBay route and like full cup bras, Modern Movement is a brand sold at Dillards and I can vouch the underwire bras are supportive and nice. They are super cheap on eBay as well.  You can go broke ordering new bras or you can space a few out at a time through eBay and see what you like. I chose the eBay route because 1) I want to try EVERYTHING everyone recommends and 2) I'm a cheapskate and just won't pay $68+ for a bra.  Finally, good luck!"

The calculator does overestimate in this size range, and most people find that the lying measurement tends to be more accurate, which would put you at 40H/38HH as possible sizes to start off with. I wouldn't go up to a 42 band; larger bands tend to run stretchier than in smaller sizes and so most women take a tighter band to get the support they need.   The fact that your current 38s and 40s are so loose points at not wanting to go higher than a 40 in band as well, though that could also be because of the age of the bras - if they're older or have been worn a lot, they could have lost some of their firmness in the band.   What are the current bras you're wearing in 38G and 40G? What kind of fit issues are you having with them? And have you looked at the section about breast shape in the beginner's guide? Size is only part of it, after all; shape is just as important. I don't want to recommend something with narrow wires that's ideal for full-on-top shapes, for example, if you need wide wires and full-on-bottom."

ABraThatFits,3ct3nm,foxyillusion,4,Fri Jul 10 16:23:52 2015 UTC,"If you are wearing a Goddess bra in 38/40 G, then that is a US G and the calculator gives UK cup size, so your Goddess G cup is the equivalent of a UK F cup--several cup volumes smaller than what you need.   I agree that you most likely won't need a 42 band. I'd say start with a 40 or a mix of 38 and 40 bands but in UK cup size 38HH/40H to start out with. Elomi is a good brand to try. It is the sister brand to Goddess but in UK sizes and with more fashionable choices--they have many pretty styles. Which Goddess bra style are you wearing? They have some nice bras as well--here's Goddess Kayla in the newest print--it's full coverage but very pretty IMO, and over the seasons it's come in several different prints and colour combinations. Your Goddess size (for starters, until you get a better idea of what's fitting you) would be 38L or 40K.  Sculptresse by Panache would also be a line of bras worth trying out, as it's a full-figure, full-bust line. Their bands tend to run tighter than Elomi and Goddess so you'd probably want to start with 40 bands from them. They're in UK sizes."
ABraThatFits,3ctwp9,ISOabtf,3,Fri Jul 10 19:11:33 2015 UTC,"This bra actually wasn't too much of a mis-step, as I think you can learn some valuable things from it.   I'm pretty sure it's too big, or at least too tall for your breasts. You seem to have short roots, which is why you had so much gaping even in bras that were too small. (Those other bras were all definitely too small! The tissue you had hanging out on the sides was most likely due to the orange-in-a-glass phenomenon.) You need a bra that's shorter and more closed on top than this half cup style.  However, the cup depth seems to be working out pretty well for you. Cleo Darcy in 30GG has a decent amount of projection, though the wires do seem too wide.   So you need a bra that's going to allow your breasts to project out this far while being a little narrower and shorter. A short, narrow, projected bra in 30G (or possibly 30GG, though the wires might end up being too wide) would be ideal. I think Lily in 30G would end up being too narrow still, but Lucy may not have enough projection. Perhaps something like Ewa Michalak CHP would work. It's a half cup, but it's very projected, and the cups might be short enough that it wouldn't gape. I imagine it would have a better chance of working in 65G and sister sizes than 65GG. Take a look on Bratabase and /r/braswap and see if you can find one; Ebay doesn't have anything in your size at the moment. You should probably ask for the stretched band measurement prior to purchasing, though, as the bands vary quite a bit in stretchiness. 60GG or 70FF could end up working better."

For me, Freya Deco has been completely unworkable because of the shallow cups and stretchy band. Freya in general runs stretchy/large in the band so you might be better off with Cleo which tends to run small. Cleo Lucy or Lily could be a good fit for you. The general consensus on strapless bras is that they all suck, so don't feel bad about that one. If you like Hopscotch, all of the Freya longlines are cut pretty much the same. If you want a little more projection, their plunges might work for you. Freya plunges in general tend to be quite projected and narrow wired around our size. If you want a standard, pretty, moulded bra, I like Curvy Kate Roxie. The band on that is tighter and the cups are less shallow. In terms of fit, neither of them looks awful really. The Deco Strapless looks like it might be a tad small in the cups, but I'm not sure if strapless bras ever tack. Do the wires on that one sit in your IMF? It's hard to tell with black bras."

Going by the scaling up from DD method, I would be an I or J. Is this accurate?   Different US bra brands label their cup sizes differently after DD. So there is no direct equivalent. This is one of the reasons the calculator and this sub use UK sizing, which is consistent.  The other reason we use UK sizing is UK brands come in more band sizes and a much larger cup size range than US brands. I only know of 3 brands that use US sizing that carry the equivalent of a UK G, and none of them carry 30 bands. So you're going to want to be looking at UK brands anyways.   Check the offline retailer list for stores in your area that carry your size. Nordstrom should have a good selection in this size range if there's one near you.

If you give us the 5 measurements you put into the calculator, we can double-check that it gave you a good estimate.  EDIT: Oh, hi again! I still think you'd best fit into a 30FF or a 30G. That's the sister size of 32F and 32FF, respectively, so it makes sense that the 32DDDD/F bras fit you best out of what you tried. Nordstrom does carry 30FF and 30G, I really do think you should try on some bras in those sizes. (this is all UK sizing, btw)  Many bra fitters do not measure correctly and/or try to fit people into sizes their store carries instead of just being honest and telling you they don't carry your size. Victoria's Secret is almost always guilty of this. Sometimes Nordstrom fitters are good, sometimes they aren't.   Bras come in all sorts of different cuts and shapes and fits, and so different bras will fit your breasts differently! Sometimes a bra is just the wrong shape for your breasts. Sometimes a slightly different size will fit you better.

Even when trying it on upside down and backwards, having cups that are 3 or 4 sizes too small could make a difference with band fit. The good thing is that lots of brands come in 30s nowadays.  For the Natori Feathers Contour Plunge, you would want to try it in 30H (they are American sized, so that equals a UK 30FF, the lower of your two measured sizes).

ABraThatFits,3cr4nn,Julez22,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:48:31 2015 UTC,"I think you should try Juna and Deco strapless and maybe plunge (I love the strapless and am even fullness, but the plunge gapes a bit on me...not sure if I should be an example though) but maybe not Maddie then. Definitely check out the shallow recs if you haven't yet. Even though you might not be super shallow, having a smallish cupsize makes these a good place to start at least!"
ABraThatFits,3cr4nn,amnes1ac,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:18:49 2015 UTC,The deco strapless fits great on me as well and the plunge gapes at the top.

I'll admit, I was intrigued by the Deco Strapless Longline, I haven't worn a strapless bra in ages and my posture/kyphosis might look a good deal better in a strapless dress with a well-fit strapless bra!"
ABraThatFits,3cr9rw,gorgen_kally,6,Fri Jul 10 03:25:50 2015 UTC,"40DD/E or 38E/F is a good place to start. Speaking as someone who has been in a 38 band in the past (I lost weight this year and sized down) and knowing what band size you're wearing now, I'd recommend not getting too hung up on finding 40 bands. There are a ton of bras out there that stop at size 38, which you probably already know if you were looking for 40Bs, so your choices are going to be limited. You're between sizes, you're already wearing a 38, and a lot of 38 bands are really stretchy to begin with. For example I have a bunch of 38Ds in a box in my attic that I bought really cheaply from Amazon and the band stretches to 42""; needless to say I didn't find those very nice to wear when I was looking for a snug 38"", but when your tight underbust is 38"", a band that stretches like that would be perfect.   When you say the bust is fine on your current bras, what happens when you scoop and swoop? You're gonna be looking for a 38F and you're wearing a 38B right now; that's a pretty big jump in cup size, so we want to figure out why the 38B appears to fit your bust and yet you measure so much bigger than that.   If you scoop and swoop and suddenly you're hanging out of the top and sides of the bra, that tells us that you do need a bigger cup size, you just weren't really in the smaller bra to begin with.   If you scoop and swoop and the bra appears to fit, that tells us that either your measurements are overestimating your cup size, like maybe there's some extra inches from your back measurement throwing things off (this happened to me, I measured 38F but fit best in 38DD/E) or you have a shallow shape and need to look for shallow bras."
ABraThatFits,3cr9rw,AliasAurora,2,Fri Jul 10 05:05:34 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely hung up on the new cup size, because looking around at other 40Es I do not have nearly the same amount of breast tissue. I'm a plus size woman with a small bust, which is pretty hard to shop for.  I will try the swoop and scoop on my current bras later and see how they fit. I've also ordered a 40E to see how that will fit. Thanks for your advice, I'll update when I try some things out."
ABraThatFits,3cr9rw,gliterpoison,2,Fri Jul 10 14:12:21 2015 UTC,I'm actually seeing a 40DD but it could be different for the projection? I know people in larger band sizes have some weird stuff with the sizing that I don't understand from lack of experience
ABraThatFits,3cr9rw,aboywithgirls,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:59:20 2015 UTC,"Weird sizing for sure, lol. I'm pretty sure I have projection but I'm going to try to ""rearrange"" everything in my current bras and the 40E I ordered and see what happens. A 40DD is next on my list if that doesn't work."
ABraThatFits,3cryno,FruitPlatter,5,Fri Jul 10 08:02:09 2015 UTC,"Are you sure you're much fuller on top? It sounds like you're more of an 3/6 shape (basically, very full all over. The leaning 90Â° test usually results in nipples being mostly centered) and/or have shorter roots/higher set breasts. The PL and S especially are very tall cups in your size range.  What sort of cleavage are you looking for? Plunging necklines, or 'cakes on a plate'? Did you try the S with the cookie inserts in?  Charlotte is wickedly shallow. Like ""I'm wearing 2 sizes larger than normal and my boobs are so squished I feel like I'm suffocating"" shallow. It is also quite tall, cup wise, so I don't think it will help with the gaping much :(  Could you draw a sketch of the triangle shape you get in BM? I have a picture in my head but I want to make sure I'm understanding correctly. At any rate, BMs are a great everyday cut, but they're not going to give you any cleavage.  Ewa's CHP (not standard in your size, she might not be willing to make it), or Comexim's HC (also not standard in your size, but Anna isn't nearly as fickle when it comes to custom work) would be possibilities for cakes on a plate style cleavage. Comexim's plunge is also a possibility, but the wires are quite a bit narrower than the Kris Line you've got. What size are you wearing Letizia in? Some other Kris Line cuts might have what you're looking for as well."
ABraThatFits,3cryno,buymeflowers,3,Fri Jul 10 16:05:58 2015 UTC,"By the time I have a cup I can fill, the gore no longer tacks. Is this a band size issue?    No, not really. The wrong bandsize can make this issue worse, but if you tried a lot of bras in a large variety of sizes this can usually be ruled out.   I fear that you'll never have a tacking gore unless you go the custom route. It sounds like you got very round and very projected breasts that have less than average volume for the projection they got. With breasts like this it is tricky to get a good fit even if you need sizes like 36F and are spoilt for choice, in a size range like yours....   Yes Parfait Charlotte is relatively shallow, but its half-cup shape might surprise you.   The triangle boobs in EM sounds like a shape mismatch. EM bras are meant for a full on bottom shape that her bras form into a shape that looks even to full on top in the bras. Since you got a full on top shape already, the shaping powers of EM bras were too much for you. You have volume where the EM bras expect none, so the cup is too closed on top and presses down, causing triangle boobs.   I am looking at the bras you tried and I would like to encourage you to try two more brands - Elila, especially the 2311 in US 40K (UK 40H) and the Gorgeous by Debenhams bras.   If those don't work, stick to Krisline for all further bra purchases."

ABraThatFits,3cryno,rado999,2,Fri Jul 10 22:22:18 2015 UTC,"We sound like boob twins. Very similar size and we seem to have exactly the same problem: FOT, very soft tissue, squishing in the middle, gore not tacking as a result. A lower gore has worked well for me and the solution for me was the Charnos Jive, if you can still find it; it works best for me in a 38HH. The Panache Rhapsody in a 38K also works brilliantly for me and despite what a lot of people here seem to think is nothing remotely like the Tango (the one with the absurdly high gore).   Good luck, I'll be watching this with interest."
ABraThatFits,3cryno,atouchofyou,2,Fri Jul 10 09:58:44 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, why does Freya not work for you? I'm also projected and narrow, too close-set to have a tacking gore on most bras, and I'll sacrifice perfect fit to get nice cleavage and they're the only bras I've ever found that work for me consistently."
ABraThatFits,3cryno,buymeflowers,4,Fri Jul 10 19:57:01 2015 UTC,"It's very likely due to her size. Freya is pretty much horrendous in the +H cup size range, with only a very few exceptions.

ABraThatFits,3cryno,khasiv,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:59:16 2015 UTC,"I think it's that they might change the wires after a G cup. The cup construction isn't totally unreasonable at larger sizes (e.g. 30K), but the wires are too soft to support the actual weight. I mean, in principle, wouldn't ""G"" mean a 38DD would also be terrible? I don't think we have the data to say anything about volume per se, but may have a rule based on cup letter."

ABraThatFits,3crmbb,hurrrrrmione,2,Fri Jul 10 19:24:36 2015 UTC,You're welcome! Please do try a 32E (US 32DDD) like you're measuring. 34DD might also work if you find the band too tight on 32E bras.
ABraThatFits,3crmbb,braaccount,4,Fri Jul 10 20:57:36 2015 UTC,"The last 3 measurements being the exact same is unusual. Do you have very firm, unmoving breast tissue? If not, I would remeasure.  You can see from the second photo that the wires of the bra are not under your breasts where they should be, so the bra is hanging there like a sling instead of supporting you. I suspect if you follow the instructions that /u/hurrrrrmione linked to, the bra will turn out to be more obviously too small and possibly not the best shape."
ABraThatFits,3crmbb,j_sunrise,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:29:28 2015 UTC,No my boobs are pretty normal firm... firmality? lol. I will remeasure with a spotter.  I tried scooping and swooping and it's def too small. I will try another size and repost.
ABraThatFits,3cqd4k,throwaway4boobz,5,Thu Jul 9 22:50:49 2015 UTC,"Well the 32FF slides down so much partly because it's too small.  But even the 30GG isn't quite projected enough.  And no, in your size range, there isn't really anything else by any UK brand I would recommend for a seamless, molded bra that has any more projection than that Deco.  They're all varying degrees of shallow.  Depending on your root width, Comexim will be your best bet for a padded bra with tons of immediate projection.  They aren't seamless, but they are lined or lightly padded to provide nipple coverage.  I don't notice the seams through bras, personally.  Maybe browse around braswap for secondhand Comexims in a 65K or 70J to try out and see how they fit?  You could also look for padded EM's in 65GG/H or 70G/GG, they should have enough projection and the wires will run a little wider than Comexim.  Bonus - Polish wires are short so no armpit stabbing."

Is that about right for comexim? I'm all on board for short wires!  I just wanted to make sure I had no other good options besides polish before I start down that road.Thanks for the size recs!"
ABraThatFits,3cqd4k,lcl0706,2,Fri Jul 10 02:10:14 2015 UTC,"Ewa Michalak would probably be better for you then.  Comexim's wires are narrower than Cleo Lily.  EM's are usually Lily-ish if not wider.  I tried everything UK I could find I swear, but once I went Polish... there's no going back.  It sounds intimidating and overwhelming, but I tried a few second hand ones to try to figure out what size I'd need and swapped a couple times and finally just placed an order.  If it fits you the way it's supposed to, it's worth it.  You might ask around for any tips for ordering from EM though, as I've only tried Comexim."

ABraThatFits,3cpe32,raix-corvus,7,Thu Jul 9 18:29:20 2015 UTC,"With your underbust measurements you are probably better off in a 38 band. If you find a 38 band consistently too loose, you could go down to a 36, but I doubt that you need to.   With this in mind I get around UK 38F/FF as sizes to start with. That is US 38F/G with Lane Bryant and US 38 G/H with  Anita, Chantelle, Goddess and other US-sized brands.   Forget the results with the 42 bands, way too wide. A 38DDD is equal to a UK 38E, it is just one cupsize smaller than UK 38F. Not totally out of the question. 38D is way too small.    Is it even possible to get a wireless bra that big!   The largest RTW bra that is currently manufactured is the Elila 1305, this bra goes up to US 52N and it is wireless.  Downside to wireless bras is that there are no wires that distribute the weight of the breasts into the band. This can lead to a lack of proper support and to having a lot of the weight on the shoulders. The best way to get good support from a wireless bra is to pick one that is slightly too small in the cup so that the support comes from the binding effect of cup+band being smaller than your bust circumference when standing.   Sadly the second option is probably not a good idea with your chest pain.   I fear you'll have to try quite a few bras until you find one that you like.   Some women with your condition like longline bras because they distributes the pressure over a larger area. This allows them to wear bras that are slightly too wide without loosing stability.   I figure that soft and flexible wires are probably also a good idea. Anita, Freya, Fantasie and some bras by Elomi and Goddess have relatively soft wires, ditto Hotmilk and Cake Lingerie if you don't mind nursing bras."

I will definitely look into those brands; I have looked at Freya before (way back when) and have seen some Fantasie online too.  I will keep an eye out for the others!  I agree the 38F/FF seems a good place to start - I just needed someone to sanity check me as I've never been good at understanding bra sizes even when I did wear them in the past.  Thanks a lot for such an in depth reply though, it is really helpful!"
ABraThatFits,3cpe32,Goddess_Keira,3,Fri Jul 10 18:21:24 2015 UTC,"If you would like to get wire-free bras, don't worry about getting your size as there are quite a few on the market. Goddess makes several styles as wire-free, including their Keira, Alice, Clara, and Audrey styles. The first three come in both wired and wire-free versions, and Audrey is a wire-free only style. Goddess comes in US sizes. Also Elomi Caitlyn (in UK sizes) has both a wired and a wire-free version.  If you try the Anita brand, they have a really nice wire-free bra called Jana with a high cotton content and a lovely soft elastic band. Also, if you're up for trying underwire, the Anita Rosa Faia #5490 is made of a lovely, soft microfibre fabric. It's best for a fairly shallow shape, though. Anita bras are a bit pricey but very nice. As t_maia already mentioned, your Anita size would be 38G/H. The brand Glamorise also makes both wired and wire-free bras in your US size 38G/H, though their wired bras have pretty shallow cups, I think, and might not be great for you. The wire-free ones might have some good options for you, though.  I will also mention Royce Lingerie, which is a British brand that makes only wire-free bras. Ordering from overseas is costly but some specialty lingerie shops do stock the brand and perhaps you may live near one of them. You can check their website for store locators.  I'd expect that you will want to try quite a few different styles and sizes in order to find what's most comfortable for you. Also, I would expect there to be an adjustment period for you to become accustomed to wearing a more fitting bra, even the best of fits, but some are definitely going to be better than others. And there's definitely many options out there for you, whether underwired or wire-free!"
ABraThatFits,3cpe32,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:03:39 2015 UTC,I have seen some Royce online and was tempted to get one straight away but figured it is best to try something on in person first.

For some reason the bra size calculator is down ATM, but if you take your 5 measurements you can calculate the size yourself using these instructions http://i.imgur.com/jcNkeVr.png  Also, check out the shape guide, which will help you determine the shape of your breasts, as this is just as important for finding the correct fitting bra as their size.

ABraThatFits,3cqu60,Goddess_Keira,14,Fri Jul 10 01:56:24 2015 UTC,"In the world of proper bra fitting, 32DD isn't a large size. The common thought that A cup = small, C cup = average and DD cup = HUGE! is really wrong. A 32DD is really closer to a pretty average size.   Also, cup size isn't a set measure - not all DD cups have the same volume. Cup size is relative to band size, so the cups on a 32DD bra are actually smaller than the cups on a 38DD bra. The cup letter is only a representative of the size difference between you bust and underbust measurements.   To get a good visual idea of what a real 32DD looks like, here are some photos of women wearing a properly fitting 32DD.  http://www.brabandproject.com/gallery/search?band=32&cup=DD&age=&brand=&sister_sizes=0&search=Search  Do they look a similar size to yours?"

ABraThatFits,3cqv9y,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:47:10 2015 UTC,"Yes. Many times. Once I start moving, it slides down. I do have pendulous breasts. Is this just part of the fun?"
ABraThatFits,3cqv9y,Goddess_Keira,3,Fri Jul 10 01:58:44 2015 UTC,"In my own experience having pendulous breasts definitely does make a difference. My bewbs drag every bra down with them. If I get a more projected bra, the liquid tissue just settles further down in the bra and the bra sinks. Tighter band; still sinks. I have a rib flare (or something akin to that) on one side, so that contributes as well. Nothing stays in my IMF for even a millisecond unless I'm either holding on to it or shoving my shoulders back unnaturally.  I say all this to tell you that I think for some of us, getting a bra to stay in the IMF may be a lost cause. You may or may not be one of those people. At any rate, if the cups of your 32GG Jasmine are too small, may as well try it in 32H and see what happens. You need the larger cup size anyways."
ABraThatFits,3cqv9y,hurrrrrmione,2,Fri Jul 10 02:14:25 2015 UTC,"Okay, just wanted to check. Sliding down out of your IMF means the cup isn't projected enough. Your measurements do indicate you could possibly be as large as a 32HH, so it's worth trying a 32H. A bigger cup size will have more projection on average. This bra might also just not be projected enough for you."
ABraThatFits,3cqv9y,Goddess_Keira,2,Fri Jul 10 02:05:16 2015 UTC,"Sliding down out of your IMF means the cup isn't projected enough.   I know that's the ""received wisdom"" on the sub, and I don't doubt it's true in a lot of cases, but I don't think it's true for everybody. I have come to believe that there are certain breast characteristics, like being very large, heavy-breasted and/or pendulous, that will shove any bra out of the IMF, and some women will not be able to get a bra to stay there no matter how well it fits otherwise.  Obviously I have not tried on every bra ever made, in every conceivable size that might fit me, in order to demonstrate this hypothesis (and then too, I'm only one person). But after much trying over the years I believe it to be true, and I am starting to mention it because I have concern that the fitting practices we endorse may possibly be pushing an unattainable ideal for some percentage of women. Please note, this is not directed specifically at you because you've only said what many others have said, including the experts and probably me at other times as well."
ABraThatFits,3cqv9y,crazymusicalgenius96,3,Fri Jul 10 02:22:52 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling that this issue is kind of like gore-tacking - once you reach a certain amount of volume and center-fullness, it's nearly impossible to get a tacking gore.   Another important factor that we don't talk about much regarding the IMF is the shape of the IMF itself. I have a very pronounced Nike swoosh shape - my breasts are very close set all the way down my sternum and then they taper off at the sides like a Nike swoosh. Other people have more of a sideways parenthesis shape than a deep U shape. And most underwires are U-shaped! So that could be contributing to sliding and space at the underwire too. I know I've only been able to find one bra that's got a narrow gore from top to bottom (Masquerade Medina) and some people can't wear any Panache or Cleo bras because the underwires make such a deep U."

If I do the hand bra thing, which is the only way to see my IMF, it looks like that shallow, sideways parenthesis shape. Good analogy about the near impossibility/impossibility for some to have a tacking gore."

ABraThatFits,3cqv9y,legal_beagle,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:23:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with this completely!  I cannot get a bra to stay in my IMF no matter what I do.  I have crazy projected breasts, but they are very large, as well as very dense and heavy.  I've pretty much given up on ever getting a bra with enough projection (even EM bras are a bit of a joke for me, projection-wise) and have stopped worrying about it, so long as the rest of the bra fits well!"

ABraThatFits,3coqbi,eLLyB22,4,Thu Jul 9 15:36:44 2015 UTC,Hi there! In order to give you some recommendations (and help you get re-fit!) we are going to need your five measurements from the beginner's gude. This will help us determine how many cups up you'll need to go up and we will hopefully be able to offer some good brand and model recommendations for you!
ABraThatFits,3coqbi,cupcakery,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:00:53 2015 UTC,"Ah-- thanks. My regular underbust is 32"", the snug is 30"". Standing I measure 38"", 38"" when laying down, and 40"" bent over."
ABraThatFits,3cquad,publicshaming7,10,Fri Jul 10 01:12:46 2015 UTC,"Don't be sad, you're certainly not a 30AA! It looks like you may have made a mistake in using the text calculations instead of the calculator.  This is my first time using the text calculations (the automatic calculator is also not working for me either ATM), but according to my calculations you should be looking around a 30DD.  Straps falling is a classic indicator that your band is too large, which would make sense if you were wearing a 32 band when you measure as a 30.   Have you had a look at the shape guide yet? Finding your new size is only part of find the right bra. Everyone's breasts are shaped differently, and so are different bras. Some bras will never work with the shape of your breasts, even if they are the right size. So I'd suggest looking at the shape guide to work out what shape your breasts may be."

ABraThatFits,3cquad,talesofa30band,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:21:20 2015 UTC,"are you in America? Check out bras from the brand b.Tempt'd (a subbrand from Wacoal)! I just got a few in 30DD that fit me. I find that the bands run small in them though (This band is 28"" on the loosest hook, not 30!). And since your boobs/underbust are a little bit bigger than mine, you could try a 32DD and that might work well in this specific brand and wouldn't be as hard to find as 30 bands.  I need to add that I don't know if ALL the bras in the line run small in the band! But looking at the b.Wow'd (my favorite) and the Ciao Bella in what is technically a 30"" and....yeah...its a bit on the small side."
ABraThatFits,3cquad,yellkaa,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:33:48 2015 UTC,"You seem to be around my size (a 30DD). I measure 29/29.5 and 35"" standing. I wear a snug 32D at the moment as it's easier to find. It's not perfect but close. I can put it on the tightest hook and still feel comfortable as I am really a 30 band."
ABraThatFits,3cquad,Thatghostthatgoesboo,0,Fri Jul 10 17:37:17 2015 UTC,"Look, the calculating is pretty simple. Your underbust measurement is your band size. In your case the difference between snug and tight is so small that you definitely seem to be a 30 band. Now, let's figure out your cup size. Each letter is 1 inch of underbust and bust measurements difference. Your bust is 34-35, underbust is 30, so we get 4-5 inches difference. Let's count: 1 - A 2 - B 3 - C 4 - D 5 - DD  so, we get D/DD cup for 30 band. Some bras, as Freya's, for example, have stretchy bands which run about a size bigger, so you may need 28DD/E in their bras.   Now just try to look around at the stores. 30D usually is the easiest to find, so you may start from that point."

ABraThatFits,3cquad,Thatghostthatgoesboo,9,Fri Jul 10 01:17:25 2015 UTC,"This is a really inaccurate calculator, measuring over the bust is pretty meaningless. We as a community measure over the largest part of the breast and where the band wraps around the ribcage because those are the two parts of a bra. Measuring from your underarms around ABOVE your breasts doesn't make sense because there isn't a part of the bra that actually goes around that part of your chest, at least until they start selling REAL boulder holsters :P"

Don't be afraid to comment for fear of being wrong, there are lots of different levels of knowledge around. You'll never learn everything there is to learn if you don't ask questions and challenge your assumptions :) Besides, you were right that different brands can run small or large, and that you'll probably have a variety of sizes in your drawer at the end of the day.

ABraThatFits,3cqs5l,SlippingStar,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:54:32 2015 UTC,"From manual calculation, I get your size as 30G/GG. Is this what the calculator said? If you try bras in those sizes and the band still rides up, you could look for a 28GG/H."
ABraThatFits,3cqs5l,eveningtrain,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:57:02 2015 UTC,I went down a band size due to the difference in my snug and tight underbusts.
ABraThatFits,3cp3be,illirica,6,Thu Jul 9 17:11:10 2015 UTC,"You'll probably prefer 26DD/E which is rare but it exists, possibly 28D/DD with a rixie-clip?"
ABraThatFits,3cp3be,j_sunrise,2,Thu Jul 9 17:54:58 2015 UTC,"I have about the same underbust and I typically wear 28 bands just because they're easier to find. Comexim would make a 24 or 26 band custom order. Because there's not a huge difference between your snug and tight measurements the 26 is probably going to be a better bet/more comfortable. Amazon is a good place to start because of free shipping and returns for prime. For Full on Bottom, Cleo Lucy, Kali, or Ellis might work. They'll provide a nice lift and rounded shape. Do you know if you're shallow or projected? IMO that makes the largest difference in what things to recommend."
ABraThatFits,3cp3be,petitecollegiate,3,Thu Jul 9 20:58:39 2015 UTC,"Go for 26DD/E or 28D/DD. The former if you're okay with paying roughly Â£22-Â£30 for bras and the latter if you'd rather find something cheaper (around Â£10-20)  Comexim and Ewa Michalak will sew 26 bands as custom orders. They are the 2 most popular makers of 26 bands. Wellfitting is Comexim's U.S. supplier of Comexim and has 26 bands without needing to custom order! Bosom Galore does luxury 26 bands but its probably worth waiting until you're sure about your size to get one.  Cleo by Panache and Boux Avenue's bras run pretty snug, so you'd be fine with their 28 bands.  30B has the same volume as 28C and 26D.  I'm around 5""3-5""4, so not that short, but I've never had too much of an issue with Cleo. Look for fully-adjustable straps."
ABraThatFits,3cp3be,xuenylom,7,Thu Jul 9 22:24:00 2015 UTC,Wellfitting also has free shipping and returns and they offer 26 bands by default.
ABraThatFits,3cp3be,noys,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:54:56 2015 UTC,"If the straps are too long perhaps you could sew them shorter? I don't know if it's a good idea or the best way to do it, but it's worth a Google!"
ABraThatFits,3cp3be,ilyemco,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:36:12 2015 UTC,"In a smaller band size, you will be able to tighten the straps really small. I'm rather tall but i never tighten the straps on my 28 bands even though I could make them a lot smaller. I think you'll be fine! Do you think you're shallow? Make sure to research which bras will work for your shape, especially if you end up ordering customs from a Polish company!"
ABraThatFits,3cp3be,Julez22,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:06:21 2015 UTC,"Do you sew? Shortening the straps is a very easy modification. Use a flexible measuring tape to figure out what your ideal length would be, and then remove the straps, find the difference between ideal and existing strap length, and remove half that amount from each side. Would definitely practice on a cheapie or old unused bra."
ABraThatFits,3coy4e,girl_toronto,7,Thu Jul 9 16:34:23 2015 UTC,"I struggled with this so much with sports bras-- here' what I foudn out: One way to verify whether the band is actually too tight (vs. the cups being too small) is put the bra on backwards- cups on the back, and clasp under the bust.  If it's too tight this way- the band is probably too small.  If it is not too tight this way, the cups are too small and are adding to the tightness you're feeling.  Does that make sense?"
ABraThatFits,3coy4e,Sladern,2,Thu Jul 9 16:51:09 2015 UTC,How long do you keep it on like this?
ABraThatFits,3coy4e,Sladern,4,Thu Jul 9 17:58:59 2015 UTC,"Oh, just try it on and see how it feels.  A couple minutes maybe.  I only did it for a few seconds on each bra probably."
ABraThatFits,3coy4e,Sladern,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:12:52 2015 UTC,I tried it on like this the band still feels too tight and uncomfortable . Does this mean i'm a 34 band size?
ABraThatFits,3coy4e,Sladern,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:44:31 2015 UTC,"I'd say yes, in that brand, try a 34. I measure as a 32dd but am actually more comfortable in some brands as a 34d."
ABraThatFits,3coy4e,cupcakery,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:51:26 2015 UTC,Is your underbust measurement 34 or 32? Ya after an hour of wearing the 32 bra i had a dull ache under my breasts near my ribs that i just couldn't wait to take the bra off.
ABraThatFits,3coy4e,noys,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:51:19 2015 UTC,"32 snug, 29.5 tight."
ABraThatFits,3coy4e,noys,5,Fri Jul 10 13:21:38 2015 UTC,"For starters, it's not unusual to prefer a 32 band since your snug and tight measurements are only 1"" apart. As you get used to it, you may find yourself wanting to size down to 30's though.  The 32E Freya you got is probably a cup too small, which could contribute to the tightness. Freya is a UK brand, and the sister size to the 30FF you measure is a 32F. I'm not as familiar with Change bras and how they run. Try the advice that /u/Sladern gave as far as putting them on backwards and upside down to test the band tightness in that position."
ABraThatFits,3coy4e,noys,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:11:10 2015 UTC,The 32F Change bra that i got actually feels more tight than the 32E Freya I guess it is because a bit of a pushup. It kind of hurts my left rib after a day of wearing it. I prefer the comfiness of 34 but it doesnt give enough lift to my breasts.  I tried to find Sladern's post but I'm having trouble. Sorry I'm a bit new here. How do I find this post? Thanks.
ABraThatFits,3coy4e,Goddess_Keira,4,Thu Jul 9 17:58:32 2015 UTC,"Change bras use EU sizing with a DD added in. Theoretically it should fit similarly to UK F cup but in practice it runs small in cups so it's more like an UK E.  There are several things that could be at play. 1) Some Change bras are quite firm in band initially, especially the ones with a silky sort of swimwear-like synthetic material in band construction. 2) It could very well be a shape mismatch. Most Change bras are wide and shallow. 3) You could need a bigger cup. It would match your largest bust measurement. Too small cups often make a band feel too tight and a shape mismatch will contribute. I had a similar problem with a Change bra that was a cup size too small, it felt way tight."
ABraThatFits,3coy4e,SmellsLikeDogBuns,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:51:37 2015 UTC,You dont think the band is too tight and I should go back to 34?

ABraThatFits,3coy4e,eveningtrain,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:46:15 2015 UTC,A Freya 32 band will stretch to close to 34 inches anyway... It fits more like 34DD...

Well, the 28JJ is a Panache Confetti which IS past season, but the cheapest I can find of that size and new with tags on ebay is Â£11.95... more than twice the price... so no!

We are blessed in my town with not only Bravissimo and Debenhams but also Boux Avenue which has loads in your size range from Â£10 ($15) and I've offered before that if anyone in the US wanted anything from UK stores that had awful/expensive attempts at shipping to the US then I'd be happy to take requests and then put the bras on bratabase for them to buy!"

Admittedly, Freya Marvel is a wide, shallow bra, so it might work on you, but it's a toss up.  I found Nichole to be a much better fit for me overall, though it also runs very small in the band. I bought it in a 34H back when I really was in a 34 band and had to wear it with an extender. The 34 fits me without an extender now that I'm closer to a 32 band in most brands.  If you do want to go with Liliana, I think the 32FF is probably right, though."

ABraThatFits,3coq4i,khasiv,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:33:49 2015 UTC,"I have a Liliana in a 28G, my normal size.  It did not work for me, but when I bought it I thought I was wider and shallower than I actually am.  It's not that it runs small, it's that it is ridiculously wide and shallow.  The band is really tight.  My 28G measures over 6.1"" wide.  It's more wide and shallow than most wide and shallow people.  That is why most people need to size up - just to get enough room in the cup because it is so wide and so flat it will shove your boobs up against your chest and out over the tops of the cups.  I'm not trying to deter you, I'm just warning you - with Marcie being a good fit on you, the Liliana will be a big shape mismatch on you.  It's not a good shape for very many people at all, even the model shows folding in the bottoms of the cups.  Which is a shame, because it is an adorable bra.  If you don't mind the cups being an inch too wide and the wires sitting half an inch below your IMF, get a 32FF and knock yourself out.  It is comfortable and it is minimizing, probably because it's so damn wide.  But I can't do the shape, and I've been trying to sell it for a couple months and literally nobody wants it... I'm not sure who its intended to actually fit.  I wish they'd re-do the fit of it!  Edit - I know nothing about the matching bottoms, sorry."

ABraThatFits,3cnqb4,yellkaa,4,Thu Jul 9 09:32:14 2015 UTC,"Shape mismatch.   You need the rounded bottom of the Freya plunge balcony bras. Curvy Kate as a brand does not have enough volume in the bottom for you. This is the reason the bra slides down, your breasts need the room there and push the bottom cup down.   It is the same problem as you had in the Gaia bras just closer to your size.   The cups are also a bit too large, this compensates a bit for the shape mismatch, but not enough.   Your best bet for a really low plunge in your size range is the Bravissimo Satine and cut siblings.   Otherwise look at Ewa Michalak and Comexim."

However, it's kind of a complicated process to get these bras in the US (there are only 2 boutiques in the US that stock the brand, to my knowledge, the rest are in Poland). You can get second-hand ones on /r/braswap or Bratabase relatively easily, though it will take a bit of research as not all of Ewa's styles are particularly t-shirt friendly. Or you can order directly from the company, and they will make the bra and ship it to you."

ABraThatFits,3cndo4,SaltyBlackBroad,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:28:48 2015 UTC,"I'm loving your ""crazy complicated"" comment. Currently, Ewa Michalak has experienced some serious sales growth, and their orders are running roughly 6 to 10 weeks depending on the size and style. I am currently ordering mostly the BM cups because they are running more consistently and working for more clients. As for customer service, I know that there have been some complaints regarding this issue, but I can say personally I have had no problems other than the fact that their order fulfillment is taking longer than expected. Being a small business owner, I understand the quandary that they are in because they have seen exponential growth in the last 6 months. I was informed today that they are trying to hire experienced people because of their business growth. I think part of the issue is that Ewa Michalak  produces in house instead of some large warehouse with 150 to 200 people sewing the product. The general public is so used to getting things within days, so when you are dealing with a company that is essentially hand making their products (50 people or less I think is the ""handmade"" standard), it's hard to understand or be patient with their production processes. I would suggest if you choose to order from them, that you email them first, tell them what you are planning on ordering and asking if it's ready made or if it's a size that is already ready to ship so that they can tell you an approximate turnaround time."

ABraThatFits,3cmgcx,littleotterpop,7,Thu Jul 9 01:26:36 2015 UTC,"You can tell the difference with time. Migrated tissue moves forward once the cup is large enough, wide roots stay put.    Like if I bend over and all of the breast tissue hangs, it seems much more narrow.   That is normal.   With women who got very narrow roots bowing forward actually gives better and more accurate results.  Whatever tissue might be in their armpits when standing falls forward.   It is also possible to have a very thin layer of tissue under your armpit that is technically root, but zero volume there. Some women with this problem choose to wear narrow but soft wires, they conciously make the choice to have wires sitting on breasttissue in order to get more stability in the cup. These women typically alternate between wide wires and narrow wires, wide wires for days before shark week when the breasttissue is swollen and sensitive to pressure and narrow wires for the rest of the time.    and what bras would fit best?    For starters go for bras with wide wires. It is what fits you now, plus the wide wires encourage migration forward. Then wait and see."
ABraThatFits,3cmgcx,t_maia,3,Thu Jul 9 09:02:48 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the completely ignorant question, but how can I tell if a bra has wide wires, and how do they encourage migration forward? Any solid bras I've gotten in my current size have forced tissue to sit wider apart than it does naturally (no difference from leaning forward to standing upright), and I think migration is becoming a problem, though I've mostly worn underwired fabric bras due to the fit issue. If anything I would like solid bras to hold them closer together..."
ABraThatFits,3cmgcx,Boo_X,6,Thu Jul 9 13:21:35 2015 UTC,"but how can I tell if a bra has wide wires   Easiest - holding two bras in the same size  next to each other, one with narrow wires and one with wide wires. A good combination is Freya Patsy Plunge Balcony vs Freya Patsy Padded Halfcup.   Once you tried those on, you know where wide wires and where narrow wires sit on your body and what you prefer.   Bratabase is also a good tool, problem is that gore height can really skew things.    Any solid bras I've gotten in my current size have forced tissue to sit wider apart than it does naturally (no difference from leaning forward to standing upright),    This for two reasons. First is a grading issue. For grading reasons, bra manufactures place the apex of the cups further apart. The larger the cup, the further apart the apex. The second is that most modern D+ bras do ""lift and seperate"" instead of the insane ""push them together"" you see advertised with too small bras. Essentially those advertisements give you unrealistic expectations."
ABraThatFits,3cmgcx,t_maia,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:49:56 2015 UTC,"There is clearly so much that I need to learn... So, if I 'scoop & swoop' in ANY bra I've tried, the tissue sits higher and much closer together than the bra wants it to; I assume this is from the apex being too wide? Is there such a thing as a bra with large cups and a narrow apex? Should I actually try a smaller cup??"
ABraThatFits,3cmgcx,Boo_X,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:11:13 2015 UTC,"In your case I suspect that your breasts have been pushed to the front and to the middle for years by too small bras. It is not just possible to get breast migration to the back,  it is also possible to get breast migration towards your clavicle and throat. My old bras were that much too small for me that my breasts were severely deformed. Zero volume around the nipple, but lots of tissue sitting very high up above the gore that did some very funny things. I tried so many bras in the early stages and none of them fit because my breasts were so misshapen. Sadly I did not realise it. It was not until breastmigration was almost through (about 8 months after I placed my first order) that it got better and that I finally found bras that I was happy with.   Apex issue - this also depends upon the cut of the bra. Bras that are cut well for your shape will work better for you and have this issue less than others. So instead of searching for a bra with a narrow apex, search for a bra that is a good fit for your breastshape. Also accept that the apex in larger cup bras is further apart (took me a while too, I was so used to my too small bras that at first I did not like how my breasts looked in the correct size.)  Additionally you might have a lot of inner fullness, bras that cater to this shape will probably work better for you. Cleo Marcie, Freya Deco and Gorsenia bras are good. Other Freya bras can be hit and miss. With Fantasie the balconettes are not too bad.    Do not buy a smaller cup."

ABraThatFits,3cmgcx,nidena,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:21:07 2015 UTC,"If you're just starting out wearing your proper size, it's definitely possible to have migrated tissue in your underarm area. After some time in a well fitting bra, and scooping and swooping properly, this tissue may eventually re-migrate more 'front and center' so to speak. In such an example, you would appear to have wide roots at first, and as time went on, you would find narrower bras to fit best.  No matter what, you always want to make sure you aren't wearing bras that are too narrow - this can be painful, and wouldn't encourage positive tissue migration  When I first started out in 32G, I wore Freya half cups, which are some of the widest bras available. Now 2+ years later, I get my best fit in Comexim, which is the likely narrowest bra available in my size range. So things can definitely change :)"

You don't need to tell anyone your bra size, even if they are your friend. But you could also just keep telling your friends your size is 32DD.   Remember that your breasts are the same size, you're just putting them in a different size bra that will fit them better.

If you expect to grow some more in the underbust, a 38 band might be the better choice. New bras should fit you on the tightest hook right now, this allows you go for the wider hooks as your passenger grows.  With a snug underbust of 36 I would not go for a 34 band, especially not in a pregnant woman.   Sizewise I get between 36G, 36GG and 36H, tendency towards the larger cupsizes.    If you used to get a good fit in Curvy Kate, wired bras to look at would be the Curvy Kate unpadded plunges - Daisy, Dare, Dita, Firecracker. The low gores allow easy conversion into nursing bras.

ABraThatFits,3cmvge,otterhugs,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:55:42 2015 UTC,"Definitely great advice, thanks. We were planning to try on as many as we could because who knows when we'll have access to such a good range again. I was just looking for any suggestions so we didn't accidentally miss something suitable. In any case, this store seems to have good fitting practices (no +4, woohoo!) and very knowledgable staff so that should be helpful too.   I'll definitely take some notes because like you said, they will come in handy when we head into the world of buying online. We just want to try them in person first as there's no retailer that does free returns/shipping with UK brands for Australians.  Thanks for the Shock Absorber advice too, this is her first try at any sports bra so we'll see how we go."
ABraThatFits,3cmvge,CherryAmesAgain,2,Fri Jul 10 00:14:27 2015 UTC,ASOS should do free shipping and returns. =)
ABraThatFits,3cmvge,CherryAmesAgain,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:04:07 2015 UTC,"ASOS do free returns in Australia but not free return shipping :( Because we live in a country area it makes things expensive to return. And not sure about other countries, but they don't sell Panache or Freya here, which are the brands we want to try. They do sell Shock Absorber though :)"
ABraThatFits,3cn38x,iwannacumtho,18,Thu Jul 9 04:42:54 2015 UTC,"If you're interested, you can take your own measurements according to the beginner's guide and put them into the bra size calculator here. It is the most accurate calculator we know of - not 100% perfect, but will give you a good starting point. There's also no pressure to buy anything from sales assistants!  After you've measured yourself, you can post a measurement check so others can help guide you on the best sizes to start trying when you're ready to buy new bras.   Also, having an idea on size is only half the battle. It also helps to have an idea on the shape of your breasts, as all bras are shaped differently. Even if you are  trying on the right size of a particular bra, its shape may not suit your breasts and it may appear not to fit. If you check out the shape guide it will help you to get an idea of your shape, and then we can use that to suggest specific bras that will be suited to your shape."
ABraThatFits,3cn38x,Shepherd8920,5,Thu Jul 9 05:08:45 2015 UTC,"What was a cup size of that 28 band bra you've tried on? Were you trying it with your breast in cups only, or reversed (when you flip it downwards and try just to clasp under your bust with no putting your boobs inside it) too? Was it tight when reversed?"
ABraThatFits,3cn38x,yellkaa,3,Thu Jul 9 08:06:55 2015 UTC,I would definitely take your measurements according the sidebar and see what you find out!
ABraThatFits,3cn38x,intangiblemango,3,Thu Jul 9 05:34:51 2015 UTC,"As someone who sells bras, albeit at VS, I'd much rather see a customer find a bra that they LOVE and buy that one instead of buying one that they just kind of like--that they may not wear outside of the fitting room--because they feel like they are obligated to do so.  On a side note, a bra should be comfortably snug not uncomfortably tight.  You're the one going to be wearing it, wear what feels comfortable to you not what the salesperson says is supposed to fit."
ABraThatFits,3cn38x,nidena,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:08:28 2015 UTC,"Are you Canadian? Because the European size store (probably Change?) combined with LaSenza sounds like you're in a metropolitan Canadian city.  If the second store is Change, then you should know that their bras are very wide and shallow. If you have projected breasts, then the bra may be incompatible with your shape. I have two bras from Change, both are 28 bands but one measures solidly as a 26 while the other is more true-to-size. So it is definitely possible that you have a 26/28 underbust.  As others have mentioned, take a look at the sidebar for more information on sizing and shape.   So you mentioned that you don't have a budget for more bras, but you can head on over /r/RandomActsOfBras and see if you anyone has anything in your size. Definitely check out r/RandomActsOfBras after reading the sidebar so you know what sizes and styles that would suit you best."

Going by the photo the Caitlyn is about one cupsize too large. Since you say the band is too wide too, try 44GG.   Lower gore is tricky. Elomi has some plunge bras, but they all stop at a G cup on a 44 band. To get the volume of a 44GG, you'd have to wear a 42H with an extender. Less than ideal.   If you want to try a 44G, I suggest you give the Elomi Valentina/Lexi/(Edie?) a try. Those have stretch lace that is more accomodating."
ABraThatFits,3cmsjy,tinkstark,10,Thu Jul 9 03:05:44 2015 UTC,"I wonder if the cup wires are flexible, and you're overextending them, making it cut in and appear too small in the cup whilst also giving you extra stretch in the band? Your measurements point to 34F -> 32FF -> 30G, so it being two cupsizes too small on you kinda reinforces that."
ABraThatFits,3cmsjy,kittenzi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:51:57 2015 UTC,"I don't feel comfortable with putting my photos here. But the band is good, not tight really and the cups are too small for me. I just don't understand how it is possible..."
ABraThatFits,3cmsjy,LoisVain,9,Sat Jul 11 23:48:45 2015 UTC,"Who measured you? And how did they measure you? Can you provide your 5 measurements as per the beginners guide on the sidebar? I'm thinking you were +5'd when you were measured because if your underbust is really 36 inches, then the 30 band would kill you."
ABraThatFits,3cmsjy,hurrrrrmione,2,Thu Jul 9 03:21:18 2015 UTC,"My mom. My measurements are 33-35-42-42-40. And I can really show you how the 30 band fits really fine, no back fat, nothing really. The only problem is that I totally overspill from the cups but that's because the bra is too small."
ABraThatFits,3cmsjy,otterhugs,8,Thu Jul 9 04:06:39 2015 UTC,"Your snug underbust measurement should be larger than your tight underbust measurement - did you accidentally switch those numbers?  Either way a 30 band should be way too tight, though."
ABraThatFits,3cmsjy,LoisVain,3,Thu Jul 9 06:25:47 2015 UTC,"Did you/your mom check to make sure the tape was parallel with the floor when you measured? Its super easy to accidentally measure at an angle, and even small angles can add a lot of inches."
ABraThatFits,3cmsjy,skyaerobabe,2,Thu Jul 9 18:10:09 2015 UTC,"Now I'm super interested in finding out how this is happening too. I can def see you being more of a 34 band rather than the 36. But 34 is still quite a difference from 30. I find that when I size down on the band on some bras, I can't even fasten it. But some, fit just fine. I haven't tried 2 band sizes down yet, but I doubt it would work out for me like it has for you (I'm definitely not athletic, although I wish I was). It probably does have to do with your body type and when you measure yourself. I hope someone who has experienced something similar responds and really shine a light on this."
ABraThatFits,3cmsjy,yellkaa,6,Thu Jul 9 04:36:18 2015 UTC,"Are you measuring using the ABTF method, or the +4/5 method? I'll assume the former, since you're on ABTF now, but it doesn't hurt to ask, right?   Are your breasts high-set (and if so, how high-set)? Do you have a muscular back? I'm ridiculously high set (my bra band, when paralell and my underwires in my IMF) runs over my shoulderblades, and I'm muscular to boot. I find I have as much as a 4"" variation in my measurements some days (29""-33""), and the largest factors are:  1) Arm position. Am I measuring myself? Are my arms raised? Am I in a position my shoulderblades are more prominent? Am I standing relaxed?  2) Am I measuring directly in my IMF, or slightly lower? With my shoulder blades where they are (and protruding teres major, that muscle on your back right by your underarm) result in about a 2"" difference in circumfrence, when I move my measuring tape lower by about 1"".   How snugly are you measuring? Do you find that your measuring tape is warping over/around your ribs, or does it lie smoothly?   How old are your bras (i.e. how stretched out is the band)? Does it measure 30"" when fully stretched, or larger?  Have you also tried measuring your ribcage at different times throughout the day? I find I'm consistantly measuring at my largest after a large meal when I haven't worn a bra all day. I measure at my smallest usually first thing in the morning when I wake up (typically I sleep with a firm-banded bra on).   You can always double-check if your measuring tape is inaccurate, as well. I've got three and all are a smidge different (about 1/3"" over a 60"" measuring tape)."
ABraThatFits,3cmsjy,sirenita12,3,Thu Jul 9 03:31:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, I am. My measurements are 33-35-42-42-40.  I am low set, but my back is also muscular (I'm slim and toned, I can say that I am fit girl). I am never relaxed, I am a really tense person so I can't exactly know... sorry.  I measured really snug (35) and then tight (33).  My bra is 1 month old only and I can fit 30 bands with relative ease since the first day (to be honest, I can use them in all hooks in the first day, not just the first one which shows that the fit is never tight in me... I really don't have any back fat).  I always measure after lunch so maybe that changes the measurements.  I'm going to check my measuring tape and the measurement of the bras bands.  Thank you for your patience really."
ABraThatFits,3cmsjy,yellkaa,6,Thu Jul 9 04:14:11 2015 UTC,"Looking on this picture, at its left side, where are you measuring yourself: on the blue line or on the red one? Are you measuring in inches or converting cms? Take a measurement tape, take your clothing off, stand in front of the mirrow, turn left or right to see a side view of yourself, lift your breasts a bit to place a measurement tape on the blue line and take the measurement by yourself, as tight as possible. How much do you get? Does the measurement change when you change your posture, lift your arms or move your shoulderblades? Take your bra off and measure its band with a measurement tape, stretched to maximum and not stretched at all. What are the numbers?"
ABraThatFits,3cmsjy,yellkaa,3,Thu Jul 9 07:50:53 2015 UTC,Something's off.  I'm a swimmer & the same height as you. I wear a 28/30 band & am 118 lbs.   I'd be willing to bet if you were measured in person by a moderator or expert here you'd get different measurements.
ABraThatFits,3cmsjy,yellkaa,2,Thu Jul 9 14:16:18 2015 UTC,"I'm neither a swimmer nor a muscular person and my height is just an inch less. My weight was fluctuating a lot during my life, but I was still 28 tight and 29,5 inches snug underbust being 110lbs as well as being 160 while my fitted sister of the same height was fluctuating around 30-32 inches tight. I guess, it's not a matter of 'slimness' or so, it's rather your body type which can vary a lot even with the similar height and weight."

The new tag accurately portrays the proper sizing for each international standard.  Since Freya is a UK brand, that's the size you need to pay attention to.  As far as your last question, I think the best way to find out which sizing system they are using is to simiply just ask when you're unsure of which system they are using and ask for them to take a picture of the size tag."
ABraThatFits,3cmpq3,wambrita,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:16:45 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, thanks!   But I'm still trying to figure out why the same size/same brand/same type bra fits so much smaller.. is there a huge difference in fit/sizing if the model no. isn't exactly the same?"
ABraThatFits,3cmpq3,amreb,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:37:30 2015 UTC,"Was the new bra a different color than the old bra?  Sometimes different colors fit differently.  Or, was it a similar style but not exactly the same? Sometimes styles that look very similar can actually fit very differently due to shape issues."
ABraThatFits,3cmpq3,lcl0706,3,Fri Jul 10 00:48:22 2015 UTC,"Sounds like the seller listed it as 30G when in reality it is a 30F. The UK size is correct. I can't stand it when sellers or retailers attempt to convert the UK size to US either out of ignorance or to be ""helpful"" - it's not. Do they take returns? If not you should be able to re sell it on braswap or bratabase."
ABraThatFits,3cmpq3,-tallywa-,3,Thu Jul 9 04:48:19 2015 UTC,"US and UK sizing were never the same. Some manufacturers are more accurate in their tag conversions now but like wambrita said, it's still best to only pay attention to the native system on the tag since not all brands report the conversions correctly."
ABraThatFits,3cmpq3,j_sunrise,2,Thu Jul 9 11:05:23 2015 UTC,"Many bra manufacturers often write the correct size of their own country on the label and only convert the band size for the other ones. Happens in UK brands, happens in EU brands."
ABraThatFits,3cmcp6,astrocutie,2,Thu Jul 9 00:56:52 2015 UTC,"Masquerade runs very tight, a 36 band would likely fix the discomfort issues, and you could likely afford to go down a cup size.  Another option would be to seek out Masquerade Delphi, another padded half cup like Rhea, but it's a bit roomier in the bottom of the cup. The Rhea is not sitting properly in your IMF, which could be due to the band being too tight, or it could be because it isn't deep enough in the bottom of the cup."
ABraThatFits,3cmcp6,buymeflowers,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:35:20 2015 UTC,"I think this bra looks to be too shallow in the cup for you.  The gaping is somewhat expected for such a structured bra (whilst it's not moulded the stiffness of the cups and the lace trim will make the bra gape on a lot of people.  It could be that your breast roots aren't quite tall enough or that you lack the fullness in the top of your breasts needed to fill the cup there, but it's probably just the bra). It's a gorgeous bra and I've looked at it for myself, but like you my boobs would just be too projected.  If it were comfortable it could be worth keeping anyway, but I doubt you could resolve all the various issues to make it work :("
ABraThatFits,3cmhgv,chaucer345,2,Thu Jul 9 01:35:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert for sure, but I've found that when my band is too loose, the gore is more likely to irritate my sternum because it moves around. With a more snug band, the gore sits flush with my sternum and stays in place better."
ABraThatFits,3cmhgv,darling817652,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:38:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I find this just happens with some bras, even when there aren't any obvious fit issues.  Some brands use very hard wires and that can cause discomfort.  It could be related to the hardness of the wires, the height of the centre gore, or the width of the wires.  You could try gently bending the wires in the centre gore outwards away from your body. Some people also put some cotton wool or a cotton pad under the gore next to the skin to relieve the pressure until the bra breaks in. For more help, if you're comfortable posting a fit check somebody might be able to help you diagnose the problem :)"
ABraThatFits,3cmdfu,UndergroundPhoenix,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:02:41 2015 UTC,"Freya Patsy Halfcup and siblings is a great idea.   If that is too shallow, Fantasie Side Support cuts (Jana, Lois), bras by Fauve, Panache Envy, Cleo Lucy and (don't faint at the prices) Primadonna bras.   Theoretically you are sized out of Primadonna, in practise their cups run large and anything around EU 65 H/i or 70G/H might fit.   There is also the occassional Elomi and Goddess bra in UK 32G on ebay, those are one of a kind and were made for modelling purposes."

I need help myself so I'm not one to give advice, but it seems clear that you need a bigger cup not band. If you're concerned about back fat, which is entirely in your head, then a thicker band in the back might help."
ABraThatFits,3cmi3h,xklinx,2,Thu Jul 9 03:02:33 2015 UTC,"I'm convinced that the more support you actually need from a bra (like us), the harder it becomes to find a bra that fits at all!  And I know I may be blowing that back fat a little out of proportion, it's just that between the difference in my tight and snug band measurements and my comparatively looser skin from weight loss around my chest, the stretchier materials that a lot of bra manufactures seem to like end up looking really unflattering on my when the bra is tight enough to give enough support.  I am definitely trying to look for bras with band made in size and off material that is more flattering for how I'm shaped, hopefully that will help!"
ABraThatFits,3cmi3h,xklinx,2,Thu Jul 9 21:03:23 2015 UTC,"I totally hear you sister. (Also, I'm from south jerz, I see your username)  I've probably tried three dozen different types of bras in the past two years. The closest I found for support is Wacoal, but it's not quite right for my shape. In my experience, ABraThatFits guide leads me to bras that are super tight in the band and loosely cup my breasts. And that's the exact opposite of what I want. I don't want to feel any jiggle in my breasts, and definitely don't want back fat, but the bras in ""my size"" seem to do exactly that :/"
ABraThatFits,3cmi3h,tangledThespian,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:18:02 2015 UTC,"No kidding, I'm in much the same boat, with a very similar set of measurements and shape problems. Only I wasn't quite as verbose about asking, and WAY too self-conscious to bring pictures into it. I'm still shopping around myself, and you bet I'll be watching this thread like a hawk for brand and model recommendations!  For what it's worth OP: I tried on a few 34 bands for the first time after measuring myself, figuring it would be right out. I was surprised to find that wasn't true at all. ..Mind you, I couldn't find a cup size above DDD in the store, so still not ABTF.. From my fumbling attempts at research, it looks like brands with projection are the answer. And this might be a personal preference, but if a bra isn't molded or heavily padded, it's right out for me. Like you, I need some help with shaping these pendulous things."
ABraThatFits,3cmi3h,t_maia,4,Thu Jul 9 07:46:05 2015 UTC,"And this might be a personal preference, but if a bra isn't molded or heavily padded, it's right out for me. Like you, I need some help with shaping these pendulous things.   You are limiting yourself too much.   Non-padded bras that have the correct seam placement for your breastshape will actually be more supportive than foam cups, the challenge is finding a seamed cup that works for you. If the seam placement is off, the support won't be any good - which is also how to figure out what works and what does not.   Foam domes however hides these issues. They are a quick and easy hack to a bra that looks good under a shirt, but not the way to a well-fitting bra.   Moulded foam domes keep their shape no matter what, so your breasts have to conform to the bra. Many women find this uncomfortable. In a seamed bra your breasts, your breastshape and the bra find a balance against gravity. The bra is shaped to your breasts and not the other way around.   Finally, unpadded bras are awesome in summer. :)"
ABraThatFits,3cmi3h,tangledThespian,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:20:08 2015 UTC,"I'm willing to concede everything but the last point: nope, no way will I ever go completely unpadded, if only for the peace of mind regarding whether or not strangers can make out the state of my nipples. Nope. o_o  As it is, I've always found a decent molded cup to be rather comfortable(if still not a perfect fit, but that's what I'm here for), while seamed bras have been universally unflattering on me. But it's very possible I haven't tried on one with seams better cut for me. I'll need to keep a better eye out and keep giving them a chance."
ABraThatFits,3cmi3h,t_maia,6,Thu Jul 9 09:33:14 2015 UTC,"Nipple concerns - there is a reason reuseable silicone nipple covers are a thing.   I personally found that placing my nipples directly under the seam keeps everything under control, plus I honestly don't care. I am not ashamed of being a mammal (guys have nipples too! They go topless all the time and nobody cares that their nipples are visible! So why should I care about mine showing through a shirt!) and if a stranger feels offended that my nipples can be seen through my shirt, they probably have been staring at my tits for way too long."
ABraThatFits,3cmi3h,hurrrrrmione,4,Thu Jul 9 09:54:54 2015 UTC,"First of all, congrats on the weight loss! And your breasts look perfectly normal to me.   Most of the problems you're describing and all the fit problems I'm seeing in the picture are due to the cups not being projected enough. Quadboobing + empty space at the bottom of the cup = not enough projection. Gore not tacking = not enough projection. A larger cup size will have more projection on average. Different cuts and shapes of bras will also have different amounts of projection.   A larger size will also give your breasts more lift and support.   Simone Perele is EU sizing, so that bra would be 34DD in both UK and US sizing.  A 34 band might be too tight, looking at your measurements, and the most important thing is that you feel comfortable in your bras and are happy with how they fit. So starting with 36F is completely fine. But keep in mind that different bras in the same band size can  fit differently - some bras and some companies' bras are stretchy, and some are tight. So in some bras and some brands you might prefer 34FF to 36F.   How is the wire width on those bras? They look like they might be too narrow, but it can be hard to tell from photos."
ABraThatFits,3cmi3h,khasiv,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:20:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  As for the width of the wire, it depends.  The pink Victoria's Secret sports bra was probably the widest of the bra's due to size advantage alone, and it went past my breast tissue by about an inch on each side.  The Simone Perele was probably the narrowest, and was sitting right where I think the start of my breast tissue is when swooped and scooped.  The other Victoria's secret kinda floats because the band is too big, and the other lace bra's were all more or less where I think the IMF is.  I will note that I could be wrong about where I think my breast tissue goes to (or how far the wire should go), I'm basing this off of when I pick my breast up in my hand and press it against my chest, a definitive line will form more or less right before the start of my armpit, still on the front of my chest."
ABraThatFits,3cmi3h,t_maia,3,Thu Jul 9 02:50:12 2015 UTC,"I find that the issue of ""back fat"" is solved in bras that are wide enough for my breasts and where the volume is large enough. If my boobs can't escape back out into the band, then they stay in front of me, and I get a smoother silhouette.  I agree that you should aim for 36 bands (perhaps those that run firm). I think you might be a good candidate for Panache Andorra in 36F."
ABraThatFits,3cmi3h,khasiv,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:09:30 2015 UTC,"I've tried the Andorra before (at a heavier weight in a larger size), and if I recall correctly the Andorra was having problems with immediate projections, pushing the cups down a fair bit, and cutting into the tops of my breasts slightly."
ABraThatFits,3cmi3h,Shanakitty,3,Thu Jul 9 03:16:06 2015 UTC,"If you need more room in the bottom cup in Andorra, one way to get this is to size up and shorten the strap or to try the Panache Envy.   Jasmine has more projection at the apex, but less volume in the bottom cup than Andorra.   Freya balcony plunges also have more room in the bottom cup than Panache Andorra/Jasmine."
ABraThatFits,3cmi3h,khasiv,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:08:02 2015 UTC,Okay. Maybe you would like Freya balcony plunges (e.g. Patsy) or Panache Jasmine?

ABraThatFits,3cmi3h,applesangria,2,Thu Jul 9 03:36:45 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind with them is that Freya bands tend to run large/stretchy, so I would definitely consider a 34 band there, but Panache bands tend to run firm, so you might prefer a 36 band for Jasmine/Envy."
ABraThatFits,3cn5ey,BrittForte,2,Thu Jul 9 05:04:10 2015 UTC,"I recommend starting with 38GG. This is in UK sizing, btw, which is different from US sizing. So look for the UK size on tags when you go shopping.   Check the offline retailer list for stores in your area that carry this size. Nordstrom should have a good selection, including sports bras, if there's one near you. There are also lots of places you can get bras in your size range online, including Amazon.   Could you check out the shape guide and let us know what shape you think your breasts are?"
ABraThatFits,3cn5ey,hurrrrrmione,2,Thu Jul 9 06:03:51 2015 UTC,"There are various methods to calculate your size, each gives different results.   Theoretically there is a range from UK 38E US 38DD to UK 38J US 38M, in practise the thruth is usually somewhere in the middle.  Using various methods I tend end up in the UK 38FF to UK 38GG range most of the time. So try some 38FF and 38GG bras and work from there.   UK 38FF is approx US 38H with Goddess, Chantelle, Anita and other brands and US 38G with Lane Bryant.   UK 38GG is US 38J with Godess, Elila and Aviana.   Panache Andorra is a good beginner bra. Or since you got wide roots, Goddess Keira.   If you got easy access to a LB store with 38/40 G/H cups that would be worth checking out. The quality price ratio is lousy for LB, but they do have some cute designs."
ABraThatFits,3cn5ey,t_maia,2,Thu Jul 9 08:22:33 2015 UTC,"My measurements are as follows:  Underbust  Snug: 42""  Tight: 38""  Bust  Standing: 51""  Bending: 54.5""  Laying: 51.5""  And the calculator put me a 40H/HH. Still not 100% on my projection/fullness, but I'm pretty sure I have narrow roots.  However, I just got my new bras today (just tried them on a few minutes ago, in fact) and I pretty much perfectly fit the Panache Sculptresse in a 40GG. The Curvy Kate Jewel, on the other hand, was a bit too gappy for me in a 40H.   So, in my opinion, start with either 38FF or 38G. I'd suggest looking at bras on Amazon first and aiming for bras with free shipping AND free returns. That way you can order a variety of sizes without having to worry about paying for bras you decide not to keep. If, however, you can find a store near you, I'd opt for that first; trying it on in person is always preferable!  What I did specifically was order 2 40GG bras, a 40H bra, and a 38H bra (the sister size to my 40GG bras). Try finding different shapes/types too to get a better feel for what you like and don't like. For example, the Cleo Maddie I ordered in 38H was a molded cup bra, which I decided I didn't like (at least, not after trying on the other soft cup bras). I was actually grateful I ordered it on Amazon first, as I was considering ordering it from Bravissimo which would have cost me quite a bit as a US customer to ship and return.  What I'd recommend for you is to at least try a 38FF and a 38G, and maybe a bra in a sister size if you want to get a feel for those. If you go the Amazaon route, you might be able to order and try on bras before Prime Day, which will probably have sales on bras."
ABraThatFits,3cmpst,Pachuca__Sunrise,2,Thu Jul 9 02:43:12 2015 UTC,"I am almost certain they won't do this for you. If it's an alteration you're comfortable with, I would just do it myself, or buy shorter wires from a bra supply store. Shortening them yourself seems the easier solution though."
ABraThatFits,3cmpst,khasiv,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:11:20 2015 UTC,A downside to a diy job is the extra fabric that's in the way. I've been experimenting with folding the extra fabric down on the bra I do have.

I would try PL, they're much shorter in the underarm area. The other option, if you can afford to go a bit narrower, is to get a Comexim Plunge or half cup, they have the lowest underarm coverage of any bras I've tried."
ABraThatFits,3cljee,garden-state,9,Wed Jul 8 21:09:17 2015 UTC,"You might want to write to Aerie customer service and tell them your sorrows. First praise their service in general, then grouch that you were not allowed to buy this bra, then beg them to make it available to you."
ABraThatFits,3cljee,t_maia,2,Wed Jul 8 21:24:02 2015 UTC,"I might consider doing that.  It just seems so ridiculous that they carry such a limited amount of bras in store!  I just don't get why they think that's a better marketing tactic than carrying a large range of sizes, to encompass all of their customer base."
ABraThatFits,3cljee,t_maia,5,Wed Jul 8 21:27:29 2015 UTC,"What do you think a test bra is? Aerie is clearly planning to extend their size range to DDD cups, but they are not there yet. Developing new bra sizes based upon existing bras takes time, money and effort. Customers want the bras in 36DDD to have the same great fit as the bras in 36D. That takes specialised skill and knowledge. You cannot just ""make it bigger"", because that is exactly how you end up with bad bras that fit no one."
ABraThatFits,3cljee,t_maia,3,Wed Jul 8 21:45:31 2015 UTC,"I mean, I honestly don't understand what the test bras were for.  They weren't visible anywhere in the fitting room or store and aerie isn't hands on with their bra fitting, so I wouldn't have known they even existed if not for it being sorted into the regular bras by mistake.  I don't really get what their purpose was, as the woman at the cash register seemed shocked that I had it, and like I said, was acting like I was trying to trick her into believing it was with the normal bras.  I don't understand what use they would have to any customers.  So maybe they're just not committed to expanding the sizes yet?  You would think they would want people to know about the availability of larger cup sizes, but I got the exact opposite impression throughout the whole experience."
ABraThatFits,3cljee,hurrrrrmione,2,Wed Jul 8 21:52:03 2015 UTC,"I mean, I honestly don't understand what the test bras were for.    For testing them on customers. Customers are supposed to try them on in the fitting room and the customers and the sales people are supposed to give feedback to the company in question on the fit of the bras. Is the bra a good fit, does it fit the same as the 36DD, is is true to size, is there anything that should be changed?   If they get positive feedback Aerie will massproduce those bras and they will become available for sale. First on their website and then in stores.    They weren't visible anywhere in the fitting room or store   That is to avoid situations like yours - a customer getting angry about not being able to buy a certain bra.    aerie isn't hands on with their bra fitting,    In this case they probably meant their employees to try on the DDD cups and give feedback.    So maybe they're just not committed to expanding the sizes yet?   Yes and no. They clearly have plans to expand their sizes, but they are not a charity. They need to see that there is a profit, that all the effort they are putting into developing new sizes pays off. If the construction of new sizes eats up too much money, it might get scrapped. Plus, they probably don't want competitors (like VS) to know.    You would think they would want people to know about the availability of larger cup sizes,   Yes, they want you to know. But not yet. In about 1-3 years maybe."
ABraThatFits,3cljee,hurrrrrmione,7,Wed Jul 8 22:18:07 2015 UTC,"I do want to clarify a few things.  First, when I say I don't understand what the test bras were for and why they're not visible in the store, I mean that I have never heard the term ""test bra"" used before, and when that comes to mind for me, I would imagine it's used to assess a customer's fit, so it seems confusing to me that they don't have them available for that use.  While your definition of test bra seems to make a lot of sense, I don't know that's how Aerie is defining it either.  The bra I tried to purchase is something that is in production, it's just only available online, so it's not a prototype per say.  My frustration (and I do want to point out that I wasn't an ""angry customer,"" and was completely polite and courteous to the cashier) was that I found a bra on a sales rack among other bras for sale, with tags on it like any bra for sale, so I assumed it was a bra for sale.  When I tried to purchase it, the cashier treated me as if I had tried to steal a bra or something, wasn't very polite, and had an attitude I would sum up as ""You should have known better! Of course we don't sell this size in stores! What were you thinking!""  So my frustration is in part a customer service issue, because I don't think that's how you should treat a customer when I would bet money the error was on the end of the employees, who accidentally put a bra onto the floor that shouldn't have been there.  My frustration is also due to the fact that while the bra is sold online, no attempts are made to help or encourage in-store customers to buy these sizes or to be made aware of them.  I didn't even know Aerie sold that size until I saw it in the store, and none of the displays mention so much as a cup size above D.  Additionally, I would have been willing to order it on the spot, and I was instead told that wasn't possible, basically something like ""if you want it so bad order it yourself.""  Now, it may not seem like a big deal ordering it online yourself vs. placing an in store order, but if I order it online I have to add a $10 shipping fee onto a $30 bra, and am no longer eligible for in store sales, so it seems like less of a good deal for me in that light, and makes me want to think about it more, whereas I would have probably bought that bra on the spot in stores, because it seemed like such a relatively good deal.  It's not that I think that's so expensive for a bra, but I hate the idea that because I'm above a D cup, I suddenly have to pay more for bras.  That's part of the reason why I don't have a bra that fits me right now, because I got sick of purchasing and returning $80 British bras one at a time when they didn't fit, because I couldn't afford to throw down enough money to buy a variety and have a better shot at finding one that did fit.  If their goal is to get more support for the larger sizes before they dive head first into full production of them, this seems like the wrong way to go about it, because they're not marketing them well at all, especially by essentially pretending they don't exist when you visit the stores.  It would have been more helpful to me if the employee had offered to order the bra for me, and I feel like practices like that in general would help increase the awareness of these larger size bras, even something as simple as telling you at the door ""We carry size X through X in stores, and can help you order sizes X through X online!""  Every aspect of this experience just seemed to exemplify what's so off about bra companies in the US, from the treating you like you're an idiot for claiming you're a certain size, to the claiming that they can't make a profit off these sizes when they haven't made real attempts to popularize bras in a size that would actually fit most women."

ABraThatFits,3cm3f7,SmellsLikeDogBuns,4,Thu Jul 9 13:16:36 2015 UTC,"Sister sizes are keeping the same cup volume on different bands. To find your sister size, you do inverses: bigger band= go down a cup size, smaller band= go up a cup size. I still get a little messed up when sister sizing so I really rely on the chart to make sure I'm doing it right.  If you look on the chart for OP's example, the cup volume of a 36G (which is 1580cc) works for them, but not the band size, so you slide down the row to the next band size up.   If she went to 38G, that would be a different size: on the chart, you can see that is one size up at 1810cc. 38G is not the same as 38FF."
ABraThatFits,3cm3f7,EmmaInFrance,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:32:11 2015 UTC,Have you tried the bras on upside down? This would help determine whether it is the band that is too small or the cups size is too small and makes the band feel too tight.

ABraThatFits,3clwpp,foxyillusion,3,Wed Jul 8 22:49:42 2015 UTC,"Band rolling is sadly a fact of bra-wearing. It is not a size problem and there is very little you can do bra-wise. Sometimes it gets better over time, sometimes it does not. There are a few tricks you can use, but this depends upon your bra size and where, how and why the band rolls up."
ABraThatFits,3clwpp,t_maia,3,Wed Jul 8 23:11:40 2015 UTC,Yep! I had that problem when still stuffing myself into 34DDs and now wearing a 28 band. I have flared ribs which I think plays a part.  What I find odd is that I can have 2 nearly identical bras and one will roll and one won't. I think sometimes just stitching can effect roll-ability
ABraThatFits,3clwpp,basylica,5,Wed Jul 8 23:18:05 2015 UTC,"In plush-sized women the placement of the rolls in the backfat is a factor. If the bra band hits a natural ""valley"" it stays put, if it hits a natural ""hill"" it rolls up.   I have this problem with the Tango, the bottom elactic of the band hits me on a ""hill"" and so it rolls up.   The Elomi bras are cut a bit different, their bands are narrower and there the bottom elastic hits me a bit higher into a ""valley""."

ABraThatFits,3cmcpe,SmellsLikeDogBuns,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:28:44 2015 UTC,"I can't seem to find any stores out there that sell UK or other brands that sell non-matrix sizes. You might have to try websites that ship internationally. ASOS does seem to ship there. It's free standard shipping (15 days) if your order is over 20 GBP. Express shipping is an extra 20 GBP (4 days). I did read you might be subject to taxes on top of that. Do you have any family overseas? I'm also Filipino and my mom ships stuff back there in balikbayan boxes every couple of months or so for her family members. So maybe someone can do that for you? It's a hit or miss though because we've had stuff get stolen once they arrive in the Philippines.   Also, you can try to see if people from /r/braswap selling your size would be willing to ship to you. I checked how much 1 bra would cost to ship from here in the U.S. And it's like $12+. It depends on the weight and speed. The problem is, they don't offer tracking services to the Philippines so it might be pretty risky."

One option would be trying Elomi Jocelyn, Lexi or the new Edie - they share the cut with Betty but they have stretch lace in the top section. It could make it fit a bit snugger on your smaller side.  You could get an insert to give the smaller breast a bit of a boost.  Or you could sew the top section a little smaller - just tuck extra fabric under the gore or the strap and sew it in place."

ABraThatFits,3ckd8g,xklinx,5,Wed Jul 8 16:18:59 2015 UTC,"You definitely need to re-size--I read your post in the small questions thread, and your new measurements do indicate 34F/FF. Unfortunately, only one angle for photos doesn't give too much information, although the first bra looks like it's a bit small in the cup, maybe narrow in the wires and not a great match for your shape. The second one looks okay from that view, but there's not enough information there.  You asked in small questions if there are some people who won't get a perfect fit, and I believe that's actually a lot of us--myself included. I don't say that to discourage you, because I don't think you should give up and if you can't get a perfect fit, you get the best and most comfortable that you can.  About the bruising, I wonder if there might be an underlying medical issue. Have you brought it to your doctor's attention? Bruising could be caused or aggravated by an ill fit; bruising in that spot could be a too-tight band (which those don't look to be) or possibly a too-loose band that moves around a lot. If your bras have side boning, that might cause it. Ribbing could cause a mark that goes away, but absent another cause, I don't think it should cause an actual bruise. I do recommend speaking to your doctor about this if it's an ongoing thing."

ABraThatFits,3ckd8g,lauracb,5,Wed Jul 8 18:02:48 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly a wacoal g is smaller than a uk g - they use us sizing. Your measurements suggest you could wear as big as a 32gg or 34g, or as small as 32ff /34f - it could easily be a too small cup and the band needing to contain tissue that is causing the bruising. Because you're planning on loosing more weight, if you get the 32 and a cheap extender the bra may remain useful for longer. I don't know what your previous measurements were but I think a wacoal g is a uk f or ff so you may be losing underbust squish faster than breast tissue. amazon has a bunch of options in that size range and nordstroms has some - do you know what your shape is like so we can give better advice on specific bras?"

The bruising is definitely caused by the purple bra - there is a little boning that digs right into my side belly roll when I sit. When j first got the bra about a year ago, it was unbearable to wear. Now it's on the tightest snaps and I think it's moving around and causing the bruise, so I think sizing down with an extended is a good plan.   I'm not really able to follow the shape guide. My best guess is pendulous and narrow rooted."
ABraThatFits,3ckd8g,atheologist,3,Wed Jul 8 18:00:17 2015 UTC,"Knowing now that the bra has side boning that digs in, it makes sense that that's causing the bruise."

And too-narrow wires tend to pinch on the sides, which can cause bruising. I've had it happen, too, and it is really not comfortable.   Oh..but I just realized you might be referring to side boning that isn't the underwire? If that is the case, you can actually usually remove the plastic piece! I've done it on a bunch of bras -- Freya has a nasty habit of putting plastic side boning in their larger cup sizes and I find it really painful. You just need one of those little seam rippers and you should be able to pick the threads holding the boning in place and pull it out."

ABraThatFits,3ckd8g,ConvertsToMetric,3,Thu Jul 9 01:35:07 2015 UTC,"Congrats on the weight loss!  Your current measurements would put you in a 34FF/G.  How do the bands feel on these 36s?  All of these bras look like the wires are sitting below your IMF, meaning they're too shallow, and the wires look like they could be too wide but it's hard to tell in a padded or lined bra.  You could try Panache Jasmine or Andorra... those should have more projection and allow more space for your boobs in the bottom of the cup.  That alone should help with comfort.  Cleo Marcie, Lily, and Lucy are also good diagnostic bras.  34G puts you at the very bottom of Elomi's size range too - Caitlyn or Etta maybe?  As for padded bras, there aren't much in the way of projected UK bras.  Your measurements and pictures don't scream TONS of projection, but you do appear to have more projection than the bras you're currently wearing.  Possibly Cleo Juna, but size up in the cup since it runs small.  Maybe try it in a 34GG.  You won't get much of a minimizing effect from bras that have proper width wires and enough immediate projection.  Minimizers, by nature, are typically wide and shallow to smoosh your tissue against your body.  Which, if you're comfortable with that, it's up to you but it's not always exactly the best support or shape for your boobs."
ABraThatFits,3ckd8g,lcl0706,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:47:48 2015 UTC,"I appreciate these suggestions. Thanks!  You've got it exactly right - the underwire does sit below my fold, but for some reason I can't get comfortable with it higher. And yes, I think the underwires are too wide for my narrow roots. But neither bra is padded FWIW.   Actually come to think of it, I believe the first bra (beige) is a minimizer. I do prefer to squish my breasts down as much as possible because it works with the button downs and dresses I wear for work."
ABraThatFits,3cmxee,devohr901,2,Thu Jul 9 03:48:22 2015 UTC,So my best guess (without seeing it) is that the bra isn't projected enough at the bottom for you. I've found the Decos in the 28F range to be VERY shallow and that can cause the spilling you're describing. Do the wires sit in your IMF? Almost anything from Curvy Kate will give you more side coverage (a wider cup) but it will also be shallow. You can also look for a style with taller wings and check bratabase for the wire measurements once you know what length works for you. Hope that helps!
ABraThatFits,3cmxee,petitecollegiate,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:13:04 2015 UTC,"The wires do sit in my IMF, which is why I'm a bit worried about sizing up to a 28G because it does fit so well there and in other areas. I'll definitely have to look into Curvy Kate, thanks for that tip! I've heard that the Chantelle Chic Sexy that I love is also a bit shallow, so maybe the Curvy Kate will still work. Thank you!"
ABraThatFits,3cmxee,petitecollegiate,2,Thu Jul 9 14:16:27 2015 UTC,"After seeing the pictures, I would say your main problem with this bra is that it's just too small. You definitely need bigger cups (which will also be wider). Go up atleast one cupsize! This is not how that bra is supposed to fit!"
ABraThatFits,3cmxee,lcl0706,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:11:04 2015 UTC,Thanks! I just ordered the next size up and will be selling this 28FF. Hopefully it'll fit!
ABraThatFits,3cmxee,lcl0706,2,Thu Jul 9 20:15:37 2015 UTC,"This is one of those problems hard to solve without pictures, but I understand if you're not comfortable with that. It could definitely be too shallow, or too narrow, or both. How do the wire marks left on your sides line up with the start of your breast tissue? It's also possible you have a prominent or long tail of spence & you might not find a bra that can solve that. I've learned to deal with my TOS & quit focusing on it. But if the amount of overspill is significant, something is wrong about the shape of the bra for you."
ABraThatFits,3cmxee,lcl0706,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:44:40 2015 UTC,"Just added photos! And I think the problem is that it's just too narrow in the sides. The wire is just below the start of the breast tissue, I'm pretty wide rooted and it's been hard for me to find a bra that covers the entirety of my breast on the sides. I might keep this bra only because of its great fit in other areas, because I am also slowly wondering if this is something I'll just have to deal with. But next time, I think I'm going to look for a bra that's less narrow and with higher wings."
ABraThatFits,3ckrcf,deathrottweiler,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:57:32 2015 UTC,"Here are my thoughts, but take it with a grain of salt as I'm fairly new to this:  From the wrinkling on the bottom of the cups, I would say this bra looks like it's too shallow for you. If you have firmer breasts with some projection, your boobs will push the bra down so the underwires are not in your IMF where they should be. Your description of the underwire pressing against your ribs makes it sound like they are too wide for you, but I'm not sure how you determined that they are too narrow....from the pictures it looks as though the wires encompass your breast on the side.   I'm guessing shape mismatch/too shallow of a bra for you."
ABraThatFits,3ckrcf,oooh_snappp,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:09:29 2015 UTC,"If you want wireless - Freya Deco Softcup.   A bra with relatively soft wires might also do the trick.    The cup size seems fine, altho if I am scoop and swooping properly (I think I am?) it may have a tad of overflow.   This is because the cup has a rim that is relatively closed. The rim curves towards your ribcage and collides with your breasts.    (edit: from digging around, it seems I have wide roots and this bra has a narrow underwire.)   The wires do sit quite far back on you, they are almost under your armpits. So I am not sure it is the wire width. Do you think the wires are sitting on breasttissue?    My main concern is the underwire presses against my ribs, under my breasts near where it starts to curve into my back    Try bending the bra.   http://brasihate.blogspot.de/2012/01/what-to-do-with-those-pesky-wide.html  Another issue that can cause wire problems is if the shape of the cup is wrong for your breasts. In this case the bra can slide down, tilt and dig into your ribs."
ABraThatFits,3ckrcf,t_maia,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:38:33 2015 UTC,"I can see now that like the other person said the cup may be too shallow. I tried bending the wires, ddidn't hellp. I actually cut the wires out and it feels better. The shade still wrinkles at the bottom but for now compared to the wrong size bra I had been wearing, this is soooo  much better. Bra hunting this weekend.  The whole wire width thing confuses the crud out of me, so I could be wrong about it all."

It also really depends on your boob shape which ones will work for you. I say to grab everything in your size and make notes on what works when you go through each piece in the fitting room.  34DDD and 36DDD are different sizes, and your flair says 34G- have you measured yourself lately?

ABraThatFits,3cjmfu,brafittingaccount,4,Wed Jul 8 12:41:19 2015 UTC,"The fit looks really excellent to me. The only explanation I can think of for the shoulders hurting is that maybe the straps don't hit you in quite the right place. Have you had this in any other bras that you've worn? Other than that, I got nuthin'. I like the shape on you and it looks terrific under your shirt. ""They"" sell those silicone strap thingies to take the pressure of bra straps off your shoulders--I wonder if something like that might help?  Edit: something else that occurred to me is that you mentioned losing weight in previous posts. I wonder if you've developed some sensitivities and/or pressure points that are painful now that you have less ""padding"" as it were. Could be you've not noticed it in other bras because you haven't had enough success with the new ones that you've worn them for that long, and your old reliable bra has grown so compatible with you over the years that you don't have these issues with it."
ABraThatFits,3cjmfu,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:05:18 2015 UTC,"Hm, could be. I just put it back on again and I'm going to pay attention to moving the straps left or right (rather than tighter and looser) to see if that helps.   I haven't had this with any other bra in the past, no. The last couple years I was overweight, but before that I was lighter than I am now and I don't remember having a problem like this. The only time that comes close is a million years ago when I was in high school on the cross country running team and I forgot my running bra one day and had to run in my normal bra. By the end of practice my shoulders were screaming at me. But from everyday use, no.  Thanks for the suggestions. I'll see if a second try clears anything up."
ABraThatFits,3cjmfu,Julez22,3,Wed Jul 8 19:08:37 2015 UTC,"I think it looks like a really great fit. The wires don't seem too wide to me either. Mayyybee it will get better if you wear it for a couple days. I think that's worth doing. Otherwise maybe loosen the straps a lot so they barely touch your shoulders? Or perhaps the straps are too wide for you. There's some tutorials on here about moving straps inward, but I don't know how your sewing skills are. I know you've tried a lot of 30 bands before but maybe it could be the band causing the pain, not the straps? Sorry this is so hard! From the pictures it definitely seems that you are close. All I can say is don't give up! (or do give up and just go braless because it can be awesome tbh)"
ABraThatFits,3cjmfu,Julez22,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:07:11 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'm giving it another go on your suggestion! I set the straps so they're pretty loose but no so much that the top of the cup falls down. I'll try shifting them left and right and see if moving the straps could help. My sewing skills are nothing to write home about, but I think I could probably move a strap if needed.  This 28 band feels about the same as other 30s I tried---it was suggested that this particular bra runs stretchy/large in the band and should size down, so I don't think the band is what's doing it. But maybe something to still consider---I'm stumped.   I wish I could go braless! I'm very pendulous/soft and really get no support at all without a bra. It's just too uncomfortable to be walking around without one. Sigh.   Thanks!"
ABraThatFits,3cjmfu,Journey66,2,Wed Jul 8 19:14:38 2015 UTC,I hope it gets better!
ABraThatFits,3cjmfu,Goddess_Keira,2,Wed Jul 8 22:55:39 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I'm not an expert, but.....  Is it possible that your breasts have pushed the cups down enough that this is happening, without it being very visible from the outside? Looking at your 4th and 5th pic there's a darker line near the gore. It seems your breasts might be resting on your chest there (instead of being lifted by the cup)."
ABraThatFits,3cjmfu,Journey66,4,Wed Jul 8 16:56:50 2015 UTC,"Pretty much all of OP's previous fit checks have mentioned this problem. I'm becoming more and more convinced that there are some of us for whom no bra will stay put in their IMF, ever, no matter what the size or shape or style."
ABraThatFits,3cjmfu,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:35:02 2015 UTC,"Argh, maybe you're right. I just updated the album with new photos showing how it had slid down without me realizing. Why, bras, why?!"
ABraThatFits,3cjmfu,Journey66,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:40:53 2015 UTC,"You know, I had thought the bra was staying put and not doing what you're describing, but you're right, I see that dark line now. I just put it back again, on a tighter hook this time, and am paying careful attention to both where the straps sit and whether it's sliding down. And while the band itself has not noticeably moved lower (usually a bra ends up at least a half in lower than where it started) the cups are sliding down a bit. So I think you're right... but... I don't know how to make this stop. Nothing stays put! (Superglue...?)"
ABraThatFits,3cjmfu,Journey66,2,Wed Jul 8 19:22:05 2015 UTC,I think that's why the straps are hurting you. Your breasts are trying to push the band down and the straps are what's keeping it from moving (instead of the band). Because the straps won't let the bra move your breasts end up folded on themselves. I guess a way to test this theory is to see if the bra does move down if you keep the straps very loose?
ABraThatFits,3cjmfu,Journey66,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:38:33 2015 UTC,"This. I think you nailed it. I put the straps looser and although the band still didn't slide down much, my breasts basically folded the whole cup in half like I wasn't wearing a bra at all. They ended up doing their normal pendulous thing with some cup fabric wedged between the IMF. So I guess the straps were holding up the weight of my breasts with little help from the strap and cups.   I don't know what this means in looking for another bra, though. Maybe it's the extra immediate projection in the Gem that makes the cups less supportive for me?"
ABraThatFits,3cjmfu,atheologist,3,Wed Jul 8 19:53:45 2015 UTC,"One thing I would say it means is that pendulous breasts just rely more on the straps to hold the bra up, period. I honestly don't think lack of projection is the problem here. You've tried several bras that looked amazing on you, but none seem to have stayed in the IMF or been comfortable. This bra looks gorgeous on you. So did the Curvy Kate Jewel. Sadly, neither of them seems to feel comfortable for you to wear. I'm not an expert, but they both look projected enough for you.  I have really pendulous breasts and never in my life could I wear a strapless bra. Even though the band is supposed to do 80% of the support, with no straps it's zero support for me. So when you made the straps very loose, the cups collapsed because the weight of your breasts needs the strap to hold them up. And that's not to say you have such extraordinarily heavy breasts as many have much heavier breasts than you do."
ABraThatFits,3cjmfu,MutantToenail,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:45:43 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, that makes sense. I just tried my (much altered, much stretched) old Deauville without straps in comparison, and you're right about how much support the straps give. But the Deauville cups didn't bend right in half and leave my breasts pointing straight down like the Gem. I suspect it's because the Deauville has thicker and stiffer material on the bottom half of the cups, which the Gem is more stretch lace and mesh the whole way. If that's the culprit, then I've learned something valuable from this bra!   I did like the fit of the CK Jewel a lot. If I remember correctly, the wires were really high in my armpits. I'll try to get a CK Bardot next, and maybe that will have the good fit without the underwires trying to escape through my armpits.  This is the only bra so far that has actively hurt; the rest were just uncomfortable or didn't feel supportive for one reason or another (often because of the IMF slip). Maybe I just need to go back to the one that matched the best (CK Jewel or Cleo Lily, I guess) and get used to it.   Thanks for the insight!"

ABraThatFits,3cjkmm,businessowl,3,Wed Jul 8 12:23:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/Goddess_Keira that you're getting some size confusion because of the US vs. UK sizing systems. Glamorise uses US sizing, which means that the 46H is the equivalent of a UK 46FF. The calculator linked to on the sub uses UK sizing. If you scroll down on the calculator site, you'll see a chart that has conversions for US, UK, and EU sizing.  As /u/Shannakitty said, the laying measurement is often the most accurate in your size range/shape, which does put you in a UK 46GG/H or 44H/HH. One of the things that happens when you wear a too-small cup is that the bra's band has to hold some breast tissue that can't fit into the cups, which makes the band feel tighter. Try putting on your 46 bras backwards (so your breasts are not in the cups) to get a sense of how the band really fits. If it feels snug but comfortable, stick with a 46, but I have a feeling that you may actually want to go down to the 44, particularly since bands over a 38 tend to be stretchier."
ABraThatFits,3cjkmm,atheologist,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:52:12 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the confusion, the tag says UK size 46G, US size 46H.  I would say that I definitely have room in the band. I've been basically getting the largest size I can find on herroom and biggerbras."
ABraThatFits,3cjkmm,atheologist,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:39:31 2015 UTC,"Okay, that makes sense. I'd guess that the calculator is overestimating cup size for you, though, which it often does for people who are very pendulous. I suspect that you'll probably end up somewhere between a 44GG (using /u/t_maia's alternative sizing method for larger band sizes, which involves using +5 and then sister sizing down to the correct band size) and the 44HH you get from your laying measurement."
ABraThatFits,3cjkmm,t_maia,3,Wed Jul 8 20:33:05 2015 UTC,"In her case the 44GG will be too small. I know the Glamorise bras (tried several in US 46G because they are easy to get here) and the cups are really tall, meant for a very full-on-top shape and to minimise quadboob. I wear around UK 42GG/H, so my breasts are not exactly small, yet I could probably fit my breasts twice into the cups of a Glamorise in US 46H.   If she is spilling out of those, she needs a larger than I do. So 44H/HH is a good starting point, but I won't be surprised if she needs larger."
ABraThatFits,3cjkmm,dropkickpa,2,Wed Jul 8 21:01:19 2015 UTC,The bust measurement should be across the nipples parallel to the ground.
ABraThatFits,3cjkmm,Shanakitty,6,Wed Jul 8 13:09:54 2015 UTC,"Sort of. It should be across the fullest part of the bust, which is usually at about nipple level, but not necessarily.   OP, please remeasure your standing bust at the fullest point and add that to your post. I think the current number is throwing your results off on the calculator. The laying measurement is usually the most accurate in this size range, and that is pointing to a 44H or so, but if you're spilling out of a UK 46H that badly (though it says 46G in the title, which is correct?), then you probably need at least a 44JJ or 44K, which I'm afraid could be quite difficult to find. I'm not sure what kind of shape Glamorise Magic Lift has, but if it is shallow, then that could be contributing to the problems that you're having. Since you describe yourself as having a very pendulous shape, it's likely that you need a bra with a lot of projection.   Unfortunately, I'm not very familiar with bras in this size range. Hopefully, /u/t_maia will show up, because she is quite knowledgeable in this area."
ABraThatFits,3cjkmm,Goddess_Keira,6,Wed Jul 8 15:20:08 2015 UTC,"Although OP says Glamorise is UK 46H, that brand is US sized and I don't think they make anything that would be equivalent to a UK 46H. Their highest cup size is US J, I think, which is UK GG. So what she has there is most likely ~46FF UK. I'm thinking you are right that the correct size could be in the range of 44J or higher, and that will be hard to find. Might be 44H-HH UK could work for her, though."
ABraThatFits,3cjkmm,joanna70,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:38:07 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the confusion, the tag says 46G for UK size and 46H for US size."

If I measure at the fullest point of my breast, since they hang so far down, that is also almost the fullest part of my stomach. Will that still be an accurate measurement?  Edit: ok, that was a slight exaggeration, not quite the biggest part of my stomach. I measured down where the fullest part of my bust is and it's 55"". When I put that measurement in it says 44JJ/K."

It is designed for someone with a ~34"" underbust and 39"" bust, which is really more of small-medium sized underbust/bust ratio, and is not a very common well-fitted size. This page has women in 34DD and sister sizes, with 30F at the top and 36D/38C at the bottom. Do you feel like the 32E/34DD/36D look about like your size?  It definitely sounds like most of your bras are too small in the cup, and with the straps falling off, may also be too big in the band (a too small cup will make the band feel tighter). It also sounds like you might have a shape mis-match with some of your bras (such as the gaping you're getting in bras with taller cups).   I definitely think it would be a good idea to re-measure."

At 5'6, 140, I would think a 34/36 band being the right size is unlikely but possible; it depends on your build and how muscular you are (women with little ""squish"" are more likely to need a band size above their snug measurement, whereas women with more squish tend to take a band size that is equal to or perhaps slightly less than their snug measurement). I am 5'5, 190 and wear a 32 band, but I have a relatively small rib cage for my size and little muscle. Definitely get back to us when you have your measuring tape!"

ABraThatFits,3ck510,Shanakitty,5,Wed Jul 8 18:11:46 2015 UTC,"Well, sort of, but not exactly. Your standing bust measurement in a bra will underestimate your cup size, but it does imply that you will need something smaller than a 36 band! And probably smaller than a 34 band too, if you're currently in a 34DD (which is designed for a 39"" bust). Sister sizing down, a 30F holds the same volume as a 34DD, and is designed for a 37 inch bust, but since your current bras don't seem to have enough volume, I think something like 30FF/G is in the realm of possibility, depending on your measurements."

But as a society, we tend to be told that ""DD"" is huge and anything above that is insanely massive, which is just not true at all. Only a small percentage of women fit well into the bra matrix sizes that are offered in most stores. Most women wearing 32/34 A/B would do better in 28/30 D/DD/E, and most women wearing any band size of DD/DDD are in the G+ range, but just wearing the largest cup/smallest band combination that they can find in the store."

ABraThatFits,3cj4ei,buymeflowers,3,Wed Jul 8 10:35:37 2015 UTC,"In addition to the Pollyanna based cuts, I would try the Arabella and Patsy based cuts - there's a good chance you'll have luck with some of them as well."
ABraThatFits,3cj4ei,buymeflowers,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:54:48 2015 UTC,Do other brands have similar cuts?
ABraThatFits,3cj4ei,lcl0706,2,Wed Jul 8 14:19:33 2015 UTC,"In your size range, Cleo and Panache would work best, UK wise. I took a peek at the Lily and think it's worth retrying a cup size up, (I have heard a few reports that aqua Lily ran small in the cup, and I'm inclined to agree, it was definitely small when I tried it, but it has taken so long to arrive that at least part of the issue was that my breasts had increased in size). I'd also give Marcie a shot if it's available with free returns. That's probably it for Cleo.  Panache Jasmine and Envy are quite versatile, and would be most likely to fit well out of all of panache's offerings."
ABraThatFits,3cj4ei,buymeflowers,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:44:09 2015 UTC,"You may have luck with Curvy Kate's newer plunges - the measurements for a 28HH Dreamcatcher are very similar to the 28HH Flourish you're wearing, although CK's bands are tighter so you may sister size to the 30H.  I have tried the Princess and found it too wide and shallow.  Dreamcatcher clones include Emily, Ella, and Romance.  You may or may not find CK's plunges to be wider in the wires - some BTB measurements are and some are narrower.  Accuracy of BTB measurements is dependent on the user lol.  CK also has 2 brand new lower gore plunges called Daisie and Dare.  No guarantees on Curvy Kate, some get along with the brand and some don't.  I do think their unlined bras, especially the newest models, are much more projected than their padded or molded bras."
ABraThatFits,3cj4ei,joanna70,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:18:02 2015 UTC,"Well, 30H is my normal size, I guess (except of Freya's bras). I've tried Curvy Kate Daisie Plunge Bra 30HH, but it fits weird. Not sure if it may work better in 30H. I'm surelly going to make a fit check post about it later today."
ABraThatFits,3cj4ei,Moonforehead,2,Wed Jul 8 15:45:24 2015 UTC,"Daisie plunge is a very strange cut off bra in your size range. I'm almost tempted to say it's badly designed, because I can't imagine it actually fitting anyone in the small band/large cup category (I tried it in 32HH and it was abysmal).  Bardot and Jewel are both promising. Starlet (padded) gets mixed reviews but I was impressed when I tried it, however the discrepancies in reviews could be due to  different colorways running shallow. Its the only CK padded/molded bra I would currently suggest, though there's some new padded models for SS15 that aren't really well known yet, they might end up being great."
ABraThatFits,3cktk9,oxterbra,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:12:26 2015 UTC,"The underwire digging into your side from the Cleo lily could be the style of the cup having higher cup sides? Than what you need. Or it's possibly that if you're shallow it's actually digging into breast tissue and hurting, can't tell without seeing. Regardless I agree with sending it back, that kind of pain you shouldn't need to deal with.   For the freya starlet, that could be a shape issue as well. I sometimes have minor gaping at the top of bras meant for even or FoT beasts but I'm slightly FoB. That's either a fix by finding bras meant for a difference in shape or not if its comfortable. You definitely do not want to adjust the straps so they're supporting most of the weight, you're correct in thinking that should be the band. From what I've been told, freya bands are stretchy so you might do well sister sizing it if the band isn't supporting enough.   Armpit fat: do you mean your actual armpit is fatty or that space of fat when you have your arms down next to your boobs? I used to have more fat at my arm bend when I was wearing an ill fitting bra, but now have barely any as it's made its home in my bra so it could go either way.   With your weight loss, I can tell you that no one will know exactly how your body will react. You still have 2 inches to lose to worry about the band size, which I wouldn't worry honestly. My snug is 30.5 and tight 28.5 and I still wear a 32 usually. I have one 30g. The cup size might change, either up or down depending.    Any recommendations for 32FFs with a high band to lessen Spence?   I don't know why you want to lessen my dad (spence hehe). I am not sure what you meant here so clarifying would help point you in the right direction :)"
ABraThatFits,3cktk9,Moonforehead,2,Wed Jul 8 20:55:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!  And no need to lessen your dad!  Sorry I didn't edit my post fully - With spence I was referring to Tail of spence which I thought was armpit fat, not the little bit of skin/fat/tissue that you have with your arms down by your boobs. I took that out of my post when I realized it was armpit fat that was causing the issue - must have missed a reference to it though!  Yeah it seems I just have a lot of armpit fat, and where it lies makes it seem like a wider band/wing that goes higher into the armpit might disguise it/tuck it in.    Having read around a bit more i think that underwire in the Lily was actually digging into my breast tissue. It's defo going back tomorrow!  The gaping has almost disappeared if I just sit up straight! It's been a good posture reminder all afternoon actually.  After looking in the mirror it seems I'm pretty FOT, which would correlate to the lifetime of quadboob that I've experienced so far."
ABraThatFits,3cktk9,Moonforehead,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:08:17 2015 UTC,"My dad could use a bit lessening, he is a big guy :p  And alright that makes sense with the post edit. My curvy Kate's have had higher wings on them, that might help you. I prefer a smaller wing but bigger ones rarely irritate me.   If that Cleo was digging into breast tissue, that's a sign you might need a wider cup. Or possibly just a different style of Cleo. The Marcie gets recommended for me being FoB.   Check out braswap for some bras to try on while you're working out what shapes and styles you're going to fit in best as well."
ABraThatFits,3cktk9,Moonforehead,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:13:50 2015 UTC,"Ok I'm going to be a real dumdum here, but does a wider cup mean a different size, or just a wider FF cup? The underwire of the Freya bra seems to go back further towards the armpit than the Lily?  I'll check out bra swap and Curvy Kate and possibly a Cleo Marcie, I love the Cleo designs - thanks!"
ABraThatFits,3cj999,the-stain,12,Wed Jul 8 10:02:15 2015 UTC,"I just want to gush for a while about the bras I just received today (I'm considering a recommendations thread for one, but that remains to be seen).   The Full Story: As a plus-sized girl, I've always assumed that the problems I had with my bras were because I was fat (making bra shopping for me more shameful and embarrassing than anything). I felt quite a bit better, however, after discovering stores like Torrid and Lane Bryant that actually sold non-granny-styled bras in my size; even though most of them were pretty plain, I considered myself lucky that they even existed at all (and again, just wistfully looked at the prettier ""skinny-girl"" bras and assume they weren't meant for girls like me).  For most of my bra-wearing life, I suffered through the various monstrosities most stores marketed as ""plus-size bras"" - the pointy-coned ""grandma harness"", the wire-""free"" flap containers, and the painfully plain kind-sorta okay other bras that I tried to stuff myself into. Eventually, I settled into a 44DDD after finally discovering Lane Bryant's Cacique store and have religiously bought bras from them for the past 5 or so years. It was never really good enough, but (again) I just accepted the quad-boob, back fat, and band-slippage to being fat.  Then, about two months ago, someone happened to reference this subreddit in a comment, so I came here. At first, I was pretty skeptical of the sizes I saw in posts on the front page (""there can't be THIS many girls who fit GGs, come on"") but I gave the beginners guide a chance. When I first saw the table on Good vs. Poor Fit, I was sold. I had never once thought that skinny girls had the same problems with their bras as I did - I never even realized that the gore was supposed to touch the sternum!   With that info in hand, I eagerly measured myself (for the first time ever) and was calculated to be a 40H/HH. Thanks to all the posts and suggestions I've seen here and on the guides, I eventually decided to order 2 40GG bras, a 40H, and a 38H. And the choices I had were amazing - there were so many pretty bras in my sizes!  When I tried on that first bra, I (and this sounds kind of cheesy) felt like a new woman. I finally found the sexy, lacy bras I'd always wanted! And, for the first time ever, I could be picky about the fit of my bras. I felt lucky to have the Cacique balconettes ""fit"" me; now, I can return two of the bras I originally bought and be confident that I can find a better fit - and that I actually deserve one.  (Holy shit, I just realized how long this was. My bad.)"

ABraThatFits,3cj999,noys,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:11:19 2015 UTC,"Projected and full all over. It's not as projected as Lily or Jasmine but it won't work for shallow shapes as it's too narrow and projected. It would be great for tall roots though.  HP runs a bit small in cup compared to HM, well, at least all the ones until this HP have, this is surprisingly true to size.  Band stretchiness is variable like if always is with EM.

ABraThatFits,3cj999,-tallywa-,7,Wed Jul 8 20:15:54 2015 UTC,"Yes you can. Some specialty boutiques won't let you browse on your own so you have to have one of the associates bring bras to you, but you'll always be able to try them on first."

The band fits as long as I use the middle or tightest hooks. My left breast fills out the cup, but my right one is significantly smaller and leaves the cup gaping and wrinkled at the top. I'm definitely fuller on the bottom that the top. I tried adjusting the left shoulder strap tighter, but it didn't help.   Any suggestions?"

I believe you usually put them at the bottom of your bras as like a 'boob bump' and if you get a silicone one it probably isn't good to sew them. If you're worried about them slipping around, you could maybe sew little pockets for them, or look for Polish brands who make asymmetry bras with those items already built in."

So I just got back from watching Minions, and, well, not really a spoiler for anything, but the villain, Scarlet, kept yanking her strapless dress up in the movie. Only two or three times, but I kept thinking- Scarlet, you're in too large of a band. If you were in a bra that fits you wouldn't have to keep pull it up.

I've been following this sub for the last couple years and I've been through a lot of bras before finding what I think is my size (34FF). Then I lost 30 lbs so it's back to the drawing board.   The reason I say ""I think"" I found my size is because I wasn't ever really happy with how my new bras felt: specifically, in the proper size, the cups don't provide enough support for my liking, and I get bruising from where the band ribbing digs into my rib age.   My question is, does anyone have similar experience even after trying for a long while? Where you just don't seem to have a ""correct"" size? I can't even say how frustrating this is, and I don't even want to think about all the money I've dropped on bras in the last two years, that are collecting dust with the tags still on."
ABraThatFits,3cj999,-tallywa-,7,Wed Jul 8 12:15:12 2015 UTC,"I mean it looks like you never posted here, at least not on this account, so without more info we can't really tell you why you never found a comfortable bra. We stress personal preference and comfort here, so of course it is up to you to decide if you want to try to find a bra in your measured size or if you want to stick with whatever you were wearing before.  If we knew your actual measurements and what bras you tried in what sizes, we might be able to take an educated guess at what the problem was. But in the end, if it isn't comfortable then it doesn't fit.  Now that you've lost the weight, if you do want to keep trying I would suggest making a measurement check first and then fit checks for bras that you try. We can help you figure out if maybe you're just more comfortable in a slightly looser band, if you have shape incompatibilities, etc."
ABraThatFits,3cj999,xklinx,3,Wed Jul 8 12:46:52 2015 UTC,"You're right, I don't think I ever posted for a fit check. I'll do my own thread in the next day or so, list measurements and the brands I've tried, and maybe I can get some feedback for my new size. Thanks."

ABraThatFits,3cj999,-tallywa-,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:29:46 2015 UTC,Bands can feel too tight or cause pain even when they are too loose. In fact many women find that a slightly too large band is much more uncomfortable than a much too large band (and a band of the right size) because it moves around while still being more in contact with your skin.  Bruising is never normal so you'll definitely want to remeasure and make a separate post.  Edit: Just saw you did make that post. Your size range isn't my area of expertise but it looks like you've gotten a number of responses already.

I'm not used to paying really more than $25 for a bra, so when I see a bra that's anywhere between $50-$60, I'm not so quick to buy it. Especially when it's a soft cup bra.

Save cheap headline prices for later when you know what fits :).  ""Soft cup"" bras are usually more expensive, they are all graded differently and take a lot more work to make and design than a padded moulded cup.

ABraThatFits,3cj999,Kalegina,2,Fri Jul 10 23:15:54 2015 UTC,"I need some help fellow breast owners! I've recently decided that I need to find an actual bra that fits and I'm getting there. I sized myself a couple weeks ago as a 30GG/H UK sizing, full on top, medium roots. I ordered the panache jasmine 30G and cleo marcie 30GG, but both bands were waaayyy too tight (and the marcie cup was a bit large) so I sent them both back for 32G, as that's my sister size. I got the panache jasmine today and while it fits better than any other bra I've owned (yay for actual support and not just a boob hovercraft!!), I put it on and it's been creaking and sounds like a 16 year old trying to avoid the creaky step to sneak off to a party with her crush, all while I've been walking around my apartment, eating pizza and playing with my newly fitted boobies. So my question is basically... do any of you have experience with noisy bras? Did I get a defective one or is it a sign that it's not the right fit?  I apologize if it's been discussed here before but I couldn't find too many threads on it. So... anyone have thoughts or advice on a loud bra?"

This is the first time I have worn it in months. It's SUPER comfortable, and the only type of bra that fits my one-size-bigger-than-the-other breasts and doesn't dig into my armpit-folds.

Some are adhesive, probably. I think the silicone ones are supposed to be re-usable, and I'm sure most users of these products would have similar concerns to yours, so most likely the manufacturers have taken them into account. Maybe somebody will be able to suggest some good brands. If necessary you could make a separate post asking for nipple cover recommendations, or search Amazon or Bare Necessities or HerRoom for products and reviews."

If there is no other underlying medical issue the most likely explanation is that you currently don't have enough strength in your fingers, hands and arms to do it. This is a fitness problem.

It does take some practice, and a bit of flexibility - some people just can't, or don't want to bother and that's okay.  Also, some people whose waist is smaller than their underbust can hook in front at the waist, spin, and pull it up into place. A bit less stretching and tugging the band, I think is the idea."

I first noticed this after I'd been on prednisone and gained weight but figured when the weight was gone so would this - idk how to explain it -  it's like my boobs start higher up on my chest so then i started wondering if crappy bras mashing me upward and inward could cause this sort of boob migration.

It's pretty normal to have breast tissue very high on your chest. I suppose tissue migration could cause this to happen, but it's also possible that your breasts have always started this high and you didn't really notice prior to the weight gain. Another possibility is that the weight gain and loss changed your shape slightly."

It is SOOOOO soft and pretty but WHOA, the fit is awful. I read a bunch of reviews on bratabase and elsewhere so I'm not all that surprised, but WOW. First: the wires are super wide. Second, the side panel is cut in a way that causes a strange distribution of tissue. Third, the lace on the top of the cup digs in IN THE MIDDLE of the bra creating the strangest, most unflattering silhouette in clothes I think I have ever seen. Think quadboob but worse.   The design reminds me of the newer Panache Olivia that I tried on a few weeks ago and could not get a good fit in my size or sister size.   I'd like to figure out exactly what makes a balconette like Emily and Olivia not work for larger cup sizes/softer tissue while Ewa's full cup balconettes are constructed in a way that flatters those sizes and shapes."

I know the wires in Freya bras tend to get unstable above a G or so cup. I'm not sure if the Juna runs as small in your band/cup combo, but I would recommend trying it in a 36GG and 36H. Also, according to bratabase, the band on the 34H stretches to 36"", so that might be an option too, depending."
ABraThatFits,3cl07i,t_maia,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:05:47 2015 UTC,"Above a FF/G Cleo gets relatively narrow. At H-cup the Cleo Juna is actually one of the narrower bras out there, so I doubt it is going to work in 36GG."
ABraThatFits,3cl07i,cupcakery,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:22:04 2015 UTC,"Per bratabase, the 36H Cleo Juna is the same width as the 36GG Freya Patsy half-cup, if we're going to consider that the Juna runs a cup small. It also has a deeper cup and, at least in my experience, a bit sturdier than the Freya half-cups. The Juna has a full half inch over the Marcie in width and to my surprise the Juna is actually deeper... Bratabase comparison link for the curious."
ABraThatFits,3cl07i,t_maia,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:32:11 2015 UTC,"Per bratabase, the 36H Cleo Juna is the same width as the 36GG Freya Patsy half-cup,   That is a normal difference between wide wires vs narrow wires. You will find a similar difference between the Freya Patsy Plunge Balcony and the Freya Patsy Halfcup.   But this is only one half of the story. Bratabase tells you nothing about how the wires fit when worn.   This is where the soft and stretchy wires of Freya come into play. Cleo wires are very durable and non-stretchy, so the measurements of the Cleo Juna are more or less the same unstretched as when stretched and worn. But Freya Patsy wires get significantly wider when worn, I would estimate up to about one inch in 36GG.    if we're going to consider that the Juna runs a cup small.   Juna runs smallish in the 28-32  D/DD/E range, but not in the larger sizes.    The Juna has a full half inch over the Marcie in width and to my surprise the Juna is actually deeper   So much for the Juna running small."
ABraThatFits,3cl07i,t_maia,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:42:21 2015 UTC,"Depends how much projection you need.   If you can do with shallowish cups and have relatively firm breasttissue, most halfcups will serve. Especially Freya halfcups have very wide wires.   Curvy Kate is a great brand for this shape, especially the older bras like Princess or Ghia/Gia. CK Smoothie is also known for being very open on top, so this would be another option to look at.   Finally there is the Goddess Alice, the Goddess Clara and the Elila 1305. Not the prettiest bras out there, but great heavy lifters."

Many women are very uncomfortable posting pictures of their breasts online so requesting them in any situation where they are not needed to provide help to the OP is not allowed.

ABraThatFits,3cikia,little_echo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:42:58 2015 UTC,"This bra fits you great!!  Looks fantastic!!  I believe Tutti Rouge's Nichole is very similar in cut and fit, possibly runs a cup size big per some reviews.  It's unfortunately the only TR bra that is similar, as the rest of their line is quite wide and shallow.  Not very many UK bras are like Lily.  Cleo Erin is this season's Lily replacement, if you can handle the colors of it.  More Lilys are always an option haha!!  Freya's unlined plunge balcony bras - Arabella, Siren, and Starlet come to mind - are pretty narrow wired and projected, but most (except Gem and Rio) are better for FOB breasts and the fit of this Lily really suggests you have even fullness.  Could be worth a shot though.  For a lined/""padded"" bra, Comexim will be your best bet.  Your corresponding Comexim size would be 65J - at least that's a good starting place, so maybe look around on braswap, bratabase, and the facebook group for some secondhand ones to try?"

I'm thinking about getting another in the magenta, but am curious about the color. The orange of the strap on mine shows through on a lot of shirts, but I'm considering whether that's just the contrast with the dark colors of the cup.

ABraThatFits,3ci8cp,qwicksilfer,2,Wed Jul 8 02:49:52 2015 UTC,"34FF is a good estimate from your measurements, yes. 34F is also possible.   Here's some pictures of women wearing properly fitted 34F bras and here's some pictures of women wearing properly fitted 34FF bras. Hopefully that helps with the ""sticker shock"" :)  In this size range your store options are mostly Nordstrom and lingerie boutiques that cater to larger cup sizes. If there's a Dillards near you, they should have this size as well. Check out the offline retailer list for stores in your area that carry this size. There are also lots of places where you can order bras online, including Amazon."
ABraThatFits,3ci8cp,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:59:38 2015 UTC,"Well, the 34F looks...actually much more like my boobs than 34FF. 34FF seems bigger.  I guess I'd prefer to try one on before I buy it from Amazon, but I'll definitely check out Dillard's! Thank you!"
ABraThatFits,3ci8cp,hurrrrrmione,2,Wed Jul 8 03:09:55 2015 UTC,"You're welcome!  When you're shopping at a store, look for the UK size on tags. Unfortunately, different US bra manufacturers label their cup sizes differently after DD, so a UK 34F is not a 34G in every US brand. (This is why the calculator and this sub uses UK sizing, which is consistent.)"
ABraThatFits,3ci8cp,Julez22,2,Wed Jul 8 03:16:14 2015 UTC,"Remember, cup size isn't static. There isn't anything such as a ""D cup""--it depends on band size. A 38D is equal in volume to a 36DD, a 34E, and a 32F. Really, most of the brands we rec around here carry that size, and, as PP pointed out, even some stores carry them. The same can't be said for 28 bands... Also, most of these brands use UK sizing, which is what you should assume brands use as a general rule. But if you go to an actual US store it could be less sure, so try a range of 34FF-G-GG-H (sounds like a lot when you write it out :P) Or just check the tag for the UK size (they usually have multiple countries on there). Determining your shape is also helpful with finding the best size/brand/bra for you."
ABraThatFits,3ci8cp,Julez22,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:21:16 2015 UTC,I found a really awesome 36DDD that fit like a glove :)  It was also like $60 :(   But $60 for no more pain is definitely worth it!
ABraThatFits,3ci8cp,Julez22,2,Wed Jul 8 18:32:40 2015 UTC,"Ok, as long as you're comfortable, that's what matters! I just would question whether all your tissue is encompassed since it's a couple cup sizes down from what you measure as (does the gore tack, band on the loosest hook lie completely straight, did you swoop and scoop? and there's still no quading in the middle or sides?) Just making sure! Because you should be able to find bras $60 or cheaper in the 34FF-H range. Even with ordering online! We're here for you if you're unsatisfied ever, but support you in finding what you're comfortable in!"
ABraThatFits,3ci2ti,catashtrophes,3,Wed Jul 8 02:03:43 2015 UTC,"It could be shape issues definitely, but have you tried a cup size down at all? See how a 28E goes? You've been trying 28F's and 30E's which are sister sizes so you won't see much difference there?"
ABraThatFits,3ci2ti,Bulbysaur123,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:47:02 2015 UTC,"I'll give that a try, thanks!"
ABraThatFits,3ci2ti,joanna70,2,Thu Jul 9 01:15:52 2015 UTC,"Ok, sister sizes.  28F/FF are your two main possible sizes, sister sizes are always on a different band, so 26FF/G and 30E/F, going up or down a cup size when going down or up a band size.  26 bands are available from very few places and will be too tight on you, in very tight bands you may well want a 30 band.  It's about having the same cup volume - 28FF is not a sister size of 30E, 30E is a sister size of 28F, up a band size so down a cup size.  Can you assess which of those bras had the right width wires, if any?  Starting with that then helps you assess cup shape better.  If wires are too narrow then it's a no-no for a start, and the cup will usually seem too big and too small at the same time.  If wires are much too wide then the cup will usually be too shallow, for instance wrinkling in the Porcelain is probably because your boobs are actually TOO full at the bottom, and the cup is shallow on the bottom, lacking the ""immediate projection"" that you need.  Lucy is the most projected of those bras and does seeom too big, but if the wires are too narrow and on breast tissue then that will account for the middle of the cup being too deep.  It might be worth a try in 28E, your measurements, having over 2"" between bust measurements, indicate you're probably not shallow and are likely to be at least moderately projected.  Cleo Marcie would be an idea too, perhaps both in 28E/F.   Cleo Maddie is a wide shallow bra.  If you're ""full on top"" (FOT) then if the wires are too wide Cleo Marcie is narrower but the right shape, FOT.  Again, how do you think the wires of Maddie are on you?"
ABraThatFits,3ci2ti,joanna70,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:39:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your detailed response! Realize I misspoke when I called the 28FF a sister size! Still figuring out the bra lingo. :)   In terms of the wires, they do seem too wide on Cleo Maddie. The wires on Lucy actually seem to be the best of the bunch.   The others are either too wide in the middle (as with Maddie, which also seems to sit too low) or the wires extend on the sides all the way under my armpits. Based on a visual guide linked here I'm now thinking that I have narrow roots.   Also, I see people mentioning this in other threads so I'll include that I lost 60+ lbs around 6-7 years ago and my boobs have never recovered :( They're pretty soft, saggy, squishy. I'm wondering if that's part of the issue with some of these?   It sounds like I should order some 28Es so I'll give that a shot and look to try a Cleo Marcie too.   Thank you!"
ABraThatFits,3cih8u,Melksnake,3,Wed Jul 8 04:09:46 2015 UTC,"The wires look like they might be too narrow. Try wearing the bra for a bit, then taking it off and seeing where the marks from the underwire are in relation to the side of your breast tissue."
ABraThatFits,3cih8u,hurrrrrmione,3,Wed Jul 8 05:09:02 2015 UTC,I noticed that the wires might be too narrow as well.  I do think the tight band might be contributing to armpit chub and you might be happier in a 36 band.  Another consideration is that the narrow wires could be causing the band to be too tight.
ABraThatFits,3cih8u,syrashiraz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:28:47 2015 UTC,What would indicate the wires being too narrow? Marks being on the side of the breast tissue? Any recs for bras with wider wires?
ABraThatFits,3cih8u,hurrrrrmione,2,Wed Jul 8 05:42:41 2015 UTC,"If the marks are on your breast tissue, then the wires are too narrow. The wires should be wider than your breast tissue, and ideally they would sit just outside it (just like the wires should be sitting directly below your IMF)."
ABraThatFits,3cih8u,khasiv,2,Wed Jul 8 05:52:46 2015 UTC,"I absolutely think the bra is the wrong size, not just narrow wires, but overspill. A 38DD > 36E > 34F. Many people go down two sizes in the band and up two cup sizes. I would try this again in 36FF given your measurements."
ABraThatFits,3cih8u,j_sunrise,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:45:08 2015 UTC,"Should 36FF be the size I try first for other bras, or is this something that will just depend on the brand?"
ABraThatFits,3cih8u,lcl0706,3,Wed Jul 8 15:22:57 2015 UTC,Probably more like 36F which already is a cup size bigger than 34F.
ABraThatFits,3cih8u,khasiv,2,Wed Jul 8 16:19:05 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking.  I think a 36FF would be overkill.  One band up is 36, and then to go up one cup too would still be F, (36E would be the sister to what you already have).  Try a 36F."
ABraThatFits,3cih8u,ericazibby,3,Wed Jul 8 20:28:12 2015 UTC,Sizing will depend a little bit on the model -- many of us have bras in many different sizes -- but I still think that trying two sizes up should help with the containment issues here.

Tess, which is currently out in Ivory, looks very much like Melissa in terms of cut (I immediately thought of Melissa when I saw it) and I can confirm Carol soft cup as soon as I get an order in I'm expecting. I just thought of Nina!  I know those wires are softer in the larger cups. I have a 36E and a 38G and the wires in the larger cup are definitely different from the ones in the smaller.

ETA: Minnie is the new season version of melissa I've been told but it's very closed on top and my even boobs get a bit of quadding in it so I doubt it would work well for your FOT boobs.

I would try a 30F/FF in Freya half cups as a starter though it would be good to really try and work out if the wire width is good, too narrow or more than 1/2"" too wide for your root/breast tissue.

The freya padded half cup I have gaps at the top, it pretty much has all of the problems of the flourish longlines, just worse. The parfait digs at the top but there's empty space in the front, 30F. It's a molded cup though. I think I need about as wide of a wire as they come in my size, because as far as I can tell, I don't have an IMF or any sort of crease at all on the side, even pushing on my breast to try to create one. the sides of my bras are always full of breast tissue."

Could you please post your five measurements, per the Beginner's Guide on the sidebar? I can't say for sure without measurements, but to ""sister-size up"" means getting a larger band and a smaller cup size. My guess is that you need the same or a smaller band size, and a substantially larger cup size. The fact that your straps are too short suggests to me that you're having to loosen them right out to compensate for the fact that there isn't enough fabric in the cups to cover your breasts and hold them up where they should sit. You have strap over your breasts where there should be cup coverage, most likely."

ABraThatFits,3ch470,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:21:18 2015 UTC,Did you round any of the other measurements or just the laying bust? Putting in your measurements to the calculator without rounding the laying bust measurement gives an estimate of 28F/FF.
ABraThatFits,3ch470,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:00:13 2015 UTC,"I tried to put in the 35.5 but it gave me an error, so I rounded up. None of the other measurement were rounded.  *Edit Tried it again with the 35.5 and actually read the whole message. I feel like a goof, it was not an error. My bad! Thank you much for pointing that out."
ABraThatFits,3ch470,lcl0706,2,Wed Jul 8 00:01:29 2015 UTC,"No, it's okay!   So the sister size of 28F/FF is 30E/F. The calculator and this sub use UK sizing, which goes A B C D DD E F FF. You can see the full list and the approximately equivalent US sizes here. I say 'approximate' because different US bra manufacturers label their cup sizes differently after DD, so the chart isn't accurate for every US brand (which is why we use UK sizing, which is consistent). So if you go shopping in stores, you'll want to look at the tags for the UK size.   I also recommend Nordstrom! Lots of selection in your size range, including sports bras. You can also check the offline retailer list to see if there are any other stores in your area that carry your size."
ABraThatFits,3ch470,HootyMyBoobs,0,Wed Jul 8 00:11:01 2015 UTC,"Ok, from your measurements I'm getting 28FF/G as your UK size, and 28H/I as your US size.  Please do yourself and all of us a big favor and stick to UK sizing, as it is far more consistent and less confusing, and any bra that fits you will most likely be a UK brand anyways.  Sister sizing is what you're talking about by changing band/cup sizes, and theoretically with a 28/26 UB measurement you could get away with a 30 band.  UK sizing....  28FF = same volume as 30F  28G = same volume as 30FF  28GG - same volume as 30G  It's unlikely you are going to find any of those sizes in any store.  You might, in Panache or Freya at Nordstroms - but you will want 28 bands in Freya as they are very stretchy and long, and in my experience in Chicago's Oak Brook Nordstroms - they don't carry 28 band anything.  In fact, didn't even know Freya made 28 bands... smh.  If you absolutely insist on a US size, look for a 30DDD, which would be a UK 30F, or a 30DDDD which should be a UK 30FF but I haven't looked at a US bra in ages so don't quote me on that.  A 30DD is a UK 30E - which is gonna be way too small on you.  Here's the problem with US brands in a 30DDDD - if you can find it, it's probably made by Wacoal, and it's probably going to be very wide wired and shallow.  I don't know if you've checked out the shape guide in the Beginner's Guide, but judging simply from the difference in your standing and leaning OB measurements, you have quite a bit of projection and I'd doubt you are shallow at all.  Wearing a shallow bra while you have projection means the underwires will not stay put in your IMF and the bra will slide down over the day and wrinkle/fold at the bottom of the cup and you'll lose support and coverage.  I have literally your EXACT measurements, except I'm 35 laying.  I am extremely narrow rooted and immediately projected, and wear a 28G in anything UK except for Freya unlined plunge bras I wear a 28FF.  I have had zero luck with most UK padded bras, as they're all too shallow.  Side note - the UK use ""padded"" to refer to a bra that isn't unlined, but isn't necessarily molded/seamless, it just has a light layer of lining that doesn't add volume to your chest.  I digress.  I also came from wearing VS 32DD and 32DDD's.  So, hello boob twin!!  Have you determined your fullness?  Is most of it on top, bottom, or even while leaning over 90 degrees, or while your breasts are reasonably well supported?  Your shape and fullness will make just as much difference as your tagged size in the way a bra fits, or doesn't.  I suggest hopping on Amazon, getting a Prime trial membership if you don't have it, and buying a few bras in a couple different sizes and returning (for free!) the ones that don't work.  Classic starter/diagnostic bras include the Cleo unlined bras - Marcie, Lily/Erin, and Lucy.  Also possibly Panache Jasmine, Floris, Envy, or Andorra.  Try one or more, in both 28FF and 28G, and report back (and post a fit check if comfortable doing so).  Even if the idea of an unlined bra makes you want to tear your boobs off (I hated them at first), Cleos are known for giving a fabulously lifted and rounded shape and an unlined bra will not mask potential fit issues like a padded or molded bra will.  Plus, you might surprise yourself at how much you like them - I live in my Cleo Lily now.  If you want to try a lined/padded bra, Cleo Juna might be a good bet, but it runs at least a cup size small, so I'd seriously recommend trying at least a 28G if not a 28GG.  Hope all this helps, and good luck!"

ABraThatFits,3chmui,Level10slizzard,10,Tue Jul 7 23:52:09 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that a cup letter doesn't mean anything without the band size.  A 34D is equivalent in volume to 32DD and 30E, while 32D is equivalent in volume to 30DD and 28E.  So why would the calculator suggest a volume equivalent to what you already wear if the fit you have now is so terrible? Because volume is only part of the equation. A 30E holds the same volume, but its shorter band holds the cups snug to your body so that they can't gape away. The wires will be slightly narrower while the cup is slightly deeper/more projected forward.   The good news is that you were already in the right ballpark, you were just wearing the wrong proportions. The cups gape because the band is too loose to hold them to your body. The straps slip because the bra isn't being held firmly and the wide band places them too far apart for your frame. Most people in too large bands try to compensate by shortening the straps as far as possible to create lift and secure the bra in place. Ouch for your shoulders at any size, though it becomes more obvious as breasts get larger and heavier.  There is another piece of the fit puzzle, and that is your shape. 90% of bras sold in mall stores are the same shape, or only vary slightly, and that shape is full coverage and shallow. That's fine if you have tall, shallow breasts, but there are a lot more shapes out there than that! Check the shape guide if you haven't yet.  Finally, yes, I would put you in a 30E, and potentially even a 30F depending on your shape. We can make recommendations for specific bras once we know more about that."

ABraThatFits,3chmui,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:27:31 2015 UTC,"If it helps, I used to wear 34DD or 34E (one too small, one way huge) and struggled with a droopy appearance, lots of bounce, and slipping straps, too... and I was really a 30GG (so I wasn't mich bigger than you). These days a store would probably try to ""fit"" me in a a 36D or 34DD but I wear  30FF (still close to your size).  My boobs didn't change, but my bras sure did! The 30FF-G-GG bras fit securely, don't gape, don't move, and eliminated 80% of bounce."

Are you wearing tops that would show bra straps if you weren't wearing a strapless bra, or maybe you just prefer the fit you're getting from strapless bras?"

Also, I like that there isn't generally an 'upper part'. I don't have a lot of volume up too, so my bras have a ton of empty space up there. Strapless bras are more...cup-ish? If that makes sense."

Going down 1 band sizes, and technically up only two cup sizes. The difference is incredible!! I put on my old bra after a few days and I was like OMG HOW DID I THINK THIS FIT?!?! I thought for sure the cups we're going to be huge full coverage honkers, but they are perfect. I was constantly pulling up my straps in my old bra because the band was too big (therefore the straps were spaced to wide). Now I never pull up my straps!!  If you are currently wearing a 32D and your new size is a 30DD/E, you're only going down one band size and 0-1 cup sizes.   I am full on the bottom too. If you aren't filling your current cups at the top, it's probably because you don't have enough support in the bottom? That was my experience.

ABraThatFits,3chm8e,brekkabek,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:46:40 2015 UTC,"You might be as much as a 32G on paper but 32E/F/FF is more likely.  Have you checked FOB in terms of leaning forwards test, how they behave in bras?  If you have pendulous boobs they look FOB in many cases, as do all sorts of shapes of boobs when standing and they're affected by gravity.  Leaning forwards 90 degrees your nipples would point towards your head rather than directly to the floor or your feet.  Cleo Lucy is a moderately projected FOB bra, Freya plunge balconettes are mostly, but not all (avoid Gem and Rio), FOB and are narrower and more projected."
ABraThatFits,3chm8e,joanna70,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:29:14 2015 UTC,"In that case they are definitely pendulous and not FOB. They're able to get quite flat and have a low hand when bending forward. The nipples face directly downward in the FOB test. Also, upon searching for pendulous boobs on google I actually found that many look like mine, so i guess that's it."
ABraThatFits,3chm8e,joanna70,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:45:14 2015 UTC,"If you have properly narrow roots the Freya plunge balconettes are a good place to start, perhaps order a Polyanna based one (look it up on bratabase and select ""Related Models"") and Rio or Gem which are more even to FOT and see which works better.  Try at least two sizes in each, and bear in mind that Freya bands are stretchy so you might even want to try 30F/FF/G range."
ABraThatFits,3cglzd,shadymuffins,5,Tue Jul 7 19:23:44 2015 UTC,"I've been in love with that Floris print since it first came out as well :)  Floris is a sister cut of Marcie, but the bottom of the cup isn't as rounded as Marcie, and is a bit deeper in the center. Coupled with the different shaped wires and the firmer fabric, it's enough variation to make it a quite different fit. Floris is sort of a cross between Marcie and Panache Jasmine, really.  The gaping is pretty darn minor - I doubt it will be noticeable under a shirt. And the shape isn't uber-round, but it's not bad either. And it's soooo pretty, lol. If it's comfortable, and you don't mind the side profile (I have a few Ewa bras that are less than round on me, I save them for under looser fit tops where a perfectly round profile isn't necessary), I'd probably keep it :)"
ABraThatFits,3cglzd,buymeflowers,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:48:27 2015 UTC,Ahh--the part about it being deeper in the center than Marcie makes me better understand why I don't like the fit as well.  I think it's pretty enough to be worth keeping. :) I wish brands designed more bras with the same print across the whole cup like this. I often love a print but don't usually love when the upper lace is a starkly clashing color (Cleo and Bravissimo do this soo much).
ABraThatFits,3cglzd,xklinx,4,Wed Jul 8 00:25:25 2015 UTC,"It looks like there is also puckering in the lower cup, just above the underwire, in pics 2 and 5. Regardless, the fit is close, so it's a judgment call. I personally don't like loose fitting cups and prefer them to be tighter with full coverage (to avoid quad boob). It's a pretty bra."
ABraThatFits,3cglzd,pipandpop5,3,Tue Jul 7 21:09:03 2015 UTC,"Hmmm I see what you mean. The gaping isn't too noticeable, only if someone is looking for it, and it looks like it's holding your ladies up very well, without being in your face.

ABraThatFits,3cglzd,Goddess_Keira,3,Tue Jul 7 21:10:24 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean in the difference between the first and second set of pics. I think what's happening is that Floris has room for a fair amount more top fullness than what you have. I can see in the very last picture where the transparent upper cup is somewhat empty after your tissues settles.   As others have said, it's a judgment call on your part. The fit up top isn't ideal, but if it keeps the lift and looks nice under clothes, it's a wearable fit. Only you know if you'll be satisfied with it in the long run, though."
ABraThatFits,3cglzd,applesangria,2,Tue Jul 7 21:42:41 2015 UTC,"I really love the shape and lift this is giving you. I think it's cut for more upper fullness, which is why you're having a smidgen of gapping. What happens when you adjust the straps? The slight wrinkling in the lower part of the cup could be because you are FOB and the deepest part of this cup is in the middle, rather than at the bottom. Does it slide down from your IMF? I still think it's a good fit, and it's so beautiful. Perfect for summer. :)"

Seems super simple, but we're so used to looking st our own bodies that sometimes we can't even see them. does that make any sense?   When you lean at a ninety degree angle to the ground, with no bra, do your nipples point straight down, more towards your toes, or more towards your face?  And for my two cents, I think it's beautiful and a very nice fit. If you sew at all, a strip of elastic on the inside edge of the cup would keep it close to your skin-more like a stretch lace. You would have to experiment with placement so you don't lose the pretty detailing."

ABraThatFits,3chkl8,hurrrrrmione,3,Tue Jul 7 23:56:11 2015 UTC,"How tall are you? Could you please measure your tight underbust again? Only one inch difference is highly unusual in your size range, most have a difference of around 3 inches.   That said, I am getting UK 46FF/G and 44 G/GG with your current measurements.   That is US 46H/i and US 44 i/J in Goddess and Elila. The largest size at LB (US LB 44H) is equivalent to a UK 44G, so this is worth a shot if you got easy access to LB bras.   Note that most 42 bands stretch to around 43 inches, so I expect 44 bands to easily stretch to 45 inches. No need to go up to a 46 band apart from the fact that some bras come in a 46FF/G that are not available in a 44G/GG and vice versa."
ABraThatFits,3chkl8,t_maia,2,Wed Jul 8 06:40:35 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, few bras are made in 46H/HH (UK). More are made in US 46H, but the US H is several cup sizes smaller in comparison, and wouldn't fit you. If you were to get a bra in US cup size, you would likely be a K or L cup US. There is a pretty good chance that you can size down to a 44 band because large bands tend to be quite stretchy. You may be able to fit a size 44H in some bras.   Elomi Caitlyn and Sculptresse Chi-Chi are the two styles I know of that come up to a 46HH, should you need that size. I would suggest you start with one or both of those, and if possible order a few sizes. I'd suggest 44H, 44HH, and 46H to see how you fare. Caitlyn is stretchier in the band than Chi-Chi, so more likely to work in a 44 band although Chi-Chi may be fine too if you like a snug band. Sculptresse Rosie, Liberty, and Flirtini are available up to 46H. This page shows bras that come up to 46HH UK. You will see that most of them are by Goddess, the sister brand to Elomi that is in US sizes, so you would be looking for the K (= UK H) or L (= UK HH) cup size on a 44 or 46 band size. Note that 44HH is both a band and a cup size smaller than 46HH, because the cup size is relative to the band size. Sister sizes like 44HH and 46H are equal in cup volume but the 46 is, of course, one band size larger."

ABraThatFits,3cf5zq,deedeethecat,8,Tue Jul 7 14:26:47 2015 UTC,I am glad you felt comfortable to share this. I think it's great you are looking for a pretty bra.
ABraThatFits,3cf5zq,QLF,20,Tue Jul 7 17:28:47 2015 UTC,"As a guy who wears a bra, here's my suggestion.  Go to one of the big box stores and find a bra that you like. Take a selection of sizes to the fitting room.  Try them on and use that to decide what works best for you.  It may take a couple of trips based on how many garments are allowed in the fitting room at one time.  I suggest a big box store because they tend to have fitting rooms that are shared between the genders, so it's less of a hassle to use them than if you're at a department store where you probably will need to trudge the length of the store between the bra department and the men's fitting room.  And one more fact about bras that may surprise you ... do not assume that because you wear a 38D in one style that you will wear a 38D in others. Unlike men's clothes, women's sizes seem to be a vague suggestion. So expect to try on a lot of bras before you find a few that you like. If you order online, be sure that you can return the purchase easily without undue expense.  If you feel funny carrying around bras, checking in with the fitting room attendant, and generally shopping for what our society has labeled a ""woman's article"" ... this too will pass.  Just keep on keeping on.  After a while it will become much more natural.    Another option, if you find yourself overwhelmed by the bewildering number of styles available, is to go to a department store or specialty store and simply tell the clerk that you're new at this and ask for help. Women grow up learning the ins and outs of bras, but for us who join the party late, it can be a complete mystery. I've had varied experience with store clerks.  Most of them are very helpful and have no qualms about helping men buy bras for themselves.  The ones that it bothers ... well, that's really their problem, not mine, and if they don't care to help me I'll find someone who cares.  Oh, and this community is simply awesome."
ABraThatFits,3cf5zq,atheologist,30,Tue Jul 7 14:15:03 2015 UTC,"Unlike men's clothes, women's sizes seem to be a vague suggestion.   Hahaha. This is very true."
ABraThatFits,3cf5zq,lauracb,4,Tue Jul 7 14:57:24 2015 UTC,"so, if your snug is 39 and the tight is 3 inches less, you probably would be OK with 38 bands in some/many brands. You can always go to a 40 if a 38 is uncomfortable, but the tightness of the band is what gives support in a bra. Your measurements have a lot of variation, which suggest a pendulous shape and potentially soft tissue. Because of the variation, your true size could be anything from a 38DD to a 38GG, and starting somewhere in the middle may be helpful for finding a bra that fits.   A UK 38FF (40F) would be right in the middle of that possible range. Amazon sells a lot of bras in this size with free shipping and returns, so that may be easier than going into a store.   Have you looked at the shape guide in the sidebar? Specific bra recommendations require some idea of your shape - so we don't suggest a very narrow bra for someone with wide roots for example. Some of the common ""diagnostic"" bras are Cleo Lily, Lucy, and Marcie, because their behavior on someone can be used to determine someone's shape, and after they know that it's easier to get recommendations for other shapes of bra. If you have a preference for some shape you'd like to try - plunges or half-cup styles instead of balconette or full cup styles for example - knowing your shape will make it easier to recommend those."
ABraThatFits,3cf5zq,t_maia,4,Tue Jul 7 13:23:23 2015 UTC,"40DD is a good starting point. Theoretically anything from 40C to UK 40F (US 40G) is possible, but I consider 40DD most likely with your measurements.   You probably have a shallow shape, this is very common in men with your condition and size range.   Sadly there are not a lot of bras that work well for people with a shallow shape in this size range. Most of the bras recommended for shallow shapes stop at a 38 band. For this reason you better try UK 38E too. A stretchy 38 band might with even fit you, for a tigher band use an extender.   Sportsbras are actually a good idea if you don't want to advertise your condition. They minimise your bust, keep everything in check and are not too frilly. Unless pink flowery lace is what you are looking for? But I would still go for the better ones with cupsizes, those clothes-sized stretchy thingies usually don't work well."
ABraThatFits,3cf5zq,applesangria,2,Tue Jul 7 13:30:45 2015 UTC,"Sculptresse by Panache has some beautiful pieces in your size range, and if you look on amazon you might be able to find a deal! With Panache, you may want to size up in the band or get your sister size, a 42D. That will give the same cup volume with a larger band. They tend to have firm bands and underwires and can feel tight.   Trying out a UK 38E could also be good. It really just depends on your comfort level in the 38 versus 40 band. This would be a US 38DDD which is pretty widely available. As I'm writing this, Wacoal Embrace Lace comes to mind.   Best bet is to find a store with a good return policy, and start trying some on! If you want to be discreet, buy, try on at home and return. There's so much variation between sizing, and depending on the model/fabric etc, it's best to keep an open mind. Good luck!"

Jogging, going down stairs, even driving on bumpy roads...   Add in sweat + chafing underneath then during about half the year and I will probably never entirely get rid of them."
ABraThatFits,3cgu6x,gunnapackofsammiches,6,Wed Jul 8 01:18:22 2015 UTC,"I hold my boobs when going up/down stairs without a bra, lol. Actually I hold them most of the time when I'm not wearing a bra."
ABraThatFits,3cgu6x,crazymusicalgenius96,3,Wed Jul 8 01:43:15 2015 UTC,Pretty much.
ABraThatFits,3cgu6x,gunnapackofsammiches,18,Wed Jul 8 01:44:35 2015 UTC,"I wear them because I hate boob sticky sweat in the center and underneath. They look nicer lifted in my bra, instead of hanging out near the bottom of my ribs. I also rather enjoy that I'm only a little jiggly instead of a lot jiggly. I wear a bra in one form or another till I go to sleep, and then I sleep in a shelf cami."
ABraThatFits,3cgu6x,HootyMyBoobs,14,Tue Jul 7 20:27:23 2015 UTC,"I prefer the way mine look when in a (well-fitting) bra, plus it's just easier to do stuff. I don't have to deal with them constantly getting in the way if they're stuck in place and unable to jiggle freely.  Edit: Plus, like, the lack of surprise nipples."
ABraThatFits,3cgu6x,homicidalunicorns,7,Tue Jul 7 20:31:52 2015 UTC,"I feel awkward in public without one. Mine aren't huge by any means and I can get away without a bra if I do some light layering, but I just can't in public. At home of course I wear nothing. I also like looking pretty in brras, even if no one will see it. (I also have nipple  piercings, so my nipples are always hard and don't always need to be visible under tight stuff.)"
ABraThatFits,3cgu6x,deathrottweiler,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:02:15 2015 UTC,"Question: do you have a curved bar or a straight bar in your nipples? I have curves and I haven't noticed any change in my nipple hardness (aside from when it's really cold, then they zing with the metal addition). I was contemplating a straight bar but I was told that would make them hard all the time and I don't own lined bras."
ABraThatFits,3cgu6x,Moonforehead,2,Wed Jul 8 13:23:45 2015 UTC,"They were pierced in April with a straight bar. They have been hard ever since then (which is really awesome in my opinion). In my soft cup bras, unless I am wearing a SUPER TIGHT shirt, both my nipples and the bars are nearly impossible to see. Nipples should really start off being pierced with straight, titanium bars. Once fully healed then you can move onto to shields, rings, etc. If they aren't straight they risk migration, rejecting, etc. But I'm totally thrilled if what you got is working out but I would think about doing straight bars. Of course I don't know how long you have had them, so either ask your piercer to change them (which is what I would the first time) or if they're healed and whatnot do it yourself."
ABraThatFits,3cgu6x,deathrottweiler,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:51:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've had these for roughly 3 years haha. But most of my body does not like curved jewelry and it gets uncomfortable to have it in. I need to measure for a straight bar because I had to swap a longer bar after I got mine pierced, my piercer gave me an extra set to account for swelling. I tend to wear tight shirts and unlined bras to work for comfort, but I might have to get some nipple covers if a straight bar is gonna give me hard nipples 24/7. I work with a bunch of rowdy males haha, they would implode if I walked around with my nipples visible being hard."
ABraThatFits,3cgu6x,Moonforehead,8,Wed Jul 8 14:16:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone ""needs"" to wear a bra at all, but many choose to (consciously and unconsciously) for a variety of reasons.  I wear a bra mainly because it is more comfortable (neck and shoulder pain, sweat), my clothes look better (which helps my self-esteem), and I think I look inappropriate in public without one."
ABraThatFits,3cgu6x,SmellsLikeDogBuns,6,Tue Jul 7 21:05:53 2015 UTC,"I am not large-busted and I feel it okay if I do not wear bras sometimes. Yet I still wear them most of the time because they   help to reduce breast shaking when walking/running are supportive, and I like the feeling of having the extra support  go better with clothes (no nipples showing) help improve breast shape (After I found my right size, I notice my breasts look perkier and there is less armpit fat when I take off my bras. I am not sure how my breasts would look if I have never worn a bra though)   For large-busted ladies, there are probably many more reasons, such as preventing pain caused by the weight of breasts, making you look slimmer, etc."
ABraThatFits,3cgu6x,ChocoNoir,4,Tue Jul 7 23:52:20 2015 UTC,"For me it is mostly the back pain. Even though I don't have a large bust (28E), I still get pain in my shoulders if I go without support for a couple of hours. Otherwise I probably wouldn't bother."

ABraThatFits,3cgu6x,xuenylom,3,Tue Jul 7 22:51:25 2015 UTC,"Because the human body is not built to handle any sort of extra weight in the front of the torso. As weird as it may seem humans aren't evolved to support breasts, they have been around for a very short amount of time on an evolutionary time scale. In a way breasts (especially larger breasts) are an unnatural distribution of weight.  Women have been supporting their breasts one way or another throughout history (and likely throughout prehistory as well). Mild binding has been popular everywhere, corset-like garments and corsets in many cultures as well, in China there's evidence of specialized support garments from the Ming dynasty, in Western civilization bra-like garments were used already in the Middle ages.  We need to wear bras because we need the support. It's just the newest in a long line of things used to support breasts."
ABraThatFits,3cgu6x,noys,6,Wed Jul 8 10:07:06 2015 UTC,"I'm a dude who has much smaller boobs than most who would say they need to wear a bra. However, I have pseudogynecomastia and it has produced enough excess fat tissue that my boobs ache if they've been left unsupported for more than a few hours.   If you think social norms are to blame for women wearing bras, consider what the social norms have to say about a guy wearing a bra. It's often seen as a comical or homosexual thing, but that's far from what it should be seen as.  And with that, I'm stepping down from my soapbox for the night."
ABraThatFits,3cgu6x,shy477,2,Wed Jul 8 02:57:12 2015 UTC,"I like the shape they give and i'm not ready for underboob deodorant/powders, and never will be. And I have self supporting breasts.

ABraThatFits,3cgu6x,nidena,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:27:05 2015 UTC,Here is the real reason!
ABraThatFits,3cgu6x,yellkaa,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:05:33 2015 UTC,"Actually, because without it it really hurts while moving. If I jump, if I run, if I move fast, they hurt. It's totally not comfortable when they are moving with your every move.   And the second reason is fashion. All the todays fashion is made for boobs sitting the way thay are in bras. There are no dresses, blouses and so on designed to fit 'natutal' bra-less shape of the majority of breasts. The weirdest thing is that even those dresses designed to be worn without any bras actually do not fit the bra-less shape."
ABraThatFits,3cgu6x,yellkaa,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:09:17 2015 UTC,"If I don't wear a bra, I can't run or jump.  Because gravity makes it hurt ;c"
ABraThatFits,3cgu6x,DivinePrince2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:55:01 2015 UTC,"I've been braless for ages, but I'd much rather wear a bra for a variety of reasons. Pain, lack of support, general discomfort/feeling weird without one, and of course, boob sweat. Boob sweat is NOT pleasant.  I'm only without a bra at the moment because I have sensory issues and still haven't found a correct fit, but I'd much rather be in one really. It also limits your clothing choice if you go without (I have to layer everything to hide the fact I'm not wearing one, which isn't always comfortable).  Bras aren't an absolute necessity health-wise, but larger-breasted women do suffer from pain without one, or without some sort of support in that area, as well as rashes/soreness/skin infections. I sweat like a pig under my breasts but fortunately I've not had a skin complaint yet.  Bras do NOT cause breast cancer either, nor does going bra-less. Bras have no connection to breast cancer whatsoever."

ABraThatFits,3ch2rr,talesofa30band,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:20:50 2015 UTC,"You can totally wear 32s if they are more comfortable! Especially if you don't have much squish.  The armpit fat may just be your tail of Spence, depending on where it is. Is it in the front of your armpit, kind of connecting your boob to your arm? Or is it in the middle of your armpit, near the outer end of the underwire?"
ABraThatFits,3ch2rr,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:37:11 2015 UTC,"Also, 32 was the smallest size too. I think I'm technically 30DD. The armpit fat is between my armpit and the side of the bra. But my boobs fit completely in the cups. I think Wacoal's 32 bands are probably snugger than most 32's because department store 32's are usually much looser. In looser bands, a 30 is best."

ABraThatFits,3cgrux,Seinpheld,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:20:13 2015 UTC,"I'm still pretty new to this whole business, but from my understanding, it means that there is breast tissue really high up on the chest, in my case three fingers under my collar bone. It is a little easier for me to tell where the root ends up there because I have pretty loose tissue, so if I squish it up, I see it end at the root, if that makes sense! It gave me issues because bras would expect my boobs to end way lower than they do, so I need a pretty open cup (plunges seem to work best so far!  Best of luck on your search!"

ABraThatFits,3cgrux,Julez22,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:59:09 2015 UTC,"From the bratabase measurements, you might like other similarly shaped CK bras such as the Tempt Me. These both seem to be quite shallow compared to the Roxie, so if you try other CKs, such as the Starlet, you may want to get 30F.  But don't try CK's unlined bras which are much more FOT and projected! I like them and I'm 2/5, but I have wideish roots and they do gape at the top for me."
ABraThatFits,3cgwrp,marnie1108,5,Tue Jul 7 20:38:51 2015 UTC,"Could you add your measurements to the post? I think the calculator is great, but works best in conjunction with human input. There are also a few other shape factors besides projected that can help wnarrow down suggestions."
ABraThatFits,3cgwrp,SmellsLikeDogBuns,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:01:47 2015 UTC,"Typically, Cleo Lucy and Lily are recommended as bras to start with if you're projected. If you have quite tall roots, you may find that both are a bit too closed off. Marcie is also good to try, but doesn't have as much immediate projection. Panache Jasmine, Envy, and one other that escapes me are also typically recommended.   /u/smellslikedogbuns mentioned shape factors below, as well as sizing -- that can help narrow down what may work well for you; some bras have very snug bands while others run a bit looser -- depending on the difference between your snug and tight measurements, we may also recommend a sister size in a certain cut/color."
ABraThatFits,3cgwrp,soleoblues,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:52:30 2015 UTC,Andorra is usually recommended with Jasmine & Envy.
ABraThatFits,3cgwrp,HootyMyBoobs,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:56:19 2015 UTC,THANK YOU. I've been trying to remember since I posted. I can finally sleep.
ABraThatFits,3cgwrp,soleoblues,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:13:37 2015 UTC,"But Andorra doesn't have that much projection, it's about average."
ABraThatFits,3cgwrp,noys,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:02:03 2015 UTC,"We are just about the same size. I'm moderately projected with an even to slightly full on top shape and medium roots (both height and width). My suggestions are less helpful if you are full on bottom or have wider/narrower or taller/shorter roots.  That said, my favorite bras are: Cleo Ellis, Panache Floris, Cleo Nyla, Cleo Lily, and Panache Envy. Ellis, Floris, and Nyla are all based on Cleo Marcie, which is recommended for a full on top shape, but are more projected and a bit narrower than the original. Lily is recommended for even shapes. Envy is one of a series of three Panache bras with stretch lace on the upper portion of the cup and is in the middle in terms of projection. Andorra has less projection and Jasmine has more. I do also wear Andorra and mostly like it; I have not had the chance to try Jasmine, but I suspect it would be too projected for me.  Of the bras listed above, I believe only Envy (and Andorra) come in a beige color, which I like because I wear a lot of white tops.  I also personally really like Freya Gem, though the wires are too wide for me. Freya bras tend to give a slightly more natural ""teardrop"" shape that I happen to like, though many people seem to prefer Panache/Cleo's rounded, front-and-center look. Freya Rio is in my regular rotation, as well. Gem has a very stretchy band, while Rio is a bit firmer. Also, Gem has a somewhat wider center gore than all the other bras I've listed, which is sometimes an issue for me, but may not be for you."
ABraThatFits,3cffzo,deathrottweiler,5,Tue Jul 7 14:27:00 2015 UTC,"With your underbust measurements so close together, I think you should stick with 32 unless the band is very stretchy and soft. 32DD sounds like a good place to start to me. Cleo Marcie might be a good one to try, but you are unlikely to find that in stores.   I would say, however, to give wired bras another shot. Many people disliked wired bras, but a big part of the reason is that they are not wearing the optimal size or shape for them and find it painful. Don't forget to scoop and swoop!"
ABraThatFits,3cffzo,SmellsLikeDogBuns,6,Tue Jul 7 14:58:52 2015 UTC,"Given that you have just half an inch difference between your snug and tight measurements, I think  you were likely right to go up to a 32 band. A lot of people without ""squish"" on their ribcage find that a band that corresponds exactly with their snug measurement feels uncomfortable. The 32D/DD sizes seem like a reasonable place to start.   You probably want to look at a broader range of brands than your store has available, though, and luckily you are in a size range that is pretty widely available. I'm less familiar with bras for shallow shapes, but I believe there is a link on the sidebar with more info that will likely be useful for you. Not sure about non-wired options at all, though."
ABraThatFits,3cffzo,atheologist,3,Tue Jul 7 15:02:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks  everyone! I think 32dd may be best. Seems I spill over just a bit in the meager 32d selection we have. I  will order a couple from brands we carry (discounts!) And search some stores. Nordstrom is my weekend goal but in the mean time I am hoping maybe Target or Walmart would have that size? I may just give in and buy one of what we have in stock just to have it so I don't have to suffer with what I currently wear.  We did have one underwire in 32d, but I just can't handle it!"
ABraThatFits,3cffzo,SmellsLikeDogBuns,2,Tue Jul 7 15:49:32 2015 UTC,I have a hard time finding anything under 36 bands at Target/Walmart but your local stores might be better. Nordstrom should have a much wider variety of sizes with higher quality brands.
ABraThatFits,3cffzo,eveningtrain,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:09:15 2015 UTC,"Well I just checked Nordstrom's online availability for the store near me and they have exactly one bra in 32dd. (No clue how accurate this is. I only go to Nordstrom's when I'm walking from the parking lot and into the mall.) They have some super cute stuff, but I can't see myself paying $40 for a bra. I may just tough it out and order thru my job instead especially since I'll end up saving $$$ thru my discount."
ABraThatFits,3cffzo,Julez22,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:49:34 2015 UTC,Just went thru our catalogs and 32dd is even harder to find than 32d. Amoena has several bras from 30 upward but they're discontinuing them. Lovely.
ABraThatFits,3cffzo,adulaire,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:14:15 2015 UTC,"My Nordstroms has a set of ""fit bras"" in each size, several popular styles in most sizes that they use for fitting and aren't available for purchase. You might be able to try on more than you think. If you live in an area where there is a Nordstrom Rack, there are usually lots of 32DD on sale at mine! I know because I have to comb through them when looking for my own size, 30C/D. You can also try on a $40 (or $80!) bra at Nordstrom and then trawl through eBay to find it much cheaper. Don't count Nordstrom out just yet, it is a good starting point!"
ABraThatFits,3cffzo,petitecollegiate,2,Wed Jul 8 07:00:26 2015 UTC,"I think based on your measurements 32DDD could also be a possibility. If the underwires are sitting on your tissue then that's not fun. These sizes are still in the bra matrix so I think you can find them at Nordstrom or Soma and I think even VS sometimes has 32DDs. Once you're more sure of your size, check out r/braswap and bratabase.com for deals."
ABraThatFits,3cffzo,talesofa30band,2,Tue Jul 7 17:32:11 2015 UTC,"Sounds more like a 30DD/E to me, though someone else might correct me if I'm wrong. Since you've been wearing loose bands for so long, you might be more comfortable sister-sizing up to a 32D/DD for starters and seeing how it feels, especially since this size isn't super-huge and needing the support of a very tight band."
ABraThatFits,3cg8g4,Moonforehead,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:51:36 2015 UTC,"As for the Polish bras, it depends on how narrow you are.  Comexim is the narrowest of those two bras, and their plunge styles will have the most immediate projection.  Depending on how FOB you are, you may need reduced cups in Comexim since their cups are usually quite tall.  EM's wires run a little wider, but still nothing like most UK brands.  EM also has a billion different cuts and styles, while Comexim is known mostly for their padded plunges (which have a 2.75"" gore btw, so it's more like a low balconette) and padded half cups.  I'm kind of surprised the Freya Rio fits you.  First of all, a 32 band especially in Freya would likely be too loose.  And Rio is made for FOT boobs, so are you sure you're FOB?  Do you fill out the Rio's cups?  Andorra might be worth a shot in the bigger size, unless that will make the wires be too wide.  And wherrrre did you find a TR Nichole??  Did you order directly from TR?  I can't find one anywhere and I'd love one but I think their shipping cost is quite ridiculous."
ABraThatFits,3cg8g4,lcl0706,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:15:45 2015 UTC,"The freya rio fits aside from a little wrinkling at the top of the cup, which I personally don't mind. For my shape, I could almost consider myself even but yeah I'm slightly FoB. And the TR Nichole I got at lilibeas which is like an hour drive for me (it cost about the same as direct from TR plus shipping though)."
ABraThatFits,3cg8g4,applesangria,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:55:41 2015 UTC,"How were the wires on the Andorra? When going up in cup, wires get wider, and you don't want a ton of extra room on the sides if you're narrow. It's probably worth a shot. Panache does tend to be a tighter band, also.  Have you tried Cleo Lucy?"
ABraThatFits,3cg8g4,applesangria,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:05:44 2015 UTC,"I'll have to try it on again and focus on the wires alone.

The calculator says 28D/DD but that you'll be more comfortable in 30C/D. Have you swooped and scooped because that's really important. When you say you have a gap between your chest and the lower part, do you mean the underwire isn't sitting against your chest? If this is the case, the cups are definitely too small and it's very likely a bra shape issue. Since you're more FOT, it could be that you're sort of quading out on the top (are you?) of the cups, but not filling them out. This is the orange-in-a-glass effect  I think it would be helpful for us if you draw a picture. (or post one, but only if you're comfortable!)

It's comfortable and close to the chest. But just above the middle part of the bra it ""wrinkles"", like its too mush fabric there. And up along the line of the cup there is a gap. Here's a photo (NSFW) where you se the gap I'm talking about. Not very clear, but you se the shadow on my chest from the cup. The problem doesn't really show in a picture from the front. In this pic its no wrinkles, they disappear in the position I'm in in the photo (shoulders back, chest out, trying to get an ok angle). Can't really answer your question, don't know what ""quading"" means (neither does google or google translate? English isn't my mother tongue..).    Thanks for the suggestion!"
ABraThatFits,3cezm7,j_sunrise,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:08:55 2015 UTC,"Hey it's normal. Society doesn't exactly teach us much about bra fitting... I see the gap! ""Quad boob"" is basically the opposite of that--it's what we call breast tissue spilling out the front of the bra cups (making it look like you have four boobs). Is this a picture from after you swooped and scooped? I actually don't think either of those Cleo bras would be good if so. It seems you're more even or full on bottom but very shallow. The bra you're wearing could be in the correct size but just with too deep cups. I think you could like 28 bands. (Other than that, I'm stumped as to why you're measuring 30C/D but aren't filling out that 30A. Maybe make another specific post about this?)  Do you know what bra you're wearing? Here's the shallow guide. Maybe try some of those bra recommendations. I agree with another poster that The Little Bra Company is a good one to try. I hear some of their bras are quite shallow. Sorry if this is overwhelming! We'll figure it out!"
ABraThatFits,3cezm7,j_sunrise,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:22:11 2015 UTC,"Also I'm not sure what you mean by ""pulling"" your breast to get the measurements. I don't think you need to do that--it could possibly be giving us a larger size than you actually measure as. Here are women in correct-fitting 30C bras and women in 28Ds for reference."
ABraThatFits,3cepyn,Darth_Let,9,Tue Jul 7 09:42:21 2015 UTC,"A 28 band will most likely be too tight on you. Start with 30F and 30FF. This is one and two cup volumes up from your 32DD bra (via sister sizing, 32DD has the same volume cups as 30DDD/E).  A 26.5 in band measurement for a 32 band bra actually isn't uncommon. The band should stretch to 32 inches. If it was 32 inches to start with, it wouldn't fit snugly like the band needs to.   If there's a Nordstrom in your area, they should have a fair selection of bras that come in 30F and 30FF. You can also check the offline retailer list for other stores in your area that might carry your size.   The calculator and this sub use UK sizing, which is different from US sizing, so look for the UK size on tags if you go shopping at a store. Websites that sell both US and UK brands should indicate whether the bra is sold in US or UK sizing."
ABraThatFits,3cepyn,hurrrrrmione,2,Tue Jul 7 10:35:24 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the link to the retailer list! I discovered that I live pretty close to a store that has very positive reviews, and I look forward to going there soon!"
ABraThatFits,3cepyn,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:16:49 2015 UTC,You're welcome!
ABraThatFits,3cepyn,Julez22,2,Tue Jul 7 23:57:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think you should try 30F-FF bras.  The gore on your 32DD floats because the cups are too small. They hold the same volume as a 30E, while you actually need F-FF. The floating gore is what's making your band feel too tight.  VS measures over the bust to get the band measurement (which doesn't make sense since you wear it under the bust) but it's normal for a band to be smaller unstretched. I wear 28 bands that are only 22 inches unstretched. I like herroom.com and they're having a sale today! Just don't use their sizing calculator. They have free returns (except shipping I think?) so amazon prime is also a good option. Or trying on some at Nordstrom or Nordstrom rack to see what size you need. Also check out shape and here are some real 30F women."
ABraThatFits,3cepyn,petitecollegiate,2,Tue Jul 7 17:26:26 2015 UTC,I agree that a 30 band is a good place to start. They're easier to find and they should be more comfortable for you. I buy a lot of things on Amazon because there's free shipping and returns so you don't have any commitment. I went from a 32D at VS to a 28F real size so I feel your pain with them. I do find that their 32 bands run quite small (even used mine only stretch to about 29-31). Bratabase is a great place to look for what bras fit your measurements and keep track of your fit journey.
ABraThatFits,3cc5kd,-tallywa-,11,Mon Jul 6 19:37:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you guys so much for all your hard work!! I, for one, appreciate all the things you do around here and you don't get enough credit. With all the hoopla that went down last week, I have become all the more aware of how much y'all give to this community.  I've thought of this question before but I keep forgetting to bring it up. Have y'all noticed the /u/AutoModerator feature in FFA that allows someone to type "".sq"" (for example) and the bot will reply with an automated message suggesting that the OP post the question in the Simple Question's thread? Their bot does it for a bunch of different "".xxx"" abbreviations but I'm having a hard time finding the other examples right now.  Is that something we might consider implementing, especially regarding directing people to the sidebar? Rather than having to rehash out an introduction and soften the blow of asking for more info or jumping out there and being like ""5 MEASUREMENTS NOW PLZ,"" could a bot be programmed to spit out a nice, informational spiel for us automatically? Having the same sidebar links in that automated message could also keep everyone from the inability to see the sidebar on mobile/difficulty of linking to the appropriate links while commenting on mobile situation.  Is that a ton of work? I honestly have no idea how those work or if it would even be worth it. I'm willing to write the actual texts of the messages but I'm basically a chimpanzee when it comes to coding."
ABraThatFits,3cc5kd,cupcakery,3,Mon Jul 6 20:51:13 2015 UTC,Yeah I have actually noticed that and thought we might use it but since we've been doing so many other changes right now I hadn't brought it up with the other mods. It wouldn't be too difficult to implement. Although I'm also not sure how well received it is over there since I often seen those comments with downvotes...
ABraThatFits,3cc5kd,cupcakery,3,Mon Jul 6 21:15:43 2015 UTC,"Fair point - I hadn't really paid attention to the response that those comments got on FFA, I just thought they were nifty. And it's totally not a priority by any means, but maybe it might alleviate some of the complaints/frustrations about people not reading the sidebar? Other people should comment with their thoughts. cough, cough, friends. cough, cough.  I personally am turned off by the posts that only say ""We need your five measurements, see the sidebar,"" but sometimes I'm in too much of a hurry to write an elegant thoughtful response that includes specific links. I would "".bg"" ALL OVER the place. If that one is successful, linking to the shape guide or buying guide could also be possible."
ABraThatFits,3cc5kd,crazymusicalgenius96,4,Mon Jul 6 21:24:34 2015 UTC,Often the people who post without reading the sidebar first are looking for something very specific. They want information about special bra types or breast characteristics (we get posts about uneven breasts a lot). So I usually try to answer the question first and then suggest they measure/read the beginner's guide/etc.
ABraThatFits,3cc5kd,HiddenNicholas,2,Mon Jul 6 21:33:49 2015 UTC,"What if, instead of a comment, everyone who posted a certain kind of thread (esp tagless posts) just got a friendly PM from automod with links to resources/the beginner's guide, requirements for posting (5 measurements), and a very nice ""thanks for posting and sorry if you've already done this!"" comment at the end? Gonewild handles automatic PMs similarly and I find it friendly and reasonable."
ABraThatFits,3cc5kd,32Goobies,2,Mon Jul 6 23:43:21 2015 UTC,We're discussing the various options that we could go with in regards to auto comments; we'll consider this as well.
ABraThatFits,3cc5kd,PhrygianHalfCadence,2,Tue Jul 7 01:57:28 2015 UTC,I think something like this would be super useful because so many people post about things that are really hard to help with unless you have measurements and the posts go unanswered because nobody had the time or ability to make a post asking for them and referring to the sidebar.
ABraThatFits,3cc5kd,TheseAreNotDDs,8,Tue Jul 7 01:50:46 2015 UTC,"Can I make a suggestion?  I think the sidebar should have a list of friends or sister subreddits like it has in the past.  Some of them could be /r/randomactsofbras, /r/braswap, /r/bigboobproblems and /r/smallboobproblems, and /r/TwoXChromosomes.  It'll help users locate related subreddits without having to dig through any guides."
ABraThatFits,3cc5kd,TheseAreNotDDs,3,Tue Jul 7 01:34:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with this - i personally found the links really useful to have there (the links to other sites like bratabase, brabandproject and busty resources were useful too) and since they were under a ""hover to show"" cut I don't think it was too intrusive either.  Semi-related: I also noticed that under the Post Filters links, not all the post tags are actually listed? I know we have a tag for bra reviews but i'm not seeing it as an option to filter by in the sidebar?"
ABraThatFits,3cc5kd,noys,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:53:06 2015 UTC,Both Bra Reviews and Store Reviews show up under the one filter due to the way that works. The search function sucks and can't distinguish between the two.
ABraThatFits,3cc5kd,zavoot,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:56:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for clarifying that :) Perhaps you could rename the filter link to Store/Bra Reviews rather than just Store Reviews instead then?

I'm guessing her size is 28D/DD  And with Allison looking even smaller she's likely 26E/F territory.  Lara is no way in hell anywhere near a 34 band, if she's a US 6 her bust is around 34, though judging by the pic, her bust is more around 36-38 so I would put her closer to 28G/30FF territory judging how my own boobs look  Kristin is probably the closest, but still, her sideboob tells it all!

ABraThatFits,3cdaa7,back2savetheuniverse,7,Tue Jul 7 00:40:18 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the club! 30D is a pretty common new size around here and a lot of people do turn to ordering online. What country are you in? For your best in-store US options your best bet is Nordstrom or a specialty boutique. Online you have Nordstrom (pricier, but free shipping), Amazon (if you have Prime, free shipping and returns) and Asos (free shipping over $35ish, free returns).  What bras have you tried? Do you know much about your shape? If you could also include all five of your measurements we can hopefully put a little more faith in your size before you jump out into the great wide world of new bras!"
ABraThatFits,3cdaa7,cupcakery,2,Tue Jul 7 01:23:52 2015 UTC,"I used to work at VS. Good rule of thumb for 95% of the time, whatever your ""normal"" size is, if you go up in band, you can go down in cup and visa versa.   For you though, pretty impossible to get a 28DD.. So if you're a 30D. Try out the 32C. And if u buy from VS, you can ALWAYs return."
ABraThatFits,3cdaa7,nchaosmu,8,Tue Jul 7 04:00:25 2015 UTC,"Yes sister sizing is legit, but sister sizing too far away from your measured band size results in compromised support. The band of the bra provides the majority of the support, and many women find it quite uncomfortable when a too loose band moves around. Depending on the rest of OPs measurements, a 32 might not be the best choice unless it's a band that runs tight, which VS is not known for."
ABraThatFits,3cdaa7,-tallywa-,3,Tue Jul 7 04:06:35 2015 UTC,"I would agree, 32 bands from Victoria's Secret when you measure 30 is a no-no. In my personal experience, their bands wear down pretty quickly and end up too loose."
ABraThatFits,3cdaa7,OrosTheDarkElf,2,Tue Jul 7 07:00:41 2015 UTC,"Going from 36A to 30D was an amazing revelation to me.  Prior to finding this subreddit, I did not realize that 1) I was in an incredibly wrong size for my entire adult life, and 2) there are bras out there that ARE my size--30D.  I am a wide shallow, and I found my holy grail bra in a Natori Feathers (30DD, they run a size smaller in the cup).  It fits perfectly, and I enjoy this fact every single day."
ABraThatFits,3cdaa7,Brookwood38,2,Tue Jul 7 05:04:34 2015 UTC,"I also found my first Bra That Fits in Natori Feathers Contour Plunge. I went to Nordstrom to find 30C, my new measured size, and while I fit well in some Betsy Johnsons and ended up purchasing one, the Natori 30D was a perfect fit. After seeing in store how great it was, I purchased two on eBay for less than half the price!  You can also find 30D at Aerie, not sure of the quality of the bras since it is a mall store,  but pricing is very good!"
ABraThatFits,3cdaa7,eveningtrain,2,Tue Jul 7 08:18:50 2015 UTC,"Ebay has some great deals on 30D bras for much less than you would pay in a store, though you will probably want to try before you buy at first."

ABraThatFits,3cdaa7,nomotaco,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:09:19 2015 UTC,"Aerie sells 30Ds in stores and you could easily try VS 32C if you like. Some of their bands run very small (particularly in the pink line). Amazon has free shipping and returns so you can try things out to your hearts content then. Places like Ross or Marshalls might have some, but it's sort of a crapshoot. Wacoal could be a good bet. They have a wide variety of 30 bands that are fairly cheap."

ABraThatFits,3cekra,boobmeupbuttercup,5,Tue Jul 7 08:26:14 2015 UTC,"You will have changed shape slightly too, so see if you can tighten your 32Fs and see what the shape issues might be that make the cup look a bit big.  When trying bras it's always best to try at least 2 sizes, if not three, relying on free returns of course helps.  I would try 30F/FF and possibly even 30G, seeing if you can narrow down size and shape issues.  What is your 32F bra(s)?"
ABraThatFits,3cekra,joanna70,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:04:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you for replying! I kind of figured that I'd have to try a few out, but I'm moving in with my dad soon and his apartment complex has had a lot of package stealing going on lately, so I'm hoping for as few orders as possible. My main bras right now (both 32F) are Panache Porcelin Grace, which is really comfortable but I think the cups are too wide as there's gaping between my breasts and the gore as well as at the top of the cups, and Charnos Amalie, which has a bit of gaping at the top of the cup, but fits well otherwise with the band tightened."
ABraThatFits,3cekra,joanna70,2,Wed Jul 8 04:26:26 2015 UTC,"Charnos Amalie is almost certainly narrower and more projected, Porcelains are generally shallower but they're not all exactly the same and not sure which shape Grace caters to.  If you think the wire width on Amalie is good on you, not too narrow, up to 1/2"" too wide, then that gives you a starting point.  in the photo is looks slightly FOB but photos can be VERY misleading, so I'd look to reassess your shape from the Shape Guide, use the wire width knowledge you will now have (bratabase.com lists many wire widths, the more entries for a certain bra the more reliable the figures will be) and you can go from there looking for 30FF/G, possibly 30F but less likely."
ABraThatFits,3cekra,Julez22,2,Wed Jul 8 06:32:29 2015 UTC,"It's likely shape issues making your current cups seem large, though it could also be the loose band. I think 30F-FF-G seems about right...depending on shape."
ABraThatFits,3cczzr,0wlitch,5,Mon Jul 6 23:17:38 2015 UTC,"One of the big differences between Jasmine and Envy is the amount of tissue they allow in the bottom part of the cup.   Envy has a very rounded cup there, Jasmine not so much. What is happening in the Jasmine that all the tissue that does not fit into the bottom part of the cup gets pushed upwards towards the top. For this reason you spill out of Jasmine but not out of Envy. The wires bending on Jasmine is also caused by this. All the tissue in the upper part of the cup in Jasmine makes the upper part of the band stretch more.   Now it is up to you to say which shape in the bottom cup you prefer - the more rounded one of Envy or the stronger ""lift"" of Jasmine?   If you like the rounded bottom shape of Envy, you'd probably do well in Ewa Michalak and the Bravissimo Side Support Bras like Fleur and Urban Rose. Stay away from Alana, that one is too closed on top for you.   I think the 32K Envy is a very good fit for you, no need to go up to a 32KK in bras with this shape. Jasmine - well, you'd indeed need one cupsize up.    The differences between the wire width of the 32K Envy/Jasmine and the wire width you need could potentially be fixed by inserting wires from a 32J Jasmine/Envy or a similar bra.      But all in all your best option is probably to order from Ewa Michalak, especially the S and SM cut."
ABraThatFits,3cczzr,t_maia,3,Tue Jul 7 09:33:30 2015 UTC,"Oh man, that Envy looks like a fabulous fit except for the wide wires.  Also, I don't think you look 2-3 cup sizes smaller than Curvy Wordy.  Not saying that to be rude or anything, just honest.  You both look about the same and following her blog could be very helpful to you.  Without going Polish, going narrower may be tough.  By looking at 32K Envy's measurements on Bratabase (approx 7.2 wide and 15"" deep) and searching by measurements in that range, here's what I'm coming up with...  Curvy Kate Cascade, Wonderland, and Rosie in 32K  Flirtelle Lucy, Megan, Zara, Mia, and Willow in 32K  Then you also get the close sizes of 32JJ and 34J, and the sister size of 34JJ, and all of the J's and JJ's run a little narrower than the 32K's.  Then you get a whole long list of Ewa Michalak bras, which honestly will be your best bet for the narrow width you need while maintaining the depth you need.  I highly suggest ordering one and waiting it out, because if it fits like you want, it will be WELL worth it.  You're going to keep running into wire width troubles in UK brands, and if it's something you can live with, fine, but if not I foresee many frustrated posts in the future.  Meanwhile, have you checked braswap, bratabase, and/or the facebook ""clothes for boobs"" listings for secondhand Ewas?  I'm not in your size range and have not tried EM, but have heard various rumors of band and cup inconsistencies and have experienced that myself with Comexim.  I think some of that just comes along with each bra being handmade to order and not mass produced in stock.  From the measurements I'm coming up with on bratabase, you'd want to start in Ewa around a 70KK-75K, sometimes it's trial and error, but don't discount trying Ewa."
ABraThatFits,3cczzr,lcl0706,2,Tue Jul 7 03:20:38 2015 UTC,"You will find trying to find bras with narrower wires without ordering from either Poland or the UK (or checking out the second-hand market) is going to be an exercise in frustration. Panache Jasmine/Envy is really about as good as it gets. Possibly some of the newest Curvy Kate styles could also be wearable, but not being in the US, I don't know exactly what you can get on Prime. (Also CK isn't super good about making style changes clear so you need to read up on which colourways are the newest and such to avoid getting one of their early cuts which were ....not good)  As your cat loves your bras more than you do, you could try taking in the gore on your Jasmine (there's some links to tutorials accessible via the sidebar but the mods have moved everything around recently so I'm not sure exactly where they live at present). I took in the gore on my Jasmine when I had one in 30K, and it seems to be a reasonably popular alteration (I seem to see a lot go up for sale in this size range with either 'I took in the gore but can remove it if you want', or 'I took in the gore but removed the stitching and so you may be able to see small residual holes'). It's going to move the wires out of your armpits slightly, and also give you a bit more room in the middle of the bra, where you need it.  I'd suggest that you may like an Ewa Michalak BM (it's got the same sort of stretch lace upper cup as a Jasmine/Envy but with narrower wires and a lower gore). Based on your current measurements, probably a 75K would be about right (although you'd want to check the actual model and whether the band runs firm or loose). I can totally understand not wanting to spend money on bras which will take a long time to get there when your size is all over the place though."
ABraThatFits,3ceblj,shallowasian,2,Tue Jul 7 06:24:32 2015 UTC,"If you are truly shallow then the leaning measurement is usually most accurate - which means you could need a 28F instead. 28DD is the same volume as your current 32C, and generally (especially for shallow breasts) women are in a too small cup when they come here. So I would lean a bit more towards 28E/F for you.  In terms of shape, the image you linked is about shallowness, not fullness. If you are shallow then fullness won't matter quite as much but you may want to give the shape guide another read since you seem to have mixed that up a little bit, just to be sure."

Generally, sizing up will give more room in the cups, leading you to believe you're bigger than you are. I would try to get your hands on something Polish, or at least something like the Panache Jasmine or Cleo Lily. Lily (now Erin, I think?) is pretty narrow, but I don't think it would be too narrow for you. I think your projection issues are making you think your roots are wider than they really are."

ABraThatFits,3cd3ni,buymeflowers,2,Wed Jul 8 03:58:51 2015 UTC,"In both of these bras it looks like the wires are not encompassing all your tissue in the underarm area - this is fairly indicative of having wide roots. Elomi is a great brand for wide and projected breasts, though you also appear to have a somewhat shorter root, which would explain the gaping in Caitlin (a full cup bra). I'd give Elomi Betty and Jocelyn a try.  While it is possible that trying too shallow bras can ""smoosh"" your breasts and make them look wider, I don't think that's the case here. The Dreamcatcher in 38GG is clearly too big, yet you are still filling out the side of the cups very well, indicating at least an average-wide root."
ABraThatFits,3ccwwg,femtobarn-1,3,Mon Jul 6 22:53:55 2015 UTC,"How did the wires sit on your side root?  Did they seem too wide or narrow?  The wire sitting below your IMF usually means the cup is too shallow for you - your projection is pushing the cup down looking for more room in the cup.  Looking at pictures on bratabase, it doesn't appear overly shallow in the larger size ranges, but also not as immediately projected as some other unlined cups.  Possibly try a Cleo Lily if you can still find one in your size (Erin is the replacement) or Cleo Lucy - which will close in more quickly on the tops of the cups.  Those should be more immediately projected.  Some of Freya's unlined plunge balcony style bras may also work, although rumor has it Gem and Rio are designed for more FOT breasts.  Doodle (yes, that's its name) comes in both 38GG and sister size of 36H - but I'm wondering if 38GG is maybe an overestimate on the calculator's part.  I'm suspecting 38G may also be a possibility, based on the difference between your snug UB and leaning OB.  Panache Envy is also one of the, if not THE, most immediately projected unlined bra I've ever seen in action.  It's always a good idea, if you can swing the funds initially and the items are returnable, to try 2 or 3 sizes in the same bra at once and return the ones that don't work.  I mentioned 36 bands for Freya because their bands are notoriously stretchy and long, but otherwise you should be okay in 38 bands.  Just remember if you sister size to a 36 band, to go up one cup size to maintain the same volume.  Hope that helped and someone else chimes in with more ideas!"
ABraThatFits,3ccwwg,lcl0706,2,Tue Jul 7 02:54:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for all the recommendations! I honestly don't know why I didn't buy several sizes in the first place, but now that I have some better bra recommendations, I'll definitely try that. Also, thanks for the reminder to size up a cup if I size down my band-- I definitely would have forgotten!  Anyway, I'm going to put your recs in a text file and see what I can find.

ABraThatFits,3ccwwg,t_maia,3,Sun Jul 12 03:56:38 2015 UTC,"it seemed like it was made for someone who was very full on top.    Yes, that is normal for the PourMoi? St. Tropez. The underwire sitting below the inframmary fold is also typical for Tropez, it allows very little volume in the bottom cup. Breasts being ""centered"" in the cup is exactly how the St. Tropez is supposed to fit.   That you had empty space on top of the cup and empty space near the wires indicates that you need a smaller cup. The St Tropez runs about one cupsize larger than other bras. Still, try around 38FF/G?    but my breasts are pretty close together and the gore seemed slightly too wide.    St. Tropez has a relatively narrow gore. If it bothers you,  one way to handle this can be to wear plunge bras with a low gore. But this only works with relatively firm breasts.     Given all of this, does anyone have any recommendations for a different size/bra?    I second u/lcl0706 's recommendation to try 2-3 sizes in the same bra. If neither size works, you know it is the bra that is at fault and not the size.   A good first order contains 2-3 models in 2-3 sizes.   By trying bras in different shapes and sizes you can usually quickly find a size that is the best in all bras even if the shape is off. This is finding your size. Once you got your size, you can then order lots of bras in that size.   That said, my recommendation would be to try a bra with a shape that is opposite to St. Tropez next. Cleo Lucy, Goddess Keira/Kayla or Panache Envy would be a good idea."

ABraThatFits,3cae79,Sparkleworks,2,Mon Jul 6 13:07:26 2015 UTC,"Just going to add more info for those interested in these brands: Bendon outlets are the best place to go for Evollove and Fayreform as well as Bendon, Pleasure State and Elle MacPherson/Heidi Klum - The outlets will often have a larger size range still available than normal bendon stores since the bendon brands seem to be reducing the sizes they make (fayreform use to always have J cups and now seem to be phasing them out. Bendon also ditched the old Dimity So line which did 30 bands and up to J cups - Dimity So is still sporadically available in some of the outlet stores but does run very wide/shallow).    The main Bendon brand does up to a UKFF cup (labelled as G cup) above a UK32/NZ 10 band - the cups are more shallow/wide than narrow/projected. Evollove make bands UK30/NZ8 to UK38/NZ16 and cups UKD-UKFF. They're wider/shallower in the cup, although the longline I tried of theirs recently was weirdly shallow with narrow wires. Fayreform only start at 32/10 bands but they do go up to a UKJ in the cup in some lines and don't skip double letters in the cup progression. They're probably your best bet at narrowness/projection in these brands. Pleasure State do the same cups/bands as Evollove but only in a few lines and they're also more expensive and definitely on the shallow end in the cups. Heidi Klum (used to be Elle MacPherson) again start at UK32/NZ10 bands. They go up to a UKG-cup in some lines (this brand doesn't skip double letters). The bands run a bit tighter in this brand and cups are on the shallower side."

Evollove was Bendon's replacement for Dimity So which was done to address some of the issues that made Dimity So sell poorly."

I tried ShapelyFigures, NaturallyClose and SimplyYours, because they are one of the few brands that make bras above UK 40G.

ABraThatFits,3cby76,NedFlounders,8,Mon Jul 6 18:47:27 2015 UTC,"The 32 probably feels tight because there isn't enough room for you in the cups. Try one of your bras on upside down and back to front and you'll probably find that it feels much less tight. 28DD is the equivalent of one cup size up from a 32B so it makes sense that your 32B's are feeling too small. A 34B would technically have better sized cups for you, but the band would be six inches longer than it should be. Imagine wearing trousers with a waist band six inches too big.... It will be easier for you to find 30 inch bands than 28's so maybe start with trying on a 30D? If the band still feels tight then go up a cup size rather than a band size."
ABraThatFits,3cby76,NedFlounders,6,Mon Jul 6 19:10:42 2015 UTC,"So I just tried my bra on upside down and backwards, and I was pretty surprised that it started slipping and couldn't stay up on it's own.

Given that 28DD is hard to find these days, you may want to look for 30D as well. You may find you're more comfortable in 30D as you don't have a lot of difference in your snug and tight measures, and if you can wear that size it adds options for you.  Have you had a look at the Shape Guide? It's helpful to have shape information in order to make more specific recommendations."

ABraThatFits,3cbe4x,BreastLitovsk,5,Mon Jul 6 16:22:37 2015 UTC,Could you add her measurements to your post? I think the calculator in the sidebar is great but it needs some human input sometimes.  Do you know which Panache bra she bought? There should be a style name (like 'Jasmine' or 'Envy') on the tags inside by the hooks. Panache is a large brand that makes many different bra styles that fit differently from one another. Depending on her breast shape certain ones will fit her better and going off that info you can get additional recommendations.

ABraThatFits,3cbio7,petitecollegiate,3,Mon Jul 6 16:56:36 2015 UTC,"Looking at your past posts, I see that you like Freya plunge balconys! I'd recommend looking for a few more of those in 28E; they tend to be inexpensive on sites like Ebay and Amazon because many of us in this size range are too shallow for them. Freya 28s vary in stretchiness in my experience; I've heard from many people that Arabella is hella stretchy so I'd avoid that one. Also Gem and Rio because they don't cater to your shape (they're more FoT). Since you like Icon in particular, try looking for Freya Doodle and Tropics because those will be most similar.   Comexim is actually pretty affordable when it comes down to it. Because of the way the Polish zloty relates to the US dollar, right now Comexim's new bras (which are 130 zloty) would run you about $35. Their older stuff which is on sale (90-100 zloty) is only $25. That doesn't include shipping, of course, but a custom order straight from Comexim is probably your most affordable option. You can't return it if it doesn't fit, but you can sell it to another person through /r/braswap or Bratabase and get back most of your investment. Comexim bras sell like hotcakes.  Because of your underbust, I'd recommend getting the 55 band from Comexim. I think 55G would probably suffice in most of the padded plunges, you might need 55H for the Basic.  I'm also going to tag /u/goodoldfreda in this as she's very similar in shape to you and also wears 26 bands (through alteration and Comexim)."
ABraThatFits,3cbio7,crazymusicalgenius96,3,Mon Jul 6 17:19:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tag!   I'd definitely recommend getting some Comexim bras, a true 26 is amazing to wear. I'd also suggest getting them from Wellfitting to figure out your Comexim size at first, and then looking into custom ordering.  Some other bras that work for me (and I wear Freya plunge balconies) include the Bravissimo Satine (runs a little small in the cup, go for the F and alter the band later), and the Freya Piper Longline (which is more projected than it looks, actually). Not sure if there are any sister cuts to it that are still around, but I'd suggest checking them out, the main reason being that it can afford to be a little looser in the band due to how wide it is."

In your size range Panache Andorra, Panache Jasmine and Panache Envy are best because they got stretchy lace on top of the cup. This allows for size fluctuations and you to easily free the boob for baby.   In larger sizes you commonly have the problem that the gore comes up so high that you cannot fold down the cup. Known bras with this issue are Panache Eliza, Panache Tango, Panache Ariza and their cut siblings as well as the Bestform UK bras. I think some of the Gorgeous by Debenhams bras also had this issue.   Apart from that the Polish companies Ewa Michalak and Melissa Dessous make underwire nursing bras in larger cupsizes."

The bra also looks like it's sitting rather low on your chest, but because the wires are so narrow that's probably as close as it can get to your IMF. And you've got a hint of quadboob, I think, but it's not that noticeable.  36E/F seems like the right size range, you've just had bras that were too projected and/or open on top for you thus far. Cleo Lucy in 36E looks closest to fitting, but the wires are still a bit narrow for you, I think. If the apex of the cup is unfilled (hard to tell from pics) then you probably had some orange-in-a-glass going on.  Target sells a version of this bra in 36DD, which I think would be beneficial for you to try. Gilligan & O'Malley tends to be shallow and wide, which I think would work better for you than the rather narrow and projected Cleo Lucy. If it turns out the 36DD Gilligan & O'Malley is too small, then Natori Feathers in 36DDD might hit the sweet spot shape-wise and size-wise."

ABraThatFits,3cd590,plutonium743,3,Tue Jul 7 01:07:10 2015 UTC,Based on the fit of those and your measurements I think you should revisit the Lucy in a 36DD. Your 34/40 measurements point to a 34E which would sister size to 36DD. The G&O bra is a bit narrow and doesn't quite encase all of your breast tissue. It also seems like you are more full on bottom since the Lucy worked much better than the Marvel did. Lastly it looked like the wires are not fully in your breast fold but it was had to tell in the pictures so I'm not sure. I'd link to the pic from the sidebar but I'm on mobile right now.

ABraThatFits,3cd590,cupcakery,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:02:03 2015 UTC,"I think the wires are definitely low.  OP, if you pull the wires right up into your ""inframammary fold"" will they stay there without the straps being too tight?  if not then with the Lucy the wires probably are too narrow, as the other main reason for them sliding down is a lack of space in the lower half of the cup - ""immediate projection"" or lack of - and this is a bra with decent immediate projection for FOB boobs."
ABraThatFits,3cd590,braaccount,2,Tue Jul 7 10:09:18 2015 UTC,"I don't know what to say about the Marvel (Freya and I don't get along), but the 36E Lucy is close -- I'm not sure if it's a size problem or a shape problem. Unfortunately it's really hard to see what's happening with a dark-colored bra. Are the wires sliding down again after you've adjusted yourself into the cups?  As for the 36C, if it's not hurting you or pushing your breast tissue into weird places, I'm not going to tell you to stop wearing it However, comparing the front shot of the 36C to the front shot of the 36E Lucy shows that you're not getting much support from the 36C -- your breasts are sort of hanging down into the cups. The Lucy is definitely not ideal but it is giving noticeably more lift, which suggests that it's closer to a better size for you. The 36C being a pre-shaped ""foam dome"" is compensating for issues.  If it would be of any interest, I took some pics of myself in similarly contrasting bras: A 40D t-shirt bra (band too big, cup volume too small) and a bra in the right size (36FF, and for as fair a comparison as possible, the most minimizing one I own). NSFW, scary-looking flash pics to show wires.   40D front, 36FF front. Less support from the 40D, which is why there's that valley between my breasts that's not present in the 36FF. 40D side, 36FF side. Drooping in the 40D; the roundness/lift is mostly from the mold of the bra, not my breasts. It's also uncomfortably sliding down my body instead of staying in place, but you can't see that easily because of the molded cup. 40D angle, 36FF angle. Same issues as the side shots really."
ABraThatFits,3cd590,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:05:39 2015 UTC,"Hmm that does help some I can see what you're talking about in your pictures. Maybe I'm not understanding ""lift"" correctly. While you're totally right that of the bras I ordered the 36E Cleo was the best fit, I felt like my breasts were just sitting in it.  While I feel like my 36C lifts my breasts and gives them an appealing shape the difference for me is especially visible from the side views. I'm not looking for mega cleavage or anything, I don't particularly care for padded bras, but I do like them to look rounded."
ABraThatFits,3cd590,Goddess_Keira,2,Tue Jul 7 01:13:40 2015 UTC,"That round look can definitely come from seamed/unlined bras, but they have to be the right shape. I think you're getting close volume-wise but the shape struggle is real and an ongoing effort for everyone. I have bras that technically fit and make my boobs look wide and flat, and other bras that fit and make my boobs look basically augmented. I don't have any additional recommendations beyond Lucy in a 36DD (and if you happen to find it in not-black that will help us judge the shape better). Maybe Panache Andorra in a 36DD or 36E as well? The stretch lace on that one might make the shape a little more forgiving for you."
ABraThatFits,3cd590,t_maia,2,Tue Jul 7 01:39:59 2015 UTC,"""Fit"" means a whole bunch of things, but I'm looking primarily for support up and off the body, and I don't see much of that in the 36C. A pleasing profile, yes, and it's obviously more lifted than if you were wearing no bra, but a lot of that is from the predetermined shape of the cup. That roundness would still be there if you put the bra on a mannequin with no boobs, so it's hard to judge size/shape suitability from that.  The other recommendations you've gotten are good (if you're not feeling burned out!). If nothing else, I'd bet that the same Target bra in a bigger cup size would look/feel even better."
ABraThatFits,3cble5,meezerface,6,Mon Jul 6 17:17:01 2015 UTC,"You are not shallow; in fact you have a very projected shape. It also looks like you may have fairly narrow roots. The bras you're trying there look too shallow and wide for you. The Freya Deco may not be comfortable because it's too shallow at the bottom and moves out of your IMF.   As you like the feel of the Freya bras, you should try some Freya balcony bras.  Freya Rio and Gem are good for full on top, though I'm not sure you're that as opposed to being more of a full, even shape. Try also something like Freya Enchanted plunge or Arabella or Patsy in the unlined plunge cut.  Edit: Forgot fit comments. Lepel Fiore is way too small and shallow in the cup for you.  It's an extreme shape mismatch. Deco looks a cup size small and is sitting a bit low on you. You could try pulling it into your IMF, but I doubt it would stay there. Instinct; too shallow again and a little small in the cups. The wrinkling is because of lack of immediate projection. It looks like the wires might be being pulled too far back and slightly distorted. The photos are fuzzy so it's hard to tell. It's not too small in the band, so if the wires are pulling it's because of the shallow cups. That said, if it really feels great on, and you like it, keep it! There will be lots of other bras to try, but sometimes it's fine to keep one that's not the greatest fit, if you'll get good use and enjoyment out of it.  Panache Jasmine or Envy would probably be a good fit on you, but could be uncomfortable to wear because of the tighter bands and harder wires. Fantasie side support bras may be good for you, such as Fantasie Susanna, Lois, Jana, or a host of others they have."
ABraThatFits,3cble5,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:30:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback. I'm sorry the photos are low quality and so some things may be a little misleading on them I think (or maybe not, but I'll ask in order to clarify).  I checked up a bunch more on projection, root width and full on bottom/top/balanced. I am still quite confused about projection, but I'm pretty certain the roots of my breasts are wide (they touch in the middle, and the tissue extends out to under my arm, like in this diagram for wide roots and others: http://www.bratabase.com/help/shapes/). I'm also fairly certain at this point that I am full on top (not necessarily very full on top) rather than balanced. Looking in the mirror, the bottom of my breast looks flat. :( My nipples point very much towards the floor. Edit: I don't know I'm really going argh because I feel like my breasts are pretty awful/ugly/saggy. :(  I am having a little trouble understanding how to tell something is too shallow in the cups. What are the signs of this with bras like the Instinct? I cannot see it and would like to know what I'm looking for in future.  I appreciate the recommendations greatly. I'm going to return the Deco and see if I can try one of the other Freya bras. I've not had great experiences with Panache in the past (have owned a bunch of their bras) but have never tried Fantasie. Are they less tight/hard?  I have to say I'm a little heartbroken about the Fiore, I thought it looked pretty good on me. Oh well!  Thanks again for the feedback."
ABraThatFits,3cble5,Goddess_Keira,3,Mon Jul 6 21:41:22 2015 UTC,"I checked up a bunch more on projection, root width and full on bottom/top/balanced. I am still quite confused about projection   You can tell your breasts are projected by how much they want to stick out forward once you get into a bra that starts lifting them up. You do have somewhat pendulous breasts, but there's nothing wrong with that; many of us do. Please try not to be so hard on your body shape!   I am having a little trouble understanding how to tell something is too shallow in the cups. What are the signs of this with bras like the Instinct? I cannot see it and would like to know what I'm looking for in future.   For one thing, that wrinkling that you are getting underneath the cups even though, if anything, the cup is small on you. This indicates that the bottom of the cup hasn't got enough projection for you. I can't tell for sure in that photo, but it looks as though the Instinct isn't tacking on you, or not tacking fully. I could be wrong on that, though; I may just not be seeing it well enough. But if you compare it to the Rapture, which does tack but is big in the cup, you can see that the ""bignesss"" of it looks to be mostly excess width in the cup. So, in order to get a cup that was large enough to accommodate your forward projection, you ended up with excess width on the sides.  The shallowness is easiest to see in the Lepel bra, actually. You can see that it is small in the cup and not close to tacking on you, but if you look to the gore, you will see excess width in the cup even though your breasts are very close set. There's room in the cups at the side but again, not near enough forward projection for your breasts so the bra just kind of falls forward. It sounds like you've been wearing it already, though, and really, if you are finding it good for you there's no reason to stop wearing it.   Regarding root width, that's often confusing. Your breasts being close-set and touching in the middle doesn't make your root wide. If you do have tissue extending into the armpit, then yes, that would be a wide root and I could be wrong in how I judged that. It looked to me that you might have space between your roots and the wires in those bras, but it is hard to see. (No need to apologize for the photos, BTW, I was just explaining why I'm not able to see some things). If you look at the line of the underwire when you take one of the half-cups off, can you see the edge of your breast tissue and does the wire fall just outside the edge? Or can you see if there's space where the root of your breast ends and the wire line is? Often root width doesn't become clear until you've compared quite a few bras on you. Sometimes you can see the end of your root if you push in on the breast so that it makes a crease where the root ends, and sometimes you can tell that you have lots of breast tissue in the armpit because it gets tender around the time of ""shark week"".   Fantasie bras are definitely less tight and hard than Panache. Also, if you do have a wide root, then Elomi bras could be an option for you."
ABraThatFits,3cble5,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:14:17 2015 UTC,"Well, today I have re-assessed things with a less frustrated mind. As I mentioned above..it seems my breasts are actually smaller today when I re-tried things? Which is odd, but the Deco fit better as a result. It let me see that the wire width on it was better than on the Instinct/Rapture. I've returned the Rapture so I can better use the money, but am keeping the Instinct since it is still comfortable for now!  I have been looking into bras with more projection. I appreciate the suggestions above greatly. I've ordered a couple of Elomi plunge bras from the Asos sale to see if those work out for me, if not, returns are free anyway. :)   I admit I am wary with unlined bras. Most seem to be made out of net/mesh/lace material and this seems to irritate my skin a whole lot, to the point I feel like someone's attacked my nipples with sandpaper after a few hours. Previous Panache unlined bras I owned had this issue (the horrendous coneboobing Tango II balcony bra and another that I don't recall the model of, long thrown away). For this reason I've tended towards lined or padded bras. Is this likely to be a problem in finding something of the right shape?"

Is this likely to be a problem in finding something of the right shape?   It might be, depending on what brands you can get a good fit in and also wear comfortably. For example, some Panache might fit you well but you have not had luck finding comfort in that brand. They have bras that might work for you and the fabric will likely be more comfortable than the Tango--Jasmine and Envy come to mind. however they all have the hard wires, though I think Tango's wires are taller.  Elomi's Caitlyn and Rita bras have nice, soft, comfy fabric in an unlined bra, so long as you don't mind full coverage. They do also have some of the widest wires out there, though.  If you ever want to really splash out, try the Prima Donna Madison full cup style. It's $$$ but a really comfy, well-made bra. It's also in EU sizes so you'd want to try it most likely in 36I. You will often find Prima Donna in specialty boutiques, but don't be pressured into buying until you're sure it's the right fit because it's an expensive item. Their Deauville style is good too, though I prefer the Madison (of which there are a few cuts, but the full cup is my favourite)."

ABraThatFits,3cc3lb,lauracb,3,Mon Jul 6 19:36:45 2015 UTC,"Her torso is likely more \ / shaped than | | shaped. The bras don't really take that into account; and measuring can only measure the diameter of the ribcage, not the shape so much, nor what is fleshy tissue and what is muscle. Edit: I forgot, though, the difference between snug and tight measurements would be small in somebody very muscular or with little excess fat. That's where the shape and style of the bra come into play. Sizing up in the band may be a good strategy, especially if she's between band sizes. Some brands will be more suitable than others--e.g., Shock Absorber is very good for high impact, at least in part because of its double-closure design in back, but besides it running very tight in the band it's probably not the best choice for a muscular upper back.  More specific recommendations need measurements, shape information and it also helps to know what kind of activities she'll use the bra for."

The circumference of the top and bottom of a bra band will be the same, whereas the circumference of my back is not, as it tapers in a V shape. The lower cut the bra is, the less size difference will be in the area the band hits.  As others mentioned, the difference between her snug and tight measurements will likely be small; this should give her a good idea on what size bra to buy.

He ended up sending me for a mammogram just to determine what the cause of the growth was. Fortunately (?) it was just fat and not breast tissue. I've noticed that the tissue hasn't reduced with further weight loss, so I continue to wear a bra as part of my daily attire. I've been wearing one full time for about 2 months solid now, perhaps longer. I have opted to not wear a bra for certain weekly events, but usually it's just for a few hours. At the end of it though, I'm reminded why I wear a bra to begin with. Just to confirm, I've even attempted to go a full day without one, but every time I regret it.  The hardest part for me is the social aspect of it. Most of my immediate family knows I wear one, but certain others may not take it well so I choose to not share with them unless they ask.

ABraThatFits,3c9ut4,t_maia,2,Mon Jul 6 12:26:52 2015 UTC,"Okay, so at least I'm not totally crazy thinking 34 was going to be too tight. That's good to hear!  And the consensus seems to be 'try everything, check the UK sizing first'. I'll keep that in mind and try not to lose my mind trying on bras today."
ABraThatFits,3c9ut4,hurrrrrmione,4,Mon Jul 6 16:32:24 2015 UTC,"I'm getting 36E or 34F. It's going to depend on whether you find 36 bands or 34 bands more comfortable. You might even find that in some bras you prefer a 36 band and in others you prefer a 34 band. So try on both sizes.   The calculator and this sub use UK sizing, which is different from US sizing. The main reason we do this is different US brands label their cup sizes differently over DD. So look for the UK size on tags when you go shopping!  I recommend going to Nordstrom if there's one near you! They should have plenty of bras in your size range."

I ordered three bras on Amazon Prime, 2 x 32FF and 1 34F as I too am dubious about the band size.   I should get them by Wed, if I remember I'll come back to let you know how I get on :)"
ABraThatFits,3c9jxg,keeblerleigh,3,Mon Jul 6 03:57:01 2015 UTC,"Oh jeez! Sounds like those bruises might be from too narrow wires if you're wide and shallow. Based on your measurements, I'd try a 36 E/F or a 38E since your snug is close to 38 so a 36 might still be uncomfortable.   For your shape my best recommendation is curvy Kate since in bigger sizes they get wide and shallow typically.   edit: those bruises seem more like maybe too tight of band on second thought? It's late here and I'm at work so I'm derping a bit"
ABraThatFits,3c9jxg,Moonforehead,2,Mon Jul 6 06:14:51 2015 UTC,"I thought the same thing about the bruising after I read about shape. I never even thought about how that would affect fit until I read that. I definitely need to get something with a wider underwire if I go that route again. I don't think it's the band, even though it's definitely tight, because the bruising is very localised.  Have you used Curvy Kate? I browsed some of the bras online, but none of them seemed like my style. I've been in more plunge-style bras because I like to be able to wear lower V necks if I decide to. The ones i saw from them all seemed very full coverage with a  large gore."
ABraThatFits,3c9jxg,joanna70,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:40:35 2015 UTC,"Gores vary with style, and which style you can wear will depend on your shape and tissue.  A shorter gore by definition becomes more of a plunge style, and some women's boobs will migrate out of the middle of them.  Some will find they just can't find the right shaped cup in a plunge style, there is more variety in balconette shapes, and shallow shapes tend to need half cups.  Half cups too tend to have higher gores but they're not high coverage bras.  I will say though that we're so used to seeing people in 2-3 cup sizes too small that we forget the bra is too small and just think it's normal coverage.  A well fitting and supportive bra will always, on average, have more coverage, but they do vary."
ABraThatFits,3c9jxg,Moonforehead,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:11:33 2015 UTC,"I've always liked the look of the balconette style, but have never found one that fit comfortably.

ABraThatFits,3c9jxg,khasiv,3,Mon Jul 6 20:19:47 2015 UTC,"You're in luck because 36DD/E (E=DDD/F in some US brands) does sound like a good place to start, and it should be really easy to find bras in 36DD and not too bad in 36E. I would check out the shallow guide in the side bar to get some recommendations in bras that should work for your shape. It would be a good idea to try at least a few seamed bras when you're starting out to help narrow down your shape and size, because molded bras tend to hide a lot of signs of bad fit.    However, depending on how shallow you are, the molded-plunge t-shirt type bras that are everywhere in US stores could work for you, as they tend to be moderately wide and shallow. I believe Target is supposed to have fairly shallow bras in 36DD. For 36E, you will probably need to go to a department store like Nordstrom's or Dillards or to somewhere like VS or Soma (but don't let them measure you). Keep in mind that gaping does not always mean the bra is too large; it can also be a sign of shape-mismatch."

The bra size calculator said that I would wear a 30C, which is what i have the most of but they just seem a touch too small.   As for my shape, I am 5 feet tall and 110 pounds, so I am quite petite. I broke a few ribs that lay under my band in the front (3 ribs, just to the left of my sternum), so I can't handle anything too tight. My breasts are quite wide set, but generally fairly round for their size. I do have a recent pic of them, but I wasn't sure if I could link to one. They are also quite low, but not sagging if that makes sense. The majority of the tissue starts just below the top of my chicken cutlet."
ABraThatFits,3cbp52,noys,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:17:24 2015 UTC,"My measurements are only an inch apart, it means you are shallow, or have firm tissue.  30C seems most likely but don't rule out being bigger, it's rare but I take a bigger cup size than my bigger measurement indicates.    Shape is more about breast shape, did you read the Shape Guide in the side bar?  Sounds like low set but self supporting, wide set means you can tolerate a wide gore, may even need it.  Your root width and height will be useful, if you have a broad root then you are likely shallow, and the other aspects of shape such as full on top or bottom become much less relevant.  If you have firm tissue but are projected then your actual breast shape is important.   With space in the top of your bras you may be firm and FOB (full on the bottom) or have a very tall sloping root, two possibilities anyway. I am the latter (shallow in all ways) and wear half cups such as Freya Patsy."

I can tell you if you want a sports bra, the Panache Sport is one that's generally thought of very highly here. It comes in a wired and non-wired version.   As far as buying a whole new bra now then having to get another in a few weeks, I'm not sure what to tell ya. Your breast size may change as you stop lactating. The Panache Sport is definitely a great bra to have in your proper size, though! It's by far the most supportive sports bra I've ever had.   If you don't so much need it for support, I'd recommend a cotton bralette from Target or some such place. They'd be sized S/M/L instead of bra sized, so it might be more forgiving if your size fluctuates (plus cheaper)."
ABraThatFits,3c909u,mynameislucaIlive,10,Mon Jul 6 00:50:56 2015 UTC,Could you maybe pick up a few cheap wireless sports bras and wear those for a few weeks?
ABraThatFits,3c909u,hurrrrrmione,2,Mon Jul 6 01:10:39 2015 UTC,That's probably a good idea. Right now I honestly only have the one bra (I didn't realize that I wasn't taking care of my bra properly let alone that owning more than one was pretty much nesesary) so I'll probably stop by somewhere and pick some up.

ABraThatFits,3c909u,k_fairy,5,Mon Jul 6 06:51:07 2015 UTC,"From my friends who were done breastfeeding, they said it helped a lot if the leaves were cold first.

ABraThatFits,3c9hhm,sunnydale_razorbacks,2,Mon Jul 6 03:32:23 2015 UTC,"underwire always pokes through the end of the channel in the center.    This can be a size problem. If the cup is too small for your breasts, the wire will usually be too small too. The wire gets bent under pressure and then sooner or later something breaks, either the wire or the wire channel. The bras being cheap does not help at all.  With your shape description you might like Panache Andorra, Fantasie bras, Panache Sculptresse ChiChi.   I would encourage you to try both both 40F/FF and 38 FF/G. Your options are significantly larger in a 38 band than in a 40, if you find the 38 bands too tight use them with an extender.   Note that Sculptresse runs tight in the band."
ABraThatFits,3c9hhm,t_maia,2,Mon Jul 6 12:54:15 2015 UTC,"For your price range and hoping to get something in a B&M store, I'd look for Goddess brand. They are a sister brand to Elomi and their bras can be had for ~$45.00 and up. generally, but you may be able to get a sale price. However, not every store will carry your size range--for a department store, Nordstrom is probably best. Goddess comes in US sizes though they will show the conversion to UK on the tag. You may want either 40 or 38 in their bands, as it depends how tight you like the band and many do find their bands run stretchy.  You might also find bras at Lane Bryant in your size and price range if they're having a sale, which is often. You'd want 40F or 40G in their sizing, or 38G/38H if you go down to a 38 band, which you may as their bands are quite stretchy as well."
ABraThatFits,3c9hhm,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:49:24 2015 UTC,"A combination of machine washing and cheap bras is probably the reason for the underwires poking through.   Your  measurements are similar to mine (Snug underbust - 40"" Tight underbust - 38"" Standing overbust - 47"" Leaning - 48.5"" Lying - 46"") and I found that 40 bands are too big so you might want to try 38 bands as well as 40 to see which work best for you. I will note that in Elomi I actually prefer a 36 band. I suspect that you might end up in 38FF/G like me.  An advantage of a 38 band is that there are more styles available than in a 40.  With close set breasts, you might prefer plunge styles - Elomi make a few, I have Betty and Jocelyn. You might also want to try Cleo Lily which is good for even breast - probably in a 38G and some of the Sculptresse balconettes."

ABraThatFits,3c7p1v,frankchester,13,Sun Jul 5 17:51:13 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry you had so much trouble with this! Bra troubles are hard, especially with sports bras. What regular bras do you have right now that fit? Starting from there will help us find the most similar sports bra. Also, are you looking for encapsulation (wires) or compression (no wires)?  What brand was the 40F? Was that the Glamorise? Glamorise bras are kind of oddly made anyway, the cups are often ridiculously tall because they're meant to hold in the quadboob of a woman who needs a larger cup volume/more projection. Their 40F is more like 40E UK, so that may have also contributed to your inability to hook it shut. Generally they're tall and shallow and don't fit anyone very well unless you attempt to squeeze yourself into one that's far too small.  Panache Sport also has rather tall cups, so maybe that's why it was coming so far down on your torso. It wasn't sliding there, was it? Could you get the underwires into your inframammary fold? We do occasionally suggest sizing down in the cups if you have particularly short roots or you're very FoB, so perhaps a 38F would have helped with that.  There are other sports bras that come in 40F, such as Elomi Energise and Freya Active. I haven't heard too much about either, excepting that both brands are known for having quite stretchy bands, so I don't think you'd need to go up to 42 band in either of those. Bravissimo also has their own sports bra called Inspire, but they seem to be out of them in pretty much every size.   There's a brand called Shock Absorber that makes excellent sports bras but they tend to run a full band size tight, so I think you'd be sized out. Is that the brand of the one you tried in the other store near you?"
ABraThatFits,3c7p1v,crazymusicalgenius96,4,Sun Jul 5 18:21:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your advice.   My current favourite bra is a Panache Envy Balcony. I purchased in white in a 38FF and loved it because it gave that sorta 'pointy' look (pushed everything forward) so I ordered a second in black and it came up a full 1.5"" short, so I've put an extender in it and it fits fine.   The original Panache sportsbra I ordered was a basic underwired bra but I think you're right in that it was very long. I am short-torsoed and also fat, so I can't have things that sit too low on the ribcage because they noticeably dig in to my belly. I got it done up but no, I didn't get it into the fold, it almost felt closer to my waist! So uncomfy.   Could you explain what FoB means? My breasts are far-set apart and bust apex/nipples sit quite far apart, not sure how that translates into aBTF lingo.  Shock Absorber was the brand I tried on in the shop in a 40F and couldn't get it done up. The others were 38's I think in Debehams-own (Gorgeous range, which I usually really like) but I was so frustrated I didn't bother trying them on.  I would have to wait until next month, but I've been thinking about just splashing the cash and ordering a full range in a few different sizes to try on and then returning. As I said my friend works at a place that gives me roughly 60-80% off so it really does make sense, but essentially ""buying the store"" will set me back maybe a hundred. The brands they have are Triumph, Shock Absorber, Glamorise, and Royce."

In this case I think you'll do well in the Elomi Energise if you can find your  size in it. Like many sportsbras the Energise runs tight in the band, so you probably want to size up in the band to a 40. Black bras tend to run tighter than white bras, btw. The cups of the Energise run large, so you probably have to try more than one size to get the correct support. But I personally found it to be the best sportsbra for larger busts out there."

If you lean forwards 90 degrees and look in a mirrror then your nipples, if FOB, will point towards your head.  FOB is about cup shape, how much projection there is in the bottom (more projection in the bottom half of a FOB bra), being wide set means you may need or at least can take a wider gore, and means your wires may not need to be as wide as someone who is close set, but there is no direct correlation.

Shockabsorber runs tight in the band, I could not do up their 40 band bras despite being a solid 40 band in regular bras at the time.   The Royce Impact Free was no problem, I could put it on just fine. But I got zero support from it, I wiggled more in that thing than in my regular bras so this was a no-go.

Measure yourself according to the guide in the sidebar and we'll help you figure out if there's a size that could work better for you than what you've got right now.   We usually tell people to do what you already do to balance out uneven breasts (buy a bra to fit the larger side, then shorten the strap and pad the smaller side). Ewa Michalak, a Polish brand, makes bras with insert pockets and padding available to balance out the smaller side. I've also seen a couple Wacoal models like this. I would imagine a mastectomy bra isn't quite what you need, as you have breast tissue on both sides (just not the same amount).   Very few women have perfectly symmetrical boobs - pretty much everyone has at least a slight difference in size and/or shape. I've got a cup size difference myself. So you are not alone!"

Your snug underbust is closer to 32 than 30, so a 30 band will be too tight. The calculator has been spitting out too tight bandsizes lately, I need to have a chat with it!    so the larger boob just barely has a tiny quadboob and the smaller boob just fills the cup. But I think I was supposed to fit to the larger boob? Or maybe it's ok to settle for this type of fit?   In your case (just a tiny bit of quadboob) it is ok to settle for this kind of fit.  Try lengthening the strap on the larger side and shortening it on the smaller, this can solve asymetry issues up to one cupsize."

Using your tight underbust, I get 27.5 in = 69.85 cms. From the tight underbust in cms you normally round down to the next five, this gives your EU bandsize. However you are so close to 70 that 70/32 is the better, more comfortable size. Depends a bit upon the loose underbust too - as a rule of thumb the bandsize should be 7-12 cms smaller than the EU bandsize in cms.   Your snug underbust is 31.5 in or 80 cms. 80 cms minus 7 is 73, minus 12 is 68 - both numbers point to a 70/32 band."

ABraThatFits,3c98lm,t_maia,3,Tue Jul 7 02:33:55 2015 UTC,"I think 30E is a good place to start. That has approximately the same volume cups as a 32DD, a 34D, and a 36B, so that explains why the 32D felt too small and the 34D feels much better than your old 36A bra.   Here's pictures of women wearing properly fitted 30E bras -  hope that helps with the ""sticker shock"" :)"
ABraThatFits,3c98lm,hurrrrrmione,2,Mon Jul 6 02:28:09 2015 UTC,"Please take a look at the OPs snug underbust measurement. It is 31.5 inches. I would not recommend a 30E with this underbust measurement, a 32DD will be tight enough (if it is not a VS bra)."

ABraThatFits,3c98lm,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:52:51 2015 UTC,"You only go down with large breasts (above 32H and sistersizes) and large bandsizes above 38. Even then you'd go down 1 inch max, not 1.5 inches.   Smaller bands stretch less, for this reason it is best to err on the side of caution and go +2 if it is bands below 32.   There is a reason why so many people who measure 28 inches underbust do better in a 30 band.

How low a gore do you estimate you need? (you can either measure the gores on your current bras or look up their measurements on Bratabase)  Edit: Oh, and if it makes you feel any better, I have firm tissue and measure at a 32FF/G and also have a 3.5"" difference between my standing and leaning busts."
ABraThatFits,3c86z9,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:24:22 2015 UTC,"Haha yes, out of! That's a definite typo. I managed to get it right in every other bra where that's a problem. Sorry!  I've looked at the shape guide. I don't really look like any of their pictures at all. I guess I'm probably even since I'm not full on top or bottom. I've been told I had a wide root here in the past when I mentioned it being painful at my armpits but I'm really starting to question that analysis. The only time I have breast tissue back there is if my bra is on and it's being squished over there. When I bend over at a 90 degree angle my root looks pretty narrow to me. I just put on the Floris and if I scoop and swoop all my tissue ends well before the underwire.  I don't know if I need a lower gore or just a more narrow gore.  For my standing/leaning bust it isn't just the inches difference.. it's the shape!"
ABraThatFits,3c86z9,hurrrrrmione,4,Mon Jul 6 00:51:18 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you don't have enough projection in any of these.   Could you try some of the bras on upside-down and backwards? Too small or too shallow cups can make a band feel too tight when it's actually the right size. Your measurements indicate you might prefer a 32"" band over a 34"" band.   Roots can be hard to tell. Do you find that most bras you've tried have a good wire width or are the wires often sitting on your breast tissue under your arms or ending past the breast tissue under your arms? It does sound like the wires on the Floris are too wide for you."
ABraThatFits,3c86z9,CatenaryFairy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:06:56 2015 UTC,I do think I need a tighter band in some of them - the Curvy Kate and Freya Patsy both feel very loose in the band. I can fit a whole hand the wide way into the bands!  I think the wires might be ending past the breast tissue under arms since when I scoop and swoop it all comes way farther forward. Since they are soft they sort of fall into that space and smoosh over to fill out the underwires but it isn't comfortable and I feel more comfortable when it is all brought forward.
ABraThatFits,3c86z9,CatenaryFairy,3,Mon Jul 6 01:20:33 2015 UTC,"I think you might be be very projected, that's usually the cause of bras not staying in the IMF, the bra doesn't have enough bottom projection, so it slides down to try and find some.   Do you know how wide your roots are? Do your wires tend to sit on breast tissue, or extend past it into the armpit? Are the painful red marks at the armpits of Floris on top from the straps, or underneath, from the wires?   Have you ever tried the Cleo Lily/Erin? It's got a lot of projection and narrow wires, although you may be too full-on-bottom for it."
ABraThatFits,3c86z9,Shanakitty,2,Sun Jul 5 23:44:19 2015 UTC,I'm starting to think that might be the case. I feel like my boobs almost need a bra that goes straight out like a shelf to support them!   I've been told I had a wide root here in the past when I mentioned it being painful at my armpits but I'm really starting to question that analysis. The only time I have breast tissue back there is if my bra is on and it's being squished over there. When I bend over at a 90 degree angle my root looks pretty narrow to me. I just put on the Floris and if I scoop and swoop all my tissue ends well before the underwire.   Edit - No I haven't tried either of those bras. I'm not sure I'm full on bottom. I'm just definitely not full on top.
ABraThatFits,3c86z9,Shanakitty,3,Mon Jul 6 00:59:44 2015 UTC,"You may be ""short rooted"", which means that your breasts just aren't very tall, so you have trouble filling out tops of cups, even if you aren't full on bottom. I'm short rooted, but slightly full-on-top, I just can't fill out the tops of bras.   If you lean over 90 degrees, do your nipples point straight down (even) , towards your toes (full on top) , or towards your face (full on bottom)?  As for root width, when you've been wearing a bra a while, take it off and look in the mirror at the side of your breasts. Squish them backwards a little until you can see a crease, if the red mark from your bra is further back from the crease, it's too wide for you. This works for me, but I think if you have a really wide root, it doesn't create a good squish-crease."
ABraThatFits,3c86z9,32Goobies,2,Mon Jul 6 01:23:53 2015 UTC,"My nipples point straight down so I guess I'm pretty even.   I've tried every trick in the book for determining root width and I still can't get a clear answer. My breast tissue is too soft for that to work. If the underwire is wide, my soft tissue will go there and fill out the bra (making the cup gap other places). Therefore the red marks will end up on my breast tissue. I don't think that is because I have a wide root though. I think it's because that's where my breast tissue is going while I'm in a bra. I feel like I need a nice firm underwire to hold it all forward because it looks and feels better when it is there. I'm think maybe I've got migrated tissue back there that needs to come forward?"
ABraThatFits,3c86z9,32Goobies,2,Mon Jul 6 01:47:27 2015 UTC,"You might want to try something that's really narrow, projected, and even then, like Cleo Lily/Erin, which I believe is also friendly to short roots (but it does have a fairly tall, stiff gore). But if you have migrated tissue, then it's important to have underwires that are wide enough to encompass it all and not sit on your roots. I think it is also possible (though less common) to be projected and still have wide roots.   How tall are you? Is the underwire sitting on breast tissue, or is it poking your actual armpits because the wires are too tall? If that's the case, you need something with a short wing height. If you are narrow and projected, you might want to consider something like Comexim, which tends to have low, soft wires. With your soft tissue though, and if you have short roots, you might want request a raised gore and lowered cup height. It would be a good idea to try a standard one first from someone on /r/braswap or Bratabase or something to get an idea of what size you'd need."
ABraThatFits,3c86z9,32Goobies,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:38:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I will ever figure out my roots. When I just let my breasts splay naturally the root looks so wide but when I crease test it looks narrow.  I never even though of it being a height issue! I'm quite short at 5'0"" and have a very short torso from rib cage to neck. It does tend to be just the top end of the wire that hurts me."
ABraThatFits,3c86z9,32Goobies,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:10:24 2015 UTC,"Ok, I think you should try some narrow, projected bras from somewhere with free returns and see how it goes. Floris and Envy should've been moderately narrow and projected, but Floris is more full-on-top friendly (it's based on Cleo Marcie), and Envy is not as projected as Jasmine and Lily/Erin."
ABraThatFits,3c86z9,Bulbysaur123,2,Mon Jul 6 17:51:22 2015 UTC,"I had a nearly impossible time with my roots but I eventually determined they were narrow from how they looked when I leaned over: they just hung off my body straight away from my chest. Very projected and very narrow roots. . Once I knew that it got much better. Everything you've said sounds identical to me (no top fullness but not FOB, pendulous, super soft, feels like you just need a shelf to support them, wires sliding down, cups creasing, breasts set low on the chest etc.) so I want to say you likely have a similar shape. I have pain and red marks on my armpits but I was told and belive that it's because I have a rather low Tail of Spence, which probably is related to how low my boobs are set, and the wires run against it and irritate it. I'd need to buy bras with lower wires on the sides, which I've had only moderate luck with this far. But I'd rather have that than other serious fit issues."

ABraThatFits,3c9qmr,0knikki0,4,Mon Jul 6 05:07:44 2015 UTC,"I'd probably start off with the 32 because your measurement is 32.5, it may be a little snug but will give way after wearing it. 30 is 2.5 inches smaller than your measurement so may be too tight. I'd definitely try the D/DD. Cup size is relative to band size, so it's not as huge as it sounds. The reason why your underwires poked out was because the cups were too small."
ABraThatFits,3c9qmr,Bulbysaur123,2,Mon Jul 6 05:59:52 2015 UTC,"I agree that you should try 32D/DD.  I went through a similar size change and had the same sticker shock.  When a bra feels too tight, it could be due to band size OR cup size.  In this case, the cups are too small for your boobs, so they're escaping out the sides and sitting under the band, making the band feel tight (and causing fit issues like underwire poking out).  You can take your current bra, try it on backwards with the cups flipped down, and see how the band feels now.  It probably feels loose.    What kind of shape do you think you have?  https://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/wiki/shape_guide It's very common for women in our size to be shallow."
ABraThatFits,3c9qmr,syrashiraz,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:41:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure on the shape. Sometimes it seems that I can fill out a cup on the bottom, but not the top. Is that from being a little projected? Could it just be that apparently I'm wearing the wrong size?  All of the projected vs. shallow pictures look the same to me, to be honest :(. I can't tell."
ABraThatFits,3c9edc,whatsmysize1,11,Mon Jul 6 03:03:13 2015 UTC,"Your measurements come to halfway between 28C and 28D, so your sister sizes would be 30B and 30C. However, I would not recommend a 30 band because your standing bust measurement is 30"".   Check the offline retailer list to see if there are any stores in your area that carry 28 bands or 30 bands.   If you don't mind ordering online and are in the US, Target has some 28C bras for about $25 here."
ABraThatFits,3c9e4j,greenpencilbox,4,Mon Jul 6 03:00:34 2015 UTC,"since the band size is still D   D actually refers to cup size (more specifically the difference in inches between your bust and underbust). The number is the band size, so you're actually measuring a band smaller than what you currently wear. Additionally, 30D is actually a cup size smaller than 32D, as cup size isn't static.   With your underbust measurements being so close together it wouldn't be unusual for you to prefer a band size up. However a 32 band definitely shouldn't feel painful unless the cup is currently too small or you have a shape incompatibility, unless you have a medical issue causing increased sensitivity. I second the suggestion to scoop and swoop as well as try your bra on backwards. Also make sure when you do bust measurements that you arent compressing your breast tissue at all. Other than that we would need some info on your shape - a too shallow cup could make your band feel tighter than it is as well, so check out the shape guide and see what you think."
ABraThatFits,3c9e4j,-tallywa-,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:38:57 2015 UTC,"Just when I thought I was getting the hang of bra and bra sizings haha... I think I figured out what was painful, the underwire/bottom-half front part of the bra (where I made that red line lol)"
ABraThatFits,3c9e4j,hurrrrrmione,2,Mon Jul 6 20:20:18 2015 UTC,Can you try your new bra on upside-down and backwards? The band should feel comfortably snug and should stay up by itself.   Are you scooping and swooping?
ABraThatFits,3c7d04,zilbet,7,Sun Jul 5 15:56:13 2015 UTC,"Can you post the 5 measurements you used in the calculator? That will help a lot. Also, you think you're shallow but have underwire digging in the armpits it's possible you're more projected and the wide cups that shallow breasts should have for support and you may need narrower wires for projection.   What worries me the most is you were sold two bras by the same maker in cup sizes 2 off from each other. Not only that but if the armpits were digging, that should have been an indication to show you bras with narrower cups. Pictures would be helpful to double check the fit, but just based on what you've described I think a narrower more projected bra would be what you're looking for. As for the cup size, I'm not sure which to suggest without your 5 measurements."
ABraThatFits,3c7d04,Moonforehead,4,Sun Jul 5 17:19:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the response! I just had my boyfriend help re-measure me and it turned out slightly bigger than what I did on my own, so maybe that was a problem, too. The measurements I just got are: Snug: 33 Tight: 32 Standing:39 Leaning: 39 Lying: 38  So now it's saying 34 E as my main size. Hmm.. Here are some pictures of the two bras: http://imgur.com/a/8NlZ5   Thank you again for the help! I've gained some weight and am a little self conscious, but I felt like when she said that the weight gain was the reason that it had more over hang seemed wrong. It should be more flattering, right? Not something I just have to deal with? I also asked about the gapping on the top (even though it's only a little) and she told me that was fine and that she couldn't see it looking straight on at me, so not to worry about it.."
ABraThatFits,3c7d04,Moonforehead,9,Sun Jul 5 18:09:42 2015 UTC,"Oh my those bands look too tight! I can see why you think that's uncomfortable around the armpits, it looks like the band is stretching a lot there. The cups don't look like they're too wide, but are you scooping and swooping your breast tissue into the cups?   That red bra looks like it's too small in the cup as well, whereas the tan looks better so I agree a 34 E would be a good way for you to go since that's a sister size for your 32 F.   The gaping at the top could be lack of scoop and swoop, I'll fitting bra (since it's obviously too tight we know it's the wrong fit), or just the wrong shape for your breasts. Some of my bras I'll have slight gaping at the top being a little more FoB but that's not a huge problem IMO.   I'd suggest going forward trying on 34E/F bras. I think those 32s are going to be too tight to be comfortable and you'll end up stretching the band out like crazy. Or you can buy extenders and wear the 32F still on the extender. I think the DD is a lost cause given your measurements.   I hope this helps you!"
ABraThatFits,3c7d04,hurrrrrmione,2,Sun Jul 5 18:59:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, it does! Thank you! Any suggestions on if I should stay with this style of bra or try different styles?"
ABraThatFits,3c7d04,lcl0706,3,Sun Jul 5 23:23:31 2015 UTC,"Can you check something for me? On the Neve it looks like the underwire is sitting a bit below your IMF and/or there's some empty space at the bottom of the cup. Can you put it on again and check for this? Make sure you're putting the bra up into your IMF and scooping and swooping, then wear the bra for a bit and see if the wire slides down. You can check to see if there's empty space at the bottom of the cup by poking the cup with your finger and seeing if the cup is able to depress/if your finger is poking breast tissue or not.   I love your Man Ray tattoo, by the way!"
ABraThatFits,3c7d04,cupcakery,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:52:59 2015 UTC,"It's not a huge amount, but after looking for that I think there is a tiny bit of empty space. It almost looks like it's wrinkling just the teensiest bit when I pulled it up to make sure it was right at the IMF and feels like it gaps more at the top. Again, nothing dramatic, but still pretty uncomfortable. I think I may just have to try to sell these. I'm even more frustrated with this shop now! They tout themselves as being the best place for 'size and comfort' in my town, but the whole place smelled like stale cigarettes, I spent over $100 and now I'm not sure either of them are even appropriate!

ABraThatFits,3c7uey,hurrrrrmione,3,Sun Jul 5 23:33:20 2015 UTC,"Bravissimo is a great place to go, but it helps to measure yourself before you go just to make sure the fitter is in the right ballpark. We have a diagram in the measuring guide to show you where to measure, and once you measure and use the calculator you can post your results here in this post so we can double check that everything seems good. It seems that the closest Bravissimo to Birmingham is in Solihull (though I have no idea how close it is to your actual location). About a thirty-minute drive.    Pregnancy has its own idiosyncrasies of fitting because of the way your body is changing. For example, the bras you buy should be snug on the tightest hook rather than the loosest as your ribcage is most likely going to expand in the next 17 weeks. You can wear wireless or underwired bras depending on your preference, but if you choose underwire you should double and triple-check that the underwire is not sitting on top of breast tissue at all."

The straps are woven/textured rather than super smooth, so I haven't had any problems with the straps loosening themselves. It typically retails for $60 but right now it's $40ish on US Amazon (not Prime eligible, unfortunately).   Just to double check, could you measure yourself and post the 5 measurements here? Straps that loosen themselves or chafe your shoulders can be signs of a bra that doesn't fit as well as you'd like. The straps shouldn't have to pull up your boobs all by themselves - it's mostly the band's job! Straps should only contribute to lifting about 20% of the weight. You may find that a different size would prevent the straps loosening or chafing, and that's what the measurements will help you figure out."

Also, I prefer not to wear one at home. I know I'm not the norm, but at 36HH, I've never experienced any back pain (or any pain at all) as a result of my boobs. I'm fine with not wearing them around the house or while sleeping. I'm much more comfy without one.

Right now I sleep braless but I'm looking for a wireless sleep/lounge bra, as I do miss the side support at night.

ABraThatFits,3c760b,lcl0706,2,Sun Jul 5 22:09:38 2015 UTC,"I leave mine on all day but don't sleep in one, although I probably would if I could find the magical soft bralette that keeps my boobs separated.  My problem with lounge shelf-type bras is the complete lack of separation, and I have this major sensory thing against my boobs touching, or sitting on my upper abdomen.  Since they're very projected and not self supporting at all, I can't stand free boobin' it because I don't like them touching me or each other.  I've yet to find a bralette, ahhhhbra, wonderbra, cami, soft cup bra, or whatever that is tight enough around the band (28) and maintains boob separation.  My DREAM bra for around the house would be something snug around my UB, soft, wireless, and yet the center of it still tacks on my chest.  If anyone knows of such a unicorn, please tell me."

ABraThatFits,3c88ma,smickles11,2,Sun Jul 5 20:43:05 2015 UTC,The best way to determine your bra size is to measure yourself. We have instructions on how to do this in the beginner's guide if you're interested.
ABraThatFits,3c88ma,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:30:29 2015 UTC,"The only place I'd trust for a fitting is bravissimo but their bras are quite expensive and sometimes they can have bad fitters. They are having a sale right now so you could tell them you have a tight budget and if nothing in the sale works for you then at least you have an idea of your size. M&S, Debenhams and pretty much every lingerie shop/department are not great for fitting and sometimes they can be quite out, for example my brother's ex was sized as a 32DD at Debenhams but she was probably more of a 28G (or bigger). There are some independent lingerie shops that do fit well but that is hit and miss and also their bras often are pricey. So probably the best thing to do is use this subs Bra size calculator, the information on the side bar will help. If you have a SO or someone close you can ask for help measuring, this is best without a bra on. Once you have an idea of your size then you can go out to try. It's best to try a range of sizes, for example if you came up with 36D then try on the cup sizes around it (C,DD) and if the band doesn't work try a sister size up or down (34DD, 38C) and possibly more sizes around that. Also try a range of styles of bras e.g. plunge and balconnette. You could try a fitting at a department store or a lingerie shop like boux avenue (A lot of people say M&S is the worst) but you'd probably get a better fit by measuring yourself and trying by yourself. Sometimes the assistants are quite good at helping you if you try on some bras and want to confirm if they're a good fit or need some help and there are some good fitters in department/lingerie stores but there are also some bad ones and not the best methods used. If you want local recommendations then if you tell me your nearest city or area I could help, I've moved about the UK a bit.    Everywhere has sales on right now so this is a perfect time for cheap new bras :)"

I've bought 4 or 5 bras from them and their returns policy in the UK is good too if you need to send any back.
ABraThatFits,3c88ma,sympathyboner,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:46:21 2015 UTC,"Just do it yourself using the guide & calculator in the sidebar :) The calculator will give you a great starting point, so make a note of that and then head off to a store to try that size & adjust from there (try a band size up/down, cup size up/down, etc).   Bravissimo is the only store where you have a really good chance of getting a good fitter.  Apart from Bravissimo, some good shops to look at for bras (but not get fitted at) are Debenhams, Boux Avenue, M&S (they miss out FF, so their G is the same as FF everywhere else), possibly John Lewis. Depending on what size you measure as, you may well find some cheap bargains at Matalan, Asda or Tesco, too."

There's a reason why ""most women don't wear the right size"" and that's because shops refuse to stock and/or fit people into the right sizes as it costs more money."
ABraThatFits,3c6aif,killertofuuuuu,19,Sun Jul 5 06:10:26 2015 UTC,"You can also buy the smaller banded sister size and use an extender to begin with, you should always start on the loosest hook with a new bra, if it's too loose then size down.  But on the flip side, wearing bras overly tight can stretch the bands prematurely, this happens to me as I have a flared ribcage which means bands ride up very easily so I wear mine tighter than most."

ABraThatFits,3c6aif,joanna70,7,Sun Jul 5 11:28:27 2015 UTC,The rule of thumb is not more than one or two sizes.

ABraThatFits,3c6aif,joanna70,5,Wed Jul 8 12:03:22 2015 UTC,"I personally can't imagine that it relates to the size of the bra, rather in how much too loose the bra is for your body, so you want to tighten it so that it fits perfectly on the loosest hook if possible, if that's not doable then on the tightest hook.  The cups will warp if the bands is too tight.  In terms of going up one or two band sizes in theory you can go up as much as you like but scaling means the cup shapes become very different and much less likely to fit.  This is where only going up one sister size is recommended in general."

ABraThatFits,3c6byo,hazarada,9,Sun Jul 5 06:32:29 2015 UTC,"What is the official name of the units such as ""AA"" or ""C"" or whatever?   Cupsize.   Brasizes are made out of two parts, cupsize and bandsize. Both mean nothing without each other. (Think of jeans - you need both inseam size and waist size to find a good jeans.)  Bandsize is the size of her ribcage, how large around xe is. Cupsize indicates the size of the breast in relation to the ribcage. Cupsizes are not static, they are the difference between underbust to bust.   A 36A holds the same volume as a 34B and a 32C.   A 36A is for a woman with a ribcage measuring 36 inches and bust measuring 37 inches.  A 32C is meant for a woman measuring 32 inches underbust and 35 inches bust.   Because the woman with the 32C has a smaller ribcage, her breasts look larger despite being the same size volume-wise."

ABraThatFits,3c6byo,t_maia,11,Sun Jul 5 12:30:01 2015 UTC,"The letter refers to cup size. The number is the band size. You need both to have a bra size. Cup size is not static across band sizes (28D is smaller in both band and cup than 38D, for example). ""Sister sizes"" are different sizes that hold approximately the same breast volume but have different band sizes (28D, 30C, 32B, 34A, 36AA).   Different countries use different progressions with the letters (US goes something like A,B, C, D, DD, DDD, DDDD/G, H, I, J, K; UK goes A, B, C, D, DD, E, F, FF, G, GG, H, HH, J, JJ, K; European sizing is A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K).  Depending on the country, band size can be given in inches (28, 30, 32, 34, etc.), centimeters (60, 65, 70, 75, etc.) or dress size (6, 8, 10, 12, etc.).   Band size should be approximately the same as a person's underbust in inches (regardless of what crazy shenanigans a company recommends when measuring, their 32 band will most likely stretch to 32 inches, 34 band stretches to 34 inches, etc.). Each cup size is a one inch difference between the bust and underbust measurements. 1 inch = A, 2 inches = B, 3 inches = C, 4 inches = D, etc. (34 inch bust - 30 inch underbust = 4 inches = 30D). If you want breast volume in cc, there's this handy chart."
ABraThatFits,3c6byo,LadyBoobsalot,6,Sun Jul 5 07:53:34 2015 UTC,"Most bra sizing systems have two parts to the size: a number, called the band size, which refers to the length of the band of the bra, and a letter, called the cup size, which refers to the size of the cups of the bra (see this diagram for what part of the bra is the band and what part of the bra is the cups). So in the bra size 34C, 34 is the band size and C is the cup size.   Just like shoes, there are different sizing systems for different countries and regions for bras. Just like shoes, this is just referred to as US sizing, EU or European sizing, UK sizing, etc.   Cup size is a ratio. A 36C bra does not have the same volume cups as a 34C bra, even though they are both C cups. The cup size is calculated by the difference between the bust measurement and the underbust measurement, as shown in this diagram. In US sizing, each inch of difference corresponds to a cup size. AA is >1 inches of difference, A is 1 inch, B is 2 inches, and so on.   Because bras can come in all sorts of shapes and breasts come in all sorts of shapes, the exact dimensions of a bra's cups are going to differ from bra to bra, even if the bras are the same size. We have an entire website, bratabase.com, where people measure their bras and post the measurements because of this. Check out this comparison of measurements between two bras of the same size.  Hope this helps!"

I think this is because I has one side much smaller than the other so it skews my measurements. The smaller one is about 2 cups sizes smaller. I know you always fit the bigger breast. My underbust is actually 35 inches so I would prefer to go down to a 34 rather then up to a 36 as the bra won't last very long. (I have been wearing a 32 as it is).

Once you start trying on bras, you can test whether 34 bands or 36 bands are more comfortable for you by trying on the bras upside-down and backwards (sometimes if the cup is the wrong size it can make the band feel too tight or too loose even if it's the right size, so wearing the bra like this makes sure you're only testing the band).   I would suggest starting with any plunge bras you can find in 36FF, 34G, and 34H. Depending on the shape of your breasts, most plunges might be low enough to not sit on your breast tissue once you're in the proper size. If they're not low enough, then at least  you'll have a reference point and know how high of a gore is too high. Then you can go on Bratabase and search for bras with lower gores."

ABraThatFits,3c5r88,noys,2,Sun Jul 5 21:02:14 2015 UTC,"The one I ordered: Biustonosz S SzykuÅ  Despite everyone's recommendation on this sub I DID use Ewa's size calculator. I ordered an 80G (36G UK). The band is probably one size too large, but I emailed and was told that this style runs a little stretchier. If I were to re-order this style after this one dies, I would go a sister size down. The bra fits perfectly aside from the slightly too large band.  I have not tried Comexim personally, so I can't give you any info on that. Also I ordered my bra in the middle of a snowstorm when there were the really awful blizzards up in the north east, so EVERYTHING in customs was held up for ages. I got my bra 2 months after I ordered it and the box was delivered soaking wet and crushed, along with a note from USPS that basically said ""Sorry we fucked up your package. Sucks to be you."" Luckily Ewa packages their bras wrapped in plastic, so the bra was completely unharmed!  I popped that baby on and holy projection I thought I could put an eye out. The shape took some time to adjust to because I was so used to wearing ill fitting bras and was not used to my boobs being so out there and it made me a bit self conscious. But now I've taken on the mentality of ""I have boobs, they're pretty big, it's no secret. Deal with it."" so I embrace my super projected bust. The bras have a nice round shape, not pointy at all, but they also do not mush your boobs against your chest at all, they let the tissue project away from your chest like boobs are meant to do, so it can be quite a shock if you're used to the mushed boob look like I was. Plus all of their padded bras come with removable pads. I took the left one out and kept one in on my right boob which is my smaller boob and now they look like twinsies."

ABraThatFits,3c5r7n,ABTFthrowaway999,2,Sun Jul 5 02:00:47 2015 UTC,"Another clue to shape - lean forwards 90 degrees and see where your nipples point (side on to a mirror if possible).  FOB would point towards your chin, even shaped would be straight down and FOT is towards your knees.  Gapping at the top can happen if a bra is too shallow, too tall as well as too FOT.  Yes 34DD/E is a good starting point, and you are in the matrix so it may be worth trying regular store bras.  Otherwise the larger cup makers offer bras of reasonably well known shape etc which can help with fitting - for example there are basic ""diagnostic"" bras like Cleo Lucy for FOB shapes (Cleo Marcie for FOT, Cleo Juna or a Freya half cup for shallow)."

That is much more dependent on genetics, pregnancies, breast feeding, etc. If you aren't comfortable then by all means you should find something that fits better, but if you worry about it causing sagging you're really worrying about the wrong thing.

I already tried on bras tha fit at vs but was looking for more options.  I almost dont want to know if I am lower than a 32 band size because then I will have to order online - I'm a student and I dont have money or time for that unfortunately.

I'd say be open minded for now, there are way fewer non-wired options so you are limiting your choices.  I almost swore off wires (30F at the time, wore terrible shelf camis all winter and ill fitting wired bras and pull on Aah bra type things in the ummer) until I got into my correct size and shape."

I have ocd and it makes my mind wonder - am I really being supported? will I have prematuer sagging if my bra isn't perfect? it just drive me up the wall.    There are wireless bras at victoria secret for around 54$CAD and I wonder if I should just guy two of those if I cant' stand the wired bras?   Or should I tell my mind to jus shut up when it feels dicomfort and buy cheaper wired bras so that I can have more bras?    I just feel like 'what's wrong wiht me'?! most women have uncomfyu, ill fitting bras and they get though the day jus fine - they learn to tolerat the discomfort.  Why cant I?  I need a new bra right now - so if I try on a bunch of 30 c bras with wires in the mall and cant find one with a wire that sits on the IM fold, then should I buy them anyway, or buy the one wire free bra that exists in the entire mall at VS?"

ABraThatFits,3c5rqo,gianttribble,16,Sun Jul 5 02:07:32 2015 UTC,"Bras don't really prevent sagging - the factors that make pendulousness occur in the first place are mostly genetic, as people of all ages can have pendulous breasts.   But wearing bras using the size given to me by the ABTF method have generally improved the shape of my breasts. They used to be flattened, in a way, with a lot more tissue near my armpits than the center of my chest. This was most likely caused by years of wearing bras with cups that were too narrow and not deep enough for me (they were four cup volumes too small). Now after almost 8 months of wearing well-fitting bras, I have noticed that my breasts have become slightly narrower and more projected, as well as slightly more conical. The tissue that was all next to my armpits has balanced itself out, becoming more evenly distributed from sternum to armpit.   Not to mention that the bras I have now are sooooooo much more comfortable. Sometimes I forget I'm wearing a bra!"

I never had the happy perky boobs that are held up as the ideal in media.   Now that I'm nearly 30, yeah, they hang. But now I know why. Part of it is due to the shape of my breasts, part of it is because I'm simply genetically inclined towards that happening. And now that I have bras that actually fit me, and can lift my boobs up and hold them and support them and frankly make my chest look goddamn amazing, I don't care. They're gonna do their thing no matter what, but they look damn good anyway.  And realistically, your breasts are only one part of you.

I was wearing 32A before, and the depth of those cups was definitely not enough for my boobs! My boobs are splayed, so instead of spilling over into the center and creating cleavage, my breast tissue got stuck on the sides. I've noticed the most difference in the sternum-to-armpit distribution, because I used to be unable to fill the part of the cup closest to the gore on my favorite bra. Now it's filled to the brim, and I overflow a tiny bit on bras that have less space there. All of the other characteristics that have shifted are so slight that I doubt I or anyone else would have noticed without paying lots of attention."

It works because my waist is a good deal smaller than my underbust, so I'm barely stretching the band to get it hooked. And for S&S, it's not too hard to use one hand for both sides. She may want to try using a plastic spoon or spatula at first to get better leverage on that side."
ABraThatFits,3c3vk5,crazymusicalgenius96,8,Sat Jul 4 17:30:33 2015 UTC,"I have limited sensation in my hand on one side and this is what I do, because sometimes I can't reach around AND grasp. Front-clasp bras are also a big help because they allow you to use your elbow to hold the bra against your body, so you can clasp with the other hand.  As for the bra straps maybe slipping down, you can buy bra strap grips/pads. I like to get them at Joanns/Michaels, because they have a whole section of ""bra solutions"". Also look out for bras that have no-slide straps, meaning the inside of the strap has a little rubber line."
ABraThatFits,3c3vk5,mannequinbutt,3,Sat Jul 4 18:36:12 2015 UTC,I've never had problems with straps slipping down in my well-fitting bras. The only thing is I have to completely remove the bra to adjust them (because my arm can't bend quite far enough to reach the clasps unless I've had to adjust them to be pretty short).
ABraThatFits,3c3vk5,crazymusicalgenius96,10,Sun Jul 5 02:29:11 2015 UTC,"I broke my shoulder in February and still don't have enough mobility to put my bra on. I simply put it on backwards and then twist it around. I do the scoop and swoop with my good arm/hand on both sides. Just be careful when you twist it around that you don't pull on it too much or you will stretch out the band and get less life out of the bra.   I'm a 34G and I've not had any luck with front clasp bras, but it may be a problem of shape. The front clasp bras tend to not have enough cup coverage on the inside of my boobs if that makes sense."

For putting on the bra, she could put it on hooks in the front. Pin down the one side with her arm, hook the hooks, then twist them to the back? It would be a little more difficult to maneuver, but it's an option.   For s&s, it's possible to do with one hand on both sides. I do it at work. It would just take her getting used to doing the side that's the same side as the arm she has full mobility in.   The biggest issue I see is she will have a lot of difficulty if the band is too tight, so finding the right fit band will be very important.   I hope this helps her!"

The method you described is pretty much what I ended up doing. It was pretty awkward, but you've got to do what you've got to do. I'm sure with time a person would become pretty good at it.  Another option I tried at first was to hook the bra before putting it on, and then shimmying it down over my head. You end up smooshing your boobs pretty good before you get it down where it needs to be though.

ABraThatFits,3c3vk5,Moonforehead,0,Sun Jul 5 21:03:13 2015 UTC,"Closing the hooks in the front and twisting around is really bad for the bra though, and would be near impossible if the band is as snug as it should be"
ABraThatFits,3c3vk5,tiggaren,14,Sat Jul 4 17:47:51 2015 UTC,"I disagree with that. The amount of stretching really shouldn't be any more than the stretching one has to do to fasten a band in back. Either way, you have to stretch the band. So long as you're careful, twisting the bra around shouldn't do any damage either. I've done it this way for 45 years--all my bra-wearing life--and have never damaged a bra yet, including my extra-snug band Panache Sport. It's moot anyways because even though I have no mobility issues, I am physically not able to put a bra on any other way. It's either do it up in front and twist around, or not wear one at all."
ABraThatFits,3c3vk5,Goddess_Keira,12,Sat Jul 4 20:25:35 2015 UTC,"It's not ideal, but it was a suggestion. It will lessen the life of the bra, but it's a way to have her wear a bra with no assistance."
ABraThatFits,3c3vk5,Moonforehead,7,Sat Jul 4 18:22:44 2015 UTC,That really depends on the size ratio of your underbust to your waist. If you have a small waist it doesn't stretch the bra at all.
ABraThatFits,3c3vk5,MutantToenail,2,Sun Jul 5 00:22:34 2015 UTC,"I have a shoulder injury at the moment and so am having to do this, I simply suck in my stomach, spin the bra round as carefully as I can without pulling on it.  Some of us have no choice."
ABraThatFits,3c3vk5,joanna70,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:46:20 2015 UTC,Pretty much. My waist is just barely larger around than the unstretched length of the bands on my bras. (I will say it is harder to twist a well-fitting bra around but I think that's mostly because of how long the underwires are.)

Can you give an idea of your shape and your 5 measurements according to the beginners guide? Is hard to give a good recommendation without knowing your shape.

ABraThatFits,3c4lc7,goodoldfreda,5,Sun Jul 5 00:23:45 2015 UTC,"I'm getting a 34F from those measurements, though 34E is also possible. What I think you're experiencing now is the orange-in-a-glass effect, where the cup isn't wide enough, so your boobs can't get into the cup, making it gap. Alternatively 34DD/E is your best size, and the bra is too shallow as plutonium said."
ABraThatFits,3c4lc7,hurrrrrmione,4,Sun Jul 5 00:37:22 2015 UTC,"I agree that 34F is the best place to start, but that 34E is also possible. 34DD should be too small.  /u/RedAngel728, this is using UK sizing.

For fullness, when I stand at a 90 degree my nipples is dead center staring at the floor but when I cup them with my hands I can feel I'm bottom heavy. Not sure if those contradict of if they both mean bottom heavy.   I think I have a narrow root but not to an extreme. My upper breast tissue stops just before my armpits but my lower breast tissue spreads out into my armpit area (but not by much).  I think my boobs are neither shallow nor very projected. Think being the key word. I don't believe they are shallow but then again the guide is confusing."
ABraThatFits,3c4lc7,CherryAmesAgain,2,Sun Jul 5 14:58:21 2015 UTC,"It sounds like either your bras have wires that are too narrow for you, or they don't have enough immediate projection for you. Check out the shape guide in the sidebar and we will try to help!"

ABraThatFits,3c4lc7,CherryAmesAgain,6,Sun Jul 5 00:24:02 2015 UTC,"Can you let us know which parts you found confusing? We are currently trying to improve it so it's not so overwhelming for new people, so any feedback would be great. I know, it's a lot of information.  To figure out if you're full on top or full on bottom-- look at your boobs in a bra. Is the nipple on top of your boob? Then you're full on bottom. Is the nipple lower down on your boob? You are full on top. If your nipple is in the middle, you're even.  Shallow vs. projected-- imagine a bowl that holds 10 oz. of liquid and a soup plate that holds 10 oz. of liquid. They hold the same volume, but are distributed differently. So a projected person has boobs that stick out farther and needs a bra with cups that are more like bowls, and a shallow person has boobs that cover a larger area of their chest and needs bras with cups that are more like soup plates.  Wide vs. Narrow-- this is just about how far under your armpit your breast tissue goes. Mine stops in front of my armpits and I am pretty narrow. Some people have breast tissue that goes much farther back and they have wide roots."
ABraThatFits,3c4lc7,rado999,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:25:35 2015 UTC,"I wanted to wait and answer this when I was on my computer and could really look at things better.   I think first off, why do I need to know my shape? How is that helpful? It doesn't really say why in the shape guide page.   Are shallow boobs generally positioned closer to your body while projected stands out more? That's how I'm interpreting that but I have larger boobs so of course mine stand out. Or is it that the tips of your boobs seem to come to a peak?   Okay, the visual shape guide for fullness of your boobs means nothing to me. I honestly have zero idea what you are trying to convey with that photo. What part is supposed to be my boobs in that? The grey round part of the red and blue parts. Not that I could make sense of it either way. The article from ""Bras I hate and Love"" helps a bit more but as a newbie still confuses me.   If I had to guess my fullness, when I bend at a 90 degree angle to let the ladies hang it seems as though my nipple lands dead center, staring at the floor. Does that mean an even fullness? But when I stand with them normal they seem bottom heavy to me. When cupped they seem bottom heavy as well.   If I had to guess I'd say my boobs are of average projection possible more projected than average, but not much I don't think.   Wide vs narrow.. I think I'd be more narrow. Looking at some of those photos it seems at though my upper breast stops before my armpit (but a tiny bit) but my lower tissue goes a bit wider beyond my armpit, but I don't think that matters. Right?   Okay I hope that helped explain some confusion I'm having and maybe could help you help me a bit better?"
ABraThatFits,3c4lc7,MutantToenail,3,Sun Jul 5 14:54:50 2015 UTC,"Shape is important because if your bra is the wrong shape, it won't fit you. Did my analogy about the soup plates and the deep bowls help explain shallow vs. projected? Or you can think of it as a shot glass vs. a saucer. They hold the same amount of liquid, but they have different footprints on the table. Likewise do shallow/projected breasts have different footprints on the chest. Shallow boobs don't stick out as far and carry a larger area of the chest. Projected boobs take up a smaller area of your chest and stick out farther.  From how you are describing your breasts I think you may have a similar shape as me-- projected on bottom, with shallow tissue covering the upper part of my chest. How far up your chest does your breast tissue go? Does it reach your collarbone? Lots of people think that this shape doesn't exist, but those of us who have it know it does. It's a controversial part of boob science right now. In general I look for full-on-bottom bras that are a little more open on top than normal.  It sounds like your roots are of average width.  The best way to determine your shape is just to try on some bras and see what works. We generally recommend the Cleo Lucy and Marcie to start. Once you find one bra that fits, it's a lot easier to find many more. It took me 20 bras to find one that fit me, but within a couple of months I had 15 more.  Fullness guide-- the red and blue parts represent the boobs. It says on the left that the red represents variation in shape of the top of the breast and the blue represents variations in the bottom of the breast. Together, the red and blue for a breast that has both a top and bottom-- that is, a complete breast. The gray circle is there to give an indication of size and position."
ABraThatFits,3c4lc7,syrashiraz,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:34:25 2015 UTC,"After rereading your analogy a few times about projection and shallow it made more sense! I do have more projected breasts, definitely bowls over plates.   When I want to check how far my breast tissue goes up is it just when that are hanging free? If so, it seems as though my breasts start 6 closed fingers down from my collarbone."
ABraThatFits,3c4lc7,syrashiraz,2,Sun Jul 5 17:52:25 2015 UTC,"OK, so scratch my idea about the shallow/projected combo. Sounds like you are regular plain old projected and even to FOB (full on bottom). I can't personally help you because I am in a way different size range, but I'm sure someone will chime in with some suggestions."
ABraThatFits,3c38ee,bigbra,9,Sat Jul 4 09:32:04 2015 UTC,Looks like you're wearing it on the tightest hooks - you should wear new bras on the loosest hooks unless you're pregnant.
ABraThatFits,3c38ee,goodoldfreda,6,Sat Jul 4 13:41:58 2015 UTC,"Sculptresse runs tight in the band. The newer Sculptresse bras also run small in the cup. Many people have to size up in newer Sculptresse bras.   The ChiChi looks good, the fit is not too bad. It confirms that your size is around 40FF/42FF. But of course, if it is painful it is a no-go.   Part of the reason the band might dig into your stomach so much is that the ChiChi has similar fit issues as the PourMoi? Imogen Rose. No surprise, since they are made for a similar shape. Narrow, tall and with more volume on top than on bottom. You seem to have the opposite shape, needing more volume in the bottom. As a result your breasts wiggle up into a higher part of the cup to get more room, which pushes the cup down and the wires into your ribs, resulting in pain."
ABraThatFits,3c38ee,t_maia,2,Sat Jul 4 10:22:29 2015 UTC,"I wear a 38G in Chi Chi but a 36G in Elomi Jocelyn which is the same cut as Betty (I also have Betty in 38FF but need to fasten it on the middle hooks). I suspect that you will find the 40FF Betty to be a good fit. If it is, you might like to know that the Jocelyn is made from a fabric with a more silky feel where Betty is a mesh. I think Elomi is definitely going to be the better brand for you."
ABraThatFits,3c38ee,EmmaInFrance,2,Sat Jul 4 10:58:30 2015 UTC,"Both styles look to me to have continuous bands rather than being bandless.  On paper 42FF/40G is your smallest possible cup volume though of course it will depend on style, but too small a cup will make the band feel tight."
ABraThatFits,3c2wst,porktatonado,4,Sat Jul 4 06:38:40 2015 UTC,"Start with 34DD. 34E is for a 40"" bust, so that'll likely be too big (34DD is for a 39"" bust, so your leaning measurement of 39.25"" is why the calculator is saying both 34DD and 34E may work).   This is only one cup size larger than your current bras via sister sizing - 38B, 36C, and 34D all have approximately the same volume cups.   What shape do you think your breasts are?"
ABraThatFits,3c2wst,hurrrrrmione,2,Sat Jul 4 07:14:40 2015 UTC,Holy cow!! That spectrum chart is amazing! I'm pretty sure I'm projected.  Edit: Also maybe full on top? I'm not as sure about fullness.
ABraThatFits,3c2wst,hurrrrrmione,2,Sat Jul 4 07:37:18 2015 UTC,"Fullness can be hard to tell. A good way to try and determine it is to lean over at a 90Â° angle while topless in front of a mirror. If your nipples are closer to your head, you're full-on-bottom. If they are closer to your feet, you're full-on-top. If they point straight down/seem to be in the middle of your breast, that's even fullness."

It may just be that you'd prefer a 30 band, which is certainly possible with your underbust measurements.  I agree with the calculator that 32F is where you should start (or 30FF if you want to try 30 bands).   Could you describe the fit of your 32DDs more? Where are you not filling out the cup?

Those ones are from LaSenza, different versions of the So Free lightly lined ones. I also have a strapless from Victoria's secret in 32DD which is actually pretty tight in the band but cuts in at the top and wrinkles at the bottom. And I have an Aerie Sunnie in 32D which has a little bit of quadboob but not extreme.  As far as other 32DDs I have tried on but didn't buy, I've had a variety of issues. Most frequently gaping at the top, but also some that were too projected and narrow, or too projected and cutting in at the top, though the last case is probably the least frequent. I couldn't tell you what most of these were, just bras I tried on at Winners, LaSenza and Pink mostly."

These are called sister sizes.  That will be easy to find.  Many of the full bust brands we recomment here have a plethora of bras that fit that bill! If you are wanting some light padding, look at Freya padded halfcups.  Other popular full bust brands to look for are Cleo by Panache, Panache, Curvy Kate, and so on--but Freya really has a wide selection of padded halfcups (I think it may be one of their specialties or something?

I will say it does tend to pick up a fair bit of lint and whatever else is flying about (dog hair for me)... but nothing that can't be fixed with a good wash.  Just a heads up If you do end up ordering from Etsy, the seller has special support straps (wider) for larger sized cups...  I personally find them more annoying than anything as it makes it impossible to tighten them well enough (so be sure to ask for the fully extendable straps shown in the listing picture if you like your straps on the tighter side!)

And they're great in the winter because you're wearing a sweater anyway. I agree that you might like Freya halfcups, but check about your shape first. Don't forget to go with 28Es to start!

ABraThatFits,3c2byb,MichelleyMarie,5,Sat Jul 4 02:47:48 2015 UTC,"Where are you located? Unless you're in Poland, I'd probably avoid ordering an Ewa bra until you're more sure what size you need exactly because of the cost and the potential difficulty with returns.  Also, how do your current 40DD bras fit you? If the band feels right, then stick with a 40; if the band feels loose or rides up, you could definitely consider going down to a 38. Bras above a 36 band are often stretchier and going below the snug measurement seems to be more common. Also, a lot more bras are available in a 38 band than in a 40, so that might make it easier for you to find bras that work.  If you try scooping and swooping in the 40DD, do you get overflow? /u/t_maia has an alternative way of estimating bra size for larger band sizes that involves using the +5 method and then sister-sizing back down to the correct band size. Using that method gives me a 38F-FF/40E-F. If your current bras are only a little small in the cups, you could try those sizes, too.  If you look on the sidebar, there are a few links about shape and projection. Posting that information will give us a better idea of what to suggest, particularly projection and fullness. Moulded/padded cups can be a difficult fit for projected breasts, though, so if you are projected, you may have a tough time finding a good bra in the style you prefer."

ABraThatFits,3c2byb,hurrrrrmione,3,Sat Jul 4 03:49:55 2015 UTC,I would recommend taking another set of measurements when you're full just in case there's a size difference.

That would give you a lot more options like panache, cleo, freya, elomi, chantelle, and possibly goddess. It depends on your shape, projection, roots, what bra brand and model would best fit you."
ABraThatFits,3c2byb,t_maia,3,Sat Jul 4 05:35:43 2015 UTC,"Also wanted to add that my boobs are kind of far apart if that matters.   How far apart? Ewa Michalak bras are meant for breasts that are very close together and have narrow roots.   I agree with aethologist that I would not buy bras from Poland at this stage.   You first need to try on some bras and find your size. Then get a handle on your shape. If you need wide wires and are in a nursing bra with narrow wires this can lead to mastitis. Not fun.    I like it to be a moulded cup with comfortable straps and a slight amount of padding    Is the reason you want that because you associate moulded foam with support? Many women do this because when they wore the wrong size only those padded foam domes gave any support.   But in the correct size and shape for your breasts thin lacy bras are actually more supportive that those foam domes.   Foam domes also hide fitting issues, so this is another reason to stay away from them if you want to find a bra that really fits. Once you know what works for you, go for them, but not initially.   That said, there are some moulded nursing bras out there that are very supportive.   One of the best nursing bras in your size range is the Elomi Smoothing Nursing 3912.  Note that this bra handles far apart breasts far better than the Ewa Michalak bras, the gore is about an inch wide.   Other options are the Freya Pure, the Anita nursing bras (note that Anita uses US sizing, their 38H is a UK 38FF), Bravado Bliss.   You can also use regular bras that easily convert to nursing bras. I would highly recommend trying Panache Andorra, it fits a lot of women really well, is very supportive and true to size. Trying it in a variety of sizes will allow you to find your size. Alternatives to Panache Andorra are Panache Envy, Panache Jasmine and Panache Sculptresse ChiChi. They are based upon the same cut, but fit slightly different.  Another set of bras that converts really well are the Elomi plunges with the flexible lace, Elomi Valentina/Jocelyn/Lexi.   Size-wise I am getting 38FF/G/GG as potential sizes with UK 38G /US 38i being most likely from your measurements. If in doubt buy the larger size, it is completely normal to swell up around one cupsize especially overnight."

I would suggest trying 38G, 38GG and 40FF, 40G as a starting point. In Elomi, I suspect that trying 36 and 38 bands would be better.

ABraThatFits,3c1p8j,syrashiraz,2,Sat Jul 4 03:12:54 2015 UTC,"Okay, my thought was maybe it was uncomfortable because it was pressure in a smaller area as opposed to a larger area. So maybe up a band size? I know I've read some people just have difficulties with gore pain, but I'm hoping that maybe up a band size will help alleviate that.   Personally I've found the extremely long gores to be the most comfortable for me, but I don't get pain from them. It would be nice if a layer of padding fabric was an option for behind gores. A fantasie bra I tried on yesterday had a padded hook closure so it didn't dig into your back (I guess?) so that would be a nice option to have that for the gore for women who have problems with the pressure against their chest."

Since there are many women with a shallow shape in this size range, I would recommend Cleo Lucy, Cleo Marcie and Freya Padded Halfcups because they work for both shallow and average projection in this size range.

ABraThatFits,3c0juv,j_sunrise,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:53:26 2015 UTC,"I do believe it might be a tiny bit small on the left side.  But I think that a cup up would be too big, especially on the right side.    I find the gore on this one super comfy and think I may prefer the lower gore.  My other bras have higher gores and I find as the day progress I feel them more and it can get annoying."
ABraThatFits,3c0juv,t_maia,2,Sun Jul 5 13:16:53 2015 UTC,"The bra gives you plunge-related quadboob. It expects less volume near the gore than you have.   I've seen this happen before with Panache Plunges and one potential fix to this is a racerback converter. With the straps positioned differently this opens up the cups near the gore, allowing more volume there."
ABraThatFits,3c0tlc,petrakay,7,Fri Jul 3 18:57:25 2015 UTC,"Aerie's bralettes don't come in bra sizes - just XS through XL. We've found that ladies who wear 32E are comfy in the large and could potentially wear the medium (though it's a little tight). So you might want to try the bralettes in large and XL and see what you think!  Another alternative would be longlines, which can look similar to bralettes in style but have underwires and seamed cups. Freya makes lots of longlines, and several of them have lacy bands like the bralettes (the cups and straps are usually some sort of floral pattern). Freya Flourish, Pansy, and Parade would probably be closest to what you're looking for. In fact, there's a $21 NWOT 32FF Freya Flourish on Ebay right now if you decide you like the way it looks."

I imagine it's used in most second-hand selling situations. Usually a new without tags bra is a bra that the owner never wore (except possibly a short try on) but took the tags off so it couldn't be returned."

ABraThatFits,3c0tlc,2btf,3,Fri Jul 3 21:02:26 2015 UTC,"They can be sometimes be pricey, but I think Mimi Holiday has some actual cup-sized bras that sort of look like that Free People bralette you linked to: one possible example and another  edited for grammar"
ABraThatFits,3c0tlc,syrashiraz,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:52:45 2015 UTC,I wonder if you could wear a regular bra with an XL bralette over it. That's something I've thought of trying myself. I just don't like the squished to the sides look bralette give me. Free people bralettes are the cutest things ever.
ABraThatFits,3c0tlc,MutantToenail,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:46:41 2015 UTC,That's what I do. I have some cheapo bandeau bras that I wear over my bra in place of a camisole. It's too hot down here for all those layers.
ABraThatFits,3c0tlc,cleverdistraction,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:57:41 2015 UTC,"I've seen lots of cute lacey bralettes at Nordstrom Rack, just FYI, but they also were in S-XL type sizes. I second what /u/syrashiraz said about perhaps wearing a bralette over a similarly colored bra or something?"
ABraThatFits,3c01lc,mick_mouse,7,Fri Jul 3 15:22:04 2015 UTC,"It's not what the measurements say, but looking at those fits it seems like you're a 38F to 38FF. You look to have a projected shape. I think there might be a bit of a problem getting the very round look you want in a bra that gives you enough projection, though. The City Chic bra actually seems like it's about right for cup size generally. The gapping is probably typical molded-cup gapping when you move. The main problem, I think, is shape mismatch. It's not projected enough, so it doesn't tack on you. I doubt there's a size in that bra that will fit you better, unfortunately.  You might re-try the Elomi Bijou in a smaller size, since you liked the bra. I'm thinking 38F, though it might not be projected enough. The Fantasie 4520 also might work for you in 38F or FF. I'd also like to see you in some unlined Elomis. The Betty plunge, or Tessa is a very pretty bra that might work for you, and probably 38F for size but you might want to order some things in both 38F and 38FF to compare. I'd also like to see how a Panache Jasmine fits you in 38F/FF."
ABraThatFits,3c01lc,Goddess_Keira,2,Fri Jul 3 16:12:24 2015 UTC,"See, this is why I come to y'all - the projection / shape issue is really helpful and something I wouldn't have come to on my own. I don't know if it's right to say I'm looking forward to the next batch of ones to try, but I feel more confident in types to choose. Thank you!"
ABraThatFits,3c01lc,EmmaInFrance,3,Fri Jul 3 16:18:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think the 4529 is necessarily too small for you, I think that it's more a case of being the wrong style/shape.  In general, moulded bras are harder to get a good fit in and gaping at the top of the cups is a common problem.   With regards to the Elomi bras, if you still have the bras, try them both on with the cups at the back to get an idea of how the band size actually fits without the fit of the cups getting in the way. I wear a 36 band in Elomi with a snug of 39ish and a tight of 37 and that's very comfortable. I do have more squish than you though.  I wonder if a plunge like Elomi Betty or Jocelyn might work better for you? Also some of the Sculptresse balconettes might be worth a try?"
ABraThatFits,3c01lc,t_maia,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:42:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! I do still have the Elomi bras, so I'll try your suggestion to get a better idea of fit.  I'll have to try out some of the ones you recommended. I appreciate it!"
ABraThatFits,3c0xr7,bigbra,2,Fri Jul 3 19:29:09 2015 UTC,"In appearance, the 40FF does look like a good fit on you. The calculator overestimated your cup size, as is common in your size range. It's pretty impressive that you found something to fit that well visually on a first try! However, the fact that it's so uncomfortable makes it a no-go.  I would suggest the Elomi Etta style to you. I'd say try it in 40FF and 42F, which is your sister-size up. (not 42FF, as that will be too big in the cup.) Over time, you might be able to tolerate a 40 band, but if you need to start out with a larger band size for comfort, then you go down one cup size to maintain the same volume--that's how I get 42F as the sister-size to 40FF."
ABraThatFits,3c0xr7,Goddess_Keira,2,Fri Jul 3 19:52:44 2015 UTC,"Actually, the 42FF looks closer to fitting you. The gaping you're getting seems like a shape issue more than anything, as the cups aren't quite closed on top enough for you. The gore is much closer to tacking, and this amount of tack may be optimal for you as your breasts seem to be very close-set and the gore would be sitting on breast tissue if it were actually touching your sternum. Also, firmly tacking gores can be quite painful to many people even without chronic pain, so I wouldn't want it to aggravate your fibromyalgia.  The 40FF has less gaping because the cups are shorter, but the gore is pretty far away from your sternum and it felt uncomfortably tight. Both of these are signs of cups being too small! If you haven't packaged these up to ship them back yet, try on the 40FF backwards to see if it still feels too tight. If it does, then both band and cup were too small. If it feels better with the cups on your back, then the cups were contributing to the too-tight feeling you had.   Recommendations: I would suggest trying Elomi Caitlyn and possibly Elomi Rita as well. I think 42FF would be fine, possibly 40G as Elomi bands are stretchier. However, I have no idea if this PourMoi? bra runs true-to-size, so hopefully someone else who's tried this bra can clear that up."
ABraThatFits,3c0xr7,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Fri Jul 3 20:02:16 2015 UTC,"Second the rec for Elomi.   This bra has a shape 4 in the bottom and you need a shape 5-6.   http://i.imgur.com/VPH5K0E.png  If you like the colours of the Imogen Rose, check out the Elomi Valentina in Sea Breeze. It is from a few seasons back, but with a bit of luck and patience you might still find it in your size."
ABraThatFits,3c0xr7,t_maia,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:13:32 2015 UTC,I also recommend Elomi - they are so much more comfortable than other brands. If it weren't for the fibro I'd say that you would be fine with a 38 band in Elomi but I think that you would prefer a 40 band.
ABraThatFits,3c0nur,Shanakitty,2,Fri Jul 3 18:13:13 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, even if the company would do it I'd foresee a lot of scaling problems. The cups would have to get quite tall, I believe, in order to contain you and I'd definitely be fearful that the cups could not be made projected enough without collapsing. Surely the wires would have to be wider, which you don't need. Add to that the structural difficulties created by moving the straps in, and unfortunately I can't see it being feasible."
ABraThatFits,3c0nur,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:58:31 2015 UTC,"This is my fear as well. I wouldn't mind the cups being a bit taller, but I'm concerned that the bra is just too shallow, and will end up too wide if I go up 2-3 cup sizes. And the gore still may not tack, leading to gaping, like I get in the Audrey. Oh well."
ABraThatFits,3c0nur,ariawhatever,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:53:16 2015 UTC,"You seem to really be busting out. Maybe a 70O or P might be a better fit as the t-shirt bras I heard tend to run a bit small. The gore may tack better if your boobs aren't quad boobing in it. I don't know a whole lot about Comexim/Wellfitting because I haven't ordered from there. They seem to run a size or two small. I realize you are projected, so maybe that or the size of your boobs affects the bra."
ABraThatFits,3c0nur,khasiv,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:20:14 2015 UTC,"I think these longline styles are really just too shallow in construction to work in the larger sizes. Even in my size range the longlines they are making really seem to come with floating wires, non-tacking gores, and shallow cups. I had a 60F that fit way too shallowly for me (at least a size small), when it really shouldn't have been too far off."

I wish I'd found here much earlier than I did."
ABraThatFits,3bzl3k,brafittingaccount,5,Fri Jul 3 12:48:58 2015 UTC,"I disagree, bullet boobs can be a result of the shape of your boob & the cup. I think 30FF is a good size for you. Panache is known for using extremely firm wires, causing an uncomfortable tack on some people.   You most definitely are projected & need the immediate projection, but I agree the Envy & Jasmine are too wide. Reeeeally wish you could track down a CK Bardot. If I didn't love mine so much I'd send it to you!! You look to need narrow wires & immediate projection, but that previous Cleo Lily was too big on top. So it sounds like you have short roots. I still think 30FF is your size, it's down to finding a shape that works for you & has narrow enough wires. A Comexim with a reduced cup could work, but that's going Polish with alterations. Ya know, browse around r/braswap & see if you can't find a secondhand Comexim in a 65HH. I'd be curious how it fits!  Unlined wise, if Lucy was too wide & baggy on top, I'm kinda drawing a blank. Let me think on it for a bit."

It's sounding like Comexim might be the next step, yikes. I'll start looking around.   Thank you for your help these past few weeks!"

Zathiya carries stock and is a us store so returns are not quite the same hassle. They are narrow, very projected, and have a low gore. The standard cup can be high for some folks, esp in larger cups like me (you may be ok) but if you like them you can order them with all sorts of customizations like lowered cups, raised/lowered gore, straps moved, etc  I agree though, envy looks good. I had to bend gores on several bras (bravissimo being worst offender) when I started out but now they don't bother me. Dunno if better bras or just getting used to it?"
ABraThatFits,3bzl3k,MutantToenail,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:52:48 2015 UTC,"You're the second to suggest Comexim so I suppose that's the next step, even though I was really wary of going the Polish route. I hadn't heard of Zathiya, though. I looked at their site and shipping is free for the first order, so that's promising! I guess I'll have to call them for sizing advice, but it looks like their options for available sizes are (understandably) spotty. Fingers crossed.   Thanks!"
ABraThatFits,3bzl3k,MutantToenail,2,Fri Jul 3 21:36:02 2015 UTC,"Bullet boobs are usually caused by too-small cups. As for the stabby wires, did you bend the wires to be shaped like your ribcage? That Jasmine is not a good fit for you but the Envy doesn't look bad."
ABraThatFits,3bzl3k,t_maia,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:00:22 2015 UTC,"I actually didn't try bending the wires... I didn't realize that worked for the gore. I thought it was just for the sides, but that makes sense. Too late, though, as I sent them back already.  Hm, I though the Jasmine cups seemed to fit pretty well (or were too large on top if anything, i.e., in the angled photos), and there was extra space in the Envy (i.e., in the side photos). But maybe I'm wrong on this..."
ABraThatFits,3bzl3k,noys,3,Fri Jul 3 13:05:45 2015 UTC,"I meant in terms of the general shape. The Jasmine is a weird shape and the Envy is a size or so too large. It seems like you've been striking out with Panache/Cleo. If you wanted to go into Freya territory I think the Naomi cuts (I think the current styles are the Pollyanna and the Fluorish) or the Gem might work for you. We are really close in size and shape and these are the best ones I've found so far. They are both fairly narrow and projected and both have some stretch lace action so are pretty forgiving. You'd want to size down to a 28 band, especially with the Gem."
ABraThatFits,3bzl3k,t_maia,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:13:55 2015 UTC,"Oh, gotcha. Thanks for the recommendations! The Gem looks like it has cups the cover a bit more on top, so it's particularly tempting. If I size down to 28, I should go up to a G cup, right?"
ABraThatFits,3c19oy,MizGinger,2,Fri Jul 3 21:02:48 2015 UTC,Have you tried any strapless bras in this size range before and if so what did or didn't you like about them? What shape are your breasts?
ABraThatFits,3c19oy,hurrrrrmione,2,Fri Jul 3 21:57:44 2015 UTC,"Very round, and full at the top. And I am finally in a proper size (36ff). For years I was squeezing into a 36DD thanks to sales women and my breasts always spilled out the top of every strapless bra I have ever tried. The past few years now I have been buying bras online from brastop in my correct size and I have been very comfortable and happy with them. I have never bought a strapless bra in my correct size because I have never had the occasion to, but now I have a wedding to go to where my shoulders will be bare in the dress, so now I need one.   I figured I would ask if anyone has one similar to my size that has been supportive for them."
ABraThatFits,3c19oy,t_maia,3,Fri Jul 3 22:21:26 2015 UTC,"Very round, and full at the top.   That calls for Curvy Kate. Or is there another brand of bras that you regularly wear that fits you better?   The go-to recommendation for a strapless bra is the Wonderbra Ultimate Strapless, usually followed by the Freya Deco Strapless. Both might work for you. The Deco Strapless allows quite a bit of upper fullness for a strapless bra.   The next step is then either Panache, Fantasie or Curvy Kate.   In your case I would recommend Curvy Kate Luxe. If that is too shallow, Fantasie Smoothing Strapless.  Strapless bras are a tricky fit, so you probably need to try more than one bra."

ABraThatFits,3bzptj,atheologist,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:27:44 2015 UTC,"Ok then, thanks and useful to know, it fitted really nicely but as I could immediately do it up on the loosest hook I'm sister-sizing a band down."
ABraThatFits,3bzdfg,nomspoms,2,Fri Jul 3 11:18:46 2015 UTC,"I am a 28G/30FF. I actually hated the Deco strapless, I thought it really flattened me out and made my boobs look quite wide...it just really wasn't flattering on me. I prefer the Wonderbra Ultimate Strapless. It's not perfect, but it's pretty good! It doesn't have wires (it has thick plastic 'hands' to hold you up), so although it's not particularly projected, it's quite flexible on how you wear it IMO. It sits lower than a regular bra usually would. It doesn't come in a 28 band, but I have it in a 30FF and it's fine for me. It might be hard to find somewhere to try it on though unless you're in the UK."
ABraThatFits,3bzdfg,sympathyboner,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:10:47 2015 UTC,I think it definitely depends on shape! I'm even shape and projection and like the deco. What is your shape?

I'm fairly even as well and the regular Deco gapes on top for me but I really like the strapless! It could be too shallow on the bottom for you though, but it might be your best bet.  I know Curvy Kate has rather projected strapless bras as well though. Definitely check out bratabase measurements and reviews!"

ABraThatFits,3bzdfg,jenshaka,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:35:07 2015 UTC,I love both the Deco Darling strapless (vs the regular Deco strapless) and the Wonderbra Ultimate Strapless. I'm a 28FF (not sure what my flair says) and they both have their uses (depending on what I'm wearing).
ABraThatFits,3bzdfg,Julez22,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:18:46 2015 UTC,Do they both work for your shape though? What would you say yours is?
ABraThatFits,3bzdfg,jenshaka,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:12:59 2015 UTC,"I'd say I'm a 2/5. The Wonderbra is great when I want more cleavage. Imo, the cups aren't very deep so it just pushes my breast tissue up. As far as the Deco Darling, it's my everyday strapless. I can wear it literally everyday. Super comfy, no digging, and doesn't do the weird ""mouse ears"" on me like the regular Deco strapless does.  And just for reference,  I also own a Wacoal Red Carpet strapless that I wear only because I bought it. Cups are definitely not deep enough at the bottom and there's not enough projection all around so it kind of squishes me in and makes me look like a boy. Lol.  Hope that helps."
ABraThatFits,3bzdfg,jenshaka,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:22:33 2015 UTC,How does the Deco Darling differ from the regular Deco? Also - mouse ears? I'm looking for a more minimising shape rather than cleavage plus.
ABraThatFits,3bzdfg,Julez22,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:45:03 2015 UTC,Deco Darling has this binding at the top that pulls the top of the in closer to you. Regular Deco tends to bow out on the sides on me.
ABraThatFits,3byn99,FattyBoomBoobs,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:53:47 2015 UTC,"You could try the Deco Plunge - it's relatively wide and shallow in 32G, as far as I know. The cups are taller than the half cups you've got now (so less cakes on a plate Victoria bosom), but because it's a plunge it may give you more central ""buttcrack"" cleavage depending on your shape. It doesn't give me any, but my breasts are splayed.   The Deco Half Cup could also work but it only comes in cups up to UK F. Sister sizing up to 36F, especially with the stretchy Freya bands, won't be very comfortable.  Also, your Envy ripped? How did this happen, and how old was the bra when it happened? You might want to contact Panache and send them pictures of the damage, as they've been having manufacturing issues recently and I'm sure they'd want to know so they can rectify it if the damage was due to a manufacturing error."
ABraThatFits,3byn99,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:43:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your tips.  The bra was about 4 months old when it ripped.

ABraThatFits,3byn99,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:04:43 2015 UTC,"Seeing as it was a 32FF and Panache generally runs tight, I wouldn't think that it was caused by the straps doing too much of the lifting. Did it feel tight when you wore it? And was the rip along the vertical side seam or the horizontal seam along the top edge of the band?"

ABraThatFits,3byqf9,thegyps,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:28:07 2015 UTC,I'm gonna 100% recommend sizing down to the 28DD. It would sister size up to a 30D and if your 30C feels like the right size I might try its sister size which is a 28D if the 28 band felt the most comfortable but the 30C cups felt good.
ABraThatFits,3byqf9,Crikey-Way,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:40:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply! I'll try a 28DD in the bras I'm exchanging online. I know of some stores nearby that carry 30D, so I'll head there and see if any of those fit too. I'm still adjusting to having a band size that really fits, so it might be nice to have options of a slightly looser fit, on days a 28 feels uncomfortable."
ABraThatFits,3byqf9,Julez22,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:13:38 2015 UTC,"I think 28DD UK (the normal sizing you should use) makes the most sense, unless you think your current 30C cups are too small. You might just not be used to large enough cups, which is why the wires seemed to go out too far (swoop and scoop!) or you could have narrower roots. Neve is really shallow and doesn't work for many people.  What do you think your shape is? I think Juna is worth trying again but in 28D and DD. You can return it I hope? Or sell/trade it on r/braswap!"
ABraThatFits,3byqf9,Julez22,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:25:30 2015 UTC,"The 30C cups are too small (quadboobing on the side, even when I swoop). I'll definitely try the Juna again in the new sizes, I bought it on Amazon, so returns will be simple. I'll be sure to keep an eye on how the wire fits too. I think it could be that I'm just not used to it yet. Thanks for your advice! :)"
ABraThatFits,3byqf9,Julez22,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:10:43 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, I guess you must be a DD then. Yeah, since you quad on the side a lot currently, maybe the wires are just too narrow for you and that's why the Cleos seemed so wide! Do you have an idea of what your shape is?"
ABraThatFits,3bz1rs,milkdeliverycharisma,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:43:05 2015 UTC,"For your shape, I think vertically seamed half cups might be worth a shot. Freya Patsy and clones would be a good choice, as would Cleo Juna (though you might need to size up in the cups as it does run a bit small).   Our size is really tricky to approximate in American brands, unfortunately. Most of the ones that make 30DDD run small in the cup and have stretchy bands. Some Betsey Johnson styles might work, though I have no idea which ones. I've stuck with the British brands so far, though I would love to try Polish eventually!"
ABraThatFits,3bz1rs,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:19:52 2015 UTC,"The Cleo Juna sounds like exactly what I'm looking for! Thanks for the size tip :D  Yeah, I'd really love to be able to buy more bras locally without breaking the bank. D:"
ABraThatFits,3bz1rs,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:46:16 2015 UTC,"Amazon! I've found it's way cheaper than looking for bras locally (even 30/32 bands aren't cheap, and they rarely ever go on sale in the stores that have them). Right now Amazon has 76 bras that are Prime-eligible in 28F, and most of them have been marked down from their original retail price at least a little bit. They have 118 bras in 28F if you count the ones that aren't Prime-eligible."
ABraThatFits,3byg66,Prettyncharmuese,3,Fri Jul 3 04:45:48 2015 UTC,"So, a lot of these look too shallow (especially at the bottom), some of them look too small.  I don't think you are doing S&S wrong, especially if have bras that sit below your IMF even after S&S - that means that your boobs go out more horizontally on bottom than the bra wants them to. Not lifting the boobs up would make that problem worse."
ABraThatFits,3byg66,j_sunrise,3,Fri Jul 3 10:09:52 2015 UTC,"So what do you think would be a good bra to try? I think when I swoop & scoop everything gets moved to the center. But I do feel as though my breasts are wide. It's like there's a good amount of tissue by my armpits, as well as in the middle of my chest, but at the same time, I have some projection."
ABraThatFits,3by5my,santiy,10,Fri Jul 3 03:09:51 2015 UTC,"Just buy whatever you want! And, if it's something to go under your dress, something that works with it, of course.   I don't own any matching sets at all (I don't care about panties, I'm a fan of Hanes there :P). I also didn't buy anything special for my wedding night - as it turned out we were just too tired out by the day (and I was feeling unwell) that we just chilled in bed and watched TV together. Wedding nights are super-exciting, yep.  I own something like a dozen bras at the moment. They're all normal bras, not fancy/sexy lingerie or anything, but they're also all quite pretty. My husband and I were together for six years and living together for two before we got married, so he's seen all my underwear before. He likes my current bra collection, because they fit me and hence look good on me and I'm happy in them and way more confident about myself than I used to be."
ABraThatFits,3by5my,LadyVerene,3,Fri Jul 3 03:45:18 2015 UTC,"Ah I see! Thanks for the reply :) ever since I started buying the right size, all my bras are pretty and cute, so I'm not sure what's supposed to be a 'sexy bra' anymore! But yeah I'll just keep doing what I'm doing and buy the type I love wearing :)"
ABraThatFits,3by5my,LadyVerene,2,Fri Jul 3 11:40:18 2015 UTC,"The other thing about that, too, is if you're wearing bras that you like, and fit you, and you feel confident about yourself in...even if the bras themselves are not typically sexy, the fact that you feel good about yourself and confident in them is going to make you appear sexy anyway.   I really have found that sexiness is more about state of mind than what you're wearing. Like, you can be wearing the hottest outfit ever, but if you feel shy and uncomfortable in it it's going to be obvious. But if you're wearing something you enjoy, that makes you feel good, and it gives you that thought of ""I am amazing and a badass and I love myself"", that will also be obvious. And confidence is extremely alluring.  So yeah - buy the stuff you like, because the fact that you love wearing it will make more of an impression than what it actually is."

ABraThatFits,3by5my,eveningtrain,6,Fri Jul 3 14:51:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think that there's any particular rules, it depends on your budget and preferences. I only bought one matching set to wear under my wedding dress (I got my dress made with 'must be able to wear regular bra underneath' as a primary concern because of my size). I'm not a matching undies person though, it's not something that bothers me at all.  I know that one of my sisters got 3-4 matching sets, but she was in a size range where most full bust styles will fit acceptably, so she could just grab cute things which were on sale on Brastop, Ebay etc.  You don't have to be as spartan as me, but there's no reason why you can't if you wouldn't care about matching stuff normally."
ABraThatFits,3by5my,joanna70,2,Fri Jul 3 03:22:14 2015 UTC,"Interesting! Yeah, matching is not what I do normally but I thought I might make a bit more effort since for once someone will see it ;) 3-4 sounds like a nice amount to me, especially since for under the actual wedding dress I got quite a normal looking nude strapless."
ABraThatFits,3by5my,hellebora,6,Fri Jul 3 03:29:45 2015 UTC,"There is definitely no norm or expectation for what is in your underwear drawer... I think the idea is that for lots of ladies (and gents!), when you are sexually active, shopping for cute lingerie to surprise your bedfellow is really fun. I, myself, have a few-and-far-between type sex life, but I love matching bra and panty sets and buy them to treat myself (I realized the secret to that is to buy like 3 or 4 pairs of matching panties for one bra LOL). if you already have a few bras that Fit, you might just enjoy buying one beautiful set for the special night or the honeymoon, but if you don't, it could be a good opportunity to stock up on well-fit bras you will get a lot of use out of!"

ABraThatFits,3by3jt,Julez22,9,Fri Jul 3 02:51:01 2015 UTC,"If she says the band felt too tight for her, don't push it. Granted the 30E may have felt tight because of the cup being small, but again, don't push it. Recommend 32DD/DDD(E) for her as a next size. Down the line, she may want a snigger band and y'all can tackle that when it comes. Tell her about scoop/swoop and just tell her you're there if she wants to know more."
ABraThatFits,3by3jt,dezeiram,3,Fri Jul 3 04:10:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm hoping she likes some 32s enough to not care that they're hard to find and then goes from there.

ABraThatFits,3by3jt,lightning_crashes,3,Fri Jul 3 17:11:33 2015 UTC,"Some people need to size up in the band, whether it's due to tactile issues, physical problems, or bony/muscular ribcages. Or it might be out of availability or personal preference. Your sister might be one of them. I highly doubt a 32DD would be all that supportive if she's closer to 30F. I'm guessing part of why she complained about the band is because VS bras are known for being really stretchy, and that's what she's used to. On top of that, most of what they have is molded cups, which can hide a whole slew of fit problems. Don't get me wrong, VS bras are actually ok bras, but they're ok for the size range and shape they're designed for. VS has a very small size range compared to Bravissimo, and not many people actually fit it.   That said, a lot of people think VS is the be-all, end-all when in reality, it's a lifestyle brand that happens to have a lot of clout in the bra industry. VS is familiar to her. She probably started out in those bras and maybe wore them all through high school. If she gets on with a 32DD from there ok for now, then that's fine. She needs to be ready to try the UK and European brands in a different size.   As far as what to try, I wonder if she might like Cleo and Freya. They've both got t-shirt bras like what she's used to wearing. Both brands are no more expensive than VS, and they come in a much bigger size range."
ABraThatFits,3by3jt,lightning_crashes,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:38:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah the one she was wearing seemed to encompass most of her tissue, but it was very padded, and really wasn't supporting anything since the band went up to her shoulders. I'm hoping she finds 32DDs she likes and that leads her to being more willing to try other brands! I really think she would like some of them, even though she didn't like the ones of mine she tried on. I just feel like you might as well go braless if you're not going to wear a supportive band! She only just graduated high school so we are young and there is time to change hopefully(:"
ABraThatFits,3by3jt,t_maia,3,Fri Jul 3 17:16:01 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me like what's happening is her 34Ds are basically cradling her boobs. She probably figures that VS knows their stuff because they're the foremost experts in all things underwear. They've probably told her that 34D ""looks good"", and that it was how a bra was supposed to fit. I'm sure they honestly think that's the case, but you gotta remember they're also dealing with a range that encompasses roughly 15 sizes in store.   Your sister will be ahead of the game by leaps and bounds once we help get her in a better fit. It sounds to me like if VS doesn't sell it, she doesn't like it, and that happens from time to time. When someone's that set in their ways, they need to be so sick of the problems their current bras are giving them before they'll consider that yes, there is life beyond VS."

One that might work for you is the Anita Momentum 5529. It's a compression bra, EU cup sized, so if you're a UK 34G/GG, you'd perhaps want a 36H in that bra (which would be equivalent to UK 36FF), but you may have to play around with the size a bit to get it to work for you."

You may just fit into their regular size range depending on your actual measurements, or if not, you can look on Ebay and sometimes there's bras with sewing errors which make them effectively a little bigger in the cup than the standard size range. The regular sports is pretty heavy-duty, and I think that the Lite (designed for yoga and low impact sports) would probably be enough for everyday wear unless you were planning to let it double as a bra for running.  I got a custom sized one, and when it fit, it was super comfy and somewhat minimising (there's only so much you can really do with a chest my size),  I'd have worn it on a semi-regular basis if it wasn't for the super high neckline (it would be fine under a button-up, but less useful under a dress or tank top)."

I've done exactly the opposite to scooping and swooping in order to decrease my huge quadraboobing when I wore my old 32Fs.

ABraThatFits,3bxbyi,MutantToenail,7,Fri Jul 3 15:25:35 2015 UTC,Measure yourself!! And use the bra calculator in the side bar to figure out the size. Only then can we really help and give suggestions for bras to try. :)
ABraThatFits,3bxbyi,BADWOLF317,11,Thu Jul 2 22:53:42 2015 UTC,"Can you post your 5 measurements? They are Snug Underbust (measure comfortably snug near ribcage underneath the bust), Tight UB (same area, just pull the tape as tight as it can go), Standing Bust (Measure on fullest part of your boobs standing up), Leaning Bust (Lean over roughly 90 degrees and measure over fullest part of bust), and Lying Bust (Laying on back, over fullest part) Once you post these, then we can get a better idea of what size to try."
ABraThatFits,3bxbyi,ariawhatever,4,Thu Jul 2 22:54:57 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're neither a 34C, 34D or 38B as the perfect bra will not have any of the symptoms you described.  If the excess tissue in the 34C can fill up your hand, then you're probably needing at least a volume up (34D). Ds are all different sizes in cup volume (they're proportional to your band size).A 28D for example can hold the same amount of breast tissue as a 32A, whereas a 38D can hold the same as US32G/32F.  Also you might need a different shaped cup. Does it gap at just the top? That doesn't mean it's too big, just the wrong shape.   VS online method puts me at a 38AA when I'm actually a UK 30FF / US 30H, so judging by that, I'm taking a rough guess that your real size is closer to 28H UK which is roughly slightly slimmer than average with slightly bigger than average boobs. If this sounds like you then please have a look at the measurement guide and please post your five measurements!  I had all the exact issues you mentioned when I was wearing 32Bs! Here are my before and afters -  I initially went from 32B to 32D then to 30DD then to 28FF"
ABraThatFits,3bxm44,joanna70,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:11:22 2015 UTC,"Sorry no-one has answered, I've never got to grips with how Chantelle fits, the wires are too narrow for me.  So I'd say you're definitely not right at the end of the shallow spectrum, you're probably at least moderately projected, not wide either as the wire's aren't generally wide (you can measure them and compare to a classic wide/shallow bra like Freya Patsy on bratabase.com, make sure you select the same sizes to compare).  The larger your root the more shallow you are, so no, if you're not properly shallow your root won't be large, but you might have a tallish root even if you are on the narrower side.  The taller and wider you are the shallower you are in general.  You have probbaly have positive tissue migration, I've gone up two cup sizes since finding this sub.  You can bend the tips of the gore away from you, if the wires are firm you may need pliers.  Gore height may affect how much it cuts in, equally firm gores are worse (to that end I prefer Eveden famiy bras to Panache/Cleo, the wires are softer)."

ABraThatFits,3bwfva,anaxiphilia,7,Thu Jul 2 20:41:38 2015 UTC,One pieces are always tricky. If your breast position on your body is higher or lower or if your torso length is shorter or longer than the swimsuit is designed for then it just won't fit.  You can't really decide if it'll work for you based on others' suggestions. You'll just have to order a bunch of swimsuits (preferably with free shipping and returns) and try them on.
ABraThatFits,3bwfva,noys,4,Thu Jul 2 19:52:50 2015 UTC,"Panache, Curvy Kate, Bravissimo and probablu Freya have suits in your range. I wear a 32JJ and I found my Panache one piece to be too short in the torso (which makes the wires sit too low) so I picked up a Curvy Kate tankini which is wired and much better in length"
ABraThatFits,3bwfva,cercidasthecynic,3,Thu Jul 2 20:26:35 2015 UTC,Panache has some tankini tops that are technically a 2 piece but cover everything like a 1 piece would.

ABraThatFits,3by1lg,Crikey-Way,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:47:50 2015 UTC,"I love the look of Portia, the shape it gives to you looks very well. It doesn't seem big in cups, actually. It rather looks like one of your breasts is a bit smaller, and the bra sits good at the bigger one and the small wrinkling appears only at the smaller one which is normal. Is the wrinkling worse or better when your arms are not up?"
ABraThatFits,3by1lg,yellkaa,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:37:27 2015 UTC,"The wires of Cleo Lucy, Panache Tango and CK Portia all seem to be too low on your chest. They are not in your inframammary fold. It is especially obvious in the Tango.   Please try placing the wires correctly.   Panache Tango and Freya Siren - take a look at the photo showing your back in both the Freya Siren and the Panache Tango.   Freya is narrower and more projected than Panache.   You can see that there is a lot less chub under your arms in the Siren, this is because of that said projection. You need space in front. The Tango does not give you this space, so it shoves your tissue towards your back.    wire felt too long and went to high up into my arm pits   Still, there is a lot of space between the tip of the underwire and your armpit, about 3 inches or so? Considering that you are only 5ft 2in and this is the Tango which has about the tallest wires available, this is enormous.   I am 5ft 9in and I got maybe 1 inch between the tip of the underwire in Tango and my armpit.   So either you are wearing the Tango too low in the photo or your got low-set breasts.    felt like the wires weren't far enough back on my sides.    It is interesting that you say this about the Tango because that bra is known for having relatively wide wires. You don't complain about the same with the Freya Siren, which has narrower wires than the Tango. I think the higher projection and the softer wires of Freya play a role here.   Just with this info I would recommend Elomi bras because they got wide wires yet offer deeper cups than Panache bras.   Sadly you are not too happy about the fit of the Elomi bras. Can you say more about what you don't like about them? Do you dislike how the shape looks in profile? Or does it feel wrong for your breasts?   The Elomi Rita is just too large, ditto for Caitlyn. In Etta the wires are bent out of shape, indicating that the band is a bit too tight. Apart from that Etta looks really good.   Cleo Lucy is just too shallow for you, again there is tissue that gets shoved towards your back. The wires then poke into that tissue.  Portia also seems to be too shallow in the cup, additionally it does not allow the volume in the bottom cup that you need. This is why your nipples sit too high in the cup. I doubt that you'll ever get a good fit in Curvy Kate.   BTW, you have hooked all bras on the middle hook. These are new bras, they should fit fine on the loosest hook."
ABraThatFits,3by1lg,t_maia,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:54:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply. I still have the bras, I'm going to try the Elomi ones on again. I wasn't a fan cause they look like grandma bras to me. But I should really get over that if I want to find one that fits me best.   Thanks for noticing I had them all latched in the middle. I've never put bras on that way, I usually hook in front and spin but was told not to do that anymore.   Would you suggest I just go down a cup size in Rita and Caitlyn? Are there any others that have similar wire shape as Elomi that I should try?"
ABraThatFits,3by1lg,t_maia,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:00:44 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem with Etta. The bra allows a lot of volume in the bottom cup and in the upper part of the cup. In my case my breasts sank into the bottom cup, leaving the upper part of the cup empty.   Additionally the Etta is a 38GG, the same size as the Rita and the Caitlyn, so it is normal that the bra should be too large.   I would encourage you to try more Elomi bras in 38FF and 38G.   Similar shape - Goddess is the sisterbrand, but the bras are shallower, which is a no-go. Fauve unpadded bras would be interesting if you can still find them, they are narrower than Elomi yet have a similar projection. Panache Envy falls into the same category. Some also had luck with Fantasie Side Support cuts like Jana and Lois.   And if you are willing to sink some serious money, Primadonna in US 38H might work."

I put arrows to all the places I noticed it. Hard to take pics of it all. The top of the cup doesn't sit flush, I could easily fit my hand in there with no pressure from the fabric.

So their 28C might be a bit small on your boobs, and they don't make 28Ds.  Maybe some of their fuller coverage styles would work in a 28C?  28C is a very difficult size to find.  28D used to be easier to find, but even Cleo has dropped that size :( I don't know how well you sew, but you might be able to find a 30B or 30C and take in the band.  I know there are some 30C Aerie Sunnies for sale for $12 each over on r/braswap, but don't know if the cups would be too big.  You could also hop on Amazon, go to the bras department, search by 28C, and see what pops up.... here, I did the search, here's a link (it's almost all TLBC bras):    http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_p_n_size_five_browse_3?fst=as%3Aoff&rh=n%3A7141123011%2Cn%3A7147440011%2Cn%3A1040660%2Cn%3A9522931011%2Cn%3A14333511%2Cn%3A1044960%2Cp_n_size_three_browse-vebin%3A1289794011%2Cp_n_size_five_browse-vebin%3A1289828011&bbn=1044960&ie=UTF8&qid=1435855958&rnid=1289824011  Natori Feathers in 30B or 30C might be an option (it runs small in the cups too), unfortunately it's not made in 28s but you may find you don't need a super tight band for adequate support.  If you do find it too loose, there are tutorials everywhere about how to take in a band, both permanently and reversibly.   http://www.amazon.com/Natori-Womens-Feathers-Contour-Plunge/dp/B007DKZD0W/ref=sr_1_1?s=apparel&ie=UTF8&qid=1435856088&sr=1-1&keywords=feathers&refinements=p_89%3ANatori"

ABraThatFits,3bxu73,MeltingEvergreen,3,Fri Jul 3 01:25:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert in your shape/size but a few thoughts.  1 - look at old vs new underwires. Your old underwires were sitting on breast tissue and below your IMF (the fold your breast makes). If you compare the two you will see difference.  2 - I'm trying to think of a more PC term but coming up short. You seem to have a roundish ribcage. Your ribcage is wider under your breast tissue than under, which can skew measurements.  3 - make sure you are scooping and swooping fully, esp when you have been wearing bad bras for awhile your breast tissue will be pushed into armpits and the like.  4 - there is a definite shape MIS-match, you are shallower and that bra seems more projected/full on top.  Measurments are always a starting point. If you go into 10 stores and buy pants you will end up with more than 1 size out of the bunch.   I'd look for bras ment for shallower breasts, and I'd probably start at a DD/E to account for your ribcage shape. You may still find you need a F in a shallower bra.  Fwiw I like cleo bras as they are narrower and projected so they generally work well. I own several, all in 28H. I bought a new older style bra with the same shape as ones I currently own and it was a HOT mess. Looked about 2 cups too small. I suspect it would work better for a full on bottom lady, but looked ridiculously too small on me.  Not all shapes work!"
ABraThatFits,3bxu73,basylica,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:13:37 2015 UTC,"Pants... So true. I suspect it will probably be easier to head to Nordstrom so I can try a bunch at once, maybe since I didn't fill out the E I can go down closer to a matrix size (wouldn't that be novel!)

ABraThatFits,3bxu73,basylica,3,Fri Jul 3 02:46:27 2015 UTC,"Your size should be fairly represented at nords, but I don't know how many options they will have. You might try a freya half cup or a patsy. I think both are good for shallow.   Shallow is a shape thing. It just means your tissue is spread out across your chest. Think bowl vs cup.  Mine are projected which means the base of my breast is smaller than yours, but stands out from my body more. Yours have a wider footprint on your body.  So a bra that is ""deep"" will seem way too big. No matter how small you go. You will always have extra fabric at the tip of your breast in a deep cup. A shallow cup has a wider cup with less ""projection""  On me it would be like wearing a corset. Boobs smooshed flat.   Poke around, search for shallow here and you will see lots of suggestions.

Nordstrom Rack is another great option once you've narrowed down your size and if you end up being 34DD they'll carry a lot of bras in your size.

I rarely head in there because I have experienced such odd measuring in the past there. I always knew they were just telling people sizes that they carry vs what they are.   Nordstrom Rack is difficult in my area. There's plenty of them but in Seattle they're no secret since we're the land of Nordstrom HQ, we've had Rack since the 70s so they're pretty picked over. I will be encouraged to check out the higher cup sizes now though! They never have 34Bs in stock that aren't the sort of thing that would be lumpy under a tshirt and I always grumble at the focus on bigger cups, but maybe I'd find more in the upper end of 34!

Also, if you do not like unlined bras going for padded bras is an option but you may need a cup size bigger than for an unlined bra.   And a third thing because I'm a liar, is the band too tight that it leaves red marks if you wear it all day or is it just too tight feeling because you're not used to it?

I don't mean to be hostile, but it really bugs me when I say something is uncomfortable and people suggest that I just need to get used to it, I thought the point of getting a bra that fits is that it's comfortable."

My snug measure is 30.5 but I need to wear a 32 because a 30 would be wayyy too tight (I'm assuming. I'm heading to a bra boutique today to find out for sure).   If you think they're too tight to stand, then I'd try more 36 bands with cup sizes close to what you've already tried."
ABraThatFits,3bxbp1,braaccount,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:30:56 2015 UTC,"Okay I'll give that a try, thank you! I'm going to try to order some more bras today in styles that a couple people have suggested and I'll try your suggestion with the bands. I've got Amazon Prime, so I'll just send them back if it doesn't work."
ABraThatFits,3bxbp1,braaccount,5,Fri Jul 3 14:39:27 2015 UTC,"I am no use on what to try next, as I'm still pretty lost myself, but I'm gonna point out that I'm seeing some folding and wrinkling at the bottom of the Clara, which makes it look like you might not have swooped and scooped the bra into your IMF.  I'd try them on again with some vigorous S&S before giving up hope! And the reason unlined are recommended is that in the early stages of nailing down your size and shape, little things like wrinkles and puckering, which are signs of bigger fit issues, are much easier to detect. Once you're more confident in what size and shapes work for you, finding the demis and halfcups you'll like on the first try will be much easier!"
ABraThatFits,3bxbp1,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:11:38 2015 UTC,"Nope, definitely always SS in all my bras. The Clara is basically unlined so I figured I'd try it, I really just like lightly lined bras, no padding which always feels cumbersome to me."
ABraThatFits,3bxbp1,Goddess_Keira,2,Fri Jul 3 02:36:36 2015 UTC,"See if the Clara gets better when you position the cups like the other comments said, and try it with all 3. Despite the wrinkling, both the 34F and 36E look borderline too small based on the side views, like there's breast tissue waiting to escape over the wings. I am curious about the bands, though â when you took your measurements, is it possible that you measured the snug underbust too tightly? It's supposed to be comfortably tight-ish, but not so much that the tape gets stretched.  My guess is that if you do the same with the Maddie, you'll get even more gaping on top and it'll slide down again because the cups are too shallow for you."
ABraThatFits,3bxbp1,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:17:15 2015 UTC,"The thing is I did swoop and scoop, always have, I didn't even know it had a name till I came to this sub.  I definitely spent some time adjusting myself into each one and they really didn't fit.  I suppose it is possible that I measured wrong, though I don't think so my tape wasn't stretchy and I'm pretty familiar with measuring myself and others from having worked in theatre costume shops so I don't know :-/"
ABraThatFits,3bxbp1,Goddess_Keira,2,Fri Jul 3 02:45:04 2015 UTC,"Well, that means the underwires slid down after you put the bra on, which can be due to a couple of things: The wires are being distorted by the band or the cups are not the right shape for you.  What's weird about the Clara is that the band looks tighter in the 36E (you can see the hooks and eyes straining in the back shot) than in the 34F. Unfortunately Bratabase has no measurements for either of those sizes, but other data suggest that the Clara runs reasonably tight, not actually undersized, so short of mislabeling...I don't know. It's very odd.   Based on what I can see of your shape, I'd tentatively suggest trying the Cleo Lucy in 36E and 38DD to rule out the possibility that something went wrong with the underbust measurements. For your concerns about nipples showing in unlined bras, the usual advice is to use silicone nipple covers, but it's not like you have to go out and get those right now or anything -- you're not necessarily going to keep the Lucy."
ABraThatFits,3bxbp1,EmmaInFrance,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:08:31 2015 UTC,"I'll give it a try to see if it can help pin down my size though probably won't keep, as it looks too full coverage. Thanks for the tip!"
ABraThatFits,3bxbp1,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:16:54 2015 UTC,"So quick update I tried remeasuring just in case but for snug underbust I'm still getting 34 34.5 at the very most.  I also retried on all of the bras, but the 34 one are so tight my skin bulges around them and they're super uncomfortable.  The 36 still seemed tight, but much more wearable in the band."
ABraThatFits,3bxbp1,Pheasantheroworship,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:25:38 2015 UTC,"Based on how you look in Clara, I'd say that you have a projected, even shape, 2/5 on the shape chart. The wires of that bra look as though they're a bit narrow for you, but that might be because of how it's sitting on your body.  The Panache Clara in 36E has some potential. I don't think your nipples would show in it under clothes, but the lace would show. In those pictures, the bra isn't sitting in your inframammary fold--none of those bras are, in fact. If you look, you will see that there's space between the wire and the root of your breast at the chest wall.  It would be interesting to see, if you could bend over and position the underwire so that it sat right up against the root under your chest, how the cups and band would fit then and if the bra would stay there, where it should. I see from your responses to other comments that you did s&s, so maybe that means that the bras just wouldn't stay in the IMF long enough to take pictures. Usually that means that the bra either isn't projected enough, or the wire width is too narrow. Either way, your breasts force the bra down to get the room they need to project forward.  Maddie is definitely not the bra for you. It is too shallow and the wire, which is not in your IMF, would not stay there because your breasts need more projection than that bra has. In plain language, your breasts want to stick out further in front than that bra has space for. Unfortunately, I think the same could be said for almost all padded and/or molded bras.   The exception might be bras from Polish manufacturers, but I don't know how they behave in your size range. They are not so easily ordered and returned as bras off Amazon. It's a much more time-consuming process and as you may not be happy with the results, I don't recommend it.  I'm at a loss here, because I'd really like to be able to suggest something you would enjoy wearing. I don't think your usual 36C would truly fit you well. I feel certain that it would sit too low on your body, not in the IMF, and just sort of cover the lower part of your breasts without actually lifting or shaping them. It's maybe not uncomfortable, but it isn't doing much for your shape, either.  However, I'm hampered by the fact that the bras you like aesthetically aren't the bras that give the best fit for your shape. It's perfectly valid of you not to like a fuller-coverage bra, but by the standards we use, that's what will fit best. Maybe somebody can recommend a lined demi that will work with your projected shape without looking too full-coverage for your taste, but I have no ideas, unfortunately."
ABraThatFits,3bx9qh,flowerling,4,Thu Jul 2 22:25:48 2015 UTC,"I think with a snug UB of 28 (tight being 26.5) a 28 band works fine and are more accessible to find online or in store than a 26. It appears a 28DD would fit you best. If one boob is smaller, I suppose maybe you could pad it out a little as the bra is designed to fit the larger breast. Other people can be more help as for recommendations, but I have the basics."
ABraThatFits,3bx9qh,ariawhatever,3,Thu Jul 2 22:38:49 2015 UTC,"I think you may have put your measurements in the calculator in the wrong order, which is why everyone is suggessting 28DD instead.  I'd try 28E, the next cup size up from 28DD, since it is made for a 28"" ribcage and a 34"" bust. The leaning bust is usually most accurate for small-to-medium busts."
ABraThatFits,3bx9qh,DancingDraft,2,Fri Jul 3 04:47:06 2015 UTC,"I would definitely try purchasing on amazon where you can get free shipping and free returns.   A 26 will be difficult to find and seems like it would be pretty snug on you. If I were you, I'd start with a 28DD, see how it fits.   The only thing I've ever really seen work for different sized cups is using a bra with air pads and buy the bra to fit the smaller breast. You remove the air pad from the larger one. It doesn't always work if your sizes are way off. I'd like to know other tips on this too.   Good luck!! I gave up because of how frustrating this whole process is."
ABraThatFits,3bx9qh,LadyAnju,2,Thu Jul 2 22:52:44 2015 UTC,"Usually a band size refers to how far the band will stretch out, so a 32 band stretches to 32"" at the most. 26 bands tend to run snug, so they probably wouldn't fit you. 28DD would probably be better and is much easier to find."
ABraThatFits,3bx9qh,findis,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:38:05 2015 UTC,"This is generally true, but really it means that they stretch to about that size. With a 26 band, 26 probably is the very farthest that it will stretch, since as you say, they tend to run firm (less material=less ability to stretch), but as someone who would ideally wear 31 bands, I don't think there are very many 32 bands that are stretched to their limit at 32."""
ABraThatFits,3bx9qh,Shanakitty,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:10:04 2015 UTC,"Start with 28E. 32C is designed for a 35"" bust so I'd go by your biggest bust measurement especially if you have asymmetry."

If your breasts are shallow, it's possible that the wires might be too narrow and be sitting on delicate, growing breast tissue. Shape is just as important as size!   If you get a few minutes, can you remeasure and share your 5 measurements? That will help narrow down whether you're in the right size boat at least. Also, what was the brand and model of the bra you recently bought?"

ABraThatFits,3bxeib,cupcakery,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:22:15 2015 UTC,"Ahh ok, hm. So yeah your measurements point to a max size of 32D/34C but that doesn't mean a larger cup isn't out of the question. I'm not familiar with Warner's bras. Have you tried a bra with a wire? Maybe the soft cup isn't providing enough support, but that's just conjecture. Are you easily able to try it in a 34D to see if that helps?   As far as other bra styles to try, maybe consider b.tempt'd Ciao Bella in 34C and 34D, or Cleo Juna in 32D and 32DD (that one runs a little small in the cup and a little big in the band."

Are you spilling out of your current bras after scoop and swoop?  I started as a 32GG and quickly moved to a 30H and about 6m later to a 30hh because I'd worn 34DD bras for 20yrs. Boobs came out of the woodwork!  I've lost err... 25lbs? (I never ever weigh myself) and dropped down to current 28H, but I jumped in size first few months of wearing abtf."
ABraThatFits,3bxvph,basylica,2,Fri Jul 3 02:00:26 2015 UTC,"What fit issues are you having with your current bras? Your measurements do point more to a 32HH/J, with 32JJ being the largest possible size suggested by your measurments (32-46). It's not outside of the realm of possibility, since your standing and leaning are so close together.  I wear a 32JJ and measure 32-29.5-44-48-46."
ABraThatFits,3bxvph,Shanakitty,2,Fri Jul 3 02:04:17 2015 UTC,"Well my bras are currently not the right shape for my breasts,so I am spilling out the front but I have extra space at the sides. My roots are very narrow, I bought a few 34 gg Freya deco's about three months ago because they run a cup size large, making them fit more like a 34 h or so.The bands are huge on me, so I have purchased a rixie clip. However, I am still not getting a comfortable fit, due to the wires being to wide and the cups not deep enough for my breast tissue. I want to purchase in the future a comexim bra, however Iam unsure of what size to order. Also, I would think that your breasts would be larger than mine, due to your leaning and lying measurments being two to three inches larger, however the calculator puts us around the same size which is peculiar."
ABraThatFits,3bxvph,joanna70,3,Fri Jul 3 03:27:35 2015 UTC,You have less of a difference between your bust measurements which means you're more likely to fit towards your larger measurement.

ABraThatFits,3bxvph,peefaced1,3,Fri Jul 3 07:51:32 2015 UTC,"FYI, usually, the Deco only runs large if you are more full-on-bottom. Since it is neither narrow nor projected, I suggest you try purchasing a few UK brand bras first in something that better suits your shape while you work out your size, since they can usually be acquired and returned more easily. Try something like the Cleo Lily/Erin and Panache Jasmine in 32HH, 32J, and 32JJ. If you are not comfortable with unlined bras, you could look into getting nipple covers.   The calculator is using your leaning measurement because your bust measurements are pretty close together, but I do think a 32J is more likely than JJ.  If you do go for Comexim, you will probably be looking for a 70M for 32J or 70N for JJ. Since you don't have very much squish though, you may also want to try 75L and 75M, for models that run tight in the band. Ewa Michalak has worked better in this size range for me than Comexim has so far (I do want to try Comexim with some modifications)."

Edit: In general, you may find that some 32 bands are too tight for you with your comfortably snug being 34.

Big box stores like Joann's/Michael's don't really carry nicer yarns, just acrylics/acrylic blends which can be washed normally. But a LYS is going to carry more wool and other natural blends which is what knitters primarily use Soak for, since washing them like an acrylic blend will ruin them.

Since your snug measurement is 30, it's not unheard of to prefer a 32 band, especially in brands that run tight (like Cleo).  What bras did you try? Some brands use 30E in place of 30DD, so that may explain why the cup volume was good. I wouldn't recommend going all the way up to a 34 band, as that will be larger than your standing bust measurement and unlikely to provide you with enough support.   Conical shape is kind of a spectrum. I consider myself rather conical, but I have definitely seen breasts more conical than mine. Temperature/nipple-related shape change is quite common with conical shapes. This size discrepancy, though, doesn't seem to be due to that. Sometimes conical shaped breasts require you to size down a cup from what you measure, but I don't think that's necessarily the case here.   Your 34A probably felt better because your breast tissue was escaping into the (probably already stretched-out) band, therefore making the cups appear filled and the band feel snug/supportive. The 34D not fitting is likely due to shape differences and sister-sizing too far away from your measured size.  I would recommend trying Cleo Marcie in 30DD or 32D. That would help us troubleshoot the issues you're having a bit better I think!"

This is an enormous help and I can't tell you how much I appreciate it.   I tried a few bras from Figleaves... am blanking on the exact brand right now but I don't believe they were Cleo.   I'll give the 32D a try."
ABraThatFits,3bvsc8,joanna70,4,Thu Jul 2 17:19:14 2015 UTC,"it's a good idea to take the sort of photos people use for fitchecks even if only for your own use, and include one of the label.  Otherwise it really is just a random trying on of bras, if you have photos you can learn from what you try on, and make the journey faster.  If you are conical then a cup size smaller is often successful, and Cleo Marcie and Maddie commonly work, but it can be a tricky shape to fit with various solutions for different people."

ABraThatFits,3bvsc8,lcl0706,7,Thu Jul 2 16:07:25 2015 UTC,"Shape issues can cause a bra to not fit just as often as sizing issues. Without more specifics on what bras you tried in those sizes and what fit issues you had in those, we can't really tell you if it was a shape issue or if you really do need a slightly different size than you measured. You might also want to provide your actual measurements as the calculator is not 100% accurate for all women."

ABraThatFits,3bvsc8,Goddess_Keira,5,Thu Jul 2 16:07:36 2015 UTC,"Ok, your new measurements suggest a 30F, to me.  7 inches between your snug UB and leaning OB = cup size F.  You may be okay in a 30E.  If your 30E was too tight in the band, it's most likely because it was too small in the cups, or completely the wrong shape.  I'm making an educated guess you are quite projected, due to the 4"" difference between your standing and leaning OB.  What 30E bra did you try?  That will make a big difference in the advice I give going forward."
ABraThatFits,3bvsc8,joanna70,2,Thu Jul 2 17:00:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Yeah the 30E was way too tight in the band. I do have a bigger rib cage so maybe that's why, too?  I tried a Panache 30E bra from Figleaves..."
ABraThatFits,3bvdfu,coan-teen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:35:43 2015 UTC,"Did you check out the Shallow Guide?  It has a ton of recommendations, not all are made anymore but ""related cuts"" tabs on bratabase (against each individual model's overall entry) will help with that, or we can tell you more recent versions if you see a photo and like an end of line bra.  Also, you can measure your wire width as per the instructions on bratabase.com and then have a good go at working out what wire width WOULD be right, and go from there, bratabase measurements aren't totally reliable but will give you a good idea.  As a basic starter I'd look for padded half cups from the main makers, Freya, Cleo and B'Temptd would be a good place to start for you.  A 30 might be better in tighter bands, you'll need to read up on B'Temptd bands as I have no idea, but Cleo Juna/Maddie (the padded half cup styles that Cleo Makes) and all Freyas are stretchy, so you'll want 28DD, you might want to try 28D in Freya half cups as Juna/Maddie comes up smaller (doubt you'd need 28E in those)."

ABraThatFits,3bu0vx,DanishThief,10,Thu Jul 2 03:39:07 2015 UTC,"Going with UK sizes is probably a lot easier, since many brands in your size range will use UK sizing. 28F or 28FF is probably right. You might find that 30E and 30F are also worth trying, especially since 30E is easier to find and more affordable. Bras in 28F, 28FF, and 30F will be expensive."
ABraThatFits,3bu0vx,Saskia_C,12,Thu Jul 2 03:42:44 2015 UTC,"Bras in 28F, 28FF, and 30F will be expensive.   This isn't necessarily true, even depending on your definition of expensive. You just have to search out good prices and wait for sales. This bra is $19 in 28FF in nude  /u/DanishThief, what do you consider reasonably priced and are you open to shopping online?"
ABraThatFits,3bu0vx,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:37:17 2015 UTC,"Reasonably priced is in the 20-30 dollar range for me. I know that's not necessarily realistic, but I just think it's crazy to be spending nearly 50 dollars and up for one bra. I am open to shopping online, but I really wanted to try on my real size before going all out and just purchasing bras off the internet, you know?  Thank you for your help :)"
ABraThatFits,3bu0vx,joanna70,6,Thu Jul 2 05:04:13 2015 UTC,"Just on the subject, as GK says below, whether the price is crazy, well designed and made larger cup bras have a lot of work go into them and will be WAY more expensive to produce than your standard fashion store moulded cup bra available 34A-38D, in addition to the cost of holding the vast array of sizes.  I totally get that it's a lot of money but the product warrants it.  Of course once you know what fits you'll be able to find bras much more cheaply in clearance sales and on ebay etc, but in the meantime it is only fair to purchase one bra, if the service is good and the bra fits well, in a store where you try a whole load on.  Otherwise you can try /r/braswap and bratabase.com sales etc to try on some used bras to get your size and shape right."
ABraThatFits,3bu0vx,hurrrrrmione,3,Thu Jul 2 08:57:17 2015 UTC,"I totally understand. It's going to be very hard to impossible for you to find 28 bands in store, however, and 30E and 30F are not going to be easy finds, either. Online shopping gives you a lot more options.   Another option is if you can find 28 bands or 30 bands in stores, you can try them on and once you've found something that fits, you can try and find it cheaper online.   Check the offline retailer list to see if there are any stores in your area that carry 28 bands and/or 30 bands. This list has some places where you can purchase bras in your size online."
ABraThatFits,3bu0vx,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:11:33 2015 UTC,"Another option is if you can find 28 bands or 30 bands in stores, you can try them on and once you've found something that fits, you can try and find it cheaper online.    I know it's done all the time, but way to discourage any physical store from carrying those sizes. Planning to try on a store's inventory without any intention of buying even if it fits is just plain wrong and unfair. There's no way physical stores can stock inventory or even try to be competitive price-wise when shoppers have that attitude."
ABraThatFits,3bu0vx,hurrrrrmione,2,Thu Jul 2 05:39:11 2015 UTC,I wouldn't recommend anyone do that if they can afford the prices at a boutique or Nordstrom. But OP said she can't afford to spend $50+ on a bra.
ABraThatFits,3bu0vx,Goddess_Keira,2,Thu Jul 2 05:42:45 2015 UTC,"Actually, she didn't quite say that. She said she thinks it's ""crazy"" to spend that much for one bra.   I'm as much a fan of a bargain as anybody, and I understand budgetary constraints, and I'd rather try on in-store before buying, too. I've accepted that if I want the stores that have my size to stay open, I have to buy from them. If people keep on doing what you suggest, the physical stores will either be driven out of business or they'll only stock what they can sell. If we want physical stores to carry our sizes, we have to support them and make that a spending priority over some other discretionary things. Otherwise they can't afford to serve our needs. It's that simple."
ABraThatFits,3bu0vx,ericazibby,3,Thu Jul 2 05:51:32 2015 UTC,"I'll also add that there are many, many women who don't balk at paying $$$$$ for high quality handbags, shoes, jewelry, hair styling, etc etc. The list is endless. Point being we need to understand, as consumers, that bras recommended on this sub are priced accurately. They reflect the costs incurred to construct them, market them, and stock them. If it's too high a price for your budget, why not save your money and buy when you can afford it?"
ABraThatFits,3bu0vx,vonlowe,2,Thu Jul 2 16:06:47 2015 UTC,"You could try Amazon as they have free returns over a certain price, but I don't know what that is in the US, there is also a section where people can buy bras on bratabase, and also over on bra swap.

If you live near a Nordstrom or Nordstrom Rack, you may be able to find some 28FF bras (your likely UK size) there. Do you think your Mom will help you out with this? You should talk to her about it and hopefully she'll understand.  As you've been subscribed for awhile, you must have been doing some reading. How would you describe your shape? Once you have a handle on that, you can probably find something pretty reasonably priced on Amazon, assuming you're allowed to order on line."

I think I was about a 38H or 40H in US sizing when I was 15, so I can at least sympathize. While it is a pain finding those sizes in stores, I found buying online the best option for something that is cute and possibly affordable (Although maybe still a little expensive.) Bravissimo is a place I buy from a lot that seems to have cute options and a lot of sizes available.   When I was looking for bras originally I was lucky to have a lingerie store nearby that would work for the basics (meaning not as cute, solid colors like black, brown, and tan) and making sure the size I thought I was was a comfortable fit, before I went ordering things I couldn't necessarily try on online. Is there a store like that near you? Maybe they can help you out or put in an order for things in your size as well. Also, now that you have a size to work from, looking out for sales is a good way to start!

ABraThatFits,3bu6ce,cleverdistraction,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:46:42 2015 UTC,I was about to order a Rita in my sister size. I have Caitlyn on the way but wanted to wait until I got Caitlyn before buying another one. Is Elomi stretchy? I bought Caitlyn in a sister size 42HH instead of 42J and was worried about it being tight.
ABraThatFits,3bu6ce,foxyillusion,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:30:23 2015 UTC,"So I think but I am not totally sure, that elomi gets stretchier as you go up in band size.  So, I don't find it that stretchy in a 34, but I feel like back when I was a 38 band I did find them stretchier, so... possibly?  Can you order from somewhere like amazon where you can return/exchange for free (if in the US)?"
ABraThatFits,3bu6ce,t_maia,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:58:35 2015 UTC,I have Amazon Prime but I'm trying to find out in my size and a plunge to hopefully get the gore to tack. I need a 44J and it seems like an impossible size to find. My sister size is supposed to be 42HH and that's a little easier to find but not much. I also hate the idea of typing up $60 for a bra that I'm not sure will fit. It's kind of hard for me to get to UPS to return to Amazon since the closest one is pretty far. I have Caitlyn coming Monday and really excited about it but I'm trying to keep it in check.
ABraThatFits,3bu6ce,foxyillusion,2,Fri Jul 3 17:29:42 2015 UTC,"So sister sizes actually work the other direction. Like, if I'm a 34G, and I sister size down in the band, the cup gets bigger, to a 32GG. Or if I sister size up in the band, the cup size gets smaller, so 36FF.  So your sister size would be 42JJ I think. Sorry to be the bearer of potentially disappointing news :-/  http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/Sister_size"
ABraThatFits,3bu6ce,cleverdistraction,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:27:51 2015 UTC,Damn it. I messed up. My sister sizes are 46HH and 42JJ. Guess I'll be sending it back or trying to sell it on here. :/  Do you know anything about Goddess sizing? I have an option to buy one from Bare Necessities but they have only have 44L and 42L and 42M for me to get in my price range. I'm not sure what to go with.
ABraThatFits,3bu6ce,foxyillusion,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:22:00 2015 UTC,"I believe a UK J cup is a US M, so you'd need a 44M for Goddess, which it sounds like they don't have?  :("

ABraThatFits,3bu6ce,t_maia,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:20:44 2015 UTC,"I don't find Elomi as stretchy as many people say. They are nowhere near as stretchy as Freya or Fantasie. Elomi bras are slightly looser than Panache, but not by much. But the quality of the materials has changed in the last few years, in many bras Eveden shifted to softer wires that are more comfortable to wear but add an extra amount of stretch to the band. Sadly they neglected to adjust the length of the band. This is probably the main problem. There is also the phenomenon that too wide wires artificially extend the band, so if the wires are too wide for the person in question the band will feel far looser than it really is."
ABraThatFits,3bu6ce,foxyillusion,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:32:32 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I didn't get a notification for this! Elomi is super stretchy, as the 44 I had rode up and I probably would have been better off in a 42. I'd wait to see what you have so far when it comes in the mail, then go from there after you see how it all fits you."
ABraThatFits,3bu6ce,t_maia,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:05:10 2015 UTC,You look great!! This gives me hope that the gore will lay flat against my sternum one day. My breasts are close together like yours and I always thought I would have to settle with the gore coming close but never actually laying flat. I'm going to Nordstrom to try Goddess out. They actually don't look as bad as I thought they did.
ABraThatFits,3bu6ce,foxyillusion,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:32:30 2015 UTC,"It definitely depends on the Goddess bra, I think. Sure, they're never going to look as youthful and minimal as some Cleos, but I think Keira/Kayla looks pretty nice.  :)"
ABraThatFits,3bu6h8,alcadesa,2,Thu Jul 2 04:33:46 2015 UTC,"I have the Cleo Maddie and I find it pretty wide. I would advise away from it. Do you consider yourself narrow and shallow? I am shallow and wide so I dont have a lot of expertise on bras for you, but the Natori feathers might be worth a try."
ABraThatFits,3bu6h8,SexyGeniusGirl,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:49:04 2015 UTC,"A while ago, I tried the Feathers and the Betsey Johnson Stocking Stripe both in 30DD, and the bottom of the cups collapsed horribly and the underwire was sitting way below my IMF.  Unfortunately, I don't have pictures of those.  I guess I'll stay away from the Maddie, thanks.  I'm not sure of my shape but based on how the Feathers and the Stocking Stripe fit, I would say I'm not shallow?"
ABraThatFits,3bu6h8,SexyGeniusGirl,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:13:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah if you're getting collapsing the bottom of the cups in shallow bras, it suggests that you are too projected for them. The curvy Kate unlined bras might be a good match for you."
ABraThatFits,3bu6h8,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Fri Jul 3 05:25:12 2015 UTC,"It's possible that you've had more of a shape change than anything else. That's why all the Cleo wires seem so wide. I'd recommend trying some more Decos in 28E since you seem to like the style. The more closed on top ones like Deco Vibe should give you less gaping! I found I needed to size down in the regular Deco because of the very open top but could wear my usual cup volume in Deco Vibe.   I'm surprised you're getting as good of a fit in the Deco as you are, as I don't remember it having very much space for immediate projection. It doesn't slide down on you at all?"
ABraThatFits,3bu6h8,allhaileuphemia,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:16:42 2015 UTC,"I was surprised at the good Deco fit as well!  The wires don't slide down and when I take it off at the end of the day, the marks are right in my IMF and fit my breast pretty much perfectly.  I have a Freya Taylor in 32D that I plan to alter the band on, and it's definitely closed on top enough for me (I tested it by pinning the band smaller)."
ABraThatFits,3bu6h8,noys,2,Fri Jul 3 03:22:24 2015 UTC,"If your 28Es still fit (and the Deco in 28DD looks good to me), it seems to me that 28E might just be a better size for you than 28F? The wires will be narrower in the smaller cup size, you just need to make sure to buy ones with sufficient projection rather than shallow ones like the Patsy. My measurements originally gave me a 28E and now give me a 28F/FF according to the calculator, but narrow and projected 28Es still fit the best for me; I think the calculator overestimates because I am pendulous. I mention this just to say that you don't need to slavishly follow what the calculator says if something else works better.  That being said, if your 28Es do feel too small and you want to stick with 28F in the future, it's going to be difficult to find ones that are narrow and projected and also padded, since unlined bras usually have more projection (unlined Curvy Kate, Freya plunge balconies, and I believe Miss Mandalay). You can see if you can find the Masquerade Delphi and Capella, and maybe try the Just Peachy brand by Figleaves, but otherwise you might have to look into Polish bras."
ABraThatFits,3bu6h8,noys,2,Thu Jul 2 15:27:25 2015 UTC,Capella is too projected for OP. Other Masquerade/Panache Black molded bras maybe not.
ABraThatFits,3bu6h8,SexyGeniusGirl,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:13:54 2015 UTC,"The Masquerade Delphi is gorgeous!  I found a couple on ebay in 30DD, should I go ahead?  I feel like my boobs haven't gotten any bigger since I started wearing ABTF in 28E, thanks for the advice!"
ABraThatFits,3bu6h8,noys,2,Fri Jul 3 03:57:41 2015 UTC,"28F/30E are obviously too big volumes. Cleo Erin is too projected.  Try Masquerade halfcups, they'll be narrower. Curvy Kate halfcups are also worth a try, they tend to be narrow in your size, check cup widths on Bratabase."
ABraThatFits,3buc6j,jassykangaroo,3,Thu Jul 2 05:36:21 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind is that a lot of brands end at 38 band. In 38GG she could also try Panache Jasmine, Envy and Floris, Cleo Marcie and Lily/Erin. Extenders also help?"
ABraThatFits,3buc6j,noys,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:30:03 2015 UTC,"I think I want to start her off with a bra that fits less snug, and build her trust with that. She's 55 so a 38 is too tight for her to start off with after wearing a bra that's waaaay too loose for so long"
ABraThatFits,3buc6j,noys,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:19:26 2015 UTC,"A lot of 40 band bras stretch to 41-42"" though, and a number of 38 band bras stretch to 39-40"".  38GG Envy, 38DD Floris (the only measured 38 band one), 38GG Marcie, 38GG Lily."
ABraThatFits,3buc6j,Goddess_Keira,2,Thu Jul 2 21:37:59 2015 UTC,"It sounds like her shape is similar to yours, and your sizes are fairly close too so bras that work for you should also work for her. Caitlyn is a good bet for her because it's slightly more projected than Kayla. Elomi Rita is another good one to try. Seeing as your Sculptresse was close on her, she might wear that bra in 42FF."
ABraThatFits,3buc6j,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:35:31 2015 UTC,"Really? I don't consider myself pendulous at all? Anywho, I messed up and typed that my sculptress was a 44ff, when it's actually a 46ff. Sorry! She also wants wireless options, and I can't blame her, it's hard to start trusting bras when you've been wearing the wrong size forever! I am open to goddess options as well as elomi. Anything that is extremely comfortable, won't stab her in the armpits, and fits her shape and projection. I would love to know all of the bras that will work best for her-wireless or not-just to have a good reference. Thank you for your constant help!"
ABraThatFits,3buc6j,Goddess_Keira,3,Thu Jul 2 06:46:36 2015 UTC,"Hi! Sorry I misinterpreted there. However, the bras I mentioned do generally work well for pendulous breasts also, so she could still consider them.  And if she wants wireless, Caitlyn comes in a wireless version! As does Goddess Keira. Goddess actually has a few wireless bras. Remember when fitting wireless that the gore won't tack bcause there are no wires to make it tack, and similarly wire width isn't an issue per se. So, you want to make sure that all breast tissue is fitting comfortably into the cups with no quadbood, and that the band under the bra is resting fully on the chest with no breast tissue escaping underneath. She should be able to raise her arms high and not have the band ride up over her breasts or have breast tissue falling out.  Since your mom doesn't like tight bras, and this is a change for her, I would absolutely not recommend trying a 38 band to start. I'm rather wondering if she might even prefer to sister size up one more time into 42FF. Later, she may come to want a more snug band. Also the calculator may have overestimated cup size for her a bit, but seeing as you say she fits fairly well into your 46FF bras, that would sister-size to 40H (which will be big in the cups for her), so maybe 40G will turn out to be correct.  Elila and Glamorise are other companies that make wire-free bras in larger band and cup sizes. They're U.S. sizing and I think both use the same general sizing scheme as Goddess, which you're already familiar with. Sorry I haven't time to look up specific options right now."
ABraThatFits,3buc6j,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:45:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I do have one more question however sorry! I tried a 40G for cacique I had bought for myself before on my mom, and the band fit nicely, but the cup was not filled up all the way on her. I was an everyday balconette style, so do you think I should size down one cup? Or is it because LB bras are weirdly sized?"
ABraThatFits,3buc6j,t_maia,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:17:43 2015 UTC,"Well, LB bras are US sized but they use a different scheme from Goddess. Their F is equivalent to UK F, I believe, then G = UK FF and they stop at H cup which is a UK G. So what you have there is basically a UK 40FF.   I'm not sure she would want to size down in the cup. You said she is pendulous and FoB--I think what is happening here (and common in her age range) is that she hasn't much upper fullness to fill out the top of cups. I am the same and always have to contend with this kind of a gap, even in the proper cup size. Size down too much, and you'll have spillage. However, if it's convenient to compare this size with next cup size down, she can try it to see which feels better. Otherwise, if she like that bra and feels good in it, no reason she shouldn't wear it instead of it collecting dust in your drawer. :) LB bras have nicely stretchy bands so it should feel comfy to her in that respect.   What I have found for myself (and I'm in your mom's age range) is that balconettes tend not to work so well for me, for that reason. I prefer center-pull straps, like on your Kayla--the gap is still there, but it doesn't show as much on me and I feel more supported."

ABraThatFits,3bt3bt,Mistress_Marbles,2,Thu Jul 2 00:40:53 2015 UTC,"Since you think you're full-on-bottom, I'd suggest starting with Cleo Lucy or Cleo Kali, /u/bamdaraddness. There are also a few other suggestions for FOB breasts here."

ABraThatFits,3bt3bt,Prettyncharmuese,2,Wed Jul 1 23:31:25 2015 UTC,"If you are in the US, order from Amazon or Nordstrom online. You want a shop with free shipping and free returns.

ABraThatFits,3bt3bt,t_maia,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:09:32 2015 UTC,"Shallow is a breast shape, and by definition has a very broad root (very shallow breasts will have a tall and wide root) like a pyramid.  It's not unknown for shallow boobs to be pendulous but they don't usually go together, pendulous boobs will normally be more on the projected end of the scale, with a narrower or shorter (or both) root.  If you're shallow then FOB will be way less relevant and you should look for shallow shaped bras, if you're more projected and pendulous then you'll want to focus on that FOB.  However, be aware that when standing lots of boobs look FOB because of gravity, but it's all about where your tissue is, FOB has more tissue below the nipple.  If you lean forwards 90 degrees FOB boobs will have the nipples pointing towards your head, even would be straight to the floor and FOT is towards your feet."

Lana is a similar cut to Marcie, so I think it might be shaped for someone more full on top for you, or possibly it may be too shallow or too small, causing the weird shape issues. Not sure about Maya, but it may also be a FOT bra.  Kali is a definitely full on bottom bra. Could you explain how you feel it should have more coverage? Is your nipple at the seams, or somewhere else?  No idea about the Freyas, sorry, although I think most of the Freya plunges are supposed to suit full on bottom and narrow-rooted.   I'm not sure we can learn anything from the Curvy Kate because it was just plain too big."

I wonder if it isn't projected enough... it doesn't seem to provide much lift. It just kind of cups my boobs where they hang"
ABraThatFits,3btr5y,Goddess_Keira,2,Thu Jul 2 03:31:10 2015 UTC,"To be honest, you seem to be kind of all over the place here, going off of this and your last post. It seems like you're mostly striking out with the Cleo bras, as Lily in 34F and 34FF hasn't worked for you, and Kali sounds like it should fit but you don't feel good in it, so that's not good.    36e cleo lana.... I really love how comfortable this bra is, it's a  loose at the top    So it sounds like you don't have enough top fullness for this bra, but have you tried it under clothes? It sounds as though you like the fit of it despite the looseness. Also, you're finding 34 bands in Cleo to be tight. If you got a good price on this bra, and it feels good and looks good under clothes, I'd say keep it. It's not perfect, but it might be good enough for a start, especially if it fits better than other bras you're currently wearing.  It sounds like you could be getting close with the some of the Freyas. You thought that the Firecracker you tried in 34E might have fit if it had been one cup size larger. Try it in 34F. The Enchanted 32FF fit well in the cups but very tight in the band. Try it in 34F as well. If you have enough time before the return deadline, hang on to the 32FF (keep the tags on, obviously, and don't actually wear it) and compare how it fits to the 34F. See which is better, and if you think either of them is good enough to keep.  You could also consider some Panache bras that have stretch lace up top to control that gapping. I would suggest Panache Andorra and/or Panache Envy in 34F. You also might have luck with Fantasie Susanna in 34F. However, I wouldn't try all of these suggestions at once. Either see if it can work with the Freyas in a different size, or move on to something different. I'd be inclined to try it with the Freyas first, though, because it sounds like you may be close on those."
ABraThatFits,3btr5y,M_tridactyla,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:18:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Lily and I have had problems. The 34ff was in the parrot print so I wonder if that had something to do with how uncomfortable it was since different colors fit differently.   I really like the Cleos but I'm wondering if the issues I'm having are due to the bands being too tight? Or in Kalis case, maybe not enough protection at the bottom...I find that I need quite a bit.   I'm curious if you might know why I'm getting wrinkling in some if the brass in the areas that I mentioned."
ABraThatFits,3btr5y,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:24:12 2015 UTC,"Wrinkling at the bottom of the cups can be caused by not enough projection-- the breast pushes up into a deeper part of the cup and the empty bottom gets shrugged down into wrinkles.  It could also be caused by too narrow cups, but if you're not having that problem with Kali or the Freyas, it's probably not width related."
ABraThatFits,3btr5y,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:43:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it only happened with the Lily.  The Lily seems to have narrower wires than all of the others.  I think I'm going to give up on that bra and focus in finding a good fit with Kali."
ABraThatFits,3btr5y,RevelationInFit,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:57:13 2015 UTC,"Hi. Sorry, but I'm not sure why you're having the wrinkling. It could be lack of immediate projection, or it could be that you need to lift up the underwire and make sure that your breasts are fully into the cup. Sometimes the fabric bunches a bit from the inside and you can hold the cup with one hand at the top edge, and slip a finger of the opposite hand into the cup to smooth out the wrinkles.  The different fabrics in Lily might well have something to do with the issues you've experienced. Finally sometimes minor wrinkles are not significant if the bra fits well otherwise and is comfortable."
ABraThatFits,3bsu84,asymmetricalknockers,3,Wed Jul 1 21:32:11 2015 UTC,"34H/HH would be where I'd start, and I'd probably go right for a bra that tends to be roomy, such as Cleo Marcie or Panache Jasmine/Envy.   I would highly recommend, whatever bras you do end up trying, plan on ordering both a 34H and 34HH (and possibly 34J) in each bra. Amazon is a great resource to be able to do this, with free shipping and returns on Prime Eligible bras. Having the two sizes to compare will help you narrow down your shape/size characteristics much faster than just trying one size in a bunch of different bras."

My roots and projection are similar, but I have less asymmetry, so I can't give good advice on that.  I think that bras with stretchy lace on the upper part of the cup are definitely a good choice for you, though. With moderate projection, Panache envy would be my first thought over Jasmine, which is more projected, but both are worth trying."
ABraThatFits,3bsu84,gunnapackofsammiches,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:04:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I usually avoid bras with lace as they tend to give the torpedo boob look (on me).

ABraThatFits,3bsu84,joanna70,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:32:15 2015 UTC,"The stretch lace on the Jasmine / Envy practically have a cult following for how stretchy and comfortable they are.

ABraThatFits,3bsu84,joanna70,2,Thu Jul 2 16:59:46 2015 UTC,"Make sure you always swoop and scoop all your tissue into the cups, you shouldn't have to tuck anything back in, rather the opposite :).  Definitely fit the larger breast.  Do you know your shape ie FOT/FOB/even?  The calculator mostly overestimates in your size range, if you swoop and scoop can you guess how many cup sizes too small your current bra is?  Your measurements suggest possible sizes of 34F (if we take the smallest measurement and the often used compensation of going down two cupsizes in this range) to 34J but I'd say 34GG/H is most likely."
ABraThatFits,3bttih,cms_2259,6,Thu Jul 2 02:28:29 2015 UTC,"34DD and 34E (commonly labelled as DDD in many US brands) sounds about right to start with. 40""-34""=6"", where each 1"" is 1 cup size: 34 A-B-C-D-DD-DDD/E. Although measurements are just a starting point.  Shallow boobs, like you say yours are, have their tissue spread out over a larger area on the chest and they can appear smaller for that reason (aka 'stealth boobs'). That's in contrast to people like me who has their breast tissue concentrated in one smaller area, so they stick out a lot and look bigger than shallow boobs.  That is why finding a shape match is very important when bra shopping. Trying on a bra that isn't the right shape can look very incorrect and even feel painful in some cases. A 34DD/E bra that compliments your shape shouldn't appear to be too huge once put on properly. There should be a list of some bras you could try in the shallow guide."
ABraThatFits,3bttih,SmellsLikeDogBuns,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:44:35 2015 UTC,Thanks for your response. Is padding just kind of up to preference or do they also mention it somewhere in the shape guide? I've always relied on pushups.
ABraThatFits,3bttih,joanna70,3,Thu Jul 2 02:55:12 2015 UTC,"In your right size and shape you'll find you have much more of the shape you were trying to achieve with push ups, without needing the push up!  Though most shallow bras are indeed padded/lined.  Push up padding, especially where it makes the cup anything other than a smooth curve on the inside, is thought to soften breast tissue and make it harder to get a well fitting bra, so best left for special occasions etc."
ABraThatFits,3bttih,SmellsLikeDogBuns,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:47:46 2015 UTC,"It is mostly up to preference, but many of the options on there should have some padding or lining in them. Padded/molded bras don't tend to work well with projected breasts, so you will have more options."
ABraThatFits,3bttih,rainydayseveryday,2,Thu Jul 2 03:06:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 34DD and 34E/DDD, DDD is probably more likely. they look about right from your measurements. You're in luck, VS carries your size still, if you have the shape for it. You should probably look into that. I'm still confused on mine so maybe try on some bras that will give you an idea of it if it confuses you.  I used to be a 34B, but the bras kind of just wiggled their way down because they wouldn't actually fit my boobs inside of them. if they didn't wiggle their way down, they just sat on top of my boobs, pancaking them and hurting me all day. I assume you're having the same experience, breast tissue is oozing out somewhere, because you have more volume than i do.   edit: as smellslikedogbuns said, stealth boobs. You're not necessarily shallow though, but since you're in a cup size that's such a low volume, it's more probable. You might have a lot of breast tissue under your armpits (many just mistake this as fat) and on a large area on your chest"
ABraThatFits,3bttih,-tallywa-,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:09:08 2015 UTC,"just noticed it is bunching around my armpits quite a bit. since we seem to be in a similar situation have you found a bra that has worked? a lot of the suggestions I have found are not american brands or are online. just told my mom about this and she is not convinced, she was like I am only a D (she has really large boobs) there's no way you are a DDD...so this is still unreal."
ABraThatFits,3bttih,-tallywa-,7,Thu Jul 2 03:16:02 2015 UTC,"Your mom is probably not in the best size either. If she has rather large breasts and she's currently wearing D cups, she probably needs closer to a FF+ cup on a smaller band.  We do recommend a lot of UK brands here because they have the better size ranges and often better quality. Depending on where you are exactly we can probably find you a place to try these bras on in person - even tho a lot of us do shop online your size shouldn't be too difficult to find in a brick and mortar store."
ABraThatFits,3bttih,-tallywa-,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:38:22 2015 UTC,I plan on going to try some various bras on tomorrow probably at like jc Penney or Macy's or somewhere like that since I'm in the states. Maybe Victoria's Secret.  Also based on the picture I posted do you still believe the size would be accurate? Thanks!
ABraThatFits,3bttih,hurrrrrmione,2,Thu Jul 2 04:45:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly your pictures aren't a great angle and pictures of old bras really aren't that helpful. Measurements aren't 100% perfect all of the time but they do provide a pretty good starting size and I see no reason to doubt that bras in that size with the right shape would work for you  None of the stores you listed are super great in terms of size and brand selection. VS doesn't always go up to DDD in store, and if you do go in there please don't let their associates measure you - their methods do not provide a truly supportive size. Penney's and Macy's may or may not carry that size depending on the location and don't necessarily carry a lot of the brands we recommend here. Do you have a Nordstrom nearby? In terms of selection (and accuracy of measuring methods) they are the best department store in the US. Like I said, if you can be more specific about your location we can probably find some good options for you to look in store."
ABraThatFits,3bttih,MutantToenail,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:55:59 2015 UTC,"I'm in southeast Idaho. The closest nordstroms would probably be salt lake or Boise. I'm not aware of one closer than that. Would a Dillard's or lane Bryant's cacique be sufficient? Those are both only an hour from me in Idaho falls, ID."
ABraThatFits,3bttih,eageratbest,2,Thu Jul 2 05:07:17 2015 UTC,Out of all of those Dillard's would be the best bet. It looks like there's also two specialty stores in the same city so you could check those out as well - although it looks like they may use less accurate fitting methods so just be careful of that and try to insist on trying your measured size.
ABraThatFits,3bttih,eageratbest,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:18:31 2015 UTC,Lane Bryant doesn't have 34 bands.   Try checking the offline retailer list for stores in your area

You could also google bra boutiques in your area. Or try Amazon, they have tons of stufff with free shipping/returns."

ABraThatFits,3btnvs,hurrrrrmione,2,Thu Jul 2 02:39:10 2015 UTC,"Could you try loosening the straps and see how that feels and fits? The band should be level - in the pictures, it's sitting higher across your back than in front."
ABraThatFits,3btnvs,ericazibby,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:44:20 2015 UTC,It's tough to see the wire and whether it's sitting in your IMF from the photos but aside from that it looks like a good fit. I'm a big chantelle fan so I'm glad you found one you like.
ABraThatFits,3bt3n2,being_in_the_world,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:43:35 2015 UTC,That bra is gorgeous. Sigh. If it were my size (which I'm not sure of in Polish brands but I'm a 34 FF/G in UK) I'd snatch it up in heartbeat. I love that projection!
ABraThatFits,3bt3n2,ericazibby,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:10:53 2015 UTC,I think the S cut in particular can be a bit weird in sizing due to the fabrics used. Or so that's what I've gathered while trying to find out how the sizing on it runs compared to other EM cuts.
ABraThatFits,3bt3n2,LadyVerene,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:04:39 2015 UTC,What's the fabric? Looks like stretch lace.
ABraThatFits,3bt3n2,ericazibby,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:45:03 2015 UTC,"I've no idea; I haven't tried the SM cut yet. But I know that some use fabrics that are very heavy on embroidery and hence don't have as much stretch to them as other SM bras.   Looking at the Wrozka closeups on EM's site it could be stretch lace, maybe not. It's hard to tell. But compare that to a bra like Fiolecik or Summer Time, which are covered in intricate embroidery - there's no way the two bras will fit the same. The other SM that the OP tried, Malinka, is also heavy on embroidery."
ABraThatFits,3bt3n2,LadyVerene,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:14:53 2015 UTC,That makes total sense. Stretch lace will always have a different fit than the embroidered lace that has very little give.

ABraThatFits,3br6x2,anonphilia,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:07:03 2015 UTC,"It's weird, but I feel like Lucy fits perfectly other than the gore digging in. No other issues whatsoever. I will definitely try bending the gore, I think I was just afraid to tamper with such an expensive bra!"

Freya/Fantasie unlined plunges would be my next stop. There's a million of them (or it feels that way, at least), bratabase.com will be your friend as you decide which ones to try. They're almost all well suited to FOB shapes, but with a 1/6, maybe try starting with an Erin or a Carolyn plunge based cut."
ABraThatFits,3br6x2,lilylizlane,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:58:21 2015 UTC,"Marcie and Lucy both dug into my sternum as well back in the day. No rhyme or reason to it in my case. Not sitting on breast tissue, etc. Just a combination of the sturdiness of the underwires and the angle at which the underwires were held by the band tension."

ABraThatFits,3bswmo,vonzyy,6,Wed Jul 1 21:49:07 2015 UTC,FYI - You can search by strap width on bratabase.
ABraThatFits,3bswmo,buymeflowers,5,Thu Jul 2 01:21:50 2015 UTC,You could always get a convertible bra like the Deco Shape and then clip on cute little straps from the mall?
ABraThatFits,3bswmo,MutantToenail,4,Thu Jul 2 04:54:32 2015 UTC,"Cleos usually have pretty, narrow straps if one of the shapes works for you."

It will depend on whether the shapes of these bras suit you though, in your size those two bras are classic shallow to FOT half cups. And I agree with you, though I don't mind thick straps in the winter, come summer I am quite happy with thinner straps at 30G-32G."

ABraThatFits,3bswmo,Bonfire_,3,Wed Jul 1 22:44:57 2015 UTC,Cleos. They're aimed at a younger crowd so the straps are much less heavy duty.
ABraThatFits,3bswmo,lauracb,2,Thu Jul 2 16:41:27 2015 UTC,I agree with the Cleo recommendations. The straps on my 30GG Kali bras are still peanuts compared to the monstrosities I wore once in a blue moon back in high school.
ABraThatFits,3br2gw,nidena,9,Wed Jul 1 13:40:20 2015 UTC,"After I found here, I was only able to afford one bra to try. Luckily it fit me, but that also meant that I only had one fitting bra to wear until I was able to order more (the next month). Having to swap it out for my old, poorly-fitting bras so I could wash it was horrible.   I have a decent bra collection now - not as huge as some other members on here, but six unlined bras and one padded bra that are great fits, and another couple unlined bras and three padded bras that are varying degrees of close fits means I do have a good amount of variety to choose from, which I never had before. And, not only do they fit me and are way more comfortable than my old bras, they're all way prettier.   So, basically, I used to be really frustrated. Now I'm pretty happy."
ABraThatFits,3br2gw,LadyVerene,7,Wed Jul 1 14:15:46 2015 UTC,"It gets worse when you have some bras that fit, and some old ones. I wound up spending a lot more than I intended to right  away, because I couldn't bear going from abtf to  one that didn't"
ABraThatFits,3br2gw,GaarDnous,6,Wed Jul 1 14:23:34 2015 UTC,"The six months between when I found this place and when I acquired my full rotation of fitting bras was really hard. Especially the beginning, when I was still trying to figure things out and work up the courage to order. I'm not sure which was worse - the suckiness of having to wear ill-fitting bras every day or the suckiness of wearing ill-fitting bras half the time after wearing a well-fitting bra the day before.   Now those bras are rightfully banished to a tangled ball in the back of my underwear drawer. I'm planning to donate them at some point as there's a Soma store right down the street from my work and they send old bras to women's shelters. I just have to be in the area when they're open!"
ABraThatFits,3br2gw,crazymusicalgenius96,5,Wed Jul 1 14:31:30 2015 UTC,"I was wearing a 42C ( severe gynecomastia). Being a guy, I was way to embarrassed to even consider a fitting. I was told to try the +4 method. Years go by, society changes and somethings begin to be accepted and I went for a professional fitting. I walked in wearing a 42B and walked out of the boutique wearing a 38D. I've had continued growth and lost weight. Now I wear a 36G. It was after I came to ABTF that I became aware that volume is only one aspect. Shape, placement, FOB, and FOR ect....All of the ladies here have been very understanding and have offered great,  sound advice for all of my questions."

ABraThatFits,3br2gw,basylica,5,Wed Jul 1 16:43:20 2015 UTC,I found size after trial and error and amassed a good collection. Size 30hh. Lost weight (yay) and things shrunk (boo) and band was first. Bought several 28Js that literally fit a minute and then boobs shrank too. Then I was faced with serious lack of inventory when it came to reduced price cleos which are my goto.  Finally got some 28hs rolling and so help me....
ABraThatFits,3br2gw,ambrdst,3,Wed Jul 1 15:08:56 2015 UTC,"My problem is a little different than the one you describe, but I've been wanting to vent for a long time so I'll share. I have a couple bras that fit okay, but I am always disappointed when I come to this sub and see pretty, well fitted bras. I don't have a single unlined bra that fits me. I can't figure out my shape (all the breasts in the shallow/projected spectrum look pretty much the same to me). I read everything here (I've also asked for advice) and I can't find pretty, affordable bras that fit. I dream of having some longlines or bras that give me a more natural pointy shape than the molded style I'm stuck with. Whenever I put on the bras that fit me I get a little sad."
ABraThatFits,3br2gw,crazymusicalgenius96,3,Wed Jul 1 15:05:23 2015 UTC,"If you're shallow, then unlined half cups are a literal godsend. Fantasie Allegra and Freya Starlet will be the two that are most accessible, though if you look on Ebay you might be able to find Fauve Chloe. Comexim makes nice unlined half cups too but I have no idea how projected they are. The designs on both Allegra and Starlet are gorgeous in their own way, as Starlet is very modern and new territory for a full-bust brand while Allegra is more classic.   If you're naturally a little conical, then you might also like the Freya Lauren half cups and clones. They're lined, but still have seams. I find my Freya Daydreamer gives me the most perfect mix of roundness and pointiness, it's fantastic. However, depending on how shallow you are, they may be a bit too projected for you."
ABraThatFits,3br2gw,ambrdst,3,Wed Jul 1 16:35:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the response. I've heard ""try half cups!"" but then no mentions of which ones to look for, so your suggestions are much appreciated. I've tried the Freya Patsy before since it's a half cup, and it had too much upper fullness. I have a pretty swoopy shape but noticeable tissue higher up while laying down. (When I try bras with a horizontal seam, it's like I could cut out the top portion and have a well fitting bra). After reading your comment I'm starting to think ""conical"" is the descriptor I've been missing, which is quite helpful!"
ABraThatFits,3br2gw,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Wed Jul 1 17:12:15 2015 UTC,"Ooh, then definitely try the Freya Lauren! It's got an extra top panel making it more closed on top, but not super closed on top like Cleo Lucy, which sounds like what you've been missing from the vertical seam half cups.   I'd say Fantasie Allegra is slightly more closed on top than Freya Starlet, but Fantasie starts at 30 bands."

I have my fitting booked and a bit of money saved.   It's not cheap so I might only end up with one bra but it will be absolutely amazing to have a bra that actually fits me, the first in 5+ years, probably the first in my life if we're being honest. I'm hoping to find a bikini too so I can save up and have a new one this summer. I might be a bit pale and a bit saggy and a bit wobbly but I'm gonna be smokin' hot ;)"

I'm obsessed with bras and thankfully made dome money selling to get them in my right size and it's hard and makes you a little impatient to find the right bra for yourself but keep an eye out on r/braswap! Honestly, I've gotten all my current bras there. Most new and at a fair price. Im so happy it's a thing! Seriously keep your eye out! And idk about you but my extra spending budget goes straight to lingerie for me. I haven't found any other place that can give me a great deal and without me feeling guilty about spending if it doesn't work out. So far it's only happened twice but thankfully I've found people to gladly pass it down to. Also, you can find out what styles work for you! I've found that I've had no problem with lace ones in my size. Padded moulded bras don't usually work out for me because I'm bottom heavy.

There are TONS of bras but I've seen only a few styles consistently recommended on here.  I've tried some of them.

Looking at my old bras now I can't see how I ever thought they fit. But I'm also frustrated because I like the shape of my boobs better (despite the issues) in my old bras than in the correctly sized ones I've tried."
ABraThatFits,3bql4t,ABTFThrowayay,58,Wed Jul 1 10:17:47 2015 UTC,"First off, the size of your breasts has not changed at all. They were the same size yesterday when you were still stuffing them into 38Fs,  thinking this is your size.    What you are experiencing is size sticker shock. Please take a deep breath and stop panicking. You were awesome yesterday and you are awesome today, boobs and all. Nothing changed.   A lot of the problems you describe can be solved by bras and swimwear in the correct size. From your posts is sounds like you are not really unhappy about your breasts themselves, but rather unhappy about how clothes fit you.   Think hard about this. Reduction is a big step, you are undergoing surgery with all the risks and pain. (I broke my leg and had to get surgery and metal rods inserted, after this experience there is no freaking chance in hell I am letting a surgeon near me unless it is absolutely necessary. That pain is no joke.)   If after you got a well-fitting bra you still want a reduction, go for it.  But try good bras first. They really really help. (Been there, done that.)  Regarding size, could you please post your measurments? The calculator tends to overestimate in larger band and cupsizes."
ABraThatFits,3bql4t,t_maia,4,Wed Jul 1 11:41:24 2015 UTC,"Also, the scarring from a reduction is unsightly and may weigh in on her opinion of herself in other ways."
ABraThatFits,3bql4t,TerrorEyzs,13,Wed Jul 1 15:46:22 2015 UTC,"Most women who have had a reduction don't find the scarring to be ""unsightly"". It's there, of course, but it fades and all the women I know who have had a reduction (and personal accounts I've read) say that the scarring hasn't affected them and if anything, it's just the expected trade-off for the relief of having smaller breasts that don't cause them physical and emotional pain. Many/most say that they find their scars to be minimally noticeable (after full healing and fading), and don't relate any issues with their SO's or new partners."
ABraThatFits,3bql4t,Goddess_Keira,3,Wed Jul 1 16:39:28 2015 UTC,Well that is awesome to hear! The 3 women I've known that had it done had a completely opposite experience.
ABraThatFits,3bql4t,TerrorEyzs,4,Wed Jul 1 16:50:58 2015 UTC,"That is too bad...of course nothing is 100%. Are they by any chance still within the first months, or even the first year of healing? Things change quite a bit over that time. Even well after a year, scars can and do continue to fade.  If, by chance, the women you know truly had unusually bad scarring, out of the normal range of experience (as opposed to feeling great distress about normal scarring), it may be worth their while to get an independent medical opinion about their scarring."
ABraThatFits,3bql4t,Goddess_Keira,0,Wed Jul 1 17:00:33 2015 UTC,Hmm I'll talk to them about it. That's a great idea. And no these were all done 10+ years ago.

You have so many fantastic options in the UK, I'm sure we'll be able to help.   Edit-- For example, here is a bikini top in a 40JJ for Â£15! Of course, it's not guarenteed to fit, but just as an example of what is available to you!"
ABraThatFits,3bql4t,dwellondreams,13,Wed Jul 1 13:15:13 2015 UTC,"Your breasts are the same they were before. They did not change at all. I went from wearing a 38D to 36HH, but my boobs didn't change at all - it was simply the size I was wearing. You are not your bra size.  Also, as others have noted, the bra size calculator on here is known to overestimate, especially in larger sizes. If you can post the measurements you entered in there, we can help with getting a more accurate estimate."
ABraThatFits,3bql4t,LadyVerene,8,Wed Jul 1 14:19:25 2015 UTC,"This is a very personal decision, but I think you need to look at how you feel about your breasts and how they're affecting your life, not just this new size. It's true that your breasts didn't change in the moment that you measured them. It's true that 40JJ is probably an overestimate of the size that you need. It's true that a better fitting bra will feel much better than an ill-fitting one.  However. It still remains that your boobs are making you miserable, and reduction is a valid option. I'm not campaigning for reduction here, but if you've been seriously considering this for years, I think you owe it to yourself to keep researching it and look into having a consultation.   I haven't had a reduction myself, but of all the research I've done and stories I've heard, the fears you have are extremely common. It's highly unlikely that your (hypothetically) reduced boobs will be so small that you'll be disproportionate. While no good surgeon will guarantee a size, they strive to make the results proportionate to the person. They should also listen to your input. There can be limits to how much tissue they feel that they can safely remove and still get a pleasing result.  TL;DR: Keep on doing your research and when you're ready, have a consultation or even a few, because you want to be comfortable with your surgeon if you do proceed. Get new bras that fit, because if nothing else you'll feel better in the meantime and you'll know what size you should be wearing to keep the girls reigned in."

Perhaps if we can help you find your right size for now, it might help you feel better in the short term while you think through the implications of a reduction.  Also in the short term, did you know that most full bust bra manufacturers do bikinis where you buy the bottoms separately? This way, you could get bikini bottoms that fit well and a bikini top that also fits and is supportive."
ABraThatFits,3bql4t,t_maia,4,Wed Jul 1 10:54:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks, you must have some of the same problems as I?  I actually used that calculator to get the results, haha! It did say J/JJ, cos it wasn't a whole number, so there is still hope. It doesn't seem real, but there you are. I wish it wasn't real.   I have looked at other manufacturers, but unfortunately I'm a uni student and cannot afford to spend Â£100 on a bikini :'( there are some gorgeous ones out there though!!  Have you ever considered reduction?"
ABraThatFits,3bql4t,noys,15,Wed Jul 1 11:05:55 2015 UTC,"Are you in the UK? Because you are using pounds. If yes, Bravissimo would be a good place to check out. They sell swimsuits in 38K (sistersize to 40JJ) for around 45 pounds. Only their sports swimsuits are above 50 pounds."
ABraThatFits,3bql4t,spugzcat,12,Wed Jul 1 11:46:58 2015 UTC,"The calculator may be overestimating a bit, do you mind sharing your measurements?"
ABraThatFits,3bql4t,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:39:45 2015 UTC,I'm by no means a lurker but is it possible you didn't measure correctly? I just say that as I'm a UK 16 and I wear a 36 band. I know sizes do vary but this seems a little off?   I would like to add that I don't think you should consider yourself large. I'm by no means thin or even average build but I certainly wouldn't consider myself large!
ABraThatFits,3bql4t,EmmaInFrance,4,Wed Jul 1 17:31:57 2015 UTC,"Dress size doesn't necessarily correlate with band size, nor do height or weight. Bone structure and how you carry weight in your ribcage are really the most important factors."
ABraThatFits,3bql4t,LadyVerene,4,Wed Jul 1 19:38:18 2015 UTC,"That is true but a 40"" band size doesn't seem right at all for a UK size 14-16. A UK size 18 has a 40"" overbust measurement."
ABraThatFits,3bql4t,EmmaInFrance,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:04:25 2015 UTC,"Unless they're talking about pants sizes, not dress sizes.  I know what my pants size is and that's what I use when I say I'm a size whatever; I don't have the first clue what my dress size is because I don't ever wear dresses."
ABraThatFits,3bql4t,spugzcat,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:29:11 2015 UTC,"We Brits don't tend to differentiate, other than saying something like ""I wear a 16 on top but a 14 on the bottom""."
ABraThatFits,3bql4t,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:53:57 2015 UTC,Hmm that's really interesting thank you! I'd have thought that a 16 (for example) would correlate to x inches at certain points. Although it's certainly true that one shops 16 is not another's!
ABraThatFits,3bql4t,fluffykittie,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:24:42 2015 UTC,"Well it does if you're measuring, and when manufacturers make clothing. But nobody measures themselves before heading out to buy some jeans. Constantly evolving clothing styles, fabric choices by mass producers, ideal body types, and average size of women in a particular country are also going to make a difference in how a particular size fits and even what measurement correspond to a particular size over time. I can fit well and look good in a size medium in a stretchy, cotton-blend tanktop, but I need to wear a size large or extra-large in order to get a shirt in a non-stretchy fabric to fit over my breasts. There's also the issue of mass produced sizes necessitating average measurements. I have to buy a certain size jeans to fit my hips and thighs, but most jeans in that size are too long for me because I have short legs."

ABraThatFits,3bql4t,fluffykittie,4,Wed Jul 1 13:09:19 2015 UTC,"While this sounds good in theory, I actually went up two cup sizes when I lost 25 lb.  The hell??"

ABraThatFits,3bql4t,scatteringashes,2,Wed Jul 1 15:19:13 2015 UTC,"Did they get bigger or just stayed the same? She could try while deciding the reduction though since all of us are different.

ABraThatFits,3brv8q,mini_sweet,9,Wed Jul 1 17:21:29 2015 UTC,"Because you have very little ""squish"", and not a super large cup size, you may find yourself more comfortable starting out with a 30DD.  Check out our shape guide and let us know what shapes seem right to you:   projected, shallow, or in the middle? full on top (FOT), full on bottom (FOB), or even? narrow, wide, or average roots?

I had all those problems you are experiencing as well, and I can promise you that a tighter band/larger cup will definitely help remedy them. I would recommend looking at the shape guide. knowing your shape will help you figure out what bras to try. if you have any questions I will do my best to answer!!"
ABraThatFits,3brv8q,meowington5,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:03:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much! I'm looking forward to new bras that actually fit!

I don't really exercise so a sports bra isn't super important to me. however. I do know that Panache, Freya, and shock absorber all make sports bras that are commonly recommended here. so if you are a better, more active person than I am, that might be something to look into!   edit: I guess I kinda read your question wrong haha oh well. I didn't change my compression sports bra size. I wore a size S before and continue to wear that. I think as long as your sports bras are comfy and hold your boobs in theyre fine."

ABraThatFits,3bs17w,M_tridactyla,3,Wed Jul 1 18:55:54 2015 UTC,"It works now!  That bra is too small, and possibly also a shape mismatch if it doesn't fit in 30DDD.  I think that at least the bottom of the cup is too shallow for you, which is why the wires sit too low."
ABraThatFits,3bs17w,tiggaren,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:59:47 2015 UTC,"I'm still confused on this shallow thing.   I think it was said that my breasts are basically too projected for moulded bras, but I don't see how that could be. :/.  I've read the shallow guide many times, and looked at the pictures. Let me rephrase that. I understand what shallow breasts are- breasts that take up a large area on your chest. When I look at moulded/push-up bras, they all seem to have a shape to them. (A shape that I would describe as projected). But if people that are projected can't fit moulded bras, and people that are shallow can't fit moulded bras, who are they made for? :/"
ABraThatFits,3bs17w,M_tridactyla,3,Wed Jul 1 19:06:15 2015 UTC,"Bras can be a ton of different shapes; it all depends on their construction.  A bra can be too shallow or too projected for someone, as all breasts have varying degrees of shallowness/projectedness, of course.  However, overall, moulded bras are usually shallow--because of their construction (in particular I mean the ones with no seams, or ""t-shirt bras""), the foam simply can't make the shape and remain stable.  I think you need to try at least one cup size up, and make sure the underwires are in your inframammary fold (which can be almost impossible if the cup is too shallow in the bottom especially, which I think this one is)."
ABraThatFits,3bs17w,tiggaren,2,Wed Jul 1 20:07:31 2015 UTC,"Bras (especially ones in common bra sizing) are like other mass-produced clothes. They're made to sort-of fit a lot of people, but rarely fit anyone perfectly, or even very well at all.  Molded bras are often very shallow at the bottom (where fabric joins the wire) because of the mechanics of the foam they're made of. A bra can even be too shallow for a person at the bottom, but too deep elsewhere, such as the apex (deepest part of the bra). This is an example of a shape mismatch."
ABraThatFits,3bs17w,M_tridactyla,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:19:40 2015 UTC,"Omg. That last part is how I feel about the DKNY bra that I have. The top part fits perfectly, there's space at the bottom between the wire and my breast, but I feel like it's too deep. Am I too new to sell the bra on bratabase?"
ABraThatFits,3bs17w,Saskia_C,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:42:11 2015 UTC,"For Bratabase, you just need to make sure you've added measurements and such for a few bras before trying to buy/sell.

ABraThatFits,3bqk2e,goodoldfreda,2,Wed Jul 1 18:24:21 2015 UTC,"For the wiki:  Buying Guide, subsection  What to buy  (Somebody please continue/contribute to this with suggestions for the smaller sizes with shallow shapes <3. I also welcome any suggestions you might have, I would especially be interested in info for 28/26/24 bandsizes.)  Just found out your size? Here is how to shop for it.   The size you got from the calculator is just a starting point. For about 50% of women the calculator is spot on, +/- one cupsize or one bandsize. For others there is more variation. You might need larger or smaller depending upon size, shape, firmness of tissue, root width and a gazillion other factors.  Only way to find out which size you need is to try on bras in several sizes.   To figure out your size, it is a good idea to order a few beginner bras. These are regular bras that run true to size and fit a wide range of women well, they also allow you to nail your size even if the fit is completely off. (You find a list at the bottom of the page.)  Order 1-3 beginner bras in 2-4 sizes. If you try a bra in 3 sizes and neither size works, you know it is the bra and not the size that is wrong. Trying a few bras that way helps you determine your bra size - if there is one size that is consistenly the best, that is your size.  Don't worry too much about breast shape at this point. One important disctintion is shallow /not shallow because it determines which beginner bras will suit you. But apart from that beginner bras are also meant to help you work out shape, not just size, so don't fret if you don't know at this stage.   Once you found your size, you can order more bras in that size.   Be prepared to order and return 25+ bras until you find ""the one"". For this reason it is important to order from a shop with free shipping and free returns initially, even if the bras costs more. It will save you money in the long run. In the US, Amazon and Nordstrom offer free shipping and free returns, in Canada Butterflycollection.ca.    Keep track of what you tried. It helps you work out what works and does not work. An account with Bratabase.com is great for this. Especially if you measure and enter the bras you order you quickly learn what you need. But you can also use pen and paper.   If you buy bras from ebay, braswap, zulily and other places where you cannot return them, research the bras before you commit yourself. Seach the ABTF subreddit, Bratabase, use search engines to find bra blogs with reviews of this bra. Buying bras cheap from places with no returns is a gamble, you can end up with a lot of bras that don't fit right that way and risk spending more money on 5 ill-fitting bras than one really good one.   When you are trying on things in a store, taking photos of the tags is quick and really useful. It also helps to take pictures of yourself in the bra. You don't have to show these photos to anybody, but they help you remember what you did not like about a certain bra several months later.   Many bra brands are made with a certain breastshape in mind. For this reason many women tend to get consistently good results with a certain brand and cut of that brand. It can also be that none of the bras of a certain brand work for you. Only way to find out is by trial and error and research.   Good beginner bras for larger cupsizes and more projected shapes:  Panache/Cleo:   Panache Andorra Panache Envy Panache Jasmine  Panache Tango II Balc. (works best in 32-42 GG/H/HH) Cleo Lucy/Kali (28-38 D-J) Cleo Marcie, Cleo Lily (28-38 D-J)   Andorra, Envy and Jasmine are based upon the same cut, Andorra fits almost everybody, Envy is a wider, more full-on-bottom shape, Jasmine is more projected and with less volume in the bottom, if one is close but no cigar one of the other two will usually be perfect.  For Cleo Marcie/Lily and Cleo Lucy similar applies. Marcie and Lily are based upon the same cut, Lucy is a different cut, but usually one of the three is a decent fit. Please also look up the other bras based upon Cleo George/Marcie and Cleo Alexa/Lily on bratabase.   Fantasie and Freya:   Fantasie Jana Side Support, Fantasie Lois Side Support Fantasie Elodie (UK 30-38 D-H, 40DD-FF) Freya Oh La La  Freya Rio (UK 28-38 D-H)   Note that above 32H/34GG/36G/38FF the wires of Freya and Fantasie become too soft for good support and get unstable. While some models are available up to UK 36K with Freya and UK 40K with Fantasie these bras work best in the E-GG range. If you find Freya/Fantasie a good fit yet need a larger size, consider switching out the wires for harder, more durable ones.   Curvy Kate:   Curvy Kate Princess  Curvy Kate Portia Curvy Kate Bardot Curvy Kate Dreamcatcher    Curvy Kate (especially older cuts like Princess) work best for a full-on-top 3+4 shape.  If you get a funny upside-down seven shape in Curvy Kate Princess, try some of the newer cuts like Dreamcatcher or the more full-on-bottom friendly Portia. If the problem persists, this brand is not for you.   Bras and brands with larger bandsizes:    Goddess Keira/Kayla/Adelaide (US 34 i-N, 36 DD-N) Goddess Alice, Goddess Clara (US 34-44 G-N, 46 G-M, 48 G-L) Elomi Caitlyn (UK 34F-K, 36-42DD-K, 44-46 DD-HH) Elomi Rita (UK 34 G-K, 36-40 E-K, 42HH, 44H, 46FF) Elila 2311 (US 36-46 DD-K) Elila 1305 (US 34-52 F-N, their 52N is the largest cupsize-bandsize combo bra you can buy that is not custom-made) Panache Sculptresse ChiChi (36-46 D-H, same cut as Panache Jasmine)    If you are in the UK, the EU or can get them cheap, Bravissimo housebrand and Gorgeous by Debenhams (the Debenhams housebrand) is really good. Sadly the shipping from the UK to the US and back makes ordering them impractical for many people in the US.   For cups above UK-K in bandsizes 28-40/42:  -Bravissimo Alana (up to 40L)   Bravissimo's other bra with the side support cut, whatever they named it this year bras by Ewa Michalak Enell (sports bra) custom size"

I have begun to derive far too much joy in their moments of, ""Oh my god, where has this bra been all of my life.""   That said, my roommate has breasts that confound the calculator -- but she's also the one of us who has the least trouble with bras. The calculator wants her in a 34FF, but every time she tries on the recommended sizes, the band is too tight and the cups too big. So, she's comfortable and happy in a 36DD, and I'm happy for her. <3 (Just confused.)  Also, I have to try a new bra size again this weekend, I think. My current bras had been giving me the sort of pain that indicates my band isn't being supportive enough. I remeasured, and both my band and bust measurements have changed a bit, so... In again, I guess."
ABraThatFits,3bqk2e,scatteringashes,3,Wed Jul 1 14:11:31 2015 UTC,"Could she have a large shallow shape? Underwires are too narrow, that makes the bra feel tight, breasts can't get into the cups?"

I had come here because I thought it would be great to figure out my ""ideal"" size so that I could buy nicer brands and be sure I was getting the best/right fit. I started out by ordering 2 styles in 3 sizes each, my calculated size and the two sister sizes and none of them worked.  I'm getting a new order today this time I ordered in a 36 band so we'll see how it goes, but thus far I've been really discouraged/frustrated by this experience because my $14 Target bra is more comfortable and looks better than any of the ones I've found since coming here."

(Not free returns, but you may be able to get that through Amazon.) It's US sized so you'd try a 34I. Potential issues are too-wide wires and that's the smallest it comes, but if it fits you it's a great bra at a reasonable price."

ABraThatFits,3bqk2e,LadyVerene,5,Thu Jul 2 21:43:45 2015 UTC,"The government pays for it. Proper amounts of vacation raise productivity. It's 4 weeks in Estonia as well, plus holidays like Christmas, New Year's Day, Labour Day, Independence Day."
ABraThatFits,3bqk2e,noys,5,Wed Jul 1 19:10:19 2015 UTC,"I'm jealous. I haven't had a vacation in over two years and that was only a long weekend.  The US model is more ""overwork people, give them no benefits, severely underpay them, and remind them they're replaceable"". It sucks. The last few places I worked at, you have to be full-time for over a year to be eligible for any vacation time, but it's only a week, actually getting full-time hours is difficult, and it's rare anyone ever stays a full year. Also understaffing which makes it very difficult to take time off anyway because there's no one to cover for you.  And that's not even touching stuff like how it is literally impossible to live off of the minimum wage but many jobs don't pay more than that, childcare being so expensive that it's frequently cheaper for women to stay at home instead of work, many jobs require a college degree for no reason at all and college is extremely expensive...  The US is a mess. Go 'Murrica! -_-"

I wear 36DDD/80E, and think that the 34 band would be far too tight (and afraid an extender wouldn't fix the issue). Is EM as projected and narrow as I can get? :("
ABraThatFits,3bqk2e,anonphilia,3,Mon Jul 6 13:52:10 2015 UTC,"If you are speaking strictly padded bras...  Mat Lingerie rigid cut. The rigid isn't super roomy right at the underwire but it's a really sturdy rigid padding that does a stellar job of lifting and manhandling even my breasts. No collapsing, no wrinkling, no wires shifting down. The semi-soft cut is similar but the top section is unlined, I haven't tried it yet. Mat Lingerie is around on Amazon and eBay (also check the UK ones).  Samanta A925 cut. Runs really roomy, size down at least a cup size. A922 is the unlined version. Absolutely amazing shape, think Cleo on steroids.  Gossard half padded cut. Expects a FoB breast with a short root, quite closed on top. The width in 32G is 5.5"" which is pretty insane! Gives a really retro shape."

I wouldn't consider the CHP from EM anything less than sturdy, but even my breasts cause the cups to tip forward and the band to ride up.  Not into the retro shape, so no go on the Gossard.  Will look into A925/922.  I'm open to softcups. I think my best fit so far has been BM style from Ewa.

If you and Ash cannot run quite so far as you used because of old wounds, then we will run less far together.   And so I am planning on getting the last part of that (""we will run less far together"") on my forearm. It has a lot of meaning for me - I was in an abusive relationship before I met my husband, and in the six years we've been together he's helped me recover from it a lot.  The idea came to me a few days ago to get that line as a tattoo and it was one of those moments of ""why the hell didn't I think of that YEARS ago?!"". So I'm getting it done this week. I live right by a really great tattoo studio, and I know most of the guys there from working right next to it, so I'm really excited to get it done.   Definitely!

It's one of the reasons I think I never let any man disgrace me and I am engaged to a man quite similar to my father, because my dad set that bar for me.

I went and visited their website, they stocked Chantelle, Passionata and many other brands I don't usually find around so easily.  So I decided to go visit this shop full of hope I could find something that fits so closeby. Once inside I asked to see what bras they had in stock and the girl working there was very nice and showed me a few. I chose four models to try on and specifically asked for a IIC (32C). She said she didn't have that cup size for one of the models and in front of me checked the tags of the other three and said ""These are Cs! Go on and try them!"". I happily went to the fitting room and started trying them on, when I immediately noticed something was wrong with them: I looked at the tags and they were all Bs. I started fuming, because she said in front of me they were C, I tried to calm down and asked for a bigger cup size, to which she came back and handed me three IIIBs (34B).   At that point I wasn't even sure if she was just plain ignorant of how the sizes work or just trying to make a sale at all costs, I think it was the latter seeing how she handed me B telling me they were C. Unfortunately I am quite shy when it comes to this kind of situations and I couldn't confront her, even just by saying ""If you didn't have any C you could have just told me"". So I just left saying they didn't fit. :("

ABraThatFits,3bqk2e,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:47:14 2015 UTC,Fit to the larger one and if there is a significant difference in boobs you can always use a chick breast to fill the cup out on the smaller side. I've heard unlined bras can accommodate different sizes better.
ABraThatFits,3bqk2e,joanna70,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:51:28 2015 UTC,"My breasts are approximately one cup size apart, and I didn't notice this until pretty recently when I tried on a bra that was a size too small for the bigger one, so if it's noticeable to other people you may have a larger difference than that. If you want to, you can remeasure holding the tape as if your breasts were the same size to better approximate the cup volume you need for the bigger one.  Keep in mind that your differently-sized breasts may also be different in shape. My smaller right breast is shallower, wider and significantly more FoB than my left breast, which is on the narrow side of average in width, average in projection, and even in fullness. So when you take a bra off, look at the wire marks on both sides to determine if it's a reasonable width for both!"
ABraThatFits,3bqk2e,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:05:11 2015 UTC,"Yep, my larger boob is more projected and sits slightly lower, my smaller one is wider and sits higher, which means underwires LOVE to sit too low on that side, bane of my life as my flared ribcage means it's unbearble.

ABraThatFits,3bqk2e,foxyillusion,3,Thu Jul 2 14:44:07 2015 UTC,UK J is one cup size larger than UK HH.
ABraThatFits,3bqk2e,HootyMyBoobs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:21:15 2015 UTC,That's what I thought. Do you know how much bigger it is? It was suggested as a size sister but I wasn't sure if it would be a massive increase in size.
ABraThatFits,3bqk2e,crazymusicalgenius96,3,Wed Jul 1 19:27:26 2015 UTC,A cup size increase is always an inch difference. I believe a J cup is 13 inches difference between underbust and bust.
ABraThatFits,3bqk2e,joanna70,3,Wed Jul 1 19:44:19 2015 UTC,"Well, it depends on the band size. For example, 34J and 36HH hold the same cup volume, but 36J holds a bit more than 34J. The sister sizes that the calculator told you all hold the same volume, the difference is the length of the band."
ABraThatFits,3bqk2e,Prettyncharmuese,2,Wed Jul 1 19:48:26 2015 UTC,"A sister size, by definition, is the same volume as your normal size but on a different band size.  So, one band size up means one cup size down and vice versa.  How well they fit compared to your correct size will depend on how stretchy the band is and how similarly scaled the cup is or isn't (they do vary very slightly as you go up or down through the sister sizes."

Do I just need to keep wading until I find one with cups and things that are closer together?  What's happening here?"
ABraThatFits,3bqk2e,Prettyncharmuese,5,Wed Jul 1 20:49:40 2015 UTC,Some women do prefer the shape and feel of their old bras. No one here is going to force you to wear the size you measure at just because - it's your choice to wear what makes you feel good. That said it can take many tries to get a truly well fitting bra so if you think you just haven't found the right one yet and do think you can improve on your old size then it makes sense to keep trying things on in your new size. If you're perfectly happy in your old bras tho then there's no reason to change that if you don't want to.  ETA: You might want to make a recommendations post and talk about what you don't like about the fit of your new bras and see if anyone can suggest something that might give you the shape you're looking for in your measured size.

So it's likely that you aren't getting that simply because you haven't found the right fit yet.
ABraThatFits,3bqk2e,hilbertisoutofspace,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:41:29 2015 UTC,"Is it weird/bad for me to prefer wearing a bra that isn't my correct size?  My underbust is 26"" snug, my bust is 34""...so I should be wearing a 28F or 28FF.  But I find 30E just way more comfortable (the only 28 band bras I really enjoy are Freya ones).  I heard this may be because I have a very bony ribcage and not much ""padding"" so the narrower band may hurt me little (which it does).  Will my boobs sag more or suffer if I wear 30E or 30F?"
ABraThatFits,3bqk2e,crazymusicalgenius96,4,Wed Jul 1 21:57:36 2015 UTC,"Your measurements only give a recommended starting size, and it's pretty common to find that you'll be more comfortable in a size which is near to, but not exactly the size which was suggested for you. Wearing one band size up is pretty common in your size range too.  You can pick what feels the most comfy for you, and if you feel supported in a 30 band most of the time, there's no need to wear a 28 band just because you're physically able to put it on."
ABraThatFits,3bqk2e,shy477,2,Thu Jul 2 14:10:54 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about it! I measure 26.5"" snug and I feel best in Freya 28s too. I haven't tried many 30 bands because most of my bras are from Freya but in a bra that runs firm like unlined Cleos I can imagine myself preferring 30s as well. My ribcage is bony and expands a lot (fully expanded it's 28.5 inches) so I need something that can stretch with me as I breathe."

The cups are perfect, the support is perfect, and it is mostly unnoticeable under my shirts.  However...  I've noticed that the band is starting to curl up, and I can't quite figure out why. Even after I wash it (gentle ""hand wash"" cycle in the washing machine, lay flat to air dry), it's showing some significant curling.   What's causing this? Is it just the material?"
ABraThatFits,3bqk2e,shy477,2,Thu Jul 2 01:07:11 2015 UTC,"It could very well be the fabric and/or the elastic. I think you've posted about having other Bali bras before, right?

I have similar underbust measurements (25.5/24) and I can't really stand to wear 28s after I have known the comfort of 26s, so I think you should definitely try one or two. The only real way to tell if you lean towards the FF or the G is if you try on bras.   What exactly do you think your shape is? I can hopefully make a recommendation for you."

The difference is that Comexim doesn't charge for custom work, Ewa does (about $7.00 more than the base price of the bra).  Wellfitting (a 3rd party seller of Comexim bras) lists 26s as orderable on their website, but unless they have them in stock here in the US, (which seems unlikely), they'll have to place the order with Comexim anyway, so it's not going to be any faster. They do, however, accept returns of 26 bands, which neither Comexim nor Ewa have done, historically.  At any rate, Comexim is on vacation until 7/27, so it's going to be a bit of a wait no matter who you go with."

ABraThatFits,3bqewi,Crikey-Way,5,Wed Jul 1 08:46:28 2015 UTC,"Gapping at the top of the cup doesn't necessarily mean the cup size is too large. It could just mean the shape of the bra is wrong for your breasts.  Since you're measuring at a 30FF (hope you don't mind I looked at your past posts!), which is the sister size of 32F, it's probably a shape issue you're experiencing.   Are you scooping and swooping?"

ABraThatFits,3bqewi,yellkaa,5,Wed Jul 1 08:54:37 2015 UTC,"The Deco Vibe, like most moulded bras (on average) is shallowish on the bottom (ie it comes up from the underwire nearer the vertical than a lot of boobs need), are tall and for a tall root (where breast tissue extends a longer way up the body) or FOT shape (where there is more tissue above than below the nipple).  They will gape when you move even if a decent fit when standing with shoulders back.  If you measure as 30F then going for a 32 band Freya isn't going to be a great idea, as they have very stretchy bands.  I would read through the shape guide, try the leaning forwards shape test, and go from there as what shape you are will determine which bras we recommend.  I would say you probably have a short root, hard to tell on width and shape in a moulded cup."
ABraThatFits,3bqewi,yellkaa,2,Wed Jul 1 12:20:03 2015 UTC,"""unless I hold my shoulders back"" - sorry if it sounds too rude: I'm not a native speaker, maybe, I should better use other terms and phrases. I totally don't mean to hurt you any way. But do you have a poor posture? The way you say about your breast size sounds like you are a bit ashamed of your boobs, and the girls who really are usually tend to  'slouch' subconsciously as if they were trying to hide their breasts. Poor posture distorts the way your breasts sit and generally is bad for your health, so if the bra makes you to fix it, to stay in good posture, it's pretty good for you, for your health. You're beautiful, and you have nothing to be ashamed of."

Bras that are too FOT for me will gap even if they're in a cup size smaller than what typically fits. If the cups were too open on top, it would cause gapping, especially since you're FOB. If the cups were too shallow, your breasts may push the cups away from your body, causing gapping as well."

ABraThatFits,3bpiym,LadyVerene,8,Sat Jul 4 09:29:41 2015 UTC,"Let me help clarify your range of potential sizes here. With an average underbust measurement of 32, you'll either want a 32 or 34 band size. Your average bust measurement is 38, which is a 6 inch difference from a 32 band. That puts you in a 32DDD in US sizing. If you wanted a looser 34 band instead, you'd go to a 34DD US.  You say you tried on bras in those sizes, but found there to be a lot of empty space in the cups. I agree with other posters that you're facing one of two problems:   You failed to ""swoop and scoop"" after you put the bras on, which means that not all of your breast tissue ended up in the cups. The shape of the cups was totally wrong for your breasts, resulting in gaping at the top. This seems especially likely if you're bottom heavy."
ABraThatFits,3bpiym,AskMrScience,2,Wed Jul 1 07:01:16 2015 UTC,"When I tried on the DD there was extra room in the front, like nipple area.

I really just want things to be flattering as I feel like all of my bras to date are full coverage and don't do anything to make my boobs look nice. I don't think balconette styles really look good with my shape :/"
ABraThatFits,3bq43v,aggravatedmagistrate,10,Wed Jul 1 06:21:19 2015 UTC,I think the calculator is overestimating a bit due to your projection. You have short and narrow roots and a lot of projection - so I think you should try the Cleo Lily/Erin in 32FF.
ABraThatFits,3bq43v,goodoldfreda,3,Wed Jul 1 09:48:33 2015 UTC,"You have very projected breasts and need a smaller cup. The Freya Oh La La looks about 2 cups too large, but otherwise it seems to fit you well.   I second the rec for Cleo Lily. You can also try more Freya and Fantasie bras. Cleo Lily has a size adjusted shape, it will be significantly shallower in 32F than in 32G and E/F is about the turning point where the Cleo bras become shallower than the unpadded Freyas.    The LeMystere fits the best bc this brand uses US sizing, a 32G with LeMystere is a UK 32F. Two cupsizes down from the other bras."
ABraThatFits,3bq43v,t_maia,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:01:27 2015 UTC,"I think I would like to try a 30 band- so to go down two cup sizes in the Freya, would I be looking at a 30E? or?   And what size should I try in the Cleo Lily, with a 30 band.   I want the bands to be as tight as possible, since I'm still losing more weight (and seem to lose faster on the underbust than bust). I can even use an extender for a bit, if everything else fits nice.   Ugh, I didn't realize that with the LeMystere. I'll have to watch out for that in the future."
ABraThatFits,3bq43v,t_maia,2,Thu Jul 2 01:17:57 2015 UTC,"so to go down two cup sizes in the Freya, would I be looking at a 30E? or?    No, 30FF. Cleo Lily ditto.   Just note that Cleo runs tighter in the band than Freya, additionally the too larger cup made the band feel looser than it really is. So please try 32F in Cleo Lily too."
ABraThatFits,3bq43v,syrusbliz,2,Thu Jul 2 03:10:07 2015 UTC,"If your band is so loose on 32, 30 is probably a better call.

ABraThatFits,3bq43v,yellkaa,2,Thu Jul 2 22:18:50 2015 UTC,"You've got the explanation for IMF, as for sizing down:  Normally when you go down a band size you go up a cupsize to retain volume (EX: 32G - 30GG), since you want to go down a cupsize or two you're probably looking for 30F, maybe even E. Don't be afraid to make use of places like amazon with free returns. Buy several sizes of the same bra and see which fits best.  Also, it looks like Cleo Lucy/Kali are other choices that may work for your FOB shape.  Unfortunately, as many of us discovered, it can take many tries to get the right size and shape match. But once you do, you can use bratabase.com to find cuts and sizes of the same and shopping tends to be much easier."

ABraThatFits,3bqu5c,canadiangolden,2,Wed Jul 1 12:18:03 2015 UTC,"Unwired bras technically have no gore so it can't tack :).  To decide between band sizes you need to try the bra on backwards and upside down, too small a cup can make a band size feel too tight, but too loose a band will move up when you do jumping jacks etc.  You may well need a 28 band in some brands and styles and definitely never start on the tightest hook, go down a band size and use an extender if necessary.  WHen trying on bras see if you can take photos including of the label, helps with adding to notes,  You need to try and assess wire width and work out if it's gaping because you're pushing the cup away, or if everything is sitting in the right place but it's just too big on top etc.  Some of the assessments are trickier in the typical padded shallow bras.  I don't know the bras you'vre tried on well except Deco which was a weird fit on me.  I would say work out the band size you need (bratabase measurements and comments on here) and then order two cup sizes, again you should find info to indicate whether you might want larger or smaller cup sizes."

I would go up a cup size since it's a plunge, as my 28D client fit much better in the 28DD.  Good luck in your quest!"
ABraThatFits,3bq22s,bex238,11,Wed Jul 1 05:57:16 2015 UTC,"I have almost the same measurements and I wear 30D.  Do you fill out the 34C? Because 30D is one cupsize smaller so a 30DD is also possible.  Take a look at the shape guide about projection. In this size most women need shallow bras but not always.  And also try if you can figure out the width of your breast roots, thats helpful to know how wide the wires must be if your trying bras on. You can probably see the outer end of your breast if you push on your breast.  Bras that are often recommended in this size for mostly shallow shapes are B.Tempt'D Ciao Bella or B.Wow'D, Lepel Fiore Plunge or Balcony, Cleo Juna/Maddie/Marcie/Lucy, Freya padded halfcups, Betsey Johnson halfcups."
ABraThatFits,3bq22s,-Barbamama-,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:58:16 2015 UTC,"I thought I filled out a 34C but maybe it is a bit loose. I'll order a 30D and 30DD to compare which fits better.  I think I am slight shallow after looking at the projection guide, and have a wide root.  Is this one of the bras you were talking about?"
ABraThatFits,3bq22s,-Barbamama-,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:15:57 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried that one myself, I am from Europe and Betsey Johnson are not easy to find here. But it was one of the recommended bras to me.   From the Betsey Johnsons bras I've only tried the Stocking Stripe myself but it runs large in the cup so a 30D didn't fit. If you want to try that one better order a cupsize smaller."
ABraThatFits,3bq1zt,Madelinka,2,Wed Jul 1 05:56:11 2015 UTC,"I agree, if you are spilling out it's likely the calculator is underestimating. If we sister size down: 40DD->38E->36F. Up a cup size from that is 36FF and that's the minimum you should try.  Try Cleo Lucy/Kali, Panache Andorra full cup, Panache Envy, Elomi Betty."
ABraThatFits,3bq1zt,noys,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:38:59 2015 UTC,"Does it make a difference that the 40DD is in US sizing and, I'm assuming, the 36E is in UK sizing? Would you still recommend going up to a 36F?"
ABraThatFits,3bq1zt,noys,2,Wed Jul 1 14:28:36 2015 UTC,UK and US sizing are the same up to DD cup. 36E is a cup volume smaller then 40DD in all sizing systems. If you're spilling out of 40DD you'll need a larger volume. You will need at least 36FF.
ABraThatFits,3bq1zt,aithuia,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:11:18 2015 UTC,"One last question, and thank you so much for your help! If sizing differs at DD cups, would 36FF be my US or UK size? If it's UK, what's the US equivalent (for future reference)?"
ABraThatFits,3bq1zt,j_sunrise,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:32:13 2015 UTC,"36FF is your UK size, which will be either a G or an H in US sizing -- US brands tend to be much less consistent, so here's a list of how several of them size bras: https://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/wiki/buying_guide#wiki_by_brand"
ABraThatFits,3bphmx,foxyillusion,4,Wed Jul 1 02:42:22 2015 UTC,"Hi again! The calculator gives UK sizes, yes. Put your measurements into the calculator exactly as you took them.   I think the calculator is estimating a little high. Try starting with 44HH. 42J might also work - it's going to depend on whether you find a 44 band or a 42 band more comfortable. I know you said the band on your current bra is too tight, but 42 bands might feel fine in the correct cup size, so don't rule it out just yet.   Elila and Goddess are two US brands that come in your size. You'd be 44L or 42M in their sizing."
ABraThatFits,3bphmx,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:27:01 2015 UTC,Hi! I had two new bras come in and compared them. I had a 42H from LB (I ordered it a while ago and just got in the mail) and the 42 I from Modern Movement. A 42 band feels mostly okay after wearing the brand new 42H. I think what's bothering me is the cup because it's too small. The 44H just feels too loose. I think a 42HH would be a good starting point for me though. Can you recommend a good bra in that size range? I'm finding Goddess and Glamorize and they leave something to be desired. Am I looking for a 42HH in US or UK sizing? Thank you again!
ABraThatFits,3bphmx,hurrrrrmione,2,Wed Jul 1 03:35:15 2015 UTC,"Did you try the 42I on upside-down and backwards like I suggested in your previous post?   Depending on how long you've had the 44H, the band may be stretched out and therefore fit looser than a brand-new 44H.   Some bras also have stretchier bands than others, so there's also the possibility you'd prefer 44 bands in bras with tight bands and 42 bands in bras with stretchy bands.  You're looking for 42HH in UK sizing.   I'm going to defer to /u/t_maia and /u/Goddess_Keira for specific bra suggestions. I don't know enough about your size range to be helpful."
ABraThatFits,3bphmx,hurrrrrmione,3,Wed Jul 1 03:58:51 2015 UTC,I did try the 42I upside down and backwards and it felt pretty good. I had to play around with the straps a little bit but felt good. The 44H felt big in the cup when I first had it but it's definitely stretched out. I'm going to try both and see what feels better as I've learned the hard way that numbers can feel very different. Thank you so much for the clarification!
ABraThatFits,3bphmx,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:07:06 2015 UTC,You're welcome!
ABraThatFits,3bphmx,Goddess_Keira,3,Wed Jul 1 04:21:05 2015 UTC,"I see I was mentioned--I can't add too much to what /u/t_maia has already said, but if you want something more fashion-forward than the Goddess/Glamorise/Elila type bras, check out Elomi's collection. If you can wear a 42 band, they have many options. In a 44, the largest cup size for most of their styles is 44G (UK), which would probably be a bit small (wait, maybe not, because it's a sister size to 42GG which is within the range of what may fit you in cup volume) but their Caitlyn and Rita styles both come up to 44GG and 44H. The Panache Sculptresse line may appeal to you as well, though the wires are more narrow they may work just fine for you. I think the Sculptresse Chi-Chi comes in your size and is a cute bra."
ABraThatFits,3bphmx,t_maia,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:54:31 2015 UTC,Thank you for the suggestions! I found a marked down Elomi Caitlyn for $10 from Bare Necessities. I'm going to splurge and try it out since it's fairly inexpensive. The Chi-Chi is in my size and very cute! I'm going to try Goddess/Glamorize/Elila so I can have something supportive.
ABraThatFits,3bphmx,t_maia,2,Wed Jul 1 05:11:45 2015 UTC,"Oh, that is an awesome price for Caitlyn! I hope the fit is right, because it's a great basic bra and quite pretty besides."
ABraThatFits,3bphmx,jassykangaroo,5,Wed Jul 1 05:28:05 2015 UTC,"Snug: 45 Tight: 40 Relaxed: 55 Bending: 59 Laying flat: 53.5   With those measurements I think you'd do well in 42 and 44 bands, depending how tight the bra runs.   Cupsize wise I get between 44F/42FF as smallest possible size and 44HH/42J as largest possible size.   Normally my advice would be to try somewhere in the middle at around 44G/42GG, but if you get quadboob in the Modern Movement in 42i that is probably too small.    So best start trying around 44GG/H or 42 H/HH.  That is US 44 J/K and 42 K/L.    I'm looking at UK bras as I don't think I can get any US bras that would fit my new size.    Goddess and Elila are two US companies that have specialised making bras in the large band large cup combos.    figured out I have a broad root, shallow breasts and am full on top and my breasts are rounded.   You probably don't have a shallow shape. It is extremely rare to have a shallow shape in this size range.   That said, the bras by Goddess are shallower than those by Elomi and Panache. If what you say is true, look at Goddess.   Bras that are good for a full-on-top shape in this size range are the Goddess Rose 6080, the Goddess Alice, the Goddess Clara and the Elila 2311.   The brands Panache Sculptresse, Ulla Dessous and PourMoi? also work for full on top, but they are more projected and narrower."
ABraThatFits,3bphmx,Goddess_Keira,2,Wed Jul 1 03:48:20 2015 UTC,Thank you for the help! I'm getting quadboob in the 42H Lane Bryant bra. The band itself feels mostly okay but the cup is uncomfortable and I'm definitely spilling out of it. You were correct about the shallow - I had too many tabs open and didn't realize I was looking at non shallow when I made the post. So I'm better off looking for Elomi or Panache then? I don't want a torpedo look if that makes sense. My breasts already occupy a large part of my chest and I don't want to make it any more obvious or make it look like I've had a bad boob job.
ABraThatFits,3bphmx,EmmaInFrance,4,Wed Jul 1 03:55:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the help! I'm getting quadboob in the 42H Lane Bryant bra   US 42H in LB = UK 42G.   So I'm better off looking for Elomi or Panache then?     Try all brands I mentioned. Goddess has the advantage of being easy to find and being the cheapest at full price (usually around 45 USD, while Panache and Elomi are 60+ USD).   A good strategy would be to try Goddess Alice (or Clara) and Elomi Caitlyn (or Goddess Keira/Kayla) in various sizes, the two bras are easy to find and have a shape that is opposite of each other. Note that Alice runs tight in the band, so if in doubt go for the 44 band in Alice."
ABraThatFits,3bphmx,jassykangaroo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:07:27 2015 UTC,I would just like to comment on this as I have similar measurements and would like to see how it goes for you! You can look at my posts if you'd like to see how a panache 46FF and an Elomi 44GG fits me and compare to yourself. I also have a 44I in goddess Kayla on the way so when that comes I will post pics of the fit!
ABraThatFits,3bphmx,jassykangaroo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:24:02 2015 UTC,I saw your thread and was stalking it! Do you prefer panache or Elomi? I would really like to try Elomi as they look like actual bras and not something to cover/hide my breasts. Did you get Sculptresse or Panache? I've been told that Sculptress is good for full/plus size busts.
ABraThatFits,3bphmx,jassykangaroo,4,Wed Jul 1 04:33:13 2015 UTC,Sculptresse is a sub-brand of Panache and is their larger-band line. You will want to look for those as the Panache line tops out at a 38 band size. EDIT: Panache Tango and Rhapsody do go up to a 42 band in your potential cup size.
ABraThatFits,3bphmx,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:04:56 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestion!
ABraThatFits,3bphmx,jassykangaroo,2,Wed Jul 1 05:16:38 2015 UTC,"I find that I can go down a band size in Elomi - as in my tight measurement is 37 but I wear a 36 band in Elomi. In any Panache bra, including Sculptresse, I need to go up a cup size. If you do try Sculptresse then Chi Chi might be the best to try first."
ABraThatFits,3bpgyg,Gilliegrl4,2,Wed Jul 1 02:37:32 2015 UTC,"Again, it's like it turns in too sharply.   In this case halfcups might be the answer. With halfcups the fit of the upper part of the cup does not matter.   Look at Cleo Juna and Freya Padded halfcups,  Fantasie Allegra Halfcup, Freya Marvel.   Bras from the brands Aubada and Simone Perele might also work if you are willing to shell out for it."
ABraThatFits,3bpgyg,t_maia,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:43:02 2015 UTC,"I didn't think to try halfcups because I've heard many of them are shallow, but we'll give some a shot! Thanks!"
ABraThatFits,3bpgyg,buymeflowers,2,Wed Jul 1 21:55:31 2015 UTC,"It's almost like it closed too sharply and the top part of her breast stops before or isn't as rounded as what the bra wants.   Did the edge of the cup lay flat/cut into breast tissue, and then the sheer part with the embroidery wrinkled? Or was the whole upper part of the cup wrinkling?"
ABraThatFits,3bplhk,boobiefitthrowaway,3,Wed Jul 1 03:15:38 2015 UTC,"The Freya plunges are typically narrow and projected and it looks like the CK one is also the same shape. Perhaps check out the Freya half cups, they tend to run more wide and shallow. The Lauren comes in half cup and there are many others like Marvel or Patsy."

ABraThatFits,3bplhk,buymeflowers,2,Wed Jul 1 23:22:03 2015 UTC,"Definitely try Freya Lauren in the half cup version. Your roots are indeed tall, and also appear to be wide. Generally speaking, half cups will likely work much better for you than plunges or balconettes."
ABraThatFits,3boe5y,Archaeologue,4,Tue Jun 30 21:01:14 2015 UTC,"How tight did you measure your tight underbust? Usually we see a somewhat larger difference between the two, the snug measurement should be taken on a neutral inhale just tight enough that it doesn't slide around while the tight measurement is taken fully exhaled as tight as it will go."
ABraThatFits,3boe5y,noys,2,Tue Jun 30 21:25:01 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay - I took it again and absolutely as tight as it could go was 43.75-44""."
ABraThatFits,3boe5y,noys,3,Tue Jun 30 21:28:18 2015 UTC,"I'd start with 44GG/H, I think the calculator is overestimating slightly. I think trying Elomi Caitlyn again is a good idea. I'm not sure which of the newer cuts have similar width but the Hermione/Amelia molded cup ones should be quite close. The bad thing about these is that they end at 44GG so you may be sized out. If Caitlyn ends up being too wide try Elomi plunges and Elomi Etta.  Definitely order at least the first batch with free shipping and returns."
ABraThatFits,3boe5y,EmmaInFrance,2,Tue Jun 30 21:43:21 2015 UTC,I'd definitely try a 44 band in Elomi - the bands are generous.
ABraThatFits,3boe5y,crazymusicalgenius96,3,Wed Jul 1 10:37:54 2015 UTC,"Going off your leaning measurement, which tends to be more accurate in your size range, I'm getting 46G/GG. Trying Caitlyn again in both those sizes would probably be more beneficial than trying to track down a 46HH!"
ABraThatFits,3boe5y,jassykangaroo,2,Tue Jun 30 21:20:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, one of the reasons I was less thrilled about the 46HH measurement was that NONE of the fun colours are available in that size. It's hard enough getting a 46G/GG!"
ABraThatFits,3bo2dm,C_latroque,4,Tue Jun 30 19:35:51 2015 UTC,"You look FOB in bras that have taller cups. To me, it looks like you're even, short-rooted, and projected."

ABraThatFits,3bo2dm,Goddess_Keira,3,Wed Jul 1 12:56:17 2015 UTC,"I'd say you're pretty narrow and projected, and that your short roots make you functionally FoB anyways. You're not going to fill out the top part of bras that are really open and can accommodate lots of top fullness.  I like how the Arabella looks on you, though it does seem to be a touch wide at the gore and it's hard to tell if it's tacking. Otherwise that cut seems to work well on your shape. If the gore doesn't bother you comfort-wise, I'd say that's a good cut for you to wear. Have you tried Cleo Lucy (or Kali), and how does it work for you, seeing as it caters more to FoB shapes than the other Cleos you have. It will likely be wide in the wires, though."
ABraThatFits,3bo2dm,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:52:38 2015 UTC,"Hi! Yeah I guess that's it, even but functionally FOB makes a lot of sense. I also like the Arabella a lot, I wish the other colorways were easy to find, but it's been so long that it's very hard to see them appear on ebay. The gore actually tacks. I'm centre full but not super close set so it tacks. I haven't tried cleo lucy but I want to. About the width of the wires, it might be too wide (most of my bras are) but george is also almost an inch wider than my roots and it doesn't hurt me, so Lucy might be worth trying.   Now I understand why I can and I like to wear very low cut tops, and it's because it doesn't look obscene in me since my boobs start low in my chest. So really, what I'm showing is my pecs/chest. No clevage. Also, it explains why all my new bras, even an Ewa SM, peek out of my summer tops. Sigh. Short boob problems.  Thank you!"
ABraThatFits,3bo2dm,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Wed Jul 1 10:28:14 2015 UTC,"Freya has lots of cuts that are the same as or based on Arabella. Unfortunately, I'm not too familiar with them. Siren is one that I'm pretty sure is not discontinued. I think the Ooh La La is another. I looked on Bratabase and several that they listed were discontinued, but I know there are newer ones. Be sure you look for the plunge balcony style, as Freya gives many cuts the same name. (e.g., there's the Patsy unlined plunge (which may be another one that'll work for you) and the Patsy padded half-cup. Some of their balconies, like Rio and Gem and any that are related to those, are more for FoT and so not likely to work for you."
ABraThatFits,3bo2dm,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:14:29 2015 UTC,"Rio and Gem are lone wolves, they have no clones.   Someday I want somebody to try one bra from all of the Freya plunge balcony cuts just to see what happens to them on the same pair of boobs. It's probably pretty hard to track down all of them, especially since I think some of the cuts have been entirely discontinued, but it would clear up a lot of things. (I'd volunteer, but my boobs would not go well with any of them, so I doubt much could be learned from putting my boobs in all of them.)"

ABraThatFits,3bo2dm,yellkaa,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:44:42 2015 UTC,"That's true that they have lots of similar cuts. I tried the Faye and the Ada plunge, but even when they looked ok on me, they gave me more in-cup quadboob and not such a nice shape as the Arabella does. Also, I like the sheerness and the design much more. The siren is very pretty but right now I have no moneys. I also like the Ooh la la in nude but it's hard to come accross it, same as Eleanor and Lyla. Other freya plunge balconies just have prints that aren't so cute to my taste.   As well, I've been thinking about getting half cups (polish) in a smaller size, possibly Ewa Michalak HM and CH-CHP, because british balcony bras always take on a lot of non-boob space in my chest and are visible when I wear summer tops. Good for support though."

ABraThatFits,3bnm6q,Goddess_Keira,7,Tue Jun 30 18:01:18 2015 UTC,"I just did it and it  but it said I was a 26DD which seems insane to me considering I can't fill out some 30as.

ABraThatFits,3bnm6q,lauracb,15,Tue Jun 30 18:06:58 2015 UTC,"you may not be able to ""fill them out"" because the band is sitting on breast tissue not around it all. Also if you have a shallow shape, a DD might not look that big. Plus, sister-sized up to a 30-band, a 26DD is a 30C so that's only 2 sizes different, not a whole lot. 28s are a lot more common than 26s so maybe start with a 28C/D, and swoop and scoop and see how it goes?"

ABraThatFits,3bnm6q,MidNightMare5998,8,Tue Jun 30 18:10:26 2015 UTC,Alright. I guess I'll begin the search for 26DD bras then!
ABraThatFits,3bnm6q,hurrrrrmione,17,Tue Jun 30 18:13:02 2015 UTC,Unfortunately finding bands that small can be a challenge. You may have to go custom if you want a truly perfect fit. If you are on a budget you may have more success finding some 28 bands (maybe a 28D for your first try) to start without having to make a custom order.
ABraThatFits,3bnm6q,Reyali,8,Tue Jun 30 18:14:27 2015 UTC,Ok thank you! I'm definitely on a budget so I'll be searching for cheaper options and I'll probably have to settle for one well fitting bra for now. Thanks for your help! I just wish I could try some on in person. Maybe I'll drop by Nordstrom and see if they have any. Won't be cheap but other threads on here said they carry many sizes
ABraThatFits,3bnm6q,goodoldfreda,4,Tue Jun 30 18:20:59 2015 UTC,"Nordstrom and Dillard's are both great. I don't have a Nordstrom in my area but I have found some 30 bands at Dillard's. It's definitely not ideal but you could try a 30C if that's the best you can find in-store. Nordstrom may be better about having 28 bands, I'm not sure. Shop around and have some fun with it, and try on as much as you want before you buy anything. I had a blast doing it when I first re-sized, mostly because I always assumed I would be shackled to an A cup for the rest of my life and fitting into Ds was an incredibly surreal experience (still is to this day every time I put my bra on in the morning; the small-boob identity takes a long time to fade.)  Happy to help! :)"

Check the offline retailer list to see if they are any stores in your area that carry 28 bands.

ABraThatFits,3bnm6q,M_tridactyla,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:05:32 2015 UTC,"Judging by the evidence you're giving in this post, it sounds to me like you're having a lot of the same problems I do as someone with very shallow breasts. It also sounds like you need to go down a band size and up a cup size. Perhaps start with a 28B? I'm aware that sizes under a 30 band are very difficult to find, so maybe also try a 30B to start if that's easier for you to find. When your breasts are shallow, it's easy to wear cups that are too small because it looks like you're being covered, even though it's just covering part of your breast.   If you haven't already, I would highly recommend using the bra size calculator that is linked constantly on this website. It is extremely helpful and I think it might help resolve your fit issues. If you have already used the calculator and are still having issues, I highly recommend posting an official Measurement Check to this subreddit with your full range of measurements and the issues you're having with your bras.  ESPECIALLY if my hunch is correct and you do have shallow breasts, remember to vigorously swoop and scoop when you are trying on bras! It's so important!

ABraThatFits,3bnksa,tinytinytiny0,3,Tue Jun 30 17:33:16 2015 UTC,"You can get 26s from Wellfitting. Technically they are custom made, but they are returnable if they don't fit. However, they are pretty projected so probably wouldn't work for you. Unpadded Cleos tend to run tight, but I don't find them tight enough for me.  What I do is buy 28s and alter them (lots of different tutorials on the sidebar), you could also look into getting a Rixie Clip for the bras that already fit you."
ABraThatFits,3bnksa,goodoldfreda,3,Tue Jun 30 18:16:46 2015 UTC,"Bosom Galore is a relatively new luxury brand that sells 26 bands, no custom order needed!   I would caution against buying 30 bands unless you know they run extremely tight or you're willing to alter them down. My UB measures 27"" snug and 25.5"" tight and I've never been able to wear a 30 band without it riding up. :("
ABraThatFits,3bnksa,governmentboobs,3,Tue Jun 30 23:30:36 2015 UTC,"Looking on Bratabase, Freya Arabella runs about a band size big which could explain why you have to wear it on the smallest set of hooks. It's possible that 28DD/Es running true to size to small in the band would work without having to buy from Comexim, Bosom Galore, or get a custom ordered 26 band. I would recommend checking Bratabase's stretched band measurement in the styles you're interested in to see how the bands run.  Generally speaking, many Cleo bras run true to size or small in the band. Check out ones that may mesh with your shape."
ABraThatFits,3bnksa,Gilliegrl4,2,Wed Jul 1 02:55:31 2015 UTC,"Well..26 bands are hard to come by (usually custom order) I myself am a band larger and am a 28F. If 28DD fits fine in the cups, stick with that size. If the cups are a smidge too big, go to a 28E. I don't have as much experience as some members, but I know quite a bit so far. Unfortunately, there aren't really any places that do 26 bands without custom made. You can either wear tight 28's and alter the band to fit more like a 26. Other than that, get them custom made or wear 28's."
ABraThatFits,3bnksa,ariawhatever,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:06:47 2015 UTC,"The Cleo Neve band runs tight, so you may check that out. The edges of the cups do turn out a bit which is annoying, but the tight band makes it worth it for me. I just wear a tank top so it doesnt show through.   The Stella Mesh bra has one entry on bratabase in 30D that measured the stretched band to go to 28.5, which I would agree to be tight for a 30 band. I do not have an personal experience with the bra, but there is a review on that bratabase link above."

ABraThatFits,3bn4mv,GravesRunner,5,Tue Jun 30 15:39:13 2015 UTC,"Wacoal goes by their own sizing of DD, DDD, F, G, H. Most people prefer using UK sizing which goes DD, E, F, FF, G, GG, H. UK sizing is way more consistent across brands than US sizing. So your Wacoal 34G is actually a 34FF. That's 1-2 sizes smaller than you measure as."

Do the Cleo Lucy/Lily/Erin and Panache Jasmine handle pendulous breasts well or are there other suggestions for lifting these things?

ABraThatFits,3bma4h,aboywithgirls,2,Tue Jun 30 12:39:43 2015 UTC,"I have both the panache sport and the Freya molded sports bra. The panache is a better fit for me because the wires are more narrow. It's super intense, I get zero jiggle but after a few hours I feel pretty constricted. The Freya is more of a medium impact, I've even worn it as a regular bra, but its held up fine for jogging as well. I also have the other Freya sports bra, which gives a pretty weird pointy shape, and unfortunately I got tissue migration shortly after getting it so it also is just too small, so I can't say much about performance."
ABraThatFits,3bma4h,CatenaryFairy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:42:05 2015 UTC,"That's one of the things that I like about the Panache, is the shape that DOESNT make me have that ""weird pointy shape""."

I (meaning ""the girls"") were very happy."
ABraThatFits,3bma4h,aboywithgirls,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:00:07 2015 UTC,I bought the Freya Active in my regular size(32G) and the band is TIGHT. It was very supportive but definitely on the pointy side. The Panache is next on my list to try.
ABraThatFits,3bma4h,dwer376,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:15:35 2015 UTC,I was also advised to look at the new Chantelle sports bra. The woman who told me about it knew that i didnt want the Madonna pointed shape also says that it gives the same rounded shape as the Panache.

ABraThatFits,3bmdvm,ventimus,3,Tue Jun 30 11:41:18 2015 UTC,That bra used to come in more colors. I see some purple ones on ebay but not in your size. I'd recommend stalking ebay to see of more show up. IMO a lot of Betsey Johnson bras fit similarly so you could try those.

If you're fuller in the cup i'd recommend going up a cupsize in natori. I dont think elle macpherson makes a 30 band or below, but I need a 28 band (truly a 26) and i can comfortably wear the 32 bands on the tightest hook without them sliding around as i move, they seem much tighter than most of my 32 band bras."

ABraThatFits,3bmdvm,theapproachingcurve,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:30:00 2015 UTC,"Seconding the Retro Glamour. They fit identically on me. The only reason I don't have one is that I haven't found like with a look I like.  The Starlet lace I found was a bit deeper than the Eyelet Lace. It's also more heavily lined and so much less accommodating. It fit me, but gaped as soon as I moved, so I returned it.   I can also recommend the Forever Perfect Demi bra. This one does come in a lot of colors.   I find that half cups in general fit pretty similarly to the Eyelet Lace, especially those with two vertical seams. You might also like the Lepel Fiore plunge. It doesn't fit as well on me (it has a diagonal seam), but it's soooo pretty and super comfortable.   I'm hoping the Eyelet lace eventually comes out with new colors again, because there aren't too many halfcups/demis with a low gore like it."

ABraThatFits,3bjl60,eageratbest,12,Mon Jun 29 21:13:21 2015 UTC,"I second that about the more flattering shape.

They slide around under my skin and pull on things internally which hurts after a while! Also they like to slide around every which way when I'm exercising or even just going up and down stairs, which is not fun. So even though my boobs are small, they still require support.  Even if my boobs didn't like to do their weird sliding around act, I would wear bras because they improve my breast shape in clothes. Without a bra they slide down to my rib flare, making me more shallow and bottom-heavy than I am in a bra. I like showing what projection I've got - I definitely prefer the green shape."

I tend to call it ""semi-pendulous"" because it's like the internal tissues are responding to the call of gravity and drooping, but the skin didn't get the memo and isn't folding over at the IMF. I can feel breast tissue moving against my ribcage when I move unless the bra is securely in my IMF. It took some experimentation to find it, actually.

Humans are the only mammals with permanently enlarged breasts; in other mammals, breasts are conspicuous only when engorged with milk during lactation - they certainly don't maintain them their entire post-pubescent life, even after menopause, like we do. Virtually all of the theories around why this is the case revolve around the ideas like signaling fertility to males, promoting pair bonding with mates (since we are also among the few mammals to mate face-to-face), etc. Breasts shouldn't be over-sexualized, but don't completely disregard their sexual nature either."
ABraThatFits,3bjl60,startwithaguess,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:36:45 2015 UTC,Okay... But still. We've evolved past the point where we NEED to tie breasts to sexuality. So what if they evolved to serve a secondary sexual function? Their actual primary purpose is for food. Period. There's no reason for them to be sexualized other than to control and objectify women and I'm not down with that. I understand that this is a reason but it's a very flimsy excuse and I see it as such. There is no good reason for modern society to sexualize breasts when we have evolved to this point as a species.

I stopped wearing a bra probably 5 years ago because I enjoy the braless look and most of the time you can't tell I'm not wearing one anyway.

Currently I'm not sure of my exact size; I lost weight due to illness over the winter and never remeasured myself. There's only about a 1 to 1.5"" difference between my ribs and the fullest part of my bust, just to give you an idea of their size. If they weren't as far apart, and if the tissue was not so spread out over my chest, they'd probably look bigger than they do. But I love 'em...they're cute! And they somehow managed to stay decently perky and shapely despite 3 pregnancies and several years' worth of breastfeeding. Not sure how they pulled that off, what voodoo they used, but I'm ever so grateful they did. It took me years to learn how to accept them though...I hated how small they were for many years. Anyway...moviing on...  I rarely go without a bra. I like having a bit of support, because it fluffs the girls up and makes my shirts fit a little bit better. I also really don't like the idea of everyone being able to see my nipples through my shirts; there's no hiding these things otherwise. And yes, I like the way they look...there's something rather sexy about garments made to keep your boobs juuuuust out of sight.  I mostly wear soft-cup ""leisure bras"" or ""bralettes"" without underwire because they're comfy as heck and because it's hard to find underwire bras that fit me properly. But I have a few underwire/pushup bras for when I want to be a little more va-va-voom. Once in a while I just say ""fuck it"" and go braless in summertime; I have a couple little crop tops and I stick removeable bra pads in them for coverage, and layer them under a tank top. I also have a halter top for runing in and I never wear a bra with it because it isn't needed."

ABraThatFits,3bjl60,BirdsMilkCake,4,Tue Jun 30 01:55:02 2015 UTC,"Dunno if my answer here is going to skew things much, but it's worth sharing.   I don't have huge moobs by any means, but what I do have pulls and stretches my skin enough that it arches by mid day if I'm not supporting it in some fashion. Through some observation and experimentation I discovered that a well fitting underwire bra with a moderately wide band does just what is needed to support my 36B's.   I have received some odd looks out and about, because a guy wearing a bra is just so weird, gross, or confusing to the general public."
ABraThatFits,3bjl60,Whatever_username-,2,Mon Jun 29 22:36:30 2015 UTC,"These reasons have kind of been given, but mine are a combination of a few. I'm a pear shape, with my hip measurement a couple inches bigger than my bust, but my boobs always, always look flatter under shirts without a bra, so going braless really accentuates the pear shape. Tailored shirts fit better with a bra to align boobs with the dart properly (and also fill out the top a little better...). My nipples are also really sensitive, so I can't stand a shirt rubbing against them - they even chafe overnight sometimes in T-shirts/pajamas. And finally, I would be constantly checking my shirt to make sure I wasn't flashing anyone if I went braless!"
ABraThatFits,3bjl60,joanna70,2,Mon Jun 29 21:29:53 2015 UTC,"Like the other replies on here, I'm just not comfortable showing my nips to the world.  Nothing wrong with showing them, of course, I personally would just feel like I'm not wearing anything at all.  FWIW, I even feel that way with tops that have built-in support in them (thus I avoid them & wear regular tops with bras).  Also, I work as a nurse and I often have to rush into patient's rooms.  I don't know if bras help reduce the bouncing (which ends up hurting/feeling uncomfortable), but I don't feel it when I wear a bra."
ABraThatFits,3bjl60,C_latroque,3,Tue Jun 30 00:19:48 2015 UTC,I definitely get a bounce when I'm not wearing a bra. I was doing laundry at school once and thought I would be fine to run downstairs to grab my stuff in a sweatshirt without a bra since I had just jumped out of the shower. I felt quite an uncomfortable jiggling the entire walk down the hallway and down the stairs. Bras (even super crappy ones) certainly held hold everything in place and eliminate bounce for me.
ABraThatFits,3bjl60,gliterpoison,2,Tue Jun 30 00:59:21 2015 UTC,"Pretty much what a lot of other people have said. I have a super conical shape so they have a lot of projection but no fullness to go with it so they usually look crazy under a shirt. I also have pretty soft tissue and they jiggle and bounce around if they're not contained which is uncomfortable. I've also found recently that when it's hot, I get instantaneous sweaty underboob if I hunch over. I think I've had some shape/size changes the past year because I don't think they used to do that. And I've got the pear shaped thing going on too a little.  A bra gives me a nice shape, makes my clothes look better, and controls movement. And they look nice too. I adore lingerie.  I still free boob it a lot though, especially if I'm just at home."
ABraThatFits,3bjl60,aboywithgirls,2,Tue Jun 30 01:00:58 2015 UTC,"I wear a bra sometimes to make me look proportional depending on the outfit and occasion, or because it's cold and I want the extra padding for warmth (and discreet nipples). I mostly get around looking like a grunge relic from mid-90s Seattle so I can often get away with wearing just a sports bra under my clothes, or a crop top as I've always known them."
ABraThatFits,3bjl60,gliterpoison,2,Tue Jun 30 02:12:12 2015 UTC,"I originally started wearing a bra in middle school because a girl who wasn't in my gym class told me she heard I didn't wear a bra and I was flashing everyone in the locker room. It hasn't occurred to me that I was supposed to be modest in a single-sex locker room when I had limited time to change before my next class.   Now I wear a bra because even though my breasts are mostly self-supporting, they bounce painfully if I run up or down stairs -- unless I wear a bra that fits."
ABraThatFits,3bjl60,aboywithgirls,2,Tue Jun 30 04:21:25 2015 UTC,"I get ask this question alot.  Not because they aren't large enough,  at my last fitting, I bought two new 36G bras. I am asked the question because I am a man. I don't think that anyone wants to see my ""girls"" running wild under my t shirt.  I also don't want to show off my nipples. But most of all,  it's about comfort. I'm sure that most of you that read this, understand that a good bra can cost $100 or more so I wwouldn't wear one if I didn't have to but for me, $100 is well worth the price of comfort."
ABraThatFits,3bjl60,gliterpoison,2,Tue Jun 30 09:41:03 2015 UTC,Even little boobs can be uncomfortable without a bra. When you run down the stairs they still move. And clothes are made to be worn with bras. Also not all small boobs are perfectly perky. I don't need to wear a bra but my nipples kind of point outward and make shirts look weird without a bra.
ABraThatFits,3bjl60,aboywithgirls,2,Tue Jun 30 13:18:48 2015 UTC,To make it look like I actually have boobs :(
ABraThatFits,3bjl60,noys,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:08:13 2015 UTC,"Technically my boobs probably count as self-supporting... (no fold underneath, full on top). But dressing professionally for school and work means I need to wear a bra.   I've avoided wearing bras as much as I can, though, because for most of my post-pubertal life I've been wearing the wrong size bras, and it was freaking uncomfortable. Now that they're comfortable because I'm wearing the right size, the bras that fit aren't pretty :/"

ABraThatFits,3bjl60,gliterpoison,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:22:00 2015 UTC,"Mine aren't self supporting (30F, projected, narrow, uneven) but I like going braless. I wear bras for funsies (I like how you can play with shapes and outfits : retro, clevage, beerwench...) and when I have to do some running after a train/ workout/ moving out, but going braless is something I reclaimed for myself because nobody should wear a bra just because it's ""the thing to do"" and people should get used to the sight of natural unsupported breasts under clothing as something normal and not specially sexy or weird."
ABraThatFits,3bjl60,aboywithgirls,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:47:14 2015 UTC,"Shape for me. I am way more confident in myself and what I can do when I am in a well fitting bra. Since it doesn't hurt, there isn't a reason for me not to. I also can't come off sexual with the people I work with as I will be in the Counseling field and that is a big no no"
ABraThatFits,3bjl60,SupermarketSweep,2,Tue Jun 30 12:16:32 2015 UTC,"I certainly understand the confidence thing. For me, it's a balancing act. If I take an ace bandage, and bind them down back and down firmly, they are relatively concealed. However after a few hours, they begin to ache and then hurt. However,  if a wear and regular underwire bra like my Freya Deco,  or Panache Porcelain,  I have no problem going 16 hours till I go to bed wearing the same bra. So I am constantly balancing between the comfort and concealment thing."
ABraThatFits,3bjl60,ariawhatever,2,Tue Jun 30 12:36:15 2015 UTC,Please don't bind them with bandages. Its really dangerous. You can google that for yourself. Why not buy a binder? Even then after a few hours you have to let them be for a short time but its much safer for the tissue
ABraThatFits,3bjl60,sunspotshine,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:49:31 2015 UTC,Thank you.  It's been a long time since I've done any binding after I read about the dangers of it. It's not worth it. I have minimizer bras that help a little like when I need to wear a button up shirt. A bra is an all around better choice for me.
ABraThatFits,3bjl60,RL33,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:04:07 2015 UTC,"Well, at least you know what a better choice for you is :) Have you used an underwired sports bra? That might help minimize while still giving support."

The only thing is with it, it's an encapsulating sports bra which gives it amazing control but I think that it adds to my projection a little.  ; (. I do have a couple of underwire,  compression sports bras but are not as comfortable as my Panache or my minimizer bras. Thanks for the suggestions though, I am learning so much from being here. I thought that I had done a good job educating myself about bras and I found out how little I really knew but, it's getting better ;)"
ABraThatFits,3bjl60,goodoldfreda,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:26:55 2015 UTC,"ShockAbsorber has some bras in your size, have you tried them? Some styles run small in band and cup so try them in 38G.  I don't know if I've also already mentioned Tutti Rouge Liliana and Change Lingerie/The Intimate by Britney Spears (EU sizing!) full shapers. They are pretty effective minimizers that work more vertically rather than shoving breasts into your armpits."
ABraThatFits,3bjl60,Julez22,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:59:29 2015 UTC,"That's the first time that I've heard of those bras.  I just wrote them down because I am VERY interested! I hate having my boobs. In my armpits (even though it is better than having button ups gapping so everyone can see my bra! ). I will definitely be checking them out. How's the sizing generally run?   I love the looks of these and like you said,  I can minimize with putting my boobs in my armpits: )"
ABraThatFits,3bjl60,tealeaf_egg,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:08:14 2015 UTC,Tutti Rouge used to run pretty small in band and cup but they have really stepped up their game the last couple of seasons and it's pretty true to size. Change Lingerie (Britney's line is produced by them) is a bit more varied when it comes to band stretchiness but the full shapers are pretty true to size in cups.  Change's stuff is hard to find in US but I stumbled upon a full shaper being sold in a Canadian store in 36I (UK 36G equivalent) for almost nothing! http://www.nowthatslingerie.com/all-styles-catalog/10241044123-jasmine-full-shaper-bra-by-change-of-scandinavia-lingerie.html
ABraThatFits,3blsny,FabHunter,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:46:38 2015 UTC,"I think 38FF would be a good place to start. That's at the top of the size range for many of the US manufacturers. You could maybe try Cacique, you'd want to look for their 38G, maybe even H if they make that on a 38. However, I have heard they have pretty limited shapes, so their bras may not work for you regardless. Otherwise, Nordstrom/Nordstrom Rack, Dillard's, or a local boutique are likely your only options.   Many people shop online, and I'd start with Amazon, nordstrom.com, or asos for free shipping/returns. People can give more recommendations if you can figure out your shape a bit. Popular brands are Freya, Cleo/Panache, maybe Goddess or Elila, but they make different models that suit different shapes, so not all of their bras will work well."
ABraThatFits,3blsny,SmellsLikeDogBuns,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:58:22 2015 UTC,"They do make a 38H. It is shallow and wide, however."

These makers work very well for my breast shape.  I learned that shape is just as important as size when you are looking for a bra that fits. Good luck!"
ABraThatFits,3bkm7l,MyBodyHatesMe,9,Tue Jun 30 00:09:29 2015 UTC,Holly from The Full Figured Chest has chronic fatigue and fibro and did a roundup post of comfortable bras from Cake Lingerie a while back: http://thefullfiguredchest.com/2014/07/cake-lingerie-stylish-comfortable-bras-everyone-even-youre-pregnant/
ABraThatFits,3bkm7l,bustynerd,5,Tue Jun 30 03:07:18 2015 UTC,"Most longlines have underwire. Do you think underwire will be more aggravating to your fibromyalgia, or do you think it could help?  There's also the option of a basque, but basques are pretty structured (boning and such) so I'm also not really sure how it would affect you.  I think starting with 36F is probably a good idea. Maybe try 34FF and 36F in a bra, to see whether the additional support from a tighter band is beneficial or if you need something looser. Freya is a UK brand that makes lots of longlines, and they're known to have quite stretchy bands, so hopefully that would help! Right now on Amazon, Freya only has one longline available in your size, but it's Prime eligible so you can return it if it doesn't work out. It's called Freya Parade and it's very brightly colored. =)  If you search for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in the search bar, you may be able to find a post from a woman who had similar pain in a similar area to you (though with a different cause). She did some strength exercises that helped her back enough so she could wear a bra for a couple of hours a day rather than 5 minutes. She only ever posted here the one time, but perhaps you could PM her, let her know about your situation, and find out more details about the strength exercises."
ABraThatFits,3bkm7l,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:50:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know about underwire. I've always preferred underwire, they seem to give better support, and when I have worn them lately, that's not where the problem is. SO I will probably try them.  Thanks for the rec on finding the person with Ehlers-Danlos. My doctor has wondered if that isn't part of my health issue and not fibro because of how flexible I remain with minimal activity. I don't even know how to begin to look into that."
ABraThatFits,3bkm7l,BirdsMilkCake,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:46:30 2015 UTC,"Some of the longlines I've seen have additional wiring or boning, similar to that in a corset, to give them a better shape. I think that's what the previous poster may have been concerned about, because the boning is often in the sides and back.   But, if you or someone you know is handy with a seam ripper, you may be able to take some of the boning out if you find it's uncomfortable or presses too much on your sides."
ABraThatFits,3bkm7l,elektroesthesia,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:17:04 2015 UTC,"I don't know how I'd handle the boning. But on that note, I have found a few women who swear by corsets for there thoracic pain because of the support boning provide. Not a lot of them, but those that do swear by their corset.

ABraThatFits,3bkm7l,EmmaInFrance,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:58:07 2015 UTC,"So that muscle you are describing is called serratus anterior. It looks kind of like a big hand with its wrist under your shoulder blade and the fingers spreading out to grasp the front of your ribs. It goes under the breast tissue as well. Perhaps if you use the name and some clever googling, you might find some kind of exercise or massage that will really help it? I'm sorry I can't be of much help on the other parts of your post, but I can provide that little anatomical knowledge bit. Best of luck!"
ABraThatFits,3bkm7l,EmmaInFrance,2,Tue Jun 30 15:21:42 2015 UTC,"Ah thanks! Yes, that is is!! Or at least some of it. I even have the referred pain down the arms. The pain seems to come further forward than diagrams of the serratus anterior depict. I had been assuming intercostals because of the rib pain, but now I'm wondering, anything else that might be part of that musculature supporting things. People call it the ""MS hug"" because a lot of people with Multiple Sclerosis struggle with it, though I am finding it mentioned with fibromyalgia a lot."
ABraThatFits,3bllvo,TheBrontosaurus,5,Tue Jun 30 05:26:46 2015 UTC,"Panache Sport is the most popular one, comes in bra sizes. You might want to size down in cup if you're particularly FoB as it does have a lot of space on top for FoT breasts. The band is pretty firm so hopefully it should stay snug if you lose an inch or two off your underbust."
ABraThatFits,3bllvo,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Tue Jun 30 06:05:53 2015 UTC,"You won't find one that's affordable. I spent three months searching for one and eventually bought a slightly used one of Braswap(and even that was over $40 with shipping) that was a cup size too large at the time(I've discovered in the couple of weeks since I'm actually well on my way to that cup size so lucky me). Good sports bras are like magic. I had previously dropped a ton of money at Brastop on a Shock Absorber, which actually was pretty alright, but the band eventually started to roll and it's now a band size and two cup sizes too small for me so hence the need for a new one."
ABraThatFits,3bllvo,32Goobies,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:54:51 2015 UTC,"Looking for exactly the same thing, also in 34G. Haven't found one yet, hopefully others have suggestions."
ABraThatFits,3bkdt6,NewlyDisciplined,3,Mon Jun 29 22:57:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, you could be 36E (DDD US) or quite possibly 36F taking into account your leaning bust and counting from band size 36. Both sizes are worth trying. It makes perfect sense, comparing this to the sizes that fit well before weight gain and as you say, they don't fit so well any more.  The only thing that's changed about being in the U.S. is that you'll find lots of bras in U.S. sizing, but you can also easily get bras in U.K. sizing (especially if you shop online) and you have to know which is which. The sizing depends on the manufacturer, not where the bra is sold.  Common brands that you may find in your U.S. size include Wacoal, Natori, and Goddess. In U.S. sizing an E cup is DDD, and the next cup up is often DDDD/G, but U.S. manufacturers are inconsistent with that. Panache and its sub-brand Cleo, Freya, Fantasie, and Elomi are some of the brands that you would find in U.K. cup sizes.  If you have a look at the Shape Guide on the sidebar, and can provide some information on your shape, we can give you some suggestions for bras to try."

I updated my original post with the research I did from the sidebar. I think I'm projected with either full-on-the-bottom or even fullness. I'd like to keep bras under $40 since I'm working on losing weight over the next six months... But I think a few good bras would make me feel loads better. Can't dress for the body I used to have or want to have, unfortunately!"
ABraThatFits,3bkdt6,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:37:51 2015 UTC,"I see Cleo Lily has just been suggested, and you can get it on Amazon for $32. with free shipping and returns in both 36E and 36F Parrot Print. I think you're most likely to wear a 36F, taking into account that you're sizing down a bit in the band. Lily is a discontinued bra but one that has long been recommended as a ""diagnostic"" bra for even, projected shapes, which may work for you. Panache Jasmine and Envy are also good ones to try."
ABraThatFits,3bkdt6,drawingdwarf,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:31:33 2015 UTC,"Tried a bunch of US brands today at Ross, Kohl's, and even Victoria Secret. No good fits yet... Mostly I think most of the bras were too FOT.  But lo and behold, a 36DDD seems like it could fit with the right shape... I looked at it and thought, ""No way. There's no possible way,"" and I was very wrong. Now just to find the right shape. No luck (unsurprisingly) with Vanity Fair, Olga's, Playtex, VS, or Bali. Time to try Amazon!!  Thanks for your help :)"
ABraThatFits,3bkdt6,drawingdwarf,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:31:10 2015 UTC,"I think Goddess_Keira has it covered on sizing and brands. I will say that with a projected shape you'll likely get a better fit in an unlined bra. That's not to say there aren't moulded bras that might work for you, but they're a trickier fit. I think Panache Envy or Jasmine could be good places to start and Cleo Lily/Erin.   If you're looking for cheap, definitely check Ross, Marshalls, Burlington Coat Factory, etc. They may not have much of anything in a 36E but it's definitely worth a look. They'll also tend to have mostly moulded bras. Nordstrom Rack is worth a try if you're near one, and regular Nordstrom can be great just for trying stuff on. Otherwise Amazon is usually a good option."
ABraThatFits,3bl92x,reallysaucy,4,Tue Jun 30 03:22:32 2015 UTC,How exactly are the underwires poking you? Compare underwire marks to your breast root. Are the marks on your breast tissue? Quite a bit behind it? Maybe the underwires are too short or too tall?  As for the emptiness on top bit it's quite normal after breastfeeding as the bra isn't stretchy and can't shrink to fit after breastfeeding.  I would suggest Parfait by Affinitas Casey or Jeanie. They should be available with a decent price and with free shipping and returns on Amazon. They often fit big so try them in both 32F and 32E. The underwires are wider so if narrowness is a problem with Lucy as I suspect they might solve it.  One thing to keep in mind is that any empty space in cups is much more obvious with a molded bra as it doesn't contour to your body at all and expect your breasts to take its shape.
ABraThatFits,3bl92x,noys,2,Tue Jun 30 15:55:53 2015 UTC,"I believe they may be a bit too tall, especially in the Lucy. The marks aren't on my breast tissue. The center gore and underwire are close to my breast tissue but the ends by my armpit may be a bit behind my tissue. It's kind of hard to tell where my breast tissue ends in that area.  I was looking at Parfait Casey Plunge. Is that the same one you were suggesting? Some bras seem to have several versions. I'll be checking out Jeanie too. Thanks for the suggestions! I understand what you mean by a molded bra making gaps more obvious but what do you mean by my breasts taking its shape?   Thanks so much for your help!"
ABraThatFits,3bl92x,noys,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:56:28 2015 UTC,"Casey and Jeanie are extremely similar, just get the one you prefer.  A molded foam bra is a set shape. You can't really change it and it doesn't move unlike a seamed unlined bra. Your breasts either fit the pre-set shape or they don't, there's no negotiation or leeway."
ABraThatFits,3bl92x,M_tridactyla,2,Tue Jun 30 17:48:07 2015 UTC,Got it. Thanks again! Off to do some more Amazon shopping!
ABraThatFits,3bl92x,noys,2,Tue Jun 30 18:06:03 2015 UTC,"Casey and Jeanie are quite wide and very tall/suited to tall roots. If Lucy/Kali are too wide for OP, wouldn't Deco work better? Possibly Fantasie Rebecca?"

ABraThatFits,3bl92x,M_tridactyla,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:57:26 2015 UTC,Casey and Jeanie are better for bottom fullness than Deco. I really haven't seen enough of Rebecca to have a definitive opionion.
ABraThatFits,3bl92x,noys,2,Tue Jun 30 18:43:21 2015 UTC,"I do believe that Freya Marvel might fit you well. I could be wrong, as I'm only starting this journey, but it might be worth a shot. You can get it on Amazon, and for your size, you might be able to get a good deal. Just keep in mind that Freya does tend to have looser bands.  The Marvel is less itchy, but it's not padded. So you'll still be dealing with that issue. Bamboobies reusable heart shaped liners were a life savor for me when I was nursing. I used them long after I needed them for leakage, simply because I was constantly poking through all my bras, all the time."
ABraThatFits,3blebc,throwawayforboobs14,3,Tue Jun 30 04:09:49 2015 UTC,"With a shallow shape the wire width you need determines the cupsize. The wider the wires have to be, the larger the cup.   Take a look at yourself in the mirror, I bet the wires of your 34B bras are sitting on breasttissue, barely covering your nipples. All your breast tissue should be inside the cup.    I am also unsure how to go about telling what bras will fit from looking at them online.   Stick to recommendations from the shallow shape guide for a start. If you are unsure you can post a list of bras (brand, model, size) that you are planning to order and ask for comments.   UK 34E is a US 34DDD, VS carries this size and their bras work for shallow shapes."
ABraThatFits,3blebc,t_maia,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:01:42 2015 UTC,"That makes sense about the cup and wire size. In my current bras my breasts do fill out the cup and the wire is sitting in the correct place underneath the breast. However, I am not busting out of the bra in any sense and everything is covered appropriately."
ABraThatFits,3blebc,t_maia,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:24:37 2015 UTC,"But where does your breast end under your arms and where does your bra end? You say the wires sit where they are supposed to be underneath your breasts, but what about the sides? Do they sit on breasttissue there? They should not.  Have you tried swooping and scooping?   Your tape does not lie and your bust measurements have to come from somewhere."
ABraThatFits,3blebc,t_maia,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:41:37 2015 UTC,I honestly am not quite sure what is breast tissue and what is not. I do have a little fat underneath my band and around my armpits but not a ton. How do I know when breast tissue stops and the rest of my body starts? Is there a good way to tell what's what? I think that is where I am getting confused. I have been swooping and scooping ever since I found this subreddit (maybe a month ago). I am definitely going to try a bra in the recommended size and see if it works. I'm just confused. Thank you for your advice. I really appreciate it :)

ABraThatFits,3bmml7,goodoldfreda,2,Tue Jun 30 18:19:36 2015 UTC,"As a mom of a pre-teen (we live in the suburbs, not a large city) I can say that 28s are not difficult to find in the smaller cups. A 28 D or E, however, is, especially for pubescent girls whose breasts are growing every day with parents who don't want to spend upwards of $40 on a bra that might not fit in 3 weeks."
ABraThatFits,3bki0g,jetsetter9488,8,Mon Jun 29 23:32:23 2015 UTC,"This bra is too big on you. Your measurements indicate that you could wear anywhere from a 32D to a 32E, so it's not out of the question that this would fit better in a 32D  Jasmine is also about as projected as UK bras get and that can make it seem to run big on people who don't have enough projection for it.  One more thing I think I'm seeing is that the wires may be too wide for you. If that is the case, you may have better luck with Polish bras. I'm less familiar with your size range, though, so someone else might have a better suggestion."
ABraThatFits,3bki0g,atheologist,4,Tue Jun 30 02:03:11 2015 UTC,"This bra does seem to be a bit big for you; maybe slightly too projected (although I don't think you're shallow, either) or just needing more fullness all around. But I think you might do well in Panache Andorra in 32DD."
ABraThatFits,3bki0g,Goddess_Keira,3,Tue Jun 30 02:14:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly you don't look super projected and Jasmine is one of the most projected ones out there. Try Cleo Marcie and Lucy, try Freya balcony plunges, try Panache Envy. I'm not sure you should drop a cup size but if you can try any bra in both 32D/DD. This will make diagnosing size or shape issues extremely easy."
ABraThatFits,3bki0g,noys,3,Tue Jun 30 10:00:09 2015 UTC,"Side Note: I'm also curious if my ""pointiness"" is throwing off my measurements?    Would you describe your shape as conical? That is, in a profile view, do your breasts look more like > than ) ? If so, yes, that may play into the issue. Many conical-shaped women report needing to size down a cup compared to their measurements.   That being said, this bra doesn't look like it's TOO too big for you, but rather too projected like the others said. I think try something like Cleo Marcie and grab a 32D and 32DD, just to check."
ABraThatFits,3bki0g,cupcakery,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:31:41 2015 UTC,"It's almost impossible to say that one size only will be the one to try in a certain bra, trying on the size above and/or size below is generally very informative even if none fit, if you have tried on a size down you'd know much more.  I agree that it could be a conical issue."
ABraThatFits,3bj7hi,aghfuck,3,Mon Jun 29 17:46:53 2015 UTC,How's the bottom of the cups?  Are they in your IMF?  Do they stay there?  Any wrinkling or folding of the cups by the bottom underwire?
ABraThatFits,3bj7hi,lcl0706,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:59:54 2015 UTC,"The bottoms of the cups appear to be fine (no folding or wrinkling and are filled out), but how can I check the IMF?"
ABraThatFits,3bj7hi,lcl0706,3,Mon Jun 29 19:04:07 2015 UTC,"Your IMF is where your underneath/bottom side of your breast attaches to your chest wall.  The wire needs to be sitting right in that fold, not below it, no empty space between your bottom root and the underwire.  Molded cups can easily mask issues with this as they are less prone to wrinkling or folding.  Sometimes it's helpful to wear it for an hour or so, take it off, and check where the wire marks are on your torso - they should be right at the bottom of your boob where it meets your chest.  I have enough projection I have to actually lift my boob up to look at my underwire marks, this may not be your case.  I ask mostly because Maddie is a verrry shallow bra, and often times is too shallow for a proper fit.  Generally smaller boobs are more shallow, and you're kinda right on the edge of small band/small cup and small band/medium cup, but shape is just as important regardless of your size.  If a bra is too shallow, your boobs will tend to push it down over the course of a day and you'll lack some support.  Not to mention find yourself wanting to yank it back up where it belongs."
ABraThatFits,3bj7hi,lcl0706,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:14:28 2015 UTC,"Here's the weird thing about the fit, for me: I put it on and everything fits alright, even with a little bit of spillage around the armpits (can't tell if it's just body fat or actually breast tissue in some cases). But after I've been moving around/lying down/doing whatever, there's suddenly waaay more gapping than there was when I first put it on, and the spillage also increases.   The wire marks are a little further down than they need to be (in relation to where the bottom of my breast meets my chest, as well.  So there are a lot of weird issues and I'm definitely going to return the bra ASAP, but I guess I'm not sure if I should go up a band/cup size or just try another model. Looking solely at the numbers on Bratabase, would a deeper cup fix the problem?"
ABraThatFits,3bj7hi,lcl0706,3,Mon Jun 29 19:32:45 2015 UTC,"I would try another model completely.  It sounds like it's a total shape mismatch, honestly, primarily it is too shallow.  It isn't about a deeper cup as much as it is the amount of immediate projection the bra allows for at the underwire at the bottom of the cup (which, when paired with narrower wires as projected cups often are, can result in deeper measurements).  How are the wires on the sides of the Maddie?  Do they look or feel too wide in relation to the side roots of your breasts?  Do you have your 5 measurements posted somewhere or can you add them here?  I don't know how you feel about unlined bras, I know I was opposed as are many who are relatively new here, but the Cleo unlined bras really are the best way to diagnose your shape.  You might even end up liking one lol.  The Marcie, Lily, and Lucy are all available on Amazon.  If anything, try one, post a fit check, and return it.  There are molded/padded bras with more immediate projection than the Maddie, but if you end up having a lot of projection padded bras are harder to come by.  Possibly check out a Deco for the sh*ts and grins of it, Cleo Juna may be a few degrees less shallow than Maddie.  It sounds like you really need a 28 band, and that kinda limits your options.  Fantasie Rebecca is a very different shape than Maddie, but only starts at 30 bands and runs large in the cup... if a 30DD is available it might be worth a shot."

I got a couple of unlined Freyas a while back and my barbells were too prominent for me to wear the bra to work.   I tried a Deco and it fit horribly. Lots of gaping towards the gore and just... ugh.   I listed a few other bras that I've tried over the past year or so.

ABraThatFits,3bj7hi,adulaire,2,Mon Jun 29 23:38:43 2015 UTC,"I actually don't think it looks that bad on you.  If anything, it's a little small and a little shallow.  Cup width looks good, but again it's hard to tell in a molded bra.  The wires are low, but not ridiculously low.  You might get along well with the Juna, but go a size up.  It (and the Maddie really) runs at least a cup size small.  I'd say try a 28F in it to start and see what you think.  It should offer a few degrees more of projection without being any narrower than the Maddie in cup width."
ABraThatFits,3bkfbk,Truant_Muse,11,Mon Jun 29 23:10:02 2015 UTC,"Your measurements do indicate 34F/FF, and that's a common new size for people who were in 36-38C before because those are the widely perceived sizes for medium band/medium bust. In reality, 34F/FF is really close to average. Take a look at the 34 band section of the Bra Band Project, which has quite a few pictures of people correctly fitted into your measured and similar sizes.  Since your Rive Gauche is a t-shirt bra (molded foam), it is most likely masking fit issues. Does the band still feel snug enough if you put the bra on upside down and backwards (so that the cups are on your back)? Are your breasts lifted up, or are they more sitting inside the cups and letting the foam dictate their outward shape?"
ABraThatFits,3bkfbk,braaccount,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:27:30 2015 UTC,"Okay so I'm still feeling deeply skeptical, but let's say I want to experiment and try out the size indicated by my measurements.

ABraThatFits,3bkfbk,braaccount,4,Tue Jun 30 03:36:16 2015 UTC,"You're in the US, right? Amazon is the easiest way to try on bras. Have a look at the Shape Guide and pick out a couple of starter bras that sound suitable for your shape. Order each one in a range of sizes if possible (34E, 34F, 34FF) -- making sure that all of them are eligible for free returns, it varies according to seller -- try them, and return the ones that don't work. Don't get discouraged if you don't find THE bra right away. Trying several bras and keeping notes on what aspect of each bra worked for you and what didn't will get you closer.  If you have a Nordstrom or a Dillards nearby, you can also try on bras there provided that they have your size in stock (I know you can check your local store in advance on Nordstrom's website, not sure about Dillards), although they're usually more expensive than Amazon."

I figured I'd just buy a bra that was recommended in the shape guide for my shape from Amazon and inevitably laugh at how ridiculously huge it was.   Of course, the moment I put it on it was like angels singing from the heavens :) I got pretty lucky on the first try, but I bet even trying on something closer to your measured size will make it seem less far-fetched! Try it out."
ABraThatFits,3bkfbk,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:10:22 2015 UTC,"I'm willing to give it a try and I do feel more comfortable with trying something based on measurements I did myself, it's just a little overwhelming."
ABraThatFits,3bkfbk,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:32:45 2015 UTC,"So this morning while I was getting dressed I tried your suggestion of putting on my bra backwards/upside down. I did this with both my Chantelle bra (36D) and one of my Target bras (36C).  Both still felt snug and I'm pretty sure a smaller band out be uncomfortably tight for me.  That said I don't feel like I really get any lift from the Chantelle bra at all, I'm not sagging, but I'd really like my bra to do a little more for me even if it's not a pushup. Any suggestions? Would you still say try 34s or should I try 36?   Also I took a look at the bra project link.  I think I'm probably in the E or F range, the FF ladies look a lot bigger than me, at least in the picture."
ABraThatFits,3bkfbk,Goddess_Keira,3,Tue Jun 30 13:31:56 2015 UTC,"I think in the interests of nailing down your size/fit as much as possible, you should ideally try both 34s and 36s in at least one bra. Some brands (Panache and its sub-brands) tend to run tight, others (Freya, Curvy Kate, I think Fantasie) run looser, so it's common to need slightly different sizes in different brands. Just be sure to sister-size correctly by going down a cup when going up a band â so if you're looking for a looser alternative to 34F, you want 36E, and it's 34E to 36DD, 34FF to 36F.  It's certainly possible for you to be the 34E-F (36DD-E) range. The calculator is a starting point and can overestimate, although that's often due to soft breast tissue. I didn't want to dismiss 34FF because there's not a big difference between any of your bust measurements (indicating firmer tissue). So, it could be that you're smaller than 34FF, or it could be that you have a different shape than the 34FF wearers on the Bra Band Project. You can see a difference in the 2 whose pictures are up there, actually â the person wearing the red and yellow bras has a more projected (sticking out) shape than the person wearing the beige."
ABraThatFits,3bkfbk,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:22:31 2015 UTC,"Okay, thank you I really appreciate all of thoughtful feedback I've received here. I found a few styles of bra on Amazon that have free returns so I'm going to get them in different sizes and see how I feel.  Thank you again!"
ABraThatFits,3bkfbk,Goddess_Keira,7,Tue Jun 30 17:27:28 2015 UTC,"With your underbust snug measuring 34"", that puts you at a 34 band most likely, once you get into a larger cup size which is indicated by the difference between your underbust and bust measurements. The 6"" difference between your standing bust and your snug underbust put you at 34E, minimum, but taking into account your leaning bust brings you to 34F or FF. Most likely, you'll fit best in a 34F but this can definitely vary depending on the bra and your breast shape.   If you try on your current bras using the ""scoop and swoop"" technique of getting all your breast tissue into the bra, as explained in this blog post, and positioning the bra in your inframammary fold (that's the crease at the base of your breasts where the breasts attach to the torso, often abbreviated here as IMF), you'll most likely see that there's lots of overspill from your bra cups, and you may also notice that your 36 bands feel loose. Also, if you turn your current bras around backwards and do them up in front, with the cups out of the way, you may then notice that the bands are somewhat loose.  So, hopefully that helped to clear up some of the confusion about your measurement results. But with that said, if you're happy and comfortable in the bras you're wearing now, you need not change. There's definitely a trial-and-error process involved in bra fitting, so if you decide to pursue a change in your fit, you may wind up trying a number of bras before you get a sense of what fits best and works best for you."

Trying on in store whatever you can find in your new size range, feeling no pressure to buy, is a good first step (though don't be surprised if there aren't many in-store options). Taking notes and pictures, even if only for yourself, is a good idea. Make sure to do the scoop and swoop and test band fit backwards. You are learning more about what does and doesn't fit. You aren't desperate for bras so you can take your time. Think of this as a learning and experimentation process to start with.   I will suggest, if you order on line don't start with too many bras. Pick one style only in two or three sizes. Compare the fits critically. If you want, you can post a fit check--pictures are completely optional for this."
ABraThatFits,3bkfbk,t_maia,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:19:40 2015 UTC,"Band Size Followup So this morning while I was getting dressed I tried your suggestion of putting on my bra backwards/upside down.

Would you still say try 34s or should I try 36?"
ABraThatFits,3bkfbk,Quo_Usque,2,Tue Jun 30 13:36:46 2015 UTC,"So, a few things.  First, I don't think we've discussed breast shape, so have a look at the shape guide and see if you can get an idea of yours. There are various aids to determining this. For root width, I find the Venusian Glow blog posts to be helpful in figuring this out. (Note; a lot of people get very confused about root width and don't be alarmed if you have trouble figuring it out. Just try to get a general idea.)  Second, did you try the scoop and swoop to see just how much excess tissue is escaping from your cups? You may also be able to tell just from noticing that, when you put your bra on, you have to adjust it a lot to make sure that your breasts aren't falling out the bottom or overflowing in the middle.  Third, about getting more lift: A good fit is, as you might expect, important to getting lift. Good lift also comes from the design of a bra and from it being right for your shape. For the present at least, I'd recommend avoiding push-ups as they're tricky to fit and not widely available over DD cup.   One thing you can expect as you try the larger cup sizes is that your breasts will look different in these bras. A well-fitting bra gives lift, but doesn't usually give much cleavage (which I know you didn't mention). It will cover more breast area than what you're used to and will give you more separation.  I wouldn't 100% rule out the possibility that you may prefer a 36 band, though you're going to find that, say, a 36E feels quite a bit different than your 36C's and D's. You want the cups to hold all of your breast tissue, and when that happens, all the room in the band will be available for your back and ribs. Lots of times, people start out with the larger band and then they may come to find that they prefer a more snug band once they get used to the new size and begin to notice things about how their bra is fitting that they didn't see before. So ideally, I think you would try one style, as I said before, in a few sizes and you should try both 34 and 36 band to convince yourself. It's also completely possible that you may come to prefer a 34 in some brands/models where then bands tend to run stretchy, and a 36 in brands where they run firmer. Bra fitting is more an art than a science, and personal preference is always going to come into play, as it should.  Something you might not be aware of is that cup size is proportionate to band size. Or, in other words, it's not meaningful to speak of cup size without also knowing the band size: for example, the cups of a 40D bra are going to be much bigger than the cups of a 32D bra, even though both bras are 'D' cup."
ABraThatFits,3bkfbk,joanna70,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:58:44 2015 UTC,"First thank you for the detailed response.   I'll take another look at the shape charts and see if I can figure it out, I'd tried once before and felt a little baffled, but I'll try again.  I'm a little unsure what is meant by the scoop and swoop, I did look at the link you shared. Is it just reaching into your bra when you put it on and pulling up your breasts? Because I always do that when I put on my bras and I don't feel as though I'm getting excess or bulging, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding.  I've never liked pushups (padding feels weird) so that's not a problem. though I also really hate full coverage bras (vanity I guess, I just don't like the way they look at prefer demi style cup). Any suggestions there? Or is this just something I will need to experiment with?   Thank you again for taking the time to provide such a detailed response to my questions, I really appreciate it.

That sounds like a good start! Let's see what happens with those before making any more recommendations. :) What did you decide to order, and what sizes? I hope you post a fit check on them.  Basically, yes, scoop and swoop is positioning your breasts in the bra, making sure that all breast tissue is in the bra and also making sure that the underwire is positioned correctly in your IMF, where it should stay if the bra fits properly. Ideally there should be no skin-on-skin contact between your breasts and your chest wall when the wire is sitting properly. You can check this if you look at the marks left by your wires at the end of the day. Are they right up at the underside of your breast where it attaches to the torso, or do they fall below that? If the latter, then the wires are riding down from your IMF which is extremely common when the fit of a bra is off."

When I was 16 I discovered there is a D cup(yes, I've never seen anything that cup size in my town before), so I started wearing 34D untill I found my first 70E/F(European) later. From that point, the most of my visits to bra stores were like: ""Do you have that size? - Good bye!"". There were just a few stores having something to offer. Untill I found ABTF. Discovering I'm actually 30H/HH (UK sizing) gives me an opportunity to wear comfy bras at one side, but totally annigilates any offline-store chances for me. It's almost impossible here to find 30 band at all, and it's almost impossible to find any HH cup here, and I'm pretty sure now there is no single 30H bra in any offline store in my country at all.   The most ridiculous thing is that we share a border with Poland, but I haven't managed neither to find any Polish bra brand shipping to Ukraine nor any Polish bra in my size in real stores (actually, I've seen some Krisline sellers here, but they do not sell anything close to my size)."
ABraThatFits,3bkbjp,yellkaa,2,Tue Jun 30 14:20:48 2015 UTC,"The Polish brands don't ship to the Ukraine? Weird. I'm guessing you aren't close to the Polish border, or you could have tried going straight to the source.  Looking at Comexim and Ewa Michalak's websites, they don't seem to have any restrictions on where they will ship. Ewa charges 27 zlotys for shipping throughout Europe and Comexim seems to charge 12 zlotys no matter where you are (though I only read their shipping policies with the help of Google Translate, so I could have misinterpreted it). You might have to order through email instead of the shopping cart on the site. Have you contacted the companies to see if they will ship to you?"

Since Poland is a part of The Schengen Area, it's pretty hard to get their visa and 'heh, I just want to buy a bra' doesn't count as a reason for those guys in the embassy =) And there is about 600km to the closest Polish border from me =) I don't remember if I checked those two, but the sites I already checked claimed their international shipping includes USA, Australia  and EU while we're not EU yet =)"

ABraThatFits,3bkbjp,yellkaa,2,Wed Jul 1 14:37:04 2015 UTC,Ebay and braswap. Technically a 28H but prefer 30G/30GG and rarely pay more than $20 for a bra. If thy don't fit I just relist them and they get snapped up just as quickly.
ABraThatFits,3bkbjp,azbirdie,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:57:13 2015 UTC,"I wear similar sizes as you and I've found lots of bras under $30 online and at stores. I go super discount shopping a lot. Many people recommended Nordstrom Rack, but I finally went to one two days ago and I still couldn't handle the prices for bras. I'm only willing to pay over $30 for Polish bras at this point. I've gone to every Burlington Coat factory within a 25 mile radius and always came across Chantelle, Natori, Parfait, and b.tempt'd for under $20. I also go to Marshalls, TJMaxx, and Ross. Granted these stores are known to be terribly unorganized but I actually enjoy looking through every rack. I almost always find something in 32E. 30E/F are harder but I've found them before as well."

Before I used to get 32DD because that's what I thought I was according to La Senza/Victoria Secret sizing and that was already hard to find except during sales where these are abundant b/c not as many people buy em. But the cute/pretty bra selection is still way less than the 34/36 bands. But since coming to this subreddit and using the calculator and going on Bratabase, I've realized that my proper size is even harder to find so the only place I can buy is through Amazon really. I live in Canada so its even worse because there aren't that many Canadian bra shops :(  But I'm always keeping an eye out for sales at Butterfly Collection, Break Out Bras, Bare Necessities, Bra Stop, Fig Leaves.  So far my average spend on a bra is $30 USD, so its not too bad.   And like all things bought online, the fit is not guaranteed so I do like a ton of research on Bratabase and compare the bra measurements with my existing ones and finding which users also have similar boobs to me so I can make a educated informed purchase decision. I'm also looking into learning how to do small alterations on bras for better fit â I feel like its worth doing since everything I get is online.  I know Change Lingerie is also in Canada and they have a wide range of sizes and follow european standards and their bras are so pretty. BUT but but why are their cups so wide and shallow? :( even though they make 60/65 bands their bras are not wearable for me."

But then I remember that while matrix bras may be cheap, they're not always of good quality even for the size range they're designed for. Even though bras in our size range may be a bit pricey, they're designed for our size range, and if you take good care of them, they'll last awhile. You'll need several in your rotation, though.  Since you have a swimsuit in your bra size, I would suggest you get some swimsuit cleaner. http://www.amazon.com/Summer-Solutions-Suit/dp/B0017I6WTM. I have a couple bottles of it and I love it. You might be able to find this or something similar locally in a swimwear/sporting goods shop."
ABraThatFits,3biov3,tinytinytiny0,4,Mon Jun 29 15:29:42 2015 UTC,"1) 1-2 cup volumes too small IMO but I'm not surprised, TLBC fits small in the cup. You're sized out.  2) Too projected. Freya balcony plunges won't work for you at all.  3) Also too projected.  Try: Cleo Lucy, Cleo Marcie, Cleo Juna, Cleo Maddie, vertically seamed Freya halfcups in 28D/DD."
ABraThatFits,3biov3,noys,3,Mon Jun 29 18:23:53 2015 UTC,"ok so no lucia. so cute but i wished they went above a C!! what makes you say the freya plunge is too projected? It feels so comfortable and when i swoop and scoop it fits perfectly just as i move around through the day the little wrinkle at the top appears. And what makes you think the 3rd bra is too projected as well? It seems to fit my breasts really well except the straps are waaaaaaay too long because i'm 5'0 so i think once i shorten those it should work?  also since it says youre an expert- would you mind helping me figure out my breast shape?  I looked at the guide and I dont think im shallow, but i'm not super projected either i think i'm somewhere in the middle? and i think i am a 2/5 even? the freya arabella pretty much shows what my shape looks like without a bra.  thanks for the help!"
ABraThatFits,3biov3,noys,2,Mon Jun 29 18:57:20 2015 UTC,They're too projected because there's too much space at the apex and the top edge is cutting in. It's made for a differently shaped breast. Your primary shape characteristic is shallow.
ABraThatFits,3biov3,noys,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:05:29 2015 UTC,"hmmm ok thank you! When looking at the shallow-projected chart on here i feel like my shape more closely matches average projection than shallow though? its tough though because some in the same category look more/less shallow than others. interesting, im learning so much!"
ABraThatFits,3biov3,noys,0,Mon Jun 29 19:22:06 2015 UTC,"Well, the Freya halfcups and Lucy/Marcie are closer to average projection than super shallow.  Maybe I'm too set in the idea, maybe you just have a tall root."
ABraThatFits,3biov3,noys,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:28:36 2015 UTC,ok thank you! So is this freya arabella plunge bra meant for someone with a very projected shape? it's the only 28dd bra I have and i got it for $10 NWT so i'll probably keep wearing it until i find the perfect fit!
ABraThatFits,3biov3,iron-on,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:29:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, Freya balcony plunges are meant for a very projected shape and they will be too closed along the top edge for you.  I'll edit my suggestion, try Cleo Marcie, Freya/Fauve halfcups and Masquerade halfcups. I think I was too set in the shallow idea from how Arabella fit and you need an open top edge to accommodate your tall root but about average projection. EDIT: Also, Curvy Kate halfcups are great for a tall root as they're very open along the top edge. Their projection level is varying though from shallow to about average."
ABraThatFits,3biov3,mailiana,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:54:22 2015 UTC,"ok that makes sense! The upper edge of the lace on this bra is a little snug, but it's not bad enough that i can't wear it while i'm still searching for the perfect one. I will definitely check those bras out! zulilly had a sale on cleo bras the other day but i missed it so i'm waiting for them to come back! I know nude breasts aren't allowed here, but is there some way i can send pictures to someone who knows lots about breast shape to really figure mine out? Before finding out about this subreddit i didn't even think about how people had different breast shapes and i'd love to know exactly what mine are."
ABraThatFits,3biov3,yellkaa,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:37:33 2015 UTC,"I think ""breast shape"" is a bit misleading to be honest. What we want to know is how your breasts act in a bra and we can't tell that based on nude images.   I say try a few more bras and that will clear your shape up. At the  moment it's clear that 1) you are not projected 2) you have a tall root 3) tall roots trump fullness and make your breasts act more full on top. Trying on bras with a more open top edge that are designed for less projection (like the stuff I suggested) will tell us more."
ABraThatFits,3biov3,yellkaa,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:41:58 2015 UTC,"ok great thank you for all the help. So even though i am technically not full on top ( i still feel like i'm pretty even in terms of bottom vs top fullness) should i look more for full on top bras? Is the tall root the reason I tend to gravitate towards balconette bras? those seem to fit me very well. and just to clarify, tall root just means that my breast tissue ends higher up on my chest than on some other people, right? For reference with other bras that fit me (idk if this will help??).... until I recently went up a cupsize, claudette dessous in 30c (with the band altered to be tighter) fit really well, the blush 'whisper' demi bra fits me, and i have an elle macpherson 'windchime' bra that i love as well (32b so i'm a bit too big for it in the cups now unfortunately, but the band is wearable but not great on the tightest hook). My favorite bra is natori feathers in 32c, but i need to get the band altered. I also have another claudette dessous bra but longline in 32c, and i altered the band and it fits perfectly. Lastly betsey Johnson bras seem to fit well, as well as elle macpherson 'dentelle'... unfortunately most of these dont fit me anymore since i went up a cupsize a few weeks ago :( For reference with bras that didn't fit me well: calvin klein perfectly fit 5 way (the band had a front clasp and was racerback i've never been able to find one that fits), claudette sophia icon, and pretty much any victorias secret bra, especially their pushup bras. I dont know if they fit poorly because they were all 32 band bras and i only recently discovered that smaller sizes existed, but i feel like it might be worth mentioning."
ABraThatFits,3biov3,lcl0706,2,Mon Jun 29 21:35:22 2015 UTC,"Here's a way to shorten the straps:  Here's the strap.   The top of the circled part (the part of the strap coming from the front) can be unpicked, shortened, and resewn. (Or even cut away from the plastic ring entirely, if you're in to that kind of thing)  You can even do that to the bottom part of the strap, so long as you remember to account for the slider."
ABraThatFits,3bjc9g,MeltingEvergreen,3,Mon Jun 29 18:21:06 2015 UTC,"34E/F sounds about right from your measurements. Subtracting your underbust from the leaning measurement gives us 41 - 34.5 = 6.5, which is between E and F cup in the UK system. So that's where it comes from! The bras you have now probably don't feel quite as tight as you'd expect because the elastic is stretched out.   You may have a shallow shape with more upper fullness than lower fullness. There are definitely others who also have this shape! Half cups tend to work best for this shape, as the top won't cut into your upper tissue. If you want to try something in an odd discontinued color from Prime, then I'd recommend starting with Freya Instinct padded half cup. (It's not push-up or anything, the British brands mostly use it to mean lined with some thin foam.) Right now it's $18 in 34E and $15 in 34F."
ABraThatFits,3bjc9g,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:55:44 2015 UTC,"Oh that's a fantastic price to try it out! Heck I can't even get a generic sports bra at Target for $15. Really pretty color even if it is discontinued. I'm going to try both, love prime, they'll be here tomorrow! Hopefully that might be a good jumping off point for learning. The Nordstrom anniversary sale is coming up and that's how I got some of the Natori's I have currently. It's a bit of a shocking price difference for the better bras but I certainly recognize the difference."

Even if you never wear strapless clothes...  What bras do you have that you like? I'd suggest finding one from the same brand as your favorite bra."
ABraThatFits,3bkk92,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:37:16 2015 UTC,"Personally I would not recommend a multiway bra. Thereotically they are ideal if you have racerback tops and halter tops and shirts that have weird necklines and/or backs, but there are racerback bras and clips that allow you to ""convert"" a bra to racerback, and personally I feel a real strapless bra will work better than a multiway with its straps removed. I've also had lots of problems removing and changing the straps, and with the connectors sliding out of their spots when the straps are on.  If you do like the idea of being able to convert a bra to racerback and want to let your girlfriend buy you a multiway, I recommend one that has the straps anchored in the front (aka doesn't convert to strapless), because then there's fewer places where problems can occur and you won't end up in a situation where you lost the straps."
ABraThatFits,3bkk92,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:44:15 2015 UTC,"Actually, my gf wants me to get a strapless, a multi way bra was my idea because I thought that served more of a function. She asked me to try on her strapless bra, the band fitted nicely, snug but not restricting. The cup size was off, but we figured that would be the case, we have the same band size but different cup sizes. She thinks a strapless looks better on me, under some of my polo shirts. I guess it's more seamless and disappears. I still don't understand the purpose for a strapless bra for a guy. For women, I totally understand, you have a greater variety of the types of clothing than men do, so it serves a necessary purpose."
ABraThatFits,3bkk92,noys,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:27:26 2015 UTC,If you're set on getting one afterall I suggest checking out our beginner's guide. Getting the size right is quite critical for a good fit in strapless bras.

ABraThatFits,3bjgid,jeansgaplikeamofo,6,Mon Jun 29 18:50:56 2015 UTC,"If you've got a Target nearby, try their Gilligan & O'Malley demis. They're some of the shallowest bras available in 34B. Also, another ABTF member who's in the matrix with a shallow, conical shape reported that she got a good fit out of some clearance Disney-themed bras from Hot Topic. She said it was her best fit ever and the bra was literally only $1! Also, Victoria's Secret might have some decent options as they're pretty shallow too. My incorrectly-sized 32A Body by Victoria Demi bras seemed rather closed on top compared to other 32As I had. So perhaps those might work. The Semi-Annual Sale is still going on if you buy online, so you can get a discount and not have to deal with people trying to measure you!  The reason why you're having issues with a lot of these 34Bs is because the cups are shaped to fit people who don't measure 34B. 34B is such a catch-all size (ask 100 random women their bra size and like half of them will say 34B) that companies like Bali and Maidenform will make the bras to attempt to fit all those women, and in the process, fit nobody. This is ever more common in the plus-size matrix, where bras are constructed to be impossibly tall in the cup in order to catch the quadboob of a woman who'd be more comfortable in something like 36GG."
ABraThatFits,3bjgid,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:19:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions. I do have a Target nearby to test stuff out, and I've ordered a couple things online from Victoria's secret.

ABraThatFits,3bjgid,Goddess_Keira,4,Tue Jun 30 06:04:50 2015 UTC,"Actually, it looks as if you measure best for a 32C but you don't seem to be trying any bras in that size. It certainly isn't hard to find! I'd suggest you re-try the Natori Feathers in 32C, and the Ciao Bella as well. There was also a Betsey Johnson bra that's listed somewhere in the sidebar--Eyelet Lace, maybe? It's discontinued but if you can come across it in 32C, might work well for your shape. All these 34 band bras are probably too wide all around for you and that's contributing a lot to your fit difficulties."
ABraThatFits,3bjgid,bystandling,3,Mon Jun 29 22:17:31 2015 UTC,"I would agree with this--OP, part of the reason a 32 band might feel so tight is because you're trying too small of a cup size! Have you tried a 32 band on backwards to see how the band fits?"
ABraThatFits,3bjgid,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:26:02 2015 UTC,"Yup, I tried a bigger cup size and also backwards, (which is a great tip btw, I think I saw it on this subreddit). I'm completely sure it's the band that's too small."
ABraThatFits,3bjgid,Saskia_C,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:26:18 2015 UTC,"Actually, I also tried 32C/Ds for all these bras. I had similar issues with the cups and band was just so tight, so I didn't think to list mini-reviews for any of them.  I think what's happening is that I'm kind of bony and have no cushioning over my ribcage, so I need a slightly bigger band than my measurements suggest. Also from what I understand, there's a tradeoff between extra support and tightness, but for me the scale tips heavily in favor of not cutting off circulation. It may be different for someone with more breast volume."
ABraThatFits,3bjgid,horkus1,2,Tue Jun 30 06:23:41 2015 UTC,"It's certainly not impossible that you might be better in a 34 band for comfort, and that's a completely valid choice. Where the difficulties seem to be happening is that you aren't happy with how the cups of a 34B are fitting you, plus other issues of straps rubbing and gores digging (admittedly, these things can be and often are a problem even when the fit is ""textbook"" correct).  The Freya Patsy half-cup and its sister cuts are often recommended for shallow shapes. Freya also has pretty stretchy bands, so you might find their 32 bands comfortable. If you're willing to do some ordering and experimenting, I'd suggest getting the Patsy half-cup in a 32C and a 34B and see if either fits, or at least, which of the two fits better.  I notice that you've ordered some VS bras to try and those might work very well for you. VS has stretchy bands also. It would be great to know if you found something from them that works for you."
ABraThatFits,3biub0,deVrl,2,Mon Jun 29 16:11:03 2015 UTC,"Band will be 34 if loose (eg Freya) and 36 if snugger (eg Panache) but everyone has their own preference, try bands on backwards with the cups upside down too to check how tight it is, it needs to stay level when you wave your arms around etc and not ride up, and should be on the loosest hook when brand new.  For actualy sizes I would suggest 36DD/E and 34E/F UK sizes (all info like conversions are in the side bar)."
ABraThatFits,3biub0,joanna70,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:57:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know how to do the manual calculations but if you are going shopping in person, I would start off by trying both 34 and 36 bands in a DD or DDD/E cup and go from there. Hopefully, someone who can do the calculations will be around soon!"
ABraThatFits,3biub0,EmmaInFrance,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:18:27 2015 UTC,I am also 35 snug and 33 tight and I wear a 36 band in most of my bras now. If the band is really stretchy I might bump Down to a 34 band. It's also a matter of preference how comfortable you are with a snug band.

Would you be able to take and post your five measurements (snug underbust/tight underbust/standing bust/leaning bust/lying bust) that we use here? That'll help with pinpointing what size you should be trying.   Anyway, I can see a few problems right off the bat - first, that Charlotte and Maddie are shallow bras, and you need something more projected. As for the mentioned gapping in Lucy, stuff isn't going to stay perfectly in place if you move around; that's normal."

ABraThatFits,3bkiq8,ilikepai,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:36:35 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering why you think wide roots trump projection - I've recently figured out I have pretty wide roots, am FOB-to-even, and projected (like OP). However, when I wear shallower bras (like Freya Deco) I get a lot of folding in the bottom of the cups. I know you're thinking it must be orange in a glass! But strangely, I have a Comexim Geisha where the wires are right up against my breast root. It is perfect... except at the very top of the armpit, the wires sit on my breast roots. The same is true for my Cleo Ellis, and EM HM cut bra. This makes me think projection trumps wide roots. I know that it is bad to have wires sitting on breast roots, but I am just so happy with bras that sit up against my breast root.  I read that you said you can just size up on a shallow bra with wide wires, if it's too shallow. But then won't there be too much gapping at the top? I've found that even sizing up does not combat the shallowness enough."
ABraThatFits,3bkiq8,t_maia,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:37:09 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering why you think wide roots trump projection   In her case it is because the Lucy in 34E is so pointy, indicating a too deep cup in combination with too narrow wires.  But this point might be moot if that bra is really mislabelled.   Regarding projection vs wire width in another case I would probably say different. Brafitting is an art, not an exact science. Everything has to be tailored to the needs of the woman in question.    But strangely, I have a Comexim Geisha where the wires are right up against my breast root. It is perfect... except at the very top of the armpit, the wires sit on my breast roots.   Sounds like you got nike-swoosh shaped roots that are narrow at the bottom and wide at the top."
ABraThatFits,3bkiq8,t_maia,3,Wed Jul 1 03:25:13 2015 UTC,"Parfait Charlotte 34F: There is a picture demonstrating the MAJOR gapping any time I moved.   Gaping is normal with padded bras. The fabric is too stiff to follow your breasts when you move. That said you could probably do with less coverage and a smaller size.    Cleo Maddie in 32FF About one cupsize too large and too tight in the band. With your measurements (Tight ribcage 78.7 cms, rounded down to the next 5 is 75 -> 75/34 band) stick to a 34 band unless the band of the bra is very stretchy.  If you wear your bras too tight you'll only damage them and the tight band does funny things to the cup.   Cleo Lucy in 34E with an extender   From the shape you get in this bra I would say it is too deep in the cup and too narrow. You need bras that have a shallower shape than Lucy.    the stiff lace on the top strictly gaps again.    The beauty of that lace is that it can follow the contour of your breast, so if the lace is a bit loose it does not matter. Nobody can see it under a shirt.    That said, you could probably give Cleo Neve a try. It is usually not recommended because it is a tricky fit, but you could give it a whirl. Other older Cleo Plunges (like Penny) are also worth a shot.   Other bras that come to mind are the Gossard Glossies Plunge and the Gossard Superboost. Natori Feathers /Chantelle C Chic might be worth looking at because they are so shallow.    I gap in every single bra I've worn in my life to the point where I feel extremely discouraged to even bother any more.   With certain breast shapes that is unavoidable.  I know it can be discouraging (especially if you think of yourself as having small breasts), but please realise that bras are made for averages. But you and your body are not an average, so just with all clothes you buy of the rack there is a point where you compromise.  Good Support, check. Comfortable, hell yes, so check. Wire width fits, check. Straps fit, check. Gore tacks, check. Volume is right, not too small and not too large, check. Nice shape under a shirt, check. Annoying little gap that I always have in all bras - I don't like you, but I won't send this super comfortable and pretty bra back just because you happen to show up! I'll hide you under clothes and don't you dare show up until I take my shirt off again."

More investigation is certainly going to be needed as the lace in the Lucy becomes almost unbearably itchy as I wear it through the day and no amount of wire bending in the gore relieves the terrible digging. I feel as if my chest is wrapped in straw.   I had the opportunity to try on a Natori Feathers at my local Nordstrom Rack and really didn't like the look of it. Some people are fans of the mesh around the neckline but I certainly wasn't. Probably didn't help that it was a nude, but my breasts looked... Almost aged in it."

The key here is wire width. You need wide wires. To get wider wires you can either go up in cupsize or go for bras that have wider wires.   If you need wide wires but cannot fill out larger cups, you have to go the other way.  Going for bras with significantly wider wires means changing the shape of the cup towards wider and shallower, it is the only way to keep the same volume in the cup.   Additionally the bras recommended for shallow shapes are designed for a mix of both types of breasts so they work for non-shallow shapes too.   You probably have to play around with shapes and sizes a bit until you find ""the one"".    As far as the Maddie goes, the band size of 32 felt perfectly comfortable, had I gone to 34, wouldn't I be having to wear it on the 2nd or tightest notch?    If you prefer a 32 band you can wear it like this, it is your body and your money and your bras. But in your photos the band of the Maddie fits oddly, it sits at a weird angle and looks quite strained. Plus you are wearing the 34E Lucy with an extender?!?   More investigation is certainly going to be needed as the lace in the Lucy becomes almost unbearably itchy as I wear it through the day    Panache adds a lot of starch to their bras. Some people react to that and it makes the lace itchier than it could be. If I buy a new Tango (I currently own 5, had 7 once) I have to wash it at least 3 times until the lace stops itching and becomes soft.   no amount of wire bending in the gore relieves the terrible digging.   Cleo bras have relatively hard wires  that many women in smaller sizes find uncomfortable. They are necessary in G+ sizes though, so it can be a toss up between the two. Freya and Anita have softer wires, take a look at those brands."
ABraThatFits,3bizez,30FFthrow,5,Mon Jun 29 16:48:16 2015 UTC,"Freya plunge balconies are weird, weird beasts. Bratabase doesn't have the cut information up for this one yet, so I can't give you a list of clones to avoid, but know that there are probably at least 5 or 6 other bras out there that will fit you just like this one.   Not only do you have wrinkling at the top, you've got some serious wrinkling at the bottom. The wires are pretty far out of your IMF. Looking through your blog, you seem to have some degree of wrinkling right there near the underwire in pretty much all the unlined bras. When you put the bras on, are you specifically placing the wires into your IMF? Most people kind of have to shove them up there. If you are doing that and they sink into that position during the day, or they wrinkle a bit even when you put them in your IMF, I think you may need more overall projection or a different wire shape."
ABraThatFits,3bizez,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Mon Jun 29 18:27:58 2015 UTC,"Oh I didn't realize you had to place them there, I guess I thought the wires would sit where they should if they fit."
ABraThatFits,3bizez,crazymusicalgenius96,4,Mon Jun 29 18:35:59 2015 UTC,"It's not too hard to do, luckily, but it radically changes the way a bra fits. When you're swooping and scooping, feel for the crease where your breast root ends and the rest of your abdomen starts. Put the wire there, then swoop and scoop. Readjust the wire so it's up there if necessary, then stand up. Usually my last step is to pull any random skin that may have gotten stuck in the cups out of the way by gently pushing down on my ribcage skin, but I don't know if other people do that. If the wire slides back down to where it normally sits (as I suspect it will on your shallower bras), then you know there's an issue with that bra."
ABraThatFits,3bizez,noys,6,Mon Jun 29 19:02:15 2015 UTC,"Bras are not sentient, they don't know where they have to be on your body, you have to position them yourself. When they fit well they'll want to stay in the correct position once placed there."
ABraThatFits,3bizez,noys,6,Mon Jun 29 18:57:57 2015 UTC,"Um, are wearing underwires way below your breasts, like over an inch too low.  This prompted me to check out your older blog posts. You are wearing almost all of your bras too low. The underwire should sit exactly at your breast root, not below it. You shouldn't have any space between underwires and breast, underboob/skin on skin contact under breasts, fabric lying flat under your breasts, or empty space or folding at the bottom of a molded cup."

Yes it changes with styles. You have a full on bottom shape and need a significant amount of volume in the bottom cup. If the bottom cup is too small for you, your breasts end up pushing the bra down.   Panache Andorra Plunge has a relatively small bottom cup."

What might be happening with the size then is that the band increases the overall volume so that it more or less fits you.  It's hard to know what similar bras to recommend without knowing your shape, especially with a molded bra, but Fantasie Rebecca and 4510 (Smoothing T-Shirt Bra) look similar in design. Try them in 30H."

ABraThatFits,3bi8ix,joanna70,4,Mon Jun 29 17:46:58 2015 UTC,"The trouble is unless we know that specific bra we just can't help much without shape information.  HOw much have you managed to glean from the Shape Guide?  Have you tried leaning forwards 909degrees and seeing if nipples point to head, floor or knees?  Can you measure the wire width (as per bratabase.com) and let us know if the wires seem the perfect width, or a little wide (maybe up to 1/2"" wider than your breast root), a little narrow or way too wide?"
ABraThatFits,3bi8ix,joanna70,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:02:28 2015 UTC,"I've gone through the shape guide a couple of times and tried on the ""diagnostic bras"" and got conflicting results when I first found abrathatfits. When I get home from work, I'll try it again and measure the wires too. Thanks for responding!   Edit: I think I'm a 3/5? May be? When bent over, my nipples point more toward my knees for sure- I almost can't see them. The cups measure 5 and 7/8"" across. They may be a titch wide- under my breasts its perfect, but it slants a bit far back (like the angle points toward my back, not vertical)."
ABraThatFits,3bi8ix,TheDodgyStalker,2,Mon Jun 29 17:49:26 2015 UTC,"The leaning test is best in front of a mirror if you have a full length one :).  So if 5 and 7/8 is a fraction wide then you could go down a smidge, and up a little more, but 5 and 1/2"" will be too narrow for sure, so it gives you parameters.  Deco is shallow on the bottom and FOT/tall, so you probably need more projection overall but especially on the bottom as you're pushing the wires down.  If this happens in other bras pull the wires up properly, tighten the straps a little and see if they'll stay up while you wave arms vigorously etc.l  If the wires slide back down then the cup/wire is wrong."

ABraThatFits,3bik75,Moonforehead,5,Mon Jun 29 14:51:55 2015 UTC,"Your measurements suggest a 30G/GG to me, with sister sizes of 32FF/G if you find a 30 band too tight.  32GG seems overestimated.  It's possible your 32FF is just stretched out.  I assume you're swooping and scooping.  It's also not unheard of to be a cup size smaller in unlined bras vs padded ones.  I find that true with the Freya and Cleo unlineds I've tried.  What 32FF bra are you currently wearing?  If you're comfortable posting a fit check it could possibly help.  I'm a visual person, others here are better at dispensing advice based on written descriptions."
ABraThatFits,3bik75,lcl0706,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:59:31 2015 UTC,"I'm currently wearing a flirtelle bra (please don't ask which kind. Like I said its been 2 years hehe), but I also wear a lot of curvy Kate bras. I had to manually do the math since the calculator doesn't want to load for me. My cups are completely full scooping and swooping, but the band seems to ride down a notch and leave me with a red mark below my breast line. I'll have to do a fit check when I throw on a bra without any holes, but from all I can tell it seems that my bras are fitting correctly but close to not.   The padded bras still had top room when I bought them, the most recent being decemberish. Now I'm about to overspill and even worse, one is wrinkling on the bottom :(  At least you think the 32gg might be an overestimate, which is a relief. It's not like it's my bleeding time so going up possibly two cup sizes was like the initial shock all over again!"
ABraThatFits,3bik75,lcl0706,2,Mon Jun 29 15:11:26 2015 UTC,"Wrinkling at the bottom of a bra usually indicates the bra is too shallow for you.  It's more common in larger cup sizes to be projected vs shallow, but I've also seen exceptions to that rule.  Unfortunately, the vaaaast majority of padded bras on the market are fairly shallow.  The exception I've found in our size range is Cleo Juna - which as you go up in the cup it gets narrower and more projected.  It also has a stretchy band and runs at least one cup size small, so if you ever get the desire to try it, I'd start with a 30GG.  Curvy Kate is almost universally wide wired and shallow, even in their unlined options.  That has changed somewhat for the SS 2015 season, but since you haven't bought bras in forever I imagine you don't own any of their newer cuts.  Curvy Kate's padded bras (smoothie, starlet come to mind) are impressively shallow.  Be sure your underwires are sitting in your IMF and not riding down your torso below where your boobs attach to your chest wall.  Pull them up in there when you put the bra on.  If they don't stay there, it's a shape mismatch.  You mentioned your band tries to ride down, and bands that are too big will ride up your back more so than down your chest.  Anything riding down your chest is also an indication the bottom of the cups are too shallow, and are being pushed down by your boobs which are looking for more room by the underwires."
ABraThatFits,3bik75,lcl0706,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:04:41 2015 UTC,"That's one of the things I never knew about before I started reading in this sub, projection and roots and whatnot. I did double check and find out which bra (yeah it's only one of my padded ones) started wrinkling. It's a curvy Kate starlet which is a moulded bra I guess.   The band ride down is maybe 1/8"" so maybe it's possible that my IMF is a bit lower than I thought. My transitions in my chest are very smooth so it can be tough to tell, like I was having a problem determining narrow or wide roots and I think I have wide roots, but I'm not 100% sold on that.   Is the Cleo Juna a padded bra? If so I'll have to take a look at purchasing some. I had only bought 3 since they didn't fit quite right in the beginning but now I guess all the time of my boobs trying to destroy them is catching up. Any suggestions for brands to try for projected breasts that you recommend? There's a bra boutique about an hour from me I read about on here that I'm planning on visiting in the near future but my brand knowledge is limited.   Also, do you think lepel is good for a projected fit? I have 3 lepel fiore bras that I like to wear on the weekend that don't provide me enough security (damn 2 hook bras!) to feel comfortable wearing them in high motion environments but if it's a brand that is good for my breast shape id be willing to search for a 3/4 hook for my peace of mind."
ABraThatFits,3bik75,lcl0706,2,Mon Jun 29 20:24:26 2015 UTC,"Juna is a padded bra.  Your IMF should be cut and dry, no question - it's where your boob attaches to your chest wall on the bottom.  I have smooth transitions everywhere else and had a hard time determining my side roots but the IMF should be crystal clear.   Laugh at me all you want, but here's a little diagram-thing I made:  http://imgur.com/LrXugqr  Where that red line points is where your wires should sit - no space, tissue or wrinkling in between, no question, and in a well fitting bra they will stay there.  The Starlet is super duper shallow, it's no wonder it's wrinkling or folding on you.  The best padded bras for projection are the Polish brands Comexim and Ewa Michalak.  Sometimes they go up for grabs on braswap, and usually get taken fast.  I would start in a 65 or 70 G-GG in Ewa and a 65-70K-L in Comexim.  They also have narrow wires, Comexim is narrower than Ewa.  You can order 3 hooks on those by request.  From what I've found thus far, the only brand that makes 3 hook closures consistently in our size range is Curvy Kate.  I know very little about Lepel, never tried and I don't see many people trying them around here.  Hope any of this helps lol."

My curvy Kate bras seem to fit pretty well, up until now my only complaint had been waiting to get the bras after ordering lol! I'm gonna see what this little boutique has and try on some sister sizes like 30g/gg and 32g.   I'm just glad most of my bras fit, even if my beautiful ones don't ( I didn't think when I ordered my favorite push up bra on clearance to buy a size bigger). I'll take a look at those polish brands you recommended, do they size differently?"
ABraThatFits,3bjjim,swagphie,6,Mon Jun 29 19:12:14 2015 UTC,"US and UK are the same up to DD, for the most part. So your bras are all 32A and 34A.   The calculator is putting you closer to 28DD (thanks to your leaning measurement!) which will be slightly less expensive than being stuck with The Little Bra Company. You could also try 30D if you like, which will be easier to find in department stores.   I'm also from the LA metro area, so the first thing you should know about shopping for bras here is that we have more Nordstroms than pretty much anywhere else. Seriously. There are 21 within a 100-mile radius of me. That doesn't include the Nordstrom Racks, either! They should have a reasonable number of 30Cs and 30Ds in stock, but you can check the Nordstrom website to see what each store nearby has available in your size.  You might be particularly interested in Aerie bras, which are generally cheaper than most other full-bust brands and come in 30A-D.   I don't know how much of a hike going to Seal Beach would be for you. If you don't want to deal with the 405 then that's okay! But there's a great little boutique there called Dahlia Boutique that carries 28D/DD, as well as pretty much any size you want in 30 bands. The people there were super friendly and let me try on everything they had that was even remotely close to my size. They carry Affinitas, Parfait, and Claudette, which aren't quite as expensive as the British brands because they're from the US. Typical retail price is ~$40. (They do carry some British brands as well.)   If you try something on in Nordstrom or another boutique that you really like but it's really expensive, then look for it on Amazon or Ebay."

Why do these things have to be so expensive?! I think I'm going to just go to every store in my small town and try on whatever I can. I might hit gold in winners/the bay, at least for now."

Another one that I forgot to mention that might work if we happen to be shaped similarly is the b'tempt.d by Wacoal Ciao Bella balconette - it's less expensive and cute and fit me, too. What I've learned from reading here over the last few weeks is that you can find deals by watching for the PSA's on here about sales. I've been adding things to my Amazon cart and watching for the price to drop, and some of them have free returns. Also people sell bras on Bratabase for cheap, though I haven't bought one. I went to a quality lingerie boutique in my city and since they took the time helping me, I bought two from them for regular price, but since then I've been snooping online and Nordstrom Rack to see what else I may want to buy in the future."
ABraThatFits,3bgx1x,myboobsneedshelter,4,Mon Jun 29 03:06:55 2015 UTC,"Don't go up in band size if the 36 was comfortable! Maddie can be a hard fit (a bit shallow) so you might have to give up on her.  Maybe try a Freya Deco if you're looking for that smoothness under a shirt. The sizing is pretty universal across UK brands, it's just bra shapes that can throw off fit. 36FF is probably going to be too big in any shape though if you were swimming in the 36F Maddie. Try some others in 36F. What were your actual measurements?"
ABraThatFits,3bgx1x,sadie0922,2,Mon Jun 29 04:24:25 2015 UTC,"You need to look at the details of the fit, it sounds like Maddie is the wrong shape for you.  Also Maddie comes up one size (or occasionally more) small on most people, hence the seamed bras you tried were too big.  Sounds like you're 36E/F, could you please post your five measurements and your assessment of your shape (if you were directed to Lucy and Tango then I'm guessing you're FOB, and Maddie is unlikely to work)?  If you are projected then the calculator may well have overestimated your size which is why we always recommend posting your measurements on here to get a second opinion, plus then looking up each bra you're considering ordering to check its shape and sizing.  Then, if you can, an idea of how wide the wires in each of those Maddies are, I'm guessing that once the cup was big enough (too big) the wires were more than a little too wide on you.    If you are ever in doubt about band size then try the bra on backwards and upside down and see if the band still feels right.  Also did you fully swoop and scoop when putting the bras on?"
ABraThatFits,3bgx1x,joanna70,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:55:54 2015 UTC,"I am a 36FF and my best smooth under shirts bra so far is the Fantasie Rebecca. I wish it brought me inwards and upwards as well as my Cleo bras, but it gives a decent shape and doesn't show."
ABraThatFits,3bgx1x,shortieblitz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:59:02 2015 UTC,"I ended up struggling with the Maddie for a while - bought it in a 34H, and the band was uncomfortably tight, but the cups were perfect. Once I lost some weight, the band fit... but then the cups were too big.  Gah.  If trying the next cup size up didn't end up working, the Maddie might be a lost cause...  Hopefully you can find a t-shirt bra that works for you!  I'm still hunting for one, myself."
ABraThatFits,3bgx1x,wandering_denna,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:50:38 2015 UTC,"The 36F had almost all the signs of a good fit (for example, gore touching sternum, band straight across the back, overall fairly comfortable), I was floating around inside the cups and didn't fill them out.    This could be a classic case of orange-in-a-glass where slightly too narrow wires prevent the breasts from getting into the cup of the bra.  Only way to test whether it is an OiG is to try the Maddie one cupsize up in 36FF (the size the calculator gave you). If that one is too large too you can give up on Maddie.    However, I tried the bra in 36E, and my boobs overflow just a little and the gore doesn't touch my sternum.   This indicates a too small and too shallow cup. Assuming 36E is the correct size for you, a slightly more projected bra like Cleo Juna or Cleo Marcie/Lucy would probably do the trick.    Just for extra information, I also tried Panache Tango in 36F and 36FF (cup size was too big/boobs didn't fill out the bra and the details could be seen through my shirt),   Tango is a good bra - in 32-42 GG-HH. It does not work well in smaller sizes. If you have a shallow shape (very common in the 36E/F range) the Tango will look too large even when it is the right size.    and the Cleo Lucy in 36FF (same problems as the Panache Tango).   Cleo Lucy is shallow-shape friendly because it has a size adjusted shape, narrow and projected in larger cupsizes and shallow and wide in smaller. It would be interesting to try the Lucy in more sizes than just 36FF.   That said a t-shirt bra that works well in your size range is the Anita Rosa Faia Twin. Note that Anita uses EU/US sizing, so their 36F is a EU 80F or UK 36E."
ABraThatFits,3bh0cn,FreyaKitten,2,Mon Jun 29 03:40:01 2015 UTC,"There are quite a few wire free sports bras available in an 8E, you just have to look a bit harder for them. Whereabouts in Australia are you?"
ABraThatFits,3bh0cn,Shepherd8920,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:23:04 2015 UTC,"Usually Canberra, currently Perisher (yay snow season!)"
ABraThatFits,3bh0cn,Shepherd8920,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:04:04 2015 UTC,"So Googling reveals a real lack of suitable boutiques in Canberra which may stock anything in an 8E. Also there's no point looking at Myer, David Jones or any other department store for an 8E :( The closest you would get there would be a sister size of 10DD, which you may or may not be comfortable in.   Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane have boutiques where you can find the Shock Absorber and Panache wire free sports bras. And like the below post, you can also order these online.   Sports shops such as Rebel carry compression-type crop top sports bras in a size 8, so that may also be worth a look if they will provide enough support for you."
ABraThatFits,3bh0cn,Goddess_Keira,2,Wed Jul 1 03:01:53 2015 UTC,"I don't know how easy it is for you to buy in-store, if that's what you're hoping to do. However, a quick search tells me that there are several wire-free options made by Shock Absorber and Moving Comfort, as well as the Panache Sport wire-free version that are all available in 30E, the UK equivalent of 8E. These would be medium to high-impact bras, and most offer a combination of compression and encapsulation sizing. If you're wanting a low to medium impact compression-type bra, the kind that are usually sold in small/medium/large, etc., then you may just want to move up a size from what you're now wearing. Champion and Nike make good bras of this type. I've seen quite a few positive comments about Nike compression sports bras.  As you seem to be a first-time poster to the sub, welcome--did you do your measurements using our method? We generally encourage new posters to measure themselves according to the beginner's guide on the sidebar and post a measurement check, so that we can hopefully make the best possible recommendations."
ABraThatFits,3bh0cn,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:09:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, I used your calculator both a while ago (getting the 8B) and this week (getting the 8E). Never really felt the need to post before :-) just to read and get comfortable."
ABraThatFits,3bh0yz,Boob-rex,4,Mon Jun 29 03:46:29 2015 UTC,"I quite like both, Marcie more than Lily. It looks like Lily's wires are slightly narrow on top. Both bras are quite front and center, this has the side effect of having a more forward shape from the side but the are very slimming from the front. Bras with a more flatter side profile will look wider from the front. Pick one...  Try Panache Envy. Maybe Panache Andorra plunge (not full cup). You might like newer unlined Curvy Kate bras like Jewel. Freya Deco plunge and Parfait by  Affinitas Casey/Jeanie could work.  If you feel like hunting on eBays try to find Cleo Sasha/Alexa and Masquerade Capella (this one in 36E).   Tutti Rouge Liliana is one of the few bras that's minimising from both front and side. Change Lingerie/The Intimate by Britney Spears full shaper cut is another.  EDIT: Oh, Freya Rio/Gem and Pollyanna/Faye based bras are also worth a try."
ABraThatFits,3bh0yz,noys,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:17:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your recommendations.  You clearly articulated my current issue:  Do I want to look slimmer from the front, and bustier from the side? Or slimmer from the side, while my breasts get smashed and live in my armpit?  I do think a front and center shape is more flattering, but it may take some getting used to.  While I may not have gone through ""sticker shock"" after calculating my correct size, I think the Marcie and Lily caused me to go through  a bit of ""shape shock.""  Thank you again for your recommendations!"
ABraThatFits,3bgj05,ineedbrahelp334,3,Mon Jun 29 00:56:19 2015 UTC,"The calculator is overestimating your size. I recommend starting with a 38G.   You may need to go up to a 40 band, in which case your size would be 40FF, but most people in your size range prefer a smaller band and find it gives their breasts more support.   Check out the offline retailer list for stores in your area that might carry 38G. Nordstrom should have a good selection if there's one near you.   Keep in mind that the calculator and this sub use UK sizing, so when you go shopping you'll need to look at the UK size on tags. At Lane Bryant your size would be 38H (with a sister size of 40G)."
ABraThatFits,3bgj05,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:11:12 2015 UTC,"I think there is a Nordstrom somewhere near me, and I will definitely check out the retailer list as well. So I could still shop at Lane Bryant though? Is 38H my US size, then? I am a bit confused about conversions. Thank you, by the way! Sorry for my noobness."
ABraThatFits,3bgj05,hurrrrrmione,4,Mon Jun 29 01:16:47 2015 UTC,"The main reason why the calculator and this sub use UK sizing is US sizing isn't consistent. Different US brands label their cups differently after DD, so you wouldn't be a 38H in every US brand that carries that large a cup.   The other reason is that very very few US brands go beyond a DDD or DDDD cup (UK E and F, respectively). UK brands overall have a much bigger selection of sizes. So it's just more convenient to know your UK size if you're shopping for UK brands, and just look for the UK size on tags when you're shopping in stores.   Lane Bryant's largest cup size is H, so if you end up needing a larger cup you're out of luck. But there's no harm in starting your search there."
ABraThatFits,3bgj05,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:28:19 2015 UTC,"Ah, that makes sense. I suppose it would be easiest for me to start at Lane Bryant. Trouble is, I'm not sure if I'll be able to tell the difference between a bad fit and the wrong shape. The diagrams are also confusing to me, so I am unsure of my shape. I looked at projected vs shallow, but it's really hard to tell which one I am because all of the drawings are of thin girls and pretty far from my size range."
ABraThatFits,3bgj05,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:34:11 2015 UTC,A lot of people are unsure about their shape even after looking at the diagrams and pictures. That's okay. We can help you with that and also with determining if a bra does or doesn't fit if you try on some bras and post a fit check either showing us pictures of how the fit is or describing how it fits. I also recommend reading this and following the links for learning what makes a good fit versus a bad fit.
ABraThatFits,3bgj05,hurrrrrmione,2,Mon Jun 29 01:39:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much. I appreciate it. From what I've read on the chart you linked me to, I have quite a few issues with my current bras. Quadboob, gore doesn't tack, wires are sitting too low, empty space between my breasts and the sides of the wires, band riding up a bit. Are these all size issues, or could some be shape issues? Would it help if I posted a fit check for my current bras?"
ABraThatFits,3bgj05,Flavorbaby13,3,Mon Jun 29 01:48:33 2015 UTC,"Wires sitting too low is a problem with how you're putting on/wearing the bra, unless you're putting it on right and the wires slide down after wearing it for a bit. Try scooping and swooping as shown in this blog post (heads up: this will almost guaranteed increase the amount of quadboob you're getting).   Band riding up means the band is too big. Quadboob almost always means the cup is too small.  Empty space could be either a size issue or a shape issue, as could the gore not tacking.   A fit check isn't necessary for your current bras. We wouldn't be able to help you besides confirming that they don't fit and recommending you try on bras in the size you're measuring at."
ABraThatFits,3bgj05,t_maia,2,Mon Jun 29 01:54:24 2015 UTC,I definitely do the scoop and swoop. Here I thought I invented that technique! I find that the wires just kind of slide lower and lower throughout the day.
ABraThatFits,3bg7q7,onthefenced,2,Sun Jun 28 23:11:51 2015 UTC,"Cleo Kira is a Marcie clone, so it makes sense that you wouldn't fill out the top if you're more on the FoB side.   Bravissimo Alana is FoB-friendly and relatively wide in the wires. Unfortunately, it's an unlined seamed bra. It has many clones that come in various colors and patterns. If you're worried about nipples showing, I would think that Bravissimo carries nipple covers. If they don't I'm pretty sure they're available on UK Amazon."
ABraThatFits,3bg7q7,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:11:50 2015 UTC,"I think Satine is a FOB bra, not sure about the wire width, but it's padded or at least lined."
ABraThatFits,3bg7q7,joanna70,2,Mon Jun 29 18:02:12 2015 UTC,"What happens in specific bras when you go smaller, to try and avopid the gaping?:  I presume wires get too narrow, but it would help to name the models and sizes that you've tried and what the specific problems were.  If you've not gone down a size then it may simply be that you're trying on bras in too large a size.  The smallest indicated by the numbers is 32E, the largest is 32FF/G, it's always good to try at least two sizes.  What size is your Maddie for example and how does it fit?"
ABraThatFits,3bg7q7,joanna70,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:04:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this suggestion. Today I tried on the Cleo Phoebe and went a size smaller, to 32E and it fit! This is a style that usually would be empty on top so I was delighted that it fit (and I love the neon color).  In the Cleo Maddie I have 32F but should probably go up to 32FF (this was my first bra that fit and now I've gotten a bit bigger). In terms of shape, it fits very well. I also got the Cleo Koko Flirty in 32FF.   My favorite bras are Freyas, I think. I just got delight in 32F and I love it. I think it's a teeny tiny bit too small in the cup but 32FF had too much gapping. I also have Freya Deco with the same size/issue, and got a Freya Deco Spotlight (not sure if it's exactly the same as Deco or not). I tried Freya Vibe and the cups were empty on top.  Next time I do a fitting I will take notes on the ones that didn't fit, because I have a hard time remembering."
ABraThatFits,3bg7q7,joanna70,2,Mon Jun 29 22:11:42 2015 UTC,"In too much of a hurry to say much, but take photos including one of the label, you don't have to post them but it tells you a lot.  Until you're in the right size you can't judge shape, so if you should size up in the cup then you have to do that before you can call on the cup being the perfect shape.  Deco will gap as it's for tall or FOT boobs, the Delight being a decent fit must mean it is a fraction more closed on top on you.  Apparently Idol may be a decent FOB fit."
ABraThatFits,3bg7q7,aintitso,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:18:22 2015 UTC,"I tried Idol and it fit well, but the cup was too full coverage for my taste. I wear a lot of t-shirts and the top of the cup was visible in a v-neck. Next time I will take photos, thanks for the tips!"
ABraThatFits,3bg7q7,joanna70,2,Tue Jun 30 08:40:20 2015 UTC,"I'm FOB and have stuck to lace bras. Balconettes are my favorite. I don't have many molded ones. Just two- Gossard Superboost and Parfait (not sure the exact style). I did end up buying a Freya Deco and it did not work out because of me being an FOB. Like you, I can't fill the top. I've found it easier to by anything that's not already padded. They end up not working out for me at all and I don't have the money to be going back and forth with buying bras. Hope this helps a bit. I've stuck to Freya and recently bought a Curvy Kate lace one that fit fantastic."

Perhaps the Patsy plunge balcony cut would suit you better, it's got shorter cups than the other ones.

ABraThatFits,3bea7g,nidena,31,Sun Jun 28 12:22:14 2015 UTC,"I was a manager at an aerie. We had a couple of people who understood that our bra measuring system wasn't putting people in the best fitting bras, BUT if you measure someone not per company policy, you can get in lots of trouble. That's what a lot of people on here don't realize. The store associate isn't able you meausre you any other way without breaking company policy. So don't go in there looking to 'enlighten' them.   Next, at all of the retail stores I've worked at, nothing you suggest to management will ever get anywhere. There is no one for us to talk to about adding more bra sizes, no one to give customers suggestions to. The sales person, will probably say they'll pass along your suggestion, for customer service purposes, but they can't and won't.   Lastly, most of the people at your standard chain bra shop are in their late teens/early 20's and just simply do not care.  I also have a question, why, if you already know your size do you want them to measure you other than to try and prove them wrong?  I'm not saying any of this is fair or right, but it's how it is. Hopefully one day we will be able to change the methods across the board, but until then, don't be rude to your poor teenage associate."
ABraThatFits,3bea7g,LadyAnju,33,Sun Jun 28 16:02:24 2015 UTC,"I don't go into these stores asking to be sized. Here's how it goes:   Goes into a store to buy panties or non-bra items.   Salesperson: Hi, can I help you?  Me: No thanks, just getting some other stuff.   S: Oh well have you tried our blah-blah huge pushup bra?   M: No thanks, not interested. You don't carry my size anyway.  S: Yes we do.   M: No you don't.   S: Why don't I measure you?  M: No thank you. I wear a 28FF which fits, and I know you do not carry that.   Sometimes they just roll their eyes, say ""okay"" and walk away. Other times they get pushy saying I can't possibly be that size."

I did have to get nasty with one sales person because she was trying to push me into sister sizing until I happened to fit into something they carried.

I'll be shopping for undies or pajamas and an employee will ask if they can help me find a bra, I'll politely tell them they don't have my size, they ask my size, I tell them, they ignore my stated size and keep assuring me they have 32 bands and ""all the way up to DDD!"" so they definitely have something that will fit me better than what I'm wearing. I make excuses about not having time for a fitting or having just bought tons of bras but sometimes I'm really tempted to let the really pushy ones try fitting me and fail spectacularly. The VS measuring instructions give me 38B-D (depending on the bra I'm wearing), that's just going to be disastrous on my 28K/26KK self."

For me, it's never been about proving anyone wrong. At the independent boutiques I've visited (the only stores that advertise carrying bras in my size), being measured in-store is effectively required before being able to try on bras. Most of the bra merchandise is kept in drawers rather than on the browsing floor, and fitters bring bras to customers in the fitting room.   When I've gone and had fitters measure/eyeball me at a very different size than at which I measure myself, it means that I functionally have no access to try on bras that might fit."
ABraThatFits,3bea7g,anytime_yoga,5,Sun Jun 28 19:30:47 2015 UTC,"That is a completely valid point. That makes it a lot more complicated.   In that situation I definitely think it would be appropriate to say something like, ""I'm more than happy to let you measure me, but I am a bit of an awkward measure. I measure my self at a 28E. I use (insert method of measuring here). I have found this size and method works perfectly for me. I'd like to stick with it. Can I please try on this size?""   I don't see any reason why they wouldn't respond well to something like this unless they are just rude! You could even throw in something like, once I have it on we can check the fit together. Or if you were wearing a bra that is the actual correct fit, you could show them. Talk about why you like the fit and see if they have any critiques."

A couple of times, fitters have later stated (after I'd tried on multiple bras in the size they measured) that they didn't have my size in stock at the moment, so they thought their size would let me ""make do."" However, more often I've had fitters exclaim how well ""their size"" bras fit me, even as I was explaining where they fit me poorly and felt uncomfortable.   I mean, there's a reason I'm an online-only shopper for bras now (I re-visited some places a couple of times in case the issue was just one not-great fitter, but I'm not going to keep returning once I'm pretty sure it's a whole-store issue) -- but I understand the in-the-moment frustration."
ABraThatFits,3bea7g,anytime_yoga,4,Sun Jun 28 20:45:57 2015 UTC,"That is such terrible customer service. I totally get that. I would be so upset. It's like why would you give someone something that didn't fit, just because it wasn't in stock?  That would never happen with anything else. No one is going to be like ""hey, I get your a size 6 shoe, but we don't have it, how about you take an 8??"" That is so dumb.   I prefer to shop online as well. Less drama! I just don't bother. Most of the stores don't sell my size anyway. It's too complicated.   The real point of my comment wasn't to say that there aren't people with terrible customer service out there.

ABraThatFits,3bea7g,SaltyBlackBroad,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:08:21 2015 UTC,"I think it's because the other, just as pretty, brands aren't carried in stores so much.

Eventually after told them that that REALLY was not going to work, they started bringing me 30Es and told me they were the same as 30DDs, which they are not. And then they did not fit because they were a cup size too big. Those are the kind of experiences that really frustrate me. I would never go to Victoria's Secret and be annoyed that they are Victoria's Secret and their employees follow Victoria's Secret policies (and actually people at VS have been surprisingly accepting when they offer to measure me and I tell them that they do not carry my size). But man is it frustrating when an employee is an active roadblock to you getting a product that they carry and you want to purchase..."

ABraThatFits,3bea7g,basylica,12,Sun Jun 28 22:30:32 2015 UTC,"So I wore 34DD/DDD bras, specifically the bali flower full coverage bra for 20yrs. Long story short it was the only thing that I could find pre-Internet days living in a small town (I had to drive 2hrs each way to even get a 34DD). Before my 11yr old was born places like bravissimo were started up but info was limited and I didnt have funds to buy 20 bras and return them. I had 2 kids and immediately after a messy divorce (45k at this point) living halfway across the U.S. from family and had no help.  A 34DD in any other brands didn't fit, the bali had short enough staps and I could cram in and make it look presentable under shirts. Figured that was the best I could hope for.  I was in VS one day because my sister wanted to shop there (she still thinks she's like a 36B - she's slimmer than I am!) and I was browsing panties waiting for her. I knew 34DD didn't really fit me in bali bras and I knew for sure nothing fit me in VS.  Sales lady approached me aggressively and refused to take ""your bras don't come in my size"" for an answer.  Finally since she wouldn't leave me alone and because my sister was still occupied I said FINE you can measure me.  I figured if nothing else she would learn that She was wrong and you couldn't just eyeball someone in a baggy T and claim VS bras will fit.  She gleefully hauled me back to dressing room, did the famous VS measurement technique and pronounced me a 38D  I tried on the 38D and there was boob everywhere, front of band was around my waist and rear of band on tightest hooks was only on my back because it was in my armpits.  She looked at me and said hmmm... Maybe a 36DD After putting me in 36DD and 38DD which fit me no better I was done with it and put my clothes back on and said no more.  She promptly told me that I should goto lane Bryant because they didn't carry bras in my size.  I felt vindicated until I realized she was sending me to a plus size store. Now I had weight issues as a teen (hit 195 or so when I graduated high school) and I still have major body image issues. I'd gained and lost 140lbs between my 2 kids but was around 140lbs at 5'9. I was in NO way in the LB range and it certainly messed with my fragile psyche. I was pretty close to tears leaving the store.  All because some sales girl refused to take NO for 30minutes. In hindsight I should have told my sister I would wait outside but she would have left and then pouted at me for weeks and held a grudge over it. She's a whole nother brand of crazy."
ABraThatFits,3bea7g,Captain-Zebra-Tits,6,Sun Jun 28 17:05:05 2015 UTC,Is VS carrying DDD a newer thing? Because about 3 years ago I got a 32DDD bra there.
ABraThatFits,3bea7g,basylica,5,Sun Jun 28 17:56:42 2015 UTC,"Somewhat. So 20yrs ago they carried 1-2 bras in DD only. Then about 15yrs ago they sometimes had 1 bra that could be special ordered as DDD and usually was only available in larger band sizes.  This story happened about 8yrs ago maybe.  Regardless, they certainly didn't carry a band small enough for me and the girl was perplexed as to why a 38D didn't fit because her ""training"" told her it should. She thought DD would be too big. And she certainly didn't think I needed a band smaller than 36.   But short answer is yes(ish) - VS once upon a time really didn't carry much above a D cup. I have had precisely 1 VS bra in my life. A 34DD that had to be special ordered in the only style they made it in. I got it for Xmas when I was 15. I wore it every day until I was nearly 18.   Edited to add : I should also add in using VS methods (measuring over top of bust under armpits and then over peak of breast wearing a bra and Tshirt) I get 37"" and 38""  Meaning in this bra I'm wearing they would say 38A or 36B I'm wearing a bra that does the cakes on a plate deal. In something like a Cleo Marcie I get 36D or 38C"

They certainly weren't from VS.  lol.  Probably JCP.  I remember they came in a box with some posturing teenager on it.

I had a B cup training bra, my mom gave me 2 old playtex cross your heart bras when I was 12. At 14 my GRANDMA gave me a black wacol bra she bought when she was thinner and gained weight back. And the VS bra when I was just shy of 16.  When I had both money and a car I set out on the great hunt and came up lacking  Wow, I just realized I only had 2 non hand me down bras before I was 18.

ABraThatFits,3bea7g,Captain-Zebra-Tits,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:35:13 2015 UTC,Ahh. Okay. I was just curious about that. I had never even actually walked into a VS store until about 3 years ago at age 18.
ABraThatFits,3bea7g,basylica,3,Sun Jun 28 18:14:24 2015 UTC,"I'm 36 and I have a whole long sordid story about bras. In the 90s VS was brand new draw in the town I lived in. It's easy to understand how women like myself get frustrated when ""the biggest bra store"" wants to fit you into terrible bras. After all they were supposed to be experts. Marshall fields (I grew up in a small farming community outside of chicago) carried Wacol and bali and was just starting to carry things like fantasie and felina, but they didn't carry anything near a 34DD/DDD. I only hit paydirt around 18 when I drove to Schaumburg to the much bigger Marshall fields and found bali in 34DD. I was heavier then, so I can only guess at my size. Probably 32H(ish) Fredericks had a small shop there but in the 90s was like porn central. I waded through piles of split nipple, underboob only (basically underwire on a band with no cup) and finally came up with a 36DD which when I did a scoop and swoop and then frantic stuff back in kinda fit.  Until about 2yrs ago putting on my bra was like trying to stuff the snakes back into the joke peanut brittle can. Entertaining yes, fun - not so much.   I thought it was a myth or only something tiny boobed girls experienced that gores should touch your sternum. I'd never experienced that in my 20+ yrs of bra wearing."

Many of us (myself included) still need to special order bras from Poland or modify existing bras or are on the very outskirts of what is available - but bras that actually fit are ah-may-zing! I'd never owned a bra that wasn't black/white/beige until I was 33yrs old. How sad is that?  Even 12yrs ago when I was pregnant with my older son, I put Google through an exhaustive search trying to find bigger bras and then later nursing bras (bearing in mind I considered 34dd/DDD to be a close enough fit) and I bought the ONLY bra I could find in a ""bigger size"" and had a Royce wire free nursing bra in 36J and it was like wearing pasties. Horrible sagging pasties.  I don't think I could even estimate my real size then, probably 32M or along those lines.  I didn't even bother trying with my 8yr old - I just crammed myself into 36DDD bali bras and called it good enough.  I'm envious, because if I had a baby today I could order nursing bras from Poland in much much better sizes!  http://imgur.com/a/JnGZO  Just because I mentioned it. Me today in 28H vs me about 2m after giving birth wearing horrid saggy ""biggest I could find"" nursing bra. Yikes. Eyebleach - stat!"

ABraThatFits,3bea7g,LadyVerene,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:29:06 2015 UTC,Itchy around the edges? If it's brand spanky new you could be sensitive to the fabric sizing - washing it should remove sizing and soften the fabric a bit.

ABraThatFits,3bea7g,blizzard07,10,Sun Jun 28 22:20:55 2015 UTC,"The thing that makes me upset is when a salesperson is being pushy when I have already told them I am not interested. This applies to bra fitters, door-to-door cable salespeople, people ""selling"" their philosophy about how Obama is the new Hitler on the street-side, etc. I always try to be polite but firm when I turn these people down. When they just keep pestering me, it's harassment, and I don't take kindly to it."
ABraThatFits,3bea7g,basylica,12,Sun Jun 28 19:29:03 2015 UTC,"Frequently it's not a case of ""going in to prove them wrong"", it's ""pushy salesperson does not understand that NO has a meaning"".   And yes, I get it that it's largely the company insisting that salespeople must be pushy and can't accept no for an answer and to keep pestering, and then to use these incorrect methods. However, what isn't company policy is some of the absolutely horrible comments that employees have made to customers - telling them to lose weight, etc.   And then there are the independent boutiques where the owners really should know better, but don't."
ABraThatFits,3bea7g,MrsJingo,38,Sun Jun 28 19:52:10 2015 UTC,"I get angry when people who claim to be professionals don't know what a professional should know. It gets me angrier that you're comparing these so called ""professionals"" to a blind person, it's not the same thing. They can find the info easily, just like I did. I only have one story about someone trying to fit me in the wrong bra, and i was right to get angry because my mom was shopping (while i just followed her, playing with my phone) and the woman kept following me trying to make me try 34Bs because ""that has to be your size"" just wanted to add, that this person never measured me, just looked at me said i was 34B..while wearing i think 3 layers of clothes"

ABraThatFits,3bea7g,MrsJingo,10,Sun Jun 28 14:12:40 2015 UTC,"They aren't always ignorant. They are professionals according to the company they work for. This company has bra measuring standards. If they don't follow those, it's entirely possible they will loose their job."
ABraThatFits,3bea7g,Lola1479,10,Sun Jun 28 16:06:58 2015 UTC,"No, but I've run into cases where it's the owner of the shop that fit me and she put me in the same exact size I came in with 36DDD, because ""I was just so tiny around"". It was an advertised specialty store. I understand that's the case with VS and such but most of the store reviews aren't of Victoria Secret and other similar stores.

As I was telling my customer yesterday he'd have more 'pull' than I would. Because a customer can just say (to corporate), 'you know I was planning on spending my money in your store, but you don't carry what I want"".  If I tell them (my company) that a customer didn't buy something because he was looking for straight leg jeans, and all we had was skinny, it will look like (to them) that I'm not doing my job."

I mean, not everyone wants to ""add two cups""; some just want to lift two cups."
ABraThatFits,3bea7g,j_sunrise,5,Mon Jun 29 13:44:21 2015 UTC,"I have mixed feelings about this.  I completely understand, putting myself in the shoes of a sales worker, that if I was vehemently told that I needed to make sales and trained in a certain way that I would probably adhere to that, though it'd be very difficult for me to not get the urge to secretly whisper to the customer ""Oh by the way, our sizing is wrong, if you want the PROPER way, check out ABraThatFits"" :P although I'm aware it would land me in a lot of trouble. So from that perspective, I understand. Also a lot of women who are trained in these stores are oblivious themselves to correct bra-fitting. If they have been told the +4 method and they BELIEVE that way to be correct, then obviously they're going to use that method. I for one am a 32DD (underbust is 31) but I think I could easily be put in a 34D and it'd LOOK correct, even if it wasn't 100% correct.  However, on the flip side, I've also endured rude sales people who treated me quite badly. One of them yanked my breasts around and pulled the bra down because she said it needed to sit 'lower' and I KNEW that was incorrect, and overall she was very rude and cold. I've also had someone measure me OVER MY CLOTHES in the middle of the SHOP FLOOR and declare the wrong size. When it comes to breasts and bras, some women (like myself) are incredibly self-conscious so being treated courteously and with as much correct knowledge as possible is essential, because badly fitting bras can cause a lot of psychological and physiological problems.  I understand where you're coming from though."
ABraThatFits,3bea7g,Kaywin,2,Sun Jun 28 17:18:40 2015 UTC,"I know most of my coworkers will ask where a customer prefers to be fitted.  If the customer chooses where they're standing, we really have no choice but to measure over their clothes.  To be treated like you were--with the yanking and the ""lower""--is completely unacceptable though.  :("

ABraThatFits,3bea7g,mybraguy,4,Mon Jun 29 13:39:40 2015 UTC,"On the note about telling a customer that they need a bigger band size, this depends what fitting method you are using. If someone uses +4 on me and tries to tell me I need a 44 band, I will absolutely be irritated and tell them that they are wrong. It has happened before on many occasions. One ""professional"" even tried to put me in a 46C. I measure 40.5 snug underbust, and 37 tight underbust. Do not tell me that my 38 bands don't fit."

I really don't mind having my breasts and I don't mind wearing a bra. All of you ladies do it every day. The only difference is,  I'm a guy.  There are still a few places that I have had difficulty with, but most places are very helpful and accommodating. To my surprise,  I have had a fitter go back and check with others who were being fitted and ask if they would be ok if I went in for a fitting too. (AWKWARD! ) And some places,  like a couple of boutiques that I usually shop at, have little booths just off of the sales floor.  But most of the women who have fit me have been very understanding and Sincerly want to help me find a bra that fits.   Thank you for your empathy."

It's just something that I do. For the past five years, I've gone for mammograms and breast sonogram.  All good so far (fingers crossed). I had a thyroidectomy 3 years ago and it was successful in eliminating the thyroid cancer.  However after it was removed, I went from a 38D to my current 36G in three years with no weight gain. I also understand that my medication, synthroid, can increase not only my breast size,  but also my chances of getting breast cancer."
ABraThatFits,3bea7g,knifeykins,0,Mon Jun 29 03:20:28 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen our fitters use the +4 method since I've been there but we do measure under the armpit, across the top of the bust so that is probably the same.  If there is a disparity between the two measurements, I'll try the average of the two.  Well, I used to.  ;)  Now, I just go by snug underbust for band size.  :)"
ABraThatFits,3bea7g,LadyVerene,3,Sun Jun 28 22:27:27 2015 UTC,"Under the armpit and across the top is usually known as the above the bust method, I believe. I am glad that your particular store does not use it anymore, because it is inaccurate for a lot of women. For example, this usually gives me a 42DD, which is horrendous on me. Even if my above the bust measurement and underbust measurement were averaged, I would probably still be put in a 42 band, which is just not supportive enough. Bigger girls really need exceptionally firm bands for support since we have extra cushioning on our bodies. I almost always prefer 38 bands to 40, unless a particular bra has a very tall and firm band."
ABraThatFits,3bea7g,syrusbliz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:16:12 2015 UTC,"I think +4 is more common in department store brands. I am pretty full-on-top so the above-the bust measurement ends up being even worse on me, more like +6. I remember when I didn't know about non-matrix sizing or that gores were supposed to tack, and I was wearing a 34DD that rode up in the back, I thought I would try the VS online calculator (this would've been in about 2005), and it put me in a 36C or a 38B or something like that.

ABraThatFits,3bea7g,aboywithgirls,2,Sun Jun 28 21:08:56 2015 UTC,I went into VS recently for shits and giggles because occasionally they have a 32DDD/E that can pass as cute and they were having a big sale. 32E is at least one or two sister sizes up from the size I normally wear (30F/FF or 28G.) Many chuckles were had when the saleswoman suggested I go to the 34DD bins because they had a more varied selection.

The reviewer was the same cup volume as you, so it should work reasonably well. Also it was only like $15 on Amazon."

ABraThatFits,3beh3s,Lineral,4,Sun Jun 28 13:54:55 2015 UTC,"I think you should try the Lucy again in a 34GG. The larger cup will probably defray the too-tight feeling you've got going on in the band (because the band may be overstretched by the need for slightly more space in the cups). I don't think the 34G looks that off, to be honest, and your measurements show that a 34 band is within the spectrum of reasonable, not that I can judge how it feels when you're wearing it. The second bra is too large in the band IMO, and doesn't fit optimally in the cups. The plus of trying the Lucy one size up (which was your original projected size acc. to the calculator) is that it could give you perspective about the differences between cup sizing and how it influences the feeling of band tightness. It wouldn't be like going from apples to oranges."
ABraThatFits,3beh3s,KristinM100,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:07:45 2015 UTC,"Hello, thank you for your answer :) Based only on the feeling and not objective knowledge, the Lucy 34 band was very very tight, it created kind of a muffin and my skin was really red after.   I think I will give the try Lucy size up according to you - that is... 34GG or 34F? Thank you!"
ABraThatFits,3beh3s,MrsJingo,2,Mon Jun 29 06:22:38 2015 UTC,"The 34 might have felt to tight because the cup was too small. A 34 in that bra might just be too tight for you, that's your call, you are the one that has to wear it. If you do try it a size bigger (34GG) and it still feels too tight try it on backwards and see if it still feels too tight. Putting it on backwards means you are testing only the fit of the band, if it feels good backwards then the problem is with the cup not the band. Some brands and some fabrics have more 'give' than others so you might find a 34 band in a different bra is more comfortable too."
ABraThatFits,3beh3s,KristinM100,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:56:39 2015 UTC,"I'd try it in 34GG - the other alternative, if the band is still too tight (and I recommend that you do the backwards test as indicated below) then try a 36G. Those 2 sizes have the same cup volume. The difference is in the band size. I do think that once you size up in the cup, the band is going to feel better. Also, keep in mind that snug bands do feel very snug at first, after years of wearing too-loose bands. That feeling tends to fade for most. Also, your band will never be snugger than the first time you wear it. Most bands stretch - some stretch a lot. One other thing - Cleo bands do tend to run tight. So if there were ever a brand to up-size in band, it would be this one. Or to wear an extender for the first few wears. If I were you, I'd order 34GG and 36G simultaneously and return one or both, depending on fit."
ABraThatFits,3beh3s,noys,4,Mon Jun 29 14:13:20 2015 UTC,"You look more like 3/6 even than vFoB to me.  The fit doesn't look too bad, just too small in cups, apart from the last image, I don't really get what's going on there. What are you trying to demonstrate there? What don't you like about the fit?  The Emily is not only bigger in band, it's also a cup volume larger than 34G (34G = 36FF = 38F when it comes to cup volume). I don't know why you went up two band sizes but it does seem loose from the little I can see. Can you please take photos and describe the fit as described in the ""what to include in fit checks"" guide?  Did you try the Lucy on backwards and upside down to judge band fit without cup fit? A too small cup will make the bra band feel tight. Even one cup volume too small can feel really tight.  I have no idea why you bought a smaller bra than suggested in your measurement check. And then why the next bra was two band sizes bigger. It's really difficult to suggest something when you're ignoring advice and being unsystematic."
ABraThatFits,3beh3s,lcl0706,5,Sun Jun 28 15:31:00 2015 UTC,"She bought a bra smaller than her suggested size because that was part of the advice given in her measurement check.  ""start with 34G/GG"".... and she posted she was thinking of trying the Lucy in 34G and nobody ever gave her any more advice.  The 38FF of the second bra makes no sense.  Anyways, I agree with trying the Lucy again, in a 34GG.  34 will likely be the best band size, once you find the proper cup size.  As far as stabbing underwires, that's a common problem, I find Panache bras to run really wide set in the armpits.  Maybe check out Elomi Etta in a 34GG.  It's made for petite frames and the straps are narrower set."
ABraThatFits,3beh3s,basylica,3,Sun Jun 28 16:43:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about elomi since it's not in my size range (mores the pitty! I tried on some at nords when starting my journey and they are lovely bras!)  But both bras strike me as having too wide of underwires and straps are too wide. Both issues I personally have with cleo bras.  If you don't have any luck with elomi you might look at Comexim bras which have narrower underwires and low low bands (so much armpit room! Whoo!) and you can custom order them with straps moved in. I'm more even to FOT but I believe I've seen fob ladies have them work?   Instead of clipping underwires you can bend them out slightly too - I found myself needing to do this on a few bras, especially when I started AbTF. I don't need to now however - I have no idea if it's because my size has changed, my body has gotten used to proper bras, migration has changed tissue, or what... I would bend gore and the armpit ends of underwires out slightly to keep them from digging."
ABraThatFits,3beh3s,noys,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:29:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your tips and especially info on the wires and straps, I actually like it better wide, so I'll take a look.     Custom bras will be maybe a little pricey for me (yay a student who can't afford more than a second haaand), but I will definitely take a look and maybe give it a try.   I tried bending but with the 2nd it was no luck, clipping was last resort. But thank you very much for all your advice <3"

My thought was - smaller cup = shorter wire = no stabbing. Didn't work that way but was still fine. Still a newbie.  I will take another photos and post them as another comment if that's alright.    What should have been seen at the last photo of 1st bra is how tight it was and how it caused kind of a muffin and red skin. At the last photo of 2ndbra there's how I clipped the wire.  I did try the Lucy backwards and I could actually hardly even turn it around how tight it was."
ABraThatFits,3beh3s,FridayNigh,2,Mon Jun 29 06:14:53 2015 UTC,"Then I suspect you would need to try 36G, this will be a cup volume and a band size larger than 34G.  Freya Patsy balcony plunge and bras with the same cut have a much lower side underwire height and they're good for a projected shape. Freya bras in general have a stretchy bands so you may want to try them in 34GG and 36G.  There's a bunch of other Freya balcony plunge cuts but most of them end at G cup and tend to be stretchy. If they go above G cup the construction can change a lot. They may be too loose in band in 36 band. I suggest checking out any Freya bras you like on Bratabase.  Bras based on Elomi Abi may work.   Fantasie Abigail from last fall season may work.  Fauve padded halfcups might be a touch shallow but could work."
ABraThatFits,3bffsl,crazymusicalgenius96,5,Sun Jun 28 19:17:33 2015 UTC,"Your measurements put you around 34H/HH if you want a very snug band, and 36GG/H if you don't want it to be quite so snug. You'll probably have to experiment with that a bit.   Luckily, there are lots of unpadded bras in these sizes! Ranging in style from everyday opaque plain beige to sheer pink with red embroidery and everything in between.   If you're worried about nipples poking through, you can get silicone nipple covers to keep them under wraps. You may not need them, though, as the seams on unlined bras often line up with the nipples and prevent them from getting too pokey.  Take a look at the shape guide in the sidebar and see what you think your shape is. That will help us give you some more specific recommendations to confirm that."
ABraThatFits,3bffsl,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:45:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the feedback! From what I could tell using my hands to cup my breasts and also looking at how they fit in my ""best"" fitting bra I want to say I'm somewhere in between the VFT (3/4) and FT(3/5) in the shape guide red/blue graphic for top and bottom shapes. Also projected, not shallow."
ABraThatFits,3bezav,pearlstringthong,3,Sun Jun 28 16:54:36 2015 UTC,"Could you add your 5 measurements to the post? The calculator is good, but not perfect, and we like to have a human check its work. Especially in this size range.   Based on the band of the bra you tried yesterday, I think you should probably start with 44F. I'm not surprised you had a bunch of empty space in that 44C - the wires were probably much too narrow for you, so they just sat on top of your boobs like nipple hats. With wires that narrow, no amount of swoop and scoop is going to force your breast into the cup. It's like trying to get an orange into a tall drinking glass with a small opening. The volume of the orange may be larger than the glass, but because the top of the glass is smaller than the orange, there's a bunch of empty space. We call this the ""orange in a glass"" phenomenon.  We don't usually recommend starting with strapless bras as the vast majority of them are tricky fits. Bra companies haven't figured out how to make the cups match the breast shapes of most women without straps to help. (Straps don't do as much heavy lifting in a well-fitting bra, but they do help you get a nice round, uplifted shape.)   I imagine Elomi would be a good fit, brand-wise, for your wide roots. They make one strapless bra called Elomi Maria, but I think you should probably double-check size in a bra with straps before you go off and get the strapless."
ABraThatFits,3bezav,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Sun Jun 28 17:18:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your input. I was also thinking I'd be more comfortable starting with the 44 band and your ""orange in a glass"" example makes so much sense to me.  These are the measurements:  relaxed underbust: 47""  tight underbust: 42.5""  bust: 51""  bent over bust: 52.25""  lying on back bust: 50.5""  If it helps too I am short and overweight, an apple shape.  I have a naturally large rib cage but also a lot of upper back fat right now.  I agree with what you're saying about strapless bras. The problem is I'm going on holiday in 2 weeks and really need one before then. ;)  Or possibly I could get one while I'm on holiday! I'm going to the UK."

ABraThatFits,3bd3u6,Gertiel,5,Sun Jun 28 14:15:40 2015 UTC,"Welp, this one is gonna sound lame, but might work. Bonus, it would be easy to see if it would work before putting work into it. Take a smooth t-shirt in a shade that goes well with the dress. So white or skin shade if light in color, black if black or very dark in color will probably be fine. You want one with a bottom hem of at least a finger's width preferably. It doesn't have to be new, but should be a shirt you're ok with trashing. Now lay the hem of the t-shirt over the top edge of your strapless bra and carefully put the dress on.   Better? If so, just go buy a length of lingerie elastic sufficient to go around you just at the top edge of your bra with a few inches to spare. You will cut the top of the shirt off to form a tube top. Then cut a hole so that you can thread the lingerie though the hem. If you don't sew, you can just use a safety pin to hold the ends of the elastic together. If you can't find one with a hem you can thread the elastic through, you'll need to just hand stitch the elastic to the bottom of the shirt along the bottom edge. I've done this for a strapless bridesmaid gown myself and it worked great, but I doubt it would work for every style.  Edit: Or you could just order a tube top in the right shade online. I was broke at the time but had some old t-shirts and some lingerie elastic on hand, so that worked for me."

Make sure the tape measure is parallel to the ground and that you're not squishing down your breasts when you measure. 32F UK would be a sister size of the size you're currently wearing.   (38D = 36DD = 34E = 32F)  And if your current 38Ds are overflowing, then I might even suggest going a size larger to 32FF but that's so far off from your measurements! It seems odd that you're wearing a 38 band but all of your measurements, including bust, are below 38.   Btw I suspect you are average or projected, based on your current size, but you can check the shape guide for more info."
ABraThatFits,3bdtl0,syrashiraz,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:26:38 2015 UTC,I'll double check. Thanks for your help!
ABraThatFits,3bdtl0,syrashiraz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:44:17 2015 UTC,I did a double check and found that the tape had been too low in the back because my actual snug underbust is 33 and the tight underbust is 30.
ABraThatFits,3bdtl0,syrashiraz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:08:24 2015 UTC,"Hmm that makes sense (you originally had a very large difference between snug and tight, especially for someone in a small band size). In that case either 32 or 34 bands may work for you. Was it too low for the bust measurements as well?"

ABraThatFits,3bdtl0,brafithelp,2,Mon Jun 29 04:25:37 2015 UTC,"Okay!  The calculator gives 32E now which I think is closer to your size.  I'd still recommend trying 32F and 32FF, but you can try 32E if those are too big.  Don't be afraid to go up a band size to 34 if the 32 band feels too tight.  (But I'd recommend trying the bra on backwards if it feels to tight so you can tell if it's a band issue or cup/shape issue.)  Most of us have to play around a little with our sizes to figure out what works best, and even then you could need a different size depending on the brand and style.  A lot of people here order from Amazon using the Prime free shipping, but I prefer to try on in a store like Nordstrom and Dilliards.  Sorry I can't give you specific recommendations as I'm only familiar with shallow bras."
ABraThatFits,3bdk2j,Shepherd8920,7,Sun Jun 28 05:09:07 2015 UTC,"Looks like tissue migration. 32E or 30F both could work depending on band firmness - bras that stretch 30""-31"" will be the sweet spot.  I would pay attention to possible shape changes. Some women have root width or projection changes, some see a difference in fullness (for me tissue migration meant getting fuller and firmer without much of a size change)."
ABraThatFits,3bdk2j,noys,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:40:45 2015 UTC,"There has definitely been some shape changes - more projection is the most obvious one. They also look fuller, and it looks like her roots may have become very slightly narrower with tissue migrating forward from under her arm.."
ABraThatFits,3bdk2j,32Goobies,3,Sun Jun 28 23:24:35 2015 UTC,I suspect that her shape or roots have changed. Possibly she's becoming more FOT which is why it's so much more noticeable despite her bust measurement not having changed drastically. Perhaps double check the shape guides now again and see if she's seeing a difference there?
ABraThatFits,3bdk2j,32Goobies,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:46:18 2015 UTC,"It does definitely seem like she is becoming even more FOT. Her breasts are very self supporting, and she is now finding that even with the wires sitting right at the base of her breast tissue that there is empty space in the bottom of the cups but at the top there is starting to be some quad boob. And this is in push-up type bras that have extra padding in the bottom of the cup."
ABraThatFits,3bdk2j,32Goobies,2,Sun Jun 28 23:35:56 2015 UTC,"She might also be becoming more projected as well, just to consider. Not that this isn't going to make her bra-shopping life easier!"

At least 32DD was just still in the matrix and is pretty easy to find in Australia. But go above a DD cup or below a 32 band and it gets limited very quickly. Plus it's a 5 hour drive for us to get to the nearest boutique that stocks UK brands :(  She's looking to try Cleo Marcie, as it seems to be the go-to for FOT. Online shopping is going to be our best bet in the long run, but we can't find any store that will do free returns from Australia for UK brands. As such we haven't been game to start buying any online without trying some on in-store first, so hopefully we will have the chance to do that in a month or so."
ABraThatFits,3bd0e4,astrocutie,10,Sun Jun 28 01:34:10 2015 UTC,"It means that you have a large enough difference between bust and underbust that you may need a snugger band than what just your underbust measurements might indicate.

The flattened front thing is just  how it's designed, I think (I know /u/noys has talked about this) â it's intended to push the breasts more up than out, if that makes sense: You're also probably right that short roots are the reason for the loose lace; it's up to you whether that's a deal breaker.  It looks good otherwise. Maybe there's some wire digging into breast tissue in the side view but if it feels comfortable, don't worry about it â sometimes it's hard to tell the difference visually between side breast tissue and extra skin."
ABraThatFits,3bcy6b,braaccount,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:28:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's a design decision.

ABraThatFits,3bcy6b,buymeflowers,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:39:54 2015 UTC,"It looks like it wants more upper fullness/a taller root than you've got. Edit: originally, I was thinking you might (might) be able to try a cup down, but looking closer you've already got some bulging on your larger side about 1"" down from the top of the cup, so I'm going to say this is as small as you can go.  The flattening is not a sign that it's too small - it's just the way the cut is. I don't find it super noticeable in the tshirt photos you posted, but if you're not fond of the shape then that is totally your discretion."
ABraThatFits,3bc3jo,Laplumarosa,11,Sat Jun 27 20:18:38 2015 UTC,Looks too small to me but it also looks like you're wearing the bra incorrectly.  Based on how you're wearing the bra now I'd eyeball it at two cup volumes too small but I can't tell for sure unless underwires are positioned as they should.  Would you also tell which brand and model the bra is? Most US brands' F cup is equivalent to UK brands' E cup so that may be part of why it's too small.
ABraThatFits,3bc3jo,noys,4,Sat Jun 27 21:01:16 2015 UTC,That looks like the Elomi Amelia to me. I recognize the bows as well as the cut & the lace sides.
ABraThatFits,3bc3jo,Goddess_Keira,4,Sat Jun 27 21:03:38 2015 UTC,You're right! The purple looked so weird.  In that case I'd suggest at least 40G.

ABraThatFits,3bc3jo,Goddess_Keira,7,Sat Jun 27 21:09:53 2015 UTC,"A text post would help here, with your five measurements. You're quadding out of the cups in the side view, so yes, it's too small. You may need either a 40FF or a 42F in that bra, from the looks of it."

ABraThatFits,3bc3jo,Goddess_Keira,6,Sat Jun 27 21:19:53 2015 UTC,"Usually with larger band sizes and breast volumes the standard method tends to overestimate cup size but there are women for whom it is correct - and I guess you're one of them.  The calculator and the manual method operate with an ""average"" breast shape in mind. With smaller breasts shape difference doesn't really have much effect but the larger the breast volume and band size the bigger effect any variance from average will have. That's why we stress that the size is only a starting point and strongly suggest buying the first bras with free shipping and returns. For close to half of women the calculation methods are spot on and for roughly half of the rest it's off by a little but it's extremely difficult to always get it right when we're using a few two-dimensional measurements to guess the volume of a three-dimensional thing."
ABraThatFits,3bc3jo,j_sunrise,5,Sat Jun 27 21:30:19 2015 UTC,"I think you measured yourself fine, it's just that the suggested size needs some fine-tuning, and also different bras do fit differently, so you may end up wearing more than one size depending on the bra. :)  Looks like the calculator spit out 40F/FF, and 40F was suggested so you aren't far off track. Getting a spot-on fit becomes really tough in the larger band/larger bust range. I think you might wear a 40FF in this bra, but 40G is possible too and if you could manage to try both sizes and get fit pictures, that would help greatly."
ABraThatFits,3bc3jo,pennycenturie,3,Sat Jun 27 21:38:59 2015 UTC,"In bigger sizes the estimates from the measurements are less accurate. 40 is probably your best band size, cup size can range from E to G if I am going by those numbers."
ABraThatFits,3bc3jo,OrosTheDarkElf,2,Sat Jun 27 21:29:16 2015 UTC,"Both the band and the cups look too small. I like mine tight & high, but the band seems to be cutting in a bit too much. You have overflow in both cups, and while adjusting the straps might create a better presentation, you might find yourself miserable in that after about 3 hours."
ABraThatFits,3bc3jo,pennycenturie,3,Sat Jun 27 23:02:07 2015 UTC,"I would agree that the cups are too small. But the band is likely fine. When you have some extra squish, that's what it's supposed to look like. Especially if it's a new bra. Bands do tend to stretch out also. I measure 40.5 underbust, but I typically wear 38 bands. I find a tight band to be comfortable and more supportive. Of course, this does depend on OPs personal comfort level."
ABraThatFits,3bc3jo,yellkaa,2,Sun Jun 28 00:45:09 2015 UTC,"You're right. I measure 32 underbust, but wear a 30 band usually, so I'm like you. I just am not used to seeing it cut in that much."

Some of the comments about the sidebar mentioned things like wanting a priority put on certain additions (a swimwear guide, etc). When it comes to these kinds of larger guides, it's important to remember that this community is member driven. The mods have a number of tasks that we are responsible for on a daily basis, as well as larger projects that we are already working on. We posted the sidebar survey to get ideas mostly about organization, not to be reminded about guides we already know are missing. If you're on the sub thinking ""Man, a guide about XYZ would be really helpful,"" then don't wait around for us to make it. That honestly isn't our job, even though we do contribute to many projects. If you want a guide made, you are free to make it yourself - you don't need our permission and you don't need us to recruit people to do it. If you don't think you know enough about the subject, either take the opportunity to learn about it or pitch the idea to the rest of the community to find someone who is knowledgeable to take it on."

I wasn't a part of this subreddit back when you were doing the survey so forgive me if I ask something that was already asked then.  I haven't seen a list but would you be adding a list of bra related blogs to the site somewhere for those who prefer to read a blog format?  I came across this site and thought it might be useful to link here: http://bustsofgotham.blogspot.com/p/bra-bloggers-we-read_6.html  Again, please forgive me if it's already listed somewhere.

ABraThatFits,3bc6s7,bluehawaii19,4,Sat Jun 27 20:48:34 2015 UTC,"VS is known to have pretty stretchy bra bands so that may be why the bands seem more comfortable.  From your measurements 38D/DD (or 36DD/DDD for stretchy bras) seems likely.   The thing with push up bras is that often the push up pad takes up volume in a bra so the cup will fit smaller which is part of the push up effect. It could also be that the shape just doesn't fit you and you need to try push up bras from other brands (Aerie, Freya, Gossard). It could also be that you get the effect you want from halfcup (sometimes called balconet) bras.  We also mildly suggest against wearing push up bras daily, we have had anecdotal reports from regular wearers that they've experienced softening of breast tissue in the lower half of the breasts and in rare cases even loss of bottom fullness."
ABraThatFits,3bc6s7,noys,2,Sat Jun 27 21:39:13 2015 UTC,"Do you scoop and swoop? Have a look at the shape guide - not every bra in the correct size will fit, shape is also important. How is the wire width on your current bras?   It's entirely possible that push-up-pads push the bra away from your chest and/or down."
ABraThatFits,3bdcjj,Daniellecnoel,4,Sun Jun 28 03:44:13 2015 UTC,Seems suspicious. No mention of size range and they are reselling Chantelle bras at a higher price point. The prices overall seem unreasonably high.
ABraThatFits,3bdcjj,noys,2,Sun Jun 28 08:36:39 2015 UTC,Thanks!! I agree with both assessments!
ABraThatFits,3bdcjj,hurrrrrmione,3,Sun Jun 28 11:39:36 2015 UTC,"I've never seen a .company URL before. That alone makes me wary although it's actually not an indication of anything except a fairly new and fairly small business.   Googling gives basically no results for them, only that website, an official blog, an official Instagram, this article in The Boston Globe, and this blog post  which reads like an advertisement.   I'll leave it to you to draw conclusions."
ABraThatFits,3bdcjj,hurrrrrmione,2,Sun Jun 28 06:20:04 2015 UTC,"The Boston Globe article says Peach is a ""reinvention"" of a previous company called Zyrra that custom-made bras but that Peach doesn't do custom bras.   Peach's blog claims they take 10 measurements that are ""plugged into a carefully crafted algorithm"" in order to size you and that their sizing method is patented. Zyrra apparently used a custom software program with a patented measurement method to calculate size according to this article from a website I've never heard of.   This is Zyrra's patent. One of the two inventors listed is Derek Ohly, who Peach's website lists as a co-founder and COO. I'm unfamiliar with patent language but it sounds like this measuring method uses a ""fitting bra"" whose design is included in the patent and adjusting the bra to determine 3 measurements.  I did not find any patents listed for Peach, any other patents with Derek Ohly listed as an inventor, or any patents listed with Janet Kraus, Peach's other co-founder, as an inventor."

If you don't what about posting on /r/randomactsofbras being clear about the purpose, maybe someone has some stretched out bras that aren't really in donating condition but would work for washing experiments? There are also some bras in Bratabase listings that are given away for free, it's unlikely anyone would need a stretched out 32A or 34A.  Define ""chemical crap""? Saponin that's responsible for the cleansing effect of soap nuts is a chemical. Water is a chemical...  Soak and Eucalan make undyed, unscented no-rinse lingerie wash.  Forever New needs rinsing but is equally gentle.  I use baby shampoo.  EDIT: If you do try out soap nut it would be great to hear back with results.

I understand that everything is a chemical, I'm referring to known irritants like sodium borate, sulfates, etc. Usually binders, stabilizers, stuff like that.  Thanks for the links for the lingerie washes, I'll take a peek at them.  I have Dr. Bronners, it's what I use in the shower.

Deco cups can run almost a full size large so I am not surprised you have issues with it!  I used to like freya but in my size range the wires are a bit weak and wide - so I moved to cleos with much better results.  I do know most styles tended to be less projected more even. The only exception I can think of was the style I tried on in houndstooth - it cut in on me fierce (I was fot before kids and nursing and now present more as even but I'm technically still fot) and seemed more fob. Lemme pull the link for you and I'll post in a sec.  Freya recycles the same pattern every season so you should be able to find the current version of this bra

I'd truly hold off of buying good sportive nursing bras now because once your milk comes in, all bets are off on them fitting your nursing boobs.  Buy or bra swap 1-2 bras in your current size and Get some super stretchy sports bras and nursing tanks for the first few months.  Re measure at 3 months post partum and then get nusing bras."
ABraThatFits,3b883x,t_maia,4,Sat Jun 27 02:37:36 2015 UTC,"When I was 8 mo pregnant, I was probably in 34FF (from 30G-ish>30GG>32G>34FF during pregnancy), then once I had the baby I was down to 30GG/H (maybe) for the first month postpartum and post-milk coming in, but ""quickly"" shrunk to 30GG (1 month postpartum), 30G (2-3 months postpartum), now maybe hanging around a 30FF at 9 months postpartum (and still nursing).   So you don't always go up a lot when your milk comes in. Mine was maybe a cup size. At 1 month postpartum I was also sitting around my pre-pregnancy weight, so your mileage may vary. If your ribcage size has gone up and you've gained a fair amount of weight, then it might stay higher than if you've gained minimal weight (eg, the difference between staying at a 34 and going back to a 30).  Considering it can vary wildly, I'd get a forgiving and stretchy bra (well, two). I went with one that wasn't even underwire for the first month Bravado nursing bra which is weird because I'm normally a stickler. Those bras (when I got them) also came with a 3-hook extender. So you can buy the back size smaller and wear 'em right now and then adjust later as needed.  Then after the first month I purchased 2 more nursing bras when I felt my size was fairly regulated. Good luck!! Also congrats :)"

ABraThatFits,3b883x,rainbowmoonheartache,5,Tue Jun 30 02:31:38 2015 UTC,"Rule of thumb for nursing bras is going from the size just before birth minus 1-2 bandsizes and up 2-3 cupsizes.   If you were in a 30 band before the pregancy, are now in a 34 band at 8 months I expect you to be in a 32 band directly post-partum. Depends how much your ribcage will keep expanding (to a 36 band or not?) and how fast you'll shrink back down.   A midwife I know tends to say that it takes as much time as it took for the baby to grow for everything in your body to go back to its pre-pregnancy state.    I read somewhere that ribcages don't usually expand that much (??)   That also depends upon how your body is built. If you are a 5ft tall and slim woman with narrow hips who is having a large baby (because your partner is a 7ft tall large guy) your ribcage will have to expand far more than the ribcage of a woman who is 5 ft 6 in, naturally wears a 34 band and has wide hips and a partner who is 5ft 9in.   BUT - this is first pregnancy so I have no idea what to expect   Every woman and every pregnancy is different.    And, I keep getting advice to buy nursing bras now   Some women find that they can wear the bras they wore during pregnancy (3-7 months) again around 3+ months post-partum. So if you need to buy new bras to wear during your pregnancy anyway you might as well buy nursing bras instead of normal bras, in the hope that the nursing bras will fit again. It is a bit of a gamble though.   But I would not buy nursing bras for future use. Maybe a cheap very stretchy one so that you have one while at the hospital, but for everything else I would wait until your milk comes in.   But if you want to play, you could create an amazon wishlist (or use a similar onlineshop) with lots of nursing bras in various sizes. Then when you are looking labour in the eye and know baby is about to come within the next 72 hours you place a larger order of nursing bras. The online shop delivers while you deliver your little one. When you come home with baby and breasts engorged with milk, the nursing bras will be there waiting for you."

ABraThatFits,3b883x,Sollini,3,Sat Jun 27 00:30:51 2015 UTC,"Nursing bras tend to have very forgiving bands -- like, six columns of hooks instead of three. You're unlikely to have your ribcage get much if any bigger in the rest of pregnancy, so I'd personally look for a nursing bra where you're on the second-to-last hook.  For the cup-size, I'd personally get one that's one cup size above your usual DDD. You may end up gaining way more than that in cup volume, but, again, nursing bras are pretty forgiving on that count.  Just buy two of these to start with -- you'll need to buy more/better-fitting-to-the-postpartum-you ones later, but with two, you can wear one and wash the other."
ABraThatFits,3b883x,buymeflowers,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:54:59 2015 UTC,"Just buy one bra to have on hand, and buy at least one cup size up.

It worked really well for me until I lost more weight and my size changed again."

I gained 65 lbs total and am also tall at 5'9"". I've been steadily loosing weight and shrinking since then, and am back at my pre-pregnancy weight. I got re measured for bras every 3 months by a reputable local boutique that specializes in non-matrix nursing bras, and I've changed each time! I measured at 34G, 34F, and now I'm measuring at 30G/GG at 9.5 months pp.   I lived in stretchy sleep bras and nursing tanks for the first month or so, then I got a cheap stretchy nursing bra from target to wear when I wanted a little more coverage until I my milk regulated. I was in a wedding at 5 weeks pp, so I had to buy a bra for the dress and it didn't fit a month later. I definitely would wait until a minimum of 6 weeks pp (or longer if your milk is regulating slowly) before purchasing good nursing bras."
ABraThatFits,3b7drp,SkirtsOfRage,12,Fri Jun 26 15:51:03 2015 UTC,"28s feel tight because they measure the same as your tight underbust measurement, so that makes sense. All three of the bras you've tried have the same cup volume, so if you're filling out the 32B, the reason you aren't filling out the 30C is most likely a shape mismatch. You also feel like wires are sitting on breast tissue in your armpits, so maybe you have a shallow shape, or you need wider wires, possibly both. Molded cups are hard to fit for shallow shapes. Maybe try some seamed cups and bras known for being shallow, like Natori Feathers."
ABraThatFits,3b7drp,AliasAurora,7,Fri Jun 26 16:46:14 2015 UTC,"Did you try the Deco plunge or half cup? The plunge sometimes comes up about a cup size too big (I have gaping my in 28FFs, when in nearly all other brands I'm a 28G/30FF), and Cleos often have quite tight bands, so that might explain the issues you've had with those two specific bras. If it was the Deco plunge you tried, the halfcup might be better for you, possibly in a 28D or 28DD (Freya bands are usually much more stretchy than Cleo). If you liked the Maddie apart from the tightness, give it a go in a 30D.  If you're struggling to find where to buy them, or a store that has a good selection you could try on, let us know what country you're in and we can suggest some sites/actual stores!"

Calvin Klein and b.Tempt'd by Wacoal are other US options, but will require more trying on since they have a greater variety of shapes.

Try Freya in 28D(Freya has very, very loose bands) Don't forget to scoop and swoop and check twice your wires are on your IMF, not lower.  Also, I'd recommend trying seamed, not molded cups before you find out your true size. Molded cups make it unclear how the bra actually fits. The best for trying and checking are sheer seemed bras."

There's a vast difference between 44D and 38DDD, and her best size may be quite different from either of those. That said, there are few options in that size range. Also, how low is ""low back""? A true low back really compromises support, the more so in larger bust/larger band ranges.  I'd imagine your friend has bought her dress already, but for future brides who may be reading this, it can never be said strongly enough: Purchase your intended foundation garments before you go dress shopping. It's much easier to find a flattering dress to fit a well-supported bust than the other way around."
ABraThatFits,3b7yr2,Goddess_Keira,5,Fri Jun 26 19:23:21 2015 UTC,Purchase your intended foundation garments before you go dress shopping.   I kinda feel like I should make a PSA post about this in /r/weddingplanning.

ABraThatFits,3b7yr2,noys,4,Sat Jun 27 17:02:41 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend getting her measurements and shape information (check our sidebar). Strapless can be a little tricky so the more information we have the better recommendations we can give.   Actual corsets (front busk, steel boning, back lacing) can be difficult. Most off-the-rack overbust options are going to be straight-fronted (no individual cups), which can look odd under modern clothing because the bust curve starts quite a bit lower than a person's underbust and there will be no separation between breasts. Cupped corsets would look more like a bra under clothes but are mostly custom made (expensive and may take several months to make). Corsets also require a breaking-in period (like shoes) and she'd probably want to have it broken in/seasoned before dress fittings to make sure everything fits well together. Plastic boned ""corsets"" are inexpensive and tempting but plastic is usually too weak to be supportive."
ABraThatFits,3b7yr2,LadyBoobsalot,4,Fri Jun 26 19:26:48 2015 UTC,I was one of the people who suggested you try this sub but I see that you haven't gotten any suggestions yet. I'm in the same boat as your friend and also committed the sin of buying my dress before my bra so I've spent lots of time looking into this stuff. I'm totally not an expert so hopefully someone with more experience will correct me if I'm way off here.  I'm not sure if the 44D/38DDD is a typo as those are very different sizes but lets run with it anyway. If she's up for double checking her size using the methods in the sidebar you might start there as the system used in this sub is really helpful for finding a strapless bra that will stay up. Bustier's are often recommended for the larger bust sizes as they provide more support over a strapless bra...they're also pretty sexy imo.   Please note that some of these are bras use UK sizing where a DDD is an E.   Depending on how low a back we're talking there's the Elomi Maria Bustier  goes up to a 44G  Panache Eviegoes up to a 38H  Dominque Longline Torsolette Up to a US size 48F.   Here's are some strapless bra options that come in a 38E and here are some that go up to a 44D. Lane Bryant also has a few strapless options in the sizes you listed and sell them in stores.

Freya Doodle/Icon plunge balcony bras or the older versions of the cut have a really retro shape and are a bit wider. I had the older Freya Carolyn and that could take eyes out.  Bravissimo Dotty Spot is another option that gives a really cool uplifted  but pointed shape. The point is more exagerrated the larger the cup size but it's still a great option.

When one breast is significantly larger, the usual advice is to fit to that side and pad the smaller one if you want. So when you measure, pretend that the smaller breast is about the same as the other one, even though you'd be measuring air on the smaller side.

ABraThatFits,3b5vim,braaccount,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:00:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, those were the sister sizes from the calculator--so 30FF/G makes sense. But I know that even a 32G I tried on this week was too small on the left, and gaping on the right, so the circumference measurements don't really work for me.   I can try to pad the smaller size in order to measure--just with fabric or something? In a bra? I know the 5 measurements are usually taken with no bra. I don't want to put padding on that side in general, both for health and practical reasons while nursing, and also for comfort and identity afterwards. It's just not me."
ABraThatFits,3b5vim,braaccount,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:17:33 2015 UTC,"No, no, don't measure in a bra. Measure braless as if there's phantom boob on the smaller side. That's probably hard to do with the lying measurement, but the standing and leaning should be easier -- hold out the tape on the right side for however far the left breast sticks out. I also found this old post with a few other ideas, and I think what's suggested in the third comment makes sense: Measure the larger half only, sternum to middle of the back, then double that number.  Are you sure that the 32G you tried was a 32G UK? In any case, my guess is that you actually need a bigger size to accommodate your left side. Besides, since you're pregnant, your size could be changing week to week for all we know.  So, definitely try remeasuring, but I'd also recommend linking to this post in the Weekly Thread or posting again so that it gets more attention. Good luck!"

Black colourway.  Fast-forward 7 hours after my first wearing, and it felt good while wearing it but I had welts. I wasn't working out in it that day; I wore it because it has a great silhouette under clothes.   I tried it with an extender but I really hate wearing extenders so I wasn't happy. I went back to wearing it without an extender for shorter periods. After about a 1/2 dozen wearings it has relaxed slightly and I can wear it to work out in, but I'd say it is definitely still snug and firm. If yours hurts, I'd try the sister size 34F."

By the time I got around to an extender Id lost a bunch of weight (accidently) and found it super loose. I think some colors run about a size small in the band and cups are generous depending on fot or fob.  If it's too snug then by all means size up! Or if it's just a little snug then I'd wear an extender until it stretches a bit. Since I shrank I can't say how they stretch out but I suspect they do break in pretty quick

Online you'll find bargains, and some stores with free returns, and Bravissimo also has free exchange postage as well.  You'll be trying on quite a few bras to get a good fit so for now I'd look at free returns rather than cheap prices (or places like /r/braswap to try some styles), or pop to Bravissimo and try some bras on, perhaps buy one, and then shop online for cheaper stuff.  now I know what fits me I can get end of line bras cheap on ebay etc."

This one is definitely too small. Try to find a bra that fits your bigger breast.  The wrinkling means it's not projected enough at the bottom (immediate projection). You might be not as shallow as you think.   How does the band feel?"

ABraThatFits,3b5lg2,lcl0706,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:04:21 2015 UTC,"Trying on the unlined bras is to see if the 30dd is a good fit? I'm not particularly fond of unlined bras (or lace bras for that matter). I'm a very plain and basic kind of girl when it comes to bras. I did try on this bra, I believe it was from Wacoal. It wasn't my size, but I tried it on, because it was the only 30 band I found in the store. 30DDD. NSFW http://imgur.com/BJ97Dpu"
ABraThatFits,3b5lg2,lcl0706,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:00:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, trying them on to determine your shape and direct you better in from there.  Molded/padded bras can hide a lot of fit issues and make it difficult to see what's really going on.  I absolutely hated unlined bras when I first started my braventure, but now I'm in love with my Cleo Lily.  So much lift and roundness.  Having one that fits well makes a world of difference, but there's no harm in trying them on, taking pictures, doing fit checks, and then sending them back.  That Wacoal is also too wide and shallow.  The wires are much below your IMF, I'm not sure if you can see it like I can.  But they are not sitting in the space where your breast meets your chest.  If you were to pull the wires up higher, I suspect they'd slide right back down.  This is such an important aspect of a bra fit, that's why we always suggest the unlined bras to diagnose shape.  Without the proper room in the bottom of your bra cups, you will lose support.  You really look to have a good deal of projection especially for your size range, and that will make it difficult to find padded or molded bras.  The vast majority of padded/molded bras are shallow, unless you venture into Polish lines like Ewa Michalak and Comexim - which are the go-to brands for padded bras with narrow wires and immediate projection."
ABraThatFits,3b5lg2,lcl0706,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:06:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, I could see that the wire was below the IMF. There was space at the bottom, just like in the aerie bra. Also the wire was way too far towards my armpit. When I said I was shallow, I was going based off this. I think I look like 'X' when I look down. http://i.imgur.com/1GZ7tSx.jpg"
ABraThatFits,3b5lg2,Saskia_C,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:23:20 2015 UTC,"When you look down standing up or when you're bending over?  I don't think you have a wide root.  There's tons of extra space in the sides of the cups, which really don't look too big for you, just the wrong shape.  You have a decent difference between standing and leaning OB.  Sometimes this can indicate projection.  I'm not in your size range so I may be talking out my butt here, but bear with me.  I have a 4"" difference between my standing and leaning OB, and I have projection for years.  You may not be THAT projected, but from what I understand, shallow breasts sit close to your chest wall no matter what position you're in.  How close in the smaller size range... not sure.  It's true that smaller breasts are typically shallower than larger ones, but being small-ish and projected is not unheard of.  A informal little test that always made me giggle was ""can you hold a pencil in your IMF.""  Yes, I can hold a refrigerator in my IMF.  Where the root at the bottom of your breast is, where it touches your chest, does the bottom of your boob stick ""out"" or ""out and up"" from your chest or does any of the boob kinda lay on your torso?  I really had no idea what shallow breasts looked like until I bravangelized my cousin.  Those were definitely some very shallow boobies, it was like the tissue was all over her chest wall and not going down from her IMF at all.  There are varying degrees of shallow, I've personally never made much sense of any of the graphics and charts on here.  They all kinda look the same.  But based on how these bras are fitting you, especially the Wacoal, I'd say you have average-to-narrow roots, an average-to-decent amount of projection, and are evenly full 2/5.  If you can still find one in your size on Amazon or somewhere returnable, I'd really suggest you try the Cleo Lily.  Return it if you hate it, but I'd be curious to see how it fits you."

That would be helpful as you have 3 sister sizes listed there.  Most bustiers actually cater best to a shallow shape, so if that's you, you should be able to find a better fit than what you're describing.  As to how tight your bustier should be, I would say that you want it as snug as it can be while still being comfortable to move freely, sit down, dance, eat, and so on."

I'm just trying to end up with a bustier that supports me and I don't end up with the top half of the cup empty.  The solution for that seems to be to add some padding underneath, but that doesn't even seem to help all the time!  Thanks so much for your help."
ABraThatFits,3b3ono,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:27:20 2015 UTC,"Hi. So with your measurements, the calculator puts you at a 34D which seems about right--your 32D Le Mystere sunds like it's a bit small in the cup. You may have been finding 32 bands more comfortable because you have lots of ""squish"" (2.5"") difference between your snug and tight measurements, but you would have to go up a cup volume to 32DD. You might even be better off with a 34DD or 32DDD/E in some brands. I know that's a lot to take in and it's not likely you'll find all these options without ordering on line and since you're in Canada, that does get expensive.  With a bustier I think you're likely to be best off off in a 34D, maybe 34DD, making sure that whatever you buy has at least two and better, 3 rows of adjustable hooks & eyes in back, which most do. This gives you the option of getting in between a 34 and 32 band as it were, and a bustier tends to feel much more snug in the band than a regular bra.   The Jezebel Caress 32533 actually looks like it might be a good option, as does the Jezebel Caress Two 30533. It might not have fit you well because of the sizes you tried, or it might not have been the right shape. Since it seems to be widely enough available where you are, I'd see if you can try it again in 34D and see how it works.   The Dominique 7749, 8949, and 8541 look promising to me as well, but you wouldn't know without trying.  One thing to keep in mind is that you might not like the appearance of some of the cups on you, but it will look quite a bit different under your dress, especially if there's lots of detailing or ruching on the bust. You want to look for good support, comfort, and something that will stay in place for the night. Some of the options on that page are very low back, but I would only consider those if you need a really low back for your dress. In general, bustiers give you a little lower back than a regular strapless bra would anyways, and going for the higher back offers more support."

Three options here:   Try on some more 32DD bras in brands other than VS, Aerie, and Natori (which all run shallow) and in styles other than molded cups (which are not great for most breast shapes and can obscure fit issues).  Get the same VS bras in 32DDD and see how that works. Remeasure yourself. Some women's breasts change size throughout the month in accordance with their hormonal cycle, so it's possible your breasts are larger now than when you measured."

ABraThatFits,3b5blo,j_sunrise,5,Fri Jun 26 04:16:34 2015 UTC,"I suggest rechecking your leaning measurement, as it is often larger than the standing and lying measurements, and it's sometimes hard to keep the tape straight.  As far as size, 32DD is the starting point. It's certainly possible that you could fit better in a larger cup size in general, and most women end up with well-fitting bras in a couple of sizes just because different brands and different styles of bra fit a little differently."

ABraThatFits,3b4hgs,AnEnigmaticSquirrell,3,Thu Jun 25 22:07:13 2015 UTC,"The Natasha looks kind of small. It seems to be covering rather than lifting your breasts. There's a bit of wrinkling right at the underwire. It's more open on top, which is why it isn't wrinkling as much at the top as the other FoB bras you've got.  The other bras you've got seem better size-wise, but the shape isn't quite right. You have taller roots than you think you do - the wrinkling near the top that you're getting is being caused by your roots extending above the top edge of the bra. It's most visible in the Kali pictures. You've got breast tissue higher up on your chest than the pendant on your necklace. The bra is expecting your breast to end where the lace does, well below the pendant.  As for the sliding you're getting, I wonder if it could be caused by a too-narrow wire. I doubt immediate projection is the issue, as Freya plunge balconies tend to have lots of room on the bottom like Lucy and Kali. Another potential reason could be the stretchy band, but based on the way the rest of it fits I think the wire being too narrow is more likely."

Hell, if you're willing to buy off ebay or buy used you can get them for less than $25. I love Cleos. I've got quite a few that feel amazing and look great, if you can find them in your size. I'll give you the tip I used to find some cheap bras; google the bra size and name and go through and open all the links to seller's sites. Even something that sounds obscure may have what you're looking for on clearance(for example, here is the Cleo Ellis, which I LOVE and works well for my projected/narrow/even boobs, in your size, for $24.98). The upside about being even is that you have a LOT of options. You can wear a lot of different things with only minor little bits of gaping.  Check out Bratabase's similar cuts to Cleo Lily. Search them all. Google like I suggested. It might take you a few hours but it's worth it to get a good bra on the cheap.  Unfortunately there aren't a lot of plain non-bright/busy patterns when it comes to cheap bras. Try some ghastly looking ones and sell them on braswap if you don't like them.

In the US, you're basically limited to Nordstrom, Dillards, or a local boutique, but their stock isn't guaranteed and you may be totally out of luck depending on your size =/ I also would not trust most anyone for fittings.  Ebay can be a good online option, but I think amazon, nordstrom.com, and asos are better to start with because they offer free shipping/returns.   I've found that I save some money and time by researching certain styles that might work for my size and shape in particular, rather than ordering randomly on a prayer.

It was beautiful and actually felt okay except for the cup not fitting right.  I do think you're right about large band and large cup though. I have a Dillards, Macys, Nordstrom in the city but I don't feel comfortable going in there tbh because I'm plus sized.  Modern Movement is Dillard's in house full/plus bras.

ABraThatFits,3b4zoc,hurrrrrmione,2,Fri Jun 26 03:06:16 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for doing that all that work! I'm still mystified by the whole process and find it daunting. I'm getting excited about measuring myself tomorrow. Hopefully I can do it right and find a bra that fits.
ABraThatFits,3b4zoc,hurrrrrmione,2,Fri Jun 26 03:36:39 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! It IS super confusing. The bra calculator and this sub use UK sizing because, unlike US sizing, it's consistent."
ABraThatFits,3b4z7v,Petiteplusbrahelps,3,Fri Jun 26 00:38:02 2015 UTC,"From your description it seems like you want to try around 38FF, two cupsizes down. A good strategy would be to get 1-3 bras in several sizes, 38F, 38FF, 38G, 38GG and then work from there. Your current order is for 7 bras all in 38GG. Since we already established with the Cleo Lucy that 38GG is too large, those won't work either."
ABraThatFits,3b4z7v,t_maia,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:04:47 2015 UTC,I figured I'd buy them all at the same size and go from there. I'll return the Lucy and try a 38FF.

ABraThatFits,3b4z7v,t_maia,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:15:09 2015 UTC,All bras are not made the same tho. So how am I supposed to know my size and then order? I did my measurements into the calculator and ordered based on that.
ABraThatFits,3b4z7v,t_maia,2,Sun Jun 28 04:30:45 2015 UTC,"The size the calculator gave you is just a starting point. There are some beginner's bras that are true to size and that fit a wide range of women well enough so that by trying 2-3 of them in several sizes you can tell by trial and error which size is right even if the fit is completely off.   All the bras you ordered in 38GG are good beginner bras, you did extremely well on that front - the problem is just that they are all in 38GG.    A good first order would have been less models and more sizes. Instead of 8 models in one size,  2-3 models in 2-4 sizes.   Shortening your list I would keep CK Portia, the Freya bra, one Elomi (Rita or Caitlyn) and maybe throw in Panache Andorra or Panache Envy.  Tango II Balc. is a great bra, but it has relatively tall wires that usually don't work for petites."
ABraThatFits,3b4z7v,t_maia,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:44:50 2015 UTC,Would going smaller fix the wires digging into my side?
ABraThatFits,3b4z7v,buymeflowers,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:52:22 2015 UTC,"Depends why and where exactly they are digging in. Are the tips of the wires bothering you or do you have problems/pain along the whole length of the wire? If it is the tip, how much space is there between the top of the tip and your armpit? Have you made sure to swoop and scoop?   Before you send the Cleo Lucy back I recommend you take some pictures. You don't have to show them to anybody, but they help you remember what did not fit where several months down the line and describe your fit issues better in writing. It is also a great tool to document shape changes thanks to breast migration."

ABraThatFits,3b3w3g,jassykangaroo,2,Thu Jun 25 19:27:46 2015 UTC,"What is happening is that the cup is a bit too deep and too large and too closed on top.   You could wear it without any issues, but I think you'd do better in the Goddess Keira/Kayla/Adelaide or the Goddess Rose 6080 Banded in US 44i."
ABraThatFits,3b3w3g,t_maia,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:39:59 2015 UTC,"Is it because my boobs sit so high? I feel like the wire in the armpits is so nice in comparison to the panache, it would be a mistake to change it. And I bought the goddess in 46H the strapless one, Marilyn?, a while back, and it was too big in the middle of the cup and too loose around. I have a wireless goddess in 46H, that I hate. The fit is right, I just hate the bra, all of the goddess bras I've tried give me no support. I'll have to try some on in the 44I, hopefully Nordstrom has them."
ABraThatFits,3b3w3g,t_maia,2,Thu Jun 25 23:04:53 2015 UTC,"Is it because my boobs sit so high?   Nope. This is a shape and projection issue. Essentially the Elomi Caitlyn is a bit too deep, the bra sticks out further than you need. For this reason you cannot fill out the tips. At the same time the upper cup of the Caitlyn allows less volume than the Panache  Sculp. May, so the rim of the cup sits on your upper tissue. If the cup was less closed and allowed more room it would be easier to see that the Caitlyn in 44GG is actually a bit too large by one cupsize.    For this reason I suggested the Goddess Keira/Kayla/Adelaide. It has a similar shape to the Caitlyn but is shallower and more open on top. Goddess Rose 6080 has the same cut as the discontinued Elomi 8000, this bra has a similar cut as Caitlyn but allows far more volume on top than Caitlyn.   If you can find it you'd probably also like Elomi Maggie."

Shallow breasts are stealthy, and the leaning measurement makes sure all the tissue is being accounted for.  If she has a bra she likes already in 30C, try ordering it in 30D and see what happens. She may need the tighter band, she may not. It's hard to say for sure without her measurements."

ABraThatFits,3b437w,horkus1,5,Thu Jun 25 20:20:25 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would buy the 32DDD and wear it with an extender for the maximum amount of wear. I recently had to decide between a 30B starting on the middle hook or 28C with an extender. I chose the 28C so that I have more hooks to work down on and I can wear it longer."
ABraThatFits,3b437w,Gilliegrl4,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:02:57 2015 UTC,You are right. It is best to get the one that will last the longest but it sure is hard to turn your back on something that fits great as soon as you put it on. I have to remember that bras are expensive and I am playing the long game here.   Thanks!
ABraThatFits,3b437w,Goddess_Keira,4,Thu Jun 25 22:26:12 2015 UTC,"I think the exact opposite. If the 34 feels comfortable on the loosest hooks to start, I'd get that rather than a size that after 4 months you are still wearing an extender. That's too small, and may never be right. In my mind this is a false economy. It's not awful to wear a band on tighter hooks a little sooner, and if it's fitting better you'll enjoy wearing it more. You also may not get more wear out of the smaller band, as you'll overstretch the elastic causing it to wear out sooner.  It may be, though, that some VS bras have less stretchy bands than others.  But if we're talking about the identical model in two different sizes, buy the one that fits! VS bras also go on sale quite frequently, so you can replace them when they go on sale."
ABraThatFits,3b437w,mybraguy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:25:37 2015 UTC,It is not on the 1st hook though. It is on the second to last or last one and I guess that is what scares me. The one that hasn't stretched much is one of their cheapest bras so maybe that makes a difference? The ones I want to buy are from their more expensive (and much softer) lines and they seem more forgiving.   I guess if they are just too tight I can return them. I swear I have bought (tried on) and returned so many bras that they probably think I am crazy at this point.
ABraThatFits,3b437w,mybraguy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:55:24 2015 UTC,"Depending on the type of Bra, their more expensive line is more forgiving than the cheaper ones, like the ""Buy 2"" deals, ie the cotton and Sexy Tee Bras. What VS lines have you tried? Which ones do you own right now? Their Body By Victoria bra's seem fairly forgiving. I have not had any problems with them stretching sooner than they should."

ABraThatFits,3b4246,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:57:36 2015 UTC,"Ritzy is tall and open on top like Medina but it is wicked shallow in the bottom of the cup and along the center gore, though probably not as exaggeratedly so in your size (I take a 32H in Medina and a 32HH in Ritzy was about 2 sizes too small) -- I would try it a cup size up from what you take in Medina.  If it fits, the newest colors of Tease Me will likely fit too, FWIW."

ABraThatFits,3b403s,bloomsburycrew,3,Thu Jun 25 19:58:25 2015 UTC,The bra calculator always lists both sister sizes for the size it recommends. It doesn't mean you'll necessarily fit well into most bras in either sister size.  Did you accidentally switch your snug and tight underbust measurements? The tight measurement should be smaller than the snug measurement.
ABraThatFits,3b403s,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:29:46 2015 UTC,"I think I might have even measured my snug and tight underbust measurements wrong. Underbust snug is 29"", underbust tight is 28"".  Do the cup size measurements sound correct though?

I've had the best bra experience with the Fantasie Rebecca bra, which is a T-shirt bra and I don't think it's very feminine. I bought it at a Nordstrom, too.  I've had pretty good luck with finding 30E/32DD bras at Nordstrom Rack, too! I have a Wacoal Embrace Lace bra, where the lace is only on the sides and gore of the bra, but I don't know how you feel about that. The cups are completely smooth."
ABraThatFits,3b16se,iamof,2,Thu Jun 25 04:37:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions!  The Fantasie Rebecca looks just about perfect if I cut the little bows off, AND it comes in blue?  I will definitely be checking that out."

I try to keep to unlined bras so as to minimize, but, when I do wear a lined bra, I wear the Fantasie. My boobs turn into clouds."
ABraThatFits,3b16se,joanna70,5,Thu Jun 25 05:28:02 2015 UTC,"Until you've got into the right size range dont' discount sports bras.  Bear in mind you won't ned up with just one size of bra in your collection so stay open minded - 32D would be the same cup volume as you're wearing, the band size will be better but you'll probably need a better cup shape/wire width etc to get a good fit, 32DD is one volume bigger, 32E is two volumes bigger.  Some brands have looser bands, some tighter, you have the exact same underbust measuremtns as I do, I actually prefer 30 bands with an extender to begin with (not everyone advises that approach but 32s just don't work for me unless very tight).  If you were the same you would want 30DD/E/F to have the same cup volumes.  Some brands like Freya (and occasionally individual styles like Cleo Maddie/Juna) run stretchy and you're more likely to possibly size down in the band."

ABraThatFits,3b16se,horkus1,5,Thu Jun 25 16:25:44 2015 UTC,There are padded sport bras. I think a good encapsulation sport bra like Panache Sport may be a good solution but I think you should start with unlined bras to diagnose shape. You may also find that you like them more than you think in the correct size.
ABraThatFits,3b16se,SLMartin,2,Thu Jun 25 13:33:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know if VS works for you - they may be too shallow -  but their Body By Victoria Perfect Coverage bras are great for holding everything in place with little to no jiggle. They have some frilly ones but they also have plain color with no lace at all. My SO often accuses me of picking purely utilitarian bras and the PC is one of my favorites, if that tell you anything. It comes in lined or unlined with the lined offering the best hold-them-up-with-no-jiggle support. It comes in your sizes too although you might have to purchase online for the 32DDD. I can find them in the stores sometimes but it is hit or miss. You shouldn't have any problem finding some 32DDs in store."

I know many people out there are far more judgmental and don't hold the same fluid ideas about gender expectations as I do. (I also don't blame people for not being necessarily ""into"" their mate exploring other forms of gender expression. I just do not think it has to be a deal breaker and that other outlets can be found).   Hopefully I understand the question you're asking, and that this response is the kind of thing you're looking for.  If a dude I was seeing liked wearing bras bc they had a legitimate functional purpose? Great! For goodness sake, I know what it feels like to lack support! But I think a lot of the fear comes down to a man seeming feminized, emasculated or even, gasp, gay (let's not get into the fact that orientation is not about gender). I would have no problem with it because I don't hold true to rigid gender expectations.   Also, I love fitting ANYONE into bras! That would be so fun!!"
ABraThatFits,3b08p0,stormy381,10,Wed Jun 24 23:03:42 2015 UTC,"To buck the trend here, a little bit. If it was my s/o who developed this condition, I think it's assumed that I'm already in love with him so this would be something that we'd deal with. If it was someone that was a potential s/o, I'd probably be a little uncomfortable but, having my own health issues, a little more understanding of the stress of disclosing such a thing.  It might turn me off, physically, but that would be completely dependent upon any chemistry that was already there.  The reverse could be said for the health issues that I have so that's the standpoint from which I'm approaching this--what I've dealt w/when disclosing my own issues to those that I've dated.  If it was a situation where I just see this person across the way but have no other interaction with them, I can't say that I'd be attracted to them.  To be fair, though, I'm not attracted to breasts on females either.  The females that I've been attracted to have been fairly small busted.  HTH."

I can understand that some women might not find men with gynecomastia attractive. But assuming you are okay with that, I personally can't comprehend why then your boyfriend deciding to wear bras would bother you enough to break up with him. shrugs I know personally if I was in that situation it'd take a bit getting used to and I might even be a little uncomfortable at first, but it certainly wouldn't be something that would make me consider ending the relationship.

But I wanted to let you know you aren't likely to get too many negative comments here. This community is pretty strict about being supportive and welcoming to people no matter their gender (and we ban the people that aren't willing to silently accept that if they disagree), people arent likely to feel comfortable voicing that they wouldnt accept their boyfriend if they wore a bra in our little part of internet, even if thats the way they really feel.

I wear a bra because I need to wear a bra. If I don't, I'm uncomfortable. Plus I am a whole lot more at ease, and my breasts are a lot less noticeable, if I wear a bra.  It's no different for me than it would be for anyone else, no matter what their gender.  I can't say that I have extensive experience with women's reaction to my chest. I guess there's some self-selection involved; it's unlikely that a woman who was sensitive to a man with bigger boobs than her would be interesting in pursuing a relationship. But my experience is that women are not particularly concerned with the chest of persons who they're attracted to because of factors that really matter like personality and things in common.  tl;dr: His ""social life"" is only over if he decides it's over."

Like most of the women reading this, I have been wearing a bra every day since puberty. I really don't mind wearing a bra.  Having breasts, it's just something that you do. At my last fitting, the best fitting bra that I tried (and bought, of course) was a 36G. So going bra less is not an option for me.  I really don't mind wearing a bra.  I do it every day as do most women. I'm still trying to muster the courage to wear something like you mentioned to the beach. I'm looking for something with support, coverage, and I can swim and get some sun. I know that I just described a woman's swimsuit.  I've gotten some great ideas.  Now, all I need is the courage to wear it.  I am so glad that I have discovered this forum. There is so much knowledge here and every one is very helpful and understanding. I am also grateful that most understand that some men really do need a bra too."
ABraThatFits,3b08p0,aboywithgirls,4,Fri Jun 26 16:21:49 2015 UTC,"I don't and have never had an SO, but I can't see why my hypothetical SO hypothetically needing to wear bras would be a problem. If he needs the support, then he should do whatever is in his power to get it. In this case, it's effectively the same as his developing a knee problem and having to wear a brace either permanently or until he could get surgery.   I'm still figuring out my own sizing, but I'd be right there with him trying to help him figure it out, just like if this SO developed, say, Type 2 diabetes - I'd be right there with him helping him rework his lifestyle so he could be as healthy as possible. This is just the same."

Sometimes it's just for me or sometimes just for her.  But we both like nice well fitted bras and we don't care how long it takes to find what we're looking for.  She has waited for over two hours while I tried on 30+ bras!  She's not as fussy as I am. But you are right,  it is fun when it's something so intimate that you both understand and enjoy."

I'm a 36G now ( yes really! ) And she wears a 38F.  We used to be the same size.  I lost some weight recently and went down a band size when I was fitted. There are still a alot of our bras that we share.  It's nice because we don't both need to have every style in every color. Yes, there are those days when we both want to wear the same bra but we also have twice as many available to choose from.  I don't think that there are many other couples who share bras.  If there are,  I'd love to hear from you."

Generally we tease each other so I would probably tease him and help him pick out bras. Not mean teasing, but like showing up with something utterly ridiculous for him, like super bright colors or animal print (he's a big fan of black).   If he were insecure and had some body image issue because of it, I wouldn't tease and would make sure he knew I didn't mind it, that it wouldn't change my feelings, and I'd just be a bit gentler with my approach.   I would take a hands off approach if that's what he really wanted, but I'm pretty sure he'd prefer I help him find bras that fit instead of doing it on his own.

Of course, I'd run the risk of seeming a bit too excited in that case, but as long as he didn't feel alone/scared/upset with his new condition and required maintenance, I'm willing to take that risk.   Then again, you might consider me somewhat uninterested in the divide of the sexes in general.

People wearing clothing for 'not their designated gender' doesn't bother me. Wear what makes you happy.  Bras are a very feminine-focused item, but honestly there are plenty of guys that could benefit from something like a bra for men.

I truly loved the fact, that every last poster kept it civil and respectful, your comments, I believe will show that love and acceptance can be found.  A very good ""girl"" friend of mine, told me that I was brave for stepping outside the gender lines and trying to be a advocate for others who choose to do the same.

ABraThatFits,3b07vb,noys,5,Wed Jun 24 23:00:25 2015 UTC,Cannot recommend the Satine enough. When I lived in England it was practically the only bra I wore (was 30G-ish at the time.)

ABraThatFits,3b07vb,Journey66,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:57:29 2015 UTC,Sorry I am not too well informed but how do I know if I have narrow roots?
ABraThatFits,3b07vb,Journey66,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:53:35 2015 UTC,"There's some info here. Root width is a spectrum, so it's something you'll notice from how your bras fit. If there's always extra space between where your breast ends and where the wire ends in an otherwise well fitting bra you're probably narrow. You can also use bratabase to check the wire width of well fitting bras against others in the same size range to get an idea of whether they're wide or narrow.  AFAIK Freya plunges are considered to be narrow, how did the wires fit you?"
ABraThatFits,3b07vb,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:31:18 2015 UTC,"I'm still not 100% sure but I think I have quite projected breasts. The Freya was okay but not the most comfortable bra I own, it felt like a struggle to get in the cups"
ABraThatFits,3b07vb,buymeflowers,4,Mon Jun 29 01:02:18 2015 UTC,"It depends on how much of a plunge you're looking for. Freya Arabella has a 3"" gore height in 30J. Ewa Michalak PL is about the same gore height in the size you'd need (somewhere around the volume of 65JJ/K). Comexim plunges are also similar. These plunges are padded.  It's more possible to get a sheer bra that isn't particularly plungey in 30J/JJ. Ewa Michalak SM has a gore height of about 4"" in your size but the sheer models are sheer in all sizes (unlike the Freya balconies)."
ABraThatFits,3b07vb,knorkyat,3,Wed Jun 24 23:04:11 2015 UTC,"Additionally, the SM bras have wires that can actually support a 30J, unlike Freya."

From your descriptions Masquerade halfcups and Cleo Juna would be a good place to start, but in reality you could try almost anything."
ABraThatFits,3b0mgi,t_maia,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:23:18 2015 UTC,I'd try some more unlined Cleo bras in 32Ff/G
ABraThatFits,3b27iv,warriorkalia,6,Thu Jun 25 11:10:31 2015 UTC,"A lot of your problems probably relate to the fact that you're drastically wearing the wrong size.   I think a 38HH is a good place to start there are a couple of plunge bras in that size (Elomi Betty) is the most notable.  I used to think my boobs were stuck together, turns out that I was about 5 cup sizes too small."
ABraThatFits,3b27iv,NurseAngela,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:41:55 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a plan. I'd imagine I'll go through tissue migration eventually, which hopefully can fix the whole connected tissue thing once I get a correct size. I know they're connected with or without a bra, so it's kind of concerning, but regardless, this is a good place to start. Thanks!"
ABraThatFits,3b27iv,NurseAngela,2,Thu Jun 25 17:05:12 2015 UTC,"Mine are ""connected""  but it got drastically better in a proper size bra!   Try /r/braswap for cheaper bras! / to exchange bras"
ABraThatFits,3b27iv,Shanakitty,4,Thu Jun 25 17:16:13 2015 UTC,"The calculator tends to overestimate in this size range, as the laying measurement is often the most accurate. The smallest possible size I'm getting is 38G (9"" difference). The largest possible size I get for you is 38JJ (14"" difference). I think would start with trying bras in  38H and 38HH, and go up or down from there as needed. Keep in mind that a UK 38H is several cup sizes bigger than a US/EU 38H, since those sizing systems don't use double letters (other than DD in the US).  Since you have a noticeable difference between your standing/lying and leaning measurement, I'm guessing that you are fairly projected, and perhaps also have soft tissue? Take a look at the shape guide in the sidebar on the right and try to get some more specific ideas about your shape so that we can offer more specific suggestions.   I agree with /u/NurseAngela that most of the fit issues you're describing come from wearing cups that are much too small. With large, close-set, projected breasts, the gore never will tack (sit against your rib cage) in a bra that's more than 1 or possibly 2 cup sizes too small. Bras in larger cup sizes often also have narrower gores, which will make it more possible for them to tack."
ABraThatFits,3b27iv,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:16:22 2015 UTC,"Looking over on the side bar for things, I'm not quite sure how to use the shape guide exactly yet, but I can tell you that the soft tissue and the projection are a yes. I'm reasonably certain that they have broad roots, but are connected in the middle. So while leaning, they take up the entire width of my chest! On the other hand, my tissue probably isn't in the right place, since I know I used to have slightly narrower roots.   I'm probably just going to order UK bras, as the irritation of trying to find an equivalent size in US being actually sold is... not something I'm up to.   EDIT: I don't know whether I'm full on top or on bottom, or either really- they look about even when lifted, perhaps slightly more full on top, but without a bra and hanging all the soft tissue falls to the bottom."
ABraThatFits,3b27iv,t_maia,2,Thu Jun 25 17:28:51 2015 UTC,"If you lean over at 90Â°, if your nipples point straight at the ground you're even. If they point towards your head, that's full-on-bottom. If they point towards your feet, that's full-on-top.   Fullness and other shape aspects become a lot easier to figure out once you've tried a few bras on. If you make a fit check post after you've gotten your hands on some bras, we can help you figure out what shape your breasts are."
ABraThatFits,3b27iv,t_maia,2,Thu Jun 25 22:57:00 2015 UTC,"A 40D is meant for a bust circumference of 109 cm, which is closer to your underbust than your actual bust measurement. You need a much much larger cup.   Contrary to popular belief the alphabet does not stop at D and if you got large breasts you are far more likely to need a EU-i / UK-G cup and larger than a size with D in it."
ABraThatFits,3b27iv,lauracb,2,Thu Jun 25 16:07:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I suspected as much. I've never before bothered trying to get tailored or appropriately sized clothing until recently, but everywhere I went to get fitted they said I was around a D, which confused me, as that was quite different than the measurements I was getting."
ABraThatFits,3b0mc1,supersmartguRL,10,Thu Jun 25 00:36:12 2015 UTC,"I would say start off with 30F and 30FF. 30F is the sister size of 32DDD (which is US sizing btw, it would be 32E in UK sizing) so it may be too small, but it could also just be you need to try bras with a bit more projection judging by the fit of the Chantelle and the fact that you said you're quite projected.   Try wearing your Chantelle upside down and backwards to check the fit of the band. It should be comfortably snug and stay in place if it's a good size. (Freya Deco's band fits large so it won't help to test it.)"
ABraThatFits,3b0mc1,hurrrrrmione,4,Thu Jun 25 00:57:30 2015 UTC,"US DDD is the same as UK E so you currently have 32/34Es which are only about 1 cup off of what the calculator have you. I do think 30 would be too small since your underbust measurements are only and inch apart. You should probably try 32F and it sounds like you may be wide rooted, like you suspect, or full on bottom or short rooted since the Freya Deco is typically a full on top bra. Do you make sure to scoop all the breast tissue into the cups when you put it on?"
ABraThatFits,3b0mc1,plutonium743,5,Thu Jun 25 01:02:48 2015 UTC,"With your underbust measurements sister sizing up to 32E/F seems very reasonable.  Try Parfait by Affinitas Casey and Jeanie, they're wider than Deco. If possible get several cup sizes  Try The Intimate by Britney Spears (EU cup sizing so try 32G) bras. There are a few on ASOS in your size range."
ABraThatFits,3b0mc1,noys,3,Thu Jun 25 13:30:29 2015 UTC,"I have nearly the same measurements as you do and was sized at 32F/30FF. I also was wearing a 34DDD before measuring and resizing.  I found a 30FF in in Freya's Deco Plunge to be amazing. I love how snug the band is and how much supportive it is. I can never go back. It was painful to put my 34DDD back on to leave the store.  I never thought I'd be in the 30's band size. It's worth trying some on, if you can. ^.^"
ABraThatFits,3b1h2o,xxmythxx,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:10:30 2015 UTC,"I think Freya plunge balconies will be a good bet - there are tons of them, all quite similar to Arabella, and they tend to be cheap in our size range because most of us are too shallow for them. I don't think all of them are quite as stretchy in the band as Arabella. There are at least a couple of styles that come in black/white/beige, though most are colorful like Cleo bras. The only ones I wouldn't recommend to you would be Gem and Rio, as they're suited for FoT breasts, and the Doodle/Icon cut, which ends up being pointy on pretty much everyone."
ABraThatFits,3b0mpz,AlwaysExclaiming,5,Thu Jun 25 00:39:38 2015 UTC,"The bra has, as they call them, ""side gussets for support"" and those gave me actual bruises! Ouch!   Are those ""gussets"" plastic / metal thingies placed behind the wires in the connecting part between cup and band? If yes, just remove them. Cut a small hole in the fabric, pull them out and sew up the hole again as if you are mending socks.   Regarding your shape issues, have you tried Freya Halfcups or halfcups in general? Cleo Maddie for example? If you got short roots and lots of weird gaping in the upper part of the cup, halfcups are usually the answer.   Additionally Neve and the Chantelle C Chic are very shallow bras, so if those fit you have a shallower shape than you think.   Finally, weird gaping near the strap in plunges is typical for shallow shapes, so a good strategy would be to stop trying plunge bras."
ABraThatFits,3b0mpz,t_maia,2,Thu Jun 25 01:17:20 2015 UTC,"I'm seconding the recommendation for half cups, especially Freyas. I have similar measurements and love the Lauren and Bombshell the most. They have a decent amount of immediate projection which could solve your wrinkling at the bottom of the cup issue. The half cup also solved my problem of too much gaping at the top."
ABraThatFits,3b0mpz,BriannaRG,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:46:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you both!  I've only tried on a few Freyas in 30 bands, and they were all too loose.  I can't remember the models, but there were a couple of longlines and I had to hook them on the tightest hooks. Do the Lauren and Bombshell bands run large, or should I go with my usual 30? I believe I tried on the Patsy half cup about 2 years ago and it fit well, but I remember the edge of the cup/band digging into my armpit.  I think with the Chantelle C Chic sort of fitting me, it's because the cup is too shallow and forces my boob up a little? It never gets pushed out of my IMF though, so perhaps I'm shallower than I think.  Is it possible to be projected and shallow at the same time?"
ABraThatFits,3b0mpz,Cyrridven,2,Thu Jun 25 01:56:45 2015 UTC,Freyas tend to always run a little large. I have a 30G Deco that I need to wear a Rixie clip with because the band stretched.
ABraThatFits,3b0mpz,joanna70,2,Thu Jun 25 03:47:41 2015 UTC,"Sadly Lauren clones aren't often made in 28, check out the Freya website and have a look on bratabase.com for older models."
ABraThatFits,3b0mpz,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Thu Jun 25 07:11:43 2015 UTC,So far just Daydreamer and Fifi. I think they went back to the old size range for AW15.
ABraThatFits,3b0mpz,BriannaRG,2,Thu Jun 25 07:27:24 2015 UTC,"I find Freyas run large, but I loved the fit of the Lauren so much I just hook the 30 on the tightest hook. I tried the Daydreamer in a 28G and found it changed the fit of the cup too much for my liking. Our measurements are different in the cup, though, so maybe that means you will have more luck with it than I did!"

I think Daydreamer and Fifi are the only Lauren clones Freya's ever going to produce in my size, so I'm trying to gather potential options for when my Daydreamer is fully worn out. I may add that Parfait Louisa to my list as it seems to run tight."
ABraThatFits,3b0mpz,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:06:19 2015 UTC,I never thought to remove the gussets. I will try that! Thanks!
ABraThatFits,3b0mpz,LordLeesa,2,Thu Jun 25 01:57:34 2015 UTC,"Hm. I would have expected you to have better luck with Bardot than you did, as the reviews I've read of it have said that it's quite similar to Cleo Lucy. It is slightly more closed on top, so perhaps Lucy hits the sweet spot for you there, and on Bardot it was too much?  I am intrigued by the Parfait Louisa, though. I think finding similar bras to that will be your next step. Bratabase reviews are indicating that it needs a bit of upper fullness, so perhaps you aren't quite as FoB as you'd previously thought."
ABraThatFits,3b0mpz,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Thu Jun 25 01:09:16 2015 UTC,I remember that--I had to order (and return!) four bras before the magical fifth one showed me The Way. :) My magic brand was Elomi.

However, if you're not interested in that route, something like this might help. You hook it onto your bra hooks and wrap it around your torso to lower the band. It won't be as supportive as the bra typically is, but it might work in a pinch.  When you're ready, we would love to offer you even MORE support than your 36DDD's are likely giving you. :)"
ABraThatFits,3b1hot,cupcakery,3,Thu Jun 25 12:02:36 2015 UTC,"Support options for low back dresses don't really exist. You're expected to go braless. If you have relatively small breasts sticky cups may work but they unstick pretty easily if you sweat even a bit (so dancing is out of the question).  Our subreddit recommends finding foundation garments first and then matching the dress to them. The choice of dresses is thousands of times larger than the choice of underwear options to wear under them, it's much easier to  get a dress to fit the bra than the other way around.  Still, depending on the dress and the size you measure as there may be a few options.  1) How low in the back? A couple inches below the bra line? High waist? Low waist? Almost butt cleavage? 2)  Can you wear a bra or bustier that has straps with the dress - does it have sleeves or straps, are they positioned so they'll cover the bra? 3) Are you willing to tape your breasts?"

ABraThatFits,3ayelo,kickshaw,16,Wed Jun 24 14:31:02 2015 UTC,"The trouble is that brands have a range of styles which will all fit differently, even band stretchiness can vary across brands, for instance Cleos run snug (ie true to size) except for Juna and Maddie which run a size larger on average.  These two bras also run small in the cup.  So it's way more detailed than any Wiki could probably cover, coupled with the fact that styles change every year, many are dropped and others introduced.  This is also why some of the side bar info is out of date sadly.  Even wire width isn't consistent across brands and the chart that shows wire width is pretty unhelpful.  Not only do styles vary but scaling for different sizes mean that relative wire width can vary across size ranges.  For instance EM, a Polish brand, is said to have narrower wires than UK brands, which overall is true, but it less true in smaller sizes and more true in larger sizes.   The very best thing you can do is use the search function top right and get reading :)"

Juna running small in the cup is not across the board true. It works decently well for shallow shapes in the smaller cup sizes, but +G cups the fit is true to size, and it is the deepest/narrowest UK padded half cup currently available in that size range.   Just furthering your point that these generalizations are really impossible to make :D"
ABraThatFits,3ayelo,buymeflowers,2,Thu Jun 25 03:31:23 2015 UTC,"And that would account for the 28GG Darcy being a really projected, double seamed, closed on top shape on me, when the 30G was slightly too large in the band but otherwise good!"
ABraThatFits,3ayelo,joanna70,17,Thu Jun 25 06:57:56 2015 UTC,"Here are a few nuggets of wisdom, I'll add to it if I can remember anything else:  Freya has stretchy bands. The unpadded balcony plunges are great for immediate projection. The halfcups are more shallow.  Unpadded Cleos run snug in the band, padded ones are stretchier. Unpadded cleos are pretty projected in medium to larger cups.  Curvy Kate's bras are scaled badly. The smaller cups are narrow and projected, larger cups are shallow.  Ewa Michalak's bras are projected and fairly narrow. They vary a lot in terms of shape. Bands vary a lot so do your research.  Comexim's bras have a little less immediate projection but are narrower. Shape is pretty consistent across styles. Bands run snug to TTS."
ABraThatFits,3ayelo,goodoldfreda,3,Wed Jun 24 15:48:49 2015 UTC,Kind of disagree about Comexim. The padded plunges are quite shallow on bottom but what about the unlined cuts and the halfcups with multiple vertical seams? In larger cup sizes they are nicely roomy on bottom.  The cup width of halfcups is also comparable to EM halfcup width in the same size.
ABraThatFits,3ayelo,noys,3,Wed Jun 24 17:47:22 2015 UTC,Thanks for the extra info.
ABraThatFits,3ayelo,goodoldfreda,3,Wed Jun 24 18:04:22 2015 UTC,And see I disagree about the padded plunges from Comexim. So far they're the only padded bra with enough immediate projection for me. This is why a wiki or all inclusive list like the OP was asking for would be next to impossible :(
ABraThatFits,3ayelo,lcl0706,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:05:45 2015 UTC,"I think noys didn't mean shallow on the bottom, just more so than I may have written. I certainly think they're still pretty projected, especially when you consider that they are padded."
ABraThatFits,3ayelo,goodoldfreda,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:50:11 2015 UTC,"In the sizes I've tried (75HH and up) Comexim's plunge is by far the most immediately projected bra I have ever worn.  I will say that out of all the ones I've owned (well over a dozen at this point), they all fit identically except one (Luna), which was very shallow in the bottom and along the gore, and had a higher apex - it felt like a completely different cut of bra (and gave me massive cleavage, way more than the other plunges). I always assumed it had been mis-constructed.   Comexim's HC was actually a good deal narrower than Ewa's CHP in the same size, by at least a half inch. I also find all the Comexim halfcups I've tried to be quite shallow both in the bottom and the center gore area, but it's hard to make a blanket statement about them because I'm ordering outside their standard size range, these quirks could very well be a scaling issue. Additionally, there are 2 different half cups -- a 2 seam and a 3 seam version -- and while I've talked to people who have tried both and detected no difference, I have not personally tried the 3 seam one yet (hopefully Joy HC will be here soon so I can remedy that, lol)."
ABraThatFits,3ayelo,buymeflowers,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:13:31 2015 UTC,"I'm perplexed. I have a 70J (Lorraine) and it has obviously less immediate projection than any if my other bras, including Change Lingerie ones. The 70HH Dafhne halfcup had much more even in a too small size and had ample center fullness, more than CH or CHP. As for cup width it lines up with HP/HM width."
ABraThatFits,3ayelo,noys,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:50:40 2015 UTC,The padded halfcup is definitely more projected than I expected. The flourish longline is pretty shallow.
ABraThatFits,3ayelo,rainydayseveryday,0,Wed Jun 24 18:27:52 2015 UTC,"Curvy Kate even said that their core size range is 32DD-36GG. If you're smaller than 32DD, most of their bras will be really projected. If you're larger than 36GG most of their bras will be really shallow."
ABraThatFits,3ayelo,Saskia_C,9,Wed Jun 24 19:33:11 2015 UTC,"The one I've heard is that Victoria Secret bras run stretchy in the band and shallow. There's nothing wrong with the bras themselves, VS just has bad fitting practices. So they can be a good recommendation for people who are shallow and in the matrix, especially if they're already used to shopping at VS."
ABraThatFits,3ayelo,syrashiraz,5,Wed Jun 24 15:59:42 2015 UTC,"I feel slightly jealous of my two best friends, because both of them are within the matrix.

ABraThatFits,3ayelo,Saskia_C,3,Wed Jun 24 19:31:55 2015 UTC,I am still within their matrix at 32DDD but it has taken some work to find anything that can accommodate my projection. Their unlined Very Sexy and Dream Angels are more forgiving but Body By Victoria is definitely well suited to shallow with wide roots. Anything with padding is not projection friendly.

However, it would help if you could tell us what bras used to fit you before you grew, which bra you just purchased, and list some new measurements if possible.   Proper scaling for small band bras is something that bra companies still struggle with, so your description doesn't surprise me all that much.   If you ordered from Bare Necessities' ""close set straps"" section, please know that none of those bras have particularly close-set straps. Out of all of them, I'd say that Panache Tango probably has the closest set straps, but that bra doesn't work particularly well in our size range. The closest set straps I have ever tried were on Fantasie Rebecca, which unfortunately does not come in 28 bands. I don't know anything else about your shape so I can't say whether it would work for you, but it will put the straps much closer to your neck."

I wore this bra pretty much exclusively when I was wearing a 32GG/34G (before resizing myself about a year ago) and was probably able to get away with it for so long because the cups do run large.

If Freya is a good fit but the wires are a touch too narrow, go for Fantasie. Additionally the bottom cups in Fantasie bras are less rounded than in Freya, more shape 5 than shape 6.   The Fantasie Smoothing range has a similar cupdepth as Freya Deco only with a higher gore. The Smoothing 4520 is actually a bit deeper than the Deco.   4500 is a thick foam fullcup, 4510 is a foam padded 3/4 cup, 4520 is a 3/4 cup that is moulded but without foam. 4520 runs true to size and has a similar shape as other Fantasie Balconies (which have the same cut that GG+ Freya bras use, only with wider wires). The other  two Smoothing bras run largish because they are designed for a full-on-top shape and with the Fullcup and SideSupport cuts in mind."

However, I tried Lilliana by Tutti Rouge in 34H, and I could NOT get the clasps together at ALL. :( it also made me realise I really don't like molded cups :p"
ABraThatFits,3aysod,joanna70,3,Wed Jun 24 17:48:34 2015 UTC,"Have you checked measurements of bands on bratabase, Liliana may have a tight banr, bear in mind it's a shallow cup, so may have acted too small, making the band feel tighter than it really was, always try on backwards and upside down to isolate band tightness :).  Did the band on your marcie move?  Panache bands are pretty true to size, if it rode up I'd consider a 34 band and extender.  Wires poking through fabric at the gore sounds like a quality issue and worth a return, though it of course can happen if its too small.  Marcie on the narrow side and is FOT so not a lot of projection in the lower half of the cup, Liliana is shallow all over (and padded rather than moulded, moulded means no seams). Some of this may help you work out what's going on, but doing the leaning test as soon as you're able will help, it sounds like you may be even to FOB.  I would say size range 36GG/H and 34H/HH as a good starting point."

I really liked the fit of the cup itself on the Marcie, though. And no, there is absolutely no way in hell that I'm even close to FOB. I'm VERY full on top. Leaning makes my nipples point downwards and towards my body. As I said, I literally have NO underboob to talk about.."

ABraThatFits,3ayuve,birdmommy,7,Wed Jun 24 16:33:06 2015 UTC,"Spencer, you'll find more info with that spelling :)  M&S doesn't have a standard range out every season, as do the specialist larger cup manufacturers like Freya and Panache.  This means the range is huge and sprawling, and changes regularly, and it's impiossible therefore to get feedback on how individual bras fit, as you need a lot of people over at least one season to have tried it.  Even Freya bras for instance will have a lack of information on here and on bratabase if they've only been out for a season, try finding info on Icon and Idol.  The basic opinion is that they do indeed have a lot of options in near-Matrix sizing, they miss out FF but that won't matter for you.  They are incredibly inconsistent on sizing, I have a 32E sports bra that I wore while I had 30FF/G and 32FF/G as my other bras, and the band on that bra has never stretched, I now have the same bra in 32F and the band is even tighter and is still on an extender after maybe 20 wears (only ever on the first hook)!  The moulded cups all tend to be made from one mould, shallowish just like most moulded cups, so the range will fit you or it won't.  The seamed cups I have no idea about as I need wide wires and shallow cups and unlined seamed cups never work for me so I can't tell what shape they are.  Quality varies too and their fitters are, pretty much, appalling.  They can be useful for 30 bands in larger stores, my local store (medium sized) has not a single one, and I believe they have 28 bands and small cups in their teen ranges."
ABraThatFits,3ayuve,joanna70,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:43:51 2015 UTC,"Ah, thank you! That really does help.  I wouldn't have to worry about their fitters; I was mostly attracted because I'm in Canada, and they have free shipping and decent prices.

ABraThatFits,3ayuve,dwellondreams,4,Wed Jun 24 16:39:40 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing they're also not mentioned as much as other brands because a lot of ABTFers are from the US and there are places one can buy other UK brands from with free shipping and free returns (in the US), so it's more of a risk to order M&S stuff (even with free shipping to the US) because you'd have to deal with return costs.

ABraThatFits,3az2ov,Daniellecnoel,2,Wed Jun 24 17:30:19 2015 UTC,"Getting new measurements would be a good place to start.   Depending how far along you are, you're likely to continue growing, so don't buy too many bras. Your ribcage is expanding so buy bras that are comfortably snug on the tightest hooks rather than the loosest, as you'll most likely need the other two hooks as your ribcage grows. Stretch lace will be your friend!  If you can't find nursing bras you like, it's really easy to convert many regular bras into nursing bras. We have a guide in the sidebar, or you can take them to Nordstrom and they'll do it for a small fee."
ABraThatFits,3az2ov,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:33:47 2015 UTC,I did not know that Nords would do it for you!  That sounds...way better than doing it myself lol.
ABraThatFits,3az2ov,Gluestick05,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:35:06 2015 UTC,Thanks!! I didn't know if nursing bras would be supportive enough.  I still have my two from the last pregnancy so I'll start wearing those.
ABraThatFits,3az2ov,GengarKitty,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:46:27 2015 UTC,"I am currently 32 weeks pregnant and got a new bra last weekend. I waiting until I could no longer handle wearing the one I was in because it got too tight. I went from a 34G to a 34I. The fitter wanted to put me in a 36G even though I knew that I grew in the cups not the band. She said that in pregnancy there is a little give so its fine if the gore floats two fingers from the breastbone. I did not agree, so I thought about it and came back and looked through for what I thought that I was and found what I was looking for.   I decided that I did not really want to get a nursing bra as I have only found they come in s/m/l/xlg and I still wanted wired support. So to have something that I could use, and allow for engorgement I went with a stretchy lace cup, like this poor womans bra. I am able to pull it down past my nipple if needed, and it will allow me to grow for milk. I think I made the right choice.  I would say to measure yourself so you know where you have grown and know how a bra should fit you regardless of pregnancy. Only buy one if you are completely satisfied. A proper fitting bra should not be sitting on any breast tissue, so you will not be cutting off the ducts. I wish you luck! It can be hard to find a nice fitting bra at the best of times! :)"

I bought a few stretchy, wire-free nursing bras for now just for comfort around the house. I also bought a few bra band extenders that helped keep me in my smaller band bras for a while longer, at least until the cups got too small.   I'm so close to delivery that I don't want to spend any more money on bras until after I see what happens with them postpartum. I understand that the band size may shrink back down (less space below the underbust/rib cage being taken up by baby) and the breasts might grow to, ahem, adult film star sizes, once milk comes in. So I'm anticipating smaller band and larger cups soon, but we'll see!"

If soft then your shape can be less important in balconettes, plunges may not work so well....  Also just to warn you that wiping the slate clean means you'll probably get recommendations that you've already tried.  Perhaps keep a list on Word of what you've tried and why it didn't fit so you can cut and paste when needed, or provide a link to something similar if already posted.  Otherwise I can see the thread becoming a little tricky :)"
ABraThatFits,3ayzw1,joanna70,2,Wed Jun 24 17:21:02 2015 UTC,I didn't know about the 90 degree angle thing. I thought shape was determined by standing. After looking in the mirror I'm even with nipples straight down. Tissue wise I'm honestly lost. Is there away to determine that like with the shape stuff.  I'll make a list of bras I've tried and what didn't work. I seem to keep going for bras that are to closed on top.
ABraThatFits,3ayzw1,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Wed Jun 24 18:12:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks to gravity, pretty much everyone looks FoB while standing up without a bra on. The leaning test makes gravity act more equally on your boobs rather than just pulling down the bottom part. However, the shape characteristics are really meant to be determined while wearing a bra.  Tissue softness and firmness - what is the consistency of your breast tissue? Does it squish into basically any position you want or does it not move very much, forcing the bra to mold to the breast?"
ABraThatFits,3ayzw1,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:19:27 2015 UTC,More squishy so I guess soft...
ABraThatFits,3ayzw1,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:37:17 2015 UTC,"You can certainly be in the middle between soft and firm! That's an important thing to remember when you're figuring out shape, too. It is possible to be somewhere in between shallow and projected, FoT and FoB, conical and round, etc.   If you haven't tried Cleo Marcie yet, I think that would be a good next step. Try 30F and 30FF if possible. It will be wider in the wires than Cleo Lily but it will be more open on top for your tall roots."

ABraThatFits,3ayzw1,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:08:13 2015 UTC,"The one thing about all of these bras in your spreadsheet is that they are too small, excepting the Freya Patsy and the Comexim. Any quadboobing or cutting in you got in them can't necessarily be attributed to shape issues. For example, I thought I was FoT for the longest time when I first started figuring out my shape because I was quadboobing so badly out of my 32A bras. However, because the bras were so small on me there was nowhere for my tissue to go but up! Based on the bras I wear now, I'm even to slightly FoB.   Also, I'm really confused about how this Comexim bra fit you. Because of how tall your roots are, I wouldn't expect it to be too tall for you. A bra that is too tall and too closed on top would extend past the top of your breast tissue and then start heading toward your ribcage above that point, leaving a space that's enclosed with nothing but ribs. Was there a gap at the top of the cup? Was it cutting into your tissue somewhere?"
ABraThatFits,3ayzw1,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:24:31 2015 UTC,Here is the pictures of me wearing it. It cuts in and by to tall I meant there is empty space at the top of my root.  http://bra.pe/XOuz/
ABraThatFits,3ayzw1,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:35:59 2015 UTC,"Okay, here we go! It's indeed too closed on top for you, but I don't think it's too tall. If this bra were too tall, the cups would end at your collarbone, because you've got breast tissue extending almost that high. Instead, I think the issue is that it's got too much space near the gore for you. It's clearest in that picture of you hanging down - you can see that the outer portion of the cups is being filled, while the inner portion has a gap.   We don't talk nearly as much about center (near sternum) and side (near armpits) fullness as we do top and bottom fullness, as it usually only becomes clear if you've got a LOT of one or the other. We really need to add it to our shape materials, though, as it does effect fit quite significantly for some people. It seems that you've got more side fullness than center fullness. You could also be splayed (nipples pointing more to the sides or diagonally outward rather than straight forward)."

Also, try not to get too hung up on perfection. Like, the wire width can be a bit wider than necessary as long as the bra is comfortable on you. The wires on that Lily didn't seem wide, although of course they'll be slightly wider in the next cup size up. But then, you had said that after you took that bra off there were wire marks on your tissue, so it may have been a bit narrow in that size."
ABraThatFits,3ayhfb,SaulHun916,2,Wed Jun 24 14:53:04 2015 UTC,"This bra is not the right shape for you; if the smaller size you tried seems too small and the larger size seems too big, that's a good way to tell!   If you're looking for a moulded bra, most of them don't have much space for your bottom fullness, unfortunately. Fantasie Rebecca might work, or you could try the new Freya Idol bra."

It's more like 27-28 snug and the 30 band feels loose now. I've checked everywhere, but fantasie doesn't make 28 bands. Also,  I wear them low since the straps aren't adjustable all the way.  In conclusion,  I'd like to avoid all that with the next moulded bras I buy. I also want great lift and shape."

If the bra fits and you don't buy it because you can get it cheaper online this is a shitty move.    If she has got nothing that fits then that is tough luck.   If she is willing to order more - make your budget limitations clear and thank her politely. Maybe pry a bit into the conditions of her supplier, some brands have a fantastic customer service that allow small retailers to order bras for a specific customer and return everything, paying only the cost of shipping. But it is far more the norm that this boutique owner has to buy the bras in question in the hope of selling them someday. In this case it is really shitty to try things on and then order them online, especially if she has ordered them in for you. In this case you are actually causing her loss.   So I would use her offer to order in things for you, but only when you really want something. Like your favourite bra in that new fashion colour that will be coming out next season and that you absolutely have to have, no matter the price and where you are sure that this bra is going to fit because you already own it in another colour."

A single person business or a larger boutique with 5 employees?    That said, there are some really good fitters and she might have some ideas on what could fit you.

I think it's the decent thing to do, buying the least expensive one that fits, if she has one that fits. It's in your best interest to have the boutique stay in business, too. You'd be helping yourself, too.  If you want to spread your bra purchases out over time so you can save up for them, you may want to share that plan with her. She may help you figure out how to do that at her place. I work in a small business. Our owner lets some small time purchasers pay over time, even though officially the policy is to allow a much shorter amount of time for someone to pay off a purchase. These are not big spenders, because they don't make a lot of money, nor do we expect them to make a lot of money in the future. However, they are honest, likeable, and enthusiastic about the product. They're a pleasure to deal with.  Good luck with the bra journey!"

ABraThatFits,3axq3t,otterhugs,4,Thu Jun 25 00:07:24 2015 UTC,"So a while back I bought a vintage style bra from someone on r/braswap (its pennywise brand, looks just like jenique to me) but the band was too small for me to try it on. Unfortunately the hooks and eyes had non standard spacing and I couldn't find an extender that would fit it, so I decided to make one myself out of four separate single hook extenders. I found out it was cheaper to buy  hook and eye closures meant for making bras and lingerie than to buy premade extenders, so I ordered some of those and then just let the project sit and gather dust. Today I finally sewed the hook and eye closures together to make the extenders and was able to try the bra on! And the of course the cups didn't fit haha. But it was mostly that there was a lot of extra space at the nipple, and being that it was only a two part cup (well its four part because there is this inner support stuff, but the main part of the cup that was too big is only two parts) it didnt look like it would be super difficult to take in. At this point I only have the left cup basted into place but it fits great! And was way easier to do than I was thinking it would be. =) I didnt expect to like the pointyness as much as i do either, I'm so happy with it I'm actually considering buying the super pointy gossard bra u/noys suggested to me in last week's weekly discussion (I was asking what bra Batwoman would wear). =)  Edit: anyone in the UK willing to check how much it would cost for you to buy and forward this bra to me?? The seller doesn't ship to the US =( http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/GOSSARD-8511-RETROLUTION-HALF-PADDED-D-G-BRA-BLACK-30G-36-/361257502841"

I'm not sure why only the smaller sizes seem to show up cheap, you'd think that less people would buy a bra with a really huge cup size."
ABraThatFits,3axq3t,otterhugs,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:12:22 2015 UTC,"Well, I just finished it, I ended up putting in darts on the top part of the cup as well, it wasn't really necessary but it gives it a cleaner look and as a bonus its even more pointy with the darts lol. The left cup is slightly less projected and pointy than the right, which is kind of annoying but not noticible under a shirt (and probably wouldnt be noticible without a shirt to anyone that wasnt looking for it) and might just be due to the fact my left breast is slightly smaller and a slightly different shape than my right so I'm not going to drive myself crazy trying to re-do it. What I'm really stuck on is if I want to trim the excess fabric in the cup where I took it in, I kind of do because it would make it look cleaner and smoother (right now you can see a little bit of a lump when I'm not wearing a shirt, with a shirt you can't see it) but at the same time, right now all the alterations I've done are still reversible, and they wouldn't be if I were to trim it. I don't feel comfortable sharing pics of myself in the bra, but if you're interested in seeing the bra by itself and close ups of the sewing I could do that. Also I didnt realize until after I was already done altering it that I havent measured it for Bratabase yet...."

It also gives me the roundest and most minimized shape I've ever had (apart form sport bras).   Also: I changed my mind on the straps of my bikini-top for three reasons:   Where they now sit, they are ugly. Where they now sit, they pull up the back of the band even further.

I had to perform 15 minutes of contortion to figure out how to get them on without killing my bra or myself, and they put soooo much tension on the straps, it's super uncomfortable!

ABraThatFits,3axq3t,drawingdwarf,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:46:06 2015 UTC,There are little straps which are similar to a racerback clip. They don't bring the straps as close together so it might be more comfortable.  When I use some sort of clip I put it on the bra first and then stick my head through the opening. Way easier than trying to do it up behind me.
ABraThatFits,3axq3t,buymeflowers,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:37:11 2015 UTC,"I think I saw those straps! They looked just like bra straps, right? I will have to order them.  That was originally what I did, putting the clip on first, but I had to really tug and pull on the cups and wires to maneuver the bra on that way, I instantly started feeling guilty that I was hurting my poor bra xD (I also poked myself in the eye a bunch lol).  I tried again today and i think my problems are because my breasts are so low set -- I usually only tighten straps an inch or two from their longest setting.

I'm hoping the top is open enough to fit but not too high to gape and that it gives decent projection. I couldn't not buy it even though so many people have documented mixed feelings about it online. It was $9.99 and I'm down to one bra that fits well (Panache Envy) and one that's super comfy but a cup too small (PrimaDonna Madison).   Somehow, the top part of the wings on my beloved (white) Envy turned purple-ish after I hand washed it by itself in the same lingerie wash I always use. I tried various things to get it out (Resolve spray and Rit dye remover) but it's still faintly there. Oddly enough, it has changed from purple-ish to orange-ish. It's really embedded in the fabric. I am debating trying a banking soda paste (with either vinegar or hydrogen peroxide) or just leaving the darn thing alone."
ABraThatFits,3axq3t,noys,4,Thu Jun 25 19:58:22 2015 UTC,Don't use baking soda and vinegar together. They'll react neutralizing each other and there will be no effect on clothing.  Using only one substance at a time is a good rule in general for stain removal.
ABraThatFits,3axq3t,drawingdwarf,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:57:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what would get the discoloration out, but it's possible that there was some sort of optical whitener in the fabric that reacted with something. Sometimes whiteners can turn fabric purple-ish. If that's the case, I don't think it'll come out.  You could try oxyclean but it's really best on organic stains and this sounds like something else. Maybe chlorine free bleach? I'm not sure if it would do more harm than good. There's always just dying the bra."

ABraThatFits,3ax7s2,ShortWide,4,Wed Jun 24 05:52:32 2015 UTC,"It sounds like the bras are small on you if you feel squished. But, the digging issue could be due to the wires being too high, too wide, or too narrow. The gore not tacking in the Deco is probably due to the cup being too shallow or too small.  The first thing I would try is bras with lower wings. Maybe you could check out Cleo -- definitely the opposite of nude, too. As for moulded, I think you might struggle there, but it would be worth checking out Cleo Maddie (or the variants) and maybe size up for the right depth. It's worth checking out I think."

If it gets bigger or if I can't find a bra to accommodate it, I may look into getting it removed.  Although, weird as it sounds, I've grown attached to it.

ABraThatFits,3awqg0,throwaway4boobz,2,Wed Jun 24 02:59:08 2015 UTC,"but unfortunately the wires are wayyy too high on me. When I pull the wires into my IMF, I literally can't lower my arms.   In the photo you got a bulge of tissue between your armpit and the tip of the wire. When you lower your arm, this tissue gets trapped between your armpit and the wire. Most people try to fix this with shorter wires, but in many cases all this does is that more tissue is allowed to escape over the band and even more poking happens.   Can you try to put that tissue into the band and take another photo?    When I let it sit how it wants, I can fit a full 2 fingers in the empty space at the bottom of the cup.    The photo with the two fingers looks like you are not swooped and scooped correctly and that the wires sit still too low.   Try bowing forward and shake your bra out, then push the wires as high as they go into your inframammary fold.   If your armpits are in the way, you really need shorter wires. In this case Fantasie comes to the rescue. Try the Fantasie Jana Side Support.    If it's relevant, I'm only 5'1"" tall.    I think what is happening in your case is that your smaller torso means that you have a smaller root than average. In your case this results in more projected breasts with shorter roots.   Cleo Lucy - agree that the bra is too shallow.  You might want to try more Freya / Fantasie bras because you seem to need the projection. Freya/Fantasie also have shorter wires than Panache."

Not sure if you can tell in the pictures but the wire is actually on my armpit stubble when I lower my arms :/    Try bowing forward and shake your bra out, then push the wires as >high as they go into your inframammary fold.   Thats exactly how I put my bras on D: the only explanation I can think of for why they don't stay that way is the armpit issue, otherwise idk why it won't stay?

ABraThatFits,3awqg0,t_maia,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:36:29 2015 UTC,"otherwise idk why it won't stay?   Because you got very projected breasts. Your breasts want more space in front, so their projection and gravity conspire to push the bra first away from your body and then down.  Your very projected breasts also cause the issue with all the empty space in the bottom, the bra is not properly put on. You need to straighten out the bottom cup. I wrote a description on how to do this several days ago, let me look for it."

Your shape seems to be more balanced so I don't know if you could size down as dramatically. Anyway, I think it's a great bra for short waisted, full cup, small back fits."

Some people also put a wedge of cosmetic sponge under the tips for some padding during the day.  If more than just the tips of the gore hurts, it might be a shape mismatch such as the gore being too wide so that wires sit on your breast tissue.   Which Natori bra model is it?"

Could you please post all 5 measurements as per the beginners guide in the side bar?   Your snug underbust of 29 inches does point towards needing a 30 band. Depending upon your tight underbust and how the bra runs you could maybe get away with a 32 band.   But a 34 and a 36 band are way too wide for your torso. Especially your mother's old stretched out bras will be a horrible fit and give you zero support.     So please go back to Nordstrom and ask to try on some 30F and 30FF bras. Feel free to include 32DD, 32DDD (UK 32E) and 32F into your search.   Nordstrom was relatively close, their 32DD is the widest possible band and smallest possible cup with those two measurements."

ABraThatFits,3avmbo,sewinggrl,2,Tue Jun 23 21:26:50 2015 UTC,"I don't like Elomi's bras. For some reason the wire always gets misshaped.   Elomi has two kinds of wires, the older bras have relatively hard and durable wires while the newer ones have softer and more flexible wires. Yet unlike in some other brands the newer softer wires are still strong enough for large breasts. From my experience they only get bent out of shape if the bandsize is too small. For this reason, have you tried a larger bandsize in Elomi?   Can anyone else recommend some bras that fit like the Tango II?    Panache Tango II Two-Tone 5061 is identical to the Panache Tango II 3251 and the Tango Luxe (6271). Tango Accenti (7331) is also based upon this cut, but it is slightly different. There is also strong indicators that the new Rhapsody (7391) is identical to Tango.   Panache Fern is a shallower version of Tango. I find it too shallow, but others might like it.   Regarding Cleo, Cleo Lucy is a good bra to try if you like the Tango.   Finally there is Goddess Keira/Kayla/Adelaide.  Goddess Rose 6080 might be another option."
ABraThatFits,3avmbo,t_maia,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:21:40 2015 UTC,"From my experience they only get bent out of shape if the bandsize is too small. For this reason, have you tried a larger bandsize in Elomi? If anything I have been wearing too big of a band because they were always trying to fit me into US size H.  So they always had me in 42H. Regarding Cleo, Cleo Lucy is a good bra to try if you like the Tango. Does the Cleo Lucy exact like the Panache? Do I get a 38HH? I heard that other brands bands can be different."
ABraThatFits,3avmbo,t_maia,3,Tue Jun 23 22:36:22 2015 UTC,"What size do you need? What size were the Elomi  bras you tried? Any chance you remember the models?   Cleo Lucy does not fit exactly like the Tango. The wires of Lucy are significantly narrower and the cups are deeper. Lucy is actually closer to the Elomi Caitlyn in shape.   If you want a bra that is exactly like the Tango Two-Tone 5061 try the Tango II Balc 3251.    If anything I have been wearing too big of a band because they were always trying to fit me into US size H. So they always had me in 42H.    Again, which size does the label of the Elomi bra say? UK 42H (=US 42K) or UK 42FF (= US 42H)?  Too small cups and too large band can also distort the wires because then the fine balance between the breast, the bra and gravity does not work.   If you have been put into UK 42H and the band is too large and the cup too small you probably won't fit into a UK 38HH because that is the sistersize to UK 42GG, one cupsize smaller than UK 42H."

I just brought an Elomi in 38HH just like the Panache and I didn't like it. I just don't think the quality is there. Some of the bras were comfortable for a while but the wire would eventually get warped and stick into my ribs. I don't think the quality is there.Grant I always wore their cheapest bra, the Catilyn.

If they put you in 42H/HH it might be you need a larger cup size, say around 38JJ.    Grant I always wore their cheapest bra, the Catilyn.   Caitlyn has a basic shape that is similar to Tango, but the bottom cup of Tango is smaller and the upper cup of the Tango is larger. The cup of Tango is taller and the cup is more open, allowing more top volume. It could be that you need that volume there.   Another potential cause of the wires twisting is torso shape. Bras assume that your torso is shaped like this || when in reality it can be shaped like this  /\ or like this \ _/. If you have the last shape (an athletic or V-shaped torso) all bras will always bent and the underwire will either break or poke you unless you hook your bra uneven."

As far as bras go, for a very projected shape we'd recommend starting with Cleo Lily/Erin, possibly also Panache Jasmine and Panache Envy.   Are you in the UK? You've got the shopping advantage if you are because Panache (and Cleo, which is part of Panache) is a UK brand. Many online bra retailers are also based in the UK and have free shipping for people in the UK. You can also find these bras at Bravissimo if you've got one nearby, and possibly at Debenhams as well.

ABraThatFits,3av1of,joanna70,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:05:33 2015 UTC,"I feel like very few people end up wearing Freya plunge balconies, and that's why we know so little about their individual idiosyncrasies. I know the Patsy plunge is shorter than the others, Ada is good for relatively even shapes, Arabella needs at least some upper fullness to fill out the top of the tall cup, Nancy/Doodle is super pointy on literally everyone, and of course Gem and Rio are the FoT ones. (They don't have any clones, they exist in a class of their own.) But there are a couple other cuts that I don't really know about, and the balcony bras which hardly anyone wears because of wire instability.

You can check out the offline retailer list for stores in your area if you're not sure where to shop - note the ""locator service"" links at the top for finding stores that carry specific brands (Cleo is a sub-brand of Panache so if you'd like to try Cleo Lucy or Cleo Kali head to the Panache website)."

They've got lots of selection from our most recommended brands, and past-season stock is usually discounted pretty well.   The UK is an online bra wonderland (and a pretty good place to buy bras in brick-and-mortar stores too)! Lots of online bra retailers do free shipping in the UK. You've also got Bravissimo, Debenhams, and Boux Avenue making your size for sure, and Marks & Spencer possibly making it.   Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are a bit trickier. Canada's Amazon isn't as well-stocked as the US or UK versions, and I don't know if Australia and New Zealand have Amazon.   Asia has its own websites like aliexpress which have super cute, cheap stuff. I'd buy from there but I'm sure shipping to the US is astronomically expensive - more than the cost of the bra. (And 28F isn't particularly common on the Asian market. With 36F, though, brands like Triumph will carry your size.)

ABraThatFits,3atw4b,PolkaDotPeacock,2,Tue Jun 23 13:54:09 2015 UTC,"Could you list your 5 measurements from the measuring guide, just for us to double check?  It looks like you've got more armpit chub on your left side than on your right side in the picture of you facing forward - do you think some of that might be breast tissue that has leaked out from moving your arm? I think that's part of why the outer wires are so uncomfortable for you - it could be poking breast tissue.  Panache's wires are known for being very tall and pokey, so you are certainly not the only one who has this problem! The wires under the armpits are 5"" from the bottom of the band to the top in your size, so you'll want something shorter than that. Panache's sub-brand Cleo tends to have shorter wires on the sides, but the band is also narrower as a result, with only a two-hook fastening instead of three hooks.  Also, Goddess uses American sizing, so you'll want to order the Goddess bra in 36K to get it in the same size as the Panache Jasmine you've got here. That's probably why it feels tight on the left breast, as it seems like that's your larger breast."
ABraThatFits,3atw4b,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Tue Jun 23 18:52:47 2015 UTC,"do you think some of that might be breast tissue that has leaked out from moving your arm?   If this happens the solution to this is not shorter wires, but taller ones. With shorter wires the only thing that happens is that there is even more overspill and thus more poking. Other things to consider is projection and wire width - you are more likely to get underarm spillage if the cup is too shallow or the wires are too narrow."

Going to try ordering a 36I today)    Try a 36K in Goddess. UK 36H = US 36K in Goddess. Also, which Goddess bra do you have? Could you maybe add photos of the Goddess bra?   but when I lower my arms, the wire feels very high into my armpit.   The wire feels high, but it is far lower than it could be. If you look at the first photo there has got to be around 4 finger width between the tip of the underwire and your armpit. The reason you get poked is because you got all this migrated tissue and fluff under your arms. This escapes over the band of the bra when you lift your arms up and then gets caught between your armpit and the underwire when you bring your arms down. It is especially a problem on your left (?) side because it is the larger one.   I have the very same problem with Panache Andorra/Envy/Jasmine and my solution has been to wear the Panache Tango II Balconette. It has taller wires that cover more space under my arm, this prevents the tissue from escaping over the band."

ABraThatFits,3atvtw,Saskia_C,3,Tue Jun 23 14:15:12 2015 UTC,It also kind of depends on the dress...would she need a backless bra as well? We recently got a good review of a super cheap sticky bra.
ABraThatFits,3atvtw,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Tue Jun 23 15:02:13 2015 UTC,"TLBC Sascha maybe. It's got removable push-up pads and the band runs at least a size small, maybe more in the black colorway.

ABraThatFits,3atvtw,Gilliegrl4,2,Tue Jun 23 21:47:11 2015 UTC,I thought TLBC ran small in the cup as well? Is the Sascha more true to size?
ABraThatFits,3atvtw,drawingdwarf,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:48:01 2015 UTC,"I think the whole ""TLBC runs a size small in the band and cup"" is exaggerated. If you check Bratabase you'll see that most of the bands are true to size with a few exceptions and the cups have measurements similar to bras of the same size with a few exceptions. That being said, i did find Sascha to be true to size in the cup and a size small in the band (30B lace/pearl anyways)."
ABraThatFits,3atvtw,Gilliegrl4,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:59:16 2015 UTC,That's good to know! Since I'm not in the size range I've never had to opportunity to find out for myself what they're like.
ABraThatFits,3atvtw,drawingdwarf,2,Wed Jun 24 16:58:53 2015 UTC,"TLBC's Sascha most definitely runs small in the band if you get the lace version. The smooth version has more stretch in the band. I tried a 30C in the white lace, and it was almost too tight for me (25.5 underbust, 24.5 tight). It probably would have stretched to a comfortable fit, but the cup shape was completely wrong for me, so I returned it.  Your friend would probably do best in the lace version in 28B/C. The black one might run even tighter than the white one due to the dye in the fabric. I found the cups to run more true to size than other TLBC models."
ABraThatFits,3atvtw,mellowjello88,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:02:01 2015 UTC,She messaged me her measurements (added to the post) so I'm thinking she'll be better off with a 26. As for the tall roots that's mostly a guess on my part. She's pretty much flat chested and I seem to remember reading somewhere that small shallow breasts are usually accompanied with tall roots but I could be wrong.   I'll ask her what she thinks about the Sascha. Thanks!
ABraThatFits,3atvtw,drawingdwarf,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:38:58 2015 UTC,"Depending on the dress her best bet might be getting cups sewn into the dress. Since strapless options are limited, finding one that fits and then wearing it with separate push up pads would likely be a good option too."
ABraThatFits,3atvtw,drawingdwarf,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:24:05 2015 UTC,That's what I'm thinking. A quick glance at websites of local shops doesn't offer much of anything under a 30 band. I'll get a better idea of what she's looking for and what her measurements are this week and report back. I was almost afraid of getting her to measure herself because I knew her band would be a 24 or 26 which we definitely won't be able to find locally. Poor thing has so much trouble with clothes
ABraThatFits,3atvtw,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Tue Jun 23 18:30:00 2015 UTC,She'll probably need to get adept at taking in the band unfortunately. I always get so annoyed with clothing companies when I fit into an extra small because I'm just sort of averagely small and there are so many people out there who need much smaller sizes. Stupid vanity sizing.

Three inches of extra fabric is probably more than you need, esp. if it rides up. It also seems like the bra is more projected than your breasts (hence the looseness up top and the extra space at the centre cup). I agree that the wires are too wide but I don't believe that Parfait is known for narrow wires. There are many brands with narrower ones - all of the Polish brands, for example. And probably some of the UK. Empreinte is also narrower."

ABraThatFits,3arqsk,M_tridactyla,2,Tue Jun 23 17:15:05 2015 UTC,"Instead of too projected, it could also be that the bra is cut for more upper fullness than your breasts. I had a Parfait half-padded that was pretty shallow and open on top. The Deco Vibe that you tried and liked is at least somewhat closed on top.   Do you consider yourself full on bottom?"

ABraThatFits,3arqsk,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:49:06 2015 UTC,"With your FOB shape, and the underwire riding up, I think this bra is cut for FOT, possibly too wide (underwires on sides like you said?) and potentially not projected enough (rides up; you need to S&S)-- although the riding up could definitely be because it is a 30 band and you'd do better in 28 like the others said.  Freya's unlined plunge bras are cut for FOB and narrow, but are also pretty closed on top. Worth a go if you can get them from ASOS or Amazon. Have you tried Cleo Lucy or Cleo Kali? They are the standard recommended bras for projected and FOB. You can often find Cleo bras on ASOS with free shipping and returns (if your total is like $40+), or Amazon."
ABraThatFits,3arqsk,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:10:13 2015 UTC,"I went from 32DD to 30F as well! However I do much better with 28FF, especially in Freya as their bands run a bit big. Cleos I need 30F as they run small. I think as /u/KristinM100 said you would also do better with a 28 band since your ribcage is so small, and your tight measurement is a very large difference from your snug measurement.   I also have the same problem with some of the gores pushing into my breasts and also trying to shove them apart. This happened more with the bras that were not quite fitting properly- when I got into a well-fitted 28FF and my 30F Cleos I found that the gore didn't bother me at all anymore."
ABraThatFits,3arqsk,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:30:08 2015 UTC,"FWIW about the gore: No, they come much, much narrower than that! :) I'm currently wearing an Anna Pardel for Comexim in 36FF and the gore is maaaaybe half the width of the one you've got - about 1cm wide. I think the difference is that on the AP bra, the gore stays narrow for most of the way down, instead of flaring out at the botton in a wide inverted V the way it does on the bra you're wearing.   I am by no means an expert, but I think those thinner gores are usually on bras that have a narrower wire width. Which, if you're complaining about the underwire being on your side, might be helpful there, too."

Plunges typically recommended for shallow shapes like Masquerade Tiffany, Masquerade Alice, Gossard Superboost, Lepel Fiore Padded Plunge would also be worth a look.     If she still prefers wireless, take a look at the Bestform UK (Fully Line) 535 (sometimes also 1205).

ABraThatFits,3atzi9,Goddess_Keira,2,Sat Jun 27 19:33:23 2015 UTC,"The Panache Andorra tends to be relatively tight initially but soon stretches out after a few wears and after all the starch has been washed out. For this reason I would use an extender for the first month or so. I would not go up to a 38 band with her measurments, once the bra has stretched out it will be too loose on her."
ABraThatFits,3arztd,Kurisuchein,7,Tue Jun 23 01:09:21 2015 UTC,"The best way to figure out root height and width is to try on bras that have well-known shape characteristics. Like if you try on Cleo Marcie and the wires are a bit too wide, then you almost certainly have narrow roots.   As far as measuring things go, Bratabase is the closest you can get to that. You can measure the cup width of bras you like and find bras with relatively similar widths. Unfortunately, it doesn't have a measurement for cup height."
ABraThatFits,3arztd,crazymusicalgenius96,6,Tue Jun 23 02:15:31 2015 UTC,"Additionally, there's no real practical way to measure your root height and width if you don't know where your roots stop!"

ABraThatFits,3arztd,joanna70,3,Tue Jun 23 10:17:16 2015 UTC,Sadly.  Keep good records - photos of all bras on you including labels - and compare measurements with those on bratabase (bearing in mind potential for user error).

ABraThatFits,3arztd,dwellondreams,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:04:38 2015 UTC,Does Canadian Amazon have Cleo Marcie? I saw that post a couple of days ago that said the bra section had been expanded but I wasn't sure if Panache was part of that.
ABraThatFits,3arztd,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:39:43 2015 UTC,"Seems to, but to my British eyes it seems really expensive. Obviously someone Canadian would probably have better recommendations!

ABraThatFits,3arztd,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:49:02 2015 UTC,"Converting from CAD to USD it's only $10 more than typical US retail price. But US retail is $10-15 more than UK retail. So she might have a better deal getting the bra from Bravissimo, even with shipping!  And I keep my eye on all those websites too. =) Mostly Amazon, as that's the easiest and most efficient way for me to get bras (yay Prime), but I've got braswap, ASOS, Ebay, and zulily open, as well as Comexim's website and Ewa's website with a currency converter between USD and zlotys. I really should get a PayPal account to take advantage of the deals I find on those sites...but I told myself no Polish until I actually need the narrowness. The UK brands are working out fine for my average width."
ABraThatFits,3asete,Petiteplusbrahelps,4,Tue Jun 23 03:20:35 2015 UTC,So the underwire might be poking you because cups being too small can distort wires. Trying some things on in close to the right size will help you get an idea of what fits best. I wear a 38gg or h depending on style and my measurements are close but not identical to yours. I also have narrow shoulders and getting in the right cup size helped so much with things falling. A uk h is like a us I/j many systems (all the us ones don't work the same so it's harder to say; there's a chart of brands in the sidebar) but searching 38gg or 38h on Amazon will get you lots of uk brands to try. If you have prime it's free shipping and returns. We can tell fit issues best in unlined (not molded cup) bras so if you get a couple of those and post fit checks experts here can help figure out what styles might work better.
ABraThatFits,3asete,lauracb,3,Tue Jun 23 10:47:56 2015 UTC,"Elomi Rita and Elomi Etta are twos bra that are cut for a shorter torso. Additionally Elomi is a plus-size brand, I've found that the straps in Elomi are closer together.   I also heard good things about Wacoal in regard to strap placement, but the wires can be quite tall.    A lot of bras fall off my shoulders.   In your case that might be caused by too small cups. In bras with too small cups the breasts push against the cup, which then pulls at the strap and the strap slides off.    currently all my bras have the underwire poking me in the underarm or in the armpit.    This can also be caused by a too small cup. If the cup is too small, breast tissue gets pushed towards your back. So the tissue ends up sitting under and above the underwires. The tissue under the wires bends the wires outwards towards your arms and you get poked into the underside of your upper arms. The tissue above the wire gets trapped between wire and armpit, you get poked in a spot under your armpit,  making you think the wire is too long. In this case  longer wires that contain the tissue under the band might actually help. Or a larger, more projected cup."

ABraThatFits,3as5z4,fitzbra,2,Tue Jun 23 04:00:30 2015 UTC,"Check the offline retailer listing for Ontario as well. Change is fine, but if you're not wide/shallow, you may need more options.   You could try UK sizes 36DD-E and 34E-F. Some brands like Chantelle and Simone Perele skip DD, so your range for those would  be 36E-F and 34F-G."
ABraThatFits,3aschv,long_cool_woman,6,Tue Jun 23 02:59:53 2015 UTC,"The Feathers is really really really shallow, so your breasts are likely pushing the bra down and the wires out of your IMF with their projection.  I don't think there's any way to fix that unless you somehow added fabric to the cups which seems really difficult.  /r/braswap or Bratabase or Ebay?"
ABraThatFits,3aschv,M_tridactyla,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:13:17 2015 UTC,"The wires aren't out away from my body, they're on my torso, just south of where they need to be. It's like the cup is too tall for me, or the underwire is too U shaped. I wish i could explain it better! I don't have an imgur account, I'll see if I can figure it out.  My breats are pretty shallow I think, but you're right, Feathers is reeeally shallow. The only other bra that I really liked was the L'Agent Vanesa, but they only had it in DD which was too small. Gah I loved it though.  I may try braswap, thanks!"
ABraThatFits,3aschv,-tallywa-,9,Tue Jun 23 04:42:18 2015 UTC,"That can still be because of its shallowness. She wasn't saying that it was pushing the bra away from your chest horizontally, but that since your breasts are too projected for the cup, the bra moves downward to find an area of the cup that it fits into better. It's like... Trying to fit a balloon under a tight fitting shirt. There just isn't enough room for the width of the balloon so it's likely to move down to get out of the material that's restricting it. There isn't enough room in that area of the bra but since your breast is rooted to the one spot on your chest, it's the bra that moves downward."
ABraThatFits,3aschv,CrystalElyse,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:32:05 2015 UTC,"It sounds like a shape mismatch to me. Most likely, the fabric of the cup is too shallow for you. The Natori bras tend to run very shallow. You won't be able to fix the bra itself, but as long as it's comfortable on you it will still be fine to wear for as long as the elastic lasts. This sub tends to get very on a checklist of perfection, but the most important thing is your personal comfort.   If it's not comfortable, you could try /r/braswap or bratabase to sell or exchange it. The next time you look for a bra, you may want to try something with a deeper cup.   Depending on what stores you have near you, you may like the (in order of least deep to deeper):    Parfait Jeanie or Casey Cleo Jude Victoria's Secret Cotton Full Coverage (you may have to order online, I'm not sure if they carry DDD/E cups in stores)  Freya Deco Cleo Juna  Panache Tango II Fantasie Smoothing T Shirt Freya Pollyanna   This graphic has a good list of bra projections which I picked from. Since you originally opted for a somewhat shallow bra, I picked from about the middle of the list down and didn't include the really projected ones.   Edit: As it turns out that graphics list is very outdated. The strikethrough text are ones that others have said will probably not work for you, or potentially anyone."
ABraThatFits,3aschv,joanna70,3,Tue Jun 23 15:40:51 2015 UTC,"Nobody seems to be able to agree on Casey/Jeanie, I've seen it recommended as better for FOB than Deco, and therefore at least moderately projected and then others saying it's shallow...it will vary with scaling but I can't imagine it's THAT different...Jude is never to be recommended, fitted no-one hence they changed the design and the Neve was the result, marginally better but not much.  A lot of the bra lists in the side bar are out of date.  Feathers is indeed super shallow, I think you could try almost anything (search ""diagnostic"" on here for the bras that are super useful to try before you know your shape) and find out more about what might fit."

ABraThatFits,3aqusq,toastNcheeze,13,Mon Jun 22 19:43:54 2015 UTC,"They both seem like Panache bras to me. My guess is that your bras came from different seasons, and so were manufactured differently. The tag on your beige one looks just like the tag on my Masquerade Medina, so maybe they're of the same vintage - which would be AW2012. However, I have no idea when Panache changed their tags as I don't own any other Panache bras, so it could certainly be newer than that.  Also, your black one is a Porcelain Elan, is the tan one the same model number? There are several Porcelain models, and they all have their own idiosyncrasies."

ABraThatFits,3aqusq,t_maia,2,Mon Jun 22 21:33:47 2015 UTC,"The tag end on your black bra looks just like the end of my (black) Panache Sport. It's tagless with the sizing info printed on it, and it's that same padded fabric. Your beige bra has the kind of fabric that is typical on most bras. I have no idea if Panache is only changing this on black bras or if they're going to it for all their bras in future.  I doubt the bra you got on line was a knock-off, but it could have been old stock, or returned stock, and sometimes companies have their goods manufactured in more than one country--this happens with running shoes a lot. Your black bra was made in China; where was the beige one made? And maybe a silly question, but did you double-check that the sizes are actually the same? In the picture, I can't see the size on the beige bra at all and the black looks to be 28FF? Although different colourways have been known fit slightly differently, especially if they were cut during different seasons or manufactured in different countries.  Edit: Looking more closely at the photo of the two together, the beige one seems clearly to be shorter in the unstretched band, and slightly different in design. Could be /u/crazymusicalgenius96 is correct that they're different model numbers."
ABraThatFits,3aqusq,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Mon Jun 22 20:03:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response. I've determined that they are different models.

It is extremely common to find imitations of certain designs. We don't have VS where I live, but three weeks after the VS Angels were on TV you can buy bras that are a very similar design at stores that do teen fashion, I think it was Forever 18?  FrÃ¤ulein Annie has been copied by H&M and Marks&Spencers have ripped off Elomi.     2) Cut. A few years back Boux Avenue clearly made copies of a few Panache and Cleo bras, copying the cut but using different lace.   3) Straight out copies. There is a Chinese company that sells what looks like ShockAbsorber and Panache bras in sizes 32-38 C-F on amazon and ebay, only difference is that there is no label."

They're good bras but aren't going to have what you need, projection wise, in your size range. And the wires are going to be even longer than Cleos, which is doing you no favors with trying to get them in your IMF properly.  Other than Cleo Meg, or maybe an unlined Freya plunge (though they have lots of bottom projection, they are not particularly short root friendly, I'm not sure it's worth a try), I would definitely start looking at polish brands next."

ABraThatFits,3aqttr,lemonadeandlavender,8,Mon Jun 22 19:36:31 2015 UTC,"Okay, so for breastfeeding, your milk doesn't regulate until 3 months, so you probably shouldn't get any type of expensive bra until then. Ladies here recommend waiting 6 months.   Because of the nipple pain and soreness, it's usually recommended to get a shelf bra tank top. Women say bravado is the best."
ABraThatFits,3aqttr,ludecknight,2,Mon Jun 22 20:48:31 2015 UTC,Agree with this. Personally I loved the bravado tanks. The bravado ones at target are wonderful also. That is what I lived in for so long and made it easy to nurse and stay covered.
ABraThatFits,3aqttr,cutieful,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:38:53 2015 UTC,So glad they have them at Target! That's helpful for sizing.
ABraThatFits,3aqttr,ludecknight,2,Sun Jun 28 01:32:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the heads up! I had no idea it took that look for milk to regulate. I'll definitely look into this style bra. I have a bra that is similar to this, and although it doesn't fit very well, it at least isn't uncomfortable. I imagine comfort is more important than fit while milk supply is regulating."
ABraThatFits,3aqttr,kiln,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:32:36 2015 UTC,Comfort and not pushing on your milk ducts! So it needs to be a correctly fitting bra/shelf tank.
ABraThatFits,3aqttr,fragmentidea,6,Sun Jun 28 19:45:22 2015 UTC,"I have heard good things about getting bras altered at Nordstroms to make them into nursing bras.  First baby, I had bravado bras from Amazon.  I needed more support than a Target nursing tank offered.  They were fine but didn't do much for me in terms of me looking and feeling good. The second time around I got Hot Milk bras (both from Amazon and Zulily). They were much better, but they had an awful lot of embroidery and such that were fine during the winter, but not so great under a t-shirt in warmer months.  I just got an Anita nursing bra from Amazon and omg.... it is AMAZING.  It is underwire, but I am not prone to clogged ducts.  Plus, it fits me like a dream and don't think it would cause any problems for me.  I wish I had discovered it 4 years ago!"
ABraThatFits,3aqttr,kiln,2,Mon Jun 22 23:42:30 2015 UTC,"I have to second the Anita brand bras.  I bought 2 of these when I returned to work at 4 months postpartum. I was measured at 38i, (U.S. Sizing) and they lasted until my son weaned at 11.5 months.  The underwire pooped out of both so I don't know if I would use them again. My boobs definitely need an underwire and no Target/destination maternity bra worked with my size. http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0019SBMJ0/ref=mp_s_a_1_5?qid=1435020440&sr=8-5&pi=AC_SX110_SY165_QL70&keywords=Anita&dpPl=1&dpID=51rUR3LlAXL&ref=plSrch"

Around 6-8 months with supply regulation and weight loss I found it was no longer doing its job so I bought a soft structured bravado nursing bra and the rest is history. I have rebought it twice when I lost more weight and also have bought their sized nursing tanks. If I were to do it all over again I would have switched the way I bought the bras. I would have bought the nursing tank and soft structured bravado bras first since I pretty well.lived shirtless for the first few months and waited to splurge on the underwire anita because it made the girls look fabulous and it was expensive."
ABraThatFits,3aqttr,mrssirah,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:49:41 2015 UTC,Thank you for your advice. I will start with the less-structured nursing bras until my breasts regulate and then I'll splurge on the more expensive nursing bras. I don't really like how wide the straps are on the Anita nursing bras.. I feel like it'll limit what I can wear. But I think I can get over that for the first three months!
ABraThatFits,3aqttr,yellkaa,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:41:10 2015 UTC,I wore the Anita Clara through pregnancy and had it converted to a nursing bra. I absolutely  love this brand. The straps in the clara are wide and padded and it may be the most supportive and comfortable bra I've ever worn. I have been waiting for my supply to stabilize so I can go try on their nursing bras locally and then stock up.
ABraThatFits,3arja6,elleandmia,4,Mon Jun 22 22:47:30 2015 UTC,"A 30F is one sister size up and will certainly be much closer to your measured 28FF than the 34D you're wearing now. Actually, with your snug and tight measures being only an inch apart, you may prefer the 30 band for comfort.  As for 26 bands, for the most part they are only available as custom orders, but in any case that's smaller than even your tight measurement and so it is too small of a band. No need to worry about getting that size. :)"

ABraThatFits,3aqin5,MyKaleidoscopeEyes,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:12:41 2015 UTC,"It's easiest to figure out shape if you try bras in the same band size and two different cup volumes (say, 30E and 30F) rather than trying the bra in the same cup volume with two different band sizes (which is what you did). The only major difference between the 30Es and 32DDs you tried is that the band is longer.   From your descriptions it sounds like 30E is approximately the correct cup volume, as Maddie does run a bit small. You probably need average width wires or slightly wider, as the shallow bras you're describing as too wide and the narrow and projected bras you're describing as too narrow.   Masquerade Rhea is wide, shallow, and has almost no room at all on the bottom. Since you're more evenly shaped than full on top, the top of the cup gapes and the bottom isn't filled because your boob has too much fullness there. These issues are exacerbated because you are probably a bit too projected for it as well.   My recommendations would be to try Freya Patsy padded half cup, and if that is still too wide and shallow, with not enough space for your bottom fullness, to move to the narrower half cups. Freya Lauren half cup is slightly narrower than Patsy, and Fauve and Masquerade half cups (besides Rhea) will be narrower still. The half cups are nice and open on top for the most part so they won't cut into your upper tissue."

I'm not an expert in the nursing arena, but I do believe that our typical nursing conversion advice could be helpful. If she finds a suit she likes, as long as it has bra-style straps, she could alter it to attach with nursing bra clips pretty easily. I don't know how well this would work for halter-tie tops, but I would imagine in those scenarios you could just untie or loosen the top to nurse."

ABraThatFits,3aqeht,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:40:38 2015 UTC,Even after I do the sweep and swoop I have a lot of extra gaps between my breast and the bra on top.
ABraThatFits,3aqeht,hurrrrrmione,3,Tue Jun 23 02:41:49 2015 UTC,That doesn't necessarily mean those bras are too large. It could just be they are the wrong shape for your breasts.   Have you checked out the shape guide?
ABraThatFits,3aqeht,t_maia,2,Tue Jun 23 03:22:24 2015 UTC,I have read it and figured out that I am projected with pretty much even fullness and my root is in the middle not wide or narrow. I am just not sure what to do with this information
ABraThatFits,3aqeht,hurrrrrmione,3,Tue Jun 23 16:04:17 2015 UTC,"Do a mental exercise. Hold a dinner plate in front of one of your breasts. Because of how the dinner plate is shaped and how your breasts are shaped, the breasts covers only a small amount of the dinner plate. A lot of the surface of the dinner plate stays empty. Now take a cereal bowl. The cereal bowl will cover your breast much better, simply because your breasts can go in deeper.   Your C-cup bras are sitting on your breasts like a dinner plate. You get gaping because the bras are meant for breasts that stick out less than yours do, so the breasts end up pushing the bra away."
ABraThatFits,3as1a2,katsandtatts,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:22:36 2015 UTC,I tend to be a bit more full on the bottom and I find the top portion of the cup always hangs forward on the 32b.    By hanging forward do you mean there's empty space between the top of the cup and your breasts?
ABraThatFits,3as1a2,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:35:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's as if my straps are too big"
ABraThatFits,3as1a2,hurrrrrmione,2,Tue Jun 23 02:03:10 2015 UTC,"That's likely a shape mismatch, which makes sense since you said you're full-on-bottom. The bra is expecting you to have more breast tissue on top than you have. You're correct that sometimes this can be fixed by tightening the straps, and sometimes if people have high-set breasts or short torsos bra straps can be too long on them even on the shortest setting, but if you've experimented with tightening your straps and this happens with many bras, a shape mismatch is most likely.  I do think a 30C will fit you a lot better since 32B has a band size as large as your standing bust measurement, but you're still going to have to watch for bra cuts and shapes. Not every bra in your correct size is going to fit you correctly. There will be some bras where 30C won't fit you right but 32B will. There will be some bras where 32B doesn't fit you right but 30C does. There will also be some bras where they just aren't right for you, no matter what size you try.   30 bands can be hard to find in stores. I know Aerie has 30 bands but I don't know if they carry them in stores. Nordstrom will have some 30C bras. The offline retailer list is a good place to check for stores in your area that might carry 30C. If you're open to ordering online though, that's going to give you a lot more options."
ABraThatFits,3as1a2,drawingdwarf,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:17:46 2015 UTC,"I think 30C sounds about right. Do you think you have a shallow shape? It's fairly common in this size range. It's probably a shape mismatch with your current bras that's causing the empty space in the top of the cup. It could also just be a loose band not holding the bra to your body.  I would look at Calvin Klein, Betsey Johnson, Natori (Feathers in particular), B.tempt'd by Wacoal, and The Little Bra Company to start. Natori Feathers tends to run small in the cup so don't be afraid to try 30D too. For The Little Bra Company I would suggest checking out their Target collaboration since it's actually reasonably priced. If you have a Nordstrom and/or Nordstrom Rack nearby they should have a few options in 30C to try out.  Make sure you scoop and swoop when you put your bras on to get your boobs all the way in the cups."
ABraThatFits,3arjzf,Saskia_C,2,Mon Jun 22 22:53:26 2015 UTC,I went to a Change in Toronto and they definitely had 28s/60s there.

ABraThatFits,3arjzf,noys,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:23:05 2015 UTC,Did you try any molded strapless ones? They were surprisingly projected.
ABraThatFits,3arjzf,noys,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:23:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, I did. I found that in my size they were too shallow, even for me. They were sitting under my IMF and there was empty fabric at the bottoms of the cups. Also, I found that they were too closed in on top. There is literally only one lingerie brand that makes strapless bras that can actually accommodate my tall roots (Cleo). Also, Change's strapless bras had gores that were too high."
ABraThatFits,3arjzf,noys,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:29:50 2015 UTC,When I was on the smaller side of 32G I could get away with a Change strapless bra in 70F. That should be 32E/F equivalent but it was extremely projected and open on top.
ABraThatFits,3aqixx,Angeldown,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:14:58 2015 UTC,"You've also got a bit of cutting in along the top lace panel -- these little fit quirks could indicate a shape mismatch, but overall it's quite close, I think it's worth trying a cup size up."
ABraThatFits,3aqixx,buymeflowers,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:00:16 2015 UTC,"What does ""cutting in"" mean?  Sorry, I haven't been around here too long!  Is it like the quad-boob?  Because I did notice a teensy bit of that where the cup meets the lace."
ABraThatFits,3aqixx,buymeflowers,2,Mon Jun 22 19:05:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is what I was referring to. You'll see both terms tossed around (along with 'quadding'), they're pretty much interchangeable though I personally think quad-boob is more severe looking than what you've got going on here."
ABraThatFits,3aqixx,buymeflowers,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:49:02 2015 UTC,"I agree with you.  It wasn't noticeable enough for it to bother me at first (this is the cutest bra I've ever had, I really wanted it to fit!), but after a bit more time looking it over, it does seem just a bit too small in the cup.    It's too bad that the 30H is twice as expensive :/  At least now I know what sizes to order for this brand in the future!"
ABraThatFits,3aqixx,buymeflowers,3,Mon Jun 22 20:59:31 2015 UTC,"It's too bad that the 30H is twice as expensive :/    Are you ordering from amazon? Purple is brand new, give it some time, it'll probably go on sale soon   At least now I know what sizes to order for this brand in the future!   Unfortunately it really doesn't work this way with Curvy Kate :(  The brand has struggled with shape issues in the past, and while 2015 has shown great improvement, sizing is kind of all over the place.  Have you tried any Cleo bras?"
ABraThatFits,3aqixx,dwellondreams,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:05:39 2015 UTC,"I did order from Amazon!  I was thrilled that this one was so cheap in my size, but I think I will definitely wait before ordering the more expensive 30H, if I get it at all.  I think I really prefer padded bras anyways.  That's good to know about Curvy Kate.  They have a few really cute ones, but I guess I'll wait a bit and see if they continue improving!  I haven't tried Cleo yet, but I want to.  I think I'll make it my goal to find a reasonably-priced Cleo bra next.  Any recommendations?"
ABraThatFits,3aqixx,pennycenturie,3,Mon Jun 22 21:12:11 2015 UTC,"I would start with Cleo Marcie, or some of the sister cuts, I think you've possibly got a bit too much upper fullness for Lucy."
ABraThatFits,3apxvy,annihilatrixxx,7,Mon Jun 22 15:37:06 2015 UTC,"Nordstrom is actually really good for bras in our size range, and if they aren't having sales/your budget is lower, go try them on there and then order online. :) Amazon carries a lot of the same brands for less. I'm a 38 GG/H and my local nordstrom had a lot of options. I'm pretty sure there's at least 1 with a good lingerie department in Chicago."
ABraThatFits,3apxvy,lauracb,2,Mon Jun 22 15:59:50 2015 UTC,"Oh, good to know! The last time I went to Nordstrom, the older lady who fitted me told me they didn't have my size and to lose weight. If it was just her own body image issues talking and they do go up to 38H, I'll just go back and try to deal with another sales associate."
ABraThatFits,3apxvy,atheologist,5,Mon Jun 22 16:09:59 2015 UTC,It does vary by store. Some go up to an H cup or higher. Others don't go past a G and sometimes only in certain brands. But the lady who fitted you sounds like she has issues that need to be addressed. It is never appropriate to tell a customer to lose weight. I'd have complained to management/corporate about that comment.
ABraThatFits,3apxvy,lauracb,2,Mon Jun 22 18:25:19 2015 UTC,"Nobody's ever ragging on other people because they're cool with themselves. I would've felt too bad reporting her. I will definitely check out a couple of locations, thanks!:)"
ABraThatFits,3apxvy,LadyVerene,3,Tue Jun 23 17:24:37 2015 UTC,"you can call ahead to check - ask if they carry ""full bust"" brands like Panache, Goddess, or Elomi, all of them come up to your size. I bet some locations don't carry them, but both within an hour of me do, and it seems that many do from user comments here.   ETA: once you try on a couple in close to the right size you'll have a better idea of shape and we can give you advice about styles to get. I found it hard to judge my shape in too small bras because my shape was just ""squished"""
ABraThatFits,3apxvy,lauracb,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:12:05 2015 UTC,"It varies a lot by location. At the Nordstrom near me, the only UK brand they carry at all is Elomi and they only have two models (Caitlyn and Bijou). They are literally the only bras above a ~34F in the entire store."
ABraThatFits,3apxvy,SaltyBlackBroad,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:55:20 2015 UTC,"LOL I was actually trying to determine my shape last night and could not tell even trying to just simulate a well-fitting bra with my hands. I actually have a very pretty Panache that I ordered in a 40D before finding this sub. It definitely does not fit even a little bit, though the quality is such that I bet that brand in my real size would rock. I've seen Elomi on ASOS and Zulily, and will have to look Goddess up. Thank you!"
ABraThatFits,3apxvy,suria_,2,Tue Jun 23 17:32:17 2015 UTC,"Panache Envy is my best-fitting bra. There's really cute ones from Cleo by Panache, too, but my local doesn't carry them so I've mostly tried on and sent back those through Amazon. If you end up ordering online a lot of people suggest Cleo Lucy and Marcie as good shape indicating bras - how they behave with your chest is an easy way to at least get some idea of what your shape is.   ETA if 38GG or H is your size and it turns out you're wide-rooted (which I am definitely not) I missed the return window on Parfait Charlotte and I'd be happy to re-home it to someone instead of squishing myself into it occasionally because I feel bad having spent the money and it's such a cute bra :)"
ABraThatFits,3apxvy,amreb,3,Tue Jun 23 21:04:03 2015 UTC,She...she told you to lose weight? Seriously?
ABraThatFits,3apxvy,LadyVerene,2,Mon Jun 22 18:48:47 2015 UTC,"I think it might be cultural thing, because the polish granny who cleans my office building also told me to lose weight and I think she's from the same area of the world and generation as my Nordstrom fitter. I am straddling the line between straight and plus sizes (I'm fat/body positive), so while I'm used to unsolicited advice, it does remain astonishingly unhelpful. Especially when I have cash in hand and need an item of clothing immediately. Every time someone criticizes my (or anyone else's) weight, I initially get pissed because wtf am I supposed to do? Just slink off to wear a mumu until I diet and exercise myself into a more acceptable body? And then I get bummed because I realize, oh no, that's what this person thinks they'd have to do to repent. It's a weird sad world, man."
ABraThatFits,3apxvy,hawkgal23,2,Tue Jun 23 17:21:44 2015 UTC,"My experiences at the Nordstroms around Chicago (mostly old orchard and Schaumburg locations) are that they'll have Elomi in our range. A year or so ago I had some luck with finding Freya and Cleo/Panache but not lately. And the Nordstrom Racks have been disappointing, too (again, old orchard and Schaumburg, plus orland park and downtown). Personally I'd recommend Amazon, especially if you have Prime.   Having said that, I have at least a handful of bras I've bought and worn a few times in the 38G range. If you are interested I can let you know the styles and sizes, and send you some pics."
ABraThatFits,3apxvy,LadyVerene,3,Mon Jun 22 23:53:10 2015 UTC,"My Elomi Hermione (or Amelia, it's basically identical) is the most comfortable bra I own.

There was someone else on this sub shopping there recently and said they didn't have much selection there. I do know there's a Nordstrom Rack about five minutes away from there that does generally have a decent selection of bras.  I'd say contact Tina's Closet (it's in the suburbs, out in...Lisle, I think?) and see if they carry your size range. I'd imagine that they would; I know a lot of people who've shopped there and been very happy with it.

Nordstrom Rack buys are handy because you can return them to your local Nordys- I like when I don't need to mail things back.   Personally, I'd go try a couple brands on at Nordstroms locally if you can to figure out if they fit correctly (I sometimes go down to G in a brand or up to H in others) and then order them online when they are on sale. I have a lot better luck with that on the two sites mentioned. I like Elomi the best.   Also, that sales lady is an a-hole. I've lost 15 lbs and then recently 10 lbs and it's had no effect on my bra size. My Mom used to love saying that crap, too, even though she had 100% no experience with a larger bust or no clue what she was talking about. I hate people sometimes."
ABraThatFits,3arjcb,oooh_snappp,2,Mon Jun 22 22:47:58 2015 UTC,"With your underbust measurements, I think a 30 band would be too tight on you. But it doesn't hurt to try some 30 bands on.   30F is the same volume as 32E, so what's happening here is your slightly different measurements prompted the calculator to put you into a 30 band instead of a 32 band. Likely you're just measuring slightly different than you did previously, which is accounting for the difference in both the band and cup.  There's also a chance your breast size fluctuates throughout the month in accordance with your hormone cycle, which would account for the difference in cup size. Try measuring again in a week or two if you think this might be the case.  The 32DDs could be loose on top due to a shape mismatch. Have you been trying on lots of different shapes and styles?"
ABraThatFits,3arjcb,hurrrrrmione,2,Tue Jun 23 00:34:18 2015 UTC,"I have tried different shapes. I definitely know I'm not shallow. There is just enough difference with my snug underbust that the 32 bands have a tendency to move up throughout the day. I'm not one from altering things, so I'd rather use an extender if I need to."
ABraThatFits,3arjcb,horkus1,2,Tue Jun 23 01:50:23 2015 UTC,"Have you actually worn any 32DDs for any length of time? I started out here at 32DD and now measure 32F and it is due to tissue migration. It only took a few weeks of wearing the (then) right size bra to move things forward and change my measurements. Btw, my band size went down in the ""tight"" range to 30"" but I still need 32"" to be comfortable."
ABraThatFits,3arjcb,horkus1,2,Tue Jun 23 01:49:35 2015 UTC,I've been wearing a 30E Freya that's too shallow. I guess I didn't think about tissue migration. I sure hope that's what this is!

ABraThatFits,3aono9,IAmASquishyBunny,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:59:41 2015 UTC,"Depends a lot on the size range and the cut. Smaller band and cup sizes in Curvy Kate are ridiculously narrow.  Yes, in 32G CK unlined balconys are wider than Lucy but by 0.2-0.3"". At the same time Freya balcony plunges are touted as narrow but most of them are 0.3-0.6"" wider than Lucy in OP's size (Ooh La La is the same width and Totally Tartan is a touch narrower)."
ABraThatFits,3aozha,nidena,4,Mon Jun 22 09:18:07 2015 UTC,"Ahh... The ideal lingerie boutique. I think we all have that dream in mind one way or another. Demographics comes into play. As a boutique owner, I'd love LOVE to have a kazillion bras in stock- but one cannot be ""inventory rich and cash poor"". What I have learned in the three years since being opened is my ideal client is 32-38 band and F-K cup, so I carry the majority of those and build from that based on breast shape. I offer the ""full size spectrum"" but the reality is I'd rather order a bra for a client than it sit in the drawers for months on end-from a business standpoint, that product loses value (and quality, imo)over time. I know it would be lovely. I cried to another boutique owner because I have hundreds of bras in stock, but sometimes can't help a client THAT DAY and she said to me ""honey, I've been in business ten years and you will NEVER have enough bras."" You just have to pay attention to what's working for you and build off of that.  Now, in terms of what I'd like to offer my clients- I'd love to expand my bra inventory and decrease my intimates line (lingerie). While I sell lingerie pretty well, bras make up 75% of my revenue and that wasn't the case when I opened. I've just paid attention to what my clients need and have changed accordingly. I'd like to offer sports bras and swimwear year round, lots of companies that other stores don't carry (ex, Polish brands, which I'm slowly building) offer bra fitting seminars, as well as offer a men's loungewear ""den"", mastectomy services, a dedicated bridal section, shape wear, inserts for correction, bra accessories(straps, racer clips, rixie clips, lingerie soak, body glide) and an alteration shop. I think it's best, however, to build on a strong foundation, start small, ""perfect"" what you have created and build from that, making sure each step you create along the way is fully developed before moving on to the next challenge. I think the problem with a lot of retailers is they start big and offer mediocre services and products, and they don't train their salespeople in a culture that's built on superior service, product quality and brand knowledge."
ABraThatFits,3aozha,SaltyBlackBroad,2,Mon Jun 22 15:47:29 2015 UTC,"It's going to be a minimum of three years before this comes to fruition--and I've been wanting to do it for the past six but my current career has me in its grips until May 2016.  After that, the plan is to finish the Business degree and learn as much as I can about fit.  This page has been a definite help. We have plenty of lingerie stores around here so I don't think I'd incorporate that but I do think that I'd carry sports bras--three high schools, numerous feeder schools, five colleges, and an Air Force base full of folks who might need that extra support. I think your size range is quite similar to the size range that I'd need, here, though.  At least from what I've seen during my tenure at VS."
ABraThatFits,3aozha,xuenylom,3,Mon Jun 22 21:16:17 2015 UTC,"If I was running my own:   Perhaps a way to solve the dilemma of carrying loads of sizes would be solved by the following:  Having a few continuity/classic/best selling bras in all sizes    Freya Deco & Patsy in nude/black Cleo Juna, Marcie & Lucy in nude/black Panache Andorra & Tango 2 Curvy Kate Tease Me Ewa Michalak PL and CHP (a nude and a black one of each cut) Comexim basic Elomi (something that works well in the large band/large cup range best)   and then each season stocking a specific portion of your size range in the current season's offers. So like, spring = 26-30 A-L (or whatever size range), summer 32-36, autumn 38-42, winter 44-48  And stuff that doesn't sell in its season can simply go on sale during the rest of the year?

Most women want a black, nude and occasionally white and those pinks and blues and crazy crazies tend to move much much slower.  On the subject of EM- Do you have any idea how the PL's run compared to the BM? BM has been working great for my clients and I'd like to start pulling some PL's in stock, but since I have little knowledge of the fit, I'm kind of gun shy. TIA!"
ABraThatFits,3aozha,hilbertisoutofspace,2,Mon Jun 22 18:46:16 2015 UTC,"PL has size-specific grading, making it shallower and wider in smaller cup sizes and deeper and narrower in larger cup sizes. The height and width of the cups in the very biggest cup sizes makes it a bit of a disappointment for most people (the only person I've seen who fits it really well is Curvy Wordy), but it could maybe be a narrow, lower coverage option for some ladies in the G-J size range. (Also it's good in the smaller cup sizes but I'm not sure if that shape would be covered by your other stock)  The cups run smaller in the same labelled size as the BM, I'd think most people would find that there's about a 2 cup size difference (e.g. if you take an H cup in a BM you'd most likely want a J cup in the PL)."
ABraThatFits,3aozha,Amalas,2,Mon Jun 22 22:11:10 2015 UTC,"As a result of this sub, I started my own bra shop.  It started out as a sort of pop-up shop, where I would bring my inventory to a local business and use a bit of their space to do fittings and sell bras.  In the beginning, I had maybe 30-50 bras, in a limited number of sizes.  The issue that would always come up: the person would try on the 3 or 4 bras that might work, then we would find out they didn't fit, then I had to scramble to order something.  The whole point of an in-person shop is to be able to buy a bra that day, without having to go through the hassle of ordering.  Once I built up my inventory to many many bras in the same size, I was more likely to be able to get a person to buy a bra that day.  However, that results in needing almost 10x as much inventory than people actually buy.  I know I have bras sitting around that will never sell.  Yes, in theory, there is someone out there who will fit this bra, but I don't know how to get connected with them.  I did have someone complain that I didn't carry a certain size, and it was really hard for me.  It was a fairly unique size - one that no one else has asked for again!  There's no point in having $xx of bra, just sitting around, taking up space, waiting for that one person to buy it.  What I wish I would have done is focus on the customers I was actually getting, and stock bras in the sizes/styles that they liked.  Instead, I went with a ""buy all the sizes"" model, and ended up A) having bras that people didn't want and B) not having bras that people did want.  Keep track of what sizes are most common and buy a bunch in those specific sizes.  For example, I cannot keep enough 36GG bras in stock - they are always the first to go when I do a pop-up shop.  I've got a lot more insight and advice if you are interested.  I've shared a number of things with other people regarding starting a bra business.  Feel free to PM me."

ABraThatFits,3anykm,buymeflowers,3,Mon Jun 22 03:56:50 2015 UTC,"Measurements would be helpful here, though not a necessity.  If you're uncomfortable, then it's not the right bra for you (it could either be too tight, or a shape mismatch, perhaps the bra is too shallow for you and that's why it feels so constricting). If you're measuring in between band sizes, there's really no reason to go for the smaller in your size range, unless you find 30 bands to be sliding around uncomfortably.  30 bands are easier to find than 28s, and you don't really need the support of an extra tight band."

It could be that the looser band in 30D was hiding the fact that you could use a larger volume. While both have the same cup volume 30D is designed for a 34"" bust measurement while 28DD is designed for a 33"" bust measurement."

ABraThatFits,3amdfq,imjustafangirl,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:46:17 2015 UTC,"Haha it's possible, but I definitely found a ton of bra results in the home and garden section. Amazon needs to sort out their categories..."
ABraThatFits,3amdfq,amnes1ac,2,Mon Jun 22 03:22:31 2015 UTC,"I think it's because there was no clothing section on .ca until now, so everyone just listed somewhere and hoped search would work. I was trying to find Birkenstocks and they were everywhere.  Sidenote: :( the markup on some of these bras is insane. I mean I know CAD conversion sucks right now, but I saw one for 150$. ????? That is literally more than I spent on my entire prom outfit. I'm basically just crossing my fingers that .ca continues to expand and in five years or so it'll actually be bearable."

ABraThatFits,3ancjz,UnicornBomber,5,Sun Jun 21 22:29:39 2015 UTC,"Your measurements are very close to mine and I wear around UK42H (US 42K with Goddess and Elila). Your story with the Elomi Rita sounds very close to mine when I bought a very expensive Primadonna bra in UK 42FF. It fit awesome in the store, but within 3 days I could watch it getting too small. So like me you probably need a larger cup. Still, I think that 42JJ is probably an overestimation of your bra size that is based upon your bowed forward bust.   I would encourage you to try the Elomi Rita in UK 42H and work from there."
ABraThatFits,3an1yv,shy477,18,Sun Jun 21 20:56:51 2015 UTC,"I know we have a few guys here that have had this issue. I would wonder if wearing a sports bra with like a surf top or maybe the freya active swim top that looks like a tanktop that might work. Otherwise, I would look twice but actually personally be kinda proud of the guy that was brave enough to do it! I think if it makes you more comfortable then do it!"
ABraThatFits,3an1yv,gliterpoison,11,Sun Jun 21 21:43:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I would just say wear a swim shirt on top, so it doesn't look like a bikini but you can still get the support."
ABraThatFits,3an1yv,xxonemoredayxx,2,Mon Jun 22 00:07:40 2015 UTC,"Well, the top I was talking about from freya doesn't look like a bikini lol It looks like a tank top but that's why i recommended a few different ways they could go about it :)"
ABraThatFits,3an1yv,gliterpoison,7,Mon Jun 22 01:26:25 2015 UTC,"Yep, rash guard is the way to go. I wear one over a bikini since I'm pale as all get out, and they dry super fast (and are comfortable in the water). Wear whatever under it... I personally wouldn't mind if a man wore a bikini, but if I were the man I'd be uncomfortable with the looks it would very likely attract (and it sounds like the OP is in the same boat)."
ABraThatFits,3an1yv,sea-elephant,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:01:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, That's why I recommended a sports bra under so it it holds together but maybe doesn't show much as a shape :)"
ABraThatFits,3an1yv,gliterpoison,7,Mon Jun 22 01:25:34 2015 UTC,"My honest reaction would be:  Glance over, turn away, process what I just saw, take a second look to confirm, say ""Huh... That man is wearing a bikini top. Okie dokie."", and then go about my day. Seriously, if I'm concerned/offended by a guy wearing something I'm not used to while I'm on vacation or relaxing by the pool, I'm not vacationing right. :P  In the end, sweetheart, do what makes you comfortable. Physically and mentally."
ABraThatFits,3an1yv,thisismyusername007,2,Mon Jun 22 02:33:19 2015 UTC,"My reaction too.  I do have four kids that would ask out loud why a man was wearing a bikini top, but would be accepting once I said he wanted too be comfy.  I personally would be most comfortable if I were a man wearing a supportive tank than doesn't look like it actually has cups but supports you."

If it pains you, wear a top.  I will say, I've seen many men with breast tissue that warrants a bra go shirtless at a pool.  Just do what is comfortable."
ABraThatFits,3an1yv,avocator,2,Sun Jun 21 21:22:22 2015 UTC,"I totally get your wife, I think it would make me look twice too.   IMO the best solution to your problem would be the combination of bikini top with a male rashguard.   The bikini top would give you the support you need and the male rashguard over the top would protect you from stares and ridicule and vibe better with your image as manly man."
ABraThatFits,3an1yv,t_maia,2,Mon Jun 22 07:23:00 2015 UTC,"I would probably do a bit of a double take (not something you see ever day), but I wouldn't be bothered at all. You're just having a swim like everyone else, who are we to judge your attire?"
ABraThatFits,3an1yv,goodoldfreda,2,Sun Jun 21 21:27:19 2015 UTC,"If you are uncomfortable and in pain, absolutely wear a sports bra or something that gives you support. To feel more ""socially"" comfortable, you could wear a rash guard on top."
ABraThatFits,3an1yv,CurlyCurler,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:55:56 2015 UTC,"Well to me it would be an unusual thing and therefore most likely awkward. The only men I've SEEN wearing bras are drag queens and people in pride parades, so to randomly see a guy in a bra at a pool would surprise me. Then if you were feeling awkward or insecure about it, you may be putting out vibes that I might misread since I don't know you. In that situation I would most likely feel awkward. However, if there were a guy in a bra, who acts like there is nothing out of the ordinary and his partner is likewise non plussed and they mind their own business I'd most likely be like ""oh okay, whatever.""   If a guy with large breasts was swimming without a shirt on I don't think I'd think twice about it. I've swam in many a public pool with many people of assorted body types so nothing of that nature shocks me anymore. I do still get wide-eyed at the occasional speedo and hairy butt combo though.   I agree with everyone else saying that you should do whatever you need/want to do, ultimately people's opinions don't matter.   Also, I know many men who only swim with shirts (or tanks or rash guards) on, so if you decided to go that route I don't think anyone would find that out of the ordinary."
ABraThatFits,3an1yv,CraigsWife,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:06:38 2015 UTC,"I personally would not be bothered. Some sort of swim top would probably be helpful to you for doing fun activities at the beach or pool. Like if you were going to play beach volleyball I imagine you'd want support while you're jumping around!   If your wife isn't really thrilled with the idea of you walking around in a bikini, perhaps an underwired tankini top would be a good compromise? Another of our posters who has gynecomastia recently asked for tankini recommendations that weren't as feminine in apearance, and I thought the Panache Sport Top would work. However, that doesn't come in 36B."
ABraThatFits,3an1yv,crazymusicalgenius96,10,Sun Jun 21 21:09:23 2015 UTC,"I've got pretty dam big man boobs and honestly I have no idea what you are talking about in terms of support.    Then you are lucky and your moobs are mostly fat tissue and not glandular tissue. Glandular tissue is far more sensitive to pressure, pull and movement. Jogging and jumping unsupported actually hurts, no matter how large your breasts are.    Bras aren't even for support for 95% of the female population.   Sorry, but you are talking out of your arse here. You don't have glandular tissue so you have not experienced the full benefits of wearing a correctly fitted bra (ie being pain-free), but bras are not just fashion items.     what little research that has been done shows they cause more sag than prevent.   That French study has been analysed and debunked. Please do your reading.    Further to this, bikini tops are NOT built for support. They are designed to cover the nipples, again it's a modesty/fashion thing.   Depends whether you are talking cheap Walmart/Target tie-back string bikini tops or bra-sized swimwear with underwires in the correct brasize. World of difference."
ABraThatFits,3an1yv,t_maia,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:31:28 2015 UTC,"Totally agree, though I had a mammogram about a month ago that showed no sign of glandular tissue, just fat. The pain I experience sans support is on the bottom and sides of my moobs, which is from the tugging action of gravity on my flesh.   I don't wear a bra to shape my breasts, and I certainly don't wear one for the aesthetic factor. The primary reason is support. If it happens to do the other things, so be it. I actually prefer not to announce that I have boobs or that I'm wearing a bra, but if those are a side effect then I just roll with it."
ABraThatFits,3an1yv,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:16:57 2015 UTC,"I actually prefer not to announce that I have boobs or that I'm wearing a bra, but if those are a side effect then I just roll with it.    So, in answer to your original question, if I saw a man in a bikini top I'd likely be a bit taken aback, but not bothered really. I support your need to be supported.  With that said, if you'd prefer to be discreet about your chest, I think a plain compression sports bra with a tank, rash guard, tee or whatever other kind of shirt is popular at the beach for men is what I'd suggest. As a slightly overweight 36B by your own description, I'd guess you're pretty well-represented in the male population at large. A lot of those guys just don't feel a need to support their tissue and they're not bothered by going shirtless, or if they are, they wear a shirt. Since you do feel physically uncomfortable without the support of a bra, but you aren't large-breasted, a low to mid-level compression bra should do the trick."

ABraThatFits,3an1yv,sunny_bell,0,Mon Jun 22 19:35:16 2015 UTC,"I personally wouldn't care (I've seen waaaay stranger things). If you are concerned about stares you could wear a rash guard over it, that wouldn't draw much attention."
ABraThatFits,3ao8is,reallysaucy,3,Mon Jun 22 03:31:45 2015 UTC,"You're a little bit smaller than me, but I'm also pendulous and I believe fairly even for the most part. I have pretty soft tissue from breastfeeding for 2 years and then weaning abruptly. They've always been semi-soft, but now it's like feeling up one of those squishy tube things.  I also hate pointy boobs and am really picky about needing a rounded shape, as well as bras that won't be obvious under a tshirt.   SO all that being said, I finally got a box of bras in from amazon today and I actually ended up keeping like 4 out of 9 of them. These statistics are like unheard of for me. I kept the Freya Idol, which I am thinking about doing a review on just because it's really new and I couldn't find much info on it myself; was kind of a leap of faith ordering it. The Freya Deco doesn't work on me AT ALL but this thing is like amazing. Really rounded shape, not pointy at all, and somewhat minimized (at least in a 32FF). Soft spacer fabric and not nearly as rigid/moulded as the Deco. Obviously not nearly as much cleavage but still a decent amount. Take note that it is pretty big in the cup (the only real review I could find on it said this). I ordered my normal cup size and a cup size smaller, tried the smaller one on first, and didn't even bother with my normal cup size which was laughably huge. The band size also isn't as loose as with other Freyas, so I would stick with your normal band size.  I also kept the Cleo Maddie which looks really great under a tshirt, but it doesn't give me a minimized shape at all. Probably makes my boobs look the biggest out of all the ones I kept. Nice and round, not torpedoey. Does give a decent amount of cleavage. I went through a lot of trial and error with this because the teal spot in a 32G is way bigger than the nude in a 32G and it confused the hell out of me. Idk if it's just that colorway or what.  The Curvy Kate Arizona ended up being AMAZING. I really am not that big a fan of the design, I just ordered it because I was nabbing everything that was padded that looked like it might work. Absolutely love the shape, and it's not SO padded that I feel like it's adding bulk. Also really comfy. Ordered a cup size up from my normal and it fits great.  The Freya Marvel doesn't technically fit me 100% like it's supposed to, but it's not uncomfortable or anything major so I kept it because the way it makes me look is worth it to me. Another fairly minimizing bra, round shape, and lightly lined so my nipples don't show. This is looser in the band so I went a band size down and a cup size up.  I hope some of that was helpful! If your tissue does get softer when you start to breastfeed left, these should hopefully still work for you."
ABraThatFits,3ao8is,TheDodgyStalker,2,Mon Jun 22 05:18:41 2015 UTC,LOL  I definitely know what you mean by breasts feeling like those squishy tubes! I'm still trying to get to terms with my breasts after breastfeeding 4 kiddos!   Thanks so much for the suggestions. I am adding things to my Amazon cart to try out and hopefully I fall in love with a couple until I change sizes again after weaning.  ;)
ABraThatFits,3ao8is,buymeflowers,3,Mon Jun 22 15:39:30 2015 UTC,"Starlet -- ""training"" a molded bra to be a different shape is news to me, I would not bet on this being particularly easy (or possible) to do. Freya Deco is what I would try next, its a molded bra that has a bit more closed off edge (it's a plunge).  Elan may have been too shallow for you, maybe it looked minimizing and that's why you didn't care for the shape? Envy is usually pretty rounded though, was the top lace a bit loose? I'd say give Cleo Lucy/Kali a shot.  EDIT: originally I read your post as having tried Panache Eclipse (because I apparently can't read xD) and so the info about the Tango is not relevant."
ABraThatFits,3an6yu,cinderflight,11,Sun Jun 21 21:41:08 2015 UTC,"Many women like Panache's sports bra. I didn't see a previous post on here by you; if you wouldn't mind posting your five measurements, we can help you out quite a bit more."
ABraThatFits,3an6yu,soleoblues,4,Sun Jun 21 21:58:25 2015 UTC,I see. I recently made my measurements and will be soon posting a measurement check. My measurements were as follows:   31 30 38 39 37
ABraThatFits,3an6yu,clegh20,6,Sun Jun 21 22:02:59 2015 UTC,"According to those numbers, it looks like you may benefit from a tighter band and a larger cup. Either a 30FF or a 32F would give you more support (please double check me, it's been a long week)"
ABraThatFits,3an6yu,hurrrrrmione,12,Sun Jun 21 22:26:36 2015 UTC,Calculator suggests 32FF. I think a 30 band would be too tight since it's her tight measurement and she only has 1 in difference between her snug and tight.
ABraThatFits,3an6yu,Kaywin,3,Sun Jun 21 22:32:04 2015 UTC,"You're most definitely not a 34, which might be part of your issue. :)"
ABraThatFits,3an6yu,soleoblues,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:46:11 2015 UTC,Would I be a 32 or 30?
ABraThatFits,3an6yu,Kaywin,3,Mon Jun 22 13:09:02 2015 UTC,"I'd go with a 32, save for really stretchy bands. I wouldn't buy too many in your new size, as there's a decent chance it'll change pretty soon. Tissue migration caused by swooping and scooping (breast tissue moving back into the breast) is a real thing. I highly recommend re-measuring a month or six weeks after you start wearing your new bra."
ABraThatFits,3an6yu,stinkylittleone,2,Mon Jun 22 15:21:04 2015 UTC,"Really it depends on your comfort, and also the brand. Certain brands have stretchier bands than others. Try both and see which you prefer. And keep in mind that preference may change over time. :)"
ABraThatFits,3an6yu,larissala,2,Mon Jun 22 22:47:19 2015 UTC,"Panache is great for overall style+effectiveness, Freya Active is truly no bounce but a but matronly. The others recommended in this thread won't come above a DD, unfortunately."
ABraThatFits,3an6yu,nidena,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:40:25 2015 UTC,"lululemon makes a bra called the TaTa-Tamer. Absolutely fantastic. Convertible straps and removable pads. Underwire and high support/coverage. Sizing is according to actual bra size(34D, 32D, etc.)"
ABraThatFits,3am3sc,BrahaMoment,3,Sun Jun 21 15:52:46 2015 UTC,"The measurements you posted actually point to 30E being a good starting place, so I think the spillage you've been having in your 30DDs may be due to size issues as well as shape issues.   Some wire distortion is normal, though the amount you get is dependent on the brand. For example, Polish brands tend to have a lot less wire distortion because of the way the bras are constructed. My Freyas distort quite a bit; the one Masquerade bra I have distorts significantly less. And Bratabase measurements are all taken when the bra isn't being worn, so looking for that 5 inch cup width wasn't too much of a mis-step! If you look for bras that match your distorted wire width on Bratabase, they'll end up distorting even more once you put them on and they'll be too wide.  If you've got PE, a tacking gore is not strictly necessary unless you find it more comfortable that way. If the gore lines up with where your sternum would be without PE, that's good. If it's not lining up with your imaginary sternum then it wouldn't tack on you no matter what kind of sternum you have.   If you can find Freya Instinct again in 30E, I think that would work better for you than the one you have in 30DD."
ABraThatFits,3am3sc,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:25:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Sometimes it just takes an objective observer to point out the obvious, especially in the middle of a meltdown!   The non-tacking gores that I was attributing to PE are actually symptoms of a too small cup. Armpit spillage and escaping s&s also point to the same thing, I just couldn't see it for myself.  I will try a 30E in another Patsy clone, probably the Rapture since the white and black are closer to practical basics than the other prints."
ABraThatFits,3an9z7,cinderflight,6,Sun Jun 21 22:06:47 2015 UTC,"Oh, you mean 32FF! UK sizing is much more accurate and standardized than US sizing. I'm from the U.S. and use UK sizing. I'm a 28F in UK sizing. This size explains the quadboobing going on. The band is a size too large and a few cups too small."
ABraThatFits,3an9z7,strictlyboobulated,4,Sun Jun 21 22:13:33 2015 UTC,"Also, most US brands don't go up to a UK FF cup so you'll want to be mostly looking at UK brands, /u/cinderflight.

ABraThatFits,3an9z7,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:36:43 2015 UTC,"Natori would be a good brand to check out, then. You would be a 32H in their sizing, which is the largest cup size they carry.   I recommend going to Nordstrom if there's one near you. They should have lots of options in your size range, including sports bras. You can also search their website by bra size and availability at stores near you if you're worried they won't have a good selection."
ABraThatFits,3an9z7,SmellsLikeDogBuns,5,Sun Jun 21 22:55:37 2015 UTC,"Like strictlyboobulated said, I would stick to your UK size for the most part as you'll have many more options that way. A 32F/FF in UK brands sounds like a good place to start, and you can adjust from there.  I would suggest taking a look through the shape guide if you haven't already, which is very important in finding a bra that fits well."
ABraThatFits,3anl92,ElRxBandita,9,Sun Jun 21 23:50:40 2015 UTC,"Think you've got a typo in your lying bust that's throwing off the calculator.   Judging by your other numbers, you're best fit is gonna be somewhere in the 32E-FF range."
ABraThatFits,3anl92,wayward_sun,6,Mon Jun 22 00:00:43 2015 UTC,Is that 25 supposed to be a 35? I think the calculator average the 25 and 41 and used the 33 to get a 32B. Otherwise 32B makes no sense.   I'm going to use 38 bust and 32 underbust which will give you an approximate size of 32E. You may want to try 34DD if 32 is too tight though.
ABraThatFits,3anl92,plutonium743,2,Mon Jun 22 00:00:10 2015 UTC,"With your edited measurements, the calculator puts you halfway between 32DD and 32E (which is 32DDD in US sizing).   However, 32DD is the same volume as a 34D and is designed for someone with a bust measurement of 37"", which is 4 inches smaller than your leaning measurement. So 32DD is definitely too small for  you.  I agree with /u/wayward_sun that you're most likely in the 32E to 32FF range. Start with 32E and 32F (check the bra tags for the UK size, as different US brands will label this size differently).   Have you taken a look at the shape guide? What shape do you think your breasts are?"

Check out the offline retailer list for stores in your area. If you're near a Nordstrom, they carry Cleo Kali with their Panache bras (Cleo is a subbrand of Panache). You can also search Nordstrom's website by bra size (make sure you're looking at the UK size when you search) and availability at stores near you to make sure they have a good selection in the sizes you wanna try on before you head in."

ABraThatFits,3ao5rc,braaccount,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:49:02 2015 UTC,"I hadn't noticed the cups folding, but I see that contour in the cups and I only wore it one full day and one three hour chunk!  OK, so that one goes back.  My measurements were 1.36 2.33 3.41 4.50 5.32  Those in the calculator gave me 34E (sister 36DD or 32F), but that cup size turned out to be too small.  The band feels OK when I first put it on, the pressure on the ribs comes pretty quickly though and then gets uncomfortable after a half hour.  Thanks for any help!"

It's rare to see a 9"" difference between standing and leaning (slightly smaller differences, up to about 6"", are more common), and it doesn't make sense for the lying bust to be smaller than the underbust..."
ABraThatFits,3ao5rc,braaccount,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:58:58 2015 UTC,"We used a tape measure and followed the diagrams from this site's ""properly fitting a bra"" section that the instructor printed.  I attended a class where the instructor used this info to educate us and printed out the visual guides.  (When I lie on my back, my breasts go to the side a lot.)  One question though on measurement 5 if that's an usual measurement.  The instructor who directed me to this forum for further help said that measurement 5 was from one side of the floor to the other (not going behind the back).  Perhaps I misunderstood though.  If that's incorrect, that measurement would be 14 inches larger.  I'll double check that in the written guide to make sure about that and the other measurements.   So, the band size feels properly snug when I put them on, but it may be too tight and thus causing the feel of rib pressure?  I don't have the red lines on my back and sides when I take them off, just in front along the ribs.  The Panache was tighter and felt better with a small extender (sorry, I should have mentioned that, I apologize)! The Fantasie felt just snug at 34 and, for both, I was thrilled to get the cup size right so that when I put them on everything felt like a win.  Hmmm, so next actions... I'll double check the measurement guide and make sure I got those measurements done correctly.  I'm thrilled with Amazon's return policies and glad to keep trying based on the guidance I get here.  Is there another brand that would be less likely to give this rib pressure or what should I try next that is most likely to work?"
ABraThatFits,3ao5rc,t_maia,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:46:24 2015 UTC,"My husband helped me before.  I remeasured myself and got: 1. 37.5 2. 34.5 3. 42 4. 50 5. 34.5 or 47   (I'm still not completely sure if I should include my back.)  Putting this in the calculator (assuming measure 5 should be 47), I get 36G/GG and sister sizes (38FF/G, 34GG/H).  So... give those a go on Amazon? Particular brand that is particularly supportive when measure 4 is so large?"
ABraThatFits,3ao5rc,t_maia,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:00:21 2015 UTC,"All the measurements should go behind the back. Was this the visual guide you saw? I'm afraid it might have been misinterpreted by the instructor, then, and I can see sort of see why that could have happened, since the picture of Measurement 5 doesn't show the tape measure going around the back.   So with those measurements, not only was the band too tight (although Fantasie runs looser), but the cups were too small, which can make the band feel even tighter and cause the kind of painful pressure you were talking about. One way to assess a bra band on its own is to put the bra on upside down and backwards, like this, and see if it's still too tight or not.  Ordering 36G/GG and 38FF/G sounds reasonable. I wouldn't go for 34GG/H if your super-tight underbust is over 34. This will take some time, but I'd really recommend looking through the shape guide to narrow down your selections."
ABraThatFits,3amqkm,carriondawns,5,Sun Jun 21 19:16:22 2015 UTC,"If you're already wearing a 38 you should stay in that, so a 38FF/G    I don't necessarily agree with this, considering that your 38DD's are ill-fitted. I'm sure lots of the squishing you have is due to the cups being too small, but in some bras a 40 band might be better. You may be able to tell by trying one of your bras on backwards to see if the band is comfortable or too tight, but because your bras are probably quite stretched out, that may not be an accurate representation. If/when you order new bras in 38 band, try them on backwards with the band under your bust and cups upside down on your back, to determine if the 38 band is comfortable in itself.  All that said, there are many more options if you are comfortable in a 38 band, and some of the best options in your size range, Elomi and Goddess, are probably going to be okay in a 38 once you have the right cup size. What bras have you planned to order?"
ABraThatFits,3amqkm,Goddess_Keira,2,Sun Jun 21 19:58:05 2015 UTC,"So far I have in my amazon cart an Elomi Amelia and an Elomi Betty. Yeah, my bras are pretty well worn at this point so they wouldn't be any good for correct measuring. I've read on posts here and on the guides that they're supposed to be tight,  but how tight is TOO tight?  Edit : correction, not caitlyn, Amelia"
ABraThatFits,3amqkm,Goddess_Keira,3,Sun Jun 21 20:03:27 2015 UTC,"When it comes to bands, a lot of women in the larger band/larger bust sizes, at least those who frequent the sub, seem to prefer a very tight band. I used to be a 38GG, so very close to you in size, but have lost quite a bit of weight, making me a 32GG.  Anyway, if the bra feels uncomfortably snug, something is too tight or otherwise misfit--it could be the band, or the cups, or both, and it could be how the bra is sitting on your body. If you try on a new bra and you have to strain excessively to fasten it, that's too tight. If the fasteners pull from the back view, like there's too much strain on them, that's too tight. The wires should not be distorted at the sides, but it can take an experienced eye to see that. If it looks like the bra is squeezing the life out of you, that's too tight, lol.   In a correct fit, the cups should contain all breast tissue after scooping and swooping (but you don't need to go crazy trying to s&s every inch of skin on your torso into your cups, if that makes sense :) ), and there should be no quad boob, the band should sit level around your back and not move up if you raise your arms, but it should be a comfortable degree of snugness. You'll probably see some of that dreaded back fat, but again, IMO, the bra shouldn't be creating bulging flesh nor dig in painfully. If you wish, you can always post a fit check. Pictures are optional, but can be very helpful.  Elomi Caitlyn and Betty are good choices to start with. If you can, I'd get Betty in 38FF and 38G, and Caitlyn in 38FF and 40F, to have some variety to try. I'm doing a little guesstimation here, but something in that range should give you (and us, if you choose to share) a good idea."

Most stores, even lingerie boutiques, don't carry 28 bands, so the fitter may have put you in a 30 band because that was the smallest band available at the store. Many stores also don't carry cups over D in 30 bands (if they even carry 30 bands), so she may have put you in a 30DD because that was the largest cup the store had in a 30 band.   If you're willing to order online, there are plenty of lined, soft cup, and molded cup bras available in 28F on the Internet. Otherwise, you might be able to find the sister size of 30DDD in some stores.  Have you checked out the shape guide?"
ABraThatFits,3al444,hurrrrrmione,3,Sun Jun 21 08:02:50 2015 UTC,"I think 30E is likely the sweet spot. Your underbust measurements are so close together that I think sister sizing up in band is what you'll want to do most of the time unless the bra band is very stretchy.  And you really should check out the shape guide, size is only half of the battle. Your projection level, fullness and root width are very helpful in recommending bras."

ABraThatFits,3ajyln,DreamOutLoud23,5,Sat Jun 20 22:58:33 2015 UTC,"Agree with the calculator's sizing suggestion.   However I do not want to rule out UK 30H as a possibility, that is one cupsize up from 30GG. This is because many women who wear DDD cups end up in the H+ range when they finally find their correct size while women who end up in G/GG cups were usually in the D or DD range. So that you wear 34DDD (as opposed to 34D or 34DD) indicates that you probably need larger cups. Your shape description (full all over) also indicates larger cups.   So maybe focus a bit on ordering 30GG bras even if the selection in 30G is larger, cheaper and cuter. (Stupid G/GG barrier!)  Good beginner bras with your shape description are Cleo Marcie, Cleo Lily, Panache Andorra, Panache Jasmine, Panache Envy."

Also check out the websites of big manufacturers and other online shops to see which brands make swimwear in your size. Known brands are Panache, Cleo, Freya, Fantasie, Lepel, PourMoi?, Curvy Kate, ...  That said the Freya Sweetheart cut is a pretty universal good fit. Freya sells it and the Figleaves house brand Midnight Grace has cheaper knock-offs.   Example:  http://www.amazon.com/Freya-Tootsie-Sweetheart-Padded-Bikini/dp/B00LVB932S/  But since you want a halter, the Freya banded halter style (aka Pier-style) would be better.   http://www.amazon.com/Freya-Cherish-Banded-Halter-Bikini/dp/B00GTQ6YKE/  Freya re-uses its cuts over and over again, a Freya bikini top is usually labelled Freya (name of fabric) (name of cut).

ABraThatFits,3aj4o7,atheologist,18,Sat Jun 20 18:19:40 2015 UTC,"From the reading I've done pendulous is the polite word meaning they're heavy and not-perky, whereas projected actually describes a characteristic that relates to finding an appropriate bra. I presume that in a smaller cup size you can be projected but not especially pendulous. I am both projected and pendulous because I have large breasts that, when I cup them in my hands, extend out pretty far(they look like fat boards coming out of my chest lol!), but when they are not cupped, they are definitely lower than my IMF, though due to my age I'm sure they're a lot perkier than they could be. I would think that the more projected you are, the more pendulous you are, so if you're medium projection, then it makes sense that you wouldn't be as pendulous as, say, me, with my extreme immediate projection."

You can be projected but not pendulous.   I believe that projected is all about your root base. Projected has a propensity to be narrow rooted, whereas shallow tends to be wide rooted (outliers do exist). Same volume of tissue as shallow, just on different bases.   I myself am projected & pendulous, with softer tissue. I am narrowish in root and short rootedish so my boobs just jut out from my ribcage, and they just sort of head in a downwardly direction as I don't have enough root to be self supporting, and my tissue has definitely softened over the years.  I've always had tissue overhanging my IMF that my nipple was been wandering towards as I've aged. Now that I'm 35, my nipple is under my IMF, so I am definitely pendulous. I hope that made sense."

I think starting with how wide set your breasts are isn't particularly helpful, it can be later on, but probably not early on.  Just two things from looking at the first section of ""classify your breasts"".  And overall the language is grim, it really can be very judgemental.  There is plenty of info on here that is better and no judgemental language.  Sure, if some women find it on the internet it's more helpful than VS, but that's not saying much.  Edited to add - I HAD to come back and quote this, from the next page:  ""All bra styles on the market fit a woman with full upper breasts.""  Yeah, funny.  And the WHOLE section on upper breast fullness is completely off beam, it states that although some women start off with little upper breast fullness, most have plenty and it's mainly lost over time.

I think the idea is that pendulous breasts can be (and almost always are) projected, while projected breasts could be say self-supporting. You can imagine cases of pendulous breasts, however, where the tissue is very soft so it kind of moves like a liquid through the skin, making the breasts less projected than if you just laid them out on your hands straight off your chest."

If it is consistent over several bras it is either your natural breastshape at play or a severe shape and sizing mismatch. Somebody who needs very wide and very shallow bras in a 34G but tries bras with medium projection in 34F will get pointy breasts from a combination of too narrow wires and too deep cup.   From the fit of the wires of the Curvy Kate I am wondering whether it is the latter, they seem quite narrow. Please try the Parfait Charlotte in several sizes.    Additionally most D+ bra brands aim for a shape that is pointy-round because pointy-round is a more natural breastshape. If women with large breasts wear bras that form a completely round basketball shape the breasts will look even larger in a shirt plus the artificial round shape has cultural connotations of ""pornstar"", which many women with large breasts want to avoid.   I personally don't see anything wrong with the shape you get in the Curvy Kate - it is the typical pointy-round shape of D+ bras. The not so good fit makes it a bit worse than it could be so I can understand if you don't like it, but it is not unwearable."

I also think the lace on the top isn't too horrible if I don't slouch. I feel the areas without lace, where the lace is and I'm not standing straight is when I get the wrinkles, but it's fixed if I pinch the lace in near either edge.  I've tried bras with narrow wires before and the tend to poke me no matter what. That was the case with both the Cleo bras and the FREYA (I always mix it up with Panache for some reason). At least that's what I've been told? I've been recommended wider wires, and these did feel better. I don't get bruises wear the edges of the wire sit from this bra.

You got quite a bit of tissue under your arm, tissue that seems to be cut off by the wire from going into the cup.  Width is how far the wire goes in the direction of you back. Height is how far the wire goes in the direction of your shoulder.   Wire height is less of an issue.

Size-wise I think you are closer to a 36 band, especially in brands that have firm bands. If you find a 36 band too loose, you can wear 34 bands with a non-stretchy extender. If you order off amazon, I recommend you get some non-stretchy extenders as add-on items.   Your lying on your back measurement points to UK 36G (US 36i in Goddess and Elila), your bowed forward measurement to a slightly larger cup (1-2 cupsizes larger).   I would recommend you try UK 36G and maybe 36GG and then work from there."

ABraThatFits,3ajaal,MsOuellet,15,Sat Jun 20 19:09:30 2015 UTC,"Your measurements definitely point more to a 34 band than a 32, especially in brands that are firm, like Panache. I would try the Jasmine again in 34G. Also, it looks like the underwires are too low. The too-tight band might be distorting them and making the cup too shallow. When you get your new bra, try to pull the wires up so that they sit right in your inframammary fold (where the bottom your breasts meet your ribcage), as you will get more support that way."

ABraThatFits,3ajaal,Journey66,11,Tue Jun 23 02:22:20 2015 UTC,"In your 2nd pic you can see that the wires are not in your inframammary fold (IMF), the bra should be higher up.  If you adjust the bra so the wires follow the shape of your breasts as closely as possible, how does that change the fit of the bra?"

ABraThatFits,3ajaal,HootyMyBoobs,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:19:25 2015 UTC,"Based on your measurements I'm assuming the band is still tighter than comfortable, so a 34FF would be a good size to try next."
ABraThatFits,3ajaal,t_maia,7,Tue Jun 23 17:47:57 2015 UTC,"If the cup is good (pics are not loading on mobile for me at the moment), then you want to try 34G instead of going up a cupsize with 34GG. Sister sizing rules are ""Down in the band, up in the cup. Up in the band, down in the cup."" And based on your measurements, 34 is a good band for you."
ABraThatFits,3ajaal,t_maia,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:35:02 2015 UTC,"I didn't know that, thanks!"
ABraThatFits,3ajzu6,IchBinStark,7,Sat Jun 20 23:11:24 2015 UTC,"26F does sound about correct from your measurements, though bear in mind this is just a starting place. Considering a 32E is only just wide enough for you, a 26FF may also work (one cup size smaller). You're right - 26s are difficult to find. You have some options here:  \1. Buy 28E/Fs and deal with it. (This is the easiest one). There is a fair to pretty good chance you'll find them more comfortable than 26s anyway, and there is much more selection. From your description you sound like you have wide roots and have a relatively shallow bust, I'd suggest checking out the shallow guide for some recs.  1 1/2: Buy 28s and alter them (this is what I do lots of the time). There are many different alteration tutorials on the sidebar which require next to no skill. You could alternatively look into buying a Rixie Clip if you're worried about sewing, though they have mixed reviews.  \2. Polish bras! These probably won't suit you due to your description of your breast tissue (Polish bras are generally narrow and projected), but they may be worth a try if you decide you are narrow and projected. Braologie's bras are apparently wider, though their website is a bit dodgy and I don't really know what's going on with the shop.  \3. Luxury bras! Two companies come to mind - Edwards and Millers and Bosom Galore. These both sell 26s, and some of them are pretty wide. Super expensive, though!"
ABraThatFits,3ajzu6,goodoldfreda,2,Sat Jun 20 23:33:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you! From looking reading up on shapes, I think I'm average (shallow/projected) with wide roots. I will try looking for 28s online."
ABraThatFits,3ajzu6,wambrita,6,Sun Jun 21 00:02:21 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind since you are tiny and petite, what looks wide on you, is actually narrow. In order for your breasts to be wide rooted and need bras to accommodate, your breast roots need to end somewhere behind your armpits.  I'm your height and once upon a time, I was your weight. I had that same confusion and spent a good 8 months trying to get wide bras to work. It didn't.  EDIT: I'm actually an inch shorter. But yeah."
ABraThatFits,3ajzu6,dezeiram,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:20:30 2015 UTC,"Yesss this. I'm 5'2"", about ~110 lbs. my roots look insanely wide on my body but all the bras that are described as ""narrow"" are what fit best (Cleo Melissa and Lily, for example)."
ABraThatFits,3ajzu6,Shanakitty,1 point,Sun Jun 21 08:25:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that suggestion, I haven't thought of that before - I'll definitely check out some narrow options too. I checked where the root ends, and it's confusing now. If I stand up with my arms straight down my sides, the left root ends at the back of my arm and the right root ends at the front of my arm. I've always had the problem of the underwire ending too far forward and digging on the left side."
ABraThatFits,3ajzu6,BosomGalore,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:14:54 2015 UTC,"With 28 bands, I suggest you try Cleo by Panache's unlined bras, as they tend to run snug in the bands. I doubt Freya's 28s will work for you, as they are quite stretchy. You could also check out Bratabase,  put in your size, and look for bras that have relatively wide wires and small bands compared to others."
ABraThatFits,3ajzu6,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:37:41 2015 UTC,I'll look into that brand. I've seen Freya bras at Nordstrom before and they do seem larger (both band and cup) to me than the bands I'm used to.

ABraThatFits,3aj9ky,Fillicia,20,Sat Jun 20 19:03:30 2015 UTC,"The cup size can make the band feel too tight if the cup is too small. To see if the band itself fits, try the bra on backwards. The band should only have a couple fingers extra space to fit snugly. If the band fits, then you should definitely try a 32F."
ABraThatFits,3aj9ky,Champion_of_Charms,9,Sat Jun 20 19:36:02 2015 UTC,Your measurements do solidly point at 32F. As pointed out you should test band fit independently of cup fit.  Which bra(s) did you try? Did you scoop and swoop? Did the underwires encompass all of your breast tissue on the sides?
ABraThatFits,3ajxp0,blw_abtf,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:49:10 2015 UTC,"But the other bra, a 42 C (also from Kmart) is too big.    I disagree. It only looks too large, but it is not. The too wide band does not pull the bra close enough to your body. Your breasts push the bra away and so the cup gapes.   Using traditional sizing methods I get a size of around 48 (A/)B/C with your measurements. Now we both agree that a 48 band would be way too large. But sistersizing that 48B to a 42 band I get 46C - 44D - 42DD - 40E (40DDD).   So you'll probably find a good fit somewhere around UK 40DD/E/F and UK 42 D/DD/E.   That is US 40DD/DDD/?(G or F) and US 42 D/DD/DDD.   Don't be afraid to try the larger sizes, you might surprise yourself. Seems like you got lots of tissue under your arms that could do with a shove forward into the cup. You cannot do that properly in the 42C bra because the band is too wide and the wires too narrow.   Regarding styles, please read up on shallow shapes.   Sadly many of the recommended bras for shallow shapes do not come in the sizes you need so the recommendations are a bit useless. But reading the articles will allow you to recognise shallow-friendly bras when you see them.    Additionally LaneBryant and Victoria's Secrets might be worth trying. I know both have shallow-friendly bras. VS only carries their 40 bands online and in the stores in very large cities, but it is worth a shot."

We normally use UK sizing here because it is more consistent.   If you need a UK 32GG / US 32J there are some decent options available.   Freya, Panache, Figleaves Active and Zoggs all make sports swimwear in this size range.   The Panache Sports Swimsuit is probably your best bet.   http://www.panache-lingerie.com/us/products/details/panache-sport/sports-swimsuit/swimsuit/a  Freya only has a purple suit this season and Figleaves Active is only available in 34G, which would be a bit to large in the band and in the body.   http://www.figleaves.com/uk/product/FIG-137500/figleaves-active-Aqua-Underwired-BGG-Active-Shaping-Swimsuit/   Cup-sized Zoggs seems to be excluse to Bravissimo.   http://www.bravissimo.com/products/swimwear/swimsuits/newport-sports-swimsuit/black-print/zs106blt/  But if you need a UK 32J I would combine a regular sports bra with a speedo suit."

ABraThatFits,3ako3l,t_maia,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:00:43 2015 UTC,"A 32J from Change is roughly equal to a 32GG, give or take a bit.

A good sportsbra would be the Panache Sport.   http://www.butterflycollection.ca/panache-sports-bra-black-5021/  If the Panache Sports sportsbra fits, chances are high the Panache swimsuit I recommended will fit in the same size because it is based upon that sportsbra.   I don't know where you can buy the Panache Sports Swimsuit in Canada, but I know that many of your fellow canucks order bras and swimwear from UK onlineshops. Especially ebay.co.uk for the cheaper prices. Figleaves also seems to be popular.

I use Woolite, a laundry detergent for delicate items, or the dollar store version of the same thing. It also has instructions for hand washing. When the wash is done, I pull out all the bras and anything else that shouldn't go into the dryer (It is all easy to find because the bra bags and lingerie bags stand out) and I hang them up in the shower. The separate bags prevents bra hooks from catching on lace and ensures that straps don't get tangled together or stretched out.  Tide Bra Bag"

ABraThatFits,3aidxt,lelechan,6,Sat Jun 20 14:01:31 2015 UTC,"As others have said, your bust measurements should be taken pretty loosely, without the tape compressing any breast tissue. Your measurements suggest a 42GG (10"" difference), but because bands tend to run stretchy in this range, and you have 4"" of squish, I agree with /u/noys that you'd probably find a 40H(UK) more supportive. If you want, you could also try some bras in 38HH with a non-stretchy extender, since that would open up some more possibilities in brands that stop at a 38 band.  Elomi is a pretty popular UK brand in this size range, as well as Goddess, which is a US brand. Your US size would be 40K. Panache (a UK brand) also has a new Sculptresse line that makes bras in this size range."

But it would be useful to know what you're wearing now and how they fit other than the wires poking. You might be more comfortable in a 34 band even though you measure for a 32, but reading that you find even a 34G/GG to be too snug suggests that something might be off about the fit or shape of the bra(s)."
ABraThatFits,3aiwna,Goddess_Keira,2,Sat Jun 20 17:41:44 2015 UTC,"Panache Loretta in the 34GG, that one's particularly snug. The 34G is a Panache Emily, which is better. I guess thinking about it, I could see that going down to a 32."
ABraThatFits,3aiwna,GaarDnous,3,Sat Jun 20 17:55:47 2015 UTC,Loretta actually runs especially tight! My snug/tight measurements are 32 and 30.25 inches and I can't even hook the Loretta balconette in a 32 band.
ABraThatFits,3aitzx,poppopintheattic,3,Sat Jun 20 16:42:21 2015 UTC,Luckily for you 34DD can be easily found in many stores (it's also not that far from your 36C estimation). Go into shops and try as many as you can find. Do scoop and swoop and also have a look at the shape guide.
ABraThatFits,3aitzx,j_sunrise,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:05:03 2015 UTC,"Will do, thanks!"
ABraThatFits,3aitzx,Shanakitty,3,Sat Jun 20 19:02:04 2015 UTC,"34DD does look like a good place to start. While the media suggests that DD=huge, it really just means a 5"" difference between bust and underbust, which is fairly modest. Here are some women in 34D/DD/E bras (it does go past that, because they don't have very many images in 34DD, so I wanted to include nearby sizes). Do they look about like you?   34DD is comfortably within the bra matrix, so you should have a lot of options in this size. Check out the shape-guide in the side-bar on the right, and we can give you some more specific suggestions. Shape is just as important as size for getting a good fit."
ABraThatFits,3aitzx,Shanakitty,2,Sat Jun 20 18:11:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the link! The polka dots one looks more like my bust than the turquoise one, but both are reasonably close.   I'm on mobile right now but I'll check out the sidebar when I get home, thanks!  I know I won't have a chance to shop in person for a few weeks so I ordered a highly rated Maidenform bra on Amazon. It was only $18 and free returns, so I think I'll start there and see how it goes."
ABraThatFits,3aitzx,Shanakitty,2,Sat Jun 20 19:06:41 2015 UTC,"I discovered that I can access the sidebar via alien blue, so I did some more reading (man there's a lot to read here!)  I believe I have a narrow to very narrow root, and I'm full on bottom."
ABraThatFits,3aitzx,Shanakitty,2,Sun Jun 21 00:25:34 2015 UTC,"Ok, if you are correct about your shape, you may find that molded cups (seamless foam cups) don't work very well for you, as the tend to be wide-ish and pretty shallow, without much room at the bottom, and expecting more fullness at the top than you may have. Good bras to try to start out with are Cleo Lucy/Kali (which is good for full-on-bottom) and Cleo Lily/Erin (which is even, but one of the most narrow, projected bras you will find outside of Polish--though that may not be as true in your size range, I'm not sure about how it scales).  It may be that someone makes molded t-shirt bras that are relatively narrow and FoB friendly; perhaps someone who fits in the matrix will have some ideas there."
ABraThatFits,3aitzx,stinkylittleone,2,Sun Jun 21 00:38:00 2015 UTC,Thanks! I have a Cleo Lucy in my amazon cart for $53. Is that a good price?
ABraThatFits,3aitzx,stinkylittleone,2,Sun Jun 21 01:45:06 2015 UTC,"It's not a bad price. With sales, Cleo bras can be had for maybe $35, but they may have sold out of all of last season's colors in your size by now."

I just bought my first 30dd bra after wearing 32b forever (and having boob spillage everywhere). I like this new bra, but it's so full coverage, which I'm not used to. Obviously, moving up a few cup sizes means there's going to be more fabric there, but does anyone have suggestions of brands/styles of less full-coverage, large cup-size, bras for a girl who wants some cleavage every now and again?"

ABraThatFits,3ahl2o,vanillabubbles16,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:58:59 2015 UTC,"Try Affinitas Intimates (A-DD line). The cups are pretty shallow and the bands can run firm, so the 32D may work for you in some styles. I think Allison or Nicole starts at a 30. The Affinitas Parfait line starts at 28 in Charlotte and that cup is shallow as well, I think moreso in the contour cup than the balconett. You could also check out Tamra, Casey(plunge shallow wide) or Sophia (shallow, but the wires are narrower in the t-shirt cut, so keep that in mind). It's a start, good luck!"
ABraThatFits,3ah2ex,mlp-art,11,Sat Jun 20 02:54:10 2015 UTC,"I totally get you. The big problem is that very very few high-quality brands make bras in large bandsizes. It is a supply-demand and distribution channel thing. Traditional bra brands distribute to boutiques and high-end department stores, places that don't get many plus-size customers. So they don't buy 40+ bands from their suppliers and as a result  branded bra manufacturers see no incentive to make them.   It is places like Walmart and Lane Bryant that end up catering to these plus-size customers because they see a niche market and they have the financial and organisational power to order directly from a bra manufacturer in China and market directly to their customers, cutting out the traditional lingerie industry.   That said, some known quality brands that make larger sizes are Ulla Dessous, Panache Sculptresse, Anita, PourMoi?, Elomi, Goddess and Glamorise.    (which I call 'rocket boobs', which are mostly conical with large nipples. Neither full on top of bottom, just sort of uniformly cones.).    This description reminds me of tuberous breasts. With a shape like this, you probably need smaller cups than the calculator gave you. (Warning - please ignore the extremely body negative descriptions and labels of tuberous breasts if you search for the term.)   Finding a good bra for you will involve determining wire width - how wide do you need your wires to be? If you can live with narrow wires, Ulla Dessous, PourMoi? and Panache Sculptresse might have have something that suits your shape. If you need wide wires, some had luck with the Elomi Jocelyn cut."
ABraThatFits,3ah2ex,t_maia,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:48:01 2015 UTC,"Great info, will look into those brands when I have money to play with. I did find some 40D Hanes perfection fit that the cups and wires are perfect on (almost demi cup) but the band is obviously a bit too tight. Going to slap some extenders on them in the meantime. I've never had to budget for bras before, but I think looking my best will help my self confidence. Bra shopping is exhausting though. Lane Bryant near me and Avenue only ever have very large cups, much too large and lots of coverage, which doesn't work with my shape.  There's a specialty bra shop that opened near me, but every time I walk past their windows they're closed and the shapes and styles don't mesh with me..  Maybe it's worth a try going there but I worry about pushy sales lady/fitter and don't have hundreds to invest in nice bras. The shop oozes dollar signs..."
ABraThatFits,3ah2ex,GodzillaSuit,3,Sun Jun 21 20:15:58 2015 UTC,"You can try Nordstrom, if you have one by you. Also, amazon has a pretty good selection and a decent number of bras with free returns. I would go that route to try to find what works. I'm not near your size our shadow, so I can't offer any specific recommendations, but I've had decent success between Nordstrom and amazon."
ABraThatFits,3ah2ex,EmmaInFrance,4,Sat Jun 20 03:34:07 2015 UTC,"Looking at your measurements, I would suggest that perhaps, you might be more successful in a 44 band, perhaps 44E would be a good size to try, particularly if you try Elomi as their bands tend to be generous."

A lot of these bras may have been ""too tight"" because the cup is too small. No indication if bra band fit was tested independently of cup fit.  Beginner's guide and measurement/fit guide both explain how to make a good fit check."

There just wasn't room for all the columns to fit on my blog. I've used that fit guide.  That's how I know that I need to send ALL of these bras back.  None of them fit correctly.  lol.

ABraThatFits,3agezi,miatpd,2,Fri Jun 19 23:00:39 2015 UTC,"I do think you are quite narrow and projected for your size range, with possibly tall roots.  I have the same problem with straps, and I have a short torso but low set boobs.  Hard to tell on the back pain, I wish I had some answers for you on that.  I do know Panache (who makes Cleo) uses some hella firm wires, but that shouldn't cause upper back pain.  I think the Marcie is a keeper.  I see a few wrinkles but nothing of any significance, really.  The wire width looks good.  The Marvel is too big all over.  The wires look too wide too.  Most bras (esp. Cleos) are graded in shape to be wider and shallower on the smaller end since that is the most common shape in the smaller sizes, so I can see how that could be a problem for you.  Maybe hunt around on BTB or braswap for some small-size Comexims?  They are out there.  They'll likely be narrow and projected enough.  Their lettering is different since they don't do double letters below F, and they do their bands in CMs, so you'd be looking for a 65E, which is index size 30:5 and translates to UK 30DD.  I believe they also do 65D (30D UK).  They do half cups and plunges, and from what I've heard their half cups run a little wider and smaller.  If you're feeling froggy you can always order from them directly at www.comexim.pl.  I hear it gets easier once you've done it once or twice lol.  As far as unlineds go, is the Marvel offered in a 30D?  It might work better in a smaller size, maybe try some other unlined Freyas if they make 30D's.  Other than that, Marcie and its sister cuts (Bella, Ellis, Zia, and whatever they named the SS2015 collection) will probably be your best bet."
ABraThatFits,3agezi,lcl0706,3,Sat Jun 20 00:14:28 2015 UTC,I don't know if OP is all that narrow and projected. Marcie is pretty shallow in smaller sizes. I was expecting Freya Marvel to be equally shallow but it doesn't seem to be that way. Maybe the apex on Marvel is just way higher and that's why there's so much gaping? I can't tell if she's really filling out the bottom.
ABraThatFits,3agezi,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:39:47 2015 UTC,"I do fill out the bottom of the Marvel, there's just a lot of gaping at the top. I've been planning on trying a 30D with my next Amazon order, so maybe that will be an option?   I am also surprised to hear that I could be narrow, as I've tried quite a few bras that seemed too narrow, cutting into my breast tissue on the side. I suppose it is possible that they were just too small overall?"
ABraThatFits,3agezi,lcl0706,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:01:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions!! For budget reasons I've basically been only ordering from places that have free shipping and free returns, so I haven't really thought about trying Comexim. And as I mentioned in another reply, I've never thought that I might be narrow, since several bras have cut into my breast tissue on the side. But maybe I can look into braswap and just give one a try.  I'm glad to get good feedback on the Marcie, since it definitely fits better than any of the others I've tried lately. Maybe with better posture and a breaking-in period I can get rid of the back pain..."
ABraThatFits,3agezi,Goddess_Keira,2,Sat Jun 20 01:06:56 2015 UTC,"You may not be all that narrow then. Comexim will be narrower than anything else you've tried. So that may not be a good suggestion. I took a stab at projected because you said youve pushed down the cups of other shallow recommended bras and just based on your pics you don't look overly shallow, to me."
ABraThatFits,3agezi,gliterpoison,2,Sat Jun 20 01:16:43 2015 UTC,"I think Marcie looks excellent on you. I hope the straps are not too short for comfort. The wrinkling is insignificant; I would say it's just due to the tension of the straps which is always going to pull on the fabric because the straps are holding it up and there has to be some tension on them. You fill the cups out nicely.  I'm not sure if you have particularly tall roots or not, but I would say that you are low-set and even in shape. Being low-set is most likely what cause straps to be short on you.  Edit: I think you could do well in unlined Freya balcony bras. Rio and Gem might both work for you. I believe they're best for FoT, but in your size they could well work, or if not, have a look at the fit check for Freya Beau. That poster is your size and looks close enough to your shape that I could see that bra fitting you as well, and others in that cut that are fuller on bottom."
ABraThatFits,3agx38,bracheckpls,4,Sat Jun 20 01:59:06 2015 UTC,"The band on Panache Loretta is quite firm, and other people have reported that it was too tight in their usual band size. You can buy a bra band extender to make the band a little longer (it's basically three extra columns of eyes), but since you aren't thrilled with the shape of this bra, I would just send it back. This bra is kind of oddly shaped overall, it's a tricky fit for many people. You are not the only one who found it pointy!  One sister size up with a longer band would be 34E. There is no EE in the UK sizing system.  As far as recommendations go, it's certainly possible that you have a full on bottom shape. Because of the way the bra is constructed, I think it's likely (it tends to cut in and cause quadboob for even/FoT breasts). A bra that will hopefully give you a more rounded shape would be Cleo Lucy. It does not have any more padding than Panache Loretta, but most padded bras are not very roomy on the bottom. I would also recommend getting a couple of the bra band extenders that I mentioned earlier - it will help you transition into this new tighter band size, and it will help you break in especially tight bras like Panache Loretta."
ABraThatFits,3agx38,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:12:31 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend Le Mystere and Simone Perele bras to you. The sizing is different (D>E>F>G), so you should try 32G and 34F.  It's hard to say what caused the gaping in your old bras. The size/shape could be wrong or you could have short roots."
ABraThatFits,3agx38,fitzbra,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:21:46 2015 UTC,"Cup gapping in your old size doesn't necessarily mean full on bottom -- that could have been caused by the underwires riding up onto breast tissue (that was the case for me in my old size and I have pretty even fullness).  I've heard a good suggestion from people here on how to check full on top or bottom -- bend over 90Â° while braless and see which way your nipples point. If they point away from your legs, you're likely full on bottom. If they point towards your legs, you're likely full on top. Here's a blog post with lots of (MS Paint cartoon) illustrations of full on top/full on bottom shapes and of the leaning test."
ABraThatFits,3agby7,throwaway4boobz,3,Fri Jun 19 22:33:39 2015 UTC,"You're wearing both Lily's underwires way too low. They should be exactly at your breast root, no space or skin on skin contact under breasts. Also, are you scooped in well? I think Lily might be too narrow for you and that's why you want to wear it so low.  I can't tell underwire position for Bardot because you've taken photos from above and a bit too close so the underwires are hidden on a lot of your photos in general.  If you can find Masquerade Capella in 32FF you should try that. It's not very likely as it's been discontinued for a while but no other molded bra has even come close for me. Beyond that I'd suggest Wellfitting longline t-shirt demi bra. I'm not certain of the sizing as it's not been reviewed yet.  I think you should try Cleo Lucy and Freya balcony plunges."
ABraThatFits,3agby7,noys,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:06:48 2015 UTC,"Really?

I've worn a lot of bras with the underwire too low and this doesn't feel like them, but I'll definitely double check when I wear them today again. All scooped in too! I'll look for those. I've seen masquarade capella recommended before on this sub and tried to find it with no luck. So tragic ;_; Thanks!"
ABraThatFits,3agby7,noys,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:40:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is no skin on skin contact but the underwires are over half an inch below your breast tissue. You shouldn't have empty space between where the underwires sit and your breast root. Look at where the underwire marks are when you take off the bra."
ABraThatFits,3agby7,noys,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:01:05 2015 UTC,I have to remove this comment because nude images are not allowed on the subreddit.  It looks like it's too narrow in the outer lower corner of the cup and that's pushing everything down to avoid underwires sitting on breast tissue.
ABraThatFits,3agby7,noys,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:35:45 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm sorry, I thought it would be ok since I was mostly covered and I've seen other people post similar photos. My bad! Is there a better way I could take a picture like this next time?  I see what you mean now, like the outside top looks ok but the angle of the wire is kinda steep and cuts in at the bottom. How much wider do you think I should I go?"
ABraThatFits,3agby7,Saskia_C,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:56:44 2015 UTC,"Not much really... But it depends on the wire shape, you need a rather U-shaped wire that will have the width at the bottom. Maybe Panache Envy?"
ABraThatFits,3aff9o,TheDodgyStalker,5,Fri Jun 19 18:13:56 2015 UTC,Consider the new Wellfitting longline t-shirt halfcups in 70/32HH.
ABraThatFits,3aff9o,noys,2,Fri Jun 19 20:50:53 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll give it a try! Any suggestions about sizing? Not sure how TTS they run.  edit: jk I can't read. Thank you :)
ABraThatFits,3aff9o,noys,2,Fri Jun 19 22:11:49 2015 UTC,"34H is an option too, yes. I'm not sure how firm they are TBH."
ABraThatFits,3aff9o,crazymusicalgenius96,3,Sat Jun 20 11:20:13 2015 UTC,"Maybe a half cup style would work better for you? Considering that you're getting a decent fit in Marcie most of them might end up being way too shallow for you, but if you were to find one that was only slightly too shallow it might give you the rounded/minimized profile you're looking for without too much quadboob and wires sliding out of your IMF.   Cleo Juna is actually nicely projected once you get past FF/G cup, and it's a half cup with a nice tall gore. Comes in beige, ivory, and black. It does have this lace accent on the top edge of the cup that's supposed to stick up if it's fitting you correctly, but you can tuck it in or remove it if it shows a lot. It's lightly lined and seamed rather than moulded, but it only has one seam in the center of the cup. If you haven't tried it already, I suggest giving it a go in 32GG, as it runs small.  If that one doesn't work, there's also Masquerade Capella, a moulded half cup with lots of space for projected breasts. It gives a pretty round shape, from the pictures I've seen of it. Unfortunately it's been long discontinued, but we think that Panache Black Odette is made using the same mold. We aren't sure, though, since nobody has done a fit check to compare the two yet. Masquerade Capella definitely runs big, so if you manage to track one down you should probably try 32FF. Again we aren't sure about Panache Black Odette, so no matter what size you try we'd recommend getting it from somewhere that's nice about returns."
ABraThatFits,3aff9o,ma342,2,Fri Jun 19 19:26:28 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same thing about the half cups, and I LOVE the cakes on a plate cleavage that they give. But yeah, the problem is that most of them are just too shallow. I tried the Freya Patsy padded half cup and I loved it, but it was a 32F so I sent it back and am waiting on a 30GG to come in.  Where were you 4 days ago? haha I tried the Cleo Juna in a 32G and I did like the shape it gave me, but I was quad-boobing and I couldn't tell if it was because it was too small or just a shape mismatch. So based on what you said I'll probably reorder in a 32GG. I also don't like that the lace sticks out otherwise it might be a good tshirt bra, but I could always cut it off if I really liked the fit.   I'll look around, maybe on ebay or something, and see if I can find some of the Masquerade half cups in my size."
ABraThatFits,3aff9o,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Fri Jun 19 22:08:13 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely try the Juna in 32GG. I have to size up in it compared to Cleo Lily/Lucy/Marcie, because it's shallower. I find the band runs stretchy, too.   I'm quite projected and can get away with wearing the Juna even though the shape isn't quite right."
ABraThatFits,3aff9o,buymeflowers,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:08:10 2015 UTC,"I was on vacation! And definitely look for Masquerade half cups, even the seamed ones, as they are narrower than most others. Fauve half cups might work, too."
ABraThatFits,3aff9o,dwellondreams,4,Fri Jun 19 22:23:00 2015 UTC,"Tossing another suggestion into the ring, though they are hard to track down, Masquerade halfcups could certainly fit the bill here. I would firstly suggest Dephi, Rhea, Medina, Coco, Maya, and if you can't track down those, Celene, Rosetti, Cerise, Georgia and Arquette could potentially work."
ABraThatFits,3aff9o,dwellondreams,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:36:43 2015 UTC,So many options. I love it! Thanks.
ABraThatFits,3aff9o,basylica,3,Fri Jun 19 22:12:20 2015 UTC,"Do you have a problem with the bras shuffling down because of your projection?   If you want a really rounded, almost minimised look, Tutti Rouge Liliana is padded in the bottom construction of the cup, but has space for upper fullness. Here's a blog post from a FOT girl who loves the Liliana for a rounded look.  Another plunge option for soft tissue might be Bravissimo Satine."
ABraThatFits,3af9lz,gibbie,14,Fri Jun 19 17:31:16 2015 UTC,"So you could be allergic to some materials that are in bras, such as the elastic.   But if you're not in the best size, the bras won't be comfortable, even if you're not allergic! A bra that has too large a band will shift and slide around on your body, irritating the skin. Additionally, a bra that has too large a band will also rub into your underarms.   Give the Beginner's Guide a read over, and measure yourself, if you want to try to get some better bras.  P.S. Don't put your bras in the drier! It ruins the elastic, just leave them to air dry!"

ABraThatFits,3af9lz,stormy381,12,Fri Jun 19 18:00:38 2015 UTC,"I get rashes and pimples under my boobs and have been getting rashes under my arms that feel like a really bad sunburn.    Check that  a) your underwires are in your inframammary fold. If you've still got underboob when wearing a bra, then it's not supportive enough/the right shape/the right size.  b) again, with the underboob thing, if there's skin on skin under your boob, there's going to be a sweaty environment which will cause more bacteria  c) if your bra is rubbing loads, or if the wires are moving around a bit, this can irritate the skin, I would also recommend, as dwellondreams says, checking out the beginners guide, the shape guide and the ""bra size calculator"" to see if there might be a better size for you."
ABraThatFits,3af9lz,xuenylom,8,Fri Jun 19 17:45:54 2015 UTC,The first one that you listed was my guess too. I will bet money that the bra is not sitting in the IMF. I used to get these too REALLY bad because my cup size was too small and too shallow and the band was too big so the bottom of my boobs would lay flat against my rib cage and that caused the angriest rashes in summer time. This can get really bad and even become infected.
ABraThatFits,3af9lz,DoctorFlimFlam,3,Fri Jun 19 21:29:02 2015 UTC,"I also used to get terrible rashes from wearing too-small a cup size and thus never being able to get the underwire to sit on the IMF.

ABraThatFits,3af9lz,cleverdistraction,2,Sat Jun 20 00:13:45 2015 UTC,"My boobs have a crease but not a fold at the IMF, I've got more like two gradual cones strapped to my chest, and yet I already have spots (but no rash) so in glad I've found a better size than my old 32Bs as I can't imagine what sort of pain my boobs would be in otherwise!"
ABraThatFits,3af9lz,xuenylom,4,Fri Jun 19 21:42:18 2015 UTC,"When in doubt, see your primary care physician or NP. It could be simple irritation from the material or it could be a bacterial or fungal infection, in which case it will need the proper treatment. Good Luck!"

You can always check out the bra band project (nsfw- boobs in bras) if you're comfortable.   The calculator is a great starting point, but it's a place to start. You might find yourself more comfortable in a 30G or a 32F or any number of close sizes. Shape is the next clue to what bras to try. Have you looked at the shape diagram (sidebar) yet?   Feel free to post your measurements to have them double checked!"
ABraThatFits,3adds6,sirenita12,10,Fri Jun 19 05:45:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!  Still getting over the shock, so I haven't really explored the sidebar yet. I'm curious about how things like swimsuits are actually working for me now that I know I'm this far off. I guess I have a lot to learn!  Also--I am PMSing right now. Could that have something to do with it? How much do women generally fluctuate throughout the month?  That bra band project site is calming me down, thank you very much for that. I think I look similar to those women."
ABraThatFits,3adds6,sirenita12,17,Fri Jun 19 05:56:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah... Once you have a great bra, swimsuits get tricky.

ABraThatFits,3adds6,-Barbamama-,11,Fri Jun 19 06:04:47 2015 UTC,Yes it is possible your measurements are slightly different now. You could measure yourself again after your period to be sure.

I went from 36-38B to 32DD and must have remeasured and recalculated 5 times because I could not believe it. There was no way someone like me with a small/medium bust could possibly wear DD, I thought. But it was true. I had so many weird fit issues in 36B and thought my body was just unusually-shaped, but it turns out none of those fit issues happen in 32DD. The bra actually stays where it should and supports me properly. Nothing rides up or falls down, and I actually fill out the cups much better now.  It was hard for me to visualize at first, but cup size isn't absolute -- 32FF isn't the same size boobs as 40FF. Cup size is just the difference between underbust and bust. So there is no such thing as just ""C-cup boobs"" or ""DD-cup boobs"" or ""FF-cup boobs"" without knowing the band size. This SFW illustration helped me understand how it works.  Also, check out these photos of real people wearing 32FF bras at the Bra Band Project. Do their busts look sort of like yours?"

Incredible that you mention this because I thought exactly the same thing as you! I used to wear size 34-36 B-D (honestly, trying on whichever feels more comfortable at the time). Just recently I was like, right, I am gonna get measured professionally. I need to find out what my size is and not walk around with 6 different sizes of one type of bra every time.  Anyway, the lady measured me and she said I was definitely a 32. I was like, wow, are you sure? And then we tried various cups and she didn't tell me what they were at first (I was pretty confident I was a D despite buying B to D. Sounds confident, right?). Eventually we landed on a cup size and she giggled saying they were DD. I was like.. what? I could not believe I was a 32DD. Absolutely no way. But I see the difference, the support is amazing.

It's nice to have bras that don't move around on my chest and slide up my back, I don't have to worry about the band showing in the back if I'm wearing a dress or a cami. The straps stay on my shoulders, they're supportive and way more comfortable than my old bras. It takes a while to get used to the tighter band size, though.

ABraThatFits,3adds6,Sunset96,5,Fri Jun 19 13:37:35 2015 UTC,If you were tugging the band down you may be better off in a smaller band. Did you fully exhale and pull the tape as tight as humanly possible when you were measuring yourself?

ABraThatFits,3adds6,ayechrissy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:25:43 2015 UTC,"VS is notoriously inaccurate with their measuring. They like to measure above the bust for band size, which overestimates the band size and underestimates cup size for most people. VS's measuring technique gives me 38B-D (depending on what bra I'm wearing while measuring), ABTF's measurements put me between 28K and 26KK. ABTF's measurements are definitely more accurate for me."
ABraThatFits,3adds6,LadyBoobsalot,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:26:48 2015 UTC,"I definitely need to measure myself then. Since I primarily shop at VS, would it make sense to use their sizing in general?"
ABraThatFits,3adds6,ayechrissy,2,Sat Jun 20 06:04:20 2015 UTC,"Not really. For the most part 32 bands will stretch to approximately 32 inches (and 34 bands to 34 inches, etc.) regardless of how a brand tells you to measure. You want a band with a stretched length that is pretty close to your underbust measurement. The band is what does most of the work (80-90% of the support comes from the band, only 10-20% from the straps) so it needs to be quite snug to do its job properly. VS bras are fine if you fit into their size range but definitely try out the ABTF measuring guide."

A lot of the time I forget I'm wearing a bra because my boobs don't go everywhere. Now I put on my 34C's on for a laugh every now and then, because I don't know how I went all day in them! I know it sounds big, but it is just because of society's cup size standards of DD=huge and below 34 bands are for preteens, which results in a lot of people wearing bras that are not the best size for them :-) If I were you I'd go out and get a $1 measuring tape from the sewing section or wherever, as that is likely to be more accurate than the twine with measurements.

ABraThatFits,3adds6,sjgw137,4,Fri Jun 19 13:17:38 2015 UTC,"34C is one of the most commonly bought sizes, especially if you're younger."
ABraThatFits,3adds6,EireaKaze,2,Fri Jun 19 16:05:58 2015 UTC,"I'm guilty. When I weighed a little more than I do now, I was in a 34C at age 13-14. Then I lost weight, and moved to a 34B, and a couple other obscure sizes, 36A, 38B once. I don't really know what I was thinking. It took me a couple years to realize how wrong the 34B was."
ABraThatFits,3adds6,sjgw137,2,Fri Jun 19 16:13:59 2015 UTC,"That was me, I think. Bras are a psychological whirlwind as well as a physical struggle, and people can get really attached to their bra size. It becomes part of your identity as a breast-owner. Each matrix size has its own connotation, and people come here and suddenly think they've got ""porn star boobs"" because they don't measure as a C cup. I've seen people get implants and then progressively downsize because they were properly measured after surgery (usually in the F-G range on their band size) and all they wanted was to own a bra with the letter D on it.   I did choose 34C in particular because it's so commonly sold."

ABraThatFits,3adds6,sjgw137,2,Fri Jun 19 11:57:47 2015 UTC,"These are also European sizes.  Note that the sizes translated to US are very different.  If you're like I was, your bras are probably the closest to right size you could find in the cute pattern at your local teen-centric store.  (This isn't an offensive put-down... I loved my purple flame, zip up bra with a passion...)   ABTF is focused on getting the right size, not the fashionable size.  Depending on the support you need (I'm a 36FF, LOTS OF SUPPORT NEEDED) you might find the trauma of switching sizes actually one of the happiest experiences for comfort.  (Doesn't mean I didn't still wear my really cute, wrong size bra because-- DARN IT, it's CUTE)."
ABraThatFits,3adds6,LadyVerene,3,Fri Jun 19 13:28:09 2015 UTC,"I also want to mention that larger sizes don't mean you can't find cute bras. It does mean you'll probably end up on line more often.

I would tell you to try The Little Bra Company next since I know they do 28's in small cups, but I don't think they go to 28D and I've heard TLBC runs small in the cups so I'm afraid a 28C will be too small.  Might be worth a shot, though.  You're kinda stuck in a size that is quite hard to find, because you definitely need a 28 band.  I hope someone else can chime in with more suggestions.

Mimi Holliday is $$$ and Comexim is Polish.  So... at least those are ideas.  Otherwise, your best bet may be to get TLBC bras in 30C and alter your bands tighter, or get a Rixie Clip from Amazon."

The good part is that they're cheap and cute and ASOS has really excellent shipping and returns policies.

ABraThatFits,3afz39,IFUalot,6,Fri Jun 19 20:49:17 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing you recorded the sister size results from our calculator on your graph, too. I'm trying to think of a calculator that would give you a size of 34H UK, as judging from the dots I would estimate that you got 30F/FF from our calculator. (Those are two different UK sizes, by the way: 30F and 30FF.)   The various C/D cup results are probably from calculators using the +4 method (where you add 4 inches to your underbust prior to calculating cup size) or the overbust method (where you measure above your breasts, basically in your armpits, to get the band size).   If I were to make a graph like this out of available bra size calculators, my graph would be much more boring than yours. Because of my general smallness, using most other calculators spits out one of two predictable results: 32A (the smallest size in stock) or ""your band size is not valid"". These calculators are designed to spit out a commonly sold size, no matter what your measurements are, because the +4 method and overbust method give a less accurate picture of your size. A majority of the people who use our calculator find their most comfortable fit within a cup size and/or band size of their original calculated size. (We just did a demographics survey not too long ago, and it was something like 80%, I think.) It does get less reliable in larger band and cup sizes, but we have alternate methods and people who are experienced with those sizes to help figure out a better starting point."

I've seen everything from 36A to 30GG, with this calculator giving me 32DD. I have no idea what my size is. I have a 32E but it's the wrong shape and the wires are really hard and they press into me a lot, even though my snug measurement is 30.5."
ABraThatFits,3afz39,rainydayseveryday,2,Fri Jun 19 21:55:58 2015 UTC,"My underbust is actually 26.5 snug, so even with +4 that still only gets me to a 30 band. Which is why they tell me I don't exist. (Or maybe I'm a ghost and nobody wanted to break the secret to me?)  I want to know where this calculator is that overestimates so much! With you getting 30GG and OP getting 34H, it's gotta be the same one.  My overbust measurement is 32 (thanks tall roots), which is why VS gave me 32A rather than sending me down the hall to Nordstrom. I put one of my VS bras on my overbust once, and it was actually perfectly snug there! Of course, the cups only made it a third of the way down my breasts in that position...but hey, the band was finally comfy!"
ABraThatFits,3afz39,crazymusicalgenius96,3,Fri Jun 19 22:05:44 2015 UTC,"I think OP's may have been a US 34H, based on her graph, which would be a UK 34FF."

ABraThatFits,3afygq,Kadosira,3,Fri Jun 19 20:44:06 2015 UTC,"30E/F sounds about right based on your measurements. Your current bras have the same cup volume as 30F, so the biggest change you'll be experiencing is a tighter band and different cup shapes.   It's totally understandable that you've been overwhelmed by the available options in your size! There are thousands of different bras. Most people with narrow roots are at least moderately projected, so if you're more sure about that then I'd suggest starting with a narrower bra rather than a wide and shallow one. A good starter bra for FoB breasts is Cleo Lucy, which is easily purchased on Amazon. I'd get 30E and 30F if you can, as you are still trying to nail down size.  If you've got a Nordstrom or Dillard's nearby, my other suggestion would be to stop by and check them out. With Nordstrom, you can go online and see what bras your nearest stores have in 30E and 30F. It does depend on your region, but in general the larger stores have more selection. Try on as much stuff as you can find, take notes and pictures for your own personal reference, and then come back here if you want help puzzling through any fit issues you got."
ABraThatFits,3afygq,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:09:24 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the information. I will definitely be ordering some Cleo's from Amazon. I do have a Dillards nearby. I'll stop in soon to check things out.   Yeah, I wasn't 100% sure on the narrow and shallow part. I'll have to do a bit more studying on that. I'm sure getting in to the correct size bra will make it easier for me to tell."
ABraThatFits,3afygq,noys,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:10:37 2015 UTC,Dillard's only carries US brands so you'll want to try 30DDD/F and 30DDDD/G.
ABraThatFits,3agbsu,abtfthrowaway333,3,Fri Jun 19 22:32:12 2015 UTC,"I think that fit looks excellent. As for the band, is it comfortable? It doesn't look too snug at all. Riding up is sign of a too-loose band, but I don't think that band is riding up in any significant way--does it feel as though it is? It looks like the ends are slightly out of alignment due to the way it's sewn; but that is insignificant. I can see that it is maybe fractionally out of a perfectly horizontal line, but so very slightly. As you've already tried the 28E Freya and it was much too tight, I think you have the right size here.  I'm not sure what else to suggest, other than unlined Freyas with a similar cut--I'm not familiar with these but you can look them up on Bratabase."
ABraThatFits,3agbsu,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:52:16 2015 UTC,"The band is comfortable and I can just fit two fingers under it. The 28E's band was lung-crushing tight. It isn't sliding around wearing it. Maybe the slight ""riding up"" might just be because my ribs are kind of flared out in front? Thank you, though, I'm glad to have assurance that this is a good fit!"
ABraThatFits,3agbsu,Goddess_Keira,2,Fri Jun 19 23:15:57 2015 UTC,You're welcome. :) I agree that the rib flare could be what's causing the band to come up slightly and it's not an issue of fit. That is such a pretty bra!
ABraThatFits,3agbsu,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Sat Jun 20 00:13:32 2015 UTC,"A band that's riding up typically means that it's too loose, but I don't think that's the case here. It might just be from the way you're standing - if I slouch even a tiny bit, it looks like my band is riding up when it really isn't.   Other than the band this looks really good! You do have a tiny bit of side spillage on your larger side but that may just be your tail of Spence.   If you want to get more Freya plunge balconys, there are two on Amazon for $25 each, and tons of them available quite inexpensively on Ebay. Freya Fifi and Starlet plunge balcony are the ones available on Amazon, they aren't exactly the same but will be similar. From Ebay, there's a cheap Morning Meadow and a slightly more expensive Ignite that are almost identical to Freya Beau except for the color.   Panache Envy would also be a good idea, I think, especially if you're looking for a beige bra. Freya doesn't do a whole lot of beige with their plunge balconys."

I'm working on my posture, so this bra might be another way to help me tell what I'm doing.  I'm pretty sure the spillage around my right armpit is my tail of Spence. I can't stand bras that put pressure on the fronts of my shoulders, though, so to me this fit feels perfect around the armpit.  I'd love to have a bra that disappears better under clothes, so the Panache Envy sounds great. The colorways of this model look pretty nice, but the lace on this Beau seems like it's made to show through clothes! Thank you for checking!"

ABraThatFits,3ag5x2,rainydayseveryday,5,Fri Jun 19 21:44:05 2015 UTC,"The Flourish padded longline will be pretty good.   DO NOT GET THE PATSY PLUNGE BALCONY. Don't get any of Freya's plunge balconys. The plunge balcony bras are narrow and projected with tight upper edges, so they demand a very specific shape. I'm about average in projection and I tried one of them (in a cup size down from my typical size, too!) and it was still way too projected and cut in to my tall roots. It was a wrinkled disaster.   Look for the Patsy padded half cup instead, it's gonna work a lot better. If you can't find the Patsy padded half cup, look for Rapture padded half cup, as it's even shallower than the Patsy padded half cup.   Freya wires are very malleable and stretchy so you should be fine there."
ABraThatFits,3ag5x2,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:53:55 2015 UTC,"I made a mistake, it is the padded half cup. I was confused because I read somewhere that for shallow shape, there should be no horizontal seams, and there weren't any."
ABraThatFits,3ag5x2,crazymusicalgenius96,3,Fri Jun 19 22:01:31 2015 UTC,"No problem! We've had that happen several times, because Freya labels bras based upon what fabric they used.   I think I was the one who told you no horizontal seams, because you were looking for bras with no vertical seams. I probably should have emphasized that you should be looking for bras that have all vertical seams, as those are most likely to be shallow. They are pretty much always half cups, I haven't seen a bra with more coverage than that having only vertical seams. They have the most open top edges as there are no diagonal or horizontal seams to make the bra more closed on top. Great for tall roots! They look like this: http://www.bratabase.com/browse/ewa-michalak/chp-gazeta/ (This bra in particular would be too narrow for you, but the seams show up beautifully against the newspaper print.) Bras with a mixture of seam directions (some diagonal, some vertical, some horizontal) are much more variable in what types of breasts they will accommodate. There are some that do work for shallow breasts, but there are some that definitely do not."
ABraThatFits,3ag5x2,M_tridactyla,2,Fri Jun 19 22:21:12 2015 UTC,"It depends. I wear 32E and Patsy is still too dang narrow. In 32F the width is better, but then the cup is too deep. I hope you don't run into that problem.  Bratabase says Flourish in 32E has a cup width of 5.4"", which is really pretty average width. Cleo Marcie is about the same width and depth in the same size, for example.  Shallow depth in 32E (according to me dicking around with Bratabase and measuring bras I wear too) is around 9"", probably up to 9.5"".  I think I already recommended this bra to you, but if Patsy (and Flourish, which is a longline cut based on Patsy) is too narrow for you, try Body By Victoria Unlined Demi. The lace one is very open on top; the microfiber one is more closed on top so it might work better for your FOB fullness."
ABraThatFits,3afq7h,StronglyPetite,3,Fri Jun 19 19:38:49 2015 UTC,"To be perfectly honest, I had never heard of a case for a sticky bra before. Most people I've encountered who've used them have only used them a couple of times.   However, I think I found the case you were looking at and it seems like the fabric does stick to the bra, preventing the two cups from sticking to each other. It seems to mostly be used for travel; the reviewers on Amazon said that they used it because the box provided with the sticky bra was too big to pack in a suitcase. I would try to find one that is the same brand as your sticky bra, because I'm sure sticky bras aren't all exactly the same shape and the case might be the wrong shape for a bra from another brand.  I'm in the US, but I found a NuBra case on Amazon for $16 USD. UK Amazon may or may not have it."

How does the Diament feel, support wise? S and CHP are very jiggly (a fact that was reiterated to me the other day as I was walking down the street and some jerk across from me goes ""boingg, boinggg, boingggg"" as I walk past him :/).  Retrying PL in a larger size might be better suited to you - the gore will be higher in an 80HH to help combat spilling, and the top cup edge does a lot more shaping/holding than S or CHP, which are basically just open abysses.  The BM looks great. If it's comfy I would keep it, for sure. The Guzik.. Its not bad, but the top embroidered panel is pressing on breast tissue. Its marginally noticable in the tank you have on, and would probably not be detectable in a looser or darker colored shirt.   Karmelki wrinkles are not fit related, the fabric is silky and stretchy and fits a bit loosely on the foam pads - mine is the same way.  Are you wearing any of the S/CHPs with the extra pads?  The Stella looks really good! It could be worthwhile to track down a larger size. I'm trying to decide if the Semi-soft cuts might work for you as well, its kind of a toss up I think. You could also give Samanta's 922 and 925 cuts a try, you'd be at the very top of their cup range (I would try an 80J from them, which is technically equivalent to a 36GG UK, but their cups are WICKED deep.)  Sorry you didn't have better luck :(  On the bright side, you'll probably recoup your cost quickly if you resell, cause that Fiolecik and Slowianki are calling my name xD"

Diament feels plenty supportive. Band is felt, but not tight and doesn't really move around. I adore the comfort straps. Sooo comfy. Though I can fit 2.5 fingers in the space of the gore. When I tried an 80GG S Rarytas, it felt a touch tight and small and the 85GG were in stock, so that's why I went for the 85GG's. I just went up an additional cupsize since then. I think the main issue is the shelf on top where I dip down from my sternum and the then the tissue rises into the cup. I want more like this than what I ended up with. I think a bigger size would let my lower tissue settle more into the cup, and not be pushed up so high?   And I now have a reason to get this PL which isn't as good as the Laguna, but it's close.  No pads at all on any of the bras. I have a pile of them waiting to be put back into the bras before selling them.   I think I will track down a stella in a larger size.

ABraThatFits,3ad92l,hellebora,2,Fri Jun 19 14:29:10 2015 UTC,"It would be tough to get that upper tissue 'mounding' that the model has in the S bra, unless you had a ton of upper fullness and quite tall roots. The top section of the cups is just SO deep. You could maybe try up a cup size and add the push up pads, it might give you more of that look, but it will be a good deal more bouncy feeling.  You could also wear Diament racerback style, which would likely give more of an oomph up top as well.  Really though, its that the S bra is just so tall in the cups in this size range."
ABraThatFits,3ad92l,anonphilia,2,Fri Jun 19 15:54:46 2015 UTC,"I really wanted it for the halter style as I have a halter dress that I want to wear with it. I might try it one size up so that my tissue falls into the cup a little better. I have short, but not super short roots, I think.   I don't mind the bouncy as long as it stays in my IMF."
ABraThatFits,3ad92l,anonphilia,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:02:07 2015 UTC,"I suppose I was expecting more this (me in my Envy 34HH), rather than the stock pic."
ABraThatFits,3ad92l,LadyVerene,3,Fri Jun 19 21:07:23 2015 UTC,"My measurements are 32/35/37 underbust and 42.5/45.5/44(wearing a neutral shape bra), and I would describe my breasts as quite soft, projected, and pendulous.    I wear an 80F in EM padded bras, and 80FF in unpadded.    Her bras are differently supportive to English brands - even in a perfectly fitting bra I still get a lot of jiggle on top. The cups just don't go high enough to contain it. She wants them to fit like you see on the pictures on the site - still lots of breast exposed.    I think the 85 bands are definitely working better than the 80s, although to some degree there still seems to be distortion of the underwire. The Diament, for example, I think might work better as a 90FF or G. The link to the SM Guzik 80HH seems to be a duplicate of the 80GG Tulipan? And what size was the Bibi?    It seems like your breasts are also very close together? Have you tried a PL?"
ABraThatFits,3ad92l,anonphilia,2,Fri Jun 19 09:08:31 2015 UTC,"Fixed the link on the Guzik.  The only one that felt unsupportive was the Lawenda on me, as it did not want to stay in my IMF. And as her CHP only goes up to 80H/85GG, I do not think they are going to work for me.   Would you like me to retake any of the pics with an extender, to lessen distortion? I don't see any, but I can do that.   Link to the PL was in the previous Ewa links, but here is the PL Lilia 80GG 12/2014 direct link to the album."
ABraThatFits,3ad92l,LadyVerene,2,Fri Jun 19 12:35:33 2015 UTC,"Her CHP styles are more shallow than the PL styles, at least in my size range. It looks like the SM and BM styles are your best bet with Ewa. I agree about trying them in 85/90 bands. AFAIK all of Ewa runs at least a full band size smaller than what they translate to. I have a 36"" (80) band that stretches to a max of 33"". It may not be uncomfortable,  but it can cause distortion of the cups and the wires if the band is too tight.   As for Kris Line, I do like the way the Fortuna looks on you, but I feel like you can get a better fit in a different bra.   Have you tried Comexim?"
ABraThatFits,3ad92l,anonphilia,2,Fri Jun 19 13:37:05 2015 UTC,"Comexim is linked up in the top with links to a bratabase fit check, with three more links in the fit check for a black basic 85J, tan basic 85J, and a Georgia 85K. I can reupload to imgur if necessary."
ABraThatFits,3ad92l,Shanakitty,2,Fri Jun 19 14:35:29 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I just don't read very well.  SM Fiolek - I'm thinking 85GG might work for you in this one. It gives you a great shape  SM Guizek (80HH) - This is what leads me to believe 85GG/H might be your best size with Ewa. You can tell you have enough projection, and all of your boob fits (yay!), but I really do think you are losing some projection from wire distortion here.   BM Tulip - honestly other than the wires it looks pretty good. If you're comfortable in it and you like it, I see no reason not to keep it.   I would return everything else.   You might try CHP in 85GG/H if you're dead set on having one. And I can't blame you, because they're pretty awesome :)"
ABraThatFits,3ad92l,anonphilia,2,Fri Jun 19 14:44:11 2015 UTC,"If I do another Ewa order, I'll probably stick with the 85GG/H for the unpadded and 85 H/HH for the padded. I'm still mildly upset that the package I returned (the 12/2014 set) sat in customs in Poland for 4 months that they never picked up and I'm out the return shipping fees. But at least I got the bras back, right?"
ABraThatFits,3ad92l,buymeflowers,2,Fri Jun 19 15:00:16 2015 UTC,"I tried an S in 85HH (it was my first EM attempt) and it was a horrible failure - so much cup height. I sit somewhere between 85G and 85GG with CHP, which is why I want to try 80GG and 80H and see if those work better."

ABraThatFits,3ad92l,buymeflowers,2,Fri Jun 19 20:47:18 2015 UTC,"EM's bands are ridiculously inconsistent. I've only tried 85 bands so far, and all of them were stretchier/looser than I like (I generally wear 36s). They were all close to bring true 38s.  I looked up the Bratabase measurements for all of these bras and the bands differed wildly. Some of the 80s were closer to 34 bands while some were closer to 38 bands. There's just no real consistency.  I measure 36 snug/34 BTT and I'm going to be trying 80s because 85s are just too loose thus far."
ABraThatFits,3ad92l,anonphilia,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:40:16 2015 UTC,"Well that's odd. Guess I got lucky, because all six of mine (CHP, PL, SM, SM, BM, ST) run a full size small, while all being TTS in the cups.   Edit: 34.5"" snug, 32-31"" BTT,  and I could never fit a 75 band in any of these bras I own, if they ran true to Ewa's reputation and were a full size small."
ABraThatFits,3ad92l,buymeflowers,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:57:24 2015 UTC,"Ewa's bras do not always run large; it varies. I wear a 32 band in Panache and take a 70 band in EM. I have had a couple that I needed an extender with for the first few wears (so maybe 1/2 size small) and another that fit well at first, but quickly stretched out so that after a few months, it  started riding up a bit, even on the tightest hooks. I'm in the upper range of her standard cup sizes, and only wear very snug UK 32s, so I think that's part of why I definitely prefer 70 bands to 75s. I think someone who was more in the 32F range and wears Freya would definitely want to size up."
ABraThatFits,3ad92l,anonphilia,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:49:45 2015 UTC,I haven't experienced a band loosening. Both of my SM styles and CHP are easily 6 months old and the band is as firm as ever. I seem to be the only person I know who has long-lives bands. It would be interesting to know why?
ABraThatFits,3ad92l,hellebora,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:59:26 2015 UTC,"How quickly a bra stretches out is dependent on 4 major factors:   The quality of the elastic in the band. How you wash/dry the bra. How many bras are in your regular wear rotation. How close in size the bra is to your snug UB (so, how much tension is placed on your bra throughout the day).   If you have a lot of bras (say, more than 4), they'll last longer than 6 months for sure. If you're wearing 36s when your snug is 34, they'll also last a lot longer. Ewa bands are also, generally, a higher quality fabric, which is why they feel so supportive (ie - tight), the elastic properties of the fabric are slower to break down than your typical Cleo which uses a thin, cheap-ish mesh.  I've got a Comexim geisha 75K that is almost a year old, had a previous owner, and I'm still using an extender. My snug is 32, this bra stretches to about 31, tops. I do think that the higher quality when compared to Panache/sub brands is really what comes into play here, once upon a time I had a healthy stock of Cleo Lucies, Lilies, Marcies and by 4-5 months out I was on the tightest hooks."
ABraThatFits,3ad92l,buymeflowers,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:17:01 2015 UTC,"I'm only on the second hooks for my Freya half cups that I bought 7 months ago. Masquerade Medina, which I bought in January, is still on the first hooks (though it's been feeling slightly looser lately). My Deco Half Cup has been on the tightest hooks for 6 months but I only wear that one once a week, and I basically had to start with the tightest hooks because of the push-up pads. I'm expecting to get another year or so out of the other 3 bras I've got, do you think that's unrealistic?"
ABraThatFits,3ad92l,yellkaa,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:50:12 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily unrealistic, no, the ""6 months"" timeframe is what we estimate for 1-3 well fitting bras that are worn 12+ hours a day -- pretty much the bare necessities. Honestly, I bet a large number of women experience size/shape fluctuations well before their bras wear out, band wise. I think it would be unusual for a woman to experience absolutely zero breast changes over the course of 12-18 months  I will say that Masquerades are kind of tricky. They're quite tight when brand new, but the band itself is (usually) made of an extremely unstretchy satin, so once the elastic starts to wear out there's nothing to help it bounce back and retain its firmness. My first Delphi (absolutely heaven, btw, if you like Medina its worth a shot to try and track one down), a 32GG, was worn fairly regularly (1-2 times per week) for 9+ months; when I went to go sell it, the unstretched band measurement was a full 2.5 inches longer than when I had first purchased it."
ABraThatFits,3abytn,socialworkersuicide,5,Thu Jun 18 21:26:33 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately it can be quite difficult to get bras that are lower cut but still fit well in your size, but I guess you know that already! Elomi does quite a few plunge styles which can work for lower V-necklines although they still come up quite high at the straps for support. Their Betty style is a very popular plunge, and try also Lexi or Kenza, or Bijou if you'd like a molded bra. Panache Envy would have a good chance to fit, and although it's pretty full coverage, it's a balconette so the cut is different and might accommodate some necklines that Caitlyn won't. You could also look into Freya unlined plunges--their wires are narrower than Elomi, but check out the Freya website and you can look up styles in your size on Bratabase to see how they compare to Caitlyn in your size."
ABraThatFits,3abytn,Goddess_Keira,2,Thu Jun 18 22:26:59 2015 UTC,"Just a little fyi that different cuts, even in the same brand, might call for adjusted sizing. I'm a 38 G, too, and the Elomi Caitlin is perfect on me as well. However, when I tried on the Elomi Bijou, the 38 G gave me a little quad boob. I tried a 38 GG, and it fits like a glove :)"
ABraThatFits,3ac0w4,kaliena,9,Thu Jun 18 21:42:47 2015 UTC,A seamstress may be able to take the straps off of the bra and just turn them around. Shouldn't be too tricky unless the strap changes in width from front to back.
ABraThatFits,3ac0w4,birdmommy,3,Thu Jun 18 22:14:32 2015 UTC,This is what I was going to suggest. It would probably even be easy enough to do at home yourself as long as you know enough sewing to sew buttons.
ABraThatFits,3ac0w4,adulaire,9,Thu Jun 18 22:59:31 2015 UTC,"If she's putting her arms through the straps, and then fastening, have her try it the other way around. Fasten, swoop&scoop&adjust, then arms through the straps last.  You didn't mention what size she needs, but if she's in the ""plus size matrix"" (40-48 bands and C-DD cups) I think Bali makes some front-adjustable strap bras. You might have a look at fullbeauty.com - they have two: one and two. The full bust/plus size band market is more limited, and I think straps that adjust from the front are much more common in US brands with limited sizes.  Perhaps a multiway strapless bra, worn with the removeable straps backward, so the slider is in front? The only issue is if that slider sits right on the shoulder that could be a pressure point or painful."
ABraThatFits,3ac0w4,boo_hiss,2,Thu Jun 18 22:29:54 2015 UTC,Her biceps are morbidly obese and as such the bra can't be put on at all unless they are fully let out.
ABraThatFits,3ac0w4,grandteton,3,Thu Jun 18 22:59:24 2015 UTC,A size is absolutely needed for anyone to  give brand recommendations. I honestly  think a seamstress  is the best bet to flip the straps around though

ABraThatFits,3acig1,Angeldown,4,Fri Jun 19 00:09:03 2015 UTC,"I think it looks pretty darn good really, especially for your first go at ABTF.  You should get used to the snugness of the band, but if it bothers you at first feel free to add an extender and maybe close it on the tightest hook of an extender to give a hair more breathing room.  My experience with Fantasie tells me their bands tend to break in quickly.  Fantasie is indeed a UK brand, and they use UK sizing.  I would advise you to quit worrying what the US size is, any bra that's gonna fit in your size range will be a UK bra and the conversion to US sizing is messy and US sizes aren't regulated by any stretch of the imagination.  Just accept that America is light years behind the UK in bra sizing, engineering, education, and offerings and don't be concerned about shopping for a certain US size :-)  Fantasie (starts at 30 bands), Elomi (34 bands and up), and Freya (offers 28 bands but they're usually stretchy/loose) are all made/owned by Eveden.  Panache is another popular UK brand, with sub-brands being Cleo by Panache, Panache Black, and the recently discontinued Masquerade by Panache.  I'd say Fantasie, Freya, and Panache are ""the big 3"" dominating the UK bra scene at the moment.  Panache is known for very firm wires, Freya has softer, stretchier wires.  There's also Parfait by Affinitas (can be somewhat inconsistent in sizing) and Curvy Kate, which carries a huge size range and has recently redesigned their fit to be narrower and more projected, so if you check them out, look for their newer styles from SS2015.  You can find a lot of information from www.bratabase.com about various brands, their styles, and bra measurements uploaded by users.  BTB will also tell you what season the bra was introduced in.  A smaller UK brand is Tutti Rouge, with some adorable, fun & flirty styles but they tend to run wider and shallower.  Figleaves.com also manufactures their own lines of bras in addition to carrying most UK brands.   Figleaves has at least 2 or 3 sub-brands, including Just Peachy and Lulu Tout.  They start at 30 bands but my experience with Lulu Tout suggests their bands may run snug.  Then there's upscale $$$ lines like Marie Jo, and Prima Donna.  THEN... there's Polish manufacturers, which a lot of us like because they're your best bet for very narrow wires and lots of immediate projection.  You've got Comexim, Ewa Michalak, Avocado, and Samanta.  I would exhaust your UK options first, just based on the ease of ordering/availability, and with Fantasie seeming to work for you chances are you'll find other UK bras will as well.  Hopefully that mini-rundown gives you a bit more knowledge of what UK brands are out there!  I'm sure I left off quite a few!"
ABraThatFits,3acig1,lcl0706,2,Fri Jun 19 01:01:48 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks so much for all that info!  I think I might be up all night researching all this new stuff :)  From now on I will forget US sizing and stick with the UK stuff--seems like the UK just knows what they're doing more than the US in everything nowadays, haha!  I've never heard of extenders before, but now I'm super interested as that sounds really useful.  I might buy one online tonight so I can use it to help me get used to the tighter sizes, and in case I buy a bra online that ends up a bit too snug!  This has been very, very helpful!  I'm going to look into Freya first because I saw them at Nordstrom as well, and they looked and felt very comfortable, they just didn't have my size in stock.  I wish I could give you more than one upvote for all of this wonderful info <3"
ABraThatFits,3acig1,lcl0706,2,Fri Jun 19 01:11:42 2015 UTC,"You're welcome!  It gets addicting pretty fast.  Freya bras are generally very comfortable.  One thing I would not necessarily caution, but at least point out, about Freya is their ""padded half cup"" styles - Patsy, Rapture, Instinct - tend to run wide in the wires and shallow at the bottom of the cup.  You look like you have quite a bit of projection and you may find those styles to collapse on you at the bottom of the cup.  Don't be fooled by the term ""padded"" - I know at first when I thought padded I thought of Victorias Secret padding, but UK ""padded"" is not the same.  It's more like lined, the cup has some structure but won't add to your bust.  Freya's unlined cups tend to run narrower and more projected, and sometimes a cup size bigger than their padded cup counterparts.  Like I needed a Deco in a 28G and an unlined Freya in a 28FF.  And of course there's the ever-popular Deco Plunge molded cup.  It's boob armor, but it's very soft and will give you some oomph and cleavage.  You'd likely do best in the original Deco vs the varieties that run somewhat shallower (Vibe, Shape, Spotlight, Delight, etc) but again, I'm just guessing that because of your pictures suggesting projection.  You might also get along well with a Cleo Juna BUT Juna runs small in the cups and I can't remember what size they stop making it at.  I'd tell you to try it in a 30H if it's available.  I think that's the largest size they go.  But it's very soft and in the larger size range it's projected.  Amazon is a fabulous resource and if you don't have Prime shipping I highly recommend you get it, the 2 day shipping and free returns are worth every penny."
ABraThatFits,3acig1,redrunner,2,Fri Jun 19 01:23:58 2015 UTC,"You're not kidding!  I've already got an extender in my cart and am perusing bras in my size on Amazon, ready to splurge!  I recently lost my free 6 months of Amazon student and was on the fence about paying to continue it, but this has solidified my decision that it will be super worth it.  The UK style of padding that you're describing is actually what I prefer.  It's comfy and soft but not too thick, so my boobs are supported and feel like they're against pillows instead of scratchy lace, but don't have much false volume added to them.  I can't wait to try on other brands!"
ABraThatFits,3acig1,lcl0706,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:37:09 2015 UTC,"I have this bra too, in the same size as all of the rest of my bras, and I find the band to be quite painful after a full day of wear--and I've never had that kind of problem before. It leaves red marks that don't go away right away. Either the band is just much firmer than my other bras or something about the shape of the cup or sizing of the cup is making the band feel far tighter than my others. If it is too tight don't necessarily assume the size you picked will be wrong in other brands.    Also, I have stubbornly made myself wear it a lot since it was expensive, and it has not loosened up much at all. I should've bought one of those little bra extender clips instead of suffering through it after it was too late to return!"

ABraThatFits,3abx0k,ot12shipper,4,Thu Jun 18 21:12:53 2015 UTC,"My torso is pretty flat rather than circular, too. That doesn't really affect band size all that much because the band stretches around your whole torso, no matter what shape your ribcage is.  30D bras are going to have wider cups than 34A for sure, because the cups are larger overall. Also, the shorter band is going to help make sure the cups are surrounding your breasts rather than just floating in front. That's why you have to keep pulling your bra down - it's too loose to stay put. Imagine wearing tights or yoga pants where the waist circumference was larger than the widest point of your hips: they would just fall off! The same thing happens with bras, as they are all elastic garments.  Your armpit fat has a very good chance of being breast tissue! There are two potential forms of breast tissue that it could be. The first is your tail of Spence, which is usually situated at the front of the armpit between the breast and the upper arm. It's kind of unusual for the tail of Spence to end up inside the cups but it can happen if you've got certain shape characteristics. The second thing it could be is some breast tissue that got squished into your armpits by the too-narrow wires you were talking about earlier. This breast tissue usually hangs out just to the side of your breast underneath your armpit. Wearing wires that are wide enough to encapsulate all of it will make it look less like fat and more like it's part of your boob (which it is!). This is called tissue migration. Sometimes your boobs actually get bigger because a bunch of tissue rejoins the breast, and sometimes your shape just changes when the existing tissue redistributes itself. For some women it doesn't happen at all, but a lot of people have reported it. I had the tissue redistribution kind myself, as I also wore wires that were far too narrow for me prior to coming here.  I think it would be worth it for you to try 30D and 30DD, as you might need the cup width of 30DD. Based on your descriptions of your shape, I think you should check out the shallow guide in the sidebar. It has lots of recommendations for bras to try as well as more specific information about the shallow shape. You can decide if that sounds like your boobs!"

Some people have said that Bravissimo's house brand runs true to size, and others have not, so I'm not totally sure if your bra would be considered stretchier than most.  You may end up liking 34F in bras with firm bands and 32FF in bras with stretchy bands, so depending on the brand you may already have a stretchy one."

Too much space at the top, while the side support panels seem to be cutting into the sides of your breasts. You seem to have short roots (which may be part of why you measure at 30F but tend to fit best in 30DD) so a bra with less coverage above your breasts would be less wrinkly.   I can't tell if it's wired or not but if it is the wire width looks great.  Unfortunately I know very little about Shock Absorber except for that they usually run small. So I'm not sure if another Shock Absorber style would work better. I feel like Panache Sport will be too tall for you, though, as it has tall cups with a lot of room for FoT breasts."
ABraThatFits,3ab1hu,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:58:45 2015 UTC,I just want something supportive and comfortable really. I use it mostly for the gym and gym classes so I need it fairly supportive (running on the treadmill and step classes) and I tend to work out about 3-5 times a week so it gets quite a bit of use. You are definitely right about the shape of the bra! I do have short roots (didn't realise that was why I didn't fit the size I measured as!) and I'm quite projected with immediate projection (? where they come straight out instead of gradually) I think. My breasts are fairly small so they don't necessarily need super strong support in a sports bra but I'd rather get something more supportive and with proper cup sizes rather than the reinforced crop top type things in generic sizes.
ABraThatFits,3ab1hu,noribun,2,Thu Jun 18 22:06:07 2015 UTC,"The multi sport max or active multi sports are the ones most people usually get. They have two clasps on the back and goes up to a UK HH. On those, it depends on which side of the 30 band spectrum that you are on. If you are closer to 28/27in, then I would get the 30DD, but if you are closer to 29/30 (or prefer a less firm band) then I would get the 32D. I have this bra and stuck with the 30G, but I measure closer to a 28GG.  You could try a 30D on this one, but I feel like the way the cups separate on this one gives too much space in the middle for you, and will probably point you east west even in a smaller size. I would definitely try the multi sport max/active multi sports though."
ABraThatFits,3acvi0,trisarahtops05,4,Fri Jun 19 02:07:08 2015 UTC,"It's possible that you may have too much bottom fullness for Comexim, as the plunges are not especially FoB-friendly.

ABraThatFits,3acvi0,crazymusicalgenius96,3,Fri Jun 19 02:37:37 2015 UTC,"I don't really think they're that FOB. I've drawn a not to scale representation of what they look like, my left one has a little bit more bottom fullness, but righty is almost flat on the bottom. Image here.  I also found Lily to be too wide for me, which I think would be exacerbated by going up cup sizes even if I'm going down band sizes."
ABraThatFits,3acvi0,noys,2,Fri Jun 19 02:50:20 2015 UTC,Looking at this I think Ewa Michalak S/SM might be right up your alley.

ABraThatFits,3acvi0,buymeflowers,2,Fri Jun 19 14:14:52 2015 UTC,"Agree with noys, the S could be worth trying, the SM is a bit more hit and miss but could also work, I'd tentatively say try one that doesn't have any embroidery, like Wrozka or Trefl.  You could also bump up a cup in Comexim and order the reduced cups which will take care of the gaping, and a lowered gore.  Empriente bras are verrryyy deep, but also verrryyy expensive. Samanta's 922 cut is super roomy as well, though based on that drawing of yours, you may not have enough bottom fullness for it.   It could be your close-setness that pushes the bra down, rather than the lack of projection. Comexim's gores aren't super stiff. In fact, I wonder if you could keep the same cup size and just order the lowered gore customization, it could potentially work."
ABraThatFits,3acvi0,buymeflowers,2,Fri Jun 19 17:25:32 2015 UTC,"I already need reduced cups in the 70HH, I don't think I could reduce them enough to get away with a 70J. Empreinte doesn't look like it comes anywhere close to my size, unless I went for 34FFUK and hoped for a tighter band. Someone else suggested a Samanta A122 cut for projection. I kind of want to get away from the padded/moulded bras as I can't correctly diagnose my bra issues when the bra is so stiff. Why is SM hit and miss? Is there something that can cause irregularities in the bras or is it just because of the embroidery so many of them have?"
ABraThatFits,3acvi0,C_latroque,2,Fri Jun 19 17:38:57 2015 UTC,"Empriente runs extremely large in the cups and allows for a ton of projection, check out the reviews. I wouldn't necessarily start out by ordering blindly because they are very expensive, but if you can find a brick and mortar store that carries them (they are actually a fairly common brand in lingerie stores) it's worth trying them on.  A122 could potentially work as well, however it's not as deep as A922, I'd probably try 922 first.  SM can struggle with projection at the center gore area, and I do believe it is at least somewhat related to the embroidery. I've gotten more consistent fits in the plain lace ones like Trefl, as opposed to heavily embroidered ones like Burek, Summertime, etc., which have been difficult to pinpoint which size to order. Since the embroidery is done by hand there's a lot of variation in fabric tension, which does seem to shallow the cup out a lot more than the plain SMs."
ABraThatFits,3acvi0,KristinM100,2,Fri Jun 19 17:58:13 2015 UTC,I do have an SM Cukiereczek and it fits great everywhere but for the center gore area in my bigger breast. I am quite center full and in the days when I'm bigger it doesn't have enough space for my inner fullness so I don't know if it would work for her. Maybe you're right and the plain lace ones are different. The gore is nice and low though.
ABraThatFits,3adfub,myhusbandandi1234,5,Fri Jun 19 05:30:26 2015 UTC,"The sunken cups might be because you are too projected for the bra, so your breast pushes up into the deepest part of the cup and it leaves space down at the wire.  This is probably exacerbated by the cup being too small."

I think the too-shallow bottom makes the quadboob worse because you're not able to get into some of the room at the bottom of the cup. Narrow, projected, FoT is a difficult combination to find in UK bras, unfortunately. I have had some success with Panache Jasmine and Floris (neither is quite projected enough for me--the Jasmine is a bit more projected than the Floris--and the gores are too high, but they're both pretty close). Ewa Michalak is better, but I'm bordering on a custom size now in EM, and I'm currently kind of broke."

ABraThatFits,3aaqy1,SadisticYellowBird,4,Thu Jun 18 16:06:46 2015 UTC,"A 34C has the same volume as 32D, 30DD, and 28E. Since you are spilling out of your current bras (and if you are correct in determining your shape, the gapping at the top is probably due to shape mis-match rather than the size), You should probably start with 28F. The leaning measurement is often the most accurate in this size range, and yours does suggest an F-cup (27-34 = 7"" difference). You could also try some bras in 28E and 28FF, just to get an idea of whether any fit issues you have are due to the shape rather than the size (if it seems too big in the cup in one size and too small in the size down, it's just not compatible with your shape). Cleo by Panache Lucy and Kali are commonly recommended ""diagnostic"" bras that often work for full-on-bottom shape. If you are narrow and projected, you could also try Cleo Lily/Erin, which works for a narrow, projected, even shape. I think Freya's unlined balconnettes (look for a three-part cup) would also be a good option to try, as they are often fairly narrow, projected and full-on-bottom friendly. Freya doesn't really work well in my size range, and I'm more full-on-top, so I don't have any specific recommendations there, sorry.  With a 27"" underbust, you should be pretty comfortable in 28 bands, but Cleos do tend to run snug, so you could also try Cleo bras in 30E (the sister-size of 28F) if you like. Before deciding that a band is too tight though, make sure to try it on backwards to ensure that it isn't too-small cups making the band feel too tight. Freya, on the other hand, usually is usually stretchy, so definitely go with a 28 band there."
ABraThatFits,3aaqy1,Shanakitty,2,Thu Jun 18 16:58:47 2015 UTC,"If you can find a Lily, as its discontinued, I'd try it first. I know Amazon has a few 28 band Lilys left, not sure what sizes tho. Lily is becoming sparse.   If you're very FOB, Curvy Kate Bardot is a good one too. You do sound projected. I'd think with a 27"" UB you'd be fine in all 28 bands.

The other complication with wide projected breasts is that they often have short roots, and you need to find cups that are short and projected enough to prevent a lot of extra fabric up top. I have seen this short, wide, projected shape in this size range before, and I think I recommended trying Cleo Lucy in several sizes to see if the person could get the right combo of height, width, and depth.   However I think it turned out that OP actually has the shallow on top, projected on bottom shape, which is served reasonably well by Polish bras in this size range. There's a thread with recommendations for it and most of the ladies agreed that EM worked for them."

If none of the bras she's tried have stayed in her IMF properly, she could have misinterpreted this as needing a ton of immediate projection (would be unusual for wide roots in a 32DD). If it is, in fact, that non of the UK bras have been a compatible wire shape, she would find Comexim and Ewa to fit a lot more comfortably in that regard.  The fact is that neither Ewa or Comexim has above average levels of projection in a 32DD size, though CHP is marginally better in terms of immediate projection (Comexim is actually worse in this size range)."
ABraThatFits,3a8zu1,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:54:38 2015 UTC,"Really? I always thought Comexim plunges stayed super narrow and projected in the smaller sizes. There is hope for me after all! I've been wanting to try one for ages - the construction looks similar enough to my favorite Freya Lauren clone that I think it would work beautifully.  On that note, I really don't know what to recommend to a person in my size range who is truly projected. Curvy Kate unlined balconettes, perhaps? Those have enormous cup depths compared to every other bra in my size on Bratabase, but I feel like that might be caused by the upper section being so open and the lower section being smaller, giving the upside down 7 shape. But even those may be adjusted soon, as Curvy Kate's SS15 offerings are much shallower (and more suited to the classic shallow shape which has a bit more bottom fullness)."
ABraThatFits,3a8zu1,buymeflowers,3,Fri Jun 19 02:45:47 2015 UTC,"Comexim is fairly narrow across the board, but they don't really shine in the narrow/projected department until you get to somewhere around the (EU) H+ range. A quick bratabase comparison in 30DD shows that Comexim's plunge is a tiny bit narrower and far shallower than Marcie and Patsy, when you take all things into consideration (wire length, gore separation, cup construction, etc.)  One thing to keep in mind is that Comexim's are far less likely to succumb to wire distortion. Many bras will measure similarly in the cup depth category, but once you put them on, even in the correct band size, they'll stretch out so much that it renders the original width measurement useless. Comexim's don't experience this phenomenon, as the bands are cut differently than UK bras -- the top of the band is cut longer than the bottom, which means there is little to no tension on the wire tips.  Have you tried a Comexim halfcups yet?  There's very few people I'd suggest old unlined CKs to, especially in this size range. They are deep, but you're correct, all that cup depth is above the apex, and they want a wide, tall, all over projected breast shape which is unlikely to exist in a 32DD. The new CKs are better in that the top and bottom cup are more balanced, but the cups are still pretty tall. Fantasies and Fauves would fit the bill here, but they're not known for the roundest of shapes, so they don't get mentioned often,; though I have seen lovely fits in the Chloe based halfcups, especially in OPs size range."
ABraThatFits,3a8zu1,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:30:32 2015 UTC,"I loved Fantasie Allegra half cup myself; it gave me a beautiful shape and was also a very attractive bra. Unfortunately the band was way too big and it was way out of my budget, but someday I hope to own an unlined half cup like that. (Freya Starlet was a bit too...modern, I guess would be the word I'm looking for. Comexim Coco would be closer to the design I liked so much on Allegra.)"
ABraThatFits,3a8zu1,horkus1,12,Fri Jun 19 08:28:39 2015 UTC,"It is kind of funny that you mention this now. I was just trying to explain to someone how I am projected (and what that means) and I was expressing my surprise how at just how many women there are on ABTF that have shallow breasts. I am, of course, basing that almost entirely on the posts and the responses from the experts. Perhaps there are not that many after all.   So very sorry you are having such a hard time finding bras. It is bad enough when you fit into the matrix but your situation most certainly sucks."
ABraThatFits,3a8zu1,otterhugs,18,Thu Jun 18 04:59:45 2015 UTC,"I think shallow tends to be pushed a lot because if you are shallow its the most clear cut of all the breast shapes as far as which bras to recommend go, so a lot of people like to recommend checking to see if you're shallow first before anything else because it can save a lot of time and effort--except when you're lead to believe you're shallow when you're not in which case it leads to a lot of EXTRA effort. I think perhaps people should be more conscious of not saying things like ""most women in your size range are shallow, so its likely you're shallow too"" and instead saying things like ""check the shallow shape guide and see if it applies to you, if it does we have a great shallow breast resource and it can make it a lot easier to find bras"" even though from what I've seen it seems  true that a lot of women with small bands/small cups seem to be shallow, they definitely aren't all shallow and assuming that they will be due to their size can lead them through a very difficult and frustrating bra fitting journey."
ABraThatFits,3a8zu1,M_tridactyla,7,Thu Jun 18 05:26:02 2015 UTC,"I agree! I will try to take this advice on board and remember to ask more about shape characteristics before recommending shallow bras.  Mostly I talk about potential shallowness if a poster is in the commonly shallow size range because a lot of beginners don't include much information on shape in their posts.  If they are shallow but have tried on projected bras, I worry that they will think that they ""don't fit that cupsize"" due to shape mismatch and might go on thinking that the ABTF method doesn't work.  Also, learning about shallowness and wide roots was a miracle revelation to me so I bravangelize about it."

Because you started out a 36B ie a ""small"" cup size, and then went initially to 32F, it would be highly likely you WERE shallow.  The fact that you're actually a 32DD makes it less likely you're shallow, but trying on some bras in 32F including shallow is probably the only way to work that out.  DId you post a full measurement check and fit checks?  Often if you come on with just 36B->32F you'll get a lot of responses that you're likely shallow, the five measurements can help break that down (the larger the difference in bust measurements the less likely you are to be shallow, though not a direct correlation).  If it makes you feel better I tried on well over 100 bras to get a decent fit partly because I got only a couple of responses to a couple of fit checks where non-experts (before the expert flair was added) said I was narrow and projected, and that was from actual fit check photos!"
ABraThatFits,3a8zu1,I_Love_Colors,2,Thu Jun 18 10:13:20 2015 UTC,"Can you really determine likeliness of shallowness from measurements? Because I was also wearing 36B and measured 32F (though after experimentation I tend toward 32E more often), and I don't think my breasts are shallow (well, I have tall roots that are shallow, but the bulk of my tissue seems quite projected). I've seen people post on here with similar measurements (something like 31, 29.5, 37 36 38) who are shallow, and the difference is evident because their breasts look nothing like mine - even in the same or very similar sized bras.  I guess I'm not understanding the relevance of the starting size - it was the wrong size, that's why we're here. And I don't fully understand the reasoning of small measurement differences = more likely to be shallow. I could see small differences correlating to firmer breast tissue - is firmer tissue also most likely to be shallow?

So the OP has narrow to medium roots, making them moderately projected, but tall roots which also keeps the moderately projected, and FOB.  A tall root IS by definition shallower than a short root, we just need to know overall breast shape too ie FOB/FOT?  Again, pedantics/semantics, but talking about upper breasts that are shallow, tall fullish roots etc is just damned confusing."

ABraThatFits,3a8zu1,onemoreboobthrowaway,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:25:23 2015 UTC,"How projected are you? I'm another tall/projected combo (32FF when I tried it, shallow upper fullness, medium projection overall) and the stretch lace does work well for tall roots, but I wasn't super happy with the overall shape. The apex was too projected for me and I have a bit of a tendency to conicalness anyway, so it looked pointy in a way I didn't like. And bear in mind it's one of the narrower British bras in this size range. If you're narrowish and more projected than me, it's worth a try. Also maybe Envy?"
ABraThatFits,3a8zu1,joanna70,3,Fri Jun 19 11:29:45 2015 UTC,"Because the shallower you are the smaller the cup letter you tend to be in originally as shallow boobs are ""stealth"" boobs that look small - I was in a 36B yet a 30F/FF at the time.  Someone with a projected 30F correctly fitted was more likely in a 34D or similar before.  Smaller differences between bust measurements is indeed shallow or firm tissue, hence saying you're more likely to be shallow.  People see that kind of language and read it wrongly, it's not saying they're definitely shallow.  It's all statistics and probability which is the only way to get a starting point.  Your tall roots mean you're only moderately projected, hence you have 2"" between your measurements which would be a good average overall and for moderate projection, so it kind of proves the point."
ABraThatFits,3a8zu1,buymeflowers,7,Thu Jun 18 15:50:24 2015 UTC,"Comexim and Ewa, which = more expensive   Have you actually tried ordering from Comexim? Its maybe.. 5 dollars more than a Cleo bra on clearance from Amazon, and that includes shipping. You can get Basic plunge delivered for less than $40.00, which is about 10 bucks cheaper than most VS bras in your size range (VS charges more for models that have DD+ cups, such as the Angels collection).  More expensive than off the rack at target, (which is questionable quality at best) yes, but consider that you're getting a hand made bra that is completely customizable at no additional charge, delivered from Europe, and it's an absolute steal."
ABraThatFits,3a8zu1,serenissima_regina,3,Thu Jun 18 23:43:18 2015 UTC,"Small band + small bust + wide roots + average projection   Kind of sounds like me - I am even but I started out thinking I was super shallow because I thought of myself as ""100% flat."" I think I'm even your sister size since I'm 28E/F (sometimes 26F/FF or 30DD/DDD).  I'd say that I've encountered a pretty wide range of projected, even, and shallow bras in my size, even among the fairly available US/UK brands. If you'd list the ones you've tried and found too shallow, maybe I can tell you which ones might work? Panache (not Cleo) tends to be projected, and some are good for wider roots. Again, it's hard to help if I don't know what doesn't work.  I'm going to reiterate what some people below said, and consider the possibility that you're a 32E or maybe 32F. (Often the easiest way to get a wider cup and more projection is to go up a size.) Sometimes bras seem huge because some brands tend to scale cup heights drastically with cup size, and that can look bizarre. For example Natori 30DDD cups are too small/shallow for me, but the cups come up to my collarbone, so it looks too big at the same time. I've been pretty happy with Parfait bras, where I can size up if needed without being eaten alive by my bra.  Amazon carries a wide range of American, UK, and French brands and has free shipping and returns, and both are super fast if you have Prime (I have student Prime). Near the beginning of my ""bra journey"" I had to return a bunch of bras, and most of them were refunded the moment I printed the return slip, even before I posted it. From what I understand ShopRunner also has a similar arrangement with a bunch of other retailers, like Bare Necessities and such. You can find a bunch of NWT bras on eBay from liquidators, as well.  I'd encourage you to explore those options first, because from my research, Comexim and Ewa seem to be hit-or-miss with smaller busts. I'll regularly see people selling their bras because it fit multiple sizes larger or smaller than what they expected. I'm not sure I've seen anything overwhelmingly positive, fit-wise, from smaller busted people. Iirc both companies became known for good fit and grading and lift in the larger end spectrum. Smaller people eventually wanted in because a) they are pretty, and b) they were willing to customize 26 in bands.  Unless you're really into one of the Ewa or Comexim designs, I'd post here linking what you have tried, and asking about what models are more projected."
ABraThatFits,3a8zu1,Goddess_Keira,2,Fri Jun 19 02:31:44 2015 UTC,"I admit to being confused as well. I would think that at 32DD there should be some bras that fit your shape and are available in department stores, whether that be Gilligan & O'Malley from Target or various brands available at the likes of Nordstrom, Macy's, or Dillard's. I would think you could get a fit in widely available brands like Betsey Johnson, Wacoal, Wacoal b.tempt'd, Natori, Calvin Klein, etc."
ABraThatFits,3a8zu1,M_tridactyla,2,Thu Jun 18 18:02:53 2015 UTC,I wish it were that easy. We have no Macy's or Nordstom's. Target's are not projected enough and most of the bands are loose. Not to mention the selection is very limted for my size online and in-store for both Dillard's and Target.
ABraThatFits,3aackq,Angeldown,6,Thu Jun 18 14:13:44 2015 UTC,"I think I'd start with 30F or so in UK brands and adjust from there, 28s can run very snug. No US company makes 28 bands as far as I know, so I wouldn't worry about the accuracy of your conversion. US companies can make F cups (they might call them G, though), but I think you will have a hard time finding them paired with smaller bands. It is just easier to search for UK brands in my opinion, as there are usually more choices and less confusion compared to other sizing systems.  I would also say to give underwires another shot. Many people find them uncomfortable just because they are wearing a bra that doesn't suit their size or shape (which is really important). Perhaps the Cleo Marcie? Other users might have better suggestions, though."

It sucks that I wouldn't be able to find much of this size in the US. I have some free time this evening and was going to walk around the mall and see if I could find anything. I suppose that won't be a very fruitful search, but I might walk around anyway just for the hell of it.  I will go look at Cleo Marcie now, and will surely try underwire again now that I have a better idea of my size :)"

You may want to go for a 28E or 30DD though as they do sometimes come up small...but sizing can different between colours too, making it even more confusing.

ABraThatFits,3aapa9,brafittingaccount,4,Thu Jun 18 15:55:18 2015 UTC,"The shape you're getting in this is quite good! But if it's digging into your armpits then that's a no go, obviously!  I looked at a few of your previous checks. You appear to be a very FoB shape, like a 1/5-6. Since you like fuller coverage, need ample room in the bottom of the cup, and we want to avoid that uncomfortable arm cutting (I hate that!), I'd suggest giving Panache Clara a shot. It's a 4 part balconette which behaves very similarly to a full cup bra, the straps are positioned further in on the cups, and the top of the cup is stretch lace to prevent gaping."
ABraThatFits,3aapa9,buymeflowers,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:58:13 2015 UTC,"That sounds great, and it's available with Amazon Prime in my size range!

Thanks for the help!"
ABraThatFits,3aapa9,buymeflowers,5,Thu Jun 18 17:09:48 2015 UTC,"I'd try both, actually, Clara isn't as deep as Lily, but it is roomier than Jewel. Really, any time you try a new bra, it's worth it to get multiple sizes if returns are free, there's really no downside to trying both, and having the same bra in two different cup volumes can offer a lot of insight into your shape."
ABraThatFits,3aa3wn,fitandhealthy,5,Thu Jun 18 12:54:10 2015 UTC,"So, based on your measurements (especially your three bust measurements) and the bras that worked for you, I'm guessing you have and average to widish root, fairly even shape to slightly fuller on top, not too projected. Your roots might be on the tall side because Marcie works for you, but on the other hand, Neve usually cuts into tall roots--this may be happening for you, but not so much that it's a significant fit issue. I can't be 100% sure, but that's the impression I have."
ABraThatFits,3aa3wn,Goddess_Keira,3,Thu Jun 18 17:26:16 2015 UTC,"There's a shape guide on the sidebar that will help with determining the answers to your questions. I really discovered my shape mostly by cupping my breasts and seeing how the looked and what pictures I matched to. Leaning over and looking at my roots informed me that I was narrow rooted, holding them in front of me helped me discover that they were pretty much even, and the same cupping helped me realize they were very immediately projected. Basically the guides are great but feeling and getting to know your breasts can be the missing link, more so than measurements."

ABraThatFits,3aa0g5,86claz,8,Thu Jun 18 12:20:22 2015 UTC,"I think the bra moves down because the cups are too small. I would say you're even in shape, averagely projected, and your roots are tall and averagely wide/narrow. You'll probably fit in most Cleo balconnettes (Lucy, Marcie, etc.)."
ABraThatFits,3aa0g5,khasiv,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:12:09 2015 UTC,Thank you for your input! You may have misunderstood what I was trying to say at the end of my post. The wires of this bra aren't moving down out of my IMF despite the cups being too small. It's other bras I've tried recently that I'm having this problem with. (Berlei barely there and Panache Porcelain to name the worst offenders) I was wondering what was the cause of this. As joanna points out in her reply I need to compare the measurements of the bras in question for a start.   Thanks for your assessment on my shape. I was told my breasts have a shallow shape and have been recommended bras that are shallow. As I'm yet to find one that fits well so I'm thinking I'm not as shallow as I was originally told so would tend to agree with you :-)   I've previously tried Cleo Lucy which didn't work due to the wires sitting on breast tissue at the gore and gaping at the top of the cup. Haven't been able to track down a reasonably priced Marcie with free returns yet.   Thanks again!
ABraThatFits,3aa0g5,joanna70,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:15:28 2015 UTC,"You'd really need to compare the bras, compare underwire width first, you may have your answer straight away.  If this bra's underwires aren't wider than the others then it must be lower projection, because the cup is big enough so it's not that (I think khasiv thinks this bra is riding down).  This bra looks too small as you say, and possibly too closed on top, you may have a taller root than this bra can cope with or are more FOT.  Have you tried the leaning test to see if you are FOT etc (nipples point towards your knees if you lean forwards 90 degree)?"
ABraThatFits,3aa0g5,joanna70,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:25:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply! I've done a bit of research and the wires the two bras I had the most trouble with (Berlei barely there and Panache Porcelain) have wire widths of 6"" and 5.5"" respectively. So one a little wider and one the same. I also have a Freya Patsy which I altered to be more closed on top which I have the same problem with to a lesser extent. The wires on that bra are 5.75"". (Bratabase says 5"" but my measurements are different) So it would seem that lack of lower projection could be the problem.   I have tried the leaning test. My nipples point straight to the floor."

I'd probably put it on the wider side, but only slightly. Does it feel like it's pressing on breast tissue?  I agree with the tall roots assessment, and if the wires of this bra aren't pressing on your tissue at all, I think you'd do well in Masquerade halfcups."
ABraThatFits,3a8gi2,lishbish,104,Thu Jun 18 01:32:54 2015 UTC,"Plastic surgeons don't work in bra sizes, they work in CCs which is volume. Many different bra sizes have the same volume, as you can see from this chart (I have no idea if the CC measurements listed on that chart are what most plastic surgeons use but the point is a 32B is the same volume as a 34A and a 30C). So when your surgeon says a C cup, he's guessing based on how many CCs he thinks your breasts are currently, how many CCs he's planning on removing, and how many CCs he thinks a C cup is.  Even if plastic surgeons did work in bra sizes, most people don't have an accurate conception of what different cup sizes look like, which is one of the reasons most women are wearing the wrong bra size. So the plastic surgeon would still not be giving you an accurate estimation of what your new size will be.   The surgeon probably wants to bring you to what he calls a C cup because he thinks that's the smallest cup size that would still look proportional on you, but he also might not be able to go smaller depending on the cuts he's using and whether or not you're having a nipple graft. Be sure to communicate very clearly and effectively with your surgeon what size you want before you go under and listen to his reasoning for planning to bring you down to a C cup. Bring pictures of breasts that are around the size you want on people close to your band size so you can be sure you and your surgeon are talking about the same volume of breast."

Even once you're in the right size fitters can put you in the wrong width wires, the wrong height wires, and even the wrong shape (not many people need specific shaped wires but it can be an issue).  Then did you know you can bend the wires to wrap around your body?  From watching posts on here for over 2 years it seems to be that the vast majority of people who truly can't get on with wires have a medical condition, the rest just need a better fit.  A wireless bra isn't any more of a problem than a wired bra if it fits correctly, and has no underwire in the wrong place to really push your boobs around, so can be safer.  Of course it doesn't give the same shape or lift as an underwire but if you're happy with that side of things then no problem!"
ABraThatFits,3a9pa7,joanna70,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:19:46 2015 UTC,"There might be a slight possibility that it is the bad fit, but really all the wired bras I have look really good on me, they fit perfectly, they just dont feel good, if it makes any sense.. I've always had a very sensitive skin - I can't stand wool, polyester, all those annoying tags on the inside of my clothes etc. And I'm really skinny under my breast, there's no fat to protect me from the wires lol  I'm ok with the way my breasts look in the wire-free bras, it's not great, but it's good enough. I'm just afraid that if I'm gonna keep wearing only those with occasional wired bras my bust is gonna look really 'sad' in a few years although it's small.."
ABraThatFits,3a9pa7,Goddess_Keira,6,Thu Jun 18 10:42:39 2015 UTC,"I am the same, cashmere makes me itch and I cut most labels out of clothes!  You have nothing to lose by fitting yourself, I was a 30F I believe for most of my adult life yet was fitted by probably the best bra store in the world (Rigby & Peller) into a 34D which was ALL the wrong shape for me as well as the wrong size.  Uncomfy isn't the word.  If it's not pretty comfy (some aspects of correct fitting bras take a little getting used to) then it's not a perfect fit."
ABraThatFits,3a9pa7,stinkylittleone,4,Thu Jun 18 10:46:25 2015 UTC,"If you prefer wireless, it isn't a problem IMO. It's theoretically possible that wearing a well-fitted underwire bra most days could alleviate some degree of ""sagginess"" in a woman's breasts over the course of a lifetime. The problem with that hypothesis, though, is that there are so, so  many other factors than can potentially influence what happens to your breasts over that same lifetime: genetics, aging, your breast size and shape, rate of development, number and spacing of pregnancies, the age you first gave birth, breastfeeding, how much weight is gained and lost with each pregnancy, weight gain and/or loss other than pregnancy-related, natural hormonal fluctuations, artificial hormonal fluctuations (e.g., birth control), certain medications that a woman may need to be on...the list is very long and all of these things have the potential to affect breast changes far more than what bra you wear. Nobody can arrange her whole life around what's most likely to keep her breasts looking perky! That would be pathological. So wear the bras you like and don't stress about it. If you want to revisit underwire bras, or wear a mix of the two, that's fine too, of course. Do what makes you feel the best."

ABraThatFits,3a9pa7,stinkylittleone,3,Fri Jun 19 00:23:59 2015 UTC,"The point about bending the wires is a great one - I had one bra in particular that always poked me in the armpits, but when I bent the wires to wrap more naturally around my torso it was suddenly completely comfortable. I mention this because it was a surprise to me - I would have expected the pressure to be in a different place if that were the solution. I just tried it as a last-ditch effort and was very pleased.  It sounds like the problem for you may have more to do with sensitive skin, but it's still worth a shot! Worst thing that happens is you bend up a bra you didn't like.  And if you're sticking with wire-free but are concerned about support, check out nursing bras. They NEVER have underwires (since the breast needs room to change throughout the day), but have to support the heaviest boobs. Brands like Royce and Elle MacPherson do amazing things with just seaming, and they also have a lot of cute styles now. Good luck!"
ABraThatFits,3a9pa7,bigcitylights1,2,Thu Jun 18 16:49:02 2015 UTC,Is there some special way for me to bend wires? I've wrestled with a few of mine in the past and couldn't get them to bend. :(

ABraThatFits,3a9cka,geekydoctorgirl,2,Thu Jun 18 06:56:27 2015 UTC,"I think a 34F UK sounds like a good place to start. There are some US brands that make this size (they would usually call it a 34G), but you'll likely have more options if you expand your search for UK brands as well. I would recommend taking a look at the shape guide, as it is a big part of finding a bra that fits well."
ABraThatFits,3a9cka,SmellsLikeDogBuns,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:08:46 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. Thanks for the response, btw. I've been checking out the different guides here and plan on going to department stores to try on different sizes in this range. So far, based on the very limited selections available in the stores I've gone to so far, the 34 band seems a little too tight and it creates unsightly bulges of back fat. So I'm going to try finding a bra in the sister size with a 36 band to see how that fits.  I tried a 36DD sports bra in Victoria's Secret and the cups seemed like it might be too big, but it was hard to tell whether or not there was space leftover."
ABraThatFits,3a9cka,SmellsLikeDogBuns,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:00:33 2015 UTC,"A sister size to 34F is UK 36E, which some US brands will label as 36DDD. I think VS carries this size but many of their bras tend to be shallow and wide with veeeeery stretchy bands, so they might not work out well regardless depending on your shape.  It also depends on what size cups you've been trying on in the 34s, trying too-small cups can screw with assessing the band. If you go back to do more shopping anytime soon, you can try them like this."
ABraThatFits,3a82ya,Igenerallydunno,6,Wed Jun 17 23:32:49 2015 UTC,"To start out with trying a 50 band, I believe you'll be limited to Goddess and Elila as brands (someone plase correct me if I'm wrong). Both Goddess and Elila use US sizing, and so to get the 7th and 8th cup sizes, you'd be looking at G and H cup. If you're in the US, both brands have a few styles on Amazon which are Prime eligible (and free shiping and returns is great when you're starting out as most ladies have to try out a few bras before they get one which works really well). Depending on the age of your current bras, as you've been wearing a 42B which is theoretically designed for a 44"" bust circumference, you may find that you're comfortable in a smaller band, which opens up a few more brand options.  You may find it takes a bit of trial and error to get a bra which works well for your wide-set breasts and shallow shape, as most bras in your size range have been scaled from a smaller band with a larger cup, making them deep and close-set, but if you need some extra help and advice, you're very welcome to post a fit check or contact one of the listed experts in the side bar."
ABraThatFits,3a82ya,hilbertisoutofspace,3,Thu Jun 18 01:12:46 2015 UTC,"Glamorise makes some styles to 50 band and beyond in G and H cup US, and Elomi Caitlyn in wire free comes to a 48G UK."
ABraThatFits,3a82ya,Goddess_Keira,3,Thu Jun 18 02:34:36 2015 UTC,"In addition to the brands suggested by /u/hilbertisoutofspace, Glamorise makes some styles in your size range. That's in U.S sizes like Goddess and Elila. Also Elomi has their basic Caitlyn in a wire free version up to size 48G, that's in UK sizes. Cacique goes up to a 50 band in some styles but I believe only to DDD cup. That is a UK E, so possibly, if you're finding that the calculator overestimated your cup size, they might have something to fit you."
ABraThatFits,3a82ya,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:39:56 2015 UTC,I just checked Lane Bryant's website and you're right - they only offer up to a DDD in both 50 and 48 bands.
ABraThatFits,3a82ya,hurrrrrmione,4,Thu Jun 18 04:38:29 2015 UTC,"More bra problems would include constant riding up from every angle, cups actually puckering and folding into weird shapes when I wear them, spilling out of the bottom, cups that were way snug all around but there was enough room in the front for me to keep my phone in, and no underwire bra has ever actually rested under and around anything --always on top of my actual boob or like between a couple of ribs half an inch to an inch below them.   That's all an indication that the bras are too small. The cups puckering could also be a shape mismatch.  Do you think your breasts are projected or shallow?"
ABraThatFits,3a82ya,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:47:24 2015 UTC,"After looking all of that over, I'd say shallow? And as for the narrow or broad root part, I'm not sure I can tell the difference but I think I'd lean more towards narrow."
ABraThatFits,3a7djh,piefitcheck,5,Wed Jun 17 20:23:36 2015 UTC,"I bought the balconette for that great price, too! I definitely agree that the band runs firm; I'm starting to move from a 34 down to a 32 (I've lost some weight and most of my 34s can be worn on the tightest hook) and I needed an extender with Loretta in a 32HH. I also agree about the immediate projection; I need a fair amount of it and I think Loretta worked well for me in that regard.  I found the wires to be pretty medium in terms of width. I generally seem to be even to slightly full on top (both Marcie and Lily/Erin cuts work for me) and I'm not sure the Loretta balconette would work for someone who is truly full on top, but it does overall work for me.  The reason I didn't consider getting the plunge version is because I tried it a while back via Zulily and it is an absolute no for anyone who is close set and has softer tissue. There was simply no way for me to wear it without falling out in the middle."
ABraThatFits,3a7djh,atheologist,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:42:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you for sharing your experience!  Interestingly, I have very soft tissue and can usually never wear plunges. This was the first time a plunge worked for me, which made me think it definitely had space at the gore. I am wide set though, so perhaps that makes all the difference. However, I was under the impression that close-set people do well with plunges, because the gore is lower and allow the breasts to touch more."
ABraThatFits,3a7djh,atheologist,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:56:58 2015 UTC,"You're right that plunges are often recommended for people who are close set because of the issue with gores being too wide to tack, but I've found that they very rarely work for me. I think it's the close set combined with soft tissue. My usual MO is to try to get the gore to bend into a V shape. it means that the wires are slightly on the tissue, but not so much so that I've had any problems."

ABraThatFits,3a7djh,hurrrrrmione,2,Thu Jun 18 23:23:17 2015 UTC,"I dislike how the top panel of the balconnet goes straight across from wire to wire. I think it makes the breasts go a little more east-west,   This is actually the definition of a full cup construction (why they call Loretta a balconette I will never know). It tends to give a less rounded shape than true balconette, but can be very, very comfy to wear.  I tried Loretta way back in the day (I am one of those darker skinned girls who is in an endless search for an actual ""nude"" bra). That top panel cut into my tall roots, so it was a no go, and I felt like the fabric was a bit cheap and scratchy, so it's always one that I've actually tried to steer women away from, as I felt like it was poorly designed. It does look better on you, though your short roots aren't really compatible either. Seems like it's going to be a hard bra to fit. How do you find the fabric quality?"
ABraThatFits,3a7djh,LordLeesa,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:22:37 2015 UTC,"Oh ok! Now I know I don't like full cup then.  The fabric definitely feels scratchy and stiff, but I feel like it will soften up with wear. The wires are also very firm. And for $14 on amazon prime, I still feel like it's a good option to suggest to people who want to build up their bra collection. Amazon makes it so easy to return if it doesn't work out, and it's such a small upfront cost, that I think it should be suggested. I do want to narrow down the exact shape we should suggest it to, though.  Why do you feel like my short roots aren't compatible? I have been told that while I have mostly short roots, I also have a thin layer of boob going up quite high, so I have short roots combined with tall thin roots. Maybe that's why it's not working, in your eyes? Even so, I feel like it has a pretty good shape, but perhaps I am too FOB because my nipples end up in the sheer upper panel."
ABraThatFits,3a7djh,EmmaInFrance,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:58:59 2015 UTC,Would you be able to do me a huge favor and take a measurement on the plunge styles? I think the plunge might work for me but I wanted to check something that isn't a measurement Bratabase takes.
ABraThatFits,3a7djh,lcl0706,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:54:18 2015 UTC,"I got the plunge; the band is really tight, to the point where I couldn't wait to get it off at the end of the day.  With shoulder strap adjustment, the underwire stays where it's supposed to, but honestly the cup size is a little small too...overall, I think this bra runs small.  However, I'm probably going to keep it because I need something that I can wear under my v-necked tops. :)  It's very pretty to look at, just not nearly as comfortable and easy-to-fit as my two other 34GG bras (Elomi Lexi and Elomi Renee)."
ABraThatFits,3a7djh,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:17:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, I definitely found the band tight too. Did you try it with an extender?   I thought that the cups run a little large, but it may be a size difference. I think sometimes brands switch it up between the G/GG cup. On the other hand, your tight band could have been pulling the cups shallower and that might made it feel smaller."
ABraThatFits,3a7djh,lcl0706,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:47:37 2015 UTC,"Elomi bands tend to be on the generous side - I can wear a 36 band comfortably even though my BTT measurement is 37"". I have also found that I need to go up a cup size in Panache bras."
ABraThatFits,3a8j69,bigbaypony,10,Thu Jun 18 01:55:42 2015 UTC,"You're not mad, the sticker shock is very normal! My GF has had nearly the exact same change as you (going from 34A to 32DD) and we burst out laughing when the calculator said 32DD. We then went shopping and tried 32DDs (I have a feeling that she actually just wanted to prove the calculator wrong) but they really did fit well!   She had the same problems as you - she couldn't fill the cups of the 34As, which makes it seem ridiculous that you would need an even bigger cup. But the wires on her 34As were way too narrow, and all they were doing was squashing her boobs down. After swooping and scooping in the correct size cup, all that tissue that was being squashed and pushed out of the cup was actually able to sit in the cup properly and hey presto - better looking and more comfortable bras!  The biggest thing is to remember to swoop and scoop and to take into account the extra tissue you will gain in the cup from doing it. Many women who go up 4 or 5 cup sizes don't believe it at first, but you have to remember to allow for that extra tissue you're getting from swooping and scooping, which you've never had in the cup before. This can often account for an increase of 2 cup sizes on its own.  If you're still having doubts, check out this link to the Bra Band Project, where women are wearing correct fitting 32Ds.  http://www.brabandproject.com/gallery/search?band=32&cup=D&age=&brand=&sister_sizes=0&search=Search Does this look similar to your size at all?

ABraThatFits,3a8j69,noys,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:13:22 2015 UTC,"I don't have any wrinkling in the bottom of the cups but I'd probably attribute that mostly to the fact that nearly every bra I own or wear is so stiff/padded that there's not any fabric that's given a chance to wrinkle.   I usually have an issue with the underwire riding up too high, which I first thought was because my straps were too tight but then when they were loosened, the straps essentially fell off my arms. So now I  have my straps adjusted to the correct snugness but have to deal with doing the ""cup shuffle"" where I'll hook my fingers underneath the underwire, do a quick shuffle to get them pulled back down underneath my breast tissue, and go on with my day. Which obviously is a fit issue but I've just been dealing with it."
ABraThatFits,3a8j69,cathellsky,3,Thu Jun 18 12:14:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the band is too loose if they ride up like that. A 34 band will stretch to about 34"", that's almost as big as your bust measurement. No wonder it won't stay put under your breasts, if you tighten the straps it will just end up on your breasts!"
ABraThatFits,3a8pko,karleenamarx,7,Thu Jun 18 02:51:50 2015 UTC,"A band that's significantly longer than your underbust can feel snug because you've got breast tissue underneath the band rather than actually in the cups. It's possible that the calculator may have underestimated for you the first time, as you liked the way 34C felt, and you would like 30DD/32D better instead. Without all 5 measurements, it's hard to confirm this.  And bands can leave marks even if they're too big. I used to wear 32A, and even though the band is six inches longer than my underbust it still left the same red marks my well-fitting ones do. Even my mom's ancient stretched out 34Bs, which are probably 36 or 37"" long at this point, still left a couple marks. So it depends on your skin more than anything else, I think."
ABraThatFits,3a8pko,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Thu Jun 18 03:11:45 2015 UTC,"Ok, so the marks left aren't an accurate measure of fit. Definitely something to keep in mind, thanks."
ABraThatFits,3a8pko,SmellsLikeDogBuns,2,Thu Jun 18 03:48:14 2015 UTC,"My thoughts:    The calculator can sometimes be overzealous with undersizing for people in certain ranges, which is why I think people should post measurement checks after using the calculator. A too-small cup can make the band feel tight. Not all bras of the same labelled size are made consistently, and that's why people tend to have a variety of sizes.  Everyone has different comfort levels. Many people are uncomfortable in what conventional/VS-sizing puts them in, so that's where the sub steps in. If you find something you feel is comfortable and flattering, that is what you should wear, even if the size on the tag isn't 'correct.'"

ABraThatFits,3a8pko,MutantToenail,-2,Thu Jun 18 03:49:34 2015 UTC,"I have comment about VS and their bands that might be helpful as well.   I have to buy VS bras right now because I have their store credit card and I need to leave my other credit cards open for more important things. Because of this, I have become very, very familiar with a couple of their lines and I have tried to take notes on things that don't fit so I know what to avoid the next time. These notes often include measuring and I can tell you that I have only seen one bra that actually measures anywhere close to what it should. In fact, I measured a 32DDD yesterday and found that band was only 26"" long. (!!) Even when I pulled it as far as it would go, it was still only about 30"". Their bands are the poster children for vanity sizing. My size is 32"" but I have learned that I will pretty much always have to go to a 34 to wear their bras without strangling my ribcage.   As others have said, your cups may be too small and that is something to consider but I can almost guarantee that the band is not the size that it should be.   EDIT: Again with the grammar."

GUYS - LISTEN UP - THIS IS HOW I DEAL WITH EWA'S INCONSISTENCIES -  IF YOUR EWA BRAS DON'T FIT THEN IT'S CHEAPER TO LITERALLY SELL THEM TO SOMEONE ELSE THAN TO LOSE MORE MONEY VIA SHIPPING. PEOPLE SNAP THEM UP LIKE IT'S NO TOMORROW!  I've bought 9 bras from her since March. I've kept 1 x 30G CHP, 2 X 30FF CHP, 2 x 30FF S cuts. So only 5/9 I've kept.   The others I sold pretty much instantly on braswap. 1 x 30G that was tight enough but did nothing, 1 x slowianki that was clearly meant for a 24-26"" ribcage, 1 x Nostalgia that was way too loose and 1 x lawenda that just didn't fit right (straps way too long).  Best to bulk-order if you can if you're outside Europe and then sell to others in your continent that perhaps don't want to risk buying from her or only want 1 bra.  Also, I'm happy to add any bras you want onto my upcoming orders and ship them to you :D"

ABraThatFits,3a805x,Sykoyo,3,Wed Jun 17 23:11:07 2015 UTC,"38DD does seem like a good place to start from your measurements.  Have you looked at the shallow shape guide in the sidebar?  Do you get ""side fat""? Do you scoop & swoop?"
ABraThatFits,3a805x,noys,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:38:22 2015 UTC,I don't really get side fat.  I do scoop and swoop and I keep having to redo it throughout the day.  I'm looking at the shallow guide now.  So basically I should try something in the range of 38DD that are most likely to work for shallow breasts?
ABraThatFits,3a805x,noys,2,Thu Jun 18 11:32:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, wider underwires and a less projected apex of the cup, some VS demis should work if you like the brand.  You may have to redo s&s because VS bras are stretchier than average, and of course if the underwires are too narrow breast tissue won't want to stay in the cup.  Also try 36DD and 38D. Target has cheap Gilligan & O'Malley demi bras that are good for shallow-shaped breasts."
ABraThatFits,3a7gz1,princess_mombi,2,Wed Jun 17 20:48:23 2015 UTC,"I don't know that there are any true plunge nursing bras, although if you find a plunge bra you like you can convert it into a nursing bra--there are tutorials linked on the sidebar here.   Cake lingerie makes nursing bras with underwire and there is also the Elomi Smoothing nursing bra with underwire. Elomi is in UK sizes; I'm not sure about the conversion with Cake. For non-underwire, there's Elomi Beatrice, Panache Sophie, and Freya Dotty in UK sizes and Goddess Keira (non-wired nursing version) in US sizes. However, if you want it only for sleeping and nighttime feeding, you may prefer something like the Genie bra or similar; i.e. those front-close leisure bras that are made to just lounge around or sleep in, more to contain the girls than to give support."
ABraThatFits,3a7gz1,Goddess_Keira,2,Wed Jun 17 22:08:03 2015 UTC,"The only plunge nursing bra I'm coming up with is an Ewa Michalak which you would have to order from Poland, so you'd probably be better off starting with stuff you can easily return. Given the lack of selection in this size range you may want to convert a regular bra into a nursing bra as Goddess_Keira mentioned. It's not too complicated and it is sort of reversible.  You'll probably want to remeasure once your milk comes in and maybe just get something fairly cheap to wear until then. Since you mention Lane Bryant I assume you're in the US so I would suggest Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, and Amazon. Dillards is worth a try too if you're in a part of the country that has them."
ABraThatFits,3a7gz1,drawingdwarf,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:08:57 2015 UTC,"Panache makes a great nursing bra.  They don't have padding, but the lace hides the nipples.  They are really easy to clip on and off, but very secure while clipped.  I had friends with cheaper bras that would un-clip if they leaned over too far.  You can find them on Amazon.com or find a local retailer who can measure you for a precise fit.  The boutique that I used is trained to measure for pregnancy/delivery cross-over, so they gave me a size that was just a little looser than normal for when my milk came in.  http://www.panache-lingerie.com/_1/products/details/panache/sophie-maternity/nursing-bra/a  I would totally recommend getting a nursing camisole to wear around the house, too.  You can find those in many department stores."
ABraThatFits,3a6b23,brahelp24,23,Wed Jun 17 15:53:08 2015 UTC,I think being narrow and projected means there's much less scooping (I've mentioned before that I don't scoop) but the swoop is important.   Putting the wires in my IMF properly is the most important when you're projected.

ABraThatFits,3a6b23,kezza596,8,Wed Jun 17 22:26:39 2015 UTC,"I don't have to swoop and scoop as much as I used to. When I got my first well-fitting bra, I swooped and scooped 2-3 times a day because tissue migration was happening and I was trying to get the tissue that had squished its way into my armpits to stay in the cups. Now I just swoop and scoop once in the morning and I'm good to go all day. It definitely seems like I have less to scoop because all the tissue has redistributed itself more towards the inner part of the cup.  I do have to shove the underwires right up into the IMF, as my breasts aren't totally self-supporting. That's an important part of the swoop and scoop process. Even if you aren't scooping from the sides, do you still adjust your wires?"
ABraThatFits,3a6b23,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Wed Jun 17 16:04:53 2015 UTC,"Tissue migration never occurred for me because I didn't have breast tissues anywhere else besides my breasts to begin with.  The wires fall into the proper position for me pretty much immediately, but I do adjust if need be."
ABraThatFits,3a6b23,stormy381,3,Wed Jun 17 17:21:21 2015 UTC,A friend of mine has shallow breasts and s&s does nothing for her! I think it depends on your breast shape and how your tissue is distributed.   Personally if I don't swoop n scoop nothing will fit properly.

ABraThatFits,3a6b23,horkus1,2,Wed Jun 17 17:22:33 2015 UTC,I feel like root-width must come into play as I have very wide roots and need to pull all my tissue into the cups.
ABraThatFits,3a6b23,lcl0706,3,Wed Jun 17 18:27:55 2015 UTC,Before my tissue migrated I needed to s&s. I still do it just to get the wires into my IMF but there is nothing left on the sides to swoop now. I have narrow roots with considerable projection.
ABraThatFits,3a6b23,Lyannis,3,Wed Jun 17 19:19:22 2015 UTC,Same here.  I don't have much to scoop in on the sides.  But I always lean over and make sure my wires are way up into my IMF.

ABraThatFits,3a6b23,mailiana,2,Wed Jun 17 22:27:43 2015 UTC,"I've tried it but have found a much better option (for me) is to bend over 90 degrees, put the wire under and my arms through the straps, and stand back up. They just fall into the cups. Scooping just feels like I'm fighting gravity...might as well let it do the work for me."
ABraThatFits,3a6b23,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:13:46 2015 UTC,I do a gentle scoop but not much swoop. If I am more than gentle all I do is pull my skin past my root into the cup so it looks like I'm spilling out but that's just cause I got some extra skin in there. I wonder how many people we tell need tighter bands since their s&s isn't being retained are just experiencing this? It seems easy enough to tell since you can just look at your wire marks at the end of the day and see if your whole root was in the cup still or not. Swooping and scooping for me is mostly about making myself well arranged in the cup.
ABraThatFits,3a6b23,mailiana,4,Wed Jun 17 16:48:26 2015 UTC,"The issue for most people is that they have no idea where their breast tissue ends. So they aren't quite sure if they're totally swooped and scooped or not. Even looking at wire marks doesn't help much if you don't know where your root is in relation to them. We like to err on the side of wires being too wide rather than too narrow as underwires can be very painful when sitting on breast tissue, so if the person reports their s&s slipping out over the day we tend to recommend wider cups to keep everything encapsulated, and a tighter band to prevent the cups from moving around and letting tissue out. It's not so much the appearance of quadboob or armpit spillage that causes us to recommend the tighter band but the movement of tissue. The bra's job is to make sure your tissue all stays in one spot!  I also personally found it easy to find the edge of my root but that's mostly because my ribcage has very little padding and I can see my ribs through my skin. So I could see that there was no breast tissue where the ribs where.  If you can swoop and scoop a bunch of extra skin into your cup perhaps narrower underwires would work better for you. Ideally you should have the wires following your root exactly with any extra skin outside it (though of course this isn't always possible)."
ABraThatFits,3a6b23,noys,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:50:29 2015 UTC,"Sure, I guess my roots are pretty obvious, also probably helped from having a bony ribcage. Narrow underwires have helped me find a consistent fit since my root is pretty narrow anyway, and then there's less space for me to hoink extra skin over into, and so then I don't find my fit changing throughout the day as that extra skin slips back out to where it is supposed to be in the first place. Just something to consider for those with pronounced roots and skin that likes to be moved all over =) I tend to stay out of root discussion/advice. People always see that dimple at the top of the underwire which totally can be a sign of a too-narrow wire, but for me that just means that I've scooped some skin over into the cup and the skin is pulling out of place and I have a hard time telling the difference on other people."

ABraThatFits,3a6b23,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:05:08 2015 UTC,"I scoop more than I swoop, but I do both. I scoop to ensure that the wire is right up to my IMF and pull my lower tissue up into the scoop so it sorta pinches the wire to stay in place in between my ribs and breasts. Swoop to position nipple and bring in side boob. I only have to do this when I put the bra on, as it stays in place.   Occasionally I reverse scoop my center back into the cups, but I just went up a cup size.   Edit: reading through makes me realize that I have my terminology backwards, as lifting my breasts into the cup is the most important thing I do when I put a bra on."

If you're looking for even more lift I'd recommend Cleo Melissa or Ellis. In my experience they give an up to here feeling which is nice if you're like me and your boobs are low set on your chest.   Eta: as for the side boob, are you scooping and swooping? If you still have it after that it could be extra skin/fat from your arms/upper chest or or could be boob that will migrate if you have a properly fitting bra."

ABraThatFits,3a6jos,joanna70,3,Wed Jun 17 18:00:10 2015 UTC,Just a warning; is rather difficult to find melissa in your size. The band runs a size small. I snapped two up off braswap and I do actually belive that their might be one there in your size(too small for me) . Since it's discontinued you'll not be able to buy it off traditional sites most likely and eBay might be the best bet otherwise. I think it was replaced by minnie which I don't think gives as much lift and isn't as friendly towards slightly or very FOT breasts.   In my fat days I usually have a bit of that armpit overhang and I hate it. :(

ABraThatFits,3a6ipl,dwellondreams,7,Wed Jun 17 17:38:21 2015 UTC,I'm starting to think it has to do with my soft boobs too. They will squish down pretty flat so it can be difficult to tell if a bra actually fits until I take it off and they're sore from being smooshed.
ABraThatFits,3a6ipl,horkus1,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:52:10 2015 UTC,Absolutely the same for me.   The calculator is spitting out like a 30J/JJ for me at the moment.

ABraThatFits,3a6ipl,joanna70,4,Wed Jun 17 19:31:56 2015 UTC,I was told the calculated would over estimate my size so I dropped down a few cups and wasted a lot time on undersized bras.

Then it's a matter of trying on a shit load of bras :).  My measurements initially were bang on 32E but nothing fitted me.  30F was much better but the band size wasn't indicated by my measurements, and my current 30G is also not indicated by my measurements (shallow, so I take bigger than my leaning indicates).  My flared ribcage is a big factor which means I need supertight bands and the calculator can't possibly know or predict that.  I am usually pretty hot on pointing out that in the larger range the calculator can overestimate, but sorry to anyone where that wasn't true!  It just shows that trying on a range of sizes is always the best bet."

ABraThatFits,3a619q,yellkaa,8,Wed Jun 17 16:04:05 2015 UTC,"It depends on two things: how smooth is the upper line and how high are those 'high-waisted' really. Maybe, my bottom is just too long, but a lot of 'high-waisted' pants don't even reach my navel while I prefer them starting on my actual waist which is about 3 inches higher. When they end at that odd point under the navel, I'd better use low rise shorts (if their 'low rise' at least covers my pubic hair, lol: I really had one which didn't).  About smooth upper line: I prefer my undergarments stay invisible under my skirts and dresses, but some panties have elastic upper line which tends to cut into my body, so they become noticeable. At my waist, my dresses usually have some gapping, so no one sees the line, but lower they usually hug my curves pretty tight, so any cutting edge is well-seen. So, I don't wear a low-cut shorts when their upper edge is not absolutely smooth."
ABraThatFits,3a619q,cupcakery,2,Wed Jun 17 15:54:05 2015 UTC,"Hi, thank you for your very helpful response. Our aim would be high waist briefs that sit at the waist i.e. the most narrow area of the torso just under the ribs to ensure a smooth line. However, as the length of people's torsos vary we would not be able guarantee that the briefs would sit in the same place on everyone. But we would certainly be aiming for waist height and not lower.  These briefs would also have a different waist design to the thong shown in our images; the straps would only be at the sides and not at the top front so the fabric would be smoother."
ABraThatFits,3a619q,khasiv,5,Wed Jun 17 16:02:38 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna vote for shorts. I feel like if the style of this particular bra was more pin-up vintage style, high waisted briefs would make sense. To me, it reads more modern sexy, and I think a strappy boyshorts would fit that aesthetic better."
ABraThatFits,3a619q,fizzlepop,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:41:02 2015 UTC,Thank you for your input. Shorts would perhaps be better suited to the style.
ABraThatFits,3a619q,xrebelangelx,6,Thu Jun 18 05:01:48 2015 UTC,"Oh yessss! I like the shorts better. I would wonder about the tension on the straps though, is the elastic expected to be forgiving?"

ABraThatFits,3a619q,4r1337,5,Wed Jun 17 14:52:48 2015 UTC,"I personally would prefer high waisted briefs. Boy shorts have never worked for me, I think because my thigh muscles stick out, making the front of the shorts ride up. Just my 2 cents."
ABraThatFits,3a619q,ericazibby,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:37:29 2015 UTC,Thank you for your input :)   We certainly want to include high waist briefs in our collections and they are already being developed for our new non-padded Sophia. So we will at least have some coming soon even if they aren't included with the Louise :)
ABraThatFits,3a619q,lightning_crashes,4,Wed Jun 17 15:46:02 2015 UTC,"Ooh, tough question! I'd normally go straight in for the high waist option as I like the vintage look, but I feel like the bra should be paired with lower rises based on its style, but I'm still swaying more towards high waist I think."
ABraThatFits,3a619q,MutantToenail,6,Wed Jun 17 16:17:22 2015 UTC,Low rise shorts definitely. High waist briefs never worked for me. :(
ABraThatFits,3a619q,cleverdistraction,4,Wed Jun 17 16:26:39 2015 UTC,I think boyshorts personally. I am soo not a fan of this high-wasted trend.
ABraThatFits,3a7uoj,zucchiniRabbit,2,Wed Jun 17 22:27:53 2015 UTC,"Yup, looks about the right size for your measurements.   If you have a shallow bust, I would de comment Cleo Juna and Cleo Maddie for you."
ABraThatFits,3a8hrx,girl_toronto,3,Thu Jun 18 01:44:36 2015 UTC,"32E might be a good place to start, judging by your measurements. If you think you could feel comfortable in a 30 band given a cup size that fits, then you might want to move to that. 30F or 30FF sounds about right, based off of your measurements. They're pretty much exactly the same as mine, and I haven't been able to go down to a 30 band. Maybe if the bands run loose you would prefer the 30F/FF"
ABraThatFits,3a8hrx,rainydayseveryday,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:49:58 2015 UTC,You have the same measurements? What cup size do you wear?  I tried the 30 band but it just seemed too tight. It was like I wasn't able to breath. Maybe i'm just not used to it.
ABraThatFits,3a8hrx,rainydayseveryday,2,Thu Jun 18 01:55:12 2015 UTC,"I usually wear a 32E, but it depends on the bra and your shape. A 30 band is going to depend on your preference. I've found that I'm wearing my 32E bras on the second or the tightest hooks now. I'm considering going down to a 30 band. My underbust is 30.5 snug and 28.5 tight though, so you have less compression and you might not find a 30 band to be comfortable."
ABraThatFits,3a8hrx,rainydayseveryday,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:13:07 2015 UTC,Do the lower band sizes make your breasts look more flat or I am just imagining it? lol  I think 32 band size feels more comfortable but i'm still not sure what the cup size should be.  What cup size do you think would be better for me?
ABraThatFits,3a8hrx,M_tridactyla,4,Thu Jun 18 02:19:12 2015 UTC,"It's probably a shape mismatch if it gave a flattening look, or it could have been the wrong size. 30E is probably too small. 32E seems like a good place to start. If you scoop and swoop and there's quadboob or extra fabric, adjust cup size accordingly, making sure you're picking bras that are the right shape for you"
ABraThatFits,3a8hrx,M_tridactyla,2,Thu Jun 18 03:07:37 2015 UTC,"The difference between your standing/leaning/lying bust measurements suggests that you're projected, so you definitely could've experienced a shape mismatch in the smaller bandsizes you tried. Bras for shallow shapes are usually wide and shallow, so they will try to hold projected breasts too close to the chest because there is no room for the depth of the breast."
ABraThatFits,3a8hrx,M_tridactyla,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:06:56 2015 UTC,oh that makes so much sense now. Thanks for telling me. Seemed like all the smaller band sized i tried were more shallow and wider. Do you know if 30 and 32 band sizes are more shallow? or it just depends on the bra type. Do you know which bra types would be good for projected breasts?
ABraThatFits,3a8hrx,hurrrrrmione,2,Fri Jun 19 13:04:30 2015 UTC,"What bras have you tried? If you tried things like Victoria's Secret or Wacoal (both generally wide wired and shallow or shallowish), or a too small cup, those will not work for a projected and average or narrow rooted shape.  Panache and Cleo are average to narrow and usually projected in most sizes. I think that Cleo Lucy and Marcie are about average projection in 32F; some Panache models like Jasmine will be deeper."
ABraThatFits,3a6ii3,mitsuuu,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:45:48 2015 UTC,"28FF sounds about right! With your shape, I think Cleo Lucy would be a great bra to start with. This bra is suited to FoB, projected breasts and we often recommend it for beginners as it's very popular.  As far as having your breasts stand out, it's hard to know until you put the bras on. Some ladies have found that a well-fitting bra makes them look smaller, as the quadboob they had before was making their breasts seem larger and wider than they actually are. Others (myself included) have found that well-fitting bras make them look a bit bigger, because too-small bras used to squash the breasts down and reduce their projection. Most people report an improvement in breast shape under clothes, and for the most part people achieve the appearance they desire from a well-fitting bra."
ABraThatFits,3a6ii3,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:03:32 2015 UTC,"Hi there! I'm a 28G according to the calculator but I wear either 28FF or 30F most of the time, I'm also projected, full on bottom with 2/5 as well, so you can check my gallery at Bratabase! I have mostly Panache or Cleo by Panache bras. I really recommend the Lucy, it's a wonderful bra and the porcelain is an awesome t-shirt bra as well!  Since Freya bras are more projected, I'm also eager to try the famous Deco! It would look great on you, I think!  Welcome to ABTF! :)"
ABraThatFits,3a7bem,jasmunr,5,Wed Jun 17 20:08:35 2015 UTC,"I would definitely say it's too shallow for you. I would also suggest going up a size. It looks like the gore might not be tacking in the middle (hard to tell), and in the middle it also looks like the wires might be getting pushed down out of your inframammary fold. You're not quadboobing but you look dangerously close to falling out of the middle of it. A cup up in a more projected bra would help.  Could you share your five measurements so that we can double check them? You look fairly even as far as shape, so you might want to try Cleo Lily or Erin in a 32E, depending on what your measurements come out as."
ABraThatFits,3a7bem,cupcakery,7,Wed Jun 17 20:53:20 2015 UTC,"It looks almost too small, and like other commenters noted, the bra isn't projected enough. I also took note of how you said that the calculator gave you 32E but changed it to North American sizing as a DD. This calculator gives UK sizing, which a 32E actually is larger than a DD in North American sizing. A 32E is equal to a 32DDD in North American sizing."
ABraThatFits,3a7bem,ariawhatever,3,Wed Jun 17 20:59:53 2015 UTC,"Mm, the bra does not look projected enough."
ABraThatFits,3a7bem,j_sunrise,2,Wed Jun 17 20:44:20 2015 UTC,"What are your 5 measurements?  It does look like the bra is cutting in to your tissue on the top.  With the padded underwire, it does make it difficult for the bra to tack.  It may be worth trying 34DD since La Senza doesn't carry 32DDD.   On a side note I am totally wearing that  same bra in the same size lol"

ABraThatFits,3a6shi,vonlowe,4,Wed Jun 17 19:54:42 2015 UTC,"32B fits pretty well because it has approximately the same volume in the cups as both 30C and 28D.   28 bands can be very hard to find, especially in stores. 30C is going to be easier to find. If don't mind ordering online, though, I do recommend trying one or two 28D bras. You might find the band feels too tight, but you might not.   What shape do you think your breasts are?"
ABraThatFits,3a6shi,hurrrrrmione,3,Wed Jun 17 22:51:34 2015 UTC,Most people shop online but I believe Aerie carries 30C. Nordstrom should have 30C as well. The Little Bra Company various those sizes but you will probably have to go online. I think Target just started carrying The Little Bra Company bras though.   The size looks about right. Keep in mind 30C/28D have the same size cups as your 32B just on a smaller band. Do you scoop all of your tissue into the cups when you put your bra on? Does the band sit level or ride up in the back? Which hook do you clasp it on?
ABraThatFits,3a6shi,plutonium743,2,Wed Jun 17 18:06:19 2015 UTC,"I've tried to scoop before, but I don't really have anything to scoop. I think it might just be my shape. The band usually sits level (depending on the bra), but I always clasp it on the tightest hook."
ABraThatFits,3a6shi,noys,6,Wed Jun 17 19:06:00 2015 UTC,"Starting on the loosest hooks means you can tighten up as the bra stretches out, you shouldn't ever need to wear a new bra on tightest hooks."
ABraThatFits,3a6shi,findis,3,Wed Jun 17 19:33:23 2015 UTC,A band that is too big can make scooping and swooping impossible. S&S can make a big difference even in people with small breasts.

ABraThatFits,3a85ax,Lyannis,3,Wed Jun 17 23:52:51 2015 UTC,"Truthfully, you could be either of those sizes, as your measurements are only slightly closer to 30F than 30E. Trying both sizes in the same bra would be good, as it will also help you sort out your shape."
ABraThatFits,3a4btz,Phishmcz,51,Wed Jun 17 03:11:14 2015 UTC,"Hey! Your reaction is super normal because bra sizing is widely misunderstood. We often think in popular culture (including professional bra fitters) than A cups are small, B average, C big, D huge and DD whoaaaa!   Truth is, there is no such thing as a D cup or and A cup. Bra sizing is determined by the ratio between the band size and the cup size. The letter ""A"" or ""DD"" means absolutely nothing without the band size.   That said, to assuage your discomfort, here is a great resource for seeing what properly fitted bras look like. Here are women in 28DD bras: http://www.brabandproject.com/gallery/search?band=28&amp;cup=DD&amp;age=&amp;brand=&amp;sister_sizes=0&amp;search=Search  Now that said, the calculator is a good starting point but not set in stone! I would recommend looking through our resources to understand the shape of your breasts better (in your size range, you may be shallow and we have a guide for shallow shape specifically!) also, it sometime does help to get another set of eyes on your measurements if you want, as sometimes the band size in your range may be too tight as they have less squish in the under bust often.   Edit: also, 34B=32C=30D=28DD! so your new size is the exact same -volume- as your old bras! I bet you have a lot of problems with your band riding up? The way bras are sized, the volume stays the same when you go up a letter and down a number and vice versa (called sister sizing). So your new size is the same but will provide you with a band that actually hugs your body and will provide WAY more support!  Welcome!"
ABraThatFits,3a4btz,stormy381,14,Wed Jun 17 03:24:46 2015 UTC,You actually linked to all the 28 band entries on the Bra Band Project.  Here is just the 28DD pictures.

ABraThatFits,3a4btz,hurrrrrmione,2,Wed Jun 17 04:45:07 2015 UTC,"Doesn't it seem odd that this site is putting me at a 28, when the 32's of Aerie were digging into me? Should I try to buy a 28 and see how it feels, or should I just go up a band size?"
ABraThatFits,3a4btz,M_tridactyla,30,Wed Jun 17 03:50:54 2015 UTC,"The band can feel too tight if the cups are too small or not wide enough to fit your breasts inside-- then your breast outside the cup stretches the band and feels uncomfortable.  You can test this by trying on the bra backwards, so that the band is in the right place, but the cups are on your back and empty (or put it on upside down with the cups down toward your stomach). If the band then feels like a good size, it was a problem with the cups.  If your snug and tight underbust measurements are close to each other, you may end up feeling most comfortable in 30 bands anyway, so definitely try some 30D and 30DD bras as well. Aerie and Victoria's Secret carry 30D, although possibly only in the try-on fitting bras in stores and not on the racks, so you will probably have to ask to see them.  From your description of your breasts, it seems possible that you are projected and full on bottom. Could you please check out the shape guide and see what shape you think you are so people can recommend specific bras?"
ABraThatFits,3a4btz,stormy381,8,Wed Jun 17 04:09:26 2015 UTC,"The best way to really advise regarding calculator vs human insight would be to post your 5 measurements. Do you still have them by any chance?  (I can help a bit, but some members on here are amazing at helping with a more nuanced approach to the calculator results and can advise as well)  A too small cup will cause a band to feel too tight, but also it could have been the shape of the bra was incompatible with your breast shape.

ABraThatFits,3a4btz,ariawhatever,4,Wed Jun 17 11:49:19 2015 UTC,Go down a band size and see how it goes.  Not all bras are made equal.  I find discomfort in bras that have a thin band.  They just don't fit right and irritate my back.  You will have to try them on to find out.  It could also mean that you are a cup up or down from the estimate.    Chantelle has been very good to me in terms of having a variety of nice 30C and 30D bras.
ABraThatFits,3a4btz,bystandling,15,Wed Jun 17 04:07:59 2015 UTC,"A DD on a 28 band is actually fairly small. A 28DD is equal to your 34B in volume, just a smaller band.

Stand up for yourself and your new size... and read the fit guide so you can use your judgment when something truly fits.  Is there an aerie at your mall?

ABraThatFits,3a6cms,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Wed Jun 17 16:26:45 2015 UTC,La Senza has strapless push-up bras in 38D. From the website it looks like you've got 13 different styles to choose from.
ABraThatFits,3a6cms,vanillabubbles16,2,Wed Jun 17 16:37:12 2015 UTC,"The Body Kiss one has padded underwire so it won't dig in. Beyond Sexy one has a low plunge gore and gel padding.  My Customized is molded, but doesn't have push up in 38D size. The cups look the same as Beyond Sexy though.  That is, if you wanted to try la Senza."
ABraThatFits,3a5vjd,yellkaa,11,Wed Jun 17 13:53:55 2015 UTC,"It definitely looks like a shape mismatch. Cups don't look deep enough for you, which seems to make your ""girls"" push against the cups for more space and the only way for them to go is up and to the sides, distorting the shape of the bra. It's not you, it's the bra!"
ABraThatFits,3a5vjd,SaltyBlackBroad,5,Wed Jun 17 14:47:42 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. The wires look to be sitting at least 2cm below the IMF, probably because it's just way too shallow.   I'd say too shallow, possibly too small, but even in a bigger size it may still be too shallow."
ABraThatFits,3a5vjd,dwellondreams,2,Wed Jun 17 15:21:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think if she goes a cup size up the wires will probably get a tad wider, causing the splaying to just get worse. Deeper bowl!"
ABraThatFits,3a5vjd,SaltyBlackBroad,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:33:43 2015 UTC,Do you think the straps problem is also caused by the shape or it may be a band size too big for me?
ABraThatFits,3a5vjd,SaltyBlackBroad,2,Wed Jun 17 15:40:44 2015 UTC,"I can't really see all of the band, but it looks like the right size from the photos (a little sad face- which is what I say one gets at the hooks when the band is a tad too big). That said, if you were to go down a band and up two cups, I think you are still going to have the same shape issue, and if the wires do get wider you are still going to have the same issue. I think if the wires were narrower and the cups deeper, then the placement of the straps on your body would be different. So, I'm saying, I just think that bra's not right bra for you. It looks like it's fighting against your shape instead of with it."
ABraThatFits,3a5b0s,wambrita,6,Wed Jun 17 10:02:13 2015 UTC,"I'm finally back from my vacation! Well, I got back Sunday, but I wanted to post on the new weekly thread.  We flew out of the SLC airport to catch a redeye that flew out at midnight-fifteen. My 4 year old son was in terror getting on the airplane, said he didn't want to be on it, that he had to go potty -he uses this as an excuse when he doesn't want to be somewhere, uses it ALL THE TIME when I take him shopping- and he thankfully slept for both legs of the flight to Norfolk, VA.  My cousin's wedding was beautiful, and I got tons of compliments on my dress. We left early because we got seated right in front of the speakers, and I got a headache that felt like someone was splitting my skull open over my left eye with an axe. We missed out because apparently, some wedding crashers showed up and broke a beer bottle over the head of another guest. (!!)  So, a bit of family health news, my mother's cancer scare isn't actually cancer! She has dense breast tissue, and I guess something with her going through menopause or something made some scary shadowing pop up. Unfortunately, my Nana has lung cancer, and apparently we're the only ones in the family that have sense, because everyone's upset with her for not confirming it with a biopsy; she's on blood thinners and if they nick something, she'll bleed out. She refuses to do chemo because it basically boils down to dignity. She's okay with living whatever time she has left without being sick and incontinent from the chemo. I support my Nana's decision 100% and I've even had to explain to my mother the logic and reasoning behind her decision. I'm grateful that I was able to see her, and that she got to see my kids again, and meet my son, since last time I visited, he wasn't even a blighted ovum on my ovary :P  We did almost everything I wanted to do.. went to the beach, went fishing at night with my dad and the kids got to reel in a fish, ate our way through the area, got to see people I haven't seen in forever, visited some museums, got lost a few times even with a GPS. We didn't visit Colonial Williamsburg, or Busch Gardens. The kids are too young to appreciate American History, and my son is terrified of any kind of ride that goes faster than walking speed. I also didn't get to go to the bra shop that I wanted to visit! Next time I suppose.  The flight home was great, although I made the mistake of letting my younger two kids sit next to each other on the first leg of the flight, and they were fighting with each other the entire time, and the little dude was actually HAPPY to be on the plane.. going home I guess.  The best part? We ended up WAY UNDERBUDGET!! Woop woop!"

There's this one dress that I've had for ages and it never really fit me right until I started wearing well-fitting bras. My boobs were being squashed into the armpits so I could never really fill out the front of the dress. Comparing my most recent photo in that dress (Monday) to one from about a year ago at my brother's first communion...it looks like I grew even though I didn't. The shape is just so much better.   I also noticed that I was able to almost get VS-style cleavage on occasion back then but never really noticed it. It wasn't often, and I had to be standing at an angle for it to be noticeable, but it was there. Mostly in tops that I found to be really low-cut so I didn't wear them often. My old bras barely fit underneath them, so a lot of my boob was just hanging out there."

I'm at the point where the only bras I want to wear are my stretchy, cheap, unfortunately sweaty for summer lounge bras. Measurements not really any different, I've bought new things and tried and I'm just having a moment.  I bought a Tango Accenti, and where I think the wires are too tall in the armpit (typical) I'm really not sure what's going on with the rest of this thing. It feels really stretchy, despite being a 38 when I have really probably moved into 40s.  I bought a LB ""cooling bra"", and I'm glad it was a cheap ebay buy, not a full price. Cooling? Hah. The only thing cooling about this is that I guess they put a little bit of mesh at the gore. That's it. Regular old heat-trapping molded cups with their signature weird ""smooth"" fabric."

Some days they feel a little small but generally fit just like my 28Es without the pads. One of them is a 65DD. The CH(P)s are a custom Kleksik (CHP 65D), a Kabaretka (CH 65DD, matching high-waisted briefs), and a Summertime (CHP 65D).

ABraThatFits,3a5b0s,drawingdwarf,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:27:06 2015 UTC,"I think I'm gonna have to restrain myself, I'm going to be very bad financially this weekend. My favorite vintage store closed (sobs) and they're liquidating inventory, everything is half off."
ABraThatFits,3a5b0s,scatteringashes,2,Thu Jun 18 16:27:54 2015 UTC,"I have a question, team. Why do the five measurements work in determining (approximately) the correct bra size? They obviously do, but while half asleep and dying of sickness, I found myself wondering -- how do the leaning and lying measurements help determine the correct bra size? Is it finding an average? Determining projection/shallowness? Tissue density?   I mean, it seems to help with all of those things, but I don't understand the basic math at the core of it."
ABraThatFits,3a5b0s,khasiv,3,Wed Jun 17 14:26:10 2015 UTC,"Leaning can tell you about projection when the breasts are scooped in. Of course, it also can tell you a bit about pendulousness. I think the measurements themselves don't necessarily tell you about whether you have a shallow shape -- my bust measurements are all pretty similar but I'm neither shallow nor projected.   The lying measurement I'm not sure why it works. I remember once having figured it out (also half asleep). I think it's a good measurement because then gravity isn't pulling the breasts down, but the breast tissue is still in a position that is different from the standing measurement, which is much more prone to error (especially for projected breasts, which would be at their fullest possibly quite a bit below the IMF, which would include the stomach and other measurements)."
ABraThatFits,3a5b0s,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Wed Jun 17 15:07:23 2015 UTC,"The lying measurement works well for very pendulous breasts because when lying down, the measurer can arrange them into the easiest possible shape to measure. Rather than having the breast hang down in its usual shape, with the tissue and skin spread out on top of the stomach area, the measurer can put the nipple above the IMF and approximate the shape they would get in a bra."
ABraThatFits,3a5b0s,scatteringashes,3,Wed Jun 17 15:27:34 2015 UTC,Ooooooooooooooh. I always assumed I was supposed to measure them exactly how they land when lying.
ABraThatFits,3a5b0s,noys,2,Wed Jun 17 16:43:49 2015 UTC,That's the beauty of it. The measurements (and the shape guide) are all trying to figure out what your size (and shape) is like in a bra.
ABraThatFits,3a5b0s,HootyMyBoobs,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:46:16 2015 UTC,"I do measure them where they lay lying down, but mine also float up (almost to the base of my collarbone) and to the sides when I am laying down."
ABraThatFits,3a5b0s,Champion_of_Charms,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:27:54 2015 UTC,Yeah. My standing measurement also captures a lot of the stomach part of my torso yet still manages to be less than both leaning and laying measurements. I guess the leaning/laying measurements aren't as necessary for firmer tissue? Idk.
ABraThatFits,3a5b0s,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Wed Jun 17 16:44:08 2015 UTC,"The leaning and laying measurements are still useful with firmer tissue, they just tend to be closer together. Pretty much everyone has a larger leaning measurement than the other two. The leaning measurement tends to be the one that cup size is calculated off of for the majority of people who come to ABTF. Even with my soft tissue the leaning measurement is still most accurate for me. In my opinion, a slight overestimation at first is better than underestimation, because it's much easier to see that a bra is too big than it is to see that a bra is too small."
ABraThatFits,3a5b0s,HootyMyBoobs,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:53:43 2015 UTC,"I always thought lying was used more, but maybe that's mainly for larger sizes than can be softer or possibly pendulous (of which I am both). I know for me, lying is the most accurate."
ABraThatFits,3a5b0s,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Wed Jun 17 18:43:02 2015 UTC,"It does depend on size. Large band and bust and/or pendulous breasts tend to do better with the lying measurement. The smaller end of the size range needs the leaning measurement, especially those with shallow shape."
ABraThatFits,3a5b0s,scatteringashes,2,Wed Jun 17 23:23:22 2015 UTC,"What I'm hearing here is that I'm not the only one who contemplates breasts while half asleep, lol.  My measurements definitely scream pendulous, lol -- and that'd make sense why a leaning measurement is needed, since my standing measurement without a bra doesn't really adequately capture my cup needs. IDK about that gravity thing on the lying measurement, though. My breasts have very soft tissue (and other weird stuff), so they go in opposite directions when I lay down. Gravity is not kind to them then, lol.   TL;DR: There is so much about breasts and measurements I still don't understand!"

ABraThatFits,3a5b0s,cupcakery,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:47:57 2015 UTC,I would venture to say it's accurate within one band and cup size for the vast majority of the people who use it. I believe there was a big survey conducted a while back (was it the demographics one?) that detailed how far off the calculator was for a bunch of different people and I believe the trend showed that it got remarkably close for most people. I'll hunt for that link and edit this comment if I can find it.
ABraThatFits,3a5b0s,noys,2,Wed Jun 17 20:43:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, statistically it skews a little bigger in cups all in all but I think it's better than skewing small. Imprecision is somewhat inevitable when we get to large breast volumes or larger ribcages, any deviance from ""average"" in any aspect of breast shape will have much more significant effect. It's more efficient from a fitting perspective to diagnose a too big cup than a too small cup and guess the amount of cups you need to drop if you don't have much experience self-fitting."

I doubt she's wearing vintage bullet bras while fighting crime, so my best guess is the Freya active, because it gives a pointy separated shape and is also a sports bra so it makes a lot of sense.

I bought a couple that were 34G and the band was the slightest too tight so I exchanged for a 36G and it fits perfectly! It isn't too loose it isn't too tight. I love the feel and it makes me look slimmer now that my breasts aren't laying on my stomach. My only issue is that I have a slight feeling of discomfort when I wear any of my new bras for a normal day and I was wondering if that was normal for someone finally wearing a bra that fits right.

ABraThatFits,3a5b0s,emilymae24,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:58:10 2015 UTC,It does. It's mostly just under my breasts. I figured it was just getting used to it since I've only been wearing them a few days now but I wasn't sure.
ABraThatFits,3a5b0s,t_maia,2,Fri Jun 19 22:04:29 2015 UTC,"If the band is a bit too loose and or the cup a bit too shallow, the cup of the bra can and will tilt forward a bit. If this happens the whole weight of your breasts can end up resting on your ribcage (instead of being supported by the band). This is made worse if you got a flared ribcage.   This scenario would explain the discomfort under your breasts near the wires.   Additionally it could be that you have a thin layer of migrated tissue there. If the wires sit on that this would also explain the discomfort."

Yet when I went bra shopping, the available band sizes are 32|70 and 36|80. The ones that fits are the 36|80 C/D. Is this a different in sizing between brands/countries (I bought Wacoal bras, lives in Indonesia), or because the ones that fits me are my supposed bra size's sister sizes?"
ABraThatFits,3a5b0s,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Mon Jun 22 09:27:34 2015 UTC,"US and UK manufacturers tell their customers to add 4 inches (roughly 10 cm) to their underbust measurement to get their band size. The EU sizing system (which Indonesia uses, for the most part) has taken this middle step out and subtracted 10 cm from each number, so women will measure their underbust and automatically pick a bra that's 10 cm larger than their underbust. The majority of 70 bands stretch to 80 cm long, as you can see here: http://www.bratabase.com/browse/cleo/lucy-balconnet-bra-5851/32F/"

The full-bust brands that exist are making huge strides in the number of sizes produced (a Polish brand now makes bras with bands from 24-58 and cups from AA to UK O), and full-bust brands are beginning to collaborate with big box stores. Kohl's now sells Curvy Kate and Parfait by Affinitas online! Our community of well-fitting bra-wearers continues to grow. 80% of the community is under the age of 30, so we're hopefully going to be buying bras for quite some time, voting with our dollars and keeping full-bust brands in business. Those of us who plan on having kids or who have them already will pass this knowledge down to our daughters. It's probably a bit unrealistic to think that within my lifetime the majority of women who want one will own a well-fitting bra, but I hope we can achieve that someday.

Originally stuffing into a 32DD, I have my first 30F bra and for the first time ever, the gore tacks.  However, I feel like it's pushing my boobs apart and when I'm braless, they sit closer together than that.  Like, the gore is two finger widths and they naturally sit apart at one.  The problem is that the only thing between the cups on the bra is the underwires...  Am I just so used to the way my boobs used to look in bras?  I can't even conceive a potential solution for this."
ABraThatFits,3a5b0s,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Thu Jun 18 17:34:34 2015 UTC,"It is definitely possible for the gore to be too wide for your breasts. (It's actually quite common!) Depending on the nuances of your shape, you could do better with a narrower gore, a lower gore, or both.  Even though most full-bust bras don't have any fabric between the underwires at the top of the gore, it's still possible to get different gore widths. The wire channels themselves can be smaller or larger, affecting how narrow the gore is. Some brands use thinner underwires than others, and that also makes a difference.   If you make a fit check post with your measurements, the name of the bra, and any other fit issues that are going on (if you have any), we can hopefully find you a bra with a gore that isn't going to fight with your boobs."

I also like the Goddess Rose 6080 Banded (same cut as Elomi Cleo Banded 8000). While Caitlyn is similar, I do not get along with Caitlyn. The upper cup of Caitlyn is completely straight and my tennis-ball-in-a-sock breasts do not like that. They want a rounder cup there, which Rita provides.   Other bras that work really well for me are the Elomi Smoothing 3911 (note that it runs a bit large in the cup) and the Elomi Bijou.   An older model that I really like is Elomi Maggie, the current Tessa seems to be a variant on it.   Etta is a good idea, but I found it too roomy in the upper cup for me. Etta is definitely narrower than Rita.   Looking at the promotional photos of the current bras Naoko looks interesting, it seems to be based upon the Sakura. Sakura was relatively narrow for an Elomi bra  and gave a fantastic round shape."

What can I do to help mold the underwire of my new bra to my body?  I got my first properly-fitted bra the other day, and it's just wonderful!  Everything seems absolutely perfect with it.  The only issue is that after a few hours of wear, the ribs on my left side where the underwire sits start to get tender and sore.  It seems like the underwire just on that side doesn't quite fit my body, so it presses against that rib, making it sore after awhile.  Will this likely go away once I've worn the bra more and broken it in, or is this a problem I have to fix myself, and if so, how?"

If you're in the US, your best option far and away is ordering online. If you have a Nordstrom near you, they should have a decent smaller band/larger bust selection to browse, but each one is different so your mileage may vary. This link from the Busty Resources wiki can help you find any boutiques in your area as well. Again, ymmv.  Do you have Amazon prime? They're a great resource for free shipping and returns. Asos.com (free shipping over $35 or $40, free returns) and Nordstrom.com (free shipping and returns always) are also good for trial and error purposes.  If you're full on bottom, we typically recommend Cleo Lucy or Kali to try first. It's a seamed balconnette that caters to FOB shapes very well.

I complained about not being able to find fresh batteries in the house and she responded by doing this...I guess I wouldn't lose them, but it would be horribly uncomfortable."
ABraThatFits,3a6e1o,ariawhatever,14,Wed Jun 17 16:13:53 2015 UTC,TBH I would remake it and make sure you give it a more appropriate name. You can't change the subreddit name after you create it and this sounds like it's your personal sub (which people have for some reason) as opposed to something meant for other people.
ABraThatFits,3a6e1o,-tallywa-,10,Wed Jun 17 18:16:12 2015 UTC,It's also good to give it a name related to the purpose (i.e. /r/smallbandlargebust) so it's easier to find and remember.
ABraThatFits,3a5mbp,teramisula,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:24:39 2015 UTC,How much for the A333? I'm pretty interested.

ABraThatFits,3a5jn1,onthefenced,5,Wed Jun 17 11:55:15 2015 UTC,"Everyone loves Panache Sport! It is a bit roomy on top, though, so you may feel better in 32F in that one. See if you can get yourself to a Bravissimo to try it on.  As far as a t-shirt bra goes, maybe one of the more closed on top Decos would work? A cup size down from my usual size in the regular Deco was slightly gapey, whereas the Deco Vibe fit like a glove in my usual size. I'm similar in shape to you."
ABraThatFits,3a5jn1,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:11:18 2015 UTC,"I was thinking I might want to go for a 34 because I have heard sports bras can be painfully tight, or that might just be the Shock Absorber."
ABraThatFits,3a5jn1,noys,4,Wed Jun 17 13:30:20 2015 UTC,That's ShockAbsorber.
ABraThatFits,3a5jn1,MutantToenail,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:11:54 2015 UTC,With Panache Sport I would go with whatever you usually wear unless you get a black one. The black ones run really tight for some reason.
ABraThatFits,3a37sa,lowdiver,6,Tue Jun 16 21:41:13 2015 UTC,Ours is in our sketchy mall too! For those of you in the DFW area--it's at the Irving mall.
ABraThatFits,3a37sa,monstruosita,3,Wed Jun 17 00:26:30 2015 UTC,Jealous!!!!! My regular Dillard's does have anything over 30DD that I've ever found. I'll have to find a clearance center...
ABraThatFits,3a37sa,pumkinswife0609,2,Wed Jun 17 03:42:51 2015 UTC,"Nordstroms tends to carry them, but the prices are nuts. Seriously considering taking a job at one when I change universities (the only one in my area is right by where I'm going to do my Masters)."
ABraThatFits,3a37sa,pumkinswife0609,3,Wed Jun 17 03:57:05 2015 UTC,I'm going to Nordstrom this weekend to get bra fitted so I guess I'll see what they have to offer. The closest Dillard's Clearance center is 4 hours away :(
ABraThatFits,3a37sa,TheDodgyStalker,2,Wed Jun 17 04:04:01 2015 UTC,you found 32G's in UK sizing??? I went in my normal Dillard's and couldn't find anything above a 32G in US sizes. there's also a Dillard's clearance store here but I haven't been in there in a long time.
ABraThatFits,3a37sa,TheDodgyStalker,2,Tue Jun 16 21:51:20 2015 UTC,"YUP!!!! Go to the clearance center. They had down to 28 bands on sale at mine, which was UNREAL. Even found a 32K when I was going through the two racks of 32s. It was insaneeeeeeeeee.... I'm dying of joy. The woman there said that Dillards had way over ordered the bigger sizes back in winter and they were trying to get rid of them."
ABraThatFits,3a37sa,TheDodgyStalker,2,Tue Jun 16 21:54:19 2015 UTC,holy shit that's awesome. I bet my Dillard's clearance won't be as lucky :( but I'm gonna look!
ABraThatFits,3a37sa,TheDodgyStalker,2,Tue Jun 16 22:29:43 2015 UTC,"Ours is super sketchy (we affectionately refer to that mall as either ""Ghetto Mall"" or ""Scary Mall"") but has AMAZING deals. I also love shoe shopping there, and getting my SO to buy suits."
ABraThatFits,3a3f7w,halp_throwaway,8,Tue Jun 16 22:36:50 2015 UTC,"Well, Kali is a Lucy clone, so stands to reason it wouldn't fit lol.  The Lucy is too shallow for you, that's why you can't get the wires all the way into your IMF.  Lucy is a pretty projected bra, but you are more projected than it.  Kali is Lucy 2x worse because it's a cup size too small.  No fear from me, I personally think the Floris fits you great.  You should also get along well with the Panache Envy and Jasmine, which I see were mentioned previously but just making the note here that when they do go on sale or you have the funds, those would probably be good bets."
ABraThatFits,3a3f7w,lcl0706,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:11:46 2015 UTC,"Yes! I was trying two different cup sizes, and I wasn't able to get them both in Lucy, so I had to get one in Kali!  Thank you for chiming in on the Jasmine and Envy suggestions! Hopefully after I return the other two I can try them out!"
ABraThatFits,3a3f7w,LadyVerene,6,Wed Jun 17 00:01:17 2015 UTC,"Floris looks great! Which settles the shape issue - you are definitely full-on-top. I really don't see any fit issues, other than a small amount of looseness at the top, but adjusting the straps a bit should take care of that. Jasmine should work pretty well for you, then - you've got the upper fullness to fill out the top of it.  Floris is a sister-cut of Cleo Marcie, and there are something like a dozen different Marcie clones. Some are more open on top than others - they're all very slightly different - but it stands to reason that at least some of them should work for you.  Also, 36HH is kind of a pain of a size to find. I know this all too well myself, since that's what I wear. I usually just stalk around amazon and see what I can find. Ebay's another place to look."
ABraThatFits,3a3f7w,LadyVerene,2,Tue Jun 16 23:38:20 2015 UTC,"I'm so happy to know my shape now, thank you! I thought maybe the hardest parts of this journey were going to be behind me, but maybe it'll be chasing down bras... haha.  I'll get to work trying some Marcie type cuts, and Jasmine! Do you have any particular sports bras that you favor, if you wear any?"
ABraThatFits,3a3f7w,hurrrrrmione,2,Wed Jun 17 00:04:24 2015 UTC,"I don't actually own a sports bra. I don't really work out or anything, so I don't bother. Panache Sport is supposed to be good, though I don't know how the sizing on it runs."
ABraThatFits,3a3f7w,noys,3,Wed Jun 17 00:35:48 2015 UTC,"I believe Panache Sport is good for FOT and should run true-to-size if you are FOT. I might be remembering wrong, though."
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,LimitedAddition73,6,Tue Jun 16 23:43:41 2015 UTC,It appears you're around a 30F. The 32DD is too small in the cup and the band is a size too large. A well-fitting bra will make your boobs appear better if it is in both the right size and shape. The more well-versed experts or long time ABTFers can provide more information.
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,ariawhatever,2,Tue Jun 16 23:54:23 2015 UTC,30F?! feints that just seems so large! I really don't feel that big. Holy cow. I think I may be freaking out a little here
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,hurrrrrmione,8,Wed Jun 17 00:02:12 2015 UTC,Here's some pictures of women wearing properly fitted 30F bras. Hopefully that helps with the sticker shock! :)
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,hurrrrrmione,3,Wed Jun 17 00:14:39 2015 UTC,"wow thank you that helped. But just F sounds massive!! Already telling people I was a 32DD made me cringe and now if anyone hears I have to order F's! Oh god, where do you even find that size??"
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,hurrrrrmione,6,Wed Jun 17 00:22:29 2015 UTC,"You're welcome!   Lots of places in the US do carry UK F cups - it's DDDD in US sizes, although some brands will label it F and some brands will label it G and some brands will label it H. (That's why we use UK sizing, because unlike US sizing, it's consistent across all UK brands.)  The trick for you is going to be finding F cup bras that are also 30 bands. People tend to assume that as your band size increases, so does your cup size, and therefore people with smaller band sizes can't have larger cup sizes. This is completely wrong, but enough people have this assumption that it can be hard to find small band size + large cup size in stores.   Check this list to find some brands that might carry your size - but again, keep in mind that just because a brand carries 30 bands and F cups doesn't mean they carry 30F. For example, Aerie carries 30 bands and up to a DD cup, but they don't carry 30DD.   And check the offline retailer list for stores near you that might carry your size."
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:32:03 2015 UTC,Is small ribcages and larger cups a rare combination?? And thank you I will look into all those. I am thankful for your response. Where do you get your bras from? I am new to the F world I suppose so I don't know what would be great place to start
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,RevelationInFit,6,Wed Jun 17 00:52:19 2015 UTC,"No, it's not! But we have a societal problem in regards to how people are sized for bras, how people think bras should fit, how people think breasts look in properly fitted bras, and what sizes people think are small and large. And that means that most women are wearing the wrong bra size but don't realize it. This thread discusses it a bit more. Read the threads and comments on this sub and look at people's flairs - we have plenty of people on here with small band sizes and larger and very large cup sizes.   Right now I'm still finding bras that fit me and that I can afford. But I would recommend trying things on at Nordstrom if there's one near you because they should have a large selection of bras in your size. The offline retailer list might also have some lingerie boutiques near you, depending on where you live. A lot of people on here order online and then return the bras that don't fit, but for your first time trying on bras in this size it would be best for you to go to  a store if at all possible."
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,joanna70,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:05:53 2015 UTC,ok thank you :) I think I'm still in shock! Like agh. What F's?! F's?! I'm still recovering haha
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,MutantToenail,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:23:11 2015 UTC,"No worries! It happens to most people who come on here and measure themselves for the first time. It happened to me. It's just going to take some time to get used to it. And trying on some 30F bras will help as well - not all of them will fit perfectly, but they will fit a lot better than your 32DD bras and provide a lot more support."
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,ariawhatever,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:28:12 2015 UTC,So is the 32ddd too small in the cups and too big in the band for me??
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,MutantToenail,4,Wed Jun 17 01:33:36 2015 UTC,"Speaking as someone who owns a lingerie shop, small band/ large cup is really common."
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,SmellsLikeDogBuns,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:03:54 2015 UTC,Really? I never knew. I feel like finding a 30F is near impossible! But maybe after some time I'll find it
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,ma342,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:09:36 2015 UTC,"It's just that so many women are stuffing themselves into what's easily available because no-one has told them :).  And a few who do know can't be bothered because it is a little more hassle and can be a little more pricey, though there are ways around that, especially once you know your size and shape and what fits."
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,ma342,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:09:33 2015 UTC,That makes sense and now I understand why so many women are wearing the wrong sized bra.
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,blubirdTN,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:45:26 2015 UTC,A 30F is only one cup size up from a 32DD. Not a big difference in cup size.
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,cathellsky,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:12:53 2015 UTC,Oh when I look at it that way it isn't bad I guess. So is 30ddd a 30F?
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,ariawhatever,2,Thu Jun 18 18:44:12 2015 UTC,Nope. A 30DDD is a 30E. A 30F is a 30DDDD/G or sometimes labeled as F. I went down 1/2 a cup (dang fluctuations!) so I'm now more of a 28F/FF or even a plain F. But I can be sure people would probably think C at most if they didn't know this sizing.
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,dancemogdance,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:23:08 2015 UTC,"A 30F is a 30DDDD. But this is a size smaller than a 32F or a 32DDDD. Remember that the cup size changes in relation to band size. So a 32C is a cup size smaller than a 34C (and a band size, too)."
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,joanna70,5,Fri Jun 19 15:13:23 2015 UTC,"Some 30 bands can run quite snug, so I'd try some 32E's (aka 32DDD in many US brands). If you don't want to deal with stores (I don't blame you..), I'd suggest starting with sites that offer free shipping/returns like Amazon, nordstrom, and asos.  There are some recommendations in the shape guide you could look at. You described yourself as shallow, so you might try the Freya Patsy or a sister cut and then adjust from there. Other users might have better suggestions though!"
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,ariawhatever,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:19:28 2015 UTC,Okay thank you!
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,ariawhatever,3,Wed Jun 17 00:27:58 2015 UTC,"A popular misconception is that any cup size above DD is huge. In fact, cup size is relative to band size, so 30F=32E=34DD=36C=38B. The Bra Band Project has photos posted by those who wear 30Fs: http://www.brabandproject.com/gallery/search?band=30&cup=F&age=&brand=&sister_sizes=0&search=Search."
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,ariawhatever,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:17:52 2015 UTC,"F's sound crazy. Where will I found bras now. They seem impossible, i'm so embarrassed now."
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,ma342,5,Wed Jun 17 00:23:04 2015 UTC,"Nah, don't be embarrassed. 30F is a pretty common size--it's just that most people are wearing the wrong bra size. (I went through the same shock when I went from 32DDD to 30FF several years ago.) If you have Amazon Prime, Amazon is an excellent place to order bras--free, fast shipping, free returns, quick reimbursement to your credit card when you return. If not, look at barenecessities.com, herroom.com, figleaves.com.  Nordstrom can be ok to shop in person, depending on the specific store/salespeople. And of course you can shop Nordstrom online, too."
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,ariawhatever,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:11:04 2015 UTC,"My girl friends always made snooty comments about my boobsâ¦because all of them are like ""well you have a small band size so technically your boobs don't even count"" and say other mean things about them like ""really. You don't look that big to be DD"" if they hear F or even catch wind of that one they'll be all over me for it. Ahaha looks like many journeys to VS will be lies of ""I don't have enough money to buy a bra today"""
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,ariawhatever,3,Wed Jun 17 01:18:17 2015 UTC,You don't necessarily need to tell your friends the F size. rarely tell people my true size just because people are shocked by it. Just tell them you have your correct size & have been properly measured. Most people don't go around asking for your bra size.....or if everything else fails just tell them its a UK method of measuring. That seems to work.
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,ariawhatever,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:00:49 2015 UTC,Ok thank you :) is another sign a bra is too small the under arm almost fat from wearing it. I get it all the time and it's annoying as hell. I don't know if you know the answer haha
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,ariawhatever,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:42:47 2015 UTC,"That is absolutely a sign of the bra not fitting. I recently found my proper size and have little to no underarm fat when I swoop and scoop, compared to what I had in the bras I was wearing before. And tissue migration should hopefully make the underarm far disappear more as the tissue moves to where it belongs."
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,LadyBoobsalot,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:29:27 2015 UTC,I understand. But I can stand right back up and even shift a bit and my under arm fat goes back. And I decided to measure myself and post it here because you ladies seem like experts.
ABraThatFits,3a3nb1,khasiv,2,Wed Jun 17 06:08:39 2015 UTC,"That's awful. At my size, no one has done that because they look fairly normal. Sure, they're bigger than some, but I keep my boobs usually covered. They probably might look more proportional on me than either a different boob shape or a different height would look with the same size."
ABraThatFits,3a3yf1,heartburnbra,2,Wed Jun 17 01:15:41 2015 UTC,TLBC tends to run small in both cup & band. For a 26C fit you'd want to try 28C in TLBC.
ABraThatFits,3a3yf1,nippy_noodles,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:30:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's what I realized. According to my measurements, it looks like I should be a 26DD-ish, should I still size up in the band? The brand was pretty tight, but I'm also used to wearing really loose bands, so I'm not sure how it should feel.   Besides sticking with TLBC, do you have any other recommendations? I can't seem to find TLBC in my price range..."
ABraThatFits,3a3yf1,noys,3,Wed Jun 17 02:35:49 2015 UTC,TLBC just released a cheaper line for Target called Ariette but I think they're currently sold out in 28C. Keep your eyes open!
ABraThatFits,3a3yf1,SexyGeniusGirl,2,Wed Jun 17 17:46:31 2015 UTC,Oh my god what? Where have I been? Target carries 30 and 28 band bras?
ABraThatFits,3a3yf1,nippy_noodles,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:53:29 2015 UTC,Yeah they've been sold out since the first day-- I contacted their customer support but they weren't sure if/when they'd get more in :(
ABraThatFits,3a3yf1,nippy_noodles,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:22:56 2015 UTC,"26 bands are custom only so if you can work a 28 band it'll be easier for you to shop. Bands should be comfortably tight and when you're new bra band size is drastically different it might take time for you to adjust to the new one. Also since your snug & tight measurements only have about an inch difference, 28 band will be recommended since you have less ""fat"" to cushion the band for comfort. 28D (or 30C) is 26DD's sister so you're on the right track!  It looks like Rapture is good for those in between projection & shallow. You might want to checkout this page for bra styles that are likely to work for shallow shapes. Good luck!"
ABraThatFits,3a3yf1,Gilliegrl4,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:29:35 2015 UTC,"I definitely don't have any fat to pad hehe. Given I'm close to the 26"" measurement, should I stick with TLBC's 28 band or will the 30 bands be better do you think?   I looked at the guide and it seems as though the Cleo George/Marcie are on there as good choices but I'm hoping to get some more input given the bras I've tried. Playing bra trial-and-error is no fun hehe. Thanks again!"
ABraThatFits,3a3yf1,esoomcol,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:49:52 2015 UTC,Well for TLBC you'd need a 30D (28D) which they don't make or 32C (30C).  You might want to check out Bratabase.You can research the fit and shape of a style through the reviews & measurements.
ABraThatFits,3a3yf1,esoomcol,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:21:56 2015 UTC,You could always try Lucia in a 28C if you like how it fits other than being too small. How was the wire width on the 28B?
ABraThatFits,3a3yf1,Shenaniganz08,2,Wed Jun 17 01:36:47 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I've been unable to find one for a similar price-- if the target collab ever gets restocked then I'll definitely try that next!   I'm not really sure how to tell how the wire width was. The middle part was way closer together than the Betsey Johnson which is why I think the gore didn't tack? My nipples were also dangerously close to showing out the top. Here are some pics for reference:  1 2 3
ABraThatFits,3a3lxc,foxehgirl,2,Tue Jun 16 23:31:26 2015 UTC,What cup sizes were you trying on at Nordstrom?
ABraThatFits,3a3lxc,hurrrrrmione,2,Wed Jun 17 00:13:14 2015 UTC,40D and 38DD.
ABraThatFits,3a3lxc,hurrrrrmione,7,Wed Jun 17 00:28:46 2015 UTC,"Your measurements put you at halfway between 40F and 40FF. That's 3 and 4 cup sizes larger than the 40D bras you were trying. 38FF or 38G might also work - it's going to depend on whether you feel more comfortable in a 38 band or a 40 band.   So the reason you felt like your breasts were being pushed into your chest is because they were - the cups of the bras you were trying didn't have enough space for your breasts, so your breasts were being flattened. That's also the reason the gores didn't tack."
ABraThatFits,3a3lxc,hurrrrrmione,3,Wed Jun 17 00:40:47 2015 UTC,"So, when I tried to explain the issue, the asked woman assured me that was normal and used her 36 gg bra as evidence.  I gave up because when I pushed she got her manager in to agree with her :/"
ABraThatFits,3a3lxc,hurrrrrmione,6,Wed Jun 17 00:46:44 2015 UTC,"I'm really sorry you had a bad experience. Nordstrom's fitters are sometimes great, and they sometimes are okay, and they sometimes are bad. Sounds like you got some of the bad ones.  I can't say for sure if that crease is normal, but I can tell you I don't get it.   Nordstrom does carry 40F and 40FF. So if you don't mind going back there, you could go and just try on bras by yourself. I just checked their website and they have a good amount of options in those sizes, including sports bras. Here's the list - you can even add your location to the search and it'll tell you which bras are available at stores near you."
ABraThatFits,3a3lxc,hurrrrrmione,2,Wed Jun 17 00:54:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I appreciate the help.   I'm on vacation in CA and was hoping that the selection here would be better than back home (the only one in my area is near me, but I figured Los Angeles would be stocked better) but their section was not as good.   I will probably just try online, to be honest. They made it very apparent that the only bras they had in what they thought was a ""perfect fit"" were nude and full coverage. I was fairly disappointed."
ABraThatFits,3a3lxc,ilikepai,6,Wed Jun 17 00:59:46 2015 UTC,"Amazon often has bras on sale and there are many bras that have free shipping and/or free returns, and many bras that are Prime eligible if you have Amazon Prime.   If you like the Cleo Marcie and don't mind red, I found it on sale in 38G on Amazon with free returns: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JWQ60IO/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER"

ABraThatFits,3a45uf,pumkinswife0609,2,Wed Jun 17 03:51:14 2015 UTC,"It seems like it might be too closed on top as well as too small. If you had the chance to try Comexim Ingrid (possibly in a size up as well), you might have better luck."

ABraThatFits,3a45uf,lcl0706,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:46:40 2015 UTC,"I wonder if part of the problem is that this bra runs tight in the band with a slightly shallower cup, and so I wonder if sister sizing up to a 65 band would help solve the issue? I had this bra in a 65G and the band BARELY stretched to 29 inches."
ABraThatFits,3a2ufi,Flavorbaby13,5,Tue Jun 16 20:07:32 2015 UTC,"It's a relatively rare brand. If you measure your bra for Bratabase and link the measurements I would be able to tell what's likely to work based on its wire width, cup depth and band stretchiness."
ABraThatFits,3a2jeh,rainydayseveryday,8,Tue Jun 16 18:51:10 2015 UTC,"Have you tried pushing on your breast and seeing if a crease forms at the end of breast tissue?  How about feeling the texture of the tissue by applying firm pressure? Breast tissue is more sensitive than just flesh on the ribcage.  In the end when in doubt skew wider as long as you don't experience fit issues. If you feel like currently the underwires are too narrow, that you can't s&s properly, and there's discomfort from where the underwires sit it's a clear sign that you need a wider underwire."
ABraThatFits,3a2jeh,noys,7,Tue Jun 16 19:22:50 2015 UTC,"Alternatively, (this is difficult to describe) when I lay on my back but kinda shift my weight to one side without a bra on, my tissue shifts sideways and I can clearly see where my tissue ends.   But that might be because I have very narrow roots, I don't know if others with wide(r) roots have the same thing."
ABraThatFits,3a2jeh,dwellondreams,2,Tue Jun 16 19:50:40 2015 UTC,"It just kind of oozes to the side when I push down. I can't tell about the sensitivity because I hit a telephone pole at a high speed yesterday, and I got bruises on my chest and under my breasts/where the gore sits, from my bra and the airbag. So everything is pretty tender to the touch.  I have a bra with a wide underwire and it fits me fairly well but it's too projected and the wires are too hard and stiff for my liking."
ABraThatFits,3a2jeh,gliterpoison,2,Wed Jun 17 02:28:54 2015 UTC,I have never been able to actually tell where my roots are. I have shallow outter shape and my tissue is just sorta part of the trunk of my body. I just had to get the right width to hold my tissue in and it worked out. :shrug:
ABraThatFits,3a2jeh,M_tridactyla,3,Wed Jun 17 02:50:28 2015 UTC,"Are you also shallow? If you are, I have recommendations, based on the size in your flair.  The two widest shallow-friendly bras (~6"" wide, 8.5-9"" deep) that I'm aware of that come in 32E are the VS BBV unlined demi in lace, and Tutti Rouge Liliana. Both of them are very open on top. VS has pretty flimsy wires, so I suspect that they actually pull even wider when you put the bra on.  Tutti Rouge is a drag to get ahold of in the US (if you live there), but Liliana is a plunge so it may help wrangle some of your side tissue better than a balconette.  Curvy Kate Roxie Plunge is also very wide and shallow, and easier to try out than Liliana if you live in the US. It's on Amazon for like $20 in some sizes."
ABraThatFits,3a2jeh,horkus1,3,Tue Jun 16 23:49:57 2015 UTC,"I can attest to the VS BBV unlined demi. I just got one in the mail today and those wires stretch like nothing I have ever seen. At first glance they seemed to be the right width but once I put the bra on, the band stretched them far too wide and pulled my breasts flat. I am returning mine but if you want measurements of it before I pack it up, let me know. It is a 32DDD."
ABraThatFits,3a2jeh,M_tridactyla,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:27:59 2015 UTC,"Mine's a 32DDD too. We should both measure them for Bratabase. I am lazy, though."
ABraThatFits,3a2jeh,horkus1,2,Wed Jun 17 01:32:24 2015 UTC,"How much you wanna bet the band measures around 27""? Hahaha.   I am lazy as well. I will do it for a individual that needs help but measuring for the greater good... that is a totally different story."
ABraThatFits,3a2jeh,M_tridactyla,2,Wed Jun 17 01:38:30 2015 UTC,"Unstretched band of my is indeed 27""!  Wire width is about 5.75"", but I really do think it widens when worn. Depth is about 9.5"" I guess, but I think that it's functionally a little shallower when worn because of the wires moving."
ABraThatFits,3a2jeh,horkus1,2,Wed Jun 17 03:35:26 2015 UTC,"Noooo! 27""? You are kidding me, right? hahahaha. That. Is. Awesome. :)  I will have to measure mine. I am really curious to see if they are the same. That sounds kinda ridiculous but it is VS and the only consistent quality of their bras is the inconsistent sizing.   Measurements coming soon...  (edit: Grammar. I couldn't help myself.)"
ABraThatFits,3a2jeh,horkus1,2,Wed Jun 17 05:12:58 2015 UTC,"So mine is 26"" unstretched and only 31"" when stretched to it maximum. The cups are 9.25"" and the wire width is the same at 5.75"".   I completely agree that it is much wider when it is on and especially with a band that doesn't even stretch to 32"". No wonder it smooshed my breasts down. VS is always such a disappointment. They have the power to make really remarkable stuff but they waste it. Ugh. It is a beautiful bra, too. I got the blue paisley print and I am quite bummed that it doesn't work."
ABraThatFits,3a2jeh,lcl0706,2,Wed Jun 17 19:07:50 2015 UTC,"I have the same problem you do, in that there's no obvious line or crease.  Doesn't matter which way I push, lay, wiggle, lean, etc - it's all one continuous thing.  I used to think my roots were very very wide, and they were wider at one point than they are now, but my tissue migration hasn't been extreme.  Now I understand they are quite narrow.  I learned this mostly by trying narrower and narrower bras and lots of fit checks (mostly on bratabase) lol.  Do you get sore before shark week?  Pushing on sore breasts makes it quite a bit easier to tell where the tissue ends - feel around from the center of your boob out to the sides and where it stops feeling sore is most likely where your breast tissue stops.  This also helped me tremendously."
ABraThatFits,3a1rjh,ariawhatever,12,Tue Jun 16 15:38:07 2015 UTC,"There's also a widespread misconception that double letters indicate a ""half size."" They do not. F and FF are one full cup size (1"" bust-underbust difference) apart, as are FF and G, G and GG, and so on."

ABraThatFits,3a2ybj,dwellondreams,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:57:10 2015 UTC,"Ehh...for Pittsburgh there's only Nordstrom AFAIK. They have an okay selection, but I can't really vouch for their fittings since I've only gotten little bits of assistance here and there. I think it depends on how much the fitter wants to make a sale. One encouraged me to get a Deco even though I was concerned about the bottom of the cup folding, for example.   Beachwood Place in Cleveland has both a Nordstrom and a Dillard's. Again, can't really vouch for their fittings. I did have a fitter at Nordstrom say that double letters were half sizes. :/ Also, even though the Nordstrom is bigger than the one in Pittsburgh, they had a smaller selection of UK bras.  I will say that at both Nordstroms I got help/acceptance when I asked for my sizes, instead of the ""oh you can't possibly be an F cup"" brush-off."
ABraThatFits,3a2ybj,braaccount,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:39:37 2015 UTC,"One good thing about Nordstrom is you can search their website by bra size and availability at stores near you. So it's easy to figure out if a store has a good selection of bras in your size before you head in.   I will second though that the fittings are touch-and-go there. I've heard lots of people on this sub say they had a good experience being fitted at Nordstrom and the fitter got them into the right size or a very close size, but plenty of other people have had bad experiences. I got fitted at a Nordstrom a few months ago and the fitter measured only my underbust. It really depends on the store and probably also the individual fitter."
ABraThatFits,3a2ybj,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:08:05 2015 UTC,"Late to the party, but just got fitted at Dillard's in Beachwood Place. They knew what they were doing - I gave them my measurements calculated off this subreddit, and no one batted an eye. When I discussed my shock over my new measurements to a sales rep, she seemed to know what she was talking about, too. Highly recommend!   I don't recommend Nordstrom Rack across the street, though, if you're an unusual size. The selection was pretty poor. I only found one or two bras that were under the 32 band size."
ABraThatFits,3a2tua,exojongin,3,Tue Jun 16 20:03:41 2015 UTC,"30DD or 32D would be a good start.  A half inch difference between snug and tight isn't common, make sure you're doing your snug UB in a neutral breath (not too inhaled or exhaled) and just as snug as you'd need a bra band to fit, not overly tight or loose.  The tight should be fully exhaled and as tight as you can possibly go.  However, stranger things have happened, so if that's really your measurements, then I'd say the calculator is pretty spot on.  32D's may be more comfortable if you have very little ""squish"" in your ribcage.  Likely your shape is fairly shallow, although it's sometimes hard to tell until you try on bras.  Typical ""diagnostic"" bras recommended around here are the unlined Cleo bras - Marcie (FOT), Lucy (FOB), and Lily (most narrow, and better suited to even-ish fullness).  I'd say at least try one of them and post a fit check before you go too crazy ordering or buying bras, it will help you and us better determine your shape and root width.  If you're in the US, Amazon with Prime shipping is fabulous for fast shipping and free returns, they carry almost all of what's most talked about on here and almost always at lower prices than a store.  That said, you can usually find 30DD's and especially 32D's in stores, including Nordstrom's, Macy's, Dillard's, and VS (for the 32D, but keep in mind their bands are very stretchy and you'll likely find them too big really fast once you're in the proper cup).  As far as your current bras go, an A cup is simply not enough depth for your boobs, and a too-big band can make any cup fit wonky.  It can make a too small cup appear too big, and so on.  So I wouldn't get obsessed over your current bras.  A 34A is designed for someone with a 34 UB and a 35 OB.  That's clearly not you ;-)  Check out the bra band project for your sizes, to get an idea of what real women wearing real 30DD's and 32D's actually look like, if you're suffering from sticker shock at the idea of a DD or D cup: http://www.brabandproject.com/gallery/search?band=30&cup=DD&age=&brand=&sister_sizes=0&search=Search That link returns results for 30DD's.  The vast majority of women I've met are wearing a much too big band along with a too-small cup size, mostly because we're all taught/brainwashed along the way of growing up to believe that bands don't come smaller than 32 and cups don't come bigger than DD and if you wear a D cup you have giant boobs.  It's just not the truth.  Good luck and keep asking more questions.  Having ABTF makes a world of difference, even on the smaller ends of the size range.  Once you find your bras that work, you'll wonder how you ever wore the old ones!"

ABraThatFits,3a2tua,Goddess_Keira,2,Thu Jun 18 00:22:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, look for 30DD and 32D primarily; either of those sizes is quite likely to work for you. That said, 30D and/or 32C are not beyond the realm of possibility, but make sure you're scooping and swooping."
ABraThatFits,3a2saw,thighhighsandglitter,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:53:03 2015 UTC,"Are you saying you would exchange it for another size? Looking at the available sizes, if that bra is equivalent to a UK 30HH, I'd size down to 30GG; possibly even 30G. Mind you, if you weren't fully engorged in those pictures you have to take that into account. If you could get a 28H or thereabouts it would be better, but it doesn't seem to be available."
ABraThatFits,3a2saw,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:40:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, I am definitely looking to exchange for a different size. Thank you, I was thinking a 30GG would be suitable, I've just never had a bra be too big for me before so didn't know how to proceed!"
ABraThatFits,3a2saw,yellkaa,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:48:37 2015 UTC,"I was told by a KrisLine seller that they have changed their cups a year or so ago. Before that it had standard European cups which add 2cm every cup letter and listed letters one-by-one with no doubling. After the change they went to UK cups, so they add an inch every cup and they have DDs, FFs, GGs, HHs now. So you just convert only the band size to UK's one using standart size convert charts and do not convert cups. Their 65 band is 30 UK band now, and cups are the same as UK cups. So, you need 65HH in those new Krisline bras.  All old online size converting calculators show their sizes wrong now.  Unfortunally, having measurements pretty similar to yours, I can't tell if it really is so because that seller had no bras with 65 band, lol, so I had absolutely no chance to check it."

ABraThatFits,3a2jme,khasiv,6,Tue Jun 16 18:52:39 2015 UTC,Try a 28 band first. You have similar measurements to my bestie and she wears a 28H. I would start there.

ABraThatFits,3a1k8d,Fimmion,2,Tue Jun 16 14:42:33 2015 UTC,"You're more likely to be 36FF/G I'd say but don't rule out 36GG.  And yes 38DD US and UK are almost always identical, up to DD, above that US sizing is a bit of a crap shoot hence we always use UK sizing and convert where necessary.  When the band is too loose then it can't take the strain and the straps have to, when the cups are too small the gore can't reach the sternum.  Gapping in the cups has a multitude of causes.  A 36 band with an extender may be snug now but is almost certainly the way to go if you are losing weight, if you go for stretch lace cups like Panache Andorra full cup (a fairly versatile fit bra with medium wide wires and medium projection) it may work long term.  It is not super projected though.  Panache Jasmine is much more projected and Panache Envy a little more so, than Andorra.  It would be a great idea to try and get more idea of your shape - the above bras are all a fairly even shape but your tissue may not be evenly distributed and you may need a differently shaped cup."
ABraThatFits,3a1k8d,joanna70,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:13:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I think I'll just have to try on some different cups.   Shape-wise... I cannot for the life of my figure out the difference between shallow and projected breasts :/ Or what mine look like for that matter. I've been staring at pictures all day and it just won't ""click"". I think I'm full on top, but again, not quite sure. Could also be even.  I definitely have broad roots though."
ABraThatFits,3a1k8d,joanna70,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:57:16 2015 UTC,"Right, imagine your boobs are stuffed so they're solid sticking our frmo your chest and lie on your back :D - shallow boobs are a pyramid, not very tall but very wide at the base, very projected boobs are more like a skyscraper.  leaning forwards 90 degrees is a good indicator, when you lean forwards you gain up to 7"" of boob as it were, I'm shallow and I get 1"".  My 1"" really counts, and I in fact fit into a larger cup size than my leaning measurement states, you have a big difference, the larger measurements count less, and you are almost certainly projected.  Hence using the leaning measurement to calculate cup size will overestimate.  WHen leaning forwards 90 degrees see where your nipples point - to your head indicates full on bottom, directly to the floor is even and to your knees is likely full on top.  It's about what proportion of your tissue is above the nipple and what below, and matters most for moderately projected to very projected boobs.  If you have very short roots (and root width and height is a function of projection, or vice versa, very shallow boobs have to be tall and wide, very projected boobs have to be short and narrow) then you may fit full on bottom bras better whatever your actual shape.  Root width is all about wire width, the wires must be wide enough, and root height is about cup shape, I have very tall roots and need an upper edge of cup that does not close in, I have to have half cups because even fot bras still have a shape that is rounded on top instead of almost sticking up.  A few basics but hopefully that will start you off :).  Trying ""diagnostic"" bras (use the search function) can be a very good way of working out your shape, certainly the more bras you try on, especially if their shape is known by the ABTF crowd, the more you'll nail your shape."
ABraThatFits,3a1k8d,joanna70,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:29:56 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, thank you so much! That was incredibly helpful! :) I'm currently pretty overwhelmed by all the different terms and ways how breasts can differ... Here I was thinking that the amount breast tissue you have is the only thing that matters!  Right, so I'm definitely full on top. I think I'm projected but not very much and my roots do look rather wide and tall- though it's a bit hard to see since I still have a decent amount of body fat anyways. Guess I'll know for sure once the weight is finally off! :)   I think I'll be ordering some bras right now and just post a fit check once I have them. Again, thank you so much for your help! :) It's just hard for me to see because I look at my chest and all I see is boobs... A lot of them.   Also, I've been looking at pictures of properly fitted 38DDs (my old size) and wow, yes, I can finally accept that my cup size was way off. Just... Wow."
ABraThatFits,3a1k8d,joanna70,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:58:05 2015 UTC,"If you are wide and tall it means you're on the shallow side and your measurements state the opposite, that when you lean forwards your tissue all falls forwards a lot, so it CAN'T be attached to  wide root otherwise it would stay closer to your chest.  Definitely worth trying Andorra if you can, that's the shallowest I'd suggest trying in your size range."
ABraThatFits,39ztd7,grumpymcgrumpkins,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:59:07 2015 UTC,"The pictures are good :).  I don't think this is too far off, it is hard to tell if the wires are the right width, a certain amount is disguised in a moulded bra as you don't get wrinkling in the cup, which would show more.  Two questions, are you fully swooped and scooped with all your tissue in the cups, and have you got the underwires right up under your inframammary fold?  And then a subsequent one, do you think the wires are wide enough, too narrow, or too wide (which is usually over 1/2"" wider than your breast root)?  I think a 28F would be too small/shallow (Maddie comes up one size small for even shallow boobs plus has a stretchy band), I think your root is possibly very slightly short for this style hence the slight gapping at the top, though moulded bras will gap slightly as you move anyway."
ABraThatFits,39ztd7,joanna70,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:00:24 2015 UTC,"First thank you. Yes, I'm fully swooped and scooped. The answer to the next 2 questions feel like they might be somewhat related. I'm pretty sure I have it right up under, but I feel like the wire might be too wide because the top of the cup, not the wire part but the fabric dug into the front of my underarm. After wearing and walking it felt like i could still reposition the bra back to just under the fold."
ABraThatFits,39ztd7,joanna70,2,Tue Jun 16 11:59:44 2015 UTC,"Okay, so it's possibly a little shallow at the bottom and/or the wires are too wide.  if the strap area digs in it's not about the wire width, it's just that straps on correct sized bras tend to be a little wider than on matrix sizes.  I thought I had a real issue with them, altered a couple but actually it was the roughness of the strap and the closeness of the fit, and I've got used to the wider set straps of my new bras.  If it's the top of the cup outside of the strap then you may need a bra that's lower at the sides (wing height and wire length).  I have to say it looks in the normal range on you, do you think it's something you could get used to?  When starting out, and often with every new bra, you often need to break them in gradually.  I would say you should try some bras with more projection at the bottom, if you really want to stick to moulded then Freya Deco plunge is more projected but a little bit narrower, Parfait casey and Jeanie I believe are slightly wider but still more projected than Maddie.  Cleo Lucy is the classic ""diagnostic"" full on bottom shaped bra but is unlined lace.  I would try 28F and 28FF in Freyas as they are stretchy, not so sure about Parfait, their sizing can be a little erratic, but possibly 30E and 30F to keep the same volume.  Always try two sizes if you possbly can."
ABraThatFits,39ztd7,joanna70,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:39:52 2015 UTC,"It's definitely something I could get used to, especially considering the rest of the fit. I will definitely look into the other styles and do some studying on projection and the like to find one I love. But I'm just glad to finally have the girls contained. I looked up the Maddie and it says the sides are 3"" tall, is this the measurement I would look for a shorter of? Again thank you so much for your input! I feel much better about it this morning."
ABraThatFits,39ztd7,ericazibby,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:54:55 2015 UTC,"Do try pulling that bit of flesh into the cups through the day, it may well migrate back.  Wing height is one factor, wire length is the other if you're looking at bratabase.com, wire length also takes into account the gore height of course, so a long wire with a low gore will be higher than the same length wire with a high gore :).

ABraThatFits,39ztd7,dwellondreams,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:57:29 2015 UTC,I think I can see where you are talking about the cup fabric digging when your arms are down. I would try a bra shape with more narrow wires just to compare not only fit but comfort.

ABraThatFits,3a03s8,TheDodgyStalker,2,Tue Jun 16 06:40:00 2015 UTC,"Their sizing methods are definitely wrong. The sizing guide on their website lists underbust, bust, and overbust measurements and the sizing method appears to either be UB+5 or overbust = band size (the guide assumes your overbust is your underbust +5 for literally every band and cup size combination, idk what you're supposed to do if it's not). The stores use some weird patent pending tape measure that has cup and band sizes marked on it.   Like /u/cleverdistraction said, their cup sizes go up to UK F."
ABraThatFits,3a03s8,hurrrrrmione,2,Tue Jun 16 07:26:02 2015 UTC,"Soma sizing is intensely wonky. It's +5 for sub 32 under busts, +4 for 32-36, +2(I think) for 40-42 and even for 44 bands. Instead of using a straight measuring tape, it's a premade 'fit tape' with bands and cups at predetermined places"

ABraThatFits,39wkzi,nidena,73,Mon Jun 15 11:41:58 2015 UTC,"If you're referring to this thread (sorry if you're not), I would guess that the reaction was strong because it sounded vaguely bodyshaming to connect age with ""droop."" We sometimes get people here and in /r/bigboobproblems who ask ""I'm young but my boobs aren't perky, what is wrong with me, I hate my breasts"" and have a hard time believing that there's nothing wrong with them/that it's a myth that all young breasts are perky."
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,braaccount,43,Mon Jun 15 12:50:29 2015 UTC,"Exactly what was said before. As seen in that linked post, the OP is young and felt hurt enough by the terminology that you provided to comment on it later.  I was one of those 14-year-old girls with pendulous breasts that felt ashamed of the fact that my breasts never stayed up on their own."
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,Inkwell1988,25,Mon Jun 15 13:22:51 2015 UTC,"You know, even I have been told the words I may have used could come off offensive to someone. And I wasn't a new member here, just didn't realise it could come off that way. Our goal here is to have everyone feel safe to talk about their breasts and not put that shape or type down so that everyone is comfortable talking about it. We often may come off offensive to some as people may see our direct language as rude or challenging, when really we usually are just stating something. I understand your frustration, but we just don't want people hurt by something someone else said. I think the way it was gone about was more in a ""Well there are people like that"" way so you don't just change your words but also your perspective on breasts."
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,gliterpoison,22,Mon Jun 15 13:59:21 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to add that I really appreciate the efforts by users here to make this a body positive space and to gently inform users when their language can come across in a negative way. I have pendulous breasts . I'm not sure if they have always been that way or its due to my weight loss 8 or so years ago because I've never taken much notice. They were just my boobs. The only time I ever started feeling bad about them is when I see users here describing them as saggy and droopy and taking a negative attitude. My point is basically that the words you use matter, and all anyone here is trying to do is to prevent those kinds of negative feelings surrounding an already sensitive topic."
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,tiffwilliams15,86,Mon Jun 15 19:08:08 2015 UTC,"I'm new here too, and I took a look at a few (not all) of the recent interactions you've had, just to see what you were referring to.  The vibe that I got was actually a bit different than what you seem to have perceived.  A lot of the time, like with any written communication, it's about your state of mind and how you read it in your head (since you can't actually hear the person who wrote it).    Looking at some of them, I think you may have perceived a hostile intent where there was none.  When looking at reddit posts, unless they are obviously hostile (name calling, etc), I try to read them as constructive.  Just think for a moment about how different intonations can make ""No, that's not the way it goes.  It goes like this"" sound either actually helpful (your friend saying it to help you) or intentionally hurtful (your worst enemy pointing out your mistakes). Since we can't hear the tone in written comments, the helpful intent is often lost in direct messages.    For example, I read through a string where you were referring to drooping/mature breasts, and people were trying to correct the terminology to say pendulous.  The messages I read seemed to be direct, but not hostile.  Just to give you an idea of why they were trying to do that...  many years ago, I happened to be one of those 14 year olds with ""pendulous"" breasts.  And I only went in for a fitting at VS once (and certainly not while I was younger), because what I very quickly learned while trying on bras at every store near me was that most just didn't fit me.  Especially not any that were pretty!  There's a possible reason you would not likely see 14 year olds like that--they're too ashamed to try shopping at a place like VS, because they know nothing will fit right and it's just too painful of an experience.    Bra shopping for me was spending an hour (or more) in the fitting room trying on every single bra in the store in a huge size, trying one size after another (even with a person fitting me...  maybe the sister size will work!) until I either decided that one of the options that didn't truly fit seemed to be the best of the poor options, or I just gave up and left with no bra, which forced me to have to endure that again at another store later.  There were many times I teared up and even cried in the fitting room.  It took many years to get over the stigma that I was built ""wrong"" just because I couldn't find a bra that fit me properly (obviously, 14 year olds aren't supposed to have tube-sock-type, saggy breasts, so I'm just deformed, right?).  So, if someone in the forums had a similar experience, or knew someone who had, then they possibly would simply try to upgrade your vocabulary by recommending a word like pendulous so that you'll have a better arsenal of words at your disposal.    TL;DR:  Try viewing the comments as positive, since intent is often lost in written communication.  Plus a personal story to possibly explain why your experiences at VS may not actually show you the full spectrum of shapes/sizes."
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,ano463s,30,Mon Jun 15 13:20:36 2015 UTC,"Breasts can be a real source of body image issues for women, so we try to use words that cannot be interpreted as body shaming. I know I would dislike it if someone called my breasts drooping, as though they are supposed to be a different shape."
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,goodoldfreda,39,Mon Jun 15 14:39:45 2015 UTC,"I think she was given a break - I don't understand what you mean by ""give her a break"". No one got angry, OP wasn't banned. How are newbies supposed to learn correct terminology if they aren't corrected?   It is true that the poster that corrected her should have gone on to explain that the correct word OP was looking for is ""shallow"". But I think she sounded educational, not chastising.     A quick google of inframammary fold would explain what that is, and I like it because it is an exactly accurate term. I do agree that I dislike IMF though, because I hate when subs use a lot of acronyms without explanation."
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,ilikepai,26,Mon Jun 15 15:54:47 2015 UTC,"Well it's not ""my preferred terminology"" or anything, it's what the sub uses because it is a body-positive sub. Like any sub, we try to use neutral words. There's no denying that ""pendulous"" is neutral whereas ""droopy"" has negative connotations. I mean, no one every wants anything to be droopy, even that poor cartoon dog!   I think it's a good idea to have posters use the same terminology, so everyone knows exactly what everyone else means. What is so wrong about asking OP to use the same word everyone else does? I get that she didn't mean it in a negative way, but on this sub, we use ""pendulous"" so no one interprets OP incorrectly, instead of being like, well, nidena likes to use the word droopy but she doesn't mean it negatively, so just remember everyone, when nidena says droopy she isn't being mean! Why not just use pendulous, like everyone else, so all of that is implied?"
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,ilikepai,14,Mon Jun 15 15:30:33 2015 UTC,"We have tried to find terms that as many people as possible find acceptable and not body shaming.

ABraThatFits,39wkzi,tiffwilliams15,2,Mon Jun 15 17:38:13 2015 UTC,Just from that description I think I know who you are referring to. Thanks for being on top of it. :)
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,joanna70,18,Mon Jun 15 17:45:31 2015 UTC,"I actually think being physiologically correct with IMF is more useful than crease which is a word we use to talk about wrinkles etc in cups, so has a dual purpose.  Sure stuff needs explaining, but specific is good.  Colourway is a real garmet industry standard term, of course it's kinda overstating, but everyone knows what it means.   Pendulous is a word that a good proportion of people will be able to work out what it means, with reference to breasts.  It's technical and non-judgemental which is good.  If we got onto something that is less widely understood, such as tall root, what other terminology would you use to describe that?  What works for one person doesn't work for someone else, so sticking to technical specific terms at least keeps us all on the same page with no ambiguity.  Also when you've been on here a long time, and post a lot with help, it does get boring to have to type the same thing over and over so the language used can become less soft.  If everyone came on here and did a ton of reading, side bar, posts etc, then the responders woudln't have to type over and over, but it's not going to happen, and occasionally people will be a little blunt in their language.  Sorry if it drives you insane, no-one wants it to be a pretentious exclusive club, but specifics and detail are important (eg see how many times ""orange in a glass"" is used the wrong way which is singularly unhelpful for advice givers)."
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,joanna70,-8,Mon Jun 15 17:55:59 2015 UTC,"It's unfortunate that the boredom sets in but when you're an educator, you've got to deal with the tedium and repetition of questions and misuse of language.  It's going to be something that comes with the territory.  Especially when a lot of the concept explanations--in the sidebars, that I read many times, extensively but still didn't understand--aren't that good.  :("
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,KookieBaron,23,Mon Jun 15 19:09:22 2015 UTC,"Well, there's one big difference between us and most educators, they're paid. We're doing this because we want to help, we're not trained educators.  Most people on this forum gain a huge amount from it, I just got a lovely pm today from someone who basically found her ABTF from my advice, but I AM one of the first to correct body shaming language.  A few people will not get on with the culture on here, but over the years we have honed the approach to make it work.  Bra fitting is complex, some of the side bar resources will work for some people but not all for all.  C'est la vie.  We all learn differently.  For instance I find the FOT/FOB thing unclear, I post a lot about the leaning test and if you read around a lot you'll see it mentioned, it can't ALL be in the side bar (we have that debate frequently as well, what should be in it).    If people really want ABTF then they'll put the time in and read around, if they don't want to it's not as if we're letting them down by not being able to help enough."
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,ilikepai,36,Mon Jun 15 15:13:11 2015 UTC,"The responses did seem like patient attempts to educate. If you have questions about the sidebar start a thread and ask them, or message a mod.   Personally, I think your responses seemed defensive and a little rude, perhaps because of all of the caps you used. If you don't want to take ether time to learn the correct terms and such that's fine, just don't give advice if you're not well informed."
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,joanna70,2,Mon Jun 15 15:34:18 2015 UTC,"I'll concede that I'm not well informed about what to suggest instead of VS bras but I know that I can describe the difference between the VS bras.  Granted, I may use the wrong words but that doesn't make me uninformed; it just makes for a limited vocabulary. And I was defensive.  Please see my subsequent comment on this thread, somewhere in the lineup depending upon whether you select Best/New/Top etc."
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,aznphenix,20,Mon Jun 15 16:13:12 2015 UTC,"Mainly because orange in a glass does not mean your breast is too large to fit in the cup. It means your breast is too wide to fit in the narrow cup wires. It's confusing because the bra can be too big a size for you, but because the widths don't match up, it looks too small.     Like any hobbyist group, there is more specific terms. Why is that so hard to understand? Take a look at this askreddit thread about a sentence you can say to people in your hobby, that everyone else would think sounds like gibberish. So if you're getting in to the hobby, you learn the right terms!"

ABraThatFits,39wkzi,joanna70,5,Tue Jun 16 09:32:05 2015 UTC,"Why is that so hard to understand?   A little out of context(since IDK what the person before you wrote, it's deleted) and a bit nitpicky, but since we're kind of on the topic, even if it's frustrating I think it comes across negatively when this phrase is used. I'm not entirely sure what a better approach would be though (to some extent, maybe asking what specifically doesn't make sense if it's still early in the conversation, but beyond that I have nothing)."
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,HootyMyBoobs,3,Mon Jun 15 16:32:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah I definitely agree that it is an aggressive phrase. I was just so frustrated arguing with her through the whole thread! I see now that she was actually a troll and has been banned multiple times, so she must have been purposefully irritating to get a rise out of people.

ABraThatFits,39wkzi,TunaFace2000,14,Mon Jun 15 16:51:51 2015 UTC,"Because it's NOT about your boobs being too big to fit into the cup.  That's a volume issue.  Orange in a glass is a shape issue (wires too narrow, which most people have never even thought of so a visual cue is useful) and is NOT pretentious, you are perhaps not a visual learner, others are, stop telling people how they should learn.  All the different ways of presenting something are useful, and OIG is very specific and very useful.  I'm going to start getting pretty pissed off here, a lot of us spend a lot of time on here, the vast majority of people find it incredibly useful AND supportive, if you don't then perhaps go somewhere else."
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,LadyVerene,11,Mon Jun 15 16:55:18 2015 UTC,"I suppose sagging is an equally valid descriptor as drooping, but I don't want anyone referring as my breasts as sagging either. My breasts have never passed the pencil test, and have steadily continued their downward (and outward) journey as I've gotten older. Pendulous is a good neutral term.   I'm fat, but culture dictates that it's insensitive to just say that to my face. I think it's kinda the same thing here."

ABraThatFits,39wkzi,mailiana,5,Mon Jun 15 16:48:27 2015 UTC,"If you ""pass"" the test (aka the pencil falls), your boobs are self-supporting (""perky"" in terms of the test).

ABraThatFits,39wkzi,joanna70,4,Mon Jun 15 16:53:07 2015 UTC,"I thought the pencil test was to tell if you had big breasts, not pendulous, and passing meant being able to hold the pencil since it meant your breasts were big enough to need a bra. That's how I learned it anyway, lol."

I was a fairly oblivious shy nerd child that didn't interact with many people at all at that age. I was lucky to never be down on my pendulousness at that age because my boobs were a lot like my mom's and that's just how they were. I was much more concerned about the stretch marks. Internet was just starting to be a thing then as well (mid 90s), but I didn't have it till the late 90s, after I was done with high school.   Now I could totally put a soda can under there, and I'm fine with it. It's how I'm built, and I am awesome. And bras are magical lifting devices that make me look good under clothes. :)"

I've been lurking for about 2.5 mo, felt comfortable responding to posts maybe about 1mo or 1.5mo in after I had gotten a hold of the terminology and learned what a good fit is.  The argument I'm understanding is like people using the term ""gay"" as an adjective, e.g. ""That's so gay."" And if the user doesn't know and gets corrected about the power of using positive language, then that's fine. There are different ways to deliver that message and if we're able to get past the defenses we've put up, then we start to learn how the language we use is unhelpful.  I would not say that the community here is ""chastising"" anybody - the mods are really helpful and the other users who try to be helpful can also make the same mistake as you did. Find that space to provide some positive feedback, esp if you can, in a PM.  ""Thank you for letting me know about body positive and neutral terms. However, I felt really ____ by your comment.""  Hopefully that type of messaging will allow the ""helper"" to mend his/her ways and discuss things in a language that is more constructive and less ""chastising.""

ABraThatFits,39wkzi,noys,14,Mon Jun 15 20:33:41 2015 UTC,"I want to post another example of where I corrected someone, and I had to make a real point of it.  I had a private message from a young woman who appeared horrified that she might ""get"" shallow breasts like they were a disease, was there any way she could avoid it happening?  I explained that as someone who had shallow breasts that there is no good and bad.  Now I understood her perspective when she explained it but it was worth me explaining why what she had said could be hurtful.  Luckily it was in a pm, and to me, and I have thick skin, but it was very judgemental and I know she never meant it to be but words are powerful especially when it comes to body image."
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,-tallywa-,9,Tue Jun 16 06:03:09 2015 UTC,"This is similar to the experience I have with conical shapes. Many people with conical shapes don't like their shape and usually say so as in they would like a bras that helps round them out, but I have seen several times people say things like their shape being gross or unnatural. I think it's about realizing that even if you don't like your own shape (or some other shape that maybe a bra has given you) that you wouldn't want someone else to have those same feelings about their body. I have to think about some things when I post them as well! I think we all do!"

I honestly don't feel that anything I really said was rude at all and apparently others agree with me.  Like I said in my last comment in that thread, no one is judging you for not knowing the terms. You asked ""how am I supposed to know"" or something like that, and the point is that other people correcting you and informing you is how you learn. I never implied that you were a bad person or purposefully being offensive, I was simply trying to give you the information to avoid using potentially offensive phrases in the future.

ABraThatFits,39wkzi,ilikepai,8,Tue Jun 16 12:18:05 2015 UTC,"Girls, sorry for interrupting. This topic just seems to be a close one to what I was so long ashamed to ask. I am not a native English speaker and the terms of this reddit are not studied in schools =) , so I'm sometimes confused a bit when choosing the proper term.  How should I refer to the breasts to sound neither too 'scientifically' nor rude? How do you call them when speaking with your close female friends? Is it ok to say 'breasts', 'boobs' or you prefer using some euphemisms? Is there a special word reffering to breastfeeding breasts? Is there something I have avoid to say when discussing bra fitting to not seem too rude or childish?"
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,zeugma25,11,Mon Jun 15 20:11:15 2015 UTC,"I think breasts and boobs are both fine terms to use here. The main issue is when describing a shape of breast tissue. For those types of situations, if you don't know the words for each shape (pendulous, shallow, projected, conical, etc.) then you can just say it may be an issue with shape or even if it is that they are more full on bottom or top you can say that! The key is to not use works that describe the breast as bad or different or any word that could be negative. If you use a phrase and it could be offensive, someone will tell you and it can be edited. Don't worry too much about it. We do understand that everyone makes mistakes!"
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,aznphenix,11,Mon Jun 15 20:55:15 2015 UTC,"I think the only way to learn is to ask :) I wouldn't be offended by someone saying ""droopy"". Then you shouldn't be offended by someone replying, ""actually, we like to use the word ""pendulous"".   The only thing to avoid is saying that something is bad. Like if you say, ""big ugly nipples"" or ""only old ladies have droopy boobs"", it can make someone with big nipples feel bad, or a young lady with droopy boobs feel bad."

ABraThatFits,39wkzi,dwellondreams,8,Mon Jun 15 15:38:52 2015 UTC,"I am a native speaker (I live in the UK!) and I also dislike that breasts sounds 'sciencey' but boobs sounds like slang. Both are used on this sub. I tend to say breasts, but it doesn't matter.   With female friends, it depends. Usually I say boobs, but I said breasts to my co-worker. I'd just say that a woman is breastfeeding, no special word.   Generally, as long as you're respectful, it shouldn't matter. I'd say words that could be read as an opinion about breasts are a no-go. So 'droopy', 'tiny', 'massive' are all subjective terms and could be seen as an insult.  But seriously, don't worry about saying everything perfectly. Personally, I think every non-native speaker I've ever spoken with on the internet is just doing so well. I have a massive amount of patience for non-native speakers."

You guys are right.  Most of the responses that I've received weren't confrontational or [insert other, similar word here].  I was tired and a little sensitive, after being up since yesterday.  Thank you for the patience. For the person who suggested that I start a thread about the sidewall...I did.  My suggestions were shot down.  lol.  It was the one suggesting better pictures (and I used drawings from herroom as the example) and they appear to have been shot down because of a good amount of the verbiage that accompanied the diagrams.

ABraThatFits,39wkzi,turkeysrule,6,Tue Jun 16 06:04:56 2015 UTC,"I gotta be honest, though...when I see pendulous, I think of cow udders.  So, really, pendulous has a negative connotation for me; even if the denotation is correct.  When I see ""droop"" I just think: hanging a little low...like mine...and I love my boobs.  They've been hanging low for decades but they're still awesome."
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,OrosTheDarkElf,5,Tue Jun 16 08:55:55 2015 UTC,"I'm in agreement with you actually. I don't really like the word pendulous either. It makes me think of boobs down to your knees swinging around in a circle. I would just prefer the term 'not perky' personally. It has no negative connotation, but it gets the point across. I don't think droopy is a nice word either, but it's better than pendulous. That's just my opinion though."
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,turkeysrule,2,Tue Jun 16 16:32:31 2015 UTC,"""Not perky"" sounds like there's something wrong with having boobs that aren't self-supporting though.. I would have for my boobs to be called that, especially since mine have never been ""perky""."
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,OrosTheDarkElf,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:53:19 2015 UTC,"I don't really think it sounds like that. It's more like calling a green shirt 'not blue' to me. There's nothing wrong with the green shirt, it's just not blue. That's fine if you don't like that term though. I'm just trying to point out that terminology is usually a matter of personal preference. Unless it's something that's downright body shaming, such as calling small breasts 'mosquito bites.'"
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,joanna70,3,Tue Jun 16 00:39:21 2015 UTC,"I just think it gives off an impression that your boobs are meant to be ""perky"", and by refering to boobs that aren't as ""not perky"" that there's something wrong with them. Like, the standard is ""perky"", but since I have a pendulous shape (and always have) there's something wrong with me.  I get that terminology is personal prefrence, and that when refering to pendulous breasts you have to be especially .. careful, because it's such a sensitive subject for women who have them. The way the media portrays things - there is something wrong with you if your boobs aren't perky, round or just big enough."
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,OrosTheDarkElf,2,Tue Jun 16 09:00:29 2015 UTC,"I can understand where you're coming from. Unfortunately, it would be nearly impossible to find a single term that makes everyone happy. Pendulous doesn't make me happy, but it makes most people happy, so the minority is out of luck. I guess it's just the way the cookie crumbles. Ultimately, breasts come in all shapes and sizes, and there shouldn't be one kind that's portrayed as better than another."
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,turkeysrule,4,Tue Jun 16 09:29:30 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Personally I'm fine with pendulous, because it's not a term that's used in every day life, like sag or droop is. It's quite specific to this community, and not something you'll seen thrown around to describe ""ugly"" or ""bad looking"" boobs.   I definitely agree that one kind shouldn't be portrayed as better than another, but that's the society we live in."
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,LadyVerene,3,Tue Jun 16 09:33:25 2015 UTC,"That's true. In this community, nobody refers to any kind of breasts in a negative way. It's a strict no body shaming zone here."

ABraThatFits,39wkzi,sunny_bell,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:21:31 2015 UTC,"Maybe I just don't see it as negative because I don't see ""perky"" as positive. Both descriptors are neutral to me. Idk, I just wish we could use something besides pendulous because I hate that word."
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,joanna70,6,Wed Jun 17 00:30:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not overly keen on the word 'pendulous', but I much, much prefer it to the word 'saggy'. One of my ex-boyfriends called my breasts 'saggy' and it's stung ever since, and it's been about 8 years since he said it."
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,OrosTheDarkElf,5,Tue Jun 16 13:23:32 2015 UTC,"As pendulous is derived from the same root as a pendulum it IS more objective, droopy or sagging implies some sort of deviation from the norm, an undesirable change over time.  Everyone sees things differently though which is why we try and use the words that we do, as they seem to be the least body shaming for the largest number of people."
ABraThatFits,39wkzi,joanna70,3,Tue Jun 16 14:33:18 2015 UTC,Kinda yea I've been downvoted for I'm assuming saying something wrong but nobody said what exactly was wrong and stuff like that. Like sorry for not being a bra-oligist.
ABraThatFits,39zuj4,MidNightMare5998,3,Tue Jun 16 03:08:10 2015 UTC,"I think the band is likely to be fine, as you tried it on backwards that means more than measurements.  I think the issue may be with the bra somehow, is it fully up into your ""inframammary fold"" at the front, and are you swooping and scooping all your tissue into the cups?  Armpit chub (which I can suffer from) can be a side effect of not swooping and scooping, too small or too narrow a cup, or even not high enough wires at the outisde.  I no longer have to do it so much but I had a lot of spare flesh on the outsides and had to aggressively swoop and scoop for some time, I have now gone up two cup sizes and the wires are wide and the cups almost pull the tissue in themselves."
ABraThatFits,39zuj4,joanna70,2,Tue Jun 16 08:35:09 2015 UTC,"I definitely suffer from some mild-moderate armpit chub. As you said, it probably is some migrated breast tissue. Hopefully as I wear the correct size the same thing will happen to me as it did to you, and it will redistribute to where it needs to be! :)"
ABraThatFits,39zuj4,noys,3,Tue Jun 16 11:38:54 2015 UTC,Sad news for you - molded plunges are going to disagree with your shape most of the time. They are going to be too narrow in wires and too projected in the apex and sizing down because the apex of the cup is empty will mean underwires sitting on breast tissue.  Stick to halfcups and wide demis with the exception of Lepel padded plunges.
ABraThatFits,39zuj4,M_tridactyla,2,Tue Jun 16 10:43:58 2015 UTC,"OP is trying Victoria's Secret bras because she's in matrix sizing, though. I thought virtually everything they carry is wide and shallow, and OP's favorite bra looks like a decent fit?  Anecdotally, I am wide and shallow, and find most of the VS molded bras I've tried (in my ABTF size) to be extremely shallow, particularly at the bottom of the cup."
ABraThatFits,39zuj4,noys,3,Tue Jun 16 17:28:49 2015 UTC,I must say VS is not my strong suit (we've only had La Senza here) but maybe indeed continuing to experiment with VS and possibly Aerie is a good idea.
ABraThatFits,39zuj4,M_tridactyla,2,Tue Jun 16 17:35:31 2015 UTC,Aerie is for sure a good idea!

ABraThatFits,39zuj4,briar_angel,2,Wed Jun 17 22:30:04 2015 UTC,Victoria's Secret bras definitely fit me FAR better than b. tempt'd from Dillard's did. I had to do quite a bit of looking around before I could find anything that was right for me. It does seem like VS bras must be a little shallow because they fit me just beautifully.

ABraThatFits,39zuj4,briar_angel,3,Tue Jun 16 11:40:22 2015 UTC,"I also forgot to add that Gossard plunges are wide and shallow for the most part. Parfait by Affinitas Casey or Jeanie might be worth a try too. Oh, and you fit in the size range of Affinitas. They have lots of good stuff for you."
ABraThatFits,39zuj4,M_tridactyla,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:48:08 2015 UTC,I think you must be doing your measurements wrong somehow... the band still looks wrong. It shouldn't be tight enough that it creates rolls above and below the band from squeezing you so tight. Have you considered having a trusted friend help you measure? I originally got mine wrong too because it turned out I wasn't actually getting the tape straight when I thought I was. I was also squeezing the measuring tape WAY too tightly.
ABraThatFits,39zuj4,briar_angel,4,Tue Jun 16 04:12:34 2015 UTC,"I agree that the rolls made the 32C look like it fit oddly but I think it was due to a shape mismatch + the cups being too small. It looked like extra tissue was being forced out the side because there wasn't enough room in the cup. That's why it's so important to try the bra backwards when it feels tight to find out if it's a band or cup problem.  OP, are you swooping and scooping? It's important, even for us smaller sizes. The idea is to scoop tissue from the side and get it in the cup where it belongs. Btw VS bands tend to be stretchier so I would be hesitant to size up to 34 in that brand without good reason.  I think Natori feathers might be a good bra for you to try if you get a chance."
ABraThatFits,39zuj4,M_tridactyla,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:52:10 2015 UTC,I have been as much as possible. There's a possibility that I didn't do it thoroughly enough in this picture before I took it. I am quite shallow so I have a lot of distributed (and probably also migrated after years of poor fit) tissue to push in.  I'm wearing the same 32D bra right now and it still feels just as amazing.
ABraThatFits,39zuj4,briar_angel,3,Tue Jun 16 11:35:43 2015 UTC,That's certainly possible. I'll do the measurements again in front of a mirror and then possibly ask someone else to do it. In addition to the 34B I did try a 34C (of which I didn't take a picture) but the band felt too loose and I didn't feel supported in the same way as the 32D. I'll definitely keep at it until I get it right.  EDIT: I should also note that in the second picture for the last bra fit (the black 32D VS Demi Bra) I am holding the camera in such a way that the armpit roll seems far more prominent than it actually is in a neutral position.
ABraThatFits,39zuj4,briar_angel,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:18:31 2015 UTC,"I honestly think you should try going up in band and down in cup size. Just look for a bra that offers ""full coverage"" to get those large cups you feel more comfortable in."
ABraThatFits,39ztpj,Amyga17,9,Tue Jun 16 03:01:48 2015 UTC,"So first off, you'll save a lot of money by researching bras before buying in order to try to only buy bras that have a chance of fitting your breast shape. There's a lot of information in the side bar about figuring out shape, but basically--do you think your breasts are fuller on the top or on the bottom? And are they wide-rooted (breast tissue spread widely out on your ribcage) or narrow (breasts more, well, narrow, the edge of your breast stopping earlier)? Are they projected (kind of sticky-outy) or shallow (tissue spread out more)? These questions will help you not spend money on bras that are guaranteed to not fit. And hopefully someone else can explain the shape differences a bit better than I can!  You say you're a college student--do you have Student Prime? Amazon Prime lets you make free returns for purchases that don't work, and Amazon.com has a wide selection of good 30FF bras, including some ""diagnostic bras"" this subreddit sometimes recommends for determining shape, like the Cleo Lucy (for those who are full on bottom) and Cleo Marcie (for those who are full on top).  For cheap bras, I like to go with the second-hand route. There's /r/braswap if you'd like to stay on reddit, and there's also bratabase.com's listings section (which is super useful because it provides measurements of various aspects of the bras being sold, such as the length the band actually stretches too and how wide the wires are). I've had really good experiences with both. If you don't feel like buying a bra that's been worn, I'd still look around--there are plenty of bras being sold NWT (new with tags) that have only ever been tried on, never worn.

ABraThatFits,39zmi1,riannamator,2,Tue Jun 16 02:02:13 2015 UTC,"A bit before and during my period, I get a little bloated, my band may feel a bit tighter, and I experience slight quadboobing in my well fitting bras.  This is more noticeable in my bigger breast, though it isn't enough for me to wear a different size.  This is just my personal experience though, I imagine everyone is different.    Maybe the breast swelling was worse because you skipped a period? I skipped my period once by starting a new bc pack early so I wouldn't have it on vacation, and when it finally came, it was terrible.  It was like all my PMS and period woes times 5.  Perhaps that's true for you as well and your breasts were just extra swollen this time around?"

I'm still a week away from having my period though, so yayyy if I have to deal with this even worse when I do have it. ;o; I just chalked all this up to last week being the week I was supposed to have it, so my body was angry at me that it didn't happen."

When I start spotting, I know it's time to go off my BC to have my period. I've never had terrible periods however.  No boob growth during either. I guess everyone is different."
ABraThatFits,39zmi1,t_maia,2,Tue Jun 16 11:03:14 2015 UTC,"I used to do it a lot and never had problems, but I'd been off bc for probably over a year and just started it up again last month. And right after the first pack I went straight to the second, so since it's been such a long time and the first thing I do is skip a period, I think my body is just not reacting well."
ABraThatFits,39zmi1,Gilliegrl4,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:18:34 2015 UTC,From my experience it is totally normal (say 90-95% of women not on hormonal birthcontrol) to need one cupsize up before your period with the occassional once a year swelling that demands two cupsizes up. Some women regularly need 2-3 cupsizes up but that is relatively rare.
ABraThatFits,39zmi1,teaparties-tornados,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:15:19 2015 UTC,"For me personally, I get a very small amount of quadboob on the larger side of my ""small day"" bra (Cleo Maddie, 30B) about a week before through just after my period starts. The cups on my TLBC Sascha in 30B seems a teeny bit roomy on my small days, but fits perfectly during my bigger days. Thirdlove Plunge Perfect 28C has a lace section over the edge of the cup so any quadboob/gapping that may happen as my size changes throughout the month isn't super noticeable to me. I don't think I've ever noticed that my bras feel different; it's almost entirely the appearance of the fit that I notice changes. I don't have very much boob, so that may play a part in how small the fluctuations are. I'm also not on any sort of birth control, so I don't know is that's something to factor in either."

ABraThatFits,39ylka,spacecharbs,3,Mon Jun 15 21:10:01 2015 UTC,"When the calculator says J/JJ, it means your measurements put you halfway between a J cup and a JJ cup, so either might work for you. This is common.   The calculator and this sub use UK sizing, which is different from US sizing. We do this because different US brands label their cups differently after DD, and UK brands are consistent in how they label their cups.  This chart shows generally which US sizes correspond to which UK sizes, but since US brands label their cups inconsistently, it's not accurate for every brand.   As you can see by the chart, UK sizing gives every letter after E both a single and double option. So the sister sizes of 36H are 38GG and 34HH.  This is the list of bras that Bare Necessities carries in 36J and this is the list of bras they carry in 36JJ  Remember that not all bras fit the same - some have tight bands for their size, some have loose bands for their size, some have large cups for their size, some have small cups for their size, and there are all sorts of cup shapes and bra cuts that fit different shapes of breasts differently. So you're never going to fit right in every bra that's your size, and some bras won't fit right in your size but will fit right in a nearby size."
ABraThatFits,39ylka,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:51:12 2015 UTC,"Sheesh....why is it so difficult? I see a lot of buying/returning in my future. Would you say that sizing/bands/cups are fairly consistent within the same brand? Also, is there a way to figure out if I'm closer to a J or a JJ?"
ABraThatFits,39ylka,hurrrrrmione,2,Tue Jun 16 00:41:40 2015 UTC,"I wish it wasn't difficult but it is. It's worse than jean shopping, unfortunately. The payoff though is that your boobs and back are going to look and feel their best once do you find something that fits, and the bras will be much more comfortable and supportive than your 40DDDs.   Afaik sizing does tend to be consistent within the same brand. www.bratabase.com is great for this - I can look up a specific bra, say Cleo Lily, and the website will tell me if the band is stretchy or tight, I can read reviews from people who have tried the bra and hopefully get an idea if it fits small or big and what shape of breast it works well for, and I can look at the measurements for my size and compare it to bras I've tried on. (For example, my best fitting bra is a 32F and the gore is a little too high and measures 5.6 cm tall, so I can see that Cleo Lily is not going to work for me because in 32F the gore measures 8.0 cm tall.) It can take awhile to learn what the different measurements mean and what you need, but it's super helpful once you do.   The best way is to just try bras on. You'll probably fit best into a J for some bras and a JJ for other bras. The measurements are just a start though - you might end up finding you fit best into a different band or cup size (or both)."

ABraThatFits,39ylka,ariawhatever,2,Tue Jun 16 16:49:41 2015 UTC,"When you see 36J/JJ, that means your measurements are in between two cup sizes. J and JJ are each their own cup size. HH and J are not the same size. Double letters are their own cups in UK sizing just as much as single letters. A 36J/JJ just means you are in between the two sizes and can try either one."

ABraThatFits,39ylka,Shanakitty,2,Tue Jun 16 15:15:27 2015 UTC,"Sometimes the calculator can overestimate in this size range. The laying measurement is often the most accurate, and yours does suggest 36JJ, but does your 36H Marcie still fit well? Because 38G is actually 1 size smaller than 36H (38GG would be the sister size). Also, the other bras that you tried are all fairly shallow, so they may have seemed too small because the shape wasn't right. If your 36H Marcie is too small when you scoop and swoop, then definitely try some bras in 36HH and 36J. If you get a lot of quadboob in the 36H, then you could also try 36JJ.   Also, if Marcie fit you well, some bras that you might want to try are Panache Floris (which is based on the Marcie cut but has a more-supportive 3-hook band), Panache Jasmine (which is pretty narrow and projected with a stretch-lace top that will accommodate your upper fullness), and Panache Envy (pretty narrow and projected, but less so than the Jasmine, also with a stretch-lace top) in 36H."
ABraThatFits,39ylka,Shanakitty,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:44:20 2015 UTC,"I tried the scoop and swoop in the Marcie, and my larger breast did come up too much, but the smaller breast fit fine. I am really looking for something that is smooth and not lacy. It seems like all the bras are lace and sort of....unstructured?....I don't know if that's the right word. The Cleo Marcie seems to make me look very conical, plus it comes up too far for low cut shirts."
ABraThatFits,39xrg8,aboywithgirls,8,Mon Jun 15 17:40:55 2015 UTC,I would say to get a sports bra or a fitted bikini top and put like a surf top over it. That way you get the support but you don't look as feminine as most tankinis would be.

ABraThatFits,39xrg8,Goddess_Keira,8,Tue Jun 16 03:21:11 2015 UTC,"Being honest, I think anything that's labelled as a tankini is going to be feminine-looking, even if it's quite plain and a colour like black or navy. If that were how you wanted to present, it's no problem but since you're wanting to go as masculine as possible, I don't think a tankini is the solution.   My best suggestion is a compression sports bra in a skin tone if possible, or white, and a man's t-shirt or rash guard, with board shorts."

ABraThatFits,39yi8f,aboywithgirls,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:40:41 2015 UTC,"If you like the Freya half cup,  you should check out the Freya Deco molded cup underwire. It's my favorite.  It's completely smooth."

ABraThatFits,39xhe3,321gokat,7,Mon Jun 15 16:29:42 2015 UTC,"The Betsey Johnson bra actually looks quite good, although the molded cup could mask fit issues. Then again, molded cups will always have a bit of gaping when you move. Were you scooped and swooped?   You might fit into Aerie 30D as they are quite shallow, and 28DD, rather than 28E, might work better for you size wise but they're becoming harder to come by. You could try Cleo Lucy, Juna, and Maddie in 28DD, and be sure to scoop and swoop.  Oh, and please don't pull your bra band out from your back! All that really accomplishes is to stretch out the band. You can tell if the band fits correctly when, once you're scooped and swooped and have a correct fit in the cups, the band should feel comfortably snug and supportive, sit level on your back without riding up, and stay put during your normal activities while wearing it. No need to tug on the band.  Edit: I forgot to mention it, but the Deco half-cup actually looked small in the cup on you. I gather you've lost some volume since you tried that bra on, but since it was small at that time, 28E isn't completely ruled out."
ABraThatFits,39xhe3,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:49:56 2015 UTC,"I was s&s yes! they just don't tend to stay where I put them, if that makes sense, haha.  Aerie bras do tend to fit me the best, though I just returned two 32C's because of major gapping at the top... I have looked for a 30C on their website and not had luck. Can you only get them used?   I've lost a lot of volume yes. To me, they look about 1/3 of the size... they looked like implants when I was nursing hence that ""line"" like they were being pushed up too far, but that's just how they were. They were awesome, hahah.   I will look at those other bras you mentioned, thank you!"
ABraThatFits,39xhe3,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:28:18 2015 UTC,"30C is not the easiest size to come by. Aerie might have it online only, in a few styles. The Little Bra Company has it, and they've recently put out a less-expensive line available through Target. I would imagine you can get other Betsey Johnson in that size as well.   I'm guessing the 30 bands aren't snug enough to hold your tissue in place after S&S. Also, the emptiness at the top of the cup is a super common thing after nursing. The breasts lose some of their upper fullness. This almost always means that even in an otherwise well-fitting bra, you get that empty space at the top. Ideally you try to get a fit that minimizes that, but you have to be careful not to go so small in the cup that you get spillage elsewhere."
ABraThatFits,39xhe3,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:43:48 2015 UTC,"Hmm... I bet you're right about the S&S... So perhaps I do need to do a 28 band then. Because the 28 Freya I had briefly didn't budge.   I looked at that little bra company line at targets website earlier today and they were all sold out in 30C. boo. :(  Yeah, and it doesn't help that I've always been shallow and then my boobs get really big for my size and then they go back down. Lots of skin :/ It's a bummer. I guess maybe I should just give up on the idea of a bra that doesn't gap them because of my shape? Or maybe, just make it not so much a priority."
ABraThatFits,39xhe3,gliterpoison,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:57:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's realistic to expect some space at the top of your cups (I get this in all my bras) and look for the best and most comfortable fit you can get, expecting that to happen to some extent."
ABraThatFits,39xhe3,gliterpoison,6,Tue Jun 16 04:09:42 2015 UTC,"I think part of the issue might be your preconceptions on how a bra should make tissue look. The Stocking Stripe looks to fit fairly well, though maybe a little cutting in at the top of the cup. That said, we can't see how the inside fit is since it is a moulded cup. I just wanted to comment here to say that I understand the frustration. I have tried on SO MANY bras that are my size that don't fit. at. all. Don't give up!"
ABraThatFits,39xhe3,vanillabubbles16,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:48:37 2015 UTC,"That could very well be part of the issue. I do wish/want my boobs to look more full at the top, BUT that said, the top of the inside of the cup was empty, and I know that's hard to tell from the photo, but I don't think it's supposed to be that way?

ABraThatFits,39w81l,dwellondreams,3,Mon Jun 15 20:36:00 2015 UTC,Congrats for finding your correct bra size! I am a 28FF that hasn't yet gone to a store and tried any bras in my size. I just got some medium-sized sports bras though that mostly work.

I measured myself last night and got 28c/ 30b. I'm so shocked! I ordered a 30b from aerie and I'm gonna try and find a 28c somewhere and compare the fits."
ABraThatFits,39wg4k,PoliteAnarchist,4,Mon Jun 15 10:35:08 2015 UTC,I think the calculator is over-estimating a bit. I'd look at 34G/GG first.
ABraThatFits,39wg4k,j_sunrise,3,Mon Jun 15 14:17:12 2015 UTC,"You seem to be smaller than the calculator suggests. I think H/HH is a bit overboard even according to your measurements. I don't know a large difference between your sung and tight underbust measurements affects anything though. For your upright bust. I get a difference of 9 inches. For your leaning, I got 10.5 inches of difference. Your lying bust gives 7 inches of difference, but it is so far out from the other two measurements. I would guess a G/GG is plausible."
ABraThatFits,39wg4k,ariawhatever,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:41:56 2015 UTC,That 7in measure may have something to do with the way my boobs sneak into my armpits when I'm laying down?
ABraThatFits,39wg4k,joanna70,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:29:45 2015 UTC,"When looking at shape it's all about relative volume, 2/6 is very different to 3/5, the former is FOB, the latter is FOT.  Have you tried the leaning test?  Lean forwards 90 degrees, nipples will point to your head if you're FOB, to the floor if you're even and to your knees if you're FOT.  Then you can read around a little as there are some great basic bras you can order, certainly in the more likely size range of 34FF-GG."
ABraThatFits,39wg4k,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:29:37 2015 UTC,"Check out the offline retailer to see if they are any bra shops that might carry your size near you. You can also check on Panache's and Freya's websites to see if there are any stores near you that carry those brands.   Amazon has free returns on some bras, and will have free shipping on some as well.   You can also try posting on r/randomactsofbras and checking out r/braswap for cheap bras."
ABraThatFits,39wg4k,Shanakitty,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:32:06 2015 UTC,"34G/GG looks much more likely to me than 34HH. GG is for a 10"" difference (34-44) and HH is for a 12"" difference. With a 4.5"" difference between your bust and underbust, I think you might also want to try some bras in 32GG/H, especially in stretchy brands like Freya. Bands should be firm and not move around much through the day on the loosest hook when new, but also not painfully tight."

I mean,  what would they think about a guy who needs a bra? ? I went in early in the morning at Macy's.  She was an older woman and used the +4 method. She talked me into a 42B.  I had thought,  we'll a B cup isn't all that big, right? I continued to buy this size for a few years. Then my wife convinced me to go to a boutique that she was fitted at and get a professional fitting. I walked in wearing a 42B and walked out in 38F! ! The band didn't ride up back. The puppies weren't trying to climb out. It was great except I had to get used to the increased projection but it was worth it to not have to keep tugging at my bras."

Tissue migration is definitely a thing in her case. We haven't remeasured her yet, but should do it shortly.   The worst thing will be the jump from a DD to an E or F - DDs are easy to find here in Australia, but when you get to E or above the range of bras starts to decrease dramatically."
ABraThatFits,39vpgs,Shepherd8920,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:25:06 2015 UTC,We are very similar! I started get quadboob as well and then quadboob turned into popping out. I did kind of think I was losing my mind or that I had made a mistake from the start. I rechecked my measurements a few times just to make sure but nope. Not crazy.   That sucks about the sizes and it is true here to some extent. Over DD definitely puts us into a size that is a lot harder to find in stores and I am not looking forward to searching all over again.

ABraThatFits,39w2o5,jassykangaroo,2,Mon Jun 15 07:10:01 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, there just aren't all that many options in your band size and cup size, so it's less likely that you're going to find bargains. It's hard but that is the reality. The Keira style by Goddess is available on Amazon for $44 with free shipping and returns. I know from looking at your posting history that you're wanting to spend under $30, but sadly that may not be realistic. You may have to just order one bra at a time, and resign yourself to making bras one of your must-have splurges. One thing about Goddess is that they do have wide wires. A brand that makes your size with narrower wires is Elila. Bear in mind that both Goddess and Elila are in US sizing, so that means you're looking at maybe 44J or 46I.  I notice you were asking about the brand ""Pour Moi"". I don't know a lot about it or if it would be good for you, but from what I can tell they seem to ship from the UK, so shipping and returns would cost quite a bit, unfortunately."

ABraThatFits,39wxet,StronglyPetite,3,Mon Jun 15 13:53:08 2015 UTC,"28E is possible, but I would strongly recommend sticking to the 30DD for now and try different styles to see which ones work best for you. If you're thinking about 28E, then you would almost certainly be ordering on line, and if you're going to do that, you may as well really explore a range of bras in 30DD first. For example, the 30DD you tried might have been a bit shallow in the cup for you. If you're confident that the cups of the bra you tried fit really well, then it's also possible that you were feeling the tightness of getting into a smaller band size, and after having it on for a little while you would feel accustomed to it. If it really fits well, then that initial sense of tightness should go away during the first wearing."
ABraThatFits,39wxet,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:34:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your comment! Yeah, what I tried on was a strapless bra from Debenhams and it was a mega boost multiway bra (which obviously has some padding inside to have a bit of an oomph). I tried this as a strapless without the bra strings. The fitter also let me try another one with less push up but she still gave me the 30DD. So I don't know if this actually makes a difference or not. The less push up one basically fit my cup well. It covered my chest basically and did not have cleavage.... but she said that with a strapless bra it is very hard to have the push up effect kind of. So, I don't think I want something that will cover my whole chest since my cup size is not big. I've never tried a normal bra (t-shirt one) with 30DD as like I said, I went to buy a strapless bra and thought to give a bra fitter a shot. :)"
ABraThatFits,39wxet,j_sunrise,2,Mon Jun 15 19:36:59 2015 UTC,"""Sister size"" just means that it's the same cup size on a longer or shorter band. That doesn't mean those bras will necessarily fit but they might be worth looking at if the band in your measured size is off."
ABraThatFits,39vhff,shecuteoh,5,Mon Jun 15 03:26:43 2015 UTC,"You look like you have short roots, as well.  I don't know on the t shirt bra but try the Curvy Kate Bardot.  It's SS2015 so it's their newer fit with narrower wires and more projection, and it's the most closed off, vFOB-and-short-root friendly bra I've ever met.  It's gorgeous, too.  If you had a gap in that bra I'd be highly surprised lol.  I think these are just the bra style.  The Jasmine looks better than the Helena, which also looks a bit wide in addition to baggy on top.  You might be able to size down in that one."

I'm narrow-ish and projected with soft tissue so I guess the wider aspect of the Envy helps accommodate more breast to ward off quad boob.

At the same time, I often wonder if people say this kind of stuff to make themselves feel better. Sounds like she is fairly busty and is frustrated by people coming in that ""don't need bras"" and probably is one of the millions of people that think bras should hurt so why would anyone who didn't need a bra wear one?"

You are in a similar size to aToTB who has tried on a lot of different padded bras, maybe some of them would work for you. I think she is a bit less projected than you are though, so look for bras that have been too big/deep for her."

I sister sized down to a 32GG, and ordered one cup size larger so the lace didn't pull down on my shape.   But who knew I would be able to get away with a 32H in a ""mainstream"" (not Polish) brand when I measure 4 cup sizes larger? I mean I know it's a combination of it being a very projected bra and the lace avoiding quad boob, but it still seems like magic."

I agree that this is about the right volume but for reasons that I can't quite place it looks like not the right shape for you. Like it's almost expecting a less shallow shape.  I think that there are better shapes from Aerie for you, perhaps you would like Sunnie and Blakely in 32D. I wouldn't go down to a 30D in Aerie, even though the band is stretchy in this model, just because I believe the cups will be too small."

If you are wide and short, or tall and narrow, you are likely to be in the middle of the shallow to projected scale.  Shallow is not a shape as such, not in the same way as FOT/FOB.

What I'll say is that Fantasie is not a go to brand for me - as a person with projected, narrow breasts. But I wear the 4520 (a neutral seam-free, but soft/unlined molded bra) and the Samantha and have been doing so for years. So every brand has potential in at least a style or 2.

Also if you're handy with a needle and thread,  you can turn most normal bras into nursing bras :)  I know you're not a fan of softcup, but depending on your shape inside of a bra, they may offer you the most comfortable fit.

You won't get the same ""look"" from these as you do from your VS bras, but then your body is going to be different during pregnancy, needless to say.   I agree with /u/anonphilia that 38 bands are the way to go right now for comfort and room for expansion as you get further along. All the bras I suggested tend to be fairly generous in the cup, so 38F/FF is probably more likely than 38G. However, you will want to be sure that the cups aren't allowing any spillage because, of course, you have expected growth."

I think you might be comfortable in some 36 bands, but since your ribcage is still likely to change, I think sizing up to a 38 band will get you more bang for your buck right now.   Okay, so...this is just to see what you like, but I'm also trying to find you bras that have free shipping +/- free returns, that way if it doesn't work you're not out too much cash.  Cleo Maddie - Some colors in 38F come with free shipping and free returns  Cleo Juna - same as Maddie; the difference here is that the seam on the front of the cup will allow for more variance in breast shape than the Maddie will. It's still lined - similar to your VS bras - but it's not padded like Maddie.   Panache Porcelain - Similar to Maddie, just different colors :)  Elomi Yolanda - unfortunately I don't know much about how the Yolanda fits, but Elomi is a ""plus size"" brand that starts at 36 bands. The thing I like about the Yolanda, besides the price, is that it's not ""banded"". This means that as you get further along, you shouldn't have any trouble with your belly messing with your bra.   What do you like about these bras? What do you not like about them?"
ABraThatFits,39t5ac,anonphilia,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:13:23 2015 UTC,"thank you so much for taking the time out to send those links! very very helpful!  I hadn't actually thought about my belly interfering with my bra as it grows, thank you for pointing that out so now I can consider that!  I do feel more comfortable with a stretchy 36, but 38 on tighter clasps works too!  I like the Maddie, Juna and Porcelain. And have amazon prime so it would be free to ship quickly as well, which is really nice. I like the back of the Juna, the band is a little wider which seems like it would be comfortable! Porcelain as well. I may have to order one or two of these to try!!   Thank you so much, I wouldn't have found these on my own! Should I go with a 38G in US sizing on these styles? Or the 38F/FF? Seems so crazy to be since I'm used to buying D, my brain is trying to wrap around it actually fitting properly!"
ABraThatFits,39t5ac,alostqueen,3,Sun Jun 14 20:33:31 2015 UTC,"Since these bras are from UK manufacturers, they are sold in UK sizes. So 38F/FF would be where you want to start.  I really like the suggestions /u/Goddess_Keira made, you might see if those are on Amazon as well :)  I know it sounds scary..I used to wear 36C/38B, then lost about 20lb and went to 36B. That was when I found this subreddit and discovered I needed a 32F, not 36B! I've since gained all the weight back, and now I'm at 36E/34F. They'll look really big when you pull them out of the package, but don't be afraid! And remember to scoop and swoop when you put them on :)"

Do you think it digs in because it's too wide? Is the wire the right width but just too tall?"
ABraThatFits,39tnk5,liberatedladies,2,Mon Jun 15 03:35:11 2015 UTC,"For some reason I decided to try tightening the band on the Lucy 30J. I have it on the middle hook and so far, no stabbing in the armpits."

Maybe a bit close set, one finger apart and some gores are to wide. It doesnât really bother me because thereâs no fullness there.   I fully agree on that! You seem to be right in between shallow and projected. This is quite unusual in your size range, but it's a good thing, since you have even more options of bras that might fit you!  Apart from that, it looks like the Cleos fit you just perfectly. Kali is the same as Lucy, but maybe slightly more open on top? The cut is very similar, though.  The Lepel Fiore Plunge looks to me like it might be slightly too small or just too shallow. I'm not sure if I can see quadboob in the middle. If you find it's comfy, I don't see anything against keeping it."
ABraThatFits,39sibs,bracrastination,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:10:00 2015 UTC,"I was confused about my shape because the bras I currently own have different measurements on Bratabase. I guess some of my bras are maybe a bit too shallow, those are the ones that don't fit during PMS.   but it's a good thing, since you have even more options of bras that might fit you!   Do you think so, yes? The biggest problem is filling out the tops of the bras, probably because of my short roots and lack of fullness.  For now I have enough bras, but I can try less shallow bras in the future.  Good to know the fit of the Cleo's is good. I was not sure if the bras had to be tighter on top."

I think the wires on the Marcie might be a hair narrow, but other than that these look good.  I agree about the Lepel being slightly too small or shallow.  Man I think everyone looking for ABTF has tried that bra hahaha!  I know I did, many years ago, when I knew my 32DD's weren't right but didn't know why.  I tried it in a 32E.  Obviously I was way off, but at the time didn't know bands came smaller than 32.  It's a pretty bra!"

ABraThatFits,39tnr9,HowMeFindThis,11,Sun Jun 14 17:47:23 2015 UTC,"Another idea might be to buy some brand new bras per advice of this sub. If the tags on one of her bras has faded so much it you can no longer read it, it might be time to just get new bras. The elastic in bras stretches out over time, and then they no longer provide sufficient support. Also, if she has been fitted in a store it is very likely that the person who did the fitting has been incorrectly trained, or just gave her a size they had in store. And breasts can change size and shape over time, so it's always a good idea to regularly check if bras still fit properly. So if you and your SO are interested, you could start reading up in the beginner's guide and take her measurements!"

I had a spot like this due to an incorrectly placed cast and it needed treatment, still have the scars.  Also please stop wearing the Marcie until the spot is gone.    Or does this mean the sides are too short for me?    Yes, too short.   Panache Ariza might be a good option, but note that you probably need it one bandsize up (if you wear 36HH in Marcie you need Ariza in 38H).  Other Panache bras with a similar wire height as Ariza and Tango are also worth looking into, but I don't know the models. Hopefully Bratabase can help.   Another option can be deeper cups and or softer wires. If the cups are too shallow, I get tissue pushed into my armpits and thus more pudge that spills over the wires. With deeper cups this gets less. Softer wires also help reduce any poking. So maybe give Freya/Fantasie a shot.   Some people also had luck with Gorgeous by Debenhams."
ABraThatFits,39ui1j,t_maia,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:36:01 2015 UTC,"o_o dead tissue? What? Really? I'll have to email my doctor and ask her about this.  I do not mean this personally (at all!), but there's no way I'm wearing a typical 38 (stretching to 40""+) when a 36 is needing to be tugged down in back on the tightest hook. I wore a 38 band 30lbs ago.   Ariza in 38H has much less depth than the Marcie I'm wearing (a difference of roughly 2""), based on my bra's measurements just now of 15.75"" or so and those for Ariza on Bratabase. If I look at 38HH or 38J Ariza for enough depth, the wires get ridiculously wide (for me - my Marcie is about 6.8"" wide). I've tried the Tango in the past, and it did not work for me at that time (shape, etc). And Tango's sizing is frustratingly inconsistent, from what I've tried and read on Bratabase.  I actually tried your advice in the past on finding wires narrow enough and tried the bras/sizes you recommended, going up in the band and down in the cup, and... well... the results were comical and not wearable at all. At this time, I don't think that would really work out for me. I need a firm band for support. I appreciate the suggestion though.  In my experience, softer wires don't provide enough support, and my boobs just get pulled east-west. Not comfortable, and not my aesthetic.   Thank you so much though, and I'll have to ask my doc."

Ok, just took the size from your flair. If you are closer to a 34J now in Cleo Marcie you'd need the Ariza in 36HH. Trust me, the Ariza has a really firm and non-stretchy band, the majority who wear this bra get it one bandsize up from their regular size.    Panche Emily would be another option, it also tends to run snug, but not as snug as Ariza.  But if Ariza is too shallow and you need deeper cups, Gorgeous by Debenhams or Polish bras is the way to go."

Last I checked, my tight underbust is exactly 36, give or take if I've eaten yet haha. But the 36 bands I've tried all seem about right; it's this Marcie that has stretched a bit with all the wear that I'm tugging down all the time. I'm sorry if I wasn't clear.  I had an Emily when I was 38J, it was my house bra for sure! Comfy and sturdy. Not the shape I like at all, haha, but it was great for when I wasn't trying to impress anybody. It turned out the wires were way too wide, but it wasn't so bad for doing chores or whatever. =)  I wish I could manifest the money to try various EM bras. I was hoping to manage with Cleo but EM seems like what I need."
ABraThatFits,39ui1j,t_maia,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:55:13 2015 UTC,Personally I wouldn't recommend georgous bras they are very tight....I would probably need a 34 as a 30 measures 24 inches and stretches to 24.5 inches the wires dig in and I have a complete shape mismatch but that's just me personally

ABraThatFits,39qzdd,NornaNoo,11,Sat Jun 13 22:16:51 2015 UTC,I went bra shopping in M&S today (for any UK people out there it's 20% off all bras this weekend!). These 2 bras were in the sale. The Longline is 30DD and the other is 30D. I though the longline felt a bit loose so I compared the band to the other bra! I bought it anyway cos it's really cute and the cups fit nicely and it was only Â£5 so I reckon I can shorten the band...
ABraThatFits,39qzdd,fexxi,2,Sat Jun 13 22:19:05 2015 UTC,"Wow that's a huge difference in band size, is the bottom bra material a bit stretchier?"
ABraThatFits,39qzdd,intangiblemango,2,Sun Jun 14 00:46:28 2015 UTC,"Nope, they both stretch about the same amount so the top one is way longer when stretched."
ABraThatFits,39qzdd,eriophora,7,Sun Jun 14 07:46:01 2015 UTC,How do they compare when stretched? Does it get any closer?
ABraThatFits,39qzdd,shushbow,2,Sat Jun 13 23:34:42 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I can't get a picture of them stretched as it takes 2 hands and I'm on my own but I did have a go and the top one is still very stretchy and stretches to a good 15cm longer than the other.
ABraThatFits,39qzdd,dwellondreams,4,Sun Jun 14 07:45:32 2015 UTC,Perhaps it was mislabeled? That's a pretty huge difference!
ABraThatFits,39qzdd,dwellondreams,2,Sun Jun 14 01:59:14 2015 UTC,I checked the label inside the bra when I tried it on and saw the difference. It says 30DD inside but I think it must have either been mislabeled or  mistake with when it was made. That's probably why it was on the sale rack.
ABraThatFits,39tt7d,StronglyPetite,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:33:22 2015 UTC,"The cup size was too small in the 30d so your body couldn't fit it in and the whole thing felt too small. Does that makes sense? In the 30dd, there was enough space for your body to fit comfortably."
ABraThatFits,39tt7d,SexyGeniusGirl,2,Sun Jun 14 19:33:08 2015 UTC,Yeah it makes sense :) ! Thanks for your comment!
ABraThatFits,39tt7d,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:30:26 2015 UTC,"Well, the difference between 30D and 30DD is one cup volume. There certainly should be a difference because they are different sizes. You were fortunate to have a good fitter helping you! SexyGeniusGirl expressed it pretty well, but as an analogy, think of two pairs of shoes, exact same style; one pair is 7B and one pair is 7C. You would certainly expect the 7C to be wider and looser than the 7B, right? It's a wider size. And if you need a size 7C shoe, then 7B in those same shoes is going to be too tight and small."
ABraThatFits,39tt7d,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:26:02 2015 UTC,"That's explains it pretty well!! Yeah to be honest, I was so grateful for the fitter to help me this much, she was really nice and since it was the first time ever to have a fitter helping me, she really made me feel calm. But with the shoe example, it explains it pretty well :). Would bikini size be the same though? I bought mine 30DD, like the one that fit well with the bra. Thank you!"
ABraThatFits,39s0r0,MissAndisBoobs,3,Sun Jun 14 04:52:04 2015 UTC,"If Cleo Erin wasn't too narrow for you you have narrow roots, absolutely no question about it.

ABraThatFits,39s0r0,M_tridactyla,2,Sun Jun 14 15:31:03 2015 UTC,"Good thinking about the 28 band! If you get a Deco get one of the ones with something after Deco (like Vibe or Delight), they have more closed top edges."
ABraThatFits,39ryl5,deck-neep,8,Sun Jun 14 04:24:05 2015 UTC,"So, I'd say this fit has a couple of problems but isn't too far off overall. I think the bra is working its way out of your IMF as you have it on for a bit of time, so that isn't ideal. But with a push-up type bra, as this is, the wires really can't sit perfectly in the IMF because there's extra padding between the underwire and your IMF, so the padding rests directly under the IMF and the underwire gets pushed down by that.  Looking at the side view, the wire width looks pretty good as far as I can tell, but it appears that the cup is lifting up off your chest a little, suggesting the cup is a bit small.  Looking back at your measurement check, the smallest size indicated by your measurements would be a 36D, and the 34DD is a sister size of that. It has the same cup volume but is a little smaller in the band. The band sits nicely here, so at least in this bra a 34 band is fitting you. I don't know if VS makes any of their bras in 34DDD; if this one is, I think you could use that extra cup size up. I think you're most probably a 34DDD in US sizes or 34E UK."
ABraThatFits,39ryl5,Goddess_Keira,3,Sun Jun 14 05:49:15 2015 UTC,This is some awesome information. I like the way a 34 band fits me. I was wearing 36B and the 36 band just felt too big (it also might have been worn out).  I didn't see any 34DDD while I was shopping in the store today but I think they sell them online. I'll check that out along with some other brands and stores.  Thanks for the help!
ABraThatFits,39ryl5,Goddess_Keira,3,Sun Jun 14 06:03:45 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! I was actually just checking on line and they have some sales on now--did you get that bra for $16.99 by any chance? It looks to be on clearance for that. If so, and it's comfortable to wear, I don't think you'll go too far wrong in it. VS bands are known to be quite stretchy, so it's not surprising that the 34 felt better, especially as you're getting into a better cup volume.  I noticed they have the Body by Victoria line on for 25% off and at least some come in DDD. If you like the VS bras, now is a good time to try some of those. I'd suggest you try the Body by Victoria Full Coverage bra (it's not any more full coverage than this one, really), and then possibly the Demi bra (both lightly lined but not push-up from what I can tell), or the unlined Demi. It would be interesting to try them in 34DD and 34DDD as all of those come in that size, so you could compare the cup sizes. But it would be great too if you branched out into trying some other brands in the future."
ABraThatFits,39ryl5,gliterpoison,2,Sun Jun 14 06:30:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the one I got was on sale for $16.99 and I had a $10 off coupon so I got it for $7! Haha  Oh man, that is so tempting. I'll check some out before the sale is over then! I could probably find some 34DDDs at Ross for pretty cheap too. They occasionally have some good quality bras in stock.  Thanks again!"
ABraThatFits,39ryl5,gliterpoison,2,Sun Jun 14 07:11:32 2015 UTC,I agree on the Body by Victoria in demi (lightly lined or unlined) They are both close fits for me and would fit even better if I had a slight bit more tissue lol. I personally don't fit the full coverage as I don't have a lot of upper fullness but it could work for you.
ABraThatFits,39ryl5,nidena,2,Sun Jun 14 15:09:42 2015 UTC,I'm going to try on some of them on next time I'm at VS. I like the way lightly lined and unlined feel. They feel more free than push up bras haha

ABraThatFits,39ryl5,-tallywa-,27,Sun Jun 14 06:52:50 2015 UTC,"There's not really such as thing as ""more mature"" breasts... Pendulous breasts (what you're referring to as ""droop"") is a breast shape that can occur at any age and is perfectly normal at any age. Not all women develop a more pendulous shape (or experience ""sag"" as many refer to it as); that's really quite dependent on genetics, pregnancies, breast feeding, etc."

ABraThatFits,39ryl5,nidena,-16,Sun Jun 14 22:30:21 2015 UTC,"When I think of PINK, I think of 14 year olds so to describe the breasts of someone OLDER causes me to describe their breasts as MORE MATURE.

I don't tell you this to villainize you -- but to make you aware that a) teenagers with pendulous breasts exist and b) man, they are paying attention to these messages. I'm nearly 30 and I still have a hard time appreciating and loving my breasts for what they are, because I perceived them as utterly imperfect."
ABraThatFits,39ryl5,scatteringashes,-9,Mon Jun 15 15:00:54 2015 UTC,"Here's a thought: Maybe I didn't know to say that PINK is for shallow breasts.  Maybe my brain can't wrap it's head around shallow or projected and so went with the synonym for pendulous which, for the love of hades, is droop. Also, maybe I went with droop and more mature because that's what my boobs do and are and I wouldn't even attempt to try to fit into a PINK bra."
ABraThatFits,39ryl5,noys,13,Mon Jun 15 15:19:46 2015 UTC,"No one is blaming you for not knowing... No one knows everything when they come here. But when you use terms that are potentially going to make someone feel bad about their breasts, you're going to get corrected. And that's okay. Now you do know that a better way to describe it is shallow. There's no need to get upset about being corrected. One of the goals of this community is to be accepting to everyone so comments that make it sound like pendulous breasts are only for older women don't really help with that.  Using droop as a synonym for pendulous isn't really that bad, especially when trying to explain the concept to someone who is unfamiliar. However it can still make some feel badly about their breasts because ""droopy"" isn't necessarily a desirable quality in many women's minds. Pendulous is more neutral and so is preferred.  Like the other user said, people don't correct others in order to villainize them but rather to inform them. This place is about learning and it's actually in the rules not to take things personally when you're corrected."
ABraThatFits,39ryl5,mischiffmaker,5,Mon Jun 15 16:14:15 2015 UTC,"First: my comment had a lot more to do with you saying, ""No fourteen-year-old has breasts like this,"" because from what I can tell on this sub, more than one of us entered puberty with pendulous breasts.   Second: You can continue to use ""droop/mature"" if you want; that's none of my or anyone's business. But while ""droop"" is accurate enough, it comes with an implied value application even if that's not how you meant it. ""Pendulous"" doesn't tend to (though it's not my favorite, frankly, but at least it's more clinical than ""droopy,"" IMO). And ""mature"" is just flat-out inaccurate, re: the first point. That is just the wrong word to use.   I understand that you feel attacked, and I'm sorry that you do. Arguing about why you used the words you did is irrelevant, though. Especially because what I really care about is the inaccurate idea that teenagers all have some uniform breast type."

ABraThatFits,39ryl5,hurrrrrmione,3,Mon Jun 15 17:25:06 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah, but what sets mature breasts apart is the softness. The droop is also more similar to pendulousness caused by losing weight (rather than having it from the start) as it has similar components of losing fullness and skin not being elastic enough to catch up with it, but even more so in older age due to smaller quantities of elastin being produced in skin.  Pendulousness is usually caused by breasts just being too projected and having a too small root area to be able to support themselves."

ABraThatFits,39ryl5,hurrrrrmione,2,Sun Jun 14 08:06:55 2015 UTC,In the first and fourth pictures I can see indentations in your skin below the underwire - is that from this bra?  Did you scoop and swoop? Is the underwire in your IMF?
ABraThatFits,39skhj,Thwabtf,4,Sun Jun 14 10:12:58 2015 UTC,"IMO it is far too shallow for you, and I don't think 30FF will work for you - why have a strapless that is more full coverage than a regular bra?   I would look for ""seamed"" strapless bras. That is that the cups are not molded per se, and have different sections, similar to a softcup bra. I don't think there are many made in this style, so unfortunately none come to mind for you to try."
ABraThatFits,39skhj,anonphilia,2,Sun Jun 14 15:09:00 2015 UTC,I would give Curvy Kate Luxe strapless a try in your normal size.

ABraThatFits,39rj41,boba-boba,5,Sun Jun 14 01:32:03 2015 UTC,As 32D isn't particularly small in band or large in cup I'd suggest doublechecking your size. Does 28FF or 28G look more similar to your proportion?  No matter how good a sports bra you buy if the size isn't right it's not going to do the job right.
ABraThatFits,39rj41,noys,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:35:15 2015 UTC,"There is no way a 28FF or 28G would fit me. I am relatively shallow with narrow shoulders - most bra straps cut into my armpits or fall off my shoulders if the straps aren't set in the center. Here is my thread with me wearing my favorite bra. I recently bought one of the Betsy Johnson t-shirt bras and those fit really well, too.  If 32D isn't particularly small/large in comparison, then my problem is I have narrow shoulders and most cups are too wide for my frame."

ABraThatFits,39rj41,Shanakitty,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:35:35 2015 UTC,Why I thought of Ultimate Run is because there have been some triathletes in the subreddit who swear by it.
ABraThatFits,39rj41,noys,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:14:10 2015 UTC,"32D is medium-band, small/medium cup.  Hmm, I saw your measurement check, so it does seem that you have narrower shoulders than most 32 bands expect if you have problems with straps falling off/cutting into your armpits. If you are also having problems with cups being too wide, perhaps you are less shallow than you thought? It is rare to be both shallow and narrow, since shallow breasts are, by definition, more spread out than projected breasts with the same volume, but perhaps you have tall, narrow roots. If you haven't already tried some narrower, more projected bras (like Cleo Lily? I'm not very familiar with this size range, unfortunately), you might try a couple and see how those work for you, or try some bras in 30DD with an extender, since those should be designed for a smaller ribcage."
ABraThatFits,39rj41,Shanakitty,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:58:17 2015 UTC,30DD with an extender will force the straps even more apart.
ABraThatFits,39rj41,Pippyn,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:07:47 2015 UTC,"Ah. I thought they might be set narrower in the front at least (to avoid the armpit cutting), but I can see where they might end up wider in the back."

The one thing you can get at a boutique - that you can't get online - is personal attention and (when it works) fitting expertise. Of course, no one's obliged to buy in store - but if you like what you try, and you've received good service from the fitter, it's only polite to consider a purchase. You basically told her you'd be wasting her time."
ABraThatFits,39r9yb,KristinM100,2,Sun Jun 14 00:43:28 2015 UTC,"Nicola doesn't look particularly torpedo-y to me, it has a soft rounded point that actually can be very flattering under clothing. Did you try it with your top?  You're wearing the Andora a bit too low, if you look at the area below your left breast the cup is collapsing and creasing where the breast root actually is. The underwires should be exactly at the breast root, you need to actively position them when putting on the bra. If they slide down overtime there's a shape mismatch.  The Empreinte looks really nice but I'm worried about underwire positioning again, it's really hard to tell based on photos of a black bra taken against the light."
ABraThatFits,39r9yb,noys,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:30:58 2015 UTC,"About the Andora... You're saying it could be creasing because it's not projected enough on the bottom?

ABraThatFits,39pjdu,aboywithgirls,2,Sun Jun 14 18:52:57 2015 UTC,"This happens to me, too, and I'm 5'0. The only bra that has ever come close to fitting properly is the Cooling Bra from Lane Bryant. Aside from the straps, the only fit issue I have is that the cups need to be farther apart, and the cups need to be less angled.  It's the closest thing I have ever found with what precious little income I have right now, though.  But the strap issue happens to m, too. Eventually the weight of my chest and normal movement pulls on the adjuster clip, and the straps loosen. I am seriously considering sewing the clips in place. My only guess would be that they straps aren't elasticized, so they don't adjust to your movement."
ABraThatFits,39pjdu,dee62383,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:00:42 2015 UTC,This happens to me and I always wondered if it was bad posture. I tend to slump my shoulders forward which would shorten the distance the bra strap needs to cover.
ABraThatFits,39qhag,throwaway4boobz,3,Sat Jun 13 19:34:23 2015 UTC,"You seem to be pretty close-set at the top of your breasts, so tall balconette gores like Lily has may just not agree with your shape.  I think Casey looks how it does because you are tremendously projected compared to what shape the bra is designed for; it's a shape mismatch. Of course it's too small as you recognized, but I think it would behave similarly even in a larger cupsize."
ABraThatFits,39qhag,M_tridactyla,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:20:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I agree that the Casey isn't the right shape. Like I said, I've had it longer, aka before I understood shape stuff... oops lol. Tremendously projected, huh? Thats good to know. I was starting to guess that, thanks for the confirmation!  Is is a terrible thing is the lily gore doesn't tack 100%? It does on the bottom and mayyybe it will in a different size? If it comes closer to tacking in a bigger size, would that be good enough?"
ABraThatFits,39qhag,M_tridactyla,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:24:25 2015 UTC,"Definitely try it in a bigger size. Some women with close-set breasts find it painful when the gore sits on breast tissue, or when the gore wrinkles and doesn't sit flat, but if that doesn't happen to you it's probably all right. If the gore twists to fit in sideways it can cause some cup wrinkles though.  There are also some tutorials for making gores narrower that you can find by searching this sub."
ABraThatFits,39qhag,buymeflowers,2,Sun Jun 14 02:07:37 2015 UTC,"32G is probably going to be spot on, Lily looks about 2 cup sizes too small.  You could retry Lily and Deco, but I wouldn't necessarily retry Casey anytime soon -- it's already pretty wide on you, going up 2 cups will only make it worse.  Cleo Marcie and sisters would be a good bet. Quite a few Panache bras would likely work as well. There might be a few Masquerades floating around on Amazon yet, and you could also give some SS2015 Curvy Kate's a shot (Jewel, Bardot, Starlet and possibly Smoothie would be where I'd start).  Based on the fit of the Lily, your roots are probably on the narrower side of the spectrum."

I ask because all of that will affect the accuracy of the measurements. It seems unlikely that she would go up a band size after losing weight unless she's been doing a lot of strength training or her current bras were uncomfortably tight when new.  Since she's currently getting gaping, does she scoop and swoop when putting on bras?   Could you get her to look at the shape guide and try to get an idea of her shape? Shape is just as important as size when determining fit. It's ok if she isn't 100% sure right away, as the easiest way to determine this is by trying on bras, but it can help us give some more specific suggestions to point her in the right direction."
ABraThatFits,39pyoc,Shanakitty,3,Sat Jun 13 16:59:09 2015 UTC,She was naked/no bra but I was standing behind her as she positioned the tape and I read the measurement from the back  No she doesn't scoop and swoop. I'm out of town so I only have 3G which mean web pages don't want to open but she's the shape that hangs downwards more.  I don't remember what that is actually called. She has gone up and down in weight a lot so it's possible the band was super tight. It also looked worn out
ABraThatFits,39pyoc,hurrrrrmione,3,Sat Jun 13 17:13:46 2015 UTC,she's the shape that hangs downwards more.   Pendulous! :)
ABraThatFits,39pyoc,Goddess_Keira,3,Sat Jun 13 22:00:23 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you'll see this before you go out, but at an estimated size of 36DD, she's in the matrix so when you hit Nordstrom I'd suggest to have her try on whatever bras are available in and around that size, for starters. If you see anything in 36DDD/E, 36F, and 38D/DD  that's probably worth trying too. VS bands are very stretchy, and you say hers is worn out so if you measured it stretched out, it would probably measure more than the intended 36"", but since losing weight she might be okay in a 36 band, too.  I'm thinking that since she's accustomed to VS, their bras have a very different aesthetic to many bras you'd be seeing at Nordstrom. She may be resistant to that. But encourage her to try on different styles and looks and take notes of what she tries in what sizes, how it fit. Take pictures if you have a chance and she'll let you--you don't have to post them of course, but for her and your reference as to how certain bras fit her, and take pictures of the tags so you'll know what she tried. From your description, it sounds like her breasts are pendulous with soft tissue, which is pretty typical after the combo of a couple of pregnancies, breast feeding, and significant weight loss.  Different Nordstrom stores seem to have widely varying stock, but look for brands like Wacoal, Freya, Fantasie, Elomi, Goddess, Panche, and Cleo by Panache."
ABraThatFits,39qa3m,gfpumpkins,2,Sat Jun 13 18:31:37 2015 UTC,"The Freya bands are definitely stretchy, and they get stretchier the more that you wear them.

Sometimes if the underwire is too low, you can look like you're gaping at the top even though the  bra is actually right?"
ABraThatFits,39punf,Siobhanskies,2,Sat Jun 13 16:16:50 2015 UTC,"What bras are you wearing in 30DD? If they are stretchier bands then that makes some sense, or if they are worn out.

Having projection but not immediate projection means that your breast tissue gradually becomes projected and most of the projection comes from the center. I can attempt to draw a picture of what I think is correct if you need me to.  Edit: This comment is helpful

ABraThatFits,39nd01,MutantToenail,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:09:21 2015 UTC,Right. But what's the difference between projected breasts with immediate projection and projected breasts without immediate projection?
ABraThatFits,39nd01,MutantToenail,11,Sat Jun 13 03:39:29 2015 UTC,"Breasts with immediate projection start sticking out right at the bottom. Without immediate projection, breasts start out shallow around the edges and then get more projected toward the middle.  Here's some pictures. They're metaphors, OK?  Mantel with immediate projection  Mantel without immediate projection"
ABraThatFits,39nd01,boo_hiss,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:32:10 2015 UTC,"As I understand this, shallow vs projected is about how far out the breast stands overall, generally through the apex. The idea of immediate projection is about how suddenly the cup needs to project outward from the underwire/band. So, it's possible to be averagely overall/apex projected and need immediate projection in the lower cup.  As far as how to tell, try on bras. A bra known to be shallow can crease or ride down if it's not bottom-projected enough (creasing is more common, especially in molded cups, while riding down or wearing too low can be other things). Shape's hard to figure out sometimes."
ABraThatFits,39nd01,khasiv,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:07:25 2015 UTC,"I am under the impression that the immediate projection question is somewhat controversial. I think it is possible to get bras with enough projection for ""immediately projected"" breasts with depth in the lower part of the cup. Basically, breasts that want lower space (regardless of shape really) need somewhere to put that tissue. If the shape of the cup is right then the breast can go forward and the wires can go up without sliding down. Issues of immediate projection could be issues unrelated to how the cup comes out of the wire."
ABraThatFits,39nd01,noys,3,Sat Jun 13 12:03:24 2015 UTC,"It still does matter, the deciding factor is breast tissue firmness. Softer breast tissue will happily redistribute as long as there's room but firmer breasts are more demanding."

On this chart, I'm a 2/5: http://i.imgur.com/VPH5K0E.png It's even more difficult to determine because 2/5 is when I'm nude.  I think I remember reading that fullness is determined when wearing a bra not when nude.  If that's the case, then I'd be a 3/5.  Anyhow...I wonder if the ""4"" constitutes immediate projection."
ABraThatFits,39nd01,HootyMyBoobs,1 point,Sun Jun 14 07:06:00 2015 UTC,I am personally a 2.5/6. I absolutely need bottom projection as a 6 as even lifted in a bra my breasts hang a bit below the underwire and will absolutely fold at the wire even though I have softer tissue. Even  hand lifting them up all the I still have tissue trying to dip down below my IMF. Out of a bra I also have my apex below my IMF (a little bit).
ABraThatFits,39nl2q,dreamintechnicolor,16,Sat Jun 13 00:59:41 2015 UTC,"As I said, I usually wear 36B.   36B is meant for a bust of 94 cms or approx 37 inches. That is smaller than your underbust.   You got a 4 to 5 inches difference between your loose underbust and your bowed forward bust measurements which indeed points to a D/DD cup.   Going by traditional plus 4 sizing methods you'd be in a 44A. I hope we can both agree that this is not very large.   But a 44 band would be too loose for you. So sistersizing a 44A to a 38band I get 44A -> 42B -> 40C -> 38D. Still not huge.  Check out this collage of real D/DD and G/GG cups.   You also might want to read up on shallow shapes. If you still don't believe me, talk to u/gliterpoison please, she is in your size range."

ABraThatFits,39nl2q,agent-99,5,Sat Jun 13 03:17:53 2015 UTC,"you experienced what is called ""sticker shock"" once you start trying on bras in your true size, you'll understand and feel better!"
ABraThatFits,39nl2q,Gilliegrl4,13,Sat Jun 13 10:23:22 2015 UTC,"I'm unfamiliar with this size range, but here are some pictures (nsfw) of women wearing 38D, which is one of the sizes the calculator recommended, and 38E, which is one cup size larger than 38DD. Not as big as most people and the media make those size out to be, right?"
ABraThatFits,39nl2q,grandteton,3,Sat Jun 13 01:16:58 2015 UTC,The 38E definitely looks larger than I am but the D looks about right! It's definitely not how the media makes them out to be!
ABraThatFits,39nl2q,gliterpoison,10,Sat Jun 13 03:27:21 2015 UTC,"The media likes to make people think DD is huge (also to just forget about  the band size). I am just about at the end of available cup sizes and people  will guess an F because that's  what they consider ""porn star size""."
ABraThatFits,39nl2q,gliterpoison,8,Sat Jun 13 07:17:55 2015 UTC,"/u/t_maia Thanks so much for mentioning me!   Guess my first question is a shape question. My best is you are closer to a shallow or a conical shape, or a mix of both. Shallow shapes are when the breast tissue is spread out over the chest more than your ""standard projected"" breasts. Conical is classically what is thought of as pointy/triangular rather than rounder.   I can tell you that I went from a Victoria Secret 36B to a well fitting 36D. my original measurements left me with a 38DD/E I think and I ended up in a well fitted 38C in a band that isn't stretchy. In a bra that is, I wear a 36D.   A few weeks ago I remeasured and it came out (My snug is 37.25, Tight 34, standing 42, leaning 44, and lying 40.5) as a 36DD/E but those don't seem to fit me well and I am comfortable in a 36D but would be willing to go to a different size if the bra fit. The key to this whole thing is using the calculator as a GUIDE to your most comfortable fit, not always your perfect fit but I would still try it first.   As a conical woman, I understand the frustration. My boyfriend was amazed by the difference in my breast in a fitted bra. I now have more shape even without a bra on.   What I want to ask you to do is this:  Do what we call a swoop and scoop in your bras now to see how they fit. It is what you should be doing every time you put on a bra. So you lean over in the bra, hold the wire with one hand and with the other, lift the breast tissue up and into the cup. The wires should be in the fold all the way up next to the breast tissue, and your tissue should not touch your chest when they are correctly on. :)  You may find that you not longer fit in your bras once you try them on the right way :)"
ABraThatFits,39nl2q,blizzard07,2,Sat Jun 13 02:10:49 2015 UTC,"Based on what you said I guess I'd be shallow. Right after I take off my bra it's usually more round but then after it's been off a while they're kind of conical. I was in Victoria's secret today and picked up a 38C and it looked so huge. I said there was no way I'd fit in it! Are Victoria's secret sizes somehow larger than they should be? I do do the scoop and swoop! It was actually after I had done that like usual and wore a rather loose top that my friend said I was ""busting out"" of my bra and should go to this Subreddit and find a better size.  What brand of bra do you wear that fits nicely?"
ABraThatFits,39nl2q,dee8,5,Sat Jun 13 03:24:10 2015 UTC,"VS Bras will look big as they are moulded and usually have padding. In an unlined bra they don't look so big AND you have to understand that shape is a LOT when it comes to bras and what you are seeing is a bra for a more projected shape. If you want to try on a bra at VS I would suggest their unlined bras in a 38D but since their bras are very stretchy, I sister size down so a 36DD. You may just be more comfortable even at just a few cup sizes difference. You may not be swooping and scooping ALL the tissue in because your wires are not wide enough.   I can mostly fit in a VS Fabulous ""lightly lined"" demi, VS unlined, and a VS Body by Victoria lightly lined demi. I have a Chantelle C-Chic Sexy Demi, Cleo Marcie, Freya Marvel, Self Expressions by Maidenform racerback front closure demi, and my best fit to date is the Freya Patsy Padded Half Cup. It isn't a whole brand that will fit and honestly, it took me a LONG time to find those bras that fit. I have heard some people do well with a Freya Deco Soft Cup but it didn't work for me. The issue with most of the unlined ones that do fit is the lack of a complete shape but you may not have that bad of a time depending on the amount of tissue you have on the bottom. Padded bras do nothing for my shape and actually can make your breasts stay that shape if they are exclusively worn, that was my issue. I would try the Marcie in a 38DD/38E FIRST and maybe a Patsy Padded Half Cup in 36DD/36E. This is because bras are weird like pants. The Marcie has a stiff band and (in my experience) slightly small cup. The Freya will have what we call Freya-long bands so a 36 would be good and the sister size will give a DD in that case. I would also see if you can get 2 sizes in each as that is going to be easier to diagnose the correct size."
ABraThatFits,39nl2q,hurrrrrmione,6,Sat Jun 13 03:54:14 2015 UTC,"According to your measurements you could be in the range of 38D/DD/E depending on leaning measurement. Even from your smallest measurement you'd still end up around a 38D. Are you swooping and scooping? What's most likely happening is you're getting the Orange in the glass effect where the cups of your current bra are too small or narrow to fit your breasts into. This is pretty common. If you go to the Bra Band Project and search those sizes they're not humongous or anything, I promise. (I'd link but I'm on mobile) have you looked into the shape guide at all?"
ABraThatFits,39nl2q,hurrrrrmione,2,Sat Jun 13 01:14:12 2015 UTC,I have not! I've not explored much of this subreddit at all
ABraThatFits,39njfo,Smashedgrass,4,Sat Jun 13 00:45:06 2015 UTC,"I'm also projected/omega shaped. Have you tried the Cleo Lily/Erin? It might be too closed in top for you but it was my best fitting bra when I was in its size range. I also find Ewa Michalak PLs work quite nicely with my shape but they run a little small. Panache Jasmine is another bra I found to work for me but the wires are ridiculously wide on me because I'm in the very top of the size range, but it would likely work well for you. If you have any other questions let me know!"
ABraThatFits,39njfo,blizzard07,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:06:45 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! I'll add those to a list to try! So do you have wide roots or narrower roots? Because I think I have somewhat wide roots but I'm think I'm an omega shape because of what another user said and when I bend over that what it looks like from the front. Also kind of random but how do you know if you have pendulous breasts?
ABraThatFits,39njfo,blizzard07,3,Sat Jun 13 01:15:29 2015 UTC,I have narrowish roots. If you're wider you should probably start with the Jasmine. Pendulous essentially means that your breasts are not self supporting. Think the pencil test. It's very common in larger sizes.
ABraThatFits,39njfo,agent-99,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:38:30 2015 UTC,Wait what's the pencil test? And I don't know if mine are self-supporting lol I mean if I don't have a bra on they are obviously more saggy?
ABraThatFits,39njfo,t_maia,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:51:27 2015 UTC,"it means that with no bra on, if the skin underneath your breast touches the skin on your chest, and if you put a pencil there and let go, it would hold up the pencil between your breast and your chest, then it's known as ""not passing the pencil test"""
ABraThatFits,39njfo,kittydewinter,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:25:55 2015 UTC,"Website/tool: bratabase.com  Regarding shape:   Some people in the smaller sizes had luck with Curvy Kate. That said, Curvy Kate is probably too wide in the wires for you - but it is something to try anyway.   Comexim is often hailed as the brand for omega shapes, because they have very narrow wires. Krisline also goes a bit in this direction.   With narrow wires and full on top, Gorgeous by Debenhams as well as PourMoi?  are two UK brands to check out."
ABraThatFits,39n4on,pumkinswife0609,13,Fri Jun 12 22:43:31 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the Nordstrom you visit and the individual fitter you get. It could be a good fitting, an okay fitting, or a bad fitting.   Edit: Here's a thread where someone asked the same question a few months ago."

I was lucky to find 4 bras in my closest sister size on the racks, so I didn't need a fitter to pull then from the back. Apparently Nordstroms vary in what kind of stock they carry, as one of my Nordstroms had a whole section dedicated to UK brands (mostly Eveden with one Panache bra).

Gradually we went through 34C, 34D, 34DD, 34DDD, and ended on 34DDDD which is what she wrote on a little business card. She tried to get me to buy an $80+ bra, but it was clear it was not a good fit.  I was new to /r/ABraThatFits so I thought she might know what she was doing. Up until then I was wearing a 34B!"
ABraThatFits,39n4on,lillakatt,1 point,Sat Jun 13 07:15:46 2015 UTC,"no well-run lingerie department is going to force you to get a fitting if you don't want one. if you ask ""can you bring me bras in [size],"" 9 times out of 10 they ask you if you want a fitting because their manager makes them. the idea - which is valid for most women who do not know about bra fit - is that a Nordstrom fitting leads to better sales. if anything, not doing a fitting means the employee will have to do less work and can serve their other customers while you're doing your own thing. retail employees do not want to ""trick"" you into buying bras you don't want because of ""commission"" (which is peanuts and that we lost if you made a return). advocate for yourself the tiniest bit and you will have a positive experience 9 times out of 10.  i recommend measuring yourself on here and going to Nordstrom to try on bras in your size."

ABraThatFits,39ndnp,Gilliegrl4,5,Sat Jun 13 00:26:39 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised the calculator gave you 26G, when that's your supertight measurement. I think you'll find 28 bands much more comfortable, and significantly easier to find. 26 bands are almost exclusively custom. Since you only have 1"" between your snug and tight measurements, you don't seem to have much squish, so you may theoretically like 30 bands in brands that run tight. I suggest that you try bras in 28FF (35-27=8"" difference=FF) as a starting point.   Cleo by Panache is fairly affordable, very available, and somewhat youth-oriented as a brand. We often suggest three of their styles as ""diagnostic"" bras to help you figure out their shape. Cleo Lily/Erin is good for an even, narrow shape, so I would definitely try that one. Cleo Lucy is a bit wider and more full-on-bottom friendly and Cleo Marcie is more full-on-top friendly.   If you can, try a couple of bras in a couple of sizes each so that you can figure out if any fit problems you're having are due to size or to shape mis-match. 30F would be a sister-size of 28FF. You might also consider trying bras in 28F and/or 30E.   If you end up being more full-on-bottom, you might also like Freya's balconettes."

ABraThatFits,39ndnp,Shanakitty,3,Sat Jun 13 00:55:18 2015 UTC,"Assuming you are in the US, it is really challenging to find 28 bands in stores. A few boutiques carry them. You should be able to find bras in 30E/F at Nordstrom's. You could also look through the offline retailer list to see if there are any boutiques near you. You could also search this subreddit with your city name to see if anyone has reviewed a store near you. It's a good idea to call ahead before you visit a store to confirm what brands and sizes they carry, since it can vary by location.  If you end up having to buy online, like a lot of people here, Amazon is a good place to start because they have free shipping and returns (as long as Amazon is the seller), and they often have last season's colors on sale."

ABraThatFits,39jh2r,hilbertisoutofspace,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:24:36 2015 UTC,"Measure around your 'underbutt' (top of your thighs), and then measure around the fullest part of your butt. Underbutt is of course your band size, and subtract underbutt from butt to calculate cup size. If you wanted to be really precise you could take all 5 measurements and plug them in the calculator, but a simple calculation is probably fine. Depending on how squishy your thighs are, you may need to size up for comfort or down for support. :P"

I love it so much that when I bought the black one, I sprung for the matching panties. I usually wear bralettes for everyday but this is my favorite ""real"" bra by far!"
ABraThatFits,39mxdw,eveningtrain,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:21:41 2015 UTC,"That's a good tip about eBay! Do you have a favorite brand of bralette? Also, have you found a suitable strapless bra? I've had to make do with the Wacoal b.tempt'd Faithfully Yours Strapless Bra, but I really need one that fits better."
ABraThatFits,39lb4s,halp_throwaway,3,Fri Jun 12 15:06:33 2015 UTC,"With your measurements, since you're set on sticking with 36s, try both 36H and 36HH. Also, invest in a set of extenders - you can get packs cheap on amazon, and they'll help with bras being too tight. You want it to be snug, but not painful.   Of the bras you're looking to try, Marcie and Floris have the same shape, so I'd actually suggest replacing Marcie with Cleo Lucy. Marcie, Lucy, and Lily tend to be called 'diagnostic bras' on here, as how they fit can give a lot of information about your shape. And personally I feel like Panache bras are much higher quality than Cleos, so go for Floris over Marcie.   As far as the current ones you've tried - the Curvy Kate may simply be a shape mismatch, as I know CK bras are actually pretty tricky fits. Loretta actually looks too small to me - on the side view picture it looks like you've got a fair amount of breast tissue poking up out of the cup. The Lily also is far too small - I'd say about two cups too small, but right now, it's hard to say how much of that is it simply being way too small and how much is it being the incorrect shape.   (for the record, I have very similar measurements, and I wear 36HH, currently edging into 36J.)  If you can afford to do so, try Floris (or Marcie) and Lucy in both 36H and 36HH, and see which one works best for you, in both shape and size (Amazon doesn't appear to have Lucy available in 36H right now, but it does have Cleo Kali, which is a sister cut). Make sure they've got free returns so you can easily send back whatever doesn't work."
ABraThatFits,39lb4s,LadyVerene,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:25:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the long and thoughtful reply. I amended my cart to a Floris 36HH, Marcie 36H, Lucy 36HH, and Kali 36H. Would this be a good way to approach it? I have to kind of choose based off Prime and amount... until I get some return money this will end my budget.  I'm not trying to be unreasonably set on 36 bands, if it's just not right for me it's not right. I know that before my current weight loss, I was constantly yanking down 38 bands in the back, and the cups were already far too tiny for me... so I based my shopping around that and the tight UB fitting.  When your underwear world is turned upside down, it's hard to get your footing I guess. :( I have lurked here for months and read everything in the side bar, but it's so much information that I'm sure I'm doing something wrong."
ABraThatFits,39lb4s,LadyVerene,2,Fri Jun 12 15:58:08 2015 UTC,"That'll work great to start out and really figure out your size and shape. One of the four is likely to fit you, and they'll give you all sorts of info about what kind of bras you need.  (also, incidentally, I've noticed that when sending returns to amazon, I've always gotten credited the return amount as soon as UPS picked up the package and updated the tracking, which is nice).   That makes sense, but I'd still recommend getting some extenders anyway, just because some bras run tighter than others and they're useful to have on hand just in case. I got this big old pack of like 20 of them for $8 and they come in a billion different colors, worth it.   And totally understandable. I spent a long time reading and researching before I made the jump and ordered anything myself, and I was only able to afford to try one bra at a time XD I lucked out in finding one that fit well right away (Elomi Caitlyn, for the record), though it's been a long journey since of figuring out just what works best for me, as opposed to what works okay. Size is easy, shape is a pain."
ABraThatFits,39lb4s,HootyMyBoobs,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:16:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you again. I added a pack of extenders to my cart as well.

ABraThatFits,39lb4s,HootyMyBoobs,2,Fri Jun 12 16:44:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, the gore probably isn't tacking on the Lily because it is at least a cup too small. Probably two. I think you should definitely try the Jasmine and the Envy in 36H/HH and the Lily/Erin in 36HH.   I think the bean shape you are talking about it is an indentation at where the strap and cup meet, as the cup cuts in there. I get this terribly in the Marcie cut, as it as not expecting any side fullness there. I do not get it in the Lily in my proper size."

Do you think with some of the bras I was kindly directed to above (Floris 36HH, Marcie 36H, Lucy 36HH, and Kali 36H) that I could be able to more accurately determine an Envy that would fit me? I'm not sure if it's wiser for me to go Lily in a larger cup and Jasmine, or try the other four.  So sorry. I'm trying to learn. :)"

ABraThatFits,39ljqa,Inared,5,Fri Jun 12 16:06:54 2015 UTC,"If she doesn't like a snug fit, then yes, it's probably a good idea to start with 36E. It's a good idea to try on a few sizes in the same bra, but that isn't always practical.  Some styles she might consider are the Wacoal Retro Chic in 36DDD which is US size equivalent of 36E UK; Goddess Keira also in 36DDD, and Elomi Caitlyn in 36E. If you have a Nordstrom or Dillard's near you, there's a good chance of finding those bras there. Also there's Elomi Etta is slightly less full in coverage and lower in the gore, in 36E, and the Wacoal Awareness bra in 36DDD."

ABraThatFits,39ljqa,crazymusicalgenius96,5,Fri Jun 12 17:22:42 2015 UTC,"Since her snug underbust is above 34 already and she's not interested in a super tight fit, I think 36E would be better at first. You may also want to try 36F if she's got significant asymmetry, as the measurements do kind of assume the breasts are the same size.   If her IMF is at a different height on each side, she'll always have some space on the higher side, but it hopefully won't affect the support too much.  I think Panache Andorra would be a good bra to start with; it's even and average pretty much everywhere, and works well for pendulous breasts."

ABraThatFits,39kycx,came0,3,Fri Jun 12 15:52:57 2015 UTC,"To prevent unpleasant surprises like that in the future I suggest checking each new bra cut on Bratabase. For information like bra band stretchiness you don't even need you exact size, just look at what the stretchiness of bras around your usual band size is."
ABraThatFits,39kycx,noys,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:22:30 2015 UTC,"I looked at reviews other places before buying. Unfortunately, I cannot make heads or tails of bratabase. I've tried and tried. I just don't understand a thing about it."
ABraThatFits,39kycx,came0,2,Fri Jun 12 17:53:20 2015 UTC,"Bratabase can be kind of overwhelming - I certainly found it to be that way for a while. I mostly use it to look up bras I've never interacted with before or to find a specialty item (strapless bras, most often) in a certain size. I also use it to figure out how bras are related to each other shape-wise by using the ""cuts"" section. It puts bras into groups based on their construction, so if you've tried one bra and it didn't work, you can probably rule out the other bras in its group because they're going to fit you pretty similarly."
ABraThatFits,39kycx,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Fri Jun 12 18:26:33 2015 UTC,"It's not that confusing once you get the hang of it. Type the brand and bra cut you're interested in into the searchbar, click the right bra from the results and then you're shown the size range right away.  All the sizes marked with a darker color have entered bras either in the same bra cut or other bras that share the same cut. Click on the size that interests you and on the left you see a measurement table. Look at the stretched band measurement. It should line up with the band size, if it doesn't sister size accordingly."
ABraThatFits,39kycx,noys,2,Fri Jun 12 18:51:48 2015 UTC,"Have you tried entering and measuring your own bras? For most it clicks when they start entering the measurements of their own bras. This has several advantages - it allows you to keep track of all the bras you tried and it allows you to compare those bras to others in the database. If you know the wires of bra X were too narrow, you can use bratabase to rule out other bras with even narrower wires.   Additionally entering the measurements will cause bratabase to grow, making it ever more useful over time. Seeing measured bras will prompt other users to enter their bras which you can then compare to yours."
ABraThatFits,39kycx,annoyingbranerd,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:19:44 2015 UTC,"I'm sized out of Elomi now due to weight loss, but when I wore them, the bands felt TTS to me. Note, I must admit I didn't measure them! At the time, I didn't realize it was a Thing. However I wouldn't be alarmed; if you're pretty well set in a certain size chances are the bands will be fine. If it's more comfortable to wear them on a tighter hook, that's not the worst thing in the world either."
ABraThatFits,39kycx,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:38:03 2015 UTC,"Yep, yep. I got an Elomi Etta in a 36JJ and the band was so tiny, even on the last hook. I got a 38JJ, no probs.

Also, while at Nordstrom Rack recently, I tried on a Lexi in 34GG just for the hell of it, despite it being two cup sizes smaller than I normally wear. Despite the cups being way to small and quadding all over, the band felt great.  And then there's my Etta which is basically exactly a 36 band, and actually runs true to size compared to other Elomis.  I generally always recommend that people size down both in the cup and band for Elomi because they tend to run large for both. I'm at 36 snug and 34 BTT right now and I'll certainly be ordering 34s in Elomi from now on, other than for Etta."

ABraThatFits,39jxs9,hibraladies,16,Fri Jun 12 06:37:14 2015 UTC,"No problem - it's kind of mind boggling. The long answer involves a bit of bra history, but the short answer is basically ""because it's way cheaper to make fewer sizes"". If bra companies used the ABTF method, they'd have to make more sizes to fit most people. Added onto the cultural perception that people have about boob sizes, it's far more cost-effective for them to make a thousand identical 34Bs. Those thousand women may all have different shapes as well as sizes and can't really be adequately served by the same exact bra, but those thousand women will all buy it anyway.  Also, there is not much thorough information about good fitting practices out there. Many women have no idea their gore is supposed to tack; after all, none of the examples provided to them have tacking gores. Some of them may have an idea that something is vaguely wrong but if they aren't in pain they don't really do anything about it. I was one of those people before I came here - I felt pretty sure that the underwires were not supposed to cut your boobs in half. But I didn't have access to good fit information to confirm that until I randomly stumbled upon ABTF."

I suspect this is probably true of most people wearing bras. And it also makes the idea of trying on/shopping for bras a chore rather than something that ought to serve as empowerment."
ABraThatFits,39jxs9,ericazibby,6,Fri Jun 12 15:56:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, most people who I've talked to about buying bras (admittedly, not many) agree that it's not very fun. I think buying underwear should be just as fun as buying regular clothes! They are our foundation garments, after all, so a good bra makes the rest of your outfit look better. That's why I've been willing to devote time and energy to this, because the comfort and appearance of a well-fitting bra are unmatched."

ABraThatFits,39jxs9,hurrrrrmione,12,Mon Jun 15 11:18:51 2015 UTC,"If Victoria's Secret sized people correctly, then they'd have to tell most of the people they sized ""Sorry, we don't carry your size."" Which means if they don't want to lose all those sales but do want to size people correctly, they need to carry a greater selection of sizes. And it takes time and money to develop new products and be able to start manufacturing them and of course to manufacture them. So Victoria's Secret has to believe that expanding their selection of sizes is profitable. And they don't think that they will get enough sales of bras outside the standard US matrix in order to offset the time and money it takes to start carrying and continue carrying bras in those sizes.  Of course, a great part of the reason why selling, say, 28FF bras at Victoria's Secret might not be profitable is because society at large is not aware that 28FF bras exist. They don't think they need 28FF bras. And that's because they've never been given a chance to pick up a 28FF bra in a store and try it on, because they've been told by media and society that everyone fits into a band size between 32 and 38 and everyone fits into a cup size between AA and DDD or DDDD and that this is not only a properly fitted bra, but how your boobs will look in a properly fitted bra. So they think that the bra size they're wearing is the right size. And if you think your bra size is right, then why would you say, ""Hey, Victoria's Secret carries 28FFs now, I wonder if those would fit me better than my current bras.""  Change can be made and I think some change is being made but it's a systemic and societal problem. And that kind of problem takes a long, long time to fix."

I had to outright laugh when I saw how many square crotches there were in that photo. But...to the reply to this comment...it was astounding how quickly folks snatched up the DDDs when stores started carrying them.  I don't know/think there is any plan to start carrying anything outside of that range but they would make a killing if they dropped their band range down to 30 (even if only AA-DD).  Their own models are in that range but goodness forbid if they carry a size that their models actually wear; and, aside from one or two, none of them have the cleavage that is portrayed in the catalogs.  smh.

I'm holding out a lot of hope that VS will do this at some point, especially given that they do have 30As and 30Bs online and given that Aerie is making 30-bands and hopefully being successful with that. I'm a 28DD but would HAPPILY sister size up a band to a 30D if it meant I could try on ridiculous push up bras in person. :)"
ABraThatFits,39jxs9,basylica,6,Fri Jun 12 08:38:21 2015 UTC,"All of the above plus history -  Bras originally were sized based on your OVER bust measurement (lets say for sake of argument 38"") and then you picked what cup size you thought you were based on the size of your boobs (A, B, C, D) with a helpful little graphic in the catalog. So lets say you picked D. The bra itself would be along the lines of a 34D (possibly more like a 32DD or more compared to current standards) The fabrics used back then were non-elastic as well, kinda bandeau bras. No underwire, and the cups were not very defined. Basically like buying a S/M/L sports bra at walmart.  When companies started selling bras that had bands and cups more like today, they had to tell ladies to ""add inches"" to underbust measurement because women got sticker shock like we do today going from VS to ABTF.  ""I used to buy 38D from sears and when I measured I got 32DD!""   While the concept of a bra or bra like device has been around for centuries (roman woman would bind their breasts with strip of fabric and even sewed a device like a bra) purchasing clothing from a store vs sewing your own or having a seamstress make them is really a relatively new development. Bras are ""younger"" than that. bands with defined cups and underwires have really only been around maybe 50ish years.   same thing with the struggles of large boobed women trying to fit into mass manufactured clothing. It's really a ""recent"" luxury. In the 50s women often sewed or had seamstress sew dresses and bras for them. I still remember my mom taking us to a seamstress in the early 80s to have nightgowns made and I know she made custom bras. Hardly anyone sews custom bras anymore, but in the 50s if you didn't like the options available at stores there was plenty of options to have garments sewn specifically for you.   Big retailers have stuck with the old school sizing because it's easier to make 30 sizes than 150, and because its what sells. Unfortunately they mislead women into thinking they are a certain size because they want to make sales - even when they might know better.  Because the demand is small, most companies don't want to waste effort in making non-matrix sizes.   In the 80s hardly anyone made a size 0, or 2. usually 4s were few and far between. Between vanity sizing and demand for smaller sizes....now you can find them. When I was a teen in the 90s most shops (department stores, old navy, gap, etc) didn't offer plus size AT ALL, and usually 12 or maybe 14 was biggest size offered. I don't think I SAW a plus size store until I was in my 20s.  I think eventually if the demand is there, companies will start offering bigger ranges. The internet and places like reddit will help drive that when more women realize that hey.... 28H fits me WAAAY better than 34DD (my situation) and stop buying what they are selling."

Austrian clothing sizes go with bust measurements in inches (not that anyone knows that - but they do) so swimwear is often in clothing sizes (especially on-piece-suits). If that swimwear includes a cup size it might say something like 40D which actually means 36D. The only reason that people don't mix it up is that we use EU-sizing (e.g. 80D)"

ABraThatFits,39jxs9,paininthetits,2,Sat Jun 13 20:55:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your thoughtful responses! It's really interesting to hear about the history of all this.  I guess what I was really curious about is this - everyone seems to agree that their abtf size fits them much better than their +4/5 size - even in big box stores and brands. I used to work at a clothing design company, and we sometimes had fit models for sizes 0-14  come in - women who were the ""perfect"" measurements of that size - so that the designers could do alterations and see what needed to be changed.  Just from my own limited experience, I can't imagine how everyone's abtf size would fit them so perfectly in all of these brands, unless the brand itself was actually using the abtf method (or something similar) to make its bras, then telling us to use the +4 method to find our own size in their brand! It seems like they would make a bra to fit someone with a 32 inch underband measurement perfectly - and then just add 4 inches of fabric and sell it as a 36C or whatever. I feel like bra companies must use fit models, right? The abtf method bra sizes seem to fit everyone so well that I can't figure out how, unless the companies are actually using them to make the bras.  Even if we're just looking inside the bra matrix, wouldn't it make more sense for them to actually make the bras the way the say they do? I read on here a few times that very few women are actually A and B - and there are way more at the higher end of the spectrum (DDD and up) than a lot of people think. But if companies actually made their bras to fit the way they claim they do (ie, in my instance, a 32 inch band would actually fit someone with a 28 inch underbust, not a 32 inch, and the cup size would actually be in correspondence to the 32, not the 28), so many more bras would actually fit their customers, and way more women would actually be inside the matrix. Even if they want to keep the matrix system, why wouldn't they make it so that it actually does fit more women? The ironic thing is, I think that if they did, there'd be way less of us here on ABTF, learning about all these different sizes after spending years in an ill fitting bra - so it seems like it'd actually be a better business move for them!"

I did notice on the Offline Retailer Wiki that Town Shop is listed as using the +5 method for fitting, but when I've gone in, they've never tried to convince me that I'm any other band size than what I told them. Then again, Linda's is listed as using underbust and they tried to add inches to mine, so who knows.

ABraThatFits,39l4di,xXxXx____xXxXx,8,Fri Jun 12 14:16:19 2015 UTC,"First of all, don't worry about the US size - just stick to the UK size. Very few brands make larger cup bras using US sizes and those that do all use their own sizing system, there's no consistency. We primarily use UK sizing here.  I would suggest you might want to try 38 bands instead of 36, since you have little difference between your snug and tight measurements. 38F/FF/G are all possibilities that may work for you.  Can you look at the shape guide on here? Teardrop/pendulous doesn't actually tell us anything about your shape other than your breasts being projected. If you can get an idea of how your breast tissue is distributed - if you are more full on top, full on bottom, or neither, that'll help immensely with bra recommendations.  As far as your breasts bring different sizes - you'll want to fit to the larger breast. The smaller side can be padded if you want to even things out, or sometimes simply adjusting the straps on the smaller side will do the trick."
ABraThatFits,39l4di,LadyVerene,2,Fri Jun 12 14:43:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for the reply. I'll stick with the UK size then.   When I get around to a store, I will try on many bras and see what fits.  I looked over the shape guide (I'm sorry for the lack of information), and it seems my right is a projected and my left is a slightly projected. Maybe even a bit shallow. I am not the best at judging it so and I've taken pictures of my breasts and lined over that. Is that acceptable? Or is that not allowed?  I've been as exact as I could with the lines, so it should be almost exact to my breasts. I've slightly drawn the nipple as well.  Ah I see, I've been doing the quiet opposite. Because my right side was bigger, I'd tighten that shoulder strap up so it'd pick it up more(?) Is what I thought.  Thank you again."

I learned to do that recently where you bend forward and put on your bra from there. I guess I should've gotten a hint when my nipples and a good chunk of my breasts bulged out the top. I'd adjust and kind of squish them in there. At least with one of my bras.  Another bra will go over and leave a chunk of underboob but I'd find a way to stick it in.  Thank you!

Based upon your lying bust you need at least a 38DD and that is the minimum possible size.   UK 36GG happens to be around the largest possible size (based upon your bowed forward bust). So while it is probably an overestimation, the truth will most likely be somewhere between that and 38DD/36DDD.   Using several methods for size calculation I am getting around UK 38F as a starting point. Try some bras in this size range and adjust as necessary."

I have no personal experience with Polish bras, just what I see in fit checks, but I'm getting the same impression as /u/lcl0706. The cup is deepest up there at that seam, which forms the apex of the cup (and maybe the design of that bra isn't the greatest?) but it's well above the apex of your breast and your boobs aren't filling the deepest part of the cup at all. So it's very much a shape incompatibility. The cup is empty there, and being a firmish lined material it forms a dent instead of collapsing like a loose lacy top would."

ABraThatFits,39iwtr,Kapwned,11,Fri Jun 12 01:07:24 2015 UTC,"This is part of the reason the web calculator should give you a warning over a certain band size and measurement difference. You are correct that in large band sizes there are likely to be co-located ""rolls"". Generally the method we advocate would subtract two cups (more or less) from the calculator size. 44G in UK sizes minus two cups would get you UK 44F.  But do remember, what matters is how big your breasts end up being once you've scooped them into the cups. So your breasts may be larger than you feel."
ABraThatFits,39iwtr,khasiv,10,Fri Jun 12 02:04:44 2015 UTC,"It's also worth noting that some women in your size range prefer to size down in the band. If you're currently wearing a 42 band comfortably, there is no need to size up to the 44.   However, take into consideration how old your current bra is. If you're in a 2-year old 42C, the band may be very stretched out, whereas a new 42 band bra may be too small. Some things that would help to know:   How old is your current bra? What shape is it in? Is it relatively new and in good-condition, or well-loved and a bit stretched? Are you scooping and swooping? How is your current bra fitting? Does the band move around, does it ride up, or are you pulling the hooks and eyes out? Do the underwires encompass your breast tissue, and do you have any sort of overspill or gapping? For a full list of fit criteria (with photos), you can look here.    Personally, I would suggest trying to find your fit based on fitting criteria rather than measurements alone. Possibly try going to a store that carries 40-44 and C-G cups. I would probably recommend starting around the 42E range, as that will be closer to your measurements, but also take into account the possibility of extra inches being wrongfully added, and adjust to accomodate the current size you're wearing.  FWIW, however, the calculator can (and does) assume that some of the difference is in your bust, when it is not. I have a similar problem caused by a muscular back, and I've found I need to fudge all my overbust measurements by 1""-3"" to get an accurate prediction. In cases like this, it's easiest to judge sizing by trying on and evaluating the fit of different bras."
ABraThatFits,39iwtr,skyaerobabe,5,Fri Jun 12 05:57:07 2015 UTC,"But the fat on her body is not all in the breasts, it extends to the sides and likely around to her back. And I assume this reddit's coveted calculator is considering that extra fat that is included in the measurements no matter is a part of the breast fat and thus upping the cup size when it is not that much fat in the actual breast itself.    This is indeed a problem, but less than you think. This is more a general shape issue than a ""fat"" issue. The basic problem is that it really varies how wide a woman's breasttissue extends under her arms.   http://i.imgur.com/1GZ7tSx.png  If you compare W and V it is not immediately obvious, but somebody with shape W needs significantly larger cups.   Ditto if you compare Z and X - even if both women have the same measurements, what cupsize they end up will vary a lot depending upon their shape.  This is why the calculator is just a starting point, you got to try on bras. Do you prefer narrow-wired and deep 34DD bras or are you better off in a shallow 34F?   Sadly this is where the problem for plush-sized people starts: In smaller sizes these shape issues are relatively easy to fix, it usually means adjusting 1-2 cupsizes. But in larger sizes everything is larger, so the margin for error is larger. Here it can easily add up to 3-5 cupsizes.   Additionally it can be hard to tell how far your breastissue extends to your armpit area and back if there is a significant amount of chub covering this area.   I just absolutely CANNOT imagine myself fitting in cups those sizes   That is a very common first reaction to seeing the size the calculator gave you. Additionally you might have a shallow shape, which could easily hide the true size of your breasts.   Breasts with a shallow shape always look smaller than they really are, leading to such estimations as B/C cup when the woman needs UK-G/US-i and above.   Finally, the fact remains that the calculator gave you a size that is signficantly larger than your 42C that you currently wear. So maybe you don't need a UK 44G, but I won't be surprised at all if 44F is a good fit."

If it makes you feel better, I have the exact same armpit fat/tail of spence issue and thought I needed wide wires for a long time, but have determined my roots are quite a bit narrower than I thought they were.  I think the wires on the Rio look better than the Andorra.  Have you measured the cup width of these?  From one wire channel to the other across the cup, not including the wire channel fabric.  I bet the Rio's are narrower.  That said, I haven't tried either of those bras, so maybe someone else will have a different opinion lol.  Cleo Lily and Marcie are great diagnostic bras, Lily for sure has narrower wires and that would help answer your root width question.

Anyone have suggestions for a bra shaped like Freya Rio but more rounded cup shape? If I go up a cup size, might that help with the pointiness, or not?

ABraThatFits,39iv3n,lcl0706,2,Fri Jun 12 02:07:27 2015 UTC,"Cleo Lily is definitely a more rounded cup and will give you a great rounded shape, but I don't find the straps wide set or the cups/side wings tall enough to cover my tail of spence.  Any bra I've found that covers that on me is incredibly uncomfortable on my actual arms.  I've never tried Marcie, but the Cleo unlined bras are known for their uplift and rounded shape.  Marcie is a bit more open on top than Lily is.  Some pics of Envy look to give a good rounded shape, but I haven't tried it... damn I wish I had better advice for you on that.  Hopefully someone else chimes in.  I think if you go up a cup in the Rio, it's going to be too big and lack support.  It looks like the proper cup volume now as it is."
ABraThatFits,39iv3n,t_maia,2,Fri Jun 12 03:58:31 2015 UTC,"Freya Rio - Tail of Spence tissue up top is better contained by wider straps/cups than in the Andorra, though still plenty of underarm tissue squeezing out on sides. Go up a cup and scoop and swoop it in?   In this case I would wait for breast migration. Like u/lcl0706 wrote, going up a cupsize would make you loose stability in the cup.   But you can bet that you will have less tissue spilling out from under your arms in about about 2-6 months if you continue to wear the Freya Rio. At that point you will probably end up needing a different bra.   36FF Andorra - looks too shallow and not projected enough. If you want a temporary bra to aide migration forward the Andorra in 36G might be it, the wider wires would capture the tissue and force it forward. But if you don't want a bra that won't fit in a few weeks I would not bother.   Instead I would recommend Fantasie Side Support bras and balconettes if you like the general cut.     Any insights into my root width and wire needs?   Wire width is hard to see in photos, but I am leaning towards narrow to medium. You definitely need very projected cups, bc the 36FF Andorra was too shallow.   The Aimerfeel is also too shallow, the gore floats. But apart from that it is not bad at all."

I'd order some of everything but I'm limited by Korean customs to about 3 bras at a time, and no free shipping in either direction. Planning to try Cleo Erin (Lily not available on Figleaves) in 36FF.  Thanks!"
ABraThatFits,39iv3n,t_maia,2,Sat Jun 13 02:57:26 2015 UTC,"Also thinking Freya Faye since I'm reading it's more rounded than Rio.    With Freya bras you cannot trust reviews that say ""nice round shape"" - the person who reviews the bra might get a nice round shape, but unless you are her identical twin sister and got exactly the same breasts you won't get the same shape from this bra. For you there will be another Freya bra out there that gives you that nice round shape.  With the way the Rio fits you I would not recommend Faye. Faye is made for a 1-5 shape while Rio is more for a 3-5 shape.   http://i.imgur.com/VPH5K0E.png  What is likely to happen in Faye is that the rim of the cup cuts in.    Recommendation between 36FF and 36G based on fit of Andorra 36FF?   Ideally try both. But based upon the Rio, 36FF is more likely.    Any rec's on a Fantasie side support balconette that gives a more rounded shape?   Same problem as with the Freya bras - the bras that give person X a round shape are not guaranteed to work for you.   That said, Fantasie Jana Side Support and Fantasie Elodie would be interesting to try."
ABraThatFits,39iv3n,t_maia,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:09:59 2015 UTC,"How about the Freya Gem or Fantasie Lois for my apparent shape? That's about it for what's available in my size on Figleaves right now. There's also CK Dreamcatcher, but that may be too shallow in 36FF and too wide in 36G, according to limited data on Bratabase?  And is it even worth trying the Cleo Erin (supposedly same as Lily, right?), if the Andorra was too shallow? Am I definitely going to be better off with the Maya/Marcie line, you think?  When leaning or in hand-bra I seem to have very even fullness, somewhere between 2/5 and 3/6. Not close-set but with inner fullness, if that matters."

Just to be safe I think you should try all 5 measurements again. Snug underbust should be comfortable, tight underbust as tight as you can go (though out of all of the measurements I think that one is closest to being correct), and all three bust measurements are quite loose, preserving your natural shape when braless."

Here's a chart that shows generally which US sizes correlate to which UK sizes. I say 'generally' because different US bra manufacturers label their cups differently over DD. UK sizing, however, is consistent, which is why the calculator and this sub use UK sizing.  Very, very few brands that use US sizing go past a UK FF cup. So you're going to want to be looking at UK brands anyway."

That is EU 100i; US 44i with Goddess and Elila and US 44H with Lane Bryant.   That said, I do not want to rule out UK 44H (= US 44K in Goddess and Elila, EU 100L in Ulla Dessous) as potential size. Your bust measurements are close together, indicating firm breasttissue and breasts like this often need larger cups.   Only way to figure this out would be to try on some bras. Goddess Alice and Goddess Keira make some good beginner bras in this size range - cheap, good quality, easy to find and with opposite shapes (Alice is full on top, Keira full on bottom)    Everytime ive gotten measured at a store ive been told im between a 42 and 44 DD.    I would laugh if it was not that sad. 42DD and 44DD are often the largest sizes available in a store, so every plush-sized woman with large breasts gets shoved into these sizes.

I've gone up a bandsize just to avoid it often,  but I'm plus size and I've  read that many plus size women do the same simply  because already have visible back fat so squeezing it tight just makes it worse.  Scooping and swooping helps me a lot  but I still prefer my band a bit looser than my actual measurements suggest due to not wanting to have back rolls."
ABraThatFits,39i4sw,allrattedup,5,Fri Jun 12 00:09:01 2015 UTC,"I have back fat issues with properly-fitting bras for sure. I'm petite and nowhere near overweight, but I am soft and squishy. I'm not lean and fit. I carry my weight in my upper body. When I first started buying bras that fit, it was really unsettling and made me self-conscious. But I find that scooping and swooping helps, as does making sure the band sits properly and the straps are at the right length. Beyond that, not much I can do. I'm not thrilled by it, but that's how my body is. It looks better under clothing that fits properly."
ABraThatFits,39i4sw,glorioid,2,Fri Jun 12 00:37:22 2015 UTC,"Same size, same issue. but honestly, I'd rather have a bit of a roll under my band and boobs that are up where they need to be than boobs that aren't getting any support.

I store all my weight on my torso, and it sorta hangs off my ribs (and lower front torso (why oh why not my butt)). No matter what band size I am in, I have it.

ABraThatFits,39i4sw,HootyMyBoobs,4,Fri Jun 12 00:46:58 2015 UTC,"I'm one of the people who posted about back fat recently, though squishiness was secondary to my actual question about support. I have tried bands from 30-36 in the past. I've clocked the scale anywhere from 118 to 175 lbs at 5'3... and no matter what size I've been, or what bra or bikini I've worn, I've had back rolls. They get smaller as I get slimmer, but they're always there. I even have a full on squish roll in the FRONT, under my bra. Seems I store fat on my ribs. I'd say it influences my choice of shirts more than bras. As far as noticing it on other people... Um, sometimes. Usually only after noticing how badly their clothing fits."

ABraThatFits,39i4sw,braaccount,5,Fri Jun 12 01:57:12 2015 UTC,"I feel like REALLY scooping and swooping can conquer a decent amount of back fat just by redistributing skin.

ABraThatFits,39i4sw,j_sunrise,2,Fri Jun 12 09:57:27 2015 UTC,"I have way more noticeable back fat with wrong fitting, because too small cups just pull the band and it cuts into my back making back-rolls. When I wear ABTF if I use the tightest possible band, it seems to make the rolls too, but when I just lean, put two hands at the center of the back under the band and move them to my breasts makind 'scoop and swoop' right from my spine, it becomes less noticeable and when I wear the bra for an hour or so it almost disappears (while with loose band the more I wear it, the more back rolls I have). The only thing I have to point is that band material matters. Those super-elastic lace bands with thin elastic edges make back rolls while more dence and wide kind of band prevents it."
ABraThatFits,39i4sw,yellkaa,2,Fri Jun 12 13:01:55 2015 UTC,"So my underbust has incredibly little squish to it (less than an inch between snug and BTT), so when a bra band sits in the right spot, I actually have no back bulge. But, if it's a bra band that rides a bit higher, or is a bit thinner (like Cleo -_-), then I suddenly get enough rolls to open my own bakery, as directly above my underbust is pretty fleshy in the back. It definitely influences me enough to avoid bras that have thinner or higher sitting bands, even if they are otherwise decent fitting.  I never noticed before abtf, but now I totally stare at everyone's bra band lines (and quadboobing, and straps digging in, and underboob slipping out). I feel so bad for them, I feel like I should just carry around a bunch of business cards with abtf's web address and discretely slip them into people's shopping bags at the mall XD"

If you're comfortable posting your 5 measurements and describing your breast shape and fit issues, we can give you a little more guidance. But if you just need a space to rant, rant away!

They need underwires.  You can recoup some of the costs from those bras that don't fit by selling them on /r/braswap or Bratabase. Seeing as they're basically new without tags and you've only worn them for a few hours total, you should be able to get a good amount of your money back.   If you haven't done a measurement check yet, I recommend doing one, and you can also do a fit check to see what went wrong with those bras that don't fit (my guess is that you had shape issues with them). Red indentations are normal, but pain and feeling like you can't breathe are not normal.   Have you considered just getting another 32DDD from VS? Or do they not make the one you have anymore? I think they only do 32DDD online, and I am not really aware of their shipping policies."

Oftentimes people will go to buy bras, get frustrated and just pick up whatever hurts the least, then search the Internet in frustration looking for something better. They end up here with a new size and their old bras that were basically never worn need new homes!  I just looked on Ebay and there are a bunch of VS 32DDDs available for $25-30.

That's your decision, and fuck anyone who tells you otherwise.   If you still want to find a bra, I'd suggest looking up the measurements of the ones you tried on bratabase and then trying to find styles that differ--perhaps longer wires, if you think that would help, or narrower cups, if you think that will help... whatever works. Lots of trial and error here. I can't tell you how many I went through before I got just a general sense of what I need. Posting a fit check can help, but that's only if you're comfortable sharing photos.  If you find bands in your measured size are painful, you don't have to take it! We can really proselytize here, but I don't think anybody wants you to be in pain. Red marks are pretty normal, especially just starting out, but pain is not something you should have to endure. You can go up a band size, even if your measurements say otherwise. There are no laws in bra-land. You do what feels right.   I wear a 30F and I've actually found that during the summer, when I'm wearing sundresses and the like that don't pair well with heavy-duty bras, I do okay just wearing a bikini top. I buy cheap string bikini tops at Forever 21 in extra large. It has to be one with tie-able strings so I can make it tight enough to fit my underbust, but XL so it's large enough in the cups to fit my breasts. I find it's a nice happy medium for when I'm sweaty and scantily-clad but still want to keep my boobs up.   I hope you find something that works. It is exhausting to try and figure it out, but I know that you will find something you can tolerate and even be happy with. Even if it's just going back to your usual bras.

Feel free to share whatever pics you feel comfortable with, but it seems like an odd single angle to share.  It's odd hearing that your EM runs large, generally SM bras are known for running a little smaller than a UK brand in the band, and true to size- 1 cup small in the cup in this size range. Looking at your measurements alone, I'd suggest a starting size of around a 30J, and 65JJ/70J in EM S/SM styles.  I don't know anything about Gorsensia and their designs, but it seems like there's just too much bra and not enough fit testing from your description. I'd think maybe the strap placement is causing the odd pulls, although it's a little difficult to tell just from the one picture. You may do better in a smaller size, it's difficult to tell, but I think the scaling of the bra may make it somewhat unwearable in your size range even in your 'best size'. If you were comfortable with the idea, I'd suggest as well as returning the bra to Gorsensia, to send them an email showing how the bra fits on you. To me this seems like an overall design issue where the bra is going to be far too wide and shallow for anyone in this size range, and if they're open to feedback, it could be useful seeing how the bra is working on a real person. I understand that getting fit models in small bands, large cups is difficult, although sometimes I think that companies just guess and hope for the best when releasing these sizes. :/"

To be completely honest, it's a pain getting the photos from my phone onto the laptop and uploaded, and I am lazy. :P  It does definitely seem like it's just been scaled from a different size instead of designed for someone my size.

It would possibly be helpful if you wanted to get a bit analytical about your fit issues and the cut of the bra.  It's a shame that the bra is so poorly designed, the style seems really pretty!"
ABraThatFits,39j9d3,otterhugs,2,Fri Jun 12 07:28:23 2015 UTC,"Another thing that might be happening here is that going by their size chart, each cup size increase is by 2cm rather than the 2.5cm/1in used by UK brands and EM. So while the M cup is the 13th cup volume just like a UK J, it might actually be a bit smaller because youre loosing half an inch with each size.   Edit: for some reason I kept thinking you were saying it was too small even though you said it was too big like 3 times, sorry! No idea then... Makes even less sense now."
ABraThatFits,39j9d3,buymeflowers,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:28:11 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised it's too large. By all reviews I've seen and counting by the size chart, I was expecting it to be slightly small.

ABraThatFits,39j9d3,t_maia,2,Fri Jun 12 05:11:10 2015 UTC,"A theory: the bra is far too large, you tightened the straps to try and take out the slack in the top of the cup, and the tension from the straps is creasing the cup. I had this happen to me in a few balconette bras that were too large by about 2 cups at least.  Czarna does NOT run large, when compared with UK bras OR with other SM bras. It depends on shape, but that tight ribbon trim on top usually means it runs 1-2 cups small for women with upper fullness."
ABraThatFits,39hfij,Qaz32144,5,Thu Jun 11 19:04:07 2015 UTC,"With your pendulousness and breastfeeding, a bra with stretch lace is probably going to be the most comfortable and fit best as your measurements vary. Plus they're very easy to convert into nursing bras if that interests you!   Panache Jasmine is the most projected of Panache's stretch lace bras, and I think 30GG for the size, just to be safe. It should fit when you're fully engorged, and because of the stretch lace it will shrink with you as your milk production fluctuates. If 30GG is too large even when you're fully engorged, then get a 30G."
ABraThatFits,39hfij,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Thu Jun 11 19:16:25 2015 UTC,Also possibly try Panache Envy.  That bra works wonders for those with lots of immediate projection and it too has stretch lace.

I'm wearing a 32FF currently but like you it fits different depending on the time of day.   The bra that's fitting be the best right now is the panache melody full cup. It's the only one I currently own that the gore tacks, I usually don't have any quad boob or gapping, sometimes I do a bit depending on the day. It's fairly stretchy so it's also easy to pull the strap over my shoulder and pull the cup down to nurse.   I had the same trouble as you with the tango and I had major gapping at the top in the Cleo Lucy."
ABraThatFits,39hfij,sewsweet,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:33:59 2015 UTC,Have you tried the Cleo Juna or Darcy?
ABraThatFits,39hfij,MutantToenail,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:42:53 2015 UTC,"Those bras are good for shallow breasts, OP says she is very projected and so will not work for her.   That being said, we shouldn't be downvoting for giving incorrect advice!"
ABraThatFits,39hfij,dwellondreams,-1,Fri Jun 12 12:19:21 2015 UTC,I'm very projected and they work for me in 28GG. I wouldn't consider them shallow in this size range.
ABraThatFits,39hfij,MutantToenail,2,Fri Jun 12 12:55:13 2015 UTC,"While they might not be super shallow * in your size range*, a moulded bra is never going to be a perfect fit on very projected breasts."
ABraThatFits,39hfij,dwellondreams,0,Fri Jun 12 13:11:31 2015 UTC,"Well, make up your mind, do you think they're shallow or not? I don't think you know much about these because they aren't moulded. They are lined, but they are seamed bras. The Darcy cups have 3-part construction and the Juna has 2-part construction. My breasts are very projected on bottom and the Darcy fits pretty great."
ABraThatFits,39hfij,MutantToenail,2,Fri Jun 12 13:59:06 2015 UTC,"Juna is clasically shallow, but if you say they are not shallow in your size range, I'm simply saying there is a practical limit to how projected a padded bra can be.   I don't think there's any need to be rude. I just really don't think Juna is a good place for a very projected, nursing mother to start with. As others have suggested Panache Jasmine is the best place to start."
ABraThatFits,39hfij,dwellondreams,2,Fri Jun 12 15:06:46 2015 UTC,"Um. Polish manufacturers have no trouble making projected seamed padded bras.  Also, she's right, Juna does get less shallow in larger volumes. Not really projected, no, but it can work for slightly projected shapes.  Also, do you want to see how Masquerade Capella fits on me? Projected molded cups are possible up to a size. Samanta also makes one. Elomi molded bras are projected, just wide."
ABraThatFits,39hfij,noys,2,Fri Jun 12 15:29:05 2015 UTC,"But Cleo isn't Polish! I didn't really want to start a debate on this, I just wanted to say that Cleo Juna isn't a great place to start with a very projected shape!"
ABraThatFits,39hfij,dwellondreams,-2,Fri Jun 12 17:29:59 2015 UTC,"I was unaware that people on this forum could collectively only suggest one bra at a time. Is that per thread or per user lifetime?  I also don't agree with your comment about projected vs. padded as Ewa Michalak makes many padded bras and is one of the most projected brands in the world. There's no reason why a bra can't be both projected and padded. (Personally, I would consider the Juna/Darcy/Ewa bras thickly lined, not padded, but whatever.)"

If the OPs breasts are very projected, the Juna will still be too shallow for her. Additionally soft breasts tend to fall out of halfcups like the Juna.   All combined make the Juna a potential desaster for OP."
ABraThatFits,39hhmb,LunaSunshines,2,Thu Jun 11 19:16:49 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, surprised the 30F Freya band isn't wildly too loose on you!  Man those things are stretchy.  Have you tried Cleo Juna?  It's a cute balconette style, it's not seamless but has a pretty lace trim at the top of the cups, and it is lined/lightly padded.  And sooooo soft and comfortable.  I don't notice the seams too bad through a shirt.  In our size range it does a pretty good job accommodating both projection and upper fullness, as it's quite open on top and not too shallow at the bottom.  It runs at least a cup size small, I'd recommend trying a 30FF and 30G.  Could probably also try a 28G.

I tried it on in a Nordstrom, it was the smallest band size they had and I still haven't been able to actually afford one (they're $70 a pop).  I feel like I'm being pickier than is allowed for big busted girls (can't have nice things, blah blah blah), but the Cleo Juno is a regular cup with lace across the top, vs in the link I posted the whole cup is nice looking (if that makes any sense).  I'm not a fan of prints, and that appears to be the go-to ""dress up"" for big bras."
ABraThatFits,39hhmb,lcl0706,4,Thu Jun 11 19:46:34 2015 UTC,"Be picky!  Big busted girls can definitely have nice things.  There's not a boring bra in my collection.  Even my nude tee shirt bra has lace detailing up the sides of the cups and sweet bows on the straps.  My black bra is a CK Bardot, which is most definitely NOT a boring black bra.  It's sheer with purple lace and bow accents, it's a damn sexy bra.  I suffered for years with the average black/white/nude options for boobs my size.  So I feel you there.  The only bra I have that has an allover print is my Cleo Ellie, which is a Juna clone, and it's a watercolor print, and I got it for $12 on eBay so I wasn't about to be picky with it.  Masquerade/Panache Black has some gorgeous half cup styles, that are always elegant and classy, but you'll have to do some digging on Amazon and Ebay to find one in your size, as Masquerade has been discontinued and it doesn't look like Panache Black will pick up very many of the Masquerade styles.  What about Masquerade Angie?  It ships from overseas, but it's a Masquerade favorite for a lot of people.  http://www.amazon.com/Panache-Masquerade-Angie-Balcony-7171/dp/B00NTFWAUQ/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1434052398&sr=8-7&keywords=masquerade+bra  Rhea is Masquerades best selling bra, hands down.

ABraThatFits,39hhmb,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:55:18 2015 UTC,"I think what you're looking for is the brand Masquerade, a sub-brand of Panache. They mostly have half cups, but the half cups are nice and narrow so they should suit you just fine. And the details are absolutely gorgeous. Gorgeous embroidery, luxurious materials. The bras are beautifully made, too.   Sadly the entire brand has been discontinued, but there are still bras available on Ebay. Just search ""Masquerade 28FF/30F"" and you'll see what's still available. You might even get lucky and find a few last stragglers on Amazon. Panache has also kind of regrouped and created a new brand called Panache Black that has the same kind of stuff, but the Panache Black bras are all in neutrals and black as opposed to the pretty colors Masquerade offers.   And I totally did the same thing with the Deco Vibe. Tried it and loved it in 30E in Nordstrom, but the band was way too loose for me to ever consider buying it, no matter the price. So I sit and wait for it to go on sale in 28F on Amazon."
ABraThatFits,39hhmb,drawingdwarf,2,Thu Jun 11 20:00:25 2015 UTC,"Balconette just refers to a construction style so there's a huge amount of variation in shape within that category. However, most of the bras in that link aren't actual balconettes, they look to mostly be moulded or seamed half-cups. This one is a true balconette. It's a 3-part cup construction where the straps attach to the bottom portion for more lift.  Half-cups tend to be wide and shallow, and since you fit the Deco well you may have luck with half-cups too. The Deco, being a moulded bra, is fairly shallow, particularly at the bottom of the cup. I'm sure there are plenty of balconettes that would fit you well too, unpadded bras are often an easier fit, or at least easier to see if it fits. They're nice a light in the summer too."
ABraThatFits,39hhmb,drawingdwarf,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:50:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I didn't know that!  Misleading that so many non-balconettes come up when you search for them.  I will look into half cups."
ABraThatFits,39hhmb,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Thu Jun 11 19:52:07 2015 UTC,"Like crazymusicalgenius96 said, it's often used as a catch-all term, particularly by non-full bust brands.  Since you say you're in the US, definitely check out Amazon for free shipping and returns while you try stuff out. I've seen some great deals on there and they're having their lingerie sale right now. At least I think it's still going on. Once you've tried more stuff ebay can be great, especially for discontinued stuff.  I would definitely advise you to try 28FFs since your snug UB is only 27. I think Cleo Marcie and Cleo Lily would be good places to start for balconettes and Freya half-cups come in a lot of super cute prints."
ABraThatFits,39hhmb,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:01:24 2015 UTC,"The other cute Decos are almost identical to the Deco Vibe, so if you want to try one, go for it!  You can certainly fit in balconettes if you want to wear them! The word ""balconette"" is kind of a catch-all term: bra companies will use it to mean anything that isn't a full cup, half cup, or plunge. I have no idea how the balconettes from Boux Avenue fit, as I'm from the US, but a balconette that could possibly fit you would be Cleo Marcie. http://www.bratabase.com/browse/cleo/marcie-6831/ Marcie has a bunch of similarly-fitting sisters that you might also want to check out; they're listed under the ""related models"" tab in the link I posted."
ABraThatFits,39hhmb,Dvrgrl812,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:45:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe I was unclear, my hesitancy for the other Decos was that adding a button isn't actually making it cuter, it's still just a boring full coverage bra that makes me feel old and like I can't have nice things.  I'm also from the US, which is why I was looking for suggestions that wouldn't cost me an arm and a leg to ship, since I can't afford the return shipping if it doesn't fit.  But the Cleo Marcie does look cute, along with some of the ""related models"".  I'm just not a fan of prints, and half of the big boob sizes are always just covered in flowers in an attempt to make them pretty without actually changing anything :/"
ABraThatFits,39hhmb,glorioid,5,Thu Jun 11 19:50:52 2015 UTC,"Cleo Marcie is pretty easy to get in the US, actually, just not at the moment because of some weird manufacturing issues that happened this spring. It's not exclusive to Boux Avenue, which doesn't even ship to the US at all.   Amazon Prime will be your savior as far as free shipping and returns go. And they have great discounts - once they get down to the last couple bras in a certain size/style, they'll just keep knocking the price down every day until they're gone. You can get bras for as cheap as $20!   I already said my piece about Masquerade and its gorgeousness, but the Polish brands Ewa Michalak and Comexim may also interest you. You'll probably want to work your way through the British brands first because it helps to know your shape REALLY well prior to ordering from Poland. Sometimes they're available on Bratabase or /r/braswap, though."
ABraThatFits,39i1ey,sarahwoodsbaker,4,Thu Jun 11 21:19:52 2015 UTC,"You might find 38/EF more comfortable in brands that run right, like Panache and its sub-brands (Cleo, Panache Black/Masquerade).  The side gaping could be due to your cups pushing away from you because there's not enough room for your breasts, but it might also just be a quirk. There was a recent thread about this, actually.  For even and projected, Cleo Lily or Erin is the usual recommendation. Be aware though that they might turn out to be too narrow (it's hard to determine root width without trying bras first). Maybe try Panache Jasmine and Envy as well â those have wider wires."
ABraThatFits,39h6n5,Mollysaurus,10,Thu Jun 11 18:12:10 2015 UTC,"I do think 30E would be too tight a band in most brands because your snug exhaled underbust is 30.5"". I think bras around 32D/DD would be better sizes to try initially in brands that run TTS or tight, but 30DD/E may work in some brands with stretchier bands.  Edit: I believe Panache Andorra and Panache Jasmine are good for average projection, so those may be worth a go."

ABraThatFits,39h6n5,bk7j,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:30:45 2015 UTC,"Do they carry actual correct cups? I went to some stores yesterday and ALL of the 32D/DD had enormous cups, which is clearly not right."

I have about 6 different brands of 32Ds (including Gap) and they all are similarly sized.  My measurements are almost identical to yours, but I have wide roots and am shallow."

ABraThatFits,39gw05,WinterOfFire,7,Thu Jun 11 17:11:00 2015 UTC,"If I'm reading the size chart correctly, a 46G in Prima Donna is equivalent to 46F UK, which is at least 3 4 sizes smaller than what people recommended in your measurement check (46H+). From the symptoms you described it sounds like the bra is simply too small, and the ""too much fabric"" might have been a shape mismatch and/or your breasts pushing too-small cups out from your body.  The Princess and the Dreamcatcher only go up to G in 44 bands, which would again be way too small. It's a shame because Curvy Kate bands aren't very tight -- if they had the right cup volume, they would have been worth a try.  Have you looked into the brands that /u/Goddess_Keira recommended?"
ABraThatFits,39gw05,braaccount,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:11:49 2015 UTC,"The too much fabric was an inch of fabric between the bottom of my breast and the wire.  It also was kind of bunchy and ripply in other parts of the cup.  Believe me, I wish it would have worked because they had the Symphony in the 46H in that gorgeous green and blue color which I have been searching for online and nobody has in my size, lol.  I am willing to wear a bra with an extender if it gets me the fit I need in all other respects.  I'm thinking of trying the Princess and Dreamcatcher in the largest sizes I can as sort of a hail-mary.  I fit REALLY great in the cups of a 40F on one brand so I keep hesitating to go even bigger to solve the issue (I will certainly try but of course not all brands have the same offerings).  I am ordering a few Sculptresse ones to try in larger cup sizes to see what will work.  There was an Elomi I wanted to try and I will also try Goddess if I don't get anywhere (But am not a fan of the overall look and the reviews mention the fabric is not comfortable on the skin for long periods of time).  Would a picture help someone diagnose exactly what is not right with the one I'm wearing?  Edit:  I just ordered from Amazon a Curvy Kate Dreamcatcher 44G and 44FF, Curvy Kate Princess 44G and 44FF, a Panache Tango 44FF, Panache Sculptresse Flirtini 46G, and a Panache Sculptresse Chi Chi 46G.  I do not know if the 44 will fit in the Panache, I hope it will in the Curvy Kate given the stretchiness and I will see how I fill out the different cup sizes.  Its possible even the largest cup size won't work and then I'll have to narrow my focus to the few brands that go bigger."
ABraThatFits,39gw05,braaccount,3,Thu Jun 11 20:56:44 2015 UTC,"I was going to say you could try a 40JJ (equivalent volume to 46H) + extender(s) in the Curvy Kates just to see what the volume is like. Maybe the Sculptresse 46Gs will get you closer, but I don't know about the others.  I hope /u/t_maia sees this because she's much more experienced in this size range."
ABraThatFits,39gw05,t_maia,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:19:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for calling me - but I am stumped on what to recommend with only a description of a too small and ill-fitting bra for reference.

ABraThatFits,39gw05,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Sat Jun 13 00:57:42 2015 UTC,"Just to double check, you did swoop and scoop as you put the bra on, right?  From the way the 46F is fitting, I don't think you'll need to go larger than 46G UK. The wires are already too wide in this bra, so going up to 46H/HH will likely make them even wider and more uncomfortable. I am slightly concerned about the gore being very narrow on you. It seems like this bra has a relatively low gore from the photos; do your breasts get closer together higher up on your chest?  If you are uncomfortable posting pictures then you don't need to post them. You said in your initial post that you felt more comfortable PMing them to someone, and there is a list of ABTF experts who are willing to be PMed in the expert flair procedures section of the sidebar."
ABraThatFits,39g9h7,littlemissmx,11,Thu Jun 11 14:56:53 2015 UTC,"Hi!  Do you have all 5 measurements?  And do you know your shape, roughly?  You're going to have a hard time finding a band smaller than 30 in any store, even a boutique.  At least that's my experience.  28 bands will likely need to be ordered online, but most 28's sounds like they'll be too big for you with a 23.5 UB.    The Freya Deco Strapless bra has a very tight band, especially for Freya, who usually has very loose, stretchy bands.  You might have luck with fastening it on the tightest hook.  It comes with straps and can be worn as a multi-way.  If you're shallow and wide, the coral Cleo Neve has a very very snug band, and usually can be found quite cheap on Amazon and Ebay.  I measure 27.75"" UB and needed a 30 band fastened on the loosest hook.  Polish brands will custom make 26 bands - I know Comexim and Ewa Michalak will off the top of my head, but usually both of those brands work best for somebody with narrow roots and a fair amount of projection.  That's why I asked about your shape."

ABraThatFits,39g9h7,lcl0706,6,Thu Jun 11 15:35:55 2015 UTC,"Comexim's website is www.comexim.pl.  Wellfitting also does orders for Comexim, but I'm not sure they do custom orders.  Honestly I have almost no experience with Comexim - I've tried one bra I found on eBay, and am waiting on another I bought on /braswap.  Eventually I will order directly from Comexim, I just want to try to nail down my size using other avenues first because I'm a little intimidated by all the Polish and hoping the translation is right.  Are you on bratabase?  There are currently 3 listings for 26-band Comexim bras - they use different sizing letters so don't be intimidated by the tagged size.  They may, or may not, fit you but maybe trying one of these would help you figure it out?  Their 55K size is roughly equivalent to a 26GG-H, but the measured depths on these listings don't look too far off from what you might need.  http://www.bratabase.com/listings/dlk3m/  http://www.bratabase.com/listings/dlk3r/  http://www.bratabase.com/listings/dlvdx/  Hopefully someone else with more experience ordering custom sizes from them will chime in."

ABraThatFits,39g9h7,lcl0706,3,Thu Jun 11 16:32:30 2015 UTC,"Bratabase is basically like IMDB for bras. Pretty much any bra you could possibly think of has been inputted into the site. It has measurements, reviews, pictures of the bra on a real person. There's also the listings section, linked above, where you can buy bras from other people that may not have worked out for them. They're new or lightly used, and it's often the cheapest and fastest way to try Polish brands."

(she wanted a front hook because she said it's hard for her to get in and out of a bra)I was SWEATING it! but I did temporary stitches, she tried it on, was happy with the fit and then I zigzagged the stitches closed. I think it was easier than anticipated because here was a lot of side panel to the bra and I was able to make the alteration without making the arm holes too small. It was also a wireless bra so that may have made it easier as well (by not changing the position of the wires by pulling them too far back)."

It could be a good option if you can afford it once you've figured out what works for you.  Masquerade by Panache I believe ran overall extremely tight in the band so you might be okay with a 28. There's also always the option of getting a 28 and altering the band shorter.  I don't know anything about San Diego but you can check the Offline Retailer List. Hopefully someone else can chime in."
ABraThatFits,39fcjc,nidena,21,Thu Jun 11 10:06:35 2015 UTC,"""Self-supporting"" is not a helpful shape description when it comes to bra fitting. While the large majority of women with a shallow shape have self-supporting breasts it doesn't really affect the bra shape they need. Also, there's a number of women with projected breasts who have a self-supporting shape. Now ""pendulous"" is a little bit helpful because the amount of women who have a shallow breast shape and pendulous breasts is very low compared to women with projected breasts who have a self-supporting shape so if a woman is confused about her level of projection but describes her shape as pendulous it's quite certain she has a projected shape. Fullness examples are of naked breasts. I look full on bottom without a bra but my breasts are even. You can't judge how breasts act in a bra based on how they look naked. The breast separation stuff is just strange. Weird stuff they claim: Women with an average breast separation can achieve a ""vertical cleavage line"" as long as their cup size is above B; Women with splayed breasts who are busty have breast tissue extending to the sides and getting in the way of arm movement (not me!); If you have splayed breasts and are experiencing rubbing or chafing under arms it's because you obviously have a wide root; Touching breasts always need a plunge while actually it depends on how high the breasts touch and the degree of splay below that point;   Breast shapes. a) Average projection breasts apparently fit in everything according to them. b) While the suggestions for uneven breasts are good it's not a ""shape"". There isn't a specific set of bras that will work for all women with uneven breasts. c) The second example of conical breast shape isn't even conical. d) The last example of tuberous breasts isn't tuberous. e) The description about omega shape is just offensive. The suggestions are also all over the place. f) ""Reduced projection"" would be helpful if they included images of a larger size range. The example image also looks projected but wide and with a very short root. The bra suggestions don't mention the cuts we suggest to people with less projection - halfcups and demis."
ABraThatFits,39fcjc,noys,5,Thu Jun 11 12:35:58 2015 UTC,"To add to the ""self-supporting"" classification: not all breasts that appear self-supporting actually are self-supporting. My breast shape looks like the pictures they have of self-supporting breasts (a pencil would not stay in my IMF) but my breast tissue literally slides around under my skin instead of folding over and hanging. The bottom edge of my root is covered up by more breast tissue, and I had to push my boobs around a lot to find where my root actually starts. I tend to call this shape ""semi-pendulous"" as genetics tell me that I will eventually become pendulous but there's only really been one post about it. I think this clarification is important, as it could help someone else ensure that their bras are actually in their IMF and not just the crease that's created when you stand up and the boobs slide down."

But I will say that this is the first time that I've actually found an accurate graphical representation of my breast shape; none of the shape guides I've seen thus far have looked like my breasts.  So I agree with OP in that the drawings themselves may be helpful, even if the rest of the site is not.  For the record, in the ""Pendulous"" set of drawings, I am exactly the bottom left. (And yeah, their advice for bra fit doesn't really help me at all because they're ignoring other variables.)"

I don't need a push up or cutlets or moulded bras, I just need less projection in the bottom of the cup and the half cup shape.

ABraThatFits,39fcjc,TheDodgyStalker,3,Thu Jun 11 12:09:32 2015 UTC,We don't use this classification for FoT for the simple reason that naked and unsupported breasts may act completely differently than in a bra. It's not something you can judge like this.
ABraThatFits,39fcjc,noys,2,Thu Jun 11 12:37:09 2015 UTC,the upper fullness classification? it just helped because I still couldn't tell even when leaning over. My tissue is soft so it doesn't keep a nice shape when not in a bra. Leaning over they look weird.
ABraThatFits,39fcjc,TheDodgyStalker,5,Thu Jun 11 14:54:06 2015 UTC,"The fullness that your breasts appear to have naked doesn't have anything to do with bra fitting. You can say that what your breasts look like is ""full on top"" unsupported but if it was a measurement check I would just disregard it and tell you to try FoT and FoB diagnostic bras, because what breasts look like naked and unsupported doesn't matter. It doesn't say anything about what bra cut the breasts want. For some people it may line up with the shape they need but for others it doesn't. It's not even hit and miss, there's no certainty whatsoever.  When we say ""full on bottom"" or ""full on top"" we refer strictly to how breasts behave in a bra. The only way to try to figure it out is to try to eliminate gravity from the equation. Leaning over tries to mimic this by changing the angle of the gravity to be closest to what it's like when wearing a bra. Handbra also tries to mimic this. Yet another method is being submerged in water so the breasts are weightless and seeing how they act then."
ABraThatFits,39fcjc,noys,2,Thu Jun 11 15:03:14 2015 UTC,I'm fully ignorant as to what my breasts look like in a well-fitting bra and I couldn't even tell the difference until I put my old bra back on after trying one a supportive one even though it was too small. I got a glimpse of what they're SUPPOSED to look like. So definitely in my case I'm just gonna have to try on a bunch of well made bras to figure it out.
ABraThatFits,39fcjc,TheDodgyStalker,10,Thu Jun 11 15:12:12 2015 UTC,"There have been no proper studies about breast tissue migration. I once found a study (I'm still pissed at myself that I didn't bookmark it) that observed the effects of regular breast binding over long periods of time and they concluded that it led to a more pendulous breast shape and breast tissue softening. While wearing a badly fitting bra will not exert that amount of force pressure from wearing too small cups might cause a much smaller version of this change as evidenced by the multitude of anecdotal breast tissue migration reports.   The ongoing French study that everyone hails as proof that we should stop wearing bras essentially compared wearing badly fitting bras to the effects of stopping wearing badly fitting bras and the women experienced minor positive shape changes. This shows that this type of damage is reversible. We also have a lot of anecdotal reports of breast size and shape changes after starting to wear a well-fitting bra.  So, in essence, a well fitting bra does not prevent anything. Whatever will happen will happen but if you already have breast changes from a bad fit or binding it could help reverse the damage in some cases.  Some stuff that is tangentially related but not scientific: http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/breast-binding-safety https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070628214019AAPPXie (anecdotal reports of breast shape changes) http://genderfork.com/2011/question-binders-and-sagging/ (more anecdotal reports of breast shape changes)"

Yes it's tricky to identify breast shape, they've tried to make it easy by getting it pretty much wrong.

I run into this a lot because I don't have the upper fullness to fill out the Lily/Marcie/etc., but the wires aren't quite right in more closed-on-top bras like the Lucy and the Bardot. As long as the wrinkling isn't terrible and the rest of the bra fits, it doesn't bother me, but it may bother you.  FWIW, based on an experience I had recently, I think the swan print's fabric and/or cut are part of the problem. Here are (crappy) photos of me in a 38F swan print(nsfw) vs. a 36FF parrot print(nsfw).  It does look like the wires are being pulled back by the tight band -- could you find an extender and see if it makes a positive difference?"
ABraThatFits,39gagl,braaccount,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:23:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I meant the extra space. Maybe I'm just used to stretchy lace cups that move with you on top, but it seemed like the extra space was a problem. Maybe you're right that it's not as big a deal.  Interesting about the print! Do you find that the parrot print is a lighter/less structured fabric than the swan? I was struck by how the swan fabric seemed a bit thicker than the other Cleo bras I tried.  I'll see if I can rustle up an extender! Thanks!"
ABraThatFits,39gagl,braaccount,2,Thu Jun 11 19:57:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, the parrot is thinner and less firm compared to the swan (from what I can remember from before I returned the swan). Same with the aqua, which I also own."

ABraThatFits,39gagl,noys,2,Thu Jun 11 20:23:51 2015 UTC,"I thought that might happen with the extender. :/ The wires look less distorted, but the cups should ideally fit when you're standing normally. One weird thing -- in the third-to-last picture, next to the two pairs of swans meeting at the bottom underwire, the cup appears to pucker inward and then restart. I wonder if that's an effect of you leaning back or if there's something else going on.  I think a different fabric in 28G/30FF could work, if you're not yet sick of ordering bras. :)"
ABraThatFits,39gagl,noys,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:38:21 2015 UTC,"I wouldnât have seen that pucker without you pointing it out. Weird! Iâll try it on again later tonight and see. Going to wait until after I shower first, though, since I just got sweaty walking the dog out in the heat.   The 30FF/other 28G arenât on Amazon Prime, but Iâm game to keep ordering bras if I can find them somewhere else with free shipping and returns.

ABraThatFits,39gagl,lcl0706,4,Thu Jun 11 20:48:59 2015 UTC,"It looks like your left breast is a touch smaller and that's why it seems too large. Your right breast seems to fill it up nicely. I agree with the suggestion of trying it with an extender.  You could also try the new version Cleo Erin, it has some fit differences compared to Lily and looks to be a touch more closed on top but it's not been reviewed much (so partially it's my own curiosity)."

Wearing a well-fitting bra that wasn't squishing them into oblivion has definitely changed my breast shape for the better, IMO. I'm not sure exactly how fast the side fullness evened out, but I know when I bought my first two bras I had gaping near the gore in one and now I've got spillage near the gore in the other one. I also became more projected and slightly more conical, and my root width became slightly narrower (at least on the left side)."
ABraThatFits,39ggkl,crazymusicalgenius96,3,Thu Jun 11 16:19:43 2015 UTC,"Breast shape, I believe, has much more to do with genetics and your individual body than with what shape of bra you wear. Your breast shape is going to change throughout your life and that's normal. It's possible that you lose upper fullness when you lose weight, but your tissue is more toward the bottom. It's also possible that you've experienced some tissue migration or firming from wearing a bra that is the correct volume.  There's nothing wrong with an omega shape."

The only thing I did a little weirdly was get a bra with too small a band so that I could use extenders for the first few months since I'm pretty big weight-wise and went on a trip travelling through Europe and Asia this last year. I knew I would be losing weight since I have been steadily for two years now and I didn't want to have to get a new bra since they can be hard to find in my size. All this to say: The band size got smaller, eventually I didn't need the extenders, then I went from the biggest hooks to the smallest, and I never experienced breast shape change. It was probably over a change of about 45 pounds downward. No change at all. So nice! It's something I've been afraid of, but everything seems to be cool :)  Edit: As with everything, YMMV."

ABraThatFits,39f3wo,hurrrrrmione,2,Thu Jun 11 23:52:18 2015 UTC,"Okay, so the bra calculator puts you at a 30DD/E. That means either a 30DD or a 30DDD (which is 30E in UK sizing, which is what the calculator and this sub use) might work because your measurements put you halfway in-between the two sizes, which is very common. It's also very common to own multiple sizes of bras anyway, because not all bras fit the same; some have tighter bands, some have looser bands, some fit smaller than other bras in the same size, some fit bigger than other bras in the same size, etc.   I know DD and DDD cups sound large, but a 30DD actually has less volume in the cups than a 34D and 30DDD has roughly the same volume cups as a 34D. Here are some pictures of women wearing properly fitted 30DD bras. Hopefully that helps with the ""sticker shock"" :)  It's great that you're open to trying underwire bras because there are way more options for bras to try that way, especially if we're looking at longline bras.

ABraThatFits,39f3wo,joanna70,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:04:54 2015 UTC,"Roots are one of the hardest shape factors to tell. Once you start trying on bras it'll become more evident, and we can help you with that if you post fit checks.   Check out this list for some brands that might carry your size and the offline retailer list for stores that should carry your size. Keep in mind that just because a brand carries 30 bands and DD or DDD cups doesn't mean they have 30DD and/or 30DDD bras, unfortunately. For example, Aerie carries 30 bands and up to a DD cup, but they only have up to a D cup in 30 bands.   If you have a Nordstrom near you, you can search their website by bra size and store availability. Just make sure you're looking at the right sizes: the search function lists 30DD as ""30E (US) (DD)"" and 30DDD as ""30F (US) (3D) / 30E (UK)"". The size selection on bras from UK brands is also listed using UK sizing - it'll let you know but do keep that in mind."

I'd return these and get a sister size in a smaller band size.
ABraThatFits,39dvsx,noys,7,Thu Jun 11 15:05:38 2015 UTC,"I'd return these and get a sister size in a smaller band size   Per the OP, she wore the bra out of the store and the impression I got is that she has worn it several times. How can you, in good conscience, advise returning worn merchandise that is not saleable when the problem is no fault of the store or the product? OP's sister chose that size because she wasn't used to the tighter band.   Lately I'm seeing posts where people speak of returning bras and the content of the posts suggests that the bras have definitely been worn. As a former retailer (not of bras, but the principle still applies) I'm becoming upset that there seems to be somewhat of an attitude on this sub that it's okay to return worn merchandise because you're unhappy with the fit or comfort, when the product isn't at fault per se. I'm not saying it's true of everyone, of course, but I find it cropping up repeatedly. I know as well as anybody that it can be hard to impossible to judge the fit of a bra until you've really worn it, but such is life--it's just not fair to retailers to expect them to take back unsaleable merchandise that isn't faulty.   *Edited for clarity."
ABraThatFits,39dvsx,Goddess_Keira,5,Thu Jun 11 16:47:13 2015 UTC,I must have missed that part. I wouldn't suggest returning a worn bra.
ABraThatFits,39dvsx,noys,3,Thu Jun 11 17:28:16 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'm relieved to hear that. Thanks."
ABraThatFits,39dvsx,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:48:39 2015 UTC,I told her to try 30 bands but she could not tolerate the tightness.  The associate at Nordstroms have her the 32 and she loved it. I know it's not ideal but she was adamant about wanting to be comfortable. She is open to the idea of sizing down the band as she gets used to it
ABraThatFits,39dvsx,noys,3,Thu Jun 11 22:42:54 2015 UTC,The thing is... A 32 band on tightest hooks is pretty much the same as a 30 band on loosest. This is purely psychological.
ABraThatFits,39dvsx,noys,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:27:56 2015 UTC,"So here are her 5 measurements:  Snug under: 30""  BTT: 27.5""  Overbust: 35""  Leaning: 37""  Laying: 34.5""  She's projected, even fullness, and has wide roots (runs in the family). Any suggestions?"
ABraThatFits,39dvsx,noys,2,Thu Jun 11 23:19:26 2015 UTC,"If Deco Vibe isn't too narrow for her she doesn't have wide roots.  32E seems to be the right volume, I'd sister size to 30F. I don't know how you got the calculator to give you a 28 band apart from you entering the measurements in the wrong order (27.5 in the snug field).  Is she willing to try bras that aren't molded or padded? I'd love to see her in a Cleo Marcie."
ABraThatFits,39dvsx,t_maia,2,Fri Jun 12 01:32:24 2015 UTC,"Ok I'm going to hand it over to my sister:  Sister here! I am not a fan of bras that are not molded or padded due to sensitive skin issues. In the past those types of bras have either made me itch incessantly OR gave me a rash (and who really wants too deal with a rash on the girls?)  As for the 30 vs 32 band thingy, I only just switched to the tightest hooks a few days ago and I can only do it for a few hours before the pressure at the gore is too much to handle :)"
ABraThatFits,39dvsx,Crikey-Way,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:17:53 2015 UTC,"There are some lace bras that are itchy but there are also ones that aren't. If your only frame of reference is badly fitting bras they moved around on your body in a way that well fitting ones won't. It's just worth a try and will also give a much clearer image about the fit... Currently I can basically only judge fit by the breast that's outside the bra as a molded bra will keep its own shape and there's no way to tell what's going on in there. Maybe the underwires are too low and there's a gap between them and the breast root. I just can't tell.  If she's set against it the only options are Masquerade halfcups,  maybe Curvy Kate ones (they might expect too tall roots) and Masquerade molded bras beyond Freya Deco."
ABraThatFits,39eg28,brassieker,12,Thu Jun 11 04:43:25 2015 UTC,"A 3-hook closure is going to provide more support in the band, and probably needless to say, that becomes much more important in the larger cup and band sizes. However, I wouldn't say that having three hooks necessarily reduces the dreaded ""back fat"". It may do that for some, but it's not something you can depend on."
ABraThatFits,39eg28,Goddess_Keira,3,Thu Jun 11 05:39:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a lot of the reducing back fat thing depends on the type of elastic used in the band too. Long lines which usually have 5+ tend to reduce back fat more reliably I think."
ABraThatFits,39eg28,otterhugs,10,Thu Jun 11 05:46:10 2015 UTC,"I freaking love three hook bras, why Cleo doesn't do them I will never fully understand."
ABraThatFits,39eg28,dwellondreams,3,Thu Jun 11 09:00:02 2015 UTC,I'm sworn off Cleo for precisely that reason. Their bands just cannot distribute my bust weight in a way that's comfortable for all day wear (For me).
ABraThatFits,39eg28,anytime_yoga,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:37:16 2015 UTC,I still wear Cleo-- I've not found anything that fits better than Cleo Meg.   They say it's because wide bands aren't young looking or something? They should do them in G+ cups I think.
ABraThatFits,39eg28,dwellondreams,3,Thu Jun 11 14:53:32 2015 UTC,"My daily wear bras are all Comexim now, which is probably just as well.  I've heard the ""young"" explanation before, but I find it unconvincing. Other brands with younger target demographics -- Curvy Kate, Tutti Rouge -- manage to do 3-hook closures without completely changing the aesthetics of their bras."
ABraThatFits,39eg28,anytime_yoga,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:05:05 2015 UTC,"I think it's a load of crap too. I assume most of the women on ABTF are pretty young, and lots of us prefer a wider band."
ABraThatFits,39eg28,dwellondreams,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:12:27 2015 UTC,I feel that Cleo targets a younger market than CK and Tutti Rouge. Another rant of mine is how few large bust bras suit teenagers.
ABraThatFits,39eg28,goodoldfreda,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:44:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed! I cringe when young girls need a bra, but have large breasts and really should not be in something sheer (call me prude, but whatever).

ABraThatFits,39eg28,SaltyBlackBroad,2,Thu Jun 11 16:01:24 2015 UTC,"I disagree on the sheer bras thing. I wear them. I like them.

ABraThatFits,39eg28,goodoldfreda,2,Thu Jun 11 16:32:33 2015 UTC,"Understood. I will say, however, from the feedback of parents and many of the young girls (13,14,15) I have fit do not like the sheerness and would like to either see themselves/their daughters in something more ""solid""."
ABraThatFits,39eg28,SaltyBlackBroad,5,Thu Jun 11 16:34:44 2015 UTC,Well the parents can kindly go screw themselves and not dictate their daughters' underwear :P

ABraThatFits,39eg28,SaltyBlackBroad,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:00:18 2015 UTC,"Well, as a parent I would not appreciate my, say, 13-year-old daughter having that attitude. If the daughter in question is an older teen-ager that's one thing. I still don't want to be told to ""go screw myself"" by my child, and should you choose become a parent some day I expect you'll feel the same (actually, I rather doubt anybody enjoys being told that under any circumstances). But for a girl 15 or under I think it's quite appropriate for the mother to have plenty of input on what's appropriate in a bra. Most particularly when the girls are newly developing and/or when a very young girl develops precociously mature breasts, there is a complete lack of age-appropriate bras."
ABraThatFits,39eg28,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:13:31 2015 UTC,"A bit tangental, but I tend to agree with this. Several years ago, I worked at a major lingerie retailer and was asked to fit my ex's daughter. He didn't even want her wearing bras because she was ""too young for lingerie"" at 13, even though she was a very mature girl intellectually... And physically. I put her in something like a 32c based on the +4 method the damn store had taught me, though she was more like a 26F by 15. All the beige moulded tshirt bras I bought her were deemed ""boring"" by her mother, who bought her something ""sexier"", which the teen claimed to prefer (I think she was uncomfortable and just seeking mom's approval, but that's another story). Wars raged every time my ex happened upon our laundry room on hand wash day. I WISH I had the resources at the time to give that young lady a proper fitting bra that was pretty or cute but still age appropriate.... I'm thinking she would love the Freya long lines, mostly due to the patterns."
ABraThatFits,39eg28,joanna70,3,Fri Jun 12 02:21:53 2015 UTC,I'm long waisted but have a flared ribcage so can't do longlines but I love my 3 hook bands.  I need stability for my ribcage shape to stop them riding up and it definitely helps having it wider.  Only a very slight change in back fat.
ABraThatFits,39eg28,yellkaa,3,Thu Jun 11 08:34:10 2015 UTC,"As for me, the more hooks are there, the better my back looks in the bra and the less my back feels the pressure"
ABraThatFits,39eg28,LadyVerene,3,Thu Jun 11 15:55:55 2015 UTC,I love 3 hook bras. They feel so much comfier for me.  I love my Cleo Lucy but I really wish it had three hooks instead of just two.
ABraThatFits,39eg28,bailacueca,2,Thu Jun 11 17:03:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I might be on the smaller end of the ""large cup"" sizes, but I really prefer two hook bras for ease. Ive found that a tall wing feels more supportive to me than three hooks."
ABraThatFits,39eg28,babybearxx,2,Thu Jun 11 11:16:56 2015 UTC,I have experienced that my 2 hook bras are okay when the bra has straps because you get support mostly from the band but also from the straps. The only case where my personal experience has been better with more hooks is in strapless bras to add more support. Hope this helps. :)
ABraThatFits,39eg28,syrusbliz,2,Thu Jun 11 14:45:14 2015 UTC,"I'm inching down the band size wagon; currently between 34 and 36 (kinda frustrating) but don't imagine I'll get smaller than 32.

It helps the band of the bra stay more stable and not hook into my underbust fat and not being even with the underwire, as well as helping prevent the cups from tipping forward with more tension being distributed along to the hooks.

Just tried a Comexim Basic in 65H which is great for depth and width, but I have tall roots so it cuts into them and there's gapping at the top because I'm more full even but favor bottom. I've been told I'm shallow and need shallow bras which only squish me more. Not to mention shallow bras mean wide wires and I'm narrow preferring 5.0-5.2 width anything more cuts into my arm pits and hurts. I'm just feeling so lost and ready to give up. I've been trying to find a correct fitting bra for like 4 years now. But every time I think I've finally found the right size (I know size varys depending on brand and even from model to model) my boob grow and I'm back to the start.  Sorry for this long vent. Been keeping it in for awhile because everyone I talk bras to thinks I'm crazy and there's no way I'm actually a E cup not to mention a 30 band cause Victoria Secret doesn't make that size so I must be making it up."

That's the great thing about this community - we all get that finding bras is a long and difficult process. With your narrowness, I'm not really sure that a shop in SLC would be able to cater to you even if they did carry 30 bands. Most British bras are going to be too shallow and wide for you.  65H in Comexim Basic is roughly equivalent to 30F/FF UK (it runs a little small). I think Ewa Michalak CHP is graded more narrowly by the time you hit 65F/FF, but I'm not totally positive on that. Ewa does size-adjusted grading, so the small bras are shallower than the larger bras. But I'm pretty sure the major transition starts right at 65F, so it could be an option for you."

ABraThatFits,39dutc,noys,4,Thu Jun 11 12:21:10 2015 UTC,"There is a buying guide in the sidebar that links to a list of offline retailers. Do check each boutique thoroughly, some use US sizing and that's quite a bit smaller than UK one. For example US J is UK GG.  I think you're more likely to fit in 40 or 42 band as bra bands get stretchier in band sizes above 38 as stretch isn't a set amount, it's proportional to the length of fabric."

Sadly these brands are not readily available in stores. You are far more likely to find Elomi and Goddess bras in this size range, plus maybe Aviana and Elila.    Still, if you get a chance to try on Elomi and Goddess bras in larger sizes, do so.   If you are in a larger metro area in the USA, Lane Bryant in US 44H (= UK 44G) would be worth a shot.

A lot depends on the type of activities you're doing, impact level and personal preference. Here's a few that come in your size range:   Elomi EL8041--underwire/encapsulation and has the advantage that it works well as an every day bra so long as you don't mind it being very high cut. Considered good for high impact, though I wouldn't expect it to be no-bounce. Goddess GD5056--no underwire; compression bra for medium impact. Glamorise 1166--no underwire; combination compression and encapsulation; has adjustable front layer for different levels of impact. Said to run very tight in the band, but it's available in 46 band if you need to size up."

ABraThatFits,39e4p3,Goddess_Keira,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:09:04 2015 UTC,I actually got sized by someone who does it for a living and I came out to in between a 42B and 44B (not quite filling the cup out though).

ABraThatFits,39e4p3,aboywithgirls,2,Fri Jun 19 17:54:23 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I'm a bit concerned reading that size. Many fitters are excellent; others not so much. While the calculator can definitely overestimate cup size, a 44C is the smallest size that your measurements as given would indicate. Our experience on the sub suggests that for trans women, the lying bust measurement is often the most accurate; for you that would be 44D. However of course this is not 100% and the calculator output is only a starting place.   Why I feel concern about the size the fitter gave you is that you say the cups are not filled out in a 44B, yet that's 2 cup volumes smaller than your most likely cup size. This can often happen when the cups are too small, because the bra is too narrow in the wires, the bra rides up and the top of the cups isn't filled.  With that said, though, since you've ordered a bra already you will know more once that arrives. If you are so inclined, you can always post a fit check--fit pictures are completely optional."

ABraThatFits,39cqvi,Pikachu42,6,Wed Jun 10 21:58:16 2015 UTC,"I did my initial inventory purchase from LM three years ago when I opened my boutique. I hope my perspective helps. They are  basically a wholesale distributor. They really don't  ""know sizes"" per se, but from a retailer standpoint they are good at letting a shop owner know what pieces move quickly and are good sellers. They are not necessarily in the bra fitting business. While they know certain brands, they really are not specialists in that field. They buy overstocks and get great deals on items at wholesale because they buy in bulk and pass the savings on to the wholesaler and the consumer.  (Hence, the boxes of items. Imagine the markup if all of that stuff was put out- those are labor hours and expenses that are passed along to the buyer) For me, I walked in and told the owner Steve ""Hi, I'm opening a lingerie boutique in San Antonio and I don't know what to buy"". Walking into 15K square feet of panties, bras, teddies, camisoles, robes and crotchless panties was overwhelming. Steve was great. He told me what sold well, where everything was, explained the pricing structure and gave me a nice rack to roll around the warehouse to use while I shopped. I was there for 4 days, and at the end of each day he let me keep all of my choices on my rack so that I could pick up where I left off the day before. He also knew I had driven ALL THE WAY from San Antonio to Atlanta and was kind enough to pack everything in boxes and made sure everything fit in my crumb of a car, and let me keep everything there boxed up until I left town. The staff was very friendly and Steve gave me great advice. I wish I would have known then what I know now and gotten the ""better bras"" the (the Elomi's and the Fantasie's, Freya's, etc.) that he had instead of the bottom basement brands, but I would have never known how different bras were without having the crappy ones that first year and realizing I had so much to learn.  The warehouse was very organized when I was there. In the room to the left, bras and panties, in the center room, lingerie, sleepwear, robes, and boxed items, and the right room had ""dump bin"" and packaged items. I found my way around pretty easily.  The retail portion I thought was put together nicer than I thought a dude could lay it out; kudos to him.  All in all, I had a really good experience with them. Things may have changed since then, but from time to time I'm tempted to jump in the car and take a drive to Alpharetta and see what they have in stock. If only it weren't 18 hours away."

My only other bras I have found are only matrix bras but I can tell you what I have to look for is the shape of a halfcup, not a shallow cup shape but it has to have little initial projection (like a 45 degree angle) while still having projection in the apex."
ABraThatFits,39d1p9,takeoutcharlie,2,Thu Jun 11 02:48:07 2015 UTC,"I recommend Gossard. I'm a very similar shape and I have two Gossard bras that I LOVE. I think the kind I have is the Super Boost Lace or something like that. Naturally, the tag doesn't say.   One is a 30DD from when I was trying to find my size; the other is 30E and fits perfectly. The 30DD still works though thanks to the flexibility of lace.   My only complaint is that I can sometimes see the lace if I'm wearing a really thin shirt, but even then it's not the worst.  I also have two Conexim bras that fit well. I bought them after reading that they have narrow wires that work for conical shapes."
ABraThatFits,39d1p9,gliterpoison,2,Thu Jun 11 04:27:52 2015 UTC,"So, as a fellow conical, what is the number on the Gossard bra? And which Comexim bras do you like the fit of? I am always looking for things that fit well. My best fit is a Freya Patsy half cup"

The Comexim style that I couldn't remember is Nevada. I bought it and the Nude T-Shirt bra through Wellfitting (link is for Nude T-Shirt).  FAIR WARNING in regards to the Comexim bras: The seams definitely show through tops unless the fabric is heavily textured or it's a loose-fitting shirt made from that synthetic silky stuff. I can occasionally get away with wearing a t-shirt but it has to be a bit loose. For example, the bras' seams show significantly when I wear this layering tank top from Target, which is 70% rayon and 30% polyester- and it's a size medium, which is form-fitting but nowhere near snug or tight on me."

ABraThatFits,39dh9j,ruffledfeathers10,2,Thu Jun 11 00:57:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that I'd describe your shape as shallow necessarily -- the Claudette (a typically shallow bra) is obviously not deep enough for you, that's why you're getting that cutting in along the inner seam. The Starlet and Deco look good (though molded bras can hide a lot of fit issues). The starlet wants a smidge more upper fullness, and also a smidge taller root than what you have, but otherwise it suits your shape well.  You could very likely get away with re-buying deco, and I also think you'd be well suited to some Panache bras like Andorra and Envy. Cleo Lucy might be a possibility, but it could potentially be too deep in the center of the cup.  Other unlined Freya's are worth investigating as well :)"
ABraThatFits,39dh9j,buymeflowers,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:58:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your input! I have a couple other decos that I really like for a seamless bra but I want to find a good go-to seamed bra. I thought I leaned shallow because the Cleo Juna (30FF) was also a good fit for me but the higher gore made it uncomfortable to wear all day. I'll have to re-visit some of the other Panache & Cleo cuts, I was frustrated early on because the 30s I tried on were too tight and all the 32s were too loose."
ABraThatFits,39dh9j,buymeflowers,2,Thu Jun 11 02:13:53 2015 UTC,"Juna isn't super shallow in your size range, either. It's pretty middle of the road.  I've always struggled with the same issues with Panache/Cleo, some 32s are great, others feel like they're trying to murder me, but then a 34 is always too loose :/.  Try getting a pack ofof bra band extenders if you haven't already, they're fantastic for those situations.  The Starlet is so close (and so pretty) that I really do feel like it's worth a shot to explore other unlined Freya's. Unfortunately it's a huge sea to navigate. Maybe the Patsy plunge (a bit shorter in the cup) or Rio (a bit more friendly to even shapes)."

ABraThatFits,39d2o3,Crikey-Way,15,Thu Jun 11 06:55:41 2015 UTC,"There's a huge obsession about breasts and female sexuality in general IMO. It's way over exaggerated.

ABraThatFits,39d2o3,plutonium743,12,Wed Jun 10 23:38:46 2015 UTC,Men in Ancient Rome used to wager on what colour the strophium (band of cloth used to bind a woman's breasts) was on women they saw out at the theatre or other public places.

ABraThatFits,39d2o3,joanna70,4,Thu Jun 11 12:00:42 2015 UTC,I so understand. I'm a 14 y.o with a small ribcage and medium-sized boobs and the few people I have let know of my size don't 100% believe it. They look even more proportinate when you pair my chest with broad shoulders and a 5'8 and 1/2 height and a long torso and legs.
ABraThatFits,39d2o3,Chandra99,4,Thu Jun 11 03:03:32 2015 UTC,"Information is power and you'll get confidence from that, why not take all your measurements and know your proper size?  It sounds like you have a reasonable idea but at your age it will be changing all the time.  As you've gathered there is no such thing as a ""B cup"" or whatever, 30G that I wear sounds huge yet it's not, and the cup will be much smaller and a 40G.  It also fit SO much better than the various 36B, 34C, 34D and 32DD I've been professionally fitted into before (when I was almost certainly a 30F).  In a well fitting bra some people would guess above a D cup for me, but mostly they'd say I was smaller.  When I was at Uni a male friend saw me, for the first time, in a skin tight but firm dress, with no bra, and expressed disappointment I wasnt as big as he thought I was.  I went and got another drink and had a great night anyway, silly man!"

ABraThatFits,39d2o3,gliterpoison,3,Thu Jun 11 12:03:15 2015 UTC,"So many guys think they can judge what a woman's bra size is just by looking at her. Inevitably, because I usually have the biggest boobs in the room, someone tries to guess my bra size. I would say 95% say, ""Your boobs are pretty big. You're a DD, right?"" I haven't been a legit DD since I was 13 or 14 years old but I also don't want to go around telling everybody my bra size so more often than not, I just lie and tell them they're right."
ABraThatFits,39d2o3,gliterpoison,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:56:44 2015 UTC,"agreed. that friend who said she is a B cup, probably might be way bigger than that, since she is on the heavy side too. I just say B cup, since people always have the impression of certain sizes."

ABraThatFits,39d9yj,drawingdwarf,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:02:24 2015 UTC,"What shape are you? I would check ebay, /r/braswap, and bratabase for some cheap stuff since it sounds like you'll be changing size a lot. Maybe just get one or two bras in your new size and then get a couple more when you change sizes again."
ABraThatFits,39cxvb,TheDodgyStalker,5,Wed Jun 10 22:43:59 2015 UTC,"Well, obviously these are both too small, but also both Maddie and Charlotte are quite shallow bras.  Maddie more so.  I'd pass on trying these again, they'll be shape mismatches no matter what size you try them in.  You definitely have projection.  Charlotte's band has been rumored to run tight.  So that could be why it felt like crap.  I highly suspect both your balconette Charlotte and the Patsy padded half cup will also be too shallow and small.  You'll probably find the Freya band to be too big though.  With your measurements and Freya bras, I'd stick to 30's.  For padded bras, try Cleo Juna - in our size range it's quite a bit deeper/more projected than the Maddie and the Juna in smaller sizes.  If you're willing to do unlined bras, try out Cleo Marcie - that's a great diagnose-my-shape bra.  Also, Panache Envy may work well for you, it gets along with pendulous and projected shapes."
ABraThatFits,39cxvb,lcl0706,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:54:26 2015 UTC,"I'm really wary of going smaller in the band, because I can't stand tight bras. I'm super sensitive to that. But with Freya I'll keep that in mind.  I'm not a huge fan of unlined bras because I have very friendly nipples :) haha but I may try one just to see.   Thanks for the suggestions! Do you think I should step up just one cup size or two?"
ABraThatFits,39cxvb,lcl0706,2,Wed Jun 10 22:59:15 2015 UTC,"It's hard to tell because these two bras are also so shallow and such a bad shape mismatch.  But I'd say 2, to venture a guess."
ABraThatFits,39cxvb,lcl0706,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:05:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Any other suggestions for padded bras? They don't need to be molded or anything, even slightly lined is good."
ABraThatFits,39cxvb,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:10:59 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately padded/molded bras by UK brands are almost all varying degrees of shallow, some worse than others.  If you want a truly projected padded or molded bra, you'll need to go Polish.  The original Freya Deco is somewhat projected, more so than a lot of other Deco varieties.  It's quite molded.  And the Juna, which isn't as stiffly molded as the Deco, it's more of a softly lined, pre-shaped but not stiff bra - which FYI, runs at least a cup size small so size up for sure in that one.  You already need at least a 32FF in any bra so I'd tell you 32G if not 32GG in Juna.  Lulu Tout Madeline by Figleaves was a surprise hit for me... it's kind of average projection.  Better than the Maddie or Charlotte."
ABraThatFits,39cxvb,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:50:17 2015 UTC,"I was looking at the Cleo Juna but it's not on sale on amazon in my size :/ and it's a little more than I want to spend at the moment since I'm trying out multiple bras.  I was looking at the Panache Floris and the Cleo Lilly and Marcie also, but I'm not sure whether to go with 32FF or 32G, OR even higher. I hate this shit. I'll got look at Figleaves for the Madeline though!"
ABraThatFits,39cxvb,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:55:26 2015 UTC,"I checked the measurements on Bratabase and Charlotte's band is a bit shorter in 32F than Maddie with a bit less stretch. Maddie's cup is deeper than Charlotte's as well. So like /u/lcl0706 said, you need more projection, which makes sense since both bras are too small.  Is the gore tacking on the Maddie?"
ABraThatFits,39cxvb,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:34:15 2015 UTC,"no, the gore is a little raised."
ABraThatFits,39bzji,bleedmercury,6,Wed Jun 10 19:07:33 2015 UTC,"Judging by how Cleo Lily fits I think you should try Cleo Marcie and if you can still find them somewhere the older bras that Cleo Lily was based on, Cleo Sasha, Alexa or Olivia.  You have a tall root that acts functionally full on top rather than a classic shallow shape. How well you fill up Deco is another sign of that. You should also check out Masquerade halfcups."
ABraThatFits,39bzji,noys,3,Wed Jun 10 20:12:55 2015 UTC,"My boobs do the same thing to bras that are too shallow, so you are not alone there!   I agree that the Cleo Lily in 28DD looks great, it's only wrinkling a tiny bit at the seam. My guess is that Lily in this size range is average in projection and width, rather than being super narrow and projected.  I think you've got the ""tall roots with bottom projection"" shape that's described quite effectively in this thread. http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/2lzkwn/discussion_how_many_of_you_have_projection_but/ There are lots of recommendations for bras that might possibly work.

Bras can get weird in 28D/DD. But if the scaling isn't horrible, I totally recommend Masquerade Medina and Freya Daydreamer. I didn't mention Masquerade Medina in the post as I didn't own it at the time, but it's a nice projected half cup that isn't quite as open on top as most half cups."

The number one biggest issue I have is bras not having enough lower protection and having too much up top resulting in gaps/wrinkles. This is how Cleo Lily fit me in 28DD as well seems OK besides the little bit of wrinkling up top but what you can't see is there wasn't enough room on bottom. Lucy in 28DD is a perfect fit for me. Enough room on bottom and top. Marcie wasn't a horrible fit on me either like Lily, again just not enough room on bottom.   Hopefully my experience helped a little. I'd recommend trying both Marcie and Lucy just to be sure and hopefully one works :)"

ABraThatFits,39b4oe,Mollysaurus,13,Wed Jun 10 15:43:39 2015 UTC,"http://www.brabandproject.com/gallery/search?band=32&cup=DD&age=&brand=&sister_sizes=0&search=Search  Check that link out.  Those are real women wearing real 32DD's, it's not as insane as you think it is, it's just letter shock because of what we're taught to believe DD's look like.  Do those boobs look anything like your boobs?  Do you know what your shape might be?  Have you checked out the shape guide on the sidebar?  Since your leaning bust measurement is 3"" more than your lying, I'd venture a guess you have some level of projection.  Your root width will make a difference too, but that can all be determined once you start trying on bras.  Your current bra fitting problems all likely stem from a band that is too big, which can cause all sorts of problems with the cup - not filling them, the bra riding up, and pushing your boobs into the cups sound like a band that's too big and a cup that's quite a bit too small.  A 34A is designed for someone who measures 34 around and 35 OB.  Not you!  Here's what I would do.  Go to Nordstroms, take a measuring tape and a notepad with you.  Try not to let the fitting ladies there bug you too much, they'll probably be wrong.  Measure the cup width and depth of each bra you try on, and jot that down.  Take pictures wearing the bra - front and profile. Even if you don't buy anything, make notes of how they fit (or didn't) and why, and come back here and make a fit check post.  You don't have to post the pics if you want, but keep them for your own reference.  Good diagnostic bras are the Cleo unlined bras - Marcie, Lily, and Lucy.  Lily is discontinued but still available on Amazon.  The last Norstroms I was in didn't carry anything Cleo, so it might be worth a gander on Amazon and doing some returns and exchanges.  Those bras will definitely help you and us asses your shape and narrow down what may or may not work for you going forward.  Nordstrom should have some Freya, some Panache, it depends on your store.  They'll probably have a big selection of 32DD in Natori and Calvin Klein, but those are not UK brands, and are also fairly shallow bras IIRC.  But really, try on everything you can find in a 32DD and take notes, you might also try some 32D's - sometimes this calculator leans too heavily on the leaning bust measurement, but really I don't think 32DD is too far off.  32DD is also carried at VS, but keep in mind almost ALL VS bras are quite wide and shallow, so they may not agree with your shape.  Don't forget to scoop and swoop - read this wonderful blog post about why it's so important, and start doing it from the very first bra you put on: http://brasandbodyimage.com/2012/09/05/putting-your-bra-on-properly/  Good luck, and post away!  This community is very helpful."

ABraThatFits,39b4oe,M_tridactyla,8,Wed Jun 10 17:17:30 2015 UTC,"The nice thing is that US size is (almost always) consistent with UK up to DD, so a US 32DD is a UK 32DD.  Feel free to try on 32Ds and 32DDDs (=UK 32E) as well; most people have bras in a few different cup sizes. You might want to try 30E in brands with stretchy bands such as Freya.  Your bra fit problems sound like your breasts are escaping due to too-small cups and a too-loose band.  Do you have any idea about your shape? Full on top, bottom, even? Narrow or wider roots? Shallow or projected?"
ABraThatFits,39b4oe,noys,2,Wed Jun 10 16:39:39 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure I have slightly shallow projection and narrow roots. Fullness...I'd say they are even leaning toward full on bottom... wait, no... fuller on top and not at all on the bottom. A 2/4 according to the guide. Maybe a 3/4.  EDIT: I am going to wait until I can really investigate in a mirror with my laptop in tow."

ASOS is another place that has great shipping and returns policies if you're looking to shop online, although currently they're out of Lucy in your size. They carry a lot of Freya."
ABraThatFits,39cjsy,lcl0706,2,Wed Jun 10 21:12:49 2015 UTC,"I think the minor quadding you're getting might be caused by Lily being slightly too closed on top for you. You're getting that same wrinkling at the apex as the person who just posted about her Lily in 28DD. The top section on Lily is extremely specific about where the fullness is supposed to be. And the quadboob settling might be caused by the wires being a bit short and the band being a bit loose.  The width is good, I think.   The wrinkling at the bottom of the cup could be happening because the wire isn't exactly the same shape as your IMF? If you try to smooth out the wrinkles, what happens then?  No idea what's up with the side wrinkling, honestly."
ABraThatFits,39cjsy,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:15:59 2015 UTC,"Could indeed be too closed off.  I was really surprised when I opened it up, everyone says Lucy is the FOB-Cleo but I thought this Lily looked more closed off on top than my Lucy did.  But Lucy isn't really a good fit on me, it's too wide in a 28G and I never tried a 28FF - I bet it would be too closed off then.  Who knows.  I think you're totally right about the wire shape at the bottom and my IMF.  I can smooth the wrinkles out if I pull the fabric sideways or up, but they come back eventually.  I hadn't considered the bottom of the underwire might curve down more than the bottom of my root.  This is the only unlined bra I've tried so far that doesn't irritate my skin.  It's not mesh and not lace!  I haven't decided yet what I think about the fit.  I do wish the wires came up just a hair taller on the sides.  Sigh.  I reallly want it to work for me, it's extremely comfortable and so cute."
ABraThatFits,39cjsy,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Wed Jun 10 22:47:40 2015 UTC,"If it's comfortable, then keep it! I'd suggest wearing it for a few hours to see if the short sides get uncomfortable and then deciding what to do."
ABraThatFits,39cjsy,buymeflowers,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:50:53 2015 UTC,"The quadding goes away as my boob ""settles"" - what causes that and does that say anything about the fit?   One possibility is that you have soft tissue, which makes it easier to S&S a bit too vigorously. When I S&S, I can get my larger breast to quad in pretty much any bra, no matter the size, but after I take a few steps I always settle into the cups easily. My tissue is quite soft and it's easy to get non-breast tissue into the cup (this is kind of a gray area filled with debate, but IMO if you S&S and your bra is decently well sized and shaped in band, cup and wire, and you still lose some of your S&S after a few minutes of movement, then the tissue that's escaping is probably not meant to be there in the first place.)  The wrinkling on the bottom could be from a few different things -- try to gently tug on the cup to get it to lie flat. Does that change the fit of the top of the cup at all?  I'll be honest, I would have expected the wires on Lily to look narrower than they do here. Since you're in a band size up, it's unlikely that band tension is distorting the wires. Is it possible that when you S&S you're stretching the wires out to accommodate wider roots? How are the wire marks when you take the bra off? (It's entirely possible that there is nothing wrong and it's just the angle of the photos throwing things off.)"

I even had one woman tell me that there are a lot of men out there that should be wearing one. It's becoming more common place for men to shop for their own bras.i have never been fitted by someone who hasn't fitted a man before. I know that there are a lot of ladies who don't like to wear a bra but I don't mind.  I only wish that I was still a D cup or less.

The Chi Chi had horrible reviews for being super small but it looks like it goes bigger on Amazon than the other site.  THank you for the help!  The thing I liked about herroom.com is that it gave you an idea of whether or not the bra would show under different style shirts.  The larger bras tend to go practically up to your neck which is ok if you only want to wear crew necks or wear a camisole layer under everything."
ABraThatFits,39bz1j,ChristinexMarie,5,Wed Jun 10 19:04:19 2015 UTC,"Firstly, do you have the padded half cup or the unlined plunge balcony?  How long does it take for the wire to snap? I've owned Freya bras for the last 6 months and they're all approximately 1/3 of the way through their lifespans, so 6 in one year is pretty unusual. However, Freya's underwires get kind of unstable in higher cup volumes, and your size is around the volume where the wires get funky. So that could be part of the problem.  Where is the wire snapping? Right in the middle? Or near one of the sides? Even if you're in the right size, your shape might not be compatible enough with the bra, putting pressure on that single point.   I suggest remeasuring, as even if you haven't gained weight you could have had some tissue migration. Post your new measurements and your shape characteristics, and we'll try and find a bra that's not going to snap on you."
ABraThatFits,39bz1j,crazymusicalgenius96,3,Wed Jun 10 19:33:03 2015 UTC,"Woopsy, sorry, I'm in the padded half cup version. I knew I was leaving something out. The wire generally snaps on the right breast, which is odd as it's my smaller boob (mine are kind of uneven). It's generally about two thirds of the way over to the right. I'm going to go and grab my tape measurer and I'll post my measurements as soon as I do that."
ABraThatFits,39bz1j,t_maia,6,Wed Jun 10 19:36:02 2015 UTC,"Sounds like the wire is too narrow for your right breast. In this case your smaller breast is actually your larger - but it looks smaller because it is shallower and wider.   Try 38G, one cupsize up."
ABraThatFits,39bz1j,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:49:30 2015 UTC,"Alrighty, so for measurements I got 42 and a 1/2 inches for comfortable underbust, 39 for tight underbust, 53 for standing bust, 56 at a 90 degree angle, and 50 for laying down.   I also looked at the shallow/projected real pictures from the beginners guide (link here: http://i.imgur.com/N8mnDf0.jpg) and my boobs look the most like Bust D 30 E Projected. I'm definitely not that size, but that's the most similar shape to my own breasts.   For fullness I'd have to say I'm closest to FT 3/5? But that is the one that I'm least positive about because my breasts are very pendulous.   I'm kind of shocked at how my my breasts have changed shape in the past year and a half. I guess I kind of thought as the shape as stagnant?"
ABraThatFits,39bz1j,joanna70,4,Wed Jun 10 20:01:21 2015 UTC,"Going off your laying measurement, I get 40FF/G, so the 38FF definitely sounds too small/narrow.   Shape is definitely not stagnant! I've had noticeable shape changes since I started wearing well-fitting bras 7 months ago. Shape is also affected by weight gain/loss, pregnancy, life in general. Basically anything that affects your size can also affect your shape."
ABraThatFits,39bz1j,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:24:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Since I'm not as shallow as I was, I'm thinking that maybe the Patsy padded half cup might not be the right shape? But I'm kind of judging that by pictures on bratabase, which probably isn't the best way to do that, haha. I was kind of looking at the Curvy Kate Princess Balcony bra, but I don't know if that would be waaay to projected for me?  Or should I try sticking with the patsy in my actual size?"
ABraThatFits,39bz1j,crazymusicalgenius96,3,Wed Jun 10 20:35:14 2015 UTC,Your bust measurements cover quite a range so this almost certainly means you're projected.  As my boobs have got all their tissue back (I had a lot of migration before ABTF) they've stayed the same width but got more volume so more projection and the styles I wear have changed slightly.

I'm no expert, so hopefully someone here can chime in!"
ABraThatFits,399vti,toffeeface,5,Wed Jun 10 09:26:41 2015 UTC,I thought orange in a glass was a projection issue?
ABraThatFits,399vti,marijuana_andmakeup,7,Wed Jun 10 12:51:41 2015 UTC,"No, although people use it interchangably, referencig low underwires and wrinkling, the derivation of it is that an orange is wider than a drinking glass, even if it is a smaller volume."
ABraThatFits,399vti,joanna70,5,Wed Jun 10 13:20:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I think I've only seen it used in that one context.   So as far as fit, depending on their breast shape you would determine if the issue is wires or projection and move in either direction to address it."
ABraThatFits,399vti,marijuana_andmakeup,5,Wed Jun 10 13:42:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, wire width is the best starting point, if too narrow the OIG, if just right or too wide then look to lower projection."

ABraThatFits,399vti,brassieker,15,Fri Jun 12 03:24:06 2015 UTC,"It equally could be the opposite.  Now I was a 30F before wearing ABTF but had been incorrectly in a 36B because I was shallow, I suspect you're not (as your boobs are likely less ""stealthy"" so you're not far off your correct cup volume), so the bottom of the cup could be too shallow for your boobs so they migrate up to find more space.  Do you think this could be it, often accompanied by too wide wires?  These are the two main reasons for cups sliding down.  Shape is REALLY important - wire width must be right (up to 1/2"" too wide seldom causes problems, too narrow does) and the cup shape too."
ABraThatFits,399vti,joanna70,11,Wed Jun 10 09:43:33 2015 UTC,"I can think of 3 4 possible reasons:    Orange in a Glass, as said by /u/toffeeface - which means the wires are too narrow. Not enough immediate projection - as said by /u/joanna70 (bottom of the cup goes out in an upwards angle but you need it to go out horizontally) You have a V-shaped ribcage.  As said by /u/mrslizard - gore too wide."

I am currently a 34GG (UK) = 75J in German.  From reading this sub a lot, I realised I have close-set breasts. There is about one finger's width between them. All of my bras used to slide down cause there was just not enough room for the gore to sit higher. So far, altering some bras to make the gore as narrow as possible has helped with the sliding down quite a bit."

ABraThatFits,39ad22,LikeIsaidPotato,13,Wed Jun 10 11:54:35 2015 UTC,"Nah, that's not normal. A well-fitting bra will actually feel like it's not there. Try putting on the bra backwards, with the cups behind you, and see if the band still hurts. If it feels fine/loose like that, you need a larger cup and a smaller band size. If it still hurts, you need a larger band.  If you don't care much for bras, just looking for coverage, and you don't need a lot of support, padded bralettes and bandeaus are probably a really good option.   If you are concerned with fit, find a tape measure and take these measurements, as demonstrated in this picture (while completely topless mind you) and post the measurements and results here for help."

A 32A is for someone whose underbust measures 32"" and their bust measurement is 33"", very roughly.  If you're of Asian descent then there's a good chance that you're in too BIG (edited!) a band and, even in the 34A which is the same volume as a 32B, too small a cup.  Here are some smaller bands and larger cups, pretty much correctly fitted, all the same volume as your 34A:  28D http://www.brabandproject.com/gallery/search?band=28&cup=D&age=&brand=&sister_sizes=0&search=Search  30C http://www.brabandproject.com/gallery/search?band=30&cup=C&age=&brand=&sister_sizes=0&search=Search  The only 34A listed on the site (which I wanted to post to compare) is in an incorrect size, she has underbust 31"" and bust 33"", so should be in a 32B give or take!!"
ABraThatFits,39ad22,dezeiram,7,Wed Jun 10 13:30:25 2015 UTC,"If you're of Asian descent then there's a good chance that you're in too small a band   Did you mean too big a band?   As a side note, being of Asian descent and having read this kind of thing before, I'm not sure it's accurate. I've noticed anecdotally that straight and inverted triangle body types are more common among (East, at least) Asians, which means a proportionally larger rib cage than in an hourglass-type figure. I've had clothes shopping experiences where because I looked...compact, I guess?, with my nonexistent hips/butt, my size was guessed to be smaller than it is. shrug"
ABraThatFits,39ad22,joanna70,3,Wed Jun 10 14:31:11 2015 UTC,"I did mean too big a band!  Thanks :-s  I will say that I have a very straight ribcage and it means that my band is more likely to ride up and my underwires down, so I take the smaller of the two possible band sizes for me (32-29.5 UB) so even that is no indicator.  But at a dress size US10 and 5'9, if I'm smaller than a 32 you can bet that a vast proportion of Asian women are too, though I was careful to word it as probable rather than certain :)"

Abi, Eva and Etta just to name a few all have three part bands where there is no actual band along the bottom of the cups and the middle part of the band (the gore) is slightly higher at the bottom edge than the side panels.  This allows extra room if you have a bit of extra weight high up on your belly. I have been on Prednisolone for the last 10 years and this has resulted in some weight gain on my tummy and the last time I got fitted the lady fitting me said to look out for bandless style bras as they would fit better."

I don't like the shape that bra gives me but it's one of the least painful I have.  I think I'm fairly narrow-set but with a big gap between the two (and they like to go out to the side and hide under my arms!) I think I have pretty even fullness, though perhaps slightly more full on top than bottom, and they're not shallow!  My biggest problem is that I'm way too fat and I need to deal with that (trying!) so I kind of feel a bit daft asking for bra advice because is it really a bra problem? I'm sure they're not made with people like me in mind... but it's getting so difficult to do anything when I'm always worried about having to wear uncomfortable bras that I guess it's better to ask than not!"
ABraThatFits,39ar4q,HootyMyBoobs,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:49:41 2015 UTC,"Just to help you with terms (t_maia has given you great fitting advice) narrow is about the root, the area of attachment of each breast, and close set or wide set is about the space in between, you might be narrow but with the tissue migration t_maia spoke about you need wide wires anyway, you may need a wider gore if you are wide set, but you may find narrower gores are okay.  Close set boobs struggle with wide gores.  Bra are made with everyone in mind but we all vary so much that we have to really hunt and research to get a good fit, it took me over 100 bras as I was sent in the wrong direction to begin with (someone commented that I was narrow and projected and no-one disagreed sadly, I'm actually shallow, the very opposite!)."
ABraThatFits,39ar4q,t_maia,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:23:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I had mixed up the root and the set... I think I'm narrow-rooted but not by much, and I'm definitely very wide set but I don't like it - I prefer a very low or narrow gore to give my boobs some chance to sit near each other! The only thing I miss about my 38DD bras is the cleavage, haha! Worth swapping for comfort and no more quad-boob though :)  I think it's very hard to tell - I think I'm projected but I'm not 100% sure. I'm nowhere near the 100 tries mark so I suppose I'll get out and keep trying :D"
ABraThatFits,39ar4q,t_maia,3,Thu Jun 11 08:39:09 2015 UTC,"I have this problem too. I have a belly bulge right under my underbust, waist, then a lot of weight on my abdomen. I carry all of my weight in my torso. I have very light bruising on the belly bulge from when I sit (doesn't really hurt so no real big deal). My side fat is exactly that. Side fat. I get it in a 34-38 band. I just sorta ignore it.    I second the bandless suggestion. It removes another layer of fabric that can roll because of the belly. I'm lucky in that my bras tend to roll up in the front rather than under. Under is painful. Elomi is a good brand to try, with comfy and wide wires to scoop the side fat in so it's not so bad.  A new measurement check is always a good idea if it's been a while since you last measured.   I'm 6'3, 230 lbs or so and a 36GG."
ABraThatFits,39ar4q,t_maia,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:39:54 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'd never heard of the bandless ones before but that sounds like a really great idea - I get that bruising too but I find it does hurt quite a bit - both on the belly bulge and up into the arms as well. My measurement check was recent but the calculator gives a different size to the one I worked out through trying different bras on - perhaps I should trust it a bit more and give that a go!
ABraThatFits,39ar4q,t_maia,2,Wed Jun 10 23:44:10 2015 UTC,"so I have like a fatty bulge under my boobs above my belly   That is most likely escaped breasttissue, try to put it inside the cup and see what happens. Keep in mind that it can take up to two years until this tissue is fully migrated back into the cup.   I do have some fat around my underarms (it's not JUST breast tissue, I'm sure of it!)   That is one of the reasons why Elomi has such wide wires - they found that most women in your position like to put the chub into the cup.    so I find even well-fitting bras really uncomfortable   The sign of a well-fitting bra is not just ticking all the boxes (gore tacks, correct size, breasts lifted), but being able to forget you are wearing a bra.   So with the fit issues you describe I am really wondering whether you are in your best size. You are definitely not in the best bra for you out there, so lets figure out what is causing this - the size or the bra itself.  Could you please share your measurements?"

I really hope there is a way to fit a bra so that it will feel comfortable - I have been avoiding going out the house where possible for the past couple of years because I hate having to wear a bra and I'm too embarrassed to go out without one.  My measurements are- SU: 44 TU: 40 SB: 50 LB: 55 LyB: 53  and here's me in a 40F (brand: Fantasie) if it's any help: http://i.imgur.com/zrReEah.jpg < NSFW, obvs :) I hate this bra because of the shape - it over-emphasises how much they like to splay outwards, and it makes me look very droopy and it's so high-cut that you can see it under any kind of tank... but it is one of my more comfortable!  Sorry for the very lengthy reply... I appreciate any help you might be able to offer!"
ABraThatFits,39ar4q,joanna70,2,Wed Jun 10 23:42:06 2015 UTC,"There's no way it's going in the cup, it's like a whole separate bit - kind of hard to explain    No need to. I've seen it plenty of times on larger women, in all cases it was boob tissue that got cut off from the breasts by the wires of too small bras.   The ""definite gap"" is usually caused by the too small wires sitting on breasttissue.   My measurements are   Those measurements are close to mine and I wear around 42GG/H. I get 42FF/G/GG with yours.   and here's me in a 40F (brand: Fantasie) if it's any help   Yes it helps. I know that bra and I can tell it is significantly too small. The Fantasie Speciality is a fullcup bra, but on you it fits like a balconnette - >  too small.   You could try the Elomi Etta, is is a bandless bra specifically cut to help women who got problems with the wire digging into the stomach area. The basic shape is similar to the Fantasie Speciality, but it is less east-west.  Personally I am not a big fan of the bandless styles - while they do have less material that can dig in, the downside is that if the wires end up digging in (because you are sitting all day) there is no fabric to pad them. For this reason I tend to switch between bandless and banded styles.   I think Caitlyn would be a good staple to try for a banded version of an Elomi bra.   If you want less coverage, Elomi Betty/Jocelyn are worth a shot.   Another good brand in this size range is Panache Sculptresse, sadly they have not gotten their sizes down yet. My normal Panache size is currently 42H, I got the Panache Sculptresse Willow last year and (in addition to not being a good shape for me) it was way too large. I tried the Panache Paradise in 42H and found that it was too small - I would have needed this bra in 44H."

Some really helpful insights and tips there - I will definitely try a bigger size & look into the brands you have suggested there... I was wearing a 38DD for a very long time before moving up to a 40F a couple of years ago on remeasuring so I felt a bit reluctant to go even further as it seems a bit surreal! I tend to get baggy cups at the top if I go much higher but that's without experimenting with different shapes or band-sizes"
ABraThatFits,39ar4q,logarythmic,2,Thu Jun 11 00:16:58 2015 UTC,"I tend to get baggy cups at the top if I go much higher   This means you got a 1-5 or 1-6 shape, also known as ""ski-slope"", ""ski-jump"" or ""hedgehog nose"". Nothing wrong with that. You need bras that are closed on top to deal with this. Either that or bras where it is not immediately obvious that the upper part of the cup is empty."

ABraThatFits,39a3dg,otterhugs,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:36:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks! =) and yup, thats exactly why, its growing in sideways and she says its a huge tooth and is like wedged between my back tooth and my jaw bone."
ABraThatFits,39a3dg,otterhugs,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:42:57 2015 UTC,"Well the impacted tooth ended up being super quick and pretty painless, it came right out, the tooth my dentist thought would be quick and easy on the other hand..... That one took an hour and a half and they ended up leaving a little bit of the tooth in because they just couldn't get it out. And as a bonus I got to feel every bit of it for the entire hour and a half because the local anesthetic didn't work on that tooth for some reason despite getting multiple extra shots. It was so incredibly painful, I dont even know how I was able to force myself to sit through it like I did, I'm just thanking god that I'm extremely stubbon and have a stupidly high pain tolerance."
ABraThatFits,39a3dg,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Wed Jun 10 22:52:19 2015 UTC,"That sounds so awful! You are a serious badass for sitting through that, I've been knocked out every time I had teeth extracted. And I've had 18 teeth taken out. I can't imagine going through that for even one of my teeth.  At least now you can take pain meds. (Hopefully?) I'm pretty sure my pain tolerance is high because I never needed more than Advil for any of my surgeries, but if I had done what you just did I'm sure I'd be reaching for the Vicodin."
ABraThatFits,39a3dg,otterhugs,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:01:31 2015 UTC,"The dentist said 4 ibuprofen every 8 hours, and thats all I get.... But I do get to eat nothing but ice cream for the next two days so I feel like that sorta makes up for it."
ABraThatFits,39a3dg,anonphilia,2,Wed Jun 10 23:16:40 2015 UTC,"WTF no tramadol?   After my catastrophe getting my bottom impacted wisdoms out (woke up in the middle of the procedure as they were fracturing the tooth out), I held off on my uppers for about 2-3 years. This time I did twilight sedation...and also my surgical dentist was way cuter than my usual one. So...yep. I know not everyone can afford to do that, but been there and done that. I hope you can eat solid foods soon!"
ABraThatFits,39a3dg,otterhugs,2,Thu Jun 11 05:31:23 2015 UTC,"That must have been scary, at least I was prepared for it (sort-of, prepared to be awake + some pain, not prepared for how much pain there actually was), I would have freaked if I woke up from a nap with my tooth getting fractured. And yeah, I'm too cheap for that sort of thing, even with how horrible it was I dont regret saving the $300 dollars it would have cost to get knocked out for the procedure. I'd rather have gone through it with both teeth not reacting to the anesthetic than pay $300 lol. Luckily for me it was only one tooth."
ABraThatFits,39a3dg,drawingdwarf,2,Thu Jun 11 05:42:27 2015 UTC,"I've been putting off getting mine out for a few years too despite the fact that they've caused me multiple gum infections.  Take an ipod or something, listen to music you like or a podcast, maybe even listen to/watch a movie. I usually do that when I get fillings."
ABraThatFits,39a3dg,otterhugs,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:11:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I took my iPod, though it died before the whole thing was done, luckily it was working through the worst part though, for some reason the local anesthetic just would not work on my first tooth, even after multiple extra shots, I felt everything...."

ABraThatFits,39a3dg,blizzard07,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:25:06 2015 UTC,"Probably a stupid question but since I've never run into it before. I sent EM customer service an email about how my bra wasn't a good fit and including the PL that was much better and they're going to try to fix it and are sending me a new one!! yay. So here's the question. They didn't say anything about returning the other one, so am I supposed to return it or keep it or what? The email was very short and they said they would be sending a new one. That was all."
ABraThatFits,39a3dg,Sollini,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:12:41 2015 UTC,Wait to see if they include return materials in with the new one. If they really want it back they will let you know!
ABraThatFits,39a3dg,HootyMyBoobs,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:32:27 2015 UTC,I doubt they'll send return materials. They sent me the wrong size (an HH SM instead of a GG) and I had to pay shipping back.

ABraThatFits,39a3dg,wayward_sun,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:39:37 2015 UTC,"SO. I see a lot of people here having issues with straps not adjusting short enough. And I've always wondered why on earth I have the opposite problem. Straps so rarely go long enough for me. I have them forced as long as they'll possibly go--and this is on fully-adjustable straps. There are bras I can't comfortably wear, like my Floris and Melissa, before I wet-stretch the straps, and even then they're tight (I still can't wear Melissa without discomfort).  The reason this is on my mind is that my sister told me she has the exact same problem. And in terms of body type, we couldn't be more different--she's around a 32FF and barely 5'1"", and I'm 32E and a little short of 5'7"". No one's ever thought my boobs were particularly low-set.   I don't understand this! Why are my straps always digging in and hurting me when the rest of the bra fits great? Why is the same thing happening to my sister? ARE WE ALIENS"
ABraThatFits,39a3dg,crazymusicalgenius96,5,Thu Jun 11 15:16:56 2015 UTC,"I spent like a good twenty minutes figuring out how to phrase this, hopefully it makes sense:  You have tall roots, but you also have significantly more fullness above the nipple than below. So your half cups don't have to go up very far on your actual boob before they reach the apex of your boob. The bra stops before most of your boob even gets started. So then the straps have a longer way to travel because the cup is generally rather short and low-set in the front.   I have tall roots but I'm pretty much even-leaning-FoB, so the cup has to be taller and roomier on the bottom in order to reach the apex of my breast. Because the cup ends higher on my chest, the straps don't have to be quite as long in order to reach the band in the back. I keep my Freya straps adjusted about halfway and the straps on Masquerade Medina adjusted to like 3/4 of their potential length (those straps are shoooort).   You could be low-set, or just average-set but your tall roots dominate everything so bras cower in fear below them."
ABraThatFits,39a3dg,wayward_sun,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:05:01 2015 UTC,That makes sooooo much sense. You so smart.
ABraThatFits,39a3dg,goodoldfreda,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:29:00 2015 UTC,"Maybe your tall roots give the illusion of being high set but actually you aren't? I don't know, I usually have the opposite problem."
ABraThatFits,39a3dg,_veritas,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:23:56 2015 UTC,I'm the same way! I have to have the straps as long as they will go for nearly all of my bras. And some bras I can't even wear because the straps won't go long enough (Cleo Marcie). It can definitely be frustrating at times.

ABraThatFits,39a3dg,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:09:44 2015 UTC,"The offline retailer list doesn't have a fitting technique listed for Intimacy, so it probably varies by location. It also say that they carry up to a K in 30-40 bands, but that's probably a US K.   You should go and write a store review for us!"
ABraThatFits,39a3dg,HootyMyBoobs,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:59:40 2015 UTC,"Their fitting technique involves no measuring. They look at you in your bra you come in in, try to fit you into the most expensive bras there (they really do), and judge your size by how you look in what they brought in and adjust to your preference there.   The person I was fitted with was professional. I liked the shape of the bra I bought and it was only 4 dollars more there than on Amazon. You can only exchange once you've bought the bra if you don't like it."
ABraThatFits,39a3dg,aboywithgirls,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:44:43 2015 UTC,"It sounds like it might be worth a shot. I will gladly pay a little extra for a professional fitting.

I've waited for her when she has been fitted. She was very patient with me when I was trying on bras for over an hour last month. I'm looking forward to this.  I think it will be fun!
ABraThatFits,39a3dg,j_sunrise,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:45:28 2015 UTC,"So, I got fitted about 6-8 months ago into a Panache Andorra 32G in a shop (by people who know what they're doing). This week I plugged my measurements into the calculator and got 32F as a result. I have been losing weight recently and expected some bra size change but it's interesting that only the cup changed and not the band: 31.9|29.5|38.6|40.9|39.4"
ABraThatFits,39a3dg,Amphigorey,3,Thu Jun 11 23:45:40 2015 UTC,"Andorra runs a little small, so you might have been 32FF at that point in other bras."

Then you'll get recommendations, and you'll get advised to order off Amazon using Amazon Prime-eligible bras for free shipping and returns. Don't order too many at once!   A good way of doing it is to order one style at a time, in a couple of different sizes, and do refunds and exchanges as necessary until you get a good fit. Hopefully your Mom will work on this with you! Now many people will make a big order all at once, but you don't have to do that. I think it's easier to just concentrate on one style at a time, until you determine which one works best for you and in what size."

I'm a 34 but I feel like I should be a 30 if these people are. I know it's bad to compare but I'm getting sad that a majority of all these great used bras for sale are such small bands.

Suddenly many of my professional tops were not professional because they showed straps, sides, etc. I ended up just buying new ones, because the old ones were for a chest shape I no longer had.  If you've got money to burn, Pepperberry has some seriously gorgeous clothing designed for larger busts. http://www.bravissimo.com/pepperberry/products/tops/  I tried to buy a tank top a size up to fix some bra-showing problems, but it just doesn't look as flattering. As long as I'm in a casual setting, I have mostly stopped caring about parts of my bra showing. That's why they make pretty bras, right?"

ABraThatFits,397vbx,28FFthrowaway,3,Wed Jun 10 12:21:43 2015 UTC,I think Bravissimo's strappy tops (as they call them) are pretty fantastic if you can fit into their size range (30-38 D-H). I've had one for about two years and it's still going strong.

They're pretty much the same as the Bravissimo strapping tops. I think Panache might actually be making the Bravissimo ones too since it's the same model number.   There are a few vintage-inspired brands on Zulily sometimes that offer a little more bust room but I've never seen anything like Pepperberry.

ABraThatFits,397vbx,t_maia,15,Wed Jun 10 00:57:10 2015 UTC,"Not care that your bra shows?   Highly recommend this approach. Makes your life so much easier.   It helps if the colour of your bra matches the dress/shirt so that it is not immediately obvious.   If it really bothers you, sew up your armholes - insert strips of fabric into the armholes of your shirt/dress so that it  covers up your bra. Note that this affects ventilation. An alternative can be to wear a bandeau cover over the bra, but again, extra layer.  If the environment is very casual: bikini tops are meant to be seen. So a dress that would be totally unappropriate with a bra suddenly becomes cute when you wear a bikini top underneath.   That said I dress modestly for personal reasons and in hot weather I tend to wear tanktops or sleeve-less tops with semi-sheer blouses like this one. Some of my favourite tops are actually swimsuit cover-ups, paired with leggings or a long skirt and a tanktop they look just like regular blouses."
ABraThatFits,397vbx,t_maia,2,Tue Jun 9 22:33:05 2015 UTC,That is a super cute tunic! I'm just in the opposite boat where I like to rock some exposed skin. Seems like I'll have to strike a balance.
ABraThatFits,397vbx,crazymusicalgenius96,3,Tue Jun 9 22:52:25 2015 UTC,"Lol. My mother is the same. She loves blue, so I got her the Fantasie Kashmir swimsuit and the matching cover-up for her birthday. Turns out she loves the cover up so much she got herself the matching bikini top and went to work wearing white chinos, the bikini top and the cover-up. She is 62 but looks like 40. Some customers come in just to stare at her."
ABraThatFits,397vbx,soleoblues,7,Tue Jun 9 23:14:44 2015 UTC,"I'm in a different size range from you, but I do get some bra showing when I wear certain tops. For the most part, I wear little 3/4 sleeve cardigans with most of my shirts (for other reasons besides bras, it just conveniently hides bra straps as well). On occasions when I don't wear a cardigan, I wear tight-fitting t-shirts that also happen to cover up bras well or I wear a tank top and rock the fact that my bra straps show. A black tank with a brightly-colored bra actually looks kind of cool, like little accent straps for your shirt. And those shirts with enormous arm holes that everyone wears nowadays? I don't wear them but if I had one I'd use it as an opportunity to show off a brightly colored or lacy bra. People wear lacy, bright bralettes/bandeaus under those all the time, so I think it's totally cool to just use your bra for that purpose.  As you might be able to tell from my vernacular, I'm from Southern California, so I share your pain with the heat. But the cardigans are really not that thick, and since you don't need the sleeve length I do, you could totally rock a short-sleeve or elbow length one. I think a white or seafoam green cardigan would look really nice with the dress you posted. Or if you've got a bra in one of those colors, it should blend in pretty easily."
ABraThatFits,397vbx,adragonisnoslave,3,Tue Jun 9 22:20:22 2015 UTC,"thank you! I wear cardigans to work when I wear tanks/shells, but I'm reluctant to wear one with this dress, just for aesthetic reasons.   And yeah, I curse the boob gods whenever I see someone showing off a cute bralette under their shirt, I'd love to rock that look! There just seems to be a huge difference between a lacy, bright colored bralette and my industrial looking bras. Maybe I need to shop around for some more colorful/lacy ones!"

My first suggestion, if you can handle narrow wires, is a Comexim Plunge - their wing height is fantastically low.  My second suggestion is alter your tank tops by making the straps shorter - it is the simplest way to lift up the armhole. This usually has the added benefit of lifting the ridiculously low neckline that comes with ridiculously huge armholes (I'm looking at you, Old Navy)."
ABraThatFits,397vbx,hurrrrrmione,2,Wed Jun 10 01:13:36 2015 UTC,"I would take the dress to a seamstress and see what kind of magic she/he could do to the arm holes.  Personally, I don't like having my bra show."

I just look for bras with lower sides. I've seen people are recommending Comexim, and for me, the Cleo bras sit pretty low as well. I agree that if all else fails, a bra the colour of your dress may work, or a nude bra.     Otherwise, you might be able to alter the dress to have smaller arm holes. The easiest way to do this is to shorten the dress from the shoulders - it will bring the armholes up, but unfortunately it will also bring up the waistline and the neckline."
ABraThatFits,397vbx,asheneyed,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:34:34 2015 UTC,"For the most part, I just don't give a damn if it's day to day. If it tank tops, I'll probably wear two tank tops, and thus, all those straps, who gives a damn. That and the new bra's are just so damned pretty you know?   But if its for a special occasion, I make sure it doesn't show. To the point that I would buy a specific bra that wouldn't show, for a specific fancy dress. Odds are you are going to cross this issue again for a more formal occasion, so it might be worth it to invest in a bra that fits, that has a lower side and is comfortable, because clearly you'll get wear out of it. I have a strapless bra for this specific purpose that can also be strapped, and I used to have a dress that had a cut out back, and I bought a bra specific for that - silicone grippy sides, so I could be backless, but still have support for the ladies.   So for your attendance to the wedding, might be worth looking into a new bra, but for casual day to day, unless you're in a  climate or society that dictates otherwise, embrace your straps, forget everyone else and enjoy that boobs being encased perfectly and comfortably.

ABraThatFits,397vbx,anonphilia,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:10:47 2015 UTC,"Mostly, I dress around my bras. I'm not comfortable showing bra straps, and if it's a really hot day and I don't want to layer, then I'll choose a tee with a small cap sleeve that isn't see-through. It's not much hotter to wear than a tank top, if at all, and covers the bra straps. Sometimes if the armhole is a cut bit low you might, if I lift my arm and you're really looking, see a bit of my bra band but it will be a plain skin tone bra so barely noticeable. If anybody's staring at me that hard, I figure they're out of line, lol.  If I want to wear a tank or something sleeveless like that dress, I'd wear a thin cardi over top rather than let my bra show. If your bra is neutral and only shows under the arm if you're really looking for it, then you're probably okay. If you've got obvious bra strap showing or peeking out the back or side, I'd layer over it.  P.S.: Is it really the case that VS bras or similar don't show under dresses like that? I've never worn their bras, but looking at the cutout of the armholes on that dress, I suspect most any bra would show the straps."
ABraThatFits,397vbx,cakeycakeycake,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:10:50 2015 UTC,"The issue is that I want to wear tank tops without a bra showing, not stick with t-shirts or cardigans. I really love wearing smaller straps in the summer, and personally hate the idea of dressing around my bra. It sucks that this isn't something bra manufacturers/clothing companies seem to care about.  I had some VS bras that would not have shown in that dress. I would have had major quad-boob though, so clearly it wouldn't have been ideal!"
ABraThatFits,397vbx,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:14:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get that--but when you need a larger cup size, you have to have more coverage to get the fit. And when you make the larger cups, it's going to be a problem to scale down the wings of the bra and still maintain the fit. They might be able to make some bras with a lower wing, but not all that much lower and still fit properly. So I don't think the problem is that the manufacturers don't care. It's that the designers know the limits and you can't expect them to do the impossible.   I too would love to be able to wear those clothes with out a bra showing, but I've realized that sadly, it isn't feasible to combine the fit I need with the kind of style I'd love to have."

That put it in a lot of perspective for me.

ABraThatFits,399a32,PleaseSilverCrystal,4,Wed Jun 10 04:30:03 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest problem is that you're wearing the bras too low. The underwires need to be hiked up underneath your breasts as you swoop and scoop, and there should be no space between the underwire and the inframammary fold. Nor should you have skin-to-skin contact between your boob and your torso.  You're definitely busting out of those 32Ds, so I think you can rule out 32D as a potential cup volume. They're the same as your old bras, just with a tighter band. I think you'd get more obvious quadboob if the wires were in your IMF, but since the wires look a bit narrow on those I'm not sure you could get them any higher.   The 32DDs are definitely better than the 32Ds, but in the Just Peachy and the wireless Natori you look like you're on the verge of spilling out. You've also got a shape mismatch with the Natori Risque - you've got a good amount of center fullness and the edge was cutting into your tissue pretty significantly. I think that one is also a little too small but the shape issue is making it seem as small as the 32Ds.   The Freya Deco definitely looks the best - I think you should stick with the cup volume of 32E/30F. The gaping you got on one side is probably caused by slight asymmetry. It's totally normal and you could probably make it less noticeable in most bras by making the strap tighter on that side. However, the wires are pretty low in the front so I'm not sure if you would have had other fit issues had they been in your IMF.  I don't think you have a shallow shape, as the Deco tends to be at least average in projection in this size range and has relatively narrow wires. You may have tall roots, but I don't think you have particularly wide roots, so I'd say you're at least slightly projected. So those shallow bras are probably going to be too shallow for you! I'm not quite sure what to recommend instead, though. The FoB shape you're getting now is being influenced by the bras all sitting very low on your chest. The Deco tends to work well for even to FoT ladies, so I think Cleo Marcie in 32E would be a good next step to confirm that."

It hadn't even occured to me that my underwires were being worn too low.. shows how little attention I've been paying. Thank you for the suggestion! I'll try hiking them up a bit.   Good to know about the shape mismatch with the Natori Risque. Center fullness, slight projection, possibly tall roots. Thank you SO much for all of your thoughts and suggestions!

ABraThatFits,399a32,lcl0706,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:26:26 2015 UTC,"30F is the same cup size as 32E, not 32DD :), though you'll probably end up with bras in at least 2 if not three sizes so don't focus too narrowly.  I think the Just Peachy is too small, I'd suspect that the next size up would be too wide, so it's a little too shallow probably.  Deco is a fraction narrow I think, it would be interesting to compare the wire widths, you can just hold them up against each other.  Shallow is one end of a spectrum, if you are properly shallow then FOB is WAY less important, especially when starting out.  However I think you have some projection, so only moderately shallow, and so FOB may play some part.    Definitely try getting those wires up and see how the fits differ."

Yes Andorra and Envy have lace, but this lace is really smooth and flat and practically invisible under clothing.     Lightly lined   Lightly lined (ie padded in UK lingo) won't happen because the foam makes it harder to fold down the cup and expose the nipple. Not practical with a small child. In a moulded and padded bra it can actually ruin the cup, causing permanent creases.   The only moulded and padded nursing bra I know of is the Bravado Bliss, but it comes without underwire.

Panache lightly lined is a thin extra layer of semi-sheer material that makes the bra opaque, especially in the lower part of the cup.    lined enough to hide nipples and/or nursing pads.   Unless you wear very thin clingy shirts all the time this should not be an issue.   The nursing pads should take care of any nipple issues. Many wear cotton nursing pads as cheap alternative to more expensive silicone nipple covers. It also helps if you place the seams of the bra over your nipples.   Good nursing pads have thin edges, so they will be practically invisible unless you got very thin clingy work shirts that show absolutely everything.  Additionally the beauty of reuseable cotton nursing pads is that they can be customised. So if you got a black bra you can get black cotton nursing pads or similar if you are worried about a white pad showing through.   But (YMMV) if anybody notices the seams of my bra (or similar) and takes offence they probably have been staring at my tits for way too long."
ABraThatFits,398wzb,catflower8,4,Wed Jun 10 02:41:15 2015 UTC,"ShockAbsorber is really the best in your size range.    I prefer to buy one cup size down for more support   That was probably the problem with your Shockabsorber. The cups of ShockAbsorber bras are small to begin with and they are compression bras, so buying them one cupsize smaller is not a great idea. Most people actually buy them one cupsize larger, ie if they normally wear 30D they wear 32D in  shockaborber bras.   If you still have it, could you please try your shockabsorber bra with the cups in the back to test the length of the band without being influenced by the size of the cups?  If you don't want to try ShockAbsorber again, M&S Angel First Lingerie has a really good sports bra for smaller breasts. Note that it too runs tight in the band.   Berlei might be another option, but no clue how tight it runs."
ABraThatFits,398wzb,t_maia,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:05:39 2015 UTC,thx! I still have them. but the problem was the band size not the cup size. I wear 28DD or 30D and bought 32C. cup size was ok(a bit tight tho. I thought it would be ok to one cup size down since I went one size up on the band.) but the band felt way too tight than it should be. I'll try what u recommended. thank u so much! <3

I found the cup to be accurate when I was a 28F and the band to be tight (but the 30 fits fine-- it's just super tight for a 30.

It's the Moving Comfort Vero bra. It hooks in the back like a regular bra and has great light padding to avoid nip shows.  Best part is that it doesn't flatten, which I found a huge problem with a lot of other sports bras.    I tried the Panache Sports Bra, and it was far too projected for me (it gave me a weird shape), so if you're shallow-ish like me, Moving Comfort is a cheaper alternative!  Try to avoid the all-white one because it seemed a lot thinner than the turquoise one I have.    I have it in XS (supposedly for a 32C), and it fits my ribcage (26-27 inches).  It runs like a 28 band definitely.    Here it is on amazon, but it seems to be out of stock:  And here it is on ebay for $27, but you might be able to find a cheaper one"

Anyway, I must admit it really holds them at their place. I was jumpig, tumbling, making candlestick and they still were where they should be. But putting it off felt as a sip of freedom :).

ABraThatFits,398wzb,drawingdwarf,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:07:11 2015 UTC,"IMO Enell is horrible if you are larger busted with a small underbust.  They put me in an 00 or 0 size and neither would fasten around my boobs. The next size up did not keep my breast tissue still at all.   Moving Comfort cups are really small and the 30 band may be too big for you (depending on measurements).  If you are full all over or full on top you may like the Panache or Freya molded cup bras. If you are even the slightest bit shallow these will feel odd on your chest and if you bring your arms together to do any kind of cardio you may have gapping. Personally these do not work for my breasts.  I now use Anita sports bras and found them to be very supportive. As others have suggested you may want to try ShockAbsorber in a different size as well. If the 32C felt too tight around your ribcage it may have been that the cup area was too small and your breast tissue was smooshed into the band.  I measure 27.75 around my underbust right now and found the 30 band Moving Comfort  bras to be way too roomy and the cups way too small (breast tissue was coming out of the top of the bras).  Do you have a local boutique that carries any of these brands? running stores and dicks carry Moving Comfort and Shock Absorber. Running stores carry Enell but Dicks does not carry them in the stores. Bra shops sometimes sell the Panache and Freya as well as Anita.   In short: I think it's trial and error based on y our size and shape and type of sport/impact. For me the Anita works a charm, and actually keeps my breast tissue still. The Panache and Freya still had loads of jiggle even with the j-hook fastened. But if you are just doing spin or low impact cardio you will not notice this as much as if you are doing HIIT or running or loads of jumping jacks."

Have you read the shape guide?  Cleavage can be tricky for some shapes of boobs, for instance soft tissue can end up escaping plunges in the middle, and many plunges are too tall for some breast shapes.  Softer ""cakes on a plate"" uplifted cleavage can be easier to achieve in a well fitting bra.  Side support may or may not need those specific panels, for most people the right wire width and cup shape does the trick."

ABraThatFits,399lp4,joanna70,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:13:14 2015 UTC,"In which case just focus on basic parameters of a correct fit for now, most people find their best fitting bras give them nice soft lifted cleavage :).  Can you order a job lot of bras online?  Pick a couple of ""diagnostic"" styles, or more, and order in 40 bands for tight bands (eg Panache) and 38 for looser bands (eg Freya), 38H/HH or 40GG/H?  40 bands usually means going to the brands like Elomi and Goddess, ironically the tighter Panaches stop at 38.

ABraThatFits,3997yy,noys,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:12:47 2015 UTC,"Since I've been wearing a 30 band until now (which has been more like a bra cover rather than actually providing support) and my breasts are relatively small and self-supporting, I'm not sure whether the bras were sitting in the IMF. I've tried them on again, making sure they are in the IMF this time.  The Juna now seems to bulge on top when everything is scooped in (but it doesn't stay that way for long, since it bulges on on the side instead), but the cups are now fully filled out, with no gapping. So it seems like it is too small, but I'm not sure whether I should go up a cup size or it's the shape that's the problem (i.e., width of cup or height of wing). The poiny-ish shape of the bra seems to fit my boob shape pretty well and doesn't flatten it.   With the Rhea, there is gapping toward the center at the top on each side (probably because my breasts aren't super-close together and sort of point outward). Unfortunately, I think maybe the Rhea is just the wrong shape for me--I think maybe I am too projected for it. But it also seems too big AND too small at the same time--I'm not filling out the cup and it seems to have too much space toward the middle, but I'm still gapping on the sides. Anyone have a guess about why that is? Should I try a wider gore, or a bra cup that tapers in toward the middle more? (And on the latter, how would I tell from the measurements whether it does?)  Any suggestions about where to go next, since I think neither of these fit?"

The Decos have very stretchy bands so trying a 38 band in a non-Deco bra is probably a good idea, but if it's too loose, then go down to 36HH/J.  Panache Jasmine is a good bra to try, though honestly it might poke your armpits. Try both 38H and 38HH if you can, just to make sure."

Sounds like you have a fairly wide root, if you are medium to wide and FOB then Cleo Lucy is a good starting point, I would try it in both 30FF/G unless you really think you need a looser band (Cleos are mostly snug) in which case 32F/FF.

ABraThatFits,399bpp,joanna70,1 point,Wed Jun 10 10:15:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! Leaning forward at 90 degrees my nipples seem to point directly to the floor, I thought maybe they had the slightest point towards my head but it's hardly noticeable if there at all. Much more of a directly to the floor. What would that indicate? Also yes, to be more specific about the wide root I would say that in the center there's a 1 finger space between them and then moving further down it becomes a 3 finger space, so more of a splay? What would your recommend for splayed breasts? My nipples still point forward if that makes a difference. This is harder to describe than I thought!  When choosing a band size, how do I determine if it is too snug?  And yes I swoop and scoop and adjust throughout the day. With the Marie Jo bra I swoop and scoop but then I have to separate them at the top to get them to stay in, not sure if that's normal but the lady at the lingerie store told me I should with this bra. It makes the gore lie flat but it takes adjustment throughout the day.  Thank you so much again!  Edit- just looked at the narrow vs broad root articles and I'm not sure anymore what kind of root I have, maybe they are just splayed? From the side view the line where the breasts seem to stop is about in the line with the start of my shoulder."
ABraThatFits,399bpp,joanna70,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:39:52 2015 UTC,"Splayed is about where your nipples point when standing up ie outwards, and often indicates breasts that are fuller on the middle.  Width of root is about how wide the area of attachement is, most people would have that triangle in the middle, it doesn't make you splayed.  One fingers space is fairly close set, I'd bet the marie jo gore is a fraction wide so you have to tuck your boobs in a little, not ideal but okay.  Band tightness - tight enough to stay put through the day but not too tight to distort the cups.  Ordering online gives you the chance to do jumping jacks etc but waving your arms round vigorously etc can give you an idea.  There is a lot of info on band tightness for different brands and models on here and on bratabase if you're ordering online, you should generally be able to plump for just one, then order two or more cup sizes on that band to try.  And you're even rather than FOB by the sound of it.  Not sure what you mean about the side view, tall roots tend to extend ski slope style up towards collarbones (though height and how high set your breasts are has some influence) and short roots tend to look ""d"" from the side.  Focus on getting the right wire width (you could measure your current bras for bratabase, it needs user input, then you can compare) and the right cup shape and that's most of it done (which would also pretty much apply even if you were splayed)."

ABraThatFits,399bpp,hurrrrrmione,2,Wed Jun 10 05:11:42 2015 UTC,Hi! Sure here they are:  Marie Jo- EU 70E/UK 32E FrÃ¤ulein Annie- EU70F/US 32E/UK 32E Undressed- EU 70E/US/UK 32E (on the website though the conversion from 70e is listed as 32DD for UK)  And thanks I'll look into that!
ABraThatFits,399bpp,hurrrrrmione,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:22:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah I did check both Marie Jo's and Marlies Dekkers' websites and it looked like maybe Marie Jo labels their DD cups as E and that Marlies Dekkers definitely labels their DD cups as E. This is common for European brands. So those bras might actually be 32DD, which is the same volume as your 34D bras.   But if we trust the UK size on the tags, you've actually not gone up a size, because a UK 32E is a US 32DDD.   Did Iris alter the straps before you tried on the Marie Jo bra or did they alter it for you?  Since your snug and tight underbust measurements are so close, you might find that a 30 band is too tight on you. Definitely try on some 30FF bras like /u/joanna70, but try some 32F bras as well."

But Cleo Lily is probably worth a try since it sounds like you have even fullness - how you fit in Lily will also make it clear if you don't have even fullness. Since your breasts are close-set, plunge bras with low gores are worth a try as well, although depending on how low the gore is and how much center fullness you have they might not work for you."

ABraThatFits,39a0n1,joanna70,1 point,Wed Jun 10 10:19:42 2015 UTC,"^ this. Sometimes the calculator can spit out slightly too tight bands.  OP - My guess is that if you are spilling out of a 36C sometimes, and it comes out with 30G/GG then it's pretty close, as a 36C and a 30G are for a 39"" bust,  and a 36D and a 30GG are also for a 39"" bust. A 36C holds the same volume of boob as a 30F, so in terms of cup difference, a 30G will give you roughly an inch more coverage on each side (equalling the 2 extra inches of bust difference) and a 30GG will roughly give you 1.5 inches on each side - so it's not a dramatic change in cup size, but you will notice the support that comes from a tighter band :)"

Especially with your snug and tight UB measurements only being an inch apart, it suggests you don't have much squish, and you may find 32's more comfortable.  Scratch this advice when it comes to Freya though, their bands are usually quite long and stretchy so stick to 30's.  With pendulous breasts, usually you have quite a bit of projection.  If you want to buy something rightthissecond, I'd tell you to hop on Amazon and get a Panache Envy, Jasmine, or Floris.  Try a 32FF and  a 30G.  You can return what doesn't fit."

Your snug and tight measurements are only an inch apart, so try on 30G/GG and your sister sizes 32FF/G to see what works best and is the most comfortable for you. Nobody ever fits into just one bra size, so given that each and every bra style and brand will fit differently, it's likely you will end up wearing a few sizes. At certain times of the month, my boobs go up roughly a cup and band size so it's good to have extenders and a variety of sizes.  Well I was wearing 32 bands from the age of 10 to 22. I was probably a 26C at 10 and when I got fitted into a 32B at 15 I was probably a 28E. At 22 I put on weight and thought they were tight - was about to go from 32B to 34B but then found this subreddit and went down to 28s and 30s. It wasn't my ribcage making the bands feel tight - it was my boobs sitting inside the band making me seem bigger! Whoops.  I bet M&S would put me at a 36 right now, so it's not weird at all, it's just that most shops (not even joking) are going through this self-fulfilling prophecy of  Shops buying the ""core sizes"" and fitting people into them. If someone asks for a size outside the core sizes the shop will say they don't stock them as nobody buys those sizes (because they weren't there in the first place to buy or to try on!)  Basically, you're out of the matrix now! It's going to become easier and easier once more people are aware of how to fit themselves.  Where are you based?  I like to try bras on in Bravissimo. I buy 1 or 2 bras monthly/every 2 months from there, and then, because I'm roughly aware of my size, I then buy others online at ebay.co.uk if I want to try new brands and sizes cheaply, brastop.com, figleaves, amazon etc.  Right now I'm in love with Ewa Michalak and Comexim.  I'm also fuller on top & I go for bras that are ""open"" at the neckline, so the ones that don't curve inwards too much (otherwise they dig in regardless of what size) - half cups!. If your boobs are wide you will want to check out Freya Patsy. Curvy Kate also has some great bras for full on top boobs. I'd say Freya Deco is quite open for a plunge and you can find them everywhere, though they are somewhat narrow in the cups. If your boobs aren't narrow then Curvy Kate plunges are good. If you are narrow and full on top (I think this is my shape) then I would recommend Comexim. If you are narrow, projected and full on top, I'd recommend Ewa Michalak CHP style.  Check out this guide to breast shapes - it's got little graphics that are very helpful! - possibly NSFW! Cartoon boobs.  Many would recommend Panache (main collection) and Panache Cleo (younger-ish style collection) as great for finding out your shape using a bra. Cleo Marcie is good for fuller on top boobs so I would recommend you try that, which you can get from Bravissimo, Figleaves, ebay, amazon.co.uk.  If you're in the US, I'm not 100% sure where the best place is, as I'm from the UK - but I've heard people mention Nordstrom, Bare Necessities, Amazon.com."

I remember my bras fit so much better when I was smaller, and it might be because my bra size was closer to my true (band) size back in the day.  I am in London. Bravissimo sounds so good, but I glanced over their website. It is rather expensive for me at the moment. I'd feel weird walking into a store and trying stuff on and then feel pressured to buy something so I think I will stick to Amazon and the other places at least for the moment.   I already put a couple of bras in my Amazon cart! I can't wait! This is super exciting :)  Thank you so much!"

ABraThatFits,3987ao,JoosMoose,4,Tue Jun 9 23:24:00 2015 UTC,"When you put the bras on, are you specifically placing the underwire in your IMF? It may take a bit of practice, but when you're swooping and scooping you have to position it right there.  If it's starting off in your IMF and sliding down, there could be several potential causes. The bra could be too shallow for you at the underwire, the underwires could be too narrow, the band could be too big. Your ribcage could even contribute to the bra sliding down."
ABraThatFits,3987ao,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:11:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you for that advice, it helped!  I'm new to the swooping and scooping deal, and I guess I was positioning the underwire wrong in the process.  In the past with my other bras, I just pulled them on and the underwire was always where it needed to be from the start, so it didn't occur to me that it could be an operator error.  Oops!  I tried it with each of the different bra styles and then checked back after a few hours and at the end of the day, and they all stayed put once I made a conscious effort to stick them there.  Thanks again! :)"
ABraThatFits,3987ao,Saskia_C,3,Fri Jun 12 21:03:16 2015 UTC,"All of the Aerie 30 band bras are really shallow. If the wire is sitting way below your IMF, you might want to try a more projected 30D bra. The unlined Cleos and some of the Freyas are a good place to start, depending on your shape."
ABraThatFits,3987ao,joanna70,2,Wed Jun 10 00:10:23 2015 UTC,"Do you think the wires may be a little too wide?  Not definitive but if they are it makes Saskia_C's suggestion more likely.  The alternative, if the volume seems right, if is the wires are too narrow and your wider boobs forces them down.  Definitely try keeping them up, but if they still ride down then one of these is the likely culprit."
ABraThatFits,3990kc,ABraThatFitsThrowawa,3,Wed Jun 10 03:09:31 2015 UTC,"and C doesn't feel right either, but it's the best from what I tried   I found that many end up stuck in cups that would be kinda right in a larger bandsize.   What you need are the cups of a 44C on a 38 band. 44C -> 42D -> 40DD -> UK 38E (=US 38DDD). And because bras and breasts are funny, you might also want to try 38F and even 38FF (one and two cups up from 38E.)   Is that possible?    Yes, totally.  You probably have a shallow shape. Read the shape guide please."
ABraThatFits,3990kc,t_maia,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:42:26 2015 UTC,"A good number of bras out there, in regular stores, are moulded.  These hide fit issues and many are designed to be tall, forcing the tissue that doesn't technicall fit upwards and masking that actually the cup is too small.  Have you tried thoroughly swooping and scooping all your breast tissue into the cups?  And yes shape is a BIG thing.  I take a 30-32G in a shallow half cup, put me into a more projected cup with narrower wire and it will look half empty (especially as my wide boobs won't be able to get past the narrow wire).  Boobs come in a wide variety of shapes, unlike most regular bras, so I can assure you you are almost certainly not ""oddly shaped"" :)  This migh help, though I'd not say all of these are PERFECT fits:  http://www.brabandproject.com/gallery/search/band/38"

The biggest EDS+bra issue I've encountered so far is too loose bands allowing the bra to move around too much and causing some skin damage. The only time I've had back aches from a bra was when I was in a hurry and didn't adjust the straps of a new bra very well...the over-tightened straps made my upper back hurt but not my shoulders or anything else for some reason. The back pain went away when I loosened the straps.   Do you have your current measurements and an idea of your breast shape? That information might be helpful for recommendations."
ABraThatFits,3976d7,LadyBoobsalot,3,Tue Jun 9 19:57:29 2015 UTC,"Hello fellow zebra! I am SO lucky to be able to say I haven't had the skin tears and chaffing issues that I've seen so many others report in the EDS subreddit so that actually hasn't been an issue I've had. For me, it's this dull but CONstant ache that grows stronger over time and the only thing I can figure is some way that my ribs are connecting. The xrays actually show that my ribs extend further away from my spine than would be expected (in a side view) but less than one would see in multiple sclerosis, for example. All I know is that taking the bra off as soon as symptoms get annoying, all symptoms go away and PT has helped so... maybe it's EDS related?  I've posted my measurements and shape elsewhere. Someone else suggested that pendulous is the shape which sounds accurate from the image searching I've done."
ABraThatFits,3976d7,LadyBoobsalot,4,Tue Jun 9 20:31:03 2015 UTC,I don't seem to have much rib involvement at all but my spine is pretty messed up. It's interesting how different we all are!  I'm a bit pendulous too. I've wondered if that's somehow related to EDS making everything stretchier or if it's more to do with my size. My pendulousness/projection makes me need cups that have a lot of depth right at the underwire.
ABraThatFits,3976d7,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Tue Jun 9 20:39:27 2015 UTC,Sorry to hear your spine is messed up. :( I kind of wonder how many of these issues are all EDS related as well. I'd post a poll on the EDS sub but it might be a little weird. hehe
ABraThatFits,3976d7,crazymusicalgenius96,5,Tue Jun 9 21:02:08 2015 UTC,"Could you post your five measurements here, just to double-check? Nordstrom fitters are pretty good but not infallible, and we like to have a human check the calculator's work.   But based on the calculator's initial results, your Nordstrom bras are 1-2 cup volumes too small for you. That's probably not helping your back too much! And Natori bras tend to be shallow, so the shape could also be causing problems.  I'm not sure which band size would help your back most at this point. I'm afraid that a 34 band wouldn't give you enough support and your back would have to work extra hard to compensate. And I would imagine that a 30 band from most brands is going to be too tight.  When I used to wear my old size of 32A, I always wore my bras too low and it was in a very uncomfortable spot on my ribcage (my boobs wouldn't let the wires go any higher). Now that I wear a size where the wires can encapsulate everything, the underwires are sitting right in my inframammary fold and the band is about an inch higher, which is a much less irritating spot for me. I don't have Ehlers-Danlos, of course, but I wonder if the same solution could help with the pain for you as well. Of course, it depends on whether you already swoop and scoop and place your wires deliberately in your IMF when you put a bra on. It sounds like you do, as you don't have underboob sweat all the time, right? But there shouldn't be space between the bottom of your boob and the underwire, either.   We can help you find bras you like for cheaper than $70-90. Amazon is having a huge lingerie sale right now, and they do free shipping and returns, so even if you don't like something you'll be able to send it back and get a complete refund. No money lost!  And for times when you don't want to go completely braless, or if you try a bunch of stuff and it still gives you pain, you might want to look into bralettes. Aerie makes really cute ones! They're very light and breathable, and still give you a little bit of support without the structure of a full-on bra. No wires, a nice stretchy band, soft everything. I think you'd probably do okay in a large, but if it feels too tight then XL would work too."
ABraThatFits,3976d7,Goddess_Keira,3,Tue Jun 9 19:49:33 2015 UTC,"I just commented on the other comment about the 5 measurements and added it to the OP as well. I also commented about the shape in the other comment if that information is useful? I believe my shape is shallow which is maybe why the Natori bras all fit the best? Not sure, I'm still trying to figure out all of the terminology on this sub and still not finding any examples that look like me in the graphics and photos so it's hard for me to describe, as I noted in the other comment.  The Natori underwires sit right where you describe - in the fold where the breast tissue starts. These were also fitted with a Nordstroms staff member checking the final fit and they were extremely comfortable. Unfortunately, I cannot try on a bra for 4-5 hours before buying to see if it's going to pinch so altering the band or cup size seems like it's going to be a crap shoot regardless.  I'm not sure what ""swoop and scoop"" is but I tend to bend over and place the bra deliberately, then stand up, hook in the back, make sure the straps are placed properly, then reach into the cup and pull up to adjust as needed.  I just looked up the bralettes you suggested and those are adorable! Do you think they would work properly for my size for the meantime? I kind of worry it would end up being about as pointless as most bikini tops are for me but if nothing else, it would help keep things from flopping around, so to speak, until my back gets stronger. I have concerns about how ""floppy"" everything is going without a bra in public, and especially the sweat that forms when not wearing SOMEthing to help prevent skin-laying-on-skin that causes the underboob sweat. Wearing a bra is the only thing that's ever prevented that for me and walking around with two sweat blobs on my shirt under my breasts is embarrassing at best. :/"
ABraThatFits,3976d7,crazymusicalgenius96,3,Tue Jun 9 20:07:39 2015 UTC,"All of your swooping and scooping and bra placement sounds good, that's pretty much how it's done. I actually commented on your other comment about shape; you are pendulous, which can look shallow while you're standing up, but when you lean over the breast tissue hangs away from your body. With shallow boobs the breast tissue never goes too far because the root that's attaching the breast to the body is spread out.  If you get bras from Amazon, you can try them on as long as necessary to make your decision. You just have to keep the tags on and be really careful with the packaging (don't rip it up too much). That's the beauty of online ordering. One time I ordered a bra and it took me like 3 days to decide to keep it. I'm almost positive I still would have been able to send it back had I decided against keeping it.  And I think the Aerie bralettes would work nicely for you! I would definitely try both large and extra large just to make sure you're comfy, though. Most ladies who wear large bralettes from Aerie wear 32E, so I wouldn't want the bralettes to be tight like your bras are!"
ABraThatFits,3976d7,t_maia,2,Tue Jun 9 20:18:37 2015 UTC,"This sounds like an interesting plan. Do you have suggestions for some less expensive bras to try out from Amazon that might be a bit roomier in the band but okay for my size and shape and/or bralette brands that are ideal (other than the Aerie, of course)?"
ABraThatFits,3976d7,GeeEmPee,3,Tue Jun 9 21:00:49 2015 UTC,"It would be helpful if you posted your five measurements, per the Beginner's Guide in the sidebar. Also, if you could read the Shape Guide and give us some idea of your shape.  That said, I think definitely your medical condition is having an effect here. If you're okay and comfortable going braless when you can, there's no problem with that. It's probably best if you don't wear underwire bras for longer than the 4-5 hours you're comfortable with. You might want to try some bralettes as well, to see if that's comfortable for you.  I'd say that you want to make sure that you don't have a too-tight band, as that may cause pressure, but yet if it's too loose, and you wear a bra that moves around on you, that could be uncomfortable too. You will really need to find that ""sweet spot"". Also, if you've been sized at 32F/30FF, then it might be that the 32 DDD's have been too small in the cups."
ABraThatFits,3976d7,joanna70,2,Tue Jun 9 19:38:48 2015 UTC,"The 5 measurements are (in inches):   31.25 28 36.5 40.5 38.5   As for the shape... I've stared at that guide for a long time and I cannot figure what my shape is beyond ""full on top"" per the bending over and looking into a mirror from the side technique. Pretty much, other than not being as large, I have what are old-lady sagging breasts with nipples that point straight down. Without a bra they just lay flat, wide, and pointing straight down. In a bra they look quite round, however. I believe I fit into the shallow category? But of all the numerous pictures and guides I've seen on this sub's FAQs and sidebar, I've literally seen no examples that look like me so I'm not sure how to describe short of posting a nude photo which would be prohibited.  As for the cup size, I feel like the 32DDD cups are starting to get on the too-big side (I've been losing weight over the last year but Norsdstroms keeps measuring me at the same size so far, last time was about 4 or 5 months ago?) and the 32F was from taking my measurements today.  I feel like the 32 band size is what is causing the pressure - I feel it the most on my back (though also a little bit on my sides, too), a few inches above and below where the band sits. I have a sports bra from when I was about 30 pounds heavier and it doesn't cause me any problems but, of course, I have NO idea what size the band is because it's one of those S/M/L sized products and the elastic is encased in this super thick cotton anyway. But it provides pretty much no support and a horrible profile (and the racer back straps go VERY close to my neck which feels uncomfortable and is visible even under non-low-cut tops so that one isn't an option for me for under clothing) but gives me the impression that a much wider band would not cause the same problems. However, a much wider band in an actual bra seems like a risky task given cup size and everything else. :("
ABraThatFits,3976d7,reetnz,3,Tue Jun 9 19:52:22 2015 UTC,"You've got a pendulous shape, and pendulous breasts are usually projected. They just tend to be soft and lay flat against you when you stand up. When you were leaning over, they didn't stay flat against your body, right? Shallow breasts stay close to the body no matter what position the torso is in.   Since your bras are kind of stretched out from wear, you might want to measure how long the band actually stretches to. It might be closer to 33"" now. Some people find a bra that's a little too loose to be even more uncomfortable than a bra that's way too loose and gives no support, so perhaps that's what's happening here? Also, if you're up for it, try one of your bras on backwards and see if the band feels better like that than it does when the cups are in front. That's a good way to test if the problem is just the band, or if the cups are contributing to your pain."
ABraThatFits,3976d7,reetnz,2,Tue Jun 9 20:02:40 2015 UTC,"Did an image search, pendulous seems to be much more accurate than what I saw in the shape guide drawings. When I was leaning over, nothing stayed against my body.  I only have one bra that's stretched out now (for having it for a couple years and wearing it almost daily because it is the most comfortable). It's a Natori and the same size as my other Natori that feels FAR tighter. The tighter one is much more uncomfortable and causes symptoms about twice as fast as the stretched one.  I just laid them both out on the floor unstretched and measured - the older one is approximately 1 inch longer than the newer one that is tighter and less comfortable."

The shape guide is meant to be used in combination of a well-fitting bra. The graphic represents supported breasts, not unsupported. If you don't have a good bra, cup your breasts in your hands and play around - what feels right?   Your Ehlers-Danlos probably causes you to have very soft and flexible breast tissue, so this makes it more difficult. A trick can be to observe your breasts floating in the bathtub when you take a bath.      However, a much wider band in an actual bra seems like a risky task given cup size and everything else. :(   Have you considered long-line bras?   http://www.bratabase.com/browse/freya/piper-padded-longline-bra-1233/related/  http://www.bratabase.com/browse/cleo/minnie-longline-padded-balconnet-bra-7435/  A number of women can wear longline bras one bandsize up because the larger band is more stable and less likely to slide around."

I have been reading SO much text in preparation to make this post within rules that I missed the part about shape being related to in a well fitted bra. So I'm roughly 1-2 and 5 according to this picture.  EDIT: Forgot to add, no I haven't tried a longline bra. I didn't realize that was a thing. I've worn corsets and bodices without much issue. I might have to check into those. Thank you for the suggestion!"
ABraThatFits,397ji6,NornaNoo,3,Tue Jun 9 20:40:52 2015 UTC,"If it is strappy tops, shorten the straps. Some sleeve-less tops or tops with raglan sleeves can be altered by taking in the shoulder seam. For other tops try them on backwards.   Try on all tops with all your bras, often one bra shows under a certain shirt while another bra does not.   In some cases it can look cute if the lace of the bra shows, especially if the colour matches.   If there is no way to get a shirt to fit, throw it out."
ABraThatFits,397ji6,t_maia,3,Tue Jun 9 20:57:02 2015 UTC,"I totally second wearing tops backwards - boat neck scoop back dresses and tops are so cute. I have a bunch of dresses that are designed to be that way from the beginning! Just make sure you take the tag out if you like it that way.   I actually just did a closet clean-out and I only had one shirt and one dress that were too low cut for all of my bras. To be honest, the shirt was even too low for my old bras - it was a black v-neck I got from a show that was absurdly plungey. The tip of the v was way below my IMF! All of my bras are half cups, though, so that makes things easier."
ABraThatFits,397ji6,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Tue Jun 9 21:39:05 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about specific models, but I think you're looking for half-cups or demi-bras which have rather low and horizontal top line. The Bravissimo Satine is a plunge bra which works well with v-shaped tops. The last possibility would be to shorten the straps of your tops (where possible)"
ABraThatFits,397ji6,j_sunrise,2,Tue Jun 9 20:51:35 2015 UTC,"For shapes, you'd want to look at plunges. Since you say you're projected, the Panache Andorra Plunge may work for you, though I'm not sure about how the wires will work with your short roots. I will say that I have noticed that all of my well fitted bras cover more area. Which makes sense, as the bras I was wearing before were WAY too small."
ABraThatFits,397ji6,CrystalElyse,2,Tue Jun 9 20:54:35 2015 UTC,"Ooh, the Panache Andorra is actually one I tried on at Bravissimo and seemed to fit. I didn't buy it in the end as I'm finding the non-padded bras a bit uncomfortable. It's probably just because I'm not used to it by my breasts feel really sensitive in them, I can feel my t-shirt through the lace and it's really weird! Does anyone else get that? I might just have to try to get used to it."

ABraThatFits,397ji6,Crikey-Way,2,Thu Jun 11 15:52:23 2015 UTC,"You could sew a lining into it, but bras have a lot of.... interesting construction, so I'm not sure how difficult it would be. Nipple covers would definitely work! That's really the only issue I've had with the Andorra. Usually the lace stays fairly well hidden unless it's an extremely thin shirt (and even then those shirts I've yet to find any bras that work with), it's just nipples poking through occasionally. I've been too lazy to pick any up, I just sort of bring a light hoodie/shirt with me to cover."

As you said, you weren;t swooping and scooping correctly before. You can still wear it if you are comfortable in it! That's the thing about bras, if they are comfortable then it is fine. If you want to try a rixie clip to hold the band tighter and see what happens you could but it would be the equivalent of a 28D so you may still have some coverage issues."

Not a pretty bra, but very sturdy. Goddess Clara is a prettier version of it.   I have a friend who used to wear Curvy Kate exclusively (size 38JJ), she then decided to switch to the Goddess Alice simply because it gave her better support.   So Goddess Clara/Alice would be worth checking out, especially in combination with the Royce Impact Free. Goddess Alice underneath and Royce Impact Free on top and your friend can go for a round on the trampoline. :D  Some Elomi bras like Rita would be worth a shot, but all other bras I can think of either do not go as large as needed or are as ugly as sin."

ABraThatFits,398y3r,lightningsugar,2,Wed Jun 10 02:50:35 2015 UTC,Where exactly does the gap apears? Is it at the whole upper edge or near the place when the strap attaches only? Do you have this issue with crossed straps and strapless bras too?

ABraThatFits,398y3r,yellkaa,5,Wed Jun 10 21:08:39 2015 UTC,"This happens because you have a lot of projection and sharp breast tissue falloff there. The more projected shape you have the more common it is, omega shaped breasts have it pretty much all the time. It's very difficult to construct a bra that would follow this shape, flesh can do things fabric can't when that fabric is pulled taut and lifting a breast.   I have the strap gap as well to a small degree and I just suggest not to stress about it. It doesn't affect shape under clothing, lift, support or cup stability. You can minimize the appearance by wearing bras that lift you less or loosening straps but then you sacrifice lift or stability and support."

ABraThatFits,395stj,Kradchand,3,Tue Jun 9 13:37:54 2015 UTC,"The fern is a really odd bird. I tried it a few months ago and it was so wrong it was comical. I think it wants a really specific FOB, short root shape.   If you haven't tried any other unlined bras, I encourage you to do so! Once the shape is better you will likely have less nipple irritation. With your measurements a 28 band is totally reasonable, too. Unfortunately a lot of panache's offerings don't come in 28 bands. However, there's always Cleo!   Judging by your fit pics, it looks like you do have somewhat tall roots, and the tall part is relatively shallow. I'd be interested to see how Cleo Marcie in 28F (or maybe 28E) works on you. Your measurements are pointing to a 28DD/E but based on how you fill out the Fern in 30E I don't think you necessarily need to go down in volume. Do you have any bras in your new size that have worked so far?"
ABraThatFits,395stj,cupcakery,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:24:08 2015 UTC,"I only have the Fern in my size, I got it because it was cheap on ebay.

I was recommended Cleo Lucy in my last thread, how are Lucy and Marcie different from each other?   http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/389g81/recommendations_28e_fit_check/"
ABraThatFits,395stj,cupcakery,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:45:01 2015 UTC,"Lucy is meant for a more FOB shape and Marcie is meant for an FOT shape. However, in our size range Marcie still has a decent amount of projection at the wire and allows for a bit of bottom fullness. I recommended that one due to the tall-root hypothesis. You can see in the third picture you posted that the Fern is coming back in and cutting off your breast tissue at the top. Marcie is cut to be more open at that top edge and therefore allows for more upper fullness and/or taller roots.   Trying both Lucy and Marcie will help troubleshoot though. I thought I was FOT for the longest time because of my tall roots, though I'm technically even. So I do better in FOT bras than I do even bras because my root goes on forever."

ABraThatFits,395stj,lcl0706,3,Tue Jun 9 15:35:15 2015 UTC,"Hmm, most halfcups (that aren't Polish) are pretty wide and shallow so I'm afraid they wouldn't give you enough room in the bottom. If you want to try some your best bets are probably Cleo Juna or sister styles or Freya Lauren or sister styles <-- look at ""models with the same cut"" -- you want the padded halfcups."
ABraThatFits,395stj,lcl0706,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:59:57 2015 UTC,"+1 to Juna.  So far it's the only lined/padded/whatever bra that I've tried that has enough projection at the bottom (excluding the Polish adventure I'm currently on).  It's average wire width.  Polish is narrower, Freya half cups are wider IMO.  But I'm speaking for my size of 28G.  Cleo grades their shapes along with their sizes.  On the smaller end of the spectrum, Juna will most likely be shallower than it is in my size."
ABraThatFits,395stj,joanna70,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:52:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I'll probably stay away from Freya in that case as the wires on my Panache Fern are wide enough and I don't want any wider.

Fantasie or Panache might be an alternative, but they won't fit you as well in the cup.

Alice is not like Keira. Keira has a shape on top that is very similar to most of the Elomi bras while Alice is meant for a lot more volume on top, more like Curvy Kate.   Think Cleo Lucy vs Cleo Marcie and you got Keira vs Alice.   So chances are high she will need to size up in the cup to prevent the Elomi Isis bikini top from cutting in. At that point the cup will most likely become too deep. The closed top and the deep cup combined will give her rocket boob. (Been there with Freya Arabella and Fantasie Elodie, not a pretty sight!)  The only other solution I can think of that would work is the Freya Sweetheart cut, but that does not give her the coverage she wants."
ABraThatFits,395tkc,SuperRandomGirl,6,Tue Jun 9 13:43:43 2015 UTC,"I would start you in a 34FF and I would agree that you're rather projected. Based on what you said about nipple placement I wonder if you might be full on top... When you make a hand-bra for your boobs, what do they best represent on this chart?  Our go-to diagnostic bras around here are Cleo Marcie (if you think you might be more full on top) and Cleo Lucy (if you think you might be full on bottom). They're also good for helping figure out root width if that's not something you're sure of. If you haven't checked out the shape guide yet, it's a great place to start learning about your breast shape! As you get closer to a better size, shape becomes so much more important."
ABraThatFits,395tkc,cupcakery,2,Tue Jun 9 14:15:54 2015 UTC,Well... if i leave them droopy... they're pretty much a FB2/6 and an FB2/5 (different sizes). if i make a handbra... it depends on how i shape my hand... my breasts seem almost kinda liquidy... taking on different shapes pretty easily.
ABraThatFits,395tkc,cupcakery,3,Tue Jun 9 14:51:47 2015 UTC,"Ok, we typically refer to that as having soft breast tissue (just so you know if you ever see that terminology pop up!). Cleo Lucy or Panache Jasmine or Envy would be a good place to start I think. Jasmine and Envy have stretch lace on the top that allows for variation in upper fullness and is therefore quite nice!"

ABraThatFits,395pzf,ericazibby,4,Tue Jun 9 13:13:42 2015 UTC,The main problem I see with this is that so much of fit has to do with wire width. Wire width isn't something you can alter easily in an existing bra and I don't know if it's something that can be customized without having a seperate pattern for each wire width and volume if you were going to make each product to measure.
ABraThatFits,395pzf,lizzyborden42,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:00:46 2015 UTC,We wouldn't be altering the existing bra if it needed enough alterations to warrant making a new bra based on the one tried on.
ABraThatFits,395pzf,lizzyborden42,2,Tue Jun 9 14:03:21 2015 UTC,"well, I am pretty projected and narrow, and I know that trying on a bra that has a wide wire matches my shape so poorly that I would not be willing to pay money for the bra to be changed so that it fit because it would look and feel horrible trying it on.  It sounds like you might end up needing a large number of ""try on"" bras to accomodate various shapes if that's your goal. Although it would be possible to do wire shape and volume to accomodate various band sizes if you made where the straps hook into the back moveable and just clip the band or something. I'm not sure if that makes sense."
ABraThatFits,395pzf,lizzyborden42,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:09:12 2015 UTC,"I think we are suggesting the same thing. If the fit issue was a problem with wire placement, we wouldn't alter the tried on bra. We would sew a new one based on the measurements and fit of the try-on bra. Only small or zero alterations would warrant selling the try on bras."
ABraThatFits,395pzf,lizzyborden42,3,Tue Jun 9 14:16:41 2015 UTC,"True, but wrong wire size would make it really difficult to imagine how it would fit correctly for someone like me. Do you plan on having a couple wire sizes for each bra size in your ready made bras? If there was a way to have the cups fit pretty close to where they should be with the wire in the IMF and sitting correctly on the side of the breast and then having the option to make the height of the wire shorter on the sides or gore or longer if needed it would be easier to imagine the bra having a little more or less space on the top or bottom easier to imagine. Or for me having the wires set close together. That's one thing that always drives me mad when trying to find a bra that fits.  The wires at the gore are always too high and too far apart. I have put off ordering polish bras because it's not easy to try on and return without paying a lot in postage. For the record I have close set narrow projected breasts that have pretty much no room between them where the gore would sit. I wear a 34G or 32GG typically.  My ideal in a custom shop like your vision would be to have try on bras that could be adjusted on my body to the point where I can kind of feel the fit. Unfortunately makine try on bras like that would not be sellable as is. Spending more money for a service like that would make a ton of sense, instead of buying the closest fit I can find and then having it tailored or tailoring it myself as I do a lot of sewing, which is what I have done with several bras. The adjustments I can make myself without changing the underwire is an improvement, but I would deffinately need more from a specialty shop. And correct wire size can make a bra feel amazing and really make any extra price seem worth it."
ABraThatFits,395pzf,aboywithgirls,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:37:02 2015 UTC,"Excellent point. As I was reading through this post of yours it hit me that you probably have extremely close-set breasts which means gore is usually a problem in anything but a plunge.   So, a try-on bra for you would have to be a representation of your chosen style in a close enough size but more importantly, unfinished enough so we could maneuver the wire to the correct placement."
ABraThatFits,395pzf,aboywithgirls,2,Tue Jun 9 14:42:03 2015 UTC,"Even plunges have high gores in my size. It's rediculous. Seriously, there's no need for my plunge bra to have a gore that as high or higher than where my nipples are. If you haven't, check out ""plunge"" styles on bratabase with pics of people in the G+ size range. I also have to modify the gores in my plunge bras so that the wire are right next to eachother. Even then the natural boob gap I have is narrower than the two wires next to eachother because most of the wires on the bras I have are a bit too wide for me and have the wire so high in the middle that even though my boobs are close together near my IMF the wires are already trying to curve away.  I have seen some other posts on here about projected and close fitting boobs but mostly the replies have been to order polish brands, so it might be a demographic that would really benifit from your fitting and design vision. I just think it will be a challenge to make bras that can both be tried on and sold with minimum modification while still being able to get a close enough adjusted fit for someone like me to really understand what they are buying. And with all the modifications there's no way you're going to be able to make these bras inexpensive enough where a crummy fit in the dressing room and the promise that it will be perfect when done is a gamble a lot of people will not be as willing to take."
ABraThatFits,395pzf,nidena,3,Tue Jun 9 15:05:59 2015 UTC,"I am new to this forum so bear with me. I am a man who wears a bra out of necessity. At a recent fitting at a local boutique, I was fitted with a 36H. There are a growing number of men out there that are wearing bras for the same reason as women. This has a lot to do with hormones in our food, medications and genetic disposition. I happen to have all three. It would be great from my perspective to somehow make the bra market a little more friendly and less taboo for men. I'm not saying make a bra more masculine because I happen to like what's available to me now. I would just like to see a little less stigma and more acceptance for men who are looking for comfort and support."
ABraThatFits,3974ri,killertofuuuuu,12,Tue Jun 9 19:05:49 2015 UTC,"VS bras are fine if you fit in their size range. Altering a bra should be fine, there might even be a tutorial for what you want to do in the sidebar's alterations guide.   However, your last fit checks looked like you're closer to 32DD/E, a couple sizes up from 32B. Have you remeasured lately? 32 bands should (hopefully) be fairly common in department stores, or at least that's what I thought. I do all my shopping online, so stores may have changed since the last time I checked around lingerie depts."
ABraThatFits,3974ri,SmellsLikeDogBuns,2,Tue Jun 9 19:15:56 2015 UTC,they're not incredibly common above A and B cups  There was one bra in kohls after I went to 5 other stores with no luck.
ABraThatFits,3974ri,Sunset96,3,Tue Jun 9 22:31:38 2015 UTC,"I see that you have done a measurement check here before, though it was 6 months ago. You may want to measure again, especially since you said you were planning to lose weight.  However, if you like the way the VS bras feel, altering the straps will not ruin the bra! I'm almost positive we have a how-to for that in the alteration guide in the sidebar. You could also convert the straps into a racerback using a racerback converter clip, a safety pin, or a small piece of ribbon/string.   We don't hate VS here, their bras are reasonably good quality for the price and tend to fit people in the size range quite well! (Shallow breasts are pretty common in properly-fitted matrix sizes, and VS bras are pretty shallow.) We do not condone their fitting practices, though, as they tend to be inadequate and focused on getting you to buy a bra no matter if it fits or not. If you want to double check on the fit, I suggest going through the fit checklist in the fitting guide and making sure you don't have any other fit issues besides the straps. Straps falling down can be a sign of other fit issues (like a band that's too big).  I know it's hard to find 32 bands in most stores, but there really are a lot of manufacturers who make them! They just aren't as popular as Bali, Playtex, etc so most department stores don't carry them. Since you are in Canada, you will also have some luck at Change, which is similar to Victoria's Secret in style/shape but has a much larger size range."

Even in-store fittings can be way off, worth getting her to measure according to our Beginner's Guide in the side bar, straps falling off the shoulders, if that is her issue, is so often about too big a band size (and too small a cup, though that doesn't affect straps so much)."

Your other bra in 32D is too small in the cups, you've got some quadboob. So 28F is definitely the right cup volume for you, and the band should be better too. You might want 30E in some brands but Freya is pretty stretchy, so the 28F will probably suit you best."

But I really want and need a non-push up bra that is comfortable for everyday wear.     Also, boob twins! :D"
ABraThatFits,396uuv,crazymusicalgenius96,3,Tue Jun 9 19:20:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, not all F cups are the same. Instead, bra sizes are related to each other through sister sizes - as you go up a band size, you go down a cup size, and the resulting bra cups will have the same volume. Here's a handy chart of sister sizes: http://i.imgur.com/6KJjw.png  And not only are we size twins, we're shape twins too! I'm also tall-rooted, though I think I'm slightly more projected than you (the Patsy half cups are just a liiiittle too shallow for me)."

ABraThatFits,395st0,Venys123,4,Tue Jun 9 13:37:46 2015 UTC,"I order two 40G bras from overseas (marks and spencer)   There is a good reason why almost nobody in this sub orders from there. M&S bras run large or small cup, tight or loose in the band...  -  the bras are very unpredictable. If you are in the UK and can try on the bras in store it is ok, but for ordering online it is a desaster.  You have a very projected shape and deflated breasts and the bra is too shallow and too tall for you.    and a padded cup?   Give up on padded cups. Seriously. There are so few bras in your size range that - if you limit yourself to padded cups - your chances of finding a good bra are almost nil. Try everything you can get your hands on, no matter how it looks.  That said, with the shape you describe you could give the Curvy Kate Daily Boost a try. But note that it is a tricky fit and please don't be dissappointed if it is a dud.   http://www.brastop.com/curvy-kate-daily-boost-bra-white-2  In general Curvy Kate is a good brand if you got no volume at the bottom, they are cut exactly for this shape - especially the older ones like Princess.  http://www.brastop.com/curvy-kate-princess-bra-black-19  Another brand that I can recommend is PourMoi?, especially the Imogen and St. Tropez.  http://www.brastop.com/pour-moi-imogen-rose-emb-full-cup-bra-slatepink  http://www.figleaves.com/uk/product/PM-3804/Pour-Moi%3F-Imogen-Rose-Embroidery-Full-Cup-Bra/?size=&colour=Blues  http://www.figleaves.com/uk/product/PM-7702/Pour-Moi%3F-St-Tropez-Full-Cup-Bra/  PourMoi? is narrower than Curvy Kate.  Panache Jasmine is another option, sadly it is not available in a 40 band.

ABraThatFits,395st0,t_maia,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:17:05 2015 UTC,Thanks for the awesome response! I ordered from m&s because they had a nice range in my size but it definitely is the wrong cup shape. My issue with soft cup bras is I feel they are quite minimising but also the design makes my boobs pointy. Curvy Kate looks like it doesn't do this but I obviously can't be sure until I try it on.
ABraThatFits,395st0,t_maia,2,Tue Jun 9 20:59:55 2015 UTC,"I ordered from m&s because they had a nice range in my size   M&S uses its own sizing system - they do not have FF. They also have a large variety in suppliers, including suppliers from Asia that normally use EU sizing so their G-cups are wildly all over.    My issue with soft cup bras is I feel they are quite minimising but also the design makes my boobs pointy.    That is a shape issue. If the shape is wrong for your breasts, you get flattened or a pointy shape.    With soft cups there is a fine balance between the cut of the cup, the shape of your breasts and gravity. If you find a good match, your breasts will be very round and perky and lifted - but until you get there, it is trying dud after dud. Don't give up."

ABraThatFits,394qdz,liberatedladies,3,Tue Jun 9 06:27:23 2015 UTC,Title Typo-- I meant 32K :)
ABraThatFits,394qdz,buymeflowers,3,Tue Jun 9 06:34:49 2015 UTC,"There are no hard and fast rules as to band tightness with Ewa anymore, I have a few BMs in 70 and they're all comfortably TTS.  The fit of the halfcups isn't really relevant, since the CHP cut doesn't come in your size (and EM is unlikely to make it custom).  Can you try on the PL with an extender? You're losing some cup depth by stretching the 65. Insert an extender, scoop and swoop, and then push the gore flat (it likely won't tack with the extender), and see how much spillage you get.  The S is a lot taller and a lot more open on top than PL, a 32KK might be overkill. 36HH is your max cup size, based on your numbers (this is what the calculator gives as well when I input your numbers, not sure where 32K is coming from). Since you're petite, and need narrow wires, trying wide and tall brands is going to lead to cup size overestimation, as they don't have the volume where you need it (front and center).  Additionally, when you're narrow and petite, you want to buy the smallest cup size you can get away with to avoid scaling issues. The BM has stretch lace, which allows many women to get away with a slightly smaller cup size. It would be my first choice, to see if Ewa is a good match for you (her bras aren't incredibly friendly to short/narrow frames). I do think 75HH/J for BM is a good starting place, and will help narrow down your size in other EM cuts more easily than the PL you've already got."
ABraThatFits,394qdz,buymeflowers,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:29:43 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of focusing on the BMs and trying to keep my cup size as small as possible for the scaling issues you mentioned. I think I swapped the band measurements when entering them in the calculator?   32K/34JJ does make sense to me based on how the bras I tried on in a 34J (in the OP) fit, but it's honestly hard to say because the wires on those bras are so much wider/designed for a more shallow breast.  I'll update with a pic of the 65JJ PL in an extender, and based on how that fits probably order both a 70JJ and 75J to see which wires/band set up I prefer. My BTT (should have included) is 29, so I'm worried if I go up to the 75 I'll lose support. But it could be between that and not having wires gauge my armpits I'm thinking...  Would you say that Comexim is a better fit for petite frames overall? I'm certainly not attached to Ewa, but I've placed two custom orders from her and I was pleased with the service I got. She's also a bit cheaper than Comexim because of the zÅ/$ exchange rate.  Thanks for your help, it was really fun reading your reply."
ABraThatFits,394qdz,anonphilia,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:42:06 2015 UTC,"Your original post has 35 snug and 32 tight, is that not correct? Usually tight and BTT are the same for our purposes.  Comexim's are more expensive from wellfitting, but cheaper directly from Comexim's website, usually about 120-130 zloty. As far as being better for petite frames, it's kind of a toss up. In your size, Comexim's padded plunge is the narrowest and most projected bra you can get. However, the cups are also quite tall -- you'd likely need the cup height reduced (a common customization)."
ABraThatFits,394qdz,anonphilia,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:50:53 2015 UTC,"Haha well the way I did it (and it's been like almost three years since I used the abrathatfits method last so I think I was confused about which was which):  35: tape is pulled taut over my skin, no indentations   32: pulled the tape tighter, but not as tight as I could possibly get--just what I found comfortable  29: break the tape tight  As far as wire width, I'm not necessarily interested in more narrow than what Ewa offers--is there another Comexim style you can recommend that's a similar height to the Ewa PL? Obviously I'll check out bratabase, but a starting point would be very helpful!   Thanks again! I fit women using the UK standard and I know so much more about the common issues for a 34FF than I do for even my own size lol. I tried on another Freya 34JJ today at work (the style escapes me but its the same one they do over and over) and I got both quadboobing and the orange in a glass effect from the wide wires, so yeahhhh that wasn't helpful as far as figuring out if the volume was correct! I know I'm not the only woman to be maxxed out by cup and small back ratio because of a narrow root, but it is certainly starting to feel that way."
ABraThatFits,393jja,CrunchyMother,12,Tue Jun 9 00:22:49 2015 UTC,"The calculator is giving me a size for you of 36G with sister size of 38FF. As you say that your pectus carinatum makes it difficult for bras to stay in the IMF, I think you have to just do the best you can and get the most comfortable bra you can.  Honestly, unless you get super-lucky there's not much you can find for under $20 that will come even close to fitting you. You could try putting a request on /r/RandomActsofBras stating your situation. If you're good at hunting down bargains on Amazon or eBay, you might find something in that size range. I'd be looking at 38FF in UK sizing, to give yourself room to expand during pregnancy. Good brands to look for are Elomi (in your UK size), or its sister brand Goddess which you would look for in the comparable US size of 38H. I'm recommending a 38 band both to give you room for expansion and because you say that tighter bands are more likely to slide down on you. If the 38's are loose in the band now, you can do them up on the inner hooks until your ribcage expands more. I'd also suggest considering both wired and non-wired bras by those companies. In fact, I'd say there's a good chance that non-underwire bras will be more comfortable for you right now. Other brands to consider are Cacique/Lane Bryant, Elila, and Wacoal, all in 38H (US)."
ABraThatFits,393jja,Goddess_Keira,5,Tue Jun 9 01:54:07 2015 UTC,"Amazon is having its semi-annual lingerie sale. Search them for 36G, and see what comes up! I know that 15 that were on sale came up for my size, and 8 of them were under $20."
ABraThatFits,393jja,UndergroundPhoenix,2,Tue Jun 9 03:53:58 2015 UTC,I think Goddess_Keira has some great advice. I'll add on that snugger bands may be riding down more due to the much too-small and likely too shallow cups. When you remeasure to look for nursing bras it could be worthwhile to at least try on some snugger bands. For now looser bands will definitely be the way to go though.  If you can find something with a stretch lace upper panel that would be excellent for accommodating breast fluctuations. Generally I would say Panache Andorra but you're unlikely to find it that cheap and it may be too narrow and close-set for you. I recently saw some amazing deals on some Goddess bras on Amazon so definitely look into those.
ABraThatFits,393jja,drawingdwarf,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:00:30 2015 UTC,Mostly the bands slide down because it's a tricky spot and I'm about an inch or two narrower underneath the bump. Bands tend to lay right on the bump too  I'm a bit worried that the cup size is a little bit overestimated because I really am that shallow. I don't have the same projection as most of the 36:7s or 38:6s on bratabase. Maybe it's just my eyes playing tricks on me.  I'll see what I can try and post a fit check.
ABraThatFits,393jja,drawingdwarf,5,Tue Jun 9 03:20:38 2015 UTC,"Definitely scoop and swoop when you put your bras on to make sure everything makes it into the cup. Shallow breasts are sometimes called ""stealth boobs"" because they look smaller than they really are. Shallow breasts don't often get overestimated, it's generally just an issue of getting the right shape bra. Vertically seamed half cups are usually good options. Which reminds me that figleaves has some stuff on clearance. Not so good for returns compared to Amazon, but could be worth a look, especially after you've tried some stuff out.  I will say the calculator can overestimate conical breasts (like mine) because they stick out pretty far but don't have much fullness, so the volume is smaller than the calculator expects.  A snug enough band should stay in place fairly well, but there's a lot of variation due to personal preference and comfort. It's always worth trying a variety of sizes regardless.  Good luck!"
ABraThatFits,393jja,Goddess_Keira,3,Tue Jun 9 03:46:00 2015 UTC,"It is definitely possible that the cup size is overestimated. You might be fine in, say, a 38F or for right now, if you should go with the smaller 36 band, 36FF (those being UK cup sizes). Those would be about the smallest sizes that are likely to fit, though, and since at this point you will only be growing, you don't want to invest in a cup or band size that's too small to begin with. That would be wasted money, even if it is cheap.  A difficulty arises in that you haven't the budget to try on lots of different bras and sizes. If you happen to be near a Nordstrom Rack, sometimes you can get very good buys there if you happen to get lucky with your size."
ABraThatFits,393jja,joanna70,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:42:00 2015 UTC,I think there is a rack on the other side of town. There is a bra store here too but I'm not how sure how good they are. I just have to figure out how to get out without the kids.

It just sucks because I bought them from Figleaves which is UK based. I'm impatient and moving in a week, so that is why I'm dreading to exchange them.   Thank you for your input by the way. :)"
ABraThatFits,393w92,MutantToenail,5,Tue Jun 9 02:40:46 2015 UTC,"Cleo and Panache are both UK brands so there's no need to convert to US sizes.  The second one looks like it's too low on your body. Maybe it's too short for you. The bikini looks like the band is too big (I see wrinkling) and possibly the cups are too small also. You might try a 32G for a shorter band, or a 32GG if you want a cupsize up and a bandsize down. I would suggest posting your five measurements from the sidebar also. Maybe you would be better off in a 30 band? I can't tell without the measurements.  Those are both super cute suits by the way!"
ABraThatFits,393w92,MutantToenail,3,Tue Jun 9 02:54:49 2015 UTC,"No, the sizes are wildly different for US and UK after DD cup, and different US brands even use different sizing systems. That's why we try to stick to using only UK sizes here-- they are standardized. Here is a chart to the different sizing systems-- as you can see, US brands make it very complicated.  The bra you linked (the Andorra) is a Panache bra which is a UK bra. That is a UK H cup, not a US H cup."

I was told I was a 34 H/ G depending on the brand.   Could you please share your measurements? Also, how tall are you?    Cleo Cassie    The top looks like a good fit.   Panache's Britt   I agree with others that trying the Panache Britt in another size would be the way to go. 32G IMO. The smaller bandsize will result in a suit that is smaller overall, while keeping the same cupsize.    But the cups... Should have I gone up one?    I think you got cut-related quadboob. The cut of the cups is more closed on top than on the Cleo Cassie. Britt is based upon the Panache Tango II Balc. / Cleo Lucy shape while Cassie is based upon Juna / Marcie. So this cut cuts in, despite being the correct size. You could size up, but then the cup gets too large and you loose support."
ABraThatFits,393w92,BriannaRG,2,Tue Jun 9 04:54:51 2015 UTC,"I think a few other postings took care of the sizing suggestions, so I'm going to add a recommendation. These two suits are adorable, and totally cute on you, but I have had the same problem you described with halters. In larger cup ranges like we wear, it puts SO much pressure on your neck! But I kept buying them because I wanted to look my age, and halters look so cute!  I finally splurged on a bra-sized suit from Freya this year that has regular (non-halter) straps, and I'm officially in love. It is amazing to not have all that weight and pressure on my neck! I personally tried the Freya Sweetheart Padded Bikini in Bon Bon, but there are so many options in cute fabrics and cuts. It might be worth trying so you feel more comfortable and get some relief from the pressure on your neck!"
ABraThatFits,393w92,ilikepai,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:59:48 2015 UTC,"I think the Cassie is a super cute print. It definitely looks like it's sitting too low on you - do you get quadboob if you pull it up? I'm wondering why you bought it in a 34FF when you said you're a 34G. I think a 34G would be better, or a 32GG since you said the band is loose. The bottoms also look like they're really cutting in. A L might be more comfortable and give you a more streamlined silhouette.  Also to help with the weight of a halter, I like to tie my halters into bra backs or cross backs. If your halter straps are long enough, you just criss cross them and tie them to the band in the back! Criss crossing makes it a little difficult to get in and out of the bikini, but it helps to combat an east-west look."
ABraThatFits,393w92,ilikepai,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:41:26 2015 UTC,"I bought the swimsuits in 34 FF because that is the UK equivalent to a US 34 H. The swimsuits are European made I believe and I bought them from an online site based out of the UK.   As for the bottom, I think a large would be great for the belly area but not for my back end. I have no butt, so even the medium wasn't snug. I wish I could have tried both sizes. :( This sucks.   And thank you for the suggestion on how to tie the halter top. That is a wonderful idea. Maybe if I get it to the right size I could just see it. But my hubby could help strap me in.  Thanks for your comment!"

I did an unbelievable amount of research on the four bras I own, all bought online, and they fit well.   The fantastic part about the online bra-fitting community is that there are women of all shapes and sizes here, so someone is bound to have tried a bra you're interested in. You can make a post here and ask ""has anyone else ever tried bra X from brand Y?"" You'll most likely get a detailed response from at least one person who owns the bra.   But the responses you get to your question may be hard to apply to your own body if you are not sure about your breast shape yet. For example, if you were to ask about Cleo Marcie, you'd get about 100 responses telling you that it's full on top. But you don't know if your breasts also have that characteristic yet. The shape guide can be confusing for people who've never really considered what shape their breasts are before. The easiest way for most people to figure it out is to try on bras with well-documented shape characteristics and see what happens.  Since you are unsure about both your shape and size at this point, I'd make a dual measurement/fit check post with the 38I you just bought from Dillard's. Put your 5 measurements from the measuring guide in the post, as well as the brand and style name/model number of the bra you just got, and a description of how it fits. Someone is bound to have tried on that style before, and will have an idea about its shape and whether it runs small, large, etc."
ABraThatFits,394hyt,aboywithgirls,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:40:23 2015 UTC,thank you for this tidbit. i think i will:) this community is so incredibly helpful. from the shape chart i think pretty sure i am full on top. tomorrow i will find some string and a ruler.
ABraThatFits,394hyt,yellkaa,2,Tue Jun 9 05:44:12 2015 UTC,"Free returns mean you can even post a fit check on here before deciding what to send back.  Sure you need to have a certain amount of funds available to do it, but it doesn't cost a lot overall once you send them back.  I pretty much only shop online."
ABraThatFits,394c3b,Miranitage,2,Tue Jun 9 04:09:25 2015 UTC,"FWIW, I'm not sure if you're wanting just the regular Deco or not, but I recently got the Deco Vibe and I found it ran true to size in the band and actually about a cup small. Just FYI!"
ABraThatFits,394c3b,_veritas,2,Tue Jun 9 05:00:38 2015 UTC,"I found the same. I tried losing weight (35 lbs) in hopes of reducing my cup size. When I tried on the Freya Deco Delight, it has a hook in between the straps so it can convert to a racer back.   it fit like a dream. And then. ...I looked at the size, it was a 36H!  But the fitter said something that made perfect sense,  ""It's not about the size, it's about the fit"". Either way, I wore it home."
ABraThatFits,394c3b,aboywithgirls,2,Tue Jun 9 14:33:58 2015 UTC,"It runs large for those who are not FOT, it's all about shape.  I'm shallow, though not quite so much since gaining a cup size and can now wear Deco, but I size down.  Someone with FOT breasts will find it true to size.  The new Deco has a top trim in all models and on some people this makes it very slightly less FOT than the old plain rimmed Deco, so it may fit a few people more, and in their normal size.  If you possibly can it's always best to order at least two sizes, even if neither fits it answers the questions better (ie if one doesn't fit you end up wondering if sizing up or down might have worked).  It's really hard, especially when you're not long into your bra journey, to order one bra and have it work out."
ABraThatFits,39464a,Asswey,2,Tue Jun 9 03:18:51 2015 UTC,Cleo sounds like a good bet for you.
ABraThatFits,39464a,marijuana_andmakeup,2,Tue Jun 9 03:51:53 2015 UTC,"It's hardly ever about the brand, most brands have a wide range of style in different shapes.  I have Masquerade, Freya, Fantasie and Fauve bras!  Sounds like you're an even shape if your nipples point directly to the floor when you lean 90 degrees.  it might help if you posted all 5 measurements, and be aware that not only should you try on more than one cup size if at all possible but that you will end up owning more than one size, so it makes even more sense to shop for a range of sizes :)."
ABraThatFits,39464a,joanna70,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:20:19 2015 UTC,My measurements are  Snug underbust: 34 Tight underbust: 33 Standing bust: 41 Leaning bust: 42 Lying bust: 41

ABraThatFits,393lo5,HootyMyBoobs,2,Tue Jun 9 00:39:15 2015 UTC,"Also, the elastic on the band rolls under my smaller breast and digs painfully.    Sometimes it rolls when the band is a bit too tight. Your underbust measurements indicate you are closer to a 36 band. Sometimes also the elastic has a tendency to roll no matter what you do. (Panache Ariza was notorious for this.) In this case the solution is to sew the band up in such a way so that it is more comfortable. You can fold the band into position and stitch it to the outside of the bra near the underwire.    but I'm getting small dimpling in the cup near the apex on the GG and the H, that is visible under a shirt. Any idea why?    Your breasts do not fill out the cup there. They fill it by 99 percent in that spot but not by 100 percent.  If it was just one bra I would blame it on a seam that is a bit crooked, but with both sides being the same and since you say it happens in more than one bra it is the breasts that are at fault. But don't worry, without your purple arrow I would not have seen it, so it will be totally invisible under a shirt.     Etta worked pretty well, other than gaping in the top and it was too full coverage for me and I would have to redo my entire wardrobe to wear it.    Have you ever tried Elomi Caitlyn and Elomi Rita? Elomi Abi?"
ABraThatFits,393lo5,t_maia,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:32:14 2015 UTC,"All my bands roll upwards (thank you belly) and it was just a painful surprise that this one did not. I will definitely be fixing that as soon as I find my sewing kit.   I have tried the plunges (Betty (cup cut in no matter the size), Lexi (same), Jocelyn (should retry as it was too big first time I tried it), Bijou (never again)) and the Etta. Etta was so close, but since I live in tops like this I sent it back as it visible. I will try these, however. 36GG/H range?"
ABraThatFits,393lo5,t_maia,2,Tue Jun 9 02:01:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, same sizes as Envy. Maybe a bit smaller - I know I can wear Elomi bras one cupsize smaller than Panache because Elomis are more projected.   I think Rita is your best bet, like Etta it is cut for a shorter torso and it has a very rounded shape. Caitlyn is a bit pointy (more like blue/green shape), I don't get along with Caitlyn for this reason.   Out of the upcoming bras, the shape of Louisa looks interesting. Elomi always uses the same model, so you can kinda guess how the bra fits based upon how it fits her.   http://www.elomilingerie.com/lingerie/louisa/aw15.aspx  Lousia will come out in July according to the Elomi website.   Abi is sadly discontinued, finding it will be like finding a pink unicorn. But I do remember that Abi was one of the narrowest Elomi bras out there, it gave a really round shape without the massive coverage you get in Etta."
ABraThatFits,393lo5,LadyVerene,2,Tue Jun 9 02:17:19 2015 UTC,Time to hunt and wait. Thank you so much for your help. I also think it's hilarious that my best fit is for a shorter torso and I'm so tall.
ABraThatFits,393lo5,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Tue Jun 9 02:28:32 2015 UTC,"Caitlyn, at the very least, is very full coverage. I love it, it's the comfiest bra I've ever worn, but it covers everything. I do like Jocelyn a lot.  I get my Elomis a cup size smaller than my Panaches."
ABraThatFits,393lo5,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:56:42 2015 UTC,"The 36H looks really good, I can't see the dimpling you're talking about on the left cup. There is a little bit of space but I think that's just the bra being slightly taller than your root."
ABraThatFits,393lo5,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:45:17 2015 UTC,"It feels like the lace is more laying on top of the breast instead of stretching. The stretch lace is working it on the 34HH. It surprised me as they should be close to the same. Did you see the dimpling on the 36GG? Or am I just imagining things?   Also, I just noticed the front of the underarm, both of the 36's fold a little."
ABraThatFits,393lo5,LadyVerene,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:19:42 2015 UTC,"I noticed you had a bit of center spillage/quadboob in the 36GG. I think I found the dimpling you're talking about but I have to squint at the picture to see it, so I don't think that would be very noticeable under a shirt.  The stretch lace on the 34HH seemed to be stretching a lot - possibly due to the shorter band pulling the cups a little shallower. Or the black dye."
ABraThatFits,393lo5,LadyVerene,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:43:24 2015 UTC,Or both. Probably both. I get less tacking the more I extend the band.
ABraThatFits,393nww,soul_scars,11,Tue Jun 9 00:57:14 2015 UTC,"Just to double check, you didn't indent your breast tissue at all when you measured, right? The bust measurements are supposed to be taken pretty loosely in order to accurately represent your breast shape and size when braless.   What brands do you currently own bras from? If the tags still have the model numbers intact, do you know what they are? And which ones are you spilling out of vs. not filling?    Another important aspect of bra fitting is shape. I'm guessing your breast shape doesn't really match up with the bras that you've got, and that's causing a lot of the issues. Even if you're relatively close to the right cup volume already, the wrong shape can make a bra look way too big or way too small or even both at the same time. (It's really mind-boggling and not fun when that happens.) Most American brands make relatively shallow bras, so if your shape is not particularly shallow then you're going to get quadboob and random gaps even in a bra that works size-wise."
ABraThatFits,393nww,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Tue Jun 9 01:56:31 2015 UTC,"I might have measured it too snug.   I have a VS Demi Cups in 34 C that is pretty comfortable. Aerie Lexi in a 34 D fit well except for the straps being way too loose at their tightest. Then a few more generic bras from Kohls dept store in 34 C.  I was a bit confused about finding my shape, but I think I'm not shallow and fuller on top.  Thank you for the info!"
ABraThatFits,393nww,yellkaa,3,Tue Jun 9 11:01:59 2015 UTC,re-measure your bust loosely. when I measure tight standing I may have 38 inches instead of 40. When I measure tight lying it may even get 37 instead of 42 because of soft breast tissue. but looking at the bras I have I'm pretty sure only the loose measurements should be used for fitting.
ABraThatFits,393nww,dancemogdance,4,Tue Jun 9 13:55:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not the best expert, so someone here with similar measurements can chime in but: with a 37"" leaning measurement wouldn't that put you in 32DD/E?"
ABraThatFits,393nww,crazymusicalgenius96,5,Tue Jun 9 04:36:36 2015 UTC,"The leaning does put OP at 32E, but the much smaller standing and laying measurements are causing the calculator to decide cup size by averaging all three. Usually with that large of a range in measurements, you end up with a particularly projected/pendulous shape and the average is more accurate than the leaning bust. This shape is pretty unusual in this size range, though."

I just took the... plunge on another Loretta because I love it - I am narrow, projected, close-set and more even than FoB or FoT these days. if anything it is slightly looser than I'd like it on top. I'm not saying they're the narrowest wires in the world but it definitely works very well for me as a gal who prefers the Polish bras generally. Someone in a band that was too tight might find that stressing the band makes the cups go wider and shallower and lose enough volume to cut in. I did order this one in the next sister size down so we'll see.  The balconette would worry me as I could see it being more closed simply due to how the bra is sewn/having a higher gore but who knows. Perhaps I should order one.. haha apparently $14 is my tipping point for buy ALL the bras! And one last thing, yes you're right, 11 inches is a little nutty for 30FF/G, I've gotten that on 32G and 32GGs."

ABraThatFits,393xgq,thejennadaisy,7,Tue Jun 9 02:25:02 2015 UTC,"I'll second that you should take your 5 measurements and maybe find a better fit in a different size. However, given your limited budget you may not be able to branch out into ""non-matrix"" sizes yet.  In regards to your question, I'm not sure that I have any specific bra suggestions but I know my favorite place to buy bras used to be Ross, Marshalls, TJ Maxx, or Burlington Coat Factory. There are usually some options in 32B and I never paid more than $15 for a bra. I think it would be really worthwhile to try some 32Cs and 32Ds too. I used to wear a 32B and fairly recently switched to a much better 30D/DD. Make sure you scoop and swoop when you put your bras on, it makes a world of difference."
ABraThatFits,393xgq,drawingdwarf,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:07:13 2015 UTC,"Obligatory: I agree with the other comments that you should try measuring yourself.  That said, if you're really sure you're a 32B, I do have several push up plunges in that size that I would be willing to send you for free, including shipping. So if you're okay with them being used (in good condition), PM me :)  But yeah, measure yourself!"
ABraThatFits,393wv9,brassieker,4,Tue Jun 9 02:07:10 2015 UTC,"I would recommend trying a 34F since that's what you measured at on your last post. 32FF and 32G are also worth a try.   Are you pulling the wire up into your IMF when you're putting the bra on?   I agree that both the Neve and the Deco are the wrong shape for you. Molded cups are a tricky fit and they're just not right for your breasts. That's why you have empty space at both the top and the bottom of the cup even though the cup size is too small. Unlined cups like Cleo Lucy are going to fit you much better, so hopefully you can get ahold of one to try on."
ABraThatFits,393wv9,hurrrrrmione,2,Tue Jun 9 03:30:52 2015 UTC,"Aw, man. I'm having a bit of a childish fit, cuz I just don't WANT soft cups - whaa whaa, said the baby. I am going to try some (only when I can get them in sale) but overall, I'd rather put up with a slightly off fit moulded bra than a soft cup. The key word is slightly, though. I wonder if filling out the bottom cup of an otherwise well fitting bra with an insert, especially on my smaller side, would help with the wrinkles and spacing. Though that's probably just gonna push the band down towards my waist. Ugh!"
ABraThatFits,393wv9,wayward_sun,2,Tue Jun 9 15:44:50 2015 UTC,Look at padded seamed cups! Molded and unlined are not the only two options...it's a great midway.

ABraThatFits,393wv9,cupcakery,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:44:08 2015 UTC,"True of probably a majority of people who come on here.  I wish I could come up with a better simile but can you imagine a rucksack with a good frame, sitting against the body, then a big rounded piece of foam forming the body of it?  You can see how it would just not be able to keep the contents up by the frame.  As I say it's a rubbish simile but a single piece of foam, as opposed to a container made with seams, just isn't the best way to support a load, and this leads to limitations.  A correct fitting unlined bra will surprise you - for a start if it fits really well then your nipple will sit behind a seam and be somewhat hidden :)."
ABraThatFits,393wv9,cupcakery,3,Tue Jun 9 18:30:19 2015 UTC,"The Cleo Neve is a super shallow bra and both bras you tried are notoriously polarizing. I'm willing to bet that there's not enough projection in either of them which is part of the reason why they're not sitting in your IMF. There's not enough space in the bottom for your projected breasts so your breasts push the bra down looking for more room near the apex. The bras may also be rubbing your armpits due to the plunge nature of them. You may have more success in a Cleo Lucy or Marcie. With your new measurements I would definitely look for those in 32FF/G. Trying both of those bras should help you determine whether you're FOT or FOB shape. And it's possible to be even, too!   Are you in the US? If you don't already have Amazon prime, it's worth getting a trial of it if possible. There's a purple Cleo Lucy in 32FF and 32G for $29.99. Unfortunately Amazon doesn't have any good sales on Marcie. They do free shipping AND free returns, so Amazon is always a great place for risk-free trial and error."
ABraThatFits,393wv9,cupcakery,2,Tue Jun 9 12:37:56 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, no free returns for me - I'm an hour outside Toronto, Canada. There is exactly 1 ""speciality"" lingerie store here... And they're only open the same hours that I'm at work. Anyways, I had a feeling it had to do with the shallowness of the bras. Should I stick to bras listed at the bottom of the width/ depth ratio graphic in the shape guide, or are those going to get progressively wider as they get deeper? And if I'm looking for a bra that's lower cut in the arm, what bra shape is that? Balconette? u/joanna70 recommended the Parfait Casey or Jeanie in my measurements check, but I hesitate because they both look like they'll clip my arms as well. As for the difference in measurements, I'm pretty sure I did it wrong the first time. I measured my underbust while leaning over, which I thought was weird, lol. But that's how I interpretted the instructions. * eye roll at myself *"
ABraThatFits,393wv9,M_tridactyla,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:30:37 2015 UTC,"Ahhh Canada! If you haven't heard of Butterfly Connection yet, they may end up being a good resource. They don't do free return shipping but they do ship out for free, and since you don't have to return internationally that might help in the future.  My personal opinion is that graphic is outdated and doesn't really address the grading across sizes of those particular bras. Some bras do get wider as they get deeper and therefore the projection changes. It's an okay guide but I wouldn't necessarily be hunting for those specific bras.   You might do better in a balconette than a plunge or full cup as far as clipping under the arms. Is the rubbing happening at the front of your armpit, where the strap meets the cup? Balconettes will be lower in general but their straps are often wider set and can still be irritating. If it's more under your armpit directly, you might have luck researching wing heights on Bratabase. The wing height on Neve in 32F is .1"" higher than it is on Lucy, so I'm not sure if it will make that much of a difference. You can also compare wire length on bras with similar gore heights, if it's the wire that's being stabby on the outside. Cleo's tend to have shorter wires than Panache, for example. Though, part of the (potential) stabbiness could also be from too-wide wires.  It's hard to tell until you try them."
ABraThatFits,393wv9,joanna70,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:53:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, Canada. The land of ice, snow and ill fitting bras :)   It's not the wires stabbing. The rubbing is in front, yup, where the straps meet the bra. I have little pockets of fat there (possibly migrated tissue? Whole other discussion). You can see it on the left of the 3rd and 4th Neve pictures. I guess that's just going to be sussed out by trial and error.  Since you mentioned gore height, that's something else I have figure out, by trial. I think average height is good for me, maybe... I don't even know, hah.  Your flair says you're splayed - that's where theres a triangle shaped space between your breast, right? I think that might more accurately describe me than just ""separate"" (though I have no problems getting cleavage, like some other wideset users). Should I be watching out for fit advice based on that too?"
ABraThatFits,393wv9,M_tridactyla,2,Tue Jun 9 17:22:39 2015 UTC,"Where it's rubbing may be partially migrated tissue, may be fat, or may just be part of your tail of spence which may not ever go away. I think a balconette will certainly help, but you're right - it's all trial and error.  Your breasts don't appear to be close-set so gore height shouldn't bother you too much. Balconettes always have higher gores so once you try them you'll pretty much know if they're a deal breaker or not.   Splayed means that your (my) breasts point outwards when left to their own devices. I actually have quite a bit of inner fullness which is visible when I'm in a bra, but otherwise my boobs like to try and escape into my armpits and my nipples point diagonally outwards instead of straight ahead. There's not a ton to look for as far as that's concerned, though bras with the extra side support panel may help in pushing splayed breasts in and together. (That bra is the Panache Envy and I love it a lot.) I also had a good bit of tissue migration when I started wearing appropriately-sized bras because it was super easy for my splayed breasts to get shoved back into the band in too-small cups. It's not a dominating factor in bra fit, though, but one to be aware of when you start getting into more of the nuances. :)"

They are so often plunges or full cups, in the larger cup ranges, so come up high at the strap intersection.  I struggled with wide set straps rubbing my Tail of Spence with quite a few of my early bras, but somehow it's all settled down.  I think part of it is actually getting used to them, I did move the straps on my Deco and a Masquerade bra inwards but actually it seems to be the little stitches etc that irritate, no matter where the straps are set, but that gradually getting used to them has worked."

ABraThatFits,392hvs,neednewbra,4,Mon Jun 8 19:53:08 2015 UTC,"To answer your question re: band size - It's possible some of the 34 bands felt tight because the cup wasn't large enough. When the cups are too small, the breast tissue has to go somewhere so it takes up room in the band, making the band feel tighter than it actually is. Your measurements indicate that you shouldn't need a 36 band unless it runs REALLY crazy tight. And you do want them firm on the loosest hook as they will stretch. It's better to need an extender temporarily than have to start on the middle or tightest hook.  I think you're going to end up in a UK 34F, which is 4D's in US sizing. None of the bras you tried had cups big enough, I reckon. You definitely want to fit to the larger breast and either tighten the strap or hunt for pads/chicken cutlets for the smaller one if the asymmetry is really bothersome.   Natori Feathers is one of the shallowest bras potentially on earth. It will likely not fit you in any size, as your measurements indicate you're probably more projected than shallow. I don't know much about the Chantelle bra you mentioned.  I think heading towards UK brands is a good start. You can order online via Amazon (Prime = free shipping and returns) or Nordstrom (free shipping and returns always). Depending on your shape I would recommend starting with either Cleo Marcie (for more FOT) or Lucy (for FOB) in 34F. edit - I apparently can't read. For even breasts, we typically recommend Cleo Lily/Erin. It will have narrower wires and more projection than what you tried on in-store. Panache also makes a couple of bras that have stretch lace on the top section that kind of conforms to mask asymmetry. Those are Envy, Jasmine, and Andorra. You would want 34F with those as well."
ABraThatFits,392hvs,cupcakery,2,Mon Jun 8 20:31:36 2015 UTC,Hello I'm also a 34DD. I been having  great Luck with Calvin Claim bras. The last 3 pairs I purchase online have feet me perfectly.
ABraThatFits,391h3v,brafittingaccount,3,Mon Jun 8 15:45:24 2015 UTC,"Cleo Lucy in 30FF was closest, but it is too wide for you, that's why the cups slid like they did - you can see in the side pics all that empty space in the side of the cup.  You are quite narrow and projected and Lucy is the widest and shallowest unlined Cleo, IMO.  I'd love to see a Cleo Lily in a 30FF on you, probably would have been better than that Lucy.  Lily and Marcie have good projection but in the 30G were both too big/open on top - however I'm truly not sure if it's the cups that are too big overall, or if just the tops of the cups were too open for your shape.  Keeping that in mind, try a Curvy Kate Bardot in a 30G - it's more closed off on top than the 30G Lucy, it's also narrower in the wires, with lots of projection at the bottom.  Not to mention it's freakin beautiful, and has a 3-hook closure instead of 2 which lends stability and support to the band.  Because it's narrower and more closed off, and I personally find it to run a little small in the cups, I would not suggest you size down to a 30FF in it.  Cleo is known for pretty firm bands, so if you thought their 30 bands were stretchy, it would probably be worth trying their 28 bands.  So to try these bras again in 28's and a cup size smaller, you'd try them in 28G.  But try that CK Bardot, really.  And last time I checked it's not too expensive on Amazon."
ABraThatFits,391h3v,lcl0706,2,Mon Jun 8 16:04:52 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much. This is really the type of information I needed... I looked at many photos in the various guides but had a hard time coming up with shallow versus projected versus wide, etc, etc, so knowing ""narrow and projected"" is golden.   Good to know too that 30G might still be right in other styles. I'll take a look at the CK Bardot and also see whether I can find a Lily 30FF with Prime shipping. I do prefer 3-hook closures to 2-hook closures, so that's a plus for the Bardot.  As for stretchy bands, maybe I'm just really used to wearing Prima Donna for the past year or so. I just pulled out one of the 30G Cleos and the 30G Deauville (both new) and stretched them both. The Cleo went about two inches further than the Deauville (which is also wider in the band overall). So maybe sizing down for Cleo bras would help, yeah.   I appreciate your advice!"

ABraThatFits,391h3v,noys,3,Mon Jun 8 17:16:30 2015 UTC,"You're wearing pretty much all of these bras too low and that can skew fit.  I suspect that dropping a cup size in Lily would give you a good fit but you need to actively position underwires correctly when putting the bra on. There should be no underboob, no skin on skin contact under breasts.  http://brasandbodyimage.com/2012/09/05/putting-your-bra-on-properly/"

I had to take the bra off again and shorten up the straps, but it did seem to help. It ended up an inch or so above the marks I had from wearing my bra all day so you're absolutely right. I've never had a bra stay up there, though. My ribcage narrows from there, and even just now wearing this now-properly-put-on bra it has slid down about half an inch and will likely go further.   I'll follow up with photos if I can."

Then I tried putting on the 30G Lily the same way, tightened to the smallest hook in hopes of keeping it up. (You can see the marks below from where my old bra had slipped down after a bit.) I shortened the straps on the Lily too. But as soon as I walked across the room it started slipping down too. :-/  Ideas?"
ABraThatFits,391h3v,joanna70,2,Tue Jun 9 01:47:25 2015 UTC,:/   A smaller cup size might keep things more steady. Do you think your torso has a strong V shape?

You seem to have pretty short roots- I'd try the Cleo Meg in 30FF if you can find it. Otherwise, Cleo Ellis works well for me in 30FF. Apparently that means Cleo Marcie in 30FF should be pretty good as well, but those may have too much of an open top for you.   I'm interested in seeing the Lily on you in 30FF, because I have one and it looks really odd on me. I'm not sure if it's a shape mismatch or I need to go up a cup.    I agree that if the bands seemed to loose for you, you should try 28G. Make sure you have some extenders on hand incase you need them at first to break the band in. If the band ends up too tight, it'll pull the cups too wide and shallow."

I looked for the Cleos you mentioned but they don't seem available right now on Amazon Prime (which is what I want to stick to as much as possible for now for ease in shipping back and forth). The Lily in 30FF is there but without free return shipping, but I might give it a go anyway. Or perhaps try the Lily in 28G first since it does have free return shipping.  Either way, I'll definitely share how it turns out! Thanks!"
ABraThatFits,391h3v,ilikepai,2,Tue Jun 9 00:48:36 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to throw a couple of thoughts out because I'm not sure what's going on.  I THINK you have very short roots, the Marcie looks like the best fit overall in some ways but the wires may be too narrow (most of these have visible dinks at the ends of the underwire at the armpit), which would make you wide and short.  Now often short roots ACT full on bottom, but Lucy doesn't look so good.  Now it may be that because the cups are all too large that, with all the space at the bottom of Lucy, that extra volume looks sadder than Marcie which is shallower at the bottom.  Cleo actually has pretty firm bands, if a Freya 30 is too loose a Cleo 30 should be much better, otherwise try a 28, most of their bras I believe are available in 28 bands, size up in the cup of course to keep the volume the same.  Edited to add - I got side tracked and took a while posting this, obviously the wire width thing will be key, I just don't know, I can see the wrinkles and apparent unused space in the Lucy, and dinks can be misleading too.  Can you have more of a feel, look, marking with an eyeliner etc and see if you can work out which wire width is the best (up to 1/2"" too wide usually fine, too narrow is not)?"
ABraThatFits,391h3v,t_maia,4,Mon Jun 8 17:43:55 2015 UTC,"I THINK you have very short roots,   Possible, but I think this is a case of shape 1/6 - 1/5 with taller roots than what is immediately obvious. The lower edge of the ski-slope is what fills the cup and the upper edge is just a thin layer that is invisible under the skin. The Marcie lifts the lower edge up and creates a rounded shape that makes the root look shorter than it really is.   If the OP really had short roots the Deauville would fit a lot worse.   Second, if the wires are too narrow and prevent a proper swoop and scoop, the upper cup stays empty and the cup looks to large.    The OP looks like a mini-version of me and I have very similar photos of myself in Cleo Lucy in 38H, 38HH and 38J. In 38H the cup is too small and I get spillage and poking wires just like the OP in 30FF. In 38HH the wires are still too narrow, poke and the upper cup looks empty, just like on the OP in 30G. It is only when I try 38J that it becomes obvious that the 38HH looking too large was an orange-in-a-glass.    I am really scratching my head, too bad  that OP is sized out of Elomi."

VS is known for being quite shallow, so I'm not surprised.   I'm not an expert in your size range so I'm not sure about what bras to recommend specifically, but I'm willing to bet it's going to be something more projected than you're in now! Check out the sites that /u/braaccount mentioned - they're solid."
ABraThatFits,392ghe,katelem,3,Mon Jun 8 19:44:05 2015 UTC,"Hm, would you mind sharing your five measurements per the beginner's guide? This will help us recommend bras in the correct size range. The bra you're currently wearing is equivalent to a UK/US 36DD, which is a frequently mis-fitted size. We want to make sure you're in the best size range before we lead you astray with recommendations!   Slipping straps, while potentially it's own issue, could also be because of a too-large band. Racerback or J-hooks are a possibility if it turns out to be a chronic problem. I've never worn a true racerback, but with J-hook bras you fasten the straps together in the back after you have the whole bra on.   For full on bottom shapes we typically recommend Cleo Lucy as a good starter bra, but there have been issues with strap slipping with that one. Have you tried any plunge styles? Freya plunges are good for FOB shapes and they'll have more narrow-set straps than typical balconettes."
ABraThatFits,392ghe,cupcakery,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:56:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response! My measurements are: underbust: 38 tight underbust: 36.5 bust standing: 42.5 bust leaning: 45 bust lying: 45  The bra size calculator gave me a 38DD/E, but when I went for a fitting the 38 bands were too large. The 36 is snug - so snug, in fact, that the ""breaking in"" process has not been super pleasant. 38 is definitely too large, but a 34 would be actually painful - so I don't think band size is an issue here.   The plunge styles I tried on had underwires that came up too high for my petite frame, but I don't think any of them were a Cleo Lucy or a Freya - I'll try those brands, thank you!"
ABraThatFits,392ghe,cupcakery,2,Tue Jun 9 01:02:26 2015 UTC,Great! Keep in mind how sister sizing works. As you go down in band you have to go up in cup. So 38DD/E will have the same volume as 36E/F. That current Simone perele bra is 1-2 cups smaller than that. Hopefully a bigger cup and more compatible shape will be helpful!
ABraThatFits,392ghe,bleedmercury,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:05:06 2015 UTC,"I usually put the bra on backwards, attach the straps, and then turn it around and pull it up."
ABraThatFits,392d6r,M_tridactyla,2,Mon Jun 8 19:21:35 2015 UTC,"Your link isn't working at the moment.  Are you sure the bra is a Panache? I can't find a model called Bombshell.  If it's the Freya Bombshell unlined plunge, yep, that's for FOB with narrow roots. I think the Freya unlined plunges are regarded as tricky fits."
ABraThatFits,392d6r,M_tridactyla,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:46:28 2015 UTC,"YES IT IS THE FREYA. I'm a dork and I mix up the bras all the time. :p AND WTF, IS IMGUR NOT LETTING ME UPLOAD THESE ANYMORE? I'm trying to fix the link, :c but it's apparently only going to allow me to upload SFW images?  Someone suggested the Patsy, would that be ok for wide roots/projected?"
ABraThatFits,392d6r,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:53:35 2015 UTC,"It depends. Patsy is pretty shallow. Lauren is another Freya halfcup which is somewhat more projected. All of Freya's halfcups (except the unlined Starlet one that's new) are based on either Patsy or Lauren, including the longlines. Patsies are more common, but there are many Laurens as well.  Wide and projected is sort of a difficult combination. Some Wacoal bras might work for you in 34G-- they don't use UK sizing.  If you are FOT and projected, Curvy Kate unlined bras might work. I'd suggest ordering from Amazon because they can be hard to fit."
ABraThatFits,392d6r,crazymusicalgenius96,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:02:48 2015 UTC,"I fixed the link!   Maybe I'm not as wide rooted as I think I am? I'm probably about medium projection, but I get a false ""root test"" check when I do the ""push your boob over test."" Cleo/Freya, I know now, are too narrow."
ABraThatFits,392d6r,crazymusicalgenius96,2,Mon Jun 8 20:06:18 2015 UTC,"The link just shows me a tiny gif. Is the bra lined or unlined? Both the half cup and the plunge balcony are capable of giving a pointy shape, but the unlined plunge would probably be pointier."
ABraThatFits,392d6r,M_tridactyla,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:51:05 2015 UTC,"I deleted the link because I accidentally posted it to the Imgur gallery like a dweeb D:  It's the Freya Bombshell padded(?) halfcup. I'm learning now that it's more for FOB, which I think I'm even or slightly FOT, and I'm thinking that's what I'm pointy in it. Cleo Lucy also gave me the same shape. The wires are also too narrow. I get quadboobing when I first scoop and swoop in my right breast, which is the larger one."
ABraThatFits,392d6r,M_tridactyla,2,Mon Jun 8 21:05:17 2015 UTC,"Okay, cool. The bra gives kind of a pointy profile naturally, I think. I have a clone of this bra (the Freya Daydreamer) and it's a little pointy on me, too. It's definitely roomier on the bottom than most half cups, though it works for my even shape too. The wires are average-ish in my size range, and I'd imagine they'd be similar in yours. So I'd agree with your assessment that you need wide wires.  I think trying the unlined Curvy Kates in 34F is a good idea, and if those are still too narrow for you, try some stuff in 34FF for the width and projection."
ABraThatFits,392d6r,M_tridactyla,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:29:26 2015 UTC,"Curvy Kate it is! I feel like the bras that have wider wires are slowly starting to look less ""fun."" I love a lot of Freya's patterns. :C  Am I staying away from balcony bras?"
ABraThatFits,391u9w,fernambuk,6,Mon Jun 8 17:14:32 2015 UTC,"I almost can't imagine that bra fitting anyone in the larger cups, the larger the cup size the less likely the boobs are to be shallow, possible, but less likely.  The band may be a fraction tight, try an extender (non-elasicated, find them on ebay) or you may be better in a 30 band.  I have been okayed by Bravissimo when I self selected a 28 band Freya and it was always too tight, plus they have also okayed bras that were too narrow in the wires, so they're not infallible.  I think the bra is too shallow and wide and the fitter has taken you up a size more than you strictly need, you have over 3.5"" between your bust measurements so are unlikely to be shallow.  I would recommend if you can buying some basic and more projected bras online with free returns (Bravissimo even offer free exchanges) to see if you can find a better fit.  Have you looked at the Shape Guide in the side bar at all, it may help you, it may not, but there are ""diagnostic"" bras you can order if you don't have a clue on shape."
ABraThatFits,391u9w,joanna70,2,Mon Jun 8 17:58:57 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'll have a look. A problem I was having when finding this bra was that almost all bras I tried were cutting into the top of my boobs."
ABraThatFits,391u9w,joanna70,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:05:37 2015 UTC,"Okay, so you may have a tall root or be full on top and need bras suitable for that shape.  Ignore the ""round"" description as it's not really going to help on here, the right bra shaped bra often makes boobs rounder, you need to get into finding out what shape you are, perhaps trying on a classic FOT bra like Cleo Marcie (though it is narrow) and perhaps a shallow bra like Cleo Juna or a Freya half cup (though their 28 bands are stretchy) in a couple of sizes and see where you're at then.  The Shape Guide, plus reading around on here (search function top right) will help you, there's a lot to learn.  Reading on here you'd have found out that Porcelain fits very few peope despite its popularity with fitters who seem to bow to demands for moulded bras (which are a much trickier fit, start with seamed if you possibly can).  If you want a fuller on top moulded bra then Freya Deco is worth a try, though again the band is stretchy."
ABraThatFits,391u9w,anonphilia,3,Thu Jun 11 08:28:39 2015 UTC,"Projection was my root issue (pun and seriousness intended). If a bra is not projected enough,  even if it's the right size and I don't quadboob, I will eventually have breast pain."
ABraThatFits,391u9w,M_tridactyla,3,Mon Jun 8 22:51:28 2015 UTC,"This bra is average width and pretty shallow, so I wonder if your breasts are being compressed a bit and that's causing the problem.  Tenderness around the edges might also be from a wire width issue. Are you sure it's wide enough? Or, perhaps the bra cup is compressing them against the wire.  This is totally speculative, but possibly you're experiencing tissue migration since it finally all fits in the cup and it'll be tender for a while?  Lastly, did you happen to change birth control pills at the same time? Some of them can cause wicked tenderness."
ABraThatFits,391u9w,yellkaa,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:52:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight, it might be shallowness. I'm not on birth control."
ABraThatFits,3915ru,hspiggy,5,Mon Jun 8 14:22:37 2015 UTC,"I think 38G might be overestimating a touch, but it's definitely not out of the question. I would start with 38F and 38FF's, and depending on how stretchy the bands are you may be able to size down to 36FF/G.   Are you scooping and swooping into the bras you have currently? Overspill in the tops and sides means you could probably go up at least 2 cup sizes, especially if you're not swooping and scooping.  Can you tell us a little more about your shape? We can start to suggest bras once we have at least a little of that information."
ABraThatFits,38xhbr,CvrdCnfsd,10,Sun Jun 7 17:59:28 2015 UTC,Fun idea to try. I've made patterns from old lingerie before but it always required cutting them up!

I think it was one part having shallow breasts and one part that I developed early in a lot of ways but late in terms of breast growth.   I wear either 30F, 30FF, 32E or 32F depending on the bra etc. I STILL think of myself as flat-chested?   Then I went out and got myself a binder (meant to flatten the chest as much as possible) and realized that even wearing the snuggest one I can manage to wriggle into, I'm not totally flat?
