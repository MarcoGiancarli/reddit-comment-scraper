CHICubs,3e4az6,voidecho,8,Tue Jul 21 21:12:47 2015 UTC,"Good to see that he and the coaches know what's going wrong, hope he can fix it.  I understand the frustration with his struggles, but can't stand when the narrative turns to being lazy or not caring.  Attributing bad performance to personal failings without any evidence is the part I hate most about some fans."
CHICubs,3e4az6,DrunkenSuperman,0,Tue Jul 21 22:41:29 2015 UTC,"It's not completely without evidence. There have been many times throughout his career where he's just lost focus in the field or hasn't run balls out. Not saying that his struggles this year are due to not caring, but there is some evidence that he hasn't always gone all out."
CHICubs,3e4az6,Bob2456,3,Tue Jul 21 23:53:37 2015 UTC,"I agree to some extent, but i do think there's a difference between his intensity and maybe professionalism on the one hand and his work rate on the other. He decidedly appears to lack intensity, but I've never heard anyone really effectively question his work rate. The effort is there."
CHICubs,3e4az6,thirdfounder,0,Wed Jul 22 01:45:22 2015 UTC,"You'll be downvoted all day, but you speak nothing but the truth. Castro has attention problems, and people get way to defensive when it's brought to light."
CHICubs,3e4az6,GLGreenLantern,3,Wed Jul 22 00:57:58 2015 UTC,Focus problems aren't the same as hard work problems. I tend to agree with you about the brain farts on the field.

CHICubs,3e33h1,snowcone_wars,9,Tue Jul 21 16:14:58 2015 UTC,"I sometimes wonder about this whole concept of letting a player work on their problems with major league at bats, especially when the team is in contention.  Take Derek Jeter in 2011.  By then he was a below average defender (IMO he has never been a great defender) that was having a poor offensive season and slowly creeping towards 3000 hits hitting .260 and got hurt.  Because the injury gave him cover for his pride (IMO) he was able to go rehab away from crowds and distractions with a quality hitting coach (actually a manager) from his minor league days.  When he came back he was a very different Jeter.  He hit .326 for the remainder of the season.  That is a massive difference.  Now, that is just one rather famous case, but I personally believe that the principle is sound.  I don't know if Castro should fake an injury, but it sure would be convenient if he had a minor finger jam or something that would let them send him to Mesa for a couple of weeks to work on his strike outs and let Baez, et alli, to get some time in at short."
CHICubs,3e33h1,joejance,16,Tue Jul 21 18:58:40 2015 UTC,in fWAR he ranks 153 out of 160 players that qualify.  On the bright side he's still better than 3 whitesox players :)
CHICubs,3e33h1,vanfanel1car,10,Tue Jul 21 16:35:24 2015 UTC,But but he's a former all star and stuff!
CHICubs,3e33h1,YourCummyBear,2,Tue Jul 21 17:30:04 2015 UTC,I'll take that bright side every day!
CHICubs,3e33h1,KingOfMoogles,19,Tue Jul 21 17:12:51 2015 UTC,"Castro has been one of the absolute worst players in the majors this year.  Not just SS, but one of the worst players.   According to FanGraphs he is 21st in WAR among qualifying SS putting him behind the likes of Jimmy Rollins and Marcus Simien.  When compared to all qualifying position players in baseball, Castro's WAR has him at 153 out of 160 players.   Watching as much baseball as I have been this summer, I don't need these numbers to tell me that he's been bad, but it's a good snapshot to show how bad he is when compared to other players across the league.    That being said, there's really no solution to it right now.  Benching him would mess with his psyche too much and you'll never get that player we once knew back.  But he can't be sent out there every single day as he's hurting the team.  Only thing I foresee happening here is more routine days off for Castro."
CHICubs,3e33h1,notrightmeow,6,Tue Jul 21 16:33:39 2015 UTC,"I think once Baez gets back, if he can perform decently, it might be best to platoon the infield if possible, maybe get Russell some time at short as well.  I agree about that messing with Castro's psyche, but I'm just not sure how much worse it could actually get for him."
CHICubs,3e33h1,Tjagra,3,Tue Jul 21 17:18:44 2015 UTC,"Its going to be messy defensively if Baez lights it up. They said Castro and Russel aren't changing positions this year. However, Russel is obviously the best SS on the roster defensively and Javy can play 2B.  So if Baez comes up and starts launching bombs in to Sheffield hitting .280+, does he play SS or 2B? Asking them to change positions so often is not ideal."
CHICubs,3e33h1,UNSTABLETON_LIVE,2,Tue Jul 21 18:45:37 2015 UTC,"SS, he can provide at least Castro level of defense."
CHICubs,3e33h1,THEriot2,2,Wed Jul 22 00:30:03 2015 UTC,Baez is considered above average at defense.
CHICubs,3e33h1,Badtz,7,Wed Jul 22 01:31:41 2015 UTC,"Even including last year, he's been one of the worst players in the league over his last 1600 plate appearances."
CHICubs,3e33h1,thirdfounder,12,Tue Jul 21 20:12:30 2015 UTC,"The problem is, what are the alternatives right now?  If Tommy La Stella was healthy, I'd say bench Castro, play La Stella at second every day and move Russell to short. But he's not, so all you have is Jonathan Herrera. Baez is still rehabbing. Right now, it's just better to play Castro and hope for the best.   People talk about moving him to third, and putting Bryant in the outfield. But then you're taking Cogs out of the lineup. At this point, it's probably going to be really difficult to trade Castro. And honestly, from a team chemistry standpoint, I wonder how it would go over in the clubhouse.. everyone seems to love Starlin.  This team is still rebuilding. Hopefully, next season there will be better alternatives, but right now I think you have to accept Castro for what he is, and hope he gets better."
CHICubs,3e33h1,jcftw61,5,Tue Jul 21 16:30:11 2015 UTC,"I agree our options aren't great, that's why I'm not in favor of trading him.  I think if Baez gets back and performs half-way decently, then it might be best to just platoon Castro and Baez, maybe get Russell some time at short as well."
CHICubs,3e33h1,Banglayna,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:16:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think his trade value is gone. He's just 25 but experienced. Middle infield offense is quite rare. He clearly has mechanical issues - which is why he grounds out to the left side every fucking time - but that could probably be remedied. And his contact isn't onerous.   It's just possible he could be the major piece that brings a rental starter.   But truthfully I think the Cubs are better off with him. Baez is no lock to make it in the majors with his contact issues. While Russell is clearly a keeper there's nothing promised for Alcantara. Starlin might still be a key piece for the next handful of years. If not, let the kids push him out."
CHICubs,3e33h1,stackshot,6,Wed Jul 22 01:56:26 2015 UTC,"I'm still a fan of putting Bryant in the OF, moving Baez to third, putting Russell at short and putting Castro at second."
CHICubs,3e33h1,Tjagra,11,Tue Jul 21 18:16:40 2015 UTC,"Cogs/Denorfia > Castro right now. I say just move Russel to short, Baez at second and bench Castro."
CHICubs,3e33h1,UNSTABLETON_LIVE,10,Tue Jul 21 19:18:50 2015 UTC,"Castro is essentially a one-tool player: immense yet erratic contact skills. That does not lend well to a consistent career.  Career-wise, he's essentially become a slower, worse defensive Orlando Cabrera.  Offensively, the power has taken a nosedive. He takes league-low walks. He doesn't run bases well or steal bags.   Defensively, he is a near league-leader in errors with a habit of losing focus, even with a great manager.  Any given year going forward, it'll be impossible to predict which Castro shows up. When you can't rely on power, walks, or consistent defense, you never know what you're going to get."
CHICubs,3e33h1,SoonerJDB,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:04:06 2015 UTC,"I hope Baez can figure it out, because I like his baseball IQ better than Castro's right now. He just hasn't turned out to be the player we hoped he would become when he was called up. If he was hitting at least .280 I wouldn't mind him, but because he does everything else so poorly his current number will not cut it longterm."
CHICubs,3e33h1,demerdar,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:32:11 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Castro leads the league in errors since his debut.
CHICubs,3e33h1,LegacyLemur,12,Wed Jul 22 01:34:19 2015 UTC,"Don't sell low, but if Baez produces when he gets back, then Castro can absolutely find a nice warm spot on the bench."
CHICubs,3e33h1,Harrolddilshore,7,Tue Jul 21 16:21:58 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, I think we've come to the point where we have to consider platooning Castro in the infield if his production can't come up."
CHICubs,3e33h1,Baseplate,4,Tue Jul 21 17:11:52 2015 UTC,I want Castro from 2014.
CHICubs,3e33h1,Tjagra,4,Tue Jul 21 21:00:24 2015 UTC,"Or 2012, or 2011, 2010"
CHICubs,3e33h1,achap39,6,Tue Jul 21 23:58:13 2015 UTC,As a Castro hater can I just say: wow this sub has done a complete 180. I would regularly get lambasted for talking about how bad Castro was not very long ago
CHICubs,3e33h1,trapper2530,3,Tue Jul 21 19:41:31 2015 UTC,That is because while he sucked the team was absolute dog shit.  Now the team is better and he has stayed flat.
CHICubs,3e33h1,PeterBernsteinSucks,3,Tue Jul 21 21:59:39 2015 UTC,Well half the season is gone now so small sample size doesn't apply anymore. He just hasn't improved and its getting increasingly annoying.
CHICubs,3e33h1,sethtooley,5,Wed Jul 22 00:33:45 2015 UTC,"He needs to be in the 2-hole or the 9-hole. Nearly 1/3 of all his career ABs have been in that spot in the lineup...and he's hitting .292 when in the 2-hole.   In the 6/7 hole, where he's been all this year? .241.   One of the reasons why every pitcher in this league is going down and away from Castro and not giving him anything to drive is because (a) they know he's a contact guy, not someone who'll take a lot of walks and (b) even if he does draw a walk, no one's scared of David Ross/Tyler Teagarden/Cogs/Denorfia.   You put real hitters behind him, he starts seeing better pitches to hit."
CHICubs,3e33h1,Deanosaurus859,7,Tue Jul 21 18:50:25 2015 UTC,I think 9 hole. 2/3 hole in maddons lineup is your best hitters. Don't want him cloggin up. Bryant and rizzo.
CHICubs,3e33h1,voidecho,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:48:44 2015 UTC,So you swap him with Russell who is a rookie and hitting worse than Castro?  Russell is in the 9 hole so he has hitters behind him and not the catcher and pitcher. His .235 BA might be a lot worse in the 6 hole with nobody behind him and we would be talking about needing to send him down right now.   Castro has to be in the 6 hole because there is no other place to put him and outside of an injury to him and Beaz being back and ready there isn't anyone better. Do you want Castro or Hererra in the lineup every day?
CHICubs,3e33h1,sethtooley,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:11:31 2015 UTC,Thank you! I've said the exact same thing and many here seem to think its not a good idea for some reason
CHICubs,3e33h1,inevitablescape,3,Tue Jul 21 19:02:46 2015 UTC,"The thing is, yes the BA is quite similar, but the XBH and RBI's just are too much for you to legitimately say they had similar production."
CHICubs,3e33h1,thats_wassup,6,Tue Jul 21 16:26:46 2015 UTC,"RBI's are a product of where Castro hits in the lineup.  Guarantee he had way more opportunities with RISP during those games above than Barney.  Same goes for XBH.  OP listed games, but should have used AB's for comparison as Castro averaged way more AB's per game.  Castro had almost 3X more AB's in those 161 games than Barney did in 94 games.  Take Barney's 16 XBH's times three and you've got 48, which is more than Castro's 46."
CHICubs,3e33h1,Dhash23,2,Tue Jul 21 16:58:15 2015 UTC,"You're right, I should have used AB instead of games, I'll edit it now."

CHICubs,3e33h1,maxelrod,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:44:07 2015 UTC,"Castro has definitely been subpar, but this is a slightly unfair comparison as Barney is a 2B.  He's only played 22 games as a SS in his career."
CHICubs,3e33h1,StewartDuck,-3,Wed Jul 22 00:36:05 2015 UTC,"Jesus Christ everyone on this sub should be a fucking GM or scout. Anyone can go on fan graphs and spit numbers out. What's everyone solution? Trade him? Congratulations, you have successfully dealt away a 25 year old whose a 3 time all star for maybe a year rental player. Castro is under the biggest fucking microscope this year and the circle jerk of hating him is so old. Why doesn't Castro get a break ever? He's been hustling and making good plays and he's still making contact. His defense has been fine lately. Everyone needs to give it a fucking rest already. Castro has gone 5/38 his last two weeks. You know what Kris Bryant went in those same last two weeks? 5/36. Oh what's that? You're going to go to fan graphs and tell me why Castro xyzWAR is last in the league? Give it a rest people. Anyone whose watched him in years past knows he has what it takes. Bailing on that talent just because it's not here right now is dumb.   /Rant (not directed towards anyone specific but in general)   Edit: Out of serious curiosity does anyone actually like/defend Castro? I understand that 98% of everyone here hates him."
CHICubs,3e33h1,Dhash23,11,Tue Jul 21 18:28:00 2015 UTC,"How is your post any better? You use no actual stats other than comparing him to Bryant purely bases on batting average.  You don't have to be a GM or a Scout to know that him being a three time all star doesn't mean a damn thing. He doesn't ever get a break because he starts every single game and so far this year has provided a negative value to the team. If you don't want to look at advanced stats, thats fine, but making fun of them or people that use them just makes you look petty.  I also don't agree with you that watching him in years past means you think he has what it takes. Watching him this past year makes me think he is incapable of making adjustments at the plate, and that he is a high contact hitter who will rely purely on a high babip in order to be productive.   I don't have a solution for the Cubs SS position. But I don't think your post basically telling everyone that hes fine and to shut up if you think otherwise is any better than people complaining about Castro.  He has been one of the worst SS in the league this year based on numbers. Should everyone just ignore that because you believe he has the ability to turn it around at some point? When will that be?"
CHICubs,3e33h1,StewartDuck,-5,Tue Jul 21 18:49:39 2015 UTC,"Everyone here makes it sound like its a complete no brainer that he should not be starting. You should really read how people talk about Castro as if he's the one giving up HR's when we have the lead. I'm not trying to compare him to Bryant at all but show people that they need to chill out on Castro because our offensive struggles don't solely rely on his shoulders.   People talk as if he's 33 years old with an insane contract. It's so easy to just bash him like a dead horse. We know the offense is struggling. To blame all of it on him (which is where my frustration is coming from) makes everyone sound ridiculous. You yourself say he's incapable of making an adjustment at the plate, how would past numbers this year justify that point? Just because he's been sub average this year and in a slump doesn't mean he can't make an adjustment at the plate and go on a tear the second half of the year.   Also, to say being an all star means nothing just to make your point makes you sound like a petty fan."
CHICubs,3e33h1,YourCummyBear,4,Tue Jul 21 19:34:34 2015 UTC,"I've been a Castro fan his whole career. His lack of hustle has always bugged me but I've still always been a fan. But as of now he is too detrimental to a contending team to keep in the lineup. We have no better options at the moment, but when Baez makes it back to the majors, or when TLS gets healthy, it's time for Castro to go to the bench.  Castro's one of the most talented contact hitters in the league, but when he's this bad for this long and our team is contending, he needs to grab some bench until he figures his shit out."
CHICubs,3e33h1,Dhash23,8,Tue Jul 21 22:23:01 2015 UTC,Im with you on not blaming him for all the losses or the offense etc...I just didn't like the way you bashed people for using advanced metrics.  And please explain to me the value of being an all star? Whether they make the all star game or not has nothing to do with their performance on their actual MLB team...So Castro can hit .200 for the next 5 years because he was a 3 time all star?
CHICubs,3e33h1,stackshot,-4,Tue Jul 21 19:41:46 2015 UTC,"I was more annoyed than bashing people who used advanced metrics because I can tell you that I've seen the middle of our lineup all get out with runners on but someone will tell me that Castro has a terrible WAR so let's blame him just gets annoying because what kind of discussion can you have with comments like that?   As for the all star, I think you are twisting my words a little bit. I'm saying he was a 3 time all star so the potential is still there, he's only 25. I'm not saying this gives him a pass to hit .200 the next 5 years since he made 3 all stars since we all want production from here on out. I just feel like people here have actually forgotten what he can do just because of the slump this year."
CHICubs,3e33h1,YourCummyBear,3,Tue Jul 21 19:59:18 2015 UTC,"I think this reply helped me get a little more context on what you originally meant.  I know what you mean about people, especially on twitter. While I might not agree on him turning it around (matter of opinion I suppose) I agree with you that it gets frustrating when everything gets piled on one player and you can't make a comment about anything without it getting related back to that one conversation point."
CHICubs,3e33h1,Dhash23,7,Tue Jul 21 20:08:42 2015 UTC,"HIM BEING AN ALL STAR DOESNT MATTER!!!  Seriously guys. And guess what not everyone here thinks he has what it takes to be more than a 1-2 in player right now.   In his 3 all-star bids his WAR those years was 3.0,3.4,2.1  The average ALL STAR WAR at the end of the year is around 4.5-5.5. It's not like he crushed it those years or anything and 2.1 player is definitely not an all star.  He is 1.1 win player over the last 3 years. Theres a reason advanced metrics have become the norm."
CHICubs,3e33h1,stackshot,-7,Tue Jul 21 20:14:23 2015 UTC,"You post his WAR stats as if they haven't been posted a thousand times already. Everyone gets it, his WAR is shit. If that was the end all be all stat then why even discuss Castro at all?"
CHICubs,3e33h1,Dhash23,4,Tue Jul 21 20:31:27 2015 UTC,This doesn't add to the baseball conversation in the slightest.  You're yelling at people using facts/stats for no good reason.
CHICubs,3e33h1,stackshot,4,Tue Jul 21 22:15:51 2015 UTC,Exactly. It's fine some guys don't like advanced stats.  Doesn't change the fact that castro has bombed so far this year.

There are 0 people who defended Castro."
CHICubs,3e33h1,dhporter,4,Tue Jul 21 22:45:03 2015 UTC,"Castro is one of the least valuable players in mlb this season.  He played similarly in 2013.

No one is defending Castro because he's in the running for Least Valuable Starter in MLB in 2015 and in 2013...which is defended by the stats you're complaining about.  Meaningful stats like OBP, OPS, or WAR are necessary to prove points.  I do not want you to say, ""Fuck Castro"", and it's weird that you're even implying that I want that.   You're flying off the handle on people who have done you no wrong."
CHICubs,3e33h1,MisterxRager,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:21:15 2015 UTC,Flying off the handle implies I'm yelling or genuinely upset. I'm in for having a good discussion. This whole thread turned into a circlejerk about his advanced metrics which isn't a secret. No animosity towards you or any Cubs fans if that's what your implying. I'm just shocked everyone assumes he can not change and will be terrible moving forward. Sorry if I came off as a douche.
CHICubs,3e33h1,Dhash23,10,Tue Jul 21 23:29:38 2015 UTC,He's been hustling   That's news to me.
CHICubs,3e33h1,Harrolddilshore,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:56:39 2015 UTC,Yeah he has been. I don't know if you remember the one game against the mets I think where there were runners on first and third and one out and the game was either tied or they were down one and Castro hit a grounder and beat out the double play so the run could score. This is called hustling.
CHICubs,3e33h1,Dhash23,6,Tue Jul 21 19:19:51 2015 UTC,"Have you forgotten the game a couple weeks ago where he pouted after making an error, which allowed a run to score? He's sucked, and now all he does is pout about how much he sucks instead of making efforts to be better."

CHICubs,3e33h1,Dhash23,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:29:02 2015 UTC,I personally don't see the point on absolutely ripping him a new asshole every day on this sub. It's harder to defend him which I choose to do because he's still only 25 he still has many years ahead of him. Since we've somewhat exceeded expectation this year everyone has gotten greedy as fuck and want to go shitting on everyone who isn't Rizzo or Bryant. It's annoying to come on this sub and see posts and comments about how our players suck and should be traded or benched.   To go with your point though yeah that was a real stupid play. But why only shit on him when we can argue KB's overthrow to first cost us the game where Lester almost no hit the cardinals? You see what I mean? People only want to shit on Castro because it's the norm around here which is where my frustration comes from. He could go on a tear for a few weeks and then go cold for a few days and people would call for his head again.
CHICubs,3e33h1,12picklesmcgee,4,Tue Jul 21 19:47:21 2015 UTC,"I don't like your KB example at all just because single mental mistakes, especially one like Castros, will always be worse than single physical mistakes.

CHICubs,3e33h1,Dhash23,2,Tue Jul 21 19:52:18 2015 UTC,Can't argue with mental mistakes vs physical mistakes. Mental mistakes are absolutely terrible. Trading him or benching him is a huge mistake but that's your opinion.
CHICubs,3e33h1,THEriot2,5,Tue Jul 21 20:03:52 2015 UTC,"If you have to use words ""the one game"" in your argument that a player is hustling you already lost your argument."

CHICubs,3e33h1,Tjagra,3,Tue Jul 21 20:22:01 2015 UTC,"Why doesn't Castro get a break ever?   Because he's hasn't been a good baseball player all-star appearances aside, and not just this year.   Anyone whose watched him in years past knows he has what it takes.   Starlin Castro has never been a top 5 SS in the league in an era where SS is a weak position. At worst, he's been among the worst players in the league (that's twice now, and over the past 3 years - 1600 plate appearances). Yet, we act like he's some sort of anointed savior and that his struggles are just a cold streak.   When he's going good, we overrate him (there was a post before this season complaining about his rank in the top SS list or whatever that ESPN put out). When he's going bad, we underrate him and act like anything is a better option. We should probably just realize that he's not that good, and at worst, will make you pull your hair out, but we likely don't have a better option. Anyone acting like Baez is the answer and will step in, after a wrist injury of all things, and light the world on fire is misguided and has a poor memory."

CHICubs,3e33h1,StewartDuck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:45:27 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, rest of this year AT LEAST."
CHICubs,3e33h1,SwedishLovePump,0,Tue Jul 21 21:25:22 2015 UTC,I have a solution guys. We call up Gleyber Torres.
CHICubs,3e33h1,StewartDuck,3,Tue Jul 21 19:19:06 2015 UTC,"That's what Jim Hendry would've done, and possibly why its to blame why Castro is in the current predicament. Castro had only 26 games in AA before getting called up. Yes he was crushing AA, but still he perhaps would have developed more with more time in the minors."
CHICubs,3e3b2r,voidecho,7,Tue Jul 21 17:07:07 2015 UTC,It's good to see those 7 walks over that span.  I don't know if he tried to do too much coming into a contract year and sold out for power more often but he just really needs to get back on his game.  Getting a .350 OBP out of the leadoff spot will go a LONG way to making up the 8 games we are back.
CHICubs,3e3b2r,friendly-confines,4,Tue Jul 21 17:38:02 2015 UTC,"He certainly struggled, but he's been fucked over by the umps a built more than average this year too.  Cool to see Ross stick up for him yesterday."
CHICubs,3e3b2r,Den1mChiken,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:40:11 2015 UTC,"He clearly wants to be a power hitter, and who wouldn't? But, yes he needs to stick to what he does well, which is make contact, draw walks and get on base."
CHICubs,3e3b2r,Jollyman21,3,Wed Jul 22 01:54:27 2015 UTC,Soon enough It's all gonna click but we have 3 guys who have just started seeing major league pitching. another hasn't had a full season.   I'm still waiting for Starlin to have a huge game. He's a .280 career hitter and he's so fucking due for a streak
CHICubs,3e3b2r,cubfanbudman2015,0,Tue Jul 21 17:13:13 2015 UTC,He was an all-star in 2014  There's no telling what Castro is going to do
CHICubs,3e3b2r,SwedishLovePump,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:43:40 2015 UTC,"Not to be a debbie downer, but 5 of his 7 hits were against lefties, who he has hit well all season.   He's .212/.304/.361 vs righties as opposed to .324/.388/.394 against lefties."
CHICubs,3e3b2r,NicCage420,3,Tue Jul 21 21:25:40 2015 UTC,"Didn't you hear...we've requested to face only lefties the rest of the year.  I think he'll still struggle a bit vs righties in BA, but if he can work walks and get his OBP up it'll still help."
CHICubs,3e3b2r,SwedishLovePump,3,Tue Jul 21 17:35:14 2015 UTC,There's a pretty strong argument at this point that Fowler should give up on switch hitting and just go righty at all times.
CHICubs,3e3b2r,NicCage420,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:37:37 2015 UTC,I'd agree with that. I think the cubs should look into trading for Ben Revere (.315/.353/.405 vs righties) or Charlie Blackmon (.314/.388/.516) to platoon with Fowler.
CHICubs,3e3b2r,SwedishLovePump,2,Tue Jul 21 19:16:48 2015 UTC,"Revere might cost more than he should just because the Phillies have so few actual trade chips left, and Blackmon's been awful away from Coors Field (career .246/.287/.382 hitter on the road)."
CHICubs,3e3b2r,NicCage420,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:20:42 2015 UTC,"Based on Revere's (alleged) price here I think he's worth looking into, at least. The youth and team control is nice.  And Blackmon hits .262/.348/.500 against righties away from Coors, which is all he'd face, in theory. Those numbers are still a nice upgrade from Fowler."
CHICubs,3e3b2r,uhhhhmmmm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:29:38 2015 UTC,"If it's just someone of Gott's caliber it's a great move.  While Blackmon's numbers vs RHP are an upgrade over Fowler, the potential cost scares me."

CHICubs,3e587l,Meazles,2,Wed Jul 22 01:30:13 2015 UTC,"David Price... the one that got away. The best player (IMO) to come out of a stacked 2007 draft. You'll remember that as the one where the Cubs picked 3rd and selected Josh Vitters. If you dont remember its because Vitters never got a refill on that cup of coffee the Cubs gave him in the bigs.  Price went 1st, Moustakas 2nd, Vitters 3rd to the Cubs, some dude at 4th, and Wieters 5th. If we're talking draft roulette the Cubs lost.  Price went on to be the pitcher that Prior was supposed to be. The polished college pitcher that gets called up quickly (Price was up within 13 months of signing with the Rays) and helps with a stretch run. Price has been a pitching machine in all of the right ways for every team he's played for. He throws hard, knows the zone and is consistent. He's also a good teammate by all accounts.  Theo and Jed need to Quantum Leap this one, making right what once went wrong, by signing Price. Please gentleman, bring me closure for that awful awful draft.   Edit: Others from that draft's first round include Bumgarner, Heyward, Mesoroco and Porcello. The supplemental round had the likes of Todd Frazier, d'Arnaud, and some guy the Cubs took named Josh Donaldson. Yes, that Donaldson. He was traded a year later."
CHICubs,3e587l,RyanTheCubsSTH,2,Wed Jul 22 01:37:41 2015 UTC,"If he finishes the season strong, he is getting PAID. He's got more credentials than Max Scherzer. Maybe some team is offering him $230M/8 but the Cubs will only do $190M/7. I think the Cubs and Price want each other, but the Cubs still have boundaries and some teams have mondo TV deals. It could come down to Price needing to take a discount to land with the Cubs."
CHICubs,3e587l,JohnnyWaffleseed,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:38:50 2015 UTC,"You would assume that the usual suspects of the Dodgers, Yankees, and Red Sox would be in the mix. Other teams might include the Blue Jays, Tigers (if they don't trade him), Angels, and the Cardinals (ugh). Honestly the biggest factor in his decision is going to be years and money. The Cubs should have a bit of an advantage because of Maddon, young core, and that Price has expressed interest in here before -but when it comes down to it $$$ is the most important thing. If someone like the Yankees or Dodgers are willing to go like $260 Million or something ridiculous like that then the Cubs might pass and go for another one of the good pitchers that should be available."

I wanted them to win it in 2005 because I liked players like Thomas and Konerko and also because they were playing a division rival in the Astros. But as time went on, I just grew increasingly angry with how obnoxious Sox fans acted in their attitudes towards the Cubs, especially the past 5 years when the Cubs were nothing special and it just added insult to injury. I'm now in a limbo, sometimes rooting for the Sox and sometimes glad they lose and are a sub-.500 team. Problem is if when the Cubs win they'll probably say, ""Oh, well you guys still went 100 years without a WS!"" which will drive me up a wall. It's so dumb and I wish they would just worry about their own team so I can maybe find it in my heart to root for the Sox except when they're playing the Cubs."

CHICubs,3dyuyb,Trakis,11,Mon Jul 20 17:26:03 2015 UTC,"This is actually a remarkable turnaround in his success against lefties in a relatively short period of time. Just two seasons ago:  http://www.fangraphs.com/fantasy/what-to-make-of-anthony-rizzo/  As one would expect, the answers are intimately related. They both center around his inability to handle left-handed pitching. In 2013, Rizzo hit .189/.282/.342 against southpaws and a more robust .252/.342/.454 against righties, and 16 of his 23 home runs came against right-handed pitchers. It’s important to note Rizzo suffered from a .207 BABIP against lefties; however, I’d argue the low BABIP was partially due to increased weak contact, which can be seen by his 15.3% infield fly ball rate against lefties (more than double his 7.3% against righties).  Furthermore, his struggles against left-handed pitching appears to be becoming a trend. Even in his impressive 2012 campaign, Rizzo only posted a .208/.243/.356 slash line against lefties. He continued to crush righties (.386 wOBA) and 11 of his 15 home runs came against righties, which is once again similar to his 2013 story. The difference in performance level between the two years was simply the fact that he demolished righties more in 2012 than he did in 2013 — and perhaps much of that is BABIP-related (.280 BABIP in 2013 and .348 BABIP in 2012).  Some analysts in this space have focused on his increased walk rate, decreased swinging-strike rate and his improved plate discipline. They have argued these are positive signs and could be harbingers for improvement heading into 2014, and they’re obviously correct that those improved metrics should be celebrated. However, until Rizzo proves that he can handle left-handed pitching at the big-league level — something he hasn’t shown in 1000+ plate appearances — his ultimate upside will be extremely limited."

Also-in this one, do you think your camera is so fast that it has captured the baseball genuinely deformed by the bat, or is it an artifact of fast motion?

CHICubs,3e0up3,dybuell,3,Tue Jul 21 16:20:30 2015 UTC,"That is so cool. So, you were pretty obviously in the dugout or very close to it during the game - did you actually hang out in there with the players? Or were you required to stay in that small press section right next to it during the game?"

CHICubs,3e0up3,getdatgoat,7,Tue Jul 21 03:47:24 2015 UTC,Can't give up home runs in this ballpark and not get a few of your own.  Let's just take the next three and get to ten over!

CHICubs,3e0up3,ViaChicago3441,4,Tue Jul 21 02:38:32 2015 UTC,"Maddon really needed to have Herrera bunt in the 8th in order to get Coghlan home. You absolutely need to get that run home in that scenario with the knowledge that Chapman is closing. Herrera is also a decent bunter and does not hit that well. (yes, i know he had a big hit yesterday, but overall he isn't that great)"
CHICubs,3e0up3,jjjjrshabadoo,4,Tue Jul 21 02:50:16 2015 UTC,I think he's a good bench player he's batting .264
CHICubs,3e0up3,Baybears,3,Tue Jul 21 02:56:51 2015 UTC,He has a .286 OBP / .625 OPS.  He's a bench player. That's not better or worse than any other bench player.  It's what a bench player does.
CHICubs,3e0up3,stackshot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:51:18 2015 UTC,"that is pretty decent, but my point is that it's not like if you took the bat out of rizzo's or bryant's hands. Herrera doesn't hit for power"
CHICubs,3e0up3,jjjjrshabadoo,8,Tue Jul 21 03:02:39 2015 UTC,I know we all want a 5th starter but are their any good veteran bats on the market?  Because we have to be one of the worst teams in baseball at leaving runners stranded. 5 walks and 9 men left on baseball is just terrible.
CHICubs,3e0up3,YourCummyBear,8,Tue Jul 21 02:24:43 2015 UTC,"3 of those was on a screaming liner by Schwarber that was 109 mph off the bat. I agree it's been a problem this season, but this game really wasn't that bad. A lot of hard contact right at people or at the wall.   Also, there's the Brandon Phillips ridiculousness (that's another 2 stranded)."
CHICubs,3e0up3,SoonerJDB,3,Tue Jul 21 02:26:36 2015 UTC,Yea but it's not just today ya know? It's been all year. I'm just saying to me it's a huge cause for concern if we want to make a run.  I want Bautista! But seriously who is on the market?
CHICubs,3e0up3,YourCummyBear,13,Tue Jul 21 02:28:58 2015 UTC,"Who are you replacing in our lineup? Not Rizzo, obviously. Not Bryant, Schwarber, Russell or Soler, they're our future. Fowler has been disappointing, but his career (and the last week) tells us he'll likely turn it around.   That leaves our left field platoon and Castro. Castro may be replaced but it will come from within (Baez taking 2nd and Russell moving over). Coghlan/Norf have combined to be our 3rd best hitter.   I agree that our bench needs help. A lot of help. I'm just not on board with bringing in a starter."
CHICubs,3e0up3,SoonerJDB,-3,Tue Jul 21 02:37:56 2015 UTC,"Baez is not going to help very much with the problem we have. We need Tommy Lastella to come back so Russell can move to short. Castro should be sent down to minors to work out of this funk and get his confidence back IMO. If Lastella is still a ways away we can trade for zobrist who is versatile and can play left, second or even center field if need be"
CHICubs,3e0up3,TandBusquets,2,Tue Jul 21 03:34:00 2015 UTC,Castro can't be sent down to the minors without being put on waivers. He's out of option years.

CHICubs,3e0up3,TandBusquets,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:16:41 2015 UTC,I wouldn't like that idea anyway. Castro has been very bad offensively so far this year. But I trust his career stats more than I trust half a season's worth. We don't have another major league short stop in the system. We're in contention. We need him.
CHICubs,3e0up3,HotYoungTeen,3,Tue Jul 21 05:23:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think its something that can be ignored. We need to be proactive about this. If and when lastella came back Russell would play SS and Lastella would play second.   I doubt lastella could perform worse than Castro this season.  I just don't know how else Castro can go back to his old self otherwise. The padres sent down Jedd gyorko because he was going through a rough patch and he has come back looking much better. I'm just saying, it can't hurt."

CHICubs,3e0up3,Aaaaaagh,2,Tue Jul 21 04:27:19 2015 UTC,The reason id gamble on tulo is that when on he is bar non the best SS in baseball. With his injury history and contract he wouldn't cost the haul one may think he would.  Id go as far as to say he would challenge rizzo as our best hitter and our lineup would become so elite. But getting him and Blackmon would cost the farm.

CHICubs,3e1ixx,jcftw61,2,Tue Jul 21 18:10:03 2015 UTC,Every contender in baseball would outbid that trade for Price and Cespedes.

And what's wrong with the Kipnis offer other than he dared to mention trading anyone who's been anointed a savior (we have lie 15 of those now)? Castro and Almora's values are low currently and Schwarber is awesome, but far from a sure thing (edit: not to mention that his value is less to the Indians than most because of Yan Gomes) whereas Kipnis has a track record, a good one at that, and is putting him his best season yet. He's reasonably locked up through his prime and not a second further. He's clearly the most valuable player in that deal. The Indians would not be unreasonable to turn the trade down."
CHICubs,3e1ixx,friendly-confines,2,Tue Jul 21 17:38:52 2015 UTC,"Thankfully baseball teams aren't human bodies and are quite capable of having numerous cancers while performing very well.  Whenever anyone mentions cancers or clubhouse chemistry or whatever the hell else, I remember the 2003 and 2011 Red Sox.  By all accounts, the clubhouse was the same both years and it was the key to success in one and the key to failure in the other."
CHICubs,3e1ixx,THEriot2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:55:55 2015 UTC,It's all a load of shit anyways. Puig is the victim of a made up reputation just like Castro. The difference is Puig was in for way more of a culture shock than Castro. Calling him a cancer is just subscribing to a lazy narrative created and perpetuated by grumpy old-men stuck decades in the past.

Three very young and very promising talents at premium positions -granted Schwarber may not stick at catcher- one of which has some history of success at the ML level PLUS 15 million? So, the Indians get three good to great players (we'll see how that plays out, of course) plus salary relief and the Cubs get a 28 year old 2nd baseman (also granted - very good one)?  The Indians say yes, yes please, no take backs."
CHICubs,3e1ixx,funkydalilama,0,Tue Jul 21 17:48:41 2015 UTC,"Three very young and very promising talents   One guy putting up a season that should have him in the MVP discussion. Who is locked up through the rest of his prime, and not a day further.   granted Schwarber may not stick at catcher   The Indians wouldn't bother given the fact that they have Yan Gomes so there goes a ton of his value.   one of which has some history of success at the ML level    And is currently one of the worst players in the league for the 2nd of 3 years, and whose value has never been lower than maybe 2013.   PLUS 15 million   Which is nothing in player assets. That's not even one-half of Yoan Moncada.   So, the Indians get three good to great players   Lol...the Indians get 3 huge question marks. The small question mark is the guy with 34 ML plate appearances.    28 year old 2nd baseman (also granted - very good one   Almora, Castro, and Schwarber are ""good to great"". Kipnis is ""granted, very good"". Jesus Christo.   The Indians say yes, yes please, no take backs   No, they don't. The Indians have a rational evaluation of our players."
CHICubs,3e1ixx,THEriot2,0,Tue Jul 21 17:58:51 2015 UTC,"Schwarber would still have value at catcher. No one said he would have to stay with the Indians. Of course, he might be a very useful roster piece as a backup catcher /OF/DH on his other days. Castro is only 25. He's approaching what will be his prime and he's been seasoned at the ML level. He's also shown flashes of greatness. He just needs consistency and, possibly, a move off of SS to a less demanding position. When his bat turns around, and it will, his contract is ridiculously team friendly. And Almora is a consensus defensive plus plus (thats two plusses at CF) player with a very real chance of developing into a feared hitter. Plus 15 million.   Sorry, guy. The Cubs say no way."

He's approaching what will be his prime and he's been seasoned at the ML level. He's also shown flashes of greatness.   He has a 9.6 WAR over 5.5 seasons. It could be less by the end of the year.   When his bat turns around, and it will   Is such a ridiculous homer claim considering the fact that he's been a below average hitter, and average at best, over his career, and is trending down. He's having his worst year ever, and second god awful year in 3 years. His trade value is low.   He's also shown flashes of greatness.   He's shown flashes of being a top 5 SS in a very weak SS era. Wait...no that's stretching it. His very best year, you have an argument at top 5, and I wouldn't make that argument.   He just needs consistency   Yeah, if he can just put up his 92 wRC+ consistently then he'd maybe be a league average player.   his contract is ridiculously team friendly.   I'd rather have Kipnis's contract.    Plus 15 million.   I don't get how to iterate any more how inconsequential this year.   Sorry, guy. The Cubs say no way.

CHICubs,3e1ixx,THEriot2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:39:34 2015 UTC,"He's been awesome...this year with some worrisome peripheral stats. But even if he is a 130-140 OPS+ 2B from here until the end of his contract, Castro + Schwarber + Almora + Cash is too much and most of that too much comes from Schwarber.

Except he'll never play C for Cleveland so there goes a ton of his value. And the other is one of the worst players in the league for the 2nd of 3 years.

Today the Cubs are 7 games over .500 and people are pissing themselves with joy at the thought of scooping out a handful of talented prospects for 2-3 months of gratification. Stop it! This is what we've all been waiting for. Sit back. Shut up. Let these kids develop. When the team is an actual contender and not a team that has a chance to play, on the road, in a one game playoff for a chance to make the real playoffs then get excited. 3rd place, 8.5 games back on July 21 is not the time to gut the franchise for a rental player."

I proposed trades for Kipnis and Tulo, who have 5.5 years of control, Puig, who has 3.5 years of control, and Zobrist, who would be the only rental.  BTW the Cardinals have made trades for guys like Jason Heyward, Matt Holliday, and John Lackey, all who had 1 year of control or less."

CHICubs,3e1ixx,THEriot2,3,Tue Jul 21 23:42:39 2015 UTC,"No to Tulo, he just can't be trusted to stay healthy.  I would LOVE to get Puig but wouldn't trade Soler straight up.  I still think Soler is going to be the best out of him, Bryant, Russell and even in a bad, bad year for him, he still has a league average bat and he just destroyed all comers last year after, effectively, not playing for 3 years.  That is way to much for Kipnis.  Schwarber is an untouchable to me and Castro will pull out of the slump.  It's rare that guys who have had multiple years of success at the majors suddenly lose all of their ability to hit a baseball at 25 years old.  I wouldn't be upset if they traded him, though.  Ultimately, I think some sort of Baez for Hamels deal gets close/done and I will be overjoyed."
CHICubs,3e1ixx,THEriot2,2,Tue Jul 21 13:51:49 2015 UTC,"Kipnis has the 3rd highest WAR in baseball, and he's signed to a team friendly deal.  If anything, the Indians probably wouldn't accept that deal."
CHICubs,3e1ixx,sethtooley,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:14:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying he isn't a good ballplayer but he is also having a bit of an outlier year.  This is his best offensive season of his career by a bit and Castro at 4/$36 has a good bit of trade value in and of himself.  Schwarber is a stud prospect, hands down.  The hype-o meter got shortchanged because of Bryant/Russell and the fact that he has only been in the organization for a year.    Realistically, I'd say you're overpaying by trading Schwarber for Kipnis straight up.  The dude put up Kris Bryant numbers in the minors while playing a much more valuable position and many folks didn't want to trade Bryant for Stanton straight up (even before the extension).  I know dumping Castro is the hot button of trade bait but Kipnis should cost far less than Schwarber straight up, let alone including Castro, Almora (who will make a very good 5th OF some day) and a butt-load of cash."
CHICubs,3e1ixx,THEriot2,2,Tue Jul 21 17:48:51 2015 UTC,"Castro at 4/$36 has a good bit of trade value in and of himself.

The hype-o meter got shortchanged because of Bryant/Russell and the fact that he has only been in the organization for a year   The Cubs hype machine is never slowed. Literally no one is as high on Schwarber as the people around this sub. And that's not a knock on him, or how highly people think of him at all.   you're overpaying by trading Schwarber for Kipnis straight up.   I don't even know what to say.   much more valuable position   That holds no (edit: not no, much much less) value to many teams, the Indians being one.   I know dumping Castro is the hot button of trade bait   For some unknown reason...it's not a very good time to trade him.   Kipnis should cost far less than Schwarber straight up   No no no.  Russell > Schwarber  Kipnis > Samardzija  That says it all.   Almora (who will make a very good 5th OF some day)   Or could never make it past AA. We keep writing our guys in as certainties, even though they are the ones with question marks, and then turn around overplay Kipnis's question marks, his peripherals. Sure, at a glance Kipnis seems due for regression (he will regress), but his huge BABIP is not as out of line as it seems giving he's increased his LD% 6% this year after a 2% fall the year before. Batted ball data stabilizes quickly so it's pretty safe to say that this number won't fall too much. And, to be honest, part of it's fall could likely be accompanied by an increase in power (HR/FB down this year)."
CHICubs,3e1ixx,sethtooley,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:18:22 2015 UTC,"We can use a more neutral 3rd party here which is fangraphs trade value rankings.  Jason Kipnis was recently ranked as having the 44th most trade value in baseball by fangraphs.  Schwarber didn't make the list.  There are a lot of prospects who are more highly regarded than Schwarber, and they didn't make the list.  For example, Julio Urias or Miguel Sano are consensus better prospects than Schwarber.  You'd be looking at someone like Addison Russel or Byron Buxton for Kipnis straight up.  Schwarber would start a conversation, but he wouldn't be enough on his own."

This isn't about what's been done, it's about deciding what is going to be done. Trends, context, predictive nature. But, even ignoring that, to put up a .714 OPS, Castro would need to put up an .850 OPS the rest of the way (based on games, not PA). I'm not going to hold my breath.   This year at 28 is the first time that Kipnis has done anything eye opening.   That's just not true. But okay.   Castro hasn't even hit it yet   Yeah, that's the problem. He hasn't hit this year. He hasn't hit in the aggregate the last 3 years. And over his career his bat is below average, even - .314 wOBA, 92 wRC+. Kipnis has been the better hitter, over 1100 less plate appearances granted, .335 wOBA, 115 wRC+   and with the exception of this year, has better numbers that Kipnis.   And 2013, and 2012, and, very very arguably, 2011 with the bat despite Kipnis playing just 30 games.    False conclusions are the reason I wouldn't make this trade   FTFY.  I've laid out other points of my argument in other comments so I'm not going to take the time to do so again, but briefly. Castro is trending downward, Kipnis is trending up. Kipnis's contract is just as good as Castro's. $15 million cash is little in terms of player assets and the Indians have little use for it. Almora and Castro have never had a lower trade value; Kipnis has never had a higher trade value (made Fangraph's top 50, I would have had him a little higher perhaps). Schwarber has diminished value to the Indians because they wouldn't bother with him at catcher because of Yan Gomes. This is negated by the fact that other teams still hold that value, but in the event of a trade, Schwarber immediately plays everyday for the Indians which puts a pretty good halt to his catching wishes. This trade would stillresult in Schwarber immediately losing significant value as soon as he was an Indian.  Edit:   Kipnis is in his prime... Castro hasn't even hit it yet   To argue Castro hasn't hit his prime is faulty. Prime age for position players is 25-30, and this of course varies from player to player based on many things one of which I'll focus on here; playing time. So, we can already see that Castro has entered his prime...and at his worst. In short, this is exacerbated by the fact that his age curve has been possibly pushed up a little bit since he broke in so early. On the other hand, Kipnis joined a little late and you could argue his age curve was pushed back. In this case, I'd prefer to focus on Castro since I don't really think Kipnis has had a ton of change to his. You usually know what you have in a player, regardless of age, after 3,500+ PA. What we have is a high (eratic) contact, low power, low walk hitter who, overall, is pretty average offensively, and a liability on defense. Castro is by no means an elite hitter."
CHICubs,3e1ixx,THEriot2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:02:43 2015 UTC,"I'm exhausted after all that, and frankly no longer have interest.  I would take Castro over Kipnis... you would not.  Agree to disagree.  I don't think Castro is going anywhere this season, so lets see how it plays out.  If prime age is 25-30 than Castro just hit it, so who's to say he doesn't pop off just like Kipnis did this year."
CHICubs,3e1ixx,0mousedog,2,Tue Jul 21 21:24:28 2015 UTC,"No to Tulo, he just can't be trusted to stay healthy   But he's usually still worth every penny he's paid, even with injuries."

CHICubs,3e0vor,Sparx7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:30:03 2015 UTC,"He shouldn't scare you. Hamels is an ace. He has started 30+ games in every season except for his first 2 (23, 28 starts). I wouldn't give him a MAJOR piece in return since his FIP and WHIP are on the higher side, but he is worth it.  Also he is under control until 2018 with 2019 team option."

CHICubs,3e0vor,0mousedog,8,Wed Jul 22 00:43:55 2015 UTC,I hope he gets traded so that the Cubs won't have to give up a draft pick when they sign him this winter.

CHICubs,3e0vor,Sparx7,0,Tue Jul 21 12:42:48 2015 UTC,That's pretty interesting. Though I see someone giving up a ton if price is moved.
CHICubs,3e0vor,THEriot2,2,Tue Jul 21 13:23:32 2015 UTC,I mean its tough to gage the market I think theres a lot of pitching out there with Price and Cueto on the market.  The cubs and Astros can probably put together the best packages
CHICubs,3e0vor,Sparx7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:27:45 2015 UTC,"And hamels! 3 aces on the market.  I think everyone is expecting it to be like a top 3 cubs spec needed but if the tigers really don't think they can keep price I suspect something more like  Cj Edwards, mckinnley, vogelbach and Jimenez."

CHICubs,3e0vor,YourCummyBear,3,Tue Jul 21 15:24:28 2015 UTC,you  can't really compare the hawks and the cubs at this point

CHICubs,3e0vor,YourCummyBear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:23:08 2015 UTC,"I would give one of those guys, and not Edwards or Jiminez.  We're not supposed to compete this year. Let's not cripple our chances in the years we're supposed to."

In baseball once you hit the post season it's anyone's game.   And as far as crippling our system. Dealing Edwards, Jimenez and Vogey is nothing, it's likely the latter two never even would have spots on our big league roster. And Edwards is looking like a solid reliever but david freaking price is a top 15 pitcher in baseball in his prime. We gotta eventually deal some of our currency."

CHICubs,3e0vor,Stommped,3,Tue Jul 21 14:53:44 2015 UTC,Cespedes can play center
CHICubs,3e0vor,Sparx7,3,Tue Jul 21 15:18:29 2015 UTC,"I've been opposed to trading for a big name for the most part this season, but for Price I'd be okay with it (depending on Price's price, of course). He sounds like he really wants to be in Chicago, and this would give the Cubs more time to negotiate an extension and remind Price how awesome Maddon is."
CHICubs,3e0vor,jmr33090,3,Tue Jul 21 14:40:31 2015 UTC,"Man I know everyone is focused on Price, but just imagine what having Cespedes added to our batting order could do.   It's likely they'd want way more than we're willing to give up, but still..."
CHICubs,3e0vor,blyzo,3,Tue Jul 21 05:37:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's worth trading for. His last two years have been approximately average offense and this year he's doing better, but posting a career high babip and career low walk rate."
CHICubs,3e0vor,thetwaddler,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:30:48 2015 UTC,Completely agree.  He's more likely to play worse in the second half than play the same.
CHICubs,3e0vor,THEriot2,0,Tue Jul 21 13:22:15 2015 UTC,Agreed. Cespedes would be a good addition to boost our offense.

CHICubs,3e0vor,Sparx7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:19:55 2015 UTC,They can try but it doesn't mean that Price will sign it.  Sure they have more time to negotiate but some people are all about the money

CHICubs,3e0vor,los_pollos-hermanos,2,Tue Jul 21 15:19:30 2015 UTC,Not baseball but Randall Cobb was offered more from other teams but stayed with the Packers because he wants to win.
CHICubs,3e0vor,Loop_Within_A_Loop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:47:32 2015 UTC,that was money too. He realized he could get a giant contract at the end of the one he's got because he'll have Rodgers throwing to him and therefore put up higher numbers.  In the long run it was probably the better move provided he stays healthy and keeps producing.
CHICubs,3e0vor,los_pollos-hermanos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:09:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah that is true, I'm sure he learned from Jennings and how valuable it is to have an ace QB throwing to ya."

CHICubs,3e0vor,Loop_Within_A_Loop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:34:20 2015 UTC,Well we also would likely get to keep our first round pick and the fact that we are in a playoff run right now. Don't get me wrong we have a stacked farm but those guys are currency too. We can't play them all.
CHICubs,3e0vor,YourCummyBear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:10:58 2015 UTC,"You're right we can't play them all, but usually you want to get return for longer than 3 months."

There are no guarantees on sports. You're one injury away from not contending next year.
CHICubs,3e0vor,finchdog,-3,Tue Jul 21 11:13:54 2015 UTC,"Because it gives us a solid arm. Why WOULDN'T they want to? Especially if they think they can contend. If DET wants the farm for Price, then no they shouldn't. But getting Price would be huge."
CHICubs,3e0vor,cgiall420,-2,Tue Jul 21 02:54:27 2015 UTC,There is no guarantee that he signs with the Cubs in the off-season since he is probably going to get north of 150 million. Trading for him would solidify our rotation.

CHICubs,3dzi98,Rearden_Steel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:29:29 2015 UTC,So he only comes in when the Reds are winning? Why can't he come in and do that when they are losing?
CHICubs,3dzi98,HoraceDerwent,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:31:39 2015 UTC,"He's a ""closer"". He comes in in the 9th inning (typically) when his team is winning by 3 or less. If he gets out of the 9th inning without giving up the tying or winning run, he earns a ""save"".   That's his role, and every closers role in baseball. Finish the game, earn a save. He's one of, if not the best in baseball in this role."
CHICubs,3dzi98,lacedaimon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:46:00 2015 UTC,I would say top 3 in relievers

CHICubs,3dzi98,HoraceDerwent,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:29:51 2015 UTC,Here are Chapman's stats. He is the fastest person in baseball to reach 500 strikeouts.                            I would say Wade Davis is better though. Just look at the last two years of his stats (last year and this year). An ERA of 1.00 over 72 innings is just insane

CHICubs,3dzi98,achap39,2,Tue Jul 21 02:11:31 2015 UTC,YES!  Way to get out of that!
CHICubs,3dzi98,snowcone_wars,3,Tue Jul 21 02:11:28 2015 UTC,One good thing about this inning is that Chapman seems like he's been warming up way too long
CHICubs,3dzi98,nlmuvaney,3,Tue Jul 21 02:11:19 2015 UTC,I'm going to post this because it can't do anything but good.
CHICubs,3dzi98,TugboatThomas,3,Tue Jul 21 02:11:19 2015 UTC,veteran out right there.  very nice.
CHICubs,3dzi98,Trakis,2,Tue Jul 21 02:10:32 2015 UTC,Is Soriano hurt? Velocity is down.
CHICubs,3dzi98,cubswinagain,4,Tue Jul 21 02:07:21 2015 UTC,This is exactly how he pitched for us last year.
CHICubs,3dzi98,youthdecay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:11:07 2015 UTC,That's discomforting.
CHICubs,3dzi98,cubswinagain,3,Tue Jul 21 02:13:17 2015 UTC,He's out of shape.

CHICubs,3dzi98,ViaChicago3441,-4,Tue Jul 21 02:05:29 2015 UTC,How much did Theo sign him for? Jesus christ.
CHICubs,3dzi98,zoom258sy,5,Tue Jul 21 02:05:28 2015 UTC,"He's been injured for the entire year, and was just a year ago a quality closer.  A bit early to just write him off."
CHICubs,3dzi98,snowcone_wars,3,Tue Jul 21 02:06:57 2015 UTC,He has not been injured. But yes it is still early.
CHICubs,3dzi98,zoom258sy,5,Tue Jul 21 02:09:15 2015 UTC,SORIANO DIDN'T GET THE MEMO ABOUT SPEEDING UP THE GAME
CHICubs,3dzi98,TugboatThomas,3,Tue Jul 21 02:03:22 2015 UTC,Soriano is just floating it up there. Yikes
CHICubs,3dzi98,zoom258sy,5,Tue Jul 21 02:02:58 2015 UTC,rally bucket flair is up.  lez go.

CHICubs,3dzi98,Sparx7,3,Tue Jul 21 02:05:35 2015 UTC,Chapman's up in the bullpen.
CHICubs,3dzi98,achap39,5,Tue Jul 21 02:06:02 2015 UTC,Get off reddit while you're in the bullpen and quit using third person.
CHICubs,3dzi98,ViaChicago3441,4,Tue Jul 21 02:08:03 2015 UTC,"Well, Soriano's Cubs career is off to a dubious start."
CHICubs,3dzi98,achap39,-1,Tue Jul 21 02:01:20 2015 UTC,Clayton Richard is bad.
CHICubs,3dzi98,jp611,3,Tue Jul 21 02:00:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hate when a #5 starter gives up 3 ER in 5.2 IP and gives the team a chance to win, especially leaving with the lead. /s"
CHICubs,3dzi98,achap39,3,Tue Jul 21 02:03:00 2015 UTC,Chapman   Welp.
CHICubs,3dzi98,cubswinagain,6,Tue Jul 21 02:00:55 2015 UTC,"FASTER THEY COME IN, FASTER THEY GO OUT"
CHICubs,3dzi98,TugboatThomas,5,Tue Jul 21 02:01:54 2015 UTC,Why is Aroldis warming up... Shouldn't he be tired?
CHICubs,3dzi98,jwoody27,4,Tue Jul 21 02:00:38 2015 UTC,Their manager probably plans on either getting fired or trading him.. he's gonna ruin his arm if he keeps working him like this.
CHICubs,3dzi98,prettymotherfcker,4,Tue Jul 21 02:02:11 2015 UTC,It's pretty much expected that they will trade him but are they trying to kill his arm?
CHICubs,3dzi98,jwoody27,3,Tue Jul 21 02:03:24 2015 UTC,"I doubt if they are doing it maliciously but he threw 44 pitches last night, probably well over half of them were 100 mph+ fastballs. An arm can't sustain that kind of workload too often"
CHICubs,3dzi98,prettymotherfcker,4,Tue Jul 21 02:10:22 2015 UTC,Chapman gonna be off his game tonight.
CHICubs,3dzi98,ViaChicago3441,4,Tue Jul 21 02:00:24 2015 UTC,Rally Bucket Engaged
CHICubs,3dzi98,Nexhume,4,Tue Jul 21 02:00:13 2015 UTC,Holy shit....Chapman's going to come in?!?
CHICubs,3dzi98,achap39,3,Tue Jul 21 02:00:06 2015 UTC,Lol strikezone?  What is that?
CHICubs,3dzi98,snowcone_wars,3,Tue Jul 21 01:59:54 2015 UTC,Schwarbers going to have fun catching these pitches.  Lots of movement.
CHICubs,3dzi98,voidecho,4,Tue Jul 21 01:59:40 2015 UTC,My first flair here... so why is it a rally bucket? What's the story?
CHICubs,3dzi98,my_dog_is_cool,3,Tue Jul 21 01:58:53 2015 UTC,Herrera will but a bubble gum bucket on his head in rally situations. Or just for shits and giggles.
CHICubs,3dzi98,OdellLindenbolt,4,Tue Jul 21 02:00:09 2015 UTC,Look for Herrera in the dugout next inning
CHICubs,3dzi98,prettymotherfcker,4,Tue Jul 21 01:59:33 2015 UTC,"BIG BOYS COMING UP IN THE NINTH, UNTIL THEN RALLY FLAIR THE PITCHING STAFF BITCHES"
CHICubs,3dzi98,TugboatThomas,2,Tue Jul 21 01:58:04 2015 UTC,Hope we see Soriano this inning.
CHICubs,3dzi98,cubswinagain,3,Tue Jul 21 01:57:49 2015 UTC,"Put the buckets on boys! This ones not over. Got the meat of the lineup in the ninth, lets get there only down one."

CHICubs,3dzi98,iam2eeyore,4,Tue Jul 21 01:54:53 2015 UTC,Two good cuts there
CHICubs,3dzi98,Addison_and_Clark,4,Tue Jul 21 01:54:35 2015 UTC,RALLY FLAIR
CHICubs,3dzi98,TugboatThomas,2,Tue Jul 21 01:54:10 2015 UTC,I think rally flair is an interesting concept...everyone changes their flair to the buckets when looking for a rally

CHICubs,3dzi98,NotreDameFootball,3,Tue Jul 21 01:51:22 2015 UTC,Cmon Herrera!  Let's do it again!  Edit :(
CHICubs,3dzi98,snowcone_wars,2,Tue Jul 21 01:51:12 2015 UTC,Bucket head! You can do it!

CHICubs,3dzi98,Trakis,3,Tue Jul 21 01:49:40 2015 UTC,What a big start to the inning from Cog.

CHICubs,3dzi98,cubswinagain,5,Tue Jul 21 01:48:52 2015 UTC,WTF was that angle (or lack thereof)?
CHICubs,3dzi98,NotreDameFootball,4,Tue Jul 21 01:48:51 2015 UTC,i think that was the obvious foul ball don't even watch angle
CHICubs,3dzi98,yusuf69,2,Tue Jul 21 01:49:28 2015 UTC,It was a pleasant suprise

CHICubs,3dzi98,zdruck07,3,Tue Jul 21 01:45:45 2015 UTC,Sigh of relief
CHICubs,3dzi98,bgreene777,3,Tue Jul 21 01:45:37 2015 UTC,does schwarber have nail polish or something on his right hand? if so are they hazing him or is it so the pitchers can see the signs better? i hope its hazing cuz that would be funny
CHICubs,3dzi98,dshribes7,2,Tue Jul 21 01:45:35 2015 UTC,Every catcher wears nail polish.
CHICubs,3dzi98,FxStryker,2,Tue Jul 21 01:47:12 2015 UTC,I've never noticed it before
CHICubs,3dzi98,dshribes7,3,Tue Jul 21 01:48:23 2015 UTC,A lot of catchers have nail polish on.
CHICubs,3dzi98,jwoody27,3,Tue Jul 21 01:46:20 2015 UTC,Yeah a lot of catchers do it.
CHICubs,3dzi98,Atticusbird44,3,Tue Jul 21 01:46:19 2015 UTC,A lot of catchers do that for visibility.
CHICubs,3dzi98,voidecho,3,Tue Jul 21 01:46:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah they looked super yellow, I'm sure it helps visibility"
CHICubs,3dzi98,my_dog_is_cool,3,Tue Jul 21 01:46:10 2015 UTC,a lot of catchers have tape on their fingertips to see signs better
CHICubs,3dzi98,NewArithmetic,2,Tue Jul 21 01:46:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, probably to see the signs better. Lots of catchers do this or use tape."
CHICubs,3dzi98,RyanTheCubsSTH,2,Tue Jul 21 01:46:04 2015 UTC,"Man, the camera angle on the Cubs broadcast really makes those outside pitches look closer than they are."
CHICubs,3dzi98,voidecho,2,Tue Jul 21 01:45:29 2015 UTC,Reds broadcast makes it look like they're in the other batters box
CHICubs,3dzi98,cooter410,2,Tue Jul 21 01:47:21 2015 UTC,YES!!!! Momentum's swung back!!
CHICubs,3dzi98,achap39,2,Tue Jul 21 01:45:27 2015 UTC,Good stuff from Travis Wood!
CHICubs,3dzi98,NewArithmetic,3,Tue Jul 21 01:45:27 2015 UTC,Travis Wood and that sweet kentucky waterfall
CHICubs,3dzi98,RyanTheCubsSTH,3,Tue Jul 21 01:44:10 2015 UTC,Lets go Travis
CHICubs,3dzi98,TugboatThomas,5,Tue Jul 21 01:42:19 2015 UTC,"Just pitch to Hamilton, he can't hit. Just keep him off the paths for free.  edit: thats what I'm talking about."
CHICubs,3dzi98,TugboatThomas,2,Tue Jul 21 01:41:07 2015 UTC,Thanks Billy!
CHICubs,3dzi98,voidecho,2,Tue Jul 21 01:40:53 2015 UTC,That would've been a strike against soler
CHICubs,3dzi98,prettymotherfcker,2,Tue Jul 21 01:40:12 2015 UTC,Soler has been getting better calls lately.  He was definitely having the plate extended by umps a lot earlier in the year.
CHICubs,3dzi98,voidecho,2,Tue Jul 21 01:42:12 2015 UTC,Isn't Wood a fly ball pitcher? I'm nervous.
CHICubs,3dzi98,taylorkrebs,3,Tue Jul 21 01:38:56 2015 UTC,"I'm new to following the MLB this year, but how are the Reds a losing team so far? Just bad luck? They seem like they have a bunch of good to great players between Bruce/Votto/Frazier/Phillips/Hamilton/Byrd/Chapman."
CHICubs,3dzi98,my_dog_is_cool,3,Tue Jul 21 01:38:20 2015 UTC,Mediocre to bad starting pitching beyond Cueto.  Hamilton and Byrd aren't actually good.  A great closer is still less valuable than a good anything else.
CHICubs,3dzi98,DrunkenSuperman,3,Tue Jul 21 01:44:31 2015 UTC,Byrd Hamilton and Phillips aren't good hitters. Bruce started the season super slow
CHICubs,3dzi98,Sparx7,3,Tue Jul 21 01:41:21 2015 UTC,"Injuries and a mostly bad rotation, I think."
CHICubs,3dzi98,SoonerJDB,9,Tue Jul 21 01:39:37 2015 UTC,Castro taking a little too much heat for knocking down a fucking laser that took a quick hop while playing in...man
CHICubs,3dzi98,L_wigg1325,2,Tue Jul 21 01:36:50 2015 UTC,Now the long man comes in?
CHICubs,3dzi98,iam2eeyore,3,Tue Jul 21 01:36:03 2015 UTC,Lefty-lefty matchup and Russell was used yesterday.   Edit: oops. Didn't realize Hamilton was a switch-hitter.
CHICubs,3dzi98,SoonerJDB,4,Tue Jul 21 01:37:19 2015 UTC,We deserved that after schwarber getting robbed on the lineout to right
CHICubs,3dzi98,NotreDameFootball,6,Tue Jul 21 01:36:01 2015 UTC,At least Russell can field his position!
CHICubs,3dzi98,BoomNasty,5,Tue Jul 21 01:35:19 2015 UTC,Russell is damn fine in the field. I'll be happy to see a Baez-Russell infield if he can make it as a pro
CHICubs,3dzi98,TugboatThomas,7,Tue Jul 21 01:36:34 2015 UTC,Leaving Richard in couldn't have possibly been worse than this.   This message brought to you by Captain Hindsight.
CHICubs,3dzi98,SoonerJDB,5,Tue Jul 21 01:33:57 2015 UTC,I have no idea where the strike zone is
CHICubs,3dzi98,BoomNasty,3,Tue Jul 21 01:33:52 2015 UTC,Do you think there are two different fielders on a field today than Brandon Phillips and Castro hahaha

There are still some great posters over there but it's been damaged by some mods(not the cubs mods) and there are some technical issues that they don't seem to have any interest in fixing.  I still prefer the PSD format but i'm starting to enjoy this place a little more and i prefer the game threads here.
CHICubs,3dyo86,RyanTheCubsSTH,6,Mon Jul 20 21:40:48 2015 UTC,I don't post much but this is my favorite place to discuss the Cubs now for sure.. There's no drama like on Bleed Cubbie Blue and there's not endless inside jokes that are hard to keep up with like on Bleacher Nation (although I love Brett and that website just not the discussion)
CHICubs,3dyo86,albertcamusjr,5,Mon Jul 20 16:45:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, BCB is a bit intense with the way that Al refuses to take criticism or second guessing. I once tried to give him a pair of tickets for a Cubs game I wasnt going to be able to attend. I live in Iowa but was in Chicago at the time and had the tickets so I suggested we meet in Wrigleyville and I'd give him my pair of bleacher seats I couldnt use.  Could I have sold them? Yeah, sure, but I figured maybe he'd use them for a contest or something. He refused to meet me anywhere if I remembered correctly and when I said I didnt want to leave them at will-call at Wrigley he got salty. I just gave them away to a dude on the corner, couldnt believe how hard it was to give someone going to the event a pair of tickets to said event."

CHICubs,3dzez6,NewArithmetic,5,Mon Jul 20 19:47:31 2015 UTC,"As someone who also works in web development (and specifically by creating niche-based communities) - my best advice is to find one or two things that are fun to write about and focus very heavily on those at first.   It sounds like you're wanting to provide original content. You have the general topic (Cubs) - figure out what the established websites are focused on content-wise, and hyper-focus on some of the potentially interesting things that they are leaving out. That way you set yourself up as both a source of unique content for the reader and a potential partner for other websites. Also, aggregated content sites plateau because in the end you're always competing with the Reddits of the world.  Make sure you have an RSS feed. As long as you have original content, it will be a buildable source of initial traffic and readers while you are waiting to climb up the search rankings.  From a sanity perspective - separate the content creation and editing portions - don't focus on both personally. If you have a volunteer/cousin/friend who is a whiz at grammar and spelling, bring them in and let them worry about cleaning things up for you after you write. Plus, grammar doesn't require team affiliation, so they don't even have to be a Cubs fan.  I like your idea about focusing on prospects, minor leaguers, etc - this is something that interests me as a reader, but I find that a lot of the mainstream sites just do quick summaries with a bi-yearly ""100 best"" list. I tend to find more up to date content on Reddit in a lot of instances.   Every baseball player has an entire life's worth of stories, and if you figure out a way to tap into that you're golden. Minor leaguers would be more accessible in that regard. Maybe see if you can find a writer in each town with a minor league affiliate?  Be very careful about player photos, logos, etc. If someone else owns the copyright, you need a license to include it. Never ever use the words ""fair use"" in a sentence.  Scrap the livestream idea, you'll definitely get taken down and quickly, and your reputation will be done before you start.   Let people sign up on the site, and make sure you own the commenting system on your site. Don't opt for things like Disqus/Facebook as a quick fix for comments, as it removes most of your opportunity to continue to engage your users on a more personal level. It will take longer to get comment activity going, but your users will feel more engaged with you as a website.  From a design perspective, start out with a database of players for tagging purposes via pivot table. Make sure that when you mention a player in an article, you are linking the first instance of their name to a meta-page that lists all mentions of them on your site. On that page, have a simple bio listed. Then turn it into a resource by also listing/linking their Twitter/Instagram and also link to various statistic sites (baseball reference, etc). This way you have a resource on your site that doesn't require daily oversight, but provides a central location for users to reference as a starting point.  Those are just some quick rambling thoughts, let me know if you want anything more specific."
CHICubs,3dzez6,Nexhume,2,Mon Jul 20 20:53:38 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is awesome advice, thank you very much!   Be very careful about player photos, logos, etc   I've been using creative commons photos for now (cc-by). Is that okay to use?  I think I will do something on writing about prospects and such as I think that's probably my best shot to get through seo and it definitely is something I'd be genuinely interested in.  But yea, thanks again!"
CHICubs,3dzez6,Nexhume,2,Mon Jul 20 21:05:38 2015 UTC,"I've been using creative commons photos for now (cc-by). Is that okay to use?   Unfortunately, while I'm also a published photographer, I don't have much experience with creative commons as it comes to photo licensing, sorry. But I've worked with a lot of licensing issues from a brand perspective, and the best thing I learned is this - if someone gives you something and says ""here, use this"", that doesn't guarantee that they are a) the original owner or b) were allowed to legally license it to you to begin with.  A caveat - I have to add here that I run a very large website with hundreds of thousands of registered users, so I tend to be overly cautious about content to the point of probably coming across as too cautious. It's more that I'm kinda forced to think that way.  My advice from a business perspective though would be to set aside a few hundred bucks, compile a list of 10 questions like these, and visit an IP lawyer for an hour. It's the best investment you can make when running a website, and you'll be surprised how much you can learn in just one hour of ""what if's"" with someone who knows the law. I do this at least once per year just to run my backlog of ideas past someone who can rank them by liability.   I think I will do something on writing about prospects and such as I think that's probably my best shot to get through seo and it definitely is something I'd be genuinely interested in.   Good thinking on the SEO (original content is king) and I would definitely visit a site like that as well!"

CHICubs,3dybky,voidecho,4,Mon Jul 20 16:27:52 2015 UTC,Can anyone tell me who they think will be the projected starter for August 3rd? The Monday game against the Pirates. I'm going out to PNC to hit my 3rd stadium this year and hopefully see the Cubs win the 3rd time in person. I've counted a few times and got Lester. Just wanted to make sure I was doing it right. Bonus point if you can tell me who the Pirates are starting that game too. It would be incredible to see Lester since I've seen Arrieta and Hendricks already.
CHICubs,3dybky,Dhash23,3,Mon Jul 20 15:36:23 2015 UTC,My math says it would be lester too. Only thing I could see messing that up would be if the cubs got a new guy at the deadline and they put him in mix.
CHICubs,3dybky,los_pollos-hermanos,2,Mon Jul 20 15:39:35 2015 UTC,Yeah...looks like Lester to me.

CHICubs,3dybky,Dhash23,2,Mon Jul 20 16:06:35 2015 UTC,Looks like Liriano would be lined up to start for the Pirates which would be a pretty great pitching match up if Lester starts.
CHICubs,3dybky,drakejack,3,Mon Jul 20 15:53:25 2015 UTC,We should see Schwarber three out of four games.  Not sure why they're even keeping Targaryen up here?  Guess just defensive insurance until they're comfortable.
CHICubs,3dybky,voidecho,3,Mon Jul 20 15:41:51 2015 UTC,yeah especially since if they send him down they couldn't call him back up within  10 days or have to count it as service time.  Probably just saying why not for now especially if they're gonna give Schwarber some looks in LF
CHICubs,3dybky,Sparx7,2,Mon Jul 20 15:48:25 2015 UTC,We should but I would guess he will get two starts. Today and one game of the Double Header. Maybe the Beeler start which will prob be the late game. I just think Joe will give Teagarden one and Ross another. In his postgame conference yesterday he mentioned something about not underestimating the importance of defense behind the plate.
CHICubs,3dybky,Mattcub23917,5,Mon Jul 20 16:20:19 2015 UTC,I thought I specifically saw Maddon say Schwarb would go three days in a row.  I'll have to try to find that quote.

CHICubs,3dw4cq,Gimmie_Dat_Stream,22,Mon Jul 20 01:08:32 2015 UTC,"Ouch.  That's kinda a punch in the gut for me, I'd always heard he was a great guy.  I as well as my friends and family have been piling crap on him for quite a while now, it's easy to forget that these guys are just people too sometimes."
CHICubs,3dw4cq,zdruck07,10,Mon Jul 20 02:49:14 2015 UTC,I also take that as Rizzo being a leader too. Ejax still made good money
CHICubs,3dw4cq,Sparx7,3,Mon Jul 20 03:37:06 2015 UTC,He reminds me a lot of Michael Roszival from the Hawks in that respect.
CHICubs,3dw4cq,BVSuperman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:22:15 2015 UTC,I wouldn't worry too much. The writing's been on wall for a while now and the Cubs are going to pay him every penny of that contract.  Plus now he'll get a shot at a change of scenery.

CHICubs,3dw4cq,RustyDarkstar76,4,Mon Jul 20 21:28:46 2015 UTC,"I think the mistake was more signing him to a 4 year/$48M deal that they couldn't offload at any point....not signing EJ himself. Under a different deal, signing him is less of a mistake. But that deal was/is really bad, it did not fit with the overall plan that Theo laid out 3 years ago and turned out really bad for the Cubs. That said, writing off what they still owe him is no big deal. I'm quite sure that Theo has referenced EJ's signing as a bad deal and admitted it as a mistake, though not in those exact words, as you might imagine......  Either way, best of luck to EJ, too bad it didn't work out. He seems like a good dude."

CHICubs,3dw4cq,nickkline,29,Mon Jul 20 03:24:18 2015 UTC,"The fact all the players are taking the time to show their appreciation of Edwin speaks a lot about him. It's too bad he was never able to succeed as a cub. Guys can just lose it man, it's that simple."

CHICubs,3dw4cq,TheFakeTimShady,-39,Mon Jul 20 01:01:24 2015 UTC,It's his fault he was terrible. He has a negative war over his tenure with the cubs. We could sign a mid season free agent who could perform similarly to him for a fraction of the cost
CHICubs,3dw4cq,TandBusquets,24,Mon Jul 20 01:28:45 2015 UTC,"We wanted him to be bad and to eat innings, and he did exactly that.   Thanks for Kris Bryant Edwin!"
CHICubs,3dw4cq,Big_Gringo,23,Mon Jul 20 01:35:56 2015 UTC,That was definitely not the plan when he signed his contract lmao.
CHICubs,3dw4cq,TandBusquets,13,Mon Jul 20 01:40:38 2015 UTC,"I certainly think the 2nd part of that is true.  I don't necessarily think ""we wanted him to be bad"" is true, but I also don't think the Cubs had any expectations of winning anything meaningful the first couple years EJax was under contract.  So the fact that he was a consummate pro and could be counted on to go out there every fifth day to make his start while the rest of the roster was in flux means that it wasn't a complete waste."
CHICubs,3dw4cq,ThrillhouseVH,10,Mon Jul 20 01:56:48 2015 UTC,He was expected to go out and play just like every player is expected to. They gave him a four year deal so he could be around for when we contended. Edwin Jackson was never this bad in his career so there is no way that Theo and Jed expected him to be this terrible.
CHICubs,3dw4cq,TandBusquets,-10,Mon Jul 20 02:00:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah we brought him here to be our future ace! /s  We knew what we were getting, we knew we weren't trying to be competitive. Put 2 and 2 together."
CHICubs,3dw4cq,Big_Gringo,10,Mon Jul 20 01:48:42 2015 UTC,"We were expecting him to be a solid pitcher that would be around when we started contending.  Being terrible was not the plan, if it was we would've signed a cheaper player for that. Theo and Jed expected Edwin to make an impact when we contended, instead he was terrible and they want to cleanse themselves of him."
CHICubs,3dw4cq,TandBusquets,0,Mon Jul 20 01:58:14 2015 UTC,"No they didn't, he was brought into eat innings during a rebuild.  That was his whole purpose pitch 200 innings and be mediocre."

CHICubs,3dw4cq,RustyDarkstar76,0,Tue Jul 21 00:39:50 2015 UTC,That's not true at all. He signed a one year deal the year before joining us because no one was really looking to pick him up and there was hardly any interest around the league when we picked him up
CHICubs,3dw4cq,TandBusquets,24,Tue Jul 21 00:44:29 2015 UTC,"Salutes thank you tank commander, for everything, now his watch has ended."
CHICubs,3dw4cq,BpFal3,3,Mon Jul 20 01:13:34 2015 UTC,See.  I agree he was brought in to eat innings and not be THAT good.  He was a colossal waste of money though.  Most people expressing this thought are getting down voted though.

CHICubs,3dw4cq,joejance,8,Mon Jul 20 01:15:55 2015 UTC,Dogecoin.
CHICubs,3dw4cq,UNSTABLETON_LIVE,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:30:33 2015 UTC,All 20s.
CHICubs,3dw4cq,NotreDameFootball,5,Mon Jul 20 14:23:20 2015 UTC,They've been running lean enough these past few years that they won't worry about that contract.
CHICubs,3dw4cq,your_fish_monger,7,Mon Jul 20 01:18:49 2015 UTC,"As someone who isn't intimately familiar with the DFA process, is this just to make room for Soriano, or does it perhaps portend a trade for another player?"
CHICubs,3dw4cq,RedefiningForm,12,Mon Jul 20 01:07:16 2015 UTC,"Designate for Assignment means that the player is put into a sort of limbo for ten days (pretty sure it's ten) in which he's removed from the 25 and 40 man rosters. Other teams have the option to either claim the player off of waivers but then be responsible for the player's contract (no chance with Edwin) or he can be traded. If the ten days pass without either a claim or a trade the player is given the option to either accept his outright release or accept a demotion to AAA.  So to answer your question, it presents the chance of a trade but I can't imagine anyone wanting Edwin and even if they do, it won't be for anyone or anything of significance."
CHICubs,3dw4cq,TheFakeTimShady,6,Mon Jul 20 01:10:00 2015 UTC,"Just a quick note. A player can be outrighted to the minors without his consent once in his career. Note this isn't the same as optioning a player to the minors, as an optioned player remains on the 40-man roster and retains his major league contract. An outrighted player (with or without consent) no longer has a major league contract and isn't on the 40-man roster.   I'm not sure if Edwin has been outrighted without his consent already, I'm assuming he has, however.  EDIT: this doesn't apply as Edwin has more than 5 years of major league service.  He must accept being sent to the minors."
CHICubs,3dw4cq,LtDarien,3,Mon Jul 20 02:07:31 2015 UTC,"Very interesting, I did not know that. I also know that he came up at 19 or 20 years old so he probably has some original options left but my guess would be those void with a certain amount of service time. Not sure if one has to do with the other but interesting thought."
CHICubs,3dw4cq,TheFakeTimShady,5,Mon Jul 20 02:50:55 2015 UTC,"So it's just a Soriano thing then, with no real effect of now having a space open on the 40 man roster?"
CHICubs,3dw4cq,RedefiningForm,9,Mon Jul 20 01:11:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just clearing a space. If there was a move to be made with Edwin they would have already made it. DFA is pretty much a white flag."
CHICubs,3dw4cq,TheFakeTimShady,2,Mon Jul 20 01:15:36 2015 UTC,What are the odds he goes to the minors vs accepting a release?
CHICubs,3dw4cq,I_Sugest_Comic_Sans,4,Mon Jul 20 02:26:21 2015 UTC,I'd be very surprised if be accepts a minor league assignment. That works for younger guys trying to stay in the league but Edwin still will have a pretty substantial paycheck coming his way. If it were me I'd just sit around and wait for the phone to ring while still getting a check.
CHICubs,3dw4cq,TheFakeTimShady,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:53:12 2015 UTC,If someone picks him up while he's still on the Cubs payroll (after the ten day period) do we still pay him or does the other team assume the contract?

Somebody had to go.  I say best of luck to him unless he's pitching against the Cubs.  I also think his troubles with the Cubs could have been fixed a long time ago with a minor adjustment or two and a team out there will recognize that and sign him after he is released.

Seems kinda dumb to just completely give up 10 days before the trade deadline on any hope of getting anything at all for him, and just being content to release him. I would also think if they are still trying to trade him, DFAing him would take away leverage in negotiations. Because why give anything up for him if you can just wait 11 days and then get him for free?"
CHICubs,3dw4cq,cgiall420,3,Mon Jul 20 07:26:02 2015 UTC,Can't lose leverage you don't have. This guy has no value whatsoever. He's been actively harmful to the team the last few years and his contract is atrocious. Who in their right mind would even consider trading for him?
CHICubs,3dw4cq,millardthefillmore,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:51:26 2015 UTC,"Someone desperate for a pitcher at the deadline and is willing to take a chance on a guy who has been fairly good in the past. I'm not saying they would get anything good for him, but if the Cubs pay all but the minimum of the rest of his salary, they might get a very low-level prospect? You know, instead of paying his entire salary and getting nothing at all. It just seems like they could have waited to see if a deal falls in their lap in the next 10 days, and you can always still release him after that if no one took him. It's not like these 10 days are absolutely critical to the season--we're playing shit teams anyway.   I don't doubt the move at all, and wish they would have done it back in April. But the timing so close before the deadline when so many trades are going to happen has me thinking this only really makes sense if they have already agreed to send him somewhere."

All I am saying is if there was any 10-day span during the entire 365-day year when some team MIGHT be willing to take a risk on a guy who was actually kinda good in the past at very little cost, the 10 days before the trade deadline might be it. Seems like an odd time to just dump him when you have put up with him for this long. I really hope they announce a trade for some minor piece that we will never hear from again in the coming days."

I don't know every contender's rotation and pitching situation, but if any one of them (and there are more now due to the extra WC) think a change of scenery can get EJax back to even close to what he was a couple years ago, I would say nearly every team in baseball would have that guy on the team.

Or just cut you loss and take the $250?"

CHICubs,3dwe76,Dhash23,2,Mon Jul 20 03:24:05 2015 UTC,Put it in the history books
CHICubs,3dwe76,Sparx7,7,Mon Jul 20 03:35:44 2015 UTC,I really think that if this guy can get hot and hit like he was... he'll be a big part of the stretch run
CHICubs,3dwe76,RyanTheCubsSTH,5,Mon Jul 20 02:29:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he was doing well at AAA before he got hurt."
CHICubs,3dwe76,blyzo,5,Mon Jul 20 02:39:31 2015 UTC,I really want to at least a few times this year see our full slate of rookies on the field together. That probably means Bryant to LF and Baez at 3rd. Right?   But with Schwarber looking like he'll be a regular presence now I can't wait to see all these players we've been waiting for out there together.
CHICubs,3dwe76,Jemidar_,4,Mon Jul 20 02:39:07 2015 UTC,"agreed. I want to see Schwarber, Baez, Castro, Soler, Bryant, Rizzo, and Russell all on the field at once. preferably for as long as possible, but just to have that for a short period of time would still be a hell of a good time."
CHICubs,3dwe76,Sofnr,5,Mon Jul 20 03:02:03 2015 UTC,At this point i don't see how putting Bryant in left to make room for Baez improves the team.  If Baez comes up he should be playing 2B or SS even if that means moving Castro to the bench.   Coghlan/Denorfia as a platoon > current Castro.
CHICubs,3dwe76,CrossBowGuy237,-6,Mon Jul 20 03:50:11 2015 UTC,Castro?!? Is there another Castro I don't know of?
CHICubs,3dwe76,Jemidar_,21,Mon Jul 20 03:40:11 2015 UTC,I'm not giving up on bae.
CHICubs,3dwe76,iam2eeyore,2,Mon Jul 20 03:41:22 2015 UTC,Can he play Center Field?
CHICubs,3dwe76,Gyro88,2,Mon Jul 20 03:37:44 2015 UTC,"Alcantara can, but he don't hit too good in the majors yet."
CHICubs,3dwe76,iam2eeyore,0,Mon Jul 20 21:37:56 2015 UTC,"I've been wondering about Baez in center, in part, because of Alcantara and Lake. They were both SS's for Iowa and moved to Center. I know that every player is different but, perhaps, the tools of a SS can translate to CF."
CHICubs,3dwe76,Gyro88,2,Mon Jul 20 21:43:06 2015 UTC,"I'm sure he can a bit. Whether he'd really be any good at it is another question. All I can offer in that regard is that he doesn't have a CF rating in OOTP, haha."
CHICubs,3dwe76,iam2eeyore,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:04:26 2015 UTC,"He played it in high school for a bit but that was for a short time a long time ago. Hell, he played catcher too but I doubt that he could step in and do that today."
CHICubs,3dwe76,Jollyman21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:35:28 2015 UTC,Wouldn't we move bryant to OF since he took reps there in ST and shift Castro to 3rd so Baez and Russell can play their natural positions

CHICubs,3dwe76,Sephiroth007,15,Mon Jul 20 03:40:02 2015 UTC,plz no
CHICubs,3dwe76,remotecourting,2,Mon Jul 20 03:43:17 2015 UTC,Keep in mind he was a Hendry pick - not Epstein. He doesn't work the count like Maddon and Epstein want either... Which is to say I wouldn't be surprised to see him flipped at some point.
CHICubs,3dwe76,Sparx7,5,Mon Jul 20 20:30:55 2015 UTC,"If we can get something really good for him sure, but I'd rather see what he can do as a Cub."
CHICubs,3dwe76,bryanno4444,3,Mon Jul 20 04:21:45 2015 UTC,Yeah I just see him as being one that would be most likely to be moved.
CHICubs,3dwe76,Loop_Within_A_Loop,2,Mon Jul 20 04:31:48 2015 UTC,Agree.   Although Lake is hitting like .320 right now.  Surprised we never hear his name thrown around.
CHICubs,3dwe76,Sparx7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:56:37 2015 UTC,"He looked decent during his time up this year too. Package Lake, Baez, and Vogelburger to an AL team. But then again, I still like our chances landing Price in the offseason."
CHICubs,3dwe76,bryanno4444,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:21:58 2015 UTC,"He looked good, but the numbers weren't kind."
CHICubs,3dwe76,Sparx7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:54:16 2015 UTC,hell we might make a run at Price now and then try to extend him
CHICubs,3dwe76,THEriot2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:03:07 2015 UTC,"Aren't there stipulations that can be worked out during trades? Something saying ""if you are traded, you agree to re-sign next year""."
CHICubs,3dwe76,Sparx7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:30:42 2015 UTC,I mean you can ask for a window of time but I dont know what Price has said about FA.  Greinke has said its all about money but I'm guessing the talks start at 6 years 150 mil with Price at least
CHICubs,3dwe76,THEriot2,0,Mon Jul 20 15:32:01 2015 UTC,"Someone would offer Price $200 million on the open market. That doesn't mean he'll take it by any means, and it seems like the Cubs would have an inside track on his services money being equal."
CHICubs,3dwe76,bryanno4444,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:15:07 2015 UTC,Over 7 years yeah probably.  I'm scared shitless of two big ass contracts of that high with 2 pitchers into their 30s but fuck it thats a few years down the line Sparx' problem
CHICubs,3dwwns,ihavetopoop,3,Mon Jul 20 05:19:55 2015 UTC,I wasn't surprised to see that Castro had a -WPA but I was shocked to see Coghlan in the negative as well.
CHICubs,3dwwns,iam2eeyore,3,Mon Jul 20 13:49:13 2015 UTC,"The stat is weird. Cobra is in the negative overall but his WPA- is among the lowest in the league which is a good thing. It seems as though Coghlan fails to come through just slightly more than he actually does come through. It could also be influenced on his position in the batting order.  Castro, as you might expect, is dead last (161) in -WPA which is a bad thing. Fowler is (154) in -WPA which is also very bad.   One thing in Castro's favor is that his pLI is 6th in the league. I take this to mean that he comes up to bat in higher leverage situations than most."
CHICubs,3dwwns,iam2eeyore,2,Mon Jul 20 14:05:24 2015 UTC,"Regarding Fowler it's not as bad as it seems.  Since 20-25% of his PA come at the first PA of the game, he isn't going to have as many opportunities to shift the WE that much.  He doesn't have a ton of power so that hurts him as well.  He has struggled and without those struggles, he'd be better off in -WPA but still low."
CHICubs,3dwwns,friendly-confines,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:12:55 2015 UTC,"I think that Fowler is a platoon player. It would be nice to have a center fielder who can hit right handed pitching to play opposite Fowler. Junior Lake can't hit right handed pitching either so I don't think that there's a solution in-house. If you look at Fowler's ""Clutch Stats"" at baseball reference you'll see that he hasn't done well when he can make a difference. RISP with 2 outs he's hitting 0.061. Compare to Chris Coghlan 0.218, or Chris Denorfia 0.273. Soler doesn't do well there either but his season has been up and down and he's young."
CHICubs,3dwwns,iam2eeyore,2,Mon Jul 20 20:12:02 2015 UTC,"Eh, Fowler has usually done well against righties in his career with a .755 OPS.  This year he is just not playing well all around so that is going to drag things down.  He only has 38 PA with RISP/2 Outs.  In a down season, having negative variance on top of negative variance is going to give you some ugly stat lines.  Given his career and his defensive chops in CF, I am fine with him sticking in the leadoff slot and working out of it.  Unless you move Schwarber to LF and Coghlan/Denorfia to CF, we don't have tons of options there...and even those give you a pretty awful defensive outfield."
CHICubs,3dwwns,friendly-confines,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:28:00 2015 UTC,"I wonder if the Wrigley experience is hurting Fowler. His OBP is .100 lower for day games than night games. The outfield is a mess. Soler hasn't done much until very recently, Fowler is showing signs of regression but that remains to be seen. Coghlan/Norf is a nice platoon in left but that's using 2 players to fill one, non-premium, position. I really wish that we knew if Baez could play center. Bryant has done it but I'm not sure that he could do it every day and not be a butcher. I wonder if they'll give Almora some time after the September call-ups to see what he can do."
CHICubs,3dwwns,iam2eeyore,3,Mon Jul 20 21:06:33 2015 UTC,"Need to understand this stat more, don't understand how he can be ahead of guys with higher average, OBP, and homeruns (you would think HRs would be the biggest thing from an AB that would increase win probability).    Must have to do with him taking more pitches I guess?"
CHICubs,3dwwns,Stommped,7,Mon Jul 20 16:21:10 2015 UTC,"When Rizzo comes to the plate, the Cubs have a certain Win Expectancy (WE), which is the percent chance that they win the game.  After the at bat, the Cubs have an updated chance to win the game.  This difference in the before WE and after WE is known as WPA (win probability added).  Say the Cubs are up 10-0 in the 8th inning with 2 outs, and Rizzo comes up to bat with the bases loaded.  The Cubs already have a very high WE (maybe 99.5% to win the game).   Now Rizzo his a grand slam.  After his at bat, the WE raises to 99.7%.  So Rizzo gets +0.002 WPA.  Now say the Cubs are down 2-5 in the 8th inning with 2 outs, and Rizzo comes up to bat with the bases loaded.  Making up a number, lets say the Cubs have a 25% WE.  Now Rizzo hits a grand slam.  After his at bat, the WE raises to 75%.  Rizzo gets +.50 WPA.  WPA is very context dependent.  It's probably not a good indicator of future performance, but it does show the player's value to the team in the past.  I really like it for all star and mvp voting."
CHICubs,3dwwns,Stommped,2,Mon Jul 20 16:39:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that makes sense."

CHICubs,3dw24g,NeverSummerMountains,6,Mon Jul 20 00:38:53 2015 UTC,So that Jake Arrieta guy is alright.
CHICubs,3dw24g,jp611,6,Mon Jul 20 00:48:29 2015 UTC,Time for a new Soriano on the squad
CHICubs,3dw24g,GoCubsGo2015,6,Mon Jul 20 01:02:25 2015 UTC,"Team ERA this month is 2.20. That. Is. Awesome. The offense has been down (3.27 R/gm.) but lights out pitching has given us a 9-6 record this month despite the offense! I fucking love this team, everybody is chipping in to win games. Some players are struggling and it's frustrating but fighting through the struggles now and continuing to win games is going to help this team mentally well into the future. GO FUCKING CUBS!!!"
CHICubs,3dw24g,drakejack,3,Mon Jul 20 01:49:00 2015 UTC,Vote for your heroes.
CHICubs,3dw24g,FxStryker,5,Mon Jul 20 00:58:01 2015 UTC,"Castro is definitely doing things differently, hitting the ball into right field a lot the last few days. I hope it pays off for him. Rizzo and Bryant didn't have good days, but Soler more than made up for it! And Herrera too!"
CHICubs,3dw24g,Ganesha811,4,Mon Jul 20 00:37:22 2015 UTC,"Just nitpicking, a right-hander hitting it to right field isn't pulling the ball, it's pushing it.  Right field is the opposite field for right handed hitters."
CHICubs,3dw24g,LtDarien,5,Mon Jul 20 00:39:48 2015 UTC,"Whoops, you're right. But he's not grounding to the left side of the infield like he was before the break."
CHICubs,3dw24g,Ganesha811,3,Mon Jul 20 00:40:51 2015 UTC,"Basically, he's going back to his old ways which made him such a successful hitter. When he lead the league in hits, he was always slapping it to the opposite field."
CHICubs,3dw24g,Cpt_Hook,2,Mon Jul 20 04:28:43 2015 UTC,"This is definitely what he needs to do.  If he sticks with it, he can prove to be much more valuable.  It also will allow him to cheat on pitches in every once in a while for power when the league realizes that he is trying to hit the ball the other way."
CHICubs,3dw24g,gfcolli,2,Mon Jul 20 08:05:04 2015 UTC,Didn't realize the Reds have almost as bad of a record as the Brew crew...

CHICubs,3duspi,windydruid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:06:00 2015 UTC,What annoyed me about getting Vizcaino in the first place was that we could've had Tehran (trade was agreed on) if Maholm didn't veto it just to agree to it few weeks later.

CHICubs,3dun34,GoCubsGo2015,11,Sun Jul 19 17:53:29 2015 UTC,We'd have to sell the farm so I find that unlikely
CHICubs,3dun34,theshaggysnack,2,Sun Jul 19 17:58:59 2015 UTC,I really don't see the Cubs getting Hammels with anything less than Schwarber or Russell. I mean we did get Russell for a half season of Samardzija. Throw in Pabelbon for Schwarber and someone else and the Cubs might listen.   Edit: why the down votes for reality? Hammels is more than a rental and both of them are playoff proven. One highly rated prospect for 2 good pitchers is a fair trade. Not saying the Cubs should do it but that's fair for the Phillies to demand.
CHICubs,3dun34,Banglayna,10,Sun Jul 19 20:35:38 2015 UTC,Less than zero chance we trade Schwarber or Russel for for Hammels

CHICubs,3drn4x,Sephiroth007,2,Sun Jul 19 01:25:20 2015 UTC,Why do catchers throw their mask off when going to make a play? Is it because the mask makes it difficult to see?

CHICubs,3drn4x,STUstone,5,Sun Jul 19 01:25:06 2015 UTC,Does the umpire inform the teams of a scoring change? Is is possible Lester has no idea?
CHICubs,3drn4x,ridethewild,3,Sun Jul 19 01:17:00 2015 UTC,Lester is a notoriously intense dude when he's pitching and the only person he really talks to during outings is Ross or Bosio so my guess would be that everyone else has stayed the heck away from him.

CHICubs,3dqmh4,MLWolfie,5,Sat Jul 18 15:33:15 2015 UTC,Starlin Castro with a .596 OPS is almost unbelievable.
CHICubs,3dqmh4,jp611,3,Sat Jul 18 18:17:22 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but if there's anyway he could still headline a hamels deal I'm doing it in a New York minute. His value has to be pretty low regardless of age.
CHICubs,3dqmh4,YourCummyBear,5,Sat Jul 18 19:09:29 2015 UTC,Let's gooooo
CHICubs,3dqmh4,Sparx7,3,Sat Jul 18 15:46:35 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind seeing maddon shake up the batting order and see if that creates a spark.
CHICubs,3dqmh4,Mattcub23917,4,Sat Jul 18 15:19:41 2015 UTC,If Castro had 16 more hits this year he'd be right on pace with last year's batting average.  If those 16 hits were 11 doubles and 5 home runs he'd be right at last year's slugging %.  Anyone think 11 doubles and 5 home runs could have made a difference of a game or three?    Have to look up how many runs 11 doubles and 5 home runs are worth.
CHICubs,3dqmh4,voidecho,4,Sat Jul 18 18:53:52 2015 UTC,"Castro's gotta get out of the 6/7 hole now that Schwar is up. He has a career low BABIP, and he's not getting anything to hit with guys like Ross/Deno/Baxter hitting behind him."

CHICubs,3dqmh4,getdatgoat,3,Sat Jul 18 16:24:45 2015 UTC,"Lots of Castro talk so I'll chime in. He can't hit anywhere right now, that's the problem. He is one off the league lead in GIDP and the only guy ahead of him has been DFA'd. He provides no power, speed or defense and he leads the majors in outs made. Throw out previous years because they don't matter right now, he has been the worst every day player in baseball this year.  You have to consider playing Herrera in the hopes that when he makes outs, he only makes one and his defense is a substantial upgrade. You can't keep waiting around for Castro in a playoff race, he can't be a sacred cow."
CHICubs,3dqmh4,TheFakeTimShady,2,Sat Jul 18 19:20:22 2015 UTC,"Totally disagree. You don't go and bury your starting 25-year old SS, who you expect to either (a) be a big part of the future or (b) want to trade away by hiding him on the bench for a replacement-level player like Herrera.  Castro has a .280 BABIP...the worst of his career by far and almost 30 points below league average. You want to make sure he gets pitches to hit? No pitcher in the league is afraid of David Ross, Taylor Teagarden, Denorfia, or Cogs. He needs to be either moved up in the lineup or put in the 9 hole to turn over the lineup.  Again...this is a PROCESS. They're not going to sacrifice Castro for the possibility of a one-game Wild Card game."
CHICubs,3dqmh4,achap39,3,Sat Jul 18 19:40:39 2015 UTC,his babip is shit because hes hitting like SHIT. easy rollers for the SS/2B make the play.
CHICubs,3dqmh4,zrk23,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:08:15 2015 UTC,"Yep totally misleading. He's not getting robbed, he's getting into bad counts then sticking his ass out and slapping at the ball."
CHICubs,3dqmh4,TheFakeTimShady,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:45:20 2015 UTC,"hate when people throw out stats saying ""ah, thats below average, it will normalize!!!!"""
CHICubs,3dqmh4,zrk23,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:13:14 2015 UTC,"You're trying to respect the process sure but what kind of message is that to send to your team when you continue to send out the league's worst everyday player when you're trying to win? I agree that you don't bury Castro but he can't be an every day player at the rate he's playing right now which is why I said no sacred cows. If he isn't helping you win games, he can't play and if you're going to ignore that for the sake of his development then you may as well be a seller at the deadline because you aren't trying your best to win.  Also the BABIP is a red herring. The eye test says that he hasn't been unlucky, he makes weak contact and almost never puts himself in counts to get good pitches. It isn't like Coghlan's first half who was continuously hitting bullets."
CHICubs,3dqmh4,TheFakeTimShady,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:49:14 2015 UTC,"If he's not an everyday player....you ARE buying him on the bench. Trying the same thing (6/7 hole) hasn't worked all year for Castro...so rather than give up on him, CHANGE IT UP.   Before this year, he primarily was a #2 hitter (1100 PA, .292/.326/.415). This year? 73 percent of his ABs have come from the 6 or 7 spot in the lineup...and we see the results."
CHICubs,3dqmh4,achap39,3,Sat Jul 18 20:13:01 2015 UTC,He grounds into too many DPs to hit up in the order. He's at 15 this year which is the most among active players and has been saved countless others by Maddon starting runners ahead of him. He hurts you even more than he already does by hitting that high in the order.
CHICubs,3dqmh4,TheFakeTimShady,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:16:11 2015 UTC,"That makes no sense. If he's hitting 2nd, he has a better chance of NOT having anyone on in front of him. The three spots ahead of him in every inning (except the 1st) would be Pitcher-Addi-Fowler.   Those 3 spots are going to have a far lower OBP than where he's been, behind Bryant-Rizzo-Soler/Montero.   One of the reasons why he's been scuffling, IMO, is because he knows that from the 6/7 spot, he has no protection behind him, and he's the last line of offense with Ross/Teagarden/pitcher's spot taking up the next two places in the order."
CHICubs,3dqmh4,achap39,3,Sat Jul 18 20:31:32 2015 UTC,"So you think hitting him behind the guy whose #1 job is to get on base will reduce his double plays? That's quite a leap. The point of the pitcher hitting eighth is to create more opportunities for 2, 3, 4 to hit with guys on base. By hitting Castro second you're not only putting a rally killer in that spot you're decreasing the chances that your actual run producers get a chance to hit with guys on base. There's a reason in my initial post that I mentioned he leads the league in outs made. He's a hitter who has hit from the bottom of the order and still manages to do the last thing you want your hitters to do, more than anyone else in baseball. That's not a guy you move up in the order, that's a guy you take out of the order. There's a reason Joe Maddon whose smarter than both of us doesn't hit him second.   As for being ""protected"" that's kind of an old school myth. If you're a sixth year player who still needs to be ""protected"" chances are you aren't very good. Castro is struggling because he has no plan, no approach and no sense of how teams are going to pitch him.  The easy way to get teams to stop throwing you bad pitches is by not swinging at them, something he just can't grasp."
CHICubs,3dqmh4,TheFakeTimShady,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:56:35 2015 UTC,I respect your opinion but I just don't agree. I don't think having Herrera playing everyday would be any sort of upgrade over Castro. And even if say Castro was hurt I couldn't see Herrera as a starter. And certainly not at short.
CHICubs,3dqmh4,Mattcub23917,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:55:49 2015 UTC,"Herrera is just what's available at the moment. With what you have on your roster the goal should be to minimize damage at this point which is why I mentioned Castro leads the league in outs. Of course Herrera isn't the actual answer but just ""some guy"" is an upgrade over an actively and consistently hurting you, Castro."
CHICubs,3dqmh4,TheFakeTimShady,2,Sat Jul 18 20:13:55 2015 UTC,Try this lineup Joe.    Castro Schwarber Bryant Rizzo Russell Coghlan Soler Fowler Pitcher    I know it doesnt make much sense but it might spark something. And having the pitcher bat 9th just to see how it works for us.
CHICubs,3dqmh4,Kaner_95,6,Sat Jul 18 16:00:08 2015 UTC,"Leading off with Castro?  Giving the most at-bats to the guy with the LOWEST on-base percentage and OPS isn't exactly an answer...  Castro is the worst offensive starter on the team this year; .279 OBP / .596 OPS.   I know you want to ""jump-start"" him, but that's much more likely leads to this team scoring even less."
CHICubs,3dqmh4,stackshot,3,Sat Jul 18 17:22:09 2015 UTC,Im with you man. Idk how anyone watching could want to see Castro get the most at bats on the team. His approach has been terrible.
CHICubs,3dqmh4,StewartDuck,4,Sat Jul 18 17:57:46 2015 UTC,"He makes the most outs on the team, bar-none.  I never want the guy who makes the most outs on the team getting the most at-bats."
CHICubs,3dqmh4,stackshot,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:01:13 2015 UTC,Castro led off against the Mets and killed it. Sometimes just moving a guy up or down can make all the difference.
CHICubs,3dqmh4,Dhash23,2,Sat Jul 18 17:44:29 2015 UTC,"He had a great five at-bats against the Mets, no question. On a one-game basis, sure.  I have to think that three years of proof or his career numbers would outweigh that.   (Especially because, as I said, a few don't realize that Fowler is definitely outplaying Castro, as bad as he's been)"
CHICubs,3dqmh4,stackshot,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:50:46 2015 UTC,"Of course of course, I just don't see a problem with leading him off right now. If it doesn't work and he goes 0/5 then try something else. But to not try it for one game because of the numbers would just be silly."
CHICubs,3dqmh4,Dhash23,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:53:08 2015 UTC,"Nobody could argue that going by the stats you are correct. You can understand though that there seems to be something about the current batting order that just isn't clicking? What is your ideal batting order using the current roster,with Lester+Ross starting?"
CHICubs,3dqmh4,Mattcub23917,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:55:16 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Let's assume the roster is set, that would mean that changing the batting order may be something Joe could do to at least try and get some players going.  Batting Castro higher with a Bryant or Rizzo behind him Might jump start something."
CHICubs,3dqmh4,Mattcub23917,3,Sat Jul 18 18:47:32 2015 UTC,"Agree on getting Russell out of the 9 spot, but I would honestly lkke that better if you swapped Castro & Soler"
CHICubs,3dqmh4,sjrossman0,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:36:56 2015 UTC,But isn't Castro close to a .300 hitter leading off? I thought I read that someone.
CHICubs,3dqmh4,Kaner_95,4,Sat Jul 18 16:25:25 2015 UTC,"Over the last three years, Starlin's hit .257 with a .307 OBP leading off.  He is quite literally the least suited to the leadoff role in the starting lineup.  Even with all of Fowler's struggles, he's still undoubtedly outplaying him. You bury Castro, not Dex."
CHICubs,3dqmh4,stackshot,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:37:56 2015 UTC,"So when Ross or Teagarden are starting they would be better than Starlin to lead off?  There are intangibles in baseball, it is not just about stats."
CHICubs,3dqmh4,Mattcub23917,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:23:59 2015 UTC,"I see the issue and agree that it is a problem that Castro is not hitting better. I would just say that some of the people posting here suggesting that Castro may perform better hitting higher up just want to see if it may help.  As far as intangibles, I have no stats to back it up,just my opinions from watching the team play. I would just say if the game was on the line and I just needed a player to get a hit(not a walk) I would rather see Castro stepping up to the plate then anyone other than Rizzo and Maybe Bryant. But it is just a feeling"
CHICubs,3dqmh4,Mattcub23917,2,Sat Jul 18 18:27:09 2015 UTC,I would definitely like to see Russell out of the 9th spot to see if that helps him to get going. I would also like to see Castro moved to 2nd just to see if that might jump start him. Maybe go with: Soler-Castro-Bryant-Rizzo--Russell -Catcher-LF-pitcher-Fowler.

CHICubs,3dnsgk,TweetsInCommentsBot,-7,Fri Jul 17 20:40:02 2015 UTC,Can we please stop doing this pitcher hitting in the 8-hole scheme :/
CHICubs,3dnsgk,kushQ,17,Fri Jul 17 19:55:01 2015 UTC,No way
CHICubs,3dnsgk,decitertiember,8,Fri Jul 17 20:01:43 2015 UTC,I was hesitant at first as well but I changed my mind when I realized that it works. Having a competent batter in the 9 spot drastically increases the RBI production of our best hitters in the 1-4 spots. And that pays off. We are trading low run production at the bottom of our order for more run production at the top of our order.   Edit: missed a word.
CHICubs,3dnsgk,bluegrassguitar,3,Fri Jul 17 20:07:38 2015 UTC,"eh, the numbers point to it being worth literally only 2-3 runs per season extra, and only for certain teams.  While I'm not one to say we shouldn't be taking runs where we can get them, I think saying it 'drastically increases the RBI production' is a bit of a stretch. There was a Grantland article that addressed this a few days back here:   http://grantland.com/the-triangle/mlb-national-league-batting-order-starting-pitchers-eighth-chicago-cubs/"
CHICubs,3dnsgk,decitertiember,4,Fri Jul 17 20:23:05 2015 UTC,"I see where you are coming from, but I don't buy the 2-3 runs per season data as it is based on an incomplete sample size. Considering that aside from LaRussa (cursed be his name) the pitcher in the 8-spot doesn't happen that often.  Rizzo has 48 RBIs and Bryant has 51. Given that Fowler's BA has been pretty low and Russell's has been ~300, I'm willing to find a correlation between the RBI production of Rizzo and Bryant and Addison's batting average. I want to see the numbers crunched after this season is done. I think we'll see it's worth more than 2-3 runs in the season. And may even be worth 2-3 wins."
CHICubs,3dnsgk,Cpt_Hook,5,Fri Jul 17 20:34:15 2015 UTC,"I like your thought process, but Addi is hitting like .240 right now haha. He'll definitely improve though, and I'm a big fan of the pitcher in the 8 spot."
CHICubs,3dnsgk,decitertiember,3,Fri Jul 17 20:38:58 2015 UTC,"You are totally right. I guess I've just watched him hit a lot when I catch games. For added clarity, Baseball-Reference has Addi with BA=226 and OBP=296. Sorry about the incorrect data, folks."
CHICubs,3dnsgk,Cpt_Hook,2,Fri Jul 17 20:43:05 2015 UTC,"Sheesh, even I overestimated it... Well, he's hit a rough patch, but I think he'll be solid after the long break."
CHICubs,3dnsgk,THEriot2,3,Fri Jul 17 21:06:08 2015 UTC,"It's not sample size. It's based on expected runs so the sample, in theory, is infinite.  Edit: i.e. they didn't come up with that figure by studying instances where the pitcher actually hit 8th in a real life game.  Edit 2: It's certainly not worth 2-3 wins. That's ~20-30 RAR. For reference, Evan Gattis was worth 20.1 RAR last year."

CHICubs,3dp8aw,Kaner_95,4,Sat Jul 18 04:52:10 2015 UTC,Just saw this dude at a Pelicans game I went to on Monday. He looks really good. Him and Zagunis impressed me.
CHICubs,3dp8aw,nakolas,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:52:06 2015 UTC,Dude just keeps hitting.
CHICubs,3dp8aw,voidecho,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:14:06 2015 UTC,He sounds like the next break-out country artist
CHICubs,3dp8aw,BVSuperman,0,Sun Jul 19 06:54:26 2015 UTC,"That .347 is A and A+ combined. He's at .315 in A+, which is still pretty good."
CHICubs,3dp8aw,pm_me_ur_pajamas,2,Sat Jul 18 16:02:30 2015 UTC,The .347 is just at A+.  He hit .315 at South Bend (A).  His overall average for the year is .336.
CHICubs,3dp8aw,voidecho,0,Sat Jul 18 16:13:41 2015 UTC,You're right. I read the teams wrong. Good that he's improving.
CHICubs,3dp8aw,pm_me_ur_pajamas,3,Sat Jul 18 16:33:45 2015 UTC,"Three constants in the world: death, taxes, and Gleyber Torres hitting the baseball."

CHICubs,3dp65p,ChiCubsbot,14,Sat Jul 18 02:56:14 2015 UTC,"Every time I watch Strop, he gives the game away.  I'm sorry guys, this is my fault.  The next time he comes in I'll turn it off until the game is over :(."
CHICubs,3dp65p,nightninja88,6,Sat Jul 18 03:07:58 2015 UTC,"I mean, he's not a bad reliever, and with Bosio's tutelage he's delivered on his potential more than he did in Texas or Baltimore.  And yet, the last two seasons, he has lost 9 games and is 4/10 on save opportunities. That's really not good.   The sky is not falling, and pen has been much-improved over what we saw early in the season.   It's hard to not be rather frustrated with Strop, though."
CHICubs,3dp65p,terker,14,Sat Jul 18 03:30:15 2015 UTC,Schwarber with good offense but atrocious defense. That's gonna be the story of his season.
CHICubs,3dp65p,kingofnumber2,3,Sat Jul 18 03:28:39 2015 UTC,what did he do defensively? i didn't get to watch
CHICubs,3dp65p,I_AM_NOT_FAT_OR_A_HO,7,Sat Jul 18 07:14:12 2015 UTC,2 errors
CHICubs,3dp65p,slasky,4,Sat Jul 18 07:28:14 2015 UTC,We're really giving up after one game? LOL.  Strop needs to be backing him up there anyway.  That wasn't a bad play on Schwarbs at all.
CHICubs,3dp65p,jp611,5,Sat Jul 18 08:32:17 2015 UTC,"It was the guys first ever appearance catching in the majors,  and not to mention it was premature.  His performance is exactly what i expected and I'm ok with it."
CHICubs,3dp65p,urlacbear,8,Sat Jul 18 13:42:38 2015 UTC,"I could see Strop being moved at the deadline. Not a TRADE THIS BUM type thing or a reactionary thing at all but it makes sense if you give it an objective look. Soriano coming aboard pretty soon, crowded bullpen in which Motte and Rondon are obvious keeps, Russell has been great in his role while Grimm and Ramirez have more of an upside than Strop who is what he is at this point, which is a pretty solid reliever. There's a market for him and they could conceivably flip him for a bat. Without very much research the first thing that comes to mind is to Houston for Jed Lowrie. They're heavy on infielders and need bullpen help and the Cubs can't keep waiting around for Castro to figure it out. Just a thought."
CHICubs,3dp65p,TheFakeTimShady,12,Sat Jul 18 15:27:03 2015 UTC,So is this whole ump thing ever going to be addressed? It's awful and a huge issue
CHICubs,3dp65p,Milesweeman,3,Sat Jul 18 03:38:58 2015 UTC,"I was at the game and couldn't really tell either way, what was bad?"
CHICubs,3dp65p,wde1990,9,Sat Jul 18 03:06:04 2015 UTC,The strike zone was pretty awful both ways.
CHICubs,3dp65p,Milesweeman,2,Sat Jul 18 03:22:35 2015 UTC,"pretty inconsistent, hurt everybody though"
CHICubs,3dp65p,yusuf69,10,Sat Jul 18 03:33:43 2015 UTC,Quick reminder: pedro strop is pretty good. That being said why is rondon not pitching in the 8th? He's been dominant all year
CHICubs,3dp65p,Oprah-Is-My-Dad,2,Sat Jul 18 03:41:18 2015 UTC,That's what I'd like to see. I like strop and he has pitched well this year but not lately under pressure. I think him in the 7th and rondon 8 is our best move
CHICubs,3dp65p,dpete10,6,Sat Jul 18 03:01:18 2015 UTC,"Well, he lost the closing job. So not so much dominant all year."
CHICubs,3dp65p,Milesweeman,8,Sat Jul 18 04:02:52 2015 UTC,"On the bright side, Schwarber was very good!!"
CHICubs,3dp65p,NewArithmetic,2,Sat Jul 18 03:06:43 2015 UTC,3 hits is nothing to scoff at
CHICubs,3dp65p,NeverSummerMountains,2,Sat Jul 18 03:14:26 2015 UTC,Dammit I guess as long as we win the series that's all that matters
CHICubs,3dp65p,Cohaagan,2,Sat Jul 18 03:30:45 2015 UTC,Hopefully Ramirez will start coming in in those situations now that he's back instead of Strop. Let Strop work through his funk in lower pressure situations.
CHICubs,3dp65p,reddit-er,2,Sat Jul 18 02:57:25 2015 UTC,"Didn't watch the last 4 innings. After reading he box score, so uhh strop huh?"
CHICubs,3dp65p,Dhash23,2,Sat Jul 18 03:00:20 2015 UTC,Can our offense wake up now please?
CHICubs,3dp65p,zdruck07,2,Sat Jul 18 03:05:30 2015 UTC,Rizzo and Bryant both missed opportunities tonight. Maddon should've had someone up warming when strop went in. Not because strop is bad but the bp is obviously rested. Missed opportunities but this team once again shows a lot of life and promise.
CHICubs,3dp65p,Sparx7,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:26:44 2015 UTC,"Despite the lumps over the last couple weeks, remember:  The bullpen is good.  The bullpen is good.  The bullpen is good."
CHICubs,3dp65p,DrunkenSuperman,12,Sat Jul 18 05:25:56 2015 UTC,But the offense still sucks.  We need these guys to start hitting the same day.
CHICubs,3dp65p,YourCummyBear,3,Sat Jul 18 02:57:20 2015 UTC,"Soler can get hot. Schwar adds a new dynamic at the plate. Those two will have to shoulder the weight, beyond the obvious Rizzo/Bryant-led scoring.  I have very little faith that Castro gets out of his pit of offensive despair this season. The book is out on him in 2/3 last years, way overmatched."
CHICubs,3dp65p,stackshot,6,Sat Jul 18 03:09:58 2015 UTC,The problem is these guys just aren't hitting on the same days. It's crazy. Like bryant will go 3-4 but rizzo will go 0-4 then vice versa. I feel like it just has to be bad luck at this point.  But ya castro and Russell hitting so bad doesn't help but I'm much more forgiving of Russell seeing as he is so young and a plus plus defender.
CHICubs,3dp65p,YourCummyBear,4,Sat Jul 18 03:38:48 2015 UTC,Σ(bullpen)-(Strop+EJax)=good
CHICubs,3dp65p,leemill02,12,Sat Jul 18 05:11:11 2015 UTC,"If a couple guys with ERAs in the 3's are the worst we have in the bullpen, we're doing a lot better than most teams."
CHICubs,3dp65p,DrunkenSuperman,3,Sat Jul 18 03:05:32 2015 UTC,Quit being reasonable...we're trying to be sulky over here.

CHICubs,3dp65p,inevitablescape,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:25:05 2015 UTC,"I had to miss the game due to work, can anyone give me a brief update on how Schwarber looked behind the plate tonight?"
CHICubs,3dp65p,AMumm5,2,Sat Jul 18 03:09:50 2015 UTC,He looked pretty good blocking balls but had two errors charged to him. 1st one he threw it about 10 feet over castros head on a stolen base attempt. The second was catcher interference.

CHICubs,3dnydr,voidecho,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:49:32 2015 UTC,I'm going to guess that it's because the runner would/should have been out if the throw hadn't been 3 feet over the defender's head but I don't really know.

Ross is about as good as you are going to get for a backup Catcher, and Catcher's need more rest than most position players so having him out there once every 5 days is not that bad."
CHICubs,3drw2l,Banglayna,2,Sat Jul 18 22:51:41 2015 UTC,"Ross is about as good as you are going to get for a backup Catcher   That's not really true. Excluding injury replacements and guys who have since been sent down to the minors, Ross is probably the fourth worse offensive catcher in the majors. His defense makes up for some of that, but he's still a below average backup."
CHICubs,3drw2l,Asmodeus10,-7,Sun Jul 19 17:00:00 2015 UTC,I'd like someone who can get a hit. Every time Lester pitches they are both basically guaranteed out.

CHICubs,3drw2l,SomeoneSomethingJr,3,Sat Jul 18 23:40:13 2015 UTC,It didn't make sense when Montero was healthy either. Catchers really need at least one game off a week.
CHICubs,3drw2l,Loop_Within_A_Loop,3,Sun Jul 19 07:14:16 2015 UTC,"Every time I see footage of Ross in the dugout, I always see him with a crowd of young-uns around him.  He's cheering on every hit that happens, and is always involved in the game, even when he isn't catching.  Some things (hell a lot I bet) that he does for this team we will never see.  Everyone who ever talks about Ross says that he's an amazing leader and an amazing clubhouse presence.  These alone are great reasons to keep Ross, as this IS a young team, and we need leadership besides the manager that the young guys can look up to and learn from."
CHICubs,3drw2l,Twospoons,10,Sun Jul 19 19:45:10 2015 UTC,"Is this the Lester complaint we are going to go with today?  Using a personal catcher happens a lot in this league.  Catching is a demanding position and your best catcher is not going to catch 162 games a year.  Giving them a routine day off and allowing the pitchers to be comfortable with who they are pitching to makes the most sense.  You don't want any of the starters throwing to Ross one start, then throwing to Montero the next, then back to Ross.  They can't build a relationship that way.  Also, Kershaw uses a personal catcher.  Along with Cueto, and RA Dickey (yeah I know he throws a knuckle ball.)  Hell, the Cubs have done this in the previous years and even Greg Maddux routinely had a personal catcher while in Atlanta."

CHICubs,3drw2l,gfcolli,2,Sun Jul 19 03:15:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm pretty tired of it. Part of the culture change that's happening with the Cubs relies on playing aggressively and executing AS A TEAM. This doesn't happen when individual high-paid ""star"" players like Lester doesn't adapt to the system. Not throwing to bases, getting way too emotionally flustered when things go slightly wrong, only using a personal catcher (thus omitting a great bat from the line-up) have all been major contributing factors to losses this year."

Not his fault, but I felt they over paid for him.  I am worried his salary is going to make it tougher on the budget going forward.  He seems overly intense as compared to most of the rest of the team.  Chirping at umps, showing frustrations after an error by an infielder.  His inability to throw to a base to hold a runner eats at me something fierce.  A guy gets a hit or a walk and the rest of the inning I am watching the player steal second and then third.  If a ball is hit to him I hold my breath wondering what is going to happen.  The personal catcher is annoying to me as well.  All that does is reduces the flexibility in making out a lineup."

CHICubs,3dn4h0,Loop_Within_A_Loop,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:18:49 2015 UTC,"What's his game like? Line drive hitter/power hitter, high k/low K, good/bad defense?"
CHICubs,3dn4h0,kingofnumber2,4,Fri Jul 17 17:40:19 2015 UTC,"Not sure on all of it, but from what they said on the draft night, he's a low k, high on-base kind of guy.  Has some speed, very solid defender.  Not necessarily a homerun hitter per-se, but makes a lot of solid contact which means he can hit homeruns even as he's not a bonafied power hitter."
CHICubs,3dn4h0,snowcone_wars,2,Fri Jul 17 18:04:35 2015 UTC,"I think a knock on him is that he K's too much. 19.83 K% (19.83 BB% too) in college this past year.  He does everything pretty well, and nothing great."
CHICubs,3dn4h0,THEriot2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:02:00 2015 UTC,"You're right, completely forgot about that.  Not sure what it means how it will translate though given that his walk rate is so high as well."

CHICubs,3dn4h0,kingofnumber2,4,Fri Jul 17 18:12:07 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, I hope he could be anything close to that.  A probably more realistic/conservative comparison I've heard a couple of times is to Ben Zobrist, that sort of mold.  Also, he's a switch hitter better batting lefty, so that's always a plus as well."
CHICubs,3dn4h0,snowcone_wars,2,Fri Jul 17 18:38:28 2015 UTC,He'll never have the glove.
CHICubs,3dn4h0,THEriot2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:01:31 2015 UTC,switch hitter can hit  for power average and can take walks.

CHICubs,3dmg9l,WhiteRabbit13,26,Fri Jul 17 13:39:57 2015 UTC,Game 1 of 17 consecutive games against sub-par competition.   Our run starts today.
CHICubs,3dmg9l,SoonerJDB,10,Fri Jul 17 13:59:11 2015 UTC,I think the ASB will do the players some good. Most of them looked tired out there.
CHICubs,3dmg9l,Sparx7,15,Fri Jul 17 14:01:24 2015 UTC,Thats what happens when they go party with Bryant every night
CHICubs,3dmg9l,American_Soviet,9,Fri Jul 17 15:00:55 2015 UTC,Bryant is the party
CHICubs,3dmg9l,Toastman04,2,Fri Jul 17 16:38:06 2015 UTC,I think thats the teams biggest weakness right now.  So many new guys experiencing the marathon of a season for the first time.  I'm sure its draining.
CHICubs,3dmg9l,callthebluff,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:11:03 2015 UTC,"Yep, there may be a couple slumps in the 2nd half due to this (Bryant, Russell).  Hopefully Castro starts to produce and Soler is well rested and it basically washes out."

CHICubs,3dmg9l,Sparx7,13,Fri Jul 17 19:01:33 2015 UTC,We better get Schwarber at catcher and Cogs in LF vs the righty
CHICubs,3dmg9l,stackshot,7,Fri Jul 17 14:12:37 2015 UTC,Mmm mmm. A legit-looking cleanup hitter. It's been a missing piece all year.

CHICubs,3dmg9l,voidecho,2,Fri Jul 17 14:43:30 2015 UTC,Only need eight to beat the Braves!  ;)
CHICubs,3dmg9l,Sparx7,3,Fri Jul 17 14:45:05 2015 UTC,Fowlers bat vs RHP really doesn't count

CHICubs,3dmg9l,stackshot,4,Fri Jul 17 15:06:31 2015 UTC,"You just can't give Castro MORE atbats right now. The team needs offense more than ever, and you don't ever place a guy with a .280 OBP at the top.  Castro needs to sink or swim at the bottom. Babying him could hurt this team further."

CHICubs,3dmg9l,SoonerJDB,4,Fri Jul 17 17:10:49 2015 UTC,Left field isn't the hole in our lineup. Cogs and Denorfia combine to be the third best bat in our lineup. I would hate this trade.

CHICubs,3dmoto,RyanTheCubsSTH,4,Fri Jul 17 14:52:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah I wouldn't doubt it for a second. He had a clause in his contact that he could opt out if he wasn't up by the break so this week is definitely pretty close to the time frame they were looking for. Also judging by his performances I don't think he needs a lot more time to ""develop"" seeing as how he has been tearing up the minors."
CHICubs,3dmoto,los_pollos-hermanos,3,Fri Jul 17 14:59:11 2015 UTC,"I'd heard the opt-out clause too, but I've also read that he was late in getting to the states for some reason or another so maybe the clause was pushed back. Either way he's pitching well and I'm stoked to see the Cubs add him. Kind of makes you wonder who is the odd man out."
CHICubs,3dmoto,los_pollos-hermanos,2,Fri Jul 17 15:02:05 2015 UTC,I was kind of wondering that too. With Schlitter and Rosscup gone there isn't really anyone in the pen I would instantly want to kick out.
CHICubs,3dmoto,voidecho,10,Fri Jul 17 15:10:38 2015 UTC,EJax
CHICubs,3dmoto,NicCage420,2,Fri Jul 17 15:29:11 2015 UTC,"EJax's ERA is over a run better than Neil Ramirez's, his FIP over two runs better. He's been a good reliever this year."
CHICubs,3dmoto,voidecho,11,Fri Jul 17 17:45:31 2015 UTC,Ramirez has pitched 6.1 innings and two of his three runs were on one pitch.  If Ramirez pitches 2.1 scoreless innings his ERA will be lower than EJax.  That's how small the sample size is.    EJax is only put in the game when things don't matter.  He has done a good job though of eating up un-important innings so the better relievers can save their arms for when it matters.
CHICubs,3dmoto,iam2eeyore,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:20:42 2015 UTC,Do you take the left handed James Russell out to bring up Soriano? That leaves Wood as the only lefty.
CHICubs,3dmoto,Sparx7,2,Fri Jul 17 15:10:35 2015 UTC,The big question is who's booted off the 40 man roster to make room?
CHICubs,3dmoto,THEriot2,3,Fri Jul 17 15:15:24 2015 UTC,Who knows Rosscup to the 60 day?  You'd have to think Wood is the odd man out at this point otherwise
CHICubs,3dmoto,Sparx7,5,Fri Jul 17 15:26:47 2015 UTC,That would be disappointing. He's been great since moving to relief.
CHICubs,3dmoto,THEriot2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:35:19 2015 UTC,I mean yeah hasn't been bad but theres no need for 3 longmen with him richards and ejax.  Ejax would have to go back to shitty ejax to be cut with his salary and they just made a move for richards.  Honestly I wish they could get a deal done and move wood as a piece for whatever SP they are talked to be going after but I mean who knows
CHICubs,3dmoto,Sparx7,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:44:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he may be the odd man out, unfortunately. They  may know something about Richard that we don't, though, maybe he would be able to pass through waivers."
CHICubs,3dmoto,THEriot2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:47:14 2015 UTC,IIRC there was some clause in richards contract with the pirates that he had to be up by a certain time or he was a FA thats why we could get him for cash....but that means no one else went after him
CHICubs,3dmoto,Sparx7,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:57:06 2015 UTC,"Or we offered more cash. Also, this makes me feel like that clause is no longer an issue.   The impetus for the move was an “upward mobility” clause in Richard’s contract, which created a three-day period within which the Pirates had to offer him to other clubs willing to put him on a big league roster or instead add him to their own roster. Had no team been so willing, then Richard would have remained in Triple-A."

CHICubs,3dkbuy,aloha_brah,3,Thu Jul 16 23:43:59 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah. i rave about his hit tool. It's incredible. My point is that Gattis as a backstop isn't THAT bad, and that if you have a solid spell long term, and he can develop a good rapport with the pitching staff, Schwarber is a lot more valuable if he can catch 2/5 or 3/5 games as opposed to being a full time LF."

CHICubs,3djb61,voidecho,2,Sat Jul 18 18:11:12 2015 UTC,"The idea of it creating a second leadoff hitter is BS to me. If that's what we want, then bat Addison leadoff, and move everyone down one.  The only slightly positive outcome, of batting the pitcher 8th, is that our 3rd batter gets guaranteed an at-bat in the 1st inning.  After that first inning, there's no difference. Each guy gets a turn, every 9th at-bat, in the very sequence we began with."
CHICubs,3djb61,bchanged,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:17:43 2015 UTC,"I'm sure over the course of an entire season, it may generate 20 or so opportunities where the 9 hole leads off maybe the 3rd inning or something, of which maybe a fourth of these situations lead to extra run(s), which may end up not affecting the outcome of any single game.  I think the most compelling argument in the Cubs' situation is that Russell gets to see better pitches to help his development. To me that argument makes a lot of sense. He may not be batting very well right now, but I think in the long run this will help his development as opposed to getting pitched around to reach the pitcher's spot if he were to bat 8th."
CHICubs,3djb61,Mattcub23917,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:50:22 2015 UTC,I think the most obvious reason is that some teams that have been consistently successful recently have done it. (Cardnials)  Teams try to emulate or incorporate aspects of successful teams in to their team philosophy.

It appears to be between this game and the Orioles-Angels game for the Sunday night game.

CHICubs,3dg6qm,RustyDarkstar76,27,Thu Jul 16 00:58:03 2015 UTC,"Not really. Despite the record this year, I still see this as a rebuilding year. I don't want them to trade away prospects for rentals so they can possibly win a wildcard."

CHICubs,3dg6qm,Randomith,2,Thu Jul 16 01:25:58 2015 UTC,"The Cubs are rumored to be looking for pitching that will be around past this year, FYI. Shields and Hamels, among others, come to mind."
CHICubs,3dg6qm,RyanTheCubsSTH,2,Thu Jul 16 01:32:17 2015 UTC,I'm totally for the whole home grown bats and proven pitching thing they have going on. To me if they are going to make move I'd much rather see it be for someone that'll be around another year or 2.
CHICubs,3dg6qm,Randomith,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:47:02 2015 UTC,"I'm with you, I'm not looking for anything really when it comes to a 1yr rental. The only thing I would do on a rental is take Leonys Martin off of the Rangers, he's a FA after the year and they've got a crowded OF, so I doubt he'd cost much. Having that speedster has proven big for some teams in the past in playoffs and he's a nice backup if Fowler continues to struggle.  As for pitching, I personally think Shields can be had on the cheap and he's a guy I'd go after. If the Padres kick in 15M (as has been rumored) that makes his deal roughly 16M/YR for the next 3 years, which I think should be a decent deal. Kind of an inflated Ted Lilly deal.  Then spend whats left in the budget in the offseason on Price or Grienke and you've got yourself one heck of a team."
CHICubs,3dg6qm,RyanTheCubsSTH,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:50:05 2015 UTC,"Leonys Martin is not going to be a free agent after this year. His contract is up but he is still under team control until 2019. He still may be a good target for the Cubs, as his price will be a bit more reasonable than usual with the season he's having, but a defensively-sound everyday center fielder with multiple years of team control remaining isn't going to be cheap."
CHICubs,3dg6qm,SomeoneSomethingJr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:53:45 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah I just saw his contract was ending, didnt think about arb. I dont think his price will be as high as you think, they've got Odor at 2B and he's been great since getting called up. That pushes DeShields back to the OF mix where they're going to have Hamilton, Choo and potentially Gallo as well. Even the Rangers' website lists Martin as 2nd on the depth chart.  I dont think he'll be had for absolutely nothing but I do think he can be had for cheap."
CHICubs,3dg6qm,RyanTheCubsSTH,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:26:38 2015 UTC,I'll be pissed if we give up any guys that look like big future contributors for Shields. We could've just given him the extra year and 10 million this offseason and had him all year.

CHICubs,3dg6qm,Dhash23,2,Thu Jul 16 12:24:21 2015 UTC,"Probably.   I'm not one for making trades just to make trades. I'm not a fan of overpaying just to get the guy you think will save the day. I do, however, admit that this team has a few areas they could improve.   I wouldnt be the least bit surprised to see Leonys Martin on the trade block, he's a FA after the year and he's a speedy guy. I'd like the Cubs to kick the tires on him.  Rumor has it Shields can be had for something close to what the Cubs wanted to give him in the offseason, I dont know why they wouldnt give that a sniff too. In all honesty if he can be had for the price I've seen, which is a prospect or two that are fairly low level guys and the Padres will kick in some money then I'm all for it."
CHICubs,3dg6qm,kaiomai,4,Thu Jul 16 00:48:25 2015 UTC,We don't need to trade!!! The average age of our infield is 24. We have 3-6 Top 100 prospects. Now we're 7 games over .500 and people are calling for trades. I would be ecstatic if we didn't make a trade because I trust Theo and if he's not worried then I'm not worried.
CHICubs,3dg6qm,Dhash23,2,Thu Jul 16 03:23:15 2015 UTC,You seem to have forgotten about the rule 5 draft. We will lose prospects even with no trades.
CHICubs,3dg6qm,kaiomai,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:25:51 2015 UTC,"I am not familiar with this, can you explain?"
CHICubs,3dg6qm,pm_me_ur_pajamas,3,Thu Jul 16 16:31:37 2015 UTC,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_5_draft  The Rule 5 draft is a Major League Baseball player draft that occurs each year in December, at the annual Winter Meeting of general managers. The Rule 5 draft aims to prevent teams from stockpiling too many young players on their minor league affiliate teams when other teams would be willing to have them play in the majors.[1] The Rule 5 draft is named for its place in Major League Rules. (It is sometimes mistakenly referenced with a Roman numeral.) The June Rule 4 draft, known as simply ""the draft"", ""amateur draft"", or ""first year player draft"", is a distinctly different process in which teams select high school and college players.  Description  As in the amateur draft, the selection order of the teams is based on each team's win-loss record from the prior regular season, each round starting with the team with the worst record and proceeding in order to the team with the best record. Any player selected under Rule 5 is immediately added to his new team's 40-man roster; thus, teams who do not have an available roster spot may not participate in the Rule 5 draft. Players who are not currently on their team's 40-man roster are eligible to be selected in the Rule 5 draft, but only after a standard exemption period has elapsed. See Selection eligibility below.  If chosen in the Rule 5 draft, a player must be kept on the selecting team's 25-man major league roster for the entire season after the draft—he may not be optioned or designated to the minors. The selecting team may, at any time, waive the Rule 5 draftee. If a Rule 5 draftee clears waivers by not signing with a new MLB team, he must be offered back to the original team, effectively canceling the Rule 5 draft choice. Once a Rule 5 draftee spends an entire season on his new team's 25-man roster, his status reverts to normal and he may be optioned or designated for assignment.  To prevent the abuse of the Rule 5 draft, the rule also states that the draftee must be active for at least 90 days. This keeps teams from drafting players, then placing them on the disabled list for the majority of the season. For example, if a Rule 5 draftee was only active for 67 days in his first season with his new club, he must be active for an additional 23 days in his second season to satisfy the Rule 5 requirements.  Any player chosen in the Rule 5 draft may be traded to any team while under the Rule 5 restrictions, but the restrictions transfer to the new team. If the new team does not want to keep the player on its 25-man roster for the season, he must be offered back to the team of which he was a member when chosen in the draft.  Selection eligibility  Players are eligible for selection in the Rule 5 draft who are not on their major league organization's 40-man roster and:  – were 18 or younger on the June 5 preceding their signing and this is the fifth Rule 5 draft upcoming; or  – were 19 or older on the June 5 preceding their signing and this is fourth Rule 5 draft upcoming.  TL;DR  We have a lot of great prospects and we should trade a few to get something for them before they are just taken away from us."
CHICubs,3dg6qm,maxelrod,3,Thu Jul 16 16:35:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, the offense is a joke and needs some consistency added to it. I'm okay not acquiring another starter or reliever (unless they get someone like Papelbon for nothing by agreeing to take on the entire contract)."
CHICubs,3dg6qm,ilovelamp42,4,Thu Jul 16 02:11:03 2015 UTC,"The problem with acquiring some offense is the biggest thing our players need, offensively, is to develop. Who do you replace on offense? Soler and Russell need to take their lumps and improve; Fowler is having a terrible season but it doesn't make much sense to replace a guy you just traded for because he's had a bad 3 months; Rizzo and Bryant are hitting well; Coghlan you could possibly replace but he's been hitting well, and will probably be replaced by Schwarber in another month or two anyway; Castro has been mostly awful but it's not really realistic to replace him and you're not likely to get a significantly better SS or 2B on the trade market anyway; and Montero provides decent offense for a catcher.  The offense is obviously bad, but I think the best solution is just to hope our guys get into a rhythm in the second half, rather than giving up future success for a quick fix of a problem that really should work itself out anyway. Of our starters, Castro, Montero, and Fowler are all having really bad years compared to their career norms, and Addison Russell is going to get better (maybe not this season, but you can't risk hurting his development by benching him)."
CHICubs,3dg6qm,pm_me_ur_pajamas,2,Thu Jul 16 03:35:11 2015 UTC,We can always replace Castro with Baez(and put Russell at SS) in a month or so if he continues to struggle. The only problem I could see is Denorfia re-injuring himself and needing to play Baxter again; it would then make sense to trade for a RH rental 4th outfielder to hit against lefties from Coghlan's spot
CHICubs,3dg6qm,dsalmon1449,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:16:53 2015 UTC,"It boils down to if they want to compete now or wait until next year. Giving the youngin's more time to develop is fine, but if Theo would prefer to gamble on that than find someone to take over LF or CF (or 3B and temporarily shift Bryant to LF) then we just have to pull back expectations.   Also, Fowler is a FA after this year and they only gave up marginal players for him, so I wouldn't let that hold back upgrading CF if the right fit comes along."
CHICubs,3dg6qm,pm_me_ur_pajamas,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:40:49 2015 UTC,"Why punt some future for a wild card spot now? Don't you want to be the perennial team like St. Louis? Not saying follow their model, but you don't NEED to trade this year. That's why the Cubs have been attached more so to guys where they aren't rentals. They want organizational improvement out of their potential trades not just some Jhonny Cueto to MAYBE get in the one game playoff and have him not pitch (it'd take a lot for Arrieta or Lester to not get it even if Cueto is magically on the team). All I'm saying is the 2015 Cubs are a nice surprise, but why risk 2018 to play one game in 2015, either at home or on the road to the go to St. Louis or Pittsburgh. Playoffs are a crap shoot but the Cubs window is opening,  not closing."
CHICubs,3dg6qm,dsalmon1449,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:45:18 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't trade for a pitcher.   It also depends on what the pieces to move are. Not saying to throw away prospects for the sake of it, but if the management doesn't care about making the playoffs this year then I hope the record is in the bottom 10 to protect the 2016 1st round pick in the event they go after Price, Zimmerman, or etc."
CHICubs,3dg6qm,remotecourting,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:49:10 2015 UTC,"But with the squad the Cubs have that's almost impossible. There are tons of teams that could have a potentially historically bad second half. That top 10 pick would honestly have to result from a about 40 game net change in standings. And currently they're 7 over. This team is too good for that to happen. You're right it depends. There are a bunch of Rule 5 draft eligible guys this off season that eithee are moved now, placed kn the 40 or are thrown to the wolves. It's just a waiting game to see what happens. Trade, no trade, Cubs are in a great position."
CHICubs,3dg6qm,dsalmon1449,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:09:54 2015 UTC,"There are a bunch of Rule 5 draft eligible guys this off season that eithee are moved now, placed kn the 40 or are thrown to the wolves.   http://www.spotrac.com/mlb/chicago-cubs/yearly/payroll/  The Cubs roster & payroll is designed with extreme flexibility, moving forward, to accommodate stashing the most promising players on the 40 man. They won't be thrown to the Wolves; that's mere hyperbole."
CHICubs,3dg6qm,remotecourting,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:11:50 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. Some of them it just doesn't make sense to stash. Yes you're right, the better ones the Cubs definitely have both the financial and the roster flexibility to stash, but not all of them will. Its a long list my friend. They won't be thrown to the wolves as I said, but you still can't keep all of them AND complete your off season shopping list. They are baseball currency so, use them. You want to get to the dance? Spend the coin and get there. Trade for your lefty power outfield bat. Secure you a leadoff hitter (I like Fowler for what it's worth). Get you another TOR. That's 3 40 spots right there so. You can only truly roster 25MLB and 15 minor leauge guys and that 15 goes by QUICK."
CHICubs,3dg6qm,dsalmon1449,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:44:01 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that not all prospects are Rule 5 eligible. I think they have to remain with their original signing/ parent club for a season or two first (can't recall exact time...).   Also, the Cubs sat out the Int'l signings market last season because of penalties for a big 2013. It is likely some of the Rule 5 eligible prospects (eg, Vogelbach) who they can't move now will be traded for additional slot money in the 2015 Int'l Player Draft, and that the Cubs will be big movers there too.  Plus, as good as guy like Torres might be in 2-3 years, no MLB club is going to keep him on their 25 man for a full season when he's not ready to contribute...   So I think we're more or less fine when it comes to keeping the top-tier talent we've accrued, at least insofar as Rule 5 is concerned."
CHICubs,3dg6qm,dewgazi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:48:45 2015 UTC,Torres is not Rule 5 Eligible though so thats moot. And a ton of the known prospects are. There's a list floating around here that had it.
CHICubs,3dg6qm,Sparx7,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:51:33 2015 UTC,"I'll be surprised if there is a big trade. Personally, I hope they don't make any moves that require dealing multiple notable prospects. This year is still part of the rebuild and I think it is safe to say that so far, it has gone better than anyone imagined. I firmly believe this team is right where they want to be in their pre-season ""best case"" scenario. All these guys are getting experience, they are learning and they are winning. They are in the hunt for the playoffs which means they will be playing meaningful baseball in the coming months. Which is more good experience. I don't forsee or support any major moves at this point. I don't think Theo/Jed will do anything big as they've been working so hard to accumulate assets and now isn't the time to sell out for one or two expensive veterans. They are playing a long game and the time to make moves will be in the offseason. They may make some smaller moves if the price is right, but I don't think we'll see any big additions this year and I'm 100% good with that."
CHICubs,3dg6qm,wuuza,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:23:18 2015 UTC,I think people need to stop acting like Theoyer is just going to throw away prospects for a shot this year.  They make moves normally thinking years down the line.  So dont think they're gonna go all Billy Beane on us
CHICubs,3dg6qm,jmr33090,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:50:56 2015 UTC,"I'd be more upset if we made a bad trade.  If no trades and no postseason this year means postseason for many years ahead, that's fine (though damn I'd really like to see them make it this year).  On the flipside, part of the value of our farm system is the potential, which may not ever be realized.  Holding onto a bust sucks, too.  Being a GM would be stressful."
CHICubs,3dg6qm,callthebluff,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:48:57 2015 UTC,"No. And in fact, I don't want them to trade for a big name. I think selling the farm for Hamels goes against everything they've done the last few years.   However, I'd be really happy if the acquired another middle of the rotation guy for cheap. If they could get an average #3 starter, then that average #3 starter would pretty much become a really good #5 starter for us and we'd have a legitimate argument for the best rotation in baseball, especially if Hendricks' last few outings are any indication of his second half."
CHICubs,3dg6qm,dunkarouse,3,Thu Jul 16 04:22:07 2015 UTC,"However, I'd be really happy if the acquired another middle of the rotation guy for cheap.   I'd be more than fine with a trade like Turner last year, some mid to back end guy that they see some potential in and want to work with.  May be for this year, may be for next year, but that type of flyer would be fine by me.  I'm sure the FO has a list of pitchers that they are interested in if they become available for cheap."
CHICubs,3dg6qm,callthebluff,0,Thu Jul 16 16:10:58 2015 UTC,"No. I think there are obviously still a couple holes we need to fill but honestly I think the best way to do that is to continue developing our prospects. I would much rather develop the talent we already have in our system than trade it all away for a big name player.   It would be cool if we could swap a couple tool guys maybe. Try picking up someone with some speed who can get on base at the top of the lineup, drop Fowler down in the order until he can get things figured out. But I think that, as has been mentioned, we have a young team in a rebuilding year that is really just learning how to play at the big league level with guys like Bryant, Soler, Addy, etc. I'd much rather have them play and develop and continue to bring up and develop players from the minors than trade any of them away for a big piece to make a Playoff push with the team as it is."
CHICubs,3dii6y,___worm___,11,Thu Jul 16 15:26:11 2015 UTC,"But what makes you think an NL team would take a prospect destined to be a DH? This basically just makes him a trade chip for the Phillies to be traded to an AL team, essentially turning being able to trade Papelbon for prospects into Vogelbach for whomever. I agree Vogelbach will be traded at some point but I think it'll be an AL team.   Plus I imagine if the cubs trade for pitching its gonna be a starter. Extra reliever would be nice but starting is probably priority"
CHICubs,3dii6y,Trex_cowboy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:32:07 2015 UTC,"From what I've read it seems like he's become passable at first base. Someone who knows more about him can confirm or deny this. Ryan Howard is a sunk cost for them at this point and doesn't have to play everyday like Rizzo does for us. But yeah I definitely see your point.   In regards to starting pitching, I'd be surprised if we could get better than a back-end starter or mid-rotation rental for him unless we throw in other assets. I think we could definitely get a decent bullpen guy (hopefully closer)."
CHICubs,3dii6y,Trex_cowboy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:38:57 2015 UTC,"That and Cubs are ""technically"" supposed to be still rebuilding this year. Theo won't make any trade to sacrifice the future. We'll see I guess"

CHICubs,3dii6y,callthebluff,2,Thu Jul 16 21:23:10 2015 UTC,would fill a hole on our roster   Which hole is that?  And yeah... I also fail to see why another NL team would give full value for Vogelbach.

CHICubs,3dii6y,Sparx7,4,Thu Jul 16 16:08:36 2015 UTC,Pabelbon's stats are marginally better than Rondon's.  I'd barely consider that an upgrade.  Definitely not something I would give up one of our better trading chips for.
CHICubs,3dii6y,callthebluff,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:15:27 2015 UTC,"see what the royals did last year? Imagine having a bullpen with Papelbon, Rondon, Motte, Strop (vs anyone but stl), and Ramirez if he comes back to form"
CHICubs,3dii6y,Sparx7,2,Thu Jul 16 16:58:33 2015 UTC,"Last year the Royals used Holland (drafted by KC in '07), Davis (throw in from TB on the Shield deal, couldn't crack rotation at either place so BP), and Herrera (IFA signed by KC in '06) as their big three.  Crow (drafted by KC in '09) was also used a lot, but he was pretty league average.  Grand total, they paid ~11.5M for the four of them.  Pabelbon makes $13 by himself.  Trying to buy an all-world bullpen rarely works and is rarely worth the cost.    Throwing away the best available trade chip we have (IMO) for a bullpen arm is silly when the bullpen has been good while the OF has been a shitshow."
CHICubs,3dii6y,callthebluff,2,Thu Jul 16 17:17:25 2015 UTC,I think you're severely overrating Vogelbach.  If he was in another system no one would  really care about him or think he was anything.
CHICubs,3dii6y,Sparx7,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:31:54 2015 UTC,"Very possible, but I think he is the highest rated prospect that I wouldn't care if we traded.  I think everyone else is over rating Pabelbon and the effect he would have.  I don't want to bother giving up any value for him.  If you want the KC bullpen, build it like KC did."

CHICubs,3dii6y,Mattcub23917,2,Thu Jul 16 17:59:59 2015 UTC,Nah. Would rather have him be part of a deal for kazmir and/or zobrist
CHICubs,3dii6y,Sparx7,0,Thu Jul 16 16:18:08 2015 UTC,I don't want either on the team. Kazmir is a flyball pitcher and not a big upgrade over our starters and Zorbist is a nice utility player but we could call up Arismendy to fill that role.
CHICubs,3dii6y,TandBusquets,5,Thu Jul 16 16:54:49 2015 UTC,Mendy doesn't have a .261   .346    .429    .775 line
CHICubs,3dii6y,Mattcub23917,2,Thu Jul 16 16:59:23 2015 UTC,Kazmir is above average in terms of Fly balls. He would make a good #4 starter and he's an upgrade in every sense over Wada and Wood.   Alcantara's days are likely numbered here and I would not be surprised to see him in a package in a deal this summer. He has been pretty bad and he pales in comparison to Zobrist.
CHICubs,3dii6y,TandBusquets,2,Thu Jul 16 17:11:46 2015 UTC,Except Zobrist is going to (probably) cost more then he is worth to this team in terms of prospects.  I wouldn't be too quick to think that Alcantara couldn't help this team.
CHICubs,3dii6y,cooter410,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:20:47 2015 UTC,I don't think so. We'll likely send off a package that has vogelbach and maybe alcantara
CHICubs,3dii6y,Mattcub23917,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:08:30 2015 UTC,If Alcantara can sort himself at the plate I think he'd be a great bench player for a competitive team. Can play multiple positions and can run a little. Just needs to be able to hit around the .250 mark.
CHICubs,3dii6y,TandBusquets,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:39:43 2015 UTC,Agreed. I think he could help this team in that utility role instead of trading for that type of player.
CHICubs,3dii6y,Cmdr_McBragg,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:14:56 2015 UTC,A lot of ifs that don't need to be asked with someone established like zobrist.
CHICubs,3dii6y,pm_me_ur_pajamas,2,Thu Jul 16 23:09:38 2015 UTC,"It's not the utility role, it's getting more offense into the lineup.  Yes, Alcantara can play multiple positions, but he sure as hell can't hit like Zobrist.  Not yet, anyway."
CHICubs,3dii6y,TandBusquets,0,Thu Jul 16 19:02:05 2015 UTC,I'll never understand the love for Zorbist. His offense is so terrible we might as well give Mendy another shot instead.
CHICubs,3dii6y,pm_me_ur_pajamas,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:13:20 2015 UTC,You might not understand baseball then
CHICubs,3dii6y,TandBusquets,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:18:44 2015 UTC,"If Zorbist were available for some low level long shots then that's fine, but Vogelbach is worth far more as a trade chip.  Plus, i don't think Zorbist is some missing piece that will propel the Cubs deep into October.  He's 34, a free agent this summer, and having his worst season in five years."
CHICubs,3dii6y,Cmdr_McBragg,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:27:05 2015 UTC,He adds a lot of depth to our team and shores us up in case of injury. We can resign Zobrist.  Zobrist's worst season is better than what we have on our bench so it isn't a bad deal.  You are overrating vogelbach and he should be dealt while his value is high considering we have no need for him
CHICubs,3dii6y,Sparx7,2,Fri Jul 17 04:21:59 2015 UTC,"Papelbon was interesting a month ago, when the bullpen looked shaky, but not now.  The pen looks very solid--Grimm and Ramirez have 8th inning/closer stuff but are working earlier because Strop and Rondon are so good.  Soriano is still working his way back, but how do you make room for him?  Who loses their spot?  Unless it's Jackson. . . .  I'm fine moving Vogelbach but would look for something else in return.  P.S.  Motte is the closer."

CHICubs,3df7du,Sparx7,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:24:13 2015 UTC,"I read this and thought the exact same thing.  Almora, Coghlan, and a PTBL?"
CHICubs,3df7du,thefoolwhofollowshim,7,Wed Jul 15 21:14:55 2015 UTC,Even after ballpark adjustments he's only a slightly above average hitter and pretty horrendous over the last two months. Not to mention he's a subpar defender in a walk year. Maybe a change of scenery guy like Alcantara and some cash but no chance I'm giving up a productive major leaguer or a prospect for him. If another team wants to overpay like that then they're making the same mistake the Friars did when they acquired him.
CHICubs,3df7du,Sparx7,2,Wed Jul 15 21:58:39 2015 UTC,Better hitters park.
CHICubs,3df7du,THEriot2,4,Wed Jul 15 22:06:43 2015 UTC,OPS+ adjusts for ballpark and normalizes the league average to 100. Upton's OPS+ is 113 and Coghlan's is 110. Which means all things being equal they're pretty close to the same hitter this year regardless of park.
CHICubs,3df7du,Sparx7,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:11:56 2015 UTC,There is WAY more upside to Upton. Let's not just act like Upton isn't clearly the better player based on half a season.

CHICubs,3ddpm3,TheLostWeasley,2,Wed Jul 15 18:56:17 2015 UTC,"We make a few moves at the deadline, but no real true blockbuster trades. The pieces we have plus those few additions are enough to squeak us into the wildcard. After that, as said earlier, ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN."
CHICubs,3ddpm3,stackshot,2,Thu Jul 16 14:16:55 2015 UTC,"I see us sneaking in over a fading second half Buccos, I see Castro picking it up significantly, I see Fowler being what he is for this team in a serviceable lead off man with occasional streaks of amazing. Rizzo breaks 30 this year. Cubs make the NL Championship and lose in six. Next year starts the true dominance."
CHICubs,3ddpm3,TheLostWeasley,3,Wed Jul 15 16:40:42 2015 UTC,"Finish with 92 w's and the 2nd WC spot.   Mendy, McKinney and Vogelbach are packaged for Kazmir and Zobrist.   Bryant wins ROY.  Arrieta keeps pitching well but Lester becomes the clear #1 in the rotation."

Hoyer trades for either Dan Haren or Tyson Ross.  The Cubs come close to getting Zobrist, but the A's get a better offer at the last second.  Alcantara and Almora are both moved for pieces at the deadline or after.  Miss out on playoffs in the final week of the season."
CHICubs,3ddpm3,gocubsgo22,2,Thu Jul 16 13:11:10 2015 UTC,Last time I did a prediction before the season started it was that La Stella would have the highest average on the team. I think I'm gonna stay away from predictions for a little bit.

CHICubs,3ddt72,windydruid,6,Wed Jul 15 14:43:23 2015 UTC,Yep...Bryant is at .343 and Rizzo .339 with RISP.  The rest of the team is atrocious with RISP.   What's suprising is that when Bryant gets on base he scores more often than the league average considering how bad the guys behind him have been this year.  Goes to show how great his base running has been.  Always goes 1st to 3rd.  Always scores from 2nd.

Interesting that the Cubs backed out when he was asking for more than 60 million over 3 years and now thats roughly what is left on his contract.

That rewards the league with the less equally distributed talent/resources/etc., which is about as arbitrary as having the All-star game decide it – not to mention the whole issue of ties (e.g. 2013).  In any case, the bigger issue isn't deciding who gets homefield advantage. It's how do you make the all-star game worth playing so it doesn't become a complete travesty like the NFL all-star game equivalent."

Now Dexter is 6'5 so maybe that  plays into it somewhat but more than likely it has to do with the umps views on certain players.  We've seen better pitchers get the benefit of the  doubt calls and Joe flipping out because the ump was ""Fucking his  young guys"".  Its been so bad this year though that the cubs did  send a contingent of players to MLB HQ to discuss the disparity.  Hopefully with shittier pitchers and an easier schedule in the second half it should even out a little more.  That  being said if theres a year for this to happen its this year.

I believe I read the zone is basically the same size as last year, but significantly larger than say 2008."
CHICubs,3dcrv6,voidecho,3,Wed Jul 15 13:34:35 2015 UTC,"I'm for the robots too and it doesn't even have to cut into umpire jobs. The umpire at home plate can still be the one to relay the call from the computer and he'd still have all of his other responsibilities e.g. calling check swings, plays at the plate, enforcing the rate of play and players being in the batter's box, etc.  I know the umpires' union will resist anyways as they'll see it as a sign of things being one step closer to them being obsolete, but that's really not the case. Most fans don't want to do away with umpires, they just want more consistency with calls."
CHICubs,3dcrv6,RunningJokes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:03:11 2015 UTC,"I read that as well, something like a 30% increase in the total size of the strike zone since 08? Honestly with some umps it seems like the plate has an extra 6 inches on both sides."

CHICubs,3db9l5,Snailz,32,Tue Jul 14 22:54:01 2015 UTC,The boos they gave the Cards were awesome!
CHICubs,3db9l5,voidecho,14,Wed Jul 15 00:05:31 2015 UTC,I found it interesting that the crowd has had no problem with Rizzo yesterday or today.  Kinda cool.  They do definitely hate all the cards players though.
CHICubs,3db9l5,Sofnr,5,Wed Jul 15 00:11:25 2015 UTC,I actually told my wife to get ready for them to boo Rizzo.  Was kind of disappointed.
CHICubs,3db9l5,voidecho,3,Wed Jul 15 00:13:41 2015 UTC,He looked like he was ready for the boos
CHICubs,3db9l5,cubfanbudman2015,7,Wed Jul 15 01:22:13 2015 UTC,He loves cincy. He was trying to give hugs
CHICubs,3db9l5,Sparx7,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:24:44 2015 UTC,I was surprised too. Maybe they forgot. I definitely would have booed Chapman
CHICubs,3db9l5,wbl7w6,23,Wed Jul 15 00:18:16 2015 UTC,Jhonny Peralta in the MVP conversation?  Fucking shoot me right now.  God no he's not.
CHICubs,3db9l5,jp611,15,Wed Jul 15 01:07:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that belongs to one Bryce Harper."
CHICubs,3db9l5,Sephiroth007,0,Wed Jul 15 01:27:39 2015 UTC,Damn do I hate to admit that you might be right... It pains me so...
CHICubs,3db9l5,PaletoBayPlayboy,13,Wed Jul 15 01:28:38 2015 UTC,Why? He's putting up ridiculous numbers this year. He's a stud.
CHICubs,3db9l5,Sephiroth007,0,Wed Jul 15 01:31:38 2015 UTC,It's because I don't care for the guy on a personal level. You are absolutely correct about his play. He's been incredible.
CHICubs,3db9l5,PaletoBayPlayboy,5,Wed Jul 15 01:34:23 2015 UTC,His personal antics have died down a ton. And let's remember most of it happened when he was still a teenager.
CHICubs,3db9l5,tesd44,4,Wed Jul 15 01:49:29 2015 UTC,Personal antics?
CHICubs,3db9l5,bluntsncuntss,-2,Wed Jul 15 02:08:32 2015 UTC,"I'll revisit my opinion of him in about 3 years. He'll have had a chance to mature properly by that point. Until then, I'll quietly root against him slightly. :)"
CHICubs,3db9l5,PaletoBayPlayboy,3,Wed Jul 15 01:56:31 2015 UTC,That's a clown question bro.
CHICubs,3db9l5,Sephiroth007,24,Wed Jul 15 01:57:24 2015 UTC,"Thank you Cincinnati, for booing the hell out of the Cardinals."
CHICubs,3db9l5,Joelsaurus,17,Wed Jul 15 00:09:50 2015 UTC,Did they really spend the first part of Rizzo's at bat talking about the guy on deck. Nowhere is safe from that circle jerk.
CHICubs,3db9l5,yusuf69,11,Wed Jul 15 01:06:05 2015 UTC,"Very, very hard to argue against those 4 players for the Cubs."
CHICubs,3db9l5,Joelsaurus,4,Tue Jul 14 23:49:22 2015 UTC,Who were they?
CHICubs,3db9l5,xderek182,9,Wed Jul 15 00:03:45 2015 UTC,"Ernie, Ryno, Billy Williams and Ron Santo"
CHICubs,3db9l5,GodFelice,3,Wed Jul 15 00:06:20 2015 UTC,Thanks!

CHICubs,3db9l5,Joelsaurus,9,Tue Jul 14 23:55:43 2015 UTC,"In no particular order: Fergie Jenkins, Andre Dawson, Greg Maddux, and....Sammy Sosa."
CHICubs,3db9l5,WP4114,5,Wed Jul 15 00:06:09 2015 UTC,"Snubbing Hack Wilson, Mordecai Brown, and Grover Cleveland Alexander though with those four."
CHICubs,3db9l5,designgoddess,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:58:14 2015 UTC,Hack Wilson should have been in the top four.
CHICubs,3db9l5,Joelsaurus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:24:47 2015 UTC,"Also Gabby Hartnett. Not saying it's perfect, but those are my choices. The problem with the older guys is that they're hardly remembered anymore. Most Cubs fans have probably never heard of them. Three Finger Brown might be the most talented pitcher in team history, but because the game of baseball was so different back then, it's hard to judge him against more modern players. Because of that, I'll give favor to those four."

CHICubs,3db9l5,RyanTheCubsSTH,4,Wed Jul 15 07:15:41 2015 UTC,I'll never really understand Sosa being that far down the pecking order.
CHICubs,3db9l5,designgoddess,-2,Wed Jul 15 00:43:06 2015 UTC,He cheated. I wouldn't have him on the list at all.
CHICubs,3db9l5,RyanTheCubsSTH,7,Wed Jul 15 02:24:10 2015 UTC,"You dont have him on the list because he cheated in a way you dont like. What you dont include in your argument is that many player of that era cheated. Many players through many eras cheated. Greenies,  steroids, whatever. Lets not forget that many of the players deemed the greatest didnt even face off against black baseball players. Maybe Ruth isnt as good if he's legit facing the best in the world and not the best white players."
CHICubs,3db9l5,designgoddess,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:29:04 2015 UTC,"It wasn't an argument, just my opinion. But I won't let any of the guys who cheated during that era on the list or in the hall. I'm no fan of Pete Rose either as a side note. Everyone doing it is not a reason to look the other way. I'm not sure greenies were performance enhancing. They didn't make anyone faster or hit the ball farther. It's truly a shame for baseball that it was segragated. Right now black players make up about 10% of the players in the majors. I don't think it was ever over 20%. Not every black player from that era was a future Hall of Famer. So, while numbers might not have been as good, I don't think they'd be dramatically worse."
CHICubs,3db9l5,RyanTheCubsSTH,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:42:00 2015 UTC,"My point wasnt that black players were better than white players, my point was that there probably hasnt ever been a truly even playing field. I also never said that every black player from that era was a future hall of famer. My whole point was that there probably hasnt ever been a truly even playing field. Scuffing baseballs, throwing a spit ball, taking amphetamines (how do you think it didnt help?!?) etc., its always been a game of trying to take advantage."
CHICubs,3db9l5,designgoddess,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:08:06 2015 UTC,"Didn't say that you did. The difference between facing an integrated league probably wasn't as dramatic to players numbers as PEDs. Same with greenies, spitters, or even corked bats. What Sammy did was against the rules and he knew it. Just like all the other players who also cheated. It shouldn't be minimized just because so many did it."
CHICubs,3db9l5,BillOneyPaige,2,Wed Jul 15 04:12:38 2015 UTC,Marc Grace gotta be in the conversation.
CHICubs,3db9l5,GodFelice,3,Wed Jul 15 01:45:32 2015 UTC,"Not sure the order but I'd put in Fergie Jenkins, Greg Maddux, Andre Dawson and maybe Kerry Wood."

CHICubs,3db9l5,lacedaimon,11,Wed Jul 15 02:09:38 2015 UTC,David Price is a pitcher I would love to see in a Cubs uniform. I have a good feeling he might be with the Cubs next year!
CHICubs,3db9l5,Sephiroth007,5,Wed Jul 15 01:44:59 2015 UTC,"I'd rather get a younger pitcher. But if we did get Price, I wouldn't be upset either."

Kris belts a deep drive, waaay back, it could be, it might be, it is!!!!!! HomeRun!!! It lands in the Ohio river. Everyone out there dives in to try and retrieve it.   N.L. Wins. Bryant is MVP! Cubs win game 7 of the World Series at home all because of the game winning home run Bryant hits in the all star game.  Bryant goes on to win All Star MVP, N.L. MVP, N.L. rookie of the year awards, and somehow manages to win the Gold Glove too!   The Cubs are finally the World Champs in 2015 ending a 106 year drought, just like Back to the Future predicted.  Twist: Joc Pederson, soaking wet, climbs out of the Ohio river, Bryant homerun ball in hand, during Bryant interview, Joc walks up to Bryant, hands him the wet ball, asks him to autograph it!

CHICubs,3dboot,jacksonvstheworld,0,Wed Jul 15 04:20:20 2015 UTC,I'm not disagreeing. I love the Theo plan.  But I think it's interesting how much success our minor league system has had over the last few years beyond the current roster and prospects
CHICubs,3dboot,MisterxRager,12,Wed Jul 15 04:27:13 2015 UTC,"Success? You kidding me?   2002: FOUR first round picks. None played a day in the majors.

Most successful major leaguer drafted: Sam Fuld.   2005: Mark Pawelek. 0 ML games. Most successful major leaguer drafted: Donnie Veal.   2006: Tyler Colvin.

CHICubs,3db3c6,Kaner_95,6,Tue Jul 14 22:08:25 2015 UTC,"Depends on who goes back the other way.  He has a 3.34 ERA WITH those 55 walks. His FIP is 2.92 (better than every starter BUT Arrieta), a 2.69 ERA away from Petco, and his WHIP is at a 3-year high (which will presumably come down with a .338 opponents BABIP)."
CHICubs,3db3c6,achap39,3,Tue Jul 14 22:38:17 2015 UTC,"Based on his results the past 2 years, his FIP, and control through 2017 I think he's a pretty great option for this team.  My main concern is that he's basically still just a 2 pitch pitcher.  I prefer him to Kazmir or Cashner, it just depends on the cost."
CHICubs,3db3c6,Sofnr,2,Tue Jul 14 23:34:17 2015 UTC,"Not a fan. If they're going to target SP, I wouldn't mind Kazmir from the A's, or a out of the box would be Matt Moore (probably not available though). Although Kazmir's injury may prevent Beane from getting fair value."
CHICubs,3db3c6,Sephiroth007,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:38:30 2015 UTC,I think Kazmir is fine. It sounds like a very minor / precautionary thing.
CHICubs,3db3c6,Blindward,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:39:41 2015 UTC,Well then hopefully Theo could snag him. I think he'd make a good number #3 or 4 depending on what you want to do with Hammel/Hendricks/Kazmir.
CHICubs,3db3c6,Sephiroth007,2,Tue Jul 14 23:50:25 2015 UTC,Isn't Kazmir more of a fly ball pitcher?
CHICubs,3db3c6,voidecho,2,Wed Jul 15 00:10:50 2015 UTC,Right price sure. He's a good pitcher. The walks aside.
CHICubs,3db3c6,dsalmon1449,2,Tue Jul 14 22:47:05 2015 UTC,I would like to get Ross. His stuff is good. See if the Bosio Wizard can help him.
CHICubs,3db3c6,0mousedog,2,Tue Jul 14 23:18:51 2015 UTC,Another reason why I would want him is so the Cubs hopefully don't end up over paying for an arm in the offseason and have them be a dud.
CHICubs,3db3c6,0mousedog,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:12:24 2015 UTC,i dont see cueto or price being a dud. im not that high on Zimmerman and shark tho
CHICubs,3db3c6,zrk23,2,Wed Jul 15 02:04:31 2015 UTC,Never been a fan. I think there are better arms out there to go for.
CHICubs,3db3c6,jacksonvstheworld,2,Tue Jul 14 22:20:46 2015 UTC,Only if Bosio & co. think they can do something about that WHIP. 55 BB in 110 innings doesn't look good.
CHICubs,3db3c6,HelloControl_,2,Tue Jul 14 22:20:49 2015 UTC,"Wait for David Price.  I get the feeling Hendricks is going to have a monster second half.  If anything, I'm getting one more arm for the bullpen to shorten the game ala the Royals last year.    If Maddon can call on Rondon, Motte, Ramirez, Grimm, and Soriano pans out, another arm means the back end of the rotation guys won't have to get much deeper than the sixth.  If they're in contention, Lester will start smelling postseason baseball and pitch better.  Arrieta's a dark horse Cy Young Candidate, and Hammel has been excellent. Wait for Price and load up the bullpen."
CHICubs,3db3c6,thefoolwhofollowshim,9,Tue Jul 14 22:48:13 2015 UTC,Ross wouldn't impede our ability to sign Price.

CHICubs,3d8vq9,BoringCode,13,Wed Jul 15 01:46:23 2015 UTC,"This sub is so ridiculous with how much they care about someone not enjoying the way the Cubs are playing and saying so. Especially because some of the same people complaining about it will rant with endless hyperbole about how any non-Cubs announcer is the worst announcer of all time, or how hyperbolically stating that negative users are making them never go to GDTs every again, and I mean it this time.  No one ever only says negative things, no one rants and rants the whole GDT about how terrible the Cubs are. People will get mad over Castro bobbling a ball, because he's an error machine, and instantly they're -5 and people are saying ""Calm down buddy, he's just a youngster. He'll figure it out.""   You guys really need to tone down your own drama and realize that when you're getting so pissed at someone expressing themselves, it's probably misplaced anger. You're likely just as frustrated as anyone else, but you're taking it out on the wrong person. Either way, stop focusing so much on someones negative comment and move on. It contributes to the discussion just as much as anyone else, if you actually want to engage in discussion and not go into a rage because someone isn't CJ'ing how all of this youth is only going to get better and that mistakes don't matter."
CHICubs,3d8vq9,Kirsch05,6,Tue Jul 14 13:05:33 2015 UTC,"By no means are we asking users to not post anything negative ever. What I (and I think most of the mod team) would like is for some of the more negative Nancy's to achieve some perspective.   We are 7 games above .500 going into the All-Star break, with a schedule the last month or so that was brutal. The past 4 years going into the break we've been 14, 9, 19, and 18 games under .500.

There are accounts created weekly for this purpose alone. Automod usually catches them quickly, but the people that paragraph is directed at aren't the guys bitching about Castro, it's directed at the guys who take it over the top."
CHICubs,3d8vq9,dewgazi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:47:23 2015 UTC,I do think we get both excessively negative and excessively counter-negative people on this sub. I think another way this subreddit could improve is remaining calm when other people have a different opinion about this team or its players. That's where I personally see a lot of the hyperbolics coming in.
CHICubs,3d8vq9,dewgazi,2,Tue Jul 14 21:42:32 2015 UTC,"You mean like when you downvoted everyone of my posts telling you why including Addison Russell in your ""most disappointing"" Cub poll was terrible?  Pot kettle black, dude."

CHICubs,3d8vq9,Sparx7,9,Wed Jul 15 02:26:01 2015 UTC,"Ledge to ledge is fine.  It's when we see lemmings hurl themselves off the ledge that it gets difficult.

""Castro GIDP again...I'm gonna go take a bath with my toaster!""  Things like that get a bit...tedious and bring down the mood of the rest of the sub.  Like I said, we're not asking you guys to not get upset about bad plays.  That's perfectly fine.  We're just seeing this huge downward spiral of negativity and it worries us."

That's not what downvotes are for, and that line of thinking is in fact part of the problem.

CHICubs,3d8vq9,zaikanekochan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:54:14 2015 UTC,"If someone is trolling, that is EXACTLY what downvotes are for. To drive the popular opinions to the top and bury the unpopular ones (as determined by the community as a whole.) That section in parentheses, that's the crux of the argument. Mods aren't elected officials and do not speak for the masses. Allow the masses to police themselves. In my experience in GDTs, folks who act like jerks are quickly downvoted and are brought in line.  As for downvoting histories, this is a Reddit issue, not an r/chicubs issue. You can't fix problems like this with a bleeding heart plea. The folks you are trying to police aren't going to give two craps about this post. The only people who are going to be receptive to this post are those who wouldn't be involved in the behavior you're describing to begin with.  TL;DR Let the community police itself without becoming the thought police."

And for that reason, I am glad Kris picked his dad to throw.  Really was happy with everything all around.    Besides, how were either of them gonna beat Frazier?"
CHICubs,3d766c,Trakis,12,Tue Jul 14 14:42:17 2015 UTC,"I loved when he was calling his dad to start throwing. It means nothing, it was great.   edit:typo"
CHICubs,3d766c,designgoddess,0,Tue Jul 14 03:42:05 2015 UTC,For real. So many pitches at his knees. Kris loves the high middle-in pitch. He was golfing those swings.
CHICubs,3d766c,TheRealSgtPepper,19,Tue Jul 14 01:47:56 2015 UTC,When Kris and his father were interviewed before the derby they mentioned Kris had asked his dad to give them to him low and in. His Dad was doing a pretty good job.
CHICubs,3d766c,StressedOut_Student,3,Tue Jul 14 03:38:52 2015 UTC,I didn't catch that interview! That's interesting. I just remember Kris' long bombs being up a little more. I could be wrong.
CHICubs,3d766c,TheRealSgtPepper,2,Tue Jul 14 04:14:22 2015 UTC,Their strategy was to avoid long bombs. They want 15 1st row shots. No sense in wasting a ton of energy on 500 ft. bombs. Especially since they changed the rules last minute.
CHICubs,3d766c,jonsie19,18,Tue Jul 14 15:21:09 2015 UTC,Ugh. The ESPN announcers are the worst.
CHICubs,3d766c,decitertiember,6,Tue Jul 14 02:30:59 2015 UTC,I turned it off after Bryant and Rizzo were done.   I couldn't  stand Berman.
CHICubs,3d766c,thebaconfever,18,Tue Jul 14 02:59:49 2015 UTC,you missed a hell of a HR derby
CHICubs,3d766c,demerdar,3,Tue Jul 14 03:21:50 2015 UTC,True statement. I wasn't very keen on the new format (mainly due to our guys being out) but those last couple rounds (particularly the finals) were freaking sweet.  Definitely enjoyed it.
CHICubs,3d766c,Kirsch05,2,Tue Jul 14 11:43:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I thought it was poorly planned at first, but it turned out awesome. The Frazier comeback against Fielder sold me and I enjoyed the rest of the night...And it was done before 11!"
CHICubs,3d766c,THEriot2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:34:35 2015 UTC,"Do you think that they will change the rules again next year? If it weren't for the rain, it would have lasted a lot longer."
CHICubs,3d766c,jonsie19,2,Tue Jul 14 15:23:17 2015 UTC,"Well, the rounds were supposed to be 5 mins. I don't think they'll do that next year. This year's rounds proved to be plenty. The hitters were GASSED, and rightfully so, there's a reason you only take 8 cuts at a time in BP.  I think the rules will be mostly the same with a couple tweaks maybe. The last pitch, ball in the air, and bonus time may see slight changes. I hope the general idea stays the same though because that was really fun."
CHICubs,3d766c,THEriot2,2,Tue Jul 14 15:36:11 2015 UTC,"I agree. I this homers in the last-minute stop the clock is a cool idea, but maybe too much time. Maybe cut it to like 45 seconds or something?"
CHICubs,3d766c,jonsie19,11,Tue Jul 14 16:02:00 2015 UTC,When is Berman going to be done. His act is tiresome to me.

On top of that, Bryant is a rookie and was going against Pujols, one of the best hitters of our generation. Cut him some slack.   He got to the big stage as a rookie and had his dad throw to him.

CHICubs,3d5z0w,MagnusLoverBoy,5,Tue Jul 14 05:41:43 2015 UTC,"The Cubs, following an age old pattern under Tribune corporate ownership,  decided it didn't want to keep Sammy (who was an ageing prima donna, to be sure) and so set about savaging his reputation in the local media in order to inoculate the team brand from the consequences of the move. A lot of Cub fans bought it, and it ruined Sosa's relationship with the city. Many Cub fans today hate Sosa and don't really even know why.   Under the ownership of the Ricketts there's been a detente of sorts, but Sosa is reputedly unwilling to simply forget it all and come back into the fold. I still hope they put a statue of him up and retire his number."

CHICubs,3d5z0w,zrk23,6,Tue Jul 14 01:21:29 2015 UTC,Wrigleyville went fucking insane after that HR to tie it with 2 outs in the 9th.  Oh man I can't wait until we finally win one.
CHICubs,3d5z0w,Sparx7,4,Tue Jul 14 03:40:40 2015 UTC,2nd loudest ever. i think the loudest was wood's Homer in the game that shall not be named
CHICubs,3d5z0w,Artimus_Dubski,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:32:18 2015 UTC,Game 2  was louder.  Winning  12-3 at one point the Marlins pitcher (I can't remember who) messed up so bad on a pitch he threw it into the dug out.  Place was insane
CHICubs,3d5z0w,RoughRiders9,6,Tue Jul 14 15:18:47 2015 UTC,"Hard to believe that was almost 12 years ago! While things didn't end the way that I would have liked them to, he's still one of my favorite Cubs of all-time. I spent most of my childhood going to games that  he played in and he was always my favorite player."

CHICubs,3d5z0w,ilovelamp42,6,Mon Jul 13 21:25:22 2015 UTC,"I love how he ran the bases. In today's game, in a moment like that, a player would have showed off a bit, or done something. He ran the bases like it was another day at the office"

CHICubs,3d5z0w,imanganPDT,2,Mon Jul 13 22:28:16 2015 UTC,I miss the hell out of him great memory from my childhood. Any of you fellow cub fans know where I can buy a Chicago Cubs  sosa jersey?
CHICubs,3d5z0w,airoderinde,2,Mon Jul 13 23:20:03 2015 UTC,try aliexpress! A lot of fans here (including me) have had nothing but a good experience with them.
CHICubs,3d5z0w,zrk23,3,Tue Jul 14 06:13:02 2015 UTC,This man is the reason I got into baseball and the Cubs. I don't care how it ended anymore.
CHICubs,3d5z0w,joftheinternet,3,Tue Jul 14 02:50:49 2015 UTC,its crazy how he stands waaay of the plate. never saw anyone with that stance. and HR #2 gotta be the longest ever in wrigley and one the longest ever in baseball
CHICubs,3d5z0w,drnick954,2,Tue Jul 14 05:37:30 2015 UTC,"Sammy is the reason I became a Cubs fan.  I don't know how to reconcile what I felt then for how I feel now, but I wish I could."
CHICubs,3d5z0w,sels_jake,2,Tue Jul 14 10:09:04 2015 UTC,I'm nearly tearing up just seeing Wrigley go that crazy. Lot of fun to watch when I was 11.

CHICubs,3d7xk3,RustyDarkstar76,3,Tue Jul 14 21:48:02 2015 UTC,"No benefit. The players will already go to the guys they feel are the most ""captain-like"" as leaders."
CHICubs,3d7xk3,THEriot2,2,Tue Jul 14 13:24:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel like giving someone the 'C' is more about trying to get that player to act more like a leader rather than getting the team to follow that individual. It just doesn't feel necessary."

CHICubs,3d7xk3,Sparx7,4,Tue Jul 14 12:37:02 2015 UTC,Edwin Jackson?

CHICubs,3d5yzs,weatherninja,4,Tue Jul 14 02:38:15 2015 UTC,Congrats to Todd Frazier. That was an exciting derby!
CHICubs,3d5yzs,dshribes7,2,Tue Jul 14 02:35:45 2015 UTC,"Ok. I like this format now. Aside from the fact that rizzo had to go first. But if it couldnt be one of our boys, im glad it was frazier"
CHICubs,3d5yzs,ilovelamp42,3,Tue Jul 14 02:35:37 2015 UTC,WOOOOO FRAZIER!!!

CHICubs,3d5yzs,voidecho,2,Tue Jul 14 02:30:56 2015 UTC,Pedersons going to hit 10 HR max in 2nd half of the season.  The curse.
CHICubs,3d5yzs,Twospoons,3,Tue Jul 14 02:23:29 2015 UTC,The meeting between Pujols and Pederson and brother was awesome to see.

CHICubs,3d5yzs,canhazbob,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:44:07 2015 UTC,Man as soon as that ball touches Frazier is getting another pitch. Smooth
CHICubs,3d5yzs,jp611,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:42:11 2015 UTC,WTF IS THIS CAMERA
CHICubs,3d5yzs,THEriot2,2,Tue Jul 14 01:41:26 2015 UTC,Well I hope Frazier wins now.
CHICubs,3d5yzs,THEriot2,0,Tue Jul 14 01:40:34 2015 UTC,I'd rather be that've Rizzo and Bryant hit 2 yabos apiece in the ASG anyways.
CHICubs,3d5yzs,TheEsteemedMrLorre,0,Tue Jul 14 01:38:47 2015 UTC,There goes the satellite signal. That might have to be it for me.
CHICubs,3d5yzs,THEriot2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:36:25 2015 UTC,Anybody else feel like Bryant's dad was not the right choice to get quick and good pitches to try to win this thing but also really glad he went with him anyway?
CHICubs,3d5yzs,Sofnr,7,Tue Jul 14 01:31:37 2015 UTC,I'm sure having that experience with his dad means way more to him than winning. Good for him and good for his dad.
CHICubs,3d5yzs,jaj040,5,Tue Jul 14 01:35:42 2015 UTC,I think having the moment with his dad was a higher priority for him then winning his first home run derby.  He looked like he had fun.  I'm glad he did it.  I've seen a few people get mad at these guys.  Fans should be happy they were willing to participate. Most stars aren't anymore.
CHICubs,3d5yzs,fender-b-bender,6,Tue Jul 14 01:35:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Allstar week is about more than doing everything to win. It's about enjoying the experience."
CHICubs,3d5yzs,JCardCubs,2,Tue Jul 14 01:34:28 2015 UTC,"Should of gotten E Jax or Wood to pitch to him, we know they know how to give up homers :(  But yeah, it was a really cool thing to be able to see father pitching to son."
CHICubs,3d5yzs,JCardCubs,2,Tue Jul 14 01:33:29 2015 UTC,Look at the shift in the outfield!!
CHICubs,3d5yzs,weatherninja,4,Tue Jul 14 01:30:54 2015 UTC,No doubt that Maddon is super proud of these boys. Total class acts.
CHICubs,3d5yzs,glberns,10,Tue Jul 14 01:30:33 2015 UTC,Still glad to have seen our boys in it. Good show and lots of class.
CHICubs,3d5yzs,THEriot2,2,Tue Jul 14 01:29:32 2015 UTC,"They should make it that the extra time stacks and is done after the 2nd batter hits.  So, if you hit 4 HR further than 425 you get 60 seconds rather than 30."
CHICubs,3d5yzs,glberns,2,Tue Jul 14 01:29:31 2015 UTC,That's how it was prior to the rule change this afternoon because of the storm rolling in. The rounds were originally 5 minutes too.
CHICubs,3d5yzs,Restroom406,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:32:17 2015 UTC,Wasn't sure if it was stackable originally. But I don't think they were going to have them do the bonus after the 2nd batter

CHICubs,3d5yzs,RCoombs77,3,Tue Jul 14 01:27:07 2015 UTC,"This format is exciting, but it seems like if you go 1st, you lose.  Too easy for the 2nd guy knowing exactly how many they need."
CHICubs,3d5yzs,THEriot2,3,Tue Jul 14 01:35:39 2015 UTC,Keep the timed aspect but get rid of the bracket?
CHICubs,3d5yzs,RCoombs77,3,Tue Jul 14 01:26:56 2015 UTC,"The head to heads the best part. The Frazier v Fielder was awesome. I don't think we can say the guy hitting 2nd has an advantage after a sample of 4....and the exact same constraints. Maybe our guys just lost. Plus, even if there is an advantage, why shouldn't the guys who hit the most home runs in the first half have a small advantage...in the home run derby."
CHICubs,3d5yzs,THEriot2,2,Tue Jul 14 01:27:32 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree I thought about it again and had the same thoughts

CHICubs,3d5yzs,Sparx7,2,Tue Jul 14 01:26:54 2015 UTC,I love seeing all the players acting like normal guys and hanging out with each other and their kids.
CHICubs,3d5yzs,THEriot2,4,Tue Jul 14 01:26:48 2015 UTC,True class by Bryant and Rizzo after too. Love seeing that
CHICubs,3d5yzs,getdatgoat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:26:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's really nice to have these guys representing the organization as star players instead of some of the assholes we've had in the past.

CHICubs,3d5yzs,THEriot2,-1,Tue Jul 14 01:26:43 2015 UTC,Based on a sample of 4.
CHICubs,3d5yzs,Tjagra,0,Tue Jul 14 01:26:06 2015 UTC,"And what's the advantage, then? Knowing how many you have to hit? Oh that's a huge advantage.  And for whatever small advantage that may provide, what's wrong with giving that to the guys who...were better home run hitter the first half? Our guys lost. It's okay."
CHICubs,3d5yzs,THEriot2,2,Tue Jul 14 01:27:11 2015 UTC,"Well, time to turn off the derby now."
CHICubs,3d5yzs,Slednvrfed,0,Tue Jul 14 01:42:57 2015 UTC,I'll keep rooting for Frazier. No other baseball on.
CHICubs,3d5yzs,Restroom406,0,Tue Jul 14 13:18:27 2015 UTC,Cubs are out already.  Time to tune out.

CHICubs,3d5yzs,fender-b-bender,0,Tue Jul 14 01:25:59 2015 UTC,He's a great guy too. There's a story or two a year about how genuine and nice he is and how much he gives back. Google the one about him and their bat boy if you haven't heard about it already.
CHICubs,3d5yzs,Bob2456,3,Tue Jul 14 01:25:44 2015 UTC,"Damn, you really don't realize how big Bryant is until he stands next to Pujols and almost dwarfs him."

CHICubs,3d5yzs,yung_wolf,26,Tue Jul 14 01:28:29 2015 UTC,I really like how the only two players to congratulate the person that beat them are Bryant and Rizzo. Way to represent the organization with class.
CHICubs,3d5yzs,THEriot2,2,Tue Jul 14 01:31:14 2015 UTC,Tbf Frazier basically ran off the field after he was done.
CHICubs,3d5yzs,j4callen,6,Tue Jul 14 01:25:37 2015 UTC,"Well, it was nice to enjoy the derby for the first time in years. And our guys conducted themselves with class and they'll be around the ASG for years to come."

CHICubs,3d5yzs,Kodyak77,4,Tue Jul 14 01:28:17 2015 UTC,Looked like it hit zero to me.. espn not even mentioning how close it was ok...
CHICubs,3d5yzs,prettymotherfcker,3,Tue Jul 14 01:25:30 2015 UTC,He would have still had bonus time though.
CHICubs,3d5yzs,Kodyak77,3,Tue Jul 14 01:25:27 2015 UTC,I thought that was only if you hit one 450 feet
CHICubs,3d5yzs,Frampton,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:25:26 2015 UTC,a player will earn an extra 30 seconds of time for any home run measured at 475 feet or more and will earn an extra minute of time by hitting two home runs each measuring 420 feet or more
CHICubs,3d5yzs,an_abyss_in_motion,2,Tue Jul 14 01:25:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so do the bonus time then ya know, oh well, was fun."

CHICubs,3d4lyo,catch10110,9,Mon Jul 13 16:14:45 2015 UTC,Yeah...new rules this year.  You have five minutes to hit as many HR's as possible.  If you hit homers over a certain distance you get bonus time.  If your pitcher can't hit the zone you're not going to win.
CHICubs,3d4lyo,voidecho,2,Mon Jul 13 16:18:45 2015 UTC,Wow. That is really stupid.

Minor league baseball implemented clocks this year and i think it's absurd."

Minor league baseball implemented clocks this year and i think it's absurd.   They've got 'em at big league parks, too. It's just the changing landscape of the game and the clocks don't effect gameplay, like the minor league pitch clocks, just down time. I've got no problem with reducing the increased downtime we've seen as a result of more specialization (more substitutions) and more revenue entering the game."
CHICubs,3d4lyo,THEriot2,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:42:12 2015 UTC,"Because it was taking so long they were losing interest and money in an event that is specifically designed to general interest and money?   So then you don't think it's just for fun.  I am skeptical the connection you are drawing is real. When asked last year why the HR derby has to take 3 hours, Bud Selig said ""Television wants a three-hour program."" They wanted it to be that long. The HR derby is ESPN's highest rated event every summer (except during world cup years), why would they want to cut it shorter?   Regardless, if everyone suddenly thinks 3 hours is too long, there are better ways than changing the entire format and introducing clocks. I honestly don't think the issue is that the hitters are taking too long to do what we are paying to see them do...there is just so much bullshit going on in between hitters. Address all that crap if you want to shorten the event.     Minor league baseball implemented clocks this year and i think it's absurd.   They've got 'em at big league parks, too.    I'm not sure if i'm reading you right, but MLB does not have the pitch clocks that MiLB now does.    It's just the changing landscape of the game and the clocks don't effect gameplay, like the minor league pitch clocks, just down time.    Right...If you want to limit the time between innings, that's fine...although I don't ever recall seeing this be a huge issue. The problem is that even this does have an effect on game play. If the batter or pitcher is not ready to go at the right time after the inning break, the count starts at 0-1 or 1-0.    I've got no problem with reducing the increased downtime we've seen as a result of more specialization (more substitutions) and more revenue entering the game.   MiLB has a pitching change clock, but as of now, MLB does not. Again, this has never really seemed like a huge issue to me either.  I honestly don't ever remember a pitching change taking obscenely long once the RP steps onto the field.   At the end of the day, it's just a HR derby so i don't really care that much...i just don't like the trend. In my mind, nothing in baseball should really be against the clock."
CHICubs,3d4lyo,catch10110,2,Mon Jul 13 18:57:40 2015 UTC,"So then you don't think it's just for fun.   Well, no. It's for fun for us and the players. For the league, it's all about money and providing the best product...like with any other business.   I am skeptical the connection you are drawing is real.   Well, MLB's press release says so.   The HR derby is ESPN's highest rated event every summer (except during world cup years), why would they want to cut it shorter?   Because it's been losing viewers quickly. Last year's was the lowest rated Derby since 2003.   Regardless, if everyone suddenly thinks 3 hours is too long, there are better ways than changing the entire format and introducing clocks.   And I'm sure MLB explored them and deemed they weren't better.   there is just so much bullshit going on in between hitters. Address all that crap if you want to shorten the event.   Plenty of people who tune in for the Derby, the average viewer, love that stuff. Again, $$$   I'm not sure if i'm reading you right, but MLB does not have the pitch clocks that MiLB now does.   MLB does not have a pitch clock. They do have clocks this season, though. Fairly sure it's just before in between innings. Think it's 2:25 for a normal game and 20 seconds more for a nationally televised game.    If you want to limit the time between innings, that's fine...although I don't ever recall seeing this be a huge issue.   I think that's a huge reason for the increase of game times the past couple decades. That along with more pitches/time in between pitches due to new/advanced approaches both at the plate and on the rubber. I agree, though, I don't have a problem with the pace of play on the diamond.    The problem is that even this does have an effect on game play.   That's fine. It's not the way the game's meant to be played. The game can change, that's fine, but we don't need more than 2.5 minutes to toss the allotted 8 warmup pitches. By slowing this down over the years, we have, in fact, changed the game when we hadn't needed to. This is about putting it back.   I honestly don't ever remember a pitching change taking obscenely long once the RP steps onto the field.   Yeah, I agree again, basically. But there's never need for a 5 minute pitching change after a mound visit, the catcher visiting the mound, the pitcher taking more time between pitches, etc. They already slow the game down so much in the late innings in the name of strategy that it may need to be more closely regulated. I don't particularly care either way, but I see the merits. There's no need to waste 10-15 minutes just changing pitchers in a single half inning. Crap like this has happened and it's driven the casual viewer away as well as a lot of young fans. Now, I'm considered a young fan (at least I still think I am), and it again, it doesn't bother me, I'll watch no matter what. But it definitely has had an effect on the sport's fanbase. One of the underrated issues the game is facing, in my opinion, is the aging fanbase. Baseball's average fan is the older man. I think the average baseball fan is like 54 years old, but I won't pull a source on that. Something needs to be done about that. And I think we've already seen changes and will continue to see changes that are at least subliminally, if not explicitly, about addressing this issue.   At the end of the day, it's just a HR derby so i don't really care that much   Yeah, me either. What the hell else are we gonna blabber about on an off-day?   In my mind, nothing in baseball should really be against the clock.   In short, I 100% agree with the sentiment. I just don't think it matches the reality.

CHICubs,3d4lyo,catch10110,4,Mon Jul 13 22:08:23 2015 UTC,I always thought the 10 outs concept was stupid. If a batter gets tired he can just sit there and watch five pitches go by before he decides to swing again. I'm hoping this makes the derby more exciting.

CHICubs,3d5oh5,IBleedBlueBlood,4,Mon Jul 13 18:58:27 2015 UTC,He's owed so much that I wouldn't offer more than a couple of fringe prospects and just take on all the salary.
CHICubs,3d5oh5,pm_me_ur_pajamas,2,Mon Jul 13 22:42:08 2015 UTC,I think that's the key this year.  Don't give up too much at the deadline.  Try to plug a few holes with short term salary and go after the free agent market in the off-season.
CHICubs,3d5oh5,Rearden_Steel,8,Tue Jul 14 13:16:47 2015 UTC,"Look it's great that the bullpen has been solid but the reality is that right now you have one guy out there who has pitched when the lights are bright, that's Motte. Maybe Soriano but he's a wildcard in my opinion. Adding a guy like papelbon makes the bullpen one of the best in baseball with two guys at the back end who have closed out world series. Much more comfortable with that than a bunch of unknowns."
CHICubs,3d5oh5,TheFakeTimShady,3,Mon Jul 13 20:06:10 2015 UTC,Do we need papelbon though? Our bullpen has been really solid for the most part.

CHICubs,3d5oh5,THEriot2,2,Mon Jul 13 20:21:28 2015 UTC,"I can't say I wouldn't be excited if we got him because of another arm to have in the pen. With that said, my first option would be to give them money. They can't touch anyone in the MLB for us or our top 5 prospects. I'd give up Olt for him."
CHICubs,3d5oh5,Dhash23,2,Mon Jul 13 20:33:47 2015 UTC,"I'd probably give up Olt, but I wouldn't give up much for him. It just doesn't match what we need to do and if his option vests, that would suck. He needs 19 games finished for it to vest, so we would just have to not close him. But then you're paying a lot for a reliever. That doesn't matter for part of a season. Until we get another MLBPA bullshit story about purposely not letting him close to avoid the option."
CHICubs,3d5oh5,THEriot2,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:54:20 2015 UTC,Can you explain what the 19 games thing is? I'm not familiar with that.
CHICubs,3d5oh5,Dhash23,5,Mon Jul 13 21:04:59 2015 UTC,"He has a vesting option for 2016. It's worth $13 million and vests if he either finishes 50 games in 2015, or 100 in 2014-2015. He finished 52 games in 2014 so he had to finish 48 this year for it to vest. He's currently at 29 games finish so he has 19 left for the option to vest.  Edit: He would actually have to finish 55 games for it to vest on this year alone, but that's a moot point since he finished so many games last year."
CHICubs,3d5oh5,THEriot2,2,Mon Jul 13 21:08:58 2015 UTC,Does anyone know the specifics of what the Phillies want for him? I've heard they wanted too much but don't know what that is.
CHICubs,3d5oh5,cunt_piss,2,Mon Jul 13 20:18:15 2015 UTC,Papelbon for Alcantara.
CHICubs,3d5oh5,achap39,8,Mon Jul 13 19:39:36 2015 UTC,I don't think we would even have to give up that much since we'd probably take on his salary
CHICubs,3d5oh5,nlmuvaney,0,Mon Jul 13 22:29:07 2015 UTC,I wouldn't even think about doing that given the recent success of our 'pen.
CHICubs,3d5oh5,THEriot2,5,Mon Jul 13 19:58:54 2015 UTC,"Really? At this point, I don't see Mendy as anything more than trade bait. And Papelbon is a great addition no matter how great our bullpen is."
CHICubs,3d5oh5,RunningJokes,2,Mon Jul 13 21:27:09 2015 UTC,"I could really do without adding Papelbon. The marginal return is very little, and in truth probably negative. You accept that late in a contending season, to a point, but not to add a reliever you don't really need."

The young guys are getting experience, and we're winning ball games. This season is a vast improvement over years past. This was not originally the year the Cubs were supposed to start competing, but the development of the prospects went much better than anticipated. As long as we're making the playoffs and competing for the world series for the next 5 or so seasons, then I will certainly look back at this season as a success."

CHICubs,3d5ygl,SoonerJDB,11,Mon Jul 13 20:08:23 2015 UTC,"Personally, all I ask is that the team puts everything on the line through the very end. Whether that means missing the playoffs, losing in the wild card play-in, or actually winning a series in the playoffs, those won't be my barometer for success. Yeah, they'll obviously be important to my personal enjoyment of the season, but objectively I have to look at this season as the year of growing pains. We all expected it going in. We've already experienced some of it with how the bats have cooled off as of late. But beyond that, the team has been outplaying preseason expectations and I already think that's a success."
CHICubs,3d5ygl,RunningJokes,9,Mon Jul 13 21:24:34 2015 UTC,If we make the playoffs I'll blow a load.  Coming in I expected to be a few games over .500 and compete for a wild card.  They're surpassing my expectations

Three of our young stars are getting valuable experience this year which should only help going forward.

There's half a season left. A lot can happen. Remember 2004? We had a better record that season than we did in 2003 and we didn't make the playoffs, missing out on the 2nd to last game of the season.   One game at a time kids. A lot can happen from now until September. My expectations are just that. To make this a success, take  this one game at a time and focus on what is going on now. Don't look to far into the future.  All this playoffs talk about making the playoffs is nice but let's not set any expectations. Young team. Learning as they go. Yeah they're doing good, but shit takes time to build itself into a powerhouse.   To make this a success, you need patience."

CHICubs,3d4hkn,jonsie19,3,Mon Jul 13 20:47:37 2015 UTC,What about Castro making a move to CF.  He's certainly athletic enough and they say a SS can play any position on the field.  With a full spring to work on defense out there I think it could work.

CHICubs,3d4hkn,salmonwango,3,Mon Jul 13 15:22:08 2015 UTC,You're probably right.  The fact he and Montero are both lefties kind of hurts us in the near-term for platooning.
CHICubs,3d4hkn,gfcolli,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:25:08 2015 UTC,"The FO would find room for the bat if they thought he wouldn't be such a defensive detriment. His bat probably plays in the OF even with defense, but at that point you're not getting enough excess value to forego or deter his development as a catcher. As a catcher that is even average defensively, he has perennial MVP-discussion potential.  I think the scenario where he reaches the bigs for good the quickest is one where he plays everyday, or as everyday as a responsible organization these days would allow. He gets about 45-55 games at catcher, with Montero resting vs most LHP, and 80-100 in LF. Depending on how it looks at that point, you carry any extra OF or an extra catcher since Schwarber would give you some flexibility there."
CHICubs,3d4hkn,RaveOn1958,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:25:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah...that'd probably give him the quickest path.  He learns at the MLB level from Montero.  He'd learn catcher slower, but it'd also save his legs a bit only playing 50 games a year at catcher.  He was recruited to Indiana as an OF so that's his ""natural"" position.    I want him at catcher long term.  It would be such an advantage to have that bat at catcher."
CHICubs,3d4hkn,jonsie19,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:46:08 2015 UTC,"That's the plan that I hope they go with, and I think there's a pretty good chance that ends up happening. I still don't think he makes the Opening Day roster or is in a Bryant ""wait 12 days"" situation. It's just not the same situation."
CHICubs,3d4hkn,gfcolli,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:55:39 2015 UTC,Does his contract have that arbitration clause like Bryant's did?
CHICubs,3d4hkn,Rudas_Iskariot,2,Mon Jul 13 21:00:39 2015 UTC,"The only thing I can think of that you're talking about is Super 2 status. In that case, yes, every player has that. It's collectively bargained. It didn't effect the timing of Bryant's callup, though. Bryant will be a Super 2. The timing was just about keeping up from accruing a full year of service time so we would effectively control him for 7 years instead of 6. To mitigate this disadvantage to the player, they become eligible for a 4th year of arbitration instead of 3 (the super 2 year). That's not the only reason for Super 2, but it serves as a large reason."
CHICubs,3d4hkn,gfcolli,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:07:15 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't moving Castro to third or second as these first responses suggest just mess with his and lead to even more mistakes? Unless someone wants to give us a decent piece back in trade, let's just leave him where he is. Also hoping to see Wada with a permanent spot in the rotation next year."
CHICubs,3d4hkn,Rudas_Iskariot,4,Mon Jul 13 14:59:41 2015 UTC,"If he's not capable of playing 3B or 2B then he's not mentally strong enough to be on this team.  Both Russell and Baez have had no issues (none that we've heard of) learning new positions.  You'd hope the more experienced Castro could handle it.    That being said, I wouldn't be opposed to leaving him there and having Baez at 3B and Russell at 2B.  Whatever the coaches think is the best team on the field.  They know way better than me."

CHICubs,3d21lm,penguinopph,10,Sun Jul 12 22:19:55 2015 UTC,His bat is major league ready. It has been for a while. The issue is getting reps at C. The only way he's brought up is if Theo & co decide they want to go for it this season and put his defensive development on hold.
CHICubs,3d21lm,SoonerJDB,9,Sun Jul 12 22:38:12 2015 UTC,Or if Miggy goes down to the DL and we decide that Schwarber will learn on the job for a couple of weeks.

I was doing an internship for Fox Sports covering the I-Cubs in 2006 when Pie was the young guy and the next big Cub.   I bought big on rookie cards and autographs. The kid had all the tools to succeed it seemed. He hit .280 or higher at every level he was at for more than a few games. He hit .283/.341 as a 21 yr old kid at AAA. Solid defense, good projections, what wasnt to like?  IMO what killed his chances at ever really making it big was the way the Cubs brought him up and messed with his progress in 2007. Dusty didnt like playing rookies, everyone knew that, and Pie wasnt much different. It seemed like he was constantly getting the start/stop treatment and he never really got to where his potential said he could go.  Some of that is on him, maybe most of it, but the Cubs didnt do much to help their #1 prospect succeed IMO. I blame it on the win now culture that Hendry was subjected to which completely burned down the farm system."

CHICubs,3d8vkn,aussum_possum,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:46:23 2015 UTC,"Glad to help. I think the biggest issue was that when Zell and Co bought the Trib (and by default the Cubs) it was rumored that he told Hendry to build a winner at all costs, which meant that '07 couldnt be the year to break in the new kid. It was crazy, go back and look at the trades that were made from the time Zell bought the company and sold it. It was a short time.  Josh Donaldson, Angel Pagan, and Omar Infante were all traded at this point for veterans. They werent huge world beaters, but they were prospects (or guys with potential, as Infante was picked up and traded in the same offseason) none the less. Really, other than Rich Harden, none of those deals really worked out (though Clay Rapada had a nice little career as a submarine throwing bullpen guy with various clubs)."

CHICubs,3d688u,THEriot2,-2,Mon Jul 13 21:54:47 2015 UTC,Castro being an all star is so irrelevant so can we quit bringing that up? Please like really why is that always said?  It's not like he is a great defender either.
CHICubs,3d688u,YourCummyBear,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:09:22 2015 UTC,"Castro being an all star is so irrelevant so can we quit bringing that up? Please like really why is that always said?   'cuz it's something worth mentioning.  How many SS out there didn't make any all star games?  How much do you love saying Rizzo & Bryant are all stars?    Let's not forget that plaques in the HoF mention All star apperances too......(Not that Castrs going there).  It's an accomplishment, just 'cuz you may not care for him it does show his value."
CHICubs,3d688u,RustyDarkstar76,2,Tue Jul 14 00:36:45 2015 UTC,But bryant and rizzo both have a higher war just half way through the year than castro has ever even had in a season.  The guy has regressed the past few years. I could see if he was an all-star this year but he isn't. Sports should be about what you've done lately except in extreme cases.  You guys will still be trying to defend castro even if his average falls another 20 points and he's still a negative player.
CHICubs,3d688u,YourCummyBear,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:23:29 2015 UTC,"The guy has regressed the past few years   He's also only 25 and he has had big hits when needed.  Sports shouldn't be ""hat you've done lately"" if that were true George Brett would never had mad it outa AAA."
CHICubs,3d688u,RustyDarkstar76,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:10:28 2015 UTC,"Because in this context it's completely relevant. When assessing his value or worth it's not, but that's not what we're doing is it.   It's not like he is a great defender either.   Who the hell has ever said he was?"
CHICubs,3d688u,THEriot2,0,Tue Jul 14 13:17:28 2015 UTC,It doesn't help asses his freaking value at when it was years ago and the guy has never even been a 4 win player.  Some of your other points were on but him being an all star years ago is irrelevant. Heck the phillies could play the same card with Ryan Howard right? Let's trade a haul for a-rod look how many mvps and all-star appearances he has.
CHICubs,3d688u,YourCummyBear,2,Tue Jul 14 13:52:38 2015 UTC,"You said:   It doesn't help asses his freaking value   After I said:   Because in this context it's completely relevant. When assessing his value or worth it's not   So I think you may have misunderstood me. I'm not defending Castro's play at all. I got a lot of flak earlier in the season for jumping on him before it was popular. I was a hipster Castro critic.   Some of your other points were on but him being an all star years ago is irrelevant.   It's completely relevant when managing a team full of competitive, world class athletes and managing your organization so that it is attractive to future world class athletes you'd like to add. It's also relevant when handling assess how a 21 year old will handle the pressures of big league ball. Russell is already struggling with the bat, don't put any added pressure on him mid-season especially when it could (potentially, I don't think this would be the case) cause a rift of some sort in the clubhouse.   I'm a huge stat guy, but we always have to remember there's more to the game than that. A manager's biggest job is managing personalities and the clubhouse. Keeping the atmosphere loose, but serious. Keeping employees in a state where they can perform their best. Managers definitely add value with in-game decisions, but I think they actually have far less impact that way than most think. Often, the best decision is to sit back and let the best players in the world do their thing.   Heck the phillies could play the same card with Ryan Howard right? Let's trade a haul for a-rod look how many mvps and all-star appearances he has.   Again, I was not talking about value. The reasons for keeping Castro at short over Russell have nothing to do with skill or trade value. On paper Russell is 100% the better option at short, and I look forward to watching him play there next year. It's 100% intangible, but still meritorious."
CHICubs,3d688u,THEriot2,3,Tue Jul 14 15:31:10 2015 UTC,You're right I'm sorry I misread.
CHICubs,3d688u,YourCummyBear,2,Tue Jul 14 15:33:25 2015 UTC,"Not a problem, I'm not poet.  Edit: I'm no poet. Case in point."
CHICubs,3d688u,THEriot2,2,Tue Jul 14 15:36:22 2015 UTC,"Those are the kinds of changes you make in the offseason, not in the middle of the season. Castro and Russell have both been struggling at the plate, no need to get them out of their rhythm in the field also. Doesn't have to be a lefty. There's too many options for me to list. Cueto is gonna cost a lot for a rental since he's in division and also the Cubs are looking at a wild card game at best. Don't sell the farm for a one game playoff, that's insane. Montero is way too slow for outfield and Schwarber is just not good enough behind the plate yet to play catcher in the majors."
CHICubs,3d688u,jmr33090,3,Mon Jul 13 22:01:42 2015 UTC,Makes sense. Hopefully Russell starts next year at SS. I wasn't thinking about Cueto for a rental - I was thinking in the off-season. Thoughts?
CHICubs,3d688u,jmr33090,7,Mon Jul 13 22:52:09 2015 UTC,"Oh, in the offseason yeah, I'd take a flyer, but I'm looking at Price first."
CHICubs,3d688u,inevitablescape,3,Mon Jul 13 23:05:51 2015 UTC,"Why isn't Russell playing SS and Castro 2nd right now?                 Because none of us are Joe/Theo.                As for Montero being in the outfield, I'm not sure if he is fast enough to cover ground."
CHICubs,3d688u,inevitablescape,2,Mon Jul 13 21:19:01 2015 UTC,I guess I haven't seen Montero run enough. Benefit of being a catcher I guess.
CHICubs,3d688u,TooLebowski,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:24:05 2015 UTC,Yeah. Its tough to know how fast he can run. Running the bases can give you some insight
CHICubs,3d688u,SwankDR,3,Mon Jul 13 21:26:08 2015 UTC,"You don't change their position mid season.  Especially if they're just flopping positions.  Alcantara, Baez. Olt, and LaStella aren't exactly beating down the door right now, so you keep the lineup as is and make the change in the offseason. We'd be really stupid to go after a big name pitcher, knowing in all likely hood we'd have to give up a lot of talent to gamble on a single wild card game.  Ask Billy Beane if you have any second thoughts about that one.  If we get another SP it's a lot more likely to be a cheaper arm and not someone we literally sell the farm to go after. People don't talk about Cueto because no one wants to think about that piece of shit wearing their teams' uniform. Catchers are not outfielders.  If a catcher is gonna take a fielding position it's bound to be 1st(Mauer, Posey).  Montero would be a liability in the outfield, and frankly it would be an insult to change his position.  Kyle's best chances in the near future, barring injuries is to win the job as backup next year over Ross and be the first bat off the bench.  This is a win win win as it gives them a better pitch framer in a majority of the starts, a big bat to bring off the bench, and and still gives Kyle the needed experience to continue to improve defensively.  He may get called up soon too if Montero's thumb doesn't get better before the weekend."
CHICubs,3d688u,totheloop,3,Mon Jul 13 23:46:20 2015 UTC,"Schwarber will never be a back-up. If he can stick at C, Montero is probably gone."
CHICubs,3d688u,TooLebowski,2,Tue Jul 14 04:19:52 2015 UTC,Why don't you like Cueto?
CHICubs,3d688u,totheloop,2,Tue Jul 14 03:54:15 2015 UTC,"He was apart of a big brawl with the Cards.  Here's a quote from Jason LaRue's wiki page:   ""LaRue returned to the Cardinals for 2010, his third season with the team. On August 10, 2010, he suffered a concussion caused by a kick to the head by the Cincinnati Reds' Johnny Cueto, during a bench-clearing brawl.[4] On August 19, LaRue was placed on the 60-day disabled list, ending his season.[5]  The concussion was initially thought to be slight, but LaRue experienced severe post-concussion symptoms. On September 18, LaRue announced his retirement from Major League Baseball. He told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that his symptoms were so severe that he'd been ordered to go back to his home in San Antonio, where he lived during the offseason, because he was in no condition to be left alone. He could not drive or cook for himself for a time, could not watch television or even ride in a car as a passenger with his eyes open.""  I can't remembe who else got hurt, but I think a pitcher got kicked  in the kidneys by him."
CHICubs,3d688u,Sparx7,2,Tue Jul 14 04:43:58 2015 UTC,Wow. That's a good reason.
CHICubs,3d688u,Bob2456,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:15:51 2015 UTC,Yeah I remember that brawl....someone  had cueto pushed up against the netting and he was just flailing with his legs.  Douchey move yes but I can't remember if it was deliberately at LaRue's head....I'll have to find it
CHICubs,3d688u,thebaconfever,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:56:15 2015 UTC,"I don't see Schwarber coming off the bench. If he's not ready to be a full time catcher, he'll play in LF and occasionally catch."
CHICubs,3d688u,Atticusbird44,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:11:40 2015 UTC,I don't think he can play well in the outfield. It's catcher or DH for him unfortunately.
CHICubs,3d688u,TooLebowski,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:07:14 2015 UTC,Schwarbers best chances next year are back up catcher?? That's preposterous to me. There's no way they bring up their #2 prospect next year simply to back up at least not next year.
CHICubs,3d688u,Atticusbird44,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:06:36 2015 UTC,"I could see kyle getting platooned and playing some outfield when he isn't catching.  Part of the problem is you have montero signed through 2017 and I believe Ross is signed through next year.  From a purely defensive aspect Montero is much better and more experienced than Kyle is.  Barring injuries you either go into the season with 3 catchers or try and trade someone.  We all want Kyle to succeed, but trading Montero away to make room for an unproven guy who may not stick as a big league catcher is dumb.  Again, in my ideal scenario, Kyle wins the backup role and plays a bit of outfield, learns from Miggy and primes himself to take over in 2017 or 18."
CHICubs,3d688u,shamesock,2,Tue Jul 14 20:44:55 2015 UTC,Yeah I could see Schwarber backup catcher and playing OF when he's not catching but I could not see him being on the bench when not catching.
CHICubs,3d688u,dhporter,2,Wed Jul 15 01:09:25 2015 UTC,"Castro hasn't played 2nd base since 2009 in the minors. And his defense hasn't really been the problem with him this year. In the middle of a playoff race it probably isn't worth it to try that experiment. I think status quo in the middle infield is the best course of action for the second half. Hendricks is an absolute lock for the second half of the year. The 5th starter doesn't have to be a lefty, there isn't much of an impact of having a more lefty/righty balance in a rotation. I think the reason we aren't in the mix for a TOR starter is because we are so far out of the division race, and it wouldn't be worth the asking price just to better position ourselves for the wildcard game. Especially with the expected free agent crop next year.  Montero is a good catcher. He has proven that at the major league level. David Ross has shown he can still play at the major league level this year as well. We don't know how KS can handle the #1 C spot defensively just yet. This is something that our scouting and minor league evaluators have a better grip on. Montero also probably couldn't be a serviceable OF like KS could be. And if we want to get KS some ABs it might make sense to have him in LF."
CHICubs,3d688u,SwedishLovePump,2,Mon Jul 13 21:53:42 2015 UTC,"Another thing to keep in mind is that you've got Olt and possibly La Stella coming up, which could push KB to the OF, too."
CHICubs,3d688u,Sparx7,2,Mon Jul 13 22:57:54 2015 UTC,Quick thought - who all could be coming up by the end of next year?   Olt La Stella Schwarber Almora Baez McKinney (?)   Who else?

CHICubs,3d57pg,Solleret,3,Mon Jul 13 16:53:23 2015 UTC,"I think the general consensus is that the decrease in 2nd half numbers can be attributed to normal regression. The guys in the HR derby are more likely to hit less HR in the 2nd half simply because they hit so many in the 1st half, thus being chosen as Derby participants. Which is kinda what Lindholm gets at here, but less specifically.   I'm still waiting for Byrant to get, as Maddon puts it, ""Spring Training hot"", though. I wouldn't be surprised to see him outpace his first half. With Rizzo, some regression makes a ton of sense, but his power numbers haven't been other-wordly. I think we're seeing what we get with him, though. .900 OPS, 30 bombs."

I tell you what of all the teams I've visited you guys and r/buccos are by far the most friendly. The Twins and the Blue Jays were by far the worst. I don't waste my time with the Cardinals fans. Not worth the heart burn.   Keep up the good work. See you on the Southside. If you're eating at Schallers before any of the games. I'll be the guy in the straw hat and Hawaiian shirt.

Possibly the best pitching performance we've seen this year. 96 mph heater in the 9th inning, ~110 pitches, knee-buckling curve ball to end the game, home run blast into left. What an outing."

CHICubs,3d1rxj,American_Soviet,3,Sun Jul 12 20:46:33 2015 UTC,Snake is awesome.  Amazing outing from him.  Really needed to get a win going into the All Star Break and our ace performed.  It was really hot and humid today.  9 innings was impressive.  Great way to end the first half.
CHICubs,3d1rxj,jp611,3,Sun Jul 12 22:17:43 2015 UTC,hot and humid today   I just got home from Chicago last night. Back to 95 degrees and 80% humidity.  I miss Chicago already.

CHICubs,3d2v0q,Tal_Venada,9,Mon Jul 13 02:12:57 2015 UTC,"Javier Baez has hardly had enough time to ""pan out"" I never understood jumping ship so soon with players, and in baseball of all sports. Baez will be fine"
CHICubs,3d2v0q,Jollyman21,11,Mon Jul 13 02:24:58 2015 UTC,See: Anthony Rizzo
CHICubs,3d2v0q,SoonerJDB,5,Mon Jul 13 14:18:26 2015 UTC,"Agree 100%.  He's had maybe half a season in the majors, and went down to AAA for maybe a month between his sister's death and getting hurt.  Give the kid a chance yet."
CHICubs,3d2v0q,zdruck07,2,Mon Jul 13 03:35:05 2015 UTC,And was doing quite well right before he got hurt.  Sure seemed like he was on the verge of getting called up since they had him working at 3B.  Cobra was struggling at that point so I think they were getting ready for a Baez at 3B and Bryant in LF switch...that or he was about to get traded.
CHICubs,3d2v0q,voidecho,5,Mon Jul 13 13:12:49 2015 UTC,Well you aren't gonna get good players if you aren't willing to part with good prospects
CHICubs,3d2v0q,Oprah-Is-My-Dad,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:12:32 2015 UTC,"That wasn't the point. When an elite prospect struggles in his first shot in the MLB, he no longer has a fifty-fifty shot at being a star, like Bryant."
CHICubs,3d2v0q,Bouksie,2,Mon Jul 13 03:51:47 2015 UTC,Anthony Rizzo hit I believe .140 the first time he got called up with the Padres. And now he's a 2 time all star
CHICubs,3d2v0q,Nexhume,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:27:38 2015 UTC,"He hit .141 for SD, which is why he no longer was considered to have a fifty-fifty shot to be a star. He's where Baez is now. That's all I'm saying. The percentages go down after a player struggles in his first attempt in the majors.    The point was that a fifty-fifty shot to star in the majors begins with their first full promotion to the Show. SD was willing to trade Rizzo only after he struggled. It didn't mean he would fail; it meant he no longer had a 50 percent shot at the Show. When I write about prospects in the piece, I'm saying that to trade an ace a buyer has to deal a Bryant or Baez before they play in the majors.   I'm not knocking Baez but he no longer has a fifty-fifty shot to be a star. He's at 30 percent like an MLB top-100 prospect."
CHICubs,3d2v0q,JSK23,3,Tue Jul 14 20:26:52 2015 UTC,"I liked your article and thought it provided a good scenario breakdown. I'm of the mindset that the Cubs going after Hamels is a really bad idea, but as a fan I appreciate the analysis."
CHICubs,3d2v0q,JohnnyWaffleseed,3,Mon Jul 13 04:09:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Save the prospects, and sign price in the off-season. Unless we are contending for the division title, no need to trade away for someone mid season."
CHICubs,3d0pvf,ChiCubsbot,7,Sun Jul 12 15:20:08 2015 UTC,GG guys! gladly will take 2 out of 3 against your hot ball club. Looking forward to watching your guys rep Chicago in hr derby. Bye Till our boys meet again at the cell

CHICubs,3czcb7,danman5550,21,Sun Jul 12 06:10:04 2015 UTC,We didn't score anything for Samardzija last year either. This team just seems like they're not ready to offensively produce against opposing aces yet.
CHICubs,3czcb7,NicCage420,3,Sun Jul 12 09:01:11 2015 UTC,I literally stopped reading the post to throw up a comment about how offensive that is.
CHICubs,3czcb7,RyanTheCubsSTH,2,Sun Jul 12 19:01:43 2015 UTC,Well he needs David Ross to catch him so he isn't doing himself any favors
CHICubs,3czcb7,TandBusquets,17,Sun Jul 12 19:14:02 2015 UTC,"I think what people are hung up about is the fact that he should be near the front of the pack, with his salary being the 24th highest in the MLB."
CHICubs,3czcb7,Jhacker111,13,Sun Jul 12 13:18:52 2015 UTC,Yes. 11 of 18 starts being quality isn't enough for a guy paid like that. He's not terrible - he's been a decent starter. But we signed him to be a lot more than that.
CHICubs,3czcb7,winkandthegun,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:36:34 2015 UTC,Give the guy a lead to work with for a change.
CHICubs,3czcb7,Devadander,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:50:47 2015 UTC,"What the offense does has absolutely nothing to do with his individual pitching stats. (Outside of record and run-support metrics, obviously)."
CHICubs,3czcb7,___worm___,8,Sun Jul 12 20:13:47 2015 UTC,"You should know better than this. It's vastly different pitching with a lead vs pitching from behind, or pitching while knowing there's no run support, and every pitch matters that much more, no room for error, leading to overthrowing as well as frustration when a corner call doesn't go Lester's way. Pitching doesn't happen in a vacuum. Don't be obtuse."
CHICubs,3czcb7,Devadander,3,Sun Jul 12 20:41:28 2015 UTC,"A month in solitary for you, Dufresne!"
CHICubs,3czcb7,illini211,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:14:46 2015 UTC,"Well in the NL, he's one of 9 spots contributing to the offense; 2 for him since he has a personal catcher."
CHICubs,3czcb7,herptydurr,-1,Sun Jul 12 20:33:08 2015 UTC,"I mean, you can't look at guy's performance and compare it to what you paid him. Since there's no salary cap, you need to gauge a pitcher on his performance on the field, and all things considered, Lester has been an average pitcher. We can absolutely be upset that he's not elite in the way we were hoping, but keep his pay out of it."
CHICubs,3czcb7,Loop_Within_A_Loop,3,Sun Jul 12 16:23:07 2015 UTC,"Nothing is worse then when I see people grade players on what they're paid compared to others in terms of total dollars like this.  Especially in the MLB.  Should Chris Sale pitch like 150th best player in the league because the Sox signed him to a sweetheart pre-arb deal?  And how should that effect how we see Lester?  It shouldn't.  And there are plenty of SP who are underpaid because of their contractual situations currently.    Lester is on pace for a 4 win season based on fWAR.  Because teams are paying anywhere between $6-$8m per WAR on the open market, and that he's making $25m, he's been worth his contract, thus, it's really been fine.  As long as we're getting our money's worth, I couldn't care less what he's paid in respect to the rest of the MLB in the way you've broken it down."
CHICubs,3czcb7,1908_Cubs,2,Sun Jul 12 23:37:48 2015 UTC,"interesting analysis of the situation. obviously time will truly tell, but do you think things like a need to have a personal catcher and an inability to establish a pickoff move are negligible?"
CHICubs,3czcb7,megalodondon,19,Mon Jul 13 09:42:10 2015 UTC,"I love Lester and I really don't worry about him at all. HOWEVER, when he is pitching, 2 out of 9 spots in our lineup are completely worthless at the plate, as almost always it's Ross and then Lester batting in the lineup. Obviously the run support should be better. But it's hard to create offense when there are two guaranteed outs every third inning. I don't think that accounts for everything, but it definitely doesn't help in regard to scoring runs."
CHICubs,3czcb7,ButtQueefer,9,Sun Jul 12 14:54:00 2015 UTC,"No offense in the NL is built around the backup catcher and starting pitcher.  There are 7 other guys in the lineup, and they aren't doing jack shit when Lester is on the mound."
CHICubs,3czcb7,demerdar,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:51:41 2015 UTC,"not BUILT, certainly, but baseball is a very momentum driven sport. As well as a numbers driven one. as much as i like ross' defense, it simply isnt worth having him in the lineup unless lester goes full ankiel every time he pitches to someone else behind the plate"
CHICubs,3czcb7,megalodondon,6,Mon Jul 13 09:38:15 2015 UTC,But Lester has a hit now. He's on a roll.
CHICubs,3czcb7,neonxmoose99,3,Sun Jul 12 18:54:55 2015 UTC,"I think sometimes we need to take a minute and remember why the Cubs signed him: Postseason.   In 76.2 career innings (excluding the AL Wild Card game last year), he has 2.11 ERA, 68 strikeouts to 21 walks.   I can't figure out the FIP and xFIP on baseball-reference, and fangraphs isn't helping me. But to my eyeball test, he's even better in the postseason than the regular season.   My point is that Jon Lester is well-known for putting up big games in the postseason, and the Cubs will need that one guy to step up in the postseason. Lester could very much be that person for the Cubs.   EDIT: But overall, so far this season, I think he's doing just fine. Not ace-worthy, no, but a reasonable TOR arm that just has no run support at all. I'm not that worried about him at all."
CHICubs,3czcb7,RoughRiders9,3,Sun Jul 12 17:52:17 2015 UTC,"I guess the followup question to that would then be this:  If we made the wildcard play-in game, who do we start - Arrieta or Lester?"
CHICubs,3czcb7,dhporter,11,Sun Jul 12 18:11:52 2015 UTC,Hmmm  It'd have to be either Arrieta or Arrieta. Or if not: Arrieta.
CHICubs,3czcb7,puttinginfarmhand,3,Sun Jul 12 18:51:28 2015 UTC,"Depends on a lot of things. Who's hot at the time, who's scheduled to pitch next, the matchups, etc..."
CHICubs,3czcb7,RoughRiders9,2,Sun Jul 12 18:21:46 2015 UTC,"Offense definitely needs to step up when he pitches, hopefully though, it's just a fluke and will regress to the mean eventually. I personally think he has great stuff, he just needs to be there mentally (can't throw to first and shuts down after giving up a hit)"
CHICubs,3czcb7,NewArithmetic,2,Sun Jul 12 16:42:43 2015 UTC,"Well, a big part of Lester's lack of run support has been his lack of hitting and David ""Automatic Out"" Ross being his personal catcher."
CHICubs,3czcb7,herptydurr,2,Sun Jul 12 20:32:01 2015 UTC,"Counterpoint:   The offense has been struggling for everyone lately, but as far as Lester himself is concerned, that only matters for his win record, which means almost nothing for exactly this reason. Run support and ERA are not related in any way. ""Middle-of-the-pack"" for a guy brought in on $155 million is plain unacceptable. He is an ace by trade and needs to show it consistently. Again, 11 of 18 quality starts is not good. A quality start is a pretty low baseline of competence for a starting pitcher, especially in this era of pitching dominance, and especially for a guy that is supposed to be an ace.   Lester has had only a couple of really bad outings this year; all in all he's been decent. But being decent isn't enough for him, and that's what people are pissed about."

CHICubs,3czcb7,zrk23,18,Sun Jul 12 16:13:46 2015 UTC,"That's a quality start. We can debate the statistic all day, but that's what it is."
CHICubs,3czcb7,Loop_Within_A_Loop,-4,Sun Jul 12 16:22:24 2015 UTC,i dont think 4.5 is quality. if you look at pitchers stats by the end of the year and you see a 4.5 ERA that would raise red flags. i dont link my ace with a 4.5 era so i dont 6 and 3 is quality by no means. (or a GOOD ACE START if you want to keep pressing the quality thing)
CHICubs,3czcb7,zrk23,2,Sun Jul 12 18:57:30 2015 UTC,It's a quality start
CHICubs,3czcb7,cgoods94,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:16:21 2015 UTC,"Quality start:       In baseball, a quality start is a statistic for a starting pitcher defined as a game in which the pitcher completes at least six innings and permits no more than three earned runs.  The quality start was developed by sportswriter John Lowe in 1985 while writing for the Philadelphia Inquirer.  ESPN.com terms a loss suffered by a pitcher in a quality start as a tough loss and a win earned by a pitcher in a non-quality start a cheap win.   Nolan Ryan has used the term ""High Quality Start"" for games where the pitcher goes seven innings or more and allows three earned runs or less.

CHICubs,3cyi8c,chuckyp,9,Sat Jul 11 22:57:50 2015 UTC,"He's been very inconsistent...however the offense has been consistently bad, especially when he has been pitching."
CHICubs,3cyi8c,lpwalsh,3,Sat Jul 11 23:01:45 2015 UTC,Great point and I think it adds fuel to the fire about Lester. Knowing if he gives up more than 2 our chances seem to drop astronomically with him on the mound.
CHICubs,3cyi8c,chuckyp,5,Sat Jul 11 23:17:38 2015 UTC,League average is under 4. He makes $25 mil a year...no.
CHICubs,3cyi8c,THEriot2,5,Sat Jul 11 23:31:59 2015 UTC,"I mean, there's no salary cap in baseball. Giving him a big contract is not the end of the world, especially when you consider the revenue the Cubs bring in."
CHICubs,3cyi8c,Loop_Within_A_Loop,2,Sat Jul 11 23:39:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  I agree on that, but I think my criticisms still stand and that giving out bad contracts is bad regardless of purchasing power.   Oh well, he's still looked pretty good and we're In a great position despite a couple skids."
CHICubs,3cyi8c,THEriot2,2,Sun Jul 12 01:25:26 2015 UTC,Thats a poor excuse. If that was the case we should just bring in any one.   We should've signed Scherzer
CHICubs,3cyi8c,TandBusquets,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:35:56 2015 UTC,It honestly doesn't matter. Offense managed just a single run and you can't count on winning games with one run over two games.
CHICubs,3cyi8c,pm_me_ur_pajamas,6,Sun Jul 12 00:14:43 2015 UTC,So...  Is it too early to bring up Schwarber?
CHICubs,3cyi8c,zdruck07,7,Sat Jul 11 22:56:25 2015 UTC,Nothing against the guy because he's going to be a really good hitter but bringing he and his 25 or so major league plate appearances up and expecting him to spark the offense isn't really fair or realistic.
CHICubs,3cyi8c,TheFakeTimShady,6,Sun Jul 12 00:41:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It's possible but not realistic. The same people expected Bryant to hit 50 HR  this year. Not to mention what his defense would do to the only thing keeping us in it...pitching and defense.   We just gotta realize that this year is 1 early and there's not some kind of special, game changing help coming. Anyone who would bring that makes no sense for us given the future. Not to mention that the best hitter available is Adam Lind."
CHICubs,3cyi8c,THEriot2,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:58:30 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, I agree, he needs more time to season on defense.  Is there really nothing to be found for hitting in trades?"

No one on the infield will be benched including the Miggy/Ross combo. The OF the only shot is Fowler really, but I don't see that happening either. It'd be easier just to bet on him bouncing back in the 2nd half, probably smarter risk-reward wise, too. Whatever kind of bat we acquire just won't make a huge difference most likely, just like Schwarber wouldn't most likely."

CHICubs,3cyhyf,Riderz_of_Brohan,5,Sat Jul 11 23:02:24 2015 UTC,As long as he can catch the ball and be average at blocking I'm fine. We don't gun runners out as it is. I think the trade off is definitely worth it.
CHICubs,3cyhyf,Dhash23,12,Sat Jul 11 23:09:06 2015 UTC,"No. Teagarden and Ross will split. Two weeks in when Schwarber is awful behind the plate everyone's going to eat crow. We know the offense is bad, but he needs his reps behind the plate. Notice he caught SPARINGLY the first time. There was a reason for that. His defense is not ready and you can't just stash him in left field. That would defeat the purpose of the catching need. Plus he also started getting adjusted to at the end of the last time so he's not a finished offensive product by any stretch."
CHICubs,3cyhyf,dsalmon1449,15,Sat Jul 11 23:29:56 2015 UTC,"No, because we're not trying to win a world series this year. We're trying to build a team that will win at least 2 in the next 10 years."

CHICubs,3cyhyf,jacksonvstheworld,13,Sat Jul 11 22:56:53 2015 UTC,Teagarden has been in the MLB before. He's not really going to do anything with his time in the Show. Schwarber is being kept down so he can work on his ability behind the plate.
CHICubs,3cyhyf,0mousedog,2,Sat Jul 11 22:58:26 2015 UTC,I hope that once the cubs play at the cell in August that they bring him and keep him up.

If Schwarber needs the rest of this year in the minors to become a ML catcher, that is fine. He is a lot more valuable in the long run as a C than he is as a LF, and much more valuable than he would be in the second half of one season as a replacement for Montero."
CHICubs,3cyhyf,ChiTown1970,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:43:16 2015 UTC,"No reason to sell out the future for a WS run? Yeah, cause we've had so many"

The goal isn't to sell out and win a WS as quickly as possible. The goal is to build a sustained winner, who has the potential to win a WS each of the next 10-12 years, and hopefully nets multiple championships."

CHICubs,3cyhyf,Oprah-Is-My-Dad,7,Sun Jul 12 03:18:33 2015 UTC,Coghlan is pretty bad in left field defensively. Moving him to center would make it even worse.
CHICubs,3cyhyf,THEriot2,3,Sun Jul 12 06:24:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, having an awful defensive OF worked well for the Padres. And ours would be worse."
CHICubs,3cyhyf,pm_me_ur_pajamas,-3,Sun Jul 12 13:45:51 2015 UTC,If people are worried about his catching then just put him in LF and put whoever sucks less in CF - based on how poor Fowler has been lately I wouldn't mind giving him some days off.   Let him work on catching next year.
CHICubs,3cyhyf,jazzcigarettes,2,Sun Jul 12 00:16:43 2015 UTC,So by that logic we're in more of a win now situation this year than we will be next? Let the kid develop.
CHICubs,3cyhyf,pm_me_ur_pajamas,-1,Sun Jul 12 03:28:00 2015 UTC,If Theo is serious about competing in October this year then bringing Schwarmachine up now makes the most sense.
CHICubs,3cyhyf,TandBusquets,6,Sun Jul 12 03:41:28 2015 UTC,You can be serious without being irrational.
CHICubs,3cyhyf,jazzcigarettes,3,Sun Jul 12 04:34:40 2015 UTC,I think you need to think more long term. This is the very very beginning of what will hopefully be sustained success and I think it's foolish to stunt development in any way for a bit more success right now.

CHICubs,3cxemk,charlizamon,2,Sat Jul 11 22:09:44 2015 UTC,Concussion DL
CHICubs,3cxemk,WhiteRabbit13,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:07:42 2015 UTC,Oh man that sucks. I wonder if its because of the hockey mask helmet he went back too this year (I think?).

CHICubs,3cxemk,charlizamon,2,Sat Jul 11 22:08:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I hope Lester learns that someone else can catch him. Montero is an excellent pitch framer."

CHICubs,3cxemk,charlizamon,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:16:17 2015 UTC,Been disappointing but mostly because expectations were so high. He's been on fire the last month or so. ERA under 2 in that time frame I think
CHICubs,3cxemk,glberns,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:21:17 2015 UTC,Probably just needs some time to settle down. He'll probably be awesome next year

CHICubs,3cxemk,Sephiroth007,0,Sat Jul 11 21:54:49 2015 UTC,He's grooving too many pitches which is odd because he was so good in between this and the 1st.

CHICubs,3cydy4,cgoods94,23,Sat Jul 11 22:14:45 2015 UTC,"Starlin Castro has a .283 OBP. He's never gotten on base less.  He has a .610 OPS, lowest of his career.  He's on pace for the least power / extra-base hits in his career.  He's on pace for the most errors of his career  This ain't much of a contest. Voting for Lester over Castro would be alarmingly off."
CHICubs,3cydy4,stackshot,2,Sat Jul 11 22:38:44 2015 UTC,I agree with Castro being the most disappointing but your last sentence is a little much.
CHICubs,3cydy4,noeasybuckets,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:14:04 2015 UTC,"As it's been said, Lester is literally the same dude his career numbers said he'd be. That's not disappointing, that's Lester being Lester.  To compare Castro's career numbers to his 2015 season would leave anyone tremendously disappointed.  Castro has a .608 OPS and on pace for 30 errors  Lester has a 3.30 FIP and 3.60 ErA. That's more disappointing? Not even close."
CHICubs,3cydy4,stackshot,0,Sun Jul 12 14:05:14 2015 UTC,"The Cubs did not invest in Lester to get his career averages. They invested in an ace entering his prime years. You need to look at his last 3 seasons. Also, your argument assumes that their individual successes/failures impact the team equally. Like I said, I agree with you that Castro is more disappointing (especially bc of trade value) but it's not as big of a gap as you say.  Oh and arguing in absolutes kinda hinders the ability to have good dialog. That's all."
CHICubs,3cydy4,noeasybuckets,2,Mon Jul 13 00:43:31 2015 UTC,"Lester's last three years:  -One year much better than his averages  -One year at his averages  -One year below his averages  Eery, ain't it? Add up to a sum total of.....his same exact career numbers. That actually perfectly agrees with what I'm saying.   You don't blame a 31 year old for being who they are.  Castro has been a near league-worst shortstop, Lester has been exactly what you would predict (an above average starter).  This is based on unfounded fan expectation, and has less to do with Jon.   *****(We're debating who is more disappointing, a pitcher with a 3.17 FIP, or a bad defensive shortstop with a .608 OPS. Miles of difference.)"
CHICubs,3cydy4,stackshot,9,Mon Jul 13 00:57:43 2015 UTC,I'm writing in Arismendy Alcantara.  He went from blooming prospect to complete afterthought  in a flash.
CHICubs,3cydy4,airham,3,Sat Jul 11 23:46:56 2015 UTC,"He needs to be playing 6-7 games a week and that wouldn't happen in the majors, so it makes zero sense to keep him up here. He's had some struggles at the plate this year, but I wouldn't write him off just yet.   They could have put him at CF but Theo traded for Fowler instead."
CHICubs,3cydy4,pm_me_ur_pajamas,0,Sun Jul 12 01:21:18 2015 UTC,"I could see him coming up if we ever trade Castro (depending on the return). But, I don't know that would be an upgrade (after moving Russell to SS), and he would have to battle Baez (who also may be considered a disappointment)."
CHICubs,3cydy4,yes_or_gnome,10,Mon Jul 13 15:40:12 2015 UTC,"I backed off the hate for Lester after he started to come around after his rocky beginning to the season.   After today's game, it has got to be him again. He pitched against an All Star Pitcher and potential Cy Young candidate. And it wasn't even close. The Sox offense is anemic and he still got lit up for 5 R, 4 ER.   Sure our offense has sputtered too in recent weeks and we've gotten used to winning the close ones with a lot of help from the bullpen, but he didn't even give us a chance.   For a guy paid this much, you can stomach a 1-0 loss like we had yesterday. That's on the offense. But while a 3.59 ERA is pretty solid for an SP, perhaps the hype he brought with him and the money he got in return would have you believe he'd have given us a great pitching duel against a legit SP like Sale.   Instead, he's been slightly above average for the season and really screwed the pooch against top SPs. You know...the SPs we'll be facing if a playoff run were to happen.   Maybe he'll turn it around but the Sox have already taken 2 of 3, at worst, of the series. It leaves a bad taste going into the ASB.  There still a lot of issues with the team, including the lack of run production, but this is one thing we were hoping was fixed by signing Lester. And instead we've got a real volatile ""ace"" so far."
CHICubs,3cydy4,smackythefrog,13,Sat Jul 11 23:06:26 2015 UTC,"Jon Lester has a career 3.57 ERA and a career 1.26 WHIP.  This year, Jon Lester has a 3.59 ERA and a 1.28 WHIP.  Almost point-for-point the same as he's always been.  A player can't disappoint if they are playing exactly like they always did."
CHICubs,3cydy4,dgsisto,8,Sat Jul 11 23:53:08 2015 UTC,"Then we're blinded by the hype. The same hype that likely influenced his salary.   The argument is not that Lester is a poor player. The argument is he's 4-8, 3.59 ERA (great, but 4th best on the team) and when he gets lit up, it's by strong playoff teams.   The reason thrown out for his signing was for his playoff appearances and success. I don't know what those numbers are right now, but we'll assume they're better than his regular season stats. But no way he can be excused from not even giving us a chance against a shitty Sox team today.   Off day for him? OK. As I said, he's shaped up nicely since his early season struggles. But if he faces a pitcher of Sale's caliber in the playoffs. Kershaw, Scherzer, Zimmerman, Cole, Burnett or Liriano, he's going to lose.  And we're allowed to lose games. And Lester is allowed to go 4-8, 3.59 ERA. But it's a shame he's being outplayed by Arrieta, Hamels, and Hendricks for that kind of money.  We still have half a season left and this thread emphasizes so far in this season, but to have a guy come out once every 5 days and not really compete against the better teams in the majors is definitely a let-down. I don't think this is what Cubs fans were hoping for at all. Again, we weren't expecting him to be 16-0, 0.00 ERA with 300 Ks at the ASB. He's allowed to make mistakes. But this doesn't inspire confidence to use him as a #1 starter, especially come time for the playoffs.   If Maddon did something loopy like stick with a 3 man rotation for the playoffs, I don't think Lester's current numbers would put him ahead of even Hendricks. If he got the third spot, and he likely would anyway, it would be based off of history in the playoffs and not merit. And it may not be the best choice for the team."
CHICubs,3cydy4,smackythefrog,2,Sun Jul 12 00:15:16 2015 UTC,"3.57 ERA in the AL is quite a bit better than a 3.57 ERA in the NL. I mean take a look at the ERA of AL starting pitchers vs NL starting pitchers. Head-to-head (#1 vs #1, #2 vs #2, etc.) AL pitcher ERAs are about 0.20 or more higher than NL pitchers. It's a product of the DH and fewer pinch hitting situations."

CHICubs,3cydy4,Riderz_of_Brohan,11,Sat Jul 11 22:50:31 2015 UTC,He's being paid 25 million to be our 4th best pitcher
CHICubs,3cydy4,Cubsfan5ever,3,Sun Jul 12 00:12:55 2015 UTC,2 runs of support since May and a shitty defense isn't gonna help any pitcher.
CHICubs,3cydy4,Gimmie_Dat_Stream,2,Sun Jul 12 04:11:13 2015 UTC,That's very true.
CHICubs,3cydy4,Cubsfan5ever,2,Sun Jul 12 04:50:01 2015 UTC,he's responsible for 2/9ths of that offense...
CHICubs,3cydy4,herptydurr,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:08:46 2015 UTC,Come on you can't actually think hendricks is better than lester
CHICubs,3cydy4,Oprah-Is-My-Dad,4,Mon Jul 13 06:02:00 2015 UTC,Fowler and Castro no doubt
CHICubs,3cydy4,zrk23,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:48:47 2015 UTC,Fowler for me. I was expecting great things from him out of the leadoff spot. He started off strong but has really struggled down the stretch. If he can turn things around and start getting on base again we can up those runs.
CHICubs,3cydy4,chipscarruthers,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:25:24 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't vote Lester, although he hasn't pitched like an ace he has shown bright spots.  He has been getting haunted by one bad inning quite a bit.  As much as I hate to say it I think it would have to be Castro.  He turned it around last year and had a good year but has regressed again.  He's thinking too much at the plate but that is easier said then done.  Hopefully the all-star break clears his head and turns it around.  The cubs offense needs him to produce."

CHICubs,3cydy4,Oprah-Is-My-Dad,-9,Sun Jul 12 20:05:26 2015 UTC,Maybe not biggest disappointment but I get a knot in my stomach every time a ball is hit to 3rd.  Just every time I see a bonehead defensive move it's Bryant again.
CHICubs,3cydy4,johnnybravo1014,2,Sun Jul 12 20:07:13 2015 UTC,He was expected to be bad defensively at third. He's been average. That's not disappointing.
CHICubs,3cydy4,johnnybravo1014,0,Sun Jul 12 20:09:24 2015 UTC,"I was unaware he was expected to be bad defensively, thank you."

CHICubs,3czl9s,SoberFuck,7,Sun Jul 12 05:32:19 2015 UTC,I always thought that Ryno was sort of pissed at the Cubs for being snubbed when the managerial position was up for grabs a few years ago.
CHICubs,3czl9s,alex19330,6,Sun Jul 12 15:46:23 2015 UTC,"After being setup to fail in Philly, maybe he'll see that both Quade and Sveum were setup to fail here.  I was pissed at the time, but in retrospect I'm glad Epstein didn't do that to one of our legends.  Hopefully he finds his way back someday."
CHICubs,3czl9s,Ethril,2,Sun Jul 12 17:47:30 2015 UTC,"I would love to see him come back with some position. I used to love watching him coach the Peoria Chiefs. He always signed autographs before the game, but I always showed up a minute late and he would have to go back to the dugout."
CHICubs,3czl9s,alex19330,2,Sun Jul 12 18:52:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think he was all that upset – at least not after Theo and him had a closed door meeting. Based on his comments to the press afterward, it seems like he sort of understood that the Cubs were going to be bad for a couple years and whoever managed them during this time was going to go down with them.  If only he were more patient and was willing to wait a couple years managing Iowa, he could be the Cubs manager right now.  Along similar lines, I kind of feel bad for Craig Counsell since I don't see the Brewers turning their franchise around anytime soon."
CHICubs,3czl9s,herptydurr,2,Sun Jul 12 22:24:49 2015 UTC,I think it also had to do with the trying to get away from old cubbie stuff & it's impossible to fire a manager who was a team legend.  Ryno's smart I think he understood.

CHICubs,3cvs6l,zdruck07,5,Sat Jul 11 06:08:51 2015 UTC,I'm a really big fan of McKinney. He's a doubles machine and hasn't been striking out too much (12.6 k rate in AA). All that and he still hasn't even turned 21. His approach seems to be very advanced for his age.
CHICubs,3cvs6l,AllAboutDatTwtw,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:43:15 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately it boils down to him not having enough power for RF or LF, so CF is ideal but his people say his defense wouldn't be ideal. Plus we have Almora as CF of the future."
CHICubs,3cvs6l,pm_me_ur_pajamas,2,Sun Jul 12 00:18:06 2015 UTC,"Why is Almora automatically ""our CF of the future"". For the past 2 years he hasn't hit at all. I like McKinney better."
CHICubs,3cvs6l,Aladdin16,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:56:23 2015 UTC,Because if McKinney isn't good enough defensively to play center then we don't have any other options
CHICubs,3cvs6l,Oprah-Is-My-Dad,0,Mon Jul 13 01:02:01 2015 UTC,"Almora won't be 22 until April, so him being inconsistent isn't a huge concern just yet. McKinney would be a defensive liability at CF, so that's not ideal.   If Almora doesn't put things back together next year then we can push him down the list."

CHICubs,3cvs6l,thejazzmarauder,5,Sat Jul 11 07:38:30 2015 UTC,"Here is some quotes from this article about him from earlier in the year:      ""Cease, 19, likely would have been a first-round pick if he had not injured his right elbow during his senior year at Milton (Ga.) High School. But the Cubs thought so highly of Cease's talent despite the likelihood of surgery that they drafted and signed him to a $1.5 million bonus — the fourth highest for a sixth-round pick.....      ""I know it wasn't an easy decision for the Cubs, but I'm grateful they selected me,"" said the 6-foot-2, 190-pound Cease, whose fastball was clocked as high as 97 mph before his injury. ""I want to show them they made a great selection."""""

CHICubs,3cupgt,voidecho,0,Sat Jul 11 17:53:18 2015 UTC,I respectfully disagree.  Look at our righties.  11 balls outside the zone called strikes per the chart above.  Zero balls outside the zone called strikes against their righties.  That's not both ways.    In a 1-0 game that certainly can be the difference.
CHICubs,3cupgt,voidecho,2,Sat Jul 11 01:17:12 2015 UTC,I thought the zone was big but consistent. I wouldn't call it bad by any stretch of the means but I don't like to complain about umpires as much as Reddit.
CHICubs,3cupgt,THEriot2,0,Fri Jul 10 23:20:36 2015 UTC,It was not a consistent zone.  http://www.brooksbaseball.net/pfxVB/zoneTrack.php?month=07&day=10&year=2015&game=gid_2015_07_10_chamlb_chnmlb_1%2F
CHICubs,3cupgt,Ampersand2568,2,Sat Jul 11 00:36:23 2015 UTC,i cant really read this graphics. seemed just fine
CHICubs,3cupgt,zrk23,2,Sat Jul 11 01:05:45 2015 UTC,"Really? That seems fine to you?  Here's the plots from the last Cards game:  http://www.brooksbaseball.net/pfxVB/zoneTrack.php?month=7&day=8&year=2015&game=gid_2015_07_08_slnmlb_chnmlb_1%2F&prevGame=gid_2015_07_10_chamlb_chnmlb_1%2F&prevDate=0708  That's what I think is acceptable.  There's a couple bad calls that went the Cubs way (low pitches to RHH) and 1 that went for the Cards (low outside corner to RHH), but overall is was a consistently small zone.  Today's zone, on the other hand, I count at least 11 calls that were pretty obviously wrong - as opposed to 3 for the previous game.  Edit: As far as reading the graphic, it shows where ball were pitched, by which team (shape) and whether is was called a ball (green) or strike (red).  The dark line is the ""rule book zone"", and the dashed box is what an umpire typically calls.  All I'm interested in is consistency."
CHICubs,3cupgt,Ampersand2568,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:37:00 2015 UTC,"Those charts are the standard for review of ball/strike calls. Even if you shun charts, you saw dexter rung up twice on ball 4 live. The biggest thing going for the sox was Rodon missed his spots so often the ump had less frame of reference. Pitches that missed by a foot were strikes and balls."

CHICubs,3cupgt,OandAlifer,4,Fri Jul 10 22:56:25 2015 UTC,They are terrible. The record doesn't tell the whole story
CHICubs,3cupgt,TandBusquets,9,Fri Jul 10 22:59:44 2015 UTC,"Our hitting has been atrocious, yes. It is our pitching that keeps us close in games."
CHICubs,3cupgt,Meatmehalfway,5,Fri Jul 10 23:05:54 2015 UTC,"Our offense is anemic, currently."
CHICubs,3cupgt,slave_to_technology,2,Fri Jul 10 23:10:25 2015 UTC,With the worst defense in baseball.  That's 2/3 of the game where the white Sox are poor
CHICubs,3cupgt,TandBusquets,-11,Sat Jul 11 02:29:00 2015 UTC,And the Cubs are overachieving right now and will be below .500 in the second half. So what's your point?
CHICubs,3cupgt,OandAlifer,3,Fri Jul 10 23:11:15 2015 UTC,I'm in tears
CHICubs,3cupgt,TandBusquets,0,Sat Jul 11 02:27:16 2015 UTC,Another win.  Cubs suck
CHICubs,3cupgt,OandAlifer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:07:05 2015 UTC,And the white sox are still the worst team in baseball not named the phillies.
CHICubs,3cupgt,TandBusquets,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:37:24 2015 UTC,False.
CHICubs,3cupgt,OandAlifer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:44:36 2015 UTC,Rank last offensively and defensively.
CHICubs,3cupgt,TandBusquets,5,Sun Jul 12 03:49:26 2015 UTC,"They're a weird team, like awful, but also just swept the Cards last week, and have been playing winning ball since then. I almost find it hard to really hate them (as of course I do as a Cubs fan) since they just seem so mediocre and lost this year."
CHICubs,3cupgt,KindfOfABigDeal,11,Fri Jul 10 22:55:46 2015 UTC,"All these fucking analysts saying the Cubs should pick up a starting pitcher before the deadline are fucking stupid. Our rotation has been amazing to this point, what we need is someone who will hit the god damn ball and quit swinging at every fucking baseball like this is a god damn tennis match. FUCK, sorry for my rant i hate the White Sox and this is the first time we have been able to get pissed at individual losses for the first time in five years. I guess that is a good thing but I am not used to this feeling and it sucks."
CHICubs,3cupgt,Riley_Cubs,6,Fri Jul 10 22:52:50 2015 UTC,We still need a 5th starter. Clayton Richard isn't going to get it done. There was a reason he was available for cash.
CHICubs,3cupgt,cubswinagain,4,Fri Jul 10 22:55:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that reason is he had an ""upward"" clause in his contract, meaning the Pirates had a three day window to trade him or promote him. They had to get rid of him."
CHICubs,3cupgt,SwedishLovePump,5,Sat Jul 11 01:03:56 2015 UTC,"If he was even moderately valuable, the Pirates would have put him in their bullpen to avoid trading him in-division."
CHICubs,3cupgt,cubswinagain,2,Sat Jul 11 01:32:23 2015 UTC,"Ive been saying we need a bat and downvoted by r/chicubs for being ""an idiot"""
CHICubs,3cupgt,ChicagoRunner,3,Sat Jul 11 01:19:01 2015 UTC,We easily could have had 3 rubs today if we didn't hit into the 6 double plays
CHICubs,3cupgt,Sephiroth007,6,Fri Jul 10 22:54:43 2015 UTC,"I'm all for rubs, but I'd rather have some runs"
CHICubs,3cupgt,MLWolfie,5,Fri Jul 10 22:59:32 2015 UTC,Runs* Haha thank you.
CHICubs,3cupgt,Sephiroth007,3,Fri Jul 10 23:04:31 2015 UTC,Head rubs = runs!
CHICubs,3cupgt,cgoods94,4,Fri Jul 10 23:10:45 2015 UTC,Was it really six?  Christ.
CHICubs,3cupgt,zdruck07,2,Fri Jul 10 22:55:57 2015 UTC,5.
CHICubs,3cupgt,the_tristanity,0,Fri Jul 10 23:08:11 2015 UTC,yup
CHICubs,3cupgt,Sephiroth007,0,Fri Jul 10 23:04:01 2015 UTC,Yeah. That was baaad.
CHICubs,3cupgt,Sephiroth007,5,Fri Jul 10 23:04:57 2015 UTC,Fowler was not that ump's favorite person. I've never seen such shitty calls on one guy.
CHICubs,3cupgt,getdatgoat,5,Fri Jul 10 23:06:46 2015 UTC,You obviously didn't watch Soler before he got hurt.
CHICubs,3cupgt,LtDarien,2,Sat Jul 11 00:17:00 2015 UTC,Word
CHICubs,3cupgt,voidecho,5,Sat Jul 11 01:10:04 2015 UTC,Frustrating. These games happen though.
CHICubs,3cupgt,EamusCatuli08,2,Fri Jul 10 22:50:35 2015 UTC,I prefer they didn't happen in back to back games
CHICubs,3cupgt,btownboogie,6,Fri Jul 10 22:56:01 2015 UTC,so was their defense that good or our offense that bad?
CHICubs,3cupgt,American_Soviet,5,Fri Jul 10 22:50:51 2015 UTC,Yes.
CHICubs,3cupgt,DivideAndConker,3,Fri Jul 10 22:53:02 2015 UTC,Yes.
CHICubs,3cupgt,American_Soviet,3,Fri Jul 10 22:53:45 2015 UTC,Yarp.
CHICubs,3cupgt,zdruck07,2,Fri Jul 10 22:54:40 2015 UTC,Affirmative
CHICubs,3cupgt,inevitablescape,3,Fri Jul 10 22:55:59 2015 UTC,I can't help but think that hat last cardinals loss is demoralizing enough to come back and haunt us til after the all star break
CHICubs,3cupgt,Riderz_of_Brohan,13,Fri Jul 10 22:51:46 2015 UTC,"I don't know what's worse, our offense or the White Sox announcers"
CHICubs,3cupgt,MLWolfie,7,Fri Jul 10 22:48:47 2015 UTC,White Sox announcers... you can put THAT on the board
CHICubs,3cupgt,Jollyman21,4,Fri Jul 10 22:50:55 2015 UTC,He gone! I feel bad for everyone who had to listen to that when Sale was striking out 10 guys a game
CHICubs,3cupgt,MLWolfie,3,Fri Jul 10 22:52:01 2015 UTC,Hopefully the game is better tomorrow. I'm lucky enough to be going and I want to see Jon dominate and the offense break out against an A+ pitcher. Wishful thinking at the least.
CHICubs,3cupgt,big-mo,5,Fri Jul 10 23:00:27 2015 UTC,Nothing ever makes sense when it comes to the Cubs
CHICubs,3cupgt,wazzzzzzzzzza,4,Fri Jul 10 22:49:16 2015 UTC,Absolutely pathetic performance from the offense. We walked 7 times and barely got anyone in scoring position. I really hope Joe rips into these guys a bit after that.
CHICubs,3cupgt,Cubsfan5ever,3,Fri Jul 10 22:50:10 2015 UTC,can we just PLEASE STOP MAKING THREADS ABOUT HOW GOOD OUR BULLPEN IS OR WAS OR WHATEVER
CHICubs,3cupgt,zrk23,3,Fri Jul 10 23:01:16 2015 UTC,Our BP has been fantastic lately what are you smoking?
CHICubs,3cupgt,Sephiroth007,2,Fri Jul 10 23:02:00 2015 UTC,our bullpen has more ER since we started manking threads about them then they had before. google it
CHICubs,3cupgt,zrk23,3,Fri Jul 10 23:32:18 2015 UTC,"And don't ever say the words ""no hitter""!"
CHICubs,3cupgt,THEriot2,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:17:55 2015 UTC,yep!
CHICubs,3cupgt,zrk23,2,Fri Jul 10 23:31:02 2015 UTC,Well that ruined my Friday.
CHICubs,3cupgt,RCoombs77,2,Fri Jul 10 22:48:33 2015 UTC,When will the drought end? Man you really see the inexperience at times like these.  A lot of stupid baseball going on.
CHICubs,3cupgt,TomSan23,2,Fri Jul 10 22:55:54 2015 UTC,What a waste of time. Over under 1 hit tomorrow?
CHICubs,3cupgt,STUstone,2,Fri Jul 10 22:58:19 2015 UTC,"Fowler is terrible, why is he lead off?"
CHICubs,3cupgt,Go_Cubs_Go_13,4,Fri Jul 10 23:28:19 2015 UTC,"Really? I thought he had a bad day with the ump making bad calls, but other than that I think he's been pretty solid."
CHICubs,3cupgt,dvk12345,2,Sat Jul 11 01:04:28 2015 UTC,"Well he's got a sub-.685 OPS at this point.  He's only getting on base at a .310 clip.  He's been pretty terrible since the beginning of May, it's alarming."
CHICubs,3cupgt,jp611,2,Sat Jul 11 02:03:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he was fine earlier when people were complaining about is BA, because he was still getting on base. Now he looks awful."
CHICubs,3cupgt,octobadger,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:04:30 2015 UTC,These close losses are so demoralizing.  It just seems like nothing goes our way at times. Today we had the baserunners but they kept getting bailed out on these double plays and strikeouts.
CHICubs,3cupgt,Handzus_Job,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:57:21 2015 UTC,just sigh
CHICubs,3cupgt,imboredmuch,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:30:03 2015 UTC,"Not gonna win many games when you strikeout 12 times AND ground into 5 double plays.  Hendricks pitched another gem at least, I just wish this offense would wake up and stay hot."
CHICubs,3cupgt,jp611,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:06:19 2015 UTC,Not a bad game. Just some bad luck.
CHICubs,3cupgt,hourglasspilgrim,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:43:03 2015 UTC,Lester is going to go and make the sox line up look like a joke tomorrow. I have a strong feeling we'll get 3 runs off sale. No way the Sox defense plays like that again tomorrow.
CHICubs,3cupgt,Sephiroth007,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:59:08 2015 UTC,This game was very winnable.  Too many DP's.  It would be nice to hit Sale tomorrow and bring him back down to reality.
CHICubs,3cupgt,0mousedog,0,Fri Jul 10 23:47:09 2015 UTC,Cubs need to go and trade for someone like Zobrist
CHICubs,3cupgt,Sephiroth007,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:49:54 2015 UTC,i would really love having him
CHICubs,3cupgt,zrk23,-3,Fri Jul 10 23:02:43 2015 UTC,Good for them. The Sox needed that.
CHICubs,3cupgt,elwood_junkins,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:49:40 2015 UTC,"I would prefer we didn't give it to them, but sure.  Woo."
CHICubs,3cupgt,zdruck07,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:50:20 2015 UTC,Agreed fuck 'em. I was trying to sound passive aggressive.
CHICubs,3cupgt,elwood_junkins,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:04:40 2015 UTC,Thanks.  But we're not gonna go very far getting one or two runs a game.  We spent a lot of money on hitting this off season and we have the worst OPS in the AL.
CHICubs,3cupgt,Meatmehalfway,-7,Fri Jul 10 23:12:21 2015 UTC,Does anyone have a replay of the blown call that lost us the game?
CHICubs,3csur1,kwruffner,12,Fri Jul 10 14:26:02 2015 UTC,Amen. It's going to get hot out and he's going to get in a groove
CHICubs,3csur1,tomseymour12,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:47:32 2015 UTC,Unfortunately he's going to be a 2nd half player until he figures out how to hit in cold weather.  Hopefully he can hit in October.
CHICubs,3csur1,bryanno4444,4,Fri Jul 10 14:57:28 2015 UTC,He's been having some great at bats since he came off the DL and it seems like he's making solid contact as opposed to chasing sliders low and away.
CHICubs,3csur1,cooter410,4,Fri Jul 10 17:33:04 2015 UTC,"I agree, really working some deep counts and showing the patience he had last year. If he can pick it up behind Bryant and Rizzo that's huge for our offense."
CHICubs,3csur1,Sparx7,5,Fri Jul 10 17:50:58 2015 UTC,lotta soler threads
CHICubs,3csur1,kweb1023,3,Fri Jul 10 15:40:45 2015 UTC,I've actually been pretty impressed with him since he's been back. He's laid off a few more pitches which has resulted in striking out less and has raised his average .006 already.
CHICubs,3csur1,zrk23,2,Fri Jul 10 17:53:12 2015 UTC,his soft contact% is just 12%. hard contact is 40%. and i think will improve even morre. dude is always hitting strong
CHICubs,3csur1,slave_to_technology,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:13:05 2015 UTC,His approach has been improving a lot. We've all seen the flashes of brilliance.

CHICubs,3csur1,usernamedifficulty,13,Fri Jul 10 14:49:11 2015 UTC,Something about Cubs fans being optimistic really pisses some people off.
CHICubs,3csur1,wretch5150,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:57:46 2015 UTC,Being optimistic on the cubs.com forums leads to similar responses from the trolls.

CHICubs,3ctdxh,airham,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:05:41 2015 UTC,Haha we can chalk it up to memory suppression for self-preservation.  It's a psychological phenomenon and entirely out of your control.  Just don't ever go to a shrink or it all might come flooding back.
CHICubs,3ctdxh,catch10110,3,Sat Jul 11 03:10:49 2015 UTC,147! Who knew Milton Bradley and Ian Stewart played for the Cubs???

CHICubs,3ctdxh,herptydurr,6,Fri Jul 10 17:10:35 2015 UTC,I have conveniently wiped their existences from my memory.
CHICubs,3ctdxh,DrunkenSuperman,5,Fri Jul 10 17:18:04 2015 UTC,"Ugh.  Milton Bradley.  I was at the game he threw the ball into the stands with 2 outs and runners on base, thinking there were three outs."

And even though I only started following baseball in 2003, I kind of feel bad that the only guys I could think of before then were Sosa, Grace, Sandberg, and Maddux."

CHICubs,3ctv13,LonghornPride05,2,Sat Jul 11 15:01:33 2015 UTC,What about Hendricks?
CHICubs,3ctv13,cthululover813,2,Sun Jul 12 20:44:33 2015 UTC,Thank you for reminding me why I don't want  more than 1 starter signed this upcoming offseason
CHICubs,3cta1k,voidecho,4,Fri Jul 10 16:25:50 2015 UTC,"Chicago appeared to be the long shot due to being over the maximum penalty under the international signing guidelines.   It's actually the opposite of this. The Cubs have a good shot at signing him because they are already at the maximum penalty and signing Martinez won't put them over. Other teams that aren't already paying those penalties will be reluctant to go over and miss out on big IFA signings next year when most of the big spending teams are out. The Cubs are already out for next year, so they will want to get as much talent out of this year as they can."
CHICubs,3cta1k,SomeoneSomethingJr,2,Fri Jul 10 20:22:38 2015 UTC,"My guess is what the author meant is that because Martinez was eligible to sign before July 2, the Cubs were a dark horse because they could only sign him if he decided to wait until after July 2."

CHICubs,3cte5t,pm_me_ur_pajamas,3,Fri Jul 10 17:31:04 2015 UTC,"Cease is so much more projectable; I have to squint pretty hard to see  Sands as better than a #5 starter, and it's not like he has a super high floor, either."

CHICubs,3cw0y8,jmr33090,5,Sun Jul 12 21:40:45 2015 UTC,"Agreed. You have to watch the way people pitch to him compared to Bryant. That's not to say Joc is bad or anything, but that Bryant is already being pitched to like an MVP."
CHICubs,3cw0y8,Sephiroth007,5,Sat Jul 11 16:37:51 2015 UTC,"Joc is only .2 WAR behind Bryant with stellar defense and good power.   He also has a better walk rate, and a better wRC+. So, people talking up Joc is justified. They are both great players."
CHICubs,3cw0y8,WhiteRabbit13,2,Sat Jul 11 15:37:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and Joc has a very slight advantage in OPS, although that can change within a game. But Joc is also a CF, and that position is more important than 3B. But it's very close anyway."
CHICubs,3cw0y8,RushLimbaughIsFat,7,Sun Jul 12 02:32:24 2015 UTC,He's had more time to play than KB. He's really good on defense and has power for days + he's on the Dodgers gives him a lot more exposure etc. he's had the better first half KB will have a way better second half then him.
CHICubs,3cw0y8,HeatRavensCubs,2,Sat Jul 11 06:34:53 2015 UTC,"I don't like how some people is talking about Joc (completely justified) as 1a, and Maikel Franco (go look at the stats, really, it's ridiculous) as 1B.  KB and Joc are 1a and 1b right now, and either could deserve the award if it was given away right now."
CHICubs,3cw0y8,Loop_Within_A_Loop,2,Sat Jul 11 15:41:50 2015 UTC,Joc has severely cooled from his hot start
CHICubs,3cw0y8,Sparx7,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:01:09 2015 UTC,"I think people get really caught up in his average. While low, his OBP is remarkably high considering that low average. He plays awesome defense in center, has a great approach, and obviously has enormous power. Once he cuts down on the Ks a little bit, he is going to be even better."
CHICubs,3cw0y8,AllAboutDatTwtw,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:49:27 2015 UTC,I think it's pretty much dead even right now and could go either way if the season ended today.  Maybe slight edge to Pederson especially when considering defense.  I think Bryant will pass him up by year end.

CHICubs,3crqc0,object_on_my_desk,6,Fri Jul 10 12:46:30 2015 UTC,The crazy thing always was he had better command of his slider (which still stands as the filthiest pitch I've ever seen) and he couldn't spot his 2-seamer
CHICubs,3crqc0,Battle_Sheep,4,Fri Jul 10 15:06:57 2015 UTC,"Dude?  he produced for like 3 years easy, then it just went to hell."

CHICubs,3crqc0,Neymanly,2,Fri Jul 10 15:04:11 2015 UTC,"I think Grimm and Ramirez are the two arms in the bullpen most likely to stick around. Apparently Maddon has said Grimm has the stuff to be a closer ""he just needs a little seasoning"""

Maddux, Prior, Wood"
CHICubs,3crqc0,oldmangandalfstyle,3,Fri Jul 10 07:07:49 2015 UTC,Uhhhhhhh... I think this is actually an example of holding on to somebody well past their prime.
CHICubs,3crqc0,tbv93,-1,Fri Jul 10 14:56:57 2015 UTC,He had a prime?
CHICubs,3crqc0,BadKingdom,11,Fri Jul 10 14:59:47 2015 UTC,Seriously?  Go back and look at his 2010 season:   2.8 fWAR An absurd 15.99 (!!) k/9 Opponents batted just .147 against him and his FIP was 2.01   Marmol was ridiculously fun to watch that year.  Batters could barely make contact (he only gave up 1 home run all season) and more often than not they would swing and miss badly.
CHICubs,3crqc0,windydruid,2,Fri Jul 10 16:02:52 2015 UTC,There were a few times we could have traded him for almost anyone but didn't.
CHICubs,3crqc0,oldmangandalfstyle,6,Fri Jul 10 20:16:58 2015 UTC,"When Mármol was pitching and not blowing every single save, I was like 16, or younger. I remember him consistently getting himself into shitty situations, with Wrigley going nuts waiting for the win, then somehow he would get out of it. I remember a sick slider making people look silly. I loved watching Marmol and he was one of my favorite players on the team. Then he blew save, after save, after save, after save, and then he blew some more and I never have disliked a player more. But, unless my memory is completely wrong, he was a fantastic closer, just high stress."
CHICubs,3crqc0,MrJigglyBrown,2,Fri Jul 10 15:04:46 2015 UTC,I feel like Joe Maddon would have utilized him amazing. The stress of hte 9th getting to him? Put him in the 7th for a while. It's too bad.
CHICubs,3crqc0,Big_Gringo,3,Fri Jul 10 15:09:23 2015 UTC,"Sometimes the 7th is a more high leverage situation anyways, Rondon has been lights out since ""losing"" the closer job."
CHICubs,3crdxu,Riley_Cubs,12,Fri Jul 10 04:03:32 2015 UTC,"Soler is a blast to watch, even if he's out of the ROY talk at this point. He has such a high upside. You just have that feeling he is a player who is going to suddenly go on a 10 game hitting streak, hit 5HR over 3 games, and ignite the team.  (Hopefully the HR's against the Cards in September, but I'll of course take it as early as this month.)"
CHICubs,3crdxu,Nexhume,5,Fri Jul 10 06:39:45 2015 UTC,"If they have to come in October, I'll take that too."
CHICubs,3crdxu,Tibbel,8,Fri Jul 10 13:42:50 2015 UTC,"Very nice to have him back in the lineup. He's had his struggles, but having someone that can mash the ball like that is a sight for sore eyes."
CHICubs,3crdxu,StewartDuck,8,Fri Jul 10 04:49:46 2015 UTC,"While the potential for serious damage is always there with Soler, I'm partial to Rizzo myself. Watching him determine the at-bat with his plate discipline is fascinating to watch."
CHICubs,3crdxu,FredKarlekKnark,3,Fri Jul 10 11:53:30 2015 UTC,"When Rizzo is at the plate, I stop what I'm doing and he gets all my attention. I love watching his at bats."
CHICubs,3crdxu,jmr33090,3,Fri Jul 10 14:23:19 2015 UTC,For sure. His is the next Jersey I want to get.
CHICubs,3crdxu,HotYoungTeen,5,Fri Jul 10 04:08:38 2015 UTC,"Got a Bryant jersey about a month ago, Soler and Rizzo are next on the list"
CHICubs,3crdxu,voidecho,3,Fri Jul 10 04:09:44 2015 UTC,As long as he keeps laying off the low outside sliders his swing is awesome.
CHICubs,3crdxu,euphoSZ,3,Fri Jul 10 04:31:23 2015 UTC,"He's gotten absolutely the worst strike calls I've ever seen someone receive. I think it's because he's so damn massive of a human being that the umps almost raise the strike zone a bit. I remember him being extremely patient at the plate and having a good sense of where the strike zone was during spring training, but ever since the start of the season he hasn't had the same plate discipline that he used to because of all the horrible calls.  I can't wait to watch him return to form tho, hopefully the same treatment doesn't continue because of his size."
CHICubs,3crdxu,decitertiember,2,Fri Jul 10 14:19:24 2015 UTC,I see a lot of upside in Soler. I think you are right to get excited.
CHICubs,3crdxu,LCFlapjack2,2,Fri Jul 10 11:09:32 2015 UTC,"With the lack of punch and run scoring lately, his bat back in the lineup sure is nice. Always feels like he's a threat to go yard."
CHICubs,3crdxu,Don_Tiny,2,Fri Jul 10 14:51:35 2015 UTC,"Once he's more consistent and I can quit referring to him as Cerrano, then yes I believe I would.  As another fella said, though, Rizzo is the at-bat to watch right now."
CHICubs,3crdxu,obeyonly,2,Fri Jul 10 15:05:22 2015 UTC,"We play so much better with him in the lineup it seems, great to have him back"
CHICubs,3crdxu,imbrady,2,Fri Jul 10 15:56:40 2015 UTC,"I like watching how fucking hard he hits the ball sometimes. I think his plate discipline will only improve too, thats the one thing that really needs to get better."
CHICubs,3crdxu,EvilFefe,2,Fri Jul 10 18:36:07 2015 UTC,I'm still used to him swinging at nothing and striking out. It's gonna take me a bit to get excited.
CHICubs,3crdxu,NLRD,2,Fri Jul 10 08:13:52 2015 UTC,"I don't like seeing him strike out over 30% of the time, but I hope that will improve.  He has the skills to be a very good hitter."

The Cardinals aren't going anywhere, and we're going to have to find ways to consistently beat them or at least split the season series. But it's the middle of July and we're got a wild card spot locked up with a 3-game lead and we're on pace for 89 wins. If you would have told me we would be in this situation at the start of the season I'd have been all for it."
CHICubs,3coyhz,maxelrod,12,Thu Jul 9 18:23:19 2015 UTC,Eh.  It's not the worst. We need to stop freaking out so much about St. Louis.   To borrow a phrase:  They are who we thought they were.  Win the series against the White Sox and get even more momentum going into the break and let's see what happens in August and September.
CHICubs,3coyhz,thefoolwhofollowshim,2,Thu Jul 9 16:46:28 2015 UTC,"The rest of July is VERY winnable for us. We beat the teams we should, and we'll be fine."
CHICubs,3coyhz,penguinopph,8,Fri Jul 10 02:29:33 2015 UTC,I think it's awesome to be upset about baseball right now. It means that there's still a reason to care. It feels good to feel bad sometimes.  wearegood

Also, that the recipe for success includes heart-breaking losses. Every team has these losses, and the good ones learn from it. This type of thing had to happen at least once this year. Just be glad it happened in July. October will be better because of it."

CHICubs,3cq5vr,ChicagoKoolAid,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:48:35 2015 UTC,"I was shocked at the amount of people who came to his defense after that. A guy who plays football as his job gets stuck in the wrong coverage on the biggest play of the year. I just bowed my head down as soon as I looked downfield and saw Cobb wide open, didn't lift it back up for a good 3 minutes after. All the life was just sucked out me as I was just void of emotion until I check twitter about half an hour later and find out the same guy who royally sucked the entire year is responsible for losing to our bitter arch rivals and a chance to go to the playoffs on an easily preventable play. Could not believe it. Call me a meathead but I would legitimately get angry every time his name was mentioned last year. Good riddance, but unfortunate he can't take my PTSD with him to Tampa."

CHICubs,3cqqfi,lickachiken,5,Fri Jul 10 01:20:53 2015 UTC,"Denorfia/Coghlan make a passable righty-lefty LF platoon or 1st pinch hitter combo. I ranked him up there based on how he's doing this year - out of all of the possible PH's to enter in the 7th+ inning (Denorfia, Coghlan, Baxter, Herrera, et al) he's the only one who gives me hope that we can get a rally going.  Not sure if he'll be around next year but he's been one of the quieter positive stories in MLB this year. But in my opinion Szczur is a better bet to fall into the Denorfia role next year."

Rizzo's only owed $59 million 2016-2021. 4 years of arbitration for Bryant would put him at $14.75/year average in arb to match. Very very possible."

It was the same zone all game, so you'd think one of the best in the game would be able to adjust, but instead if it's not to his liking then it's wrong.  I lost a lot of respect  for Molina last night.  He's the type of guy that can never be wrong and has to point fingers when things don't go his way."
CHICubs,3cpru1,TooLebowski,6,Thu Jul 9 22:18:12 2015 UTC,He's a punk. I never had much respect for him despite his obvious talent.

Never mess with a Catcher scorned It was a pitcher's pitch. Can't do much with that ball. It was in ""The strike zone."" I mean, the strike zone as defined. Was that pitched called before? There was one close. Am I mad? Kind of. He was calling a tight zone all day I wouldn't mind if he got hit in the nuts though"
CHICubs,3cpru1,THEriot2,7,Thu Jul 9 21:50:17 2015 UTC,"He was calling a tight zone all day   That's kinda my point. All I ever asked for was a consistent zone. But it was tight, and both ways, made especially worse by Hernandez's zone the night before.  Like Sullivan said, I think both sides are defensible and I would like to see the zone tighten a bit going forward (obvious hurdles there). I just thought Yadi's reaction during the play was absurd, and the only indefensible part."
CHICubs,3cpru1,voidecho,3,Thu Jul 9 22:05:26 2015 UTC,This guy's strike zone is what every ump should call.  The amount of leeway pitchers get on outside pitches to left handers is ridiculous.

Montero and Molina know better than anyone else what's getting called a strike and what isnt.  If Miggy knows pitches in that location aren't being called strikes and the pitch isn't to his liking he's smart to take the pitch.

CHICubs,3cplx2,75MillionForks,14,Thu Jul 9 19:33:08 2015 UTC,I think the HR Derby becomes a scapegoat when power hitters slump shortly after.
CHICubs,3cplx2,KCchemist,5,Thu Jul 9 20:03:49 2015 UTC,"Naw, if a guy can't find his normal swing after the derby, after a few days off, he's got some other issues that need to be addressed."
CHICubs,3cplx2,RustyDarkstar76,4,Thu Jul 9 20:46:17 2015 UTC,Correct me if I'm wrong but I remember hearing that Bryant did a HR Derby in college or last year in the minors. So I wouldn't be too worried about it changing his swing.
CHICubs,3cplx2,cubfan90,6,Thu Jul 9 19:53:27 2015 UTC,"Not only did he compete, he won the AA home run derby last year."

CHICubs,3cplx2,hawkscubs,3,Fri Jul 10 02:19:49 2015 UTC,I wouldn't worry about it messing up Bryant. He's said before in interviews that his swing is designed to hit the ball into the air. He'll likely not alter his swing much at all in the derby.
CHICubs,3cplx2,lmhtg,3,Fri Jul 10 01:37:43 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm glad to see that this seems to be a spooky story you tell baseball all stars around a campfire. ""Curse of the HR Derby"" O0ooOooOOoo0o0o"
CHICubs,3cplx2,yusuf69,2,Fri Jul 10 07:53:11 2015 UTC,"I think I remember hearing this from Sosa or the Cubs after he competed one year to explain his drop in power late in the season. I feel like it was a bit more of a) Sosa went balls out every home run derby because he loved it and b) the later he went in them the more violent his swing became.  I don't think this will be a problem with our two guys, even their home run swings tend to be composed. If anything I'd say it may help Bryant with his power a bit to get his groove back."
CHICubs,3cplx2,THEriot2,2,Thu Jul 9 21:26:46 2015 UTC,It's been disproven time and time again.
CHICubs,3cplx2,IBleedBlueBlood,2,Thu Jul 9 22:35:33 2015 UTC,"It's funny that everyone gets worked up about the derby ruining swings, I don't entirely buy into it.  However if anything, I can see Rizzos swing getting messed up, not Bryant's based on their swings. Rizzo's, in my opinion, isn't meant for HR derby. Bryant's got the power swing, plus he's been in one of these before so I feel like he'll know how to cope.  Tl;dr don't be worried about the derby messing up swings."
CHICubs,3cplx2,friendly-confines,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:47:34 2015 UTC,"Many times there is a guy or two that make the HR derby that are there simply because they hit more HR than they should have in the first half.  When the God of Mathematics decides to end the positive variance, fans like to point to the HR derby.  There was a player a couple years ago that mashed an insane number of HR before the break and sucked afterwards.  Everyone blamed it on the derby but his cold streak extended well before that.  Now to remember that guy.  Edit: Also, Rizzo has had a rough past month at the plate.  If this continues through the end of July, fans will probably start to notice more and blame the Derby, even though it has been ongoing for a while."

He's hit worse than Pete Kozma over the last 40 days.  Molina probably shouldn't be on the team either over Cervelli, but Wong should over LeMahieu. Martinez and Lynn are more deserving than Wacha (and Bumgarner.) So is Arrieta."
CHICubs,3cl8z7,DlSCOSTU,3,Thu Jul 9 03:40:08 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen much if any complaining either. Carpenter doesn't really deserve a nod given his recent (and prolonged) struggles. I would also like for him to have an extended rest to try to get back on track.   And let's also remember the All Star game is for show and the bigger name and draw is Bryant by far. He also gives the NL a better chance at winning over Carpenter although I believe Bryant to be a ""bubble"" All Star this year anyway."

CHICubs,3cmub9,RunningJokes,2,Thu Jul 9 09:32:25 2015 UTC,He needs to start practicing strictly from the right side because I don't think just jumping over there in game will work. He needs a couple weeks of strictly hitting right handed in practice. If he just starts hitting right handed I wouldn't throw anything but breaking balls as a righty because it's gonna be a completely different look for him. He's not used to pitches ever just dropping away from him. I do think he needs to eventually just bat righty though.
CHICubs,3cmub9,dpete10,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:48:41 2015 UTC,That's a good point and something he definitely should start working on immediately.
CHICubs,3cmub9,RunningJokes,2,Thu Jul 9 16:39:40 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm hoping he is because he has been hitting really well from that side which tells me it's the swing and not that he isn't seeing the ball well

Nope, all snatched away in one swing. All that momentum gone. Everyone's excitement is crushed. However, today is a new day. The beauty of baseball."

CHICubs,3cmub9,Baybears,3,Thu Jul 9 04:11:19 2015 UTC,We earned that game right back from them. The way our bullpen has been playing it should have been a lock statically speaking. It's baseball and shit happens though. Sox are next.

CHICubs,3cmub9,octobadger,20,Thu Jul 9 03:22:50 2015 UTC,"We split with the Cardinals, took the doubleheader. Yeah, this one breaks my heart, but objectively we did pretty well. The offense has been producing and our starting pitching still kicks ass."
CHICubs,3cmub9,Ganesha811,8,Thu Jul 9 03:21:39 2015 UTC,"Too bad Hammel went out so early, could have ended very differently"
CHICubs,3cmub9,Cohaagan,7,Thu Jul 9 03:28:27 2015 UTC,"If Hammel weren't out so early, if Castro's hit dropped 3 inches to the right, if anyone but Strop were pitching, if he hadn't walked Carpenter, if that homer went six inches less... Not only do we have bad luck, the Cardinals have ridiculously good luck. Maybe that's why I hate them so much."
CHICubs,3cmub9,aussum_possum,3,Thu Jul 9 03:32:06 2015 UTC,If anyone but Richard pitches we probably win the game
CHICubs,3cmub9,TandBusquets,6,Thu Jul 9 03:39:11 2015 UTC,"I actually said out loud to myself ""Why not Wood?"" Makes sense to me to send out our former 4/5 guy instead of Richard"
CHICubs,3cmub9,Cohaagan,0,Thu Jul 9 03:48:43 2015 UTC,"You can talk about the Cardinal luck, but yesterday the Cubs rally stared entirely because of a ball that was objectively foul. It's not like the Cardinals somehow have more luck than other teams. If they did, it would be skill, not luck."
CHICubs,3cmub9,SgtNicholasAngel,4,Thu Jul 9 03:53:04 2015 UTC,"Not disagreeing with your intent, because luck really does go both ways, but ""objectively"" foul..?"
CHICubs,3cmub9,i4_D_4_Mi,3,Thu Jul 9 04:28:32 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. I don't like the loss, but at least our offense is getting out of that slump they seemed to be in, our pitching is still great minus a few players, and we played a great game against the team with the best record in the MLB, and took a doubleheader from them yesterday.   Things suck right now because this loss is still fresh, we should be able to at least take 2 from the Sox this weekend, and then get some fresh blood and rested players after the all-star break. We're still in a wild card spot and we'll get closer to either the Pirates or Cards when they finish beating up on each other this weekend, and the rest of July looks hella easy compared to our June.   TL;DR: This shit sucks, but we're still doing pretty well, and should continue to through at least this month."
CHICubs,3cmub9,SpoonThief,3,Thu Jul 9 03:35:06 2015 UTC,No this is such a demoralizing loss I'm afraid it doesn't even matter that we split   I'm so sad
CHICubs,3cmub9,Riderz_of_Brohan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:35:51 2015 UTC,"I mean, not to be pessimistic, but objectively we didn't do well -- we should win at home.   Plus, the circumstances of this game...ugh.  For me, the bright side is that I cared enough to watch the last half inning -- that might not have happened 2012-2014. The fact that this one sucks so bad is a good indication that we're good again."
CHICubs,3cmub9,morningsaystoidleon,9,Thu Jul 9 03:30:21 2015 UTC,Hopefully Hammel is ok.
CHICubs,3cmub9,LarryHolmes,7,Thu Jul 9 03:20:59 2015 UTC,"Well that went from best game of the season, to worst game of the season :("
CHICubs,3cmub9,keigs,9,Thu Jul 9 03:23:51 2015 UTC,Sorry the game didn't go your guys way but thanks for letting me hang out!
CHICubs,3cmub9,Johnnyboy_34,6,Thu Jul 9 03:25:15 2015 UTC,Come back any time! :)  Hopefully next time you stop by isn't so gut wrenching.
CHICubs,3cmub9,zdruck07,9,Thu Jul 9 03:28:05 2015 UTC,"I'm a DC sports fan, I'm used to it hahahaha cries"
CHICubs,3cmub9,Johnnyboy_34,8,Thu Jul 9 03:33:36 2015 UTC,At least we have the best flairs in baseball
CHICubs,3cmub9,Big_Gringo,5,Thu Jul 9 04:35:16 2015 UTC,Bob Costas sums up my feelings right about now.
CHICubs,3cmub9,PBRandWings,20,Thu Jul 9 03:37:41 2015 UTC,I don't give a shit what any Debbie downers have to say. I love what I saw from this team tonight. Our stud pitcher goes down after 1 bring in a guy gives up 4 runs with an all star pitcher on the mound. This team fought back and put themselves in position to win. At the end of the day we split w a team who has the best record in baseball while we had a no namer on the mound and one of the youngest lineups in baseball vs their ace. #wearegood
CHICubs,3cmub9,Sparx7,3,Thu Jul 9 03:23:39 2015 UTC,"Until we stop settling for this shit nothing is going to change. Yes, we fought back. Yes, it was against the Cardinals. Fuck it though, I'm SICK of saying ""we fought back and the other team is just better"" we need to play better and start being that ""other"" team. How about the Cubs start being dominant and have other teams' fans start offering excuses when they lose close games.   sorry for the rant i'm drunk"
CHICubs,3cmub9,datassremainsthesame,2,Thu Jul 9 03:27:15 2015 UTC,I'm not settling for shit. We got swept in a 3 game series vs them last time. This time we split a 4 gamer. The offense showed life against a top notch pitcher. Yeah I want the win but if I told you we went 2-2 vs them before the series and we showed some offense you'd be pretty fucking happy
CHICubs,3cmub9,Sparx7,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:29:14 2015 UTC,"I get that they're good, but there's no way the Cubs can't win 3/4 vs the Cards at home. Cubbies are actually good; I'm not going to be happy with a split at home. Not this year, and not in the future."
CHICubs,3cmub9,datassremainsthesame,2,Thu Jul 9 03:32:19 2015 UTC,"Dude, we haven't looked like this for 7 years. I know it hurt. I was there. But as you say, we are suddenly back in contention this year and it feels great. I'm not gonna be happy with splits either, but I'm happy with our direction for the first time in a long time."
CHICubs,3cmub9,totheloop,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:35:02 2015 UTC,"I get that the game showed promising traits from some of our guys, but if we miss the playoffs by just one game this year, this will be the game everyone points to as the deciding factor. A loss is still a loss, no matter how hard we played. If we weren't competing for a playoff spot, I would agree with you 100%, but we are. That's not to say you are wrong, though. This game did show that down the road we will be on the winning end of games like these, but it also shows that we still have big holes to fill if we truly want to be contenders."
CHICubs,3cmub9,-Goonzilla-,5,Thu Jul 9 03:36:58 2015 UTC,No the deciding factor is losing to teams like the Brewers. We have one of the easiest schedules of the 2nd half. Finish this strong and kill it the rest of this month
CHICubs,3cmub9,Sparx7,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:40:05 2015 UTC,"That's part of it as well. Not sure if it's my former prick of a high school coach talking or not, but I don't like to ever think of a loss as a moral victory. I guess I'm just still really butthurt by it all... :("
CHICubs,3cmub9,-Goonzilla-,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:44:54 2015 UTC,Such great timing to have tomorrow off after a 4 game set in 3 days that ended like this.
CHICubs,3cmub9,RyanTheCubsSTH,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:23:10 2015 UTC,"Can't tell if you are being sarcastic or not, but personally I find it annoying to have the day off tomorrow. The way this ended tonight makes me want to get back out there tomorrow and kick the shit outta whoever we play next, which is luckily the Sux. Got some good baseball ahead of us."
CHICubs,3cmub9,spenoburger,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:48:20 2015 UTC,As a player I'd want to get back out there but as a fan I feel like its better for the players to have tomorrow to regroup and do their own thing because they've spent a lot of time around each other and a day off cant be a bad thing. Few more games and a few days off so go all out and lets take the Sox series.
CHICubs,3cmub9,RyanTheCubsSTH,4,Thu Jul 9 05:51:38 2015 UTC,Yeah. This was NOT the game to point to. We played fucking hard. Those brewer games? Absolutely not. Those will be the ones.
CHICubs,3cmub9,totheloop,3,Thu Jul 9 03:45:17 2015 UTC,but if we miss the playoffs by just one game this year   You could say that about any game we lose this season.
CHICubs,3cmub9,lickachiken,0,Thu Jul 9 04:31:20 2015 UTC,This this 100x this.
CHICubs,3cmub9,TheBostonPops,8,Thu Jul 9 03:27:20 2015 UTC,"You know what, taking two from the Cardinals is fine. I'm happy with that.  We were a strike away from the third best record in the NL. We are doing damn good.   Let's sweep the Sox!"
CHICubs,3cmub9,FxStryker,4,Thu Jul 9 04:16:06 2015 UTC,That was a fucking nail-biter of a game. Sucks that it didn't go our way. Especially after coming so close. But the Cubs put up a good fight tonight.
CHICubs,3cmub9,HotYoungTeen,4,Thu Jul 9 03:21:29 2015 UTC,"Worst loss of the season, and coincidentally the first game I went to  That would have been a season changing win. Instead just another run of the mill loss to the cardinals.   I love this team but I can't tell you how mad at them I am. Especially strop"
CHICubs,3cmub9,Riderz_of_Brohan,2,Thu Jul 9 03:22:59 2015 UTC,it wasn't run of the mill at all. we came back from having an emergency pitcher get absolutely wrecked. the old cubs wouldn't have even scored.
CHICubs,3cmub9,imeatingpancakes,4,Thu Jul 9 03:38:20 2015 UTC,"ALOT of good to take from this game and this series in general. The bats are starting to slowly come alive, pitching was good as usual and we showed a lot of heart coming back from 4-0 tonight. Sucks that Strop had to shit the bed but he has been pretty solid this year as has the bullpen as a whole the last few months.  Let's sweep the sox!"
CHICubs,3cmub9,imbrady,5,Thu Jul 9 03:46:47 2015 UTC,"Look, I've been a Cubs fan since 88 living in Texas watching the Cubbies on WGN as a child.  My dad has literally told me his greatest failure of a father was not making me a Cardinals fan.  I once bought him a blue STL hat as a  father's day gift back in 94 or whatever. Worse $20 I have ever spent.  He knows nothing about his supposed team and yet they continue to beat us.  I am sick and tired of losing to this team.  Go CUBS GO!"
CHICubs,3cmub9,tsmft05,9,Thu Jul 9 06:08:07 2015 UTC,Fuck shit.
CHICubs,3cmub9,Patrick_Kane,6,Thu Jul 9 03:21:22 2015 UTC,Cock balls.
CHICubs,3cmub9,Patrick_Kane,7,Thu Jul 9 03:21:34 2015 UTC,"Wrong team won, but a heck of a game, and a good intro to Wrigley :)  I hope to be back again soon!"
CHICubs,3cmub9,muffley,2,Thu Jul 9 03:25:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks, hope you had fun visiting :)"
CHICubs,3cmub9,TheBostonPops,4,Thu Jul 9 03:28:31 2015 UTC,Wow. That's baseball for you.
CHICubs,3cmub9,pis_arent_squared,5,Thu Jul 9 03:21:40 2015 UTC,"Great game by the cubies, coming that close to winning after hammel going down in the 1st is incredible. We didnt look like we could beat the cards in the playoffs last series, but how this series went, i know we have a shot"
CHICubs,3cmub9,BpFal3,3,Thu Jul 9 03:22:41 2015 UTC,Should have been Strop then Rondon. What a way to lose a fucking game.
CHICubs,3cmub9,offbelmont_el,4,Thu Jul 9 03:26:34 2015 UTC,Leaving those runners on base in the 8th is pissing me off even more now.
CHICubs,3cmub9,jp611,5,Thu Jul 9 03:38:37 2015 UTC,"I decided to follow Maddon's go-to philosophy. I was really bummed and pissed off for like a half hour. Then I let it go. Life is far too short to stew on this until Friday.  I reserve the right to be overjoyed at wins for much longer, though. Fan privilege."
CHICubs,3cmub9,erindizmo,4,Thu Jul 9 04:12:16 2015 UTC,Not a fucking game we should've lost. Strop is a great reliever but not a closer. I like not using Rondon to close because he is the best RP we have and should be used in highest leverage situations. Motte or Grimm should've been in there.
CHICubs,3cmub9,Big_Gringo,2,Thu Jul 9 04:16:13 2015 UTC,both were unavailable.... they pitched in the doubleheader. strop was the obvious choice. actually the only choice.
CHICubs,3cmub9,zrk23,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:03:29 2015 UTC,I would've flipped strop and rondon.
CHICubs,3cmub9,Tjagra,11,Thu Jul 9 05:46:22 2015 UTC,"Cubs bros, if our games have been this exciting so far with neither of us being at quite 100% in most of our matchups so far, I'm quite looking forward to (aka dreading) our post-All-Star break games."

CHICubs,3cmub9,NinjaChucho,14,Thu Jul 9 03:26:52 2015 UTC,Yeah looking past the salt definitely an exciting series... See you after the break! Oh fuck you too!*  *legally obligated to say that
CHICubs,3cmub9,andyousaychicity,7,Thu Jul 9 03:29:38 2015 UTC,"That was a good game by both teams, love this rivalry even though I hate your team. Cheers and thanks for being a good sport! Too much salt lately"
CHICubs,3cmub9,Cohaagan,5,Thu Jul 9 03:36:18 2015 UTC,"At least we know we can play with them, and are getting in their heads"
CHICubs,3cmub9,Gewehr98,6,Thu Jul 9 03:21:34 2015 UTC,"We lost our starter after 1 inning. We battled back from 0-4 down. This was an excellent effort by the team as a whole to battle back and put up a fight. No one should be disappointed by this team today. The conclusion yes, team no."
CHICubs,3cmub9,LonghornPride05,3,Thu Jul 9 03:36:34 2015 UTC,Ruined my birthday Strop
CHICubs,3cmub9,STUstone,3,Thu Jul 9 03:24:49 2015 UTC,"Blown saves are going to happen....it just sucks it had to happen against the cards.   But man, 2 - 2 isn't bad and the whole series was exciting. I'm hoping cards cubs games are going to be crazy the next 10 years"
CHICubs,3cmub9,uhhhhmmmm,3,Thu Jul 9 03:25:27 2015 UTC,That one hurts.  While a split is nice.  We had 3 out of 4 win and our SP got jobbed in Game 1.  We should have won 3 of these games.  It sucks.  Take 2 of 3 from the White Sox now this weekend.
CHICubs,3cmub9,jp611,3,Thu Jul 9 03:28:05 2015 UTC,3 of 3
CHICubs,3cmub9,GoCubsGo2015,3,Thu Jul 9 03:30:44 2015 UTC,"I'm worried if I let this game hang around my brain for too long it might overshadow all the good they did I'm this game and this first half so I'm going to delete it from my memory and just move on. Before I do, hat tip to Travis Wood. He's been pretty bad this year but he just seems to have a feel for the moment sometimes and really bails this team out. Great work tonight. And.... Poof this game is gone. Beat the effing white sox."
CHICubs,3cmub9,TheFakeTimShady,3,Thu Jul 9 03:46:36 2015 UTC,Strop has 13 earned runs all year.  7 are to the Cardinals.

CHICubs,3cmub9,big-mo,2,Thu Jul 9 03:21:13 2015 UTC,Tough to win when one of your best pitchers has to walk away from the mound due to injury.  Proud to see 'em still duke it out to the very end though.
CHICubs,3cmub9,rwazo1,2,Thu Jul 9 03:23:37 2015 UTC,"Heartbreaking. The guys made a great run at it. Proud of them, we're not going to be down for long."
CHICubs,3cmub9,TheBostonPops,2,Thu Jul 9 03:23:38 2015 UTC,Very glad we have the day off tomorrow.  The boys will need it to digest this game and regroup.
CHICubs,3cmub9,Trakis,2,Thu Jul 9 03:23:38 2015 UTC,My heart hurts. Hardest loss of the year for sure. Let's just... keep our heads up?
CHICubs,3cmub9,Steal_Your_Base,2,Thu Jul 9 03:23:49 2015 UTC,"It's gonna be fine. They played so hard today; this felt like a playoff game in a playoff series and they learned that they are able to take the fight to the cards. They came back from 4-0, remember. We didn't see a thing like that 2 weeks ago."
CHICubs,3cmub9,totheloop,2,Thu Jul 9 04:16:49 2015 UTC,"They are the best team in baseball for a reason. As much as this loss hurts, we played well even after our best pitcher exited after the 1st. And we put up 5 against Wacha tonight! Good game, just couldn't finish it out"
CHICubs,3cmub9,BooniSmells,2,Thu Jul 9 03:25:43 2015 UTC,Helluva of a game. Time to apologize to my dog for all the screaming.

Oh well, on the plus side this is still basically a rookie team and the beginning of the new era, and for having our All-star caliber pitcher go out in the first and still coming back to have the lead is something to be hopeful for.  I greatly look forward to this team when it has its shit together. That and when Schwarber comes up"
CHICubs,3cmub9,LegacyLemur,6,Thu Jul 9 03:33:56 2015 UTC,"Ok, first off, fuck St Louis  Secondly, tonight is a learning moment. We were on the verge of all absolutely losing our minds with ""10 games over"" and ""first place or bust"" tongue-in-cheek celebrations.   And that would have really been fun :)  But, well, this young team still has a ways to go. And even though it's 100% one dude's fault tonight, this team isn't yet a finished product. We've got to work a little bit harder to get where we want to be, and against teams like the fucking shit birds, you can't make one single mistake.   I'm as heartbroken as I've been all year, but this season is long, the team is young, and it's a new day tomorrow.   Fuck you Cardinals, we'll see you again. I'm going to go make a drink"

CHICubs,3cmub9,Cest_La_Vie21,2,Thu Jul 9 04:03:21 2015 UTC,"You know, a lot of us thought this game was over after 3 1/2 innings and it was 4-0?  It's a rough loss to swallow but the Cubs gave us a lot of heart tonight and considering the circumstances (losing Hammel early, facing Wacha, Richard being on short rest, Motte unavailable) they gave us 9 innings of baseball when we expected much less.  We know the Cardinals aren't unstoppable, and hopefully the next half the season will show that. Go Cubbies. I'm proud even on nights like these to bleed Cubbie blue. We are good. I love this team."
CHICubs,3cmub9,Defused_Bomb,5,Thu Jul 9 03:27:02 2015 UTC,"These things happen.  Strop is a damn good reliever.  He made a bad pitch, every pitcher does it at times... Even very good set up men."

CHICubs,3cmub9,Cpt_Hook,2,Thu Jul 9 03:29:41 2015 UTC,people also are conditioned to the cubs choking so they try to cut out to avoid heartbreak
CHICubs,3cmub9,Gewehr98,2,Thu Jul 9 03:23:54 2015 UTC,"I'm with ya. Haven't been in gdt's since game 1 of the series and I've been enjoying the games much more. I get frustrated like anyone else but not placing myself in an echo chamber of hysteric negativity has really helped.  It was nice to see addison get that clutch hit in the 9th tonight, and it seems out offense is finally showing signs of life. This was a punch in the gut, but theres still lots of good things on the way and lots of baseball to play."
CHICubs,3cmub9,Solleret,2,Thu Jul 9 03:37:52 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear it, I'm definitely going with that then. We'll be fine, Cards are the best team in baseball right now... shudders"

That being said, this would have been a completely different ball game if he was able to start and go 5-6 innings. Our middle relief just isn't as strong as the back end of our bullpen. Fun game to watch, but damn, this one hurts bad."
CHICubs,3cmub9,Den1mChiken,3,Thu Jul 9 03:28:23 2015 UTC,Middle relief-0 runs  One inning guys-2 runs
CHICubs,3cmub9,ilovelamp42,2,Thu Jul 9 03:31:54 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say this game was a norm example. And the middle relief technically allowed 4 runs tonight. Richard is a starter but he came in relief and wasn't prepared to start. The point I'm making is we tend to win more when our starters go 5-6 innings. It sounds cliche, but if you look at our bullpen's stats, our 7-8-9th innning guys are doing extremely well compared to our middle relief guys."
CHICubs,3cmub9,Den1mChiken,2,Thu Jul 9 03:44:40 2015 UTC,we dont have middle relief guys. we have EJax and wood who r doing fine. the rest of the guys pitches by committee depending on the matchup and everyone is fine.
CHICubs,3cmub9,zrk23,2,Thu Jul 9 05:13:01 2015 UTC,"I would argue Jackson and Wood are Long Relief, while Grimm, Russell, Schlitter, and the likes are Middle Relief. You rarely see Motte, Strop, or Rondon before the 7th inning. I think the bullpen as a whole is much improved, and are doing well. But the back end has held up better than the middle for most of the year."

CHICubs,3cnhn6,sjrossman0,5,Thu Jul 9 07:27:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone knows how to fix Castro. I could see moving him closer to the plate being a good idea, and hopefully that would cause him to make better contact (cuz you know his not going to stop swinging) with pitches far out in the outer half.   Personally I would consider batting him leadoff. I know we want him to be an RBI raker, but right now his killing us by failing at doing so. Having Castro at leadoff would give him protection (that he needs) with Rizzo and Bryant right behind him, and he could just concentrate on making good contact. It's unsustainable because Castro will never have a high on base percentage, but I think this will give Castro a chance to find his stroke again.  I like Couglan in the role of leadoff a lot more, but his not an everyday starter according to Maddon, so while Castro is, I think it would be wise to put him in that role. Especially with Fowler struggling too.  To bring it back to you what your saying OP, I think this is a great place to work on mechanics too. He try maybe some different things, so he can make good contact again, without the pressure of grounding out into another double play."
CHICubs,3cnhn6,doctorjohn666,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:34:16 2015 UTC,If anything move him down in the lineup. Having protection behind him isn't going to fix his swing mechanics.  I like the idea of Coghlan leading off against Righties and Fowler lead off against Lefties.  Fowler currently has over 100 points higher OBP and AVG against lefties.
CHICubs,3cnhn6,kwruffner,2,Thu Jul 9 15:57:30 2015 UTC,"I'm a big Castro fan and one thing I've noticed is that he takes the first pitch EVERY time, I realize it's better to work counts but that is what made Castro so successful before. He is thinking way too much at the plate, he just needs to simplify things."
CHICubs,3cnhn6,0mousedog,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:37:18 2015 UTC,"I can't find the stats showing how often he takes the first pitch, but I did find something else that was interesting.   For his career, after Castro begins a count 1-0, he has an OPS of .762. When he starts 0-1, his OPS is only .663. Nothing unusual about that. Most players probably do better when they get ahead in the count.   But this year, Castro has an OPS of .589 when he gets ahead 1-0 compared to .622 when he gets behind 0-1.   Even though he's been terrible overall this season, you'd still expect him to be better after getting ahead in the count. Not sure what to make of it though."
CHICubs,3cnhn6,Asmodeus10,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:37:59 2015 UTC,"I mentioned this last night in the GDT. If he would just move closer to the plate, not far, just like 3-4 inches, it could really help his swing on the outside corner. Right now, his swings out there look absolutely fucking awful."
CHICubs,3cnhn6,jmr33090,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:33:14 2015 UTC,"That motherfucker Castro plays with my emotions. Every time I think 'we need to trade this guy', he comes up with a clutch hit or does something else to make me reconsider. His tendency to hit into DP's and commit errors, combined with game winning hits make it such a love/hate relationship"
CHICubs,3cnhn6,LCFlapjack2,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:00:17 2015 UTC,I don't know why he hasn't changed his batting approach. Stepping towards third eliminates a lot of his power and if the pitch is outside he is forced to lunge at the ball (which he does all the time). There's just not a lot of good contact that can come from him lunging when he swings.
CHICubs,3cnhn6,tbv93,2,Thu Jul 9 11:35:10 2015 UTC,He has been making adjustments; bp wrigleyville just did a feature piece on his swing: http://wrigleyville.locals.baseballprospectus.com/2015/07/08/starlin-castro-remaking-strides/

As fans, shit happens, and losses like this suck but they don't count any more than being on the business end of a 10-0 blowout. No one will likely pull off what the O's did last year where they never blew a 9th inning lead, and the best thing we can do is to go back out there tomorrow Friday and support everyone, including Strop, as if they're the greatest damn team on the planet.

CHICubs,3cmxas,voidecho,3,Thu Jul 9 03:47:27 2015 UTC,Yes. He's been very very effective. Makes me cringe when I read comments about how awful he is and how he shouldn't be on the team. I don't necessarily like him in the closer role but that can be debated.
CHICubs,3cmxas,ViaChicago3441,2,Thu Jul 9 04:07:47 2015 UTC,"I'd really like to see Rondon back in the closer role as the primary option. Yes, he blew a couple saves in a 3 appearance span this year, but he's got much better control that Strop. Strop has better stuff, and he's very good, but can be inconsistent with hitting his spots. The walk to Carpenter last night was absolutely awful."
CHICubs,3cmxas,jmr33090,2,Thu Jul 9 14:37:41 2015 UTC,"nah, i disagree… his slider was electric and completely dominant, yet on 1-2 to a home-run hitting Jhonny Peralta, Strop lays a 2-seamer up and in when he could've (AND SHOULD HAVE) thrown 2 sliders low. I don't care if the first was in the strike zone, but the BEST Peralta could have done with a low slider would be single up the middle. WORST FUCKING PITCH CALL EVER. If it comes out who called it, which I highly doubt it does, I'm calling for that idiot's head (at least for a bit). If Montero called that pitch, Strop needs to have the balls and the self-awareness to call him off and throw his damn moneymaker!!!  That is all. Let's fuck up the White Sox"
CHICubs,3cmxas,Chicago_Sports,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:52:04 2015 UTC,This isn't about one pitch though.  This is about him playing poorly against the Cards in 2/3rds of his outings against them.  He's given up 7 earned runs against the Cardinals vs 6 against everyone else in 10 times the innings.     The walk to Carpenter was worse than the HR in my opinion.
CHICubs,3cmxas,cubswinagain,2,Thu Jul 9 18:13:47 2015 UTC,"I feel comfortable with Strop pitching against any other team. But no way in hell should he be pitching against St. Louis. Whether it is all mental, or St. Louis just has his number, Strop cannot pitch effectively against the Cardinals."
CHICubs,3cmxas,gfcolli,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:01:18 2015 UTC,"We have a lot of pitchers better in the back end of the bullpen than Strop.  I would take any of them in the late innings over him.  That includes Motte, Ramirez, Grimm, and Rondon."

CHICubs,3cmd1v,pujoljunkie,6,Thu Jul 9 00:59:37 2015 UTC,You don't touch Addi man. We're not making the mistake Oakland did.
CHICubs,3cmd1v,Dhash23,3,Thu Jul 9 04:29:52 2015 UTC,And we gave up a low end #1-#2 starter to get him!
CHICubs,3cmd1v,Pseudonova,3,Thu Jul 9 16:14:45 2015 UTC,"I really think that the only guy who's getting traded next year, no trades this year is gonna be Baez and Dan Vogelbach.  I think Starlin's moving to second, Russell to Short.  Then again I'm not a gm for obvious reasons."
CHICubs,3cmd1v,RustyDarkstar76,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:06:07 2015 UTC,What kind of package do Cubs fans expect in return for Baez? What about Vogelbach?
CHICubs,3cmd1v,RustyDarkstar76,5,Thu Jul 9 01:11:20 2015 UTC,"Vogelbach   Not much dudes just a DH, Baez...I'd be looking for a guy who projects as a number 2 starter with issues (he'd need some development) or a solid number 3."
CHICubs,3cmd1v,inevitablescape,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:21:29 2015 UTC,I would trade Baez for Niese or another back of the rotation guys straight up. I don't know where Baez would fit on our team. I feel like he needs to play every day but our infield is crowded atm
CHICubs,3cmd1v,voidecho,2,Thu Jul 9 01:48:35 2015 UTC,He'll fit great when Bryant moves to LF.
CHICubs,3cmd1v,JohnnyWaffleseed,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:36:19 2015 UTC,"Niese is worth not much more than his contract and the Mets aren't interested in dealing Harvey, Thor, DeGrom or Matz. They need to find some offense but I don't think they'll move any of those 4 young SP."
CHICubs,3cmd1v,THEriot2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:16:18 2015 UTC,I don't know where Baez would fit on our team.    No reason to undersell him.
CHICubs,3cmd1v,friendly-confines,-2,Thu Jul 9 16:02:24 2015 UTC,I've come to the conclusion that Castro needs to be traded.    He's not a mental midget by any stretch but I think getting him out of Chicago and the media spotlight here would do his career wonders.
CHICubs,3cmd1v,dickcomments,3,Thu Jul 9 04:05:49 2015 UTC,"Traded to NY or just traded, cause the media is 1000 times worse there."
CHICubs,3cmd1v,friendly-confines,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:14:12 2015 UTC,Just traded. Even to new York he has a bit of a grace period and fewer expectations than.here
CHICubs,3cmd1v,RustyDarkstar76,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:26:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think so.  I think he's on the right team now.  It's just an off year for him.  Right team, he doesn't have to lead Rizzo now the guy Bryant will be up there soon. I'd like to see him move to second is all."
CHICubs,3cmd1v,Big_Gringo,-2,Thu Jul 9 18:43:59 2015 UTC,"Baez isn't going anywhere, if he wasn't hurt he'd be playing 2B right now and Russell would be in AAA.  Next year it'll be 3B Castro SS Russell 2B Baez pushing Bryant out to LF"
CHICubs,3cmd1v,Cohaagan,3,Thu Jul 9 16:43:47 2015 UTC,"I truly doubt a big trade will happen between us, we only really need another starter and maybe some outfield improvement. Our outfield can be fixed by some of our farm guys (or Bryant or Baez moving out there when Baez gets called up). The only guys I would want are Harvey, Syndergard (spelling?), or deGrom and I think they would cost more than I personally would be willing to give up. I am a homer though so maybe our front office is willing to give up something substantial but I think we can just get a pitcher in free agency and be happy about it.  To clarify, our outfield consists for the most part of Soler, Fowler, and Coghlan/Baxter/Denorfia. Fowler is reasonable on offense and great in Center but we need someone more reliable at the plate. The Coghlan/Baxter/Denorfia trio are all great 4th options as well but I don't like any of them as starters. So that leaves us with Soler who has the potential to be a fantastic RF and thus far he has been, but we can improve in left and center. I just don't think a Mets trade is the answer here."
CHICubs,3cmd1v,cgoods94,6,Thu Jul 9 04:46:27 2015 UTC,"No offense, but if the Mets offered Niese for Addi, I'd hang up the phone."
CHICubs,3cmd1v,AcrossFromWhere,8,Thu Jul 9 01:48:30 2015 UTC,I think that's what he meant. That he has been unable to find rational discussion thus far and is seeking it here.
CHICubs,3cmd1v,HerbieVerstinks,4,Thu Jul 9 03:41:17 2015 UTC,"I know Jon Niese has strung together a set of nice starts recently, but his stuff has regressed this year. I'm not interested. Dillon Gee has even less value to me. Since I doubt deGrom and Harvey are going anywhere, the only starter the Mets have that interests me is Noah Syndergaard.  If I'm the Mets, I hang onto every one of my starters. Arms are so volatile these days, you really can't afford to not have depth (apologies for the double negative). Take a look at their rotation. Matt Harvey missed last year. Zack Wheeler's out this year. It can happen at any time to anybody. I feel like I would need at least two good pitchers for one of our hitters, just to have that security. But I doubt that's something the Mets would go for.  As far as the Cubs' system goes, for me, the only untouchable is Kyle Schwarber. And even him I would move if it landed us an elite starter (I'm looking at you, Chris Sale). I would not trade any of the 25-and-unders on the big league roster, including Castro."
CHICubs,3cmd1v,gfcolli,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:01:32 2015 UTC,"The players I see being possibly traded are Castro, Strop, and Vogelbach.  That's not mentioning guys like Jackson who would be difficult to get rid of.  In the off season I can see Montero being traded if Schwarber's development is far enough along.    Giving up anyone along the potential of Baez or Schwarber would take someone special with long term team control.  Noah Syndergaard could be that kind of player."
CHICubs,3cmd1v,Big_Gringo,3,Thu Jul 9 04:44:55 2015 UTC,Schwarber is pretty much untouchable
CHICubs,3cmd1v,Big_Gringo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:45:29 2015 UTC,"A trade between these two teams looks better on paper than it is practically, especially with our FO's philosophy on bats over pitching.  No deal is getting done."
CHICubs,3cmd1v,LonghornPride05,-11,Thu Jul 9 16:46:21 2015 UTC,For the 100th time the Cubs are not and do not have serious interest in unproven pitchers. We are not trading youth hitting for youth pitching it goes against everything this organization has done. Go away Mets fans with these posts every month.... its annoying as fuck.

They even have a ""call up"" feature on Gleyber Torres.  It took me a while to get over the excitement."
CHICubs,3ck6wn,Bucket2222,6,Wed Jul 8 16:27:29 2015 UTC,Dammit. I got super hyped for nothing.

CHICubs,3ck6wn,THEriot2,3,Wed Jul 8 16:03:52 2015 UTC,"This is not for the current season.  Here's Fangraph's playoffs odds, which puts the Cubs at 8.5% on the division and 66.1% on the WC (so 74.6% playoff odds) with 88.1 expected wins (a .533 WPCT the rest of the way)."
CHICubs,3ck6wn,THEriot2,2,Wed Jul 8 17:12:41 2015 UTC,"OK, something's messed up. Because with the remaining games and their .559 winning percentage the rest of the way, that's only 44 more wins.

CHICubs,3ci76e,jp611,5,Wed Jul 8 04:07:34 2015 UTC,I was so happy to be at that game when I was younger. Just a bizarre and exciting game from top to bottom right in the middle of a playoff race

When he tripped around third I distinctly remember my dad yelling ""oh no!"".   My other vivid memory of that night (other than booing Hernandez during the stretch) was on the bus back to where we parked. A guy my dad was talking to. He said ""if we end up going all the way this year, everyone is going to claim they were at this game.""   That may have been dramatic but it really made me feel special. Such an awesome night :')"

Now, I know calling baseball games is a lot harder than it looks.  But my god, did I hate me some Chip Caray back in those days.  Every ball was ""fisted"" and he refused to promote ""The Best Damn Sports Show"" because it had the word ""damn"" in it and he didn't want his son (who he named Tristian, by the way) to hear him curse.    I just watched it again.  I don't believe there's an audio lag.  Chip calls Gutierrez out a full second after Angel Hernandez calls him safe."

CHICubs,3ciaoj,Sparx7,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:21:30 2015 UTC,That was my favourite game of the year so far.   Duck on the field Herrera twice wearing the wrong helmet Cards pitcher ejection Metheny not knowing his pitcher got ejected right away Russell's hit goes from foul to fair The Beeler/Fowler swap at second base (it was kinda neat) Beating the Cardinals twice in one day   This game checked a lot of boxes.

CHICubs,3ch571,skoalbrother,32,Tue Jul 7 21:38:14 2015 UTC,Totally agree with Kasper on this. To me the jinxing thing only really applies to players talking about it in the dugout. People complaining to Len on Twitter are just wilfully ignorant fans who are looking for someone to blame.

CHICubs,3ch571,zrk23,8,Wed Jul 8 06:45:06 2015 UTC,Every announcer that has ever called a no hitter or perfect  game has talked about it. Superstitions  are dumb. Only people that shouldn't talk about it are the people in the dug out so to not break the pitchers train of thought.
CHICubs,3ch571,moops_,4,Wed Jul 8 04:59:07 2015 UTC,Its impossible for me to agree with Len more
CHICubs,3ch571,MileyCyrus8,2,Wed Jul 8 04:39:28 2015 UTC,Pat says shutout all the time. It's not s big deal.
CHICubs,3ch571,Patrick_Kane,0,Wed Jul 8 01:29:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think most fans would blame Kasper for ""jinxing"" Lester's no-no; but I do sympathize with everyone saying they wish he wouldn't use the phrase ""no-hitter.""  Baseball is a game of tradition, for good or ill - and announcers should respect that.  Saying ""Lester hasn't allowed a hit through 6"" would be perfectly appropriate."
CHICubs,3ch571,snorkel-freckle,10,Tue Jul 7 23:13:44 2015 UTC,"Or the announcer should do their job and inform people of the situation in the game. Baseball being a game of ""tradition"" is such a cop out especially considering the team your watching is advancing past those traditions at every level of the organization."
CHICubs,3ch571,THEriot2,0,Wed Jul 8 00:38:27 2015 UTC,"There are multiple ways Len can do his job (which I think he does quite well most of the time, by the way) without using the phrase ""no-hitter).  The fact that we're even discussing this proves that tradition is still very important to baseball fans.    The cop out would be fans actually blaming the loss of the no-hitter on Len.  That would obviously be insane."
CHICubs,3ch571,snorkel-freckle,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:05:29 2015 UTC,"Consciously, I get that it's a silly superstition that has no actual effect on anything in the game, but I still don't like him blithely throwing it out there all the time whenever one of our guys is tossing a no-hitter.   Edit: I do understand his point, though. On the other hand, I get nervous when a guy carries a no-hitter into the second, so not realizing it in the later innings is a bit of a strange concept to me."
CHICubs,3ch571,hawksfan81,-9,Tue Jul 7 22:13:37 2015 UTC,"I know it doesn't matter, and there's no such thing as jinxing the team... but I must admit, it's annoying as hell that he does say it.  Just leave it alone, Len."

CHICubs,3cfylx,ViaChicago3441,4,Tue Jul 7 18:05:35 2015 UTC,"3.1*Team games played.  The Astros and Phillies have played 85, so Correa/Franco need 264 to qualify. Correa only has 117, Franco's closer with 211."
CHICubs,3cfylx,THEriot2,3,Tue Jul 7 18:13:54 2015 UTC,Got it. So many exciting young guys in the game right now.

CHICubs,3cfylx,THEriot2,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:55:09 2015 UTC,"No, just saying what MLB defines as 'qualifying'. Franco could win RoY if he plays the full rest of season, even if he technically comes up short of qualifying for league leaders lists. Correa has a tougher hill to climb."
CHICubs,3cfylx,trapper2530,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:59:55 2015 UTC,The crazy thing about Correra is he's already 2nd in fWAR among AL rookies. And only 0.1 behind Devon Travis who only has 65 more PA after coming out of the gate red hot before going down with an injury.
CHICubs,3cfylx,retrofade,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:27:14 2015 UTC,He also trails Trevor May and Lance McCullers. Gotta look at pitching too. :)
CHICubs,3cfylx,THEriot2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:36:15 2015 UTC,".....shhhhhhh  I should have remembered McCullers. Big fan. He only came up a couple weeks before Correra, too. Thought May would have accumulated enough innings/time last season, but he was just short."
CHICubs,3cfylx,Sparx7,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:48:03 2015 UTC,Is that AB or PA. I feel like PA should be used bc BB is a key stat.

CHICubs,3cff6f,Sparx7,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:32:57 2015 UTC,Forgive my ignorance but is it a bad idea because he warmed up and cooled down and would be warming back up again or because of worries that his pitch count would get too high?

CHICubs,3cff6f,LtDarien,2,Tue Jul 7 20:30:23 2015 UTC,"It's still not.   Rule 10.20 in the Official Rule Book states: Credit a pitcher with a save when he meets all three of the following conditions:  (1) He is the finishing pitcher in a game won by his club; and  (2) He is not the winning pitcher; and  (3) He qualifies under one of the following conditions:  - (a) He enters the game with a lead of no more than three runs and pitches for at least one inning; or  - (b) He enters the game, regardless of the count, with the potential tying run either on base, or at bat, or on deck (that is, the potential tying run is either already on base or is one of the first two batsmen he faces; or  - (c) He pitches effectively for at least three innings.

CHICubs,3cff6f,djb2287,2,Tue Jul 7 20:32:01 2015 UTC,It's not.  You have to pitch a full inning to get a save up by 3 runs or pitch with the tying run on deck

The craziness of that game will always be etched into my head.  I think I was a good luck charm in 08. I was also at a game against the Brewers where they were trailing 3-0 with 2 outs in the 9th and no one on...they rallied to win 4-3

Not to mention Coughlan has been swinging that bat pretty good for us, and Soler isn't equipped to play CF. It would be a nice luxury to have his bat right now, but it not at the cost of destroying our development for the future.   Remember, it's awesome that we are competing right now and looking the playoff contenders. But in the next few years we are going to be WORLD SERIES FAVORITES! This isn't a one year window, we aren't running out of time, the door is just opening! Let Theo do his thing, like he's done so far to get us here.

CHICubs,3cj63j,ilovelamp42,-2,Wed Jul 8 09:51:50 2015 UTC,"He's having a better year in the minors than Bryant had last year. Bryant is an All-Star already and will be great for years to come.   Schwarber hit better in the majors than he has in AAA, and better in AAA than he did in AA. There aren't too many guys whose Batting average and OPS increase as they progress through the ranks. George Brett did it. Piazza did it. Mostly it's HOFers.  Obviously it's a small sample size, but Schwarber has the highest adjusted OPS on the Cubs this season. Higher than Rizzo.  I don't think that is an anomaly because it's the same performance he's shown at every level, regardless of competition strength."
CHICubs,3cj63j,thepalmtree,3,Wed Jul 8 10:00:11 2015 UTC,"He played in what, 6 games? You can't judge his major league performance of off such a small sample. So much of his upside is if he can hit like he is from the catcher position. Stick him in left, and he's probably the worst outfielder defensively in the league. Let him develop and continue to prove himself."

Obviously it's a small sample size,   Yes, very small, and you're placing way too much faith in MiLB stats, and trying to give us possibly the worst defense in the league.  Edit: I thought you were talking about his season sample or AAA sample. Don't even try to draw anything meaningful from 23 MLB PA. Yes, the guy can and will rake, but Jesus. You're comparing him to HOFers with 53 and 23 AAA and MLB PA."
CHICubs,3cj63j,THEriot2,3,Wed Jul 8 14:02:21 2015 UTC,"...but the guy would probably be the Cubs' best hitter if he were on the ML roster-and that includes Rizzo and Bryant, who are having All-Star seasons.   Stopped reading.  Okay, I didn't.   in a depressed offensive environment.   The PCL...depressed offensive environment? Okay.   Schwarber can learn how to play catcher in the offseason.    a) He's not that close defensively, and b) that not even close to being the same.   Get this guy in left field NOW and move Soler to center and Coghlan to right.   That would be a nightmare defensively even compared to our poor OF defense now. Not something the FO is interested in. It would make the Padres' OF defense look like the Pirates'.   The Cubs are crazy to keep a player like that in the minors.   After 5 years of the rebuild going exactly to plan and better, you'd think we'd understand the FO knows what they're doing in terms of player development. Let's not get rash after 5 years of impatience."
CHICubs,3cj63j,THEriot2,0,Wed Jul 8 13:51:02 2015 UTC,"You realize that the 90s-00s Braves won 14 straight division titles but only one World Series. The one that got away from them, the one that I'm sure they'd use the mulligan on if they could, was the first one in 1991. They got shut out in game 7 of the World Series. If they would have made one more trade or called up, say, Vinny Castilla earlier that year so he would've been eligible for the post-season, maybe they would have scored a run in that game. The way things are now with that one game wild card playoff, once the playoffs start it's a complete crap shoot.  The Cubs themselves decided to draft bats. Sure, the scenario I proposed would lead to a worse outfield defense, but I believe Schwarber's bat would outweigh the disadvantage. I'm not saying bench Fowler outright. Soler hasn't exactly proved that he's an everyday player yet this season. Play them all, keep them fresh for the stretch run. Hell, use Schwarber exclusively as a pinch hitter every single game. Just take advantage of his bat."
CHICubs,3cj63j,THEriot2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:32:12 2015 UTC,"You realize that the 90s-00s Braves won 14 straight division titles but only one World Series.   Yeah, the playoffs are largely a crapshoot. Boggs, old Braves teams...geez. Let's not act like the game hasn't changed. I'm sure Vinny Castilla and his 24 plate appearances in 1991-1992 (that he did nothing during) would have made a huge difference over 6.1 WAR Terry Pendleton.    maybe they would have scored a run in that game.   They probably score a run in that game 95 times out of 100 with the exact same roster. This point holds no water. You can't just point to a single game like this and act like it holds any damn water in a completely different scenario.    The way things are now with that one game wild card playoff, once the playoffs start it's a complete crap shoot.   Right...you're making my point for me.   the scenario I proposed would lead to a worse outfield defense, but I believe Schwarber's bat would outweigh the disadvantage.   I'm sure he would accumulate a lot of value getting one PA a game."
CHICubs,3cj63j,NLRD,0,Wed Jul 8 18:22:55 2015 UTC,"Building a team for 162 game season gets you into the playoffs. That's it. The most successful regular season teams of all-time record-wise tend not to win playoff series and championships. This is nothing new-see: 1906 Cubs- but is exacerbated by the stupid wild card playoff format that actually penalizes deep rosters. Schwarber is the best bat on the organization, period. To hold him out to develop a catching tool that may never materialize while in the playoff hunt  is, I believe, folly."

To hold him out to develop a catching tool that may never materialize while in the playoff hunt is, I believe, folly.   To have him up just to have it up, to hit once a game, or create a laughably bad defense, is asinine.

CHICubs,3cds6j,Solleret,21,Tue Jul 7 03:10:07 2015 UTC,I feel ya.  It sucks sifting through all of the horseshit that's being posted lately.  I just try and stick with it and downvote the assholes.  If the moderate fans continue to leave the threads we're left with just the negativity and anger.  Be the change you want to see and hopefully we can encourage people to take a more tempered approach.
CHICubs,3cds6j,TooLebowski,5,Tue Jul 7 04:15:46 2015 UTC,Welcome to Chicago sports.  Its WS or 1st pick in the draft.  The sad part is this team is still on a ridiculous tear and young.  If you expected this team to come out of the gates hot and win the  division this year you were expecting for a lot of bad to fall on the pirates and cardinals.  I expect a team a little above .500 and to fight for a wild card spot.  While I want the world series you have to put into perspective the leaps and bounds this team has really taken while played 3 of the 5 youngest players in baseball everyday.  (sans Soler for a stretch).  We're winning a lot of games and haven't come close to hitting out potential....thats fucking scary.
CHICubs,3cds6j,Sparx7,9,Tue Jul 7 13:35:22 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't care about the emotional rollercoaster that is GDTs. People can vent all they want, that's why the threads exist. GDTs keep that contained in a single thread and allow people to just have some fun yelling about everything during the game. Personally I'm usually sarcastic the entire time, even when I'm being negative.  Your complains are semi-valid, but only if they extend beyond GDTs. Which so far they haven't. For the most part people are positive and excited to be cheering for a decent team again. Quick, snap reactions to bad plays and occasional horrifying moments are okay in my book."
CHICubs,3cds6j,BoringCode,3,Tue Jul 7 14:42:46 2015 UTC,thats it. game thread. is for the game in question. im not gonna be thinking and talking about the future and how will Russell be better ofensively on a game thread
CHICubs,3cds6j,zrk23,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:36:05 2015 UTC,"No no no, don't complain.  You're downing the buzz of the guy trying to block out how bad we are at a given moment with the mental imagery of how good we may be in the future."
CHICubs,3cds6j,jimrob4,11,Tue Jul 7 19:50:44 2015 UTC,"I'm with ya for the most part (though I will still participate in the GDTs). Guys, we are a decent team for the first time in almost a decade. I'm just here to enjoy our young talent, unexpectedly good pitching, and late game bucket heroics. Before the season started I thought at best we would be a wild card team, but more realistically on that bubble of teams looking in, and that's about where we're at.  Before you get critical just remind yourself of how incredibly shitty we have been in recent years. This is a massive step forward from that. Patience, my friends, patience. We are Cubs fans after all, ""there's always next year"" has never sounded better to me."
CHICubs,3cds6j,Cohaagan,12,Tue Jul 7 04:15:57 2015 UTC,I honestly believe people here have either never played or never watched baseball. Everyone is so fair weather and reactionary I can't think of any other explanation.
CHICubs,3cds6j,IDCimSTRONGERtnUinRL,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:52:26 2015 UTC,"so do u think the ""weather"" for our offense after almost half season is good?"
CHICubs,3cds6j,zrk23,4,Tue Jul 7 15:37:32 2015 UTC,"No but this team is a lot of rookies, this year was expected to be a growing pain year. But because we started off so hot everyone's expectations got out of control."
CHICubs,3cds6j,IDCimSTRONGERtnUinRL,-1,Tue Jul 7 16:10:53 2015 UTC,"no, its because the team is good. the only  rookies on lineup are Russell, Bryant and Soler who spent a month out and we still went above .500. we all know how good Bryant is, hes an all star after all. and Russell will be a future GG. this team is not young. we have 3 rookies and thats it."
CHICubs,3cds6j,zrk23,2,Tue Jul 7 18:12:58 2015 UTC,So HURR DURR just give us the trophy now! Get real

CHICubs,3cds6j,zrk23,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:15:53 2015 UTC,What? Who said anything about a slump. I'm talking about being young and rookies. That have 3/8 starters as rookies and 2 other starters 25 or under.
CHICubs,3cds6j,trapper2530,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:16:56 2015 UTC,"the point the people say about this team being ""young"" is that there will be ups and downs and slumps and stuff like that"
CHICubs,3cds6j,zrk23,3,Wed Jul 8 23:08:44 2015 UTC,"Over the top negativity is one thing, but there are some perfectly legitimate complaints about this team. Mike Baxter isn't a walking abortion, but he probably shouldn't be on the roster of a contending team. We have a lineup that could easily be one of the best in baseball, and we've been struggling to scrape together any offense at all recently. I'm still ecstatic with how the team is doing this year and how good the future looks for them, but you can be happy with the team and still have very valid complaints."
CHICubs,3cds6j,jakejohnnolan,3,Tue Jul 7 14:08:43 2015 UTC,"contending team   That's the thing. They're not contending nor were expected to contend this year. Just because they're exceeding the front office's and our expectations sooner than previously thought, and because Rizzo said they were going to win the division this year, doesn't mean we're contending.  No one I talked to (fans, friends, family) before the season even expected the Cubs to end with .500 record - maybe within a game or two of even, but not above - much less be up 7 some odd games at the All Star Break with the possibility of eking out a wild card spot.  Because of a hot start people got excited and reverted back to dumb meatball form where everything is the greatest or worst thing to happen to the team."
CHICubs,3cds6j,growingupsux,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:59:33 2015 UTC,"You're just wrong. They're not going to win the division, but if the season ended today, they'd be in the playoffs. That's a contending team. And preseason projections had the Cubs as an 82-84 win team and a likely 3rd place finisher in the NL central. They're not outperforming their expectations nearly as much as you seem to think. The only thing you're right about is that people are overreacting to every little thing."
CHICubs,3cds6j,jakejohnnolan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:20:29 2015 UTC,"but if the season ended today, they'd be in the playoffs   Yes...but it's only the beginning of July with 80 some odd games left. Things happen.  I guess contending means a different thing to me. It means doing what they can to win now."
CHICubs,3cds6j,growingupsux,2,Tue Jul 7 20:43:32 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I'm not saying people shouldn't complain, just that it seems like the venting is borderline psychotic. Baxter yesterday was a bad example for me to choose, but this negativity is endemic and hits almost every player in every thread.   I'm just not here for a group therapy session in pessimism, which is how it seems on some days. There is a difference between complaining and an avalanche of negativity."
CHICubs,3cds6j,PaletoBayPlayboy,-1,Tue Jul 7 15:05:34 2015 UTC,Psychotic? It would be if we went to their homes and yelled at their faces. This is simply folks venting in an online forum that was created for that purpose. Pull your panties out of a bunch. It isn't that big of a deal.
CHICubs,3cds6j,Thetiredduck,7,Tue Jul 7 20:54:21 2015 UTC,"What I really hate is when we play the cards, everyone starts complaining that the cards are super lucky. They might be a bit lucky but they are also REALLY good. It hurts losing to them but its annoying seeing excuses thrown around for why we can't beat them. It just makes us seem like sore losers and whiny. The real reason they win, is because they are better. That's pretty much it. Again, fuck the cards, but when the team you're playing has the best record in the league, maybe its not luck that helps them win."
CHICubs,3cds6j,THEriot2,3,Tue Jul 7 07:20:39 2015 UTC,"I agree wholeheartedly. I'm guilty at times as well, though no where near the level and consistency as some. It's driven me from GDTs. The funny part is, I think the worst offenders are those who don't really contribute to any meaningful discussion in the sub.   Oh well, I'll keep on enjoying the sub. The great thing about the internet is that you can ignore the stupid parts.  Edit: Another observation is that this is what comes with the team playing well and being more popular. You'll see the same sort of thing at the ballpark, too."

I get it, we all vent, but its beyond venting. Blame the internet + meatball fans."
CHICubs,3cds6j,AndrewHanus,2,Tue Jul 7 16:38:08 2015 UTC,It's been over a month since I've visited a GDT due to negativity and my listening/viewing experience has been greatly improved.

CHICubs,3cds6j,AndrewHanus,2,Tue Jul 7 22:25:59 2015 UTC,So I'm with you 100% @solleret.
CHICubs,3cds6j,zdruck07,5,Tue Jul 7 22:27:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, people are being far too negative (myself included), but to just accept a loss from a better team is ludicrous.  Yes, the cardinals are the most skilled team in baseball.  No, that doesn't mean we should accept loss after loss from them.  I completely agree that the negativity is getting ridiculous, but we can't just accept that the team is showing their inexperience and scoring has all but completely petered out.  We're done with the years of accepting a bad team (which we aren't any more).  We appreciate success, but we need to start expecting it.  The offensive struggles will pass.  But until they do, the team needs to know that they need to change what they're doing to be more successful in the long run."
CHICubs,3cds6j,zdruck07,13,Tue Jul 7 03:32:38 2015 UTC,"Im not talking about accepting losses, I am talking about the hyperbolic negativity. Its a shit show in these gdt's, no one is contributing anything but complaints and outright malice.  There is a difference between speaking truth and constantly screaming about it."
CHICubs,3cds6j,HotBurritoBeans,10,Tue Jul 7 03:35:55 2015 UTC,"Right.  In that case, I absolutely agree.  I definitely do it too, so I'm gonna start working on it."

CHICubs,3cds6j,TheBostonPops,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:42:57 2015 UTC,"It seems like refs and umps this year have been pretty shitty. It's like NBA, NHL, and MLB had a meeting and said, ""let's call shitty plays.""  I don't pay attention to the NFL, so if they had a bad year with the refs then I think it's a conspiracy."
CHICubs,3cds6j,HelloNeumann29,4,Tue Jul 7 12:31:29 2015 UTC,"I only really hang out in GDTs for day games because the volume is much lower so you can actually talk to people. I love our team and am proud of our guys, and we got a long way to go still, with a lot of baseball left to play. We waited years to be competitive, patiently watching shitty games with a team that said they quit in the 7th if they were behind. We're finally getting there, so let's not turn into shitty fans decrying our growing, over performing team because we lost to those cheating fucking assholes from St. Louis.  And, if you're gonna say something mean in a GDT, at least step it up and use a gif. Finding the appropriate gif might cool you off too."
CHICubs,3cds6j,Toastman04,3,Tue Jul 7 05:49:49 2015 UTC,"I gave up pretty quickly on the GDT's and reading a lot of comments in this sub. There is an obnoxious amount of negativity, as well as puely unintelligent baseball speak going on. I'm hoping that this is a result of a lot of fans coming back to support their team after the years of losing around here - I hope the bandwagon is filling back up, but the riders need to get some fresh perspective on the game, the team, and our situation in the long run. 2015 was the year that we were supposed to start looking better, and probably by the end of the season more so than the beginning. People are treating it as though its win or die this year, and its just not the case. We're on track to win 88 games right now. A slightly better second half record, and we're at 90 - and this is preciesely why I don't get the negativity. Its not about 2015. Its about 2016, 17, 18, 19, 20, and beyond."
CHICubs,3cds6j,TugboatThomas,2,Tue Jul 7 12:52:32 2015 UTC,"I see no problem with negativity, but thats just me.  This is a place to discuss the cubs and to also vent.  If it helps someone cope with a loss by venting here, all the power to him."
CHICubs,3cds6j,BoringCode,2,Tue Jul 7 13:07:40 2015 UTC,"Complaining about umps; upvotes.  Continuously complaining about announcers every time there is a national broadcast even though you could just mute your TV (which is actually hilarious because its usually basically anger about them liking the other team more than ours, or saying things that aren't all pro-cubs the entire time. When they talk about how great Bryant is, no one is talking about how terrible they are. Sounds familiar.); upvotes.  Frustration about lack of hitting, voted into the negatives and the creation of an overly dramatic meta-thread.   Good grief, who would have thought your fandom couldn't handle someone else venting their frustration the same way they would vent their happiness if we were winning.   No one is going around making post after post about how terrible the Cubs are, we are reacting to a play on the field or the way we played in a single game.    We get into it but we're not going into full blown fucking hysteria after every strikeout or loss.   You're only going to make  meta-posts, or down vote people into the negatives about other people getting frustrated over a missed opportunity or loss. Check.    No More GDT's for me.   What a totally reasonable, positive, and measured response to your frustration. I hope you, and everyone else who downvotes into the negatives posts like ""Starting the series with a loss, how great. Ugh"" stays out of the GDT's from now on.   You may think you're somehow better because you're super negative about part of the community instead of being negative about a play or a game, but you're not.  You're taking someone else getting frustrated over a play or a game as a much larger criticism of this team that they actually intend."
CHICubs,3cds6j,zrk23,3,Tue Jul 7 12:50:44 2015 UTC,"When they talk about how great Bryant is, no one is talking about how terrible they are   I personally like to make fun of the constant narrative building (Lester can't throw to first base, Bryant is literally the only Cubs player, Maddon loves the pitcher in the 8 spot, etc...)"

CHICubs,3cds6j,YourCummyBear,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:55:53 2015 UTC,"There is no rampant negativity. When people are ranting in the GDT against a single negative comment, downvoting anyone that posts anything besides ""aw shucks guys, I really wish we would get a hit but golly these kids are gonna be SO good in 3 years I just know it"" , and then multiple threads over the past month about ""can't we all just only be positive"" , it starts to be a bit much. That is the problem here, not a few posts that are irritated at a bad performance.   We played our rival, every year those games are a toss up regardless of who is on those teams. It's ok if people are frustrated about blowing an opportunity. Cubs/Cards games are really heated in places where the fandom is split, so it can be frustrating.   Even still, no one is trolling the threads posting Debbie downer posts every time they speak. We still have hope just because we're not shooting Cubs rainbows from our eyes like some people on this sub would like."

There are worse travesties than 0 WAR players. Also, Maddon probably saw something in that matchup and rolled the dice; that's what Maddon does and he looks much deeper into matchups and strategy than WAR. We should try to appreciate that about our manager, because that's exactly the kind of stuff he excels at."
CHICubs,3cds6j,ViaChicago3441,4,Tue Jul 7 05:24:30 2015 UTC,Sports are a passionate thing and everyone treats their fandom differently. I know plenty of people who yelp and act like the worlds ending every loss. What's makes the way you accept losing the right way?

We're a message board, not your living room — asking this community to step back and chill isn't me trying to censor you, it's me trying to speak my mind and hopefully make others think about it too."

CHICubs,3cds6j,achap39,2,Tue Jul 7 14:16:57 2015 UTC,"This....the GDT is like hanging out at a bar with a bunch of Cubs fans.  There are all types of personalities and people are going to react to bad plays within a game.  Just because they react to one play negatively doesn't mean they think the sky is falling on the entire season.  Since the comments are written on a board rather than said out loud at a bar I think they come off way more serious than most of them are intended.  As ChicagoW says below/above, a lot of them are actually funny if people just realize they're not entirely serious."
CHICubs,3cds6j,zrk23,-2,Tue Jul 7 13:17:41 2015 UTC,"This isn't a bar, though, its a message board.

Notice you posted this right after a loss to the Cardinals, not right after the three game sweep of the Mets.  The emotions are up and down.  More up than down this year.  There are definitely a few people (I can think of maybe three regulars) who are typically very pessimistic, even when things are going good, but I don't think they're the majority."

CHICubs,3cds6j,jimrob4,0,Tue Jul 7 17:33:55 2015 UTC,I feel like there is definitely a whiner in here...
CHICubs,3cds6j,PaletoBayPlayboy,0,Tue Jul 7 20:56:38 2015 UTC,"We're turning into the 'new' Hawks. Unfortunately.   In the same way people lose their minds about losing to Columbus on December 18th, people here fly off the handle about Game 75 of 162.   The people who want to crucify Crawford for one bad game are the same types who say Lester's a bust after a half-season with no run support.   People who couldn't be bothered when the team was shit are now treating every game, every AB into a life-or-death situation. The ones who are the most negative and expect the most from this young team are, IMO, the ones who have hopped on the bandwagon, and think that's how you should act unless the team goes 162-0."

CHICubs,3ce4js,Sparx7,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:23:03 2015 UTC,Edwards pitched well in AAA as well! Those will hopefully be 2 great bullpen arms late in the season
CHICubs,3ce4js,dpete10,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:56:05 2015 UTC,he had a rough start too didn't he?
CHICubs,3ce4js,Sparx7,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:01:53 2015 UTC,I'm not sure. I haven't been paying attention to the minor league stats until recently
CHICubs,3ce4js,dpete10,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:06:45 2015 UTC,I seem to  remember him not being sharp in his first couple  outings out of the BP but I could very easily be wrong
CHICubs,3ce4js,Sparx7,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:10:23 2015 UTC,That very well could be. Let's hope he continues with 2 inning hitless outings!
CHICubs,3ce4js,dpete10,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:14:19 2015 UTC,He has been up and down in his bullpen appearances.
CHICubs,3ce4js,airham,0,Tue Jul 7 16:54:52 2015 UTC,I think it might be time for Wada to go home.
CHICubs,3cfu1c,Bob2456,2,Tue Jul 7 16:11:32 2015 UTC,"Only if we can get him for next to nothing.  He has an ERA over 4 away from home, so don't be fooled.  He is a decent back end starter at this point, but nothing more."
CHICubs,3cfu1c,NLRD,3,Tue Jul 7 17:46:42 2015 UTC,"Sticking by my preference to withhold on a trade of our farm system for starting pitching and instead wait until next offseason to sign someone.  That said, if we can steal him, worth a shot."
CHICubs,3cfu1c,KCchemist,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:25:02 2015 UTC,As others have said in previous threads I hope they go after a pitcher only if they get one for a great price. I don't want to give up someone that could contribute big time in years to come for a rental when there are numerous starters that will be free agents next year. We need a bat before anything. Wada/richard/whoever can get us to the playoffs as a 5th starter and then we'll only need 4.
CHICubs,3cfu1c,dpete10,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:27:24 2015 UTC,"Are we going to have to give up a major piece for Haren? He's 34 and on the marlins. I guess it depends on the market for him, but I don't think we would be giving up a valuable piece."
CHICubs,3cfu1c,dpete10,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:31:11 2015 UTC,That's true. And like I said if we can get someone for a great price I'm all for it. I would personally rather get a good bat for the lineup before a pitcher. But I'm not the gm and I trust Theo so any moves he makes I will be happy with
CHICubs,3cfu1c,inevitablescape,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:37:28 2015 UTC,We just got Clayton Richard the other day so if I don't know if they are going to trade for another arm.

CHICubs,3ccicz,an_abyss_in_motion,4,Tue Jul 7 04:05:21 2015 UTC,I hope we don't score at all this inning because if we somehow score 2 runs idk what will happen but I cannot garuntee anyone's safety

CHICubs,3ccicz,genbar,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:00:44 2015 UTC,"So Edwin Jackson has to be cut when Soriano is ready to go, right? We wasted money, let's not compound the mistake by wasting a roster spot."

CHICubs,3ccicz,75MillionForks,4,Tue Jul 7 03:53:54 2015 UTC,"So much negativity, it's not over til it's over boys!"
CHICubs,3ccicz,SoberFuck,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:48:19 2015 UTC,"Listen, positivity requires a team to inspire you. They're not doing that."
CHICubs,3ccicz,totheloop,4,Tue Jul 7 03:48:09 2015 UTC,"To be fair, this is two weeks of built up frustration. People are going to be negative. We're not abandoning the season, but we can vent a little on a GDT."
CHICubs,3ccicz,SoonerJDB,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:54:28 2015 UTC,We just went 5-1 in our last 6 games?
CHICubs,3ccicz,Oprah-Is-My-Dad,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:50:50 2015 UTC,But besides Bryant's 2 homers the offense had been extremely frustrating to watch.
CHICubs,3ccicz,SoberFuck,2,Tue Jul 7 03:53:13 2015 UTC,"Sandwiched between losses to the Cardinals.  It's a ""lol stupid cubs no matter how good you are well always be better"" frustration"
CHICubs,3ccicz,Gewehr98,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:55:13 2015 UTC,Fair.  I felt it too as soon as Castro hit into that dbl play.
CHICubs,3ccicz,SoberFuck,2,Tue Jul 7 03:55:06 2015 UTC,"Which is good, but winning isn't sustainable if this offense keeps struggling like this."
CHICubs,3ccicz,jp611,2,Tue Jul 7 03:56:25 2015 UTC,Exactly. I'll take the W but this team is in a serious slump.
CHICubs,3ccicz,SoonerJDB,3,Tue Jul 7 03:54:29 2015 UTC,Can we let Marlins Man play?
CHICubs,3ccicz,mmm_tacos,2,Tue Jul 7 03:57:17 2015 UTC,"Okay, to be honest though, I'm tired of Marlins guy. Go away, Marlins guy. Nobody cares, Marlins guy. Seriously. Nobody cares."
CHICubs,3ccicz,GoCubs2015,-4,Tue Jul 7 03:48:05 2015 UTC,Look at all the disgusting cardinal fans. Puke.

CHICubs,3ccicz,cubswinagain,-1,Tue Jul 7 03:46:33 2015 UTC,Although we do have the All Stars coming up in the bottom of the 9th.  It's not over quite yet.
CHICubs,3ccicz,jp611,5,Tue Jul 7 03:44:10 2015 UTC,"No, Rizzo just made a brief plate appearance in the 8th"
CHICubs,3ccicz,BobC813,2,Tue Jul 7 03:43:24 2015 UTC,Apparently I was halfway asleep lol
CHICubs,3ccicz,jp611,3,Tue Jul 7 03:45:38 2015 UTC,One all star just popped out on the first pitch he saw in the bottom of the 8th
CHICubs,3ccicz,ViaChicago3441,-5,Tue Jul 7 03:49:47 2015 UTC,Over/under on runs scored by our offense for the rest of this series: 1.5
CHICubs,3ccicz,cubswinagain,3,Tue Jul 7 03:45:36 2015 UTC,Over by half a run
CHICubs,3ccicz,totheloop,-2,Tue Jul 7 03:42:54 2015 UTC,This man's a dreamer.

CHICubs,3ccicz,jp611,3,Tue Jul 7 03:43:29 2015 UTC,Rub one out; go back to sleep
CHICubs,3ccicz,BobC813,6,Tue Jul 7 03:44:08 2015 UTC,Our offense is unwatchable right now. Infuriating.
CHICubs,3ccicz,SoonerJDB,3,Tue Jul 7 03:46:38 2015 UTC,Not sure what I was expecting
CHICubs,3ccicz,ViaChicago3441,4,Tue Jul 7 03:41:31 2015 UTC,1.2.3. What other way for the Cubs to go down. I hate everything
CHICubs,3ccicz,75MillionForks,3,Tue Jul 7 03:41:24 2015 UTC,5 pitch inning.  Sigh.
CHICubs,3ccicz,jp611,2,Tue Jul 7 03:41:19 2015 UTC,wtf was that inning?  okay guys.
CHICubs,3ccicz,Trakis,2,Tue Jul 7 03:41:03 2015 UTC,Fucking bullshit wide ass strikezone all night.
CHICubs,3ccicz,j4callen,2,Tue Jul 7 03:41:03 2015 UTC,Might as well well forfeit game 2 tomorrow with Beeler pitching.  There has to be a better option right?
CHICubs,3ccicz,hybridcactus,4,Tue Jul 7 03:40:57 2015 UTC,Ross?
CHICubs,3ccicz,75MillionForks,3,Tue Jul 7 03:39:43 2015 UTC,If it wasn't for the concussion that might actually be a better option.

CHICubs,3ccicz,bosque_fire,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:39:32 2015 UTC,"Goat, satan, cardinals deal with the devil, or we're still a young team that hasn't forced the good breaks by good play"

CHICubs,3ccicz,bosque_fire,7,Tue Jul 7 03:56:56 2015 UTC,"Score two runs, take this game into extras until tomorrow until the start of the double header, have two games going on at the same time because the game has to be started, take both of those into the third game, triple bases loaded for Kris Bryant, grand slam to end all three games at once.   Called it."
CHICubs,3ccicz,TugboatThomas,2,Tue Jul 7 04:21:04 2015 UTC,I'm gonna need another pencil to keep score for this...
CHICubs,3ccicz,the__rev,3,Tue Jul 7 03:39:25 2015 UTC,Exactly what I was thinking.
CHICubs,3ccicz,SoberFuck,2,Tue Jul 7 03:43:36 2015 UTC,"Welp, what did I expect for a first out"

CHICubs,3ccicz,Nebarnes,2,Tue Jul 7 03:36:43 2015 UTC,he's been pretty good though.
CHICubs,3ccicz,hybridcactus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:34:01 2015 UTC,Sending him in is like waving the white flag.

CHICubs,3ccicz,mgo2184,5,Tue Jul 7 03:30:23 2015 UTC,Let's just hope the Giants keep losing. Until the Mets get a couple bats I really don't see them as a threat. I mean we think our offense is bad...
CHICubs,3ccicz,ViaChicago3441,6,Tue Jul 7 03:22:42 2015 UTC,10:30-10:35 restart time
CHICubs,3ccicz,Gimmie_Dat_Stream,3,Tue Jul 7 03:21:31 2015 UTC,My favorite part of rain delays is watching everyone troll Len on twitter. It's pretty great to see him get into it sometimes.
CHICubs,3ccicz,shamesock,2,Tue Jul 7 03:20:50 2015 UTC,I don't care they talk about no-hitters. The part that bothers me is they act like teenagers when people are upset they talk about them.
CHICubs,3ccicz,FxStryker,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:19:31 2015 UTC,Went up to go to bed. They gonna resume?
CHICubs,3ccicz,ViaChicago3441,2,Tue Jul 7 03:24:07 2015 UTC,Looks like they are trying to
CHICubs,3ccicz,Nebarnes,6,Tue Jul 7 03:16:52 2015 UTC,I'm a bad fan. I was there and left. Got into it with one of the Best Fans In Baseball for turning around and taunting the crowd. Holy balls the clutch hitting has been awful lately. God I hate the Cardinals.
CHICubs,3ccicz,TheFakeTimShady,2,Tue Jul 7 03:18:33 2015 UTC,"I left too. I never leave, but with the ridiculous amount of rain that was on the field by the time they got the tarp on and the radar I saw on my phone I thought there was no way they were going to play again tonight."
CHICubs,3ccicz,dabears554,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:13:34 2015 UTC,"No way I thought they were going to play again tonight and I wasn't in the mood to stick it out, spent the last four innings with a security guard over my shoulder."
CHICubs,3ccicz,TheFakeTimShady,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:16:13 2015 UTC,Still looking like we made the right choice. I'm watching the cards with bases loaded on TV on my dry couch right now

CHICubs,3ccicz,Nebarnes,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:55:35 2015 UTC,why not give wood or jackson a start?
CHICubs,3ccicz,Oprah-Is-My-Dad,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:11:31 2015 UTC,I would guess that they are letting Wood settle into the BP role and E Jax is E Jax
CHICubs,3ccicz,Cohaagan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:20:15 2015 UTC,"Well his numbers aren't promising, hopefully he brings his best stuff tomorrow. Cards are starting a rookie tomorrow if I heard correctly so this isn't the worst news."
CHICubs,3ccicz,Cohaagan,4,Tue Jul 7 03:22:09 2015 UTC,...why?
CHICubs,3ccicz,los_pollos-hermanos,2,Tue Jul 7 03:19:34 2015 UTC,"No idea. It's not like the double header affects rest days, because we have a day off before the Sox series. Weird..."
CHICubs,3ccicz,i4_D_4_Mi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:16:43 2015 UTC,Unless Hammel needs an extra day or something...he went pretty deep his last start didn't he?
CHICubs,3ccicz,los_pollos-hermanos,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:20:44 2015 UTC,"Even then, it's kind of bizarre heading into the break... I'd rather see Hammel limited if that's the case than take a chance on this guy. Especially with a nice week off afterwards."
CHICubs,3ccicz,i4_D_4_Mi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:22:26 2015 UTC,To mess up the sale vs Lester dual I guess
CHICubs,3ccicz,Nebarnes,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:25:11 2015 UTC,"Going into the All Star break, we have some room to move our pitchers around a bit, so Sale vs Lester may still be on since Lester will have 4 days off between now and then"
CHICubs,3ccicz,BobC813,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:19:42 2015 UTC,But then why not just start him against sale and not the cards who may flat out ruin him.
CHICubs,3ccicz,los_pollos-hermanos,8,Tue Jul 7 03:22:55 2015 UTC,Tarp coming off
CHICubs,3ccicz,Nebarnes,5,Tue Jul 7 03:21:21 2015 UTC,"Lester's batting average for the season is now .031, 2nd lowest among all MLB players with at least one hit. Lowest is .030 - held by Jake Arrieta."
CHICubs,3ccicz,Nexhume,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:08:26 2015 UTC,this surprises me after Arrieta launched that homer in spring training.

CHICubs,3ccicz,jimrob4,3,Tue Jul 7 02:57:17 2015 UTC,Or don't cut it at all and then you only eat 1.
CHICubs,3ccicz,THEriot2,4,Tue Jul 7 03:01:39 2015 UTC,You've just cut my calorie intake in half with this one simple trick!
CHICubs,3ccicz,BobC813,2,Tue Jul 7 03:05:12 2015 UTC,Gluttons hate him!
CHICubs,3ccicz,i4_D_4_Mi,2,Tue Jul 7 03:03:43 2015 UTC,"I cheated badly on my diet tonight as well. Demolishing popsicles, bags of pretzels, etc."

CHICubs,3ccicz,bgreene777,3,Tue Jul 7 03:01:20 2015 UTC,Looking at the dark sky app if they don't start up by 10:15-10:30 is all but over unfortunately and even so they would only have a 30-45min window for 1.5 innings
CHICubs,3ccicz,Nebarnes,5,Tue Jul 7 03:00:35 2015 UTC,"So... Can we talk Castro? I personally want to love Castro, but he upsets me a lot. This guy is one of our two leaders on this team. I personally do not enjoy his lack of Respecting 90. He is not the best fielder and I am ok with that, but that whole incident in Minnesota (I think?) really just irked me. Love the contract he has, but I don't really want a guy on this team that is going to be a bad influence on this team. I was super against trading him in the beginning of the year, but seeing Russell blossom has made me feel more comfortable with parting with him. I am just really afraid that these younger guys will follow him. What are all of your views?"
CHICubs,3ccicz,BuddyTheElfTagpro,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:57:17 2015 UTC,that whole incident in Minnesota (I think?) really just irked me   What happened again?

CHICubs,3ccjn7,SenseiCAY,8,Mon Jul 6 22:19:17 2015 UTC,"Only took Ross to get a concussion.   Hopefully, Lester will realize that pitching to Montero isn't the worst thing in the world."
CHICubs,3ccjn7,glberns,12,Mon Jul 6 22:57:52 2015 UTC,I like it.  Fowler is (still) in a slump and Coghlan has been drawing walks like crazy lately.
CHICubs,3ccjn7,HelloControl_,6,Mon Jul 6 21:15:41 2015 UTC,Finally! I've been hoping they'd lead off with Coghlan one of these days. His OBP is much better than Fowler's and he seems to get games going pretty often.
CHICubs,3ccjn7,Sparx7,5,Mon Jul 6 21:49:10 2015 UTC,wheres the love button?

CHICubs,3ccjn7,JohnnyWaffleseed,2,Mon Jul 6 21:37:08 2015 UTC,Fowler has always been better from the right side and his platoon splits are extreme this year.  This is the way it should be vs RHP until Fowler starts hitting righties.

CHICubs,3cdys2,jcftw61,21,Tue Jul 7 04:12:02 2015 UTC,I feel for Lester.
CHICubs,3cdys2,Dhash23,19,Tue Jul 7 04:12:05 2015 UTC,Remember when the Cardinals had no hits in the 7th inning?

CHICubs,3cdys2,istatenation,4,Tue Jul 7 04:32:01 2015 UTC,well that and the Sale game friday
CHICubs,3cdys2,American_Soviet,4,Tue Jul 7 04:33:23 2015 UTC,Not so fast.  He didn't get ten strikeouts last time up.  This can only mean good things

There are tons of Cardinals fans there, but the area identifies with Chicago sports outside of that. So, I grew up rooting for the Cards, Hawks, Bears, and Bulls. I also watched a lot of Sox games growing up. With that being said, I hold no disdain for the Cubs. The rivalry was always a fun thing for me, and I'd love to see a Cubs ws win in my lifetime. I mean, seriously, what an exciting time for baseball! I just like sports, baseball in particular."

CHICubs,3cdys2,Dhash23,-1,Tue Jul 7 14:20:00 2015 UTC,I like the Cavs. /ducks
CHICubs,3cdys2,Malcorin,3,Tue Jul 7 04:31:45 2015 UTC,I guess I can't hate anyone who likes the Cavs seriously. It's mainly where LeBron goes.
CHICubs,3cdys2,YaygerBombs,2,Tue Jul 7 04:34:47 2015 UTC,"I don't expect you to ever not hate me, but I traveled to Cleveland for about 9 years and grew to like the team since we don't have one in STL.  The fans there are infectious with their love for the team. I've seen LJ jerseys burned and repurchased. Makes no difference to me."
CHICubs,3cdys2,voidecho,14,Tue Jul 7 04:39:54 2015 UTC,Good to see Soler go 2 for 3. Especially against a tough pitcher.
CHICubs,3cdys2,jcftw61,3,Tue Jul 7 05:05:39 2015 UTC,He made some solid contact.
CHICubs,3cdys2,thats_wassup,6,Tue Jul 7 05:09:10 2015 UTC,I'm upset by the intensity of my emotions that this game brought out. Maybe that's why the cardinals feed on. The emotions of their enemy. We need to be calm and peaceful and they will lose.
CHICubs,3cdys2,LtDarien,6,Tue Jul 7 04:28:59 2015 UTC,Montero catches Lester as he goes 6+ not allowing a hit to the Cards.  Hopefully this is the beginning of dispelling some of the personal catcher nonsense.
CHICubs,3cdys2,Cohaagan,0,Tue Jul 7 06:03:03 2015 UTC,"I don't know.  Lester allowed 4 baserunners, 3 of which stole a base.  Ross is much better at holding baserunners, which is the main point of him catching Lester.  Montero catching Lester increases the (albeit already high) incentive for runners to attempt to steal."
CHICubs,3cdys2,istatenation,11,Tue Jul 7 16:09:12 2015 UTC,"On a more positive note, I'm drunk and i have the entire day off tomorrow. See you at the double header you (mostly) negative shits!  General notes:  Good game Lester, you've been improving by leaps and bounds lately!  Congrats to Bryant and Rizzo for making it to the Mon Star game  Tomorrow is a half Arrieta day, we should be happy about that  Weather sucks and E-Jax (as I cover my head) hit most of his spots early on. The Cards are assholes who successfully hit the ball outside the zone, I hate them.  Sko Cubs, 3/4 ain't bad!"
CHICubs,3cdys2,Cohaagan,3,Tue Jul 7 04:26:40 2015 UTC,You had my upvote until I read the positive message about Ejax. I'm too salty right now
CHICubs,3cdys2,LtDarien,3,Tue Jul 7 04:33:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah he's not ideal but he's been better in the bullpen this year. And he wasn't pitching terribly to the first few batters is all I was saying, they got good swings on decent pitches. I'm not saying he is a solution to anything, but he is better now than he was a year ago. Take that as you will, I'd rather have C.J. Edwards pitching but in the meantime, E-Jax is servicable. Plus we won't see him tomorrow, so that's good news"

CHICubs,3cdys2,Thetiredduck,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:03:03 2015 UTC,"Richard just pitched on Saturday.  Double headers allow the Cubs to call up a 26th man and, IIRC, they generally call up a pitcher for one of the games so their regular starters stay on normal rest."

CHICubs,3cdys2,Sparx7,3,Tue Jul 7 04:12:21 2015 UTC,Edwin Jackson's pitching strategy is to put the bat on the ball.

CHICubs,3cdys2,Cohaagan,4,Tue Jul 7 04:12:43 2015 UTC,Textbook Cubs Cards game right there.  Honestly worried about getting swept again.
CHICubs,3cdys2,hybridcactus,6,Tue Jul 7 04:15:19 2015 UTC,"Chill out buddy, they have 2 young pitchers starting tomorrow and our bats have to wake up at some point. This is the Cards, let's get pumped!"
CHICubs,3cdys2,Cohaagan,3,Tue Jul 7 04:18:39 2015 UTC,Your right but I can't help but be a little concerned.

CHICubs,3cdys2,ChicagoKoolAid,2,Tue Jul 7 04:14:31 2015 UTC,I'm glad I missed the end.  Barf.
CHICubs,3cdys2,MLWolfie,2,Tue Jul 7 04:32:58 2015 UTC,"Was able to catch the first 7 innings in a Dallas airport bar and have a few takeaways. First, it's games like this that remind me why this team still has strides yet taken. I'd be saying the same thing if we won 10-0 tomorrow, but a no-hitter into the 7th with 0 runs on offense is despicable. You can have sound defense all you want, but a lack of runs gets you absolutely nowhere in baseball. At this point I don't know whether to be shocked, angry, or just laugh because I should honestly be used to this by now. Second, I'm beginning to fully embrace the Pirates as the best chance of dethroning the Cardinals for the division. They're playing really good baseball and it's tough to see us passing them with offensive performances like this. They actually have a shot at eclipsing the Cardinals and as much as I would like to embrace Rizzo's preseason comments about how we're going to win the division, it's just not going to happen. When a team that's 7 games over .500 is not only 3rd in the division, but behind teams that are a combined 40 games over, the competition's way too stiff. I still loved Rizzo's attitude that we're going to win it because it at least signaled that rebuilding was over, but the best we can realistically pull for is a spot in the wild card game. I get that the July schedule is really easy and I'm trying to not have a knee jerk reaction, but it's hard to see us clawing back from 9.5 games back against the top 2 teams in baseball. That's why I embrace the Pirates as the best shot to be an NL Central champ not named the Cardinals. At that point if we make it to the wild card game and matchup with the Cardinals I hope we can give Lester some run support otherwise it'll just be like the game we witnessed. I want to be optimistic but at this point it's getting increasingly difficult.   That's all from me. Good night, and please God let us get some runs for Arrieta."
CHICubs,3cdys2,cgoods94,6,Tue Jul 7 06:32:00 2015 UTC,"Sigh, Of course everything always goes the Cardinals way, no matter what"
CHICubs,3cdys2,nab95,2,Tue Jul 7 04:28:48 2015 UTC,Know how I know 2017 is the year? Edwin Jackson's contract only goes through 2016.
CHICubs,3cdys2,Nebarnes,4,Tue Jul 7 04:12:01 2015 UTC,The people who are calling for Edwin Jackson to be DFA'd need to exit the circlejerk and go take a gander at his stats. He has been serviceable all year.
CHICubs,3cdys2,hybridcactus,10,Tue Jul 7 04:17:21 2015 UTC,"We are 3-18 in games he's pitched, idc what his stats are he's used in no pressure outings so we don't have to burn up our actual pitchers Edit: stats"
CHICubs,3cdys2,Nebarnes,4,Tue Jul 7 04:20:54 2015 UTC,somebody has to eat those innings and he's done a pretty decent job at it. I don't really see an issue.
CHICubs,3cdys2,hybridcactus,4,Tue Jul 7 04:24:47 2015 UTC,"He's taking up a roster spot for a useful pitcher, when we have another 12+ inning game do we really want E-jax coming in? I don't I'd rather see Soriano or medina or even Edwards"
CHICubs,3cdys2,Nebarnes,0,Tue Jul 7 04:34:07 2015 UTC,But E-jax has proven that he can be pretty competent out of the bullpen this season.  If the cubs were out of the running i suppose i wouldn't have a problem seeing some of the other guys but right now E-jax is a semi-proven MLB bullpen arm.
CHICubs,3cdys2,hybridcactus,2,Tue Jul 7 04:52:23 2015 UTC,"He's useless except for a circus act and some hometown groans  He's 14-33 for the Cubs, 19 games under .500 career, and 4.59 era I wouldn't call that semi-proven Edit: stats"
CHICubs,3cdys2,Nebarnes,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:56:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah there is no doubt he has been a terrible player for the cubs overall, I don't think we were debating that.  What i was saying was that THIS YEAR he has been a decently reliable innings eater.  Just because he was awful last year doesn't mean he is completely useless."
CHICubs,3cdys2,hybridcactus,3,Tue Jul 7 05:08:17 2015 UTC,"He's been better than what we are used to from him but is average to below average at best, we have young guys waiting for a chance below and should give it to them"
CHICubs,3cdys2,nab95,2,Tue Jul 7 05:19:17 2015 UTC,i get what your saying. I'm curious to see what those guys can do as well.
CHICubs,3cdys2,Nebarnes,-1,Tue Jul 7 05:26:41 2015 UTC,Why does that matter? There's no reason to DFA him. He's doing fine in the role we need him for.
CHICubs,3cdys2,Dhash23,5,Tue Jul 7 04:24:01 2015 UTC,"Because it's a wasted roster spot, especially 2nd half of the season when off days will be few and far between cuz of rain outs, i trust wood more as a long reliever and he's competent with a bat, no reason to have a guy on the roster just cuz he's expensive"
CHICubs,3cdys2,imeatingpancakes,7,Tue Jul 7 04:28:27 2015 UTC,Just a lot of old feelings being brought up again. It'll pass.

CHICubs,3cc8se,decitertiember,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:00:14 2015 UTC,He caught for him for at least 1 inning if not 2 in Lester's last start when Ross had his concussion.
CHICubs,3cc8se,dpete10,2,Mon Jul 6 21:11:30 2015 UTC,"Other than Bryant and Coghlan this whole lineup is struggling, and Bryant just recently has broken out of his mini slump.   Rizzo only has 3 hits in his last 35 trips to the plate. He has been hit by pitches the same number of times over that span.  Montero has 4 hits and 11 K's in his last 27 ABs. Soler hasn't gotten a hit in the big leagues since May. Castro is 8 for his last 46.  And then the bottom third of the order is even worse (Fowler 8 for 51, Lester 0 for his career and Russell 4 for his last 42).  I have faith this lineup will be productive one day, but right now it is a train-wreck."

His plus power/hit tool combination shredded the minors, earning him a taste of major-league action in 2015. His work ethic and high baseball IQ give him a chance to become a catch-every-so-often guy, increasing his value substantially as he separates himself from the dreaded corner-only profile  Torres - Developmental Update: It’s important to keep things in perspective with young players. Torres’ success in the Midwest League as an 18-year-old is remarkable, but it does not raise his ceiling. It does, however, place him much closer to reaching it than most of his adolescent counterparts. There are questions about his ability to stay at shortstop thanks to his subpar speed, but his actions in the infield should allow him to stay there for the time being. He doesn’t feature enough power to be an impact bat, but there is no questioning his hit tool, which will no doubt carry him to a big league career; we can't say that about most teenagers."

I've heard some ""old time"" Chicagoans that are legit -- grew up here, in the actual city -- say they're just baseball fans like you and me (maybe their allegiances switch a bit, but they watch both teams without worry). And I also had one woman who I'm pretty sure grew up in the burbs just basically speechlessly angry with me that I would ever think it would be possible to be a fan of both.  So, fuck it, because the naysayers don't seem to represent the how the modern city of Chicago feels as a whole.  HAVING SAID THAT, you better believe I'm gonna be in red and blue for the Cubs/Sox series."

CHICubs,3c9nru,Sparx7,10,Mon Jul 6 12:13:48 2015 UTC,I'm so disappointed in Fowler since April. I was a huge supporter of his since the acquisition.
CHICubs,3c9nru,THEriot2,5,Mon Jul 6 13:22:05 2015 UTC,Yeah me too it fit perfectly especially since he started hot and luis started slow I got so excited.....then this
CHICubs,3c9nru,Sparx7,5,Mon Jul 6 13:28:02 2015 UTC,He needs to stop trying to be a switch hitter and just hit from the right side. His splits are something like 340 from the right side and 210 from the left.   At this point he needs to start trying to hit RHP from the right side or platoon because he is terrible from the left side of the plate.

CHICubs,3c9nru,ChicagoRunner,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:38:18 2015 UTC,honestly theres a lot of people/players who talk about the high altitude makes injuries worse and linger more.  So you might have a little pain then head back and shit swells up.  Now I have nothing to back this up but its been talked about numerous times
CHICubs,3c9nru,Sparx7,2,Mon Jul 6 13:44:04 2015 UTC,I have not actually heard that. I was just checking his stats and obviously he has much better numbers at home but his away stats aren't bad. But 17 and 20 mil for the next two seasons is a bit steep.
CHICubs,3c9nru,Mrpenguindeluxe,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:47:48 2015 UTC,Cheap compared to what he'd fetch on the open market with a career .858 OPS
CHICubs,3c9nru,Sparx7,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:54:33 2015 UTC,"True that. Wonder what it would take to get him. I could see after the Baltimore and Oakland trades that teams don't want to be the next ones to be fleeced by Jed and Theo. But we were acquiring prospects then, so who knows.

CHICubs,3c9nru,Sparx7,3,Mon Jul 6 13:44:56 2015 UTC,"none of those guys are going anywhere, except maybe Vogelbach.  Why on earth would we trade Almora, McKinney, Torres or Jimenez at this stage of their development?"
CHICubs,3c9nru,wretch5150,3,Mon Jul 6 19:42:07 2015 UTC,well why trade anyone to get better we should just send off shit spects and expect great return!

CHICubs,3c9nru,wretch5150,2,Tue Jul 7 00:23:50 2015 UTC,Almora has been stagnant. He could very well disappear. It wouldn't be so bad to think about dealing him
CHICubs,3c9nru,TandBusquets,3,Mon Jul 6 19:55:01 2015 UTC,oh?  remind me of his age and what level he plays at?
CHICubs,3c9nru,wretch5150,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:22:36 2015 UTC,He's a year and a half from being called up at best. He's doing terrible in double AA ATM so he could very well not pan out and if anyone doesn't pan out I bet it will be almora
CHICubs,3c9nru,TandBusquets,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:40:19 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, how old is Almora?"

CHICubs,3c9nru,TandBusquets,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:07:07 2015 UTC,I hear you.  There's just very little reason to trade away a prospect of his caliber THIS season when holes can be plugged via free agency in the offseason. Almora is still a valuable project.
CHICubs,3c9nru,wretch5150,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:00:44 2015 UTC,And if we keep him and he doesn't pan out?
CHICubs,3c9nru,TandBusquets,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:02:41 2015 UTC,I'm willing to bet that the Cubs brass are going to continue to develop Almora at AA since he just turned 21.  You have a problem with that?
CHICubs,3c9nru,wretch5150,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:26:58 2015 UTC,"For those interested, Almora is batting .250 this season, his second at Double-A Tennesee.  He just turned 21, and is 3 years younger than the average AA player."
CHICubs,3c9nru,wretch5150,2,Tue Jul 7 12:52:22 2015 UTC,torres isn't going anywhere and almora's value is at rock bottom right now because of the terrible season he's having at the plate so it wouldn't make sense to trade him

CHICubs,3c779z,glberns,-33,Sun Jul 5 18:45:15 2015 UTC,"Before Theo, the Cubs knew something other than 5th place... Now.....  Plus after the call ups they aren't the best farm currently."
CHICubs,3c779z,Kash6,16,Sun Jul 5 20:34:40 2015 UTC,"Are you really comparing the veteran players of 2000 say 09-2014 as equal to the young, cost controlled, elite prospect of talent that the Cubs have right now majors minors or whatever? That makes less than zero sense. The Cubs played with a bunch of cast offs, Starlin Castro and Anthony Rizzo for 2.5 years. They've gone through ORGANIZATIONAL philosophy changes. Yes Henry sniffed 3 playoffs but look at the outcome. A tired rotation blew it in 03. Poor execution and plate approach in 07-08. A broken clock is wrong twice a day my man. No one is screaming the Cubs have done anything yet, hell thats all Maddon and Epstein preach, but to discredit the FO based on 2010-2014, well that screams of someone who wasn't paying attention to what ACTUALLY goes on. Results don't necessarily guarantee recognition. On the flip side though, recognition doesn't have to come strictly by results. The Cubs graduated a ton of players true but their Farm is still top tier since the just pure depth they have. They have another Adison Russell in Glyber Torreys, another Kris bryant in Jemier Candelario, and another Jorge Soler in Eloy Jimenez. Those are going to be top 100 prospects in all of baseball. Maybe not top 10 like Bryant and Russell, but don't sleep on that Farm. Those guys are in the low minors with years to go before their conversations even start. The just pure acquisition phase by Theo and com sets the Cubs up in a very nice spot. They can leverage those prospects to get MLB ready talent. That's the point. Let them develop and be good for the Cubs or be in a deal that lands you a Giancarlo Stanton or Cole Hamels. This is just year 1 of relevancy my man. You can not ignore the work that has been done. Say they aren't the best FO whatever. Some people like superlatives, but to compare them to Jim Hendry? I don't see how you can even use them in the same sentence unless the sentence reads ""the last two GMS for the Chicago Cubs were Jim Hendry and Jed Hoyer, under operating team President Theo Nathaniel Epstein""."

CHICubs,3c779z,Kash6,11,Sun Jul 5 17:57:23 2015 UTC,Hendry was scrambling to save his job. A bunch of older overpaid players. Zell fucked a lot of shit up but the system was still shit. Cashner hasn't been great the FO flipped him for a stud Baez hasn't done anything (yet) alcantara has been shit.
CHICubs,3c779z,Sparx7,-16,Sun Jul 5 18:00:34 2015 UTC,Tune sure changed with Baez and Alcantara. You can't say the cupboard was empty when Theo used Hendry pieces like Cashner and Garza and the difficult task of being in dead last to fill it.

I think cubs history boils down completely to ownership. For over half of the team's history ownership hasn't cared. Besides, 'playoffs' didn't start until 69 and even then it was just the championship series until 93. So just making it the series or league championship means you were a good team."

All three were absolutely delicious, but my rankings are as follows:  1 - The Carmen Fanzone  A spicy polish sausage topped with brown mustard and sautéed onions on a poppy seed bun.  2 - The Rick Reuchel  An ""atomic sausage"" topped with chipotle mustard and grated pepper jack cheese.  3 - The Dave Kingman  A bacon cheeseburger sausage topped with barbeque sauce and grated orange cheddar cheese.     I probably liked the flavor of the Rick most, but the heat was a little too much for me. The Kingman was my buddy's favorite, and the combo of the cheddar and the bacon cheeseburger sausage was amazing, but I'm just not a fan of BBQ sauce on anything that isn't, well, BBQ.  The Carmen was great. I love a good, brown mustard, and you can never go wrong with sautéed onions. The sausage on this one was easily the largest of the three. It was basically a Vienna beef dog with a little bit of kick to it.  Any of the three I could easily see being someone else's favorite. The bleacher concessions are seriously top notch now."

CHICubs,3c9gb4,snowcone_wars,7,Mon Jul 6 03:21:23 2015 UTC,What really blows me away about that stat is that the Cubs also have Rafael Soriano (hopefully) joining sometime this month AND C.J. Edwards sitting in the minors with his career worst 1.20 WHIP pitching out of the Iowa bullpen. That kid's live arm might be big down the stretch if there's an injury.

Of course the #5 spot is shaky but if you look around the league I don't think you'll find a team that isn't interested in upgrading their #5."
CHICubs,3c9gb4,TheFakeTimShady,6,Mon Jul 6 15:41:42 2015 UTC,who would have thought that going into the season that our pitching would outstretch out batting by a long way   Pretty much anyone who looked at the stats from last year...

CHICubs,3c79jp,fightintxag13,7,Sun Jul 5 20:22:37 2015 UTC,Agreed.  He re-plants the back foot.  Absolutely not within the rules and the MLB is spineless for allowing it.
CHICubs,3c79jp,airham,2,Sun Jul 5 20:25:14 2015 UTC,It looks like fast pitch softball rules are being enforced.

CHICubs,3c79jp,glassroc1,7,Sun Jul 5 20:23:47 2015 UTC,Seriously what's the point of having the mound then? Why not just let him throw from 58 feet?
CHICubs,3c79jp,Cubsfan5ever,-3,Sun Jul 5 20:25:32 2015 UTC,"Because if they did, he'd throw from 55."
CHICubs,3c79jp,airham,-8,Sun Jul 5 20:27:13 2015 UTC,Because we fucking can. MLB has reviewed. It's allowed. Quit your bitching.
CHICubs,3c79jp,glassroc1,0,Sun Jul 5 20:26:46 2015 UTC,If his back foot didn't hit and slightly replant I'd have no problem with it.

CHICubs,3c79jp,Sparx7,-4,Sun Jul 5 20:16:18 2015 UTC,Can't give the pitcher that call...
CHICubs,3c79jp,JL16,3,Sun Jul 5 20:15:44 2015 UTC,A ball thrown in the strike zone? What's wrong with that?
CHICubs,3c79jp,InHelixWeGust,-1,Sun Jul 5 20:17:40 2015 UTC,Lmao yea cause every pitch that hits the black is a strike to this ump
CHICubs,3c79jp,JL16,3,Sun Jul 5 20:20:31 2015 UTC,It was completely inside the strike zone according to gameday.  As in no part of ball was outside it.
CHICubs,3c79jp,LtDarien,-1,Sun Jul 5 20:21:55 2015 UTC,going by gameday lol least accurate zone you can go by
CHICubs,3c79jp,JL16,4,Sun Jul 5 20:30:34 2015 UTC,Ah the ole' Strop-a-dope slider. Great strikeout!

CHICubs,3c79jp,glassroc1,3,Sun Jul 5 20:14:57 2015 UTC,Gameday has it completely inside the strike zone.
CHICubs,3c79jp,LtDarien,2,Sun Jul 5 20:16:05 2015 UTC,When the target is missed that bad they usually call it a ball
CHICubs,3c79jp,Shmony,3,Sun Jul 5 20:17:12 2015 UTC,It was in the strike zone.
CHICubs,3c79jp,AtlasStarwind,-2,Sun Jul 5 20:15:26 2015 UTC,"Barely caught the black, missed his spot, late break. Shouldn't get that pitch."
CHICubs,3c79jp,JL16,2,Sun Jul 5 20:16:57 2015 UTC,Before he went on the DL it was nearly imposible for Morse to turn on a pitch.

CHICubs,3c79jp,cgoods94,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:15:26 2015 UTC,Omar infante would like a word
CHICubs,3c79jp,Weasel_Man,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:13:05 2015 UTC,Just put an out on the board. Ozuna is a just god-awful slump right now.
CHICubs,3c79jp,glassroc1,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:08:58 2015 UTC,What was the song that played in the commercial for the kap show?
CHICubs,3c79jp,BpFal3,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:08:43 2015 UTC,3 balls hit hard right at people. We're slumping AND getting unlucky.
CHICubs,3c79jp,SoonerJDB,3,Sun Jul 5 20:07:49 2015 UTC,"Anyone else catch that stat? The only hit today was Bryant's obviously, but the last one before that was Bryant's homer yesterday in the 2nd inning. Crazy"
CHICubs,3c79jp,RyanTheCubsSTH,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:07:21 2015 UTC,And you will likely win both games. A true testament to just how bad our offense can be at times and how good our pitching can be at times. Neither ever really seem to lineup.
CHICubs,3c79jp,glassroc1,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:08:07 2015 UTC,Except for that 17-0 game. That was a fun day.   Edit: didn't see your flair. True for both teams.

CHICubs,3c79jp,Shmony,3,Sun Jul 5 20:06:16 2015 UTC,Not really all that surprising the way the Cubs offense has been lately.
CHICubs,3c79jp,erindizmo,2,Sun Jul 5 20:07:45 2015 UTC,Does anyone know how Soler did in his rehab assignments?
CHICubs,3c79jp,Hibachi4242,2,Sun Jul 5 20:05:52 2015 UTC,Started cold

CHICubs,3c79jp,Sparx7,3,Sun Jul 5 20:02:57 2015 UTC,What is that 83 pitches through 7? Pretty damn impressive.
CHICubs,3c79jp,RCoombs77,5,Sun Jul 5 20:01:49 2015 UTC,The Cubs need to do a raffle. 5 dollars a ticket and they draw a winner who gets to sing the stretch and the money goes to charity.

CHICubs,3c7ees,tjb122982,10,Sun Jul 5 16:10:10 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I hate a small portion of my fellow Cubs fans.  At the beginning of the season one such genius told me how they need to ""Get rid of everyone and just call everyone up!"" and proceeded to go through a list of players including Vogelbach we should call up.  I guess he thought we should ship out Rizzo and start Vogelbach instead.  I didn't care to ask.   He even inanely describe how it was far better to bring up Bryant for two weeks rather than an additional season.  ""It gives him more experience!""   All you can do is shake your head and walk away from these ""fans""."
CHICubs,3c7ees,coydog33,6,Sun Jul 5 17:03:04 2015 UTC,I hate stupidity. People forget that part of the terms of the sale were limitations on what they can spend. They're also ignoring the investing in the Latin and Asian markets. Lastly look at the money invested into and around Wrigley. They've taken an old overpaid roster with one of the worst systems in baseball to a young exciting team who still has one of the best farms in baseball. I guess fans want the Hendry way just throwing money at the problem.
CHICubs,3c7ees,Sparx7,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:58:09 2015 UTC,What were the limitations?
CHICubs,3c7ees,voidecho,2,Sun Jul 5 18:15:44 2015 UTC,"I can't remember the exact terms but they basically had a cap on how much they could spend on payroll because of the financing of the purchase of the Cubs for a specific amount of years. Theo and hoyer would come in under that and created a ""war chest"" of money to use for big contracts when they were ready to compete. That money was first tried to use on tanaka then was eventually used for Lester."
CHICubs,3c7ees,Sparx7,2,Sun Jul 5 18:19:47 2015 UTC,"Allegedly, the Tribune wanted to get out of paying their fair share of taxes on the sale so they worked up a scheme to limit their tax liability. They created a company and the Tribune and the Ricketts became partners of the company. The Tribune put the Cubs into the company and the Ricketts coughed up cash and a lot of debt. I believe that a lot of the money had to be borrowed as a part of the alleged tax dodging. They borrowed a lot. There's a MLB rule that limits how much debt a team can have. Under current conditions a team can only have 8 times the debt of their current profit. Example: if you have $400 million of debt then you have to have $50 million profit. (I think) I believe that they're limited on how quickly they can pay off the debt as well. I think that they have to wait until, at least 2019 to pay it off. They have re-financed the debt but I think that they have only been allowed to pay off a little.  Here's a better explanation than I can give but the story is long... http://www.bleachernation.com/2014/03/19/the-chicago-cubs-financial-story-the-payroll-the-debt-and-the-syncing-of-baseball-and-business-plans/"

But even if they brought him up I don't know where he'd play unless he spent one game a week at each 2B, SS, 3B, and LF.

CHICubs,3c5vic,pm_me_ur_pajamas,4,Sun Jul 5 13:24:07 2015 UTC,Before he got hurt I thought the rumor was he was coming up to play 3rd and Bryant was moving go LF full time.

CHICubs,3c5r6n,LtDarien,25,Sun Jul 5 02:03:05 2015 UTC,Everyone in the neighborhood is still out drinking beers and letting their kid pop off fireworks....I have an outdoor speaker system attached to my pergola. I am about to crank up 'Go Cubs Go' and 'Sweet Home Chicago' and light off all sorts of aerials.   Love America. Love the Cubs. Love you all. Let us all remember the true meaning of a day like this. Home of the free because of the Brave. God Bless our troops!!

But a good first outing for Richard, a 6 RBI game for Bryant, and scoring 7 runs is nothing to be sad about.  A great first two innings before it got boring for a while, but a win is a win.  [W!]"

CHICubs,3c4uac,Captain_019,2,Sun Jul 5 01:15:33 2015 UTC,Former Cubs farmhand Justin Bour. Who knew he would become good.
CHICubs,3c4uac,Kaner_95,2,Sun Jul 5 01:15:29 2015 UTC,I thought Richard's first run was unearned due to the Bryant error?
CHICubs,3c4uac,voidecho,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:15:15 2015 UTC,Still earned becaus he allowed the base runners to get on safely. A double play is never assumed when it comes to stats.
CHICubs,3c4uac,Den1mChiken,2,Sun Jul 5 01:17:55 2015 UTC,"That being said, you could assume Bryant goes home for the force out.  Next batter strikes out.  No runs if not for error, but that's not the official way to score it."
CHICubs,3c4uac,voidecho,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:30:09 2015 UTC,"True, you could say that's what he might do. But generally, fielder's choices are not assumed either. Like you said, it's never been scored that way."
CHICubs,3c4uac,Den1mChiken,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:34:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right. Thought there were two outs."
CHICubs,3c4uac,voidecho,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:27:44 2015 UTC,"Terrific start. I can see Richard being what Paul Maholm was to the team a few years back. A good #3-5 left hander with finesse stuff who pitches to contact and can get out of jams. Good move, Theo."
CHICubs,3c4uac,Den1mChiken,3,Sun Jul 5 01:14:11 2015 UTC,At least Fox hasn't brought this out.
CHICubs,3c4uac,cubshound,2,Sun Jul 5 01:13:57 2015 UTC,nice game by Richard.  Hopefully he turns into another successful Bosio reclamation

CHICubs,3c4uac,Captain_019,3,Sun Jul 5 01:12:38 2015 UTC,"""From the 7th inning on, Cubs have the best bullpen in baseball.""  That true? Anybody have any numbers to back that up? I know they've been solid lately but best..."
CHICubs,3c4uac,I_Sugest_Comic_Sans,2,Sun Jul 5 01:10:57 2015 UTC,It's true.
CHICubs,3c4uac,SomeoneSomethingJr,6,Sun Jul 5 01:19:17 2015 UTC,Coming from Fox it's probably a lie unfortunately.
CHICubs,3c4uac,MorningWoodWorker,2,Sun Jul 5 01:11:45 2015 UTC,That's why I was hoping somebody would have some numbers lol
CHICubs,3c4uac,I_Sugest_Comic_Sans,2,Sun Jul 5 01:12:30 2015 UTC,No Fox Sports will say just about anything. Watching this game reminds me why Fox has ruined football for me doing similar shit.
CHICubs,3c4uac,MorningWoodWorker,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:16:56 2015 UTC,They said 2.26 ERA from the 7th inning or later. I believe it. Our middle relief is usually the problem.
CHICubs,3c4uac,Den1mChiken,2,Sun Jul 5 01:15:31 2015 UTC,"Wow, just realized that we only have 4 hits. We walked several times though."
CHICubs,3c4uac,Captain_019,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:09:53 2015 UTC,Only 3 walks.  Wouldn't call that a bunch.  But Everybody who got a hit or walked later scored.  Rizzo was the only runner the Cubs left on base after his HBP.
CHICubs,3c4uac,LtDarien,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:12:57 2015 UTC,Have we had a hit since the second inning?

CHICubs,3c4uac,destinybond,2,Sun Jul 5 01:06:01 2015 UTC,2nd career grand slam
CHICubs,3c4uac,Den1mChiken,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:07:39 2015 UTC,The first time the stat was on the board in the park it said first. His following at bat they adjusted it to second.
CHICubs,3c4uac,NitroxDragon,3,Sun Jul 5 01:10:41 2015 UTC,The stats showed that he once hit a grand slam before this.  But you are live at the game so you probably didn't know about that.
CHICubs,3c4uac,Harrason,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:07:12 2015 UTC,Guess the scoreboard was wrong
CHICubs,3c4uac,destinybond,2,Sun Jul 5 01:10:38 2015 UTC,It was off an outfielder.  Bryant probably doesn't count it either.
CHICubs,3c4uac,voidecho,2,Sun Jul 5 01:09:38 2015 UTC,At the game the video board incorrectly said 1st career gs. Maybe meant at Wrigley but that's not what it said

CHICubs,3c4uac,voidecho,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:12:54 2015 UTC,Made too many. Reverting to red bull vodkas to come out of the food coma
CHICubs,3c52x6,SomeoneSomethingJr,9,Sat Jul 4 21:33:32 2015 UTC,"To recap why so many moves were needed:  RHP Clayton Richard became available from the Pirates due to a clause in his contract saying that he must be offered to other major league teams if he wasn't promoted by a certain date (July 1, I think). The Pirates didn't promote him, and the Cubs decided to take a shot with only cash going the other way. This move requires the Cubs to place him on their major league roster, so he replaces Donn Roach on the 25-man roster but the 40-man roster is one over capacity at this point.  David Ross received a concussion in Wednesday's game (thus why Montero replaced him in that game) and was still showing symptoms so the Cubs put him on the concussion DL. They called up Taylor Teagarden to take his spot, and this move puts the Cubs at two over the limit on the 40-man roster.  To make room on the 40-man roster for these two additions, Tommy La Stella was transferred to the 60-day DL and Gonzalez Germen was designated for assignment. We really haven't heard much about La Stella since his setback in May, but he hasn't started rehabbing again so we can assume he will be out for a bit longer. Germen was picked up this off-season when someone DFA'd him and it wouldn't be the biggest loss if someone else picks him up should we end up waiving him this week. The best case scenarios are that he makes it through waivers or we trade him for an IFA slot (which is really just helping us save on overage tax at this point)."
CHICubs,3c52x6,ShinjoB,2,Sat Jul 4 21:51:27 2015 UTC,When did Ross take over to the head?
CHICubs,3c52x6,Lukester123,2,Sat Jul 4 21:40:45 2015 UTC,Against the Mets he took a pretty wicked foul ball off the mask. That's all I can think of
CHICubs,3c52x6,octobadger,2,Sun Jul 5 17:12:36 2015 UTC,"Teagarden has been hitting/playing well in Iowa. Interested to see how/if he provides any offense that Ross couldn't (although, I'm sure he probably won't even play a game before Ross comes back)."
CHICubs,3c52x6,Oprah-Is-My-Dad,2,Sat Jul 4 22:23:11 2015 UTC,I kinda doubt they're planning on having montero start 6-7 straight games
CHICubs,3c52x6,THEriot2,2,Sun Jul 5 04:57:09 2015 UTC,Teagarden will definitely start one of the games on Tuesday. He won't stick with the club no matter how he performs though.
CHICubs,3c52x6,inevitablescape,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:40:41 2015 UTC,When did Germen last pitch?
CHICubs,3c52x6,iam2eeyore,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:51:00 2015 UTC,"That's crazy. Earlier today I was looking at Iowa's stats and I was thinking that Teagarden deserved another shot. He's doing well, but sitting behind Schwarber. I don't think that he'll be Johnny Bench but he could be good enough."
CHICubs,3c52x6,Loop_Within_A_Loop,2,Sat Jul 4 22:02:30 2015 UTC,"I think Teagarden's in a weird fucking spot, though.  SchWARber is the future here as far as any player not currently on our roster is. Miggy's only 31, so he's probably got 5 more good years in him or so.  I suppose he's getting a chance to prove himself, but I guess I just don't see his roster spot opening here, and I don't see him having a ton of itnerest in the trade market."
CHICubs,3c52x6,Oprah-Is-My-Dad,2,Sun Jul 5 02:12:51 2015 UTC,He's 31 years old so I'm pretty sure he knows his best hope is to stick as a backup catcher somewhere

CHICubs,3c4egr,Oprah-Is-My-Dad,3,Sat Jul 4 19:16:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure anything needs done.  Quite a few guys are underperforming and will probably get hot in the coming months.  Castro is hitting 22 pts below his career average.  His OPS is over 90 lower.  Cobra is 18 pts lower than his career average.  Miggy is hitting 18.5 pts lower than his career average, although better than the last two years and his OPS is up.  Fowler is the biggest issue.  He's the key table setter in front of Rizzo and Bryant and he's hitting 40 pts lower than his career average.  His OPS is down around 100 pts from his career average.    Fowler gets hot and the offense follows.  Edit to add...yes I know Fowler played mostly in Colorado."
CHICubs,3c4egr,voidecho,2,Sat Jul 4 18:14:44 2015 UTC,Can Baez play CF? :p
CHICubs,3c4egr,iam2eeyore,3,Sat Jul 4 18:41:57 2015 UTC,Bryant can.
CHICubs,3c4egr,voidecho,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:42:56 2015 UTC,Is the combo of Bryant in CF and Baez at 3rd a better combo than Bryant at 3rd and Baez in CF?
CHICubs,3c4egr,iam2eeyore,3,Sat Jul 4 22:07:48 2015 UTC,"Not sure, but I know Bryant has played CF.  No idea if Baez has."
CHICubs,3c4egr,voidecho,2,Sat Jul 4 22:13:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with those who say we can get better without adding anyone, but if we do add someone it should be Zobrist. He's an offensive upgrade, but because he can move around he doesn't have to be as much of a talent block who pushes developing players off the field or out of position."
CHICubs,3c4egr,bobisterbezreal,2,Sat Jul 4 21:33:00 2015 UTC,"Patience.  Anyone who expected this team to jump up from a ""bad"" to ""good"" offense this year really underestimated how bad they were last year.  On the best of days, we have three rookies starting (Bryant, Russell, Soler).  That is not a recipe for continued offensive success.  The best thing to do is just let them grow as ballplayers.  The window isn't this year, it is the next four."
CHICubs,3c4egr,callthebluff,2,Sun Jul 5 18:24:00 2015 UTC,"Anybody know why they didn't call up Schwarber instead of Teagarden? I've never heard of this guy before, and I think we could really use Schwarb's bat against the Cards."
CHICubs,3c4egr,aussum_possum,4,Sat Jul 4 23:16:24 2015 UTC,Schwarber needs everyday work at catcher to get his defense up to speed. He won't get that opportunity with the big league club.
CHICubs,3c4egr,ioweaniowan,0,Sun Jul 5 01:14:57 2015 UTC,That's true. I'm still wondering what his place with the Cubs we'll be if he stays at catcher considering we already have two.
CHICubs,3c4egr,aussum_possum,3,Sun Jul 5 03:49:11 2015 UTC,ScWARber would be the right now move. Keeping ScWARber in AAA to work on his catching is a move for the next 10 years.
CHICubs,3c1e3s,naadams,14,Fri Jul 3 21:38:12 2015 UTC,But can he hit?
CHICubs,3c1e3s,STUstone,4,Fri Jul 3 22:20:04 2015 UTC,Can't be worse than what we've been dealing with lately.
CHICubs,3c1e3s,maxelrod,3,Fri Jul 3 22:27:07 2015 UTC,Does he get on base?
CHICubs,3c1e3s,FrankInTheHouse,10,Sat Jul 4 00:04:42 2015 UTC,What'd we give up?
CHICubs,3c1e3s,Loop_Within_A_Loop,9,Fri Jul 3 21:47:50 2015 UTC,Looks like cash considerations

Also played against him in HS.. I like this move, especially for only cash considerations.  Also, Richard was the main asset in the 2009 trade that brought Jake Peavy to the White Sox (1-4 person deal).. he was pretty good at one time."

CHICubs,3c1e3s,thats_wassup,3,Fri Jul 3 22:13:19 2015 UTC,I went there too. Saw his MLB debut for the Sox in 09 or whenever. He had a few really good seasons before the shoulder injury. He could be a good number 4 or 5 pitcher.
CHICubs,3c1e3s,nakolas,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:34:01 2015 UTC,He's 29 - he should be dominating AAA. Looks like he was good in 2013 for the Padres but lost his mojo last year.

CHICubs,3c1e3s,Sparx7,2,Fri Jul 3 21:46:31 2015 UTC,Looks like the trading/acquiring frenzy has begun

CHICubs,3c1e3s,herptydurr,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:41:50 2015 UTC,"He has the same thing people pointed out on Roach too; for all that he limits runs in AAA, he rally doesn't get many strikeouts."

CHICubs,3c1e3s,dsalmon1449,2,Fri Jul 3 22:16:21 2015 UTC,cause all he costs is cash and has great numbers in AAA this year with big league success.
CHICubs,3c1e3s,NicCage420,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:15:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, plus he can't possibly do worse than Roach and it's not like there's another starter at AAA waiting to be brought up."
CHICubs,3c1e3s,friendly-confines,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:51:35 2015 UTC,"Pushes the 40 man roster to 41. Wonder if Roach gets the full DFA treatment or if someone like Jokish or Beeler tries to get slipped through.  edit: now that I think on it, probably La Stella to the 60 day."

We seem to do pretty competitively against the good teams, but can't seem to win against teams like Arizona, Miami, etc. Maybe it's just confirmation bias combined with the frustrations over the last week of offensive offense. In fact, it probably is. I'm glad that I'm even frustrated over it this year. Last season I was just numb to everything. The fact that I'm frustrated is acknowledgement that they are in it, but need to find their stride to stay in it."

CHICubs,3c1b44,YourCummyBear,4,Fri Jul 3 21:53:42 2015 UTC,"Here is the thing. Folwer and Castro aren't hitting near their career numbers right now, and its normal for rookies like Bryant and Russell to have some struggles. There really isn't much you can do at this point. Perhaps when Soler, Olt, and La Stella return you could give guys like Russell and Bryant some days off?"
CHICubs,3c1b44,Tjagra,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:50:15 2015 UTC,"I think that LaStella is back on the DL. Olt isn't looking so great on his rehab assignment just yet. 10 games, 5 errors, 12 K's, 1 BB, .237 BA, .677 OPS. Hopefully, he'll get it together soon."

CHICubs,3bvy9a,Solleret,9,Thu Jul 2 16:30:18 2015 UTC,What I've seen of him in Des Moines he could use a little more time.  He doesn't look the same.  0 for 7 with 3 Ks since being in Iowa
CHICubs,3bvy9a,waltur_d,2,Thu Jul 2 19:33:19 2015 UTC,Sounds about right
CHICubs,3bvy9a,kingofnumber2,4,Fri Jul 3 19:12:09 2015 UTC,Sounds about the same to me... :/
CHICubs,3bvy9a,Cubsworldseries,3,Fri Jul 3 15:33:54 2015 UTC,"Does this mean Baxter's time as a cub is over? I like him a lot more than most of you guys do, and I could see another team signing him if he were to elect free agency.   I'm not completely delusional in thinking he is an everyday player, or even a for sure major leaguer at this point, but I like him for organizational depth, and he hasn't been the worst. I hope he elects to go to Iowa."

CHICubs,3bvrk6,Admiral_obvious13,10,Thu Jul 2 18:08:11 2015 UTC,Idk how he's doing it.  Do hitters know that he pretty much only throws 4 seam fastballs?
CHICubs,3bvrk6,zrk23,6,Thu Jul 2 17:17:17 2015 UTC,not easy to hit 98 mph
CHICubs,3bvrk6,Admiral_obvious13,3,Thu Jul 2 19:27:15 2015 UTC,"Sure, but major league hitters can usually hit it solidly over 30% of the time when they know it's coming."

CHICubs,3bvrk6,zrk23,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:06:51 2015 UTC,"i dont think thats true... its not like its gonna be in the middle of the plate everytime. i like this kind of pitching coming out of the bullpen. especially since none of our starters are fireballers. only arrieta tops 95 regularly. and its less dramatic then watching strop and rondon getting marmolish on those sliders... and he's just there to pitch one inning, doesnt really need much more than that."
CHICubs,3bvrk6,trippin113,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:33:10 2015 UTC,"He doesn't have a whole lot of control. You see the catcher set up inside and he ends up high and outside. Even motte doesn't know what he's throwing. His unpredictability gives him an edge. If you're the batter you know the next pitch is a fastball but it could be over the plate, it might be at your face. Scary stuff."

CHICubs,3bvrk6,Bersho,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:28:41 2015 UTC,I wonder this every time he pitches.  Throw a 2 seamer every now and again please.  I think the TV broadcast said he throws something like 97% 4 seamers

CHICubs,3bvrk6,NicCage420,4,Fri Jul 3 00:30:07 2015 UTC,It takes guys far longer to truly hit their old form after Tommy John than it does just to make it back to the show. Motte's now in his old form again.
CHICubs,3bvrk6,illini211,2,Thu Jul 2 18:52:04 2015 UTC,"I remember hating when he'd pitch against us. Then i somehow managed to not hear we signed him.... Needless to say i was hyped.   Also, i didn't realize his numbers were that good. My god. Great addition indeed."

CHICubs,3bwwyy,voidecho,4,Thu Jul 2 20:44:09 2015 UTC,"I know I'm biased, but I expect the commissioner to take some sort of action against the organization now, given that a high-ranking member of the front office was involved.    I believe Mozeliak when he says that he wasn't involved or aware of this, but they should at least lose a draft pick for this.  This is a really big deal and the MLB needs to show that when a front office cheats, there are consequences.    They shouldn't lose a ton unless it looks like this was a widespread thing (and again, I don't think there's any evidence to show that), but it should be significant. IMO a draft pick would be appropriate but I don't know too much about front office stuff, so maybe I'm over the line there."

CHICubs,3bvh9l,achap39,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:51:08 2015 UTC,"That seems crazy until you consider just how difficult a season sweep would have been for most of the history of the major leagues. From 1900 until 1961, the NL only had 8 teams and each team played each other 20-22 times per year. The first expansion saw that number of games decrease to 18, and the 1969 expansion saw the split into two divisions where teams had 18 games against division rivals and 12 games against teams from the other division. I have to imagine that it wasn't until the split to three divisions in the 90s that a season sweep became a realistic possibility."

CHICubs,3bvh9l,NeverSummerMountains,4,Thu Jul 2 19:13:56 2015 UTC,"defense has played pretty well, Arrieta is doing what Arrieta usually does, and the offense is actually scoring runs. Herrera took deGrom deep, that was cool"

CHICubs,3bvh9l,Badtz,3,Thu Jul 2 19:00:41 2015 UTC,Does anyone know why the Cubs have played so few day games this year? Is it because of the construction?
CHICubs,3bvh9l,Cubsfan5ever,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:59:47 2015 UTC,"It's because they negotiated to have that ordinance reduced. THey were only allowed so many night games before and now they're allowed more. Day games on the road are ""getaway"" games 99% of the time."
CHICubs,3bvh9l,slicebishybosh,2,Thu Jul 2 19:06:11 2015 UTC,I think it may also be because of games postponed due to rain. It feels like we've had a good amount of then this year.

CHICubs,3bvlid,NicCage420,3,Thu Jul 2 14:45:24 2015 UTC,"For comparison's sake, Eloy Jimenez signed for 2.8m and Gleyber Torres for 1.7 when they were two of the top IFAs available a couple years ago."
CHICubs,3bvlid,SwedishLovePump,3,Thu Jul 2 16:05:44 2015 UTC,I think the market has inflated a bit since more teams are blowing over their budget like the cubs did.
CHICubs,3bvlid,Admiral_obvious13,3,Thu Jul 2 17:19:18 2015 UTC,"A couple of observations that I've made looking at IFA news this morning:   Yonathan Sierra is signing for about twice as much as was predicted by Fangraphs. Also, what letter his name starts with is up for debate I guess. There are six players listed on that Fangraphs page that we haven't confirmed as signing yet. If the Cubs sign those players at their projected bonuses, that's another $4.7M before overage taxes. Eddy Julio Martinez isn't signing today and the pervading prediction of him going to the Dodgers is based on perceived spending ability rather than having a deal worked out in advance like you see with pretty much every non-Cuban IFA signing. While he'll be expensive, his bidding shouldn't reach Yoan Moncada territory. And the Dodgers stole the center fielder that we were supposed to sign (Starling Heredia) so it's only fair to return the favor."
CHICubs,3bvlid,SomeoneSomethingJr,3,Thu Jul 2 15:33:46 2015 UTC,"I'd love it if they went in high on Martinez...that would make my month.  We're hopefully not going to be getting many high draft picks the next decade, so need to take advantage of first round grade IFA's.    Like that we grabbed the highest rated catcher."

CHICubs,3bvlbk,EchoesOfSanity,3,Thu Jul 2 14:43:59 2015 UTC,"Like many other Cubs fans I thought both base runners should have been called out last night. I figured there were two ways to look at the play and either led to a double play.  First, if you go by the rule that two players cannot occupy the base at the same time, then the base should have been awarded to Tejada because the base should belong to the lead runner. This means Murphy would have been out and then Tejada was tagged by Montero when he ran past third; two outs. However, I believe that for this rule to work, both players need to be on the base and tagged out by a defender.   Second, if you go by the rule that one baserunner cannot pass another on the basepaths then Murphy should have been out for passing Tejada once Tejada moved to the opposite side of third. And again, Tejada would be out on Montero’s tag; two outs.   The ruling was an interpretation that I have not seen before outside of football when a player gives himself up to stop the play or avoid contact.    ""Tejada, once he passed the bag, he abandoned his efforts to be safe,"" crew chief Laz Diaz said. ""Once that happened, it was Murphy's bag. So when Murphy got tagged, he thought that Tejada was still on the bag, which he wasn't, he was two steps past it. So once he abandoned his efforts, Tejada's out and that's Murphy's bag.  ""He wasn't going home, he was on the other side of third base going toward the outfield. That's why he abandoned his effort, because he was on the other side of third base.""   At least the outcome wasn’t affected and the Cubs got out of the inning."
CHICubs,3bvlbk,yusuf69,6,Thu Jul 2 14:47:54 2015 UTC,"So I guess my question would be how a runner would signal giving up? Let's say Rizzo starts lazily walking to 2nd for an obvious force out so the third baseman doesn't even make the throw there, just throws to first. Does the walking signify giving up or can he just start running again? Obviously this is an unlikely situation, and the play yesterday worked out for us anyway, but I feel like the runner still running isn't really giving up on the situation."
CHICubs,3bvlbk,snowcone_wars,3,Thu Jul 2 15:13:34 2015 UTC,"I agree. I've seen guys give up when they are in rundowns, but they are never called out until they are tagged. Who gets credit for the put-out if they are already out when tagged? I think it should have been a double play last night."
CHICubs,3bvlbk,ViaChicago3441,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:18:52 2015 UTC,"It might have something to do with the direction Tejada turned, namely toward the mound.  Like, after running through first, turning towards the stands signals the play is over for the baserunner, but turning toward the direction of the mound means that the runner is still in play and off the bag and can be tagged out (actually happened to me once, never seen it in the pros though).  So, maybe since Tejada turned towards 2nd, and you can't actually run that direction, it was signaling that he had given up to the ump?  No idea, just throwing out a possible idea."
CHICubs,3bvlbk,dsalmon1449,2,Thu Jul 2 15:36:43 2015 UTC,"I suppose if Rizzo stopped running towards 2nd and headed back towards 1st or the dugout, that would signal he was giving up. Tejada wouldn't have been ""giving up"" if he didn't walk over the bag towards the outfield."
CHICubs,3bvlbk,gfcolli,2,Thu Jul 2 17:31:02 2015 UTC,"I Think the base only belongs to the lead runner when both are on the base. Since Murphy advanced to third while Tejada was in the run down, I don't think this can apply. I think because Tejada was off the base, it was technically an open base which Murphy advanced to, thus granting him the right to that base. Tejada then retreated in an attempt to not be out at the plate, trying to get back to the base, but at that point it was no longer his. Thus Murphy being tagged while on a base that is his (safe) and Tejada out in left field being tagged (out).  At first I thought both should be out based on it being Tejada's base, but it kind of doesn't make sense to give it to Tejada, since he went back to the base when he should have been out."

CHICubs,3bv9at,RyanTheCubsSTH,5,Thu Jul 2 14:06:56 2015 UTC,"His value is best as a reliever. He was converted to a reliever since he lacked a true plus third pitch, which is what you need to be a starter. Because of that, he is allowed to air out that 4-seamer to 94-96 and use that pretty nasty curveball as his 2 strike pitch. Notice when he is off, he isn't commanding the fastball OR the curveball is flat. He is only throwing any type of third pitch (his slider) at 11.4% of the time. His fastball is aveaging 94.6 mph and is being used 54.7% of the time. When he was a Ranger, and when he was in the Cubs system he tried a changeup but I guess it wasn't working for him since he hasn't attempted one in 2 years."

Not sure if they show on TV but the Cubs put on a huge shift for Lucas Duda though every time he bats, Kris Bryant is basically between 2B and 1B. There's literally no one on the left side of the infield. Found it curious that the Mets didn't try to get him to square up and lay down a bunt down the 3rd base line at least once, especially since their offense have been totally anemic so far this series."

CHICubs,3btvzn,jp611,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:56:21 2015 UTC,"Ross has 24 PAs against lefties, just like Montero, so they do that some. The problem is that the Cubs never play against lefties. I think they're last in the majors in PAs against lefties by a lot. The way I think of it is that Montero essentially gets a scheduled day off when Lester is pitching, and if Lester can perform to expectations the lack of offense will matter less."

CHICubs,3bvee0,MeanKids,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:50:13 2015 UTC,We need consistent hitting too........ and we can get pitching next free agency
CHICubs,3bvee0,voidecho,6,Thu Jul 2 14:32:56 2015 UTC,"I want to see if Roach pitches again and how he does before we start trading.  I'd rather just wait until the offseason to add Zimmerman or Price without having to give up prospects.   Zimmerman/Price, Lester, Arrieta, Hammel and Hendricks would be a good five.  Then, next year if we're really doing well we start trading off the prospects plus Hendricks to get a good young pitcher we can control."
CHICubs,3bvee0,TugboatThomas,5,Thu Jul 2 14:18:40 2015 UTC,"Hitting might be nice but we might already have hitting. We need more than a bat to be a playoff series winning team. We need people like Baez and soler to come back and get some production out of players we already have. We need another arm, we need Soriano to come out and be a nice bullpen piece.   Next year we'll have soler, Baez, schwarber, and probably another starter on the team. THAT will be a playoff team. Just enjoy what we have going this year and try not to ruin it by trading away people we might need."
CHICubs,3bvee0,dickcomments,-1,Thu Jul 2 15:05:45 2015 UTC,"People like Baez?!?    The dude NEVER provided anything of substance at the major league level.    Ever.    Yes, he was having a good run at Iowa but so are/were Lake and Szcrur and look how that translated to the majors.   No, we need hitting.   We need a CF that doesn't suck at leadoff (or hitting in general). As much as I love Russell, we need a second baseman that can bat above .250 for the season.  We need Bryant to hit better than .240 on the road as well start hitting during night games (look at the splits, he SUCKS batting at night).  St Louis has 5 batting over .280 (2 over .300), Pittsburgh has 3 over .280 (1 over .300).... and what do we have?  We have 1 player hitting over .280 - the god that is Anthony Rizzo, and even he has has gone into a slump that has seen his average drop from about .340 to .295.  At this point, he is keeping us alive.  As goes ability to reach base so goes the Cubs ability to win.  And while I'm ranting, this #wearegood shit needs to stop.  Yes, we ARE good but who wants to be good? We want to OWN the division. We want there to be none better than us. If they stick with #wearegood it will quickly become #nothisyearagain.  Maybe people who haven't seen a world series in a century are ok with good, but truly competitive people don't rest at good. Shit. They don't rest at best either. They want to even out do themselves. Seriously, talk about setting the bar low and continuing to trip over it.  Down vote me all you want, while we have come a long way from the suck that this team has been for the last god knows how long, we still have a LONG, LONG way to go."

I was talking to a friend, and I think the Cubs should LOOK at Jason Grilli. Maybe not a closer, but he is putting up decent numbers. 2.41 FIP/3.33 xFIP. 11.53 k/9 29.9 k% and a 7.9 BB%. Because he also is under contract for 2016 at $3.5m with a 2017 team option at $3m (.2 buyout), I thought why not. Grilli for a nice young pitching prospect (he mentioned Jason Hursch) for Billy Mckinnley? Yeah I'd maybe consider that. but thoughts?"

CHICubs,3bsiwx,YNWAintheUSA,15,Thu Jul 2 02:29:32 2015 UTC,Crazy thing is if Bryant didn't make that out they probably get Rizzo at home there
CHICubs,3bsiwx,TheLostWeasley,3,Thu Jul 2 02:29:24 2015 UTC,then Bryant gets to third and Castro gets the RBI still
CHICubs,3bsiwx,Hibachi4242,3,Thu Jul 2 02:33:30 2015 UTC,I was saying it would've been based loaded 1 out. Corners would come in and Murphy probably would've came home on Castro's grounder and got Rizz. Lots of what ifs haha
CHICubs,3bsiwx,TheLostWeasley,2,Thu Jul 2 02:39:39 2015 UTC,good point. i forgot it would have been a force at home

CHICubs,3bu0ic,voidecho,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:30:15 2015 UTC,"I mean he's a shortstop. If he's got any type of speed, he can eat hitting off of sharp grounders in the hole and bloop singles."

CHICubs,3bt3ar,bryanno4444,2,Thu Jul 2 02:35:50 2015 UTC,My guess is that he can throw that out of the bullpen since he was moved over and can do more max effort stuff.

You won't be able to get over to the bleachers without a bleacher ticket, and all tickets are scanned when entering/exiting the bleachers so you wouldn't be able to use a bleacher ticket for a different day.    Also keep in mind that Sunday is a day game coming off a night game.  They may not even take batting practice."
CHICubs,3bs69q,LEDN7,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:36:58 2015 UTC,"Oh shit. That's like the worst possible news I could get. Thanks for the accurate info though. Huge bummer, I really wanted to catch bp  What's the chance they do take bp on Sunday?"
CHICubs,3bs69q,LEDN7,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:39:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly sometimes they do and sometimes they don't.  It depends on how late the game goes the night before, the weather, how they are feeling in the morning/hungover after saturday night, the condition of the field, and if Joe Maddon wants them to."
CHICubs,3bs69q,Jollyman21,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:42:16 2015 UTC,Damn. Do they let anyone know in advance? I'd be super sad if I couldn't make bp

Times are approximate and subject to change without prior notification and at the discretion of either team. Gates open two hours prior to game time.  Hope this helps!

I see the Cubs and Sox as two siblings duking it out from time to see who is better  at baseball but who come together for football season. Alternatively, I see the Cubs on a holy war to stop the evil Cards. Am I missing something here?"

CHICubs,3bpek7,Sparx7,0,Wed Jul 1 04:07:30 2015 UTC,Why does everyone hate him? I have read some of his stuff and liked outside of his writing for the mothership

Jessie Rogers wrote that recent article about the Cards showing the young Cubs how to play.  Jessie Rogers is extremely unprofessional, spreads ridiculous trade rumors, quotes Curt Schilling like that guy also isn't a complete doofus, he has no understanding of sabermetrics (look at that article on the Cards I linked, where he just says Maddon is good for 4-5 WAR because of the ""tone he sets"" — WTF?), he's a muck raker, he's got no business being a beat writer for this team.   Simply put, he isn't the sharpest tool in the shed. There are many, higher quality places to get your Cubs news.

Yes, David Ross, the W matters, but the reason you haven't been getting many has a lot to do with not scoring runs.  Edit: Maybe our guys should just not interact with reporters on social media. Seems to only have downside to it."
CHICubs,3bpek7,FrenchFryBurger,-4,Wed Jul 1 19:33:24 2015 UTC,Considering 5 of the 7 games have been L's I think Roger's tweet has more validity than Ross'.  Maybe Ross should focus less on twitter and more on becoming more capable with a bat in his hands.
CHICubs,3bpek7,Restroom406,8,Wed Jul 1 02:59:01 2015 UTC,"Have to go with Ross on this one, a W is a W. Be nice to see them step out of this slump."
CHICubs,3bpek7,FrenchFryBurger,-1,Wed Jul 1 03:19:05 2015 UTC,I agree that it was awesome to get the W last night but that does not just erase the five losses before it.  All I'm saying is there is validity to Rogers' tweet.
CHICubs,3bpek7,Solleret,7,Wed Jul 1 10:55:24 2015 UTC,"Maybe Ross should focus less on twitter and more on becoming more capable with a bat in his hands.   He's a back up catcher. None of them can hit, that's not what they are on the team for.   Having him be Lester's caddy is another issue altogether but it's absolutely silly when people say he needs to focus on hitting more.  Also, Miggy is better when rested: http://wrigleyville.locals.baseballprospectus.com/2015/05/19/fresher-miguel-montero-making-trade-look-brilliant/  Edit:  Here's a quick wOBA ranking for NL catchers with less than 75 AB's, but more than 25. These are probably comparable backup catchers but I'm tired and this is quick & dirty:   Travis d'Arnaud: .374 Tucker Barnhart .351 Jose Lobaton .321 Jordan Pacheco .301 Chris Stewart .292 J.T. Realmuto .275 David Ross .258 Anthony Recker .248 Tuffy Gosewisch .243 Devin Mesoraco .242 Carlos Ruiz .241 A.J. Ellis .238 Tony Cruz .220 Johnny Monell .177 Jeff Mathis .155 Austin Hedges .131   To give you context, .320 is average. This means everyone but the top 3 are well below average, with most backup catchers in the league being plain awful.  Ross has a great arm and is a decent pitch framer and gets montero rest when needed and gets clutch hits often enough that he isn't a complete wash.    I am so sick and tired of reading about how Ross can't hit. Hitting isn't his job. And one of the things he is here for is being a veteran player who feels comfortable speaking up against cherry-picked clickbait ""stats"" like this. That's got to count for something because these guys all read social media and a W is a W.   We can score 162 runs in a whole season, and as long as everyone else scores 0 against us — who cares? That is Ross's point."
CHICubs,3bpek7,Rearden_Steel,2,Wed Jul 1 06:03:32 2015 UTC,Fantastic post.  I'm going to save this one for all the times a hear bellyaching about how bad Ross is.
CHICubs,3bpek7,Solleret,2,Wed Jul 1 13:01:55 2015 UTC,"I just like looking at catcher averages in general and thinking of Kyle Schwarber.   He's probably going to be platooned with Ross and Montero when he gets called up, since they are signed through 2016/17 respectively. Taking the time to groom and mentor him for that extremely difficult positions going to pay huge dividends because he will be leading all those offensive charts by miles."
CHICubs,3bpek7,callthebluff,2,Wed Jul 1 14:23:51 2015 UTC,"This means everyone but the top 3 are well below average, with most backup catchers in the league being plain awful.   d'Arnaud is a starter, he was hurt so he fell into your rough cut.  Barnhart and Lobaton both are having their best year ever (small sample size disclaimer).  So in short, back up catchers are even worse at hitting than your list even makes them look."

CHICubs,3bp9w2,stackshot,2,Wed Jul 1 01:46:24 2015 UTC,What would you think about an extreme shake-up to the lineup? I remember a couple of years ago when Castro was struggling we dropped him from the 2 spot to #7 and his number jumped overnight. What if we make drastic changes with other players?
CHICubs,3bp9w2,jonsie19,3,Wed Jul 1 02:02:00 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with Starlin going to 7th or 9th. That's what he's hit like this season, and nothing is changing with him batting 4th.  He's the one who has been the most out-of-place this season.  Fowler will have to get hot soon in order to deserve his #1 spot in the lineup, but it's not like the Cubs have another leadoff option that makes sense."

CHICubs,3bo7wo,zdruck07,3,Wed Jul 1 00:55:44 2015 UTC,1st time Hendricks pitched 6 innings since june 2.

CHICubs,3bo7wo,an_abyss_in_motion,2,Wed Jul 1 00:52:38 2015 UTC,Soler may need some more time in AAA.  0-2 with two K's
CHICubs,3bo7wo,voidecho,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:52:14 2015 UTC,Schwarber didn't have a good start in AAA either. Soler has been missing baseball for about a month. Let him get back into the groove of things.
CHICubs,3bo7wo,FxStryker,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:54:58 2015 UTC,"That's kind of my point.  They're talking about him coming up Saturday.  Hopefully he's doing well by then, but if not I hope they leave him down until he starts to get hot."
CHICubs,3bo7wo,voidecho,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:56:46 2015 UTC,I mean it's Tuesday. He should have a plenty of time to get the motor running smooth again. It's not like he should have a stint in the minors. He is only allowed 20 days in rehab.
CHICubs,3bo7wo,FxStryker,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:14:43 2015 UTC,Good thinking.  I kinda forgot he hasn't been on the field for a month.
CHICubs,3bo7wo,zdruck07,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:56:22 2015 UTC,He was 0fer yesterday too.  Ouch.  That's not good to hear.
CHICubs,3bo7wo,zdruck07,3,Wed Jul 1 00:52:35 2015 UTC,Can the top of our lineup get something done?  Please?
CHICubs,3bo7wo,zdruck07,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:52:03 2015 UTC,It'd be nice to get one more inning from Hendricks.
CHICubs,3bo7wo,gwats,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:48:02 2015 UTC,Kyle is showing some great mental toughness this outing! I love to see this kid do well
CHICubs,3bo7wo,bgreene777,0,Wed Jul 1 00:47:53 2015 UTC,"So, pull Hendricks now?  Or do we leave him for the 7th?  I say pull him out.  He's had a great outing, time to let the bullpen do their stuff."
CHICubs,3bo7wo,zdruck07,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:47:17 2015 UTC,He made it through the heart of their order.  I'd probably leave him out one more.

CHICubs,3bo7wo,Sparx7,0,Wed Jul 1 00:23:58 2015 UTC,Niese would be a good addition to our rotation.
CHICubs,3bo7wo,jp611,2,Wed Jul 1 00:20:28 2015 UTC,Mmmmmmmmnope.
CHICubs,3bo7wo,zdruck07,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:21:53 2015 UTC,"Don't let tonight's game be the reason you want Niese.  There are reasons he could be a serviceable 4th/5th starter, but doing well against this ineffective lineup tonight shouldn't hold sway."
CHICubs,3bo7wo,stackshot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:21:33 2015 UTC,I'm not.  He comes cheap (prospect wise) and it gives us control.  We need an upgrade over Wada/roach/Wood/etc and Niese would be a nice pitcher to slot in at that 5 spot.
CHICubs,3bo7wo,jp611,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:23:25 2015 UTC,I'm totally game for giving Roach another shot before we do anything.
CHICubs,3bo7wo,voidecho,2,Wed Jul 1 00:25:52 2015 UTC,"I'd rather try to make the playoffs.  AAAA players at our 5th spot isn't a way to compete.  We need an upgrade at SP, Niese is a solid upgrade there and would come at a low cost prospect wise."
CHICubs,3bo7wo,jp611,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:33:43 2015 UTC,Cubs are eighth in ERA.  I'd say we need hitting more than pitching..which should be improved by Soler and Olt.
CHICubs,3bo7wo,voidecho,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:42:45 2015 UTC,Agreed.  He didn't exactly have an easy debut.

Games like these really go to show he has quality stuff, give him a chance to figure it out.  He's only in his second year now, it's not like he's a seven year veteran who's made mistakes his entire career or anything."
CHICubs,3bo7wo,snowcone_wars,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:15:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  When he's on, he's REALLY on.  It's just a matter of consistency.  We just need to give him some time, he oughtta come around."

CHICubs,3bo7wo,jp611,4,Wed Jul 1 00:09:32 2015 UTC,Hendricks has looked good.  Gotta get some runs with top of lineup coming up next inning.
CHICubs,3bo7wo,jp611,2,Wed Jul 1 00:06:33 2015 UTC,Announcers mentioned that we haven't homered in 5 or 6 games.  Anyone have the Cubs' SLG % over that span of games because I don't recall a lot of doubles over that time frame either.  edit: haven't != have
CHICubs,3bo7wo,Snailz,3,Wed Jul 1 00:04:57 2015 UTC,"11 doubles in last 7 days.  Cobra and Deno are slugging around .500, everyone else is down near .300 or lower."

CHICubs,3bo7wo,zdruck07,3,Wed Jul 1 00:07:36 2015 UTC,Len just said longest homerless stretch since 2012

CHICubs,3bojyy,thejazzmarauder,12,Tue Jun 30 21:43:29 2015 UTC,"Great minor league hitters are notorious for running extremely high BABIPs, even if such performance is not predictive of major league results. They are overmatching their competition and thus hitting the ball on the screws almost every time. Almora's low BABIP through his minor league career should thus not just be viewed as likely for regression to average, but if he really is going to be a productive major league hitter he needs to be above average, perhaps by a significant amount. His K rate is down and BB is up, which is a very good sign, but his BB rate is still well below average and it's not actually that productive to trade K's for weak contact. I agree with the gist of what you're saying in this post, but I do not share your guarded optimism until Almora actually shows the hitting skills he allegedly possesses."
CHICubs,3bojyy,gniketan,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:21:02 2015 UTC,"That's an understandable stance and you make reasonable points.    Ultimately, I'd rather have a guy who's working on improving the quality of his contact than just making contact. Almora's K rate is so damn low that he could sacrifice something there in favor of power and be OK. I still think he's a guy who could eventually post .280/.340/.400 at the ML level without using too much imagination. At 21, he's still going to fill out, and hopefully, continue to adjust his approach."
CHICubs,3bojyy,PeterBernsteinSucks,2,Tue Jun 30 23:06:28 2015 UTC,That's probably the biggest knock against he kid. He can make contact with anything which is killing him. His BABIP or whatever is so low because he is able to put the bat on the ball.  He isn't making good solid contact because pitchers can throw him junk pitches close to the zone and he will make weak contact and make an out. If he is ever going to make it to MLB he is going to have to learn to wait for his pitch instead of just putting the ball in play just to put it in play.   If he can make that major adjustment than he had a shot to make the bigs as a regular but until then he will be at most a 4th outfielder in for defense.
CHICubs,3bojyy,Gimmie_Dat_Stream,2,Tue Jun 30 23:45:26 2015 UTC,"Gotta post highlight videos of his catches. You can find a lot of em here  Dude is a HS bat, it's gonna take a lot longer for him to develop then a college bat. People need to be patient with him."
CHICubs,3bojyy,zdruck07,2,Tue Jun 30 22:50:12 2015 UTC,"It looks like his defense is in a really good place right now based on those videos, and you're right, he's crazy young for someone in his position, he just needs some more time to get offense down."
CHICubs,3bojyy,iam2eeyore,2,Wed Jul 1 04:38:17 2015 UTC,"Judging a minor league player's performance at AA isn't always easy because we don't know what they're working on. Each player is given an agenda to work on. Almora might be working on lowering his K's and increasing his BB's which might lower his isolated power. Almora might be altering his swing in order to make any contact at all which could cause weak contact. If that's a part of the plan then it isn't a problem. Weak contact, as I understand it, could be a part of a low BABIP. He's young. As he gains strength the power will increase, especially if he's working out."
CHICubs,3bojyy,jmr33090,2,Tue Jun 30 23:39:26 2015 UTC,"Huh, I was just having this conversation in another thread. I'm gonna compile my points and hope it makes sense.  Almora is only 21 and is projected as a perennial gold glover and as a plus hitter as far as average. Most years his average has been between .280 and .310 as one of the youngest guys in his league every year. This year his walk rate is up pretty significantly which is probably why his average is down. They're teaching him a little more plate patience. He has plenty of time to develop that plate patience while getting his average back up.  (The following was in response to someone pointing out his fairly low AA stats between last year and this year)  At the same time tho, you can see that he's been better this year, slightly as far as average (.234 vs .246), but very significantly in OBP (.250 vs .293). He's having the same issue as Castro has had in that he has a hard time laying off the low and out pitch. But he's got a lot more time to work on it than Castro does and if he can have the same type of improvement the next few years as he's showing this year vs last, he could be a very effective player by age 24-25. Edit: And he is 3.1 years younger than the average AA player. So he's hitting against pitchers with far more experience. He really should be struggling somewhat given that difference."

CHICubs,3bn469,SomeoneSomethingJr,7,Tue Jun 30 15:35:53 2015 UTC,Am I the only one wondering how Almora got  chosen for anything?
CHICubs,3bn469,Sparx7,5,Tue Jun 30 16:07:50 2015 UTC,He's a known commodity with USA baseball that can really go get it in CF. Seems like a decent guy to have on a squad like this even without any bat to speak of.  But I think the biggest factor is that they've been familiar with him for years.
CHICubs,3bn469,THEriot2,2,Tue Jun 30 17:05:30 2015 UTC,I'm just gonna dream that one day hes gonna figure it out and life is good we have our CF for the future that we haven't had in years
CHICubs,3bn469,Sparx7,3,Tue Jun 30 17:06:15 2015 UTC,"It's getting grim, but on the bright side, he has improved his walk rate and cut his K rate this year. Maybe he can be salvaged as defensive guy who hits 9th. The lineup could be solid enough in 2-3 years that they won't need another big bat."
CHICubs,3bn469,Asmodeus10,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:31:00 2015 UTC,Yeah I mean  at the very least could transition into a solid late inning defensive replacement/pinch runner.  We dont need beasts at every spot but if schwarber works at C and bryant sticks at 3b we can handle him in the 9 hole
CHICubs,3bn469,Sparx7,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:37:46 2015 UTC,"And if one of those guys ends up in LF, they're going to need a good defensive CF to help out."

CHICubs,3bmz92,Asmodeus10,7,Tue Jun 30 16:21:52 2015 UTC,You could probably add Greinke to that list since he will probably opt out of his current contract.

CHICubs,3bmz92,Sparx7,6,Tue Jun 30 16:42:35 2015 UTC,"IMO, he's not as good as the first tier, but slightly above most of those guys in the second tier, largely because he's the youngest of the group at 27.   Also, consider this:  Leake at GABP (career): 496 IP, 4.39 ERA, 242 ER, 1.34 WHIP.  Leake away from GABP: 496.1 IP, 3.54 ERA, 195 ER,  1.24 WHIP"

Out of anyone likely to move, I'd like Cueto the most so that's why I listed him. Second for me is Kazmir (Price and Zimmermann won't move), and that's without considering what we'd have to give up so he could be a very enticing option as well. I'm a big Brett Anderson guy, too, but I don't think he'd move unless the Dodgers grab another pitcher (not unlikely), and I don't want to give up much for him."
CHICubs,3bmz92,Bob_Lob_Law_Law_Blog,9,Tue Jun 30 18:39:29 2015 UTC,"yeah, we don't want him. It'll be confusing to go ""Strop! Hammel time"" and ""Strop! Hamels time"" we need a pitcher who doesn't intrude on another's nickname territory like that."
CHICubs,3bmz92,wbl7w6,3,Tue Jun 30 16:42:14 2015 UTC,"I know I'm against the popular opinion in this thread, but I would take that deal. Hamels through 2018 is a solid trade considering the Cubs' current competitive level. I like Schwarber a lot, but I think he's out playing himself right now and his value right now is inflated. Sell high."

What's the point in giving away a prospect or two to have a pitcher for half a season, when we could wait until next year when we'll (hopefully) be legitimate World Series contenders, and get someone without giving away a Schwarber or a Baez"
CHICubs,3bmz92,THEriot2,8,Tue Jun 30 16:14:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, but Hamels would be for a lot longer than half a season. His contract runs through 2018."
CHICubs,3bmz92,jmr33090,10,Tue Jun 30 17:15:19 2015 UTC,Worth noting that his contract is a pretty good bargain for a pitcher of his caliber as well.
CHICubs,3bmz92,stackshot,3,Tue Jun 30 17:30:16 2015 UTC,"Very true. I wouldn't want to give up Schwarber still, but if they were interested in a package of Wood + 2 of the following: Mckinney, Edwards, Almora, Vogelbach, or Torres, I'd definitely be interested."
CHICubs,3bmz92,jmr33090,5,Tue Jun 30 17:43:32 2015 UTC,I just don't think Almora/Vogelbach carry much value to other teams in a deal.  Vogelbach looks like a DH without 20 HR power. Almora looks like a 5th outfielder. Let's not pretend they carry much weight in a deal.
CHICubs,3bmz92,stackshot,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:18:40 2015 UTC,"I think you're underestimating Vogelbach's power and Almora's defensive abilities (he's projected as a perennial gold glove candidate), add in that he's only 21 and I'd argue that Almora has as much value as anyone on my list."
CHICubs,3bmz92,jmr33090,2,Tue Jun 30 20:30:17 2015 UTC,"I think Vogelbach's power speaks for itself: http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=vogelb000dan  Last year, in a full season at A+ with 650 plate appearances, he hit only 16 HR and 28 doubles. That is just waaay too low when all he can give a team is his bat.  This year, Vogelbach has even less power with 5 HR in over 300 PAs. He already has no future in the NL, but even AL teams will become wary if he doesn't fix that.  As for Almora, being projected as a ""gold glover"" doesn't mean a thing if you won't hit enough to make the roster. A defensive replacement doesn't carry much weight."
CHICubs,3bmz92,stackshot,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:46:36 2015 UTC,"Power is generally the last thing to develop for a hitter. A lot of 25-30 hr guys had numbers like Vogelbach's in the minors at age 22.   Almora is projected as a plus hitter as far as average, and, once again, he's only 21. Most years his average has been between .280 and .310 as one of the youngest guys in his league every year. This year his walk rate is up pretty significantly which is probably why his average is down. They're teaching him a little more plate patience. He has plenty of time to develop that plate patience while getting his average back up. Oh, and did I mention he's only 21?

CHICubs,3bmz92,jmr33090,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:48:44 2015 UTC,"Almora's 400 total plate appearances in AA:  .240 / .277 OBP / .625 OPS / 4 HR / 4 SB / 17 walks  I appreciate that Almora is young, and I know that he has plenty of time to develop, but there aren't words to accurately depict the failing in that offensive production.  I'm not asking for a lot, but when you see a .277 OBP attached to a player without power/speed, you get understandably concerned for the offensive upside.  He may very well turn things around, but at the moment it's hard to not cringe at everything he has done at the plate the past two years."
CHICubs,3bmz92,THEriot2,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:59:40 2015 UTC,"At the same time tho, you can see that he's been better this year, slightly as far as average (.234 vs .246), but very significantly in OBP (.250 vs .293).

CHICubs,3bnjpw,CrossBowGuy237,6,Tue Jun 30 17:26:04 2015 UTC,Todd Frazier definitely deserves the 3rd base starting spot. KB might be picked as a reserve tho. If anything - vote Altuve to get Omar Infante and other Royals out.

CHICubs,3blhi8,Tjagra,3,Tue Jun 30 04:40:53 2015 UTC,"Just some observation:  Alcantara has really slide since his debut last year. I wonder what his future here is.  Lake always seems to do better in the minors. Maybe it's a lack of playing time, maybe it's something else but I wonder if he's going to be a AAAA guy.  Almora. I've always thought this, and don't shoot me, but I don't see what everyone thinks is so special about him. I find it hard to believe he's out future CF."
CHICubs,3blhi8,dickcomments,2,Tue Jun 30 04:57:09 2015 UTC,Maybe they can shift Jimenez to CF if he continues to tear it up

CHICubs,3blhi8,Banglayna,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:15:48 2015 UTC,"I think Almora used to be our future CF. Unless he turns shit around... he's young, it could happen. It won't be the last time a hyped prospect doesn't pan out."

CHICubs,3blhi8,zrk23,2,Tue Jun 30 19:02:53 2015 UTC,"Who knows.  They're both young for the levels they're already at.    Torres is 18.6.  If he went to High A he'd be over two years younger than any of our other highly rated prospects.  Tseng is the youngest at High A at 20.8 years.    McKinney is only 20.9...that's younger than Almora.  That's 3-4 years younger than our average highly rated AAA prospect.  McKinney's already been promoted once this year.    My guess is Torres has a better chance to go to Myrtle Beach than McKinney to Iowa, but I'm definitely not an expert.    Edit...more info."
CHICubs,3blhi8,voidecho,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:29:17 2015 UTC,Mckinney no says Theo hoyer. Already young for AA. Don't want to move hI'm too fast.
CHICubs,3blbbs,kingofdanger,5,Tue Jun 30 03:42:42 2015 UTC,"This makes me appreciate Len so much more. He takes his job seriously and when it's showtime, he's personal about it but still keeps things professional because of how much of a fan of the game he is. He doesn't become hypercritical about the team, even in the toughest of times, and that's something that anyone can appreciate. He'll always try to find a positive in an otherwise negative situation."
CHICubs,3blbbs,Faskis,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:25:59 2015 UTC,Len gets dumped on by the fan base too much. He clearly loves his job and gives decent stats. I think he works best with a guy like Bob Brenly who wasn't afraid to comment on the team and could play off Len's straight man style much better than JD.
CHICubs,3blbbs,captainbuttercream,2,Tue Jun 30 14:18:08 2015 UTC,I love Len but I really like JD too and the combination of them makes watching cubs games very enjoyable to me. JD has a weird sense of humor but he cracks me up
CHICubs,3blbbs,AMumm5,0,Tue Jun 30 19:55:53 2015 UTC,wait. Len gets dumped on? He's very good. The only complaints i ever hear about are JD.   The JD complaints can be well founded. He's average at best and when compared to Brenly he looks pretty bad.
CHICubs,3blbbs,kazuo316,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:12:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, head over to the Cubs message board. It seems like 75% of the community is anti-Len. I think JD is perfectly serviceable but I preferred Bob."

I hate, hate, hate losing to the hackin' Cards as much as the next guy, but we all knew this week was going to be hard going into it. We split a tough series with the Dodgers and got swept by the Cards. It stinks, but there's still tons of baseball left and we're still in a great position to make things happen.  I think back on previous years where we go into a week like this without a chance and only our prayers. We lost some really close games against really good teams. I'm proud of these guys. We'll get there.  Remember at the end of Star Wars the Death Star gets blown up!"

CHICubs,3bievm,Sparx7,4,Mon Jun 29 14:45:27 2015 UTC,I'm really not sure if the baseball world can handle that we now have rally bucket flair!!! Good things are coming
CHICubs,3bievm,Sparx7,8,Mon Jun 29 19:52:42 2015 UTC,"Some additional good news.  YTD our opponents' weighted average win % has been 51.5%.  For the remainder of the year the weighted average win % is 49.6%.  Basically, we've been battling on average 83.4 win teams and for the rest of the year we'll be battling 78.7 win teams.    Just need to beat them now."
CHICubs,3bievm,Cpt_Hook,3,Mon Jun 29 14:49:25 2015 UTC,"Lol after the series against the Brewers and the Mets, this means basically nothing to me.   Just being the devil's advocate 👍"
CHICubs,3bievm,nlmuvaney,3,Mon Jun 29 18:32:01 2015 UTC,"Losing to the Cardinals sucks. Getting swept by them is one of the worst things imaginable. I was at last night's game, and there were quite a few Cardinal fans saying how the Cubs are gonna be fine this year.   I thought about it and realized the Cubs don't need to be a dominant team this year. Hell, we just need to be a few games above .500 (which we are) and we're right where everyone expected our ceiling to be. Our team is incredibly young, so this year is about building experience and getting through some growing pains.   I know people make fun of the Cubs for saying this almost every year, but next year will be our year. Bryant, Russell, and Soler will have a ton of experience. We'll likely add a high quality arm to the rotation. We might even add a quality bat for LF. Plus, Schwarber will have had a lot of catching done at AAA.  This sweep could turn out to be a good thing cause it'll teach the youngins how to get back out there and keep their head up."
CHICubs,3bievm,achap39,3,Mon Jun 29 19:38:26 2015 UTC,"...so getting swept by the Cards might have been the best thing to happen to this team. Confused? Hear me out.   Even if they took 2 of 3, they'd still be 8.5 games back. That's close to 'not gonna catch them' territory, but still close enough to where there might be a bit of a panic move to try and close the gap.   As this roster sits right now (especially with guys coming back from injury), they're going to be a contender for the one-game Wild Card. Let's just embrace that, hope to make a couple minor moves at the deadline (Haren? Tyson Ross?) and keep exceeding expectations.   Like /u/nlmuvaney said, this wasn't supposed to be a 90-win team.   Who is the Cubs' competition for that WC spot? The Pirates and Giants. That's it. It's not like other years, where there were a half dozen other teams hanging around that last playoff spot. All they need to do is be better than ONE of those teams, and this team makes it to a place almost no one thought possible in March.   Yes, there are going to be frustrating points when the younger guys struggle and make dumb errors. But for the first time in ANY of our lifetimes, this isn't a 1-2 year window of success.   There's still 88 games left...and that's just in year ONE of what we'll get to watch for the next 6-7 years."

CHICubs,3bievm,hursticles,4,Mon Jun 29 14:27:46 2015 UTC,"True, but this month was a ridiculous schedule and they're going to make it out .500 or just above/below."
CHICubs,3bievm,SwedishLovePump,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:03:07 2015 UTC,"according to Pythagorean W/L, our actual record is only 1 game better than it ""should"" be, so we really haven't been doing that much better based on luck than our expected talent level."
CHICubs,3bievm,hursticles,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:30:37 2015 UTC,"We figured the bullpen would be a strength going into the season. The Ramirez/Strop/Rondon trio was lights out last year, and we only added Motte, another quality arm. The Ramirez loss obviously hurt, and Rondon's out-of-nowhere season seemed destined for a slight regression, not to mention bullpen arms are so volatile year-to-year, but the quality numbers over June shouldn't surprise anybody, all things considered."

If not, why not wait until next year when the Dodgers can't bid?    Edit...fingers still crossed we'll steal Martinez or Fox."

CHICubs,3beta4,nakolas,14,Sun Jun 28 15:58:32 2015 UTC,I looked at his stats backwards and forwards (backwards didnt help much) and other than that he had a FIP below 4 in 5 of the 6 previous seasons it's hard to get excited. Especially given his contract (9M next season). I'd rather spend that 9M on a better pitcher in free agency.

CHICubs,3beta4,chilango2,6,Sun Jun 28 19:23:34 2015 UTC,"To everyone who is questioning this - it's clearly a move to get some pitching depth. Jacob Turner is still injured, I'm not sure what Wada's status is, and it's clear that Maddon doesn't want Wood back in the rotation. The Cubs need a back of the rotation starter. This isn't a trade deadline blockbuster, it's trying to fix a hole."

CHICubs,3beta4,voidecho,2,Sun Jun 28 21:47:44 2015 UTC,"I'd rather stick with Roach.  He did exactly what he does, got a ton of ground balls.  The Cards just found the holes with half of them.  They had a BABIP of almost .500 against him.  Heck, the lead off single that started their rally in the fourth was a routine groundout to Russell if we weren't in our first shift of the whole year.  Get that lead off out and the inning is different."
CHICubs,3beta4,jawieging,11,Sun Jun 28 22:32:27 2015 UTC,"Is it me or are the Mets/Mets-affiliated media salivating over the idea of fleecing the Cubs of top line prospects for their castaways and think just because they are in New York City that they will eventually get what they want? This seems to pop up every few weeks and to be honest, unless we are getting something quality from another team for any of our guys/prospects, I'd (personally) rather keep what we have and see what the winter free agency market looks like and give our young starters another year to get even better, then react."
CHICubs,3beta4,Sephiroth007,3,Sun Jun 28 20:25:12 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have the Cubs go out and get someone like Kazmir from the A's. It will cost more, but he's been solid this year."

CHICubs,3beta4,Loop_Within_A_Loop,4,Sun Jun 28 17:50:21 2015 UTC,"Okay, you answered my question. Because if he had all the right stuff, but coudln't string it together consistently, we could have Jake Arrieta 2.0 on our hands.  But if he just doesn't have it, not sure how much our pitching coach can do. In that case, I hope we pass."
CHICubs,3beta4,hfgutyl,3,Sun Jun 28 18:06:04 2015 UTC,"He used to have decent-solid stuff, and when he did, it would usually be going well.

CHICubs,3beta4,Kaner_95,9,Sun Jun 28 19:48:05 2015 UTC,MRW someone on the Mets sub wants McKinney or Vogelbach for him
CHICubs,3beta4,JZobel,6,Sun Jun 28 17:46:36 2015 UTC,"Can we stop acting like other teams are asking for Theo to sell his first born son anytime they dare want any prospects for proven major league talent?   Doesn't mean we should necessarily do the deal, but don't act incredulous whenever other teams don't want to give up their players for chump change."
CHICubs,3beta4,TandBusquets,3,Mon Jun 29 00:31:12 2015 UTC,Jon Niese for Baez is rumoured. The mets are the ones who need help asap not us. That trade makes no sense given our position
CHICubs,3beta4,THEriot2,3,Mon Jun 29 01:07:07 2015 UTC,"The mets are the ones who need help asap not us.   Don't see how either team needs help ASAP. The Mets have a very solid window to compete now with that rotation. They're in no rush especially with the Phillies going no where, the Braves at the beginning of what should be a pretty lengthy turnaround, and the Marlins doing God-knows-what. The cream of the crop in the division, is aging quickly with younger guys that are having trouble staying healthy. The Nats have more help behind these guys, but there's no reason to think that the Mets would have a better shot at beating them this year than the next several years.   That trade makes no sense given our position   Yeah, that's absurd."
CHICubs,3beta4,TandBusquets,-1,Mon Jun 29 14:24:19 2015 UTC,The Mets either turn the season around now or admit they aren't really contending this season. Their infield/offense is horrendous. Their pitching means nothing if they don't get some talent.
CHICubs,3beta4,THEriot2,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:01:39 2015 UTC,"The Mets do not need help ""asap"". They're situation is actually fairly similar to the Cubs both currently this season, and in the future. There's no reason for either team to compromise the next 5 years in any way for something that benefits them this year.  They've got Harvey, Wheeler, Syndergaard, DeGrom, and Matz all around for years. There's plenty of time for them to add enough bats to be very good."
CHICubs,3beta4,TandBusquets,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:19:16 2015 UTC,Name the bats they have in the minors or the ones they can add through free agency? They are going to have to deal pitchers to add some offense.
CHICubs,3beta4,THEriot2,2,Mon Jun 29 17:26:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, they likely will have to deal 1 of their 5 team-controlled, under 27  3+ SP. Again, that doesn't mean they have to make a deal ""asap"". That's all I'm saying. You're acting like the Mets are in some low-leverage dealing position when they are in no way. They're in a strong position with lots of flexibility.   But I guess I'll answer you since you don't really want to address anything I'm saying. In the minors they have Brandon Nimmo, who has good on base skills and hopefully either stick in center or add some more pop. There's also Michael Conforto, who many thought should have won the Golden Spikes Award in 2014. Conforto can straight rake, though he won't hit for a ton of power most likely and is destined to be a LF most likely. And they have Dilson Herrera, who has hit at every level he's played at as a middle-infielder who is young for the level. He's also got a couple cups of coffee so far and showed a bit in the bigs at age 20.  There's no great FA options, but they would likely not contend for a can't-miss guy anyways so it all comes down to picking the right guy among the several with intriguing upside, but flaws as well."
CHICubs,3beta4,TandBusquets,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:46:12 2015 UTC,They have Harvey for three more years. They cannot afford to waste a year. Mets fans have been strung along by management for like 2 years claiming that they will be competitive. There is no way that the mets are competitive with the team they are fielding day in day out.  Where is conforto going to play? They aren't going to bench Granderson or Cuddyer. What they need is infield help.   Nimmo is yet another outfielder they don't have room to field.   I take it you have seen dilson Herrera in the majors or at least glanced at his numbers. He's been hot shit.  What they want and need are middle infielders like Baez and maybe throw in a couple other prospects for someone like matz.
CHICubs,3beta4,THEriot2,2,Mon Jun 29 20:34:43 2015 UTC,"I take it you have seen dilson Herrera in the majors or at least glanced at his numbers. He's been hot shit.   Holy shit, he's played all of 43 games at the age of 21 and still has rookie status. Let's just write the guy off.   They have Harvey for three more years. They cannot afford to waste a year.   This is literally zero reason for them to make a rash move now. It is STILL not ""asap"". How is this asap at all? Who gives 2 shits about Granderson and Cuddyer. And yes, they will be benched if they cannot produce and there is an upgrade available. The cost is sunk. Plus, Granderson's changes to his swing have made him a decent player again. Not $15 million good, but not the worst problem. Can he do something similar through the rest of his contract? I don't think so, but I thought his career was over after 2013."
CHICubs,3beta4,THEriot2,2,Mon Jun 29 20:51:27 2015 UTC,"Anytime we learn the name of a prospect now, we won't trade him for the world."
CHICubs,3beta4,MundaneInternetGuy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:25:03 2015 UTC,"If I were the Cubs, I wouldn't pay anything more than chump change for Niese. When Wada comes back, Niese becomes our 6th best starting pitcher. Maybe if we were starved for pitching and in win-now mode then McKinney or Vogelbach would make sense, but in our situation it makes no sense whatsoever. I'd rather trade McKinney and Vogelbach for Zobrist or something."
CHICubs,3beta4,THEriot2,2,Mon Jun 29 03:42:20 2015 UTC,"When Wada comes back, Niese becomes our 6th best starting pitcher.   Give me Niese over Wada every day of the week. At least he has a decently lengthy consistent track record of putting up numbers Wada's put up in 100 big league innings plus he's 6 years younger."
CHICubs,3beta4,stackshot,4,Mon Jun 29 14:27:20 2015 UTC,"I don't see why any NL club would even want Vogelbach.  For being a pure, no-field DH, he may not even have 20 HR-power in the Majors. I don't see the appeal."

CHICubs,3bc35k,jimrob4,2,Sun Jun 28 01:30:59 2015 UTC,"Keeping Up Appearances:       Keeping Up Appearances is a BBC television sitcom created and written by Roy Clarke for the BBC, centred on the life of eccentric and snobbish middle class social climber Hyacinth Bucket, who insists that her surname is pronounced ""Bouquet"". The sitcom follows Hyacinth in her attempts to prove her social superiority and to gain standing with those she considers upper class; attempts that are constantly hampered by her decidedly lower-class extended family whom she desperately seeks to hide. Much of the humour comes from the culture clash between Hyacinth's vision of herself and the reality of her working class background, plus the farcical situations she finds herself in as she battles to protect her social credibility. The show features many running jokes and], the sitcom spawned five series and 44 episodes—4 of which are Christmas specials. Keeping Up Appearances was a great success in the UK and also captured large audiences in the US, Canada, Australia, Belgium and the Netherlands, but ceased production in 1995 when Routledge wanted to move on to other projects. Since its original release, all five series—including Christmas specials—have been available on DVD. It is regularly repeated worldwide (PBS in the US; BBC One, Gold, and Drama in the UK and Ireland).

Heck, due to where I live (northern Michigan) I only got to see a good few home games back when WGN actually showed games..  and never saw them win a home game... bad luck, bad timing.. yes.  When I did see games, they were rarely close, and it was a rough season..   I've been a cubs fan for about 20 years now and it's been rough.  This season though, is amazing.  We have so much young talent to watch grow and overachieve.  I admit, if our players were all around 30, then yes we should be mad.. but not when they are this young and showing so much promise.  The fact that every night we can feel like we can win the game, and can stand in with the great pitchers that St. Louis brings to the game is amazing.    THis year the team is awesome.  Next year and beyond we might be epic."

CHICubs,3b89yy,achap39,19,Fri Jun 26 19:47:37 2015 UTC,"That's why we picked up Renteria as manager-- can you imaging being able to go out and get Maddon with Ryno on the bench? It would have been a horribly messy PR situation and in 10 years when we wanted him to come back as a cubs ambassador, there would be hard feelings all around.   Avoiding his hiring was a very smart move."

CHICubs,3b89yy,KCchemist,6,Fri Jun 26 19:45:05 2015 UTC,"Also I think there was some mutual dissatisfaction during the end of his AAA tenure with us, and of course being passed over for Quade."

Though, as awful as that season was, maybe it was best not to tarnish my god-like view of Ryno by having him in charge of that dumpster fire."
CHICubs,3b89yy,LtDarien,7,Fri Jun 26 19:59:08 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Quade did everything right as interim manager after Piniella retired.  The Cubs ended 2010 on a high note, they finished out 24-13. (As a reference, only 3 teams have are that many games over .500 this season, over about twice as many games)"
CHICubs,3b89yy,WP4114,6,Fri Jun 26 20:17:18 2015 UTC,To be fair Quade did a great job the year Piniella resigned.

CHICubs,3b89yy,RustyDarkstar76,2,Fri Jun 26 20:19:41 2015 UTC,He did win in the minors.  He did start at the bottom and kept on going.....
CHICubs,3b89yy,THEriot2,-1,Fri Jun 26 20:25:46 2015 UTC,"He never had a great minor league managerial record, to be frank. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, and he never developed anything out the ordinary (didn't have the most to work with, again).   But yeah, passing him for Quade isn't the worst thing in the world. The team was planning on losing and having young guys. Quade was for more experienced in working with young players. Other things go into the evaluation process. Ryno has been described as a rigid, ""sit back"" manager. That's not what the FO is about, nor is it what this team needed or needs.   Questionable decision? Sure. Without its merits? Not the case at all, in my opinion."
CHICubs,3b89yy,Devadander,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:30:08 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand the sentiment of 'love to have him around'. Yes, he was a great player, HoF, and cut his teeth coaching the Cubs minor ranks, but I've yet to see an instant where I thought 'damn, wish Ryno was with the Cubs'. The Cubs have their own thing going on now, removed from the past, and that's a good thing."
CHICubs,3b89yy,HeadBanzMakeHerDance,4,Fri Jun 26 23:12:13 2015 UTC,"regardless of how good or bad his managerial skills are, that job the last couple years had to have been awful.  no reason for hope, just an awful roster.  Amaro isn't just bad but he completely talks down to their fanbase despite having no plan whatsoever."
CHICubs,3b89yy,friendlyconfines,2,Fri Jun 26 20:30:42 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind having him come on in a few years as a Special Assistant but I'm not sure that will happen.  Burnt bridges and all that.  It will be interesting to see if he catches on as a manager this offseason.  If he doesn't, I'd say that means that Front Offices view him as a sub-par manager."
CHICubs,3b89yy,THEriot2,5,Fri Jun 26 21:57:32 2015 UTC,"Please just keep him away. There's not really a need at a position he'd be interested in, and I'm not convinced he fits with the current organization at all. The Cubs fan base has a tough time moving on, but it needs to be done.  Plus, Dave Martinez (allegedly) fucked his wife. That'd be awkward."

He doesn't really have a history of really improving anyone. Why do you think the guy that's beaten the path to be a manager for years, and resigned to help keep that alive, would just become an infield coach?  And no, I don't think Castro will, or can, improve with the glove. He is what he is with it, and what he always has been. Defensive ability usually peaks between 22-25 making it even more unlikely."

I don't know why people think being a great player means you can coach. It's often the opposite, the guys who could do are often stuck in their ways (which are now 30 years past), and the guys who couldn't do are willing to adapt, be patient, learn, and teach."

You may not have the pieces to work with, but that doesn't mean you just roll over and die."

He wanted the position and got fucked, it sucks but I am soooooooooo glad it was with the Phillies and not us that the Shitty time was had.

CHICubs,3b9ryp,2legit2knit,2,Sat Jun 27 04:51:38 2015 UTC,We had this. Our bullpen has been flawless.....until we had to play the Cards....Curious to see the rookie make his debut tomorrow.
CHICubs,3b9ryp,JCardCubs,3,Sat Jun 27 03:45:30 2015 UTC,That one hurt. Our bats have been asleep the past couple of games. Let's get em tomorrow. Go Cubs!

CHICubs,3b9ryp,1859,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:58:43 2015 UTC,"I have no issue with going to the 5 man infield - it was the right call - but I do have issue with the set up of it.  I think you have to put the OF on the heavy side of the infield, preferably behind the P.  That way, if he has to make the play, it will likely be on a ball hit hard straight at him.  Putting Baxter on the weak side means if he has to make a play, it will be more likely to involve more movement.    It is a lot like how when people started to shift, they would just move the 3B and SS over, but now they move the 3B all the way over and leave the SS in his more natural spot - minimizes the chances of the 3B trying to make a SS play.  Not sure if Russell could have made the play, but it is more likely he could have."

CHICubs,3b8lvt,nab95,2,Sat Jun 27 03:45:10 2015 UTC,Our fielding is poor. It's cost us several games and in a series with a team of this caliber it puts us at a huge disadvantage. We'll either need hotter bats or a big improvement in fielding to be a real contender over the stretch of the season.
CHICubs,3b8lvt,j4callen,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:18:37 2015 UTC,"I think this is a good enough team to make the playoffs. We are tied for the wild card as is.

CHICubs,3b8lvt,friendly-confines,2,Sat Jun 27 03:51:07 2015 UTC,Guys relax. Being a catcher sucks. Being a catcher sucks even worse when you go into extras. Probably why Joe took Montero out.
CHICubs,3b8lvt,EvilFefe,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:22:08 2015 UTC,Why not take him out after Montero bats

CHICubs,3b6y1x,oceangrapes,15,Fri Jun 26 13:48:32 2015 UTC,"Seriously what did that ump think he was going to do?   Lester was obviously frustrated as fuck, but after he turns around yelling he stops. He calms down and doesn't say another word. The ump on the other hand is seriously charging the mound the the point that papa Ross has to hold him back. I don't know what review process the league has for ump (if they have one at all), but this guy needs to be sat down by a higher up and have his role explained to him."
CHICubs,3b6y1x,slasky,18,Fri Jun 26 16:19:31 2015 UTC,If a player did that to an ump they would be suspended for a week.
CHICubs,3b6y1x,Pseudonova,10,Fri Jun 26 17:09:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I feel that umpires need to be held to a much higher standard than players on issues like this.  I think that a player would probably get a week, and have it reduced to a few games.  I think the ump here probably needs to get a month and then on review they will probably reduce it to a couple of weeks.  Give him 4 or 4 series at home to cool down.  If Lester is really causing that much grief then he should have tossed him, or had a calm conversation with Ross, Lester and Maddon about it."

CHICubs,3b6y1x,LarryHolmes,2,Sat Jun 27 15:34:56 2015 UTC,"This encounter taught me one thing: Joe Maddon understands and practices territorial dominance.   Maddon intercepts the charging umpire near the mound, puts his body between his pitcher and the charging umpire, and argues the umpire back to his spot behind the plate and then walks away. Whatever words he was saying during this argument were secondary to his primary objective which was getting him away from his pitcher. Brilliant."

CHICubs,3b6y1x,THEriot2,0,Sat Jun 27 02:07:54 2015 UTC,"Pretending like Lester wasn't a baby is counterproductive. He's supposed to be the ace and veteran leadership on this young team. We can't have him getting into it with the 3rd hitter of the game and then the umpire in the 2nd. Acting like Lester is free of fault, no matter the umpire's unjust actions, is asinine and counterproductive.   We as Cubs fans need to stop bloody defending our players because they're input team, and start holding them accountable. Just like it's a new era with the organization and FO, it needs to be a new era with the fans. Every fan base has their idiots, but the Cubs fan base has an undeniable reputation of standing by people who don't deserve it. Lester is supposed to be, not only a good pitched, but a leader. We didn't pay him that much to be a pitcher, but gave a premium for what he brings to a young team. The problem is that he has, thus far, insisted on being treated as a coddled superstar instead of a team leader. He has done exactly zero of what he was asked to do even after his, decent but not best option, personal catcher was brought in. He is, and always been, a 2 at best so Cubs fans have had unreasonable expectations since early December, but, that aside, he's done nothing that could be reasonably expected from him. This club has gained zero from him being on the payroll, and that is, unfortunately, very sad."

The author notes that it's a small sample size and I don't think it's anything at all to be concerned about, but it's still a pretty interesting trend.  My favorite quote from the article:   But like some kind of movie monster, Bryant emerges at night to wreak havoc on the unsuspecting townsfolk, raking at a clip of .307/.400/.540 in 39 games, good for a .940 OPS and a home run for every 5.75 strikeouts — nearly three times better than in day games."

CHICubs,3b6kxa,tbv93,28,Fri Jun 26 11:32:44 2015 UTC,"Just a couple stats I think are telling. Some of these have been pointed out by other commenters, including /u/cheese-burger-walrus   His FIP in 2015 is 3.58. His career FIP is also 3.58.  Both his K% and BB% are better than his career numbers. His HR/FB is 37.5% higher than his career average.  His BABIP is .329, significantly higher than his career number of .302. (rough calc says that means 8 of the 95 hits he's given up have been luck).   We are getting the player that Lester has been for his entire career. his bad surface stats (ERA) are the result of mostly bad luck. Normalize the luck stats, and his numbers this year are right in line with his career averages.   Did we overpay for him? Maybe. We paid the market price for a #1/2 starter who has thrown 190+ innings every year since 2008 and has a history of elevating his game in the playoffs."

He is getting more ground balls than normal but more of his pitches have been landing as hits (elevated BABIP).  His velocity isn't troubling and the pickoff debate is overblown.  He has given up more line drives which tend to fall for hits more often but he's also given up more HR/FB than he has in the past.  Right now, I'd peg it on leaving a few too many meaters over the zone, some bad luck and early season injuries messed with him a bit.  Nothing too concerning yet but I reserve the right to change my tune to ""ZOMG HE SUX!!!"" in a few months, if only because I hate multi-year free agents past 30."

His command hasn't been what it needs to be resulting in him getting hit pretty well so far (HR/FB and a slightly inflated BABIP). That and he's had a pretty significant velocity dip (though he velo was up last year). He's gotta make some adjustments and really command his pitches. If he can do that, and get a bit of help on the luck side, he can turn this year around. It would be really nice if we could get another dominant month or longer out of him."

CHICubs,3b6kxa,MrJigglyBrown,4,Fri Jun 26 15:04:38 2015 UTC,Doesn't work that way. Lester isn't the whole team. They miss the playoffs by a game you can't just jump to a game that Lester lost and say that's the one that would've got us in. Because you could also look at a game that Rizzo went 0-4 in or Bryant made or a costly error or Maddon pinch hit Baxter and Ross. Team sport. Through and through.
CHICubs,3b6kxa,ViaChicago3441,5,Fri Jun 26 14:02:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you can pick out every little instance for every member of the team. Rizzo and Bryant are already playing very well. No one expects players to be perfect. But, when you're ""ace"" has an ERA above 4 at the end of the year, it's much easier and more reasonable to say that if he pitched better the team would have made it."
CHICubs,3b6kxa,Bob2456,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:33:16 2015 UTC,"Well of course it's easier. Not sure anyone would dispute that. Reality is though he pitches once every five days. Not fair to him to look at his contract and say well he accounts for the largest percentage of the payroll therefore the outcome of the season, good or bad, rests on his shoulders alone.   We've lost 7 games on this current 20-game stretch of no off days. In 5 of those losses, Rizzo drew two walks and didn't have a hit. You'd be a crazy person to look back at the end of the season and say, boy that game in June against Cleveland, if only Rizzo had gotten a hit we would've won. Again that's just not how works, nor should it. Every player(and manager) is accountable for the success and failure of the whole team."
CHICubs,3b6kxa,ViaChicago3441,5,Fri Jun 26 15:49:17 2015 UTC,I said no one expects players to be perfect. Rizzo and Bryant have been carrying their weight. But if Lester continues to struggle and finishes the year with a 4+ ERA then I think it would be perfect fine to say that he was a big reason we didn't make it. I'm not saying look at a one or two week stretch and pick out those bad performances. I'm saying you look at the whole season.
CHICubs,3b6kxa,Bob2456,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:53:03 2015 UTC,"It's a similar thing though. He's had 4 starts this year where his ERA is 9+. Horrible. But 6 of his starts he's had an ERA of under 1.5. Incredible. Overall, he's been average I'd say. I think he needs to calm down a bit, clearly gets flustered when calls don't go his way and that can't happen. But he's had some bad luck and made a handful of mistake pitches and paid for them. I'm not washing his balls, I just think he'll be fine and that fans are getting too bent out of shape. Let's just hope we don't get to the end of the season and say if only. Let's just make the playoffs and I think everyone in this thread knows this team is capable of doing that. Takes a team though."

CHICubs,3b63p0,TheFakeTimShady,10,Fri Jun 26 15:25:03 2015 UTC,I don't know if we can that's not up to me.  If you mean you think we should then yes because David Ross defensively is sound but he's as slow as can be on the base paths if he ever gets a damn hit. I think for now he's a great veteran to have but after a while Lester needs to move outside his comfort zone and:  1) Break up with Ross  2) Throw a fucking ball to hold a runner  Montero is actually good defensively and great at pitch framing (that's why we brought him in) so defensively it wouldn't be too much of a step down if one at all. Hitting wise he's a huge + so I think this should probably be in the works already. Does anyone have word on whether Lester has been throwing a pen with Montero?
CHICubs,3b63p0,Jollyman21,5,Fri Jun 26 12:54:05 2015 UTC,"It's no wonder he doesn't get a lot of run support either. There's no better way to just kill a potential scoring threat like having Ross and Lester come up to bat back to back.  But I agree, if he were pitching up to the level of money he is getting paid then I say keep it but when he pitching like our 4th or 5th starter it's time for a change since it's pretty clear the personal catcher thing isn't working out."
CHICubs,3b63p0,kweb1023,3,Fri Jun 26 13:29:42 2015 UTC,"I said this yesterday but ace pitchers don't need to worry so much about pickoff moves. Holding runners doesn't matter when they don't score. A guy like Lester is supposed to depend more on pure command rather than a large bag of tricks that include pickoff moves.  Yes, it would be nice for the freak show to end, but Lester has bigger worries than a pickoff move at this point and I wish we, as fans, would stop talking about it because it's the least important thing for him right now."
CHICubs,3b63p0,Solleret,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:39:33 2015 UTC,"I guess my point is let's say you walk a guy with no outs. He can basically freely steal 2nd no problem, possibly third as well. What went from a DP is now moving the runner over. What is a single and men on 1st and 2nd is now a run or 1st and 3rd. You're not wrong in that if he had good command its not a problem but even if he does his job and gets a flyout, anything to the outfield moves a runner or scores him."
CHICubs,3b63p0,Jollyman21,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:36:15 2015 UTC,"Sure, in a perfect world he'd be able to keep runners honest; that's all the pickoff is about after all.

CHICubs,3b5u03,voidecho,2,Fri Jun 26 10:14:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's had two good starts.  I know you're not really asking, but for other's....  Scouting grades: Fastball: 60 | Curveball: 55 | Changeup: 50 | Control: 45 | Overall: 45 Another of the mid-round high school pitchers the Cubs paid over-slot bonuses in 2014, Steele got the highest fifth-round bonus in the Draft at $1,000,000. The 139th overall selection, he was the earliest Mississippi prep pitcher taken since the Braves made Matt Butler a second-rounder in 1999.  Steele's stuff fluctuated wildly on the summer showcase circuit in 2013, but he solidified it as a high school senior and maintained it during his pro debut. He's capable of reaching back for 95 mph on his fastball, but he gets more life and is often more effective when he pitches at 88-92 mph.  Steele is adding more power to his curveball, which already featured good depth and could give him a second plus pitch. He has some fade to his changeup but sometimes tips it off by slowing his arm speed, a correctable flaw. He's athletic but lacks size and true command, so some scouts believe he'll wind up in the bullpen."

CHICubs,3b85dh,Stommped,12,Fri Jun 26 19:10:24 2015 UTC,"Who's worried about Bryant?  As far as Russell goes, he's 21 and 7th among NL rookies in WAR. He's performing just as how he should have been reasonably expected to perform."
CHICubs,3b85dh,THEriot2,-6,Fri Jun 26 20:25:46 2015 UTC,"Here's what I mentioned about Bryant below:  He's 3rd in the NL in strikeouts, with 40 fewer ABs than the guys around him with the exception of Pederson, that's the major thing that's concerning.  Baez's strikeout rate is what led to his demotion ultimately as strikeouts are just so detrimental to offense.  That and the other guy mentioned his HR rate is far lower than we expected (23rd in NL in AB per HR, behind a guy like Buster Posey who's never hit more than 24 in a season).  Maybe we just disagree on what ""worried"" means.  At the very least he's doing worse than expected; if you predicted a .278 average, 3rd in the NL in strikeouts, and only 10 HRs by June 26th you would have been considered extremely pessimistic.    And as far as Russell goes, it's along those same lines. Contrary to Bryant we didn't know he would be getting this many games this year, but if you did know at the beginning of the year that he would be playing 120+ games, you would have expected him to finish 7th in ROTY voting with a .250/.312?  That's certainly way lower than I expected.    I know we are miles away from ROTY voting, but that's essentially what the WAR rankings are telling me.  When I heard Russell was coming up I honestly thought we could have 3 of top 5 rookie of the year finishers with Bryant/Russell/Soler, and I don't think that was overly optimistic based on scouting reports.  If Russell were to finish 7th that would be extremely disappointing."
CHICubs,3b85dh,THEriot2,3,Fri Jun 26 21:11:04 2015 UTC,"He's 3rd in the NL in strikeouts, with 40 fewer ABs than the guys around him with the exception of Pederson, that's the major thing that's concerning. Baez's strikeout rate is what led to his demotion ultimately as strikeouts are just so detrimental to offense.   That's all good until you get to the BB rate. K and BB should almost always be evaluated together.   That and the other guy mentioned his HR rate is far lower than we expected    I also saw someone predict he'd hit 50 HR in his rookie year. His power is a little disappoint, sure, but it's early, hasn't really warmed up yet, and I don't think anyone can justifiably complain about a .474 SLG out of a rook especially with a guy who can put that above .500 with a few big games.   At the very least he's doing worse than expected   Sure, I'd say the expectations around baseball and especially among Cubs fans were pretty absurd.    if you did know at the beginning of the year that he would be playing 120+ games, you would have expected him to finish 7th in ROTY voting with a .250/.312?   Yeah, around there. It's a deep class, and his slash line is about what was expected from several publications (see the Bleacher Nation article from when he was called up, I don't have time to find it right now sorry) when he was called up. He's a 21 MIF playing a new position.   If Russell were to finish 7th that would be extremely disappointing.   I 100% disagree. He's FAR advanced for his age. The NL ROY had both Pederson and Bryant so there's 2. You also have Duffy who didn't show much last year, but played okay in the playoffs, and we all know that the handful of games played the year before, struggling or not, can be huge. The one guy I'm surprised with is Jace Peterson.  I just think our expectations as a fan base were out of control. These guys weren't just going to light the world on fire with no struggles, and they all certainly weren't going to do it. In all honesty, Russell is playing better than I expected. He has more pop and better defense than I thought he'd show out of the gate.  Gotta run, go Cubs."

CHICubs,3b85dh,nosoupforyou25,-9,Fri Jun 26 21:18:33 2015 UTC,"Yes? Joc Pederson's offensive WAR is better than Bryant's.  He's in the middle of the pack for rookies in other offensive categories, and he's 3 strikeouts behind Pederson (with 7 fewer ABs) to lead the league in that category.   Take a look at some rookies in history:  Pujols: .329/.403/.610 with 37HR and 130RBI  Trout:  .326/.399/.564 with 30HR and 83RBI  I really don't think it's unfair to compare to those guys given the hype surrounding him."

CHICubs,3b4bkz,vwlssck,3,Thu Jun 25 22:39:31 2015 UTC,"I completely forgot about Fowler, that's right. Hope Bryant is better soon. Especially for the Cardinals. And congrats to Castro"
CHICubs,3b4bkz,Thetiredduck,8,Thu Jun 25 22:41:12 2015 UTC,"Fowler got an at bat today as a Pinch Hitter so that looks good and Castro came to the game after his baby was born. I think that shows some real commitment to the team. I wouldn't worry too much about Bryant, I'm willing to bet he'll be back for the Cards."
CHICubs,3b4bkz,vwlssck,2,Thu Jun 25 22:47:56 2015 UTC,Was Castro in uniform or just sitting in the stands?
CHICubs,3b4bkz,jcftw61,3,Thu Jun 25 22:50:44 2015 UTC,I should have specified; he came into the game and played SS. He had 2 at bats.
CHICubs,3b4bkz,vwlssck,3,Thu Jun 25 23:21:45 2015 UTC,I didn't know Castro didn't start for a birth - that's great for him.  I was at the game and saw both starting line ups and was a little disappointed.  But trying to explain to my nephew where Coughlan was playing every inning was a fun game.
CHICubs,3b4bkz,callthebluff,18,Thu Jun 25 23:27:18 2015 UTC,"Not too concerned about the offense. No (or little) bryant, castro, montero, fowler, soler, schwarber  (heh heh heh).  Am concerned about Lester though. Aside from his overall not fantastic play, his attitude is worrying. Constantly yelling at umps, and I still don't get the no pick off thing. You spend one start throwing to first constantly, if it loses you the game then oh well. Just fix it.   The bullpen looked good again though."

CHICubs,3b4bkz,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:36:54 2015 UTC,"That's actually not true.   First, he had a normal pickoff attempt rate through 2013.   Second, ace pitchers don't need to worry much about throwing to first. A high K pitcher doesn't care if a steal gets by once in a while because they depend more on pure command than tricks like good pickoff moves. Stolen bases don't matter when they aren't converted into runs.  Finally, left handers in general throw to first a lot less than right handers because base runners are more cautious with a lefty on the mound.   Considering these three facts I can see how this went under the radar for so long, and why it's unfair to simply blame his coaches.   Going forward I'd rather see him start getting his command back than worry about throwing to first. I don't give a damn about his yips in comparison to his control issues so far this season, and I hope Bosio would agree with that."
CHICubs,3b4bkz,Solleret,11,Fri Jun 26 10:37:03 2015 UTC,Fuck that ump going after Lester and even talking down to Ross after he was trying to prevent confrontation. These umps have let their power go to their head and someone needs to take them down a peg.
CHICubs,3b4bkz,jacksonvstheworld,9,Fri Jun 26 05:33:00 2015 UTC,"I'm really not a fan of Lester mouthing off to the ump, but after seeing that replay the ump is really at fault here. Yeah, Lester was a dumbass, but he didn't go running to home plate like the ump tried to run to the mound. Lester said his piece, realized he was stupid and then stopped talking while the ump was pushing Ross to try to get to the mound while he was running his mouth. Very unprofessional if you ask me."
CHICubs,3b4bkz,vwlssck,8,Thu Jun 25 22:01:37 2015 UTC,"When he was pushing Ross, I think Ross has every right to not budge. If I was the guy in the MLB who managed suspensions and I had to deal with a guy standing up to an ump rushing the mound, I'd suspend the ump."
CHICubs,3b4bkz,jacksonvstheworld,7,Thu Jun 25 22:47:33 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. If I'm Ross I don't care who you are, I'm not going to let you go charging out to my pitcher.  But beyond that, what ump tries to rush the mound? Like really, when has that ever been ok?"
CHICubs,3b4bkz,vwlssck,5,Thu Jun 25 22:52:37 2015 UTC,Its not unheard of. I recall a similar situation last year but its out of control. It should be a total anomaly and not something that is this common.

Now we're not too far from the ASB and he hasn't quite turned into Lester form.   He's still pitching OK, as his ERA is slightly North of 4.00, but the money he's being paid and hype around him really overshadow him right now.   I wonder if he's hurt and just not saying anything or the team isn't saying anything? But it's a bit odd we're this late into the season and he has yet to take the form of the pitcher we know he can be.   But the fact we're doing so well without our ace being an ace only means if he gets himself together post-ASB this rotation would be top 3 in the majors.  It didn't help we were shut out today, but even if we put up 8 runs, Lester's struggles would still be worrisome."

CHICubs,3b2xzb,los_pollos-hermanos,3,Thu Jun 25 20:33:58 2015 UTC,So.... EJax would lead the team in ERA if he qualified hahaha
CHICubs,3b2xzb,Cpt_Hook,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:31:12 2015 UTC,Justin Grimm has a better ERA but he doesn't qualify either
CHICubs,3b2xzb,HotYoungTeen,3,Thu Jun 25 20:30:20 2015 UTC,"True dat. I think Edwin has thrown a lot more innings than Grimmy though.   Edit: not a ton, 27 to 17."
CHICubs,3b2xzb,Cpt_Hook,3,Thu Jun 25 20:31:49 2015 UTC,These 4 runs feel like 30.
CHICubs,3b2xzb,cubswinagain,2,Thu Jun 25 20:32:41 2015 UTC,"alright this is our inning, I can feel it"
CHICubs,3b2xzb,NewArithmetic,7,Thu Jun 25 20:24:38 2015 UTC,Probably just a fart.
CHICubs,3b2xzb,cubswinagain,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:22:24 2015 UTC,I'm feeling at least 6 runs. Maybe a baker's dozen
CHICubs,3b2xzb,BobC813,3,Thu Jun 25 20:26:46 2015 UTC,"So does Castro have a kid now or what?  edit: A second kid. As in, did his wife just give birth to a child and now he's in the game?"

CHICubs,3b2xzb,cubswinagain,-1,Thu Jun 25 20:26:55 2015 UTC,Uhhh.. did J.D. just say that winning the WS doesn't make you the best team in baseball?
CHICubs,3b2xzb,hawksfan81,8,Thu Jun 25 20:08:11 2015 UTC,"It doesn't, just means you got hot at the right time."

CHICubs,3b2xzb,wjblol,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:08:58 2015 UTC,Would you consider this just a baseball thing? Because if someone were to tell me the Hawks aren't the best team in hockey I would tell them to go fuck themselves.
CHICubs,3b2xzb,Dhash23,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:08:37 2015 UTC,"The Hawks played like dogshit for stretches of the regular season, and they limped into the playoffs lucky they weren't in a wild card spot. They did manage to correct the play that was hurting them, though. And Kane came back."
CHICubs,3b2xzb,wjblol,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:10:41 2015 UTC,"Hawks were the best team in the league man, I really don't know what your argument is.   Edit: After re-reading your comment again I don't think that's what you meant. Nevermind."
CHICubs,3b2xzb,THEriot2,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:07:34 2015 UTC,"Whoops, yeah. They proved it in the playoffs. In seven-game series it's hard to argue the 'best' team didn't win. Baseball is more or less the same deal, and getting hot at the right time helps."
CHICubs,3b2xzb,Loop_Within_A_Loop,6,Thu Jun 25 21:11:12 2015 UTC,"More baseball than other sports because the better team loses the most often in baseball.  The team that wins the WS could be the best team, but isn't necessarily. I'd say it's the same for NHL and NFL. NBA probably has the best come out the most."
CHICubs,3b2xzb,djb2287,2,Thu Jun 25 21:14:05 2015 UTC,"No, it's actually in pretty much any sport. The ""best team"" might not be the one that handles pressure well, or might just get a bad bounce or two that decide everything.  Being able to get hot at the right time is partially skill, i.e. you don't crack under pressure/end the season on a hot streak and decide to not stop, but there is a lot of luck involved.  There are a lot of teams that were the best that season in any sport that never won the championship."
CHICubs,3b2xzb,hawksfan81,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:16:41 2015 UTC,18-1 pats.. I'd say it's most true for Football or march madness because it's only 1 and done. But Baseball is a PLAYOFF series. And the better team will win that series.
CHICubs,3b2xzb,djb2287,0,Thu Jun 25 20:13:57 2015 UTC,Except when they don't. The Cubs are 2-4 against the Brewers this year; would you say the Brewers are better than the Cubs?
CHICubs,3b2xzb,MattForte2222,0,Thu Jun 25 20:19:30 2015 UTC,Regular season is not the same as post season.
CHICubs,3b2xzb,djb2287,-1,Thu Jun 25 20:23:10 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it makes you the best....if you don't show up for the playoffs, you're not as good as the team that did"
CHICubs,3b2xzb,MattForte2222,-1,Thu Jun 25 20:24:13 2015 UTC,"The best teams make the playoffs. And whoever wins the WS is the best of the best. So yeah I think it makes you the best. The object of the game is to win the WS. You win it, you are the best in the game."
CHICubs,3b2xzb,djb2287,0,Thu Jun 25 20:10:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, failing to see how winning the WS doesn't make you the best. If you lose in the playoffs while healthy, there's no excuses. You weren't good enough."
CHICubs,3b2xzb,djb2287,-1,Thu Jun 25 20:11:59 2015 UTC,Especially since its a best of 5 or 7 series. It's not just 1 game that you could get a bad bounce in. The better team will win.

CHICubs,3b2xzb,Solleret,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:57:12 2015 UTC,Pat usually takes a break in the 5th.  My father seems to think its to pound a beer and have a smoke.
CHICubs,3b2xzb,Slednvrfed,2,Thu Jun 25 19:56:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he has been doing color for the 5th, though.   I think since Judd isn't doing play by play anymore Pat can't take the entire half inning off and comes back at some random point to try color commentary. They gotta bring Judd back."
CHICubs,3b2xzb,Randomith,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:21:04 2015 UTC,Coom is not great his monotone and you can't even tell wants going on sometimes. Also pat is probably pooping. He does it about the same time everygame . coomer sucks.
CHICubs,3b2xzb,Solleret,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:25:58 2015 UTC,"I think the 5th had always been Pat's ""off inning"" Judd would always do play by play in the 5th on wgn so my thought is that Ron does it as a favor to Pat to give him a bit of a break."

CHICubs,3b2d2n,keithyp24,17,Thu Jun 25 12:19:59 2015 UTC,The craziest stat from this list is that Barry Bonds only had 49 singles in 2001. That seems completely absurd to me. 49 singles in a year where he was walked 177 times and hit 73 home runs.

CHICubs,3b2d2n,pullandpray,3,Thu Jun 25 13:39:03 2015 UTC,That is pretty crazy. I was going to remark that I thought it was crazy that Sosa only had only 20 doubles and zero triples in '98. That seems really odd to me.

CHICubs,3b2d2n,dhporter,2,Thu Jun 25 12:21:46 2015 UTC,Sammy Sosa had 0 SB in his season and Ruth had 17 in his season. just think about that for a bit.
CHICubs,3b2d2n,burts_beads,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:29:37 2015 UTC,The ABs get slightly more similar when you account for all of the extra BBs Bonds had.

CHICubs,3b2d2n,thirdfounder,5,Thu Jun 25 18:35:15 2015 UTC,"his 2001 was the second-most-productive season by any Cub ever.  sixth in career WAR, 2nd in career slugging, 2nd in career OPS, four of the top 7 slugging seasons, 10th in career games played and 8th in plate appearances, 4th in career total bases, 3rd in career RBI -- how does this man not have his number retired by the club yet?    Cub fans need to forget the stupid hatchet job that was done on him by the club and sycophantic access-obsessed writers as they ran him out of town. his number ought to be on a foul pole flag."
CHICubs,3b2d2n,Solleret,5,Thu Jun 25 14:54:29 2015 UTC,"Steroids and corked bats are a ""hatchet job"" now?   I'm not a Sosa hater -- those were some really great years, I have kept his jersey, and I don't think it's funny when people make fun of him for becoming a vampire.   But I can also understand why his temper, ped usage, etc have tarnished his reputation and why the organization probably will never put his number up there with Banks, Santo, Sandberg, Maddux, Williams, Fergie, and Jackie."
CHICubs,3b2d2n,thirdfounder,4,Thu Jun 25 15:24:05 2015 UTC,"at some point, fans have to accept that for many years steroids were as much a part of the game as chalk lines and glove leather. and the game still is enhanced.  performance enhancing chemistry is as old as the game itself and isn't going anywhere.  Sosa played in a time when that chemistry transparently altered the game in many ways, in large part because 99% of all ballplayers were juiced, but it always has been so.  the sentimentalized idiocy of pretending that it was once a purer, simpler, and more honest game is fodder for a lot of column inches for dumbfuck sportswriters, but it should not guide how we understand baseball.  it is and always has, going back to King Kelly and Pud Galvin, been a cheater's paradise.     The collective view of such skylarkings was best summed up when former Chicago Cubs first baseman Mark Grace said, “If you’re not cheating, you’re not trying.”   being one of the best players of a generation when that entire generation is doping and cheating still means a guy is one of the best players of that generation.  Ted Williams cheated. Babe Ruth cheated. Ty Cobb cheated.  so did Banks, Santo, Sandberg (yes, even the holier-than-thou lecturer of moral superiority), Maddux, Williams, Fergie, and Jackie.  get over it.  that does not taint their legacy, and it shouldn't taint Sosa's.   Consumed by the hysterics of the so-called Steroid Era, baseball has dedicated itself to a witch hunt seeking to preserve the integrity of a game that never had any to begin with. It’s every bit the pointless grasp at imagined moral superiority that it all appears to be. If the ploy succeeds, we’ll lose something special."
CHICubs,3b2d2n,Solleret,2,Thu Jun 25 15:47:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah man, I can accept all that and I am not a sentimental idiot, but thanks for the condescension. I agree with what you wrote.   Baseball loves cheaters, but it doesn't love cheaters who get caught and lie about it — in fact, part of that tradition is to fess up and pretend you won't do it again. And it doesn't love people who do certain childish things that no professional should ever do, such as:   He walked out of a game early and then lied about it  He publicly ripped into his manager on a few occasions his teammates once took a bat to his boom box and smashed it because he became so toxic in the clubhouse, etc.    This goes beyond cheating and it has nothign to do with 'roids — he ruined his own reputation here and there's no one to blame but himself. Possibly some blame can be places on the organization because of how they pampered him during his glory years, but at the end of the day he is the victim of his own devices.   Now on top of the fact that he basically did this ""hatchet job"" to himself, the cheating doesn't help his case. Baseball doesn't need to be played by nice guys, but it shouldn't be played by man children either.   You get caught with your hand in the cookie jar you take your spanking like a man and try harder not to get caught next time, you don't deny it to your mommy and then throw the whole cookie jar on the floor in a tantrum. And this is exactly what happened, because Sosa was the spoiled brat of the organization for so many years."
CHICubs,3b2d2n,thirdfounder,2,Thu Jun 25 15:57:58 2015 UTC,"I am not a sentimental idiot, but thanks for the condescension   LOL sorry, that's not aimed at you or anyone in particular.   he ruined his own reputation   i simply disagree. people were told that he was ruining his reputation, but in reality it was that very telling that did the trick. fans largely take the media's word for who these people are uncritically. (what choice do they have?)  for years Sosa walked on water with the public because he was cast in that light by the local media.  when the worm turned and he was blamed for things (and the bullet points on your list, you have to admit, are really quite trivial things in hindsight) he did apologize -- but of course that was covered in such a way as to make it all appear contrived or disingenuous.  it seemed very clear to me and others whose opinions i respect that the media close to the Cubs were complicit with the team in creating the conditions where Sosa could be wrecked as a public personality before he was shipped.  Tribco poisoned the fans against him to lessen the blowback over dealing him away -- and he was not the only one this happened to in the Tribco era.   i have no idea if Sosa was a clubhouse tool or the Mother Theresa of baseball, and i'm not sure i care. he was a tremendous ballplayer for the Cubs for several years, and one of the most valuable Cubs of all time. the fact that Tribco often saw fit to pull a hatchet job on players they decided to move in an effort to paint the club in a better light should not taint that legacy."
CHICubs,3b2d2n,Solleret,0,Thu Jun 25 17:10:14 2015 UTC,"I think the situation is more nuanced than a conspiracy theory; this is more like arguing about whether to blame parents who raised a spoiled teen or the child who should have self awareness and self agency by a certain point in life.   I was there in Chicago during those years, I lived through it too, and I clearly remember these controversies too, and I disagree with you. All those little incidents add up, and I don't remember the end of the man's career fondly. If anything this will be why his numbers never get retired: people still disagree too much.  Anyway, I like the old Steve Stone quote on Sosa:   If you create Frankenstein, you can't be real surprised if he eats the village. It's not his fault. You created him. The Cubs as an organization had a very permissive attitude toward Sammy Sosa.   And what do you do with a monster you created? You certainly don't put it up on pedestal and memorialize it. You bury it in a hole and you forget about it. That's the tragic truth and why, from a purely pragmatic standpoint, 21 won't be retired anytime soon.  For better or worse, I fondly remember Sammy's glory days, but I don't need him up there with my other heroes. We can give credit where it's due without needing the numbers up there on a flag."
CHICubs,3b2d2n,Solleret,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:20:38 2015 UTC,"what is conspiratorial about the way Tribco sullied players they were getting ready to move? doesn't anyone remember how the Cubs baseball media trashed Mark Grace on the way out of town? the Cubs learned their lesson when they lost Maddux in 1992 and felt the wrath of the fanbase.  for the remainder of the Tribune's ownership, most any popular player who was going to be leaving has been kicked around in the local media first.  that's just how the old Cubs worked, and they are hardly the only example in corporate communications in baseball or in general.   the old Steve Stone quote on Sosa   i do typically like Stone's perspective, but i think he probably has a very different perspective now than he did when he said that. Stone himself was run off the Cubs' plantation in 2004, and was roundly trashed as a prima donna in the Cubs-friendly media in the process.   most celebrity ballplayers are essentially narcissistic adolescents. i don't think that's a secret -- it's been a common recurring topic for all time.  Ron Santo himself was for decades denigrated by the media for similar reasons, as the greatness of the player and the determination of the man to overcome the obstacles in front of him went unappreciated.  i didn't understand anything about why that should've been held especially against Santo. why should it be held especially against Sosa?"

He was rough, the offense was rough, but we have games like that sometimes.  I'm just worried that Hendricks is losing his touch."
CHICubs,3b16dr,zdruck07,10,Thu Jun 25 16:30:04 2015 UTC,This loss is on u/kirsch05 and u/THEriot2 3 of 4 ain't bad lets get 'em tomorrow

CHICubs,3b16dr,THEriot2,7,Thu Jun 25 13:36:35 2015 UTC,Sort of figures we would beat Kershaw and Grienke and then lose the third game
CHICubs,3b16dr,AaronRodgers16,7,Thu Jun 25 03:27:24 2015 UTC,Anybody else think his left hand was on the base before the guy tagged him?

CHICubs,3b16dr,somegaijin42,5,Thu Jun 25 13:18:28 2015 UTC,Semi unrelated note: Anyone heard from Jorge Soler lately? I know he was out of his boot and taking batting practice but that was about as specific of an update I have heard since he went out. Nice that this team has played well without him but jeez he's been out the whole month. Has to be close right?

CHICubs,3b16dr,Jemidar_,3,Thu Jun 25 06:11:49 2015 UTC,The Pederson walk with an 0-2 count in the same at bat killed us
CHICubs,3b16dr,AaronRodgers16,5,Thu Jun 25 03:27:04 2015 UTC,Now we know what teams feel like facing Kris Bryant.
CHICubs,3b16dr,SwedishLovePump,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:59:59 2015 UTC,2 runs on nine hits? Disappointing to see. We will put it together for the rubber game.

CHICubs,3azvui,airham,2,Thu Jun 25 03:26:36 2015 UTC,he wasn't stealing. he just took his time rounding first and tried making it to second

CHICubs,3azvui,Captain_019,2,Thu Jun 25 03:23:10 2015 UTC,He probably deserves to be out just for trying to stretch that to a double.

CHICubs,3azvui,GoCubsGo2015,4,Thu Jun 25 02:57:00 2015 UTC,He's also knocked in like 3 game winners. Seasons have ups and downs.
CHICubs,3azvui,j4callen,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:01:22 2015 UTC,When you have a .638 OPS and an OBP below .300 you'll always have more downs than ups.
CHICubs,3azvui,stackshot,2,Thu Jun 25 04:03:58 2015 UTC,Castro's downs FAR outweigh his ups
CHICubs,3azvui,kingofnumber2,5,Thu Jun 25 03:24:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not a Castro basher, but he does consistently roll weak ground balls to the left side of the infield. Been an issue all season so it's not really one of those peaks and valleys things."
CHICubs,3azvui,ViaChicago3441,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:10:04 2015 UTC,"Motherfucker has like 35 dicks. Agree though seems like he does great or rolls over one to short, only options."

CHICubs,3azvui,LegacyLemur,7,Thu Jun 25 03:14:13 2015 UTC,Soler woulda thrown him out :(
CHICubs,3azvui,bgreene777,3,Thu Jun 25 02:52:41 2015 UTC,It's more deno's horrible throw than on Edwin. If it was an accurate throw out all day.

CHICubs,3b0c8n,decitertiember,2,Thu Jun 25 12:44:34 2015 UTC,"I found it to be incredibly weird, but still loved it. The concourses were almost spotless and looked brand new, and not like a ballpark. It was designed to look like the multipurpose stadium it really is, and that was fine and an interesting change from other parks. Toronto outside of the park is pretty freaking cool as well.  But in the seats, paint was chipped off and 25 years of dirt can be seen in some corners. If you saw the actual seats and some other things first, you would almost have to prepare for the most run down, out of style, un-kept park you've ever been to."

CHICubs,3b0c8n,bmpry5,3,Thu Jun 25 17:36:07 2015 UTC,Wrigley and Fenway are the top two (in either order) or the list is not credible. And Target Field is at 4. It's one of the least appealing stadiums in baseball. It's pretty ugly.

Edit:  you're right though, #4 is a bit much."
CHICubs,3b0c8n,zdruck07,3,Thu Jun 25 12:23:58 2015 UTC,"Love Target. Every seat in the house is great. Wide open concourse, great area surrounding the place. I loved how the ballpark fit right up against the parking garage. I like the OF stands particularly RF with the high wall, and it's another park that does a great job with the skyline in the background.  Better than Wrigley or Fenway, in my opinion, but I don't feel the need to feel like I traveled back in time half a century when I go to the ballpark.  Edit: Love Wrigley, it'd just be really nice to have modern amenities, and even with the improvements, they're still not there, and some of the structure will never be able to be on par with modern ballparks."

I'd put it ahead of both Fenway and Wrigley (blasphemy, I know, especially coming from a Cubs and Red Sox fan).   But the fact that the Trop ISN'T dead last on this list makes it not credible to me.

CHICubs,3azj96,cheese-burger-walrus,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:55:14 2015 UTC,Why would it? It just means that next year they can't spend more than $250k on any one player. That's what happened last year.
CHICubs,3azj96,jmr33090,2,Wed Jun 24 23:14:17 2015 UTC,"The penalties now are they can't spend more than that for 2 years and that 2nd year is after the new CBA kicks in.  There was significant talk about an international draft last year and I'd imagine that the owners will get that in trade for additional money to free agents.  The owners won't want to lift any penalties the first year of the draft so it is very possible that whatever penalty they come up with for overspending in the IFAD will apply to the Cubs in 2017.  Meanwhile, all of the issues that were brought up about minor leaguers during the Kris Bryant Escapade will get little more than lip service."
CHICubs,3azj96,voidecho,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:15:16 2015 UTC,"Personally I think that provides more incentive for the Cubs to blow way past their budget this year. Right now, they can go after whoever they want, if there is a draft, well, they have really limited choices anyways, so there's a good chance they don't get the players they want whether they get penalized or  not."

CHICubs,3ayjyh,PaletoBayPlayboy,38,Wed Jun 24 15:14:51 2015 UTC,Valbuena is also hitting .195 with a .269 obp. And he plays 3b/2b which we didn't need him for. I'd much rather have a good CF with Bryant at 3b and Russell at 2b.

CHICubs,3ayjyh,Illini-11,6,Wed Jun 24 15:22:47 2015 UTC,Do you think Bryant or Valbuena will have more homers by the end of the year? It's 10 to 19 right now.
CHICubs,3ayjyh,Doogolas33,3,Wed Jun 24 15:28:41 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I think LV is playing a little over his head right now. Of course, he also has it a bit easier getting them out at home without the wind to contend with. Could be pretty close. Obviously there is no contest when it comes to potential upside though. A quick glance at walk stats between the two tells you a lot about their individual approaches at the plate.   At any rate, I'm happy for Luis. Good to see him doing well. There were several times while he was in Chicago that i wanted to throttle him and it seems Houston is suiting him well."

Valbuena has a .269 OBP, a .725 OPS, and plays above-average defense at 3b/2b. (He's been incredibly unlucky with BABIP, too)  It's about equal value, really. Pretty even-steven.  Fowler won't likely be here next year, but it was a move I approve of making on a one-year basis."
CHICubs,3ayjyh,Tiny_Danson_Man,5,Wed Jun 24 17:24:49 2015 UTC,With all of the Cubs prospects in the infield also they would have to deal Valbuena eventually. I think it was a solid move from an area of depth (IF) to an area where the Cubs were lacking (OF).
CHICubs,3ayjyh,friendlyconfines,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:40:07 2015 UTC,How the player fits with team is important as well. Fowler is the best option we have as a leadoff hitter so he fills a need.
CHICubs,3ayjyh,zrk23,12,Thu Jun 25 00:24:00 2015 UTC,According to BRef's OPS+ which factors in the ballparks the players have played in they have both been the same offensively with a 98 OPS+.  It's one of those seemingly rare trades that works out great for both teams.
CHICubs,3ayjyh,shamesock,2,Wed Jun 24 15:53:15 2015 UTC,"thought the same thing. worked for both teams, no one lost on that trade"
CHICubs,3ayjyh,NLRD,10,Wed Jun 24 16:42:05 2015 UTC,"Baseball trades aren't zero sum games. This trade addressed areas of need for both teams while shedding surplus from the 40 man.   And as much as I like Luis, he isn't playing great baseball this year despite his 19 HR. It was a great move to turn him and a AAAA pitcher into a solid starter at a position of need."
CHICubs,3ayjyh,Devadander,4,Wed Jun 24 16:21:49 2015 UTC,Fowler and Valbuena were being forced out by younger players on their teams.  The Astros and Cubs each realized they could use a diminished asset to get something a little more useful.  Both teams would do it again 100 times over.
CHICubs,3ayjyh,stackshot,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:52:03 2015 UTC,"This is the biggest point. And both teams are getting positive production from the traded players. Remember, valbuena wasn't going to be a starter for the Cubs with Bryant on the way. He wouldn't have the same numbers here."
CHICubs,3ayjyh,Kaner_95,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:55:38 2015 UTC,"He would start at 3b with Bryant playing his definitely-oncoming position of LF, but I understand what you mean."
CHICubs,3ayjyh,stackshot,2,Wed Jun 24 22:05:59 2015 UTC,Keep in mind we could offer Fowler a QO and get a late first next year. A lot more can come of this trade.
CHICubs,3ayjyh,zrk23,3,Wed Jun 24 18:30:37 2015 UTC,"IMO, that is the ONLY way to handle Fowler.  Offer him a one-year qualifying offer. If he takes it, nice. The Cubs have one more year of CF figured out.  If he denies it, nice. The Cubs get an extra draft pick and then focus on fixing CF long-term someway else."
CHICubs,3ayjyh,stackshot,0,Wed Jun 24 18:44:51 2015 UTC,i agree. just wishing that Happ goes bananas on the minors so he can be our CF next year
CHICubs,3ayjyh,zrk23,3,Wed Jun 24 19:04:10 2015 UTC,"Just too early for Happ, especially when many peg him as a LF.  I don't know what the Cubs do with CF next year. Alcantara? Szczur? They don't inspire a lot of confidence."
CHICubs,3ayjyh,stackshot,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:06:52 2015 UTC,"yeah, i know it is... just a dream... but i would be more comfortable with Fowler again, IF he gets better. right now im not liking his offense and i never liked his defense. we traded for a .360 OBP leadoff guy, not a .320 one. that way hes playing he is disposable."
CHICubs,3ayjyh,zrk23,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:34:49 2015 UTC,"His play right NOW is not the reason I don't want him back, despite it being underwhelming.  You just don't want to give a soon-to-be 30 year old leadoff hitter with injury problems a multi-year deal...it's a bad move."
CHICubs,3ayjyh,Sparx7,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:30:28 2015 UTC,"i was thinking just one more year. then it would be enough time, hopefully, for Happ/Zagunis/Almora take over CF. but if he doesnt accept it, let him go and we can figure it out"
CHICubs,3ayjyh,Ganesha811,2,Wed Jun 24 23:33:13 2015 UTC,LV is also batting .195 and has 60ks.  It looks like its working out for both teams.  We needed a lead off guy/cf and Dex is getting on at over a .300 clip.
CHICubs,3ayjyh,NLRD,3,Wed Jun 24 15:22:19 2015 UTC,"It's also easy to overlook, but Fowler is a very good center fielder. He reads every ball right off the bat and has executed some really nice running catches that other players might not even get to. EDIT: I stand corrected - I guess my observations this season aren't backed by the stats."
CHICubs,3ayjyh,stackshot,9,Wed Jun 24 15:47:01 2015 UTC,"I don't know what you're watching, but he reads a lot of balls poorly and often takes poor routes.  He makes up for it with great speed, which makes him an average-ish CF in my opinion."
CHICubs,3ayjyh,ODB312,6,Wed Jun 24 17:26:52 2015 UTC,"For the past 5 seasons, which is a LOT of sample size, Fowler ranked below average to terrible every single season in the field. Blame positioning, blame the big parks, but that means something.  This year, in a sample size that doesn't really mean much, he's been league average.  No, Fowler is not a ""really good CF"" defensively. You can argue for ""middle of the road"", but Fowler has failed in the field nearly every single season of his MLB life.   He's playing better right now, but what do 60 games really mean compared to 5 full years?"
CHICubs,3ayjyh,zrk23,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:28:05 2015 UTC,"Historically his defensive metrics have been bad. He is definitely not a gold glover out there, but he looks to me to be a very serviceable defensive CF, especially in the smaller Wrigley outfield. I think Coors and Minute Made were pretty tough on him.  Small sample size, but so far this year his defensive metrics have improved"
CHICubs,3ayjyh,prime416,-9,Wed Jun 24 20:33:58 2015 UTC,"hes an awful CF. below average, really."
CHICubs,3ayjyh,Doogolas33,0,Wed Jun 24 16:41:30 2015 UTC,"No, he's actually been close to neutral (slightly positive) in CF this year. So it turns out his problems in past years may have just been positioning/coaching related. That, or defensive metrics are BS."
CHICubs,3ayjyh,Sparx7,7,Wed Jun 24 17:12:30 2015 UTC,"He takes really bad routes. He makes up for many of them by being exceptionally fast.   He's pretty much OK. But man, he takes some of the worst routes I have ever seen."
CHICubs,3ayjyh,Doogolas33,2,Wed Jun 24 17:21:02 2015 UTC,hes also been better since maddon started him playing deeper so less running back on balls
CHICubs,3ayjyh,Sparx7,3,Wed Jun 24 17:28:14 2015 UTC,"His routes aren't an issue on balls over his head. His routes are awful on balls in front of him. He basically runs straight sideways, sometimes even back a bit, before he takes a step in. They're the most ridiculous circutious looking routes possible."

With Fowler in the outfield, they can learn from Fowler. Plus he hits from both sides of the plate. Bryant has made Luis a thing of the past as well. Not bad."
CHICubs,3ayjyh,object_on_my_desk,2,Wed Jun 24 22:01:43 2015 UTC,Baxter and Coghlan are 30-year-olds. I don't think they have anything to learn from Fowler.

CHICubs,3aynqd,sjrossman0,22,Thu Jun 25 13:41:46 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think this is a poorly written article. Rogers is right that Sale would be an awesome addition to this team - but he's so, so wrong on what we should give up to get him. He suggests trading Soler (or Schwarber), Baez, Szczur, Lake, Billy McKinney, and Torres - all at once. He says a six-for-one trade is reasonable. It's not. The Cubs are not so in need of starting pitching that they should trade away the farm. Good prospects are an invaluable asset, and it's not like the Cubs will be short of money this offseason to sign a big name or two. Spending money is good - spending people is bad."
CHICubs,3aynqd,binkysurprise,9,Wed Jun 24 15:45:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed. As much of a dream as Sale-Arrieta-Lester-Hammel would be, it's not worth trading away half the farm. Especially when you may still be able to land a great (not Sale level, but great) pitcher through FA.  There's no reason to sell out for this year. If we make a run, we make a run. If not, we are still loaded with young players who have then gained experience for the next 6-7 years."
CHICubs,3aynqd,thebaconfever,3,Wed Jun 24 16:02:53 2015 UTC,"A 6-for-1 trade wouldn't be unreasonable if only one blue chipper was dealt.  Are Szczur and Lake really all that valuable?  I wouldn't like to give up McKinney and Torres, but it wouldn't be that awful (realistically I think they would throw in Vogelbach instead of one of those two).  Sale is a top 3-4 pitcher and his contract is incredibly cheap.  He'd get a huge return in a trade.   FWIW, Dave Cameron of Fangraphs proposed a trade where the White Sox would trade Sale and Melky Cabrera's expensive contract to the Cubs for Schwarber, Baez, and Alcantara.   I wouldn't make the trade if I was either team, though.  We can afford to sign Price next season.  And it would be devastating for the Sox's already low fan base morale to trade away their best player to their crosstown rival.  Honestly I'd feel kind of bad about taking him haha.  It still is nice to think about- since his contract is so cheap, we could still afford to sign Price next year.  Then our rotation would look like:   Sale Price Lester Arrieta Hammel"
CHICubs,3aynqd,Tjagra,3,Wed Jun 24 17:13:40 2015 UTC,"If Arrieta stays to form and Hammel remains ""Jason ""I don't know what a walk is"" Hammel"" that is an absolutely sick rotation."

CHICubs,3aynqd,Loop_Within_A_Loop,3,Wed Jun 24 20:01:13 2015 UTC,"Players no one should care about dealing Lake/Szczur, two guys fighting for the right to be called a legitimate ""5th outfielder"".

CHICubs,3aynqd,stackshot,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:31:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know if he necessarily has a future on the Sox tho. First base is spoken for for years to come, and is a dedicated DH really that valuable, to the point where it could be a major chip in a blockbuster trade?"
CHICubs,3aynqd,Neymanly,3,Wed Jun 24 18:08:10 2015 UTC,"No, none of them are major chips. That's the whole point.  Not one iota of difference comes from trading Lake/Szczur/Vogelbach. They are middling prospects. They add minor value, so they'd be able to throw as many as it takes and it wouldn't ""sell the farm"".  (Too many Cubs fans overrate Vogelbach. The guy may not even have 20 HR-pop...for a pure DH? That ain't gonna fly, people.)"
CHICubs,3aynqd,shamesock,2,Wed Jun 24 18:43:06 2015 UTC,"It would take a monster haul to land Sale.  I am sure the White Sox have their own versions of Lake and Szczur and would not be interested in them.  If I was the white sox GM I still don't know that I do the trade for the other 4.  If I was the Cubs GM I definitely would not do the trade.  I think the White Sox should build around Chris Sale, not use him to acquire talent."
CHICubs,3aynqd,Ragnar32,3,Wed Jun 24 17:29:56 2015 UTC,That is a strange package of prospects. I can't see the White Sox being interested in that particular grouping of players.   I personally think prospects are being overvalued in the modern game as GM's are becoming increasingly risk averse. I think it would behoove the Cubs to take advantage of this if given the opportunity to acquire someone like Sale.   Sale's contract is so friendly that it wouldn't preclude us from chasing Price.
CHICubs,3aynqd,zrk23,7,Wed Jun 24 16:35:59 2015 UTC,Sale-Price-Lester-Arrieta-Hammel would be a disgusting rotation.  Every game would be can't miss.  Sadly I don't think it's in the cards...  The price for Sale would be too steep

Good prospects are an invaluable asset   I mean, sure, but that doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't trade them. Part of the reason they're valuable is that they CAN be moved. The key to a farm is to keep adding every year. Being ranked the 1-3 best farm every year means nothing. We could probably make that trade and still have a top 15 farm."
CHICubs,3aynqd,Tjagra,2,Wed Jun 24 18:00:56 2015 UTC,Sale trade is not happening. White Sox have too good a core (Abreu/Eaton/Avisail/Sale) and upcoming potential aces in Rodon/Fulmer. They'll try to get rid of Melky/Robertson/Alexei/LaRoche/Shark and try again in a couple years.
CHICubs,3aynqd,prime416,3,Wed Jun 24 17:15:39 2015 UTC,"Eaton is trash and Garcia is OK this year: .266/.317/.389. Sale, Abreu, Robertson, and Rodon is really all they have right now as they need upgrades at C, 2B, SS, 3B, and at least one OF spot.       The White Sox have tried the middle road approach to roster construction (Not a complete rebuild but some trades and some free agents) and their performance this season is another example of how that way of doing things doesn't work. You need to take everything down, be bad, and focus on the farm before competing. Its a hard pill to swallow, but if you have a good GM and player scouting/development system around him then its the true path to sustained success. If I were the White Sox I would deal Sale and Robertson and get a boatload of prospects are shoot for competing down the road with a better lineup.       I don't think the Cubs can get him without Schwarber, Baez, or Underwood at least. If they were down for something like Alcantara, Vogelbach, McKinney, Edwards, Null I would do it, but that is probably not even close to being enough for a pitcher of his caliber."
CHICubs,3aynqd,Tjagra,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:09:23 2015 UTC,"Just because that approach worked for the Cubs and Astros doesn't mean it's the good/right approach.

It's a plan that is best for the team and the fans. Cubs fans aren't to being too ""forgiving"", because there isn't anything to forgive. Theo and co have done nothing wrong."
CHICubs,3aynqd,TheReturnofWerdna,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:45:55 2015 UTC,They only make the trade if the Sox think  Sale's arm is about to explode.
CHICubs,3aynqd,Sephiroth007,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:14:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think Kazmir is more of an option and considering how much less we would give up, a far better trade. He's only 4-4 but he has a 2.70 ERA. He is a lefty that could slide into the rotation, has experience and only 1 year left on the contract. He has the possibility of signing back on with a young team and a manager he is already familiar with which means we might get a good deal next year. If not, his contract is up so we are left in a position no worse off than we would be anyway. Considering he spent some time on the DL this year, he should be a steal."
CHICubs,3aynqd,Toastman04,0,Thu Jun 25 17:40:17 2015 UTC,The cubs would have to include Russell in the deal for Sale. The conversation starts with Russell.
CHICubs,3aynqd,Sephiroth007,22,Wed Jun 24 16:21:46 2015 UTC,And ends with Russell.  I'd hang up the phone
CHICubs,3aynqd,Toastman04,2,Wed Jun 24 16:24:07 2015 UTC,"You all want an ace, but don't want to give up what it would actually take to get one? Ok."
CHICubs,3aynqd,Sephiroth007,5,Wed Jun 24 17:50:41 2015 UTC,Yes we want an ace. Good thing there will be plenty next year on the market. Ones we don't give up the farm to do so
CHICubs,3aynqd,zrk23,2,Wed Jun 24 18:00:20 2015 UTC,There isn't a guarantee that the Cubs even get one of the big names out there.
CHICubs,3aynqd,Sephiroth007,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:34:58 2015 UTC,only if we dont want to. we have tons of money and cap space
CHICubs,3aynqd,zrk23,2,Wed Jun 24 18:52:45 2015 UTC,"Look at the giants in the off season. They were going to give Lester $170 million to sign there. And guess what, he didn't. Just because you have the money to do so, doesn't mean the player will sign with them."

CHICubs,3aynqd,Sephiroth007,2,Thu Jun 25 00:56:04 2015 UTC,Should've seen some of the offers in the thread earlier in the week.
CHICubs,3aynqd,THEriot2,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:06:23 2015 UTC,They were probably ridiculous ideas too.
CHICubs,3aynqd,achap39,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:35:26 2015 UTC,"Well, that's unreasonable. Not doing it and flat out not even thinking about it are two different things."
CHICubs,3aynqd,binkysurprise,0,Wed Jun 24 18:06:01 2015 UTC,"Not that the Sox would (or should) trade Sale, but here would be my offer:   Pick 1 of: Castro, Soler, Baez  Pick 2 of: Edwards, Tseng, Underwood, Turner, Wada, Black  Pick 2 of: Almora, Villanueva, Szczur, Contreras (catcher), Alcantara, Torres  ...plus Vogelbach."
CHICubs,3aynqd,Tjagra,2,Wed Jun 24 16:02:16 2015 UTC,"There is no chance in hell the White Sox would take that trade. EDIT: misread the bottom two lines and thought it was Pick 1 from each line.  Still think they would definitely turn it down and require at least one of Bryant, Russell, and Schwarber."
CHICubs,3aynqd,NicCage420,2,Wed Jun 24 16:51:46 2015 UTC,"Soler, Edwards, Underwood, Torres, Alcantara, Vogelbach could get it done I think. That's pretty much a majority of the Cubs best prospects remaining."
CHICubs,3aynqd,stackshot,-1,Wed Jun 24 20:13:07 2015 UTC,"Depending on what the deal is, I'd make it. Sale's contract is ridiculously team friendly. Baez, Almora, McKinney, Edwards, Wada, Tseng, and Christian Villanueva is a package I'd be comfortable with."
CHICubs,3aynqd,zrk23,4,Wed Jun 24 15:53:41 2015 UTC,"If other teams still hold onto Almora's old value, trade him yesterday!"
CHICubs,3aynqd,Tjagra,-1,Wed Jun 24 17:32:56 2015 UTC,i THINK i could live with soler+vogelbach+schwar+almora for Sale/Melky
CHICubs,3aynqd,Sephiroth007,4,Wed Jun 24 19:01:46 2015 UTC,"Sale is one of the best players in the game, but I really really don't want to give up Soler and Schwarber. Those two pieces are really key parts of the lineup going forward, and they can just buy Price next offseason."

CHICubs,3awaj9,cubshound,2,Wed Jun 24 14:19:15 2015 UTC,You are correct.  I was speaking of Steiner and to a lesser extent Orel and Nomar.
CHICubs,3awaj9,kkingprior,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:43:22 2015 UTC,Gotcha.  I only know Scully as the voice of the Dodgers.  I was at the game so I didn't hear any announcers.

CHICubs,3awaj9,disposableassassin,2,Wed Jun 24 19:36:01 2015 UTC,Vin Scully is a national treasure and I hope he some how finds the source of immortality so that all can hear his beautiful voice call baseball.
CHICubs,3awaj9,Bison66,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:38:48 2015 UTC,Seriously.  Watching/listening to Scully is a cathartic experience.  I wish he was nationally broadcasted sometimes.

CHICubs,3awaj9,kkingprior,0,Wed Jun 24 04:15:36 2015 UTC,It bothered me that he didn't get kicked out.  It further bothered me that he instead is being glorified by the media for it.  I'm ready for your downvotes.

CHICubs,3awsw6,Gewehr98,8,Wed Jun 24 03:49:29 2015 UTC,"I saw that and was laughing my ass off. That is some shit a 12 year old little league would do.   Hey guys, look, I'm gonna put this bucket over my head haha watch us win now!   WEEEEEEEEEEEEEE I TOOOOOLLLLDDD YOUUUUU SOOOOO"
CHICubs,3awsw6,jkthomasfan,5,Wed Jun 24 04:59:50 2015 UTC,"I think it was actually Rizzo and Bryant that started it, but he has carried the bucket torch, so to speak, with every walk-off since then. The way everyone seems to just love playing the game is one of the many reasons I love this team."
CHICubs,3awsw6,fightintxag13,25,Wed Jun 24 06:31:47 2015 UTC,Back-to-back wins vs Kershaw and then Greinke is fucking awesome!

CHICubs,3awsw6,Ganesha811,7,Wed Jun 24 03:50:05 2015 UTC,And the damn Pirates too. We're all 7-3 in the last 10.
CHICubs,3awsw6,SpoonThief,18,Wed Jun 24 04:56:56 2015 UTC,"It really is striking the difference in mentality in this year's team. Even as Greinke was mowing people down, I thought we would win. I haven't had that feeling and confidence in many a year. Same with last night's game. Kershaw pitching and starter goes down? Last year's team would have simply imploded. I'm really getting to love this team."
CHICubs,3awsw6,EamusCatuli08,4,Wed Jun 24 03:23:08 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree more.

CHICubs,3awsw6,big-mo,3,Wed Jun 24 03:51:30 2015 UTC,"When Rizzo said at the beginning of the year ""Why not us?"" I was like ""Take it easy, Tony, you haven't even made the playoffs yet."" But now, it's starting to feel different. Like it was in 2007 when they turned the corner after Aramis's walk off winner. Like, this team just refuses to quit. I really think that 3 teams from the NL Central could make the playoffs."
CHICubs,3awsw6,frastmaz,2,Wed Jun 24 04:09:01 2015 UTC,"I can see them starting to build confidence in themselves and it's a great thing. They are growing right before our eyes and this season...although still relatively young, feels like we could make a serious run at the playoffs. I agree with all of what you said."

CHICubs,3awsw6,big-mo,6,Wed Jun 24 03:27:01 2015 UTC,"It's pretty much what they did for the game highlights they posted. It's basically Greinke striking out Russell and Bryant, Hammel doesn't even make an appearance on the reel.

CHICubs,3awuw1,Solleret,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:27:57 2015 UTC,Reserve spot? Those aren't voted though
CHICubs,3awuw1,ilovelamp42,3,Wed Jun 24 05:44:57 2015 UTC,"Right, managers and players choice but it's not even a question that Goldschmidt will start.   I was thinking of r/baseball's fwar rankings vs the leaders: Rizzo should be the reserve but not according to fans, not by a long shot. Also I wonder if manager decisions are influenced by votes at the end of the day anyhow on comparable players like Rizz and Gonzalez."
CHICubs,3awuw1,Solleret,3,Wed Jun 24 06:08:25 2015 UTC,He's been the third best offensive player in the NL this year and arguably one of the top 5 most valuable players in the NL.  You're right that he won't get voted in but there is absolutely no excuse for him not being picked as a reserve.
CHICubs,3awuw1,Sofnr,4,Wed Jun 24 07:16:43 2015 UTC,Unpopular opinion time:  Don't vote for any Cubs. Let them have some time off to recharge for the second half.
CHICubs,3awuw1,groovemonkeyzero,2,Wed Jun 24 15:15:17 2015 UTC,Screw that. Get a few players into the all star game and itll drive home the idea that theyre actually good into their heads
CHICubs,3awuw1,LegacyLemur,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:00:00 2015 UTC,"I think they know they are good, and missing out on the ASG might just piss them off into playing harder. That being said, I do really hope we get some decent representation so the game is fun to watch.  I think we ultimately end up with Rizzo, one of Hammel/Arrieta, and maybe Bryant with an outside chance."
CHICubs,3awuw1,milksteaklover,2,Wed Jun 24 20:55:32 2015 UTC,"My unpopular opinion: I have trouble voting for Kris Bryant. He is tearing it up, sure, but I can't do it when Nolan Arenado was in 4th last I saw. No way I think Carpenter should start. I'm not saying it because he is a Cardinal. I would start Arenado, Bryant, or Frazier over Carpenter right now. I really feel Arenado is the best 3rd Baseman in the National League. He can hit and man can he field. I did vote for KB a few times to try to take it away from Carpenter, but I really feel Arenado should start. If I had to pick 2, Arenado starts, Bryant is the reserve. With 3, Frazier makes it due to the HRs and the ASG being in Cincy."
CHICubs,3awuw1,weatherninja,5,Wed Jun 24 22:14:44 2015 UTC,"Paul Goldschmidt deserves to start, not Rizzo."
CHICubs,3awuw1,HerbieVerstinks,3,Wed Jun 24 11:03:53 2015 UTC,Absolutely but Rizzo deserves to be a reserve and not snubbed completely.
CHICubs,3awuw1,LtDarien,2,Wed Jun 24 14:30:24 2015 UTC,Fan votes have nothing to do with reserves.  They only decide the starters.  There's no doubt in my mind that Rizzo will be an All-Star.
CHICubs,3awuw1,Sofnr,3,Wed Jun 24 16:31:16 2015 UTC,For sure.  It's still been a pretty pathetic showing from Cubs fans though when he's fifth in the voting.

CHICubs,3ax0i1,Cohaagan,4,Wed Jun 24 05:20:33 2015 UTC,I remember having many debates (especially with a poster named Kyle) circa 2013 that the Cubs farm system was indeed crap and that a complete overhaul was far more beneficial than adding on some expensive free agents.

CHICubs,3ax0i1,Space_Joust,3,Wed Jun 24 05:31:45 2015 UTC,That's not entirely true. I was having this discussion with a friend yesterday about how the team had a lot of debt (and still does to an extent) that limited what they could spend on free agents. Check out this article. I found it interesting to re-read it mostly because things looked so bleak even two years ago.

CHICubs,3azh1y,slicebishybosh,11,Wed Jun 24 19:14:40 2015 UTC,"I just don't see how the Sox make this trade. Schwarber has to be included, obviously. I feel like they would want Bryant or Russel in return also. Bryant isn't going anywhere. I also highly doubt Russel is leaving. Schwarber + Baez doesn't get it done for a 26 year old pitcher whose under a very team friendly deal for 3 more years."
CHICubs,3azh1y,Bob2456,10,Wed Jun 24 19:54:28 2015 UTC,"THIS is the best response and please (not to be a turd) let's put this whole topic to rest.  It doesn't make sense for either team.  The Cubs won't, and shouldn't, give up what the Sox would require, and rightfully so, in this trade.  Plain and simple, the trade just doesn't work perfectly for both sides and when you are dealing with franchise-changing players these types of trades have to be perfect for both parties."
CHICubs,3azh1y,run__BMC,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:29:02 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Bryant is off limits, so the trade starts at Schwarber + Baez + Russell and goes from there. Elite young cost-controlled pitchers don't get traded for a reason."
CHICubs,3azh1y,thejazzmarauder,5,Wed Jun 24 20:24:26 2015 UTC,"A couple things:  First of all, I am all aboard the Sale train. I think the Cubs should pull out (almost) all the stops to get him, and I actually think there's a really good match. The Sox need ML depth, and they're especially weak on cost-controlled majors-ready up the middle players, where the Cubs are strong. The Cubs have the players to trade for him and the money to take on a bad contract or two. Sale is an iconic, transcendent pitcher, and the Sox would be nuts to trade him if they had any chance of competing in the years they would have him. Unfortunately, they are terrible right now, and even if they play like a slightly above .500 team the rest of the way, they are still almost assured of landing in the cellar. I know most Sox fans hate the manager and GM right now, but I actually like what Hahn has tried to do. The Sox can never be sure if the fans will come back after a full rebuild like the Cubs, so Hahn has scrounged for value and he's been pretty successful with guys like Eaton, Abreu, Quintana, even Garcia.  The problem is that the Sox have no depth anywhere in their system, and if (when) anyone on their team under-performs or gets injured, there's no redundancy anywhere. This is a flaw that, as the Cubs saw these last five years, takes years to fix. Shortcuts like Cabrera, LaRoche and Samardjiza are high-risk and expensive, and there's not much reason for optimism that they have money to try the same kind of thing this offseason, much less that it will work. After all, they tried it already and have so far fallen flat on their face. So while they have 2-3 of the top assets in baseball by value relative to contract, and a few decent complementary pieces, they have to roster about 10 replacement-level players for the foreseeable future. That kind of team almost guarantees that Sale will be pitching for at least the next couple years in front of a team with .500 upside. At the very least, they will likely struggle through the end of 2016, when Danks and LaRoche come off the books. That's two years of a premium pitcher wasted, leaving you only two years of good value if you somehow manage to right the ship in that time. Not impossible, but difficult. So even if Sale is a Cy Young quality pitcher for the next four years, at best the Sox get two years of a useful Cy Young quality pitcher. Sale's value is higher to almost every other team that has a chance of competing in that timeframe.  I don't want to get into the sentimentality of hanging on to the franchise player or putting butts in the seats, because frankly I don't know how to evaluate that, nor do I know how the Sox feel about it. From a baseball operations standpoint, it makes total sense for the Sox to both be looking to diversify their assets, and get players who will be in-prime under control in 2017 and beyond, when they have a legitimate chance to compete long-term in that division. From the last time this was brought up, I worked out Sale has a value of Castro-Baez-Schwarber, but looking at that again, I'm not sure Schwarber isn't reaching untouchable status on the same level as Bryant and Russell. Maybe Soler instead...  By the way, I think anyone who thinks the Cubs would have to trade Bryant or Russell for Sale is sorely mistaken. I think there is a really good argument to be made that both those players are more valuable than Sale straight up. If it were 4 years of Bryant or Russell for 4 years of Sale, it would be much different, but instead it would be 3.5 years of Sale for 6.5 years of Bryant or Russell. You'd have to believe that Sale's average season would be almost twice as good as Bryant's or Russell's average season for that to make any sense at all, even without the injury risks inherent to every pitcher. To me that's nuts. From what we have seen so far this season, it's not out of the question that Bryant and Russell will reach the level of Sale, much less half that level. The only questions about those guys was how they would hit major league pitching, and so far they have held their own as young players. And even if you disagree and think those guys are worth trading for Sale, there's no chance the Sox are getting much else in a return, which means that the Sox are back at square one -- a core of elite talent with no depth to support it."
CHICubs,3azh1y,gniketan,3,Wed Jun 24 21:53:31 2015 UTC,That trade would start with Schwarber + Baez.

Sale is the best pitcher in the AL. That doesn't mean a guy who plays 1/5th the season is worth the whole damn team.

CHICubs,3ax3c3,tjb122982,9,Wed Jun 24 05:03:25 2015 UTC,"http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=18104   The correlation between overall record and record in games decided by three or more runs is .86. The correlation between overall record and record in games decided by one run is .40. The difference in correlation strength is partly due to how many more three-run games there are than one-run games, but luck plays a large role. Is it mostly ​luck? I'd prefer to put it like Matt Kory did in his response to Kreylix: ""I think that scoring runs and preventing runs are skills. But the closer a specific score gets the more random variation can affect the outcome.""   That said, we are playing far more competently this year. Luck might have something to do with it, but you also need to be able to capitalize on those opportunities.   On the flipside, last year, if we were down by 1 run going into the ninth we lost every single time -- while you usually don't win those games teams usually turn a few around -- that 100% loss track record was not mere bad luck."
CHICubs,3ax3c3,Solleret,4,Wed Jun 24 06:01:27 2015 UTC,"So long as we keep winning and playing our opponent with the same caliber as they bring to us then we should be in good hands. Side note, why put S's after all the Sox names? The X makes them plural already."
CHICubs,3ax3c3,JosePajamas,4,Wed Jun 24 05:48:33 2015 UTC,"In our division we need every win we can get just to get to the play in game. Of course it helps to win those close ones even if the World Series winners recently have struggled at doing just that. Even if I'm wrong, it's fun to watch us be clutch, right? Deno today, maybe Baxter tomorrow, probably Castro on the next one, winning is fun no matter how it happens."
CHICubs,3ax3c3,Cohaagan,2,Wed Jun 24 06:03:11 2015 UTC,"In my opinion walk-off wins or wins in the 9th or later on the road are probably pretty random. The margin for error is so small, especially on the road, so those probably won't predict future success. But if the bullpen is able to hold on to leads in the late innings that could explain the success in one run games. This would bode well for the team in the future."
CHICubs,3ax3c3,Iron_Mike0,2,Wed Jun 24 12:24:52 2015 UTC,"As someone posted, no. It won't help us in the long run, except that they're wins that we have that can't be taken away from us."

CHICubs,3ax3c3,Doogolas33,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:14:08 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I don't think they have a never say die attitude more than any other team. They just have talent. It's easy to look like you never give up when you are actually able to score runs, and thus make comebacks. When you have a bunch of easy outs, that's basically impossible."

He's got some pop.  He's hit pretty much everywhere he's played.  Tons of upside.  And his name is Addison...  ;)"

CHICubs,3b110y,voidecho,3,Thu Jun 25 03:28:03 2015 UTC,Addison Russell will be a stud. He's already playing well after essentially skipping AAA. Not everyone is Kris Bryant or Joc Pederson.
CHICubs,3b110y,octobadger,2,Thu Jun 25 17:06:03 2015 UTC,"Sure I'll jump on this one. Russell has shown the skills to be an excellent defensive middle infielder, raising his floor to something like an average overall player, especially if it translates to shortstop. He passes the eye test and the statistical test for his defense in a limited sample.  He also, despite the strikeouts, has been something like a league-average overall offensive player (not just for second base). This is encouraging for multiple reasons: first of all, he never had a significant strikeout profile in the minors, which gives much hope that he'll improve in that regard; secondly, a league-average offensive shortstop with good defensive skills is a tremendous asset (see Escobar, Alcides or Aybar, Erick); thirdly, there is significant hope that as a 21-year-old seeing the league for the first time with a track record of minor league success, he is a great bet to improve on offense.  Finally, he has a track record of being a top prospect at a premium position. He doesn't seem to have one particular standout tool, but he is way above average at everything, and although scouts are wrong all the time, prospects at the level of Russell have significant chance of developing into stars, especially because Russell in particular has so many tools to tap into.  All combined, Russell has a lot of room for growth and a lot of reason to believe he will actually harness that potential."
CHICubs,3b110y,gniketan,-7,Thu Jun 25 03:57:05 2015 UTC,Didn't Darwin Barney do more defensively?
CHICubs,3b110y,gniketan,8,Thu Jun 25 04:36:09 2015 UTC,And Manny Ramirez did more offensively but there's always a balance.
CHICubs,3b110y,TooLebowski,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:43:28 2015 UTC,"Darwin was more consistent for the 2 1/2 years he was starting.  He's had just 24 errors in his 5 years in the Majors, 20 if you don't count his trip in the minors last year.  Barney was also 25 his rookie year, 4 years more experience in the field than Rusell.  He's had very little time to adjust to 2nd.  The more contact he sees the better he'll be able to read the ball off the bat and the rhythm of the bounces.  I fully expect Russell to be competing for a gold glove in the next year or two."
CHICubs,3b110y,NLRD,2,Thu Jun 25 05:15:25 2015 UTC,What if I told you in 2 years he will be a good defensive shortstop hitting .280/.360/.475?  That is his 50th percentile projection and that would make him one of the 2 or 3 best shortstops in the majors.  Lets not get too down on a 21 year old striking out a little too much.

His post when he took over at /r/cubs, among other things (going to voat.co and locking up all cubs-related domains, removing all /r/CHICubs-related posts) make a re-unification seem really unlikely.   Too many people are happy here for /r/cubs to really make a comeback, but the mods of /r/cubs will not let it die.

To most of us, that's a sign that it should be let go, but to them...well, it appears they're happy to hold on to their kingdom. The mods rationalized and justified not closing up shop for several reasons back in April, none of which were compelling to me (e.g., people want to go back and look at old content).

Afterwards, he would shoot a very quick and menacing look to home plate.  Good stuff.  PS - I can't get on youtube at work otherwise I'd post the clip."

If no one gave a shit about them, you wouldn't have the three largest media companies (CBS, Tribune, Cumulus) in Chicago trying to get the rights to their broadcasts.

CHICubs,3aw543,friendlyconfines,2,Wed Jun 24 03:15:09 2015 UTC,"During the Fielder and Pujols free agency hoopla, I did a review of all free agents from 2007ish through the year prior to see how everything broke out.  Players on 6+ year deals were ok.  Something like 8 or 9 mil per WAR.  Skewed by guys mid-contract. Players on 3-5 year deals averaged negative WAR over their contract. Players on 1-2 year deals were the money train.  It was something nuts like $4-5M per WAR.  All free agents averaged $11M per WAR they actually gave to their team.  I checked in the next two offseasons and the trends held.  In the end, teams do best when they have a balance of internal prospects, traded for players and free agents.  AND STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM GUYS THAT WANT 3-5 YEAR DEALS.  TLDR: Edwin Jackson was a classic 4-year contract free agent...he sucked."
CHICubs,3aw543,illini211,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:14:01 2015 UTC,"I pulled some data on salaries and current record as of today. Obviously, it's not a full season, but we're looking at a solid set of data for these teams. There's really not a significant advantage for the big-market teams. Every $55 million in salary (linear analysis from lowest salary to highest) is worth approximately one victory. I guess at least it's not negative. There's some positive return, so there's that. But I'm guessing the Yanks and Dodgers were expecting more than an approximate 3 additional wins for spending ~$160 million more than the lowest market teams.  Look at the teams doing well right now. The top four teams are the Cards, Rays, Royals, and Astros. All teams built from the bottom up. By and large, not purchased in free agency.  Sure I wouldn't mind one more solid starter and a bullpen arm or two, but I'm really happy that Theo and Jed have spent the past few years focusing much more on incremental development rather than top-shelf splurges (Lester being the obvious exception)."

CHICubs,3asca5,yusuf69,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:12:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, with losses being the only thing to decide whether the belt stays or goes, it'll tend to stay in the bullpens for awhile, which isn't particularly interesting, especially since individual relievers can go weeks and months without taking a loss. Maybe have a blown save count as a loss for those purposes? I dunno."
CHICubs,3asca5,SenseiCAY,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:30:45 2015 UTC,i'd say just have it so that it has to be a starter that beats you for the belt to move on. So if you get the L to a reliever its like a ND. Otherwise you're right it'll forever be lost in the bullpen.

CHICubs,3asca5,dewgazi,6,Tue Jun 23 03:01:54 2015 UTC,Nah. I think split screen of deadly storm coverage and the game is a good compromise.
CHICubs,3asca5,kowalofjericho,2,Tue Jun 23 03:10:08 2015 UTC,I didn't even get storm coverage. They started an episode of How I Met Your Mother and never returned to the game. Thankfully it is child's play to pirate MLB.tv feeds.
CHICubs,3asca5,GIassHalfFull,3,Tue Jun 23 04:23:09 2015 UTC,where i am at there was no splitscreen and they cut to a weather break and then came back (around 6th inning mind you) from that and put on fucking Law and Order SVU.  I am pissed.
CHICubs,3asca5,hedonistic,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:30:25 2015 UTC,"Disagree. No need for them to cover that for an hour. If you're actually in danger, you shouldn't be watching the TV anyways. Say what counties are in the path, give the basics, tell people to seek shelter, and go back the game. 1 hour of repeating the same nonsense is totally unnecessary and only works to scare people...and annoy those of us that want to watch the game.  It wasn't split screen for the vast majority of the hour that WGN usurped the game.  And ""deadly"" storm coverage...maybe. You certainly don't know that yet."
CHICubs,3asca5,dewgazi,4,Tue Jun 23 03:30:40 2015 UTC,It's just a baseball game. In June no less. Some things are just more important than baseball.
CHICubs,3asca5,kowalofjericho,3,Tue Jun 23 04:00:12 2015 UTC,Yeah that still satellite image of the storm sure saved my life.  I don't know how I'd have survived without all the testimonials from people weathering the storm.
CHICubs,3asca5,IDCimSTRONGERtnUinRL,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:56:40 2015 UTC,"They literally had a guy from the sticks on tv saying ""there's not much going on out here."" If you think that is more important than baseball, I don't know what to tell you."

CHICubs,3asca5,kowalofjericho,-1,Tue Jun 23 11:57:37 2015 UTC,"Again, I disagree. There is no need to cover that for an hour. Tell people to seek shelter in the appropriate counties and move on. If you're actually in danger, you shouldn't be watching TV anyways. 1 hour of coverage on this is just fear mongering by the media. We can keep going back and forth if you like.  No one's priorities are out of line. No one doesn't care about humans more than baseball. So stop with the drama.  Edit: That ""source"" that you posted as proof of your correctness: 1) doesn't properly describe WGN's coverage last night, 2) misconstrues the severity/lack of of the weather by the tweets it cherry picked to post and 3) just isn't credible over all.

Then, the best record would play the worst division winner.   Then, they did away with all that when the Wild Card game was put into place. The best record always plays the winner of the WC game now. Baseball's always considered the WC the worst team because they were unable to win their division. Now, they've got the extra hurdle of playing another game prior to the Division Series which was done in part to make it harder for the WC to win it all, but really to add in an extra playoff team in each league (and thus extra revenue for two teams and MLB). The whole situation could probably be set up more logically, but I guess it wouldn't be baseball if it made complete sense."

CHICubs,3au442,xconzo,7,Tue Jun 23 15:00:11 2015 UTC,Id rather go after Papelbon assuming we don't need to give up an arm and a leg for him.
CHICubs,3au442,md715fox,3,Tue Jun 23 16:03:42 2015 UTC,"We'd have to give up way to much to get him, especially considering it'd be a divisional trade.  I still think Papelbon should be the number 1 target for any bullpen help, and we may not even need him."
CHICubs,3au442,Pupienus,3,Tue Jun 23 16:00:49 2015 UTC,"I would be more concerned with our Starting Pitchers, the bullpen seems to be balancing out."
CHICubs,3au442,modesthouse,2,Tue Jun 23 16:58:24 2015 UTC,"Looking at the recent trade of Craig Kimbrel:     Braves Get Padres Get    Cameron Maybin Craig Kimbrel   Carlos Quentin Melvin Upton   Matt Wisler (34, 52, 41)    Jordan Paroubeck    2015 41st overall pick (Austin Riley)     Essentially the Braves traded Craig Kimbrel for Upton salary relief and a top-50 pitching prospect.   I'd assume Chapman's value is close to Kimbrel's. maybe slightly higher.  Assuming all players currently in the majors (and Schwarber) are off limits, that means the Cubs would likely be giving up something like Baez plus one of Edwards/Almora/McKinney/Torres/Underwood plus a lower level guy or two. If the Reds are looking to actually rebuild, taking on Brandon Phillips' contract would help things.   My most even trade: Baez + Underwood + Villanueva for Chapman.   Odds are, however, the Reds will be looking for more like MLB-ready talent, which I doubt the Cubs part with."
CHICubs,3au442,SwedishLovePump,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:11:02 2015 UTC,"Don't forget the trade deadline premium.  Edit: Thinking about it, I don't think there'd be much difference. Chapman may be in more demand at the deadline than Kimbrel early in the season, but the Padres were also doing whatever they needed to make a move. I'd say they cancel out basically.  I'd say your offer is pretty fair. No clue if I'd do it. I am leaning, and traditionally would, towards no (or even no way), but having a light out guy and bumping everyone else in the 'pen down one slot could be huge in the postseason as the Royals proved again."
CHICubs,3au442,THEriot2,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:18:36 2015 UTC,But what about Theo magic?
CHICubs,3au442,Sparx7,4,Tue Jun 23 18:24:41 2015 UTC,Chapman for Schlitter and  Valakia.
CHICubs,3au442,THEriot2,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:39:10 2015 UTC,and we'll throw in  Ejax while paying for his salary so they can have him start  and lose them games.  Then they get a higher draft pick....why wouldn't they agree to that?
CHICubs,3au442,Sparx7,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:46:18 2015 UTC,"If they're trying to lose/rebuild, just listen to Theo."
CHICubs,3au442,THEriot2,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:03:35 2015 UTC,But Theo would lie to a division opponent.
CHICubs,3au442,Sparx7,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:08:22 2015 UTC,So he'd teach them to win?
CHICubs,3au442,SwedishLovePump,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:47:02 2015 UTC,"The more I look at it, the more i think it might be a slight overpay, but with the Reds middle-infield woes, I don't think there's any way we'd get out of this without giving up Baez."
CHICubs,3au442,THEriot2,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:28:02 2015 UTC,"Maybin, Wisler, Paroubeck, 41st pick for Kimbrel (Upton and Quentin effectively cancel each other out).  Baez, Underwood, Villanueva for Maybin, Wisler, Paroubeck, 41st pick. I favor our side a bit there, but I also favor Chapman to Kimbrel. I think it's pretty even.  I think you're right about Baez. We could probably get it done another way, but moving him would be likely in this scenario."
CHICubs,3au442,Sephiroth007,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:01:36 2015 UTC,IS there a chance? Yes. Will it happen? Probably not. I think the price could be pretty high. But I would be all for it depending on the price.
CHICubs,3au442,Badtz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:03:04 2015 UTC,"I know it's not unheard of for teams to trade within the division, but it just seems crazy that the Reds would trade Chapman to the Cubs. He's not a prospect, or a middle of the road starter.. he's a lights-out closer, and I would think they wouldn't want him staying in their own division."
CHICubs,3au442,Sparx7,2,Tue Jun 23 15:32:25 2015 UTC,I mean if they dont think hes gonna resign with them and think hes gonna try and go get paid at the end of the year they shouldn't care where he goes this year.  You take what you think is the best package since he'll be a FA anyways.
CHICubs,3au442,Oprah-Is-My-Dad,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:23:54 2015 UTC,No I really don't think so. The price tag would be high and it would be even higher for the cubs. I really doubt the cubs would be willing to part with good prospects for a reliever.

CHICubs,3au442,RustyDarkstar76,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:32:33 2015 UTC,"Nothing, people just like trades for the sake of trades it seams.  Trading for Chapman would be silly for a still developing team.    This is a trade you make in 2-3 years when the team is a known contender.  2015 is a bonus/transition year."

CHICubs,3au442,IBleedBlueBlood,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:49:32 2015 UTC,"I think, if anything, a move for Papelbon is most likely, either as a component of a Hamels trade or on his own."
CHICubs,3au442,SoonerJDB,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:52:50 2015 UTC,"As much as I love the hard throwing Chapman, where do you see him fitting into the Bullpen? Motte is really starting to show glimpses of his Cardinal days, Wood and Jackson are our long arms, we got Strop and Rondon with Motte at the end of the bullpen, as well as Russell... I don't think we're aching enough for another bullpen arm where we would have to give up prospects for him."

CHICubs,3ar5z3,Thetiredduck,3,Tue Jun 23 02:54:57 2015 UTC,I used to be indifferent towards the Sox. Chicago team. AL. Outside the crosstown why not pull for them? Then they won the WS and the fans here became unbearable and continue to be so. So now I love seeing the sox get throttled.

CHICubs,3ar5z3,Thetiredduck,14,Tue Jun 23 03:01:03 2015 UTC,"Not sure if someone answered what it means to play a game ""under protest,"" but here is the ELI5 version.   A manager may protest a game when he believes an umpire's decision has not adhered to the rules. You can't protest an umpire's judgment in calling someone out, strikes, balls etc., but you can protest the game when you think the umpire has misapplied the rules of the game. In order to lodge a protest, you have to tell the umpire before play resumes after the call which you think the umpire made in error.   So, what happens when you play a game under protest? You formally file it after the game.  If the MLB Commissioner agrees with you and upholds the protest, because the call hurt your chances of winning and you were correct that the umpire didn't follow the rules, the game will resume from the point where you initially lodged the protest.  If the Commissioner doesn't agree with you, you're SOL. If you win the protested game, you don't file the complaint after the game, as there is no point.   MLB Rule 4.19"

If the Cubs game wasn't on, they would already be back on regularly scheduled programs with a popup warning because after about 5 minutes of this shit, everyone would be on other stations to watch actual TV.   But...they know they got people hooked to watch the Cubs game in the split screen."

CHICubs,3apm3p,Sparx7,2,Mon Jun 22 14:37:31 2015 UTC,maybe he can become Marmol when he was good

The only time the Dodgers come anywhere close to Chicago with a day off is August 24...but that's the Cubs' makeup date with the Indians.  Even when the Cubs head to LA, they're playing in SF on a Thursday, then heading right back home for a Monday date with Cinci."

CHICubs,3an685,fightintxag13,2,Mon Jun 22 01:47:06 2015 UTC,"I could see CJ Edwards coming up sometime in the second half as well. Corey Black has had mixed results as a bullpen guy at AA, but he is an option as well, along with Armando Rivero if he can figure it out."
CHICubs,3an685,Tjagra,3,Mon Jun 22 04:15:31 2015 UTC,our closer
CHICubs,3an685,zrk23,2,Sun Jun 21 22:52:18 2015 UTC,nah
CHICubs,3an685,Oprah-Is-My-Dad,2,Mon Jun 22 01:02:10 2015 UTC,"Man, if the first video on this link doesn't just tell the story of our bullpen, I don't know what does. Ramirez getting hurt after 3 pitches, Schlitter called to the mound ..."
CHICubs,3an685,TheBostonPops,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:38:27 2015 UTC,RIP your chances of blowing leads puny senior circuit peasants.
CHICubs,3an685,dsalmon1449,2,Mon Jun 22 14:27:37 2015 UTC,Friends got on my account. Obviously I'm not suffering when Bryant hits two bombs n the Sox can't win a ball game.
CHICubs,3andus,Libertus82,7,Sun Jun 21 22:41:51 2015 UTC,"In the last 30 games (for each team), only 4 teams in the NL have a record above .500.  2 of those teams are 16-14. The goddamn Pirates and Cardinals are 11 and 10 games over .500.  Edit: This would have been before today's games. Jesus mother-loving Christ"
CHICubs,3andus,friendlyconfines,4,Sun Jun 21 23:09:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know about anyone else, but whenever I read a stat starting with ""In the last xyz"", I just ignore the rest of it. I just do not have any trust in them at all because you know the number xyz was chosen to maximize the stat being presented."
CHICubs,3andus,cgiall420,5,Mon Jun 22 08:10:47 2015 UTC,"30 days is a month, so it's not as arbitrary as ""in the last 17 away games with left handed starting pitchers"""
CHICubs,3andus,Ceteris__Paribus,2,Mon Jun 22 12:03:56 2015 UTC,"yeah, round numbers are more satisfying. I don't know a quick way of checking this, but perhaps the info would look a lot different if you included teams who were exactly .500, or even a game below? Did a team that went 15-15 or 14-16 really have a much worse month than the one that went 17-13, especially if their record was better before the month? Why not look over 2 months? Or better yet, over the entire season?   I just hate randomly picked starting points and randomly picked levels of achievement. The guy with 499 HR, 1999 RBI, and a .299 BA are just as good as the one with 1 more of everything."
CHICubs,3andus,cgiall420,2,Mon Jun 22 12:23:55 2015 UTC,"Generally I'm the same way.  It's easy to find the beginning of what you want to find and report forward.  For this, though, it's me being lazy as B-Ref lists 7, 15, 30 game increments."
CHICubs,3andus,friendlyconfines,4,Mon Jun 22 16:47:38 2015 UTC,That's not true the Dodgers have the third best record.

CHICubs,3aobdm,fightintxag13,10,Mon Jun 22 04:33:20 2015 UTC,Nice day in Eugene.   How long before we start getting worried about Almora?
CHICubs,3aobdm,DezBryantsMom,8,Mon Jun 22 04:06:47 2015 UTC,"I am now concerned. He was OK in High A last year, and was great in A- the year before but since his call up to AA he has not performed well with the bat."
CHICubs,3aobdm,Ironicnamehere,5,Mon Jun 22 04:08:54 2015 UTC,"They are still trying to get rid of the whole, ""see the ball, hit the ball"" ideal. And maybe thats just who he is."
CHICubs,3aobdm,stackshot,2,Mon Jun 22 04:13:14 2015 UTC,"Almora's first 400 plate appearances over two years in AA are as bad as you can do offensively. It's worth taking note.  A .270 OBP is startling, enough to give pause to even his biggest supporter.  A .620 OPS over two years at AA, even while he's young for the league, makes you really lower expectations. No power, no walks, not making contact, no impact base-running.  A defensive replacement CF is a 5th outfielder, if you're lucky. Let's hope he turns things around next year. Another year in AA is in his future."
CHICubs,3aobdm,cheese-burger-walrus,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:46:34 2015 UTC,"Right now, I view Almora as an injury replacement guy.  I'd only want him as the 5th OF if you have a really strong bench otherwise."
CHICubs,3aobdm,shamesock,2,Mon Jun 22 14:33:04 2015 UTC,"He still has 3.5 months of baseball this year to play, and I think he will be fine. It is way too early in his career to worry about him. AA stats for a 21 year old aren't the most projectable to MLB comps.  Brett Gardner had a OPS of .670 his first taste of AA at 22. At 21 AJ Pollack had a .695 OPS in A ball. Lorenzo Cain had an OPS of .683 in A ball.  Even if he isn't Adam Jones or Andrew Mccutchen I think everyone here would be happy if he developed similarly to the other 3 CFs."
CHICubs,3aobdm,asovermann,5,Mon Jun 22 18:06:23 2015 UTC,"Nice bounce back day for Jimenez after and 0-9 skid! Really love that outing for Neil as well, hopefully he can keep it up and make a difference for the bullpen soon."
CHICubs,3aobdm,voidecho,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:44:49 2015 UTC,I read he started two double plays from the outfield in the first game of the year.
CHICubs,3aobdm,asovermann,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:39:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah he did, hearing really great things about his arm. Coming out reports had it at above-average which I suspect hold true since it is short-season ball. Impressive none the less!"
CHICubs,3aobdm,voidecho,2,Mon Jun 22 13:54:03 2015 UTC,"He gets a lot of comparison to Soler, however we need to be patient.  He's still five years younger than Soler."
CHICubs,3aobdm,voidecho,3,Mon Jun 22 14:38:33 2015 UTC,"When does Young start showing up on peoples' radars?    He's at .333 in over 400 minor league AB's.  Guess it's the lack of power?  Edit...By people's, I didn't mean you specifically.  I don't see his name anywhere....and spelling."
CHICubs,3aobdm,Cpt_Hook,7,Mon Jun 22 04:51:26 2015 UTC,"Well he was only drafted last year, and in the 14th round. He is a bit older (22) and hasn't hit any HRs yet."
CHICubs,3aobdm,FxStryker,5,Mon Jun 22 05:22:20 2015 UTC,"John Arguello (Cubs Den) seems to like him, and he's been right about several guys at that level."
CHICubs,3aobdm,iam2eeyore,3,Mon Jun 22 05:28:27 2015 UTC,With Schwarber headed down Olt has to be brought up. Trade one power bat for another.
CHICubs,3aobdm,FxStryker,2,Mon Jun 22 13:26:22 2015 UTC,Does Olt have any remaining options? If not then I suspect that he'll be up soon.
CHICubs,3aobdm,Aladdin16,7,Mon Jun 22 14:19:37 2015 UTC,"He has one option year left, but there is no point in playing him in the minors in my opinion. If he was going to be apart of a trade playing in the minors wouldn't raise his value."
CHICubs,3aobdm,chicagocubs04,2,Mon Jun 22 14:27:02 2015 UTC,"Why havent we given Mendy a shot to come up and hit off the bench yet? He might be hitting .267 in AAA, but he's shown some power. And I'd rather have him come up then Sczcur or Baxter (shudders)."
CHICubs,3aobdm,voidecho,3,Mon Jun 22 08:38:33 2015 UTC,Definitely would prefer him over Herrera

CHICubs,3an3r3,ChiCubsbot,44,Sun Jun 21 21:12:21 2015 UTC,Pick up a full game on both the Pirates and Cardinals AND save the bullpen heading into 7 games with the Dodgers and Cards? HELL. YES.
CHICubs,3an3r3,achap39,40,Sun Jun 21 21:18:32 2015 UTC,Can we take a moment to realize how amazing the Feldman for Strop and Arrieta trade was.
CHICubs,3an3r3,RyanB313,8,Sun Jun 21 21:34:11 2015 UTC,Is that really all we gave up? Just one Scott Feldman?!?!
CHICubs,3an3r3,YNWAintheUSA,13,Sun Jun 21 23:53:20 2015 UTC,Also Steve Clevenger.

CHICubs,3an3r3,jacksonvstheworld,2,Mon Jun 22 01:11:47 2015 UTC,"He's gotta improve at catching though. We could always stick him in the outfield, but as of right now I feel we have a better shot at winning with montero/ross behind the plate."
CHICubs,3an3r3,cubbsfann1,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:39:48 2015 UTC,It'll come with time. But I think he gets a bench role in the majors once the AAA season is over.

CHICubs,3an3r3,STUstone,7,Sun Jun 21 21:15:13 2015 UTC,First big league slump. He's just going to have to go 9-12 with 4 HRs against the Cards to break out of it...
CHICubs,3an3r3,Bleacherbum95,2,Sun Jun 21 22:38:27 2015 UTC,I don't know. I'd settle for 8-12 and 2HRs with a couple doubles.
CHICubs,3an3r3,Oprah-Is-My-Dad,8,Mon Jun 22 01:17:06 2015 UTC,I'd even settle for 14-14 with 14 HR's

CHICubs,3an3r3,DaBearsMan_72,11,Sun Jun 21 21:19:20 2015 UTC,"Well, that didn't take long for Rizzo to catch fire. Bad news being Bryant is now a bit cold. He'll find it again. Memory serves right he had a bit of a cold steak for like a week or so in AAA? Arrieta looked too god after that rocky beginning. Props to Maddon for seeing that."
CHICubs,3an3r3,sidekicksuicide,7,Sun Jun 21 21:46:07 2015 UTC,"Good news is our offense can put up 8 runs even with crucial players hitting cold. In years past, if a guy like Rizzo wasn't hitting...that was it."
CHICubs,3an3r3,DaBearsMan_72,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:57:34 2015 UTC,Oh absolutely! It's nice having that luxury of having good hitters throughout the lineup. No one batter has to carry the load by himself.

CHICubs,3an3r3,HotYoungTeen,2,Sun Jun 21 21:17:26 2015 UTC,Yeah. I felt the same. But he really settled in around the 4th/5th

CHICubs,3an3r3,Captain_019,3,Sun Jun 21 21:35:15 2015 UTC,Great game.   Anyone know what's going on with Schwarber. Maddon said that he was only called up because we had the DH for the past 2 series. Do you think he gets sent back down or he stays up because he has hit well.
CHICubs,3an3r3,erindizmo,8,Sun Jun 21 21:31:17 2015 UTC,They've reiterated over the past couple days that he's going back down.
CHICubs,3an3r3,Thetiredduck,4,Sun Jun 21 21:33:40 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure they were set on sending him back down to work on catching

When I said no (and told her that it was a player's name) she marched me down to the dean's office herself, berating me the whole way, saying how I was going to be suspended for wearing such offensive clothing.  My dean at the time, who was actually a well-known Sox fan, took one look at me, basically told the teacher that she was an idiot, and sent me back to class. One of the happiest and most satisfying moments of my life. I made sure to wear that shirt as much as possible in her class for the rest of the semester."

CHICubs,3alte8,Admiral_obvious13,5,Sun Jun 21 14:59:23 2015 UTC,I saw a Gary Gaetti jersey!
CHICubs,3alte8,MileyCyrus8,6,Sun Jun 21 15:54:05 2015 UTC,My friend has a Doug Dascenzo jersey which I still think is the worst Cubs jersey I've ever seen.
CHICubs,3alte8,Sparx7,3,Sun Jun 21 17:01:17 2015 UTC,"I love walking around Wrigley and every day I play a game I like to call ""who's purchase was the worst"" normally it's between fontenot and the riot but damn there are some bad ones"
CHICubs,3alte8,MileyCyrus8,5,Sun Jun 21 17:49:17 2015 UTC,Theriot qualifies as one that should be immediately burned. He's talked a lot of crap against us after he left. Fontenot was a decent player for a year and a half. My personal worst one owned is probably C Patterson. :(  My next jersey purchase will either be Arrieta or Russell
CHICubs,3alte8,youwantmooreryan,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:53:41 2015 UTC,Just ordered my Russell jersey today!
CHICubs,3alte8,jkthomasfan,5,Mon Jun 22 02:22:39 2015 UTC,I remember his first Cubs game like it was yesterday.. man I had all the faith in the world that he would one day be an MVP.   Remember that year when Wrigley were selling all of those bandannas with Japanese lettering on them? I bought like ten lol
CHICubs,3alte8,peteroh9,4,Sun Jun 21 18:26:19 2015 UTC,I remember he almost hit the cycle. God I was excited for him.
CHICubs,3alte8,cody82,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:30:12 2015 UTC,He was going to singlehandedly win the Cubs a World Series.
CHICubs,3alte8,Brodo-Swaggins,9,Mon Jun 22 05:20:04 2015 UTC,I got mine on clearance for $20.  2 days later he was traded.  Worth it.
CHICubs,3alte8,TyDeisel,4,Sun Jun 21 15:23:09 2015 UTC,"I tried to buy one recently at a Hanshin Tigers game in Japan. They didn't have any in stock, but I was able to snag a Matt Murton jersey."
CHICubs,3alte8,RustyDarkstar76,3,Sun Jun 21 23:39:27 2015 UTC,I have 2 of his jerseys. One of which has his name in Japanese!
CHICubs,3alte8,Barrylicious,3,Sun Jun 21 14:30:04 2015 UTC,The Japanese one would be cool!

CHICubs,3alte8,demerdar,3,Mon Jun 22 19:03:54 2015 UTC,I have a Chunichi Dragons Fukudome jersey.  There's probably like two of us.
CHICubs,3alte8,tgross25,4,Mon Jun 22 02:54:42 2015 UTC,I had a Fukudome T-shirt when I was in like 3rd grade and I remember wearing it to school one day and my bitch teacher literally made me take it off (luckily I had a shirt under it). I was so pissed.
CHICubs,3alte8,demerdar,8,Sun Jun 21 15:09:47 2015 UTC,I know this gets said a lot on reddit but reading your post reminds me that a lot of redditors on this sub and in /r/baseball are SO young.  I really need to keep that in mind.

CHICubs,3alze4,kleric42,8,Sun Jun 21 21:11:47 2015 UTC,Arrieta pitches a COMPLETE GAME SHUTOUT! The Cubs win 8-0!
CHICubs,3alze4,AtlasStarwind,4,Sun Jun 21 21:11:27 2015 UTC,What a great game!!
CHICubs,3alze4,Jollyman21,0,Sun Jun 21 21:11:21 2015 UTC,"Why in the hell is Arrieta still pitching? I understand wanting to get a CG, but when your pitcher has 110+ pitches going into the 9th in an 8-0 game you need to get him out of there."
CHICubs,3alze4,fender-b-bender,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:09:06 2015 UTC,I like it. Jake wasn't showing any signs of fatigue. And this lets the entire 'pen have a rest before this hard stretch of games coming up.
CHICubs,3alze4,leemill02,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:15:10 2015 UTC,Eight run lead means they had plenty of time to pull him if he started to flag.
CHICubs,3alze4,blazemongr,2,Sun Jun 21 21:14:48 2015 UTC,"He seemed to be fine, good velocity and control. I'm okay with it as long as it doesn't become a trend."
CHICubs,3alze4,BoringCode,2,Sun Jun 21 21:11:39 2015 UTC,I think he'll be fine it's not like he's throwing 120 every time he's out there
CHICubs,3alze4,Cubsfan5ever,2,Sun Jun 21 21:11:30 2015 UTC,"1 down, 2 to go!"
CHICubs,3alze4,Ganesha811,3,Sun Jun 21 21:08:59 2015 UTC,Can't believe Arrieta persuaded Joe to let him go back out there.
CHICubs,3alze4,Ganesha811,2,Sun Jun 21 21:08:39 2015 UTC,Fuck a pitch count!
CHICubs,3alze4,Dhash23,2,Sun Jun 21 21:07:55 2015 UTC,"Great game today, missed some of it mini-golfing. Started watching on my phone right as Fowler came up to bat.  Fantastic day all around."

CHICubs,3alze4,zrk23,-1,Sun Jun 21 21:04:58 2015 UTC,I doubt we'll see Schwarber the rest of the season.

CHICubs,3alze4,SiriuslyLupin,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:13:28 2015 UTC,I think he'll be back up when AAA ends.

CHICubs,3alze4,voidecho,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:03:17 2015 UTC,Medina will be the closer today for the Cubs.

CHICubs,3alze4,Ganesha811,3,Sun Jun 21 20:55:27 2015 UTC,Probably Medina. Try to get him back up to speed in a low-leverage situation
CHICubs,3alze4,fightintxag13,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:52:47 2015 UTC,apparently not lol

CHICubs,3alze4,Dhash23,2,Sun Jun 21 20:53:18 2015 UTC,I didn't realize there were critics of the quality start stat.

CHICubs,3alze4,cubswinagain,3,Sun Jun 21 20:57:33 2015 UTC,Rookies gonna slump.  Good thing everyone else seems fine.

CHICubs,3alze4,Dhash23,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:38:58 2015 UTC,I really hope they hold on to him.  Having his bat at catcher will make this lineup really scary for the next five-seven years.
CHICubs,3alze4,voidecho,2,Sun Jun 21 20:37:54 2015 UTC,It's not gonna happen. I think he's to valuable to trade after this
CHICubs,3alze4,Loop_Within_A_Loop,5,Sun Jun 21 20:35:01 2015 UTC,Who says that?
CHICubs,3alze4,Ganesha811,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:38:58 2015 UTC,"People on reddit, I think I've come across a few articles as well. It's because his catching is below average and with us already having 2 catchers and playing in the NL it makes sense in theory to trade him to an AL team that can better use him at the DH in exchange for something like pitching. However, I want to keep him."
CHICubs,3alze4,Dhash23,3,Sun Jun 21 20:36:18 2015 UTC,"Top of the lineup coming out, still nobody out!"

CHICubs,3alze4,Jollyman21,4,Sun Jun 21 20:30:29 2015 UTC,Haha Coghlan and Castro both thought that was out.

CHICubs,3alze4,zrk23,2,Sun Jun 21 20:29:34 2015 UTC,Gotta not jog Castro
CHICubs,3alze4,Kaner_95,3,Sun Jun 21 20:33:43 2015 UTC,Still had a chance to be caught
CHICubs,3alze4,Sparx7,3,Sun Jun 21 20:30:01 2015 UTC,Also gotta make sure it's not caught.
CHICubs,3alze4,voidecho,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:29:27 2015 UTC,Gotta call out Coghlan on that too if you're gonna call out Castro.

Starlin Castro can remain the aloof, subpar defensive shortstop who is a streaky hitter who can carry or sink a team and has a massive flair for the dramatic with a great sense of the moment. He is not perfect. One error does not sink his career but neither does one (or a collection) of big hits totally redeem him. As long as it's fair, which the criticism of his goof yesterday absolutely was, you're allowed to criticize your guys while still hoping they hit .400 and win MVPs.   I guess what I'm saying is that today isn't vindication for the pro-Castro camp nor was yesterday a validation of the anti-Castro group. Important to remember that we're all rooting for the same goal. Hope that made sense. Go Cubs."
CHICubs,3ajpda,TheFakeTimShady,6,Sat Jun 20 21:38:35 2015 UTC,"I agree. This is exactly the kind of day Castro needs to help move forward. He seems to thrive under pressure and struggle during the quotidian. He has shown that he is a better player once the calendar flips to July.   Does he deserve some criticism, sure. But I think he can be pretty hard on himself as well, which is why Joe said what he said today.  I also think even the most vehement Castro haters still want him to do well. There is no reason to create a schism over this when the team is finally playing well."

On a side note: I'm watching Max Scherzer tear the Pirates apart. So glad the Cubs missed him when they went to Washington. If only they missed him when they were in Wrigley as well.
CHICubs,3ajpda,jocman96,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:57:15 2015 UTC,SchWar Machine already has +0.3 WAR. Out of the 37 players who have been on the MLB roster this season Castro is 37th with a -0.6. :( I remember Alcantara being bad in his time with the major league team but I don't remember him being -0.4 in just 32 plate attempts bad. That's worse than Lake (-0.3) who had nearly twice as many attempts.

Not super baseball related but I have noticed that Lake and Alcantera are major dicks to kids. Szczur is super cool and Villanueva is tolerant and accommodating to the fans but never smiles. Dent has almost got into 2 scuffles with spike, round rocks mascot which was bizarre. Valaika is cool to the fans as well. I was just really disappointed in how Lake and Mendy acted towards not necessarily the adults but the kids. On a baseball related note, they've been smacking the shit out of the ball and have taken 2 games so far which has been fun to watch."

CHICubs,3ajn0x,pm_me_ur_pajamas,5,Sun Jun 21 02:45:24 2015 UTC,They had better get a long-term piece for him and not just a rental. I'd prefer to keep the bats and buy pitching but it isn't my money.
CHICubs,3ajn0x,iam2eeyore,3,Sun Jun 21 02:56:14 2015 UTC,This is how I feel.  Keep all of our best hitters and build a murderers row of bats at a relatively low price for the next five years and then buy pitching in the offseason.
CHICubs,3ajn0x,pm_me_ur_pajamas,2,Sun Jun 21 02:58:39 2015 UTC,I think he'll be part of a Cole Hamels package because he's the sexiest piece the Cubs will part with. I think a couple of pitchers and maybe Vogelbach will go too.
CHICubs,3ajn0x,iam2eeyore,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:06:05 2015 UTC,"There's probably only about 5 teams that would want Voglebach. One of the unfortunate things about trading for Hamels would be losing Hendricks. Hendricks probably isn't going to win a Cy Young award but he isn't terrible. The Phillies will want a MLB pitcher in return and they won't want Wada, Wood, or Jackson."
CHICubs,3ajn0x,pm_me_ur_pajamas,2,Sun Jun 21 03:19:01 2015 UTC,They could take Vogelbach and flip him to an AL team.   You'd have to give up extra strong pitching prospects to avoid giving up Hendricks.   I wouldn't give up Hendricks for Hamels given the drastically different salary. Just wait until the off season and sign Price - only lose a first rounder.

CHICubs,3aikhh,TheFakeTimShady,3,Sat Jun 20 20:38:00 2015 UTC,I'm not too concerned. They pitch him nothing but junk. He does the best that he can with junk to hit. As long as he shows continuous improvement I can't criticize.
CHICubs,3aikhh,theolereacharound,2,Sat Jun 20 20:32:58 2015 UTC,"He's a great hitter and that isn't going away but he's losing back foot leverage on his swings. I got into it with someone on here last week about it, it's just not a habit most good power hitters have."

I have a slightly bigger issue with him stepping down the third baseline, and being bent over like he was picking a nickle up off the sidewalk to lunge at a pitch outside.  His swing mechanics are what you see/want to see when a guy turns on an inside pitch,  hips flying open, getting around fast on it to get the head of the bat inside enough make solid contact.  Not the swing you want to see on a breaking ball on the outside black or further out.  :("

CHICubs,3aikhh,IONTOP,2,Sat Jun 20 20:28:38 2015 UTC,We have a wild card spot so I say just about right to slightly over achieving
CHICubs,3aikhh,cubswinagain,2,Sat Jun 20 20:31:17 2015 UTC,"Nice, I would hate to play you guys in the wildcard game, it seems like you can win greatly or lose horribly any game. (No offense)"
CHICubs,3aikhh,IONTOP,2,Sat Jun 20 20:27:33 2015 UTC,"Just about right, but it feels like we are underachieving."

I'm scared of you guys for the next 5 years though..."

CHICubs,3aikhh,ODB312,9,Sat Jun 20 20:31:57 2015 UTC,Diving to stop a ball is a boneheaded play now?!? Come the fuck on. This shit is getting ridiculous.
CHICubs,3aikhh,WhiteRabbit13,0,Sat Jun 20 20:21:37 2015 UTC,"i agree, that was a nice stop, going to be a tough play to make even if he gets a clean transfer. still castro's defense has not improved at all this year"
CHICubs,3aikhh,tbv93,4,Sat Jun 20 20:20:45 2015 UTC,"Getting pretty ridiculous in here. Call Castro out for the clear fuck ups, but if he breathes funny he's ragged on lately."

CHICubs,3akcot,Loop_Within_A_Loop,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:35:30 2015 UTC,Pretty much. You'd think they were Yankee fans with how much they talked about winning
CHICubs,3akcot,TandBusquets,6,Mon Jun 22 17:51:15 2015 UTC,"IMO, none.   Look at the offseason acquisitions before the 06 season: Bobby Howry, Jacque Jones, and the trade for Juan Pierre were the biggest deals with the biggest names. If they were going to be reactionary, they'd have done a lot more.   The Tribune Company was looking for a buyer and had bigger things to worry about than the Cubs at that point."
CHICubs,3akcot,achap39,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:15:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for a great response. My answer to the person who asked this was similar -- ""nothing"".  I do yet wonder if there was any wider cultural shift leading up to the current management."
CHICubs,3akcot,achap39,2,Sun Jun 21 02:27:46 2015 UTC,"I think enough time- and two owners- had passed in between 2005 and Theo/Jed taking over. You went from the Trib->Sam Zell->Ricketts, with three VERY different mindsets in the way of payroll. The Tribune wanted to keep payroll JUST high enough to make the team an attractive asset in the purchase. Zell bought it, and ramped up FA spending to make it even MORE of an attractive asset, knowing he was just going to 'flip' the team for a profit.   Enter the Ricketts, who, as fans, saw that this reckless spending was no way to have any sustained success.   IMO, none of that had anything to do with 2005."
CHICubs,3akcot,pm_me_ur_pajamas,5,Sun Jun 21 16:48:11 2015 UTC,Nothing.   Not even in the city of Chicago did it have any sort of impact other than annoying ass sox fans not shutting up. Even when you look at the next few years the Cubs were still the talk of the town. I remember a sox player whining about how nobody seemed to care about them and all the talk was always on the Cubs.

CHICubs,3ajfuk,asovermann,2,Mon Jun 22 17:46:16 2015 UTC,Maybe they go after someone like Brandon McCarthy? I was hoping for the Cubs to bring him on in addition to Lester.
CHICubs,3ajfuk,charles32915,2,Sat Jun 20 20:49:33 2015 UTC,I'm thinking they would have definitely made a more aggressive play at James Shields

CHICubs,3afj5q,prot18,16,Fri Jun 19 18:43:22 2015 UTC,"""On June 17, 2009, Farnsworth's left, non-pitching hand was bitten while he was breaking up a fight between two of his American bulldogs—Strike and Rambo. The cuts were deep enough to reach, but not cut, a tendon. Farnsworth later taped his finger, tucked it into his glove, and went to practice telling manager Trey Hillman that he could pitch. When asked which of his dogs bit him, Farnsworth replied: ""I don't know. I reached in there and started grabbing dogs and throwing dogs. And one of them got me. One of those things that happens. It's never pretty. I've had to do it a few times, and it's ugly."""
CHICubs,3afj5q,burts_beads,11,Fri Jun 19 18:50:31 2015 UTC,I never understood why he thought it was smart to charge that mountain of a man.

CHICubs,3afj5q,burts_beads,2,Sat Jun 20 02:24:06 2015 UTC,"He definitely proved that, lol."
CHICubs,3afj5q,TheQuixote,18,Sat Jun 20 02:31:49 2015 UTC,"12 years ago? Shit, I'm old.  The best part was the split screen they showed afterwards. Wilson all bloodied and beaten, and Farnsworth just smiling and having a great time. No contest, one of my favorite baseball fights.  But nothing will ever beat this one. Old man Nolan Ryan taking out young punk Robin Ventura. It's like watching Beethoven conduct the 9th Symphony."
CHICubs,3afj5q,pagelzz,3,Fri Jun 19 20:02:00 2015 UTC,"That's a good party story... ""one time I charged Nolan Ryan"""
CHICubs,3afj5q,inevitablescape,-4,Sat Jun 20 03:57:29 2015 UTC,That's total crap that Nolan got to stay in the game. He was throwing punches at Ventura and others
CHICubs,3afj5q,TheQuixote,15,Fri Jun 19 21:43:38 2015 UTC,"20 years ago they weren't so strict on that sort of thing. Back then, they played complete games, hit in both leagues, and sometimes on just a couple days rest.   It's gotten worse over the years too. Like Mordecai Brown, who won both games of a doubleheader three times - in one season. Or Ty Cobb, who use to chop wood in the off season for exercise. Or the Whiskey Kid, who used to clean the cuts from players sliding knees high while still on the field with a flask he kept on his person.  What was I talking about?  Oh yeah... Men used to play baseball. It was a game, and it was rough, and it was fun. Then, somewhere along the way, they became worth a metric fuckton of money and owners and managers got cagey. So now, why I'm certain the players are still tough as ever, they come off as looking like girl scouts because they need their five days rest, can't pitch because of a hangnail, or only go six innings. And you're not allowed to throw pitches because someone might get hurt.  That was a rant. It was building for a long time. I'm not going to edit this, although it needs it..."

CHICubs,3afj5q,Bersho,9,Fri Jun 19 23:16:36 2015 UTC,Easily my favorite sports fight of all time and probably a personal top 10 Cubs moment.  The fact that it came against the Reds is just icing on the cake.
CHICubs,3afj5q,voidecho,5,Fri Jun 19 19:23:58 2015 UTC,Agreed.....one of the best form tackles I've ever seen.

CHICubs,3afj5q,strongmenbent,3,Fri Jun 19 20:12:40 2015 UTC,Hahahaha I had never seen that. Thats hilarious. Zambrano is the best. You see someone is taking the fight too far and of course its Carlos. He gets dragged away from the pile and he's taking off his belt? Why? Who the fuck knows? To use it as a weapon? To whip out his dick? Could be anything but its Zambrano and I'm not at all  surprised.
CHICubs,3afj5q,pm_me_ur_pajamas,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:47:50 2015 UTC,"The reason why Zambrano didn't have his belt on is because he was changing shirts when the fight started. He was pitching that day and you'll notice it was in June, so it was hot and Z sweated so much that he needed a new undershirt.   It's pretty common for pitchers to change."

CHICubs,3ahgss,stackshot,2,Sat Jun 20 16:06:50 2015 UTC,"Castro is not going to make it at shortstop. Going on 6 years of sub-par defensive play, his error-prone habits are a part of who he is. (Normally errors are overrated, but he's a special case)  Offensively, he has a sub .300 OBP, a Darwin Barney-esque .640 OPS, and he's literally a below replacement player overall.  None of this is biased or impassioned, it's the truth.  I like Castro, but if this team makes the playoffs I do not want to see him manning Shortstop. Really hope they make the change this year."
CHICubs,3ahgss,RaveOn1958,4,Sat Jun 20 15:23:43 2015 UTC,Then they need to swap him with Russell.

Jean Segura's posted a combined .4 and -.2 WAR the past two years...and is 25. You think the Brewers are itching to ship him out?   There are a whopping SIX shortstops in all of MLB that are 25 or younger. HALF aren't putting up even a 1 WAR season so far. The average fWAR among them? 0.72.   You think the Brewers are itching to trade Segura...the Rangers to trade Andrus because of a bad half-season? Of course not. This idea that the Cubs should be all-in in 2015 with one of the least experienced rosters in MLB is utterly asinine."

CHICubs,3ahgss,dsalmon1449,-1,Sat Jun 20 18:18:18 2015 UTC,"He can't field, he hits for average but doesn't walk, and now he seems to have developed an attitude. He's plateaued. Sure he gets ""clutch"" hits, but if sabermetrics have taught us anything, it's that ""clutch"" is a fake stat. He's not worth anything more than playing second base and hitting in the 9 hole by the time we make the playoffs, whenever that may happen."
CHICubs,3ahgss,Harrolddilshore,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:01:07 2015 UTC,"He might not be clutch  because that's not a thing but it's not like he didn't get the hit. The hit counts. The rbi counts. Maybe some see it as ""clutch"" since the 'winning run' scored, whatever. that's them, but you can't sit there and say he can't field. Yes he misplays balls, but he also does make some very nice plays. His fielding floor is astronomically low, but his fielding ceiling is also very good. He looks like Andrelton Simmons one play then David Ortiz latterly the next. Plus it is very possible him hitting 9th actually helps the Cubs. So don't be so quick to just disregard that role either."
CHICubs,3ahgss,Gimmie_Dat_Stream,0,Sun Jun 21 01:22:36 2015 UTC,"I actually agree with your last point. I think that he is better than literally any bottom of the order hitting middle infielder in the game. He could provide a lot of value in that position. But, besides that, idk man."

CHICubs,3afb2d,Dailylife,2,Fri Jun 19 18:28:47 2015 UTC,The perfect picture.
CHICubs,3afb2d,StewartDuck,2,Fri Jun 19 20:31:51 2015 UTC,"Dear god, it's beautiful."
CHICubs,3aghdm,Tjagra,8,Fri Jun 19 23:22:30 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit surprised he didn't spend more time in AZ, but its a good sign! Starting off playing CF."
CHICubs,3aghdm,zrk23,2,Fri Jun 19 23:22:53 2015 UTC,"CF? wow. just what i wanted (its what we need!). hope he can play good D there, then we can package almora or him, depends on who does better ofensively, and get some arms!"
CHICubs,3aghdm,voidecho,2,Sat Jun 20 12:19:54 2015 UTC,Wouldn't we keep our CF prospects since we'll have a hole there after Fowler leaves?
CHICubs,3aghdm,shamesock,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:44:19 2015 UTC,"Interesting to see him in CF, looks like this is Mitchell's first game in RF as well. Have you seen Kevonte play yet? Does he still project as a CF or is this just one of those random Low A moves that I shouldn't read into?"
CHICubs,3aghdm,Gimmie_Dat_Stream,5,Sat Jun 20 21:41:41 2015 UTC,Holy shit that was fast
CHICubs,3aghdm,voidecho,3,Sat Jun 20 00:38:19 2015 UTC,And he already has his first hit.
CHICubs,3aghdm,pm_me_ur_pajamas,3,Sat Jun 20 03:14:57 2015 UTC,Jimenez is there too. No clue who any of the other guys are.
CHICubs,3aghdm,voidecho,2,Sat Jun 20 03:18:10 2015 UTC,He went 2-4 yesterday.
CHICubs,3aghdm,voidecho,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:33:22 2015 UTC,Saw that too.  Nice to see him finally show up in a box score so we can see how he's doing.

CHICubs,3ah0e2,ChiCubsbot,10,Sat Jun 20 02:32:19 2015 UTC,Welp. At least Rizzo is back
CHICubs,3ah0e2,AaronRodgers16,3,Sat Jun 20 02:32:47 2015 UTC,Yeah at least he showed up to play tonight.
CHICubs,3ah0e2,big-mo,8,Sat Jun 20 02:33:31 2015 UTC,Three one-hit innings from Edwin Jackson. I think he might be putting it back together.
CHICubs,3ah0e2,NicCage420,2,Sat Jun 20 02:38:59 2015 UTC,Almost out of the 'why is he on the team?' zone
CHICubs,3ah0e2,ilovelamp42,5,Sat Jun 20 03:31:30 2015 UTC,Better ERA than Strop or Motte thus far. Overpaid but useful.
CHICubs,3ah0e2,NicCage420,5,Sat Jun 20 03:38:12 2015 UTC,I was really hoping that after scoring 17 in CLE we could avoid playing like this for a little while...
CHICubs,3ah0e2,StewartDuck,3,Sat Jun 20 02:33:13 2015 UTC,Hughes ERA coming into this game: 4.79. OF COURSE he would kill it against us.
CHICubs,3ah0e2,zrk23,3,Sat Jun 20 02:36:38 2015 UTC,"Other than two Rizzo swings that game was pretty much a shit show.  Hope they bounce back tomorrow, but I'm not calling a 12'er again yet."

CHICubs,3ag1p5,ChiCubsbot,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:10:15 2015 UTC,"Castro is the dumbest player in major league baseball history.  I've been watching baseball for 28 years and of the times I've seen a player not facing the field during an at bat, not paying attention to runners in an obvious live ball situation, Castro owns about HALF of them. Pretty fucking impressive, kid. But hey, at least you're hitting like a good hitting pitcher so you can hang your hat on that."
CHICubs,3ag1p5,lincolnparknative,2,Sat Jun 20 08:17:25 2015 UTC,Gotta be the worst game of the year just awful gotta bounce back tomorrow

CHICubs,3ag1p5,big-mo,4,Sat Jun 20 02:05:32 2015 UTC,"Starlin ""below replacement level"" Castro."
CHICubs,3ag1p5,StewartDuck,-2,Sat Jun 20 01:58:54 2015 UTC,Just quit. Dude provides two walk offs in a row and he is great. Gets hit in the arm and half the people in this sub panic. At a certain point he is valuable or not. I think he is valuable with flaws and all.
CHICubs,3ag1p5,Restroom406,2,Sat Jun 20 02:24:24 2015 UTC,What? My post was essentially just stating a fact. He has been below replacement level this year.  Does me commenting on his overall play this year mean I can't be glad he got a couple walk off hits? Do those walk off hits mean he can play like a 5 year old in the field?
CHICubs,3ag1p5,StewartDuck,2,Sat Jun 20 02:30:34 2015 UTC,"Fair enough on the point of fact but for a drunkard like myself I was just trying to head off another Castro bashing thread. I feel like Castro was a great bridge for the Cubs from irrelevance to perhaps the possibility of promise. Loyalty aside I feel the numbers also bear out that irrelevant at times he still produces a nice number of hits, average, game winning clutch moments, and goddamned if he hasn't put in the time to enjoy a smidgen of support now that the future looks a bit rosy."
CHICubs,3ag1p5,Restroom406,2,Sat Jun 20 02:49:04 2015 UTC,"You're being overly sensitive. Castro is having a horrendous offensive and defensive season. It's going to be brought up.  If you immediately cry-wolf when someone casually points out that he is BELOW replacement level, then you're just as bad as the over-the-top complainers."
CHICubs,3ag1p5,stackshot,2,Sat Jun 20 15:14:01 2015 UTC,"Agree with you on the bashing stuff. Wasn't trying to start an anti-Castro rally or anything, that play was just incredibly frustrating."
CHICubs,3ag1p5,StewartDuck,4,Sat Jun 20 02:52:49 2015 UTC,So this is my first post in the forum but been following for about a year. I'm at this game and I haven't seen a worse performance by a baseball team. Far worse in person. Maybe we were just waiting for the 7th inning stretch! Let's go!

CHICubs,3ag1p5,cubswinagain,6,Sat Jun 20 01:39:21 2015 UTC,At the game right now and I can see why people think Fowler's D in center sucks. He is slow to read the ball and lops after it in center
CHICubs,3ag1p5,dls1270,3,Sat Jun 20 01:35:25 2015 UTC,yep. hes below average. plus he wont throw anyone out.

CHICubs,3ag1p5,leemill02,5,Sat Jun 20 01:04:33 2015 UTC,Hendricks appears to be the best defensively player for us on the field tonight.
CHICubs,3ag1p5,big-mo,3,Sat Jun 20 01:04:25 2015 UTC,Target Field is one of the least attractive parks in the league
CHICubs,3ag1p5,Snailz,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:02:05 2015 UTC,The pitchers have to be practicing Buddhism or something in order to deal with the stress of this defense.

CHICubs,3ag1p5,leemill02,2,Sat Jun 20 00:58:35 2015 UTC,Defense doesn't seem sharp. Not good when the pitcher is struggling.
CHICubs,3ag1p5,theshaggysnack,2,Sat Jun 20 00:58:21 2015 UTC,Should have only been a double..
CHICubs,3ag1p5,designgoddess,2,Sat Jun 20 00:57:45 2015 UTC,their bullpen is good?

CHICubs,3ag1p5,zrk23,2,Sat Jun 20 00:53:48 2015 UTC,Is the boss cast stream back yet?
CHICubs,3ag1p5,NeverSummerMountains,4,Sat Jun 20 00:52:09 2015 UTC,Not sure but the strikeout.co stream is working it's the Twins broadcast
CHICubs,3ag1p5,nakolas,4,Sat Jun 20 00:50:47 2015 UTC,hooray!
CHICubs,3ag1p5,Gimmie_Dat_Stream,3,Sat Jun 20 00:51:42 2015 UTC,Pretty quick inning. Kyle needed that.
CHICubs,3ag1p5,NeverSummerMountains,3,Sat Jun 20 00:54:16 2015 UTC,remember when Rizzo did something similar early in the season? Still indefensible but what do you expect with a sub 25 year old infield.
CHICubs,3ag1p5,big-mo,3,Sat Jun 20 00:46:30 2015 UTC,I felt like the first 4 were strikes there
CHICubs,3ag1p5,theshaggysnack,3,Sat Jun 20 00:43:17 2015 UTC,That was never a strike. SMH
CHICubs,3ag1p5,BoomNasty,3,Sat Jun 20 00:42:47 2015 UTC,Not even close.

CHICubs,3ag1p5,leemill02,4,Sat Jun 20 00:40:44 2015 UTC,so close castro =( redeem yourself later tonight

CHICubs,3ag1p5,iam2eeyore,3,Sat Jun 20 00:35:24 2015 UTC,Good start miggy. Let's get them back.
CHICubs,3ag1p5,zrk23,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:39:41 2015 UTC,Hendricks was smooth on that one.
CHICubs,3ag1p5,NeverSummerMountains,3,Sat Jun 20 00:34:46 2015 UTC,At least it wasn't an utter disaster as it could have been.
CHICubs,3ag1p5,big-mo,2,Sat Jun 20 00:34:11 2015 UTC,The 1st inning is turning into our new 6th inning
CHICubs,3ag1p5,xderek182,2,Sat Jun 20 00:31:54 2015 UTC,ok boys we got one down
CHICubs,3ag1p5,big-mo,3,Sat Jun 20 00:31:45 2015 UTC,"thats triple play ball Bryant, cmon"
CHICubs,3ag1p5,Nebarnes,2,Sat Jun 20 00:31:37 2015 UTC,That's three bad defensive plays already

CHICubs,3ag1p5,iam2eeyore,3,Sat Jun 20 00:29:44 2015 UTC,C'mon Castro! Don't do this to me!
CHICubs,3ag1p5,BoomNasty,2,Sat Jun 20 00:29:31 2015 UTC,For some reason I thought HBP didn't count if one swung at the ball.
CHICubs,3ag1p5,cgoods94,3,Sat Jun 20 00:29:26 2015 UTC,It doesn't
CHICubs,3ag1p5,mexicanpetal,3,Sat Jun 20 00:28:39 2015 UTC,"The ump signaling to first base threw me off.  I figured he would know the rules, heh."

CHICubs,3ag1p5,Snailz,2,Sat Jun 20 00:39:44 2015 UTC,Well...this is shaping up to be an eventful game
CHICubs,3ag1p5,leemill02,2,Sat Jun 20 00:45:53 2015 UTC,"Lets go hendricks baby, DP time!"
CHICubs,3ag1p5,iam2eeyore,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:28:22 2015 UTC,Somebody needs to explain to that guy that he's supposed to hit the ball with the bat. That's why he has to hold it.
CHICubs,3ag1p5,leemill02,2,Sat Jun 20 00:27:51 2015 UTC,"Someone has the appropriate Rizzo .gif, yeah?"
CHICubs,3ag1p5,NeverSummerMountains,2,Sat Jun 20 00:27:09 2015 UTC,I usually defend castro and like him as a SS. But that shit was pathetic.
CHICubs,3ag1p5,iam2eeyore,3,Sat Jun 20 00:27:07 2015 UTC,"how can u like him defensively? seriously. just because hes a cub right? lol. ofensively hes good when hes at it but seriously, we cant have a SS like that if we wanna do something great this year"
CHICubs,3ag1p5,cgoods94,9,Sat Jun 20 00:28:30 2015 UTC,Baby Maddux is seriously shitting the bed tho
CHICubs,3ag1p5,nakolas,3,Sat Jun 20 00:26:52 2015 UTC,I mean you could argue he did the best to damage control with the bases loaded. Got a DP ball. Should've been 1 run with 2 outs.
CHICubs,3ag1p5,zrk23,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:29:39 2015 UTC,Some of the other pitchers cough Jackson cough Lester would have thrown a tantrum and imploded.
CHICubs,3ag1p5,cgoods94,6,Sat Jun 20 00:26:40 2015 UTC,Very true.
CHICubs,3ag1p5,Dhash23,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:29:51 2015 UTC,Huge mental lapse by Castro there. We're definitely going to see that one again

CHICubs,3aghgf,NaturalOrder2gg,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:23:09 2015 UTC,"I have not gotten my hands on 16 yet, but I am a avid player of 15. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes baseball. Seriously addictive and fun. The rosters are all totally complete and accurate from the major leagues to rookie ball. Although as a disclaimed I would warn that I think the Cubs are cursed in the game. In my current file with the Cubs, I have had three straight 110 win seasons and four straight playoff appearances as of 2020, and have only won the pennant once, losing the World Series in seven games. My friend is the only person I know who has seen the Cubs win a World Series in the game. So I only know of the Cubs winning it all once in our combined hundreds of hours of playing time."
CHICubs,3aghgf,___worm___,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:30:34 2015 UTC,"Cool, thank you!  Are there post draft updates for the game for Ian Happ, or if i wanted to, would i just create the player?"
CHICubs,3aghgf,___worm___,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:09:36 2015 UTC,"The most recent draftees will not be in the game when you buy it. You might be able to download a updated player database with the newly drafted players, but I can't speak for certain as I've never really looked into downloading content. I also wouldn't think this sort of thing would be available until after the signing deadline.  You could create the player but it's a pretty grueling process to get a created player to be a accurate reflection of their real player profile. Not to mention that for the game to be fair (read: fun)  all the other teams would need their newly drafted players as well. It would be pretty exhausting to create all these players and would take a long time."
CHICubs,3aghgf,bradc2112,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:36:02 2015 UTC,"Most of the players in the 2015 draft are in the game. They're all rated as of Opening Day. We don't do a roster update, though, after the draft, so when you do the June draft in the game, many of them will likely end up with different teams than they did in real life.

CHICubs,3aghgf,NicCage420,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:48:05 2015 UTC,"OOTP 16 is the first in the franchise to get the MLB licensing, so not only are the rosters all (somewhat) correct (Bryant as opening day 3B), they have the actual MLB logos. The ratings might be questionable, but I feel like it's somewhat randomly generated for prospects, and varies based on how accurate scouting is for your game, and how good your scouting director is."
CHICubs,3aghgf,thrice88,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:33:40 2015 UTC,"I'm playing OOTP 16 right now! It's a fantastic game. As far as I can tell all the milb rosters are accurate. My favorite thing about the game is you can fit it into whatever play style you like. If you want to manage everything (staff, farm system, rosters, lineups, trades), even pitch-by-pitch in all 162 games you can. Or you can pick and choose and automate the rest. Normally I will focus more on the rosters/lineups and just let the AI simulate the games, sometimes a week at a time. I've won the world series with the Cubs a couple times. This play through I just started I figured I would try managing each game and while it moves a lot slower, it's still really fun. The amount of stuff that the developers have crammed into this game is insane. Buy it, you wont regret it."

CHICubs,3aeq3b,HelloNeumann29,15,Fri Jun 19 14:59:14 2015 UTC,"OK, I've been thinking about this for a while and I think most Cubs fans don't realize just how good Chris Sale is. I think the deal OP proposed is right in the neighborhood, although I actually think it might not be enough.  First of all, Chris Sale might be the second best pitcher in the game. Maybe you quibble, maybe you think less, but he's pretty clearly top 5. Clayton Kershaw, perhaps the most comparable pitcher in age and skill (although Kershaw is clearly better) will be making $35M/year for the time frame which Sale is under team control. Jon Lester, who is both older and worse, will be making over  $25M/year. Chris Sale is making a total of $47M for the next four years. If we assume Sale is worth something on the order of $30M/year on the open market, Sale has something like $75M of surplus value. In fact, I think this is an underestimate, since Sale is closer to Kershaw than he is to Lester, and the value of having Sale locked up for fewer years mitigates injury risk and controls exclusively his prime. Not to mention that surplus-value analysis breaks down for the least fungible players at the top of the scale, because they are so hard to find.  Castro, on the other hand, is signed through 2019 for approximately $40M total with a team option for 2020 at $16M. A similarly perceived righthanded shortstop in Jhonny Peralta just signed a deal with the Cards for $52M. There are, of course, key differences: Peralta is older, better, and steroid-tainted, while Castro is younger. And though, both are similarly perceived as defensively indifferent, Peralta is surprisingly favored by the numbers as quite solid defensively. A few years ago, Castro's value was probably higher, but right now, I doubt that Castro has much more than $20M surplus value, which would correspond to a 4yr/$60M contract. This also corresponds to paying something like $7.5M/WAR, assuming Castro is approximately a 2 WAR SS, which is splitting the difference between his good and his bad years.  It's tough to get an accurate valuation on prospects, but research suggests that Sale is worth something like a top-10 prospect and a top-25 prospect (although you can once again quibble with the values in the modern baseball market). Either way, it's pretty clear that Schwarber alone is not even really close to enough for Sale, especially if the Sox do not think he can stick at catcher. Schwarber plus Castro gets close, but even if we put Schwarber as a top-10 hitting prospect (which no publication has done yet), we are still something like $10M short. If Schwarber's surplus value is closer to $30M or $40M, instead of the estimate of $50M, the Cubs would need to throw in a significant other piece -- on the order of Baez perhaps, or Almora + Edwards.  This last bit of Castro + Schwarber + Baez seems pretty crazy to me, so I wonder if I'm overdoing it, but I definitely do not think Vogelbach is even close as a third piece of that deal. If I am the White Sox, I am asking for a ridiculous package for a young, top-5 starter, and if two years of Samardzija can get Addison Russell (probably an overpay by the A's though), 4 years of Chris Sale, who is better, cheaper and younger, should be able to get almost anything the Sox want."
CHICubs,3aeq3b,gniketan,3,Fri Jun 19 17:00:36 2015 UTC,"I think your argument is very logical in terms of what Sale brings to the table, but pitchers can get hurt easily. Verlander would have commanded a similarly (albeit slightly smaller) package a few years ago and now he seems to be coming down in a big way.  I'd be terrified to give away 3-4 prospects for one guy. Even a stud like Sale. We could just use 3 of those 4 guys in our daily line up, sign a free agent like Zimmerman, and be in good shape.  I know this is all hypothetical anyway, but that'd be my biggest fear."
CHICubs,3aeq3b,Bleacherbum95,4,Fri Jun 19 22:19:07 2015 UTC,"That's a valid point, especially because Sale has a lot of warning signs for injury -- lots of sliders, funky delivery, injury history (although nothing debilitating). Consolidating assets in that way is always a pretty huge risk. That being said, I would much much rather have Sale for 4 years for cheap than an aging Zimmermann for a really expensive deal. Much as it feels like baseball teams have infinite money, I really think paying $200M for one pitcher is at least as bad as paying a bunch of prospects for Sale, since it can be really tough to recoup financial flexibility but there are lots of ways to build up prospect depth. The Cubs are lucky enough to have extra depth up the middle, and while I would not make a habit of trading it away, nor would I willingly part with Schwarber, whose lefthanded power bat is an extraordinarily valuable asset, I think the Cubs should give up almost anything else to get a guy like Sale. And if the Sox insisted on Schwarber, I would still strongly consider such a deal, because Sale-Arrieta-Lester-Hammel-Hendricks would be easily a top 5 rotation imo, maybe even top 3."
CHICubs,3aeq3b,gniketan,2,Fri Jun 19 22:44:47 2015 UTC,Very good point...especially the money element. Schwarber would be so tough to watch leave. I'd hate watching him hit schwarbombs on the Southside.
CHICubs,3aeq3b,Bleacherbum95,2,Fri Jun 19 23:24:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. You put all my thoughts in one concise post.  The White Sox have shown that they don't want a Cubs-style rebuild either. It'd likely take Bryant or Russell, and the more you want to rely on prospects to make the deal, the more it will take.   Dismissively calling OPs offer ""too much"" is delusional. I'd say it's fairly close, but short, so to not even think about or discuss it is pretty blind."
CHICubs,3aeq3b,THEriot2,2,Fri Jun 19 18:54:12 2015 UTC,"A lot of people are coming from a lot of different perspectives, so I don't want to get into an emotional argument with someone who has just as much right to his or her opinion as I do. Just trying to lay out some facts as best I can!  Also, I deliberately avoided including Bryant and Russell in my analysis because if the Sox trade for one of those guys, they're not getting much else, and they need quantity over quality, hence the downgrade from Sale to Castro."

CHICubs,3aeq3b,gniketan,0,Fri Jun 19 19:37:02 2015 UTC,I don't want to get into an emotional argument   This. More of this.
CHICubs,3aeq3b,THEriot2,0,Fri Jun 19 20:43:38 2015 UTC,"The White Sox have shown that they don't want a Cubs-style rebuild either   There has been a lot more talk from the fans lately about doing this. Management so far hasn't been willing but I wonder with some pressure from the fans, if they would do it. There were several callers just this morning wanting not only to fire-sale the team, but the front office too. I think it would be the best thing for them. They have a fucking deal with the state of Illinois on ticket sales, so financially it wouldn't kill them. All that, and with the glaring point being made on the north side, of how a rebuild can go, I think they should think about it a little harder."
CHICubs,3aeq3b,THEriot2,2,Fri Jun 19 19:06:52 2015 UTC,"I think there's too much unity among the F.O. and ownership for something drastic to happen, but I don't disagree that fan pressure could make a difference. The issue is getting enough pressure from a seemingly apathetic fanbase. The White Sox do everything they reasonably can to get fans to the ballpark, and people still don't come out. Would 5 years like the Cubs just had turn them into a team like the Rays or old Pirates? That's not a great direct comparison at all, but you get the picture.  Can you do this type of rebuild without cleaning the FO? I'm not sure. I can see reasons why not, but I can also see how those are kinda BS. Kenny Williams won't be going anywhere, though. Not with Reinsdorf around.   I think it would be the best thing for them.   Oh, I absolutely  agree. They're certainly in a terrible position current."

CHICubs,3aeq3b,Bob2456,2,Fri Jun 19 19:10:33 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer Price. I got to go on field at the Cell when they last played the Tigers before the game. My dad threw out the 1st pitch.

Starting SS, DH, and catcher + a pitcher to groom? Or maybe even a more MLB ready pitcher seems fair. Especially since Castro and Sale are on team friendly deals."
CHICubs,3aeq3b,Kaner_95,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:26:25 2015 UTC,"Most here are saying that's too much.   They're nuts. He's one of the most valuable, and best, players in the game. We as a fanbase, like all others, have a tendency to overrate our players.   Starting SS, DH, and catcher + a pitcher to groom   Castro's value has taken a dip currently, but yeah, a starting SS. Not great, but a starter. When calling Vogelbach a DH and Schwarber a catcher, we have to consider that either or both of them don't fulfill that. Schwarber seems like as sure of a bet as there is to hit at the bigs, but he certainly won't be valued as highly as he is here. Most other orgs are less confident than ours in his ability to catch, and no one will write his name in the lineup card in pen, even without adding a position. Vogelbach...you gotta go down the same road. What are the chances he just ends up not making the show? How valuable is a DH? Especially when you know there's no shot at him playing the field, either because of ability or the other guy on the diamond (Abreu).   And a pitcher. Great. No problem with that, but remember that we don't have a knockout pitching prospect, our most intriguing name (IMO Underwood) is in the lower levels. The biggest risk of the package essentially.  On the other hand you have Sale. And this is where I think most people are going awry...they're underrating him. He's, arguably I guess, been a top 5 pitcher in baseball since 2012. His contract is so team friendly is makes Castro's look like an abomination. And even though I keep waiting for his arm to fall off, he hasn't had any major, or really concerning, arming injuries. He misses his 2-5 weeks a year and still remains incredibly valuable. Plus, coming to the Cubs, you think maybe you'd be able to curb in the injury risk by...oh I don't know, handling him correctly and not making him play for the clueless Robin Ventura. He wouldn't have to throw 127 pitches in 7 innings of a losing effort in April (and then immediately go on the DL). Sale is probably a top 10 most valuable player in baseball.  Edit: Like the thread, by the way. I heard Spiegel and Goff talking about it yesterday and it was interesting. Would have rather had Boers and Abbatacola on it, though...good baseball guys."
CHICubs,3aeq3b,kazuo316,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:43:22 2015 UTC,"I figured Castro gives them two things. An immediate upgrade at the position offensively speaking, and if he does prove that this is just a cold streak and last year/early 2015 were not a fluke, he could be a trade chip for them as well. I think they may value Schwarber even more, given the offensive woes from their catchers, and overall struggle with the position if he progresses there. Vogelbach is probably just the biggest mystery. I figure Adam LaRoche would leave town, Jose would lock down 1st since he seems to want to be in the field, and Vogs would be a natural fit at DH. Anyways, its all probably for naught. This'll never happen, but its fun to think about. Thanks for your input."
CHICubs,3aeq3b,gniketan,3,Fri Jun 19 19:44:20 2015 UTC,"I was just on another web board yesterday where we had a lengthy discussion about this.  Another aspect to all of this, is that Sale has an extremely team friendly contract, thus making his trade value even higher.  The end result of our discussion was that these two teams are just not a match for this type of trade.  What the Cubs would want to give up wouldn't be enough and what the Sox would want would be too much."
CHICubs,3aeq3b,TooLebowski,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:29:53 2015 UTC,"See, I can't help but disagree that we're not a good match. We have the farm team, they have the greater need for young players.

CHICubs,3aeq3b,theshaggysnack,5,Fri Jun 19 16:37:55 2015 UTC,"The best response from our discussion was ""Both teams have too much to lose by being wrong.""  Essentially, if the Cubs give up all these prospects and they turn out to be studs - was it worth it for one starting pitcher?  What if Sale blows out his arm and is never the same?  Worth it?  What if Sale wins 7 Cy Youngs in a row and all the prospects end up like Felix Pie - Worth it for the Sox?   There are too many high risk/high reward variables for either team to be willing to make that kind of move."
CHICubs,3aeq3b,Sparx7,3,Fri Jun 19 16:44:00 2015 UTC,"That's an incredibly real and worthy argument. Its a huge risk and the main reason this would never happen. I just like to play the hypothetical game, and would love to have Chris Sale as a Cub. It also makes me think of the Sox sending Sosa to the Cubs for George Bell, and the Cubs sending Jon Garland to the Sox for Matt Karchner. You also have to account for the ""fan base rivalry"" - if one side of the trade doesn't work out, those fans will be rightfully upset."
CHICubs,3aeq3b,Banglayna,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:48:51 2015 UTC,Samardzja would be the only guy we have a chance for. There is no way we can trade for Sale because we aren't giving up Bryant or Russel and the Sox aren't trading a 26 year old stud pitcher on a team friendly deal that goes through 2018 for anyone other than those two.
CHICubs,3aeq3b,Sparx7,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:19:14 2015 UTC,"The problem is they're not willing to do a Cubs-style rebuild. They've proven that.

CHICubs,3aeq3b,THEriot2,2,Fri Jun 19 15:28:29 2015 UTC,I'm with everybody else. These trades aren't feasible. The Sox (probably rightly) wouldn't entertain any deal that doesn't involve Bryant/Russell. Any deal with 1 of those 2 as a cornerstone isn't palatable for the Cubs.
CHICubs,3aeq3b,THEriot2,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:51:33 2015 UTC,"The problem for the Sox is that even if the Cubs would do it (they wouldn't), turning Sale into Bryant or Russell is basically just running in place. They trade one transcendent player for (potentially) another, and those two prospects are good enough that even with sweeteners the Sox wouldn't really get enough to address their main problem of major-league depth, especially up the middle. The Sox have a great young core, so what they need to be doing is diversifying their assets to actually build the major league depth they need. On the flip side, the Cubs have a lot of the young toolsy up-the-middle players that the Sox have a track record of prioritizing, not to mention the money to take on a bad contract like Danks or maybe even LaRoche.   The really shitty thing for the Sox is that they went all-in on this season with expensive middle-of-the-road pieces like Shark and Cabrera and LaRoche, but if they had held out for one more year and built up the youth and depth to make a serious run next year, they look to me like real competitors. With the Tigers getting older and the other teams in the division looking flawed, I think the slower approach would have gotten much more mileage, but instead they lost both their financial flexibility and much of their minor league depth for a team with an incredibly small margin of error."
CHICubs,3aeq3b,THEriot2,2,Fri Jun 19 21:10:09 2015 UTC,"As good as Sale is it still doesn't make a ton of sense throwing out a bunch of guys to get a pitcher every 5th day, if healthy.  We're better off playing this year out and going hard after Price or Zim.  Sale's fun to watch pitch, but I kinda wonder how much of the problems on the south side come down to attitude of the players.   I don't watch every game of theirs, but they all just seem so pissed and bitter about every little thing.  Maybe I'm looking too deep into this but seeing how this cubs squad plays for eachother and the mood you see coming out of the clubhouse seems like polar opposite of the way the sox are carrying themselves.  I don't want Shark back for exactly this reason."
CHICubs,3aeq3b,0mousedog,2,Fri Jun 19 19:59:41 2015 UTC,I don't wanna give up that for one guy who plays every 5th game. Just get Zimmerman and Price in the offseason or something.

CHICubs,3aeq3b,RaveOn1958,2,Sat Jun 20 15:31:13 2015 UTC,"While we may not be rivals like Cubs/Cards, there is a rivalry here. You have two teams battling over a fan base. The team that wins or does better is going to capture said fan base. We historically have not traded much with the Sox. Sosa to the Cubs, and Garland to the Sox are the most notable two and both of those, in retrospect were bad trades for the seller. Sosa made a huge impact on the Cubs and brought national attention to the club. Garland won nearly 200 games and a World Series for the Sox. You can then understand why trading a Chris Sale could burn the Sox, if what they get in return does not perform well. And I agree, no one should be untouchable, it usually works out that each team has a few players who are considered untouchable."

It's not getting done without several top 100 guys.  We would have to start at Schwarber, Baez, and then a couple other top 10 org. guys.

It doesn't matter who we get. Look at Lester for example, huge contract and is performing pretty average thus far. Not hating at all because I love Lester (relatively) but it's a good example of why we shouldn't give up our youth for a pitcher. Imagine the A's right now. Gave us Addi for shark and only kept him for half a season. If we gave the sox incredible youth talent for either of those pitchers I would be so pissed. I say we test free agency."

The thought of losing 3 of the prospects who could make the Cubs a perennial contender for a pitcher who could just ""lose it"" one day is terrifying. The Cubs, for the first time in our lives, are doing things the right way and not taking short-cuts. Let's be patient and wait until the team is developed enough to really know what needs to be added to make the team championship caliber. You really don't know what to add until you know what you really have."

Oh well, you win some, you lose some, that's just how it is. Still, kind of odd how the Cubs could go from completely annihilating the Indians 17-0 last night to losing to them 4-3.

Their Christmas card in 2005 was all of them in white sox gear, they are fanatics.  I know your pain.    Baseball started out as a hostile topic between me and them but the way I managed it was to pay their team respect where its due (honestly Sale is my favorite pitcher in the league to watch pitch, and I freely admit it) but also mock them where its due when things get competitive (Dayan Viciedo was their best option in left field for HOW long?!).  Over time its evolved so that they do the same for me and the cubs.  Four years ago they would say stuff like all Cubs suck and are bums, nowadays one of them admitted he watched a game Arrieta started just cause he loves his nasty breaking ball.  When it comes down to it we have alot more in common with sox fans than the rest of the world, we all love baseball."

I probably don't get involved with all the arguments and stuff because I only just recently got into sports.

Sammy, Wood, and Prior (Harry bless them) couldn't do it. Mr. Cub didn't do it. All these amazing players throughout the years... we never got them what they deserved. Now, these kids, these young guys... they all have this energy in them, the backing of over one hundred years of a patient and loving fan base. They aren't backing down. Rizzo stood up looked everyone in the eye and said we would win the Central, THIS YEAR (I wish i knew how to bold on mobile), not next year, THIS YEAR!  They aren't backing down from it. They know why they are there. We know why they are there, and they aren't backing down. The best part... the best part is we aren't done getting better... it makes me laugh because they are putting it together. I love this...

Plate discipline is one thing but if you see that slightly outside strike is consistently being called then you have to start protecting it.

With Miggy here until 2017 (barring a trade), I don't think that's out of the question. I don't think we'd go that route this year though."
CHICubs,3ad8ux,keeks137,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:50:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think we move him. If things work right, the OF gets crowded in the very near future. Whereas catcher really doesn't. SchWAR machine is the catcher of future, and the future is less than a year away imo"
CHICubs,3ad8ux,Loop_Within_A_Loop,2,Fri Jun 19 16:54:40 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree that he could be the catcher of the future, but it raises the question about Montero. I think he's too good to be a backup. So, if what you're saying comes true, I think you'd be better suited trading Montero for a nice return vs. making him a backup.  In the end, I just dont see a scenario this year, or possibly even next year where you have a healthy Schwarber and Montero on the team, and both are playing exclusively catcher."

CHICubs,3aa2s0,Toastman04,20,Thu Jun 18 12:42:53 2015 UTC,"Short answer: St Louis is one of the ten smallest metropolitan areas of the MLB cities.  Long answer: St Louis and surrounding suburbs are the only things considered when looking at their market. Not their enormous fan base which stretches from Indiana to Arkansas to Kansas. The mindset is that smaller market teams aren't gonna make as  much money, and therefore, we should supplement their lack of revenues with more picks. And this is true for some teams. For example, Milwaukee can be the best team in baseball, but they'll never have the following the Cardinals do because the Cubs are too close to them and they don't have the history the Cardinals do. Despite this whole ""lack of revenue"" reasoning, the Cardinals are actually the most profitable team in baseball. To me, the system is broken and it should be changed to one of the following. Either 1) give these competitive balance picks to the 10 worst teams in the MLB measured by their record the previous season, or 2) give these competitive balance picks to the ten teams with the lowest revenue in baseball from the previous season. Option 1 would  make any teams eligible during a shitty year, but I'm not sure the MLB wants the Yankees/Red Sox/Dodgers/Cubs getting extra picks given that they can spend a ton of money whenever they want, and can easily turn around from bad to good without these extra picks. Option 2 would technically make all teams eligible, but extremely unlikely that the Yankees/Red Sox/Dodgers/Cubs would ever qualify because even in bad years those teams rake in a ton of money.  As for how to change it, that's completely up to the owners."
CHICubs,3aa2s0,jmr33090,5,Thu Jun 18 13:57:32 2015 UTC,"I'm actually all for the 2nd option. The Cardinals aren't going to drop into the bottom 10 of revenue anytime soon. Unless the MLB decides to expand into some of the Cards rather large area. I think if you correlate the bottom revenue with smallest markets, besides STL, you'd see probably all the bottom revenue teams are probably in the smallest markets."
CHICubs,3aa2s0,Bison66,2,Thu Jun 18 14:18:24 2015 UTC,"For the most part, you're right about that correlation, but I'm sure certain teams with larger markets would lose enough revenue during bad years to be eligible. For example, Toronto & Detroit's fan bases aren't really loyal unless the teams are winning. I'd bet their revenues could easily fall below that of Seattle, San Diego and Minnesota, who actually seem to have fairly good following, win or lose, and are all three eligible for these picks based on market size. It'd usually be the same teams year after year, and it would almost certainly always exclude the Cardinals, but there'd be some change."
CHICubs,3aa2s0,jmr33090,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:45:17 2015 UTC,"Personally, I am of the mindset that the ten worst-performing teams should get the picks.  I talked about this yesterday on here, and compared this situation with the NFL.  Green Bay has around 100,000 residents, without-a-doubt the smallest ""market"" in the NFL.  GB, like STL, are perennial championship contenders and have HUGE followings, despite being in small markets.  Does this mean that the Packers should get extra draft picks?  Of course not."
CHICubs,3aa2s0,zaikanekochan,3,Thu Jun 18 14:24:12 2015 UTC,"I mean the NFL also has a hard cap, limits on contract length, less control over players. Granted a bottom ten team getting those picks would probably benefit greatly from them. Although you've got to imagine that if the MLB were to consider it that the Rays and Cards would fight it hard"
CHICubs,3aa2s0,Bison66,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:51:32 2015 UTC,"A couple issues with these, though.  Standard draft picks are already set based on record, so if you also organize the competitive picks by record, you're essentially double rewarding the bad teams and providing even more incentive for a team to tank.  And basing it solely off revenue has a few issues as well - primarily that revenue is easy to fudge, which we see when reports come out about teams with very low revenues or even losing money, when in reality the teams are valued in the hundreds-of-millions-approaching-a-billion (yes, there's not necessarily a direct correlation between valuations and revenue, but I think we can all agree no MLB team is hurting for money).  My initial thought was to base the picks on the previous season's home attendance, rather than market size.  This ""solves"" the Cardinal problem, but then may unfairly penalize a team like Milwaukee for having a good season or two.  Bottom line:  I don't think there's really any good answer.  If it were up to me, I'd get rid of the competitive balance picks altogether.  Teams have shown that they are not necessary for success (just look at the teams that got the first 6 picks this year - Cards, Rockies, Marlins, Brewers, Padres, and Indians - all teams that have had varying degrees of success over the last decade).  On the other hand, it's one extra pick, so I also kind of think ""eh, no big deal.""  But yeah, it's complete BS that the Cardinals of all teams get one given everything they touch turns to gold anyway."
CHICubs,3aa2s0,weekstolive,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:46:37 2015 UTC,"The way the competitive balance picks work right now is that the 10 smallest market teams are in a lottery for pick order in the first round. 5 of the 10 get first round picks. The remaining five are in a lottery for second round picks along with two additional teams. I would want to keep the lottery for either of these formats. Sure, there's still an incentive to tank, but since 12 teams are eligible, if you're on the verge of the bottom 12, you're also on the verge of being in the top half of the league, and by the time you give up on the playoffs it might be too late to tank. So I don't see that as a large issue.  Profit fudging is easy to do, revenue fudging is not as easy to do. That's why I went with revenue. It's still possible, but if they base it only on certain standardized metrics, not necessarily the same ones as profit reporting, they can keep it pretty clean.   If based on home attendance, a team could raise ticket prices to discourage fans from attending, while still making similar revenues due to higher prices from the fans who do attend."
CHICubs,3aa2s0,jmr33090,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:54:29 2015 UTC,"I know how the picks work, and I think my larger point re: record still stands - allowing the worst team by record into the lottery still double-incentivizes being at the bottom.  But like I said, I just don't think it's a big enough deal to worry about - one extra pick per year after the first or second round.  Meh.  Yeah, we don't like it because the Cardinals are one of those teams, but given the crapshoot that is the draft (esp. after the first handful of picks), big deal."
CHICubs,3aa2s0,weekstolive,2,Thu Jun 18 15:09:26 2015 UTC,"I just don't see the tanking incentive to be that likely, I guess. The really low teams won't need to tank because as long as they're bottom 10, it doesn't matter exactly how bad they are, and anyone else should be still hoping for a playoff shot halfway through the season. And if some teams try to tank, the teams below them will try to tank as well, hurting the better teams chances to tank enough.  Overall, I kind of have the ""meh, no big deal"" attitude about it as well for the most part. But on principle, it's absurd to me that the Cardinals are eligible because St Louis is small even though their fanbase is enormous."
CHICubs,3aa2s0,jmr33090,2,Thu Jun 18 15:16:44 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I could sit here all day and list the things about the Cardinals I disagree with on principal and this wouldn't crack the top 25!"

The Cardinals are a small market team that happens to have been run amazingly for a very long time.

CHICubs,3a8lwb,voidecho,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:42:10 2015 UTC,"All I remember is,""I'm Rick James, bitch!""  Don't remember the couch part."
CHICubs,3a8lwb,JosePajamas,2,Thu Jun 18 03:43:34 2015 UTC,"There were a few different skits involving Rick James, so you might've missed the one specifically when Rick James stepped all over the Murphy's couch and Charlie Murphy beat the hell out of him."

CHICubs,3a8lwb,Dr_Wolfie,2,Thu Jun 18 02:22:11 2015 UTC,The one game I miss. I should not watch more often I guess
CHICubs,3a8lwb,AMumm5,2,Thu Jun 18 02:23:23 2015 UTC,probably the most fun game I can remember watching in my life. i have pretty shit memory though
CHICubs,3a8lwb,jaylocked,2,Thu Jun 18 02:23:24 2015 UTC,First game I didn't get to watch in like two weeks and Cubs went crazy!! Hot damn. Best ESPN notification ever
CHICubs,3a8lwb,mexicanpetal,5,Thu Jun 18 02:27:41 2015 UTC,You should probably stop watching from now on.

CHICubs,3a8lwb,Thetiredduck,2,Thu Jun 18 02:20:04 2015 UTC,What does that make Kyle Schwarber?
CHICubs,3a8lwb,American_Soviet,5,Thu Jun 18 02:28:24 2015 UTC,"an Apostle, one of the cool ones. Matthew, I guess?"

CHICubs,3a8lwb,IV4NTH3GR34T,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:31:46 2015 UTC,That was a pretty good comeback win after yesterday
CHICubs,3a8lwb,Faskis,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:19:05 2015 UTC,So what do we do if Schwarber continues to hit like he did today?
CHICubs,3a8lwb,IV4NTH3GR34T,7,Thu Jun 18 02:19:14 2015 UTC,Still going back to AAA unless an injury to Montero or Ross happens
CHICubs,3a8lwb,fender-b-bender,4,Thu Jun 18 02:20:06 2015 UTC,No one here better get any bright ideas to go Tonya Harding on our national treasure
CHICubs,3a8lwb,blazemongr,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:24:14 2015 UTC,Don't say that like it was all him. Wada pitched a great game and EVERY starting player got at least one hit.
CHICubs,3a8lwb,Faskis,2,Thu Jun 18 03:35:23 2015 UTC,The question was more of a sarcastic joke. I'm fully aware of how well everyone played and where Schwarber will be in a week
CHICubs,3a8lwb,pm_me_ur_pajamas,0,Thu Jun 18 04:27:33 2015 UTC,Move him to LF and have the better performing of the other OFs take over RF until Soler is back?  Not sure if any of them can play CF over Fowler.
CHICubs,3a8lwb,mexicanpetal,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:23:35 2015 UTC,"Well, boys, that was fun. Catch ya'll tomorrow!"

CHICubs,3a8lwb,StewartDuck,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:26:46 2015 UTC,I have to keep pinching myself after this one. Schwarber RBI triple and a Russell home run in the same inning...for the MLB team.  Mmmmmmmmm.
CHICubs,3a8lwb,Loop_Within_A_Loop,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:57:56 2015 UTC,Our boys better be ready to play tomorrow. Because the Indians have to be wanting revenge after this.
CHICubs,3a8lwb,tesd44,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:06:36 2015 UTC,Rough week for Cleveland sports and a great week for Chicago
CHICubs,3a8lwb,ST_Lawson,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:03:23 2015 UTC,"I wasn't able to watch the game, but can someone ELI5 why they had a position player pitching? Is that a strategy thing? So they're not taxing the actual pitchers when it's already a blowout?"
CHICubs,3a8lwb,voidecho,2,Thu Jun 18 16:02:24 2015 UTC,That's exactly it.  Not wasting the bullpen in a blowout.
CHICubs,3a8lwb,Gewehr98,-11,Thu Jun 18 18:02:23 2015 UTC,"I mean, I'm glad Kris Bryant hit a grand slam but was it a bit much to keep pouring it on?"
CHICubs,3a8lwb,big-mo,15,Thu Jun 18 02:19:29 2015 UTC,It's the pros...not little league. It's a stat driven league anyways.
CHICubs,3a8lwb,voidecho,8,Thu Jun 18 02:20:03 2015 UTC,They also could have used real pitchers.  They want to save their bullpen then we don't have to hold back.
CHICubs,3a8lwb,voidecho,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:23:26 2015 UTC,"Seriously, the one he rocked was lobbed in at 78. It was actually starting to look like little league."
CHICubs,3a8lwb,American_Soviet,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:02:41 2015 UTC,"Totally agree, my point being they had real pitchers available and made the decision not to use them.  Put a little leaguer out there to pitch and people are going to rock them....unless it's Ross pitching."
CHICubs,3a8lwb,mandiblebutt,3,Thu Jun 18 17:08:15 2015 UTC,think of the statssss
CHICubs,3a8lwb,Gewehr98,2,Thu Jun 18 02:22:57 2015 UTC,"At some  point Bryant will be a free agent.  That home run, those rbi, will, on margin, pay country club dues for 4 or 5 years.   Boros is rubbing himself.  As well he should."
CHICubs,3a8lwb,turp119,2,Thu Jun 18 02:22:59 2015 UTC,I'm rubbing myself too but I feel guilty about it
CHICubs,3a8lwb,Kaner_95,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:25:36 2015 UTC,"I don't even feel guilty. Maybe a little empty inside, but definitely not guilty."
CHICubs,3a8lwb,blazemongr,2,Thu Jun 18 05:33:54 2015 UTC,Those 7 extra wouldn't have happened if Lindor didn't miss the easy pop up.
CHICubs,3a8lwb,Gewehr98,5,Thu Jun 18 02:24:11 2015 UTC,"If they beat you 6-0 in your house, you beat them 17-0 in theirs. THAT'S the Chicago way."
CHICubs,3a8lwb,Slednvrfed,4,Thu Jun 18 03:45:13 2015 UTC,true I just have a guilty conscience and felt bad for the Indians at the end there
CHICubs,3a8lwb,erindizmo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:27:43 2015 UTC,4 extra but yeaaaah he looked like he ate a spoon fulll of shit. Poor kid
CHICubs,3a8lwb,Thetiredduck,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:38:24 2015 UTC,"No, all seven were scored after the error.  EDIT: I then realized you were specifically referring to the slam. Carry on!"
CHICubs,3a8zgc,jgrim0642,10,Thu Jun 18 04:23:54 2015 UTC,"Agreed. This team is reminding me how much I love to watch baseball, and it's awesome.  Even the second half of last year was fun to watch, but this year just blows it out of the water. I can't imagine how excited I'll be if we can grab a wild card."
CHICubs,3a8zgc,sjrossman0,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:04:20 2015 UTC,I can't even describe how amazing tonight's game was. If we get a playoff berth i'll be going crazy!

CHICubs,3a8zgc,xconzo,3,Thu Jun 18 05:20:00 2015 UTC,"I literallt cannot find a person on this team i don't like, everyone on the mlb roster is so fucking likeable and i love it"

CHICubs,3a8zgc,acCripteau,5,Thu Jun 18 14:33:04 2015 UTC,I'll always kinda like Edwin solely because he's handled the harsh criticism really well. Obviously he's been terrible but he's continued to be a good guy and teammate
CHICubs,3a8zgc,kbergstr,3,Thu Jun 18 22:12:11 2015 UTC,Same. Such a fun and youthful team to watch.
CHICubs,3a8zgc,xconzo,3,Thu Jun 18 07:11:01 2015 UTC,Christ-- I was your age in 2003. May you never live through the disappointment that happened when the 03-08 cycle ended.
CHICubs,3a8zgc,hdcantona,2,Thu Jun 18 16:44:13 2015 UTC,"When I look at the Blackhawks team right now, and when they got Kane and Toews years ago. Everyone knew, wow this team is going to contend for a long time. And they have. And I know with this Cubs talent, they are going to to the same thing. It's the same situation. And that gets me very excited."
CHICubs,3a8zgc,i4_D_4_Mi,2,Thu Jun 18 14:31:41 2015 UTC,It seems I picked a great year to get into baseball and choosing the cubs against the advice of so many!
CHICubs,3a8zgc,hdcantona,2,Thu Jun 18 20:14:54 2015 UTC,"Careful now, you best say you've been a fan since at least 2005 or so before the rest of the league calls you a bandwagoner. Welcome aboard!"

CHICubs,3a8zgc,hdcantona,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:53:09 2015 UTC,What made you choose the Cubs?
CHICubs,3a8zgc,TacticalDesire,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:03:35 2015 UTC,"Well it was a mixture of things, first of all many told me not to because of the lack of WS wins since 1908 but I kind of liked that a a fairly 'big' team I that makes any sense was a bit of an underdog, the cubs have so much history, I loved the look of Wrigley field and will visit one day, and then I just started watching a few games and the team seemed young and promising so I figured I might be getting in at the ground level!"
CHICubs,3a8gm0,mute_btn,7,Thu Jun 18 01:33:46 2015 UTC,F the Cards is right! Glad you had a great time!

CHICubs,3a8gm0,mandiblebutt,2,Thu Jun 18 02:30:59 2015 UTC,"That's a real tough question.  We ate at a lot of different places and everything was good.  We ate at Maude's one night and their seafood tower was phenomenal, as was everything else there.    Another day we ate at Uncle Julios and those steamed tortilla's were out of this world.    Then another night we had chicken tenders from DeLUX.  I don't know what they bread those things with but they were insanely good.  So, obviously, it's hard to pick just one thing that stood out."
CHICubs,3a8gm0,The_Black_Unicorn,3,Thu Jun 18 03:03:17 2015 UTC,Wish we coulda used 7 or so of tonight's runs to beat the Indians for ya.

CHICubs,3a7bnr,AntawnSL,2,Thu Jun 18 02:19:02 2015 UTC,"6 was the most, we scored 6 against the Tigers and in this game, until we just scored 7 now"

CHICubs,3a7bnr,HotBurritoBeans,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:15:00 2015 UTC,I believe so.
CHICubs,3a7bnr,homebrewtj,3,Thu Jun 18 02:14:43 2015 UTC,We just got 7 that inning

CHICubs,3a7bnr,Slednvrfed,4,Thu Jun 18 02:13:09 2015 UTC,Goddammit the one night I have to work super late I miss the most fun game of the season!
CHICubs,3a7bnr,loopscadoop,9,Thu Jun 18 02:13:09 2015 UTC,Anyone want to give me odds on the Indians coming back and scoring 18 in the bottom of the 9th?
CHICubs,3a7bnr,Ganesha811,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:13:00 2015 UTC,"According to Baseball Almanac, 18 runs in one inning has only been done once. In 1883.  On a not-so-related note, my dad was at the only game in MLB history where a player hit two grand slams, one from each side of the plate.  That website is really neat."
CHICubs,3a7bnr,gocubsgo22,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:36:39 2015 UTC,Maybe the 2010 Cubs. Not these Cubs. :)
CHICubs,3a7bnr,Ganesha811,9,Thu Jun 18 02:14:16 2015 UTC,Thanks Lindor for allowing Bryant to hit his 1st grand slam there
CHICubs,3a7bnr,jmoney425,3,Thu Jun 18 02:15:06 2015 UTC,This guys pitching form seems half assed. Like he's not putting in all of his effort.

CHICubs,3a7bnr,TheDaltonator,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:12:18 2015 UTC,To get Rizzo some rest. It was already a laugher before the top of the ninth
CHICubs,3a7bnr,slave_to_technology,3,Thu Jun 18 02:12:17 2015 UTC,Just giving Rizzo some rest. Mercy rule kind of stuff.
CHICubs,3a7bnr,Tjagra,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:14:14 2015 UTC,He's playing tomorrow I think. Plus it's a blowout.
CHICubs,3a7bnr,homebrewtj,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:13:42 2015 UTC,Just giving Rizzo a micro-rest. Easy to afford in the AL blowout.

CHICubs,3a7bnr,TheDaltonator,2,Thu Jun 18 02:13:00 2015 UTC,"No worries! Yeah Rizzo is one of those guys that really never get a night off, so when the game is that far out of hand, it's generally a good idea to let him sit. It has the added benefit of getting Baxter some defensive work and an at-bat or two."
CHICubs,3a7bnr,i4_D_4_Mi,13,Thu Jun 18 02:18:57 2015 UTC,That grand slam had to feel Like winning first place in a special ed competition

CHICubs,3a7bnr,fightintxag13,3,Thu Jun 18 02:11:38 2015 UTC,JD said it best. You were almost expecting that.
CHICubs,3a7bnr,REDDIT_GOLD_SANTA,6,Thu Jun 18 02:11:37 2015 UTC,That time JD said the Cubs would get 20 runs at some point this year...
CHICubs,3a7bnr,glberns,2,Thu Jun 18 02:11:36 2015 UTC,Between innings I said to myself that they couldn't add on after the early runs. No 20 runs today.

It's stealing plain and simple. They used a known password to gain entry and take information. No different than a thief taking your house key and stealing your flatscreen. We wouldn't call him a locksmith would we? I just want to make sure we aren't giving the Cards any undue credit here..."
CHICubs,3a6e7p,PaletoBayPlayboy,2,Wed Jun 17 21:16:34 2015 UTC,Yeah its more of unauthorized access than a legit hacking. Still illegal though : )
CHICubs,3a6e7p,Tjagra,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:24:35 2015 UTC,"I've worked in the IT industry for going on 20 years. It isn't hacking. Hacking is not gaining unauthorized access only.  Edit: Now that I'm not on my phone, I'll give a more complete answer. Hacking is the act of making a computer system, etc. do something it wasn't designed to do. Be that exploiting a known vulnerability, etc. Typing in a password doesn't fit the criteria."

CHICubs,3a6e7p,PaletoBayPlayboy,15,Thu Jun 18 13:47:39 2015 UTC,"I think it is bullshit that they get their extra ""Competitive Balance"" picks due to being a ""bottom ten market."""
CHICubs,3a6e7p,zaikanekochan,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:59:16 2015 UTC,"Honest question, all this ""hacking"" business aside, why? There's only 5 teams with smaller markets than STL. I guess I don't see why they should amend the rules because one team is consistently good. I get that you hate STL, and that makes me sad because I just wish everybody was just a baseball fan with a favorite team instead of hating entire teams/fanbases, but STL is a small market.   EDIT: If you don't like this, say you want to revise the entire rule. When you just say the Cardinals shouldn't get the picks they're entitled to just because they're good, you look ignorant. Instead, throw out an idea that promotes parity. I won't argue with that."
CHICubs,3a6e7p,burts_beads,9,Thu Jun 18 18:34:41 2015 UTC,"It has nothing to do with hating the organization,  and for the record I don't; they have been a model for years.  While it it true that yes, they are a ""small market"" as far as metropolitan area goes, they are hardly a small market team. They have a gigantic fan base. They are perennial World Series contenders. They draw as well as any team out there. It is ridiculous that they get extra picks because the city they play in is smaller than other teams. They are having their cake and eating it, too, which isn't the spirit or the reasoning of the rule."
CHICubs,3a6e7p,zaikanekochan,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:26:56 2015 UTC,So what do they do? Make a Cardinals amendment to the rule? What happens if they suck ass in 5 years. Which could easily happen. So then do you amend it again so they're on the same level as other small market teams?
CHICubs,3a6e7p,burts_beads,9,Wed Jun 17 22:26:44 2015 UTC,"You don't give extra picks because you're in a certain city. If parity is the goal (which it is) then you give the extra picks to the ten worst teams every year instead.  Think about football for a second. Do the Packers deserve an extra pick every year because they are in a small market, even though they are one of the best teams? Of course not."
CHICubs,3a6e7p,zaikanekochan,9,Wed Jun 17 22:35:59 2015 UTC,"Alternatively: give picks to teams that drew the lowest in park revenue. It would tend to be struggling teams and the current competitive balance draft rule seems to be about a little more than parity, but about not allowing money to overcome parity.  I like your idea too."
CHICubs,3a6e7p,JohnnyWaffleseed,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:39:44 2015 UTC,That would also work.
CHICubs,3a6e7p,zaikanekochan,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:16:36 2015 UTC,"Ok, I won't argue that. But you didn't say that before. You made it seem like the Cardinals shouldn't get an extra pick even though they qualify because they are good. Call for a reform of this rule, not crucify the Cardinals for reaping the benefits of a rule they didn't create."
CHICubs,3a6e7p,burts_beads,2,Wed Jun 17 23:59:02 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth,  I completely agree with you about wishing people could just be fans who like something. Nothing makes me cringe more on this sub than the constant and obsessive hating of the cardinals. It's especially sad because for once we have a lot going on that is worth talking about and yet posts are constantly filled with ""Fuck the cards."" Sigh."

I don't live in STL so I only go to a few games a year, but I love when I sit by somebody that's a fan of the other team. I have so many questions for them, they see their players everyday and I only see them on paper. I just feel like it should be a unifying thing, not something to inspire hate. I'm glad you agree."
CHICubs,3a6e7p,mkrsoft,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:40:46 2015 UTC,It's a dumb rule.  The Cardinals may play in a small market but they rank 6th in MLB revenue and are the MOST profitable team in baseball.

CHICubs,3a8x80,octobadger,6,Thu Jun 18 12:02:23 2015 UTC,Because he's a slick fielder and hovering around .250-.260 with an OBP of .314 and a high average with RISP in your rookie season is pretty damn good.  You don't just waltz into the majors and hit .280-.310 without struggling.

CHICubs,3a74la,scumbagscuba,2,Wed Jun 17 19:33:21 2015 UTC,Been anxious to see this guy in action.  Hopefully we didn't get rid of Beef for nothing.
CHICubs,3a74la,virtualroofie,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:17:04 2015 UTC,@Cubs:   2015-06-17 19:15:47 UTC  #Cubs today recalled RHP Yoervis Medina from Triple-A Iowa and placed LHP Zac Rosscup on the 15-day D.L. with left shoulder inflammation.     [Mistake?] [Suggestion] [FAQ] [Code] [Issues]
CHICubs,3a60dj,LtDarien,6,Wed Jun 17 14:32:21 2015 UTC,So great to hear they're keeping him at catcher. Sounds like he'll be a lot like Steven Vogt. Primarily catcher but can plug into the OF eventually.
CHICubs,3a60dj,xconzo,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:44:42 2015 UTC,"I really hope he works out behind the plate. If not, we are out of room to put him anywhere else unless we trade away a couple decent players. I guess that's a good problem to have but I'd hate to see anyone leave."
CHICubs,3a60dj,EchoesOfSanity,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:45:01 2015 UTC,"I wonder what the plan will be for how often he will catch when he is called up for good. Montero is signed through 2017, and there really isn't another spot for him in the field. Maybe Schwarber catches 1 out 3 games and plays outfield the other 2."
CHICubs,3a60dj,Iron_Mike0,3,Wed Jun 17 14:50:42 2015 UTC,"I was going to say LF but good God, Coghlan has had a helluva last month."
CHICubs,3a60dj,friendlyconfines,2,Wed Jun 17 16:05:27 2015 UTC,Coghlan has played pretty well all year. He just started off with some pretty rough BABIP luck.
CHICubs,3a60dj,thelwynn,2,Wed Jun 17 18:58:46 2015 UTC,"Coghlan definitely had some rough luck. He's a nice player. But if he's starting, that team is going to struggle to be a contender. He's a 4th outfielder on a good team. Which, frankly, could shape up very nicely for the Cubs."
CHICubs,3a60dj,QBEagles,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:05:48 2015 UTC,I'd agree. It's gets even more questionable if Baez gets his strike outs under control. I can't see a way out of this without trading away a pretty good player or having a good player riding the bench every game.
CHICubs,3a60dj,EchoesOfSanity,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:47:15 2015 UTC,"I imagine this will be the case.  Though Montero will probably play catcher 3 out of 4 games, and he'd also be the starting DH in AL parks."
CHICubs,3a6cb8,crackerjack32,24,Wed Jun 17 16:02:00 2015 UTC,"Try to pass as a Cardinals scout, maybe a Cardinals polo and cap.  But most importantly bring a fat stack of Houston Astros scouting reports with you."

I'm not big on the whole conspiracy thing that every team is evil but, I gotta believe that teams are doing what they can to get an edge.

A Cardinals' former executive used the same passwords at his new job and allowed vengeful current Cardinals' employees to ""hack"" his database.   This all stems from the computer that leaked all those files last year. It's a unique situation, and given everything:   1) I'm not surprised at all they got caught and  2) I doubt any other team is doing this, specifically  3) because no other teams are presented with this opportunity."

CHICubs,3a21ex,sjrossman0,13,Tue Jun 16 21:41:38 2015 UTC,God that rotation was nasty. It's pretty insane that we could add Price or Zimmerman to Arrieta/Lester/Hammel and it still wouldn't measure up to that
CHICubs,3a21ex,Sparx7,3,Tue Jun 16 17:00:59 2015 UTC,Why you gotta say stuff like that....just depresses me that we didn't win it
CHICubs,3a21ex,Tjagra,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:27:23 2015 UTC,"Well, if Price(or Zimmerman)/Arrietta/Lester/Hammel stay healthy they will be better since Wood and Prior were screwed over by Dusty and their arms fell off."
CHICubs,3a21ex,Sparx7,5,Tue Jun 16 19:45:35 2015 UTC,long term sure but in 03  Prior ERA+ 179 Wood ERA+ 136 Clement ERA+ 106 Zambrano ERA+ 139  unreallll
CHICubs,3a21ex,Xeerohour,9,Tue Jun 16 20:01:42 2015 UTC,"I had such high hopes that year. After 2003, bringing back Maddux... man.  It's such a shame that Kerry Wood and Mark Prior never fully realized their potential. Also, Zambrano pissing his away with weight and anger issues.  I still have my Zambrano jersey. Just can't bring myself to wear it."
CHICubs,3a21ex,RustyDarkstar76,4,Tue Jun 16 18:24:09 2015 UTC,"They lived up to the potential.  Injuries got them not ability, talent, or skill.  They produced, even wood did in the pen.   I wouldn't say they didn't live up to their potential, Dusty just ruined them.  Especially Prior, Wood was just gonna have issues after his Rookie year that was obvious.  Still dude was very good."
CHICubs,3a21ex,NickBR,2,Tue Jun 16 18:50:48 2015 UTC,What happened to Mark Prior still bums me out.
CHICubs,3a21ex,cuatro-,6,Thu Jun 18 04:09:48 2015 UTC,Matt Clement has to be Abraham Lincoln's great-great-grandson or something.
CHICubs,3a21ex,StewartDuck,5,Tue Jun 16 17:54:58 2015 UTC,"True story: I met Dusty Baker at the MLB Winter Meetings a few years ago. I showed him this picture. All he said was ""Oh sit, what a group."""
CHICubs,3a21ex,iDeeeeeedIt,6,Tue Jun 16 20:11:45 2015 UTC,Prolly couldn't pick out the HOFer from this pic
CHICubs,3a21ex,object_on_my_desk,9,Tue Jun 16 17:40:51 2015 UTC,He's on the right.
CHICubs,3a21ex,belfegore,5,Tue Jun 16 18:00:50 2015 UTC,"Let's see...   Clement - Got no run support as a Cub, went to Boston in 2005, had a couple good years then took a line drive off his head and never was the same. Wood - Bad mechanics and heavy workloads derailed his career, but he was fun to watch sometimes. Prior - THANKS FOR NOTHING DUSTY!  Zambrano - Had a few good years, never lived up to the hype, hissy-fitted his way out of baseball. Maddux - All-time great HoF player, played for the Cubs twice but spent his best years in Atlanta because the Cubs tried to play tough in contract negotiations after the '92 season.    I'll never forget how this team folded in 2004. Pisses me off more than 2003 as it felt the team just quit that last week of that 2004 season."
CHICubs,3a21ex,ilovelamp42,8,Tue Jun 16 21:00:49 2015 UTC,"I'd say Z lived up to the hype, he had probably 5 years as a true ace and then got in fights with Barrett and Lee, then melted down and got traded"
CHICubs,3a21ex,belfegore,2,Tue Jun 16 21:29:09 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Between 2003-2006 he was pretty good with 2004 being his best year by ERA+ and WAR (160 and 6.7, respectively). The other three years in that period his ERA+ was in the 130's and his WAR in the 5's. Outside of those four seasons, he was an above-average pitcher for five seasons (2002, 2007-2010) and below average his last two seasons in the majors. I'd consider his 2004 season ace level, but that's about it. He always walked too damn many batters."

If the home team loses every time you're there, you'll help us win the division. You then go to every Cubs road playoff game, so that the home team loses those.  And with that, you directly help the Cubs win the World Series."

CHICubs,3a4y1f,RustyDarkstar76,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:41:17 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem and I live in Denver, so I only get to watch one series with the Cubs here every year.  They've lost every game I've attended every year going back 6 years. The worst was when I went to the July 30th, 2010 game against the Rockies.  The bottom of the 8th inning lasted around 45 minutes, as the Rockies teed off on Sean Marshall, Brian Schlitter, and Andrew Cashner for a total of 12 runs on 13 hits in the bottom of the 8th alone.   This year I went to the final two games of the Cubs/Rockies series (opening series at Coors Field), and the Cubbies won both.  I'm not typically a superstitious man, but when the Cubs won I was wearing two Cubs shirts under my Cubs jersey both days.  Superstition or not, I'm wearing 3 layers of Cubs gear to every game from here on out."

CHICubs,3a4y1f,jaylocked,3,Wed Jun 17 14:19:15 2015 UTC,I'm 3-0. Plus the Brewers lost when i went to Miller and the Sox lost when I went to the Cell.   Ya'll with the bad mojo need to start donating your tickets to us with the good mojo. It's only logical.

CHICubs,3a32o7,Tjagra,4,Wed Jun 17 03:10:11 2015 UTC,Good to at least see Schwarber block a couple in the dirt this inning. Nothing too difficult but good for him to get some of those butterflies out of his stomach. Let's hope he has a good at bat here
CHICubs,3a32o7,Cohaagan,4,Wed Jun 17 03:09:00 2015 UTC,I did like his framing too.
CHICubs,3a32o7,Aaaaaagh,2,Wed Jun 17 03:10:40 2015 UTC,Yeah he had a few good ones. Staying at Catcher for life confirmed
CHICubs,3a32o7,Cohaagan,3,Wed Jun 17 03:12:43 2015 UTC,that pitch frame though!
CHICubs,3a32o7,NewArithmetic,8,Wed Jun 17 03:08:07 2015 UTC,I can't wait til we get Schwarber's pitch framing stats after this one inning and people make super exaggerated assumptions.

CHICubs,3a32o7,totheloop,3,Wed Jun 17 03:02:07 2015 UTC,Bryant has a 12 game hitting streak.

CHICubs,3a32o7,totheloop,2,Wed Jun 17 03:04:34 2015 UTC,He's always going to strike out a lot.  I will admit he's not been hitting for much power lately.  Probably been a few weeks since his last HR.  Rizzo is definitely in a cool streak.
CHICubs,3a32o7,voidecho,2,Wed Jun 17 03:07:31 2015 UTC,that means Schlitter is back
CHICubs,3a32o7,inevitablescape,3,Wed Jun 17 03:00:33 2015 UTC,Not for 10 days right?

CHICubs,3a32o7,inevitablescape,6,Wed Jun 17 02:39:47 2015 UTC,"Update on the St. Louis Cyber Criminals:   One official familiar with the investigation told Yahoo Sports the FBI traced the breach back to a house in Jupiter, Fla., the city in which the Cardinals hold spring training. A number of Cardinals employees used the house, according to the official, perhaps complicating authorities' ability to pinpoint the alleged culprits. The assistant U.S. attorney handling the potential case in Houston is Michael Chu, whose areas of focus include computer hacking and intellectual property.   http://sports.yahoo.com/news/the-real-threat-for-cardinals-is-how-high-investigation-could-reach-191525747.html"

CHICubs,3a32o7,voidecho,2,Wed Jun 17 02:14:02 2015 UTC,What's the most likely scenario which Schwarber makes his debut?  Pinch hitting for Jackson or another pitcher later in the game?  Replacing Montero?  Or waiting until tomorrow?
CHICubs,3a32o7,thats_wassup,2,Wed Jun 17 02:13:43 2015 UTC,I think he'll bat this next inning.

CHICubs,3a32o7,cubswinagain,2,Wed Jun 17 01:46:38 2015 UTC,That's the second one that was a clear strike but called a ball because Montero had to reach back across the plate.

CHICubs,3a32o7,Sparx7,2,Wed Jun 17 01:30:13 2015 UTC,We should take bets on who gets a hit first. Lester or Arrieta

CHICubs,39zjjq,fightintxag13,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:20:09 2015 UTC,Can't he get the same work in while in the pros?
CHICubs,39zjjq,ilovelamp42,2,Tue Jun 16 02:26:24 2015 UTC,"Not everyday catching work. He's not ready to play behind the plate in an MLB game yet. At least, not according to the FO. He'll get a small taste of what it's like by working with the catchers and observing for a week and then continue to plug away in AAA."
CHICubs,39zjjq,Gewehr98,2,Tue Jun 16 02:45:31 2015 UTC,Miggy is too good to have sit against righty's but maybe if we face a lefty on a non-Lester start he could play
CHICubs,39zjjq,YourCummyBear,3,Tue Jun 16 03:11:57 2015 UTC,If I'm Joe I want Miggy or Ross glued to Schwarber on the bench watching each at-bat with him and sharing their experiences with him.
CHICubs,39zjjq,Oprah-Is-My-Dad,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:07:23 2015 UTC,"That's more what I meant. I didn't mean him starting at C but rather getting practice in daily and being mentored by a guy like Ross. I feel like that's almost as valuable as playing time in AAA. Plus he'd have another entire offseason to work on it. Which as we have seen, the dude busts his ass."
CHICubs,39zjjq,fightintxag13,-1,Tue Jun 16 12:55:21 2015 UTC,I know no one wants to hear it but he's not staying behind the plate anyways
CHICubs,39zjjq,Oprah-Is-My-Dad,7,Tue Jun 16 02:13:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to begrudge you your opinion, but until the FO moves him, I'm going to operate under the assumption that that is where they want him."
CHICubs,39zjjq,fightintxag13,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:44:02 2015 UTC,"Obviously that's where they want him. But if he can't play there, (he can't) he'll be moved to the outfield"
CHICubs,39zjjq,Oprah-Is-My-Dad,5,Tue Jun 16 02:48:47 2015 UTC,What makes you so sure he can't? Honestly asking.
CHICubs,39zjjq,fightintxag13,2,Tue Jun 16 02:53:19 2015 UTC,"Every single thing I've read about him has said he can't. This is just from baseball prospectus:  Below-average defensive catcher; lateral movement on balls in the dirt is below-average; stiff hips keep him from getting side to side; quiet hands receiving pitches; pitch framing isn't perfect but isn't terribly sloppy either - won't buy his pitchers a lot of extra pitches but won't cost them too many either; fundamentally sound enough to get the job done but not athletic enough to be an asset; effective enough to play position presently, especially in part-time role, but will eventually have to move off position.  Does that give you a ton of confidence? Also it's not just that he's not very good defensively, it's that his bat is so good that it will push him to the majors before he's even close to ready to be a catcher.  Edit: I just wanted to say that I really hope he proves me wrong because that would be awesome, but it just seems really unlikely."
CHICubs,39zjjq,millardthefillmore,7,Tue Jun 16 06:43:04 2015 UTC,"If the front office says he is improving and that they think he can get to that level, then I'm inclined to believe them over a third-party website that has to do evals on thousands of players and prospects. I haven't actually seen him catch so I don't have my own judgment to rely on."
CHICubs,39zjjq,fightintxag13,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:53:13 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen him catch in my life, but I choose to disregard the people who evaluate players for a living because I don't like what they say"

CHICubs,39zjjq,JaeTheRandomHero,2,Thu Jun 18 00:37:55 2015 UTC,"One year ago, this paragraph would have read a lot differently in a negative way. He's still not average, but he was extremely below average. He has made huge progress."
CHICubs,39zjjq,fightintxag13,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:09:54 2015 UTC,"I can give one major example of why I think he can make it at catcher, Mike Piazza. It was well known he was terrible at catcher and he isnt even the worst the league has seen. Lets drop 2 more names that were terrible Chicago team catchers that bats never looked as impressive as the War Machines or Piazza. Mike Barrett and asshole A.J P are statistically some of the worst catchers, and their bats were average at best. Yet they had pretty long and successful careers. Who is to say the War Machine cant at least match the horrible defense those catchers displayed while crushing their offensive output (matching in the case of Piazza).  (side note: Miggy was a poor defensive catcher for most his career)  I think the War Machine will be our future catcher and his bat will make everybody forgive the fact he isn't a Molina or Pudge."
CHICubs,39zjjq,stackshot,2,Wed Jun 17 02:36:44 2015 UTC,We're talking about Schwarber
CHICubs,39zjjq,SomeoneCutCarlsHair,2,Tue Jun 16 03:17:02 2015 UTC,"Schwoops. My bad.  I'm just excited to see how Schwarber composes himself. He's talented as all hell, and they say his arm could turn into a strength behind the plate (even if the playcalling never comes to fruition)."

CHICubs,39zjjq,mandiblebutt,2,Tue Jun 16 04:59:59 2015 UTC,"He has to, from the Cubs perspective. Fans keep saying ""well, he can play left"" - but there's only one left field on the diamond, folks. Fans now have Bryant, Schwarber, and Happ all ticketed for it. That can't happen.   They are going to give Bryant every chance to be a mediocre third baseman and Schwarber all those chances and more to be a poor catcher. The Cubs would be ecstatic to get anything like a Mike Piazza tradeoff behind the plate."
CHICubs,39zjjq,cheese-burger-walrus,2,Tue Jun 16 06:40:04 2015 UTC,So Bryant is good enough at 3d?  I don't buy it.

CHICubs,39zjjq,The_Black_Unicorn,2,Tue Jun 16 01:49:44 2015 UTC,Maddon would bat the pitcher 9th before he put three lefty bats in a row.
CHICubs,39zjjq,THEriot2,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:49:49 2015 UTC,Yeah and with the way Castro is hitting I'd imagine he's gonna be hitting higher again soon.
CHICubs,39zjjq,THEriot2,-2,Tue Jun 16 04:05:27 2015 UTC,"with the way Castro is hitting   Yeah, I'd imagine his .652 OPS the last week would be enough to name him MVP."

CHICubs,39zjjq,THEriot2,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:31:17 2015 UTC,"Rizzo to Schwarber to Montero is lefty, lefty, lefty. While the SchWAR machine fields righty (obviously as he's catching) he bats from the left side."
CHICubs,39zjjq,THEriot2,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:40:07 2015 UTC,"Shit, you're right. For some reason (probably the throwing thing) I could've SWORE Schwarber hit right."
CHICubs,39zjjq,Tjagra,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:50:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for some reason I thought Schwar hit righty too."
CHICubs,39zjjq,Sephiroth007,8,Tue Jun 16 14:43:34 2015 UTC,So my guess is that he will be up for the next seven games mainly to be a DH. After that he will be sent down to AAA to continue work on his catching.
CHICubs,39zjjq,blyzo,7,Tue Jun 16 14:47:27 2015 UTC,That's exactly what it is.
CHICubs,39zjjq,Tjagra,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:49:39 2015 UTC,I wonder if he gets a shot behind the plate while he's up. Doubtful he'd start but I could see him pinch hit and stay in.
CHICubs,39zjjq,cheese-burger-walrus,3,Tue Jun 16 01:42:55 2015 UTC,Perhaps tomorrow if the game is close.
CHICubs,39zjjq,THEriot2,2,Tue Jun 16 01:43:36 2015 UTC,"If he is DHing the whole time, not likely.  Maddon and gang will get a chance to see him catch in person during side sessions and the like so there is no need to remove a solid defensive catcher for Schwarber...but I've been wrong every other time before."
CHICubs,39zjjq,jmr33090,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:20:48 2015 UTC,"I don't get why they called him up today if we're playing NL ball? Any idea?   Edit: Tennessee's off. That probably explains it, right?"
CHICubs,39zjjq,smellmyelbow,2,Tue Jun 16 02:26:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, Tennessee being off is likely the explanation. Also, they might want to give him a day to just relax with the team before throwing him in the lineup. I really like that idea actually."

CHICubs,39zjjq,cheese-burger-walrus,3,Tue Jun 16 01:40:06 2015 UTC,Another reason I see him going back down to AAA after those several days is because of service time or would that not be an issue?
CHICubs,39zjjq,callthebluff,5,Tue Jun 16 13:32:32 2015 UTC,"Right now the only service time that would be an issue is Super Two and the Cubs motto is ""no fucks are given about super two""  If he does.get sent back down, it would delay his call up next year by however many days he is up now.  So the drama of Bryant plus another week."

So the drama of Bryant plus another week.    They may have also committed to calling him up in Sept.  So an extra week here is less meaningful."
CHICubs,39zjjq,jmr33090,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:51:03 2015 UTC,"Right.  My thinking is they are really comfortable with his bat so they are looking to:     Showcase him for a trade His bat is ready and if he mashes he stays up but there is reduced pressure on him to perform since he ""knows"" he is being sent down after this AL trip There is a hole in his swing they want exposed so he can go to AAA and work on that He can stick at C so they are less worried about the shit storm next year as they have a very solid excuse to keep him down for the additional week"
CHICubs,39zjjq,THEriot2,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:11:09 2015 UTC,I can't imagine them trading him anytime soon.
CHICubs,39zjjq,THEriot2,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:56:37 2015 UTC,Right now the only service time that would be an issue is Super Two    That's not true at all. He'll be sent down after this interleague stretch (6 games I believe) and then he'll stay down an extra week if he's knocking on the door early next season (I don't think he will be since they're very committed to him at catcher).

CHICubs,39zjjq,THEriot2,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:17:24 2015 UTC,"Super-Two only if he stays up the whole year.  Agreed that if he gets sent back down it re-opens the ""extra"" year of control."
CHICubs,39zjjq,cheese-burger-walrus,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:14:25 2015 UTC,"Super-Two only if he stays up the whole year.   Well, no. If he's called up early next year he'll be Super 2 as well. He'll most likely be Super 2. It's almost always the most efficient way to utilize potential star prospects."
CHICubs,39zjjq,THEriot2,2,Tue Jun 16 14:14:58 2015 UTC,"Right, I may have overly simplified my initial post.  Basically: If he stays up the whole year, the Cubs will get between 6 and 7 years of service time If he stays up the whole year, he will be Super Two If he is sent down after this AL trip, the Cubs can avoid Super Two and still call him up again this year If he remains down until next year, then he just has 7 days of service time that increase the number of days the Cubs need to hold him down next year to maximize the years of control or minimize the arbitration in the future"
CHICubs,39zjjq,SomeoneSomethingJr,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:29:53 2015 UTC,"Yep, I agree with all of this.  If anyone is looking for a pretty complete rundown, read this."
CHICubs,39zjjq,ilovelamp42,3,Tue Jun 16 15:38:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's a factor here. If they are serious about developing him as a catcher, it won't be until late next year or early 2017 that we see him playing regularly for the big league Cubs. I doubt we see him behind the plate or on the field at all during this series."
CHICubs,39zjjq,cheese-burger-walrus,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:55:34 2015 UTC,"I think he'll be a 4th OF or our starting LF next year after the 20 or so days for service time. His bat is too good to leave down, and once he learns the position well enough Miggy and him can switch positions"
CHICubs,39zjjq,voidecho,-1,Tue Jun 16 16:19:50 2015 UTC,"Eh, I think this ends schwarber as a full time catcher if he needs until 2017.  If he gets sent back down he'd use up an option year, 2016 would be the same meaning that 2017 would be a make it or break it year.   Edit: Holy fuckballs I hate typing on my phone, removed stupid periods added by it."

CHICubs,39zjjq,voidecho,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:19:17 2015 UTC,"So as soon as I heard this, I bought tickets to today's game (partially because I had tix to last night's cancelled game). Is he just gonna be on the bench today?"
CHICubs,39zjjq,THEriot2,2,Tue Jun 16 02:19:05 2015 UTC,Probably first pinch hitter off the bench.
CHICubs,39zjjq,voidecho,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:21:30 2015 UTC,OR....leadoff hitter in LF.
CHICubs,39zjjq,THEriot2,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:04:21 2015 UTC,I'd be shocked since Cobra and Deno have both been hitting pretty well lately.
CHICubs,39zjjq,voidecho,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:31:15 2015 UTC,"Oh, there's no way it happens, but as someone who's got tickets tonight....it's gonna happen."
CHICubs,39zjjq,THEriot2,2,Tue Jun 16 14:46:03 2015 UTC,"Wish I could make a trip to Wrigley this year, but it's not in the plans.  I do get to see them play the Giants in August and the Iowa Cubs are playing in Sacramento in late August so if Schwarber is still playing in AAA in late August I could go see him play then."
CHICubs,39zjjq,voidecho,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:48:38 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see AT&T (still called that?). I've been lucky enough to be to a ton of parks both current and former, but the entire west coast almost makes up the entire top of my list left.  I made the trek to Iowa last summer when the ICubs had back-to-back doubleheaders to see Bryant, Baez, and Soler. Best AAA team ever? I've honestly got no clue, but it has to be in the discussion."

CHICubs,39zjjq,Loop_Within_A_Loop,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:36:05 2015 UTC,"Allow me to be devil's advocate for a moment because this smells a bit to me. First of all if anyone from the organization has earned a token call up just for a few games to DH and whatnot it's probably Vogelbach (more years, paying your dues and all that) if that's really what this is. My theory is that they are pretty sure Schwarber can't catch long term and they have their eyes on a big prize in the AL so they're showcasing him. As for who the big prize is? Total speculation but I wouldn't rule out The King out West."
CHICubs,39zjjq,THEriot2,0,Tue Jun 16 14:41:23 2015 UTC,Who got sent down? Was it Baxter? Please tell me it was Baxter.
CHICubs,39zjjq,LtDarien,2,Tue Jun 16 15:56:23 2015 UTC,It should be a pitcher...and Baxter is the least of our worries. He could be WAY worse. I don't see the problem with him off the bench for a couple months of the season.
CHICubs,39zjjq,Loop_Within_A_Loop,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:16:56 2015 UTC,Probably schlitter. We're still short a bench player.

Almora- He's still young but he's trending downwards. Hard. No way you can pencil him in with any certainty. Baez- Hopefully his ""new"" swing works better against ML pitching. Alcantra- I still think he's a better player of the bench than Herrara but I could see him being a utility man or maybe even centerfielder. Needs to step his bat game up. Mckinney- Who knows? Vogelbach- I doubt he'll ever be on the Cubs roster. Trade him for a quality reliever and I'll be happy. Happ- Let him play in the minor first.  I'm still not completely sold on Russell or Soler but I'm just wary of almost any prospect. I know, it's fun to think about but who knows what our lineup will look like in the future. Very few prospects actually turn out.  And I'm firmly in the ""don't trade Castro"" party."

CHICubs,3a2ov6,pm_me_ur_pajamas,3,Wed Jun 17 00:53:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert, but I don't think he burned a year.   Just has to bring Schwarber up six days later next year, assuming he's even on the rig league team next year."
CHICubs,3a2ov6,pm_me_ur_pajamas,0,Wed Jun 17 01:11:28 2015 UTC,"I believe that only applies to this current season. He will be under team control for seven seasons, but the difference is if they waited until 4/15ish next year then that would be year 1 of 7, now 2016 will be year 2 of 7.   If they had brought up opening day this year or next year then he'd only have 6 years of control, not 7."

I'm wondering if, for whatever reason, since it's Dish Network, it blacks out games that are on Comcast SportsNet.   All those other HOME markets (Rangers, Cards, Marlins, Mets) are Fox Sports/SNY broadcasts, not Comcast. Actually, I think all the other MLB broadcasts (except for the Giants) today are on Fox Regional networks."

CHICubs,3a1mtq,voidecho,3,Tue Jun 16 15:10:57 2015 UTC,"That's exactly right. I don't think a September call up counts as service time (could be wrong), but I don't think he'll be a September call up anyways.  Edit: I was wrong. September call up counts as service time, but not an option."

CHICubs,39ymvu,THEriot2,2,Tue Jun 16 15:27:17 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I'm not holding my breath for Neil to come back guns blazing. But all the potential additions to a bullpen that already has guys (Motte, Grimm, hell even Rondon) starting to pitch really well makes me optimistic.  I'm also a big believer that a deep bullpen is critical in making runs in September/October. So many good pitchers are throwing in the playoffs, and there are so many tight, low scoring games that even a couple runs given up by the pen can end a season."
CHICubs,39ymvu,sjrossman0,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:21:58 2015 UTC,"Yep, I agree. For bullpens, deep > good so to speak. You just can't reliably predict bullpen performance in most cases."

CHICubs,39y25c,Sparx7,4,Mon Jun 15 18:55:07 2015 UTC,"According to ESPN research, they’ve worked the count to 3-2 a total of 358 times this season, also the highest such total in MLB. Factor in pitchers hitting — the Jon Lester–led Cubs are the second-worst group of pitcher-hitters in the NL — and all of those full counts become even more impressive.  Favorite part of the article"
CHICubs,39y25c,loopscadoop,2,Mon Jun 15 20:56:05 2015 UTC,"I mean Theo & Jed pretty much stated that this is where they wanted to see the most improvement and are definitely achieving it.

CHICubs,39y25c,SomeoneSomethingJr,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:14:28 2015 UTC,"When I read it, I didn't get the feeling that the author was saying that at all. Especially with this line:   But if you’re looking for the kind of subtle advantage that could raise a team to another plane of success, much like the ’90 Yankees and the ’00s Red Sox, it’s Chicago’s ability to keep grinding out at-bats.   That's a comparison to two very successful eras with multiple World Series titles for their respective teams. Not exactly ""they're lucky to be here""."

CHICubs,39x7c3,THEriot2,2,Mon Jun 15 16:48:20 2015 UTC,"Another potential downside is too much playing too soon after a long college season, but again, you'd rather have him in the organization that way you can make that decision.   It is fairly easy to control if you have them in your system - see Schwarber last year only catching 20 games for the Cubs.  College pitchers see even less work.  But just getting them in and seeing first hand how they react to different things is worth it.  And the new signing rules make holding out less likely at this point."
CHICubs,39x7c3,callthebluff,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:02:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly, and that's why it benefits the club to have their picks in the system. It's only an issue if you have incompetent people managing your farm."

It's not like he's Gleybar Torres or Javier Baez coming into the minors before the age of 19. One can only hope that Happ progresses."

CHICubs,39vvn0,NicCage420,2,Mon Jun 15 14:38:14 2015 UTC,I dunno...fair or not Castro's got a history of trouble following him.
CHICubs,39vvn0,THEriot2,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:00:25 2015 UTC,"as someone who doesn't know anything about his off the field life, what trouble has he gotten into?"
CHICubs,39vvn0,masterfisher,0,Mon Jun 15 15:41:28 2015 UTC,"He hasn't gotten into any actual trouble, just been around it. But when trouble keeps finding you, there's some truth to ""where there's smoke there's fire.""  He had sexual assault charges against him a couple years ago (dropped). Then, this past offseason, he had two run-ins with shootings in the D.R. It was determined that he wasn't involved in either incident and that he was just around, but being involved in two of those kind of things in a couple months isn't a good sign either way. After the second incident, the FO made him move back to the States and that doesn't really speak too well either, though it was nice that he seemed to do it no questions asked.   Edit: tl;dr hasn't gotten in trouble for anything in the end, but where there's smoke there's fire type deal."
CHICubs,39vvn0,THEriot2,2,Mon Jun 15 15:59:01 2015 UTC,"The DR has shootings all the time, so it's not like being around one is all that uncommon. They'll probably happen more often in places where the wealthier people are, though. And there's no real evidence that the FO made him move to the US. In the media, he said he just wanted to get away from that stuff. Seems like that was his own decision to me."

Being around shootings is still uncommon, though.    They'll probably happen more often in places where the wealthier people are, though   Why do you say that out of curiosity? I'd say that violence is almost universally more common in more impoverished areas.   And there's no real evidence that the FO made him move to the US   Yeah, I should have noted that this was speculation. However, I think it's a more than reasonable assumption. After the second incident, we do know that he flew back to the States and met with the FO before moving to Arizona a week or two later.  Either way, I don't think it's a reason to villainize him, but there is a definite history of trouble surrounding him."
CHICubs,39vvn0,THEriot2,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:44:07 2015 UTC,"Regarding the second point, you're right. My wording was wrong. I just meant that it would seem to me that in a place like the DR, where drugs are pretty common and there isn't fantastic law enforcement, the very wealthy would probably hang out in places where you might find drug dealers and bodyguards who would have firearms, and tensions may be high."
CHICubs,39vvn0,HelloControl_,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:46:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that makes sense. Either way, you're more likely to be surrounded by something like this in the D.R. without a doubt. I just don't really get why these rich ballplayers go back there all the time. It's easy for me to say that as I'm able to live comfortably AND be in my homeland, but you hear about guys like Wilson Ramos's mother being abducted or Ugueth Urbina & Angel Villalona machete murdering people (pretty sure they both used a machete) and at some point you would think they'd give up their homeland to protect themselves and their families."

CHICubs,39vvn0,AmericanSatellite9,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:24:50 2015 UTC,His season is actually quite good offensively compared to other nl short stops.  It's the errors and shaky defense that I don't like.    Edit: ok GOOD might not be the best word but you still have to judge him fairly among other ss.
CHICubs,39vvn0,explosivo563,6,Mon Jun 15 07:05:51 2015 UTC,He still has a .660 OPS and a .300 OBP. In no world is that acceptable.   He's been a replacement-level player thus far. He still has a ways to go to make his 2015 look better.
CHICubs,39vvn0,stackshot,2,Mon Jun 15 07:54:19 2015 UTC,you still have to judge him fairly among other ss.   He's ranked 9th out of 12 qualified NL shortstops in wRC+. That's not good or even average. That's bad. Add in his defense and he's one of the two worst SS in the NL this year.
CHICubs,39vvn0,Asmodeus10,3,Mon Jun 15 18:19:52 2015 UTC,"good? really? he has only 5 doubles, thats dead last among qualified SS. just 1 triple. he has a OPS of .659. a lot of GIDP and a shitty SO/BB ratio. no, hes not having a good season ofensively. doesnt matter what the others are doing, hes still bad for his contract and past production. 2013 aside, thats his worst year so far. but hes getting better this last few series, so lets hope that he can heat up and go back to 2014 castro. but i would be way more comfortable with Russell being our SS and Castro 2B...   his defense is what it kills him. if he was a good defender no one would talk about him like that. but when you are literally the worst defensively and cant produce ofensively, there will be a lot of deserved criticism."
CHICubs,39vvn0,zrk23,3,Mon Jun 15 09:05:40 2015 UTC,"To be fair, his contract is actually really team friendly, so I wouldn't say he's bad for his contract.  Also, it kinda sucks that his walk off last night only counts as a single. I kinda wish he would've ran to second to get a double because let's face it, any other situation, that's a standing double.  Yes, he's had a bad season so far relative to other seasons. But like you mentioned, he seems to be really squaring the ball up that last week or so. Let's hope it continues.  On another note, Russell has the worst fielding percentage of any second baseman in the majors. Is some of it due to switching positions? Maybe, but I don't believe it's a big reason. He's young, he'll get better. But right now, I don't think Russell is gonna be a huge upgrade at SS."
CHICubs,39vvn0,jmr33090,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:01:34 2015 UTC,"Russell is absolutely a major upgrade over Castro defensively at SS.  You could go by the scouts, you could go by the defensive metrics, but it's definitely the smartest bet.   Addison's defensive value shows he's playing much better than you'd think."
CHICubs,39vvn0,stackshot,2,Mon Jun 15 16:17:07 2015 UTC,"Just watching the games, he seems to make the same errors as Castro - on routine plays, yet they both make plays that are very difficult.  Don't get me wrong, I believe Russell should be moved to SS in the offseason. I just don't think it's the right move mid season."
CHICubs,39vvn0,jmr33090,0,Mon Jun 15 16:33:07 2015 UTC,"I can understand that, as long as we agree that 2015 is Castro's swan song at SS."

CHICubs,39vvn0,THEriot2,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:48:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not disagreeing with you, so just know that. I just read through these comments under you and found mysekf thinking something very profound.   I think the cubs fan base is probably the most diverse fan base in Chicago. Not in terms of demographics, but in terms of the type of fans.   I think there are still the old school, just there for the good time type and they seem to be optimistic generally.   I also think there are the overly pessimistic cubs fans, that are sick of waiting and never think the cubs are good.  I think we have the millennial crowd, which I am a part of, that has somewhat had an overall positive relationship with the cubs. Meaning I think some of us are optimistic because of this, but some of us have had our hearts broken as well in our relatively speaking short fandom.   So, having said that, I think the millennials have some optimistic fun types and some fans who are even keel and analytical types that understand the new stats and can separate emotion from player evaluations. All the while, still caring as much as anyone.   Long winded I know, but my point here is that I think it's hard to throw a blanket over cubs fans."

With that being true, offensively and defensively overall, Castro's season value is awful. This is really clear-cut, too. (A great week is a great weekt. Long way still to go, like I said)"

CHICubs,39vvn0,BRETTV50,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:10:38 2015 UTC,The main problem is that he doesn't get many hits besides singles. He plays basically every game which is why he has so many hits. He also doesn't really walk.  Unfortunately leading the team in hits doesn't necessarily mean hes contributing to the team in an overall positive manner.
CHICubs,39vvn0,StewartDuck,-2,Mon Jun 15 21:50:00 2015 UTC,"Oh, great. He's still been one of the worst everyday players in baseball.  I didn't know this was 1995."

Great ad hominem argument, though. I'd love to hear something actual to refute the fact that Castro has been terrible.

The scary thing? He's possibly been worse this year than 2013. Depends on how you want to evaluate the defense, but with the bat, he's been very similar."
CHICubs,39vvn0,THEriot2,2,Mon Jun 15 15:54:09 2015 UTC,He had a bad month in a still young season.  Let's see where he ends up in September and then we can decide if he is doing worse than 2013.

Edit - I want him to stay forever though."
CHICubs,39vvn0,beegeepee,3,Mon Jun 15 07:56:23 2015 UTC,"With Baez being a little slow to adjust to the MLB, I would be suprised if the Cubs let Castro go.  Yes they have a lot of young talent, but Castro is at least a proven player.  He might not have the ceiling as some of the younger players, but he has at least been above average every year of his career.  Also, Addison Russell hasn't been hitting all that well yet, and who is to say he will ever adjust.  Odds are he will, but it isn't guaranteed.     The problem with trading Castro is most teams will probably try to low-ball the Cubs.  Especially when he isn't performing at his peak."

I think the reason his signing bonus was so low is because he's graduating college. If he was coming out of high school or still in the middle of his college years he would have leverage since he could just go/return to college if he didn't get an offer he liked. Now his only alternative to taking whatever the team offered him is playing in an independent league for a year and re entering the draft next year, and playing in an unaffiliated league for a year would not help his draft stock or long term development.

CHICubs,39xcsj,slicebishybosh,10,Mon Jun 15 15:55:59 2015 UTC,Wrigley is going to be dead while outside will be insane.  Theres no way I'd be going to the cubs game
CHICubs,39xcsj,Sparx7,6,Mon Jun 15 17:25:20 2015 UTC,I have tickets as well. Hoping the game gets postponed.
CHICubs,39xcsj,ViaChicago3441,3,Mon Jun 15 17:01:33 2015 UTC,I have fantastic tickets to tonight's game and I hope the game gets postponed. Ugh.
CHICubs,39xcsj,Fucking_Casuals,5,Mon Jun 15 17:43:22 2015 UTC,"I almost feel like the Cubs will be more inclined to postpone because of the Hawks. Now, there has to be a legitimate reason like rain, but i think they'll try and pull the trigger a bit early like they did with that Cardinals game in the opening series. They knew they could make it up when the bleachers would be open.   Keep in mind there is the Indians franchise too. I'm sure they don't want to travel back to Chicago at the end of the year unless it perfectly lines up with a White Sox trip."
CHICubs,39xcsj,MrJigglyBrown,2,Mon Jun 15 18:30:37 2015 UTC,"Double-header tomorrow would be sweet. Also the forecast does call for rain all night, or at least a chance. It seems like there won't be a window to get 5 innings in."
CHICubs,39xcsj,beernbenoz,3,Mon Jun 15 18:49:38 2015 UTC,"This is a tough question to answer. It's Monday, rain in the forecast & a ton of tickets are selling on StubHub for less than 20 bucks. Very mixed. I'd be happy to take them off your hands though should you decide not to attend. ;)"
CHICubs,39xcsj,Doogolas33,3,Mon Jun 15 16:12:54 2015 UTC,It'll probably still be packed. There's almost surely 35000 people who don't care.
CHICubs,39xcsj,Sparx7,3,Mon Jun 15 18:04:20 2015 UTC,Its a monday night and has been raining all day.  I'm gonna bet no
CHICubs,39xcsj,nklotz,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:55:43 2015 UTC,"Not a chance. I was at the game Saturday night and it was maaaybe half full if I'm being generous. Obviously left once the rain delay started, but I imagine with a chance to clinch at home tonight it's going to look like that Orioles - White Sox game during the riots."
CHICubs,39xcsj,Lone_Wolf,3,Mon Jun 15 20:22:16 2015 UTC,Only 2 more days till we get to see the Cubs play the Tribe here in Cleveland...  Can't wait!  Will be the first game I've been to since my wife got us opening day tickets the year we were married.

CHICubs,39xcsj,designgoddess,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:21:54 2015 UTC,It would be cool if they showed some of the game between innings.
CHICubs,39xcsj,designgoddess,2,Mon Jun 15 19:47:18 2015 UTC,"I hope they postpone it, but allow people with tickets to still come in and watch the hawks game on the big screen."
CHICubs,39xcsj,Tjagra,2,Mon Jun 15 19:59:03 2015 UTC,That would be cool other than the rain part. Unless they let everyone use the tarp as a slip and slide. Then the rain would be cool as well.

I'm supposed to go on a business trip in the morning, and I would have gone straight to bed after I got home around 10:30, but since the game was on ESPN, I turned it on while in bed.  At some point in the 10th inning, I found it strange that I hadn't seen the automatic check-in message that I would usually get for these trips. After searching through my e-mail, I confirmed that I hadn't actually received one, and the reason for that was that I hadn't even reserved my plane ticket, rental car, or hotel yet. I had started this process last week, but I never hit the ""confirm"" button because I got distracted at work. I frantically logged into my laptop and booked all of those things, and we're good now.  If the Cubs hadn't had a late game, I might have arrived at the airport without a ticket."

CHICubs,39vm4k,voidecho,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:41:08 2015 UTC,"Another great win this team just keeps finding a way. Castro's homer on Friday was one of those things that just jump starts a guy's season. Hate to be a wet blanket but Lester's issues holding base runners are just ridiculous at this point. Sure Billy Hamilton is going to steal on most people but the fact that he can't even trust himself to throw to second when a guy has a thirty foot lead, leads me to believe that he has a fatal flaw."
CHICubs,39vm4k,TheFakeTimShady,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:44:35 2015 UTC,Yeah...he literally just needs to throw one guy out who's got a crazy lead and it'll cut down on future runner's leads.  Hamilton was likely to get to third on a steal anyways so throwing the ball into Center Field really wouldn't have changed anything.

CHICubs,39uc1r,Jollyman21,6,Mon Jun 15 03:56:16 2015 UTC,An 8.10 ERA? And he's getting paid to do it?!? I can do that for free!

CHICubs,39uly1,superxero044,4,Sun Jun 14 23:26:05 2015 UTC,"How many options does he have left? At some point this has to end, right?"
CHICubs,39uly1,designgoddess,5,Sun Jun 14 23:55:25 2015 UTC,There's a rule where if it's within so many days an option isn't used.
CHICubs,39uly1,FxStryker,0,Mon Jun 15 00:23:57 2015 UTC,Damn.
CHICubs,39uly1,designgoddess,7,Mon Jun 15 00:40:25 2015 UTC,"My understanding is options are based on years.  So a player has three option years. So a team can move him freely at anytime they want within the first five years in the league. Once he is placed on the 40 man and moved into the active roster the option year clock starts. If he then moved down and stays on the minor league team for more than 20 days one of the 3 option years are used.   As is my understanding Schlitter had an option year used in 2010, 2014, and now 2015. So he is out of options years. However he can be moved freely between Iowa and Chicago this whole season. Where as next season he would need to be to DFA.  Lake however has had only used two option years. 2013 and 2015. Now 2014 because he wasn't in Iowa more than 20 days before his call up again in September. But he was assigned to Minor League camp starting the season so that used an option year."

CHICubs,39uly1,designgoddess,2,Mon Jun 15 04:41:10 2015 UTC,Hopefully he's just up for if this game goes 20 and Ross already pitched a few

CHICubs,39uly1,IDCimSTRONGERtnUinRL,-3,Sun Jun 14 23:20:08 2015 UTC,Honestly I believe celebrating that home run sealed his fate in Chicago. Madison is a great skipper and he doesn't want that clown shoe behavior around. Much respect. Lake will be traded soon. God bless.   -Petey Peppers
CHICubs,39uly1,Petey_Peppers,2,Mon Jun 15 01:13:24 2015 UTC,"Maddon was on the radio talking about how he doesn't care about the superficial parts of the game. So, thats probably not the case."

CHICubs,39uly1,elliottstanger,-1,Mon Jun 15 02:15:49 2015 UTC,Can we just trade for Papelbon already?
CHICubs,39uly1,BuddyTheElfTagpro,-2,Sun Jun 14 22:50:19 2015 UTC,At least this should be the final nail on the Schitter coffin.
CHICubs,39uly1,pm_me_ur_pajamas,2,Sun Jun 14 23:16:15 2015 UTC,"I thought the last time he fucked up it was the final chance, and the time before that one."
CHICubs,39uly1,IDCimSTRONGERtnUinRL,-1,Sun Jun 14 23:20:52 2015 UTC,"They could be giving him one last audition to see if he or Russell should go once the Soriano signing is official. Plus, they'll need to bring back Ramirez and Turner in the near future, so it's not like he'll be around for long."
CHICubs,39uly1,pm_me_ur_pajamas,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:39:18 2015 UTC,Seems like Soriano wouldn't contribute until July and Ramirez hasn't made much progress.
CHICubs,39uly1,Milesweeman,0,Mon Jun 15 00:47:25 2015 UTC,I'd prefer keeping Russell over Schlitter simply because he's a lefty
CHICubs,39uly1,IDCimSTRONGERtnUinRL,0,Sun Jun 14 23:51:33 2015 UTC,Rosscup and Wood are both lefties. Not sure if three is one too many.
CHICubs,39uly1,pm_me_ur_pajamas,0,Sun Jun 14 23:54:34 2015 UTC,Wood might be on his way back into the rotation; I agree 3 might seem unconventional but I think it could work.
CHICubs,39uly1,IDCimSTRONGERtnUinRL,0,Mon Jun 15 00:00:08 2015 UTC,"I think putting Wood back in would be a mistake. He's been dominant as a reliever and they need to see how Turner can do once he's healthy. Plus, if they can flip Baez, Vogelbach, and a couple other pieces for Hammels then the rotation is fine."
CHICubs,39uly1,pm_me_ur_pajamas,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:06:51 2015 UTC,"Baez isn't going anywhere, especially now that he's out for 4-8 weeks.  I'd be OK with dealing for bullpen help, wait for the offseason to sign some starters"
CHICubs,39wy4d,amatom27,4,Mon Jun 15 13:58:45 2015 UTC,That game sold out almost instantly. You'll have to get creative with $60 but maybe you can score some bleacher seats. Face value for those were around $90
CHICubs,39wy4d,STUstone,2,Mon Jun 15 14:10:13 2015 UTC,With the Sox scuffling the resale market might come down a bit.
CHICubs,39wy4d,NicCage420,2,Mon Jun 15 14:42:00 2015 UTC,"One of the biggest games of the season. I would take whatever I could get for $60, if I were you."

CHICubs,39wy4d,Sparx7,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:17:09 2015 UTC,"I'd shoot for upper deck box. The seats are generally less expensive than the 200 seats (lower bowl underneath the upper deck), and you get a better view without the risk of being behind a pole."
CHICubs,39tm2m,voidecho,2,Sun Jun 14 17:33:41 2015 UTC,"He looked good out there. Wish the K's were higher from a vet pitching in AA, but he was good none the less"
CHICubs,39tm2m,asovermann,2,Sun Jun 14 17:46:21 2015 UTC,I really want to see him get a chance to get that 5th starter spot. He's out of minor league options so after his 5th rehab start he has to be on 25 man or pass waivers. DFA Jackson!
CHICubs,39tm2m,nakolas,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:54:34 2015 UTC,Why are we DFAing him? He's pitching well.
CHICubs,39tm2m,Doogolas33,2,Sun Jun 14 18:20:37 2015 UTC,"As a long reliever, with less than 20 innings pitched. He will regress."
CHICubs,39tm2m,nakolas,2,Sun Jun 14 18:29:45 2015 UTC,"His FIP disagrees. He doesn't have a great xFIP mind you, but he should see more K's, so I doubt it will matter. We are much more likely to send Wada down or DFA Wood."
CHICubs,39tm2m,Doogolas33,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:47:38 2015 UTC,Isn't Wada in the same boat as Turner? He has to be on the 25 man or clear waivers? And Wood is a lefty and has not been in the pen for too long. I think Maddon would say he is more valuable than E-Jax.
CHICubs,39tm2m,nakolas,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:54:00 2015 UTC,"Wood and Wada just aren't good. And we simply don't need both. They're much more likely leave than Jackson, who is at last looking solid from the pen and is consistently hitting 95+."
CHICubs,39tm2m,Doogolas33,2,Sun Jun 14 19:02:10 2015 UTC,"Wada's xFIP is 3.74, which isn't that bad. Other than Maddon not letting him throw more than 70 pitches, he's pretty good for a 5th starter."
CHICubs,39tm2m,FredKarlekKnark,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:24:58 2015 UTC,He's not gonna keep that up. His xFIP is that good because of inflated K's from his insane number of looking strikeouts. He is probably better than Wood though. Wood gone is my first choice.
CHICubs,39tm2m,Doogolas33,2,Sun Jun 14 19:30:49 2015 UTC,"He's a Tank Commander, better suited to helping a team tank which the Cubs are no longer doing. A team like the Phillies if they really wanna get locked into a high draft position would call upon the services of the Tank Commander and give us Palpbon for the right to draft in the top 3."
CHICubs,39tm2m,Gimmie_Dat_Stream,0,Sun Jun 14 21:16:50 2015 UTC,I'd rather DFA Russell.
CHICubs,39tm2m,JCardCubs,3,Sun Jun 14 18:41:49 2015 UTC,Because of one bad outing?
CHICubs,39tm2m,Mrpenguindeluxe,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:44:00 2015 UTC,"Well, last night certainly doesn't help. But, I was just saying compared to the other guy wanting to bounce Jackson, I think I'd stick with Jackson. But, we need to LHP in the bullpen as well. I'm not saying send his ass down the line now, but saying I'd rather hold on to Jackson."
CHICubs,39tm2m,JCardCubs,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:49:39 2015 UTC,I understand where you're coming from. With as much as the Cubs owe Jackson it's not so easy just getting rid of him. And he has been manageable so far but he isn't trusted in high stress situations. I'd probably drop Wood first or maybe even Wada when Turner comes back. But obviously I don't run a baseball team. I can barely manage a fantasy team for that matter lol.
CHICubs,39tm2m,Mrpenguindeluxe,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:56:50 2015 UTC,Armchair baseball decision makers unite! I'd say drop Wood first. Wada seems like he would make a great reliever. His first time or two through the lineup is usually lights out.
CHICubs,39tm2m,yusuf69,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:24:42 2015 UTC,And Wood has been terrible in the pen? Wood and Wada are pretty much the same. Take the younger guy of the two.
CHICubs,39tm2m,FxStryker,2,Sun Jun 14 23:32:33 2015 UTC,"Man I really hope he can put it together. So much potential and he's so young. I've mentioned it before, been following him since his days in Detroit. Big fan of Jacob Turner right here!"

CHICubs,39tz1y,MLBVideoConverterBot,3,Sun Jun 14 19:27:39 2015 UTC,"Is it just me or has Vogelbach lost some weight? If he can keep dropping pounds, maybe he'd be good for something other than DH."
CHICubs,39tz1y,jmr33090,3,Sun Jun 14 19:31:19 2015 UTC,"He's still listed around 250, he's like 25 pounds down from when he was drafted, but I don't see him playing anything but 1st/DH"
CHICubs,39tz1y,asovermann,-1,Sun Jun 14 20:12:13 2015 UTC,Some people say putting him at 1st is very optimistic.
CHICubs,39tz1y,pm_me_ur_pajamas,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:32:19 2015 UTC,"He definitely has lost weight, but odds are he's still locked into the 1B/DH profile. Maybe with a couple years of work he could be passable in left."
CHICubs,39tz1y,NicCage420,2,Sun Jun 14 22:34:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly I just meant maybe he'd be good for 1b. At his current weight I don't have confidence in him there at all. Granted, it's not gonna matter if he can play it or not since we have Rizzo, but if he drops weight and becomes a better defensive player, he gains a lot of trade value."
CHICubs,39tz1y,jmr33090,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:44:58 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to remember scouting reports, but I believe he's considered an acceptable first baseman now, ceiling defensively is league average."
CHICubs,39tz1y,NicCage420,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:07:37 2015 UTC,I guess I hadn't looked in a while. Last I checked he was being touted as a DH with a long way to go to be at 1B
CHICubs,39tz1y,jmr33090,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:57:29 2015 UTC,"Odds still are his future is primarily as a DH, but there's been far worse defensive options that have played everyday at 1B."
CHICubs,39rgmx,penguinopph,46,Sun Jun 14 01:06:00 2015 UTC,I like the relationship between the Cubs and Hawks.

CHICubs,39rgmx,tpr68,24,Sun Jun 14 03:09:18 2015 UTC,Fantastic. Crowd went nuts when we won. Lots of fun - it's like we took a break to watch the whole Hawks game and now get to finish the Cubs game.

CHICubs,39qq80,sjrossman0,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:48:37 2015 UTC,I distinctly remember watching that game. Weird how that specific one seems to stand out to just about everyone.
CHICubs,39qq80,___worm___,2,Sun Jun 14 05:44:39 2015 UTC,I remember that being the turning point of the season. Plus I lived in Milwaukee at the time and the Brewer bandwagon was unbearable.
CHICubs,39qq80,sjrossman0,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:41:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it absolutely was the turning point. The Brewers went into a tailspin after that, too. Funny, how one moment is the fulcrum for the entire season for 2 teas."
CHICubs,39qq80,frastmaz,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:25:19 2015 UTC,"Believe I was at that game.  They were down 5-0 after the first, and held them from there on.  And then they scored 3 or 4 runs in the 9th including that 3 run walk off by Aramis."
CHICubs,39qq80,jakebas10,2,Sun Jun 14 22:16:09 2015 UTC,"I remember that game like it was yesterday. 5-0 after the first, including a 3 run homer by Kevin Mench. I think it was a 3 run 9th for the Cubs."

CHICubs,39naj4,Riderz_of_Brohan,11,Fri Jun 12 23:32:31 2015 UTC,"Love the balls it took to even come back. Going against Cueto, crappy weather, they could have just folded up the tent but they didn't. Big homer from Castro, that's the type of thing that jumpstarts a season. Had them beat and it took a great play to keep the game alive. Gotta clean up the defense but on a day they didn't play their best to still have a shot at it is worth something. Oh well, onto the next. Man, I'd love to have someone like Chapman closing out games for my squad."
CHICubs,39naj4,TheFakeTimShady,2,Fri Jun 12 23:35:49 2015 UTC,I live in W. Ky so I am forced to watch the Reds feed for some reason. The best part about that homer was the amount of shit the Reds announcers were talking about Castro the second before he jacked one. It happens every fucking time.
CHICubs,39naj4,ceepington,8,Sat Jun 13 18:46:51 2015 UTC,"Well, fuck  Seeing-eye hits, a wind-blown homer and errors. Sucks to lose a game like this, but clearly it wasn't our day. Here's hoping for a dominant start from Hendricks tomorrow and another in-division win.   We've got a good stretch here and need to make some hay while the sun shines."
CHICubs,39naj4,terker,5,Fri Jun 12 23:30:51 2015 UTC,"A thought... We can honestly win any game we are a part of... my disappointment in this, or any loss this year, feels so much different."

CHICubs,39naj4,SomeoneSomethingJr,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:31:36 2015 UTC,He looks like a left fielder playing third base. Further sample size is likely to prove the same thing.

CHICubs,39lww3,xconzo,3,Fri Jun 12 18:05:31 2015 UTC,Baez for a reliever would be too much I would think.
CHICubs,39lww3,iam2eeyore,7,Fri Jun 12 18:17:51 2015 UTC,Agreed but I don't feel that it's out of line for them asking if Chapman is involved.
CHICubs,39lww3,Mrpenguindeluxe,2,Fri Jun 12 18:34:39 2015 UTC,But look how much had to be given up for krimbel who has been better than chapman for most.
CHICubs,39lww3,YourCummyBear,3,Fri Jun 12 19:41:06 2015 UTC,"Matt Wisler is a top 5 talent in the Braves farm system. He looks like a shiny piece that Atlanta got for Kimbrel. It's still an incredibly hard thing to judge, but I wouldn't give up Baez for him. I haven't given up on Baez."
CHICubs,39lww3,Mrpenguindeluxe,2,Fri Jun 12 22:04:33 2015 UTC,"Baez for a reliver yes, Baez for Chapman is q little different, id do it in a heartbeat"
CHICubs,39lww3,bobbyhill626,4,Fri Jun 12 20:21:11 2015 UTC,"I would love Chapman. He's a guy you hate to go against, but I'm sure nobody would complain if he was closing out the ninth for the Cubs."
CHICubs,39lww3,asovermann,2,Fri Jun 12 18:45:17 2015 UTC,"Me too, but I don't think Maddon would make him a straight up closer.  I think he would use Rondon, Chapman, Soriano, Ramirez, and Grimm just however he sees fit game to game.  That would be nasty."
CHICubs,39lww3,NLRD,3,Sat Jun 13 12:37:10 2015 UTC,"It's worth pointing out that a lot of what we hear about Amaro/the Phillies is exaggerated. I'm sure they have high asking prices but nothing as insane as the ""Taijuan Walker or James Paxton for Ben Revere"" rumor that went around yesterday. Papelbon might not be cheap, but that's a result of a trade market with fewer sellers than buyers.  One possibility that is not included in the original post is Tyler Clippard from the A's. The biggest question there is when the A's will consider selling, as they still have a shot at catching up in a fairly mediocre division."
CHICubs,39lww3,SomeoneSomethingJr,3,Fri Jun 12 18:46:15 2015 UTC,I would kill for Clippard
CHICubs,39lww3,SwankDR,2,Fri Jun 12 23:18:29 2015 UTC,"He's been pretty rough this season.  ERA looks good but his peripherals paint an ugly picture.  He's walking nearly double what he normally walks and striking out 3 less per 9IP.    I'm very luke warm on him right now.  I'd like to see him fix this before I'm all over him.  He's a pending FA.  So I wouldn't mind getting him, but it's all about price and his ability to strike people out and limit the walks."
CHICubs,39lww3,1908_Cubs,2,Sat Jun 13 02:21:06 2015 UTC,"You're right--I hadn't looked at his peripherals, I just remember him being dominant with the Nats"
CHICubs,39lww3,SwankDR,2,Sat Jun 13 02:23:45 2015 UTC,"NO WAY the Cubs make a trade with either of those clubs if it doesn't involve Baez. I think his injury and lack of playing time is the only reason we don't have another top of the rotation starter. Alcantara is nothing more than a spare part now, and packaged with Baez is probably what the FO intended to use to bulk up the rotation. Wood and Jackson are gone as soon as the bullpen shakes itself out."
CHICubs,39lww3,MyIsland,2,Fri Jun 12 18:19:28 2015 UTC,"I don't see them getting rid of Wood. He's been really good since moving to the bullpen, though I know it's a small sample size. The other consideration though is that he's the best option in the bullpen for long middle relief when the starter has an off day and leaves early. I don't see any reason to get rid of him."
CHICubs,39lww3,jmr33090,3,Fri Jun 12 18:37:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Wood is still ahead of Russell and Rosscup in my book."
CHICubs,39lww3,NLRD,2,Sat Jun 13 12:38:54 2015 UTC,With the current roster you'd be correct. Wada is going to need a role if we get another starter though...........
CHICubs,39lww3,MyIsland,2,Fri Jun 12 19:04:37 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah. My comment was assuming they trade for a reliever and not a starter. If they do trade for a starter, well, yeah, decision time."
CHICubs,39lww3,jmr33090,2,Fri Jun 12 19:06:36 2015 UTC,"Assuming the Reds want too much for Chapman, what if we went for K-Rod? Milwaukee is bare at first base. Would you swap Vogelbach for  Rodriguez to shore up the bullpen?"
CHICubs,39lww3,PeterBernsteinSucks,2,Fri Jun 12 19:18:31 2015 UTC,Teams hate trading within the division and it usually cost a premium to do it. It happens but teams generally try to trade outside the division.

CHICubs,39lww3,Dhash23,2,Fri Jun 12 23:43:33 2015 UTC,I'll be open to all trade talks that involve anyone from the minors being shopped. Just don't touch the starting 9.
CHICubs,39lww3,NLRD,2,Sat Jun 13 07:19:29 2015 UTC,"I think somebody puts together a big package for Cueto and Chapman if the Reds are willing to sell.  I'm not sure the Cubs are that team, because it would take about 3 really good prospects to get it done."
CHICubs,39lww3,blyzo,2,Sat Jun 13 12:34:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not actually that worried about the bullpen, they've pitched pretty great the last week or so. And will only get better when Ramirez returns.   I'd rather we be looking for a more solid 5th starter, but even that's not worth trading any major prospect for.   That said, Chapman sure would look great in Cubbie blue."
CHICubs,39lww3,bobbyhill626,2,Sat Jun 13 17:50:43 2015 UTC,....K-Rod? It isn't 2007 anymore

CHICubs,39lww3,1908_Cubs,5,Fri Jun 12 19:12:17 2015 UTC,"That window closed like, 5 years ago, man.  He has 2 pitches.  And hasn't been stretched out for YEARS.    He will never start a game."

Ramirez then struck out the next two hitters, one swinging and one looking. He threw 17 pitches (11 strikes), and was pulled from the game when he reached his pre-planned pitch limit.   Mike Olt played 3rd base for three innings for the Mesa Cubs and got four Plate Appearances, one in each of the first four innings.

CHICubs,39l9ny,Rapture00,8,Fri Jun 12 18:55:42 2015 UTC,"One game at a time. That's how the deficit to the Cardinals gets closed. The team can't look too far ahead, especially in games against sub-.500 teams. That's how you lose to worse teams. Rather, every game is an opportunity to go 1-0, and if you go 1-0, you have a chance to make up a game."

CHICubs,39jbx8,Snailz,5,Fri Jun 12 04:25:58 2015 UTC,"Just didn't quite have his stuff. First inning was 1-2-3 on 10 pitches, but then threw 30 in the 2nd and had a bumpy 3rd. It was a good call by Joe. No damage done by pulling a struggling starter early and putting in a former starter for long relief."
CHICubs,39jbx8,charles32915,2,Fri Jun 12 04:50:34 2015 UTC,"Also, I think Maddon's pulled him early thinking the game may not go the full nine with the rain coming."
CHICubs,39jbx8,voidecho,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:39:04 2015 UTC,Wada was at least very competent last year. Is the injury still affecting him or is something else going on?
CHICubs,39jbx8,SenseiCAY,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:09:16 2015 UTC,He was good in his first couple of starts
CHICubs,39jbx8,octobadger,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:16:37 2015 UTC,"Maddon said in an interview that mentally, he is not playing his usually game. He says Wada's got to be more ""assertive"" and ""aggressive"" instead of over thinking every pitch. Besides that, he's still an extra year older in his mid 30's with a fastball that tops out at 89. But no one in the Cubs seem to express any concern so it looks like he still has the ability to find his stride like he did last year."

CHICubs,39jbx8,JCardCubs,4,Fri Jun 12 03:10:43 2015 UTC,"A pitcher has to go 5 innings to be able to get the win, so the 6th inning is the earliest he can be removed to get the win."

CHICubs,39jbx8,Rearden_Steel,3,Fri Jun 12 03:45:12 2015 UTC,The minimum amount of innings a starting pitcher has to pitch to get a win is 5. That's why Travis Wood got the dub.

CHICubs,39hz3b,an_abyss_in_motion,5,Fri Jun 12 02:21:52 2015 UTC,"Starters only pitch once every 5 days, which allows them to go a lot longer than the average reliever."

CHICubs,39hz3b,DavidBenAkiva,5,Fri Jun 12 02:24:29 2015 UTC,Relief pitchers are used more frequently than every 5 to 7 days so many times it is either to preserve their arms or they are changed situationally depending on right vs left matchups.
CHICubs,39hz3b,los_pollos-hermanos,3,Fri Jun 12 02:24:17 2015 UTC,Match ups are pretty much the primary reason why they tend to go only one inning.

CHICubs,39jl0t,Slednvrfed,2,Sat Jun 13 01:50:40 2015 UTC,I just have a weird thing about interviews like that. It always makes me uncomfortable when I can tell the famous person is doing somebody a favor and doesn't really want to be there and the other guy is trying too hard to get his show/blog/web series off the ground.

CHICubs,39jl0t,TheFakeTimShady,2,Fri Jun 12 14:42:59 2015 UTC,"I really expected with 30 seconds uninterrupted (which felt more like 20), he'd have made a Anthony Rizzo Foundation pitch. The product placement was a little uncomfortable. Plus, as others have said, awkward cuts, too much of the host and not enough Rizzo, and it felt like all his answers got cut at just a couple words. Not impressed, and won't be returning to the Hot Ones series."

Especially with Lopez/Teagarden in AAA handling the duties.  They just moved Davis OFF of catcher this week.  Would be odd to bring up Contreras then.    Overall it's just odd.  Maybe it's a slight injury and no one is reporting it.  Like I said, Rosenthal was awesome and got back to me saying he was told it was nothing.

Sox fans hate the Cubs, Cubs fans hate the Sox. Its just natural. They are the bad guys, etc and all that. I still hate the Cardinals more, but thats probably due to their long lasting success. Along with the Packers, the Sox and Cards are in my top 3 of most hated sports teams."

CHICubs,39gdhr,Doogolas33,7,Thu Jun 11 15:39:47 2015 UTC,I don't think we need Zobrist with how well Denorfia is playing right now. Papelbon would be great if he didn't cost a lot of money or prospects.
CHICubs,39gdhr,octobadger,2,Thu Jun 11 16:26:08 2015 UTC,"this, and this. we could use papelbon but not desperately to where we should give up a player like Baez. I feel like trading a good prospect for papelbon would be very unTheo-like"
CHICubs,39gdhr,Jemidar_,2,Thu Jun 11 17:54:06 2015 UTC,There is no chance it would be someone 'like Baez'. If we give up anyone (as we would almost surely be taking almost the entire contract) it would be some low A player that is maybe barely our top 30.
CHICubs,39gdhr,Doogolas33,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:03:12 2015 UTC,well then what are we waiting for? lets fucking do it.
CHICubs,39gdhr,Jemidar_,2,Thu Jun 11 18:48:07 2015 UTC,"The problem is dealing with Ruben Amaro, Jr.  He's probably asking for Kris Bryant and Addison Russelll plus we take on the whole contract (Hyperbole, but you know what I mean).  You just can't negotiate with people like him."

I'd rather just take the season and see where we are.  See if Castro is worth anything at SS.  See if Baez can play 3B.  See if Wada is worth anything.  I'd rather save the prospects and go in to 2016 with some ammunition.  If we can get Papelbon on the cheap I am down with that or another BP arm, but past that I am pretty good to be honest."
CHICubs,39gdhr,poodski92782,2,Thu Jun 11 16:31:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with regard to seeing where things go, but I'm all for Papelbon assuming the Phillies just want out of the contract. I think he's very worth the $20 mil altogether for this year and next that we'd be giving him."
CHICubs,39gdhr,Doogolas33,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:46:45 2015 UTC,"I somewhat disagree. They have a chance to cash a ticket into the highly variant miniature baseball tournament. All of this depends on who the Cubs actually trade, of course, but the possibility should absolutely be explored."

CHICubs,39gdhr,north102,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:10:51 2015 UTC,I agree. I'm actually hoping we trade for Reddick to play LF for us.

Coughlan is playing well enough and Baez/Soler getting healthy will help. I'd be hesitant to make a move right now unless it's a low-cost no-brainer."
CHICubs,39gdhr,thejazzmarauder,3,Thu Jun 11 15:29:00 2015 UTC,"Papelbon, for me, is basically that move. The pen is our biggest weakness (and it's not THAT bad), but an elite arm is always nice to have. And Paps shouldn't cost much more than money, of which we should have plenty!"

CHICubs,39hm7d,nakolas,2,Fri Jun 12 00:04:49 2015 UTC,"I think they should move Vogelbach this year before the deadline. You would be selling high, although I believe he is on the DL right now. I think him and a PTBNL going to somewhere in the AL could land us a decent 3rd starter."

CHICubs,39hm7d,cubswinagain,14,Thu Jun 11 20:17:14 2015 UTC,I'd hold onto Torres.
CHICubs,39hm7d,voidecho,2,Thu Jun 11 20:21:28 2015 UTC,Me too.
CHICubs,39hm7d,thejazzmarauder,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:38:56 2015 UTC,"It's more likely that his value will fall off than that he'll make that jump and project as an above-average ML starter. His .419 BABIP is obviously unsustainable, and his combination of K% and SLG isn't good. He's a young 18 and has plenty of upside, but that's part of what makes him so valuable right now; if he goes to Myrtle Beach next season and puts up a .250/.320/.350 slash line, his value plummets. The risk isn't worth the upside of his power development IF the right deal comes along. All I'm saying is I'd trade him before Almora.   My preference to continue letting our top prospects develop through, at least, this season."
CHICubs,39hm7d,cubswinagain,3,Thu Jun 11 21:33:17 2015 UTC,The fact that he is farther away from the majors limits his value. Let him develop a bit so you don't end up underselling him.
CHICubs,39hm7d,thejazzmarauder,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:39:41 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with that, I'll just be watching closely to see if that K% drops."
CHICubs,39hm7d,nakolas,2,Thu Jun 11 21:47:50 2015 UTC,What about someone like Miguel Gonzalez? It's definately an upgrade over Wada and your giving up a player that will never make an impact at the Major League level. The only way he can make an impact is if something happens to Rizzo. Sorry Theo

CHICubs,39hm7d,jonsie19,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:13:10 2015 UTC,His bat is still good enough to justify a spot on a starting lineup - probably not at SS though. Being only 25 we can assume his bat is still going to be good enough for the forseeable future.

CHICubs,39fqyd,SpaceCampDropOut,6,Thu Jun 11 12:37:20 2015 UTC,They were featured pretty heavily on the Wednesday they played the mets.
CHICubs,39fqyd,MrJigglyBrown,5,Thu Jun 11 13:35:17 2015 UTC,They did one for Kris Bryant when he got called up. No video but they posted quite a few pictures. I posted it a while back. I'll see if I can find a link.   http://imgur.com/a/Nr79S
CHICubs,39fqyd,bryanno4444,3,Thu Jun 11 14:53:58 2015 UTC,"I think they just choose to feature a select few games. If you watch the first one the filter goes through all three games that were featured, so I guess it's a matter of choice by the staff."
CHICubs,39fqyd,JawjaFlrdaLine,5,Thu Jun 11 14:15:03 2015 UTC,"Side note: baseball clubs should really get into the Snapchat game.  Moreso than basketball and football, to me it lends itself as a sport where Snapchat would be great for with the unique parks, batting practice video, fans in the stands etc.    A few clubs have snapchats but even the ones I've seen like the WhiteSox have no idea how to use it as they should.  It's a rare like two snaps a week thing when a nightly collection of snaps from a ball club would be a great social media platform."
CHICubs,39fqyd,HeadBanzMakeHerDance,7,Thu Jun 11 15:33:03 2015 UTC,Because we're not one of the coast teams or a previous world series contender. MLB and ESPN and the like couldn't  care less about teams in the 'flyover' states.

CHICubs,39fqyd,Oprah-Is-My-Dad,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:24:59 2015 UTC,The Cubs have been featured very heavily on ESPN this year. With KB and Russell and Rizzo and Maddon they're a fun story for them to build up.

CHICubs,39fqyd,h1fr1ends,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:26:25 2015 UTC,I'll volunteer myself if the Cubs need someone to run a team SnapChat.
CHICubs,39fqyd,TheLostWeasley,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:10:52 2015 UTC,"I think it pretty obviously exists as a way for MLB to connect to a younger crowd. They probably pick the teams in the markets where they think it has the most growth potential with young folk. I'm not complaining, since I'm in my early 20's and don't want to see baseball in America die out in my lifetime"

CHICubs,39h4d1,95_Browns,3,Thu Jun 11 17:59:23 2015 UTC,So the deal previously with that was that if you have your stub they allow you to go from the bleachers so the grand stand with just a scan near the right foul pole underneath the actual bleachers themselves.......but since the new redesign I can not say for sure. I can tell you that I did watch a few Playoff games a few years ago under the scoreboard with the really cool beer guy at the top so ive got that going for me.

CHICubs,39h4d1,14P14C3,3,Thu Jun 11 19:41:30 2015 UTC,"I think you will be able to. I've had to do that prior to the construction to go grab a scorecard from the main concourse, and then go back to the bleachers because they don't sell them by the bleachers. You can always do an online chat with someone from the Cubs on their website and ask!"
CHICubs,39h4d1,14P14C3,2,Thu Jun 11 19:18:46 2015 UTC,"Pre-construction I used to do it all the time, so I know it was possible. I will have to try the online chat or just give them a call if that doesn't work. Thanks for the advice!"

CHICubs,39c9ja,Tjagra,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:28:41 2015 UTC,Pat just said the lead was too big for a save. What are the criteria for a Save?
CHICubs,39c9ja,homebrewtj,2,Thu Jun 11 02:28:26 2015 UTC,"He is the finishing pitcher in a game won by his team; He is not the winning pitcher; He is credited with at least ⅓ of an inning pitched; and He satisfies one of the following conditions:   He enters the game with a lead of no more than three runs and pitches for at least one inning  He enters the game, regardless of the count, with the potential tying run either on base, at bat or on deck  He pitches for at least three innings."
CHICubs,39c9ja,voidecho,3,Thu Jun 11 14:27:43 2015 UTC,3 runs or less in at least 1/3ip or 3ip to close the game if you didn't get the win.
CHICubs,39c9ja,ozcartwentytwo,2,Thu Jun 11 02:49:23 2015 UTC,3 run difference or less
CHICubs,39c9ja,Cohaagan,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:31:56 2015 UTC,I thought it was a little more complicated but I could be wrong.  Something like if the number of runners on base plus outs remaining is equal to or more than the run differential it can count as a save.
CHICubs,39c9ja,voidecho,2,Thu Jun 11 02:47:56 2015 UTC,"Correct, if the tying run is either in the batter's box or on-deck, then it is a save situation"

He played for the New York Yankees from 1939 to 1943.   In the 1941 World Series, Breuer came on as a reliever in the fifth inning of Game 4 to relieve Atley Donald, with the Yankees losing 4-3. Breuer pitched three scoreless innings, which enabled the Yankees to ultimately win the game on a passed ball by Mickey Owen  Breuer also pitched in the 1942 World Series, which the Yankees lost to the St. Louis Cardinals.  After Breuer's playing career ended, he spent 31 years working for the United States Geological Survey until his retirement in 1976. He was survived by his wife, Dorothy, two children, three grandchildren, and three great grandchildren.

CHICubs,39cs5y,snowcone_wars,7,Wed Jun 10 22:06:19 2015 UTC,"As I said yesterday, it's not overly comforting that the 31 year-old pitcher we just signed for 6 years / $55 million has a 4.25 ERA through 12 starts. That said, the peripherals aren’t that bad. His K/9 is still good, BABIP is unsustainably high given his career numbers and his HR/FB is double what it was last year, which is reflected by a solid xFIP of 3.10.   Lester will be fine short-term. My concern is what happens when his fastball dips a couple of mph (like his sinker and cutter already have)."
CHICubs,39cs5y,thejazzmarauder,2,Wed Jun 10 22:20:48 2015 UTC,and we have the money. not a problem at all. money wont be a problem for this roster until 2020
CHICubs,39cs5y,zrk23,4,Thu Jun 11 03:31:48 2015 UTC,"It is hard for me to believe that playoff performance is much more than noise. I believe there have actually been studies on this though I don't know any off the top of my head, though it makes sense; if players were able to flip a switch and suddenly pitch really well, why wouldn't they do it all the time?  Also, both bref and Fangraphs have the Cubs as at least an average defensive team, and Fangraphs actually say they are pretty excellent. If you're referring to their preponderance of errors, that's not going to show up on Lester's WHIP.   So while I understand where this post is coming from, and I also am tired of the he-loves-me he-loves-me-not Lester flipflopping, the real problem is that we're getting 2013-2014 Lester, not the Lester of last year. But I'm confident he can turn it around, and it's very very early."
CHICubs,39cs5y,gniketan,7,Wed Jun 10 22:30:21 2015 UTC,"mathematically, saying a player is clutch is stupid, I agree. But to deny the existence of it is, in my mind, ridiculous.   There are players who just simply are able to live in the moment when everything's riding on it, and play the best possible baseball. I think in any other situation, Curt Shilling can't go out with a bloody sock, just off the surgery table, and pitch lights out outside of a Game 6, do or die moment against the Yankees.  I think it takes a special kind of player to not only have the talent to do it, but also have the presence of mind to not let the biggest stage of all get to you it. It's something that I don't think you can quantify, but you can look at a player like that and realize that he's got it, and if the hopes of a city rely on that player, you can put the bat or ball in his hand, and trust that they're gonna bring it home for you.  Signing a player because of that is silly, but at the end of the day, if you do sign them, you'll be real glad that they're on your side."
CHICubs,39cs5y,Loop_Within_A_Loop,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:45:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Very small playoff sample size, especially in the world series with only 3 starts. Shouldn't be the justification for the huge contract. I do think they paid too much for him, but that's the way the free agent market goes nowadays for good, solid pitchers, which is what he is."

CHICubs,39cs5y,AbrahamLeanin,-2,Thu Jun 11 03:46:07 2015 UTC,"Lester had a career year and the FO bit on it hook line and sinker.  They were bound and determined to get him and they did so that they could say ""LOOK, WE'RE CONTENDING!!!!""  I really don't care what he does in the playoffs if he is going to blow 2-3 games over average over the course of a season and hurt us getting to the playoffs.  Also, I see his playoff ""awesomeness"" as one of the joys of baseball.  When you look at his K, BB and HR per 9 in the playoffs, they are all really similar to his career numbers.  He just got lucky and had fewer hits in general.  Then again, I hate signing free agents to more than 2 year deals so I may be biased here."

It's not ridiculous to think he might take some time to jump from being solid to being an ace.     And you need to calm down, people can have differing opinions."
CHICubs,39b9p8,ndfan737,8,Wed Jun 10 21:52:50 2015 UTC,"This is always the risk in giving big contracts to pitchers.

CHICubs,39b9p8,smackythefrog,2,Wed Jun 10 21:55:03 2015 UTC,At least Soriano was pretty badass for the first 2 years

CHICubs,39b9p8,greazysteak,3,Wed Jun 10 20:39:52 2015 UTC,Who was 2.0?
CHICubs,39b9p8,cgiall420,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:44:47 2015 UTC,"Maybe EJax the starter is 1.0 and the reliever is 2.0, therefore making Lester the 3.0?  Just taking a wild guess at the logic"
CHICubs,39b9p8,sususdio,-5,Wed Jun 10 23:47:18 2015 UTC,I think the salary makes it 3.0.
CHICubs,39cbt5,penguinopph,6,Wed Jun 10 20:24:09 2015 UTC,"We've been talking a lot about jerseys, especially from Aliexpress. These are the ones I have collected (I just got two of them today). I've been nothing but happy with everything about them. Price, shipping speed, look, comfort... All excellent. I got them from these sellers:  Rizzo throwback - $24.98  Bryant Cool Base - $23.00  Sandberg Throwback - $24.99  Maddux Throwback (same as Bryant jersey) - $24.18   All of them took less than 3 weeks to arrive (the Rizzo jersey only took 10 days!)."
CHICubs,39cbt5,SomeoneCutCarlsHair,2,Wed Jun 10 20:30:46 2015 UTC,Hell yes. I want that rizzo throwback!  Thanks for the link!
CHICubs,39cbt5,urbanfury,6,Wed Jun 10 23:32:11 2015 UTC,They certainly look better than my Bryant jersey! The Cubs logo is in the right font and your bear doesn't look like a deformed chipmunk. Nice grab!

CHICubs,39ef43,I_Sugest_Comic_Sans,3,Thu Jun 11 04:36:50 2015 UTC,I like this style of jersey. Simple with a throwback kind of feel. Also made a conscious decision to put the jersey number on the sleeve and leave the back empty.

CHICubs,39clqc,SomeoneSomethingJr,2,Wed Jun 10 21:25:22 2015 UTC,"The Cubs selected Alonzo Jones in the 36th round. He has been near the top of the ""best available"" list for a while now and is supposed to be one of the fastest guys in the draft. He's listed as a SS but it's very likely that he switches to CF. I'm excited we took a shot on him because he's so highly rated but also because he's from the same high school as me. All that said, he's probably not likely to sign if he lasted this long."
CHICubs,39clqc,asovermann,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:40:51 2015 UTC,Yeah all of Round 36 just popped up on MLB.com. I think they're updating it round-by-round instead of pick-by-pick. Nevermind. 2 picks of Round 37 updated.
CHICubs,39clqc,asovermann,2,Wed Jun 10 21:43:25 2015 UTC,"I like Twomey, he works out with CJ Wilson in the off-season which ironically is a guy he was compared to out of high school"
CHICubs,39clqc,asovermann,2,Wed Jun 10 23:17:31 2015 UTC,"It's too bad the Cubs are unlikely to sign Stadler, who reportedly already turned down 3rd round money. I suspect they took him as a way to keep in contact with him until he's draft eligible once again."
CHICubs,39clqc,THEriot2,2,Wed Jun 10 23:18:47 2015 UTC,Correction: It was Padgett who declined third round money

His Twitter already has been updated to ""RHP for the Chicago Cubs org"" so it seems he'll sign no matter what, but I can't find anything on him after he graduated high school in 2013.  Edit: Here's what Bleacher Nation has to say:   33rd Round (983): M.T. Minacci, School Not Listed. Minacci was drafted two years ago by the Rockies, and I’m not exactly sure where he’s been between then and now. Looks like he was a Florida State commit, but didn’t play? Not sure what’s up."
CHICubs,39clqc,asovermann,2,Thu Jun 11 18:42:02 2015 UTC,"/u/asovermann said below:    Minacci last attended Chipola College, but didn't play last season. Looks like he may have been hurt in 2013, he pitched for Chipola at least once."
CHICubs,39clqc,THEriot2,2,Thu Jun 11 18:50:07 2015 UTC,Hmm odd...he was a Florida State commit at one point.
CHICubs,39clqc,asovermann,2,Thu Jun 11 19:36:51 2015 UTC,From what I've dug up he only lasted a semester there before transferring.
CHICubs,39clqc,asovermann,2,Thu Jun 11 19:41:17 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. He was pretty highly regarded out of high school, I think."
CHICubs,39clqc,asovermann,2,Thu Jun 11 19:56:18 2015 UTC,"Last recorded scouting report of him in 2013:   ""MT Minacci is a 2013 RHP/SS with a 6-2 175 lb. frame from Tallahassee, FL who attends North Florida Christian HS. Long lean projectable build. Smooth balanced delivery, high 3/4's arm slot, throws downhill well, long loose arm action, ball comes out cleanly, low effort release. Fastball topped at 88 mph, have seen 90 mph frequently in the past, good late sinking life at times. High velocity 11/5 curveball with hard spin and sharp bite, will flatten out to more of a sweeping slurve at times, some feel for an upper 70's change up. Polished pitcher with good present stuff and some physical projection left. Has shown two-way prospect talent in the past but only pitched this event. Good student, signed with Florida State."""
CHICubs,39clqc,Cohaagan,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:11:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah you have to google him as Michael Thomas Minacci, or just Michael Minacci to find anything on him. He made a few appearances with that community college and that was it. I'm assuming he was hurt. He was committed as a SS/RHP at Florida State and played with Carson Sands in High School."

CHICubs,39c26r,Asmodeus10,3,Wed Jun 10 21:36:44 2015 UTC,"Looking at that lineup, we don't give our pitching staff enough props for keeping us in games, it's really solely their skill that has gotten us over 500.   We've only got 2, though sometimes up to 5, hitters that can make any sort of impact on the game really.  Anyone not playing corner infield with a two hit game is basically a miracle these days. Castro, fowler, and montero will have their games but not very often. Castro especially needs to wake up."
CHICubs,39c26r,TugboatThomas,5,Wed Jun 10 20:25:55 2015 UTC,Agreed. Castro has the 13th lowest OPS in the National League (heard it yesterday while watching the game). That combined with his adventures in the field is a fucking killer.
CHICubs,39c26r,imbrady,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:18:07 2015 UTC,He has the 12th or 13th best wOBA out there though...SS is a pathetic hitting position.

CHICubs,39dpxg,reddit-er,3,Thu Jun 11 01:52:50 2015 UTC,I would love to get him but I think he's going to be very pricey.  I hope he would take a little discount to be reunited with Maddon and realize to potential of this cubs team.  He could come just in time for this new clubhouse (if it is still going to be ready by opening day 2016).
CHICubs,39dpxg,0mousedog,6,Thu Jun 11 02:19:48 2015 UTC,"he's going to be very pricey   well of course, he's David Price"

I think at least for him the Cubs are a very attractive option because of Maddon and the obvious potential of the Cubs as possible contenders. I haven't heard much about the timetable for the new clubhouse, but the Wrigley renovations can only increase the attractiveness of the Cubs as a free agent destination."
CHICubs,39dpxg,Dhash23,3,Thu Jun 11 02:32:02 2015 UTC,"I think we definitely have a shot at him. I would love to get him, especially over Zimmermann. But Zimmermann would be a nice back up plan."

CHICubs,396anm,The_Commandant,4,Tue Jun 9 16:40:42 2015 UTC,Wood can double as a pinch hitter so there is that. Plus you never know about other injuries. Maybe Wood finds his way back into the rotation. Or maybe a trade gets made. It'll work out.

CHICubs,396anm,TheLostWeasley,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:35:28 2015 UTC,Like the pickup. Didn't really give up anything and he'll either stay in the minors or make the major league club better. Not much risk with some decent upside.
CHICubs,397eqs,ChiCubsbot,3,Tue Jun 9 20:10:25 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, I was wondering if anyone had full video of the 9th inning. Or knew how I could get it.  Len and JD talked about one of my tweets I sent them about a Detroit player.  I'd like to be able to show my friends.  I'd really appreciate any help!"
CHICubs,397eqs,SorryForgotMyName,2,Wed Jun 10 02:12:22 2015 UTC,Sorry for the late response. I think I found the clip. About 50 seconds into the video he starts talking about the tweet.
CHICubs,397eqs,Rbaner,2,Wed Jun 10 19:31:49 2015 UTC,Not a problem. And that is it. Thank you!
CHICubs,397eqs,SorryForgotMyName,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:43:07 2015 UTC,"Let's talk real here. We're 30-25 and our starting pitching has been mediocre besides a few highlights that I can remember, hitting has left us the past 25 games or so, our defense is subpar to say the least and our bullpen everyone already knows. With that said we are now 4 games above .500 and its seeming more and more like a fluke hot start. I'm usually a very optimistic cub fan and I know we got 3 vs the nats but we need a spark or something this is getting harder and harder to watch. Any ideas?"
CHICubs,397eqs,Nebarnes,2,Wed Jun 10 02:01:56 2015 UTC,"starters are 4th in the NL in ERA, thats pretty good. We added a bullpen arm and have ramirez coming back. We hopefully will add a starter and a hitter soon, which will also help. Remember we are very young, cold spells are bound to happen."

CHICubs,397eqs,Dunzyburr,4,Wed Jun 10 00:44:40 2015 UTC,All right Edwin.. Time to shine.

CHICubs,397eqs,AtlasStarwind,3,Wed Jun 10 00:45:14 2015 UTC,Lol
CHICubs,397eqs,manmythmofo,3,Wed Jun 10 00:43:18 2015 UTC,Woof. This looked like a good opportunity for a sweep based on the pitching match-ups. Let's hope for good Arrieta tomorrow.
CHICubs,397eqs,Bob2456,2,Wed Jun 10 00:42:28 2015 UTC,"Man, what has been up with Lester this year? Really disappointing."
CHICubs,397eqs,chicagocubs04,3,Wed Jun 10 00:42:14 2015 UTC,Alright let's get Lester out of here

CHICubs,397eqs,AtlasStarwind,-2,Wed Jun 10 00:41:32 2015 UTC,Lester pitching all balls. Looks really bad out there. You'd think an ace can strike out anyone instead of intentionally walking.
CHICubs,397eqs,MattForte2222,3,Wed Jun 10 00:39:00 2015 UTC,The Fuck is wrong with lester

CHICubs,397eqs,lincolnparknative,5,Wed Jun 10 00:37:35 2015 UTC,lol because every pitch Lester throws is right down the middle and he's getting hit hard.

CHICubs,397eqs,Terelith,2,Wed Jun 10 00:35:37 2015 UTC,That's Cespedes throwing from shallow.  He could have thrown out Usain Bolt from there.  it's a 0% chance Lake makes it in.

CHICubs,397eqs,Sparx7,3,Wed Jun 10 00:34:40 2015 UTC,My question is why isn't lake running on contact there. There was 2 outs and he hesitated
CHICubs,397eqs,theshaggysnack,2,Wed Jun 10 00:34:30 2015 UTC,"2 outs, had to send him. Just sucks it was hit to that guy."
CHICubs,397eqs,QBEagles,2,Wed Jun 10 00:31:36 2015 UTC,"You don't HAVE to do anything. Just because something is conventional wisdom and usually the right call doesn't make it always so. Context matters. It wasn't just to Cespedes, he also might as well have been playing short he was so shallow.  Lake had absolutely no shot. Fowler's batting .240; I promise Lake did not have a 24% chance of scoring there."

CHICubs,397eqs,Den1mChiken,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:29:54 2015 UTC,"The only reason not to send him should've been Cespedes. Everything else makes sense to send Lake. 2 outs, down 3, every manager sends the runner in that spot. Not with Cespedes throwing though..."

CHICubs,398ryj,ChiCubsbot,9,Wed Jun 10 02:02:20 2015 UTC,Hopefully we got all of our suckiness out at once. Lester's record is a little bit concerning

CHICubs,398ryj,somegaijin42,9,Wed Jun 10 03:18:22 2015 UTC,woah woah woah. Lester was a much better pitcher than Jackson before signing. Comparing them isn't fair right now.
CHICubs,398ryj,Tjagra,2,Wed Jun 10 06:01:37 2015 UTC,True but the overall comparison is fair.  Bring in talented (to whatever degree) pitcher and watch them flop.
CHICubs,398ryj,cheese-burger-walrus,3,Wed Jun 10 12:34:29 2015 UTC,Might be too soon to compare EJ and Lester.   Still concerned about Lester though.
CHICubs,398ryj,hourglasspilgrim,8,Wed Jun 10 07:17:16 2015 UTC,"The offense wasn't good enough tonight; Sanchez had one of his better nights but we also helped him a little too much.   More irritating is the way Lester has struggled in his last 3 starts. He was awesome in the 2nd tonight, had that good cutter working. And then is just slowly unraveled in the 4th and 5th. We need more from him.   Hopefully Arrieta brings his best stuff tomorrow, and we finish this long, tough road trip on a high note. Can't wait to see the boys back at Wrigley again soon  Edit: also seriously fuck Rajai Davis, let the old man have his HR trot. That felt like somebody robbed Jake Taylor. Shit ain't right"

CHICubs,398ryj,voidecho,2,Wed Jun 10 05:29:19 2015 UTC,Silver lining: this has been one of only a handful of games where we straight up got our asses kicked. Most of our games have been close wins or close losses. This is encouraging compared to last year. GO CUBS

Much larger than the opposite way - all pitchers basically suck at hitting and having a normal bat sit still allows him to act as a pinch hitter or other."

Also has the talent to play D1 basketball. When he was in a jam he would go to another level and get the out more times than not.

CHICubs,393hvr,HerbieVerstinks,2,Tue Jun 9 01:38:52 2015 UTC,"From Keith Law's chat yesterday:  Steve (Bethlehem, PA)  I can't help but be reminded of Chase Utley's profile coming out of UCLA when looking at Ian Happ (great bat, work-in-progress defensively). Not to mention they are both the rare high ranked college 2B prospect. Could Happ work himself into a plus defender or is he far less athletic than Utley was? Or am I just totally crazy?  Klaw  (4:09 PM)  I think there's a lot of merit to the profile comparison, although they're not identical players. Happ, like Utley, is a better athlete than people give him credit for being, and I think he'll be more than fine at 2b. His RH swing isn't good, so there's one open question - will it improve, or can you get him to hit LH full-time and still hit lefties - that Utley didn't have."
CHICubs,393hvr,HerbieVerstinks,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:11:21 2015 UTC,"Also from the Klaw chat:  Mike (Philly)  If Ian Happ had played SS in college (even if he was terrible there) and teams knew he'd have to eventually move to 2B/OF, would he be higher up? Seems like a guy who does everything really well, with no set position.  Klaw  (4:47 PM)  I firmly believe that if he hadn't needed double hernia surgery in February he'd be a top ten lock. Strong track record, really good LH swing, runs fine, can play on the dirt. We like those guys, right?"

CHICubs,393hvr,ilovelamp42,2,Tue Jun 9 02:03:57 2015 UTC,"Sort of comparable hit tool, Schwarber has more power but slightly higher K rate. However, being a catcher makes him immensely more valuable than Happ"
CHICubs,393hvr,zrk23,2,Tue Jun 9 02:14:12 2015 UTC,"IF he can play catcher... everybody thinks that he cant. but yeah, if he can that would be insanely awesome"
CHICubs,393hvr,thirdfounder,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:12:42 2015 UTC,I think the pick - as many people consider Happ to be a left fielder lacking tools that could put him elsewhere - is something of a vote of confidence in Schwarber at catcher. I know they say they think he can stick given the progress he made in instructional and the minors so far.

CHICubs,399026,euphoSZ,16,Wed Jun 10 03:05:36 2015 UTC,OBP of .325? Yeah he's fine. Next question.
CHICubs,399026,dsalmon1449,7,Wed Jun 10 03:42:19 2015 UTC,"19th among NL outfielders in OBP.  4th among NL outfielders in WAR.  8th among NL outfielders in SB.  9th among NL outfielders in pitchers per plate appearance.  12th among NL outfielders in total bases.  14th among NL outfielders in RC.  So, top half to the middle of the pack among OFs in the league.   That's about what he's been for his entire career...so I don't really know what you expected of him. And to say ""besides the end of the Nationals series he hasn't done much at all year"" is totally disingenuous."

CHICubs,399026,OliberQuip,3,Wed Jun 10 22:11:07 2015 UTC,Best leadoff hitter we've had since Lofton and he's statistically solid.  Phenomenal signing.
CHICubs,399026,object_on_my_desk,2,Wed Jun 10 12:38:02 2015 UTC,We got him via trade.  Just so you know :).
CHICubs,399026,NLRD,2,Wed Jun 10 19:43:34 2015 UTC,Whoops you're totally right.  Thought he was a FA for some reason.
CHICubs,399026,THEriot2,3,Wed Jun 10 21:49:21 2015 UTC,"My opinion on Fowler hasn't changed since the first day I saw him with the Rockies: he is a perfectly solid player.  I think he is a decent center fielder and a pretty good leadoff hitter.  He is not a great hitter, but he will see a lot of pitches and take his walks.  I'm pretty happy with him and I wouldn't mind the Cubs locking him up for 3 more years if the price is reasonable."
CHICubs,399026,dsalmon1449,2,Wed Jun 10 15:11:22 2015 UTC,"seems to rarely get on base, never works the count.   Are we watching the same game? 37th in the MLB in P/PA with 4.01.The OBP is a bit lower than expected, but his BABIP is 44 points lower than his career average.  I don't know what you were expecting...or what you're looking at."

CHICubs,399026,JPScan3,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:04:55 2015 UTC,Hot and cold for sure.  He is 3rd in the NL in runs though which is pretty good considering the Cubs are 12th out of 15 in runs scored in the NL.
CHICubs,399026,0mousedog,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:27:36 2015 UTC,"Is he perfect? No. But he gets on base 1/3 of the time, has had some surprisingly clutch home runs and RBIs, and seems to be a good clubhouse guy. I think he was a great pickup while we get a younger guy through the system to replace him long term."
CHICubs,399026,NLRD,-2,Wed Jun 10 12:23:48 2015 UTC,He frustrates me. He will look good for a couple games then the next few he looks like a totally different hitter and does shit. Cubs need a legit obp lead off hitter especially with Rizzo and Bryant behind them. I saw the the Cubs are 17-7 when fowler gets at least 2 hits in a game. Imagine if they had a guy that got on base more then him.
CHICubs,399026,THEriot2,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:09:24 2015 UTC,"The Cubs are 9th in the majors in leadoff hitter OBP, even with Fowler being 30 points below his career OBP.  Who do you propose they go get?"
CHICubs,399026,NLRD,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:35:38 2015 UTC,"Fowler has, perhaps, been the best leadoff hitter in the game the past 5 years. Maybe I'll Play Index that later.  The other guy that comes to mind is Brett Gardner."
CHICubs,399026,THEriot2,2,Wed Jun 10 17:20:39 2015 UTC,"You got me interested, so I did it for you.  Minimum 1,000 PA batting leadoff since 2011, Fowler ranks 3rd in OBP behind Choo and Carpenter.  He is 5th in OPS, 5th in wOBA, and 9th in wRC+.  Others in the same neighborhood are Ellsbury, Gardner, Altuve, and Kinsler.  So yeah, no matter how you look at it, Fowler has to be considered one of the better leadoff hitters around."
CHICubs,395o7j,aves01,5,Tue Jun 9 12:58:07 2015 UTC,ISO is Slugging - Batting Average. It's basically a stat that shows tendency for extra base hits vs singles.
CHICubs,395o7j,pinrow,2,Tue Jun 9 13:09:08 2015 UTC,Ahh. Thank you.
CHICubs,395o7j,SwedishLovePump,4,Tue Jun 9 16:44:15 2015 UTC,Short breakdown:   Batting average is the expected number of hits you get per at-bat.   Slugging Percentage is the expected number of bases you get per at-bat.   Isolated Slugging (SLG-BA) is the expected number of extra bases beyond a single per at bat.
CHICubs,395o7j,Asmodeus10,3,Tue Jun 9 13:31:45 2015 UTC,"Other people have explained how it's calculated, but nobody has said yet how it's used. Here's an extreme example.   Compare Lucas Duda to Robinson Cano. It's pretty obvious that these are two different types of players, but ISO can tell you that without having to look at HR, 2B, SLG, etc. Duda's .228 ISO tells you he's a power hitter while Cano's .139 ISO tells you he's more of a singles and doubles hitter.  The reason I chose these two is because they both ended the year with wRC+ of 136 despite their different approaches. Duda having a higher ISO doesn't mean he's a better player, it just means he hits for more power.   Or compare A-Rod to Ryan Howard. They both have .260 ISOs which tells you they're both big power hitters, but A-Rod is the better overall hitter because of his higher average, better walk rate, lower K%, etc."
CHICubs,395o7j,Asmodeus10,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:01:01 2015 UTC,"Ok. Thank you for the explanation, but I have one more question. I saw, in the draft thread, that people were drooling over themselves about Happ's ISO. Understanding that a home run, though less common (and somewhat less valuable, in terms of getting runners on base) can lead to more runs (dependent on whether or not there were runners on before the home run), how is a player with a high ISO more/less valuable relative to a power hitter?    TL;DR How do I know if a player with more home runs or with a higher ISO is more valuable?"
CHICubs,395o7j,cheese-burger-walrus,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:26:05 2015 UTC,"You'll probably need to incorporate other statistics. There is a very strong correlation between ISO and HR, so just comparing those two stats won't be very helpful in determining overall value. You would also be comparing a rate state to a counting stat which means you'll have to factor in total plate appearances.  Look at this leaderboard sorted by ISO. You'll notice right away that the number of HR climbs pretty steadily with ISO. Cruz led the majors with 40 HR last year but is only 7th in ISO. That's partly because most of the guys ahead of him had fewer plate appearances, so it's not a fair comparison.  So let's compare two guys with similar plate appearances, say McCutchen and Justin Upton. Upton had a few more HR, but McCutchen had a higher ISO. So who was better? You can't really say just by comparing HR and ISO. You have to look at OBP and SLG where it becomes obvious that McCutchen was clearly better.   TL;DR Don't use ISO (or HR) to determine how good a player is. There are far better stats for that. Use ISO to determine what type of player he is."
CHICubs,392yoq,thejazzmarauder,5,Mon Jun 8 21:46:01 2015 UTC,"Eloy's swing is so mesmerizing.   How about Gleyber Torres with .311/.387/.383 as an 18 year old in A ball?

While he's been effective, he hasn't been quite as dominant as hoped. At the outset, Kellogg looked more like a guy who would pitch in the low 90s with a power breaking ball. He's morphed a bit into more of a pitchability lefty, albeit one with three at least average offerings. His fastball sits more in the 90-91 range with some solid life when he keeps it down in the zone. He can spin a decent breaking ball and he mixes in a changeup that will be at least Major League average as well. Kellogg doesn't hurt himself with walks, but also doesn't miss a ton of bats, pitching to contact. Even if Kellogg didn't develop into the pitcher scouts thought he would be, he still profiles as a starter who really knows how to pitch, a value especially as Day 2 of the Draft unfolds."""

CHICubs,3937z9,Govea,4,Tue Jun 9 09:01:20 2015 UTC,MLB needs to watch the NFL draft. They just don't get how to do this.
CHICubs,3937z9,designgoddess,3,Tue Jun 9 00:52:59 2015 UTC,Looks very amature-ish
CHICubs,3937z9,Sparx7,2,Tue Jun 9 01:20:58 2015 UTC,Surprisingly. Looks like they got cheap.
CHICubs,3937z9,designgoddess,3,Tue Jun 9 01:44:56 2015 UTC,I can't blame them most people give 0 fucks about the MLB draft because you're going to have to wait at least a couple of years to see most of them play in the majors.
CHICubs,3937z9,designgoddess,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:51:31 2015 UTC,"That is certainly a problem the NFL draft doesn't have, but if they're going to make a show of it, they need to do it right. Or at least better."
CHICubs,3937z9,halfbeak,2,Tue Jun 9 14:43:24 2015 UTC,True. I don't know how they fix it though.
CHICubs,3937z9,uhhhhmmmm,4,Tue Jun 9 01:16:34 2015 UTC,What are the guys sitting there at the tables doing? Have the players representing the teams announce the selections. No one cares about the commissioner. Why not have more live cameras in the draft rooms? Make a bigger deal of the players who are there. Have more cameras in players homes. Have an audience. Each team gets to send 10 super fans to the draft. Have the announcers disagree a little bit. Get someone other than the local high school theater troop to put together the set.   Something more than this.   Edit: The place livened up when everyone cheered for the guy who was there.
CHICubs,3937z9,AtlasStarwind,4,Tue Jun 9 01:44:35 2015 UTC,I stopped watching the instant Ian Happ was announced.  It was just excruciating.
CHICubs,3937z9,retrofade,2,Tue Jun 9 01:14:01 2015 UTC,Glad we went to the IHapp with this pick.
CHICubs,3937z9,supercubbiefan,2,Tue Jun 9 00:33:25 2015 UTC,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CGXpxXcUcAAr7b_.jpg
CHICubs,3937z9,Pseudonova,6,Tue Jun 9 00:27:59 2015 UTC,Easily one of the best pure hitters in this draft... I like the pick.
CHICubs,3937z9,Jgb2,13,Tue Jun 9 00:18:13 2015 UTC,"Looking at Happ's stats, he has a great OBP, slugging, ISO (this year). Favorite stat about him, though? Throughout his three seasons he has as many BB as K's. Can't wait to see how he progresses!"
CHICubs,3937z9,fightintxag13,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:12:36 2015 UTC,"Happ sounds like a potential superutility, OF depth kind of player. Hopefully his power keeps trending upward through the minors. Given that he was such a good hitter on such a bad team makes me think his bat may be a little underrated since he probably saw nothing good to hit. Intriguing, but ultimately unsurprising pick. I think he'll be a good value."
CHICubs,3937z9,AtlasStarwind,6,Tue Jun 9 00:11:06 2015 UTC,"Happ sounds like a potential superutility   Why, because he can play multiple positions? What makes you think he can't/won't be a starter?"
CHICubs,3937z9,Tjagra,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:15:47 2015 UTC,I think he means in the Anthony Rendon mold. You can move him anywhere so that way you can get your best possible bats in the lineup.
CHICubs,3937z9,inevitablescape,2,Tue Jun 9 01:24:39 2015 UTC,"If John Baker and David Ross can pitch, Ian Happ can too!"

CHICubs,3937z9,Tjagra,3,Tue Jun 9 00:09:37 2015 UTC,i'm excited to see how this kid plays
CHICubs,3937z9,AtlasStarwind,2,Tue Jun 9 00:08:20 2015 UTC,What's his natural position in OF? Sorry I'm at work and can't research.
CHICubs,3937z9,tbv93,2,Tue Jun 9 00:07:25 2015 UTC,Looks like more of an OF than IF though.
CHICubs,3937z9,big-mo,4,Tue Jun 9 00:09:16 2015 UTC,"He can play 2B, CF, and RF"
CHICubs,3937z9,cooter410,3,Tue Jun 9 00:07:43 2015 UTC,Well he can play LF too then

CHICubs,3937z9,NeverSummerMountains,8,Tue Jun 9 00:03:49 2015 UTC,Anyone surprised we went position over pitching? It seems we're sticking with the mentality that pitching can be had easier than quality position players.
CHICubs,3937z9,zrk23,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:03:48 2015 UTC,There were no pitchers left worth taking at the 9th pick
CHICubs,3937z9,theshaggysnack,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:10:46 2015 UTC,i am. thought theo would select some starter or at least a relief pitcher. Guess we will sign someone in the off season for that
CHICubs,3937z9,jcftw61,0,Tue Jun 9 00:08:28 2015 UTC,thank god. i dont want to wait a pitcher develop in the minors. we need someone who can win NOW.

CHICubs,392vcp,Sephiroth007,3,Mon Jun 8 22:33:33 2015 UTC,"Hoping it's either a competitive balance pick or Papelbon (total asshole, but proven closer) or Ejax traded away finally :)  Right now I think there's a 10% chance of something actually happening though. With the draft about to start MLB will not want any big trades going down drawing attention away from the draft."
CHICubs,392vcp,Gimmie_Dat_Stream,2,Mon Jun 8 22:39:24 2015 UTC,"Because we want to steal the show like we did in the WS with Maddon, The Winter Meetings with Lester and now the Draft with ???"

I suppose they MIGHT have a tenative deal in place provided Baez can recover, but yeah, if the Phillies are honestly willing to negotiate a trade where Baez is the centerpiece and hurt, and Baez is getting fair value from them, take that fucking trade and get Hamels in Cubs hat and on the next plane to Chicago."

CHICubs,392vcp,kingofnumber2,2,Tue Jun 9 12:59:19 2015 UTC,"I feel like trades are inevitable with all the hitting talent still in the minors and the lack of quality pitching. A year from now there's no way one out of Castro, Russell, Baez, and Bryant is riding the bench or in Iowa. I also doubt Schwarber's going to have a backup catcher role so if we put him in left what'll happen with Coghlan? Moves are definitely coming I just don't know what they are."

CHICubs,393vmg,RustyDarkstar76,19,Tue Jun 9 02:11:40 2015 UTC,Maddon will probably do something weird like put Castro at DH so Russell can play more short or some shit.
CHICubs,393vmg,jcftw61,8,Tue Jun 9 02:12:27 2015 UTC,I think OP and /u/jcftw61  are on he right path.  I don't expect them to make any roster moves with Javy getting injured.  Denorfia at DH seems like the most logical scenario.  Watch Joe through Travis Wood up there now.
CHICubs,393vmg,TooLebowski,11,Tue Jun 9 02:17:02 2015 UTC,I say we have Jon Lester DH because we really need him to break out of his slump at the plate. I mean we are paying him 165 million
CHICubs,393vmg,Oprah-Is-My-Dad,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:56:05 2015 UTC,I'd almost have Lester out there for the lolz and bench Ross for the DH.
CHICubs,393vmg,elliottstanger,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:02:59 2015 UTC,Can't do that.  You can only DH for the pitcher.

CHICubs,393vmg,cheese-burger-walrus,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:47:14 2015 UTC,I think the problem then would be who do you start at 1B if you had Rizzo at DH? Herrera?
CHICubs,393vmg,callthebluff,2,Tue Jun 9 16:36:56 2015 UTC,"I really have no clue who the back up 1B is...  Herrera seems a legit guess.  Looking at BR: Cogs has 2 innings there in the majors. Baxter has 1. Herrera has 1.1.    Screw it, put in Wood."
CHICubs,393vmg,octobadger,2,Tue Jun 9 18:57:01 2015 UTC,"When is Olt coming back? I was hoping he'd be back by now to DH, but I know he is now just swinging in the cage.  Denorfia should be in LF and Lake in RF with Coghlan or someone who plays crap defense at DH.  Hopefully, they don't call up Baxter and put him there."
CHICubs,393vmg,Tjagra,2,Tue Jun 9 02:39:29 2015 UTC,Olt still hasn't played in games yet I think. So at least a few more weeks I would assume.
CHICubs,393vmg,Cpt_Hook,2,Tue Jun 9 03:12:03 2015 UTC,"I definitely like putting Cogs at the DH, let him focus on hitting and see what he can do."

CHICubs,39135g,StressedOut_Student,6,Mon Jun 8 14:01:38 2015 UTC,"I'm going to share something I posted on /r/Cubs a while ago...   [RUMOR] Brady Aiken may have serious interest in becoming a Cub  Hey everyone. I don't mean to come off as one of the twitter kids who thinks they're breaking important news, but I'm pretty sure I actually got some cool information this morning. Today I met another kid in a college workshop and we hit it off. We started talking about baseball. He commented on my Cubs hat and then informed me that he not only knows Brady Aiken, but is in fact a friend of his. He proved it to me by showing me multiple photos of them together. The reason he told me this is because according to Aiken he ""really wants to sign with either the Cubs or the Padres"" if MLB decides to grant him Free Agency like he wants. Just thought I'd share what I heard today with you all! How nice would it be to have that guy in our system? It may not be true, but he seemed pretty genuine about it.   Since then I've spoken with his friend again and confirmed everything he previously said. Aiken wants to be a Cub and the Padres don't pick until 51. The reports are out that the Aiken family have shared their medicals with the Cubs, something they wouldn't do unless they knew they had nothing to hide.  The Cubs strategy is not to pick a hitter in the first round. It is to select the best overall player. Aiken, when healthy, is just that. He can be the ace of our future. He was number one on the Cubs board last year, even in front of Bryant. By him sharing his medicals along with the interest he's shown in Chicago, I would not be surprised if a soft deal is already in place.   I'll say it here, unless the Cubs are higher on Andrew Benintendi or DJ Stewart than every single scout who has published their reports on them, the first round selection for the Chicago Cubs will be Brady Aiken. I will be happy.  EDIT: The Cubs will draft Brady Aiken with the ninth overall pick."

CHICubs,39135g,THEriot2,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:25:39 2015 UTC,"There's really no basis for that assumption, in that Jed/Theo have been in ""turn the aircraft carrier around"" rebuild mode since coming to the team. Now that it's been turned around, you can't go by the last 4 years. But looking at the Red Sox tenure they're clearly not against spending money. With a solid core of hitters locked up very cost-efficiently for the next 4-5+ years, a 6-7 year deal for Price or Zimm doesn't seem ridiculous."
CHICubs,39135g,Meazles,2,Mon Jun 8 16:47:47 2015 UTC,Can someone ELI5 a protected pick? Thanks
CHICubs,39135g,THEriot2,6,Mon Jun 8 15:22:54 2015 UTC,"Top 10 picks are protected from free agent compensation. If you sign a free agent requiring draft pick compensation, you have to forfeit one of your picks to the team losing the player. You give up your 1st round pick unless it is protected. If you signed 2 of these free agents, you give up your first and second round pick.  Free agents require compensation if they are offered a ""qualifying offer"" by their team at the end of the season and decline it. The qualifying offer is a one year deal, and the amount of the deal determined every year by averaging the top 125 player salaries from the year prior.  Example: Let's say Lester was never traded to the A's last year (players traded during the season prior to their free agency do not require draft pick compensation). At the end of 2014, the Red Sox extend a qualifying offer to Lester, 1 year $15.3 million. Lester declines this offer because he believes he can get more money ont he open market. This is usually the case, all 12 players offered QO last year declined. Lester signs with the Cubs like he actually did. The Cubs owe the Red Sox draft pick compensation. However, because the first 10 picks in the draft are protected, the Cubs get to keep their #9 overall pick, and they give the Red Sox their next pick (round 2, 47 overall)."
CHICubs,39135g,Illinijuice07,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:49:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks! That makes a lot of sense. But lets say you do sign two FAs who received QOs. Who gets the first round pick, and who gets the second round pick? How is that determined?"
CHICubs,39135g,Gimmie_Dat_Stream,2,Tue Jun 9 15:29:06 2015 UTC,"I'm 95% sure the team with the worst record the previous year gets the higher pick. I think there may be a clause which causes the pick to be unprotected after 2 or 3 signings as well. That is to say, you can't keep infinitely signing free agents that require compensation and still keep your first."
CHICubs,39135g,YourCummyBear,5,Tue Jun 9 15:45:27 2015 UTC,Teams with picks in the Top 10 have protected picks meaning that they cannot lose their picks due to signing high class free agents.  Outside of the top 10 if you sign a good free agent you lose your pick
CHICubs,39135g,designgoddess,9,Mon Jun 8 15:45:41 2015 UTC,"From John Manuella's latest Mock Draft at BA:  ""9. Cubs  Every year, we write about the Cubs needing pitching. Every year, we should figure out that teams run by Theo Epstein take a hitter with their first pick. The Cubs have taken a hitter with their first pick of Epstein’s three drafts and 10 out of 12 first picks between his time with the Red Sox and Cubs. Benintendi would be the bonanza here, but he’s not going to last this long. Chicago has thrived with college position picks with strong performance track records, so Happ is the best bet on the board.  Selection: Ian Happ, of/2b, Cincinnati""  Think the bolded part is really interesting."
CHICubs,39135g,SoloDolo86,4,Mon Jun 8 15:35:32 2015 UTC,Happ can hit but the issue is he has no position.  And his k rate was 19% this year. That's pretty scary for a college bat who doesn't have a lot of power.

CHICubs,39135g,Gimmie_Dat_Stream,5,Mon Jun 8 14:12:48 2015 UTC,Cubs will draft Aiken.

CHICubs,39135g,1908_Cubs,7,Mon Jun 8 17:43:13 2015 UTC,"I would highly doubt they'd take Aiken.  His medicals after his surgery are not great.  And why take a damaged product?  I don't mind the injury-rehab route that we took last year on HS arms later in the first-10 rounds, but not at the top of the draft.  It's the one pick you can count on to maybe become something.  Why add even more risk to that by taking an injured player?"
CHICubs,39135g,thejazzmarauder,2,Mon Jun 8 17:43:56 2015 UTC,His medicals after his surgery are not great.   That's speculation based on the fact that the Aiken family is limiting access to his medicals.
CHICubs,39135g,SwankDR,3,Mon Jun 8 18:37:58 2015 UTC,"And if he already knows were he wants to go and has a soft commitment, that would make some sense. The Cubs reportedly have a close relationship with the Aiken family..."

CHICubs,39135g,SoonerJDB,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:04:42 2015 UTC,"That's fine if they're overblown.  He's still had TJS.  With the likelihood the Cubs don't even have a first round selection next year, I'd still rather not draft a known injured quantity with my top selection this season.  Even on a weak draft."
CHICubs,39135g,zoom258sy,2,Mon Jun 8 20:49:53 2015 UTC,"If they love someone w/o the injury concerns, then great, but this is seen as a weak draft and pitchers in general have a higher risk of injury anyway; I wouldn't be surprised if the ""unique opportunities"" Cubs management keeps speaking of refers directly to Aiken being available at #9. We'll know soon."

Also biased because he's a local kid and goes to UIUC.  Buehler I'd be cool with - nice high floor.  Also his fellow Vandy pitcher Fullmer.  Daz Cameron would be nice though a lot of that depends on how the FO sees Almora working out/being a part of a trade package.  Also hesitant to overslot which is apparently what he's looking for.  Also I still really like Allard.  So much refinement in a guy so young, IDGAF that he had an injury - it's not like it was a rotator cuff or TJ  However, I know whoever the Cubs draft, I'll think it's stupid and that Theo and Jed have lost their minds.

CHICubs,39135g,SwedishLovePump,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:31:16 2015 UTC,We need some starting pitchers and OF depth
CHICubs,39135g,CondorAvenue,9,Mon Jun 8 16:58:20 2015 UTC,"What we need is irrelevant because our needs change yearly.  This draft pick won't really make any major impact for years, likely.  Take the best player and move on, because while we may need that now, in 2-3 years, we may need something else."
CHICubs,39135g,inevitablescape,2,Mon Jun 8 17:42:29 2015 UTC,"See, the caveat here is that word on the street is that the Cubs are looking at College pitchers like Jay who could potentially jump into the bullpen this season, similar to what the Royals did with Brandon Finnegan last year."
CHICubs,39135g,1908_Cubs,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:53:13 2015 UTC,"They very well may be looking at them, but nothing the Cubs have done over the course of the Epstein reign screams ""live for now!"".  Especially with Black and Edwards steps away from the majors.    They may pick Jay.  But it'll be based on him being the best options available, less then them wanting to fill an immediate need, imo.  That fits more in with the way they've handled things."
CHICubs,39135g,SwedishLovePump,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:48:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, but part of what would make him the best option available would be his ability to fill an immediate need. The two things aren't mutually exclusive. They're very much related.   nothing the Cubs have done over the course of the Epstein reign screams ""live for now!""   The trades for Montero/Fowler and signing of Lester point that way. The Cubs are absolutely making moves towards competing in the short-term."

I wouldn't be shocked in the least to see that kid need a swing overhaul.    He's getting comped in terms of swing to Ted Williams.  Granted, Williams was an all time great, but his mechanics are pretty outdated.  I can't remember the last time a player got comped mechanically to a player 80+ years removed from the game.  That's a bad sign, not a good one, in my book."
CHICubs,39135g,CrimeAlley,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:56:01 2015 UTC,"I found this interview with Baseball Prospectus' Chris Crawford interesting.  He highlights Nick Plummer (OF, Brother Rice HS, Mich.)   the guy can hit, and only Ian Happ (OF/INF, Cincinnati) has a higher potential hit tool to me. He likely goes in the bottom of Round 1, but I'd take him in the top 15, maybe even the top 10.   We could see Theo take a guy with a great hit tool higher than he's projected to sign him underslot and load up on prep pitchers later. Plummer would seem to fit that ""Schwarber"" pick the best."
CHICubs,39135g,Gimmie_Dat_Stream,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:53:54 2015 UTC,I think Jay would be a fantastic pick at 9 if he's there. I could see him being called up to the big leagues if the Cubs need help in the bullpen later in the year.

He got 158 at-bats in, hit for a better average than he has since he was in Single-A and got his strikeout rate down below his 2013 AA, 2014 AAA, and definitely below 2014 MLB numbers.  Keep in mind we promoted Baez from AAA when he was hitting .260/.323/.510 with a strikeout rate of 30%. This year in AAA he was hitting .314/.386/.536 with a strikeout rate of 25%.   It looks like he was able to make the adjustments that we wanted him to make.

CHICubs,38ymrt,JCardCubs,2,Sun Jun 7 23:31:23 2015 UTC,"I think the fact that you have to say Harper DIDN'T hit a home run speaks to how good he is. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if he ended up better than Trout."

CHICubs,38xac1,zdruck07,2,Sun Jun 7 23:04:06 2015 UTC,Castro made up for the E imo.  Wouldn't have minded seeing Russel at SS again.  Feel bad for the guy with the target on his back constantly.  So conflicted!
CHICubs,38xac1,Joakley3000,-3,Sun Jun 7 23:03:37 2015 UTC,how do you feel bad for a guy that earns 5 million dollars per year?
CHICubs,38xac1,zrk23,3,Sun Jun 7 23:06:31 2015 UTC,Empathy lol.
CHICubs,38xac1,Joakley3000,2,Sun Jun 7 23:07:25 2015 UTC,Couldn't have gone a game without a weak grounder to short

CHICubs,38xac1,bgreene777,2,Sun Jun 7 22:58:22 2015 UTC,Good outing for Rondon. If he did that while he was closing he would still be the closer.
CHICubs,38xac1,cubswinagain,2,Sun Jun 7 22:58:18 2015 UTC,Big 9th inning so KB can get his cycle.

CHICubs,38xac1,theshaggysnack,3,Sun Jun 7 22:05:45 2015 UTC,I don't mind the aggression.  Force them to make a perfect throw.
CHICubs,38xac1,Joakley3000,2,Sun Jun 7 22:05:43 2015 UTC,their pitcher was lost. at least they would bring another one. plus norf is hot.
CHICubs,38xac1,zrk23,3,Sun Jun 7 22:08:40 2015 UTC,"Being aggressive got us our second run. Sometimes it pays off, sometimes not but I'd still rather see them give it a shot."
CHICubs,38xac1,nab95,2,Sun Jun 7 22:08:31 2015 UTC,norf is way faster than Montero and that ball was at RF... different situations
CHICubs,38xac1,zrk23,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:10:02 2015 UTC,Yeah no doubt but I still like to see them be aggressive.
CHICubs,38xac1,nab95,3,Sun Jun 7 22:11:11 2015 UTC,Exactly. Probably more likely Montero scores there than Denofrio gets a hit.
CHICubs,38xac1,LtDarien,2,Sun Jun 7 22:07:57 2015 UTC,"Denorfia is 2/3 today...I think with 2 outs, I hold Miggy at 3rd and see if Denorfia stays hot today to score again, at the least, it makes the pitcher have to be careful with breaking stuff to not throw it away and give Miggy a chance to score on the wild pitch/passed ball.  It's a gamble either way, oh well."
CHICubs,38xac1,Terelith,3,Sun Jun 7 22:13:08 2015 UTC,"Great hit by Starlin, great throw by Taylor to get Montero"
CHICubs,38xac1,2Close_4Missiles,6,Sun Jun 7 22:04:51 2015 UTC,"That Rizzo/Bryant combo really puts the pressure on the opposing pitcher. When the rest of the team comes through behind them, this team is tough to beat."
CHICubs,38xac1,LarryHolmes,2,Sun Jun 7 22:04:39 2015 UTC,I think we got a little greedy there. Pitcher was under pressure and the next batter has been hot

CHICubs,38vpcm,lincolnparknative,4,Sun Jun 7 07:18:48 2015 UTC,He's been tinkering with a leg kick and no leg kick.
CHICubs,38vpcm,north102,3,Sun Jun 7 07:57:13 2015 UTC,Sick
CHICubs,38vpcm,MattForte2222,4,Sun Jun 7 06:26:05 2015 UTC,"Is it just me or did that swing look a lot better? No leg kick, looked much smoother, but still retained almost all of his ridiculous bat speed."
CHICubs,38vpcm,maxelrod,6,Sun Jun 7 14:07:00 2015 UTC,"There was most certainly a leg kick.  And it looked worse than Tuesday.  Tuesday was where I'd like to see his swing.    Is it better then the extremely exaggerated swing from last season?  Maybe.  It's gone from extremely exaggerated to exaggerated.  I'd rather not see it unless it's a 2-0 or 3-0 count, however.  The Tuesday swing was where I'd like to see him stick."
CHICubs,38vpcm,1908_Cubs,2,Sun Jun 7 15:10:12 2015 UTC,"He has calmed his motion  terrifically, though, from six months ago. Positively quiet in comparison.  Not sure it can bring his K rate under 30% but if he can be a 240/290/480 second baseman he'd be valuable."
CHICubs,38vpcm,thirdfounder,2,Sun Jun 7 16:22:45 2015 UTC,"He would be valuable if he could get there.  But I think with a quieter swing, he could be more.  There's a .275/.320/.500+ 2b/3b with above average defense in there in peak seasons.  He makes such hard contact that keeping a high BABIP shouldn't be an issue for him.  And with a quieter swing and a contact rate at or above 70%, he can maximize his value.  .275 maybe too high for a consistent Baez, but I have no doubt with a quieter swing we could see a huge overhaul in his K% numbers."
CHICubs,38vpcm,1908_Cubs,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:29:37 2015 UTC,"Just watched it again and you're right, there was a leg kick. It wasn't as aggressive as it used to be though. I didn't see the tuesday swing, do you know where I could find a link?"
CHICubs,38vpcm,maxelrod,4,Sun Jun 7 15:55:08 2015 UTC,"http://www.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20150603&content_id=128267264&vkey=news_milb&fext=.jsp&sid=milb  And I also broke down the swing on CubsRelated, a blog a handful of us started to look at advanced metrics up and down throughout the system.  Check that out, too!  #Shameless"
CHICubs,38vpcm,1908_Cubs,2,Sun Jun 7 16:27:22 2015 UTC,Yeah that swing is really where I would like to see Baez long term. Just more quiet and less violent. I seriously worry he is going to have long term ankle problems if he continues with his all out swing where his entire body weight seems to pivot off of it.
CHICubs,38vpcm,maxelrod,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:26:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks, and I'll go check out CubsRelated"
CHICubs,38vpcm,rocknallknight,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:42:54 2015 UTC,I believe the no leg kick swing comes out when he shortens up for a 2 strike count. This swing was a 0-1 count.
CHICubs,38vpcm,Terelith,2,Sun Jun 7 16:46:38 2015 UTC,"Which if true, I am okay with.  Rizzo does the same thing, not so much the leg kick, but he definitely will break his lower half down more to try and pulverize a pitch with less than 2 strikes.    Scary part is, Baez has shown he can still hit the ball 400+ feet even with the 2 strike, no kick approach."
CHICubs,38vpcm,rocknallknight,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:49:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he certainly doesn't need it. And eliminating that leg kick and his bat speed means his pitch recognition skills can lack and he can still get to pitches he likes even if he decides a little late."
CHICubs,38vpcm,zrk23,2,Mon Jun 8 03:36:19 2015 UTC,i want that swing in slow-mo
CHICubs,38vpcm,Doogolas33,2,Sun Jun 7 09:05:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was something. Don't know if I've ever literally seen light tower power."
CHICubs,38vpcm,thirdfounder,2,Sun Jun 7 13:37:21 2015 UTC,"Looks like something out of the late 1990s, doesn't it? There was a time for a few years there where batting practice was really impressive.   In 1998 I went to see the Cardinals up in Milwaukee. McGwire taking BP was ridiculous - literally clearing the old light towers in County Stadium, which were massive. It was around that time that Sammy was hitting balls four houses down Kenmore and Glenallen Hill launching balls onto rooftops."
CHICubs,38vpcm,enjoytheshow,2,Sun Jun 7 16:19:15 2015 UTC,"I grew up seeing Sosa smash balls onto the far side of the street/off the rooftop buildings that I thought it was normal until about 2004/05.   Aside from Bryant's smash that hit the scoreboard, I can't remember the last time I saw an absolute no doubter onto Waveland/Sheffield."
CHICubs,38vpcm,thirdfounder,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:58:35 2015 UTC,"It's really amazing what a difference the PEDs  were making in the game. They're still there, too, though on a different level - that really puts into perspective how widespread the abuse was. Teams were signing 34 year old guys to 5 year free agent contracts and actually expecting that to pay off. I think that was an even more egregious outcome than the long ball frenzy.   I loved pinball baseball, but this is a better quality of game we see now, one in which pitchers can make mistakes again."

According to MLB, http://m.mlb.com/prospects/2015/#list=chc  the following prospects will be playing.    No. 8 Prospect Jen-Ho Tseng is starting ('13 Int. signing)  No. 12 Prospect Jeimer Cadelario plays 3rd. ('10 Int. signing)  No. 15 Prospect Mark Zagunis plays OF ('14 3rd Rd pick)  No. 16 Prospect Victor Carantini plays C ('13 2nd Rd pick of Atlanta)  No. 29 Prospect Daniel Lockhart plays 2nd ('10 11th Rd pick)  I didn't list out all of the pitchers since Tseng is starting.

CHICubs,38vf2g,pm_me_ur_pajamas,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:09:05 2015 UTC,I think they should just quadruple down with offense and go with the best outfielder left in the draft. In a couple years then our line up top to bottom would just be ludicrous.
CHICubs,38vf2g,BpFal3,2,Sun Jun 7 05:07:40 2015 UTC,"I've heard plenty of hype about the OF from Arkansas, but it sounds like Boston will take him at #8.   I'll be disappointed with anyone but a pitcher at this point."
CHICubs,38vf2g,0mousedog,5,Sun Jun 7 05:13:56 2015 UTC,"In theo we trust, for me i will be fine with who ever we pick. Last year's strategy of under slotting #1 pick, then drafting high school pitchers with the extra money seemed to workout. But if he thinks the best player left is a pitcher, then go for it."

None of these inspires ""beast"" as a moniker to define Benintendi.    I like Benintendi.  For this draft.  Other seasons and he's not a top-10 pick.  He's had a good SEC season, no doubt, but the power will drop considerably and he's not an amazing specimen with that much room to add bulk/grow.    If we draft him 9th?  I'm happy.  Honestly, he's one of my 2-4 favorite picks right now with the 9th.  But it's a product of this draft more than it is a deep love with Benintendi."

I certainly hope the Cubs do not take Aiken at this point.  If he was healthy?  Sure.  But he's not.  And taking an already damaged product isn't a good idea, imo, with the 9th.  Go get a healthy product now and take your injury recoups later in the draft."
CHICubs,38vf2g,Mattcub23917,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:13:59 2015 UTC,Me too. I remember when Rich Hill pitched for us as a starter with that big curve. It probably all depends on what the Cubs think of his medical reports.

CHICubs,38ucpf,bobisterbezreal,7,Sat Jun 6 22:12:08 2015 UTC,"Oh, didn't see someone already posted this. I was going to myself, but then I got directed to this thread.   Awesome sub! Ensuring there's no duplicates anywhere.   Anyway, I'm kinda glad to see Taylor Davis learning the outfield. The way he's swinging the bat, he might be a handy right-handed bat off the bench."
CHICubs,38ucpf,RoughRiders9,0,Sat Jun 6 22:41:12 2015 UTC,"This might sound weird but are you as big a fan of the Iowa Cubs as most people are of major league teams?   Like, do you know the other teams in the AAA and their players?"
CHICubs,38ucpf,canflow123,5,Sun Jun 7 02:52:43 2015 UTC,"@TommyBirch:   2015-06-06 21:19:00 UTC  Davis walks out of the locker room with a bunch of baseballs. ""Time to learn a new position boys!"" Taking fly balls in the OF now. #Cubs     [Mistake?] [Suggestion] [FAQ] [Code] [Issues]"
CHICubs,38ucpf,TweetPoster,6,Sat Jun 6 22:13:07 2015 UTC,I wouldn't read quite that much into this move. Rafael Lopez and Taylor Teagarden have started most of the games at catcher and Davis has played more at 1B.
CHICubs,38ucpf,SomeoneSomethingJr,2,Sat Jun 6 22:40:12 2015 UTC,"I agree. But the way he has been hitting so far this year, he's just doing too good to not keep him out of the lineup."

CHICubs,38tp8j,Jollyman21,22,Sat Jun 6 19:01:21 2015 UTC,Rizzo has been a beast lately. Len said he's carrying our offense and he's totally right - but Herrera and others did their part today too. :)
CHICubs,38tp8j,Ganesha811,18,Sat Jun 6 19:01:38 2015 UTC,WEAREGOOD! #walkBryceHarpereveryatbat
CHICubs,38tp8j,fender-b-bender,15,Sat Jun 6 19:02:12 2015 UTC,Biggest steal of the off season so far is Hammel. Dude just turns it up another level in a Cubs uniform.
CHICubs,38tp8j,jocman96,7,Sat Jun 6 19:09:17 2015 UTC,It makes me think it's gotta be the pitching coach with him and The Pres pereforming the way they are. Hopefully he can stay here for a long time.
CHICubs,38tp8j,Loop_Within_A_Loop,13,Sat Jun 6 19:21:08 2015 UTC,"Pulling Rondon was a much better decision than pulling Hammel.  Harper is a freak of nature and has been on absolute fire. I can't say I'm all that surprised he hit a homer. Hammel was still looking good and still had a low pitch count. Also we were still up by 2 with no one on. If he let another guy get a hit then I say pull him, but we saw in the 8th how was Hammel can handle pressure. He earned a complete game and was lights-out all day.  On the other hand Rondon has been shaky at best for a while now. They let him see 1 batter and he walked him with no outs in the bottom of the 9th. That just can't happen. After a pitching like that Joe had no choice to pull him and although Strop did a good job closing out the game I still think I would have rather seen a fatigued Hammel out there."
CHICubs,38tp8j,slasky,16,Sat Jun 6 19:06:18 2015 UTC,"As an M's fan this whole ""pulling your closer when he's putting guys on base"" thing baffles me. I thought closers were supposed to give up runs, not prevent them."

CHICubs,38tp8j,SomeoneCutCarlsHair,2,Sat Jun 6 19:39:53 2015 UTC,And he's going to lead in stolen bases soon!

CHICubs,38tp8j,slasky,4,Sat Jun 6 19:08:10 2015 UTC,You'll be seeing it again. Rizzo just has to hit some more homeruns :)

CHICubs,38tp8j,TheFakeTimShady,8,Sat Jun 6 19:17:23 2015 UTC,"This team just continues to quietly win despite playing a tough schedule, having a pretty crappy bullpen and very little help outside the every day 8 hitters (but Johnny Herrera with two rockets today!) Add Baez and Norf to the bench here pretty soon, hopefully Soriano and another arm either to the rotation or the pen before the deadline, take a look at the schedule, it really softens up after the ASB. Just hanging tough right now. #wearegood"
CHICubs,38tp8j,zrk23,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:17:47 2015 UTC,we need help within the 8 everyday hitters actually. besides Rizzo everyone is on a slump. tho Fowler is picking up the slack lately. just hoping that all of the buzz about us hitting for the fences when the weather heats up will be true!

CHICubs,38tp8j,SwedishLovePump,5,Sat Jun 6 19:12:47 2015 UTC,Rizzo doesn't cool off. He just decides to lull opponents into thinking he's cooled off.   Edit- just noticed the autocorrect abomination.

I expected to find some on the Cubs site but all the videos seem to be highlights or manager press conferences only. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place?
CHICubs,38tp8j,Tjagra,2,Sat Jun 6 23:33:36 2015 UTC,"the sports section on chicago tribune .com usually has some player interviews, but they are pretty short usually. Every once an while ivy envy has an interview with a minor leaguer."

CHICubs,38sj4r,Ganesha811,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:00:52 2015 UTC,"No it's just a change in his pitching routine, usually he takes a deep breath and settles then winds up for the pitch but every 3rd or 4th pitch usually he takes a shorter breath and goes right into his throw so the batter sometimes isn't ready for it and is too late on the swing"

CHICubs,38sj4r,nakolas,3,Sat Jun 6 18:51:54 2015 UTC,I was just about to say the same thing. Gotta snag his ass.
CHICubs,38sj4r,JCardCubs,3,Sat Jun 6 18:52:55 2015 UTC,Rondon is a bag of asses. Realistically this should be Motte but let's hope Pedro does the job.

CHICubs,38sj4r,imbrady,2,Sat Jun 6 18:54:35 2015 UTC,"Worst argument ever. Besides, avg. against Strop is way lower."
CHICubs,38sj4r,Cpt_Hook,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:56:17 2015 UTC,ERA?
CHICubs,38sj4r,imbrady,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:01:08 2015 UTC,Inflated because of a couple bad outings. ERA is not very good stat to look at for relief pitchers because they pitch so few innings.
CHICubs,38sj4r,Cpt_Hook,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:04:59 2015 UTC,"you could say the same for rondon though. Strop and rondon are both garbage, but did you see Strop pitch today? couldnt throw anything but the slider and he hung that half the time."
CHICubs,38sj4r,imbrady,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:11:13 2015 UTC,"Strop is effectively wild because his stuff is filthy. Rondon can't pitch like that, his stuff isn't good enough. That's why Rondon walked a guy, but strop struck out two on balls out of the zone."
CHICubs,38sj4r,Cpt_Hook,3,Sat Jun 6 19:55:30 2015 UTC,Maddon basically saying he's lost confidence in Rondon. We really need Ramirez back and another arm in the bullpen......
CHICubs,38sj4r,Aladdin16,8,Sat Jun 6 18:51:07 2015 UTC,"i dont know, but i think i would use motte or Grimm as closer. Rondon is too marmolish"
CHICubs,38sj4r,zrk23,2,Sat Jun 6 18:50:56 2015 UTC,I could get on board with the Grimm Reaper.
CHICubs,38sj4r,Cpt_Hook,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:52:59 2015 UTC,Best adjective ever.

CHICubs,38sj4r,slasky,2,Sat Jun 6 18:52:28 2015 UTC,i just hate how he always walks people. always.

CHICubs,38sj4r,chicagocubs04,5,Sat Jun 6 18:50:33 2015 UTC,"Well, we officially don't have a closer anymore. Taking him out here sends a pretty strong message."

CHICubs,38sj4r,Jollyman21,3,Sat Jun 6 18:51:45 2015 UTC,"Really Rondon, you walk him?"
CHICubs,38sj4r,AtlasStarwind,3,Sat Jun 6 18:49:53 2015 UTC,Rondon just got pulled! Good job Maddon.
CHICubs,38sj4r,herptydurr,3,Sat Jun 6 18:50:45 2015 UTC,To be fair it was a great at-bat.
CHICubs,38sj4r,t-pat,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:50:25 2015 UTC,couldnt catch the game. how was addy today at SS?
CHICubs,38sj4r,zrk23,3,Sat Jun 6 18:48:15 2015 UTC,Not many opportunities.
CHICubs,38sj4r,cubswinagain,5,Sat Jun 6 18:48:57 2015 UTC,I don't think giving up a HR to Harper is a reason to take Hammel out.
CHICubs,38sj4r,lincolnparknative,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:47:56 2015 UTC,Agreed.  Keep him in.
CHICubs,38sj4r,zdruck07,3,Sat Jun 6 18:50:42 2015 UTC,"I agree, I wish they kept him in. He's been pitching a hell of a game."
CHICubs,38sj4r,TheBostonPops,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:48:52 2015 UTC,He was at 100 pitches
CHICubs,38sj4r,AtlasStarwind,4,Sat Jun 6 18:48:50 2015 UTC,"So, pitchers go over 100 all the time."
CHICubs,38sj4r,slasky,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:49:51 2015 UTC,I agree. Shouldn't be a legit excuse. These guys can handle it.
CHICubs,38sj4r,big-mo,3,Sat Jun 6 18:50:55 2015 UTC,"Jesus Rondon...  Come on man, keep it cool."
CHICubs,38sj4r,zdruck07,2,Sat Jun 6 18:47:41 2015 UTC,This Harper kid is pretty good. Anyone got a scouting report on him? /s
CHICubs,38sj4r,Aladdin16,3,Sat Jun 6 18:46:59 2015 UTC,nice effort by Matt Szczur climbing the wall... you can tell that dude really wants to stay in the big leagues.

CHICubs,38sj4r,Cpt_Hook,3,Sat Jun 6 18:46:11 2015 UTC,Harper homers. It's a fact of life. No worries here. Take it home Rondon.
CHICubs,38sj4r,JPScan3,2,Sat Jun 6 18:45:20 2015 UTC,Yep. Solo home runs are not worrisome.
CHICubs,38sj4r,LtDarien,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:46:13 2015 UTC,Rondom: Always protect your lead.
CHICubs,38sj4r,TheFakeTimShady,3,Sat Jun 6 18:45:04 2015 UTC,"Still, 8 innings, 2 runs, 2 walks - great outing by Hammel."
CHICubs,38sj4r,Ganesha811,2,Sat Jun 6 18:44:51 2015 UTC,I really hope Rondon has it today.
CHICubs,38sj4r,cubswinagain,2,Sat Jun 6 18:44:46 2015 UTC,Rondon vs. Rendon... battle of the vowels!
CHICubs,38sj4r,AtlasStarwind,2,Sat Jun 6 18:45:03 2015 UTC,Jesus Christ. Bryce Harper is on a different level. When are pitchers going to stop pitching to him?
CHICubs,38sj4r,sober_virgin,3,Sat Jun 6 18:44:23 2015 UTC,uh oh...glad we got that insurance run
CHICubs,38sj4r,chicagocubs04,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:44:14 2015 UTC,There's just almost nothing you can do with him.
CHICubs,38sj4r,REDDIT_GOLD_SANTA,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:43:50 2015 UTC,Literally the most predictable home run of all time.

CHICubs,38sj4r,slasky,2,Sat Jun 6 18:37:30 2015 UTC,Not a big fan of Junior Lake. Should I be?
CHICubs,38sj4r,JPScan3,2,Sat Jun 6 18:33:42 2015 UTC,"Eh, he's mostly a placeholder."
CHICubs,38sj4r,Cpt_Hook,2,Sat Jun 6 18:34:35 2015 UTC,"The nonsense in Miami and he's been bad/cocky in DC. I just don't see it. He's obviously fast, but I wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something obvious."
CHICubs,38sj4r,JPScan3,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:36:49 2015 UTC,"I don't get the feeling that he has an attitude problem since we haven't seen it come up until this week. It looks more like an isolated incident instigated by the Marlins. He's a AAAA player with the potential to be something more, but nothing to get too excited about."
CHICubs,38sj4r,SomeoneSomethingJr,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:47:06 2015 UTC,"Nah, he shows flashes, but he's never had consistency. Sometimes he's fun, but don't feel obligated to like him, he won't be around much after this season."
CHICubs,38sj4r,Cpt_Hook,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:40:42 2015 UTC,He's ok i guess. I just can't stand to watch some of his lazy play in the field.

CHICubs,38sj4r,AtlasStarwind,4,Sat Jun 6 18:31:27 2015 UTC,Rocking a full Blackhawks sweater on the hottest day in DC all week. Witnessing true beauty from Hammel. Great to see Dex/Rizzo/KB doing some damage today! GO CUBS
CHICubs,38sj4r,JPScan3,2,Sat Jun 6 18:29:13 2015 UTC,"Just like everybody predicted, a pitcher the Cubs signed this offseason will be heading to the All Star Game."
CHICubs,38sj4r,TheFakeTimShady,4,Sat Jun 6 18:28:34 2015 UTC,HAMMEL!  Outstanding performance today. Great job stranding that runner after the leadoff double.
CHICubs,38sj4r,cubswinagain,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:27:29 2015 UTC,Since 2012 Hammel has this statline vs Nats.  Of 8 teams he has pitched 20+ innings vs. those are by far his best stats.  5-0 W/L 2.67 ERA and 36/5 K/BB  RIPNATS  Kryptonite
CHICubs,38sj4r,airbudgoldenrec,3,Sat Jun 6 18:38:00 2015 UTC,Beautiful strikeout. Sadly I don't think Joe is gonna let him finish out the ninth.
CHICubs,38sj4r,Ganesha811,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:27:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I doubt he'll pitch a complete game."
CHICubs,38sj4r,Fac183,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:31:19 2015 UTC,"I think he might, he's at 98 pitches and ,unlike most of our pitchers, he can actually hit decently."
CHICubs,38sj4r,slasky,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:30:21 2015 UTC,I'm guessing they'd let him throw about a dozen more pitches.
CHICubs,38sj4r,Fac183,3,Sat Jun 6 18:42:55 2015 UTC,K
CHICubs,38sj4r,chicagocubs04,6,Sat Jun 6 18:26:51 2015 UTC,HAMMEL GOIN' HAM.
CHICubs,38sj4r,zdruck07,5,Sat Jun 6 18:26:39 2015 UTC,Cool as a fucking cucumber.
CHICubs,38sj4r,t-pat,5,Sat Jun 6 18:26:38 2015 UTC,"Hammel is on fire, let him finish the game."
CHICubs,38sj4r,slasky,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:26:36 2015 UTC,I think Joe will let him pitch now that Harper isn't the tying run.
CHICubs,38sj4r,nakolas,4,Sat Jun 6 18:27:43 2015 UTC,YEAH HAMMEL!!!!!  COMPLETE GAME HERE WE COME!!!!!
CHICubs,38sj4r,AtlasStarwind,4,Sat Jun 6 18:26:24 2015 UTC,Oh thank god for the quick two after the double.

CHICubs,38sj4r,TheFakeTimShady,3,Sat Jun 6 18:20:41 2015 UTC,Oh that slider.  Ooooooooooh.
CHICubs,38sj4r,zdruck07,3,Sat Jun 6 18:12:40 2015 UTC,Great outing for Hammel today. Lets tack on some more runs now pls.
CHICubs,38sj4r,cubswinagain,2,Sat Jun 6 18:12:13 2015 UTC,Hammel kickin' ass and takin' names!
CHICubs,38sj4r,AtlasStarwind,5,Sat Jun 6 18:11:48 2015 UTC,81 pitches?!  STAY IN FOR THE WHOLE GAME!
CHICubs,38sj4r,zdruck07,2,Sat Jun 6 18:09:25 2015 UTC,Two quick outs! Hammel could use a nice quick inning.
CHICubs,38sj4r,Ganesha811,2,Sat Jun 6 18:08:33 2015 UTC,Great catch by Coghlan!
CHICubs,38sj4r,AtlasStarwind,3,Sat Jun 6 18:07:46 2015 UTC,"This game is going by slower than it seems. It feels like a fast game, but it's been two hours already."

CHICubs,38sj4r,NotreDameFootball,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:56:56 2015 UTC,Calm down man. The only times I've ever complained about away announcers were today and yesterday. I think you have me confused with someone else. I wanted the CSN broadcast not only to get away from the nats announcers but to hear Len and JD.  I'll always search for home streams before asking.
CHICubs,38sj4r,NotreDameFootball,5,Sat Jun 6 23:30:09 2015 UTC,"Wow, 8 straight appearances of 6 innings with 5 hits or fewer for Hammel. Now THAT is impressive."

CHICubs,38spg6,Cubs_Stream,19,Sat Jun 6 14:37:05 2015 UTC,I cannot imagine anyone is too excited about Jonathan Herrera playing.

CHICubs,38spg6,SenseiCAY,2,Sun Jun 7 05:53:59 2015 UTC,Especially playing at Wrigley. Now we need a 2B/SS named Clark.

I fell asleep during the meditation portion of the class and everyone laughed at me. Moral of the story: probably stick to hard liquor during your lunch break today. Good luck. Oh, BTW, they will probably show you a video of what looks like a woman pooping out a baby (I know that SOUNDS impossible, but I saw what I saw)."

CHICubs,38spg6,0mousedog,6,Sat Jun 6 18:55:10 2015 UTC,Castro really needed an off day.
CHICubs,38spg6,JohnnyWaffleseed,3,Sat Jun 6 15:46:06 2015 UTC,This is strange if Castro isn't hurting -- Castro has played six days in a row but had 2 of 3 off just before that with a rainout and off day. Castro also seems to be freshly out of a slump.  This front office keeps me on my toes.
CHICubs,38spg6,penguinopph,2,Sat Jun 6 14:47:04 2015 UTC,"Having an off day with  a game happening is different though. It allows him to get a look at the game from a different perspective, and focus on the game as it's being played, as opposed to doing nothing in the hotel."

This year I really haven't been able to do that, and have had to post them later (even later for CST and EST people since I'm on PST).

CHICubs,38vb77,Tjagra,1 point,Sun Jun 7 06:09:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think that sort of thing would work if it's not too much of an inconvenience for you (maybe have a reddit bot do it?). In the OP, there could be links to gameday and streaming (legal, of course) streams and whatnot. And when all of the games finish, you can just edit the OP and do what you normally do with the stats.   I have no idea how reddit bots work, but I think that is something that could work."

Basically, the trailing runner is attempting to gain the attention of the throw and waste just enough time to score the run from 3rd.  I believe both instances were with 2 strikes.  It's like a last ditch effort to score a run when you're concerned about the guy at the plate delivering a hit.  Maddon likes to use these things.  Hell, he used the hidden ball trick in a game in 2013.  Anything to score a run."

Sorry if this is rambling. The plan-my-day-around-games excitement has totally gone away for me in the last two weeks and it's the bullpen. Tonight is a perfect example, I have no confidence in coming back from a three run deficit because I know it won't stop at three. Even the games this team wins are heart attack inducing because they don't have anybody that can sew up a game (the should have lost again last night because of it and the only reason we're not burning Rondon at the stake is because Ross saved his inevitable blown save.) You can stomach being shut down by a stud pitcher or out slugged but constantly puking games away that you were winning or repeatedly giving runs back, making a comeback more difficult is just the worst way to lose. At this point it's one of the most likely way a Cubs game will end at this point. Just discouraging."

CHICubs,38p0jr,chilango2,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:47:12 2015 UTC,That just raises even more questions!  I just saw it for the first time on my way home yesterday. Can not figure out the thought process.

CHICubs,38p0jr,IDCimSTRONGERtnUinRL,3,Fri Jun 5 19:18:18 2015 UTC,Perhaps it was a spouse's compromise

CHICubs,38p0jr,DavidBenAkiva,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:22:01 2015 UTC,My guess is it's a Cubs/Sox marriage. The Cub fan (obviously) was the one who could afford the Lexus so it's their car but they wanted to placate their Sox fan spouse just a little bit.  Note: Gender neutral pronouns are key here.

CHICubs,38ppa4,voidecho,1 point,Sat Jun 6 02:17:23 2015 UTC,Not sure really. Alcantara maybe? He was shit to start the year but has a higher ceiling. Szczur is basically just Sam Fuld

CHICubs,38ppa4,NeverSummerMountains,5,Sat Jun 6 01:18:55 2015 UTC,are these Nats announcers really comparing Harper to Barry Bonds?

CHICubs,38ppa4,Jgb2,3,Sat Jun 6 01:20:00 2015 UTC,Lol at that Len Screech jab.
CHICubs,38ppa4,cubswinagain,3,Sat Jun 6 01:16:26 2015 UTC,judging by their voice i thought these nats annoucers were a lot younger
CHICubs,38ppa4,zrk23,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:16:24 2015 UTC,I have to travel to the Baltimore area for work a lot and always end up watching these guys if the Cubs aren't on. The color guy in particular sounds like he'd be about 23.
CHICubs,38ppa4,PaletoBayPlayboy,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:24:28 2015 UTC,my thoughts exactly. i would bet 30 max.

CHICubs,38ppa4,iam2eeyore,6,Sat Jun 6 01:13:45 2015 UTC,looking forward to see him. and i bet he can make more plays at 3rd instead of KB
CHICubs,38ppa4,zrk23,3,Sat Jun 6 01:14:46 2015 UTC,Yeah you would think so. Some would argue that he is the best shortstop in the Cubs system.
CHICubs,38ppa4,Tjagra,0,Sat Jun 6 01:19:28 2015 UTC,He's never been highly thought of at ss. He was Castro at best with the glove.

CHICubs,38ppa4,zrk23,3,Sat Jun 6 01:29:46 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, how many more plays do you think Baez would hypothetically make than Bryant over the course of a season, if they somehow faced the same defensive opportunities?  I agree, I just don't think it would be that much more."
CHICubs,38ppa4,Jgb2,3,Sat Jun 6 01:18:30 2015 UTC,"I would say their arms are probably about the same, perhaps even Bryant with the advantage. But Baez has better range, hands, and accuracy."
CHICubs,38ppa4,Tjagra,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:22:41 2015 UTC,"i was talking about the range specifically. is harder for Bryant to dive and get those down the line hits. i think Baez can, like rendon did"

CHICubs,38ppa4,JOYOUS_BANANA_WARRIO,3,Sat Jun 6 01:10:25 2015 UTC,"I wanna see him in different spots in the order, just to see if he ""clicks"" anywhere. It could be mostly mental, but having different players ahead+behind him will mean he sees slightly different pitches in different spots.   Could just be wishful thinking on my part though.   My dream is to see him switch to 3B, and bulk up a bit to get into around mid-twenties hr territory."
CHICubs,38ppa4,Jgb2,2,Sat Jun 6 01:12:51 2015 UTC,Ya I don't think it's his place in the order.

CHICubs,38ppa4,inevitablescape,4,Sat Jun 6 01:09:13 2015 UTC,Szczur of course. but i would rather have wood than Ross lol

CHICubs,38ppa4,zrk23,3,Sat Jun 6 01:14:00 2015 UTC,Don't you talk bad about our national treasure Ross
CHICubs,38ppa4,fender-b-bender,5,Sat Jun 6 01:11:11 2015 UTC,Woods is untouchable tonite.  That curve to end last inning was his best pitch since his all star game.

CHICubs,38ppa4,zrk23,2,Sat Jun 6 00:57:56 2015 UTC,The offense has ridiculous potential. I never really feel like they can't come back. It's a scary feeling
CHICubs,38ppa4,Sparx7,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:00:46 2015 UTC,that i agree. everybody knows about the potential. doesnt change the fact that we r bad for almost a month
CHICubs,38ppa4,zrk23,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:05:40 2015 UTC,We played .500 ball
CHICubs,38ppa4,Sparx7,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:22:04 2015 UTC,cause the pitching saved us. im talking about the offense since that pirates series
CHICubs,38ppa4,zrk23,2,Sat Jun 6 01:30:51 2015 UTC,Fair weather fans get upset when the team struggles for any stretch of time.
CHICubs,38ppa4,Cpt_Hook,2,Sat Jun 6 00:57:39 2015 UTC,This team is supposed to struggle. We were spoiled to start the season.
CHICubs,38ppa4,Sparx7,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:01:25 2015 UTC,"Yup. I won't be worried until we're at least several games below .500, and it'll probably take more than that."

CHICubs,38pgn8,t-pat,6,Fri Jun 5 19:14:09 2015 UTC,Am I the minority when I say I really want to see him at shortstop? Starlin is projected to have the worst fielding year of his career and is probably the 2nd or 3rd worst fielding SS in the NL. I feel like I see a lot of grounders go past Castro that he kind of halfheartedly lunges at.
CHICubs,38pgn8,JinsUnited,16,Fri Jun 5 19:41:41 2015 UTC,I think Russell will be there to start next season.
CHICubs,38pgn8,THEriot2,3,Fri Jun 5 19:52:30 2015 UTC,Extrapolation =\= projection. It ain't pretty either way.
CHICubs,38pgn8,JohnnyWaffleseed,2,Fri Jun 5 21:19:41 2015 UTC,"With only 38 games at second, Russell is leading the league in UZR/150.   Well, the amount of games doesn't matter as UZR/150 is a rate stat. And it's not really helpful in this kind of sample, but I love watching Russell play some D."
CHICubs,38pgn8,THEriot2,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:53:31 2015 UTC,"Obviously it's a very SSS, but he passes the eye test and I'd imagine at the end of the year his numbers will still look good."

CHICubs,38psb0,TweetPoster,2,Fri Jun 5 20:27:34 2015 UTC,"Is there any way he can be a productive member of the Cubs?   He seems to be raking this year, which is great to see, but it's kind of bittersweet, knowing that there's almost no chance he'd be in Chicago longer than a year or two tops. And even then, it would probably be mostly to showcase him at the major league level, not necessarily to fill a specific hole the team would have at that time."
CHICubs,38psb0,Jgb2,9,Fri Jun 5 20:44:20 2015 UTC,"Unless the DH comes to the NL, almost certainly not."
CHICubs,38psb0,Doogolas33,4,Fri Jun 5 21:21:00 2015 UTC,"For all his hitting ability, Vogelbach only has 20 HR over his last 800 plate appearances.  That'll have to change even if he just wants to play DH.  It's weird thinking that he may not even be a 20 HR guy in a full season...that won't fly."
CHICubs,38psb0,stackshot,2,Sat Jun 6 02:49:03 2015 UTC,I unfortunately don't see him being on our big league roster much if any....but hopefully he keeps raking and we can use him to get something we need.
CHICubs,38psb0,ilovelamp42,2,Fri Jun 5 20:55:30 2015 UTC,"Rizzo would pretty much have to play left for him to start, but he could get 150 ABs as a PH"

CHICubs,38p0rr,HelloControl_,5,Fri Jun 5 17:31:57 2015 UTC,"I think Rizzo hit it right on the head with that last sentence.  This team has had a lot of God or goat moments, and we as fans only tend to remember the times it comes up goat.  In two weeks time, people are gonna go back to bitching about ""Why is Ross coming up to bat now?  He's awful.  Why is he still on the team?  Lester shouldn't have a personal catcher..."""
CHICubs,38p0rr,gamenut89,4,Fri Jun 5 17:52:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Ross gets A LOT of unfair hate when he is probably the ""headiest"" guy on the field at any given time. I look forward to his coaching career because he will be phenomenal."
CHICubs,38p0rr,PaletoBayPlayboy,-4,Fri Jun 5 18:08:02 2015 UTC,"He gets hate because he can't hit, plus he's old and slow so his long-term value is lower than a guy like Wellington.   He needs to do things like this and keep Lester solid to make up for the team giving away a younger chip."
CHICubs,38p0rr,pm_me_ur_pajamas,7,Fri Jun 5 20:43:51 2015 UTC,Do you think I don't know why you hate him? Honestly?   You are the personification of /u/gamenuts89 's comment...
CHICubs,38p0rr,PaletoBayPlayboy,0,Fri Jun 5 20:50:07 2015 UTC,"he's still bad. and this was the first game of the season where he played great defensively, though still sucked offensively and will for the rest of his life. not worthy of a spot but hey, gotta make Lester happy..."
CHICubs,38p0rr,zrk23,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:35:56 2015 UTC,"Does great pitch calling and pitch framing not count as great defense? He's one of the best defensive catchers in the league, to say that this was his first great defensive game of the year overlooks all the little things he does every time he plays."
CHICubs,38p0rr,tristalll,3,Sat Jun 6 16:06:54 2015 UTC,"Watched the vid, I heard ""whine, whine, whine, replay"". Is it a flawed system? Sure it is. Was it flawed prior to replay? Sure it was. There is no point in complaining about calls. There is going to always (hopefully) be a human component to umpiring. With that comes the potential for mistakes and missed calls. It's as old as the game. Next week it will be us on the other end of it. Baseball mirrors life. Sometimes the breaks go your way, others they don't but, you pick yourself up and deal instead of whining."
CHICubs,38p0rr,PaletoBayPlayboy,2,Fri Jun 5 18:07:23 2015 UTC,"I didn't hear a lot of whining, just commenting that the system has holes in it and suggestions on what they can do to fix it."

Why not just a neutral color polo or even something of the home team's color that just isn't an actual Nationals shirt? Seems like you'd blend in a lot better that way and be able to just enjoy the game. At least at Wrigley, I've seen fans wearing random jersey get razzed more than visiting fans. Just always seemed strange to me."

Just to show I am fan of the game and this is my team. I probably wouldnt wear my DW jersey normally there but since he is going through a rough time I figured I would sport it. I would still wear my Mets hat regardless because that's my hat. I don't figure I need to change my normal attire. I have gotten razzed but also I get a lot of ""Let's go Mets"" from random people.   I understand the thought to blend in but it's just a game and if people want to super serious about it thats fine. I got some zingers loaded. I'm a Mets fan so I am sure you can imagine.

CHICubs,38orgl,SomeoneCutCarlsHair,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:33:22 2015 UTC,Fox is destined for Ny with that name.   But yes. That would be insane.
CHICubs,38orgl,thejazzmarauder,5,Sat Jun 6 00:05:05 2015 UTC,"Gonna be tough to outbid the Dodgers for Martinez and Fox, as they might end up spending > $80 million in the J2 signing period after tax. It'd be incredible to land both, though."
CHICubs,38orgl,Sparx7,2,Fri Jun 5 17:20:29 2015 UTC,The question is....if the Dodgers can't land 2 do they stay under the limit and blow their load the year after? Probably not but it would be interesting.
CHICubs,38orgl,thejazzmarauder,2,Fri Jun 5 17:50:06 2015 UTC,They're already committed to going way over their bonus pool; they have deals in place with a large number of players.  Yadier Alvarez alone will reportedly sign for $16 million.
CHICubs,38orgl,Sparx7,2,Fri Jun 5 18:02:58 2015 UTC,yeah apparently we have a ton of deals in place too ugh dodgers need to stop spending money so we can have everyone
CHICubs,38orgl,thejazzmarauder,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:17:36 2015 UTC,"It would've been ideal had the Dodgers exceeded their pool last season along with the Yankees, Red Sox, Diamondbacks and Angels. Still, the list of prospects we've already got deals with is impressive:  SS Aramis Ademan, $2 Million 3B Christopher Martinez, $1.5 Million SS Yonathan Perlaza, $1.2 Million C Miguel Amaya, $1.2 Million RHP Anderson Amarista, $1 Million OF Yonathan Estiwal, $1 - $1.5 Million RHP Yunior Perez, $650K SS Luis Diaz, $350K    Adding Martinez and Fox would give us 8 of MLB.com's top-30 international prospects."
CHICubs,38orgl,Sparx7,2,Fri Jun 5 18:27:07 2015 UTC,"Its interesting that Martinez hasn't signed yet considering hes eligible.    There has to be a deal in place somewhere and hopefully we can play the ""Hey look we dont have a young CF to play but the dodgers OF is pretty full you can play in the majors quicker here"" card.  haha"
CHICubs,38orgl,thejazzmarauder,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:29:34 2015 UTC,Definitely. Harder for the Dodgers to spend indiscriminately on a CF prospect given that they've got Joc.
CHICubs,38orgl,Sparx7,3,Fri Jun 5 18:58:38 2015 UTC,the dodgers give 0 fucks about spending money
CHICubs,38orgl,thejazzmarauder,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:16:34 2015 UTC,"I think that the amount they spend this summer will be the straw that breaks the camel's back and finally brings us an International Draft. Front offices in Miami, Houston and Tampa Bay must be sick.   Don't get me wrong, I hope the Cubs take full advantage of the rules while they can."
CHICubs,38orgl,Sparx7,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:22:54 2015 UTC,Yeah I mean its coming sooner or later I'm just interested to see what they do.  I mean now if a team finishes with the worst record do they get the 1st pick in the IFA and regular draft? Do we combine the drafts? Do we put a hard cap on IFA spending? Theres so many drawbacks to each I'll  be curious to see what happens
CHICubs,38orgl,thejazzmarauder,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:28:03 2015 UTC,Cool list - do you have a source?
CHICubs,38orgl,pm_me_ur_pajamas,2,Fri Jun 5 19:49:33 2015 UTC,"Well, those 8 names have been dropped by many different sources, but I believe the actual $ amounts were reported by Kiley McDaniel (though that's off the top of my head and could be wrong)."

CHICubs,38orgl,pm_me_ur_pajamas,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:13:58 2015 UTC,"Every single year the draft and international spending limits get dumber and dumber. I know the major leaguers like it because the less money the owners spend on draftees and overseas then the more money in their pocket, but it just fucks up everything.   The draft is a joke where now a 6th round pick is really a 20th round talent, but you know he'll sign for $5,000 and that leaves you an extra ~$200k to allocate elsewhere."
CHICubs,38orgl,Tjagra,0,Fri Jun 5 20:42:05 2015 UTC,Need to go with an internetionial draft.

CHICubs,38mhgm,STUstone,3,Fri Jun 5 04:16:30 2015 UTC,"Umpires will only initiate a review if they are very sure that the other ump blew a call. If it's close, they leave it in the hands of the ump who was there."

CHICubs,38mhgm,HelloControl_,2,Fri Jun 5 04:23:26 2015 UTC,Umps can review anything after the 6th inning regardless of whether a team still has a challenge.

CHICubs,38mhgm,HelloControl_,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:31:20 2015 UTC,"Actually, from what I read, umps can only initiate reviews if neither team has a challenge remaining.  Also, he looked to be clearly tagged out from every angle I saw."
CHICubs,38mhgm,airham,1 point,Fri Jun 5 07:47:56 2015 UTC,"I reread the rules, they can initiate the review of any home run call, but for other calls they cannot unless the manager who would be challenging has used theirs. So we're both like half right."
CHICubs,38mhgm,jmr33090,8,Fri Jun 5 12:40:26 2015 UTC,"Something I haven't seen around here is the idea that Montero plays better when he has rest time. We talk a lot about this stuff in a bubble, game to game, but I enjoyed this article written right before the Beef trade. Being fresher and facing fewer bad matchups has allowed Montero to rediscover his terrific form of a few years ago, and I think this is one reason we are seeing more Ross time (in addition to Ross being extremely experienced and valuable in his own right). I just don't think it's a good idea for Cubs fans to oversimplify the catching situation, because whether you love or hate Ross, Maddon has a strategy based on quantitative data behind his moves.  http://wrigleyville.locals.baseballprospectus.com/2015/05/19/fresher-miguel-montero-making-trade-look-brilliant/"
CHICubs,38mhgm,Solleret,3,Fri Jun 5 04:29:30 2015 UTC,"I like Montero getting rest. I just wish when it was a situation where we face L-R-L and Lester happens to pitch to the righty, that Montero could catch for him. It's frustrating ALWAYS making our offense worse every time Lester takes the bump."
CHICubs,38mhgm,Doogolas33,2,Fri Jun 5 04:39:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think that anyone is arguing that Montero needs less rest, they just wish we had a backup catcher that was more respectable at the plate."
CHICubs,38mhgm,FredKarlekKnark,8,Fri Jun 5 12:09:12 2015 UTC,I liked what Len & JD were saying last night: you're either going to find a backup catcher who's good offensively or one who's good defensively. If they were both they wouldn't be a backup catcher. So you take what you can get.
CHICubs,38mhgm,maxelrod,17,Fri Jun 5 15:47:01 2015 UTC,"Watch David Ross become this year's version of John Baker. We didn't like him early on, then he won us all over."

CHICubs,38mhld,HelloControl_,8,Fri Jun 5 04:16:49 2015 UTC,I'm guessing they'd noticed how far he was sagging off after the first pitch and it was probably called from the dugout

CHICubs,38mhld,vitey15,6,Fri Jun 5 04:16:36 2015 UTC,"Holy crap David Ross saves the day. Rondon may not be the answer in the 9th inning, if there's another option somewhere in house (Motte) or on the market (Soriano) it's probably time to look at it.

CHICubs,38mhld,TheFakeTimShady,9,Fri Jun 5 04:19:56 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer Motte in the closer role tbh. Rondon is just way too wild, he's almost reminding me of he who shall not be named."
CHICubs,38mhld,fender-b-bender,10,Fri Jun 5 04:24:03 2015 UTC,They say if you say his name three times in a row he shows up in the 9th and blows a save.

CHICubs,38mhld,los_pollos-hermanos,6,Fri Jun 5 04:55:32 2015 UTC,Rondon has walked 5 guys in 22.1 innings.  In his last year with the cubs Marmol walked 21 guys in 27.2 innings.  People need to stop overreacting to one bad game.  Edit: oh and also motte has walked 8 guys in 20 innings this year so I'm not sure how you can say he's a better option
CHICubs,38mhld,Oprah-Is-My-Dad,3,Fri Jun 5 05:40:04 2015 UTC,Plus Rondon was lights out after the all-star game last year.  He's an above average closer.

CHICubs,38mhld,gocubsgo22,3,Fri Jun 5 04:46:34 2015 UTC,"You'd also have to give up an armada of prospects to get those two. You work for three years to build this system and I'm just not sure they're willing to blow a hole in it this year. Next year? Maybe a different story. My guess is that it will be Soriano, all he will cost is money."

CHICubs,38okkv,sober_virgin,5,Fri Jun 5 15:48:17 2015 UTC,"Gray would cost a lot if Beane is even willing to part with him. I'm talking Schwarber + much more price tag. Gray is one of the best young pitchers in the MLB with years of control left.   edit: To get Gray and Zobrist, I imagine the Cubs would have to include one of Schwarber, Baez or Almora (if we are speaking guys not on the MLB roster) + 2 on our top 10."
CHICubs,38okkv,WhiteRabbit13,5,Fri Jun 5 15:51:35 2015 UTC,"Since he gave us Russell last year, & only got two rent-a-players in return, you damn well know he's going to want a TON back for Gray. I don't see it happening."
CHICubs,38okkv,Second_City_Saint,0,Fri Jun 5 16:16:03 2015 UTC,"Beane traded Shark by choice, he didn't have to ship him to the Shit Sox."
CHICubs,38okkv,pm_me_ur_pajamas,2,Fri Jun 5 16:48:47 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't it be worth it though? Almora has an injury history already and he hasn't even hit AAA yet. Gray would be a better investment IMO. Baez, Mendy, Pierce Johnson, Vogelbach, Denorfia for Zobrist/Gray. I think that's perfect"
CHICubs,38okkv,WhiteRabbit13,3,Fri Jun 5 16:40:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Beane will probably want Schwarber. Baez isn't a ""Beane"" player, and I don't think giving up Schwarber is worth it. If he'd take Baez, I'd do it. But I doubt he does."
CHICubs,38okkv,WhiteRabbit13,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:52:02 2015 UTC,Beane usually likes OBP guys right?
CHICubs,38okkv,Oprah-Is-My-Dad,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:06:32 2015 UTC,yup.
CHICubs,38okkv,Gimmie_Dat_Stream,2,Fri Jun 5 17:10:57 2015 UTC,"There's no way Oakland would take that trade. The only way we would get Gray is if we made a deal that included Russell, Bryant, or Shwarber. They aren't gonna trade a young ace for anything less than that."
CHICubs,38okkv,Oprah-Is-My-Dad,0,Fri Jun 5 17:21:33 2015 UTC,I disagree. He shipped out Donaldson (a top 5 third baseman) for a few pieces including Brett Lawrie. Not a big haul. I think Beane is a lot crazier than you guys think.
CHICubs,38okkv,kingofnumber2,2,Fri Jun 5 17:23:41 2015 UTC,"Donaldson's in arbitration and his pay is only gonna go up for a low market team like The A's, he had had to go, Gray is still a couple years away from that so they can afford to hold onto him.  Plus Beane already came out saying he's not trading Gray period."
CHICubs,38okkv,JohnnyWaffleseed,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:42:01 2015 UTC,"Donaldson is 29 and they weren't gonna be able to pay him anyways. Gray is 25, under team control for the next few years, and a legitimate cy young candidate this year. So that's not the same thing at all."
CHICubs,38okkv,thejazzmarauder,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:17:04 2015 UTC,That situation is way different. At the time of the trade I thought it was incredibly dumb but after playing 50 seasons worth of OOTP I understand where Beane was coming from. Arbitration for a small market team blows.
CHICubs,38okkv,kingofnumber2,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:46:49 2015 UTC,Remember the name: Franklin Barreto.   Barretto was the centerpiece for Oakland.
CHICubs,38okkv,WhiteRabbit13,2,Fri Jun 5 21:23:50 2015 UTC,That trade is perfect if you're a Cubs fan; the As would want more.
CHICubs,38okkv,Banglayna,2,Fri Jun 5 17:23:42 2015 UTC,I may be in the minority but I would gladly part ways with both Almora and Baez for Zobrist and Gray.
CHICubs,38okkv,SwedishLovePump,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:45:15 2015 UTC,"That'd be a steal for the Cubs. To get Gray, there will be significant pieces leaving the Cubs. Plus, Beane wouldn't even want Baez or Almora."

CHICubs,38okkv,THEriot2,2,Fri Jun 5 16:48:12 2015 UTC,A rebuilding team doesn't get rebuilt by parting with major league ready arms like Sonny Gray. Imagine last year trading away better Jake Arrieta for some prospects. Probably not going to happen. Not sure I love the Zobrist hype either. I'd like to see Mendy sink or swim this year.

My father in law is an important photographer and he took a photo of a Murton at-bat in 2007 vs the Pirates. He printed, signed and framed  it for me and I hung it in my bathroom, because my wife won't let me have ""manly"" things in the general areas and only lets me hang this one because her daddy took it. So Matt Murton, Ronnie Paulino and Angel Hernández are above my head when I poop."

CHICubs,38jaym,kbergstr,9,Thu Jun 4 16:38:12 2015 UTC,I loved watching Z bat-- those unexpected homers were fantastic.
CHICubs,38jaym,scairborn,5,Thu Jun 4 18:16:39 2015 UTC,I loved that Z was a hitting pitcher and that he was called on to pinch hit.   That's why I still rock my Zambrano jersey. Do I deserve shade thrown my way when I do?
CHICubs,38jaym,kbergstr,6,Thu Jun 4 18:54:26 2015 UTC,I hate the BS - only wear jersey's of current players-- the only one that benefits is the jersey makers. They're trying to make them seem disposable. Rock the Big Z and you'll get a high five from me.
CHICubs,38jaym,RustyDarkstar76,2,Thu Jun 4 19:30:57 2015 UTC,"the only one that benefits is the jersey makers.   You know there's is a retired players pention, that vintage makers have to pay for all those old school jerseys?  Also It's weird as an adult to wear some kids last name on your own back.  as a 33 yr old I can justify guys like Sandberg, Grace as they were my heros as a child."
CHICubs,38jaym,kbergstr,2,Thu Jun 4 21:22:36 2015 UTC,"That's awesome that they do that-- I was more thinking about the general idea that when a player is traded, you can't wear his jersey anymore. I think that's stupid.   And I agree-- I have that same weird feeling about jerseys."

CHICubs,38jaym,_ruinr_,2,Thu Jun 4 21:03:53 2015 UTC,That was the reason I bought his jersey.
CHICubs,38jaym,reithescout,58,Fri Jun 5 21:04:49 2015 UTC,"Derrek Lee.  Also surprisingly, Ted Lilly. Remember that one game vs. TheSox where Lily and the opposing pitcher brought no-hitters through 8.2 innings? That was awesome. Also, the rain made it more memorable"
CHICubs,38jaym,UNSTABLETON_LIVE,17,Thu Jun 4 16:54:49 2015 UTC,"Those are my top two too.  I flew solo to a game about eight? years ago and asked the box office for the best ticket he had.  I got sat with the players wives.  I thought there were a lot of attractive women around, but I chalked it up to being in rich peoples seats.... until Ted Lilly sits down next to me.  Turns out the smoking hot blondes next to me where his wife and her sister.  I chatted him up for a few minutes and told him I would leave him alone if he told me something that the average fan wouldn't know.  He told me Kosuke Fukodome CHAIN SMOKES between innings.  I left him alone."
CHICubs,38jaym,Faskis,12,Thu Jun 4 18:21:46 2015 UTC,"Definitely Lilly. Guy was hilarious too. I also remember the day after Z's no-hitter, Lilly hadn't allowed any hits through like six innings. Solid guy to have in the rotation."
CHICubs,38jaym,TangledUpInAzul,9,Thu Jun 4 17:43:56 2015 UTC,I agree on both of those. I feel like Lee getting traded was the end of an era. And I loved Lily too but I feel like he's not one of the guys that everybody remembers.

My friend's mother had worked with the Tribune Company and managed to get us tickets right next to Cubs dugout during the Cross Town Classic. Bases were loaded, and Derrek Lee, who was sitting out resting an injury, convinces Piniella that he's ready to go. He gets called in to pinch-hit and knocks it out of the park.   This game, for those who were wondering"
CHICubs,38jaym,LarryHolmes,2,Thu Jun 4 20:36:12 2015 UTC,"I remember watching that one live. He clearly wasn't back to 100% because he was really off the following few weeks, but for that moment, he was a hero again."

I'm only 20 and have only began to actually heavily follow the Cubs since like 2010 so I obviously don't  remember Harry Carey but I've always heard he was a shitty person.
CHICubs,38jaym,Harrolddilshore,3,Fri Jun 5 01:24:20 2015 UTC,Harry was a great broadcaster and a party animal and everyone seemed to love him. I haven't heard too much negative said about him.

CHICubs,38jaym,Harrolddilshore,4,Fri Jun 5 03:14:07 2015 UTC,"Except that time he got traded in the middle of the season to the Rangers for Kyle Hendricks and Christian Villanueva, which has benefited the Cubs tremendously."
CHICubs,38jaym,DavidBenAkiva,0,Fri Jun 5 03:20:06 2015 UTC,I'm talking about when he denied getting traded to the Braves for possibly Julio teheran
CHICubs,38jaym,Stony_Curtis,2,Fri Jun 5 03:26:35 2015 UTC,Well he clearly didn't stick around for the rest of the season acting all whiny until he entered free agency. I'm going to think you're thinking of someone else.
CHICubs,38jaym,drybutter,12,Fri Jun 5 03:31:24 2015 UTC,Kerry Wood in the rotation right now would be pretty damn sweet.
CHICubs,38jaym,Doogolas33,0,Thu Jun 4 18:31:21 2015 UTC,Let's just hope there aren't any boomboxes in the locker room for him to smash again.
CHICubs,38jaym,oldmangandalfstyle,38,Thu Jun 4 23:13:01 2015 UTC,"Soriano. He always worked his ass off. Was extremely gracious. Got booed viciously and still had nothing but wonderful things to say about the Cubs, even after he left.  I LOVE Alfonso Soriano."
CHICubs,38jaym,Doogolas33,6,Thu Jun 4 18:07:50 2015 UTC,"This! I remember as a young growing Cubs fan when David Caplan would always rip him apart and I just always loved him. I also hated David Caplan for that for a long time, which was silly, but still. He was my favorite player since I started following the Cubs and being a fan, and still is my favorite ever. His batting stance was always so infectious to me. Just screamed energy and power. I miss him!"
CHICubs,38jaym,030927,3,Thu Jun 4 18:49:43 2015 UTC,"I hate Caplan because he's pretty clearly racist. His whipping boys have been: Aramis Ramirez Alfonso Soriano Starlin Castro  One of them goes, so he jumps on the new one. I'm too young to remember anyone before that. I'm sure it was Sosa towards the end of his tenure. Like 03-04 season. And before that, I dunno, maybe Alou? But I can't actually confirm that. I'm not old enough to have read Caplan back then. But his whipping boy has always, always always been someone Hispanic."
CHICubs,38jaym,Doogolas33,5,Thu Jun 4 18:57:19 2015 UTC,i don't see that he's CLEARLY racist.
CHICubs,38jaym,RustyDarkstar76,2,Thu Jun 4 19:55:51 2015 UTC,"He jumps all over every single Latin player that the Cubs have. Every one of them. I would bet he's had some scathing articles about Baez, too. And probably Lake.   He's probably not /purposefully/ racist. But he is extremely bias against a particular race and culture."
CHICubs,38jaym,Doogolas33,4,Thu Jun 4 20:08:58 2015 UTC,"But he is extremely bias against a particular race and culture.   uh, that's exactly what racist is.  That being said he's not, he's just a huge tool is all."
CHICubs,38jaym,jrock826,2,Thu Jun 4 21:19:20 2015 UTC,"He's a much bigger tool to folks of a particular culture and race. For example, we've all seen Rizzo pimp home runs, and it's even cost Rizzo a double once or twice, but he doesn't write articles about it like he has with Castro, Ramirez, and Soriano. I'm 100% positive he has had a major part of an article dedicated to the latter two because of them staring at what turned to be a ball off the wall. And he's had so many about Castro not hustling that it's kind of unbelievable."
CHICubs,38jaym,oldmangandalfstyle,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:22:14 2015 UTC,"I don't see how David Kaplan (it's with a K) is prejudiced in any way. I know him personally and he's a great guy.

CHICubs,38jaym,Doogolas33,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:26:26 2015 UTC,I apologize for mispelling his name. I don't think he's racist either. I just wanted him to leave my favorite player alone was all.

I didn't say he's a hateful man, just racist. It's pretty obvious following him who he hates on, and it's also obvious that it's related to a culture thing. Which is a massive part of racism. Perhaps racism isn't the word, but he is very biased against a particular culture. And it has shown over the years from those who tend to be his whipping boy."

CHICubs,38jaym,AsTheRootsUndo_,7,Thu Jun 4 20:18:49 2015 UTC,"He came surprisingly close to producing the money we gave him.  He also got us Corey Black, who is looking mighty good, from the Yankees.   Are you forgetting he got rid of the hop, and didn't hop one single time after, I believe, 2009 or 2010?

We became friends with him and occasionally went over to his house for dinner. He invited us over one time where the whole team was there for a house party. I remember little 8 year old me so star struck standing next to the whole team. Im 15 now and it was a big part of why I love baseball so much now. He also came into our side yard and played catch with me once which was amazing. Ryan Dempster is such a great guy.

CHICubs,38jaym,voidecho,4,Thu Jun 4 18:20:48 2015 UTC,You actually can measure clutch. It's literally a stat on fangraphs.
CHICubs,38jaym,Doogolas33,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:02:09 2015 UTC,Thought you said hitting with RISP was BS?  ;)
CHICubs,38jaym,voidecho,3,Thu Jun 4 20:27:52 2015 UTC,"Being able to measure it doesn't mean that any one particular person, let alone team, has a magic ability or inability to do it. We can measure the value of clutch play, because such situations arise. But over the long haul the best clutch players are the best players, and the worst ones are the bad players. Given a large enough sample most guys end up pretty much where you'd expect. A .300 hitter will probably be around .300, a .250 hitter likely around .250, a .900OPS guy around .900.   Thus, we perceive a good player to be more clutch than a bad one, but they are more than likely playing to their ability.   Doesn't mean weird stretches don't happen.   TL;DR: the ability to measure something says nothing of its predictive value."

CHICubs,38fo9k,trapper2530,6,Thu Jun 4 00:02:06 2015 UTC,"He hasn't been on the big club in the regular season yet this year so, no service time.  His time last year is factored in.  It all goes on number of days.  Once a player gets to 172 days, they get credit for a full year.  A June 11th callup would give him 171 days at the end of the year which would be identical to Bryant.  For example, for guys like Szczur who have gotten called up and down, they get credit for each day on the big league club (subject to other special rules) and it may take them 3+ years to get credit for a full season of service time."
CHICubs,38fo9k,trapper2530,2,Thu Jun 4 00:30:05 2015 UTC,What if there is a rainout/tie in standings and play game 162 a day after the final game? Or play game 163? Does that extra day factor in?
CHICubs,38fo9k,NLRD,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:01:20 2015 UTC,Nope.  End of the regularly scheduled season.  After Taylor reported that Jesse Rogers said that game 163 counts I dug into the rule and looked back to the 2013 season.  That year the Rays and Rangers played game 163 yet players like Wil Myers (who played a partial season in 2013) have the appropriate amount of service time up to game 162.
CHICubs,38fo9k,KCchemist,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:01:44 2015 UTC,Good to know thanks. So its the scheduled date of game 162 even with a rainout and makeup from July played as game 162?
CHICubs,38fo9k,NLRD,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:28:36 2015 UTC,"Right.  Last day of the regular season which is, generally, the same day for all teams.  The first day of the season is Opening Day, regardless of regular season games played during Spring Training (think games in Japan/Australia/etc...).  This year it was the Cubs/Cards game so all players received 1 day of service time on that day."
CHICubs,38fo9k,remotecourting,2,Fri Jun 5 23:39:13 2015 UTC,"Unpopular opinion alert: here is what I think happens with Javy. He stays in AAA putting up big numbers until July, at which time he is traded for a pitcher and immediately goes to the majors with another team.  Keeping him down ensures that he doesn't fail again and hurt his trade value.  I'm not saying I support or oppose this move, just that I think that is what happens."
CHICubs,38fo9k,wholetthecatsout,2,Thu Jun 4 12:28:07 2015 UTC,"Unpopular in that it's not likely?  Or unpopular in that we don't want it to happen?  Because, to me, I think this situation is highly possible and I don't want it to happen."
CHICubs,38fo9k,wholetthecatsout,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:27:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think the majority of Cubs fans want him to be traded, but I think it's gonna happen.  With so many high K guys already around, I think Theo and Jed would rather get another frontline starter and leave the infield as-is."
CHICubs,38fo9k,TheFakeTimShady,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:52:51 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind Baez is a Hendry selection, and pretty much the antithesis of everything Epstein/ Hoyer draft in offensive players (ie, a critical-eyed hitter who gets on base my any means necessary and works the count deep)."
CHICubs,38fo9k,Jgb2,2,Fri Jun 5 02:18:16 2015 UTC,I'm not convinced this will have that much of a factor in the F.O.'s decision to call him up.. This team needs a pick-me-up and it needs to happen soon.
CHICubs,38fo9k,wholetthecatsout,2,Thu Jun 4 04:00:06 2015 UTC,"Eh, at this point we are a week out.  If they are convinced his changes are legit and he is going to be an impact player for years, they won't sacrifice that entire year of control for a week.  They didn't with Bryant, they didn't with Rizzo and they won't with Baez.  They might wait until after the next homestead but it won't be before that date."
CHICubs,38fo9k,aussum_possum,2,Thu Jun 4 15:41:14 2015 UTC,"I guess maybe I'm just too eager to see the offense get some sort of shot in the arm.. Their confidence seems to be waning and the team needs something to get them going, and I'm hoping an eager to prove himself Javy Baez will help wake up the rest of the team.."
CHICubs,38fo9k,enjoytheshow,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:55:25 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. They need something to sort of jolt them because the intensity, focus and production is all trending down.

CHICubs,38fo9k,thejazzmarauder,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:48:26 2015 UTC,"A lot of that is just part of the ups and downs of a long season, especially witch such a young team."
CHICubs,38fo9k,thejazzmarauder,3,Thu Jun 4 20:11:44 2015 UTC,Agreed it's pretty dissapointing to see a lot of fans jumping off the ledge the passed few days-- If you didn't see rough times like this coming you had your expectations way too high in the first place.
CHICubs,38fo9k,thejazzmarauder,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:28:03 2015 UTC,Didn't the Cubs catch some hell for doing that with Bryant? Do you think they'll do the same thing again? Can't wait to see Baez in the majors!
CHICubs,38fo9k,thejazzmarauder,3,Thu Jun 4 16:20:29 2015 UTC,Every team does it every year. We caught hell for it because Bryant had a great spring and was turning heads. Most people don't know who Javier Baez is.
CHICubs,38fo9k,NeverSummerMountains,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:48:22 2015 UTC,"Yes and yes, every chance they get.  Mid-season callups will never get the same scrutiny as Opening Day so I think if Baez does get called up on the 11th the only real mention of it will be a passing reference."

CHICubs,38eyip,LarryHolmes,3,Thu Jun 4 04:49:45 2015 UTC,I couldn't be more surprised if I woke up with my head sewn to the carpet Eddie. I should watch more Nippon ball. I might be able to convince myself even I could still hit pitching like that and pretend that I could live out my Mr. Baseball fantasy. It'd be a nice distraction anyway...
CHICubs,38eyip,Sparx7,2,Thu Jun 4 03:12:51 2015 UTC,"From now on, when the Japanese eat sushi, it will be served with wasabi and Murton."

CHICubs,38eyip,equregs,2,Thu Jun 4 04:32:32 2015 UTC,Murton always could put the bat on the ball.  It's not too surprising that he went over there and destroyed mostly AAA level pitching.
CHICubs,38eyip,Rudas_Iskariot,4,Thu Jun 4 12:31:49 2015 UTC,"I did know.... and given that Japanese Baseball isn't the same difficulty as MLB, it appears he's been able to thrive there, so not too weird in my book.  Still somewhat surprised that they chose Cliff Floyd over Matt Murton in LF."

CHICubs,38eyip,Stony_Curtis,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:03:27 2015 UTC,"I have seen the Nippon league described as AAAA by various baseball people.  I always felt Murton was a hair away from becoming a really good player and just didn't quite get there.  He obviously had some very good play for the Cubs.   We see players improve all the time switching leagues, so imagine that scenario and switching down to slightly worse pitching.  I think this also speaks to one of my favorite all-around players, Ichiro Suzuki.  I have heard a lot of talk on sports shows about combining his Nippon hits with his MLB hits to make him some sort of ""all world hits leader"".  I don't think you can count those hits anymore than you can count AAA hits."

CHICubs,38gqmv,Tjagra,5,Thu Jun 4 02:32:53 2015 UTC,"Go Alcantara, go!"
CHICubs,38gqmv,Doogolas33,2,Thu Jun 4 04:18:23 2015 UTC,That's someone whom I really want to see do well. I could see him as a great leadoff batter with his speed
CHICubs,38gqmv,Jollyman21,3,Thu Jun 4 15:48:52 2015 UTC,Would be great replacing Fowler next year.
CHICubs,38gqmv,Doogolas33,2,Thu Jun 4 16:11:33 2015 UTC,"Cubs need to find the CF of next year, and I'm sure they don't want to dish out any long-term contracts to anyone over 30.  Alcantara can defensively handle the position; if he can just get his offense in order he could certainly man the position next season."
CHICubs,38gqmv,stackshot,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:32:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly. He's almost literally the perfect fill in. Everything about him is Dexter Fowler, just at age 22. Dexter Fowler is basically his perfect world outcome. With maybe a tick more HR power."
CHICubs,38gqmv,Doogolas33,2,Thu Jun 4 16:59:08 2015 UTC,Except OBP. Fowler's career OBP is nearly 100 points higher than his BA. he's never posted a walk rate under 10% since his first year of Single-A ball. Mendy's career walk rate throughout all levels is 6.6%. nearly half of Fowler's. What makes Fowler such a great leadoff hitter is the fact that he gets on base so much. Right now Mendy strikes out way too much and doesn't walk nearly enough to be comparable to Fowler's leadoff skills.
CHICubs,38gqmv,SwedishLovePump,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:07:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that's because Mendy didn't walk early on in the minors. He was at 4.1% and 5.3% his first two years in the minor leagues. Since then he's put up 10.8%, 6.8%, and 9.4%.   Cantra will take his walks. Maybe not quite as much as Fowler, but he also has more power, so it's not a huge deal. Nobody is a PERFECT example for any player. Such a thing doesn't exist, but Cantra is as close to Fowler as anyone is ever likely to get. He might put up a .350OBP instead of .370, but he'll hit for a little more extra base power as well. And he'll still be a great guy at the top of the lineup.  He strikes out way too much? Last year in AAA he struck out 22.7% of the time, this year he's at 23.8%. Fowler has struck out >23% of the time in half of his previous four* seasons. And is at right about 23% so far this year.   He doesn't strike out too much, and he walks enough. Looking at his aggregate numbers just makes no sense when he's such a different hitter than he was early on in his minor league career."
CHICubs,38gqmv,Doogolas33,2,Thu Jun 4 19:13:35 2015 UTC,"He strikes out way too much? Last year in AAA he struck out 22.7% of the time, this year he's at 23.8%. Fowler has struck out >23% of the time in half of his previous four* seasons. And is at right about 23% so far this year.   You're conveniently comparing Mendy's AAA numbers to Fowlers MLB numbers. Mendy's K rates this year and last are at 34/31 in the pros. Fowler never touched 25."
CHICubs,38gqmv,SwedishLovePump,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:24:16 2015 UTC,"And Rizzo had a really bad start, too. A lot of guys, many, many guys adjust to the MLB level and see their K rate be very similar to their minor league numbers. Should Mendy adjust he can very well be sitting in that same 22-24% range that Fowler was. I didn't conveniently compare anything.   If Alcantara can't adjust, then the whole thing is moot anyways."
CHICubs,38gqmv,Doogolas33,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:07:06 2015 UTC,"A lot of guys, many, many guys adjust to the MLB level and see their K rate be very similar to their minor league numbers.   But that's not the point. You said    Everything about him is Dexter Fowler, just at age 22.   Which is just not true. Mendy's got a lot of differences from Fowler's game and career trajectory. If he does adjust, he could turn into a Fowler with more pop. But he right now, he definitely isn't. You could say Mendy is to AAA what Fowler is to the majors, but that's not really worth anything."
CHICubs,38gqmv,SwedishLovePump,2,Thu Jun 4 20:19:04 2015 UTC,Yep. Always find myself rooting for him. I just remember that monster Homer he hit in the futures game. MLB found a hole (soft stuff away) early hopefully consistent at bats and warmer weather help. They need him.
CHICubs,38gqmv,TheFakeTimShady,3,Thu Jun 4 17:22:23 2015 UTC,Villanueva has been on a little bit of a tear recently...
CHICubs,38gqmv,kellywp,3,Thu Jun 4 03:26:26 2015 UTC,I think Arismendy and Baez should both come up on the 11th

CHICubs,38eq3e,Illinijuice07,17,Wed Jun 3 18:52:45 2015 UTC,I like where we are going with this
CHICubs,38eq3e,STUstone,17,Wed Jun 3 18:58:43 2015 UTC,if Soler goes to the DL I'm guessing we see Baez up to play 3b bryant to LF  Still would prefer Castro 3b Russell SS Baez 2b but I can understand not wanting to have Castro make the move in the middle of the season
CHICubs,38eq3e,Sparx7,5,Wed Jun 3 19:32:11 2015 UTC,"Welp, Baxter is called up as Soler goes to the DL.  May be a short lived recall for Baxter"
CHICubs,38eq3e,callthebluff,3,Wed Jun 3 20:21:48 2015 UTC,I agree with you.  Its slightly unfortunate because June 11th means an extra year of control but I can't see the Cubs waiting that long if Soler is on the DL.  Although another option would to bring up Alcantara for the time being
CHICubs,38eq3e,Sparx7,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:36:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not that concerned about that year of control.  I have no reason to believe this, but if Baez works out, I think we'll buy out a year or two."
CHICubs,38eq3e,thejazzmarauder,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:08:50 2015 UTC,I'm no good with how option years work but Baez isn't a rookie anymore so its not like this would be his first call up.  I mean hes gonna use an option this year regardless of when he gets called up by my understanding.
CHICubs,38eq3e,Sparx7,6,Wed Jun 3 19:44:50 2015 UTC,"Nah, if they wait to bring him up until after the 11th, they'll get an extra year of control (pre-arbitration). His 6-year clock is already set, but there's no chance they'll call him up a week before gaining that extra year.   Edit: my understanding was flawed. See u/friendlyconfines below for knowledge."

CHICubs,38eq3e,thejazzmarauder,3,Thu Jun 4 14:57:23 2015 UTC,"No, when they call him up on June 11, he will be in line for Super 2.  I think, what you mean, is that Javy, pretty much, is guarranteed to be a super-two (barring him sucking again and his service time getting screwed up because of that)"
CHICubs,38eq3e,friendlyconfines,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:52:49 2015 UTC,"If you have to take service time as cumulative across seasons to have Super Two status, then it wouldn't be Super Two status, would it?"
CHICubs,38eq3e,thejazzmarauder,3,Thu Jun 4 00:15:02 2015 UTC,"No, Baez will have Super Two status (so long as he doesn't get sent down again) after the 2017 season when he should have 2.171 years of service time.  Take Evan Scribner for example, even though he was first called up in 2011, he still isn't arbitration eligible because he only had 1.142 service time at the end of last season.  Without Super Two, he'd be eligible for arbitration after the 2016 season; however, he is a likely candidate to receive Super Two status this year and get a nice little bump in salary."

CHICubs,38dm6f,djb2287,3,Wed Jun 3 16:18:33 2015 UTC,I'd still say of the young guys in the league he has one of the best shots. Probably over 1000 by seasons end.
CHICubs,38dm6f,trapper2530,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:09:54 2015 UTC,I don't know about Ichiro. He's already 40 and isn't a full time starter anymore. He's 123 hits away. I hope he get's it though because he's one of my favorite players.
CHICubs,38dm6f,keigs,2,Wed Jun 3 18:52:31 2015 UTC,"If his usage remains stable, he's on pace for 71 more hits. I think he'd stay around for 52 more hits. I think he'll stick around to get it almost regardless of how he finishes.  Either way, it remains that he has a better chance at 3,000 than nearly everyone in the league, and certainly anyone under 30. For all the young guys, we can see ""if he does this"" or ""if he does that"", but the fact is that Ichiro HAS done just that already. The ""ifs"" for Ichiro are much less frequent and much more attainable."
CHICubs,38dm6f,THEriot2,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:58:08 2015 UTC,He filled in when yelich was injured though so I don't think we can count on him getting the same consistency of playing time
CHICubs,38dm6f,nab95,2,Wed Jun 3 19:05:06 2015 UTC,"Yelich didn't miss too long, and Ichiro's played in 49 of 53 games. He's currently on pace for 355 at bats. I'd say it's pretty certain he gets 300 ABs. That gives him 85 hits on the year which would put him 71 short of 3,000 for his career.   It'll be close. I say he gets it, and it's no where anyone really cares about for a bad team."
CHICubs,38dm6f,THEriot2,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:54:05 2015 UTC,I think Ichiro will stay around long enough to get there. He's still good enough to play in this league.
CHICubs,38dm6f,djb2287,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:41:29 2015 UTC,"I'd love for him to get there, but looking at his stats, I don't see him getting there. He has only been getting an AB a game with an occasional start every 4 or 5 games. At the age of 40, an athletes body is in its' decline.  Edit: He is 41 and is turning 42 in October."

CHICubs,38dm6f,north102,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:17:51 2015 UTC,I think last night they said it was Ron Santo.
CHICubs,38dm6f,voidecho,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:39:50 2015 UTC,"Castro is struggling right now, particularly on those sliders. His ass is sticking out while he grounds out to short. One positive is that he's still hitting the ball far when he hits it in the air. I don't think this is another 2013 campaign. If it is, it'll be for different reasons."
CHICubs,38dm6f,ughalready,2,Wed Jun 3 20:18:02 2015 UTC,"The problem right now is that he's not hitting for any power. his ISO is just .079. His line drive and fly ball % are down so his GB% is way up at 60%, and when he does hit a fly ball, 23% of the time it's in the infield, versus a career average of 8%."
CHICubs,38dm6f,ComBendy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:33:49 2015 UTC,It's not just sliders.  He's trying to pull many of the fastballs on the outside half of the plate too rather than driving them to center or right.  I'm sure it's a temporary funk and he'll have a hot streak soon.
CHICubs,38f5l0,StressedOut_Student,2,Wed Jun 3 20:22:51 2015 UTC,PLEASE NO MORE MIKE BAXTER
CHICubs,38f5l0,morningsaystoidleon,2,Wed Jun 3 22:39:38 2015 UTC,:( I didn't think it was bad enough to place him on the DL..
CHICubs,38f5l0,RCoombs77,2,Wed Jun 3 20:31:40 2015 UTC,I've seen that it's been said that he will be missing 6 weeks. Please be wrong..
CHICubs,38f5l0,Sephiroth007,2,Wed Jun 3 21:04:54 2015 UTC,That's from ace reporters Jesse Rogers and Gordon Wittenmeyer.  They don't know what the fuck they're talking about. Cubs are saying 3 weeks tops.

CHICubs,38f5l0,morningsaystoidleon,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:25:06 2015 UTC,This highlights one major flaw with this team right now: we are not deep enough yet.  Mike Baxter and Jonathan Herrera are not viable major league players.
CHICubs,38gnu5,ChiCubsbot,16,Thu Jun 4 02:12:16 2015 UTC,Congrats to anyone who watched the entire game
CHICubs,38gnu5,NeverSummerMountains,13,Thu Jun 4 02:23:41 2015 UTC,"Positives: Castro is hitting more fly balls. And he's smashing them when he does.  Junior Lake's new approach and mechanical changes look really,  really interesting."

CHICubs,38gnu5,Thetiredduck,4,Thu Jun 4 03:42:38 2015 UTC,"In 2007, before Memorial Day, the team was mediocre. On Memorial Day, at Wrigley against the Dodgers, there was a close call at third and the ump was right to call an out on Theriot. Uncle Lou came out and blew up for the first time as a Cubs manager, and he kicked dirt and threw his hat and it was awesome to watch, but it was also a watershed moment, and the team started playing better and made it to the postseason.   Tonight the last few innings were much of the same we saw before the meltdown and the benches clearing."

CHICubs,38f3gr,SoddenEye,5,Thu Jun 4 01:22:54 2015 UTC,Yeah I think that delivery should not be allowed under the rules.

CHICubs,38f3gr,Dhash23,5,Thu Jun 4 01:04:55 2015 UTC,Well Lake was really really bad last year so it's not surprising he's regarded much lower then Soler.
CHICubs,38f3gr,chicagocubs04,2,Thu Jun 4 01:09:34 2015 UTC,"I'm totally cool with keeping both, better than Baxter and Coghlan I think. Although I do like Cogs as a bench guy and 4th outfielder."
CHICubs,38f3gr,Cohaagan,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:09:00 2015 UTC,"Careful, I got reamed here for even suggesting Lake should be getting a few starts over Cogs every once in awhile."
CHICubs,38f3gr,Banglayna,4,Thu Jun 4 01:20:57 2015 UTC,"Lake is playing well. But they're following the same pattern so far, except Soler's curve is a little higher.  Both were called up late in the year and impressed. In their first season, they hit some struggles (though Lake's struggles last year were way worse than Soler's this year.). I think we need to be patient and ride it out with Soler, while Lake get some starts in left.  Edit: And as /u/big-mo stated, even with Soler's recent struggles, he leads all rookies in hits."
CHICubs,38f3gr,fightintxag13,0,Thu Jun 4 01:08:09 2015 UTC,"Soler is great, don't get me wrong. But I've watched 90% of the Cubs game and don't get how everyone is so defensive of him."
CHICubs,38f3gr,Dhash23,2,Thu Jun 4 01:25:11 2015 UTC,"Just so we're clear when you're referring ""Soler's recent struggles"" you're referring to the month that just finished in which the Cubs 23 year old with just over 300 plate appearances in the majors, improved his OBP by 17 points, SLG by 28 points, OPS by 45 points and average by 41 points compared to the previous month and only struck out once more in May than he did in April despite playing eight more games in May. These are the struggles to which you're referring?  Sorry to be rude but ""Soler's Struggles"" aren't a real thing. They're a made up story by Jesse Rogers and other writers who are bored and not particularly bright baseball people. Fact is, Soler remains this team's third or fourth best hitter who continues to improve. It's time to put the ""Struggling Soler"" narrative in a deep, dark hole."
CHICubs,38f3gr,TheFakeTimShady,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:25:01 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I like Soler a lot, but his K rate is over 32% this season, which is disconcerting. Soler is one of the Cubs' best hitters, but he needs to cut down his Ks and he needs to hit better with RISP, though that should come with more PAs and balance out over a larger sample size.  If you took my comment at face value, you would know that I am pro-Soler, but to pretend everything has been 100% peachy with him isn't accurate, IMO."
CHICubs,38f3gr,fightintxag13,2,Thu Jun 4 01:36:31 2015 UTC,And everybody's pick for ROY so far Joc Peterson only has 4 less strikeouts than Soler.
CHICubs,38f3gr,big-mo,3,Thu Jun 4 01:17:04 2015 UTC,lake's been in the league since 2013
CHICubs,38f3gr,inevitablescape,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:10:45 2015 UTC,"You are correct.  Doesn't change the fact that Soler's career arc has been similar to Lake's so far, albeit his struggles weren't as severe. Just one season apart. Probably should have made that point a little more clear."

CHICubs,38f3gr,voidecho,4,Thu Jun 4 01:02:26 2015 UTC,Cubs REALLY need Lake and Szczur to produce if they want to contend.  The bench on this team really freekin stinks.

CHICubs,38f3gr,Nebarnes,2,Thu Jun 4 00:51:29 2015 UTC,We might have a rally here boys!
CHICubs,38f3gr,Cohaagan,2,Thu Jun 4 00:51:03 2015 UTC,Castro! almost got another homer. just a triple
CHICubs,38f3gr,inevitablescape,0,Thu Jun 4 00:50:45 2015 UTC,Calm the fuck down Marlins.
CHICubs,38f3gr,cubswinagain,3,Thu Jun 4 00:48:40 2015 UTC,LOL  down 4 and he does some shit talking after hitting 1 HR all year..
CHICubs,38f3gr,DoctorTheWho,0,Thu Jun 4 00:48:29 2015 UTC,I think it was because they supposedly hit Castro on purpose.
CHICubs,38f3gr,voidecho,2,Thu Jun 4 00:50:09 2015 UTC,Huh? It grazed his leg maybe?
CHICubs,38f3gr,ThePelicanWalksAgain,3,Thu Jun 4 00:54:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I actually think some of the Marlin's bench were barking at Lake as he ran from 2nd to 3rd because he posed too much after the HR and he was telling them to shhh...that's more likely now that I think about it."
CHICubs,38f3gr,voidecho,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:59:48 2015 UTC,Marlins players trying to come out and fight Haren for giving up runs to this anemic offense.

CHICubs,38f3gr,voidecho,2,Thu Jun 4 00:40:48 2015 UTC,I arrive on the scene...and a wild home-run appears.

CHICubs,38f3gr,nakolas,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:39:18 2015 UTC,There's a big difference (to me) between the rotisserie chicken and all the rest of their chicken.
CHICubs,38f3gr,uhhhhmmmm,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:46:14 2015 UTC,I think an older chicken that has been out of the rotisserie for a couple hours tastes better than a fresh one. Have you tried that?
CHICubs,38f3gr,nakolas,6,Thu Jun 4 00:54:01 2015 UTC,How about some good news...Schwarber was 3/4 with 3 RBI today.
CHICubs,38f3gr,voidecho,2,Thu Jun 4 00:36:35 2015 UTC,Bring him up and move Ross to bullpen catcher.
CHICubs,38f3gr,nakolas,3,Thu Jun 4 00:42:14 2015 UTC,We'll lose 2 of 3 to the Marlins and then sweep the Nationals.
CHICubs,38f3gr,voidecho,2,Thu Jun 4 00:35:45 2015 UTC,We do seem to go to sleep against the sub-par teams...

CHICubs,38f3gr,TheFakeTimShady,3,Thu Jun 4 00:35:24 2015 UTC,Ugh Lester. So many tough series coming up and we're going to dump games to the Marlins.
CHICubs,38f3gr,j4callen,6,Thu Jun 4 00:35:19 2015 UTC,Lester right now
CHICubs,38f3gr,American_Soviet,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:35:02 2015 UTC,"This is the year where Joe gets acclimated with the teams core. Next year we bring in more pitching, better bullpen, and nucleus that has jelled together."

CHICubs,38f3gr,nakolas,2,Thu Jun 4 00:37:25 2015 UTC,Do you keep Lester in and save as much as the bullpen as possible for the Nats or pull him?
CHICubs,38f3gr,DonkeyShow5,3,Thu Jun 4 00:34:11 2015 UTC,"Might as well keep him in at least for the fifth inning, hopefully the 6th too. He was just up at the plate so I'm hoping he can get out of the 5th and 6th if he doesn't bat again next inning"
CHICubs,38f3gr,Cohaagan,2,Thu Jun 4 00:35:33 2015 UTC,"Might as well just leave him in, Joe.  Let him work out whatever is distracting him on the mound."
CHICubs,38f3gr,gamenut89,3,Thu Jun 4 00:33:32 2015 UTC,It's probably over. Get what Lester has left and then let Jackson and Wood finish it off.

CHICubs,38f3gr,chilango2,2,Thu Jun 4 00:28:31 2015 UTC,"Not really about that doom and gloom, but if you're going long stretches with Castro and Lake hitting 4th, and David Ross playing 40% of the time, you're not going to score more than 3-4 runs per game very often. Puts tremendous pressure on the pitching staff."

CHICubs,38d84w,gat1155,-3,Wed Jun 3 20:19:24 2015 UTC,I remember when Travis Wood was legit.
CHICubs,38d84w,gat1155,4,Wed Jun 3 16:10:56 2015 UTC,"Travis Wood never was legit, you're remembering incorrectly"
CHICubs,38d84w,WhiteRabbit13,-8,Wed Jun 3 16:18:25 2015 UTC,EXACTLY what they'll say about Hendricks in a year when people point back to stuff like this.
CHICubs,38d84w,re-tardis,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:59:49 2015 UTC,Not trying to be rude but did you read the post? It specifically highlights why hes able to do what he does.
CHICubs,38d84w,bibbers01,-8,Wed Jun 3 17:14:17 2015 UTC,"Guess that's it then. There's a positive article on a Cubs site about Kyle Hendricks. Close the books boys, Maddux has been reborn."
CHICubs,38d84w,Doogolas33,3,Wed Jun 3 17:18:25 2015 UTC,Not at all its a deeper dive than just saying oh hes been good lately.  Look at the command and control illustrated and explained.  Not saying hes a stud but you could do a lot worse for a number 3/4
CHICubs,38d84w,bibbers01,5,Wed Jun 3 17:30:04 2015 UTC,"Don't waste your time guys, he's a troll."

CHICubs,38d84w,gat1155,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:09:20 2015 UTC,Yeah there's a pretty big middle ground between a pitcher being useful and being Greg Maddux. Literally the article ends with giving him good #3 upside.
CHICubs,38d84w,bibbers01,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:32:58 2015 UTC,"If you looked at the things I specifically looked at, you would have known Wood sucks ass. His FIP was never good. Ever. He also walked people. And didn't get grounders.   Travis Wood was never, ever good. If Wood got >50% grounders he would actually be ok."
CHICubs,38d84w,gat1155,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:31:46 2015 UTC,Wrong. Hendricks has had peripherals that Wood has never even touched. Wood had an All-star season he never should have had because he is an extreme fly ball pitcher (33% GB in 2013) who had a very lucky year. His xFIP suggested his ERA should have been 4.5 that year. Which is very similar to what his actual ERA is now and probably always will be.
CHICubs,38d84w,bibbers01,-2,Wed Jun 3 17:35:16 2015 UTC,Greg Maddux Mk. II's xFIP was 3.92 last year. That's not sparkling at all. His ERA is reflecting that now.
CHICubs,38d84w,Doogolas33,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:41:10 2015 UTC,"You're looking at this through a very small lens. xFIP is one of basically every metric we have to project pitching where Hendricks blows Wood away. This year, Hendricks has a 3.66 xFIP. Again that's just one metric, but the bigger point should be that it's not at all ridiculous to feel hopeful about Hendricks' chances of being a solid middle of the rotation pitcher."
CHICubs,38d84w,Mrpenguindeluxe,-1,Wed Jun 3 17:44:40 2015 UTC,"This year, Hendricks has a 3.66 xFIP   Travis Wood's xFIP this year is 3.83"
CHICubs,38d84w,Doogolas33,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:04:02 2015 UTC,"Wood's career xFIP is 4.44 and based off of what we know it's not at all sustainable. Now will you stop being insufferable? A statistic is not gonna be 100% telling 100% of the time. Edwin Jackson has randomly solid peripherals. There are outliers, but generally speaking statistics are the best method we have for projecting future performance."
CHICubs,38eu0d,jeremytm,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:16:03 2015 UTC,"I've been saving still images from webcam atop The Cubby Bear every 30 minutes for the past week or so.  I put them together into a single timelapse video just for giggles and thought I'd share.  Although the camera shakes a bit (and got covered by rain a few days ago), I thought it turned out kind of neat.  I'm going to continue saving images and will try to put together some longer videos in the future."
CHICubs,38eu0d,voidecho,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:16:08 2015 UTC,I liked it but thought it was going to show construction updates.

CHICubs,38h6g0,tbv93,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:43:07 2015 UTC,"I think in that case, the Cubs would choose to go with a strong defensive catcher and not worry too much about offense there.  That would leave the LF/DH rotation being some combination of Bryant/Schwarber/Vogelbach/McKinney."

CHICubs,38h6g0,THEriot2,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:31:40 2015 UTC,Tiny backup to backup middle infielders -- he fits the bill.
CHICubs,38efdj,Tjagra,5,Wed Jun 3 17:51:43 2015 UTC,"It could go any number of ways IMO. If the cubs don't have a good chance at the playoffs by mid August, then he gets the call up even if he is mediocre. If he is good, I think late July would be a good chance to test him. If one of our pitchers get injured, he could also see a call up then."
CHICubs,38efdj,Jhacker111,2,Wed Jun 3 17:57:16 2015 UTC,"I think it's a sign he'll be here soon. I would expect him And Edwards to take over probably Wood and Jackson's spots before the end of the year since those two have basically been black holes. Hopefully by the end of the year we just have Ramirez, Rondon, Strop, Edwards, Rosscup, Black, Grimm, and Russell. I don't really see a weak spot in there."
CHICubs,38efdj,bibbers01,2,Wed Jun 3 18:03:56 2015 UTC,Rosscup hasn't been great so far :/
CHICubs,38efdj,bibbers01,2,Wed Jun 3 18:05:31 2015 UTC,"Not against righties, but he's destroyed lefties. Honestly I'm more worried about Russell than Rosscup. Hopefully we trade for an SP upgrade over Wada, because I feel like Wada would be awesome coming out of the BP."
CHICubs,38efdj,SwedishLovePump,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:10:27 2015 UTC,I don't think Black was ever going to be a starter. I always liked him better in the pen.
CHICubs,38efdj,Doogolas33,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:06:47 2015 UTC,That means they want him to help sooner. But I would put money on him moving back to a starting role after a year in the pen.
CHICubs,38efdj,NLRD,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:38:46 2015 UTC,I can certainly see Black and Edwards pitching out of the Cubs bullpen this year.  I like it.

CHICubs,38fzxw,frakking-anustart,3,Wed Jun 3 23:51:22 2015 UTC,"As much as I love Mark Grace while growing up, I have to agree. He was very good but not good enough to have his number retired."
CHICubs,38fzxw,HislersHero,2,Thu Jun 4 00:20:37 2015 UTC,"Grace was my favorite Cub growing up, and I agree."
CHICubs,38fzxw,penguinopph,3,Thu Jun 4 03:10:21 2015 UTC,They'd have to toss Fontenot and Garza up there too.  So no.
CHICubs,38fzxw,KCchemist,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:12:37 2015 UTC,Are you really comparing the hit leader of the 90s to Mike Fontenot? Grace got HOF votes
CHICubs,38fzxw,KCchemist,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:29:54 2015 UTC,Comparing in the sense that they wore #17 long after the Cubs had the opportunity to retire it for Grace.  By no means comparing their skill sets.
CHICubs,38fzxw,PodForThought,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:10:53 2015 UTC,I think every generation has a player who defines their team and Grace did that for the Cubs then. I think he deserves some kind of recognition as one of the best Cubs of all time
CHICubs,38fzxw,KCchemist,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:31:36 2015 UTC,"It does seem odd that a team 100+ years old has 6 retired numbers.  Albeit, we don't have a rich history of success, but I would have expected Grace and Dawson (who is in the HOF) to be up on the flag pole."
CHICubs,38fzxw,PaletoBayPlayboy,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:11:56 2015 UTC,"I love Gracie but, he probably doesn't see his number retired with the Cubs. His ring is on his Dback finger..."

CHICubs,38aoil,BobC813,0,Wed Jun 3 00:57:40 2015 UTC,"Can I just say that no Cards fans I know gave a fuck about this? Please, do not judge all of us based on twitter! If it happened against us, I'd never try to downplay it but nobody here cared about this.   It's like the media blew up BFIB so hard that everybody hates us just so they could play off it for more views.  EDIT: Also, I realize you're probably joking but this is definitely getting thrown around a lot. And I guess I should take my own advice and not listen to the Cubs fans make a big deal about it, but still. I've heard of nobody caring about this."
CHICubs,38aoil,burts_beads,14,Wed Jun 3 01:57:59 2015 UTC,The Cardinals broadcasters mentioned it during their broadcast. It wasn't even their game!
CHICubs,38aoil,draxxis,2,Wed Jun 3 06:20:06 2015 UTC,We understand its not all cards fans but the bfib is pretty fucking great.  Even my good friends who are cards fans love it.  Its just like us Chicago people bash the bandwagon hockey fans who know nothing about the sport

CHICubs,38aoil,Sparx7,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:34:43 2015 UTC,"(I know this is joking, but just thought these stats were interesting)  .339 OBP last year with 35 walks for a 6.1 percent walk rate, not that rare historically.  His walk rate was actually trending up since his slump year before the current slump took it back down to 4.7 percent, which is truly bad.  But if he can maintain 6.1 percent, that's under the league average of ~8 percent, certainly, but not Ben Revere territory. It's not awful. Also, there's plenty of signs that Castro's a patient hitter, regardless of his reputation.   His strikeout rate is currently 17.7 percent, which is fairly low. He's still seeing close to the same number of pitches per plate appearance (3.79, good for 42nd overall in the NL), but swinging at more of them, and he's seeing more 3-ball counts, so I don't think the problem is patience.  The bigger issue, as we all know, is the ground outs -- Castro's ground/air out ratio soared from 1.2 (2014) to 1.8 (2015).  Also, you don't need stats to see him rolling over on pretty much every ball he puts in play.  Maybe Manny's advice was the best -- he shouldn't be afraid to hit some doubles. I do think this is a mental issue for Starlin. It probably doesn't help that newspapers and Cubs fans are calling for him to be traded every 5 seconds and he gets an unfair amount of flack wherever he goes -- even on the damn Cardinals broadcast when he isn't playing.  I think his relaxed HR from the other night kind of shows that the pressure's getting to him; remove the pressure, and you might get the perennial All-Star shortstop back.  But I'm also mostly talking out of my ass, so take that with a grain of salt."
CHICubs,38dr38,jcftw61,4,Wed Jun 3 15:35:57 2015 UTC,"Not to be pessimistic, but I don't think he makes it.  He's basically played five full seasons (790/5=158 games) and he's averaged 180 hits per year.  He needs 2,100 more hits.  2,100/180 = 11.7 more years.  He'd have to average 180 hits per year until he's 37 years old.    If he does get more patient at the plate, that should turn into more walks which may actually hurt his hits number.  Even 200 hits per year would be another 10.5 years, so 35-36 years old.    Wish him all the luck and hope he does it, but wouldn't put money on it without great odds."
CHICubs,38dr38,voidecho,2,Wed Jun 3 17:42:27 2015 UTC,"If he stops hacking at everything and protects the plate a little more, then yeah, he can do it, just needs to be more patient at the plate."
CHICubs,38dr38,killerj95,2,Wed Jun 3 15:57:14 2015 UTC,"With a little more plate discipline yea I think so. Right now he seems very unsure with his swings. They look more protective than pure hacks at a ball, evident in the fact that he only had 3 2Bs last month. Once he gets into a groove it'll be fine."
CHICubs,38dr38,Jollyman21,2,Wed Jun 3 16:22:26 2015 UTC,"looks like they tried to ""fix"" his swing again instead of letting him be himself like last year"
CHICubs,38dr38,Sparx7,2,Wed Jun 3 17:16:16 2015 UTC,Yeah. He's coming out of his May awfulness. He'll be ok.
