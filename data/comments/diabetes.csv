That said, I started getting nasty skin reactions from my CGM -- I think they were an allergic reaction to the adhesive on the overtape Medtronic supplies -- and since it was taking 1-2 months for the blistered/swollen/seeping mess to heal, I did start to run out of space for a while.  But quitting the Metronic tape seems to have solved that problem.

After the carb load you probably spiked high. Did you test at your peak after the oreos? Your first phase insulin response didn't arrive but the second phase over-corrected - and down you went.  I used to get those in my first year, rarely since then. The way I stopped them was to stop going high in the first place.

diabetes,3e31os,Toomuchgamin,6,Tue Jul 21 17:32:05 2015 UTC,Get a meter and test after various meals.  That's the only way to know for sure.  I'm in a similar range and can generally handle up to around 30g of carbs without issue.  40-50 puts me in a borderline range of 140 which I don't like.  75+ puts me in an unsafe range.
diabetes,3e31os,reduser80,4,Tue Jul 21 17:57:04 2015 UTC,"Diabetes is a condition where the body has trouble processing carbohydrates correctly. This is the thing that should underpin every diabetic diet. The degree to which the glucose metabolism is impaired varies a lot between individuals, so the best thing to do is get a glucose meter, count all the carbs you eat and do a lot of testing to work out what your personal carbohydrate tolerances are (keep to the amounts of carbs that mean you stay under 150mg/dl or 8.5mmol/l). Both sugar and starch count for these purposes, but fibre does not.  You can also do the ""quick fix"" option which is to go very low carb/keto, as this should come in under the limits of almost everyone that is not actually type 1/requiring insulin. That's not to say it's an easy option, but it takes the least amount of personalisation.  Eat as many calories as you need, but keep your carb intake low enough to avoid spikes. Again, meter is essential - not having one is like trying to drive with your eyes closed.  Side note: Did you get your hba1c checked? Oral glucose tolerance test? If you were diagnosed from only fasting blood sugar that sounds like pretty shoddy care. Also, if you're younger than 45 and in good shape otherwise, request testing for t1 antibodies to rule out LADA. If you have LADA, the initial treatment is the same (diet mostly) but you're dealing with a different animal than t2."
diabetes,3e31os,derphamster,8,Tue Jul 21 20:36:57 2015 UTC,The best thing you can do is to eat and test.  Different foods affect people in different ways.  We had a big thread a while back of people listing foods that didn't usually significantly affect their blood sugar.    It's all dependent on the person.
diabetes,3e31os,canoxen,2,Tue Jul 21 17:16:05 2015 UTC,This is key to knowing your own body.
diabetes,3e31os,usewhippedcream,3,Tue Jul 21 19:43:09 2015 UTC,"The generally accepted formula is to stay away from most carbs and eat diet rich in veggies, low-fat proteins, and whole grains.   Also you need to exercise regularly.  Exercise will increase your body's insulin sensitivity and allow you to use the insulin you have more effectively."
diabetes,3e31os,uid_0,3,Tue Jul 21 16:15:01 2015 UTC,"I work out 4x per week.  2 days lifting 2 days HIIT, and usually a pickup day of some type of cardio, like cycling or swimming.  That should be enough, right?"
diabetes,3e31os,transientDCer,3,Tue Jul 21 17:07:51 2015 UTC,Yes that is plenty. You're doing more than most diabetics.
diabetes,3e31os,StopSixRefugee,3,Tue Jul 21 20:36:45 2015 UTC,"Everyone's different but there are a few simple truths you can rely on.  Carbs are bad for blood sugar.  But you don't have to eliminate them necessarily.  You can have some.  Not all carbs are created equal and you still need to get fiber.  Testing with a glucometer can help you determine what you can eat and what you shouldn't eat.   I'd read the labels on your sports drinks for sure.  Some of them have as many simple carbs as soda does.  Losing body fat will help.  Moderate cardio after meals has been shown to drop post-meal blood sugar quite a bit.  I've been rehabbing an injury and have just now been able to start doing moderate cardio again.  For me it drops post-meal glucose about 1.5 mg/dl per minute on average.  I've noticed that exercising when I haven't eaten lowers blood sugar but not nearly as much.    I've read conflicting things about strength workouts.  You're going to have to do your own research and your own testing to find out what works for you.    I'm not sure that one fasting BG test is enough to diagnose you.  I'd ask your doctor for an A1C test and a 2 hour glucose test.  Any fasting blood glucose over 100 is a red flag, which means more tests should be done.  Often primary care doctors aren't very good with diabetes, which I find strange since the condition is so prevalent.    So you need to find out where you're at.  If it's found that you are prediabetic (which in my opinion is saying you have diabetes but it's just not ""bad"" yet), call your insurance company to see what glucometers they cover.  Then get one and use the shit out of it. Get your doctor to prescribe as many strips as possible.  They're expensive.  You can often find strips on Amazon for about the same amount as your copay so if you need more you can get them.  After you've figured out what you can and can't eat and how different types of activity affect your blood glucose, you can cut back on your testing.  But you need to do a lot of it at first.  It's the only way to know what works for you and what doesn't.  Finally, if it's true you're diabetic I'd look for other weight lifters who are diabetic and get ideas from them.  Worst case, you may have to lose some muscle mass.  Diabetes is a serious disease and you're going to have to sacrifice some things in order to manage it.  I hope you don't have to sacrifice your strength training but if you do, you do.  You don't want to sacrifice your eyesight or have neuropathy instead.  You don't want to increase your risk of stroke or heart attack just to have bigger muscles.  It's not worth it.  The risks are very real."
diabetes,3e31os,Guairdean,2,Tue Jul 21 21:04:54 2015 UTC,"First, if you lift weights and work out a lot, you'll show more pounds on the scale. Scales don't tell you what percentage of fat you're carrying, they only tell how much you weigh. If you're a bit fluffy, some weight loss might be good. If you're lean and solid, keep going. A friend (former Navy Seal, MMA fighter, and all around healthy guy) told me that losing weight is simple. Burn more calories than you eat. Your doctor should have run an A1C test. Find that number and you'll get a better idea of what's happening. Give us a few more details and we can offer more suggestions."

diabetes,3e31os,TheOneKnownAsMonk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:14:48 2015 UTC,"One thing I can add for you is you need to differentiate from complex carbs and simple carbs. Simple carbs include chocolate, soda, juices and cause sugar levels to sky rocket. You need to have a consistent carb diet not a low carb diet as carbs are needed for energy. Most fruits are fine in moderation (1-2 a day). The internet is a great resource but when you know nothing about the topic it becomes difficult to differentiate knowledgeable advice and people just talking out of their ass. Talk to a nutritionist if you can ( your doctor can refer you). They can set you up with a plan and give you proper advise. Most of all good luck.  Edit: I meant registered dietitian."
diabetes,3e31os,pileobunnies,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:40:24 2015 UTC,"To help figure out the simple vs. complex carbs, you can look at the GI rating of various foods.  The glycemic index is designed for this sort of thing."
diabetes,3e31os,derphamster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:46:38 2015 UTC,"You're right, but I find that there is little difference when it comes to different starchy carbs - it's mostly about how much fat it's paired with. For example white bread and wholemeal bread spike my blood sugar very similarly. Add a generous helping of butter to the bread though and the spike will be slightly lower but last much longer so I don't get hungry for a few hours.  Simple sugars do have a noticeably faster and higher spike than starches though."
diabetes,3e31os,StopSixRefugee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:40:15 2015 UTC,"Yep when you consume fat and protein it slows down digestion, delaying the peak.

diabetes,3e31os,drpeterfoster,-1,Tue Jul 21 21:20:40 2015 UTC,"to echo what has been already posted, eat a diet rich in veggies, fat & protein, and whole grains.  Exercise regularly (or continue to), and don't forget regular cardio (or leg day).  Start learning now about glycemic index-- for a prediabetic it is arguably more important than carb ratios or calorie counting.  For example, a breakfast apple, sometimes referred to as evil-sugar-fruit, hits your system far more gently than a bowl of even the healthiest, crunchiest, whole-est grain cereal.  I have a T1D child, and cereals have been banned from our home.  For our T1D, an egg with a bowl of fruit is perfect in the morning. As far as diet fads go, do whatever you feel works best.  The reason you see so much conflicting information is because there is no ""right"" answer for everyone.  Bodies are different.  Metabolisms are different.  Make your own decisions based on your OWN data... exercise routine, caloric needs, BMI, cardiovascular health, A1C, etc.  If those metrics indicate you need to make additional changes, then don't be afraid to do so.  Bodies are complicated, and discovering that something is ineffective is not failure, it's part of the process.  GL.  TLDR:  Exercise and eat a good, balanced diet.  Learn about glycemic index and treat your pancreas nicely.  Balance efforts to reduce BMI (if needed) with eating as much as your body needs.  Edit: ""fat & protein"", not ""low-fat protein"""

That is not ""mild"" diabetes.  But I'm down to 4.9% now and if I have another similar A1C result I'll be done with meds.  It can be done.  Lots of people have done it, and it's just a consequence of doing the things you're doing right now."
diabetes,3dysdq,JSL82,3,Tue Jul 21 21:36:17 2015 UTC,"I don't get pain in my stomach at all. I'm currently on insulin and have very poor control. A1C is 10 as of a few weeks ago. I know that metformin was so hard for me to stomach. I was on victoza briefly but I got way to sick on that.   It's a struggle to manage but if you're not to bad yet, I'd tell you to keep trying. Don't get discouraged. Keep working at it and eventually you'll get it under control. Don't let it get worse like I did."
diabetes,3dysdq,mehhemm,2,Mon Jul 20 17:21:08 2015 UTC,The metformin definitely tears me up more than anything. I know it's worse if I have a lot of carbs though.   The stomach pain I had was excruciating. Not even my gallbladder failure hurt that bad. I finally convinced a doctor that it was unbearable when I told him that I thought about gutting myself.   I guess it's my bodies way of keeping me in check?

diabetes,3dysdq,A_Single_AID,4,Tue Jul 21 05:15:07 2015 UTC,"I know that feeling OP. Not quite to your extent, but in May I had a few weeks where I was extremely depressed and fearful. Basically, I was thinking about how it was so unfair that tons of extremely obese people around me were non-diabetic, yet I had gotten this disease at age 23 and not being that obese (BMI was almost 40 - how high is too high? 50? 60? Unable to step out of bed?). It got even worse when my vision suddenly deteriorated, which I thought was an early sign of blindness - particularly because this was a week after I started eating better and exercising more. In addition, I started noticing tingly parts on my feet a lot more. WTF? I'm making myself worse by living better?  But a few doctor's visits later, I felt a lot better. I have been steadily losing 2 lbs per week, and already feel a significant difference. The opthamologist said my eyes were fine, and the temporary lens swelling will go away eventually (it's been about 8 weeks... I'll get worried at 12). And my foot issue is not neuropathy, but compressed nerves that will start signaling when I put too much pressure on my feet. Ever since I got my meter, I have never seen myself over 100 in the morning, and very rarely do I find myself over 140 after an hour. And this is without medicine or insulin, which I consider a blessing. At this point I no longer expect serious complications before old age, and am much more committed to good health. I'm not perfect - still eat sweets quite a bit, and smoke lightly - but I'm getting better and looking toward the future. I hope you do too OP.   Sorry I can't actually answer your questions, haha. I do feel chest pain occasionally, but I don't think that it's related to my blood sugar - rather, it is a bit of reflux that I probably brought upon myself, combined with a sinus issue. Currently I am taking ranitidine and fluticasone, and the worst of it seems to have gone away. You might want to look into those."
diabetes,3dysdq,alan_s,4,Mon Jul 20 18:11:36 2015 UTC,"Sorry to be that guy, but a BMI of 40 is too high. Don't compare yourself to the people who are even more obese. A normal BMI is less than 25.

I'll kick that once I feel more in control of my eating though.   I guess the hardest part of accepting it happening to me was that my husband and I always assumed it would be him. Both of his parents are diabetic and we had him checked regularly. He's overweight but his last physical showed he's healthy as can be. Everything is perfect! I've seen the man demolish a box of twinkies! I don't expect him to diet with me because it's his choice. And I can't expect everyone to conform to my way just to make it easier. I need the power to do it on my own. So when he orders a burger and fries I get chicken salad. When he eats cheesecake I have cucumbers with cheese.   If I stay away from sweets until August 4th I'm getting a piece of birthday cake as a treat.
diabetes,3dysdq,DarkEthereal,5,Mon Jul 20 18:26:21 2015 UTC,I made a promise at that point to take care of myself for my husband. I can't see him go through that again. I've been taking my meds regularly and I love the victoza. I don't get hungry and I eat less when I do eat. It's like chantix for eating. Haha. I've already lost seven pounds. I cut out bread and pasta and potatoes almost entirely. I haven't had sweets in longer than ever before.    That is an excellent start.  This may help you improve on it: Getting Started
diabetes,3dysdq,FruitPlatter,2,Mon Jul 20 21:50:37 2015 UTC,"Like you my doctor handed me Metformin and saw me three months later! WTF, right? I'm also struggling with my diet, mostly low-carb but for some reason in my middle age I have developed a thing for potato chips, chips, any chips, really. But really I'm here to say I also get bad, bad stomach pain, so bad that at one point recently I experienced the fascinatingly boring world of ""non-emergency"" emergency medicine at a nearby hospital. It kind of felt like I had eaten a bunch of rocks and my intestines were trying to grind them up, so a bloted, constant low-level ache happens. I'm gallbladder free, so I knew it wasn't that, and everything was ""inconclusive"", but I have my guesses. I had IBS before the gallbladder came out, but not having one can actually cause IBS. My gastroenterologist put me on a FODMAPS diet after 18 gallons of blood samples and a colonoscopy showed I was neither infested with a parasite nor have celiac. After trying FODMAPS I discovered I have certain food sensitivities that I have to watch out for.  These include the dreaded gluten, onions, garlic and broccoli. I have a definite threshold, so let's say if I have a hotdog with a bun and later eat a piece of pizza, I am likely to be in some discomfort later on. I also suspect that the episode that sent me to the hospital involved a burst ovarian cyst co-mingled with a bad IBS episode - the pain was next level like a gallbladder attack combined with rock-stomach, ugh, such a bad night that one was.  You may want to see if cysts could be the culprit, in addition to exploring the many, excitingly vague facets of IBS to pinpoint what may be causing your abdominal issues. Good luck!

diabetes,3dz68l,hexnic,14,Mon Jul 20 18:43:58 2015 UTC,"How old are you? How long have you been diabetic? What has your control been like in the past?  I'm really torn on things like this. As a diabetic I'm 100% in favour of the ""it's my body, my disease, pissoff and let me manage it"" style. But as a parent I can't even imagine how I would react if that happened to my kids. Guaranteed she's terrified that you're going to die and parents will do weird things when that happens. I'm sure the parents of T1s here will have some insight.  I'm going to assume you're teenish aged given that you're on reddit but have parents watching. In that case you're going to have to get that independence the same way you get the rest of your independence (like borrowing the car, etc).  Be patient while prove that you're reliable and capable. Test regularly and keep logs so you can show that you're on top of things. Make sure she knows that you know how to notice and respond bad BGs. But serious sneak attack lows happen -- it doesn't take much searching around this sub to see that it happens to all of us.  For going to your friend's place the best I can recommend without knowing more is to somehow guarantee that you'll test often and respond appropriately to those tests.  Do you have a CGM? maybe something like a dexcom share where you can give your parents a view into your real time BG would help (then again, maybe you don't want them to have that (but if that's the case then think about why that is (argument (counter argument (counter counter argument (....)))))"

diabetes,3dysp7,diabeetusthrowaway2,9,Mon Jul 20 17:10:24 2015 UTC,Type 1 here.  I don't really have good advice to offer other than get out of retail as soon as you can.   I too had to take a job in that industry and took the next job I could find that was somewhere else.  Yes your need to test and treat is covered by the ADA.

Worried about dealing with lows in my new (and hopefully short-term) retail career.   Would you mind defining ""eating right"" in terms of carbs at meals please?"

diabetes,3dysp7,alan_s,4,Mon Jul 20 23:55:56 2015 UTC,"Wow! Presumably you have been following traditional generic advice from a dietician.  I'll close with a link to a technique I used to discover the correct carb loads for my meals. I found those to be different morning, noon and night. However, as you are using 5 units at meals (are you also on a basal?) I add a word of caution. This technique works, but make small changes each time because you do not want to go from hyper to hypo. You may find you need to reduce or totally eliminate the insulin (in consultation with your doctor) as you cut the carbs.   If you can do that, lows induced by exogenous insulin will no longer be a concern.  Here is the link: Test, Review, Adjust."
diabetes,3dysp7,mmccullen,4,Tue Jul 21 01:37:24 2015 UTC,"I'm worried about this happening while I'm working in a retail environment and not being allowed to treat it or messing something up while I'm hypo and feeling like crap and getting in trouble.   It is illegal under the ADA to deny you reasonable accommodations to manage your diabetes at work. Once you are hired you can discuss with your management what you require (time to test BG, place to inject that's not the bathroom, etc. etc.). Don't bring this up prior to being hired."
diabetes,3dysp7,intelnavi,4,Mon Jul 20 17:21:57 2015 UTC,Record everything when you do this.
diabetes,3dysp7,ew73,4,Mon Jul 20 21:14:11 2015 UTC,"Diabetes is considered a disability under the ADA (Americans with Disability Act).  Presuming you're in the US, you can ask for and receieve ""reasonable accommodation"" to manage your disability.  What that means for diabetics is you can have a brief break to test your blood sugar, treat a low, go to the bathroom, take insulin, etc.  You can also have a regular meal break, assuming your shift is long enough that you'd otherwise be entitled to such a thing.    The key is ""reasonable"" when speaking about accommodations under the law.  What you ask has to be within reason for the scope of your job and the employer's business.  What you ask for should not place an undue burden on the business's operation.  A 15 minute break to eat some god damned sugar isn't, but taking the day off because you're low is.    Most employers understand this, and are familiar with the law.  Most employers of a reasonable size have encountered diabetic employees before and know what you're going to ask for.    As a final bit of advice:  There's no reason to disclose diabetes during the interview / application process.  Read the application form carefully -- there's a box there that says something along the lines of [ ] I am able to perform all the duties of the job with reasonable accommodation..  Check it.   My general practice has been to inform HR after hiring that I'm diabetic, provide them emergency contact info and a very basic run-down of what I need, and repeatedly ""If I'm not responsive, call an ambulance.""  I do the same with my immediate supervisor."

If I ""zone out"" or do what my wife calls my ""drunk walk"", they sit me down and make me test my sugar. If I'm too low, they force me to take my glucose pills. I'm too high? Novalog.   Don't worry about retail because of what other people may say. Each individual store is different. The store will take on the personality of the manager. Remember, you're covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act if you're in the USA. Reasonable accommodations must be made."
diabetes,3dysp7,notmyrealemail,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:49:23 2015 UTC,"Talk to your doctor about cutting back the insulin again. daily/weekly lows even are not good and mostly avoidable. If you have a very regular schedule currently of your diet (how many carbs your eating each meal) and exercise (time of day) you should be able to nail down when you're getting too much insulin. Retail is also going to keep you on your feet all day, you may have to adjust once again after starting the job.  I worked retail for 10+ years while type 1. It's not as scary as you think, but you'll need to be diligent and let those around you know what's going on in case of a low, testing needs, etc. You don't have to share a ton with all the employees, but make sure management (and shift leaders) are aware in case you need assistance while with customers. Like others have said, you're protected under the ADA in the US. Don't disclose you are diabetic until after hiring. Although statutes vary state to state, breaks are pretty regulated and if an employer is not giving them out properly you need to make a big stink. I've worked multiple restaurants and retailers and never had any issues with employers about this.  Communicate with your superiors, it's not a big ordeal. Talk to them before something does happen so that you both can set expectations in a ""what if"" scenario. I actually had a coworker (who is now a dear friend) notice I was going low before I even felt it. She saw my demeanor change and grabbed a bag of M&Ms from our candy box, I tested at 49 with no symptoms that I could feel. Don't feel obligated to over explain, but know that if you have good employers they will worry about your wellbeing and helping them understand is key.  I was always able to keep my supplies with my personal belongings without issue. I never worked in a ""big-box"" retailer, but if the place is huge you may think about carrying your testing supplies on you if possible. I can only imagine getting stopped a dozen times on my way to a break room to treat a low would be the ultimate frustration."

Keep a box in your locker (or whatever personal space they give you) and have a couple in your pocket all the time. Make sure your boss knows that you're diabetic and that you may need to occasionally take a minute to deal with medical problems.

Her co-workers will recognize if she is starting to go low or if something is wrong, and make sure she gets her snack and a few minutes to recover.  The hardest part for her is the irregular hours - sometimes she works in the morning, sometimes closes at night. This throws a wrench into any attempt to get on a regular pattern for her diet.   A lot will depend on the manager, as others have said, it's none of their business during the interview, but you should discuss it after you start. If for no other reason than so they know what to do if you go super low or something, and so they will better follow the ADA."

I always try to bring a low carb meal so I'm not taking large amounts of insulin, therefore making it easier to keep a steady BG throughout my shift.  Always have water with you.  One of my managers got mad at me because I wasn't in my department because I needed water to help with thirst from a high.  She told me to ""plan for those things"" yeah like I freakin' planned for this lady.  I had water with me but drank it all DUH.  I worked with another T1 and she had a little emergency chocolate bag she kept up near the registers which might be something you could do?  Another thing I've noticed is depending on how busy the store is, and how much walking/lifting you're doing, sometimes I do go low for exertion but usually I'm not moving around that much.

If I was looking at a small electronic device, that's my insulin pump, not a cell phone. If my blood sugar is low, I NEED to go take a break (10-20 minutes) right now, or take an extra 5 on my break to be sure it's stabilized. It's illegal for an employer to deny you the ability to care for your diabetes on the job, not only that but it could reflect badly on them. Just don't abuse it (not only will that probably get you fired, but it will create stigma and backlash for any other diabetes), keep an eyes on your sugar and insulin levels, and how you're feeling, and you'll be fine."

In my experience, being upfront with your condition helps. Once you're hired, let your superiors know that you're a type 1 diabetic (show them your equipment, needles, jelly beans, BG kit if necessary - I did that because they seemed to think it impossible for a happy healthy-looking person to be diabetic), and what happens when you get hypos. Most importantly, let them know that you NEED to treat your low, and what happens consequently if you don't. I find that people are generally more relenting when they realise it is an ugly life or death situation, ha.  If it ever gets too busy when a hypo hits and you can't physically get away to take a break even though you've gotten permission (ie. you feel bad leaving your other struggling colleagues in the lurch), perhaps you can keep a small pack of candy/glucose on hand for such emergencies? I've literally had the experience of ducking beneath the counter and out of sight to shovel gummy bears into my mouth, because I couldn't get from behind the counter for a break.

No reason that would be worse for diabetics than plain flour.   Flour itself can be a problem though, depending on how much of it is eaten.

It's time for a new endo and a second opinion. Here's some good information on A1C levels.

The answer is: ""Doctor."" Go to a different endo and get a second opinion. People have been indoctrinated to believe that MD after a name imparts some form of infallibility. It doesn't. I've been working for, and with, doctors for the past 25 years. There are serious gaps in their knowledge. The good ones realize this and welcome another viewpoint. Beware the ones that don't. You are responsible for your health. Learn to take care of yourself (you've made a remarkable start by adhering to a quality diet and course of exercise), now you need to learn about the medical side. Research (google and a lot of fact checking) will become a close friend. Ask questions here whenever you aren't sure of something, we'll do our best."
diabetes,3dzpsn,derphamster,5,Tue Jul 21 02:16:54 2015 UTC,"Regarding your 5.5% a1c: Do you go hypo frequently? Do you have a lot of spikes and crashes? If yes, your a1c possibly reflects the fact that you're too low a lot. On the other hand if you go hypo once a week or less, and dont have much of a BG roller coaster your a1c is fine, and probably due to you being in honeymoon.   Doctors get antsy about low a1c levels because the number of patients they see that are actually in good control is very small (5% of t1 get lower than 6.5% a1c in most parts of the UK - you can find these figures online because they are part of health board targets). This means that they automatically think that patients have poor control and poor control + low a1c = high risk of hypo and hospitalisation/death for the patient. However, take meter logs with you to show the doctor that you're just honeymooning and not going hypo all the time. My doctors also express concern about my low a1c (5.5% as well) until I show them my logs. Below 6.5% is where you want to stay a1c wise.   Now, your ""borderline"" antibody tests. Normal people do not test positive at all for autoantibodies. A borderline result is a positive result, but may not mean that you actually have the condition (which is why they put a threshold on it for diagnosis). It may be a temporary thing or it may be a very mild effect. One thing with diabetes antibodies though is that the more antibodies you have the faster the diabetes progresses. If you have few antibodies, you could have a slow form of type 1 (like LADA, though this shows up more in 30s +). If that's the case it will allow your pancreas to output more insulin than may be expected of a typical t1. You are doing all the right things - cutting carbs, taking insulin for what you eat, exercising etc, and this will contribute to your great control. The less your pancreas struggles to output its own insulin the less it gets noticed by the immune system, and this may contribute to a low antibody level.   There's no harm in getting tested for MODY. I doubt it will come back positive - from what you say you seem like a t1 (especially with celiac disease) but I'm not a doctor. You can also request a second opinion from a different endo, but I'd wait until the MODY results are in. Different types of MODY are treated in different ways so there's no good advice unless you have a positive test result.   If you're underweight, look at bulking up with low carb protein shakes."
diabetes,3dzpsn,derphamster,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:32:35 2015 UTC,I rarely have a hypo or high BG unless I do something blatant enough to allow it to happen like not count my carbs correctly or get an incorrect dose.   He claimed I have borderline antibodies for type 1.
diabetes,3dzpsn,derphamster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:16:22 2015 UTC,"In that case don't worry about your a1c, it's fine (more than fine actually, 5.5% is great). It will probably go up over time, but try to keep it under 6.5%.   You can always request the t1 antibodies be run again if your MODY test doesn't turn anything up. It's well known that antibody levels can fluctuate (and there was a thread recently from someone who had tested negative for antibodies despite testing positive in the past), however while you're in honeymoon you may still have very low antibody levels. The time to re-test should be when you start to notice numbers creeping up and/or having to use more insulin.   Be really careful if the doctor takes you off insulin and wants to put you on t2 meds. Some t2 meds that make your pancreas produce more insulin can lead to faster beta cell destruction in autoimmune types. I'd avoid those unless you definitely have MODY or t2. Even borderline antibody tests make t1 much more likely though, so I would just keep doing what you're doing with your carb counting and insulin until tests show otherwise. Insulin is a viable treatment for t2 as well, it's mostly avoided because people don't like injections and it's a hassle, but if you're happy on it you can make a good argument for staying on it (especially if you spike high without it at meal times) if that's what you'd rather do even if the doctor doubts your t1."

Cannot stress enough how important bringing a printout of your logs is in situations like this! If I was less sure of myself I would be following the doctor's ideas of dialing back on my insulin right now for no reason other than ""99% of patients can't be this controlled so you're probably not in the 1%"" (not his actual words)."

diabetes,3dzpsn,rockchick99,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:29:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't buy it though. 37 = an average blood glucose level of 6.2, and since I don't spike much higher than that outside of the few hours after meals, I'd have a waaaaay lower hba1c if I was dropping lower than 4 regularly.  My philosophy is that the doctors are there to give us information but they are not infallible and they are subject to assumptions about their patient populations based on all the other people they see. In the end it's my body and I have the ultimate say. I'd rather keep doing what I'm doing and keep my complication risk low than run high just to prove a point!"

I'm the same as you, HBA1C of 5.4, it takes effort but not loads and I don't muck up unless I make a blatant mistake. I don't take daytime basal whatsoever and my total daily insulin dose is about 1/5 of what it should be. This hasn't shifted in all the years I've had T1 (4 this year).   I get told that it's my honeymoon doing all the hard work not me, I get told I'm not a classic T1 and they're at the moment all doing a load of C-Peptide and genetic testing but you know what?, it'll all come back as expected. I have background insulin production, it'll always be there unless I start hammering the high carbs and yeah, it's really helping. But I'm still a T1, and not some new type that would make an Endio do a little wee of excitement over how they can write a case about me (which is what's gotten my Endio in a big flap recently).   Sometimes experts are just people that have read a fair bit, my Endio is not a T1 and always overreacts or won't accept the already sensible things I've already done to rectify any difficulties I have. For example at 5pm every day my blood sugars crash, no reason. It's not insulin, it's not what eaten/or not eaten, it's not exercise it's just my pancreas being a dick. I came to this conclusion myself, I went a week without taking my basal and tested. I went a week eating bigger lunches and tested, I went a week going ultra low carb and avoiding any bolus and tested. Instead of accepting the already controlled testing my Endio took me off all insulin for 3 FUCKING MONTHS. It felt terrible, and my numbers never went above 13mmol/l I started to piss a lot but never with detectible Ketones. He then made me starve myself every other day for 2 weeks. All to applease this idiots ego and confirm what I already knew. He still doesn't know why, and all he proved was that I have enough background insulin production to stop ketones forming. I already knew that. He finally asked me if my wife was poisoning me.   So I guess what I'm saying is that even if these people are experts it's not beyond them to say and ask you to do stupid crap that's wrong. You are the best doctor for you, the more you learn about your breed of diabetes. Don't think about the classification because it doesn't really mean anything, just manage it the best you can using the techniques that work best for you.

diabetes,3dynym,tommykw,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:07:10 2015 UTC,"I am pretty sure that all test strips which a pharmacy carries can be prescribed. The AccuChek mobile is quite popular here in the UK from what I have heard.   I suggest you contact the AccuChek care line and explain the problem. I would expect they can email you a PDF to print out which formally requests the exact test strips from your GP with their product number.   This is pretty standard whenever you obtain a new glucose meter - it will have a similar piece of paper included. You also can bolster your case by going to your local pharmacy(s) and asking the pharmacist whether they actually have the accuchek mobile cartridges in stock.  As far as I know, if they persist in refusing to prescribe the test strips of your choice you can make a complaint."
diabetes,3dynym,Sideburnt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:22:03 2015 UTC,"Yes I've actually seen it on a shelf at Boots!   The full story is that when I visited the GP, she couldn't find the test cassettes in her computer system, so I didn't get a prescription at the time. Then I went home and did some research online and found that they're not listed under Accu-Chek, but rather Roche, and I found the specific ""PIP Code"". I gave that info to my doctor but she still couldn't see it, so she said it's probably not covered by the Camden CCG. She's going to call them tomorrow to ask for a special exemption but told me not to hold my breath.  From reading online it seems that it's very common for these cassettes to be denied by various CCGs as they're twice the price of other strips. So I don't expect Camden CCG to be any different in that regard.  /u/derphamster has very helpfully pointed out that I can choose to go to another health trust. I can use the link you provided to the Accucheck care line to try to find out which CCG in London will give me a prescription (if any) and go from there. Thanks for your help!"

As soon as I remove the carbs (oats) the BG is fine so maybe i'm more sensitive to some types of carbs as I can have pastry and BG never shoot up."
diabetes,3dxjt6,alan_s,2,Tue Jul 21 00:59:59 2015 UTC,"My point was not that you cannot get protein from plants. It is that you cannot get it unencumbered with carbs.   What is the carb count of your breakfast smoothie? If you don't know, what is the recipe? Protein powders vary.   As soon as I remove the carbs (oats) the BG is fine    Maybe you're luckier than I.

I am not completely switched over, I still have the occasional steak or burger. I am slowly moving over completely. I have seen nothing but good results, my A1C went from 9.2 to 5.1 since I started my own diet.   Shopping is not that difficult, you basically stay in the produce department for 90% of your foods. There are a few foods i'll buy frozen either because there is no fresh alternative, or its something that I am going to freeze anyway. Buying none fresh foods is a little more time consuming, I pretty much never look at the nutritional information, only the ingredients."

So I was having a bad low and I was trying to hurry up and get dressed to go to this 'spring concert' thing that my 5 year old son was in.  I was gonna eat glucose tabs in the car to fix it, and while I was getting dressed I was fumbling (it's hard to get dressed with a low blood sugar), and somehow, I broke the button off my pants.    I didn't have another pair of clean khakis and I was freaking out cause I didn't want to be late, so my wife is like,  ""just zip them up and untuck your shirt, no one will be able to tell"".  I did, and it seemed like it was okay, so I left.  (In hindsight, a belt would have been a good idea too, but I didn't think of it at the time.)  Took care of the low in the car, and everything was okay.  Until I got to the school and as I was crossing the street, in front of about 20 little kids, my paints just DROP.  Everyone saw my cookie monster boxers and I saw a kid point at me.    So I grabbed my pants, ran to the car, and had to find a safety pin to fix them. I did, and when I went back into the hall I had to walk past all the people, half of whom saw 'the incident' and stared at me like I was a child molester or something.  If had just taken the time to take care of the low, it never would have happened."

Clearly my name is Julia.. but for the life of me I could not figure out the answer to his question. I thought long and hard before I said ""I just don't know the answer to that.""

So, despite us BARELY knowing each other, she drags me off to the bathroom so I can help her fix it. The clip wasn't being fixed so we were magyvering a way to secure this pump to her underwear using bobby pins and hair elastics WHEN the bride-to-be walks in on us.

A couple came out and I was sprawled out on a picnic table trying to get my sugars up with Beam. I called out to the RV'rs ""Excuse me but do you have anything to eat, i will pay for it, i am diabetic and experiencing hypoglycemic conditions. What came out of my mouth was not intelligible.  ""Lazy American, get a job and stop begging."" is what the woman said.  I believe they were Canadian with a french accent. I hold no grudge against these people as I must have looked like hell. They scampered back into the RV and drove off. I drank, peddled, and passed out. Repeated a few times. I remember I came-too lying on the ground still holding onto the handlebars, as if on the bike vertically yet in a horizontal position.  I managed to get to safety eventually but it was a long day. I am fairly certain that either it was divine intervention or the booze that saved my life.   Growing up I was the kind of person to succumb to spontaneity and it nearly cost me mortally in Yellowstone. lesson learned, if you think of going somewhere, prepare as if you are going twice as far and take twice as much (supplies that is)."

Also, he takes one dose of Levemir every day and his endo said that he will need to split that into two doses once he is out of his honeymoon phase. As far as I understand, your bg will be harder to control, I believe that is really the only difference."
diabetes,3dx340,ausper,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:56:22 2015 UTC,"I had a longer than expected honeymoon period, maybe for almost 5 years. It's now been 9 years since I was diagnosed and I notice little things have changed. I used to eat a 30g carb snack at bedtime without any coverage and wake up with a normal sugar. If I do that now, I wake up in the 200s. Same thing with exercise; I used to eat a big granola bar before a run to prevent a low, but now I have to eat something with protein instead of plain carbs which would make me high afterwards.   Like others have said, you'll probably have to adjust insulin ratios and you might find that certain foods make your blood sugar way higher than before. Your doctor will be able to help with the adjustments. I went from 1:15 to 1:5 but everyone is unique!"
diabetes,3dx340,pandayonce,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:01:21 2015 UTC,"It will be a gradual thing. But your BGs will be harder to control and you will have to take more insulin to keep it down, even if you are eating the same amount. Back when I was at the height of my honeymoon, I used to take like 3 units of short acting for breakfast. Now I take 6. I'm not sure what my I:C ratio was back then, but now I'm 1:12 - HOWEVER, my doctor still thinks I may still be producing a tiny bit of my own insulin.   Your A1C will start to go up once you fade out of the honeymoon faze, unless you are REALLY good at counting carbs and adjusting your ratio.   But yeah. 6 months in, you are definitely still honeymooning. Enjoy it while it lasts!"
diabetes,3dwjsm,leselect,8,Mon Jul 20 03:11:14 2015 UTC,"I think you need to decide if you really want to be with this guy. It sounds like there is a lot of incompatibility even without the diabetic stuff. Having diabetes doesn't limit you from doing anything physical (just Google type 1 athletes for example) so his inability to get off the couch was probably there before he was diagnosed. It wouldn't hurt to take some time and decide if he is worth it. Harsh words, I know, but ones that are true.  If you decide to remain with him you need to know there is little you can do to make him take responsibility for his own medical issues. It is something that he is going  to have to want to do. What can help, however,  is to start walking a bit in his shoes. Go out and get a glucose meter, carry it with you and start checking your own blood sugar as often as he should (waking, before each meal, two hours after each meal and before bed. And a 3am every week or so for good measure.) Record your data in a notebook that you carry. At the same time, start keeping a food log and record everything you eat before you eat it. Be sure to look up (and record) the carb count for each item.   The reason to do this is to show him what he should be doing rather than tell him or do it for him (i.e. make meals). If you test, hopefully he'll test. If you go out to eat and look up the carb count for your meal he'll hopefully be more likely to do it for his. When he asks you why you are doing all that when you don't have to, tell him it is because you love him and want to know what it is like to live with diabetes. It greatly helps to have a diabetic friend, someone who is going through the same issues. While you can't be that 100% of the way, your  efforts to try to understand by doing would IMHO help him. At a minimum it might give you an understanding of why we diabetics sometimes just get tired of dealing with it each and every day. So we slack off, guestimate carbs and bolus amounts and avoid getting HbA1c tests because we are ashamed and afraid of the inevitable high number. Thats what he's been doing. Your boyfriend doesn't need someone else telling him what he already knows in his heart what he needs to be doing. He needs someone to accompany him on the journey to a healthy HbA1c. That's your role, if you choose to remain with him."
diabetes,3dwjsm,allthegoo,2,Mon Jul 20 04:31:40 2015 UTC,"You're already being super supportive as it is, he's lucky to have you. There isn't a way to make him want to change, though. From the sounds of it your boyfriend is comfortable with not actively managing his diabetes and it may continue like that for a long time, maybe forever. Keep doing what you're doing for as long as you can bear, but be aware that it doesn't mean he's going to change.  One thing about getting diagnosed with type-1 diabetes that doesn't get addressed by the medical field is how oddly it can affect your psyche. It can be an extremely mentally fatiguing condition and is a huge adjustment. You might want to float the suggestion that your boyfriend see a mental health professional to talk things through with.  I wish you two the best of luck."
diabetes,3dwjsm,rawkamole,2,Mon Jul 20 10:53:29 2015 UTC,"I can't believe the Canadian government isn't funding the shit of it. I've suggested looking to ODSP since diabetes is recognized as a disability in Ontario. He does not have a pump but uses multiple daily injections of insulin.   Yeah, I can't find anyone in Ontario to help pay for the CGM. Not even 3rd party insurance. There was a study a while ago funded by the ON government that concluded that if your control is decent to begin with then the CGM doesn't help much so it's not worth it to them to pay for it. What the study doesn't show is the dramatic improvement in quality of life.  In terms of feeling forced to eat. Yeah, I get that. See if he's interested in a pump. It frees you from having to eat to a schedule and also allows you to eat a wider variety of foods. And in Ontario it's free. With the pump/CGM combo it's (at least for me) so much easier to not spend your time chasing highs and lows. And if you're not spending all of your mental energy chasing your BG then you can feel more normal and more free to do what normal people do."
diabetes,3dwjsm,badgerpapa,2,Mon Jul 20 14:19:39 2015 UTC,"With his issues around food, can you encourage him to visit a dietitian? A registered dietitian not a nutritionist.   You mentioned there are foods he has had to give up, the dietitian may be able to find ways to help him get back to eating what he wants and adjusting his insulin accordingly.   I'm sorry to hear he is no longer a touring musician, again, I am curious why this is? I 100% understand that the lack of stability etc would make managing t1 more challenging, but it should be do able. MDI is helpful but a pump would be even more so. There are plenty of people, famous ie Nick Jonas and the other guy... Brett someone?, and non famous who have irregular lifestyle patterns and manage.   I guess I say this because it sounds like someone has told him, or he has made the decision, that he should cut out foods and give up touring, when that doesn't need to be the case. I'm not suggesting it would be easy, but that it is possible to continue to live the life he wants even with t1 in the picture."

diabetes,3dv9jj,Effective_Placebo,3,Sun Jul 19 20:27:11 2015 UTC,"I don't grind teeth but I definitely find myself clenching my jaw when my BG is high and have to remind myself to relax it.   During the 6 month period of onset/rapid weight loss/super high BG before diagnosis I was clenching so much that combined with the dehydration I would get very achy and even have cramps.   I think it is likely more related as a stress reaction in general which is brought on by the physical discomfort of high BG rather than something specific to high BG, but what do I know?"
diabetes,3dv9jj,somebunnny,2,Sun Jul 19 20:39:26 2015 UTC,I clench and grind all the time. Neither doctor nor dentist has ever suggested it has anything to do with my diabetes. It didn't start until about 2 years after diagnosis and as far as I can tell I started as something stress related due to living in a shared house and has now become a habit I can't break.

diabetes,3dtrkl,Askull,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:21:45 2015 UTC,I can see that. When I was on levemir I always had a dawn phenomena that could be anywhere between 20-40 mg/dl.

diabetes,3dtrkl,slashrfnr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:02:15 2015 UTC,"Part of the problem with the Dawn phenomenon is that its hormonal, and there isn't an awful lot you can do about that. I think upping your basal is the right thing to do, but to check that, go a couple of days of no carbs at lunch.  Just make a salad, but make sure there are absolutely no carbs in it. Test your blood before, and then test a couple of hours later. If its higher, you need to up your lantus. Even if its slightly lower/similar, you're lantus is fine.  Its all about experimenting, but do small changes i.e increase by 1 unit for a couple of nights, and so on.  I see you've been t1 aince 1999, which is much longer than me, so apologies if I'm telling you stuff you already know. Some of it I learnt on the DAFNE diabetes course."

If you HbA1c (in 'old money') is over 8.0% and you say you have a fear of hypos I think you're eligible. Check it out. Pumps are awesome.   Otherwise, I'd check your levemir/ lantus dose. Might have to do a 0 carb dinner, bedtime check and 3am check (which is a real hassle). If you notice no difference between the bedtime and 3am, your background dose is probably good for the night time and it definitely is dawn phenomenon. If it's already up, then the dose probably isn't high enough."

So if going down in the morning, up at night doesn't work... try doing the opposite (but going to sleep at like 8 or something, just in case).  One thing I've noticed is eating too close to sleep can fudge with my numbers and cause dawn phenomenon."

diabetes,3dtrkl,aivets,0,Mon Jul 20 08:48:43 2015 UTC,"Maybe try a slightly higher basal overnight, or a small snack before bed with insulin for it so that there is active insulin in your system so you don't get a glucose dump in the morning.   Also have you tried testing during the night? It could be that you are going low and then rebounding back up.  Just a few things that have been suggested to me."

Went on pump without CGM in 2003 and was on that pump without CGM until 2007. Lowest A1C was 8.x% ONCE, the rest of the time, my A1C's were double digits. Fast forward to September of last year (2014) got an Animas Ping w/Dexcom G4. November 20th A1C: 7.2%, March 25th A1C: 6.9% A few things about me: While on manual daily injections, if I required less than a 5u bolus to correct or for carbs, I didn't take a shot. I found it near impossible to draw less than 5u. I always tested if I felt low or high. I always tested my fasting BG. I usually tested sometime after I ate. Now, I glance at my dexcom constantly. If my BG is above 125, I immediately test with my meter and take the appropriate bolus, no matter how small. There's my attempt at convincing! Pumps and CGM's are very personal. I have friends that love their pumps and CGM's and I have friends that will NEVER use a pump or a CGM. Both groups have both controlled and uncontrolled numbers."

diabetes,3dtmsi,derphamster,2,Sun Jul 19 10:20:32 2015 UTC,I see.  Why do you think it would be less of a pain with a pump? Ive never used a pump before but it seems much easier to just carry a pen around that to have this machine stuck to you 24/7
diabetes,3dtmsi,derphamster,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:34:43 2015 UTC,"The pump can do extended bolusing, so it automatically gives you a second dose at a preset time, or it can spread your insulin dose out gradually over a specified time period. I don't have a pump either but it would definitely be useful!"
diabetes,3dtmsi,derphamster,2,Sun Jul 19 11:08:13 2015 UTC,"Sure but you wouldnt want it to automatically give you a second dose, what if you need the second dose abit later or earlier?  I guess it all depends on how strict ppl are with their control"
diabetes,3dtmsi,badgerpapa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:15:50 2015 UTC,"There are different bolus options, you pick the one you want that best suits your needs. If you don't pick one it just does a standard bolus the same as with a pen.   This is the reason that many doctors like people to do MDI for a while before getting a pump though. You're more keenly aware of the insulin profile and how your blood sugar responds when you have to do it all yourself."
diabetes,3dtmsi,Scacchy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:24:02 2015 UTC,"Once you know how you react to a specific meal, then you can just give yourself the correct bolus profile and not worry about it.   For example, at my office every Monday the company buys pizza. I know that if I do a 3.5 hour bolus with 60% up front and 40% spread over the 3.5 hours my BG won't spike at all. It look a couple trial/error attempts to find the right ratios for this specific pizza place but now I've got it."
diabetes,3dtmsi,DecadeMoon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:02:13 2015 UTC,This is what everyone says before trying a pump. Trust me when I say being attached to a pump is liberating. It doesn't feel any different than carrying a cell with you everywhere.  If you take the time to learn its features it allows for very precise and customized control.  I've been on a pump for 15 years.
diabetes,3dt018,vanderown,7,Sun Jul 19 04:10:39 2015 UTC,"I also became diabetic because of Necrotising Pancreatitis, so I have gone through the same stuff you are going through and will be going through. Necrotising Pancreatitis absolutely sucks. Terrible pain, bad complications, and a long healing process. Personally I 128 days in the hospital, had a few surgeries, and took a while to heal.     I think the honeymoon  phase applied to me. I was insulin dependent in the hospital with IV feeds. When I started eating they took me off insulin and I was fine. Several weeks later I experienced a ton of hyperglycemia symptoms. Always thirsty and waking up in the night to pee. So I went back on insulin.     You don't really need a CGM for diabetes management. I went two years without one, however dexcom is awesome. You may want to see if your diabetes is lasting before getting one. It was a long and expensive process and it may not be worth it if your diabetes is temporary. They thought mine could be. Checking your blood sugar when you wake up, before insulin, and before going to bed is definitely enough to give your endo a clear idea. If they adjust your lantus they may ask you to check 3 hours after going to sleep. They made me for levimir which is morning and night. If you really want to know your trends you can check 2-3 hours after eating. As for bg I try to keep myself between 90 and 180. I definitely feel low sub 90 and high at 200+. My endo goals are 130 sleeping and 110 awake.     You probably still have some pancreatic function. I remember when I was first put on insulin I would do 5 units, a correction for my bg, no carb adjustments and I was fine. But now I need to do a 1:5 carb ratio and 1:20 bg ratio. I would always use humalog to cover your meals unless you are constantly dropping low that day. I went on a backpacking trip and after meals I would drop low and I would have to stop. I keep doing my long acting and stopped giving humalog and my blood sugars were fine even with 60g+ carb meals. I have also noticed this when I am doing a lot of activity during the day.     I tend to see lower bg numbers when exercising. You can test your bg before and see where your at. If your reading is below average you can have a snack. I noticed that with or without a snack during exercise my bg will trend down slowly over the course of hours, not drop like a rock. I tend to only have trouble with covering lunch, exercising, and then dropping low.     It is as simple as you've described. If you want to eat 150g of carbs you should cover 4 units. Do expect your endocrinologist to adjust your ratio as needed. I have noticed that after a huge carb meal 200g+ my bg will plateau and I will usually correct an hour or two after the meal if my bg is 200+.     As for getting back to normal with Necrotising Pancreatitis it takes a while. I was admitted back in May of 2013 and am back to normal (besides diabetes and missing my gallbladder, appendix, and ? of my pancreas). I remember having to watch my fat intake and the pain when we tried just a little bit more. I had chronic pain for a while. Some meals would cause me pain for a day or more, some times I would wake up in pain, some times just random pain. It does get better and go away. Hopefully they prescribed you some sort of pain killers. Probably the only plus of necrotising pancreatitis is now I have a huge pain tolerance. Hopefully your pancreas heals enough for you to be non diabetic.      Feel free to Pm or reply about anything regarding diabetes or necrotising pancreatitis. I'm happy to help."
diabetes,3dt018,Askull,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:22:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your sharing your experiences and taking the time to type out such a thorough reply. I'm sorry to hear your bout with the Necrotising Pancreatitis involved so much pain and surgery, I've avoided that so far but I guess things can change quickly.  I'll definitely be sending more questions your way as I gather up more.   How long after this happened was it until the doctors were completely satisfied that you were 'out of the woods' and they didn't expect further complications?"
diabetes,3dt018,Askull,2,Mon Jul 20 02:20:42 2015 UTC,"They released from the hospital when I was able to eat enough/on nj feeds. However I did get a pancreatic-pseudo cyst that I had to get that drained which they were hopeful it would fix itself. A few months after that I had to have emergency surgery because of the blood vessels in my pancreas caused a GI Hemorrhage.      Hopefully you wont have those complications. If you get bad pain that lasts, and is regular, you should get checked out. I had outpatient MRI's and frequent blood samples.     The doctors were satisfied that I didn't have pancreatic insufficiency for digestion after I had weight gain and a stool sample.  I realized when I was fine with eating when I stopped getting pain after eating and random pain. Stay away from greasy and fried food for a few months. I don't know how much fast food you ate before the pancreatitis, but avoid that. Once you would be able to eat fast food again don't. After not having it for so long it will be amazing and addicting. You will be better off using this as an opportunity to never eat fast food again.     I'd say it took somewhere between 3-6 months after my last hospitalization to get back to ""normal"". You will eventually realize that there is no way to get back to the healthy you were before necrotising pancreatitis.     As for having surgeries I had 2 laparoscopic and 1 open surgery. I had my gallbladder removed as gallstones caused my necrotising pancreatitis and I had my pancreatic-pseudo cyst drained; both laparoscopicly . And my open surgery was because of my GI hemorrhage and it was an emergency surgery. That wound abscessed and had to be opened. So now I have a really cool large (8"") scar instead of a belly button.     Again I'd be happy to answer any questions."

In almost every suggestion this diet tells you to opt for the low-fat alternative whenever possible.  Low fat diets have been shown to be a sham, when you cut the fat you increase the ratios of carbohydrates.    This diet looks to be emphasizing first and foremost calorie reduction.  This is fine for temporarily losing weight, but it's not a sustainable lifestyle.  In what world is a cup of skim milk and 1/2 a banana, or 1/2 cup of quinoa a sufficient dinner?

diabetes,3dvzad,maccam6,2,Mon Jul 20 13:39:54 2015 UTC,"I was calling bullshit at this point:   What to Eat?  To make a long story short, an ideal diabetes food plan is more like what anyone would eat on daily basis. But, you need to eat things that are rich in essential nutrients, contain fewer calories and have almost no fats. Following are the dos and don’ts of an ideal food plan for diabetics:   I stopped reading at this point:   Breakfast:  Tasty fried rice. Toss onions and garlic into a container and cook till they’re stir fired. Now vegetables including runner beans, capsicum and broccoli or any seasonal vegetables that might be available. Add to this mixture, cashews, tofu and cooked rice. Garnish with sliced egg omelet.   Rice at breakfast? For a type 2? I had a look at the ""About"" page:   About  Hi and welcome to DiabetesEnquire.com. My name is Chris and I am the creator of this website. Fortunately I am not a diabetic but unfortunately most of my family is and that is the reason I created Diabetes Enquire.   The person who wrote this has not got even the faintest clue.

diabetes,3dvzad,parkerpyne,2,Tue Jul 21 04:09:59 2015 UTC,"In case you aren't aware there are whole cultures that exclusively rely on rice for their carb intake. Some years ago I dated a Filipina and in those days my weekend breakfasts consistently mainly of rice paired with different preparations of fish, most often milkfish.   Of course I am aware of it. I was in Laos and Sri Lanka a few months ago and I have travelled all of SE Asia, China and India.   That does not mean I, or any other type 2 diabetic, should presume rice is OK for me at breakfast without testing to see the effects on blood glucose. To recommend high carbs, whether rice or any other carb, without that qualification to a type 2 as a suitable breakfast is irresponsible at best. Of course, that does not stop far too many dieticians doing just that.   I did not suffer any ill effects from it.   Of course you did not. Either it was before your diagnosis or you bolused appropriately. You do not mention it in your flair but you stated you are type 1 in earlier posts. Most type 2s do not have the ability to inject to cover a high breakfast carb load.   Meanwhile, diabetics shouldn't delude themselves into believing that just by minimizing carbs they are automatically living healthy, especially not type II diabetics. Their main issue is most commonly not carbs but calories, in whichever shape or form they are consumed.    That is pompous nonsense. Of course we don't just minimise carbs. We also remain aware of the need for balance and good nutrition while we adjust our carbs for good blood glucose management. But make no mistake about it, for a type 2 carb management is paramount when choosing the menu. I have no delusions on the subject and my health, 13 years post-diagnosis, is fine. You are neither experienced as a type 2 nor qualified to make that statement.   Stick to the subjects you know something about. I don't offer advice on insulin to T1s; don't offer advice to us on diet."
diabetes,3dvzad,alan_s,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:49:50 2015 UTC,"This issue of rice-based diets and pre-diabetes is complicated. Based on the latest ADA definition of pre-diabetes (A1c 5.7%-6.4%), over half of Chinese adults are pre-diabetic.  However, less than half of people diagnosed with pre-diabetes will progress to diabetes. Advising half of Chinese adults to avoid rice would not be justified. If you ate rice for breakfast and had no dangerous blood glucose spike then keep eating it. Non-diabetics simply do not have to follow the same dietary restrictions as diabetics do.  But those that do progress to type 2 diabetes have one primary method to protect their health, and that is to prevent elevated blood glucose. That's driven by carbs, not total calories.  You're arguing with people with a disease, who measure the effects of everything they eat and know what they're talking about, calling them delusional, and implying some kind of bigotry. Nice move."

diabetes,3dsevb,Vexwyf,3,Sun Jul 19 00:27:42 2015 UTC,"I had GD during two preganancies.  The first time, we discovered it at about six months along.  The second time, I just started with the  ADA 2200-calorie diet for pregnant women as soon as I knew for sure that I was pregnant.  At the time, I was told that the biggest risk of uncontrolled blood sugar would occur late -- that the placenta ""ages"" prematurely and that labor could be impaired.  (Please talk with your MFM professional about your risks.)  In my case, my first baby came several weeks late and was very large.  My second baby was of a more manageable size and came about on time, though I wound up on insulin for the last month.  So I guess I would agree with your MFM person -- even though the second pregnancy was more involved with the insulin, control during the second pregnancy was much better for much longer, and the birth was much better.  I hope this helps!"

diabetes,3dsevb,pickwicktea,2,Sun Jul 19 01:53:49 2015 UTC,"Hi,   I'm not a Dr. or type 2 and I have never had a baby or been on keto so do what you like with these thoughts.  Get new strips I wouldn't mess around with strips that seem to work when you could get new ones that you know will work. I would test fasting, pre and post meal, and before bed at a minimum. That might be overkill but it's what I would do.   As far as diet I know people who are pregnant do keto. That's a link to the ketobabies sub which has lots more information.   As far as I know you can't have a risk free pregnancy but the better your control the less likely you are to have problems. It sounds like you were doing really well before you got pregnant and that's a big help. I'm sure you can do it."
diabetes,3dsevb,hurry_up_meow,3,Sun Jul 19 00:51:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I think you're right about the strips. Seems silly to rely on them when I can get the nurse to refill them Monday.  I'm loathe to do full-on keto simply because I don't know of any studies, much less clinical consensus, showing its safe during pregnancy. And I can't in good conscience attempt it without that. I plan to go back to it once the baby's here, though."
diabetes,3dsevb,derphamster,2,Sun Jul 19 01:02:38 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I had gestational diabetes but I will try to take a stab at it.  A dietician will usually recommended three meals with 30-45g of carbohydrates and two snacks with about 15g of carbohydrates. Looking back, if I were to do it again, I would aim to eat lower amounts of carbs but still have some. I would really say focus on whole foods and make sure you are getting plenty of protein as well.  As far as risks....You can be diabetic and have a healthy baby but you will be more closely monitored. I had gestational diabetes twice and both my children are healthy. The better your blood sugar is under control the less giant your baby will be. At birth there is a risk of hypoglycemia and both of my children went to the NICU for a brief period of time for monitoring.   You run a higher risk of issues with blood pressure and are at a higher risk of preterm labor. The better control you have of your blood sugar, the better the outcomes are for you and your baby.   It really is OK, but you do have to take care of yourself. If you don't already have an Endocrinologist, do try to find one to follow you for your pregnancy. You may find that they don't want you to take Metformin during pregnancy and to use insulin instead. If that discussion happens, and you are hinky about needles, try not to worry too much because you get used to them. Also, be aware that as the placenta grows your blood sugar will get more and more out of whack. That is normal and due to placental hormones. Having a med like insulin that can be so readily adjusted will help so much with your control.  ...and uh, toss those strips."
diabetes,3dsevb,derphamster,2,Sun Jul 19 03:46:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your experience.  I am so not the least bit hinky about needles-- I've done two rounds of IVF (many needles per day) over the last two years. Teeny insulin needles are no biggies!  I don't really have an endocrinologist--- I did see one about 2 years ago (which is why I have a meter and expired strips) when my IVF doctor made me because of my high hba1c. I never went back because of a bunch of sorta small reasons-- I didn't really click with her, she just sorta gave me a meter and a worksheet and said ""good luck"" and she was anti-keto dieting which was not something I was wanting to hear at the time-- I was determined to lose weight and felt that was the best route for me. And her office is in the middle of a huge hospital that is a pain to get to. I know, all dumb reasons individually but I was seeing SO MANY doctors while doing IVF. ""Only"" seeing an OBGYN or MFM once or twice a month is a relief for me.  Maybe I'll ask the MFM for a referral to an endo nearer to my home or my OBGYN/MFM practice, although she seemed to feel comfortable handling my GD herself. I guess once I have the GD ""lesson"" with her nurse I'll decide if It seems like I need more management?   The MFM did say I'll get extra monitoring but as someone who has lost so many pregnancies, I'm okay with that.  I'll keep in mind that BG control is likely to get harder as I go along and that its normal and not my fault or even necessarily a sign that it's harming the baby."
diabetes,3dsevb,hurry_up_meow,2,Sun Jul 19 13:14:58 2015 UTC,"As far as diet goes, eat lower carb but not to the point of keto. Keeping meals under 40g carb should help, as should trying to eat carb free snacks. The best way to manage your carb intake is to use your meter to find out how many carbs you can tolerate before it spikes your blood sugar. Test before you eat, then 1 hour afterward. If you see a rise of less than 50mg/dl you're good, if it's more then reduce the amount of carbs next time. If you do this consistently until you're always rising only small amounts, your overall numbers will be better and your risks will go down. The more meals you test the better your control will be.   However, since you had signs of diabetes before you were even pregnant, you should get tested for type 1 antibodies and c-peptide to rule out LADA. This is a slow onset form of type 1, which usually shows up around age 30 and looks a lot like t2 at first. It does not always occur to some doctors as it's relatively rare but seems to be common in the /r/diabetes demographic. If you have this, you'll need insulin but control will be waaaaay easier, because you dose for what you eat. You can somewhat control LADA with a low carb diet but it is progressive so at some point insulin will become the only treatment.   Your main risks with high blood sugars are to do with blood pressure/pre-eclampsia, the size of the baby (it grows too fast with high bg) and preterm labour. Blood sugar is entirely in your hands to control but make sure you are on the right treatment (see above). Also, if you turn out to have LADA don't worry too much about passing it to baby - the risk is only something like 5%. T2 is more strongly inherited but usually doesn't show up until ones 50s.  Yes, get new test strips! You need to know what your actual blood sugar is and your baby is worth buying a new bunch of vials."
diabetes,3dsevb,missjlynne,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:53:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's so interesting about LADA, which I just had to Google. I had never considered that I might not be Type 2, because:   I'm obese and pretty much always have been literally every middle-aged plus adult on my dad's side has Type 2 keto dieting and losing 65 lbs improved my hba1c considerably not one of the several doctors I've discussed this with have ever raised that possibility.   However, I am 36 and my hba1c has been creeping up since my early 30's, my latest 5.4 not included. Maybe next time the MFM wants me to get sent to the vampires in the lab, I'll ask her draw those labs for me. It wouldn't change my management plan at this stage, though, right? The goal is still good BG control with diet and exercise without insulin as long as is possible?  I'm going to blow through those old strips practicing the next couple of days testing before meals, and then one and two hours after. I know how to count carbs and calories so I am going to do that too. Thanks for the practical guidance, it's much appreciated."
diabetes,3dsevb,tour_de_pizza,2,Sun Jul 19 13:21:54 2015 UTC,"It's true that those things you mentioned put you at higher risk of having t2, and t2 is far more common, but it's best to be sure. There no point struggling to control t2 if you're not 100% sure that's what you have.   If you still struggle after counting carbs more strictly and losing a bit of weight, and your labs come back negative for antibodies and you're making enough insulin (this is what c-peptide measures), you might want to chat to your doctor about adding another t2 med. Don't do this until you know that you don't have LADA though as some of those meds can make LADA progress faster."
diabetes,3dsevb,missjlynne,2,Sun Jul 19 17:01:05 2015 UTC,"If it helps, my first kiddo was 7 pounds 2 ounces and was 5 days late so I was able to control my sugar pretty well.  My second was 9 pounds 7 ounces and he was taken a week early. I had more difficulty with control with him and honestly had a tougher time also managing cravings.  Your reasons for not seeing that endo I think are pretty sound. But, if it were me, I would try to find one that you bond with better. If you are comfortable with your regular doc, then go for it, but you may have to do insulin with an endo if you want to consider that. My endo actually took me off of Metformin to do insulin because she didn't like Metformin during pregnancy. But that was 10 years ago and it could have been her personal preference.  I had a couple friends who were pregnant at the same time, who were kind of jealous about the additional monitoring because I got to have more ultrasounds and hear my baby's heartbeat more. They didn't understand the stress of the additional monitoring, but it did help with piece of mind when I was so very worried.  Best of luck."
diabetes,3dsevb,mumsyme53,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:38:44 2015 UTC,"Hi! I had gestational diabetes with my first, miscarried my second pregnancy, and was diagnosed as type 2 early on in my third pregnancy (around 8 weeks). So I definitely have some experience here.   My doctor was 100% not helpful when I had GD during my first pregnancy (didn't give me good resources, yelled at me when my sugars rose despite adhering to the basic plan they gave me, never once suggested that maybe I should be on insulin or anything else even though my sugars continued to rise, etc), but the second time we went to a different practice and I got referred to an awesome endocrinologist who took great care of me.   The diet guidelines I was given are: 30g carbs for breakfast and lunch, 45g for dinner, 15g for snacks. They didn't give me calorie goals, but I basically just tried to eat when hungry. You will find that not all carbs are created equal. 30g of pure sugar will spike your blood sugars, while 30g of a non-starchy vegetable won't. I tried to avoid sugar, white flour, fruit juice, and starchy veggies (potatoes, corn, etc). It's best to consume carbs that have a lot of fiber and/or protein. You'll find that processed and premade foods are often not an option - too many carbs for a tiny serving. I had to make a lot from scratch.   You can try to eat lower carb - I was afraid to keto (was ketoing prior to pregnancy and I am now too) because of possible risks. Some people have done it with no issues. Your doctor will likely recommend against it.   As for possible risks.... I was told that early poor blood sugar control (first trimester) can lead to congenital heart defects and increases risk of miscarriage. Later in pregnancy, poor control can increase the risk of still birth. It can also create big babies, which increases the risk to you during delivery, possibly can lead to the baby's shoulder dislocation during delivery, may require an early induction, and increases risk of emergency c-section. Your baby may also have low blood sugar upon delivery. This is generally something that can be improved with nursing or formula supplementation, but can lead to time in the NICU. My first son had perfect blood sugar, my second had low sugar for the first day. Luckily we avoided the NICU but it was still scary. You should also know that diabetics/gestational diabetics are at a higher risk for other pregnancy issues... particularly gestational hypertension (which I developed in my 1st pregnancy) and pre-ecclampsia.   All that said... The risk is definitely in your hands! Bad blood sugar control is what causes the complications.... if you keep your sugars steady, it won't be a problem. That being said, you will need to evaluate your treatment often. I had to increase my insulin dose several times as time went on. This isn't your fault. Insulin resistance increases during pregnancy and continues to increase throughout.   I know it all can sound really scary, but you should also know that this diagnosis means lots of extra monitoring and special care for you and your baby. You will have your OB, your MFM, and an endocrinologist all checking in on you and baby. You will get extra ultrasounds (including one that will check for those possible complications from early blood sugar issues - I had mine around 25 weeks). At the end of your pregnancy, you will have non-stress tests weekly to make sure baby is okay; these tests check baby's heart rate and movement. Lots of things are in place to keep you and baby healthy. All you need to do is be faithful to your treatment plan.   I have two happy and healthy little boys after two difficult pregnancies. It is possible!   Sorry for the novel. ;-)"
diabetes,3dsevb,alan_s,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:06:15 2015 UTC,"Came here to write about my experience, but this covers it!   One thing I will add:  I had GD and it went undiagnosed (it was discovered post-partum by my derm, who looked at my OB records because of acanthosis that had become severe and found I failed the test at 28 weeks but did not get another test). My A1C was 6.2 at that time.  For the duration of my pregnancy, I was not treated. My daughter and I are very lucky that labor/delivery was fine and I had no other complications during my pregnancy.   HOWEVER, I had TONS of complications after from not being treated - many of which are the complications you would expect from someone with untreated T2. It has taken 4 years to get better, and even though I'm better now than I was pre-pregnancy, I cannot help but wonder how much better my quality of life would've been had I been treated appropriately and given proper guidance.   Moral of the Story:  Whatever action and measures you take now may stress you out, may be challenging with cravings, and may be difficult. BUT, if you do the best you can now and work with your doctor, your health post-partum will be so much better for it - and so will your baby's.  The extra monitoring is key, so work with people you trust and you'll both be ok :)"

diabetes,3dspx2,headshot442,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:20:32 2015 UTC,I'm on the opposite - bolus only. I'm not quite as insulin sensitive as you (I do 1:20) but because I only bolus when I eat it makes things very flexible and I don't hypo unless I make a dosing mistake.   If you feel like you still spike a bit with Lantus only you could try bolus only. Which regime is best depends mostly on how your pancreas still functions.

diabetes,3dspx2,sir_rupert,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:03:26 2015 UTC,"There's some evidence (not conclusive) that allowing the remaining pancreas beta cells to rest allows them to fly under the radar as the antibodies that are directed against them recognise them when they produce insulin.   Of course, how much this helps depends on how many beta cells you have left. For newly diagnosed t1s this can be quite a significant number, or not, depending on how bad things got before diagnosis.   It was recently shown that even long term t1s can still have beta cell function so it seems to be more individual than time based."
diabetes,3dspx2,derphamster,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:39:56 2015 UTC,"I'm still honeymooning. Last week I went camping and made a fatal mistake by not taking Lantus at night (I forgot and had been drinking). I woke up only at 185 (alcohol maybe had something to do with it). However, even with Lantus I wake up between 150-190. I wonder if what's left of my beta cells ""replaced"" Lantus for the night. Derphampster, may I ask what your wake up blood sugars are averaging? You can PM me or not respond at all :). I'm just curious if they are similar to mine when I didn't take Lantus since you don't take basal yet."
diabetes,3dspx2,sir_rupert,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:08:01 2015 UTC,"Yup sounds likely that's what happened. Residual beta cell function plus help from the alcohol.   My fasting is creeping up slowly but I'm not sure how much of that had to do with a change in sleeping pattern for work recently. It was consistently 5.3mmol/l (95) shortly after diagnosis last summer but had crept up to 5.8 (105) over the last year. The last 2 months it's been mostly 6-7 (120ish) though but variable so it looks like I might need to do some overnight testing to see when that starts rising. It doesn't seem to be affected by my evening eating, and if I get woken up from deep sleep it's usually in the 5s. I'm going to use this as a potential argument for a pump as I still drop easily to low 4s (<80) in the late afternoon (and did so even before I was on insulin) so currently a 24h basal would probably send me hypo right as I'm about to drive 30min home. Not ideal!"

I'm curious as to how you convinced a doctor to go only bolus since most seem to go the only basal and control with diet regimen or pills/diet for LADAs. Your only bolus regimen seems much more intuitive than both of those.  If you could survive without eating anything, you would be nearly non-diabetic! Though I guess we all would be non-diabetics."

This is a disease that can present itself as minimal when you're making good choices with your lifestyle and taking accurate doses. But human error is human error, in the midst of living you'll forget to check your BG's sometimes or make mistakes with insulin doses. Simply put a CGM has got your back. Insulin is an amazingly potent hormone to be giving to people with very little education in its use and to expect us to be making consistently accurate judgement calls.   Endurance sport or high adrenalin sports especially, have some really great support groups that are very encouraging. Most testimonials mention a CGM, it's really not surprising. To be truly liberated you need to dull that background hum of MDI dose calculations and 'How am I feeling' thoughts. You can either do that with something that can take the wheel for you and do a reasonable job or by taking less management of your diabetes care which is neglectful."

I am type 2. To be honest, I envy you those 90s.  My fasting has gradually crept up in the years since I was diagnosed too. I am able to control my peak post-prandial numbers by care with my menu choices but there seems to be little I can do to stop the slow rise in fasting.   After three years on d&e without meds it crept up over 6(108) so I added metformin. That got it back under 6 but ten years later it has slowly risen over 6 again and occasionally hits 6.5(117).  During that period I managed to improve it occasionally by trying various bedtime snacks (see I Ate Nothing! Why Are My BGs high?). But that method has limits.  For a while I considered adding more meds or insulin. I am loath to do that because I prefer to avoid additional meds until there is a definite need. Adding meds is still a future possibility but for the moment I have stopped worrying about it because thirteen years after diagnosis I have no complications.    You must do as you think best, but with those numbers I would stop worrying too much about fasting and concentrate on your peak post prandials."

But they were sort of a silly source of comfort for me, at least I could count on them. I will try to concentrate/worry more on my post meals, but I'm definitely going to still keep an eye on fasting too.    For the snack method, do you know the kind of snack it should be? Carbs, fat, protein, all 3, or just have to try all? Pecans did nothing, but that was just one test.  I wish I knew for sure what type I was, then I could research all my options! I've been reading more about MODY, which seems possible as I'm super skinny, and my cholesterol was crazy super good, with HDL high/good. Good cholesterol readings ran on my father's side. But I could just be a skinny type 2, whose fasting insulin numbers tested on the low side because I was eating low carb when the test was taken. I'd had reactive hypo type symptoms post carby meals since I was young (until a couple of years ago when they stopped), which makes me think LADA isn't that likely.

Floating poops is fine, but if your poops are liquidy with floating oil droplets, or anything like that, that could be a cause for concern. If it's a once in a while thing (once or twice a week or less) it could be fine and might just be from a night of heavy drinking or something. But if it's happening more than once a day, it's something worth getting checked out.

diabetes,3dot42,WavesOfEchoes,7,Sat Jul 18 00:54:45 2015 UTC,I don't think you could last 2+ years after diagnoses without insulin if you are a type 1; in my opinion type 1 is ruled out.
diabetes,3dot42,su-5,5,Sat Jul 18 03:46:22 2015 UTC,"LADA is a subtype of t1 where you absolutely can get away without insulin for years in some cases, as the pancreas is damaged very slowly. Anti-GAD being positive but not other antibodies points to this, even if subsequent antibody tests are negative."
diabetes,3dot42,derphamster,3,Sat Jul 18 10:43:11 2015 UTC,"Still LADA/t1.5. You may not always test positive for antibodies but the fact you had a positive anti-GAD test and your blood glucose when diagnosed was well in the diabetic range means that you have the autoimmune type.   The thing about LADA as opposed to full t1 is that the decline to full insulin dependence can take months or years or decades. Your low carb diet has probably allowed your beta cells to fly under the radar (since they haven't had to make a lot of insulin) and possibly regenerate somewhat, leading to the good control you have now.   It's also hard to gauge insulin production in LADA patients because many of them (myself as an example) produce enough insulin to have a fairly normal fasting level. My BG will drop to the 80s without external insulin if I don't eat. If I eat carbs though my insulin response is definitely inadequate.   Keep doing what you're doing and enjoy your good control! Unfortunately you're not cured, but you're doing the right things to preserve your pancreas function for as long as possible. You just have to hope you got a good ticket in the genetic lottery and that this will continue for a long time to come :)"
diabetes,3dot42,derphamster,2,Sat Jul 18 01:43:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Excellent info. Its funny how my old endocrinologist was positive that I was T1 based on the original GAD test ""slight"" positive, while my current endo isn't sure. She essentially told me the only way to tell for sure was if my honeymoon ended."
diabetes,3dot42,derphamster,2,Sat Jul 18 02:52:08 2015 UTC,"Well that's kind of true because if you're not positive for antibodies then there's not much you can do. It is well documented however that antibodies may not always test positive in LADA patients, especially in honeymoon. You may test positive again in the future so continue to act like you have LADA but keep your fingers crossed for a nice long honeymoon period!"
diabetes,3dot42,mmccullen,0,Sat Jul 18 03:01:53 2015 UTC,The C-peptide and GAD tests certainly imply that you're t2. Stay on top of your BGs. If they become uncontrollable without with your current routine you might be progressing towards t1-land.
diabetes,3dot42,derphamster,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:42:24 2015 UTC,"No, having had antibodies means OP is not type 2. S/he's just in a honeymoon period which, with LADA, can do stuff like this but the condition never fully goes away."
diabetes,3dot42,alan_s,0,Sat Jul 18 02:17:26 2015 UTC,In my lay opinion: 95% confidence type 2. The other 5% will be clear in a few years. How old are you?  Congrats on your A1c. Keep doing what you're doing until you learn otherwise.

I do have insurance through my employer, but the durable medical equipment coverage is nearly non-existent. My understanding is that the first 5 thousand is on me, after that they pay 75%.  Might as well be a million dollars for all that I can afford to pay 5K on top of my insulin/strips/doc appointments.  I could only afford to see an endo this year for the first time in my adult life.  He encouraged me to get one, because I get nighttime lows a lot.  He was sympathetic to the fact that I can't afford one and encouraged me to find someone selling their old dex.  He said if I could get the computer part, he would write me the script for the sensors.  I want a CGM to help me sleep at night.  A CGM would go a huge way towards improving my mental health, as well as diabetes control."

I also have a box of supplies you can have with it as well. I did want to donate it to someone. I will admit my new pump is a tslim and it is alot better pump.

diabetes,3dmzpc,Racer5,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:30:55 2015 UTC,"I apologize in advance for the log post. Recently started liking here and have been astonished by the support in this community. I'm type-1 diabetic for 16 years and have always used one touch meters and manual injections. While I was younger and a teen, my numbers were always great, but recently everything's kinda fallen apart.  While I do have insurance, it doesn't work to well in my favor. I'm currently paying around $150 bucks a week on insulin and testing supplies. This is for test strips novolog flex pens and Lantus. I'm working with a Diabetes Resource Center and have just recently began looking at pumps+cgm. No idea how much it will cost me though and I'm a bit nervous as I can barely afford rent with my supplies and am also supposed to be saving for my wedding. My fiancé has been incredibly understanding and helping where she can, but it's been a struggle and the ever looming debt has been following me around like a dark cloud.   The specialists at the resource center have been working closely with me and I've recently started lurking around here.  I'm currently taking 50u Lantus and have a carb ratio of 1:6 novolog with a correction factor of 1u for every 20pts over 120.  Still, my numbers have been all over the place. I'm a cook and have a pretty good grasp on portions/carb counting - but sometimes my numbers will fluctuate up into the 200s with no carb intake at all. It's been insanely stressful - which also isn't helping my numbers - when my bs is high, I tend to beat myself up thinking I've done something wrong, though my logs and consistency all show I haven't. My specialists says it seems like some severe dawn phenomenon and that cgm is the best way to really see what's going on.   My insurance company has not been helpful at all, the mail order pharmacy they are partnered with - my only option for insulin right now - had not heard of Medtronic, omnipod, tandem, or animas. I was actually really interested in the Vibe pump because of the cgm aspect, and was upset to see the negative opinion on their equipment from this sub.  Anyhow, I don't necessarily think I am the best candidate out here for this, and I definitely think this could be beneficial to a younger one who is recently diagnosed, as I could only imagine the early years would've been much easier with something like this. But this has all been on my mind non stop lately and what a great opportunity to vent."

diabetes,3dp5ct,JSL82,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:48:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can buy used insulin pumps legally in Canada (or anywhere), I'm afraid. However, I was told when I was pregnant that the pump manufacturers have pumps that can be borrowed during pregnancy (well, Medtronic does anyway - and you do need to be pregnant first to qualify). You'd still have to buy infusion sets (hopefully your insurance will cover those), but it would save you the $5000 or so you'd need for the pump itself.   Talk to your endo/doctor about pump options as well as your insurance issues; he or she may have some info you can put to use. It's definitely worth it to check to see what can be done - I know that for me, even though I'm no longer using it, the pump did make things waaay easier while I was pregnant.    EDIT   What kind of trouble are you having with your control currently? A pump is an amazing tool, but, honestly, it's also a lot of work and I wouldn't necessarily call it a quick fix for blood sugar problems (although being able to program multiple basal rates is pretty great)."

The ability to fine tune things with a pump can definitely make things easier, it just sucks that coverage can be so all over the place.   Provincial coverage varies a lot depending on what province you are in (Diabetes Advocacy has lots of info on coverage in different provinces), so definitely check there to see what your province covers (maybe your insurance won't cover the purchase simply because your provincial plan already does?). Talk to your endo for sure though, I doubt it's the first time he or she has had someone in your situation."

I live in BC and I'm too old to qualify for a pump covered by pharmacare and my health insurance through work wouldn't cover a new pump initially. I ended up talking to my companies HR manager and she was able to get Great West Life to cover %50 of a new pump in addition to my coverage. Depending on who provides your health insurance, I would look into seeing if they can make an exception. I also get the disability tax credit so my tax money next year will pay for the rest so you should definitely look into that to see if you can get extra tax money back. When you qualify for the DTC I think you can go back 10 years in recouping tax money.   As far as I know there's no way to get an older or second hand pump unless through eBay but you run the risk of paying lots of money for a dud so I wouldn't recommend it. My partners brother is a type 1 and lives in Alberta where insulin are fully covered so if you know any type 1s there that don't want a pump, maybe you can get one through them?"

More insulin = less glucagon. they antagonise each other. Not only that, high blood sugar in it self causes insulin resistance (according to DR Beinstein) This would also mean that the next day, since glucagon production would be less, you would generally have a favorable carb/protein:insulin ratio.

diabetes,3donlu,PazuzuLazuli,3,Mon Jul 20 17:03:29 2015 UTC,"I was diagnosed a little over a month ago.  My bg was 252, and my A1c was 10.9, I hadn't had any symptoms.  I was in shock, I was scared what sort of damage I had been to myself, the first day I just couldn't handle it.  That weekend I went through food phobia and barely ate anything.  It took a few days but I decided to be proactive and push as hard as I could to control it.  Since then I've been eating 1300 calories, fairly low carb (<100g a day), and doing a minimum of 90m of exercise a day, however I could.  I started with walking, now I'm on the treadmill and bicycle.  Today I'm planing on getting in 180m as this is a push weekend for me.  My glucose levels came down pretty quickly, and within a few weeks I was in the low 100s.  Today I test in the 80s every morning, and <130 after meals.  I've dropped 32lbs and counting, I feel better and look better than I have in a decade.  I use MyFitnessPal to track my daily calories, and I am very diligent about it.  I got an Apple Watch to help me stay on top of my workout goals.  Between the two of them it's kept me disciplined and helped me drop the weight and change my life style.  You CAN do this.  But your life has changed for ever.  If like me you always said ""I'll get back into shape when I get less busy"", that changes now.  Your #1 job is to get healthy.  That means eating right, exercising, and dropping some weight.  Get healthy, get well, and get better.  You will feel better, and live a longer life because of it."
diabetes,3donlu,PazuzuLazuli,3,Sat Jul 18 15:34:32 2015 UTC,"You and I share a similar starting experience. When the doctor called and delivered the news my BG was 240 and my A1C was 11.3. I was terrified of those numbers so I've really had nothing but eggs and water since yesterday at 6PM EST. I'm already making plans to head back to the gym and start working out again. I'm approximately 350lbs right now so even before the diagnosis I was super unhealthy and I'm out of time for excuses now. Even today I'll be walking 3 miles so it's a good start, obviously something that will be evolving as I progress physically."
diabetes,3donlu,GandalfTheHobbit,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:05:20 2015 UTC,"You can eat more than eggs, the key is to test and understand your limits.  At your weight, however, you'll want to proceed cautiously, and lose weight quickly and steadily.  Aerobic exercise will help reverse insulin resistance, and remove fat from your pancreas, potentially improving insulin production.  Test, test, test, and keep at it!"
diabetes,3donlu,derphamster,2,Sat Jul 18 23:44:10 2015 UTC,"Cut back from carbs, and try a low carb diet. Get a glucose testing meter and, if you're just diagnosed, try and aim between 4 mmol/L (72 mg/dl) and 8 mmol/L(100 mg/dl).  It might be hard to control at first, but it gets easier over time.  Sorry that I don't have much, but if you want to ask any questions, feel free to PM me"
diabetes,3donlu,alan_s,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:15:44 2015 UTC,"Firstly, sorry that you've had to join our club, but we're here to answer your questions and help you adjust. Have a look around old threads here, there's a goldmine of good information. Keep an eye out for /u/alan_s blog links - it's a great place to start no matter your type.   Getting diagnosed truly sucks, but diabetes is very manageable and you'll still be able to live a relatively normal life. You'll just have to do a few extra small things every day.   If t1 is in your family, definitely get tested for t1 antibodies and c-peptide. Treatment differs between types (and they have different causes) so it's important to confirm which type you have. It doesn't much matter what weight you are. Thin people can be t2 and fat people can be t1.  In the meantime cut out carbs from your diet as much as possible. Swap all sugary drinks for water, diet soda or unsweetened versions. Avoid milk and juice until you are in control (you can safely use heavy cream in tea/coffee as it's low carb). Learn that ""no added sugar"" does not mean sugar/carb free!   Get yourself a blood glucose meter and start testing before and 1h after meals to gauge how your meals affect your blood sugar. Anything that spikes you more than ~50mg/dl is something you should reduce the carb amount in (smaller portion or swap out the carbs next time). Your meter is going to be your best friend and help you avoid all the nasty complications by allowing you to learn about the relationship between carbs and blood sugar. Everyone is a bit different so you'll need to work out your own carb tolerances. Some doctors can be adverse to giving a meter on prescription to someone not on insulin but this is stupid and you can get a meter without a prescription. For free even, if you look up manufacturers websites and request one.   If you're offered diabetes education classes, take them! You can learn a lot of useful stuff.   If you have any more specific questions, fire away!"
diabetes,3donlu,VladTepesDraculea,2,Sat Jul 18 02:35:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your lifting words. Yeah Type 1 runs in my family so I'm being tested Monday to figure out which type it is and then set a course of action given the results.   It's kind of a state of pseudo-euphoria really.  I grew up watching my grandmother take care of her self and managing her diabetes, and have been right by my brothers side since he was diagnosed back when he was five. What a lovely Christmas that was, anyways I always had a mindset that ""This'll never happen to me"" but here I stand.   The good thing is I already know that this disease is manageable just like you said. Hell, my Grandma has had it for 56 years and she's got a lot more left in her!   But in all honesty as a starting college student all the help has been wonderful and as a persistent redditor I'm going to be prowling through this sub gathering as much information as I can, so thanks again."
diabetes,3donlu,VladTepesDraculea,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:17:11 2015 UTC,"G'day.  You've had good advice already.    I'm going Monday to figure out if it is Type 2 or 1 (Both my grandma and brother have Type 1 but I'm much heavier than both of them) in the mean time, do any veterans have any tips for a recently diagnosed person?   This may tie up any loose ends, at least until you are certain of your type: Getting Started."
diabetes,3donlu,VladTepesDraculea,0,Sat Jul 18 07:16:32 2015 UTC,"Monday to figure out if it is Type 2 or 1   There should be more urgency on this. What results were given to you? A1c and glicemia values? How old are you btw?  Either way, sorry to hear that and welcome to the club.  Get a good endocrinologist ASAP. He should guide you through a diet plan according to your case. While you wait for the results, just reduce on carbs, cut sugar in general and use low absortion rate food (whole grain bread, rice, pasta, etc). Also moderate, if type 1 you'll need insuline, and for that you'll need a proper diagnosis and consultation."
diabetes,3doc3m,Diabetic_Douchebags,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:24:44 2015 UTC,"Hello I am type 2 but I also suffer from mild gastriparesis and delayed emptying.   For me I take a pill called metoclopromide (or Reglan) about a half hour before meals that have a lot of fiber.  It helps stimulate the vagus nerve that is causing the problem.   I also have to limit my fiber intake so that I am having smaller portions multiple times a day. Most importantly getting my sugar under tight control helped the most.  I still have to take the pill before most meals but I rarely have any of the bad symptoms of gastriparesis anymore (constipation, abdominal pain and vomiting undigested food, sorry if that's a bit graphic).  My endo and gastroenterologist said I am pretty lucky that I got my bg under control when I did or it would be much worse for me.    I hope that helps.    Really for me it's about limiting fiber, staying hydrated and keeping my bg in a good range.   The medication helps too but you need to talk with your doctor about it because it does have potential side effects and interactions with other meds. Good luck! I hope you can get it under control  Edit. Just to add on about fiber.  I have a problem with vegetable fiber but not the fiber in grains."
diabetes,3doc3m,fanatiqual,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:30:28 2015 UTC,"I haven't been clinically diagnosed but when describing the symptoms (stomach feels full of rocks high BG long after eating, etc) my Endo said it sounded like Gastroparesis.   All I've really done is make an attempt to slow down how fast I eat (I'm the youngest of many kids so I always had to shovel food into my face otherwise there would be no second helping), drink lots with meals and watch the fibre (I make my own bread -- had to reduce the fibre in my loaves). That's been enough for me."
diabetes,3doc3m,badgerpapa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:20:23 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing that seems to help me is just eating small meals. It doesn't matter if it is the healthiest meal in the world, if I eat too much total mass those brussel sprouts are going to ruin me at hour 4 or 5.  I also eat liquid lunch (glucerna) which I feel helps because it gives my stomach a chance to totally empty before dinner.  Walking after dinner, and never ever laying down after a meal til 4 or more hours has passed also help."
diabetes,3dnkcu,Noberrg,2,Fri Jul 17 18:50:29 2015 UTC,"Not an idea but a though:  I once had a discussion with a doctor (not an endo). She asked me if I saw myself as a diabetic or someone with diabetes. Ignoring the fact that a diabetic literally means someone with diabetes, I try to meet her thought and said ""someone with diabetes"". She criticized me saying that to not see oneself as a diabetic would be not to respect and care enough for the disease. I told her I couldn't disagree more, that taking care and caution had nothing to do with defining ourselves by it or not. I'd believe in the same way a paraplegic would rather define him/herself as someone who suffered with paralysis, or a schizophrenic would rather define him/herself as someone who suffered from schizophrenia, I should not define myself by my disease, but rather simply consider it as an undeniable part of my life.  So, before proceding with the tattoo I ask you to consider how you'd define yourself and what that tattoo would represent to you.  If you proceed with the idea, consider a bee since you're type 1."

Prof. Jose has acquired a research grant to expand the production lab. The smaller tech, and therefore the CGM, is 2-4 years down the line.  Right now the machine needs to be calibrated to an individual and that takes about 12 hours. Once it's calibrated it does read glucose readings correctly, but it struggles above 15mmol/l. It's promising but it does need a few years of work!"

Even still it could be off by a bit (remember, it's not as accurate and it's showing you what your BG was about 20 min ago)  Resist the urge to over calibrate and only do a BG calibration when your dexcom shows your BG is stable (horizontal line) and you're in range or close to it."
diabetes,3dn245,badgerpapa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:57:07 2015 UTC,I'll try that out. The only thing that really sketches me out is why did it receive zero data while I was asleep? If it measures BG every 5 min then there shouldn't be an hour or so long gap of nothing
diabetes,3dn245,badgerpapa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:01:58 2015 UTC,I get that too sometimes -- especially if I'm lying on top of the sensor/transmitter. The transmitter is pretty low power so the signal might not make it though your body to the receiver. I use the vibe with the integrated receiver so I just try to keep the pump physically close to the transmitter.  If you're using a stand alone receiver then maybe other people have suggestions but I would just try to keep it as close as I can to the side of my body that the transmitter is on.
diabetes,3dn245,RealNotFake,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:07:01 2015 UTC,"This is something you should call up Dexcom about and ask, because you shouldn't have missing data as long as the sensor is within range of receiver. It's possible you could have a bad sensor or transmitter or something."
diabetes,3dn245,mancake,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:09:14 2015 UTC,"For me, if I've had the sensor in for more than two weeks the numbers get totally unreliable.

Same thing about my reluctance with the pumps, I avoided CGM's for longer than I should have.

My family member gained 50 lbs in 6 months of taking it, and as soon as she stopped, lost the weight just as quickly. Antipsychotics are known to affect glucose and insulin sensitivity, and it's common to prescribe metformin along with them to counter the effects. Anyway if you are no longer taking antipsychotics, you may not have any problem with diabetes. It's worth getting tested again. If you are still taking it, you should take metformin along with it. If your doctor isn't aware of this have them start at http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/743692_6. Low carb may still be a good idea though so I'll let others address your questions about that.

I would think that depending on your current intake of carbs about 1-3 weeks to stop craving them.  I wouldn't advise going NO carb, because it is fast fuel for your body when doing physical activity. The Ketogenic Diet is less than 20g of carbs a day and I have heard of people seeing results within a month or two.   Definitely if you are to eat carbs make sure they're not from ""white"" sources like white bread, flours, and sugars.  Fruit would work especially well for this."
diabetes,3dltct,Vivicurl,0,Fri Jul 17 16:41:45 2015 UTC,Why no carb?  I'm not that extreme. My version is low-spike. This is how I do that.
diabetes,3dkzzf,EricH4753,7,Fri Jul 17 03:04:50 2015 UTC,"What type are you? Are you on insulin?    My questions are: 1. Why am I sky rocketing at breakfast? But not after lunch?   You're rocketing after breakfast because most people are very insulin resistant in the mornings due to the effects of the body's wake-up hormones. This effect wears off soon after you eat something but contributes to your breakfast spike.   You may also be experiencing reactive hypoglycemia around lunch time. This is a delayed effect of having a high blood glucose, where the body is too slow at producing insulin and ends up making too much. Your breakfast spike is probably triggering a large insulin response to overcome the spike + morning resistance (assuming you're not just injecting too much insulin at breakfast) which then makes you go very low later on.   Try skipping the toast and see if that makes a difference. Also, bagels and sandwiches are notoriously high carb so be careful with those.     How can I change to a ketogenic Diet? Will it stabilize my blood sugars?     You need to count every carb you eat, then reduce it as much as possible until you are under 30-40g carbs a day total. It should help with blood sugars yes, though some people find that if they are eating full keto they also need to account for proteins raising blood sugar.     How much exercise should I get with this diet?     As much as you want but take it easy while your body gets used to burning fat for energy rather than carbs. If you go very low carb you may need to eat some carby things if you do some really strenuous workouts but just test yourself and see how your body reacts.     Will it help me loose some weight?     Possibly. It depends mostly on your calorie needs and intake but it's a lot easier to lose weight while eating low carb because carbs are naturally converted to fat if they are not immediately used.   Edit: lol, not sure why all the numbers show up as 1. They are correct when I edit this! Thanks reddit!"
diabetes,3dkzzf,derphamster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:25:24 2015 UTC,"I'm a type 1 on novolog, and I'm covering the exact amount for breakfast I think my carb ratio is too low and it causes me to drop at 10am. Also what should I be eating on this diet?"
diabetes,3dkzzf,derphamster,3,Sat Jul 18 00:24:52 2015 UTC,"It seems like it's more a problem with the timing of your insulin and the things you're eating for breakfast.   As I mentioned, many people are carb sensitive/insulin resistant in the morning. Your breakfast is a fairly high carb one - one slice of toast is usually about 18g carbs (I assume you have more than one slice?) and a glass of milk (1 cup) is about 12g carbs. One thing that will help is to skip the toast, and swap the milk for water. This should make you spike much less, allowing you to better assess whether it's your ratio or your timing that is off. If your bg doesn't spike high or drop low after cutting down the carbs in your breakfast, it looks like your ratio is probably ok and you need to look at timing.   You may have to prebolus for breakfast so that the insulin spike and food spike hit at the same time. Try taking your insulin 15+ mins before breakfast.   Edit: for keto good foods are all meats and fish, cheese, eggs, nuts, most veg but especially green leafy veg (avoid root vegetables), cream, oils, anything that doesn't have many carbs in it. Foods to avoid are bread, rice, pasta, potatoes and root veg, cakes and baked goods, candy, chips, cereal, and other stuff with high carbs. Fruit and milk are healthy but high carb so you should control your intake of these carefully."
diabetes,3dkzzf,derphamster,2,Sat Jul 18 02:07:59 2015 UTC,"Alright so for breakfast I had 1 pice of toast: 12g, 1 piece of bacon:2g,  1 egg: 3g so 17g for breakfast and my blood sugar was 144 afterwards!  What should I have for lunch and dinner though?"
diabetes,3dkzzf,nursejessika,2,Sat Jul 18 13:26:37 2015 UTC,"That's great, good improvement! But what sort of carb heavy bacon and eggs are those? 1 large egg should contain about 0.6g carbs, and 1 rasher of bacon should contain 0.1g carbs. Are you eating some strange brands that are sweetened or something?  Did keeping your breakfast spike lower help you to avoid the crash afterwards?   For lunch I have some options from sliced deli meats, cheese, mini sausages (watch out with these as some brands put in a lot of carb filler), satay sticks, smoked sausage, tuna, chicken, salad, small bags of chips (I pick ones that have 12-15g carbs), lower carb granola bars (only <15g carb ones) and occasionally some lower carb chocolate bars (also only ones <15g carb). The reason I am for 15g units is because that fits with my insulin ratio.  For dinner just limit the portions of things that have carbs - check the labels. Check out /r/keto for some ideas on what sort of things you can make that don't have a lot of carbs in them. Most people are least insulin resistant in the evening so you may have less of an issue.   One thing many people don't realise is that their insulin ratio may be different at different times of day. For example in the morning I use 1u:7g carb, but at dinner I use 1u:20g carb. Just do a lot of testing and trial and error to work out your individual needs."

diabetes,3dkzzf,herman_gill,2,Sat Jul 18 15:01:59 2015 UTC,"As /u/derphamster asked, it's important to know if you're T1, T2 or T1.5, your body can react differently in each case and would make answering some of your questions easier if we knew.  How do you treat your diabetes? Insulin? Pills? Fixed dosing? Sliding scale? Carb counting?  I'll share my experience with you, I'm T1 for over 19 years on an insulin pump. Had so-so control before the pump, great control for 6 months after the pump then kinda let things slide. I've been eating keto for 3-4 months now. My BG is excellent now, I average around 5.6mmol/L (100mg/dL) at all meals, I eat less than 20g carbs per meal and usually try to keep my daily carbs under 40g. I have lost 25lbs since starting to change the way I eat, and I do not exercise more than I used to (I walk and hike a lot but haven't added a workout yet).  I know that keto or LCHF (low carb high fat) diets have had good success in T2 but that some T1s are reluctant for fear of increased hypos and I do still have hypos (I've had some 2.2mmol/L (39mg/dL) recently because it takes some tweaking once your lifestyle changes, I'm outside more since the weather is nicer and less stressed because I'm on vacation).  If you have a CDE give them a call and talk it out, or if you've got a good relationship with your Endo, continue your research and give them a call to see how it would work specifically for you. I had to make adjustments to my basal doses and my carb ratios when I started keto and unless you feel really comfortable managing on your own, I'd recommend having a health care professional to help you out at the start."
diabetes,3dkzzf,herman_gill,2,Fri Jul 17 13:30:51 2015 UTC,"It might not be the best idea to switch to a ketogenic diet while you're still growing. If you do make sure you're at least isocaloric, and getting enough protein.  Download something like myfitnesspal on your phone/computer and use that to track carb/protein/fat intake. Make sure at least 20% of your calories come from protein, and the lower your carbs go, the more you should (relatively) increase protein.  40/30/30 isn't a bad place to start and play around with, and you can choose fat or carbs for the 40%."

You can absolutely wear the CGM longer than the initially recommended 7 days, just stop/start it when it makes you after 7 days leaving it in! I try to go 2 weeks since it's more convenient and the longer it stays in the more accurate it is. 2.

I use tegaderm starting on the first day, and cut it to basically surround the sensor.  The tab that you lift to insert the transmitter into the base sucks in my opinion.  Just push down with your thumb until you hear both sides click.  The tab usually only gets one for me and I manually push the other side in.  You'll become a data junky, which is really good.  Trending helps far more than any amount of finger pricking.  The alarms can be a bit finicky, but the share app helps my wife keep an eye on me and make sure I'm coherent and treating the low.

But last week at a doctor's appointment, my doctor brought it up again and mentioned the office had a unit I could try for a week.  So, I figured, ""Why not?""  I think I fell in love within the first day.  It just made it so much more convenient to quickly get an idea of where my blood sugars were at, and prompted me to take more action to correct them than I normally would.  After I returned the borrowed unit to the doctor's office, I missed my little friend.  :-)  I got the call from Dexcom this morning, and my insurance is covering 90% of the cost after a $250 deductible.

diabetes,3dja2o,mancake,2,Fri Jul 17 04:00:06 2015 UTC,"Here's what I do to keep mine on for longer than 7 days. I trim up the sensor's included bandage, still leaving a centimeter or two around the sensor itself. I apply a little skin-tac around the edges of the bottom of what remains of the bandage, steering clear of the circle where the actual sensor probe comes out. Then, I insert the sensor. While that's drying up a bit, I take a strip of flexfix and cut it to be the same shape but slightly larger than the original bandaging was, cutting out a hole in the middle for the transmitter using an older sensor's plastic housing as the template. Apply this over top of what's already on you and it'll stick for 2 weeks typically.  Remember, its going to force you to do a sensor stop after 7 days, just immediately start it back up again. Or just stop it and start again ahead of time if there's a more convenient time for you. There's a forced 2 hour warm up period between stopping and when you get readings again. It's a hobbyist project, and might not be something you're in to, but it's possible to build an xDrip Reciever to continue getting readings on an android phone during this warm up period. But that's only for when you're going past the 7 day mark, don't try to get readings on a freshly inserted sensor.  Anyway that's a lot of words but hopefully some of them are helpful."

What he means is that your average blood sugar isn't high enough to warrant medication, and you should be able to lower your A1C with lifestyle alone. Really, you should shoot for normal ranges if possible - 7.0 is the threshold for diabetic control, but 6.4 is the point where your average BG level is damaging your body."

diabetes,3dk144,herman_gill,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:15:12 2015 UTC,"He may be referring to the swelling of your lens, which occurs when you reduce your A1C to controlled levels. It seems bass-ackwards, yes, but my opthamologist explained it as glucose flowing into the lens of the eye due to a concentration difference.  It is supposed to go away after several weeks - mine started 2 months ago, and my vision is still worse. Not bad enough to change my life, but TV/games without glasses is a bit annoying. However, some people can actually see BETTER during the lens swelling period.  Retinopathy is a much more serious condition, but if your control hasn't been too terrible then I doubt that is happening. An opthamologist would certainly confirm that your retina is fine, and I'm assuming your eye doctor isn't totally incompetent...  Edit: other commenters are claiming you do have retinopathy. I don't see why the doctor wouldn't just say ""you have retinopathy"" if that was the case."

Went over the schedule of where we'd be docking, and finally determined that there was no way of getting it to me on the cruise itself, so I had it shipped to my work, and picked it up when I returned.  Both Medtronic and Royal Carribean were awesome about the whole thing.  Fortunately, I had backup long-lasting supplies, which I used for a day or two, but after the pump dried out a bit, I found one very small spot on the button that worked (use your fingernail to search)."

(minimed warranty is for 4 years) If so you just need to call them and they'll overnight you a new pump.   If not, there probably isn't a way to fix it if it's a mechanical/electrical issue. If replacing the battery didn't work, I'm afraid you may be out of luck. Taking apart your pump is the last thing you want to do and could end up ruining it.  (or worse, injuring yourself)  The esc button is pretty vital for the pump's menus (and for canceling any alarms) I've had a button quit working before. These things are subject to lots of repeated movements, unfortunately sometimes they just aren't durable enough."

You are not wrong in most of what you say.   Diabetes can't be cured, but it's seriousness can be lessened, sometimes enough that a simple maintenance routine (i.e. diet and exercise) can be employed to sustain said lessening. The duration of this lessening is dependent on the continuation of the maintenance routine as it is a temporary improvement that is conditional. This is called ""remission.""  I am not going to argue this further as it is silly."
diabetes,3dkcj7,irreleventuality,-1,Sun Jul 19 14:57:31 2015 UTC,"You're describing management and incorrectly attaching the label 'remission' to that definition.  Management is active, remission is passive.  The big difference between the example you gave for remission, cancer, and managing diabetes is that managing diabetes requires the patient to actively do so.  There is nothing practical you can do to 'manage' remission of cancer.  If you were really in remission from diabetes you could eat all the carbs you like (otherwise you are not in remission).   I would argue   I am not going to argue    Do make up your mind."

I'm just not gonna do it regularly - but christ, 250g of carbs a day minimum with an A1C of 5.3? Can you do that? Why do you think it's some aberation?   It's honestly tome to stop hiding and consider that weightloss is the #1, bar none, absolute best way to deal with the vast majority of T3 diagnosis. Rather than retard your body's insulin production with carb restriction (you know insulin is needed in your brain too, right?) it's both more effective and healthier to ditch the fat.

Some completely wig out if anyone claims to have ""cured"" themselves and managed their metabolic disease combo of T2 and obesity down to norms of weight and BG levels, especially if those folks claim they have normal blood sugar levels in response to eating carbs at a level that in past would spike their levels.  I'm not going to say I'm cured, although my MD used that term on my last visit. I will say that as a T2 I've managed my BG levels to well within norms at all times of day and pre and post prandial events via a low carb, high fat diet (<20g carbs per day), exercise, and no meds. That's led to a resultant loss of 75 pounds and elimination of my need for blood pressure and cholesterol meds. My fasting BG is typically within 0.2 of 4.4 mmol/L, or about 80 in the US scale. I have lately had a couple of n=1 trials where I took in approx 60g of carbs and my BG levels were within non-diabetic norms at the one and two hour mark.  Is that cured, remission or good management? I can't say. I can say I am healthy and my MD is well please, as is the family. And I'm not tempted to go back to my sedentary, obese, carb stuffing ways as I know that will trigger the whole metabolic issue again as the pounds pile on."

I'm not only off all meds, but my body's ability to metabolise carbs is basically normal - I eat whatever I want, don't spike high, and return to a good baseline very quickly. Still suffering from some residual insulin resistance (in my opinion) but I quit smoking over three months ago, and between that and exercise my body has never been better! BTW, current A1C of 5.3 :)  Search ""I'm gonna cure my diabetes"" on this subreddit for my story (I was doing a daily blog during my most significant weight loss) and check out the folks at diabetes.co.uk and their forums for a lot more success stories. You'll eventually come across the Newcastle study - read it and live it, it's a blueprint to a diabetes free life. While every single T2 diagnosis cannot be ascribed to being overweight, the vast majority can, and losing excess fat (specifically visceral fat, but that can't specifically be targeted) is a clear roadmap to sanity.

There's only one way to describe for someone who deliberately tries to get diabetics to fail and that's: complete and utter scum.

""At the Intensive Dietary Management Clinic we treat many people with type 2 diabetes.  Patients often come to our clinic with two ‘facts’ established in their minds.  The first is that type 2 diabetes is a chronic and progressive disease.  They are often told that they will have the disease for the rest of their lives and they should get used to it.  Actually, it is not true at all.  Type 2 diabetes is an entirely curable disease.  However, taking medications will not cure the disease.  Only dietary management has a hope of reversing diabetes."""

diabetes,3dgev0,badgerpapa,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:15:57 2015 UTC,"But I like how the Vibe will auto-populate your bonus dose. (Right?)   Sorry, it doesn't. I believe the Medtronic does if you use their CGM but you still have to manually enter your BG in the vibe (i.e. look a the CGM trend graph, note the value, navigate to the bolus area and enter the value noted earlier).   There is actually very little if any information shared between the CGM portion and the pump portion of the vibe. I think the only real value of the ""integration"" is in the number of devices one must carry."

Then once you've entered that info, with the Ping, you have to start at 0.00U and push up until you get to the recommended Total. I heard the Vibe will automatically dial is up to the Total and you can change it if you want. (So if my BG and Carbs call for 3.10U of insulin, instead of going from 0.00U and pushing the up button until I get to 3.10U, it will automatically start at 3.10U.)"

diabetes,3dk52s,amoralism,3,Sat Jul 18 02:20:58 2015 UTC,"I'm well aware it's not the current recommendation. Just about every single one of us here has had to fight that terrible advice from dietitians. Low carb, whole grain makes diabetes very hard to control by causing large blood glucose spikes from the excess carbs.   Non diabetics don't see how hard it is, they just think that all these obese t2s must just be lazy about their control and overeat. Truth is that most diabetics are trustingly following this misguided diet advice and wondering sadly why they can't control their blood sugar (and many don't even know what it's doing to their blood sugar due to the general lack of home blood glucose testing support for t2s). The percentage of diabetics with hba1c in range is something like 15%... And no wonder, with the official diet recommendations and lack of testing to show its effects.   From the 1800s to the 1980s the medical establishment knew what diet was appropriate for diabetics - basically avoid carbs like the plague. The low fat craze is relatively new, and in fact, correlated with the diabetes epidemic because it encourages overconsumption of carbs to replace calories from fat. The newer research has shown that low fat diets are not in fact associated with a reduction in cardiovascular disease, and that low fat recommendations were based on flawed science and should never have become dietary guidelines.   I'm about to sleep but I'll see if I can find some links for you tomorrow. It's all out there if you want to do some CPD yourself though ;)"

Gathering knowledge of the subject under discussion is usually wise before commenting on it.   What standards are out-dated?    Before I answer that directly, tell me the answer to this question in your capacity as an RD.  A newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic is referred to you by the doctor. The patient has an HbA1c of 8.5%, fasting blood glucose of 8(144), BMI of 29, leads a sedentary life and eats the standard American diet. The patient has not been advised to test or get a meter and knows nothing about diabetes, carbohydrates, protein and fats beyond what they have read and heard in the media.

If you would like advice on controlling your disease, I suggest you visit a credentialed RD. We don't go through rigourous training to BS you.

What she showed me for a meal plan was more than I usually ate at any meal; I would have gained weight following her suggestions.   FWIW, I am overweight. At the time I was diagnosed, I was carrying about 50lbs extra. I am currently at 80-120 carbs/day, which is a pretty comfortable level for me. I am losing about 2lb/week, which is sustainable. As of today, I am about 35lb/over my target.  Excuse a short rant: I found the dietician very condescending.

It was so weird, I didn't get answers to any questions that I had at all. Like, what exactly I was shooting for in terms of BG levels, whether it was more important to maintain a certain level over a long or short term.

diabetes,3dglgx,clearlyjoyful,3,Thu Jul 16 02:46:09 2015 UTC,"I'M NOT A DOCTOR (but been pumping for 14 years and make the majority of my own corrections)  When I was a kid my doctor always insisted on fixing the night before anything else (safety wise this makes sense, and not having to chase sugars after night lows makes sense).  Are you using a CGM? If not and it's a possibility, get one, it'll be a life saver.      Are you going low at the same time each night? If so, then your basal is slightly too high about an hour or so before you're going low. I won't go too far into this since you should be consulting your doctor for this stuff, especially if you're new to pumping. Figure out what time you're going low and ask your endo what change you can make. (He should change this in very small increments). - If you MUST do this without your endo, make very small changes, and only 1 change at a time. (in this case if you're going low before midnight, but not before 10, I'd decrease basal by .05 at 11pm, for just a couple hours. You may need more insulin in the early hours of the morning due to dawn phenomenon. If you still go low, another .05. If the time you go low simply scoots back, then you know you need to lengthen the time you have the lower basal.)  After the change watch it for a couple nights and see if a new pattern appears. You may shift in the time you go low, or you may spike high, the reaction will tell you and your doctor what your next step should be.  Once your night time is fixed you can more easily fix day time levels.   Expect to see a lower basal rate while you're sleeping at night, and a higher one upon waking in the morning. (Dawn phenomenon is a real thing).  Making sure your insulin to carb ratio is correct is also crucial to getting basal rates right. It can be easy to mistake the effects of one for the other.   Write stuff down, and track it. Find the patterns and ask your endo what to change. If you eat a snack before bed, then make it consistent. Same thing, same amount, same bolus (make sure your carb ratio is correct) anything different will have a different effect on the patterns.   If you need to, wake a couple times in the night to check so you know if you're bouncing around or not.   If you like to read: ""Pumping Insulin"" is a very helpful book"

diabetes,3dglgx,takes22tango,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:33:04 2015 UTC,"My general rule is to make changes of 10-15% at a time, and see what happens - easier to dose more if you have a high overnight than eat at 2am!  Try setting your pump to lower your basal between 10pm and 6am to say 0.9 or even 0.8) and test.  If you're still going low, go down another 10% - if not, creep back up slowly to the right range.  Once you've got the night-time results reasonably on track (don't go for perfect just yet!) work on your daytime basal rates. the easiest way to do this is to test, skip a meal (or eat a small, no-carb meal) and test again before the next meal. If your levels have crept up, put basal up, if they dropped, lower it.  Do this a couple of times for one part of the day, then repeat for the other parts (breakfast, lunch, dinner etc). You may end up with 4-6 different basal rates across the day - this is pretty normal for most people.  Once you've got close to normal, go over the whole night-time and daytime process once more - since changing your levels during the day will affect nights and vice versa, you might find that you need to have a second round of tweaking to balance things.  Good luck! It can be a lengthy process to get the numbers ironed out, but once you're there, it's completely worth it!"

I'm definitely going to try decreasing the overnight basal and see what's happening there."

And don't feel bummed if you get it all perfect for a while and things change.... My night time for a long time was a perfect line right where I wanted it to be, then randomly the past couple weeks I've been going high right at 8pm and 5 am.  Reliably.

The reason that glucogels say to smear inside the cheek in their instructions is that this can aid swallowing in people who are so low they can't swallow properly.

diabetes,3df3d8,dwightnight,2,Thu Jul 16 01:43:07 2015 UTC,Glucose goes straight into your blood after passing your intestinal tract.  Fructose metabolism is done by the liver and is not good for treating acute  lows.  Plain sugar and almost all sweets are about 50/50 on glucose/fructose.  Go with almost pure glucose/dextrose candy if you really need it and want to avoid to over-correcting.

diabetes,3df3d8,derphamster,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:04:22 2015 UTC,I used sugar packets for lows all the time when I was younger. They are a really quick way to bring your sugar up and I was told even quicker if you let them dissolve under your tongue. The only problem I ever found was after being in a bag or kit on the go for a while they tend to leak sugar everywhere.

But 90% of the time I'll  be between 100-110.   Edit: I was diagnosed  with type 2 early May. It's  now July and I've  made drastic changes in my diet and lifestyle.

Could you be specific as to the timing of your post-meal tests please? Read this to see why: When to test   So the doc says I need 10mg of Glipizide in my diet. I started feeling the lows, I am constantly mid 40s and mid 60s with this medication. I called my doctors office and asked a nurse about this and I feel like there is a general sense of we dont care, so they're not helpful. Should I continue to take glipizide?   I am not a doctor, just a diabetic. This is my lay opinion, not medical advice.  In your situation I would cease the medication until either you receive a direct opinion from your doctor - not via the nurse - or you see a different doctor for a second opinion."
diabetes,3dgong,alan_s,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:36:28 2015 UTC,"Well I'm still in my ""honeymoon"" stage so I test probably too many times. Maybe like 4-5 times a day. Once first thing in the a.m. when I open my eyes. Once after lunch because lunch is the meal I don't  take metformin with. I would say it's  like 45 minutes to an hour after I've  had lunch. Then I normally feel shaky before dinner so I test before and test again like an hour after my meal. Then I test randomly if I feel different, just so I recognize my body and what it means. Lows and highs are still very similar feelings to me unless  I'm  shaking. Then I test like 5 minutes before  an hour of treadmill  time and 5 minutes after. All my readings are very similar besides some mornings I'm  higher and every single time after I run I'm higher (130ish)"

diabetes,3dgb8n,derphamster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:24:34 2015 UTC,"That's great. I was reading about LADA for a while before I learned more about MODY.   I test SO much. Right now I get 200 strips each month, and test about 6 times a day. I was told that I could only do once or twice a day, since I'm not on insulin, but I really like being aware so I can alter when or what I eat. I honestly believe that's why my a1c was so low, since I'm on a much lower dose of metformin than is typically prescribed.   Anyway, do you find yourself delving into research about diabetes a lot? I can't stop myself, even when it's a little over my head."
diabetes,3dgb8n,alan_s,2,Fri Jul 17 01:48:06 2015 UTC,"Yes I do. The more knowledge the better! If I read a news article on some new development in diabetes research I like to hunt down the original papers and read those.   Like you I managed in the early stages to get a 5.4% hba1c through testing and modifying carb intake while on a low Metformin dosage. Don't think I could do that now without being on full keto! (I'm on bolus insulin for mealtimes) I was also told to test 3x a day and ended up doing 7-8x. Definitely would not have got my hba1c down if I had done what they said. The info I found here was really useful, especially Alan_s's test, review, adjust guide.   You're lucky that you get so many test strips. Most t2s have to self fund strips, which is madness in my opinion - so many complications could be avoided if t2s were allowed the same tools for blood glucose management as t1s.  Also,  you may run into resistance regarding having a good a1c. I've been told every time I go in that mine is too low (mid 5s) but as long as you're not going hypo it's fine. Bring meter logs to show them. It's something stupid like 5% of t1 and 15% of t2 that have hba1c under 6.5% so the doctors are reluctant to believe that it's down to good control. Apparently people like us that actually use the test data are few and far between. If you ever feel fobbed off or that the docs don't take your concerns seriously that's probably why!"

diabetes,3dfwyd,lemonfluff,3,Thu Jul 16 16:57:42 2015 UTC,"Low blood sugar causes adrenalin and cortisol to be released.   These are stress hormones as your body goes in to emergency starvation mode to stimulate glycogen release to try to preserve brain function long enough to get food.   Chest pain and/or heart stimulation from these hormones is quite possible.  Also something to be aware of is that hypos and other major swings in blood sugar can cause heartbeat irregularities which sometimes can result in serious health implications. If you get this happen again or regularly then it is well worth telling your doctor and see what they recommend.

It didn't seem to be resulting in a noticeable baldness though, so i wasn't sure what to make of it.. I was concerned though, i figured eventually it would result in baldness, i mean hair can't just keep coming out forever right?  Anyway last year, during a routine blood test from my endocrinologist, he noticed that i was very low on Vitamin D. Since then i've been taking Vitamin D pills, and i haven't been noticing the same amount of hair loss at all...  I did some googling awhile ago and found that Vitamin D deficiency is linked to hair loss, and that it's also quite common, very few people actually realize that they are deficient in it. I'm not sure if it was what was actually to blame for my hair loss, but it's 1.5ish years later and my Vitamin D levels are normal, and i still have a full head of hair...  So what i guess i'm saying is, next time you have a blood test, or see your Endo, ask him/her to check your Vitamin D levels. If you're not seeing them for awhile, i think many places actually offer free Vitamin D testing because of how widespread the problem is, so you may be able to find a pharmacy or something in your area that is offering the service."

Look up ""telogen effluvium"" - it's a temporary hair loss condition brought on most frequently by trauma or stress (combo of high blood sugar + diagnosis stress can trigger it). It has a somewhat delayed effect since it has more to do with speeding up the life cycle of the hairs, so it usually shows up 1-3 months after the trigger. Since you're recently diagnosed, this could fit.   The good news is that it's temporary. It will suck for a few months but I can say that 9 months later my hair looks normal again (and has for a while now). The bad news is there's nothing that can be done for it except waiting it out.

When I did low carb, the first week was wonderful and my sugars were great, however, when your body starts adjusting to the low carb diet, it will start to break down the protein your eating in a way that makes it act like glucose (gluconeogenesis) and your blood sugars rise for sure.  You would still need to be taking a bolus for the non-carby foods.  For me, these spikes were more difficult for me to handle and I was lost on how to bolus for it, so I went back to a moderate carb diet.  If you're worried about insulin resistance, increasing your daily activity can help immensely."

I do best if I keep my carbs under 30 a meal, but not any less than 10.   I've had some insulin resistance since I was a teenager, but that is linked to PCOS.   You CAN get insulin resistance as a type 1 without pcos though.  I assume you've double checked that your insulin is as potent as it should be? Insulin doesn't just randomly denature 100%, it can slowly become less potent.   If it becomes a persistent problem, they can prescribe you drugs like metformin to help with that.

You will have much better control using something like a fast acting insulin rather than a very fast acting insulin. However since you are using a pump then you can customise that. Remember you have two issues here, glugacon secretion due to protein content which is almost like a spike, then you have steady state gluconeogenesis that follows with it"
diabetes,3dg5qt,badgerpapa,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:59:39 2015 UTC,"Yes.  The first week I did low carb I hovered around 100 and it was fantastic.  After that, I started to creep up to 250 or so (I wasn't bolusing properly for the non-carbs), and I felt like I couldn't get it down no matter what.  Then I just started eating more carbs and fully bolusing for the carbs (like 15-20 carbs/meal or snack) and found I was able to control my sugar a bit easier that way, especially since I had more experience with bolusing for carbs and felt like I knew what to expect.    I aim to eat a little over 100 carbs per day.  It's not so low that my body tries to go into ketosis, and not so high that my blood sugars go crazy like they previously were.  For me, I've found a happy medium and I feel like I have more control and typically can anticipate what these levels of food/insulin will do to my body."
diabetes,3dg5qt,scarbeg157,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:31:16 2015 UTC,"Someone will correct me but I'd always assumed that it was a gradual thing. We all have different insulin to catch ratios and they vary by time of day within a person.   Myself, I recently changed the ratio setting in my pump. I don't know of its because if increased resistance or just because I got a dexcom and finally noticed that it was wrong."
diabetes,3dg5qt,scarbeg157,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:42:26 2015 UTC,"When I first went keto my sugars did the same thing. Dropped then raised. I had to up my basal back to where it was before I cut carbs. Also, I started bolusing for protein. I had to play around a bit but I usually take total protein grams, divide in half, and bolus like it was carbs. I have a pump and do a square or dual bolus over an hour or so. Those 2 things evened me back out."
diabetes,3dg5qt,RealNotFake,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:49:38 2015 UTC,"In that case, was it worth lowering carbs, since it didn't  result in lower insulin needs? Did you get other benefits from it? Until I  started having problems I found low carb really improved my overall mood and energy. I guess I  need to find the sweet spot (no pun intended) of low enough but not too low."

diabetes,3dglvv,RiPont,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:17:23 2015 UTC,"(just spitballing)  How's your dental health?  Do you floss?  General stress level?  Exercise level?  Try exercising to the point where you get nice and sweaty at least once a day for a couple of weeks.  Wash your face after, of course.  Some of us need that level of circulation and flushing often, or the skin just gets... stagnant.  Recently change bedding?  Specifically, your pillow cases?  25 is not an unheard of age for significant hormonal shifts.  As diabetics, whenever our general feelings change, we tend to think ""hmmm, my control must be off"" because that is so often the reason we feel blah.  But sometimes it's a bio-shift unrelated to diabetes."

diabetes,3depnw,goeielewe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:15:15 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that I always get better sleep when my BG is rock solid stable at whatever level it's at. But if it's rollercoastering up and down due to either food or improper basal schedule, then I'll wake up feeling more groggy. The point of your sleep cycle that you wake up in can also have a big effect on how refreshed you feel. I suggest you get a CGM and use that to monitor your BG during sleep, and start a sleep log/journal so you can figure out your patterns. What I've realized with diabetes that a lot of times, it's easy to think correlation is causation. You think your high BG's are what's contributing to better sleep but that may only be part of the whole story or not even related.  Ultimately though, I have to be the bad guy and just say you should definitely not be happy with high BG when you wake up - even if you sleep better. The long term damage of the highs at night is going to be a lot worse than a reduced quality of sleep (if that is the case)."
diabetes,3dfguj,summerinphoenix,3,Wed Jul 15 21:19:57 2015 UTC,"For me it was over weeks/months in summer of '96. I was thirsty all the time and peeing so much. My mom told me she thought I was losing weight too. But I was twelve so I didn't really think much of anything. Then in September, shortly after school started, I woke up with a stomach ache and my mom said we were going to the doctor, which I thought was strange for a stomach ache. They did a urine test and then sent me to the hospital."
diabetes,3dfguj,PANDADA,2,Wed Jul 15 22:03:39 2015 UTC,It was over a few months I started feeling bad. I was drinking water and peeing like it was my job. I also didn't have too much of an appetite. Lost about 10lbs. Vision started getting blurry. One day I went to a festival and ate a donut which I later threw up in the parking lot. My dad took me to the doctor and I got tested.

My mom was out of town so my Grand mother was watching me, and I was just very suddenly flu-like sick all weekend.    On Monday, I stayed home sick from school, (again everyone thought it was the flu), and symptoms just progressed.  I was EXTREMELY thirst, and drank a ton of regular, not sugar free grape, kool-aid all day.  (On top of all of the pie and carbs I ate over Thanksgiving...)  I threw up like, more than I ever have in my life. I still have an extreme aversion to nausea now.  I also lost like 20 pounds over the weekend.  So when my mom finally got home from work monday night, she took me to the ER and they were like, 'yeeeeeeah, you totally would've died if you took another hour to get here.'  Mom felt bad cause she waited to take me until after she ate.  She didn't know though so...    They send me to a children's hospital (All Children's St Pete FL) I guess the ER I was at thought the other place would be better for me?), I don't remember the ambulance ride, but the hospital was awesome, they had NES's in the rooms and everything.  A guy in a Launchpad Mcquack costume visited my room once too, which was pretty cool.  I thought hospitals must all be this awesome.  (They are so not.)  Also there was this one nurse, who let me practice giving shots (of saline) on her, and 12 year old me thought she was really nice and I kind of had a little boy crush on her."

I remember how bitter the Chinese medicine was when they mixed it with water. It came in a red container. I remember hearing my mom talk to my dad in Chinese, mentioning that it was probably time they took me to the hospital. Lastly I how sad my parents looked in the hospital and how scared I felt. I remember the feeling of someone strapping my arms down because I kept thrashing, but more importantly, I remember the fear.

Had a full day of sledding and eating maple syrup on snow(don't know the proper term in English). ~15 minutes after eating (a lot) of maple syrup, my legs cramped up, completely. I remember that I was in so much pain! It felt like my muscles were compressing around my bones. I was almost paralyzed. I had no idea what was happening. It died down after a while but my parents were worried.  My dad drove me back home and called up my aunt, which is also diabetic, to test my blood sugar. I was at 29 mmol. I can remember the look on their faces, they all looked so worried! I was just there and I had no idea what was going on. They told me they would bring me to the hospital. I was scared, i started crying. I didn't want to go. I kept saying that I would be alright, that we don't need to go. Of course we went to the hospital that same night.

He had an ear ache and I made an appointment with the doctor to see if he had an ear infection - appointment was December 22, 2014.   While we were there, I asked the nurse if she could check him for a bladder infection too (I didn't really think he has a bladder infection, I was just expecting her to see the dark urine and tell him he needed to drink more water - my son actually listens to nurses!).   The nurse got some urine and the doctor came in to check out the kids ears. Next thing I know, the nurse pops her head in the door and asks ""Is he diabetic?"" and I'm like ""No?"".  The sugar in his urine was off the chart on the dip-stick (and oddly enough, no ketones at all), so the doctor was telling us that we should leave her office and head to the ER at the local children's hospital. I was trying to convince myself that this was just a fluke - he never eats sweets, but I had been baking Christmas cookies and he had been eating cookie dough all morning....  The nurse came back with a blood meter and tested him - 134. He hadn't eaten in a couple hours, so it was high, but not enough to send him to the ER. The doctor said we could still go to the ER if we wanted or we could just get a test kit, watch him and setup an appointment with an endo ASAP. It was 3 days before Christmas, so we decided to wait and see an endo and try and let him have a somewhat ""normal"" holiday.   She put in orders for a fasting blood test the next morning - which came back at 211. We got a newer blood test kit on the way home and tested him up until the endo appointment. He tried not to eat too many carbs and his sugars were between 180-220.  So, it was pure luck that we found it when we did. If he hadn't had an ear ache, we probably wouldn't have found it until he went DKA. When the endo test his blood in January, his GAD antibodies were at 30 and he was confirmed as a type 1.  Looking back, he was always tired and had become a ibt of an introvert. Totally normal stuff for a 15 yo boy, but also probably early symptoms of his high blood sugar.  We were very, very, very lucky."

Your systolic is high and that means your pulse pressure of 73 is also too high; IIRC it should be less than 50 (PS by edit. I know older papers said 50; Mayo now says 60).

I know that smoking is bad, and I don't hate you for posting that link - it just seems like since I am currently doing diet and exercise and experiencing solid weight loss, my BP will get better regardless of whether I smoke or not. But still, today I tossed out my pack once again and will see how long I can go before getting another one.  Edit: Also, I had no idea that Systolic - Diatolic was a metric.

I get very emotional and feel like I'm hated by everyone.  Also weak strength.  Highs are easily frustrated, just a small but of sarcasm can set me off. Thirst that is unquenchable, even in my sleep I'm drinking water, frequent urination and when it finally goes down in very hungry.  I also tend to get a sort of itchy gross feeling in my skin and light numbing in my lips and teeth.  In sure I'm forgetting some things that I'll try and add later if I remember.  But going from low to high or high to low is an emotional roller coaster.  Low to high I feel shaky and weak still with some serious frustration, high to low I feel extra weak and extra hungry.  Just make sure to count carbs to correct a low, it's too easy to over correct and then have to take insulin to lower it, prolonging the annoyance."
diabetes,3df1zs,cyniclawl,3,Wed Jul 15 19:53:15 2015 UTC,"Feels like shit.  When you're high it's like you blood is made of maple syrup.

I agree with this, plus I feel/hear my heart beat in my head and I feel headachey and kinda anxious and irritable. Feels like my head is sort of floating above my body. I just want to lie down and do nothing.   When I'm low I get tired and headachey as well but a different type. High headache is like a pressure headache and low headache is more like ""I stared too long at a computer screen"" sorta feeling. Then as it goes down I feel weak, and I feel like sighing a lot, then I get a bit shaky and sweaty and that's the glucose tabs point.   When my blood sugar is changing rapidly I hate that feeling. If it's spiking it feels a lot like high blood sugar even if it isn't high yet. If it's crashing I feel dizzy and shaky even if it's not low yet. Bodies are weird!   Edit: watch out for the sneaky ones that don't give warning. I feel 98% of my lows but once or twice I've checked, felt fine but been in the 40s. Never trust feel, and always test to make sure."

My lows are one of two options: 1. lethargic and fuzzy-headed until the shakes kick in, or 2. shakiness, hyper, and heart racing. Oftentimes I can feel my low in my hands and arms before I dip low enough to need to treat - it sort of feels like a buzzing sensation. Highs are pretty much uniform: lethargic and thirsty, peeing a lot, possibly a headache if my bg level skyrockets.   When I was first diagnosed, it was VERY easy for me to tell if I was high/low, which I attribute to my ""honeymoon"" period (if you don't know about this, I'd read up on it). Your child's diabetes may shift once they get over their honeymoon period - the length of this ranges for each person, but I think mine was about 3-4 months."

Glance at it! More convenient and more info than you would ever get from a finger prick. Seeing you are at 80 on a finger prick probably won't prompt any action, but on a cgm you can also see you have been plummeting super fast, you can see that you will be under 50 in just a matter of minutes, it's a huge advantage!   Also being able to see how you actually absorb some of the things you eat and learn how to bolus better for it the next time, seeing a single number 2 hours later really dosnt give you the slightest idea of what's going on in there!"

diabetes,3dfb3j,WithRealLemons,2,Wed Jul 15 22:15:47 2015 UTC,"Pro: Way easier to improve control.  You almost always are able to know what your BG is, (or at least a very close approximation of it).  I'd prob. be dead from all of the lows it helped with today alone.  (I'm having a bad day.)  Less finger sticks, (6-8 a day before the CGM, I only do one every 12 hours now most days.).  You're still supposed to test before you make dosing decisions, because it could be wrong...  But honestly, I dose on it all the time.   But again, you're not supposed to and that could be risky...  Con: The beeping at you at 3AM thing is kind of irritating.  I know I need to get up and take care of it, BUT I'd kind of rather sleep, even if I am at 40...  You can get kind of obsessive about checking your numbers with one.  Some people it adds to the stress of already having diabetes...  Also I was on a Medtronic CGM a while ago and IMHO, it kind of sucked.  Calibrations were every 6 hours, (and every time you breathed sideways it would complain and you'd have to recalibrate).  The Dexcom's seem to be FAR more accurate and just better all around.  I calibrate once every 12 hours with a finger stick and that's it/  I get about 2 weeks out of a sensor too...  YMMV though."
diabetes,3dfb3j,mancake,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:19:34 2015 UTC,"I've had mine for a month or so and really love it. The change that it's made in my control is hard to believe. I used to be in the 300s or higher maybe every other day, lately it's maybe once a week. I've had problems with lows but as I fine-tune my basal rates and carb ratio they're getting better.   For me, laziness was was a big obstacle to good control - i.e. guessing at my blood sugar so I didn't have to go test downstairs etc.  That's not an issue anymore.  Forgetfulness was also a problem. I'd forget to test and frequently forget to bolus. Now testing isn't an issue, and if I forget to bolus I know 20 minutes later when the CGM buzzes instead of hours later when my blood sugar is already crazy.  It's also allowed me to get much tighter control by putting in disproportionately small amounts of effort. Because it's so easy to observe how food affects my bg closely, I've got a carb ratio that actually works for the first time. I'm counting carbs, which I never bothered to do before.  I've also changed my diet because I can see that certain foods make me spike, which I'd never seen before  It's not much of an issue for me, but if you don't feel lows it's a also a huge safety help that might save your life. As an emergency back-up it can even alert your spouse or parents when you're dangerously low so they can intervene if you're really in trouble.  So those are the pros!  The cons are small but real. Check with your insurance, but these things aren't cheap. I'm paying $50/month for supplies and paid $700 for the initial set up. Hopefully you'll get a beter deal.  Having to insert a second thing and carry around a second thing is also a pain. I think it's all worth it, but it's something to consider."

I've had problems with a number of their sensors not working right out of the box.  I'm also a bit flummoxed as to why it's so woefully behind the features of the Dexcom.  The next time I see my doc,  I'm going to ask him about the possibility of switching to another CGM,  even if it winds up costing me quite a few dollars.  It's almost been two years now that I've been using CGM and I really really really like the concept of CGM.  Unfortunately,  the real-world experience of the Medtronic CGM has let me down a bit.

diabetes,3debqc,stakkar,4,Wed Jul 15 16:58:44 2015 UTC,"For lots of diabetics, having a 6.5% HbA1c after being on insulin isn't too shabby.  So basically it's not an emergency.  Think of it this way...  HbA1c is an average measure of how high your blood sugar has been over the past few months.   Your pancreas isn't working as well as it used to.    If  been eating lots of carbs and being sedentary then overall your blood sugar is understandably high because your body isn't able to keep it at normal levels anymore.  Fewer carbs and exercise are proven to reduce blood sugar levels.  So right now before he starts pumping you full of drugs that make you more sensitive to the reduced amount of insulin your body is making, or drugs that squeeze every drop of insulin possibly out of your poor pancreas;  your doctor is trying to get you to change your lifestyle and possibly push the need for those drugs off a good 5-10+ years.  If you don't lose weight, exercise, and eat healthier then you're going to need drugs the rest of your life.  There are side effects for all drugs and if pushing them off down the road should be your immediate goal.  Note:  you could be a super active marathon runner who only eats organic vegetables and nuts.  I'm not your doctor and haven't seen you so this is just my opinion."
diabetes,3debqc,derphamster,2,Wed Jul 15 18:17:15 2015 UTC,"Your doctor is right, this is your chance to fight it and ward off any potential long term consequences of high blood sugar since you've caught this before it got bad. An hba1c of 6.5% says that you definitely have a carbohydrate metabolism problem, so you should act as if you have full diabetes regardless of how borderline it is. This means you need to change your diet, starting now.   If you are young, reasonably fit, metabolically healthy and not obese, you might want to look at getting an antibody test to rule out early LADA (or t1), though at 6.5% hba1c this is not urgent as initial treatment is the same as for t2 - limit your carbs (all carbs, not just sugar) and get some decent exercise in.   Get yourself a blood glucose meter (no prescription required though it can make them cheaper) and start testing at home before and 1h after meals. You should quickly get an idea of what you can and can't tolerate. Hopefully /u/alan_s will soon link you to his blog where he has a wealth of information about starting out diet wise and getting the most out of your meter.

Ophthalmologist (not optometrist) for a check on eye health. Dietician (chat to us about that). Podiatrist, to check feet and also check for neuropathy.

diabetes,3ddcc7,Toomuchgamin,2,Wed Jul 15 17:05:56 2015 UTC,"When you have high blood sugar it can often be an effect off taking too little insulin, and therefore indicate that the body is burning fat instead. When burning fat we get ketones (completely normal), if it gets too high though it can change the body's pH balance and damage organs and so fourth.   My question was regarding diabetics who get DKA despite managing their blood sugar, as you can't send in  more energy in the cells as they aren't in the blood stream in form of glucose. I had some trouble understanding why it would differ in a non diabetic as the insulin levels should be somewhat the same."

I don't think my bg was ever over 180. Because I was eating so low carb, I wasn't taking a lot of insulin and I guess the amount I was taking wasn't sufficient, possibly because of the cold. My understanding (how it was explained) is that injecting insult is very different from naturally producing it and this is why DKA becomes an issue. It's not as simple as ""I'm eating fewer carbs and therefore can get by with less insulin.""   Just my experience so take it for what it's worth."
diabetes,3ddcc7,wumsel,2,Wed Jul 15 12:10:58 2015 UTC,"and quickly went into DKA   Was DKA actually confirmed by blood gas analysis? Or did you just have nausea, maybe with vomiting and some ketones in your urine or blood?"
diabetes,3ddcc7,Wdc331,5,Wed Jul 15 13:00:11 2015 UTC,Yes. It was confirmed during hospitalization.
diabetes,3ddcc7,derphamster,6,Wed Jul 15 17:37:22 2015 UTC,"Mostly because DKA is a direct result of not having enough insulin for the body's basic life function. On a very low carb diet, a person may not be taking much insulin and if the body suddenly needs more (like if you're fighting off an infection), the amount injected might not be enough.   Low carb diets usually have a small amount of ketosis present (and ketones measurable as a result), but this is normal as the body processes fats and proteins for energy, and is not DKA but can cause confusion sometimes.   DKA is not a common result of a low carb diet but rather taking low amounts of insulin."
diabetes,3ddcc7,thefutureofamerica,3,Wed Jul 15 11:32:17 2015 UTC,"I think a more helpful way of thinking about it is that there is a 'tipping point' ketone concentration at which your body can no longer regulate blood pH. If you avoid all carbs and live in ketosis, you're always closer to that tipping point. This isn't necessarily a bad thing - in the same way, a person with tightly controlled BG is always closer to a severe hypo than someone who runs in the 200-300 mg/dL range. It may require more vigilance and attention, but for some people that's a good path to better control and health."
diabetes,3ddcc7,derphamster,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:23:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, I would agree with that. It also can explain why some people never go into DKA with high ketones and some go into DKA with low ketones. Tolerances are all rather personalised."
diabetes,3ddcc7,derphamster,2,Wed Jul 15 14:55:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, that part I understand. Wouldn't a direct result be high blood sugar if the body needs more insulin? You can't inject more insulin if the blood glucose is in range.   I guess I could be misinformed. I watched a clip with a nutritionist talking about food at a university. In the ending of the clip someone ""warns"" about the danger when type 1 diabetics goes on low carb diets, as many apparently ended up in the ICU with DKA."
diabetes,3ddcc7,derphamster,6,Wed Jul 15 11:38:07 2015 UTC,"Well. Are you going to take one video as gospel just because your nutritionist showed you it? I'm sure you're aware that a nutritionist is not a dietitian and does not have the same medically based training and professional standards. Plus, the ""official"" diabetic diet advice to eat lots of whole grains and fruits is peddled by so many ill informed medical staff - it's really frustrating as high carbs make diabetes very difficult to control.   There are tons of people here that are t1 on low carb diets without issue, and it makes management easier. Most of them have hba1c <6.5, so clearly it gets results. No need to go very low carb/keto though - even a medium-lowish carb diet like 100g/day helps and doesn't run into the issues associated with keto.   If you have normal blood glucose and high ketones DKA can still happen (very rare though). In that case you need to eat a bunch of carbs and bolus for them."
diabetes,3ddcc7,lurker_343,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:48:32 2015 UTC,"There was someone in the crowd that warned about it, not the nutritionist. I just wondered if true, how a diabetic compared to a non diabetic could get DKA on low carb diets compared to a non diabetic. I've heard the same statement from someone else and it didn't quite add up. I wouldn't hesitate to go on a low carb diet.   Thanks for the answers. :)"
diabetes,3ddcc7,hellolittlemommy,4,Wed Jul 15 12:02:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, non diabetics don't have this issue because they produce exactly the amount of insulin they need without issue. Lucky bastards :)"
diabetes,3ddcc7,scarbeg157,3,Wed Jul 15 12:27:33 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't a direct result be high blood sugar if the body needs more insulin? You can't inject more insulin if the blood glucose is in range.   The important thing to realize about ketoacidosis is that it really has nothing to do with blood sugar directly. What people mean by ""your body needs more insulin"" is ""your body needs more energy"".   Keto diets basically fill your body with enough carbohydrates to satisfy your basal metabolism. Others have noted that small levels of ketosis are already present in normal keto diets. The danger is when you need more energy, like when you get sick. Your body wants more energy, but insulin levels are so low that even small glucose output from the liver can't be processed into your cells, so instinctively, and very quickly (before BG can even rise very far), your body starts burning fat for energy and starts the quick downward slope toward DKA."

diabetes,3dasfr,OneRedSent,2,Wed Jul 15 04:37:40 2015 UTC,"Well, that's confusing. I put in 6.5% and it converted it to 47.5 IFCC and 7.8 mmol/l. I don't think the 7.8 is meant to be an A1C number. I think it's meant to say that 6.5% A1C indicates an average glucose level of 7.8 (or 140.4 mg/dl) - but I'm not really sure, because that site doesn't explain the calculator very well."
diabetes,3dasfr,alan_s,2,Wed Jul 15 04:42:39 2015 UTC,I don't get the third one either.  DCCT 6.5% = IFCC 47.5mmol/mol. I get both numbers on my lab reports now; UK people usually only see the IFCC number.
diabetes,3dasfr,OneRedSent,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:38:37 2015 UTC,"I think the point is if your A1C is 6.5, your glucose has typically been 7.8 (or 140). Interesting about the IFCC number though, that's one I had not heard of before. I did know about the different units for glucose."

I think my diabetes did contribute to me choosing a career in food--specifically all those years of being on multiple daily injections with NPH and eating super regularly. For years, I ate very regulated meals at the same times, and eating was really boring. Once I got a pump, the world of food opened up in a really big way.

Having a good sense of taste and smell has helped me alot, and I'm also a very adventurous eater who can and will eat anything (as long as my blood sugar permits). I don't think prior cheese knowledge is necessary to starting out at a cheese job--a lot of places hire for customer service skills and train you on the cheese stuff as you go.

Not sure what they even offer, and I really should talk with them (if it's not already too late for the Fall semester).  Have I had any health issues while at Starbucks? If you mean while working on the floor, on the clock? Yes. But, it was insulin pump related, 100%.  I'm actually debating on how to write about it, and it HEAVILY influenced my decision when deciding on a new pump to get.  I started at the end of September, and didn't have a single problem until about April. Couldn't figure out what was happening, or why. Was getting SUPER high one Saturday, and did a shot to correct it. Then, got SUPER LOW DURING AFTERNOON RUSH. Why?  Insulin pump. I couldn't figure it out, but when I realized what it was, I wasn't very happy about it. Other than those incidences, my sugar levels are usually very steady the entire day.  I don't eat/drink much before leaving for work, and I don't eat/drink much while at work, so that helps a lot.

diabetes,3dba0k,imnotcoherent,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:57:42 2015 UTC,"Sure. Right now what I spend most of my time on is helping states find ways to afford long term care for seniors and people with disabilities on Medicaid. States are already having a hard time paying for the costs of this and we haven't hit the biggest part of the baby boom population yet.  Unfortunately many of us will need long term support services if we want to age in the community, but with states struggling to afford this I expect that services will be cut to much less than the little provided now, and will be literally impossible for middle class seniors to access. If you have a disability, you really need to start putting away lots of money for ""medical"" care after 65. Medicare doesn't pay for a lot of what we're going to need and I don't think states will cover enough to keep you at home if you, say, have diabetes and Alzheimer's and need someone to administer your insulin and test your blood sugar during the day. Most care to keep seniors at home is done by families and friends now, but i don't know if I'll have those kinds of unpaid supports available to help. I worry that without money to privately pay for the services we may need to keep us independent as complications arise, we risk struggling at home with inadequate help.  I don't see a cute for T1 coming in my lifetime (but who knows maybe I'm wrong and in 10 years...), but what I'm seeing now is a trend amongst states to limit services because there's a tidal wave coming of aging people who will need help. Since we know we're more likely to need help planning now while we're younger and healthy may make sure that our senior years are dignified, enjoyable and as complication free as possible."

Frankly, I grew up with my family telling me what I couldn't do with my life, and it felt depressing after a while.  I didn't even try applying.  I strongly drifted towards chemistry and biology, and I will say I was very fortunate that I found a new passion just before entering college that did give me new excitement.  I'm currently a food scientist who makes commercial food products for need-state demographics, including diabetics.  Since food is always challenging, I thought, ""Why not make a career re-designing the very thing that we all must face every day?"" And it turns out, there are quite a few diabetics in this field making progress on the things we eat.

A couple years ago, I decided to run my first marathon. I had such an amazing experience and now running is a passion of mine. It had started to become difficult for me to work 9-5 and then do theatre in the evenings. I also have Addison's disease (my body doesn't make its own adrenaline) so long days were really wearing on my body. So I decided that I needed to find a day job that aligns better with my interests. I just started this job a couple weeks ago, but it already feels like a great fit.  I'm not sure if I'll be able to do theatre anymore.

I'm following a low-carb diet (20-50 grams per day) and the highest BHB reading I saw was 7.0 mmol/l, while feeling absolutely fine. (Blood glucose was 84 mg/dl -- I measure ketones about every 2 weeks out of curiosity.)

diabetes,3dbx1d,Davorian,2,Wed Jul 15 10:56:41 2015 UTC,"There is no absolute threshold for ""DKA serum ketone measurement"".  DKA is a state that is associated with a characteristic derangement of biochemistry involving a combination of very high serum glucose in with little to no serum insulin and a severe but insufficient compensatory response (the defining feature of which is obviously ketone release, but there are other knockon effects that contribute to the complications of DKA).  You might also want to look up ""hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state"", which is a thing that can happen to diabetics of similar severity to DKA but is due almost entirely to (extremely) high serum glucose levels.  All of that said, ""mild"" DKA typically presents with a serum ketone level of 3-4 mmol/L.  ""Severe"" DKA can be more than 8 mmol/L."

diabetes,3dbb09,razzberri1973,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:40:31 2015 UTC,"Metformin has several beneficial effects for type 2 diabetes - namely helping the tissues properly use insulin to pull glucose into cells while also blocking glucose production in the liver. It is believed to act on an enzyme called AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK for short) to suppress appetite and regulate the hormones involved in the menstrual cycle either directly or indirectly (via improved insulin utilization). Due to this, metformin along with birth control have become mainstays of treatment for a condition called Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS for short). PCOS is associated with insulin resistance which can in turn lead to Type 2 Diabetes (about 10% of patients aged 18-21 are diagnosed with both, with the percentage increasing with age). Was this your diagnosis when you were 19?  I haven't heard of Invokana directly causing excessive menstruation, but I suppose it could be indirectly involved since it doesn't provide the hormone regulation benefits. Invokana, unlike metformin, hasn't been shown to assist with the hormone regulation at all, and it works independently from insulin. Instead, it works by increasing the amount of glucose removed from the body by the kidneys. It's a good medication for controlling blood sugar in T2DM, but not as useful for PCOS or PCOS-like conditions since it doesn't have the additional hormonal effects and it works independently from insulin.   You mentioned that you've tried metformin but had trouble with it due to GI symptoms. Was it plain metformin? Generic extended release? How about the newer version of metformin ER called Glumetza? Glumetza is currently only available as a brand name medication (no generic version). It was been developed with a newer extended-release technology that prevents the metformin from being released until it is has passed completely through the stomach, so it may allow you to get metformin's benefits without the GI side effects that the generic versions commonly cause. However, since it's currently available as a brand medication only, your insurance may require one of your physicians to complete what is known as a prior authorization process to cover it (basically some additional paperwork that the insurance will want stating that you've tried the generic metformin first). That'd probably be the first place to start.  Another option would be to try other birth control options to get the regulation back under control. Sometimes switching from a monthly OCP (like Nuvaring) to a long-term one (like Seasonique) can cause irregularities for the first 3-4 months, but continuous bleeding for 2 months definitely seems a bit extreme. Without seeing lab values, it'd be hard to make an exact recommendation, but perhaps LoSeasonique may be a start (it's similar to regular Seasonique but has a different estrogen to progesterone ratio). I've heard that the Mirena IUD seems very beneficial if you're not planning to have a baby any time soon. Continue to follow-up with your gynecologist to find the best option.  Due to your age and conditions, you should probably also get your thyroid levels checked. Low thyroid levels could be involved in both the hormone regulation as well as blood sugar maintenance and appetite. They are fairly easy to correct if the levels are off. It might also be worthwhile to check your iron, B12, and folic acid levels as well, to make sure the excessive menstruation hasn't affected them."
diabetes,3dbb09,razzberri1973,2,Wed Jul 15 14:59:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much-you've given me a lot to look into!   I actually called my doctor a few days ago to ask about the extended release Metformin after doing some reading about it, at the time I was taking it I was only aware of the regular kind. I'm still waiting to hear back but I'm sure that she would help with the prior authorization.  I know that if I could tolerate some kind of Metformin, it would be really beneficial. I'll look into getting the Glumetza.  I'll also look into getting my thyroid and other levels checked.   Edited to add: No, I've never been diagnosed with PCOS. I've read about it but I don't seem to have those symptoms, with the exception of insulin resistance."

diabetes,3dang4,JetBlackPanda,3,Tue Jul 14 20:16:41 2015 UTC,"It's my understanding that type 1 is complicated from a hereditary standpoint. Here's some info from the ADA:  Type 1 Diabetes: Your Child's Risk In general, if you are a man with type 1 diabetes, the odds of your child developing diabetes are 1 in 17.    If you are a woman with type 1 diabetes and your child was born before you were 25, your child's risk is 1 in 25; if your child was born after you turned 25, your child's risk is 1 in 100.    Your child's risk is doubled if you developed diabetes before age 11. If both you and your partner have type 1 diabetes, the risk is between 1 in 10 and 1 in 4.    There is an exception to these numbers. About 1 in every 7 people with type 1 diabetes has a condition called type 2 polyglandular autoimmune syndrome. In addition to having diabetes, these people also have thyroid disease and a poorly working adrenal gland. Some also have other immune system disorders. If you have this syndrome, your child's risk of getting the syndrome — including type 1 diabetes — is 1 in 2.    Researchers are learning how to predict a person's odds of getting diabetes. For example, most whites with type 1 diabetes have genes called HLA-DR3 or HLA-DR4. If you and your child are white and share these genes, your child's risk is higher. (Suspect genes in other ethnic groups are less well studied. The HLA-DR7 gene may put African Americans at risk, and the HLA-DR9 gene may put Japanese at risk.)    Other tests can also make your child's risk clearer. A special test that tells how the body responds to glucose can tell which school-aged children are most at risk.    Another more expensive test can be done for children who have siblings with type 1 diabetes. This test measures antibodies to insulin, to islet cells in the pancreas, or to an enzyme called glutamic acid decarboxylase. High levels can indicate that a child has a higher risk of developing type 1 diabetes.

diabetes,3dang4,2young2go,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:45:14 2015 UTC,Acne can be made worse by high blood sugars. I developed acne for a while before I was diagnosed and it cleared up once I got good control (mid 5s hba1c). If you're already in good control (mid 6s or less) it's probably not that. Chat to your doctor if it's getting you down. There are treatments that you can try.
diabetes,3dang4,derphamster,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:49:23 2015 UTC,"I posted a thread about the type 2 polyglandular syndrome the other day. I found that the markers they typically use to diagnose this syndrome is through adrenal and thyroid function tests.   It's quite common for type 1's to also have thyroid issues, but I think they just consider it regular autoimmune issues if your adrenal function is normal. If you're curious about whether you have it or not, I encourage you to ask your endo about doing the testing for it, especially if you decide to have kids.  My husband and I have been talking about having them and I came across this. I will be getting tested for it as it would be a deal breaker on biological children, unfortunately. 1 in 100, or 1 in 50, I'd go for it... but 50/50 chance, no way."
diabetes,3dang4,takes22tango,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:10:20 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm primarily pretty good with Google.  Unfortunately, I don't know whether there might be a connection between the autoimmune issues and acne.  All I can say is that I have hypothyrodism, take levothyroxine, and had acne problems long before my T1 diagnosis.  Depending upon what type of acne (cystic or more surface), antibiotics might be the only true answer.  That's what kept my in check for years.  Now, I wash daily with AcneFree face wash and use a cream with benzoyl peroxide in problem areas.  It's a battle I had hoped I'd be long over by now, so I feel your pain.  I think seeing a dermatologist will probably help you figure things out. As far as kids, I'd suggest that you not let T1 be a factor in your decision making process."

Congratulations! Impressive.  I promote this technique to newly diagnosed T2s to help them discover where and when they need to cut carbs: Test, Review, Adjust  It is equally effective when used to discover when and in what portion sizes you can add them back into your menu without excessive blood glucose rises. For example, that is how I discovered I can include fruits such as apples, oranges, pears etc in my menu in half-portions as snacks between meals.  It is also how I discovered some fruits, such as bananas and custard apples, are now fruits I used to eat in a past life."

diabetes,3d9uws,HMNbean,4,Tue Jul 14 17:21:14 2015 UTC,"My experience has been pretty depressing. :(  I was a ""nutritarian"" vegan when dxed and once I acquired a monitor I quickly realized that fruits, grains (even whole grains) and starchy veggies like squash were a problem. It sucks because everything out there talks about these foods as though they are so healthy (which they are, if you can tolerate the sugars in them).  So far my best, or least bad, reactions have been to prunes (dried plums) and starchy vegetables that have been cooked, then cooled overnight (they build up resistant starches) and reheated. However even with these items I need to eat very small portions. Weight loss has made no difference in my tolerance, and at this point I have no more weight to lose without being underweight. Eating proteins with the starchy foods doesn't make much difference either for me.  If you're on medication you might be able to tolerate a wider range of fruits/ starchy veggies. Good luck!"

Berries like strawberries and blue berries are ok for me, I can eat a tone of those with no issues, but they are naturally high in fiber and low in sugars.  Tropical fruits like Mango and pineapple send my BGs pretty high pretty quickly.   One thing to watch out for is dried fruits, the sugar is concentrated since all the water's removed, and it doesn't seem like you eating much when the sugar % is way higher.  I haven't had any bananas since I was diagnosed, but they tend to be pretty starchy, so I figured they'd spike my BGs, but others are reporting no issues there, so I might test those out."

I eat them all day long and my BS stays within range (under 110). Fruits are my go to snack.   I've tried health bars like KIND which is supposed to be pretty healthy. It's made out of nuts and has a reasonable amount of carbs for a snack (well, for me--my snacks are below 30g carbs. I'm not sure what your daily limit is?). KIND bars unfortunately raise my blood sugar. I was at 127 two hours afterwards and I ran before that. I'm gonna try them again and make sure it's the KIND bar because they're super good and cheap!  BTW. By fruits I mean: berries, plums, apples, oranges and peaches. Those are my go to snacks. I haven't bothered to try things like pineapples since I find them too sugary to begin with. I haven't tried testing my BS after a banana either. And if I eat an orange or apple for a snack, I usually eat maybe a cheese stick with it since they have no carbs. Oranges and apples have a bit more carbs. I also tend to eat plums by themselves, which may explain why my BS stays normal."

And he's not even consistent in his posts versus his tag: he claims to be following a VLCDiet (Very Low Carb) which is <30g a day (low carb is <120g / day): an orange has 12g, plus the bread in his turkey sandwich by itself exceeds the entire daily limit on a very low carb diet.

diabetes,3daahp,alan_s,9,Tue Jul 14 21:31:43 2015 UTC,I'd strongly recommend you get into an endocrinology practice. You should get a C-peptide and an antibody test to rule out the possibility of being T1.   If you're eating low carb (how low carb?) and taking metformin and your BG is not coming down it might be that you're not making insulin and are actually T1. It's fairly common to mis-diagnose adults (18+ & overweight) as T2 because many doctors believe that adults can not be diagnosed as T1. It happens all too commonly and the results can be disastrous.

Being on insulin soon after diagnosis can apparently help save remaining beta cell function so it might be a good thing if they put you on it.  ""Reverse"" is tricky word. First get your numbers moving in the right direction, then set an achievable goal, maybe fasting < 130.    How do you know your fasting number now? Do you have a meter?

diabetes,3daahp,seaweed88,2,Tue Jul 14 21:23:38 2015 UTC,Make the endo appt for september and also make one for your GP. In the meantime you could go to a walk-in urgicare or the ER. Any time you go over 250 it is potentially a medical emergency.
diabetes,3daahp,pileobunnies,4,Tue Jul 14 21:29:38 2015 UTC,Can you go to A&? You sound like you definitely need insulin and honestly you do not sound like type 2- more like type 1.   If you are type 1 you will not survive till September. Sorry to be so brutal but you will need to see someone within a week or you will end up going to A&E in a coma. I really can't stress enough that waiting more than a week will kill you if you do have type 1. And having type 2 and being that high would be awful for that long.
diabetes,3daahp,derphamster,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:12:16 2015 UTC,"Tell them your symptoms and that Metformin isn't working, you have a blood sugar in the 300s-600s on very low carb and you suspect you might be t1. They will have emergency appointments. From what you've been saying you badly need a test for t1 and stronger medication to get your BG down (probably insulin but don't freak out, you'll feel tons better)."
diabetes,3daahp,reduser80,4,Wed Jul 15 01:20:28 2015 UTC,"Keep a log of what you eat, and your readings before and two hours after eating. Tomorrow, (seriously, don't wait) go to the nearest doctor's office and show them the numbers. They should be able to work you in and get you some help. If not, get them to refer you to someone that can. You may wind up at the ER initially, but at least you'll get help."
diabetes,3daahp,Citryphus,2,Tue Jul 14 19:53:44 2015 UTC,"hi! as others have said- not a doctor- but you should try to keep it at below 30 carbs. Perhaps just meat, , hard cheeses, tofu and non starchy veggies (i.e. no potatoes) for a while. Your numbers are very high, have you explained to the endo's office how urgent it is for you to be seen? You should consider anything with sugar to be poison for the time being.  As far as it being controlled you want to be under 130 fasting and under 180 pp. Bear in mind that anything over 140 is thought to cause permanent damage.  I agree with others that you probably need insulin at this point, but most importantly you must see a dr/ endo asap or even go to the ER. Please keep us updated, your situation is concerning!"
diabetes,3daahp,reduser80,2,Tue Jul 14 21:16:32 2015 UTC,"I'm amazed they started you on that much metformin right off the bat since the side effects often cause them to start low and dial it up over time.  A lot of research points to the advantage of starting T2s on insulin just to get them back into the ""good"" range and then introducing metformin  while easing off on the insulin over a period of weeks/months.  It reduces the damage that comes with high blood sugar while you work out an alternate method of medication.  The reason this insulin approach isn't used more often is because of the training needles require, particularly with the risk of low blood sugars, and people's natural aversion to needles.  I recommend it though.  Once I got over my fear of needles, it worked like a charm."
diabetes,3daahp,rgraham888,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:09:51 2015 UTC,Yeah the ER doc said I needed a lot because of how high it was. It was like having food poisoning the first couple weeks.
diabetes,3daahp,alan_s,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:29:52 2015 UTC,"ER doc sounds incompetent. Metformin does very little by itself, and even less in someone who is not t2. Starting Metformin that high would also definitely throw your digestive system for a loop. Don't trust that doctor, get a second opinion asap, preferably from an endo."
diabetes,3daahp,alan_s,2,Wed Jul 15 01:24:21 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer:  I am not a doctor - seek professional advice.  A few things I know:    Metformin takes a while to kick in.  I think it's only full functional after a couple of weeks.  If your fasting is 340, that seems very high for me to use metformin alone.  From a study I just googled it typically improves A1C by only 1.5%.   340 equates to around 19 mmol/dl.  A 1.5 improvement down to 17.5 mmol/dl still is only 315 which is WAY beyond where you need to be (under 140).  Get to an endocrinologist ASAP.  In the meantime I would pick up a cheap glucose meter (true2go or trueresult at cvs) and keep testing after meals.   Eat low-carb until you can see an endo. (<30g per meal)."
diabetes,3daahp,CthulhuLives69,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:06:24 2015 UTC,"A1C is a percentage, not mmol/dl. An average glucose of 340 corresponds to an A1C of (340 + 46.7) / 28.7 = 13.5%."

All my experience, techniques failings and successes have amounted to a HBA1C I'm very happy with and limited hypo's. I can't say that this approach will translate to a child and I'd want to figure that out.   Knowing upfront whether my child is at risk, and therefore that I should be vigilant for T1 symptoms is a no brainer. I have an identical twin without T1 and no antibodies so who knows whether genetic factors were at play for me, but knowledge is power and I'll base my fears off fact rather than misplaced concern."

Diabetes isn't high on the list of things I worried about when my children were small, but neither were Scarlett Fever and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. However, the older caught one and the younger caught the other. There were the usual cuts and bruises, a couple of broken bones (the older is a bit of a klutz and the younger is a bit more adventurous), but anything that can be tested for and treated is not the biggest worry. I used to sit by the crib and just watch them breathe. I worried when they were away from home, and I worried when they were at home but things were a bit too quiet. A special diet, testing, and insulin would just be another part of life."

diabetes,3d8hc1,kpardue,2,Tue Jul 14 09:28:11 2015 UTC,"I  too, briefly switched to U500 due to insulin resistance issues while pumping (I was changing sets every day due to failure because of pushing 200+u through them) and I found that the issues dealing with the activation curve from Regular as opposed to rapid were just too much to deal with. Plus there was the fact that although U500 is ""5x as strong as U100"" it wasn't really that way for me, it was more like 3.5x as strong, and it was VERY, VERY hard to get the balance of basal and bolus correct because moving by .05u was actually moving by .25u.   In the end, I scrapped pumping altogether and went back to MDI. If you don't need the micro basal adjustments that a pump offers, that's something to think about for you. It is entirely possible to be MDI and use a dexcom (it's something I've wanted but neither my private coverage nor health canada will pay for one for me) It's afforded me the same control and none of the issues that I had with pumping (either with U100 or U500). Something to think about also, is that Sanofi is working on introducing a U300 variant of Lantus which I am going to try and get on when its approved by health canada. Truth be told, there isn't any danger to injecting larger volumes of insulin as long as you rotate your sites correctly."

Ate a bunch of stuff, then at like 2am I am like ""well better take that lantus."" That was actually a double-dose of lantus, which I deduced as the whole following next day was a nightmare of biblical proportions.  My sugar just kept dropping and dropping, I ate huge meals without bolusing just trying to keep my sugar up in the 100s. I drank chocolate milk with these no-bolus meals, never got above 130. Also gave a speech to 300 people that day.  As I walked off the podium (beelining for my meter) some guy was like ""Great talk!!""  That is actually one of my proudest moments, I had fucked my diabetes up sooooo royally YET I had still done what I traveled 1000 miles to do and did it well even!  Moral of the story - don't double dose your lantus, it is worse than an over-bolus!  I love these threads where I can see that I am not the only one who screws this stuff up sometimes.

One for rapid, the other for long acting. What colours have they chosen for the options? a dark green and a reddy purple. Like hell, come on guys what were you thinking. Which two colours look the same under low lighting? red and green. Which two colours are the most problematic for colour blind people? red and green.   ~EDIT: Seriously though, this is the mistake that I fear the most. Not some stupid miscalculation in bolus. The sleepy mistake that means I take double my entire daily dose of rapid insulin in one go and then put myself to sleep. Human error... on an infinite timeline it will happen at some point...yay."

diabetes,3d867p,HMNbean,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:42:53 2015 UTC,Thats terrifying.  Keep checking in here.  This is one of the reasons I switched to a pump.  Only one type of insulin is used and it calculates your dosages based on carb intake.  Less room for error.  Even then its still a possibility.  Just the other day my CGM sensor failed and my pumps BS meter read 220.  Did 14u Humalog for my correction and meal.  Checked about 15 minutes later and I read 74.  The pump gave me a bad reading.  Ended up consuming about 24 oz of apple juice and hit a low of 32.  Took me about 4 hours to get my BS above 100.  I hope your username isn't prophetic.

After the first time I injected 40 units of Humalog instead of Lantus I got separate pen cases for each of them.  Humalog in a green case and Lantus in a black case.  I never mix them up anymore no matter how tired or out of it I am.

(As a side note - goals are GOOD, but make sure they're realistic.)  I really think you should think about talking to a Psychologist - someone who specializes in Diabetes preferably - about how you feel.  You have so much anger and frustration that dealing with it yourself might be too difficult...  Shit.   I don't know what to say, other than good luck - we're rooting for you :)"
diabetes,3d7vz3,Fafnr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:35:31 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear what sounds like real determination on your end. I was almost exactly in your shoes: diagnosed with type 1 at 13, optimistic for a few years, and then had some serious coping issues in high school/college combined with a1cs in the 8-9 range. I don't think I was as aware of my issues as you are, but I did break out of it and regularly keep my a1c close to 7 now. Not only that, but I'm going back to school (I'm 27) to switch careers from finance into something that will progress diabetes care/healthcare. Only you can power yourself through this journey but i do have some tips that helped me:  1. Get involved in the community. Jdrf YLC or something close by. It helped give me a sense that I was not alone in my struggle and I wish I'd done this sooner. 2. Don't be afraid to talk about your issues occasionally with friends. I have also only recently started doing this but the more I own my diabetes and open up to others the more connected I feel. I warn them when I'm running really high so they don't take my grumpiness personally. 3. Track ALL THE THINGS. Data is your friend. I use myfitnesspal to track my food intake and mysugr to track blood sugar levels/insulin dosing. I also use a Fitbit. I find food, insulin, and activity level are the biggest factors in getting my dosage right. 4. Related to point 3, I highly recommend a CGM as a first step over a pump. I've been on it for 4 months now and I still use pens. Going in a few weeks to see if my a1c is down, but I'm 100% more comfortable running at 90-120 overnight now knowing my CGM will wake me if I'm getting too low. The additional data will also help you fine tune your dosing. I figured out I need 2x the humalog at breakfast vs lunch. I still have my bad nights but they are far fewer now. Best of luck, please reach out with any questions. You can do this!!!"
diabetes,3d7vz3,BostonRoots,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:26:44 2015 UTC,"A few things come to mind after reading your post.   First of all, I am so very sorry that you have had such a hard time. I was diagnosed at 22 and I have said a million times that if I was ""destined"" to have it, I am so grateful that I did not have it in childhood. We are all a little lucky to get through adolescence in one piece and having to deal with diabetes on top of it all is just too much to ask of a kid. It is just plain unfair and I am sure you are tired! I am, however, very glad that you spoke up here. We definitely understand.  I agree that goals are great and I also agree that goals should be realistic. I have had times during the last 20 years (some not so long ago) where I have been so far down the hole that I had to completely readjust my goals to daily ones. So, for instance, instead of even thinking about my A1C, I would set a goal to get all of my readings under 180 for that day. Once I could meet that one, I would aim for the entire week. I had to do it in small steps, one thing at a time. Otherwise I found that I had set myself up to fail and that left me feeling even worse than I did before. You may want to try that, too - one goal for the day and when those don't feel challenging anymore, kick it up to week, etc.   Seeing a therapist is another great idea. I have never tried to find one that specializes in diabetics but that is a fantastic suggestion. I can only imagine how much easier it would be to talk to someone who really gets it. Also, keep in mind that diabetes can cause depression. High glucose leads to clinical depression and it can end up being quite a vicious cycle that is not easy to overcome. Gaining better control (even a little bit!) and talking to someone who is qualified will round the whole picture out so you are getting what you need.   Again, I am glad you reached out. I understand completely. We understand!"

I have a family that cares about me, some good friends and a girlfriend and I'm completely unable to talk to any of them about this shit.  Honestly, finding this community has helped a bit.  I'm still struggling with getting my sugar ""normalized"" but having a place where I can vent about the bullshit I face on a daily basis and have people actually understand what the fuck I'm talking about is pretty great.

diabetes,3d6iug,headshot442,17,Mon Jul 13 22:24:38 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on your good A1C, but since you were so recently diagnosed you're most likely still in the honeymoon period and your BG is helped some by your not quite dead pancreatic cells. Try to focus on the consistency of your blood glucose more than the A1C, since its just an average. My first A1C after diagnosis was a 5.3 but it was because i was honeymooning and low constantly, not my good control. Not trying to lessen your achievement, just trying to say don't put too much stock in your A1C this soon after diagnosis and don't panic if it starts going up after your honeymoon is over. Just remember it's all about consistency. Keep up the good work man :)"

diabetes,3d6iug,abbh62,4,Tue Jul 14 00:52:09 2015 UTC,"You are absolutely correct. It's refreshing to hear this coming from a fellow recently diagnosed diabetic rather than jaded veteran diabetics like myself. I'm so glad that honeymoons exist, as they help ease people into the life, but it really is not all peaches and rainbows for very long (though with more recent developments in technology and diet recommendation it's loads easier than it used to be). This is a HARD disease to manage well Anyone who says otherwise is either lying or a robot. Some do have a more difficult time than others, but no one has it easy. (sometimes when newbies come in here and exclaim how easy it is, it feels a bit like they're rubbing all the years of very difficult work in our faces.)  Also excellent advice on the A1c. You can have massively swinging numbers and a pretty A1c, but that does not mean good health. 6.5 with few fluctuations is indeed better than a 5.2 with loads of lows and highs.  OP, keep up the excellent work! Take advantage of the knowledge we have now and get ready for the longest marathon you've ever run cause it's definitely a trip. It's awesome that you're taking diagnosis and this disease by the horns and owning it. Don't get discouraged when things change (insulin levels will ALWAYS need adjusting, even just when you know you just got them perfect) My advice is to become an information sponge. Learn as much about the science of the disease and about your body as you can, so you can be your best doctor! You will have some excellent days, and some really crap days, but as long as you get up and start tomorrow fresh you'll do good!"

Having good control is important though, but like you said if you go out even once a month or so, its one night out of 30 days, it's not going to have a huge impact.  Although like u mentioned I don't enjoy getting black out drunk like my friends, I'll usually have a couple, get a little buzzed and enjoy the night without making a fool of myself, or throwing up when I get home! I enjoy alcohol more in small doses because you don't get the negative aspects."
diabetes,3d8lri,hockeyplaya9810,2,Tue Jul 14 11:37:59 2015 UTC,"I'm type 1, so i'm not exactly sure how how this translates, but my endocrinologist advised me that the alcohol will naturally raise your blood sugar and burn off on it's own. Even if you drink carb free/low carb alcohol, you'll notice an increase in bs so be sure not to over-compensate with insulin because otherwise you can find yourself having a low a couple hours down the road."
diabetes,3d8lri,Baeker,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:40:43 2015 UTC,Does diff types of booze affect you less like vodka vs bourbon vs beer?  Assume alcohol is alcohol and more ingrediants they add to it?  Im partial to bourbon.
diabetes,3d8lri,byikes,2,Tue Jul 14 11:41:53 2015 UTC,"I haven't noticed any substantial difference.  I mostly drink vodka with a non-caloric mixer, like diet soda or sugarless Red Bull.    Sweet sugary drinks are a different matter of course."
diabetes,3d8lri,Kerackiswhack,2,Tue Jul 14 13:45:03 2015 UTC,"It absolutely does, beer is equal to eating bread so if your going to drink one with friends make it a good one.  Hard alcohol like vodka/bourbon don't raise you blood sugar but their mixes do so keep them carb free.  Drinking to much can suppress your liver from releasing the sugar it normally would that night and your fasting blood sugar can be bit lower."
diabetes,3d8lri,byikes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:44:33 2015 UTC,"This really depends on the type of beer.  I LOVE Guiness but yea, that's like eating a grilled cheese sandwich.  I switched to Michelob Ultra, which essentially tastes like my light beer of choice Coors Light, and it has a negative effect on my BS, as in, it lowers it.  Even drinking two doesn't raise it.

diabetes,3d8lri,krbin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:21:50 2015 UTC,I'm type 2 and drink moderately. I would avoid beer if possible as it's quite high in carbs and has twice the calories as spirits. Spirits have 0 carbs. I usually have red wine (~5 carbs per american standard) or spirits in a sugar free or artificial sweetener mix.  I've tested with the monitor after drinking and it never has much impact. The biggest danger for me is that if I get too buzzed I'll reach for foods I shouldn't (I'm so far diet controlled type 2).   Make sure to get a full metabolic panel each year to check liver enzymes.
diabetes,3d8lri,alan_s,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:04:57 2015 UTC,"The drop from alcohol occurs many hours later, when you have nothing in your stomach and your body switches to fasting mode (the alcohol prevents glucose production by the liver). You're unlikely to go low while at the pub. Otherwise you're spot on about choosing low carb options. There's always a few options. If you were type 1 you could also have craft beers since you could take insulin for it.  That said, are you sure you're not type 1.5? Have you been tested for antibodies?  Also, ask about switching to lantus from protaphane. I was using protaphane when I was diagnosed some 17 years ago, it's super old school and not very good."

diabetes,3d7ses,mastercheif,2,Tue Jul 14 18:24:17 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend is T1 and she just got her dexcom in 3 weeks ago. We went last week and got matching Apple Watches to use in conjunction with the share and follow apps on our phones. The iPhone app is absolutely flawless, as long as the receiver is getting a signal from the sensor and the receiver is in range of the iPhone, both the share and follow apps are about 95% successful in transmitting the info for both apps. Sometimes the follow app will drop a few readings here and there but it's usually nothing too serious. The Apple Watch is a different story. I don't know why, considering the Apple Watch app is literally just another interface for the iPhone app, but we have been having lots of dropouts on the graph on both the share and follow apps. I would say the share app accurately posts about 80% of its info to the watch while the follow app is closer to 70%.   While we have been having issues with the Apple Watch, it's convenance factor is a real game changer. We were walking back from the park after a short run, and low an behold about halfway there we both simultaneously got an urgent low notification pushed to our wrists that she was 65 and dropping. She popped in some glucose tabs and we cheered to the future."
diabetes,3d6ygh,Sunnydata,2,Tue Jul 14 00:26:37 2015 UTC,"Jenny and I agree on most things.   However, I can see that the blood sugar 101 website has a great deal of data indicating cancer, heart disease, cell death above 7.9 mmol (140).   One point we disagree on is the implication that every spike is doing you permanent damage; although I note her page on the subject no longer says it that way. I believe that the damage is repaired provided we don't exceed good targets too often or for too long.  We both originally followed the blood glucose targets suggested by a friend on alt.support.diabetes. They are listed here and are much tighter than your Canadian guidelines: Test, Test, Test. Note the timing; one hour is more likely to be your peak than two hours. Also note Jenny's comment and my reply at the foot.  Please also read this: Getting Started.  PS   I am most of the time, but feel terrified when I am not - for example tonight I followed my diabetic diet book and ate 1 home-made turkey burger in half a pita with tomatoes and cheese and my reading two hours later was 9.8 (180)!   Being terrified is not very helpful. Don't be alarmed at numbers like that, instead be educated. Learn from them to minimise recurrence."
diabetes,3d6ygh,alan_s,2,Tue Jul 14 01:27:42 2015 UTC,"My doctor told me to have check 2-3 hours after meal and correct if I was higher than 180. I did that for 3 years. About 4 months ago I got a CGM and was able to actually see which foods spiked me much more and which didn't. I usually spike within 1-1.5 hours. With CGM/Prebolus/Low carb diet I am able to achieve spikes of no more than 140-150 for about 75% of my meals. With diabetes a number of factors can make you go high (temperature, stress, time of day, recent exercise, etc). If you have an insulin pump I would suggest you try to talk to your doctor and see if you can tweak your basal rates"

I sometimes test at 1 hr, especially with something new, but I've found that if you're under 140 at 2 hrs, you can assume your 1 hr level was probably not too bad.  I like and learned a lot from Jenny's site but I follow the <= 140 @ 2 hrs guideline from the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists. I don't think current evidence supports the effort to pinpoint peaks or keep them under 140. Even non-diabetics will peak over 140.

Any DIA you put in is going to be a guess and a round number. 4 hours is a very conservative guess (i.e. your pump's bolus wizard will constantly predict that your son's BG is going to continue dropping based on previous boluses) and that's fine.

You have to have a well calibrated basal for it to work, because the only way you can tell when your bolus has stopped working (ie the end of the curve) is to have your basal rate flatlined. If your basal is too high, your blood sugar will keep dropping even when the bolus expires; too low, and it will flatten out before the bolus is done.   When I had my blood sugar readings flat lined for more than 4 hour stretches, I just took a corrective bolus and watched when my blood sugar leveled off. That told me the length of my insulin curve and the points:unit for that time of day (I am more resistant in the morning)  But seriously, work through this with your sons doctor or educator."

Baked salmon and asparagus is really good. Baked/grilled chicken, zucchini, squash, onions are great, too. Watch out for sauces and dressings with sneaky high sugars and carbs. Once you get it under control, and once you start psychologically coming to terms with your new diagnosis, ease into other things outside of meat and veggies.

Only answer if you are comfortable doing so.    What symptoms caused the hospital visit? What meds, if any, were prescribed at the hospital? Do you know what tests were used to prescribe your diabetes? If so, what were the numbers? Did they tell you to get a blood glucose meter? If not, let us know your country and we may be able to help you decide what to get. Also check your insurance cover for test strips for the meter. How old are you? Do you need to lose weight?   Yeah, I know, I'm nosey. The answers will help others offer good suggestions to help you."

But I live in the USA, so I have access to just about whatever I need online. I have an appt with my primary physician this Wed, I will be asking Loads of questions! I am currently taking 500mg metformin per day. I'm 32 and I don't need to lose weight (5'10' - 165 lbs)"
diabetes,3d60sx,MintyFresh88,3,Mon Jul 13 22:42:19 2015 UTC,"A couple of points to add to the other responses.   My BG this morning was 468...I'm 32 and I don't need to lose weight (5'10' - 165 lbs)   Although a significant number of new type 2s are young and slim that tells me you should be tested for type 1 to be sure. The specific tests include at least c-peptides (that is not insulin, but is an indicator of your insulin production) and antibodies. If you are type 2 the info I gave you in that link will be useful, but if you are type 1 you are going to need insulin.  I am not a doctor, just a diabetic, but I am rather surprised in the circumstances that you are on metformin right now instead of insulin.  Discuss all those points with your doctor on Wednesday.    The doctor didn't recommend I get a meter immediately.    Terrible advice. I echo the others: get a meter right now."
diabetes,3d60sx,derphamster,2,Tue Jul 14 01:15:45 2015 UTC,"No peptides? Maybe that was the anitbodies test. There should be a number related to the c-peptide test. When your pancreas produces insulin it also produces 'c-peptides.' The c-peptide test indicates the functionality of your pancreas with regard to insulin. This is pretty important. Not to beat around the bush; this is what determines if you're a candidate for insulin. If you don't make (enough) insulin, all of this academic conversation is rather unimportant. We're not doctors (one might hopefully chime in), but we've all seen some stuff.   Edit: Uhm... you need a meter, now. The target 'Up and Up' meter is reliable and the tests (strips) are cheapish. It works out to about $ .40 a test.  http://www.target.com/p/up-up-blood-glucose-meter-monitoring-system/-/A-15723790#prodSlot=medium_1_2&term=glucose+monitor  http://www.target.com/p/up-up-blood-glucose-test-strips/-/A-13099404#prodSlot=medium_1_2&term=glucose+test+strips"

diabetes,3d60sx,Citryphus,4,Mon Jul 13 23:29:16 2015 UTC,By peptides did you perhaps mean ketones? That might explain why the doctor thought you were low risk.

diabetes,3d60sx,susinpgh,3,Tue Jul 14 00:23:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah totally understandable! Ketones are a result of the body switching to alternative fuel (fat/proteins) because a lack of insulin means the cells are not getting energy from glucose and they think that you're starving, even though your blood is pretty much syrup. This usually happens in t1, though not exclusively. If you have too many ketones your blood turns acidic and causes major problems (life threatening). The main signs of this are feeling very unwell, vomiting, passing out and a smell of acetone/nail polish remover around you. If this happens, go straight to ER asap, but it's unlikely to happen so don't get too freaked out!  If they tested for ketones already and you had none, that means you still produce enough insulin for basic life function. That means you're low risk yes, but you do need to get further tests done to get your type confirmed as treatments differ between them."

My son's endo had boxes of meters and strips to hand out.   If money is an issue, you might want to wait. Your doctor may give you a specific meter then their clinic wants you using (doctors have software specifically for downloading the data and maintaining it in their software systems).  Ask your PCP for a GAD test to see if you are Type 1 or Type 2. Treatment is very different between 1 and 2 and contrary to much of the information out there, adults do get Type 1."

diabetes,3d60sx,A_Single_AID,6,Mon Jul 13 21:26:10 2015 UTC,"Are you certain that it's type 2 diabetes? Were you in the hospital for something unrelated or for high/low blood sugar? Are you on insulin or any kind of related medication?  I'm asking because sometimes type 1 is misdiagnosed as type 2 and the consequences of a misdiagnosis can be drastic. Did the doctors perform a C-Peptide and antibody test to rule out type 1?  No matter what happens, no, not all sugar is poison. The key is moderation, exercise, and appropriate dosing of your medication. You can still have whatever you want (in moderation) once you understand how your body reacts to certain foods, and you understand exactly how to apply your medications.  It's a bad disease, but it's completely manageable. Stay on this sub, and do your research. Before you know it, good management habits will be second nature. Hang in there!"
diabetes,3d60sx,susinpgh,6,Mon Jul 13 21:02:07 2015 UTC,"/u/virus5877 this is important. Your age and the fact that you're not overweight mean that you need to get t1/LADA ruled out. This is done with a simple blood test for antibodies and a c-peptide test to measure how much insulin you're making.   Most non specialist doctors see 95% type 2 patients and many don't have the knowledge or experience to deal with t1 in adults. This means that many people in their 30s and 40s (though not only this age range) are misdiagnosed as type 2 due to these important tests not being done. This is especially so with LADA (aka t1.5), a slow onset form of t1 that usually shows up around your age. It usually presents initially without significant ketones so it does not ring t1 alarm bells for most doctors. Usually the misdiagnosis is discovered only much later, when the patient can no longer produce any insulin at all.   Try to get a referral to an endocrinologist who will have the best chance at helping you. You'll be dealing with this for life so make sure your doctor is competent and clued up on the latest research info etc. Make sure you also get a meter. Trying to manage diabetes without one is like trying to drive a car while blindfolded. Don't let the doctor put you on anything other than Metformin or insulin without getting your diagnosis/type confirmed with tests.   Meanwhile low carbing will help no matter your type. Remember especially not to drink sugar! All natural sugars like honey are the same as refined sugar to your body so diet soda only from now on, and use cream in your coffee instead of milk.   Do hang around and read a bunch of threads here. There's a wealth of information to be found, and the more you learn the better equipped you'll be to kick diabetes' ass!."

It is what the ADA told us for decades. History has shown it to be unwise.    Our primary tool for type 2 blood glucose management is sensible selection of a menu which does not cause excessive blood glucose spikes. Meds should be used to aid a good T2 way of eating, not to combat a poor one."

Your liver dumps glucose in your blood stream just before you wake up as a ""jump start"" for your energy level. Sadly, for us Type 2's, it doesn't work that well. As for the post-meal number, that will always depend on what you eat and when you test. High carb meals will spike the numbers for a while, and a test one hour after eating will give a higher number than a test after two hours. Telling us what you ate and when you tested will give us a better idea of what's going on. Remember, I'm not a doctor, I just like to play one at home."

One work of advice:  Don't ""chase"" your Dexcom numbers with insulin (if number is going high) or glucose (if number is going low).  You can get yourself into real trouble doing that (don't ask me how I know).  Find your pump's insulin on-board function and always consult that along with your Dexcom.    Adjusting blood sugar is a lot like driving on snow.  Go easy on the gas and easy on the brakes and you won't go skidding out of control,"

If your A1C is 6.1 then your body probably agrees with me. I am also saying this to make myself feel better because I have a great A1C but my CGM shows me high and low every day.

Then my doctor changed some of my settings and I stopped getting so many lows and my A1c went up to 7.9!!! I was freaked out, but my doctor told me the only reason my A1c was so low was because of the low BG's... and that I had terrible control. (The low BG's were compensating for the high BG's.) Fast forward 4 years later, I am on the minimed pump with sensor and I love it. (A1c is going down every time I get blood work done.) Just stick with it, because you will learn so much about your body and be able to listen to it better. Don't stress out.

diabetes,3d1c4i,usewhippedcream,6,Sun Jul 12 23:50:56 2015 UTC,"Current life expectancy for diabetics is approx 2 year less than the average. When you consider where you live can effect it by more than 3 years, you see that modern diabetes controls truly help the longevity.   For type one, it is closer to 3 to 5 years less due to complications. It's not the diabetes that gets you, it's the effect RAPID blood sugar changes have on blood vessels and the nervous system that completely wreck the body's ability to function at a later age. For type two, it is not as severe an issue but it DOES effect it. The expectancy change for type two is 0-2 years less.  A better question would be to look at the mental health of diabetics that were diagnosed at an early age. It takes a heck of a toll on the mental ages of folks along with the potential for developmental changes due to BG effects.   EDIT: recent studies HAVE said that standing at a high BG does effect long term complications but not nearly as much as rapid changes do. Also, my quote of loss of longevity is for folks with A1C of 7."
diabetes,3d1c4i,NEXT_VICTIM,3,Mon Jul 13 03:13:30 2015 UTC,I think the best improvements are going to come from automated pump technology (often called artificial pancreas) - I wouldn't be surprised if this could keep most people within a normal/safe glucose range pretty much all of the time.  There are some pretty old diabetics already and they had to deal with animal insulin and a total lack of blood glucose testing.   I remember peering at coloured sticks in the 90s not really sure exactly what the number was. Now I can see the glucose and trend reading in near real-time on my wristwatch.  This subreddit has boosted my knowledge 1000x and I make different choices as a result of what I've learned. This access to information just wasn't available until recently.

He's one of the oldest living type 1 diabetics that I know of and he has been living with an A1C in the 4 range for many years now and has reversed many of his original complications. He is convinced that a diabetic can live a normal life if the A1C is kept very low. However, the sacrifices necessary to achieve that level of control are going to be out of reach for many people. I do think that if you have an A1C >6 for your whole life you will definitely have complications to some degree. A normal nondiabetic and non insulin resistant person will have a fasted blood glucose averaging around 83 mg/dl, and after most meals the blood glucose will only spike to a little above 100 (unless vast amounts of carbs are consumed). That kind of control is very very hard to replicate as a T1D."

diabetes,3d1c4i,alan_s,5,Sun Jul 12 21:54:50 2015 UTC,"If they're Type 1, probably not. Good glucose control improves the macrovascular complications and big bads (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy.. although nephropathy is probably more related to blood pressure control than A1c control), it doesn't do well with a lot of the microvascular complications and minor things (you still get autonomic dysnomia much earlier than the average person).  If we had the right tools to control our blood sugar (a combined insulin + c-peptide + amylin regimen at 1:1:100) instead of just insulin, and could get it into hepatic circulation instead of SubQ -> systemic circulation... yeah our lives would be ""normal""  Except for the constant shit associated with being a diabetic, which wears you the fuck down every single day.  But you'd probably live about as long, within a year or two, of someone who wasn't diabetic and took as much care of themselves in diet/exercise/meds as you did. But you'd have slightly more problems before you died no matter what.  This is also assuming you managed to correct all the hypos you'd have with tighter control too, because the autonomic dysnomia is gonna eventually cause hypo unawareness.  But honestly it's better to take care of yourself than not, I can't count the number of times I've seen someone come into the hospital in their late 20s or early 30s with a history of T1D, who have end stage renal disease, gastroparesis, cardiac complications, and a bunch of other shit going on because they weren't given the tools to succeed in life and with their diabetes, because the American medical and social systems are... well they need improvement. I don't want to end up like that, I don't want to end up on dialysis even in my 50s or 60s if I can help it, dialysis blows.  TL;DR: Yay diabetes!"

diabetes,3d1c4i,donnowheretogo,6,Mon Jul 13 14:25:29 2015 UTC,"Things are getting better and better for us, and easier and easier too. It's gonna take some time, but in the next 5-10 years there's going to be some pretty big changes in medicine and the management of the beetus (type 1 and 2 alike). No ""cure"" or whatever, but a lot better.  Hell, I'm not a fan of the insulin pump myself, but it's great for some people and really good for them if it works. I think the CGM is actually one of the better devices invented for Type 1s.  I also have a tiny bit of faith in the BCG vaccine trials, and in the verapamil research as well. They're potentially very cheap therapeutic options and if we can even kick about residual insulin function to like 20% of regular people (versus the like 2-5% now) that's going to have a huge impact on our health, because we will have some limited control. So if you end up going into the 20s/350s your body will reduce it slowly on it's own and normalize eventually, especially if you have basal insulin on board. Also the increased B-cell activation means less unopposed action of glucagon as well. Plus there's that glucagon antibody trial too, which might only be like a once a week shot or something.  Couple a few of those therapies together (and all of them will work to varying degrees based on prelim data), and managing diabetes is going to get a lot easier. Having ""half decent control"" while taking those meds/therapies (BCG vaccine is like three shots a year, glucagon antibody might be once a week, and verapamil would be daily, and obviously the normal insulin injections) might mean an A1c of like... 6, and not nearly as many hypos as we experience now. That's pretty much non-diabetic.  It's gonna get much better, even if it doesn't get cured, and things have been progressively been getting better and better over the years too. I remember having to inject every 8 hours for my basal insulin every day (NPH) with definite peaks, and then taking regular insulin and my blood sugars would be a whacky roller coaster. Now Lantus is relatively stable (and there's a new more stable less varied insulin coming out with a 48 hour half life, which could probably even be taken once a day, and not at the exact same time every day and be much closer to peakless than lantus is), and fast acting insulins like humalog/apidra do a pretty good job of controlling sugars... not perfect like endogenous production, but better than nothing.  You should also really talk to a therapist or someone you care about, in regards to how all of this shit makes you feel. Pls be safe.  TL;DR: Things can only go up from here, keep fighting the good fight and get as little irreversible complications as you can over the next 5-10 years and it'll only get easier."

Keep ALL of your supplies sans your insulin on a top shelf. Keep everything in cases on that shelf. Insulin for me only goes kept away in the butter keeper in the fridge.   When it comes to handling lows, keep glucose tabs on you. Put them in a zip lock 3 servings at a time and keep it in your pocket. Watch that CGM and keep your alarms set for a lower threshold so it can warn you when you're GOING high or low, not just when you ARE. Keep a close eye on a lowering trend and take two glucose tabs to ward it off. See your BG going high? Take a couple units to ward it off as well.   Sleepless nights happen, and you need to make sure you're eating right throughout. Lots of protein, good carbs. Keep those quick sugars fit only when you need them.   As far as my two, neither are diabetic. They were both breast fed and eat relatively well, but fast food happens.

We have three little ones (6 and under), so for me I have found testing, and testing often to be key.  I also drink LOTS and LOTS of coffee. None of our kids have diabetes, but it is something we watch for. If the boys aren't bouncing off the furniture and walls, and instead are acting super tired, we keep an extra eye on them. I have checked their blood sugar levels once each during super tired days.

I use the word diabetes around my kids, and the two older ones both know and say the term, ""You need to check your blood sugar..."" or something very similar, because I say it often. :)  I can't say there are/were any challenges I didn't expect, but I've lived with T1 my entire life basically, so it's pretty much all I've known. :)"

I keep very tight control over my diabetes so it's a little easier for me than if I was uncontrolled (obviously). I can't stress enough how important testing is especially when you have a child in your arms. I'm on the pump so I don't have the spikes like I did with Lantus so the sleep deprivation didn't affect it.  I'm also a dad so I can't tell you what the hormones would do to a female diabetic post child birth. I have my supplies put up high in a closet. That's how I child proof them.

I guess I just dealt with it the same way we deal with all of the other issues that we have to deal with -- do what you have to do but don't let it stop you from doing what you want to do.  I took 7 months of paternity leave with each one (yay Canada). When home alone with an infant and trying to get them to sleep there would be times that I would have to sacrifice a nap to go treat a low. Or when going for long stroller walks I would often miscalculate how much of a snack I'd need (b/c apparently pushing a stroller is more effort than just walking) so I would have to pop into a store and grab something. I think that it would have been easier if I'd had a CGM at the time.  Fortunately when you have young kids you're always carrying snacks for them which means you always have some around as well. You're also usually carrying bags of toys and diapers and whatever else so there's lots of room to carry your supplies.  I keep my supplies in a drawer in the kitchen. When kids were old enough to take the annoying child locks off of all of the kitchen cupboards I just kept the lock on my drug drawer.   As far as telling them what's up with me, it just comes naturally.  Kids are curious and ask a lot of questions. Answer them honestly but simply. They know about daddy's pump and not to press the buttons. They know that if I say ""hang on a second girls, daddy has low blood sugar"" they will stop climbing all over me and let me go deal. They know that daddy needs medicine or he'll get very sick.   My kids are healthy so far. I had a freakout day a little while ago when my youngest was peeing constantly. I tested her BG after she went to sleep and it was a beautiful 5.4.  The only real issue I have is when they climb or jump on me and end up kicking an infusion site.

diabetes,3cz1xe,eti-enne02,3,Sun Jul 12 13:26:57 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but I'm type one, have pretty average control ( okay, slightly below average control) I've got tattoos on my chest and back and didn't have any problems at all with them. I would be cautious when getting tattooed in areas that potentially don't have good blood flow like feet, ankles and hands. I don't think I would ever get my feet ankles done for this reason. Also larger and shaded designs will take longer to heal than small/thin line designs. Ultimately though if you're going to get a tattoo and you're concerned about healing you would be better off getting the design you want in the exact place you want it and making sure you have extra good bgl control for a little while before it and for a minimum of two months after it and also be vigilant with applying cream and keeping the area clean also make sure your tattooist keep to a high hygiene standard. You don't want to be compromising your design placement of something that's going to be on your body for the rest of your life just because of your diabetes."

I really don't heal very well because of poor control and have not had a tattoo in almost 8 years. Just got stay on top of my sugars better. I'm sure it'll be ok as long as it doesn't get infected. My other tattoos healed fine but I was a better diabetic in those days.

The ""slow healing"" bit is much more generally applicable to type 2s, and is primarily due to insulin resistance. Insulin is required for new tissue to grow in the healing process. If your body doesn't use it correctly, you won't heal as well."

I did try the low carb/no carb (Basically NO CARB) for about 3 days about 2 years ago, when my insulin pump supplies were running super low, and I was waiting on more to arrive by mail.  It 100% worked for me. I was basically able to keep my sugar levels in the ""normal"" range, at all times. I've tried to get my wife on board, but so far, it's a no go.

diabetes,3d22ae,jonasis,5,Sun Jul 12 22:07:37 2015 UTC,"It looks like a fun coincidence. From what you have here it seems like you need one unit of insulin to reduce your blood sugar by ~18 mg/dl, or 1 mmol/l (though it is kind of concerning that you don't seem to take a dose when you test at, 12, say). This just happens to correspond with the 24 hour clock, with the assumption that you only count the PM hours.   Not everyone has the same level of insulin sensitivity - for example I could take one unit of insulin and expect to drop about 50 mg/dl. But it's cool you've found a sort of mnemonic to help you dose above a certain bg level."

I am not going to argue that drinking regular soda is linked to T2D, or even non-controlled or non-compliant T1D.   But it's important to note--as we see this idea spreading from Crossfit to now this article--that a correlation between two things does not mean one thing causes another. Does drinking too much regular soda cause T2D? I can't say. Does it cause T1D? I'm around 95% sure that it doesn't because the research shows that diet does not play into insulin-dependent juvenile diabetes.   So, while we can discuss whether it is healthy to eat a Western, sugary diet (and the majority of diabetics know that it's not), it's honestly important to make sure that we're using good sources. I was rooting for this one until I got up to the Crossfit/Coke/Jonas crap. It undermined the whole credibility of the article."

diabetes,3d2ny4,livingvertical,4,Mon Jul 13 01:10:25 2015 UTC,"I have been following this family's story via Instagram and the whole thing is just tragic. It should NEVER have happened. It takes 2 seconds and costs less than a dollar to check a child's blood sugar. Children slip into DKA much faster than adults. They cannot communicate the way adults can that something is wrong and it sounds (based on so many stories I have heard) that pediatricians are quick to dismiss the symptoms as being a typical childhood illness. That's what happened to Kycie. Even if she had survived the recent pneumonia, her life was forever changed by the brain damage she sustained in DKA.   But there is a very easy solution - a simple finger prick in the physician's office to check blood sugar levels. Checking a child's blood sugar should be part of every well-child and sick-child visit IMO. Children are tested routinely for a myriad of things, including many rare metabolic diseases, high blood pressure, lead exposure, and iron deficiency. Glucometers are cheap and readily available. It makes absolutely no sense that if a child presents in a pediatrician's office with anything, their blood sugar isn't routinely checked, especially if those symptoms align in any way with T1D.    T1D is not some rare disease. We should not be missing cases of T1D. I think I heard that there is some effort underway already, but I feel strongly (both as someone with T1D and who is a parent) that screening for diabetes via a finger stick should be part of every health care interaction for children, and possibly even for adults."

It's really common - a high percentage of Diabetics experience it.   Maybe I'm just reading too much into it, but, no - I do not believe you ""forget"" to give yourself insulin. It's trying to ignore the disease you have, to not confront the reality that you're in.   Tell me, do you ever test and feel sad about the result? Not like a seconds worth of ""man, that blows... Oh well, I'll fix it!"", but more like the kind of stuff that stays with you? Maybe even ruins your day?   I ask because I've seen it before - hell, I've tried it myself.  You have to think about testing and insulin a different way. Testing is not something that should ever make you feel bad. It's a tool. Use it to evaluate and influence behavior, but always have control over it. For instance, I accept high numbers sometimes when I feel the value of something else is higher - for parties, etc.   You should, in fact, always feel good whenever you test, even if your numbers are shit! Why? Because you are now ACTIVE in the management of your Diabetes! When you test you also react! If it's high, you take insulin. If it's consistently high, you'll adjust your behaviour long term, etc.   Again, forgive me for being the armchair psychologist, but again - I don't believe taking insulin is something you just forget, on a regular basis...!

I've had more times when I thought I was low, ate, and wound up with ketones. Testing is important, and it doesnt hurt, dont be a weakling.  Also maybe check into a cgm? When I was on one, the minimed ones (never get them, go dexcom, fuck minimeds shitty sensors) I was checking like 8 to 10 times a day, just to see if my sensor was right or if my BS was trending a certain way. Plus its like a reminder to check, because when you feel normal you assume you're near 100, when you could be 190 and feel the same, and thats a fairly big difference."
diabetes,3cxa8a,T1Science,2,Sat Jul 11 16:47:39 2015 UTC,"And change your diet. Living off the normal teenage diet of fries, pizza, fried and other carb loaded stuff is going to make keeping your levels in a good area hard for even the most dedicated diabetic. Not saying eliminate carbs, but they can't be 75% of your diet no matter what the food pyramid says."
diabetes,3cxa8a,mikedt,2,Sat Jul 11 19:35:55 2015 UTC,"Me too pal. I can't remember the last time I tested. I just do as much insulin as I feel I need. Type 1 for 9 years, 19 years old. I know I'm an idiot and I should take more care over it but... I simply don't care. I'm alive and haven't noticed any ill effects yet, although I know they'll likely come eventually. I don't forget to do insulin, I don't think I've missed an injection since I was diagnosed. When I get back to the UK and start hitting the gym I'll have another shot at taking more care over it, but for now I couldn't give a rats arse."
diabetes,3cxa8a,delqhic,2,Sat Jul 11 23:37:42 2015 UTC,"I used to think I just didn't care about controlling my diabetes. I was wrong. I ignored it because I couldn't deal with my diagnosis. I wrote this in response to someone else, but it applies here, so I'm copying it: ""I was like you. Abused/ignored my diabetes for about 18 years. Complications, while they sounded awful, didn't seem like a reality for me. I finally went to a therapist. It only took a few appointments, but it helped me realize I was depressed about having diabetes (I had no idea up until that point), was pretty much in denial about it. Therapy allowed me to grieve my non diabetic self and accept the diagnosis. Now, 4 or 5 years later, I am in total control. Diabetes doesn't control me, I control it.  I'm not sure how old you are, but I was uncontrolled from the age of 13 until about 30. I am currently 35 and the complications dictate my life. I can't drive at night because retinopathy and the subsequent treatments have destroyed my night vision. I have an ulcer on my toe I've been fighting with for ~2.5 years that won't heal and makes me have to wear ugly as fuck shoes (I'm fairly aware of and concerned about my appearance, plus I love cute shoes, so this really bothers me). I can't drink alcohol due to gastroparesis. 1 or 2 drinks are fine, but any more than that and I am likely to end up in the hospital vomiting uncontrollably. I don't want sympathy, but I want you to think about how old I am. I'm only 35 and my life is controlled to a fair degree by these complications. It's not something that won't hit until you're in your 60's or 70's and you may think it won't matter. It started to hit me in my mid 20's and got unignorable by 30. """
diabetes,3cxa8a,scarbeg157,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:28:52 2015 UTC,"I know this sounds like one of those bullshit ""cure diabetes forever things!""  BUT: plasma Carnitine, Taurine, serum Thiamine, Magnesium, Zinc and Vitamin D are all super low in Diabetics compared to the average person. Getting enough helps reduce some of the long term negative side effects.  Carnitine + Taurine @2g/day (don't take Carnitine at night, might keep you up), you can buy them for dirt cheap at powdercity  For the Magnesium, Zinc, Thiamine, Vitamin D I'd recommend the multivitamin Legion Triumph, which actually has the nutrients in absorbable (non-oxide) forms which won't just end up giving you constipation/diarrhea like many other shitty supplements do. That's about $1 a day, but you can take half the dosage if you want and rely on your diet for the rest.  You can check out the examine pages to actually look up the studies if you're scientifically inclined, a lot of them are already posted up there."

Okay. puts on convincing hat with special powers Diagnosed summer of 1998. A1C's of double digits from 1998 till 2003. Went on pump without CGM in 2003 and was on that pump without CGM until 2007. Lowest A1C was 8.x% ONCE, the rest of the time, my A1C's were double digits. Fast forward to September of last year (2014) got an Animas Ping w/Dexcom G4. November 20th A1C: 7.2%, March 25th A1C: 6.9% A few things about me: While on manual daily injections, if I required less than a 5u bolus to correct or for carbs, I didn't take a shot. I found it near impossible to draw less than 5u. I always tested if I felt low or high. I always tested my fasting BG. I usually tested sometime after I ate. Now, I glance at my dexcom constantly. If my BG is above 125, I immediately test with my meter and take the appropriate bolus, no matter how small. There's my attempt at convincing! Pumps and CGM's are very personal. I have friends that love their pumps and CGM's and I have friends that will NEVER use a pump or a CGM. Both groups have both controlled and uncontrolled numbers."

diabetes,3cxa8a,Aarmed,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:32:41 2015 UTC,"I think this is purely a discipline thing. In my opinion you should try to do small things to increase your discipline and just don't demand too much from yourself. Just make sure tomorrow that you measure before breakfast and take the right amount of insuline. Do that for 2 weeks and be very precise with it. Then do it with lunch as well, or after breakfast, I don't know, but you get it, try to train your discipline one step at the time. Check out zenhabits.org for more articles on discipline!"
diabetes,3cxa8a,jibbybonk,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:48:18 2015 UTC,"I completely get where you are coming from. I went away to university and my control was crap. Its not that I forgot to test, I just didn't do it. I sometimes missed injections too. I sometimes missed my long term injections and went high for the day. I guessed at how much I should inject. In all fairness I was pretty close with most of my guesses. I had done it thousands of times before, and I didn't have too many crazy lows, but I did have quite a few highs.  Back then I didnt consider myself a mess, but when I look back at it from now, I was. Im amazed that I didn't screw up more often.   I eventually did find my motivation to take care of myself. It came when my eyesight started to go. This was directly caused by my poor control. Its terrifying when you go from having perfect vision to blurry vision.   That gave me the kick in the pants to get my diabetes under control. I went to see an endo for the first time, 10 years or so after diagnosis. I didn't even know there were endos out there, nobody told me. He helped me get my shit back on track.  You sound like you simply need the motivation to have better control. It is 100% impossible to have good control of this disease if you aren't motivated to keep control. I managed a 5.9 A1C last time around, and its because I test at least 5 times a day, usually more.  Having good control doesn't mean you have perfect blood sugars after every meal. It means you test often, and when you make a mistake with a meal, you fix it afterwards. We all make mistakes. Thats life. You need the motivation to stay on top of this disease.  I hope you find it before any permanent damage comes from it. My eyesight is pretty crap now, hopefully you won't go through something similar."

I read your other replies on what you did, but could you be more specific on your new dietary regimen, testing, your post-meal BG targets and the other nitty gritty details please?   There are new arrivals and lurkers watching who need to know."
diabetes,3cx5oe,alan_s,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:56:58 2015 UTC,"I've got an album on imgur that I put together for my doc.   http://imgur.com/a/owaIZ  This shows every primary test from diagnosis through yesterday morning. I'll talk more about that in a moment.   I was really shooting for keeping my BG under 100 pretty much all the time. These days we're a little more relaxed about that and don't freak out over a 110, but I'm also still trying to avoid much above that. We probably wouldn't do any major re-evaulation of anything until we saw something like a 150+.  Diet broke down like this for the first bunch of weeks : 2/3 of the plate was blandly-seasoned veg (broccoli, cauliflower, green beans, etc) and the remaining was just protein. Steak, chicken, large pork chops, etc. While some additional weight loss was a goal, for the first couple of weeks my wife was struggling with how to get 1800 calories into me in a healthful way. We ate very strictly for the first month or so, and basically every meal was either A) breakfast of eggs and bacon/sausage or B) a pile of veg with a generous protein. My wife slowly starting increasing spice levels (again, we were terrified of basically everything at first - it's a natural reaction, but we really went to the extreme while we were working on being comfortable with the reality of the situation), eventually starting bringing some sauces into things (a tikka masala here, a soy/ginger/black bean sauce there, etc) and again just testing after everything and keeping notes. We had a diet diary that we kept the post-meal readings on as well so we could reference everything. It let us answer questions like ""ok, what was the last serving size of curry & cauliflower? what was the reading after that one? ok, so this time we'll X-Y-Z and see how THAT impacts you.""  Once we started to get comfortable with how all of this worked we were able to phase in things like single-serving mashed potato cups or a single slice of bread made into an open-faced tuna sandwich or an apple with breakfast or something similar. Eventually we found some very small slider buns that are 16g of carbs and that brought a small sandwich back into play. I'm additionally lucky in that I have a very science-minded BiL who happens to run a bakery, so he started experimenting on his end and came up with a truly delicious brioche that ended up being 8-12g  per.   One food note : we didn't shop for ""low carb"" anything. We started with a very ""farmer's market and deli"" mentality and when we did start reintroducing starches it was all about portion control rather than any kind of ""it's like that thing you love, but low carb!"" products. It was, to us, reassuring to know that we were just cooking with honest ingredients and paying attention. I'm not knocking them as a concept by any stretch. We just felt more comfortable eating simply, with ingredients that we recognized, and expanding from there.   Having said that, developing a taste for La Croix (sparkling water with essential oils added for flavor, literally nothing else) and similar products (Dasani makes some flavored carbonated water, as do Ozarka, Simply Balanced, and a few others) helped a great deal since it let me still be able to reach into the fridge and grab a beverage. They are not what I would call ""delicious"", speaking generally, but your palate definitely changes as you're replacing knowns with unknowns and you do develop a different set of cravings. My current two favorites are Dasani Lime and La Croix Apricot (which is stunningly tasty). People have asked me multiple times in stores about these products when seeing me purchase them, asking me ""are they good? i see them all the time..."" and my stock answer is ""well, they're good FOR ME because I'm a diabetic"". My previously-mentioned BiL (non-diabetic) was at the same time transitioning away from sugar sodas and onto diet sodas but didn't feel comfortable putting the various sweetening agents into his body and tried some of my La Croixs and has now switched to those himself. I think these products have niche appeal, given how subtle the flavors are, but for someone who has a habit of cracking open cans of whatever when they're thirsty they can help ease the transition away from soda.   I was on a small (15u) insulin dose to begin with. You'll see the initial dosage and declination schedule in that imgur album, as well as my increasing Metformin dosage along the way. We were lucky to discover I was insulin-resistant rather than deficient and with dietary changes and Metformin were able to wean off of the insulin before much time had passed. Based on the results of the A1C we're at a place now where starting tomorrow we're going to bring the Metformin down by 500mg, watch for three weeks or so, and if things continue to be stable we'll end up reducing Metformin by another 500mg at that point. Lather, rinse, repeat until we either reduce Metformin to 0mg or we find the sweet spot where everything is fine and stay on Metformin indefinitely.   As far as testing regime goes, initially it was much higher than recommended, probably 6-8 times a day. The charts I included only show the primary readings (wake/fast, and then post-breakfast, -lunch, and -dinner). I ended up taking more than that for quite a while, but those are on a different chart that ended up being less useful for the docs so I didn't include it in the charts i prepped for this most recent visit. We're curious people in general and having the ability to just zap and measure was a little addicting at first but the overkill helped us get a handle on how things affected me more quickly than we would have otherwise so it was a net positive even if my fingers got a little sore. Today I'm doing about three test per day : wake/fast, sometime post-meal during the day, and then right before bed to make sure things are looking good before sleeping. We've had enough practice at this point that some meals just don't merit a stab. Bacon and eggs, no starches? I'll skip the post-breakfast measurement since we know now how that impacts me. The more regular it becomes and the more solid your meal plans are, the less you have to worry and check.   I AM NOW GOING TO TALK ABOUT ALCOHOL. Many people have had many well-intentioned things to say about consuming alcohol as a diabetic, and from reading other threads here I can see that this is very much a YMMV situation. WHAT FOLLOWS IS MY EXPERIENCE ONLY AND NOT RECOMMENDED AS ADVICE. I immediately and totally dropped all fermented beverages (beer, wine, cider, etc). This took me from 6-8 beers per NIGHT to zero. I eventually started slowly introducing whiskey to see if distilled beverages had any noticeable effect. First thing's first : I enjoy drinking whiskey straight, neat, or on the rocks and this is not something that appeals to everyone. In my case, though, it allowed me to skip mixers or chasers. I do see a small BG reduction shortly after whiskey consumption so I tend to eat no more than a couple of hours before drinking, then drink, and then follow up with more food afterwards (with 15-30g of carbs in there somehow for each of the meals) to make sure things stay stable. After slow experimentation, I found that anywhere from 6-10 ounces of whiskey over a 2-3 hour period did not cause any worries when bookended with food. THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE THE CASE FOR EVERYONE. DO NOT TAKE THIS AS GENERAL ADVICE. I recognize that my specific alcohol consumption is higher than the average. I appreciate all the kind advice that I should reduce my consumption. This post is purely about my personal journey, and that journey included carefully experimenting with whiskey along the way.   I seem to have some genetic bonuses that not everyone gets. My cholesterol, for example, was shockingly low for how shitty my diet was pre-diagnosis and this allowed us to pump up the difficult-to-initially-obtain caloric goals with things like bacon and steak. Our wallet didn't weep nearly as much as we expected because it turns out a trip for two to taco bell costs about the same amount as a really decent steak and we were eating fast food / eating out on the regular (3-6 times per week).   My doctor has twice had students with her during our visit, and both times we were used as an illustrative point. The advice my doctor is giving us is excellent and when followed properly the results will demonstrate it. The students seemed surprised that anyone took their advice to heart as enthusiastically as we did and it seemed to make everyone feel pretty good about being doctors when they saw their care directly result in the improvement of a patient.   My wife and I love each other very, very much and the thought of trading hamburgers and burritos and mac and cheese in exchange for fewer years together wasn't something we were willing to face down. I'm just about to turn 40, she's about to turn 34. We have, we hope, a looooot of years left together and making these changes were the best way we could rationalize maximizing that time.   I'm happy to discuss further with you or anyone else who read all of that. I believe my wife /u/eatpaste will either be joining us in this thread or already has while I was typing."

diabetes,3cx5oe,carriemybeloved,4,Sat Jul 11 18:49:20 2015 UTC,"it was a complete diet change. i went from pasta and bread and potatoes and rice and taco bell literally every meal to mainly veg and protein. we used to start dinner by boiling water before we even decided what dinner would actually be.   all soda disappeared immediately, fermented beverages (which were a daily thing, too) are gone, fruit juices are gone. lots of water and tea now. we started tracking carbs religiously and overshot, actually being carb deficient for a couple of weeks out fear but with frequent tests and some cautious exploration we were able to eventually figure out what worked and what didn't.   got to the point where a 6"" sub wouldn't spike me very hard and so that became a cheat day meal. still haven't tried a bowl of mac and cheese or ramen yet and probably won't for a while yet.   it was a hard first couple of months but we basically relearned how to interact with food from the ground up and have been slowly able to work some things back in."
