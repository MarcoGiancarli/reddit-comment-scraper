NewGirl,3bwg65,DangerousDove3,12,Thu Jul 2 18:39:08 2015 UTC,"season five should be starting in january next year, which is later than it usually premieres but it should mean less time in-between each episode.  i recommend parks and recreation & happy endings, if you haven't seen them. they've both ended now and aren't exactly romcoms, but they're two of my favourite shows ever."
NewGirl,3bwg65,sergeantthunderfist,7,Thu Jul 2 18:54:45 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised to see the show debut in January... the show was trying to get ahead of Zooey Deschanel's pregnancy by beginning filming season 5 in the spring, so I bet they're waiting until she gives birth to continue filming. Likely they simply don't want to air a handful of episodes in September and then have a 3-4 month wait to film/release the rest.   And, with any luck, this means that we won't have the giant pauses in the schedule like last year. I hate how network shows try and spread out their shows for sweeps so we end up with 3-4 week waits between episodes constantly."
NewGirl,3bwg65,darthstupidious,5,Thu Jul 2 18:58:13 2015 UTC,"yeah, i assume that is the reason why they're delaying this season. FOX did say that the season should be 'virtually uninterrupted', which is great! it's painful trying to stay invested in a show when you don't even know how long it is until the next episode airs."
NewGirl,3bwg65,sergeantthunderfist,5,Thu Jul 2 19:20:04 2015 UTC,Yeah I heard about Zooey 's pregnancy too :-) Good they didnt rush the plot to include her pregnancy. I really doubt if they can pull  a phoebe in Friends. I hope they get back their momentum in season 5. These guys are good actors so the story should do justice to their talent.
NewGirl,3bwg65,MZago1,2,Thu Jul 2 19:42:49 2015 UTC,"In the last few episodes of season 4 they did a decent job. Jess was sitting down quite a bit or only featured from the chest up, if she was even in the episode at all. At the very end of the last episode she was wearing a really flowy dress. I think How I Met Your Mother did the best job hiding Colby Smoulders pregnancy. I didn't even know she was pregnant at the time."
NewGirl,3bwg65,marceline88,8,Sat Jul 4 11:18:56 2015 UTC,"as another said, happy endings scratches that romcom itch for me. I've also enjoyed latter day Mindy project for its kinda similar wacky vibe. You could try community too, but I say that to everyone :D"

NewGirl,3bwg65,suite-dee,5,Fri Jul 3 06:09:31 2015 UTC,"Season 4 a disaster?! They finally got back on track this season, in my opinion. Some of my biggest laughs of the show are from episodes in season 4.  I agree with 1 and 2 being awesome though. It's one of my favourite shows, glad you like it."
NewGirl,3bwg65,LeloGoos,3,Fri Jul 3 13:25:50 2015 UTC,"I completely agree! Winston's a lot more believably offbeat now as opposed to the completely wacky Winston in season 3. Much better. I don't care about Nick and Jess together, I like seeing them date other people. I like the characters as individuals."
NewGirl,3bwg65,ness_ftw,3,Fri Jul 3 16:25:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah man, totally. At times, Winston's character in season 4 is pure comedic gold in my opinion. I've always loved the wacky Winston, it's what I love about him, but in season 4 they seemed to find just the exact right balance of wackiness to make him work as a character. And I loved every little weird as fuck moment.  ""Winston had fallen asleep polishing his candelabra."" seemingly off the cuff, completely irrelevant, statement by Jess.  ""FYI, you guys live with the cat too, but at least I get to reap the benefits.""   and many more"

NewGirl,3bqerp,Davidiraptor,3,Wed Jul 1 09:21:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, she meant the second time when they were gonna move in together, in season 1 finale. I assumed he spoke with her then but I guess he did not and just left."

NewGirl,3ayswj,manleeman,7,Wed Jun 24 16:18:58 2015 UTC,"Agree with the first two, disagree with the third.   Plus, what does her being a Vice Principal have to do with anything? Honestly, none of those guys could afford to live in a giant loft like that in LA, other than Schmidt."
NewGirl,3ayswj,rnjbond,2,Wed Jun 24 18:14:49 2015 UTC,I think their point was twofold. One was that this promotion means a big change and moving out could really facilitate the feeling of a big change. Two was that it is monitarily feasible now.
NewGirl,3ayswj,TheFirstHumanChild,4,Thu Jun 25 12:07:46 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, it would absolutely not be monetarily feasible for Jess to get her own place on the salary of a Vice Principal"
NewGirl,3ayswj,rnjbond,0,Thu Jun 25 12:37:53 2015 UTC,"Uhm, the median salary for an assistant principal in LA is $87k. She could fairly easily afford a $3k loft on that salary."
NewGirl,3ayswj,AllUpInMyButt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:35:40 2015 UTC,"lol $87K salary means your take-home pay is $52K (and that's not including other withholdings, such as health care that she would obviously take).  A $3K loft would be $36K per year in rent.   Perhaps you and I have different definitions, but spending 70% of your salary on rent is not ""easily affording"" it."
NewGirl,3ayswj,rnjbond,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:18:03 2015 UTC,"Even if a person with that income level didn't go for a $3k apartment, she could easily afford her own apartment, which was the original denial."
NewGirl,3ayswj,AllUpInMyButt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:47:45 2015 UTC,"$3k is the number you provided, not me.   But if you want to play this game, then sure. In that neighborhood, she's not getting her own apartment for under $2,250, and that would be a steal.   But since we're nitpicking, let's also assume she's smart enough to get health insurance and whatnot. I'll even assume she has no student loans and isn't saving for retirement. So she has $45K in take home pay.   So she'd pay 60% of her entire salary to rent. Again, you and I have different definitions, but in no world is this ""easily affording""."
NewGirl,3ayswj,rnjbond,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:00:34 2015 UTC,"Well, realistically, or should I say fictionally, if Schmitt could afford it, she should be able to, too.    Without any help from family, the probability of Schmitt being able to afford a 2 bedroom loft on a marketer's salary are basically nil comparatively.  Yes, Schmitt was able to get his own office at the firm, but the average salary for a Marketing Manager in LA is $79k, which is less than a Vice Principal.   Additionally, why would she necessarily stay in that area, secondly, the average monthly amount dedicated to housing in LA is higher on average, and thirdly, apartments in the art district are currently going for less than $2k, if she did stay in the area. http://www.apartmentguide.com/neighborhoods/California/Los-Angeles/Artists-District/"

I hope they won't get them together again. Jess living on her own wouldn't be that interesting. so I disagree with #3. Probably Cece will be around more (yay) and Schmece will have their own house, so it will change eventually. The best dynamic is when they are all together imo. S4 proved it and it was an amazing season with an awesome finale. Hope they continue that dynamic."

He has Shawn-Spencer-syndrome to me (from Psych): Shawn started out as this super intelligent lazy guy who was really good at solving crimes, but eventually turned into an idiotic toddler running around kind of helping the storyline.   As for Nick's new personality, I can't believe ""this Nick"" ever had the desire or ability to get into law school. He started out as a lazy guy who was just spiteful, funny, and not living up to his potential -- now I'm surprised he can even remember to wake up in the morning he's so stupid."
NewGirl,38yc85,ummsure,10,Sun Jun 7 23:51:00 2015 UTC,I was kinda always hoping that the break up with Jess and him performing as Schmidt's lawyer would motivate him to get off his arse and make something of himself. Is that harsh?
NewGirl,38yc85,geobloke,7,Mon Jun 8 04:21:20 2015 UTC,I don't think it's harsh. They could have easily tied it in with Winston's push to become a cop as another motivator.

NewGirl,38yc85,scuba7183,4,Mon Jun 8 15:54:46 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. He turned into a caricature of himself. After the first season or two, I wholeheartedly expected him to 1)get over Caroline and 2)Finish law school. The current Nick Miller sounds like a 1st grader when he writes a zombie novel or eats an old dead fish. He has the potential to be an endearing character, and has some amazing lines, but I preferred the first version. If I could see Jess falling for any version of Nick, it would have been that guy. Having any kind of feelings for the current version is just an insult to her quirky intelligence."
NewGirl,38yc85,smell_e,4,Mon Jun 8 06:05:27 2015 UTC,"He did finish Law School to prove he could do it, but decided to work in a bar instead. Source: some season 3 episode. Maybe the one where Jess has to decide whether to change jobs."

NewGirl,38yc85,shanticlause,6,Mon Jun 8 04:29:17 2015 UTC,"Totally... I feel the exact same way.. He's a little crazier and weird now. In season 1, he was silent and behaved in a sort of mature way. He was the voice of reason at times. I miss that."
NewGirl,38yc85,ness_ftw,6,Mon Jun 8 16:39:15 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean. I think it has a lot to do with the character becoming more emotionally healthy. what comes to mind is the  ""You give me cookie I give you cookie"" scene. Nick used to be this oddly realistic character who was always trying to hide his feelings of inadequacy under a thin layer of detachment. Now he seems to have gotten over much of that, and is earnestly trying to do what makes him happy.   I think I would rather have growth then just stagnation, but yeah broken nick was way funnier."
NewGirl,38yc85,shivs1147,5,Mon Jun 8 21:50:15 2015 UTC,This happens in pretty much every show. Homer Simpson and Peter Griffin come to mind. The longer a show goes on the more exaggerated the character becomes.
