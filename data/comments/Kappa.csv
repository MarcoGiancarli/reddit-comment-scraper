Got 5th at the Akihabara singles that was stacked, think only Daigo was missing, and now placed 5th at EVO. He may be far behind Younashi and Yossan as far as BP and experience, but he's definitely the best Juri, even Yossan was amazed at what he was doing at EVO"

There are also more Juri's in between them, so technically based on BP Younashi is 1st, Aiai is 4th, and Yossan is 6th."

Anybody can make up a sad story and get naive people to donate. One of the most common thing on gofundme is take somebody elses misfortune and use that story to make profit.  Smart people will want more than just a story but some sort of proof.  In Neos case a police report would've helped.   If Neo's story were backed up by a concrete evidence I probably would've donated a little bit because even though it was a bit careless it wasn't entirely his fault that it happened.  I know how it feel because my apartment got robbed and I lost  about $4000 dollars worth of assets.  This was in a way my own carelessness for only locking the door handle and not the deadlock.  That being said there are people in the FGC that are in it to make some money.  Alex Myers asking people to donate money to put down his dog.  Thats your pet take some responsibility for fuck sake.

He invited the guy to come talk about MadCatz products/experience. I mean isn't that part of markman23 's job of being the Community & Sponsorship Manager? EVO was around the corner, so markman23 took advantage of that opportunity with the invite. A Community manager is supposed to be an advocate for the brand to the community..... If he just stopped caring with interacting with the community, then he isn't doing his job."

Kappa,3e0dnj,rkappasvoice,8,Tue Jul 21 02:38:22 2015 UTC,"Guy was bluffing, yes, but what if he wasn't? This would give the Community Manager, markman23, a chance to at least address the concerns and maybe that small chance of gaining a new customer.  Your viewpoint is too obscured with your experience with oldmanwatts or lack of civilian life. You need to look at this as if you were the Community and Sponsorship Manager. I already stated what that was, but do you specifically understand what it is?"
Kappa,3e0dnj,rkappasvoice,-15,Tue Jul 21 02:50:17 2015 UTC,"Ok once again, you're missing the point. Old as fuck dude getting mad over shit some dude on the internet said. Nobody fucking cares. Markman playing into the trolls hand."
Kappa,3e0dnj,ri3mannzeta,6,Tue Jul 21 02:52:41 2015 UTC,"So what your saying is that he wasted his community efforts on reaching out to what was an obvious troll/reddit alt. Played into his hand. Fair enough. I think I'm starting to grasp of what you are trying to convey in that regard.   At least, that makes much more sense as opposed to your initial statement of ""what's with 40 year old men fighting bullies on the net"" etc. As if you are drawing  similar parallel comparison with oldmanwatts (fight me irl) vs his trolls (you, haha) and markman23 vs this troll."
Kappa,3e0dnj,emp_karaface,9,Tue Jul 21 03:17:01 2015 UTC,"markman23 invited him to talk at EVO. What is so farfetched/wrong about that? If he was addressing a random customer not familiar with the FGC, than yeah that is bit of a stretch. But the guy he was talking with was someone on /r/kappa...who can be assumed as someone who follows the fgc. The fact that he agreed to it...I thought it was assumed he was going to be at EVO regardless of markman23's presence."

So example if you stole a mac, still have the original's owner iCloud account logged in and you wipe it, the account will still be there. Drives me nuts when I have to repair them sometimes.

Those are things you do optionally on your own. Most people probably don't bother to set it up and a lot of people have privacy issues with those things too.  Also, most laptops don't have GPS devices installed in them. Locations with iCloud are determined via wifi signals, so if there is a way to wipe iCloud from the drive it's not a sure-fire way of finding it. Websites like Facebook can't determine your exact location if you're not on mobile, only general area via your IP. And even so, that's only helpful if he's still automatically signed into them and they leave it up somewhere instead of wiping+selling.   Basically, unless he has a macbook with icloud+find my mac enabled, which I know not everyone does, he's probably fucked.

He was one of the first internationals / top level players I've ever played in tournament during Shadowloo Showdown 2013. Believe he came 2nd that year. I still remember that match. First round was pretty weird, he gave me way too much respect and I did tons better than I thought I would considering I only really got serious that same year. But then he utterly stomped me round 2. It was the chat afterwards that really made me like the guy. Aside from the fact that most top players wouldn't talk to a scrub like me, my couple of questions about the match turned into a full blown conversation right in the middle of his pools. Guy was so humble and helpful... he really stoked the fires for my passion in SF4. I was rooting for him all through EVO, so sad to see just just miss out like that, totally felt for the guy. James Chen didn't help my mood either D:"

That being said, Ultrachen deserved the Cannon award way more than MaximillianCPM.  Rehashing shitty games and shouting into a mic is not community contribution.

His commentary definitely can use improvement, and the way people like to lay out criticisms here is through jokes or being blunt since this place is ""FGC uncensored"" or something. Sure, it's not ""James, your commentary is fantastic, please keep it up, but consider the following adjustments..."" but it's criticism he can work off of nonetheless.    We never once seriously criticized or made fun of James' passion, personality, or character. In fact, last week someone made a thread trying to, and the comment section was full of comments like ""nah, he's a legit content creator, I'd give him some money to keep doing what he's doing."" He's a great content creator and mentor of the FGC, and he will be for as long as the community or he stays alive, but even he is not the greatest commentator out there. If we or he wants the scene to grow as we/he wants it to, then he should be working at his commentary if he is to be a mainstay commentator, which seems to be the case. If you think we want the FGC and/or James, Skisonic, Watson, etc, to fall flat, you're flat out wrong."

This was a competitor's badge and would be mostly useless to the person stealing (other than entering the main hall on sunday). This was before you needed a badge to enter the main room on friday and saturday.  I told the guy that got his badge stolen and we had a whole confrontation where the thief never admitted stealing the badge despite me clearly seeing the asshole reach over and pull the badge from his chair. Never found the badge, and I'm 99% sure he handed it to his friend that got away as we confronted the thief.   What I'm trying to say is there are people like that motherfucker,  who are willing to fuck over somebody's entire tournament experience over what would've simply been a $10 badge.

I couldn't even speak and the Juri seemed so random but one second later I thought about her long ranged dive kick and it all made sense. Genius decisions with godlikely executed gameplays, congrats to both players.  A nigga could write an essay about this set because holy shit, Gamerbee showed everyone that Elena's strength isn't footsies, it's actually zoning and Infiltration on how to pressure someone into down-back in the corner for life.

You might think you know how to play against ken but when I'm done training you won't ever want to play against Ken again.

Kappa,3dwud0,mikeocd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:49:26 2015 UTC,"How is it the staff's fault that Momochi's stick messed up? What could they have done differently?  They followed the CPT rules to the letter.   Reporting Equipment Failure: Video game hardware has a tendency to break down during tournaments. Buttons or joysticks will occasionally break down in the middle of a match, leaving the player on the broken side at a significant disadvantage. The following rules will be used in the event of a breakdown.  a. In the event of an equipment failure, they player has the option to stop the Game in progress to obtain an replacement.  b. If a Game is stopped in progress, the reporting player must forfeit the current round.  c. New equipment must be immediately available. If replacement equipment cannot be obtained in a timely manner, the player must continue to play on their current equipment or forfeit the Match.  d. Once replacement equipment is obtained, the player is given the rest of the round to configure their buttons and test the new equipment. If the player gains an undue advantage by doing so (e.g. charging an abundance of super meter), they must forfeit the Game.  e. A player may opt to switch out equipment between Games at no penalty. When this occurs, the player will be given ample time to configure his buttons before the next Game begins."
Kappa,3dwud0,acekingoffsuit,14,Tue Jul 21 08:48:59 2015 UTC,I think getting a free round more than makes up for that.  Not to mention the 'rhythm' looked good for Momochi if anything.   Not to mention Momochi had to play on an unfamiliar stick!

Kappa,3dxs8j,boxfresh,11,Mon Jul 20 20:55:36 2015 UTC,"Funny how you shit all over MadCatz, pimp Hori, then later on down in the comments link directly to a thread in which people point out how shitty Hori is too:   I'm baffled as to how anyone can defend Hori with such vehemence when this is the same company which not only cleared the EX2 for release, but also wanted to charge $80 for it.  To go over their consistent fails briefly (I've taken apart and modded almost every Hori stick made):  Poor quality wire running from stock joysticks to the pcb  Randomly designed pcb's from the awful (EX2, HRAP EX, FS3, BlazBlue HRAP) to the ""it makes no sense"" (VX:SA, V3:SA)  Crap USB cables, even in the VLX's  Bizarre company decisions (spending a fortune on developing Fighting Edge stock parts only never to offer them for sale or possibly even use them in a stick ever again, only having 4 Sanwa RG buttons in their latest stick, only having quick disconnects in some HRAP models)  Cable compartment doors were designed to fall off  Their community manager is non-existent aside from some cut & paste clips posted on SRK once a blue moon.  I could go on..  MadCatz are far from perfect (I hate the Strekken style case) and they used to make really bad stuff prior to that horrible street fighter four game, but IMO they immediately surpassed Hori with the release of the original TE.   We never did fully get to the bottom of the clone parts in the MLG stick, but I always check every single component of sticks I'm modding, and I've never come across a TE (Round 1, Round 2, TE-S, FS Pro, VS, TE2) that had anything other than genuine parts in it.  I've worked on dozens of stick mods of all kinds. Shit that I've come across in my time:   Hori VX-SA Kai PCB fries out for no apparent reason after about 3 months of use (two of them in a row). Cable doors for virtually all Hori, Qanba and Eightarc sticks along with some OG TEs fall off easily and are difficult to get replacements for. Razer Atrox for 360 cabling frays and fails easily, something everyone witnessed last night. Shitty PCBs and wiring in virtually all Hori RAP series sticks, including VLXes (wires falling apart or not being rigged properly, PCBs that randomly flare out for no reason). Paewang PCB (used in Etokki and some custom projects) fries out half the time and drops inputs the other half of the time. Qanba/Eightarc sticks require structural repairs, rewiring and PCB replacement more than MadCatz and Hori combined. This experience is not unique -- ask Gummo or Ducky. PS360+ can randomly decide to take a shit and not work/detect, or even refuse to accept manual overrides, which is why most pro modders much prefer doing official padhacks. Qanba 360 only or PS3 only PCBs seem to be relatively stable, but stay the hell away from the dual mod version used in the Fusion. Touchpad on Hori Fighting Edge can take a shit, taking half the stick's functionality with it. MadCatz TE Round 1 had issues working on PC due to requiring a VIA USB chipset in order to function properly. First versions of the Razer Atrox for 360 had weak contact points where the hydraulic piston controlling the top opening would snap off from the plastic where it was mounted. All Qanba/Eightarc sticks use generic shitty in-house buttons that squeak, feel like crap and fail after short cycles, and sticks that are so bottom of the barrel that you can even see the difference between a Qanba square gate and a proper Sanwa one.   Like the other guy, I could go on and on and on. There's something to piss and moan about with every manufacturer, but also good work being done by everyone to various degrees. Nobody is so significantly better/more reliable as to warrant brand fanboys on forums or reddit talking crap, because peoples' experiences vary wildly based on what gear they or their friends have and how it's treated.  If I were playing in the top 8 and wanted to make damn fucking sure my shit was top notch, I'd roll with the following:  360: MadCatz Versus SH  XB1: Razer Atrox (much improved over the 360 version, even the USB connector is completely different)  PS4: MadCatz TE2  Hori is literally taking the same shit they designed 5 years ago and redressing it up for next gen. Don't get me wrong I enjoy my PS4 VLX and XB1 RAP, but there's no way I'd take them to tournaments."

Old 360 sticks had weird consistency issues (TE Round 1 and Round 2 era), but they eventually work if you fuck with them long enough.   PS3 and PS4 sticks usually work but they show up as DirectInput devices, and certain games (like MK9) show those inputs at 1, 2, 3, 4 etc. instead of their actual buttons. Kinda annoying to deal with.  The most failsafe way to play on PC is to get a modern-made 360 stick, then make sure the Xbox 360 Controller driver is installed. That new MCZ is a top-flight pick for the 150 price point. FightStick Pro models are pretty solid too, but finding one new these days is harder than it was last summer when MadCatz was practically giving them away."

Gamerbee is again known to be an all around good guy   So pauses game to get a breather because you are mentally taxed. End up getting a nice break while they look at the stick situation. It takes a while to get you a stick which kills you momentum, but it kills Gamerbee's even more.  Note how Gamerbee, when given the round, only hit him enough to take his life below his and not get more meter. Because he is a good guy.  Again, I'm just fucking around, but if Momochi did that shit on purpose"

The logic doesnt even make sense, one of the same 4 people that always win didnt win this game, ITS DYING! I will never get the weird attitude some of these old-school players have. Like, why is KBR a ""bum""? is it because of his characters? his play-style? Or is it purely because he isnt ""one of us""?  Is a game dead when  foreigners start winning it? I just dont see why anyone could dislike KBR, he seems like such a bro who just honestly wants the best for the Marvel Community."

Kappa,3dwp8i,Laniakea17,-7,Mon Jul 20 04:10:55 2015 UTC,"What? He's the greatest because he LOST to Momochi even while using 2 hard counterpicks? Come back to reality, Infil hasn't won a major since forever. This year is the most competitive year in sf4 history and Infiltration hasn't even made it to a grand finals in a single Premier tournament. Even while counterpicking everyone he comes up against.  Whilst Momochi and Daigo have been on a tear ever since the $500k capcom money came in. Daigo has won 2 premiers AND topanga world league, and Momochi has won Capcon Cup AND Evo. And if we're talking all time, Daigo and Tokido are both a mile ahead of everyone else, it's not even a contest."
Kappa,3dwp8i,WeabooGodfather,5,Mon Jul 20 16:40:27 2015 UTC,Infiltration is the best sf4 player over the whole span of the game. consistant top placings and he was untouchable for about a year
Kappa,3dwp8i,jimbojammy,-3,Mon Jul 20 19:39:35 2015 UTC,"Heard of a guy named Daigo? 2x EVO champion? The guy that beat Infiltration 10-2 with weak ass Ryu when Akuma was the strongest char in the game. The guy who's already won 2 premiers AND Topanga world AND Canada masters already this year. How many Premiers has Infil won in the last 12 months? Zero, hasn't even made a single grand finals.  Infil does ok in ft2 because of all his counter-picking. But in long sets where real skill shines, he has consistently fallen short. Like losing 10-2 to Daigo even with matchup advantage, or going to Topanga  world league when Akuma was overpowered and coming dead last (1-8), only managing 1 win.   Infil was dominant in 1 year (2012) and that's it. Whilst Daigo has been dominant FOREVER. To even put Infiltration in the same league as Daigo just shows how bias you really are. Daigo has been the best player in the world almost the enterity of sf4 lifespan, and what makes it even more impressive is that he has NEVER counterpicked, he has literally overcome every possible bad matchup without ever taking the easy route, this is whilst every top player has analysed and dissected his character and playstyle to the limit yet he still wins.  On the other hand after Infiltration came out of nowhere in 2012, the rest of the world dissected his game and character and he has never ever gotten close to that success he had in 2012 (Just like what has happened to Louffy this year), even to the point where he is now forced to counter-pick to gain every advantage he can.   People under estimate how hard it is to stay at the top and overcome tough matchups and counter pickers when everyone else has dissected your character and game style to the absolute limit.  Infil is great, there's no doubt about that, but it is just rediculous to put him (or anyone for that matter) on Daigos level. He has even said on NUMEROUS occasions that Daigo is the greatest, as has pretty much every top player in the FGC that isn't bias, retarted or a hater. I know hating on Daigo is the cool thing to do atm, but you just sound like a spastic in the end. Daigo is a mile ahead, with Momochi, Infil, Tokido, Sako and Xian all fighting for second."

Considering tons of people are there, and in and out, how can you narrow it down to anyone enough to actually have the cops look much deeper into it.   Plus, i think you have a misunderstanding of the police in general. This isnt CSI (we say that a lot on this board), the police dont give a fuck about your or your money. If there is a lead, cool, if not, back to tossing out jay walking tickets for your bread and butter. Cops do not get compensated extra for finding your money you left laying around.   Neo wouldnt be the first person to get their shit stolen in vegas, and definitely wouldnt be the first with thousands of dollars to get their shit stolen.   edit. They left it in the bathroom, so yeah, maybe he will get lucky on finding who it is. I doubt it though. Casinos also do not readily spend a lot of time into combing through their footage for this type of stuff, and it also takes time. If they wanted to piece things together, if they did not get it on any inital quick rewind of footage in that area, i highly doubt they would unless a lawyer got involved, and went through all the proper steps to get to that footage.  They wont play csi for a random who left his bag around, allegedly with thousands of dollars in it.   Alot of people would than just request all kinds of video, and access to video from casinos in vegas, and they dont do that. They have more to protect than what most people lost/"

Kappa,3dwwaz,kfms6741,16,Mon Jul 20 06:03:56 2015 UTC,"Gamerbee ran a fucking gauntlet all the way to the end. Weaker players would have certainly cracked, especially after an intense set like the one he had against Infiltration. The fact that he could recover that quickly against Momochi for grand finals, reset the bracket, and fight all the way to the last round really does show how dedicated and committed he is. He definitely earned the right to be proud of himself for throwing down as hard as he did."

Kappa,3dwwaz,dodgysmalls,5,Mon Jul 20 06:08:30 2015 UTC,"""He's gonna crack, he's gonna do a DP or overextend as usual, that's his style"" and every time he proved me wrong and managed to overcome so many things with his excelent play. It was like watching water turn to wine.   This is what amazed me most, and I'm so glad Killian brought his perseverance centerstage in the commentary. Fighting that hard back from the loser's bracket is unreal, and he didn't win a single match off flow charts or set play, everything was legit street fighter.   It's almost as if he didn't lose.   I mean, he lost one close BO3 to infiltration, and then had to beat way more people to even reach momochi. When he did reach momochi, he beat him 5-4, and most notably destroyed his ken.  Obviously he lost fair and square WRT to the format, but realistically speaking he's just as deserving of the title as momochi, if not moreso."

Kappa,3dwwaz,antinomadic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:56:02 2015 UTC,"That stick malfunction was a tragedy. It kind of feels like Gamerbee's efforts got the Sopranos-cut-to-black treatment. Sure, he technically lost the Grand Finals, but now we'll never know how things would have truly played out without that pause. There's some alternate universe out there where Razer sticks don't suck, and Bruce is the 2015 EVO champion. You could tell neither of those players were happy after it was over."

The one guy that DESERVED a gofundme, because he did nothing wrong and was simply a victim of a pure random theft, was MarkMan, but when the FGC offered to start a gofundme for him he pretty much went ""wut... lol gtfo here with that lame ass shit, fuccbois.

Goldenboy- leave my bag unattended, on the floor, in a ball room with thousands of people for like an hour while I fuck around- Neo doesn't deserve a gofundme.

It's not my inability to conceive it's proven to fail over and over again.    That besides the usual ""this game genre is too niche"" bullshit you are spewing,   It's not bullshit.   same has been said for every RTS before wc3/sc exploded.   RTS are still a niche genre. They do not cater to the largest demographic. That does not mean they sell terribly, they don't sell anywhere near as well as other genres that do. Games like Sports games, Shooters, and Adventure games that release title after title stripping every form of complexity in their title to make a more readily enjoyable product.  The last RTS game that did particularly well was StarCraft 2. It simplified it's gameplay yet still maintained fundamental core aspects of gameplay. When RTS's remove the ability to micromanage units mid-combat, or remove the ability to supply lock yourself then you can say it;s no longer a niche genre and is try to appeal to all people. And nobody who truly enjoys RTS games will play that game.    You had 210k people seeing a fucking Street Fighter final and are thinking your genre is too niche and you are a special flower, what the fuck.   I have no idea what the fuck you're on about. Niche genre has nothing to do with it not being enjoyable to watch. It has nothing to do with a series not being popular. If you are in your heart of hearts telling me you think Fighting games have the same player retention as all other games then you're a fucking moron and the conversation is over.   Sales of Vanilla SF4 Sales of Popular game that came out within the same year  Vanilla SF4 is the highest selling fighting game in the past 6 years. It capped out at 2.88 million sales less than 1/4 of the sales. Pretend all you fucking want but that is fighting games being a niche genre. And the audacity for you to pretend that you don't know that fighting games have some of the lowest player retention in any genre. For you to really sit there and pretend you aren't aware of how Divekick got shit on and laughed at for being a mockery of what fighting games are about. For you to pretend that you haven't seen time and time again games like Naruto UNS try to strip down fighters to something simpler only to have the community completely disregard them is fucking disgusting. Fuck you, for pretending you actually have enough insight into anything to have an opinion worth listening to."

Tell me how many of those 210k viewers do you think bought the game. And tell me how many of them do you think continue to play the game?

What's your point? Selling well has nothing to do with being a niche genre.  niche     - a distinct segment of a market.  Not a small market. Not a unapproachable market, a distinct segment. The people who buy fighting games are mostly people who enjoy playing fighting games, the people who buy RTS games are people who enjoy RTS games, the people who buy shooters, and other high selling games are people of all sorts. They are the bulk majority of gamers so they are not a niche in the gaming market they are the gaming market. Very simple concept.   and that it has been proven that you cannot make simpler fighting games because of a Naruto game and Divekick, i cannot help but laugh a little   I've given you 2 fighting games that call themselves fighting games, strip away the complexity of traditional fighting games and have no traction in the fighting game community show me 2 other fighting games that does the same and is even slightly successful or stop talking to me."

When Vainilla sf4 was over is over 5 million copies by himself alone, it doesnt fucking matter anymore, that is a big game, that has mass appeal.   What's your point? Selling well has nothing to do with being a niche genre.   My point is that you have been talking about how this niche genre is too specialized and so on and i told that argument is a load of shit, RTS or Fighting games are not small niches or anything of the sort, they are big, fucking sf4 for the 3ds sold more than 1 million copies, how the fuck is that specialized or small.  You are mixing the problem of how much it sucks to play Fighting games online with how much mass appeal they have. Is the same as RTS, you think no one is playing them or they did not do well because no one is playing them online? Most people play them for campaigns and to play with friends, that is still a succesful game, like it or not.   I've given you 2 fighting games that call themselves fighting games, strip away the complexity of traditional fighting games and have no traction in the fighting game community show me 2 other fighting games that does the same and is even slightly successful or stop talking to me.   So now Mortal Kombat doesnt exist? We need to refer to fucking Naruto ""Return of the Emochildren"" to show why no one plays fighting games? Is that your argument? Maybe you should spend more time thinking about what you fucking argue and less using petty insults. Hell, Tekken 7 is trying to become simpler by a lot also for what Aris has been talking about but no, lets refer to some weaboo anime game of a terrible series that never produced any decent game as the benchmark for simpler fighting games.  Fighting games are fucking big, stop thinkinking that somehow there is no way for simpler or more complex games to exist, thats why in this genre both NRS and Arcsys and able to coexist.

All the East Coast fucbois said he was going to make top 8 last year and he barely got into top 64.

Pretty much guaranteed as the best at round robin. Always considered around top 3-4 player in any given year. 2nd and 3rd place at SBO. Got 2nd for Capcom 25th. Infiltration: Evo 2012 win and 4 top 8 finishes at Evo. Won Capcom 25th. Several top placings at the big tournaments. Sako: Won Gods Garden and 2 Topanga Leagues. Won Capcom Cup. Gotten top 8 twice at EVO. Momochi: Won Capcom Cup and EVO. Won SBO and an official Capcom tournament when he teamed with RF and Kindevu. Has gotten 2nd at 3 Topanga Leagues. Up for debate. Could be Fuudo or Xian. Fuudo won an SBO (although that sbo had so many issues), Topanga League, EVO, Gods Garden, and also got 3rd at Capcom 25th/EVO/Capcom official tournament.

Kappa,3e0xwk,ionmushroom,3,Tue Jul 21 03:01:14 2015 UTC,I agree with u that be shocking too.momochi and infiltration will be face Eg on the FGC if they have both of them. Like Daigo and TOKIDO for madcat also like RAZER xian and fuudo.
Kappa,3e0xwk,Cloudx1,2,Tue Jul 21 03:08:50 2015 UTC,And he wants to be on EG. That's why he's rocking that shirt and a Razer Atrox. His old eTokki Omni is a gorgeous stick with the crown lever and I think he had better execution on it IMO. Their squad is pretty big and I don't think AJ has it in him to let players go. I know that EG probably gave him a budget but he can let K-Brad and Ricki go. They don't stream. By nabbing Infiltration they've got presence in a country crazy over e-sports.  AJ if you're reading this keep in mind that every team that built their team around Lebron always went to the finals. PR Rog and Justin bring value to your brand and bring results.
Kappa,3e0xwk,cxhwang,-1,Tue Jul 21 03:38:13 2015 UTC,"also I think /u/coolgrayaj and EG can help elevate Infiltration.  Look at momochi... he's always been a good player but always in infil and other top players shadow for most of sf4, but he really stepped it up this year.  It's insane how good infil is on his own being unsponsored and having to travel to more tournaments than anyone to support himself and keep his fgc dream alive, and may not have the adequate time to actually have time to train for himself.  For example, I believe right before he went to south east asia major he had just gotten back to korea from canada/europe and tweeted that he had a day of hardcore training, then had to go back out and fly again.   Disadvantage of being unsponsored is that you gotta travel more to make ends meet and of course only a very select handful of players even have the ability to consistently place highly to get enough prize money to maintain this lifestyle in the first place.   I honestly think with the right infrastructure around him infiltration would become untouchable, not to mention the man plays the entire cast at top 8+ evo level.  Japanese players biggest advantage over foreigners is that they  roll deep and help each other learn match ups because there will always be a character specialist amongst them---all a team needs is one infiltration."

Kappa,3dxxnd,Omnislash79,5,Mon Jul 20 13:15:06 2015 UTC,Thomas & Mack Center? Not gonna happen. The NBA uses that arena for their summer leagues. Arena football and the USA Basketball camps/tryouts also happen around the same time as EVO. A lot of special events also take place in that arena and they're usually booked way in advance.

Kappa,3dxxnd,Justice_Network,-4,Mon Jul 20 14:56:17 2015 UTC,Honestly Vegas is a good choice but I'd love it if Evo could go someplace where they could get a true fiber line. Kansas City or Austin are both good choices. Close to the center of the country and has rapidly improving internet infrastructure.
