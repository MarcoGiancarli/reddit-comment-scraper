SteamGameSwap,3e1jok,Quantumbinman,0,Tue Jul 21 10:25:30 2015 UTC,"I do not believe Nvidia offers a steam key. From what I was told, it adds it directly to your account, as part of the redemption process, like how Humble used to do it.  I don't think you can redeem the Nvidia key without specifying which steam account to redeem Batman to.    Enter your coupon code and date of birth on https://redeem.geforce.com/en-us. Agree to the terms and conditions. You will now be requested to log into your Steam account. You can create one at https://store.steampowered.com/join/?. This is a mandatory step, as your game will be automatically credited to your account at the end of the redemption process. Click the ‘Sign in through STEAM’ button. You will be redirected to Steam sign-in page. Enter in your Steam username and password. When logged in, you will be asked to allow NVIDIA access to Redeem and activate CD-Keys on your account. Click ‘Allow’. You will now be redirected back to the redemption portal. If successful, you should now see your Steam username. Confirm this is the account that you want to claim against. If you have made a mistake, click cancel to restart the process, otherwise click continue. Enter in your additional information (name, email address) and whether you want to subscribe to the GeForce Newsletter, and click redeem. The game will be automatically placed in your account. If successful, you will see a success message. You will also receive an email from us containing confirmation of the redemption."

I'm not doing that well financially either and can't buy any higher priced games (or games in general). The most I can do is give the game, the few trading cards I have left, and a CS:GO crate. I deeply apologize that I can not offer a better game but that is all I really have at the moment."

I mean Activision (those bastards) never give more then a 50% discount on even the oldest COD games.  Meanwhile certain games like KSP is worth about 15 keys (Or $30) which is how much it was when it was in Early Access.  People who really want to buy the game should really wait till Steam Sales so that you can get the games you want at discounted prices (That is unless the devs don't want to have a sale or do what DayZ and GTAV did and raise the price right before the sale so that they can charge the regular price for it and have people think they are getting a ""deal."")

SteamGameSwap,3dfudq,Mogazee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:00:18 2015 UTC,I'd rebuy wolverine origins for steam for sure. It was a pretty fun game if a little glitchy.   oddly enough both it and deadpool have the same effect in game where the character gets more and more fucked up as you take damage.
SteamGameSwap,3dfudq,morriscey,0,Thu Jul 16 05:52:45 2015 UTC,Their regeneration is one of their highlights so yeah ;d
SteamGameSwap,3dfudq,Mogazee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:20:42 2015 UTC,"OBVIOUSLY the regen is the characters powers'. If you wanna take it further deadpools' healing factor was derived from wolverines.  But they are both implemented in a very similar manner, from two different studios, in two different games, several years apart. There's several layers on a sliding scale of damage, that happens and heals in real time. It's even more unique when you consider that many games auto-regen health and show no physical damage whatsoever. In the rare instance they DO show character damage, it's about 3 states of damage."
SteamGameSwap,3dfudq,morriscey,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:38:25 2015 UTC,"Eh, I don't think its as surprising as you make it out to be. Kind of a given in my opinion. Its as surprising as two different shooters having rocket launchers, as in, not really, its completely expected and even if it doesn't happen in other games you totally expect it in games where it fits, and they're always similar cause not much else to do with them. same situation."
SteamGameSwap,3dfudq,Mogazee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:56:23 2015 UTC,"Its as surprising as two different shooters having rocket launchers   Eh, I gotta disagree with that point because almost every shooter has rocket launchers. Health regen is almost as common but typically no visible indications on the character either. If there is it's typically nowhere near as slick as deadpool or wolverines games.  Even most XMEN games don't give a damn and always show a pristine wolverine.   The fact they show damage isn't all that surprising, no, but the fact that they both do so by effectively having several ""layers"" of the character modelled, and use masking to show the ""damage"" levels underneath the skin and costume in almost the exact same manner is pretty surprising.    they're always similar cause not much else to do with them   They could have done several pre-configured levels of damage for the entire character, several levels on a ""per body part"" basis, left it out entirely, show the damage only in cutscenes, the damage could only be shown in specific instances (like a part in deadpool where you have to collect body parts). Deadpool's outfit could have just gotten progressively more roughed up like the arkham games do to Batman's suit. Speaking of why does deadpools suit heal itself? That doesnt fall in line under the ""expected"". Or they could have done nothing visually but a healthbar and a glow with maybe some blood, and it would have been excused pretty easily.   There are numerous ways to visibly show the healing factor and these games picked an extremely similar method.    AFAIK these are the only two games that display characters & damage in this manner and they're from entirely different studios, I didn't expect that kind of visual presentation in either game which immediately makes it far more surprising than the bog standard grenade launcher..."
SteamGameSwap,3dfudq,morriscey,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:52:50 2015 UTC,"You are taking my analogy too literally.   but typically no visible indications on the character either.    Because it usually won't make sense, in this two particular games not only does it make ""sense"", its a given. Its like making a captain america game without his shield, you don't make a game based on a character without one of its main traits.   Even most XMEN games don't give a damn and always show a pristine wolverine.   Not a fair comparison, most XMEN games are pure crap and low budget, they don't focus too much on any one character because they can't afford it.   is pretty surprising   Well not much to argue about, I personally was not surprised.   Speaking of why does deadpools suit heal itself?   Because its a game, they don't want people to avoid it because the main character gets completely naked :)   There are numerous ways to visibly show the healing factor and these games picked an extremely similar method.   Because, again, its the one that made the most sense.   AFAIK these are the only two games that display characters & damage in this manner and they're from entirely different studios, I didn't expect that kind of visual presentation in either game which immediately makes it far more surprising than the bog standard grenade launcher...   Because I don't think there are any other games that focus a lot on the gore aspect and have main characters with exceptional regenerative abilities.  Like I said, its a matter of opinion, I see it as a given and personally didn't find it surprising."
SteamGameSwap,3dfudq,Mogazee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:33:11 2015 UTC,"Because it usually won't make sense   In many games like just cause sure it'd make no sense but I'd wager it'd make just as much sense in almost any game with a supernatural element though such as prototype, or infamous.   Not a fair comparison.   A completely fair comparison. it's comparing multiple instances of a character, and only once is his natural 'superpower' visually represented.   any other games that focus a lot on the gore aspect and have main characters with exceptional regenerative abilities.   Prototype and its sequel were pretty gore heavy, Neverdead was another that was primarily based around gore/healing. Most of the SUDA 51 games could have used it to some effect. It would work in a ton of fps games (despite that it wouldn't actually matter)  I'm sure I'm missing several from the last generation where healing factor is a plot point.    You're right, how surprising it is is a matter of opinion. Even if it isn't all that surprising, it's at least interesting that it isn't a more commonly used technique considering how many games feature regeneration."
SteamGameSwap,3dfudq,morriscey,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:51:25 2015 UTC,"I think you're looking at it wrong.  The vast majority of games use regenerating health  as a game mechanic first, plot device second. They shoehorn it into the plot sometimes just because they want it there mechanically, with Deadpool and Wolverine it was an already existing plot point and an important one which is why more emphasis was put on it.  I'm 100% certain that if Deadpool \ Wolverine didn't have those traits beforehand, the games would still have regenerating health just without the decay system, because there wouldn't have been a need for it to be there from the fan's side of things.  That's basically the reason you don't see it in more games, no reason to spend extra money on a system that exists for the mechanical side and not the plot side, but when its actually a plot point then it becomes important, its just that in the vast majority of games its nothing more than a very comfortable game mechanic for the devs. Building a game around regenerating health is easier than anything else."
