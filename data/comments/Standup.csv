It's a show."
Standup,3e3b95,Bartisnew,3,Tue Jul 21 20:21:07 2015 UTC,"It would be hard for me to choose, if it wasn't for Maria Bamford. I noticed whenever I would go on a kick of looking up material of a comic I just discovered and am really into, I noticed I would always think of my favorite comic as a tie between ""Louis CK and Maria Bamford,"" ""Bill Burr and Maria Bamford,"" etc. So, I just decided it's not a tie, I'm going with the constant in all those ties.  I do love the jokes themselves, but what sells me on her style is that she can be zany, but, in a way that is easy for me to relate to (intense anxiety, difficulty explaining feelingss to people who haven't experienced them themselves). Plus, she seems like the sweetest standup comic you'd ever want to meet.  The Maria Bamford Show is pretty awesome, if you haven't seen it. It takes a lot of the general themes of her comedy and puts them in an episodic story. You can easily find it free online."

Other people I like that kind of fit into that (not all stand up) are Douglas Adams, Fry and Laurie, Dara O'Briain, Eddie Izzard and Tim Minchin. That's not the only style I like but it's definitely one that really clicks with me."

Eventually I came to realize that, A) some audience members couldn't get past it and needed me to address it, and B) I was ignoring a big part of who I am.   When I started addressing it, I was careful not to be too bojangly about it, and I made sure that any joke about that would have to meet the same standard I had about all my other jokes. And now I think I've reached a place where I'm comfortable talking about it because my jokes are what I want to say to people, not what I or they think they want to hear from me.  You're gay, which I'm sure has influenced your perspective on so many things, but you're not ""a gay guy."" You're you. Part of that involves being gay, but there's more to you than that.

I'm white, but I'm greek and I am brown (i look indian which I reference), so i think I can hit some sort of sweet spot (if i do well).   But mixed crowds are looser and can accept a little more blue/racial humor than generally white audiences. As with anything, it depends on the joke, too, but generally speaking, you don't have to worry as much about offending people in my eyes.   If white crowds see a black dude laughing, it tends to open people up more from my experience in DC.    I did a joke about white girls/guys and their drinking, honestly laying into them about kate spade, starbucks and other brands (in a light hearted way), the crowd was mixed and for my first time doing it, the joke did well, but I am very very curious to see how well it does in front of a tighter, whiter group."

That doesn't mean white comics can go on a urban stage slinging the n word all over the place but they can make funny observations on black culture. Comics like Gary Owen excel at this. However white comedy rooms will SEEM uptight about race related jokes at first, but if you ease your way into the delivery they'll become more relaxed and start laughing.   Also in most cases, white comedy rooms are alot more prone to laughing at your material than in urban rooms. Like you could say something that's not funny but if you say it with confidence or give it a awkward delivery you'll still hear a chuckle or two. But if you try that same joke and approach at a urban crowd they'll just blankly stare at you or start heckling."
Standup,3e2uu7,electricrhino,2,Tue Jul 21 16:30:49 2015 UTC,"I started in white 'alt' rooms and it took me two years to finally say yes when a black promoter asked me to do his room.  The main difference that stands out to me is if you're bombing in a black room they'll will be quick to shutdown on you and shut you out.  I've seen people booed off the stage, or shut out (crowd just starts talking and quits on the comedian) and I've heard of people having keys shook at them to get off the stage.  If they love you they'll fall out of their seats, lol!! I've seen some guys with some weak jokes get big laughs giving a false sense of confidence to the comedians (happens in a lot of rooms though that cater to a particular style)"
Standup,3e2uu7,linearburrito,4,Tue Jul 21 23:16:15 2015 UTC,"Worked sound/security at a big room for 2 years. Had a weekly Apollo Night for the urban crowd, and as a white dude, it was fascinating.  For one, those comics care SO MUCH about the music they come up to. They would spend more time rehearsing their dance moves than their act. And constantly say ""hey dj back that up!"" so they could do a dance move again, or pretend to sing. I saw a white dude go up and just dance for like a minute before saying a word, because he knew the game. If he came up immediately with his ""YOU EVER NOTICE...??"" they'd have shouted ""Kill yourself!"" and started jingling keys at him.  As a white person, I find the whole spectacle to be a waste. Get to your jokes! You only have so much time! But you had to win the crowd first...it's a very odd dynamic. I'd love to try one day but the club got rid of that night. Literally no one on the club's staff wanted to work it. Including myself.   EDIT: am i being downvoted because you don't like/believe what i said? because it's exactly how it happened. how dare i answer the question?"

If you have jokes that talk about racial things and they're funny. The black crowds will love it. The same jokes won't do as well in front of a white crowd because they can be more uptight and don't know if it's okay to laugh.   Again. Just something I've heard don't know from experience.

Standup,3e0mp5,littledorgan,6,Tue Jul 21 03:39:41 2015 UTC,Hell yes to this. Morgan is extremely funny.  I'd like to add I just completely reject the OPs premise. I think the best stand ups are ALWAYS self deprecating. The  best stand up comes from pain not happiness and is reflected on stage.   Practically Louis CK'S entire shtick is built around this and no one comments on how it's destructive to men. It's fucking comedy for christ sake not a god damn motivational speech. I can't think of anything less damaging to comedy than someone needing to get up on stage for an agenda other than for the sake of being funny.  Edit: a word
Standup,3e0mp5,badattitude4u,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:18:51 2015 UTC,"Ah, I never blew it up to be a pattern of destructiveness. I was more just thinking about some common traits in current representation which seemed counter intuitive to what most critical discourse seemed to hunger for. It wasn't even just self deprecation, it was the straight-ahead type of it, which plays so highly into built out stereotypes. I do no think being that sort of cliche-drawing self deprecating is common to really any super great comedians.   In terms of being self deprecating in general; Seinfeld, Eddie Murphy, Carlin almost never come down on themselves. In females I don't really see it in classics like Ellen or Roseanne. In fact, I'd say its a pretty sharp component of those comedians that they are never that way. I think that's part of their character, to be so confident rather than playing into an expected type. Maybe that's why it came to mind in this interview."
Standup,3e0mp5,badattitude4u,2,Tue Jul 21 07:55:46 2015 UTC,"Totally disagree about Roseanne, most of her material is spent bemoaning how terrible her life is which voice to the frustration of millions of women in the country at the time which is what made her popular. She talked about how she was fat and felt like a loser constantly because of either external or internal influences.   Really for the most part Carlin and Seinfeld are oberservational comedians and don't really tend to be autobiographical at all so I don't know that you can really make a comparison. Even so with Carlin his humor was often built around a persona of how he was a terrible person and thinks of terrible things which is its own form of self deprecation. He used this to shock people and to try to make them think.  Many people would consider Pryor the greatest stand up of all time and he spent much of his career unabashedly talking about himself and his failures.  Arguably Louie is the biggest stand up in the world right now and most of his jokes are based around tearing himself down and making fun of himself.  I think it comes down to what type of comedian you like and what speaks to you. Making fun of yourself is a valid form of stand up and I don't think it should be gender restrictive nor do I think it's really fair to put the burden of the positive image of a women on a comedian."

Standup,3dyj6d,benelgermosen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:56:35 2015 UTC,I used to go to the occasional klimat mic and they're just as cliquey as anywhere else. It's just regulars being regulars.  The mic at the Angel Noir cafe on Thursdays is cool.

When I tell people about this mic, no one takes the bait, but when I take someone there they understand. You have the low stakes of an open mic, but you also get true audience feedback because most of the audience is either other (non-comedian & comedian) artists or their guests. It runs several days a week at different locations (Parkside Lounge is the one I go to). The only thing I suggest is to pay/sign-up before hand. The list can run long into the night and they sometimes have guests who open the show. It's $10 (+ 1.25 service fee to buy on line) which sounds expensive, but I promise it's worth it. Maybe a good place to run material you have been working on for a while. You can just buy a time slot through the link above.

By having performers pay 3, 5, 10 dollars it disscourages the usual drunk-ass perfomers or first timers that walk half the crowd. I run both types of shows. There's a big difference. And usually the pay-to-play performers get hit up by bookers and promoters to do paid gigs or interviews. It can be worth it. But most of the time not. The big one is when the crowd pays no admission, they are the wild west of shows."

Brace yourself for most people responding with ""Get on stage"" regardless of your disclaimer.  I personally have nothing against a class for standup. Some people are more inclined to learn from a classroom setting when they are unsure of pursuing a certain craft. I get it.   That said, I'm sure most comics that spent years grinding away on stage will probably criticize the notion of it. Classes sort of come across as circumventing the trial-by-fire nature of standup.   I say, do whatever you feel you'll get the most out of. As long as you're working hard with your stage time and writing, supplementing with a class is no big deal if that's your thing."
Standup,3dvroc,hippynoize,14,Sun Jul 19 23:01:15 2015 UTC,Eh. I never liked Mencia anyway. Finding out he was a hack just made me even less interested in him.

Standup,3dvroc,OKDokeComputer,8,Mon Jul 20 01:46:21 2015 UTC,"as a highlight Maron originally had a positive view on Mencia, and had him on the podcast.    Carlos Mencia came on and discussed allegations of his plagiarizing other comics. After the interview, Maron said that ""something didn't feel right"". He did further research, and interviewed comics Willie Barcena and Steve Trevino, who offered accounts of Mencia stealing material. Maron then contacted Mencia, who immediately returned for a follow-up interview. Mencia admitted that during the initial interview, he ""had an agenda"", and then went on to discuss the allegations and his reputation in a much less guarded, more forthright manner"

Also, he was kicked out because Mencia sold crazy tickets then, and they couldn't not pick a side, not saying that means he wasn't kicked out, but it doesn't mean the ""standup community"" didn't like it just because Mitzi Shore's son chose to side with the guy who was selling more tickets. Also, Louis CK left that agent/agency because they asked Joe to apologize."
Standup,3dvroc,SlightlyRyan,4,Mon Jul 20 05:16:53 2015 UTC,"He got kicked out of the store because he filmed and posted the video where he calls Mencia out during mencia's set. There is a VERY strict no filming rule at the comedy store. Joe broke that rule. thats why he was banned by Tommy Morris not necessarily for ""calling out"" Mencia ( the manager of the comedy store at the time) or whatever his fuckboy name was. Tommy got fired recently for stealing money from the comedy store. Adam Egot or Egget or something like that is the manager now, and quickly unbanned Joe Rogan."

Standup,3dvroc,JustCallMeDave,2,Mon Jul 20 04:06:31 2015 UTC,I read an article afterward about the anthropological aspects of the comedy community. Since you can't copywrite a joke the comedy community has agreed that theft is a serious taboo and will shun members who break the taboo. Any time I've heard the topic raised on other comedian's podcasts there was always support for Rogan and heaps of shit loaded on Mencia.  At some point Mencia made a video trying to 'own' the whole thing and talking about how he would steal anything even remotely funny. Very cringy stuff.  (As a side note: how the fuck did Mencia expect to get away with stealing one of the most iconic bits of all time?!? (Hi ma!))

Probably the most common was that it was kind of interesting drama, but not really any of our business either way. It might not have been Rogan's business to start, but neither is it our business that he wasn't minding his own business.   If I recall though, Rogan wasn't entirely unprovoked either. I think he hinted at the rumours at some point, and Mencia responded to the hint by escalating, and basically Streisanded himself.   But the standup community is made up of people like any other community, so you'll see opinions on either side, some informed, some uninformed.   I don't think the allegations ever really hurt Mencia's career either. He's still doing just fine."

And both are considered a comic's comic. Comics love what they are doing as they are, but the public not so much. Kaufman's act needed a bit more polish for main stream audiences to enjoy it. Kinder also has trouble appealing to main stream audiences. Kaufman was able to capitalize on trying out a relatively new art format & pushing it's limits - performance art. Rather reminds me of Ernie Kovacs."

In no order:   Post 90's George Carlin: I remember watching Life is Worth Losing with my dad when I was about 18 and being blown away by how honest and brutal it was, and that special holds a special place in my heart. Lewis Black: I've always loved his anger and his ability to make any politician or idea look ridiculous, and Black on Broadway is in my top 3 stand-up's ever. I even love his smart phone but from Rust in Peace. John Pinette: I first heard him at like 230 in the morning on Comedy Central from channel surfing. I was sitting with a buddy of mine who was a dude about the same size and we were both in hysterics listening to him talk about tequila and skiing as a fat guy.  Definitely miss him. Bill Maher: I'm gonna catch some crap for this, but I've been enjoying Maher's commentary and ""asshole-ish-ness"" for a long time. And honestly, it's just nice to see someone on his side of the coin actually be stubborn about his ideals. Also, I thought Religilous was a great film.

Honorable Mention: I'm going to give a shout out to someone whose name I don't even know. I was working in a bar at the time and the guy came in and talked for awhile. He was a stand-up and an office in the Navy, tall black guy, shaved head, this was in the Virginia Beach area, circa 2009-2010. I never caught his name but he had me and all of my customers in tears laughing (he was just sitting at the end of the bar doing his routine, not even on stage) from him talking about pretending to have a lazy eye (he would actually make his left eye independently roll in towards his nose while keeping his right eye dead straight) while training new recruits in formation and screaming at the wall to throw them off. I would love to find the guys name again, because he was an awesome person and would love to find out if he is still performing. The only other thing I can remember is he did some badass impressions of famous people, like early Jim Carrey quality.  Edit: A word and some more details."

Standup,3dmg60,funnymatt,7,Fri Jul 17 14:10:12 2015 UTC,"Just because the joke hasn't worked to that point doesn't mean those remaining tags won't work. It's happened to me a bunch of times that I swing and miss with jokes until the last tag or two works, and it's like ""ohh, THAT'S the joke!""  And if you're at an open mic with new jokes to tell, tell those jokes! That's the whole point. Trying those jokes is your assignment for the night, so don't bail on your assignment. Doing well at an open mic with jokes you already know work is not better than struggling with new jokes you're working on.  Just remember that open mics aren't shows. They may be all you get if you're new, but once you start treating open mics like they're practice and not games is when you'll really start to grow as a comic."
Standup,3dmg60,CircusMaximo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:20:28 2015 UTC,"I think you're right about tags. I think sometimes you get a joke out, and people want to laugh, but they suppress it because it feels like there's more to the joke and they want to hear the rest, and another tag gives them that opportunity, but if you're moving on to another premise they lose that pent-up laughter."

Don't make a big deal of it and be like ""ooooh wahhhhh that didn't work"" just move on to the next thing.  I have bits that can run 3 minutes, but if by the 2nd minute it's not working I'll drop it and move on. Gotta use stage time productively, it's not worth stubbornly sticking it out for the sake of a cohesive experience for an open mic audience."
Standup,3dmg60,beef_boloney,3,Fri Jul 17 14:11:48 2015 UTC,"It depends. If it just completely missed then it's possible they will think the tag is the punchline. If they heard the punch and thought ""that's terrible"" then the tag probably isn't going to bring it back. You have to play it by feeling - I'm always dropping and adding stuff depending on how the room is, and not just whether they laughed or not. This is exactly why people say 'keep going up'."
Standup,3dmg60,Comessuer,3,Fri Jul 17 13:57:06 2015 UTC,"Play it by ear. Sometimes, I know some tags always hit even if the firs punchline doesnt. I mean, thats the point right? The tags are meant to be funnier.  That being said, if I'm doing a long bit and the crowd isn't feeling it, I could skip to the end quick, or find a way to bail out of it. There are many bits where if the audience isn't buying it from the premise, you're fucked. FInd ways to escape."

I'll just skip that part."", the audience will usually laugh about that.  Of course you can't do that more than once in a performance and it should be used really really rarely anyways (I assume you try your new stuff on open stages). But sometimes you are in a situation where you're in risk of losing the audience, and I think a surprising cut would be better then."

And in a club, you know people are there to listen. There's no ambiguity about why people came to a comedy club.   At bars, I'll try new stuff sometimes, but I really like to practice crowd work. Because at a bar there is a lot of ambiguity about why people are there. Most people are there to be at the bar, there just  happen to be people doing comedy. So I'll practice my louder material that gets peoples attention because my other, more subdued stuff doesn't work there.   Coffee shops can be hit or miss. One of my favorite open mics around where I live is the place I started. It's a pretty big shop that's near a college town, so it gets fairly busy on mic nights. But I really like that people lay attention there, and its still one I go to regularly even though now it's way out of my way. On the other hand, some of the worst mics I've been to have been at coffee shops because at some places, people rarely stick around, and those that do are buried in whatever it is they came to do.   That's just my 2 cents."

My set is largely observational stuff and telling stories about my life, so one-liners aren't my strong suit. I find that when I stick to the observational ones, they tend to go over better, since that's what the rest of my act is like.   One time, I thought I would start with a really dumb one-liner, but really oversell it, since that's something I think is really funny, but have never done. Total silence.

Everyone goes awww, ""Even with a screwdriver"".  There's a beat there.  Office Pun, awesome.  Pretty sure you can make an outlook pun too.  Overly specific factually correct math jokes - awesome.  Love units stuff = tight, Breaking bad / GOT Joke was super good.    Personally, I would either flip the order of the 'gave me advice' / 'mean to me' bits, or I would punch up the 'mean to me in a dream' with something like the 'no-no', that little emotional inflection at the end, is what makes the 'gave me advice' bit hit so much harder.  Maybe 'You lost 5 points because you were mean to me in a dream, but then you redeemed yourself, and gained 7 points because you were mean to me in a sex dream.  You were all like ""Sarah Stop blowing my dad"", maybe a bit dirty for your persona, but you get the idea.  Either top the advice joke or switch the order.  But you can take the mean to me in a dream bit anywhere, loads of jumping off points for misdirection if you wanted to top it that way.

I've only recently starting getting an ""awww"" when saying it, I think because I used to say ""I never got that one back together"" as more of a throwaway line. I've thought about responding to the aww with ""I'm just kidding, they got divorced because of my dad's crippling alcoholism"" but think it might be too dark for my style.  Good call on the love units. That's the first time I said ""That's a big no no"" (wasn't even planning on saying it) so I was surprised by the big reaction. Normally ""mean to me in a dream"" hits harder but I think after my commentary it doesn't feel as big. I'll try it out in the other order.

People need to grow the fuck up, learn how to take a fucking joke, or stay the fuck away from standup comedy. If a person doesn't want to hear certain topics discussed then they should find a show that's right for them, they can go sit in a padded fucking room and watch videos of puppies frolicking for the rest of their lives for all I give a fuck.   What really gets me is that most of the pissy eyed faggots involved in the political correctness movement get offended on behalf of people they see as vulnerable. I'm a comedian. I was raped when I was 13. I have jokes about rape in my act. I'm not some kind of weak person that is easily triggered by words because of what happened to me. I don't need any cunt to step forward and fight my corner because something somebody said on stage made me feel bad. I don't need some wanker with a Tumblr, a Twitter, and a Facebook profile to try to ruin a comedians career because he made a joke about the thing that happened to me.   It was ten years ago this May that I was raped. I was a victim of rape for about an hour. It fucked me up for years. Until I realised that I was no longer a victim of rape, because the rape was over. If anything it made me a stronger person. I'm at least strong enough to take a fucking joke and to not melt away into a puddle of pathetic sludge at the very fucking utterance of the word 'rape'.   I'm also bi if you want to know if I have license to use 'faggot'. Guess I'm only half gay so I should probably only use half the word."

Stage time, writing, talking to other comics to get an idea of the business, and just hanging around and getting to know the people in your scene goes a long way to be good at stand-up.  Also, being self aware helps a lot too. Seriously, if you can't be unbiased towards each and every set then you won't get better, just a simple fact. Too many people keep thinking that they're great at stand-up but can't realize that they aren't getting laughs and that the business side won't happen without that.  If you can find a college that offers stand-up comedy as an elective or as a substitute for public speaking (it's doubtfully but could happen) then take it.

You might struggle to find one on a Saturday and Sunday.   I imagine you'd be able to do more than one on a couple of nights if you really timed it well and the organisers were nice enough to put you on first.

If I go a few months between doing a bit (even if it's one I've done hundreds of times), I need to prep it at a few mics before doing it in a show again. One thing that can help speed up that process is to have a good recording of yourself that you can listen to while driving to a gig- it will help you remember how to perform the bit the way you like to do."

Fade down from one cut at the same time as fade up for the next (meeting in the middle), makes it smoother. Basic audio trick we used constantly when recording music. Still obvious if the cuts suck, but better. I don't know if this was mastered but if it was, it should be done better. My roommate is asleep and I had to adjust volume multiple times during the video. Loud moments should be only slight louder than quiet ones - we'll know the volume based on intensity if vocals.  Secondly, wear that hat like a cop would. I know you look better wearing it weird but it takes me out of the sketch every time I see it. Cops don't look good, they look like cops. If the lighting sucks that way, light better.  Aaaaagh the audio again. Seriously it's start and stop.

That would explain it.  It's definitely not misogyny + confirmation bias + panicky justifications like this thread.

Standup,3de4es,Heilbroner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:33:01 2015 UTC,"Attracting a mate isn't the only purpose of humor.   No but it's a trait that men HAVE to be good at if they want to stay in the gene pool. Women don't HAVE to be funny   And physical attractiveness is not actually the only thing men value in women.   No but men value it over a woman being funny. If a woman is funny a guy counts it as a bonus.   Nor does anything else you've said, really. I'm guessing your job doesn't involve the rigorous application of logic.   Actually I work in logistics.   You said she's hot so she doesn't need personality.   No, I said she's hot and therefore doesn't NEED to be funny, she needs a personality though, otherwise she's a fembot.   Now you say she's NOT that hot...and that you're sure she DOES have a good personality...   She's hit the wall a little sure. Personality and being funny are separate things you know.   but you make the frankly insane claim that people with good personalities don't make jokes about blowjobs (nana is that you?)   I meant ""good"" as in ""clean, nice and unoffensive""   buuut the genesis of this whole thing was that you DO think her jokes are funny.   they're suspiciously funny, her whole schtick is.   Apparently every joke she's ever told, in fact, since you say she hasn't ""wrote (sic) one joke in her whole career.""   The jokes that made her career probably weren't written by her.   Hey since your idea of humor is quoting SNL sketches from the 90s, perhaps there's some self-selecting going on?   You're saying SNL sketches from the 90's aren't funny? I think you're the one with the problem.   In that women with a decent sense of humor want nothing to do with you? That would explain it.   Typical SJW, can't win an argument so they have to make attempts at personal insults.   It's definitely not misogyny + confirmation bias + panicky justifications like this thread.   Oh yeah, total SJW, there's the buzzwords right there.   ""UHHH UHHH SHIT I LAUGHED SHIT FUCK UMMMMM I BET A MAN WROTE THAT JOKE, whew that was close, I almost had to learn something...""   I almost had to learn you could use a light saber as a dildo? You know Amy's comedy isn't exactly deep, which is part of why it's suspicious...."
Standup,3de4es,ComicAnonymous,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:56:54 2015 UTC,"Oof, lot of dumb to get through here.  First off, not all men are funny dude. Far from it. Plenty of bros gettin' laid who have shitty senses of humor. I think you know this, but I guess for your halfassed worldview to make sense you have to pretend all dudes must be funny.   She's hit the wall a little sure. Personality and being funny are separate things you know.   God help me, I dared to paraphrase the need for humor as the need for personality. Not just a bigot, a pedant too. Cool.  In my mind they're kinda the same, someone with no sense of humor has a shitty personality.  Shocking to see you use your little clubhouse lingo like ""The Wall."" You redpill babies with your terms, it'd be cute if it weren't so hateful and sad.   I meant ""good"" as in ""clean, nice and unoffensive""   So...you have looked at her, and based solely on what she looks like (and her gender, natch) instead of the personality she shows onstage/in interviews/etc etc, you've decided you know what this total stranger's personality REALLY is. And wouldn't you know, it's like an old nun or something, the kind of personality that would never say the things she says in her act, lending more credence to the idea of ghostwriters and an entirely fabricated persona. Absurd leaps in logic. You into Alex Jones bruh?    they're suspiciously funny, her whole schtick is...The jokes that made her career probably weren't written by her.   I like how you say stuff you made up as fact. I bet that fools a lot of the idiots you associate with into taking you seriously.  I'm a comedian. I actually know how this stuff works, and you're a fool if you think someone is writing her entire act uncredited. So there has to be another explanation. Maybe look for a simpler one, like that razor thing you learn about in grade school. I dunno you're in logistics, figure it out.  Oh also, she's not even really that great at standup. I can think of dozens of better female comics. If she's the one that got this reaction from you..well, more evidence for your shitty sense of humor. Or maybe you've just never actually seen a woman do comedy before?   You're saying SNL sketches from the 90's aren't funny? I think you're the one with the problem.   No, I'm saying that people who aren't funny just quote things actual funny people said once and think that's humor. Do I make you horny baby? My wife!   Typical SJW, can't win an argument so they have to make attempts at personal insults.   Typical dumdum, lumping anyone who disagrees with them into one big category so it's easier to ignore whatever they say, that way dummy's poor brain doesn't have to bother with new thoughts or information. Misogyny exists y'know...calling it a ""buzzword"" is a way to pretend it doesn't. Confirmation bias? Also a real thing! Anyone who thinks they're never guilty of confirmation bias has no self-awareness.   I almost had to learn you could use a light saber as a dildo? You know Amy's comedy isn't exactly deep, which is part of why it's suspicious....   Wow. Whoosh. That's embarrassing. No, what you almost had to learn (by simply accepting the reality in front of you) is that maybe your sweeping generalization isn't true (CRAZY RIGHT? Those are usually such a great way to understand the world!) but then you told yourself a man wrote it, so you successfully avoided wrinkling your brain for another day.  If Amy's comedy were ""deep"" it would be less suspicious? Women can write DEEP comedy, but not vulgar comedy? I don't even think YOU know what you're talking about."
