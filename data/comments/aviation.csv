aviation,3e3dj2,Laidoutrivi63,2,Tue Jul 21 19:19:34 2015 UTC,"The legit answer is that the aircraft was likely landed in water nearby (lake, etc) and then put on a truck much like a boat (wings removed), taken to the maintenance shop, fixed/inspected, and then instead of trucking it back, and since they already put it on a truck...this."

You can go inside them as well.    To me, the main difference was that the Soviet engineers couldn't get the stability at slow speeds under control so in the end they had to install these retractable canard wings, making the plane heavier and costing space. Concorde engineers, however, did get it under control by clever wing design."
aviation,3e1rg8,MarineLife42,7,Tue Jul 21 12:17:39 2015 UTC,"Russian brute force approach to problem solving. Doesn't always work unfortunately. Tu144 is really good looking, but if Concorde couldn't make a buck, there was no way the Tu144 was going to come even close."
aviation,3e1rg8,agha0013,9,Tue Jul 21 12:27:11 2015 UTC,"In the short time the Tu144 flew regularly, tickets were to be had at throwaway prices. Even more than Concorde, the Tu144 was a prestige project and never even expected to make money. Same with the other planes in a communist country - they were there to facilitate transport, not to turn a profit."
aviation,3e1rg8,MarineLife42,4,Tue Jul 21 12:32:59 2015 UTC,"And think of what they could have done with their technology sector with all the funding lost paying for prestige projects they didn't need just to save face with the West.   Things like the Buran space program sucked massive amounts of funding from them, and I'm sure many of their engineers and project managers knew there was no way they could make things work with their current tech levels.   Russians build amazing airframes, but their engines and avionics are really far behind (less so now, but still) Those prestige projects were cool, but they were too costly.   Then again, hindsight is always 20/20. At the time they probably thought there was a way it could work."
aviation,3e1rg8,agha0013,4,Tue Jul 21 12:36:14 2015 UTC,"In the end, it was their massive military spending that killed them. The costs for Tu144, Buran and a few others are dwarfed by what they spent on nuclear missiles and a huge standing army. BTW - the Buran is also on exhibition, albeit at the museum's Speyer branch - about 45mins away by car and just as awesome."
aviation,3e1rg8,MarineLife42,4,Tue Jul 21 12:40:10 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see that place one day, just an amazing collection of rare aircraft that you can actually get up close to, or inside of.   I'd have loved to see the Buran facility before it collapsed too. The pictures that came out a few weeks ago were such a tease."

aviation,3e1rg8,The_Pussy_Wizard,4,Tue Jul 21 14:55:10 2015 UTC,"To me, the main difference...   True but I think there was also a difference in philosophy - the Russian approach has always been very pragmatic., Why waste resouces making your wing, which works perfectly well at mach 2.0, work at low speeds when you can just nail a canard to the front?"

Supposedly, the military engines available today are not efficient enough to make any sort of commercial operation viable. The cost of retrofitting new engines on the existing airframes would be prohibitive, and you would be almost better off designing a new supersonic transport.   Military fuel consumption is on a whole other scale compared to commercial, and most of their longer range flights require mid air fueling which wouldn't work for Concorde without a serious refit, and even more detrimental effects to the aircraft's performance.   Essentially what I was told is Concorde's engines were made to be as efficient as possible while supersonic, where as most military engines are more efficient subsonic, and guzzlers when supersonic, so they spend most of their time sub sonic."
aviation,3e08kz,agha0013,2,Tue Jul 21 12:24:17 2015 UTC,"And you won't be allowed to go supersonic over most of the populated land mass, so in reality you'd need an engine that is efficient in both regimes...which is hard."
aviation,3e08kz,tecnanaut,2,Tue Jul 21 12:34:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, very hard. You'd essentially have to carry two sets of engines, one for each mode of operation, so more dead weight.   People are working on the engines that could change this, but it takes time and money, and there isn't very much money for the research. Military doesn't have a need for high weight supersonic aircraft and the powerful engines needed to make that happen at the moment."

Both 32s are about to be permanently removed right after they open the 4th parallel East West runway 28L/10R.

aviation,3dydry,Rhaedas,22,Tue Jul 21 04:55:36 2015 UTC,"Right and wrong. Even if tethered, you shouldn't load the aircraft to the point where the tether is being pulled against. Tethers have indicators in them to show if they've been pulled on, and they have to be replaced if so. They are a last insurance to keep the plane from completely doing this.  I don't see any tether hooks in the ground, so they would have had to use a weight cart. My guess is one couldn't be found, or someone in charge was in a hurry or just plain negligent on how to unload a plane.  Aircraft CAN be loaded without either doing sequential loading, but you have to be very careful to have ballast upfront at all time."
aviation,3dydry,platinum_peter,9,Mon Jul 20 16:56:52 2015 UTC,"Exactly. We were talking about that at work. Everyone is trained on sequential loading. So they were either careless, or had no idea what they were doing."

aviation,3dydry,HaiWorld,2,Mon Jul 20 21:26:15 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.  The closer the center of gravity to the main wheels the more weight the mains take compared to the nose gear, and the plane will have a lower rotation speed at takeoff. Being an updated DC-10, the MD-11 might have had some more weight placed aft than forward and then being unable to really move the main gear to compensate."
aviation,3dydry,MrStamper,2,Tue Jul 21 00:14:52 2015 UTC,"I've heard the MD-11 was deliberately designed to be tail heavy to be more aerodynamically efficient. For most commercial aircraft, in level flight the horizontal stabilizer exerts a downward force to maintain pitch. If I recall correctly, the MD-11 uses an unusually aft center of gravity to reduce the force (and drag) from the horizontal stabilizer."

aviation,3dydry,Rhaedas,7,Mon Jul 20 17:59:41 2015 UTC,"It's all about capacity. It's got three engines, but that's because it needs it. They aren't as powerful and efficient as modern ones.  The MD-10s (the older, smaller versions) are steadily being retired, and the plan is for them to be replaced by the more efficient 767s.

aviation,3dydry,wggn,3,Mon Jul 20 18:23:39 2015 UTC,"They loaded too heavy stuff in the back. I think they have a support brace that can be put under the tail section to prevent this, but they failed to use it in this case."
aviation,3dydry,ryanw183,7,Mon Jul 20 15:59:17 2015 UTC,"Most of the FedEx planes now are nose tethers, now that the 727 is gone. Feeders still have a tail stand, but I don't know if any of the larger planes have one. I've seen 747s loaded from other companies that have a tail stand, but that seems terribly inadequate for that size. But like I mean above, all these anti-tip devices are a last measure to resist happening what should never get to that point with proper loading."

They wouldn't be turning into us like that though, they would either be climbing or descending for altitude separation.  It very well could be real, but every time I see this gif posted, first thing I think is its CGI from something like Lock On, or DCS.  Edit:  lol at downvotes!  It's simply my OPINION as an actual AF pilot that sees this stuff regularly.  This particular clip out of the entire video is the one that just does not check due to the way the aircraft moves.  If you do some research, one of their clients was CJ Entertainment which produced the movie R2B, a Korean fighter pilot film which features the F-15K, which makes sense.  Do yourself a favor and watch this clip and tell me that there is no CGI in it and same with the one posted above ""ROKAF"" ad and I'll gladly retract my opinion.  That shot where all the F15s had their afterburners lit while flying in formation with their AWACS equivalent also appears to be an afterthought added in.

aviation,3dvqcg,mrbubbles916,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:54:20 2015 UTC,"I am going to guess that CJ Entertainment was a client of theirs in the respect that they provided some of the real shots for the movie. The movie is clearly CGI but there is at least one clip in that video with F-15's that is not CGI and it's probably their work.  Honestly to my eyes the gif has too much detail to be from a video game or from CGI. The way the beacon light pulses and reflects on the aircraft surfaces is very very realistic. Also the way the edge of the exhaust plume fluctuates looks very genuine to me as well. Another thing you have to remember about the way it looks is that a camera can and will look different from the way your eyes operate. In low light situations, cameras vs human eyes are almost never equal. It's not surprising that it looks different to you.  As far as the downvotes, that is just how reddit is designed. Posts that either don't make sense or don't contribute to the thread often get downvoted and opinion based comments very often do not provide factual information at all. Unfortunately the only thing going for you is that you fly in the Air Force but that doesn't make your opinion right or wrong. It's still just an opinion.  In order to provide some factual information in my own post here is a snippet from the content creators(Wolfe Air) source video on Vimeo. This F-15 GIF is taken directly from the video.  ""These shots were filmed in close formation with the Vectorvision camera system installed in the highly modified Wolfe Air LearJet 25. Cameras used are the Red Epic and Arriflex Alexa.""  I'm not so sure that a production company like this needs CGI when they have their own Learjet to use.  https://vimeo.com/70994185  Edit: If you guys are going to downvote this comment then please explain why. I'd love to hear your own opinion on this."

aviation,3dz09q,Ke7ch,12,Tue Jul 21 18:53:49 2015 UTC,I have wondered this myself. I think it's to prevent any radials from being blocked as VORs rely on line of sight. There's a lot of tall structures around it. The A/FD  says that it doesn't have any unusable radials.

aviation,3dz8r4,GG2ZC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:50:40 2015 UTC,I was at a luncheon with a US airline executive a couple years ago. He was talking about how the European majors who'd picked up the A380 (AF/LH/BA) were getting smoked by the middle east carriers; the effect was that the european carriers were redeploying their A380s to US routes and dumping capacity on the market because it wasn't economical on their originally contemplated markets.   My guess is the european carriers won't make the same mistake twice -- still not clear to me that there's a market for this.

aviation,3dx3i1,7Seyo7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:12:26 2015 UTC,"Lets see if we can think our way around that.. Robot driven cart capable of adjusting its speed and position based on the aircraft type and remotely controlled down the centerline at speed. Pilot lines up on the centerline behind the cart and the cart grabs the wings and holds them and the plane rolls out on the cart to a wheels up landing. I can see it in my minds eye. Maybe an air cushion to set down on top of? Sliding in on the belly seems like we could use some technology to increase the chances and reduce the damage to plane and pilot. Thinking outside of the box is what moves us forward or you can just land on your belly, smack the prop, bend the crank and walk away."
aviation,3dx3i1,MrRibbotron,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:40:22 2015 UTC,"Hmm. It sounds too easy. I think it'd be really hard to do that without a propstrike, unless the plane would fly ahead of the cart and wait for the cart to catch up and somehow land on it. Sounds like there's a lot that could go wrong. Like how do you prevent the plane from sliding off the cart once it's on it without damaging the aircraft? Air cushions on the side? In that case you'll either have to make an adaptable design or have one cart for every different plane.   It would be a lot easier if there was no prop to worry about, but jet aircraft are typically heavier so unless you want to turn the runway into the world's largest inflatable trampoline the whole thing will probably not work out.   Here's another idea: How about airbags for (small) aircraft? For example, the aircraft above could have two airbags, one under each wing, that would inflate to a sufficient size to keep the prop away from the ground. The problems that would have to be solved are:   Size. Can an airbag large enough to prevent the prop from striking the ground be made small enough that it can fit under a wing without seriously impairing the aircraft's performance? How do you prevent a nose-over on landing? ?"

Engineering is the answer. Matching the speed of the aircraft, giving the pilot a good visual cue and line up, capture of the aircraft and finally slowing the aircraft with directional stability.  NASA went to the moon, some bright designer and engineer can come up with a design for Light Singles and Twins."

aviation,3dx3i1,DreamArcher,2,Mon Jul 20 19:42:27 2015 UTC,"Dramatic moment a Spitfire lands without any wheels. [0:57]   This is the nail-biting moment, reminiscent of the Battle of Britain, when a skilled pilot was forced to carry out an emergency landing of his replica Spitfire - without any WHEELS.  The aircraft was flying at Sibson Airfield when the worried pilot radioed airfield bosses to say he couldn't release his landing gear.  Skydivers jumping at the airfield in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, were grounded as the brave pilot circled for more than 20 minutes in a bid to frantically burn fuel.  Emergency services arrived at the scene just as the stunning one-man plane was carefully flown towards the ground in strong winds by the nervous expert.  But amazingly he managed to land the replica fighter plane without ANY landing gear - skillfully skimming the aircraft over the grass on its belly.  Relieved onlookers said the propeller fell off when it came to a safe stop, and the relieved pilot was completely unharmed.   SWNS TV in News & Politics  59,957 views since Jul 2015   bot info"

aviation,3dtg86,jamesvini,2,Mon Jul 20 08:05:37 2015 UTC,"I was an aviation supply marine(6672) and helped support the first V-22 squadron to deploy in Iraq.  By my memory, at least 75% of all their birds were partial mission capable and they frequently had to cannibalize parts from several aircraft to keep up with maintenance.  It has a lot more components in comparison to its predecessor the CH-46 Sea Knight(also had experience with) which makes maintenance more difficult.  It can't maneuver very well in hover mode because it's a compromise between a helicopter and a plane.  It also doesn't even have the option to use side turrets(like the CH-46) because its wings would be in the way.  Therefor, it's not very useful in a hot landing zone. Last I heard they were adding an ""all aspect gun system"" underneath the craft.  IMHO, that's still not as good as having side turrets which use human line of sight.  Side turrets would probably be easier to maintain as well. It's best use would be for missions which require fast cargo transportation between FOBs that don't have runways and minimal enemy danger.  Sure every new aircraft has issues to fix when starting out but I think I can safely say the V-22 was beyond the norm.   I think it costs approximately twice as much as the CH-46.  With that money the military probably could have bought two veteran/blood tested CH-46s at a discount."

Parts of the fleet will be leased to Cityline but continue flying for Lufthansa with the same livery. Pilots from Cityline and cabin crew from Lufthansa. Most A343 will continue to fly for the mainline as there is a limit to the number of aircraft LH can let other airlines operate. This is due to contracts with our unions.
aviation,3dt45d,tabernaq,2,Sun Jul 19 18:15:33 2015 UTC,"Well thanks for clearing that up. I'd assumed LH got rid of them, because I haven't seen any LH A343 at MUC (EDDM) for at least one and a half years."

aviation,3dt45d,reshan,4,Sun Jul 19 14:03:15 2015 UTC,Do they have self-contained oxygen systems?
aviation,3dt45d,tabernaq,8,Sun Jul 19 17:29:11 2015 UTC,It wouldn't need it. The cargo deck on commercial airliners is pressurized as part of the cabin.

aviation,3dt45d,tabernaq,3,Mon Jul 20 04:16:00 2015 UTC,It would need it in case of depressurization. (it would need some equivalent of the masks that drop down for regular passengers). Chances are it probably just has its own bottle.
aviation,3dt45d,BenHurMarcel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:22:11 2015 UTC,"No, there are oxygen masks in each bunk."
aviation,3dt45d,tabernaq,0,Sun Jul 19 23:27:55 2015 UTC,"Thats right, there are no bottles. That way, if there is a fire down there it doesnt give it fuel. There are only the oxygen generators with the masks. In case of decompression we stay down there. That is because the pilots will do an emergency descent and we need to stay buckled up. In case of a fire we switch off the air-conditioning and close all hatches. Then we release halon into the MCR to extinguish the fire. Might be different in other airlines' crew rests, but thats how we do it."
aviation,3dt45d,XFScola,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:16:38 2015 UTC,"It's pressurised but that doesn't imply fresh air distribution and temperature control. Crew rest compartments have those obviously. I don't know how it works for mobile crew rests, but they're probably linked to a specific air distribution pipe."
aviation,3dt45d,cbmuser,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:20:18 2015 UTC,They are linked and there is temperature control. An alarm sounds in case the air conditioning fails or smoke is detected. There are several smoke detectors which are way more sensitive than in the lavatories. For that reason aerosols may not be used down there.

aviation,3dtp4o,CumcakeEater,28,Sun Jul 19 10:38:36 2015 UTC,"When approaching a target, fighters will use the terrain to avoid radar detection. To do this, you generally aim to stay under 200-300ft AGL. At the speeds fighters travel, staying close to the terrain requires upwards of 7Gs, which no fighter will do in negative G. Therefore, you have to invert, pull, set, and roll back. This maneuver is ""evasive"" in the sense that it is to evade radar detection."
aviation,3dtp4o,pastarockets,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:30:02 2015 UTC,"We can do negative maneuvers; it's just not comfortable to do them close to the ground. However, it still remains an option."

aviation,3dtp4o,Voltairrible,22,Tue Jul 21 16:10:58 2015 UTC,This is just a ridge-line crossing. Not an evasive maneuver.
aviation,3dtp4o,Superkeys,3,Sun Jul 19 14:33:47 2015 UTC,I've always wondered why fighters will roll inverted to go down into valleys like that. Is there a reason they're trying to avoid negative G?

aviation,3dtp4o,pastarockets,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:31:04 2015 UTC,So what Pasta Rocket is saying in their post? This maneuver in particular is to preserve the airframe than the pilot?
aviation,3dtp4o,amateur_driver,7,Sun Jul 19 14:37:40 2015 UTC,The airframes are built with the limitations of the pilots in mind. You could build a jet that can handle +9/-9Gs but human bodies fail way before that. So they build the structure of the jet to be able to happily operate in a range that squishy meatbags can handle.
aviation,3dtp4o,Guysmiley777,6,Sun Jul 19 15:12:13 2015 UTC,"Next limiting design factor after humans is the engine.  They have incredibly tight tolerances and  massive gyroscopic forces. Even slight g induced deformations will cause damage.  F135 had initial problems with this. It's huge engine for a fighter.   Even if we remove the pilot from the fighter, it would soon become impractical to build big engines that can take more  g-forces orthogonal to the turbine axis.   Smaller engines or ramjets would be only solutions available."
aviation,3dtp4o,LtCmdrData,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:16:04 2015 UTC,"It's not to preserve the airplane. It's that the plane won't physically do -7Gs. And if it could, it would wreck the pilot. Wings like to go up (+G) not down."

aviation,3dwzog,spitfire5181,2,Mon Jul 20 07:04:27 2015 UTC,Go to college and get your engineering degree. If your still interested think about doing ROTC (You have a year or two before you have to commit). Another possibility after college would be to look into Air National Guard or OCS. Those will guarantee a flight spot though you still have to get through training.   While it's good to have specific goals like being a fighter pilot. Understand that there are a lot of different aircraft in the military. So be prepared to fly any of them. The only way to guarantee a specific aircraft would be the Air National Guard route.  Edit: All this information was learned by reading other threads like this. I have friends who fly in the military but I haven't really talked to them. Check out the sidebar of r/aviation there's a guide to becoming a military pilot.

GBAS has several advantages in comparison to traditional ILS. One GBAS station can support multiple runway ends and reduce the total number of systems at an airport. This reduces the Very High Frequency (VHF) requirements and simplifies airport infrastructure. Unlike ILS - which requires one frequency per system - a GBAS only requires one VHF assignment for up to 48 individual approach procedures. The GBAS has more flexible siting criteria, allowing the GBAS to serve runways which ILS is unable to support. A GBAS is sited to minimize critical areas which place fewer restrictions on aircraft movement during ground taxi and air operations. The GBAS approach guidance is steadier than ILS approach guidance. Also, GBAS requires less frequent flight inspections compared to those required of ILS systems."

The F-16 pilot responded and advised the controller that he was ""looking"" for the traffic. At 1100:26, the controller advised the F-16 pilot, ""turn left heading 180 if you don't have that traffic in sight."" The pilot responded by asking, ""confirm 2 miles?"" Eight seconds later, the controller stated, ""if you don't have that traffic in sight turn left heading 180 immediately."" Over the next 18 seconds, the track of the F-16 began turning southerly.  At 1100:49, the radar target of the F-16 was located 1/2 nautical mile northeast of the Cessna, at an indicated altitude of 1,500 feet, and was on an approximate track of 215 degrees. At that time, the Cessna reported an indicated altitude of 1,400 feet, and was established on an approximate track of 110 degrees. At 1100:52 the controller advised the F-16 pilot, ""traffic passing below you 1,400 feet.""   That was it for ATC communications, and the collision occurred within 30 seconds of the last call."

If the Cessna had PCAS, and the jet had TCAS it, would have advised one to dive and the other to climb.  This may be related to why the ATC only gave instructions to turn.  I believe that for collision avoidance the ATC only gives instructions to turn and the TCAS gives instructions to change altitude, so the instructions never conflict."
aviation,3drv1w,Who_GNU,9,Sat Jul 18 23:49:16 2015 UTC,"Very few military aircraft actually have TCAS, and the F16's only have have GCAS.  The controller only gave turns because... He hoped they wouldn't hit.  There was absolutely no reason to cancel his approach and give him a climb unless there was traffic above."
aviation,3drv1w,NiceGuyUncle,4,Sat Jul 18 23:56:10 2015 UTC,Avionics technician here:  Can confirm; most fighters don't have TCAS
aviation,3drv1w,twelveparsex,2,Sun Jul 19 14:41:42 2015 UTC,"I believe that for collision avoidance the ATC only gives instructions to turn...   Incorrect. Per FAAO 7110.65:  b. Aircraft Conflict/Mode C Intruder Alert. Immediately issue/initiate an alert to an aircraft if you are aware of another aircraft at an altitude that you believe places them in unsafe proximity. If feasible, offer the pilot an alternate course of action. When an alternate course of action is given, end the transmission with the word “immediately.” PHRASEOLOGY− TRAFFIC ALERT (call sign) (position of aircraft) ADVISE YOU TURN LEFT/RIGHT (heading), and/or CLIMB/DESCEND (specific altitude if appropriate) IMMEDIATELY. EXAMPLE− “Traffic Alert, Cessna Three Four Juliet, advise you turn left immediately.” or “Traffic Alert, Cessna Three−Four Juliet, advise you turn left and climb immediately.”"
aviation,3drv1w,irish56_ak,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:40:38 2015 UTC,"The flight controller should absolutely keep them separated by altitude and TCAS should only be relied on in what is essentially an emergency. TCAS will override any altitude instructions from ATC, but it is most certainly their responsibility at all times."
aviation,3drv1w,PurpleComyn,7,Sun Jul 19 23:30:56 2015 UTC,Sounds like the controller got lazy as fuck.  The fact that they saw a target from 200 feet to 1400 feet tells me the controller was at least aware he was there for longer than a 2 mile traffic call.  Based on this it sounds like the controller is about to be strung up.
aviation,3drv1w,NiceGuyUncle,12,Sat Jul 18 23:46:32 2015 UTC,"Laziness is all that is.  I'll vertically separate 2 vfr guys if one is military and he doesn't have traffic in sight prior to 5~ miles and the F16 was damn IFR, there's no reason not to.  He was controlling on hope that the cessna would see him and get out of the way.  Frustrating being a controller and seeing that."
aviation,3drv1w,NiceGuyUncle,9,Sun Jul 19 00:35:43 2015 UTC,"Well he didn't give traffic until he was 2 miles from the cessna, and then no positive control saying ""if not in sight"" bullshit.  Approach clearance canceled climb and maintain 3,000 expect box pattern for another approach.  How hard is that.  I wasn't there and I don't know how busy he was, but the damn F16 was IFR but he treated him like a VFR guy until the end."
aviation,3drv1w,NiceGuyUncle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:44:24 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit confused by the traffic advisory... if he's IFR, why is he being asked to visually ident traffic?  Side question probably more suited to a military pilot: do you work the radar during IFR?  Would a radar track suffice instead of a visual ident in a situation like this if there was limited visibility?"
aviation,3drv1w,littlelowcougar,4,Sun Jul 19 00:47:20 2015 UTC,"Giving traffic to an IFR guy to get it in sight is odd in that he was given that 2 miles from the traffic, but even as an IFR pilot the baseline is still see and avoid.  So, if he got it in sight at his discretion he could turn or climb to avoid.  I do it all the time for guys descending into or climbing out of my airspace, vfr traffic in sight?  Descend and maintain 3,000 cause if you have it in sight you sure as hell aren't going to run into it unless you lied to me."
aviation,3drv1w,NiceGuyUncle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:59:06 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah, I just read elsewhere that an IFR pilot is still responsible for visual separation if it's VMC, and it sounds like your ops procedures would be a little different in VMC vs IMC (i.e. you'd never ask traffic in sight if it were IMC, right?).  I also figure that's why you need a safety pilot if you're flying IFR under the hood in VMC conditions.  (Well, one of the reasons.)  It's interesting... at least as a student pilot, anyway.  I don't think I've ever really considered the fact that IFR in VMC is subtly different to IFR in IMC -- but it obviously makes sense.  (And if it were IMC, that Cessna should have also been IFR, and as such, would have been in contact with the controller, obviously.)"
aviation,3drv1w,littlelowcougar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:40:45 2015 UTC,Traffic call first.  Vector second.
aviation,3drv1w,m5726,2,Sun Jul 19 17:23:10 2015 UTC,ATCs only responsible for IFR IFR separation. They can give advisories about VFR traffic but they are not required to separate IFR traffic from VFR traffic. VFR traffic has the responsibility to see and avoid. Ultimately this will be the Cessna pilots fault. It's a tough situation because I know that the F16 is a pretty difficult aircraft to spot given its speed and cross section.
aviation,3drv1w,ajwakeboarder,7,Sun Jul 19 17:29:45 2015 UTC,*In class D and G airspace.  IFR/VFR aircraft separation is provided in B and C airspace.
aviation,3drv1w,BoyLilikoi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:49:13 2015 UTC,That's true.
aviation,3drv1w,ajwakeboarder,2,Sun Jul 19 01:19:42 2015 UTC,"Wrong. Controllers are not just responsible for IFR IFR but keeping IFR clear from VFR targets as well. Traffic advisories to VFR aircraft are an additional service. Not sure if this took place in Charleston's class C airspace, if it did, there are actual separation standards between VFR/IFR aircraft as well.  I watched the radar replay of the event today. The controller was not busy. The cessna's target was also unverified so the 1400ft altitude could have not been confirmed and could have been the exact same altitude as the F16 when it was indicating 1500. There were not many planes on the scope, I don't understand how he/she didn't climb the F16 immediately."
aviation,3drv1w,m5726,2,Sun Jul 19 01:36:21 2015 UTC,"I hear controllers vector IFR around VFR flights all the time. The controller tries to contact the VFR a few times, but if nothing works they just vector the IFR traffic around them.  I know, rules are rules and they don't have to, but down here they seem to do it anyway. Maybe our rules are different... not sure."
aviation,3drv1w,Schnooks,2,Sun Jul 19 01:43:14 2015 UTC,"Controllers are not just responsible for IFR IFR but keeping IFR clear from VFR targets as well.   That's simply not true, outside of Class B and C airspace. Think about it: VFR traffic in Class E airspace are not required to have transponders, nor to communicate with ATC - so how can ATC possibly have the responsibility to separate them from IFR traffic? ATC provides traffic advisories to IFR traffic where possible, but VFR/IFR separation in Class E comes down to 14 CFR 91.113(b):   When weather conditions permit, regardless of whether an operation is conducted under instrument flight rules or visual flight rules, vigilance shall be maintained by each person operating an aircraft so as to see and avoid other aircraft."
aviation,3drv1w,yellowstone10,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:41:23 2015 UTC,"See how well that holds up when the controller is sitting in court and a lawyer asked if he did all he could to keep the aircraft from hitting. Again, the controller was not busy, and the first duty priority is to prevent collisions and issuing safety alerts."
aviation,3drv1w,m5726,0,Sun Jul 19 03:59:56 2015 UTC,"From what you posted it sounds like the F-16 pilot could have reacted quicker.  If there's co-altitude traffic within 2 miles of my plane I'd be taking aggressive action to deconflict with that traffic, especially without having it in sight.  That being said the controller could have made the urgency of the situation more apparent.  I wasn't there and hindsight is 20/20.  The incident stands as a good warning to take traffic calls seriously."
aviation,3drv1w,dog_in_the_vent,-7,Sun Jul 19 03:00:20 2015 UTC,"Possibly the viper driver wasnt sure of what the controller said, and wanted to make damn sure of what he was told so to not make the situation worse. That probably accounts for the minimal delay. I'm definitely putting the blame on the controller being a lazy fuck. He needs jail time at the least. Also, what the fuck is the cessna pilot doing? Not squawking and not talking to anyone and not being on ff is so fucking dumb in this day and age. Sure, it's legal, but it's definitely not smart."

I'm on a descent with a direct to destination from 4000 or so, controller tells me ""traffic 12 o'clock 4 miles 1200 climbing Cessna 172.""  Which I respond that I'm looking for but he has to know that I'm not likely to see him below me, right?  Apparently not...  Controller comes back a few seconds later ""traffic 12 o'clock 2 miles climbing indicated 2000, converging""  And I tell him I still don't see it.  I only have TIS and there's no service in this location.  5 seconds or so later a different voice comes on and gives me an immediate turn.  I assume this was the supervisor putting a stop to the bad situation.  Mine was a high wing/low wing scenario, I'm in a 'HP' single, descending at 175 knots or so and I'm sure the Cessna is climbing at 90 or so.  So the obvious question is ""shit, man, why didn't you just move me earlier?  I know I'm supposed to look when it's VFR conditions but it's a lot easier on everyone involved to just tell me to move.

aviation,3dqvex,Screaming_Emu,-3,Sat Jul 18 18:16:20 2015 UTC,"This might sound heartless, but life is about choices.  I chose to work my ass off to be able to become a pilot instead of working the ramp.  Getting certified and getting a flying job was not easy in the slightest.  I worked a ramp for a while before I got to where I am today, so I'm not entirely without empathy.  I do have an easier job, sometimes, but it's a job that I earned."
aviation,3dqvex,dog_in_the_vent,14,Sat Jul 18 18:24:21 2015 UTC,"I partially agree. Life is about choices, but not everyone is given the same test.   I busted my butt, but I also had a lot of help along the way. Almost anyone can do the job itself though. It's getting there that is the hard part.   I do think that working a tough job like that should be part of growing up though. Manual labor, food service, retail, etc teaches many lessons and (for me at least) provides the motivation to work hard and move up and out."
aviation,3dqvex,Screaming_Emu,5,Sat Jul 18 19:21:20 2015 UTC,This is the position I'm at right now. School is not cheap. With this I get to hang around aircrafts all day so that's cool!
aviation,3dqvex,sweetcheek,7,Sat Jul 18 20:17:30 2015 UTC,I worked as a baggage guy for 2 years. By far the best and most exciting job I ever had.

aviation,3dqvex,Veritech-1,3,Sun Jul 19 04:41:49 2015 UTC,"As a frequent traveler, here's a question I have.  How do they store the bags for checked luggage (or gate checked, on the smaller flights)?  Are the bags just loaded into a compartment under the plane and free to move around?  Are they strapped in some way?  On the gate-check, how do they differentiate the checked luggage vs. the gate checked, so they can have that waiting for us at plane side?"
aviation,3dqvex,nincumpoop,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:46:55 2015 UTC,"Depends on the aircraft, some will have a belly to put gate check and valet bags, example is this CRJ 900, 2 front cargo bins and one luggage bin. But on smaller aircraft like CRJ 200 there is only a back bin. As far as strapping a bag in place there isn't much, centrifugal force and gravity does that work!"

aviation,3dteik,topgun966,4,Sun Jul 19 07:23:58 2015 UTC,Seeing as the aircraft has been in service for some 20 years now this isn't some crazy 777 design fault. It's an isolated incident and the manufacturer is responding properly my telling everyone to double check their shit.
aviation,3dteik,agha0013,3,Sun Jul 19 13:19:26 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Yet, you know this is gonna get blown WAY out of proportion. ""Coming up next, are you flying in a death trap?

aviation,3dte07,Karnman,13,Sun Jul 19 07:15:46 2015 UTC,It is a language. Like anything else it takes practice to understand and speak it. With that said sometimes it is difficult to understand them when they are busy and talking really fast
aviation,3dte07,Jester4theKing,14,Sun Jul 19 08:05:00 2015 UTC,"Say again, please."
aviation,3dte07,caskey,11,Sun Jul 19 08:48:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's worth mentioning that the ground receivers that capture the audio in most of the recordings you hear on the internet are not nearly as good as the equipment installed in aircraft and ATC facilities, so chances are that they are not an accurate depiction as to what pilots and controllers actually hear through their headsets. Also, a garbled transmission heard by one receiver is often heard loud and clear by another depending on the range between the transmitter and receiving antennas."
aviation,3dte07,BrewCityChaser,10,Sun Jul 19 12:51:52 2015 UTC,"I was on a united flight once where you could listen in to the communications as a passenger if you put your audio to channel 9.  I can't remember the specifics but basically I heard our pilot request altitude X, ATC granted altitude Y, and then our pilot confirmed altitude X.  I started sweating but then a pilot from another plane came on the line and brought the misunderstanding to their attention."
aviation,3dte07,vansoftware,5,Sun Jul 19 09:19:04 2015 UTC,"It's something you learn. To me it's like trying to listen to sport score on the radio. not a sports fan, so I don't have a base comprehension of what is being said. My brain has to actually interpret each word and relationship to get a grasp on the overall message.  My buffer fills up pretty quickly and starts losing ground.  With ATC, I know the lexicon, I can predict what's next. The brain doesn't spend much time on detailed interpretation."
aviation,3dte07,Pa24-180,2,Sun Jul 19 15:11:33 2015 UTC,"Once you have the order of what is said, that helps quite a bit.  Every call begins with who's being called followed by who's calling. After that is the important stuff.   After a while you begin to know what they're going to say before they actually say it (freq change, climb instructions, crossing clearance, etc.) so that makes it much easier.   But like others have said, it's basically a language. First you learn it and then you become conversant in it."
aviation,3dte07,VelocityDuck,2,Sun Jul 19 20:24:56 2015 UTC,"If you want to just listen and pick it up as you go, check out liveatc.net. It's free for the PC or like 2 bucks for iPhone/android version, I'd recommend learning the phonetic alphabet, so you can pull up what ever airport diagram your near to and you can listen to the ground freqs,and follow aircraft on the trip from the terminal to the runway,"
aviation,3dte07,FlyNSubaruWRX,2,Mon Jul 20 01:59:51 2015 UTC,"Even though the equipment in the aircraft is better than what you hear, most of the controllers are really quick. The best answer I could give is that the hours spent in ground school and on training flights gives you an idea of what they're going to be telling you. After enough time listening to them, certain words or numbers stand out and when they say your callsign or registration, it feels the same as someone calling your name."
aviation,3dte07,JayyBarts,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:49:51 2015 UTC,I like ATC. There a guy here who does ATC and is working on a PPL. He also thinks he's someone else. Always answers calls to the tower.

aviation,3drz1r,Boeing_enthusist,10,Sat Jul 18 22:10:29 2015 UTC,"Aside being at full thrust? It looks more dramatic than you'd normally see with your eyes because the camera is capturing more light that we can see, either through a very special lens and settings, or with a long enough exposure to intensify the light just before the aircraft started to roll.   That's just the normal intense heat of the combustion core doing it's thing."
aviation,3drz1r,agha0013,2,Sat Jul 18 22:31:30 2015 UTC,The camera is capturing light that is outside of what your eyes can see.  If you looked at engine exhaust through night vision goggles you'd see something very similar
aviation,3drz1r,twelveparsex,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:16:16 2015 UTC,"It looks like a long exposure - you can kinda tell from the ""double"" rays emanating from the strobe, and the ""light painting"" of the front area of the aircraft that's being illuminated with its taxilights.  The reason it looks like exhaust from a fighter jet is because, well, a turbojet is basically an actual jet engine with a big fan attached to it. That, and probably a bit of editing/color manipulation in post."
