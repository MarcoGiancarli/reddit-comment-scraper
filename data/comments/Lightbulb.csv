You don't shift your weight, lean, or do anything else physical - just turning your hands. It would be difficult, but it wouldn't take anywhere near as long to learn to drive it.   It would be just like inverting the camera controls for a video game."

It would be difficult, but it wouldn't take anywhere near as long to learn to drive it.   What about planes? The Boeing 737 had a glitch in the rudder control that cause the rudder movements to reverse, making left become right and vice versa. This happened extremely rarely. But every single time it did, the plane went down.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36mg8BNwBT4  I think it would be really hard to learn to drive a car that did this. You've probably been driving for so long by now that your brain has actually created its own neural pathways specifically for driving. I just started driving a few months ago, so I still need to consciously press down my foot. But my parents don't even think about their foot when they press the gas, they just decide to speed up and their foot moves automatically the same way I start to walk and my legs move automatically. Once you have those neural pathways in place for driving, they will be really hard to change, even if you know consciously that you need to turn the wheel the opposite direction, you'll still do it the other way."
Lightbulb,3dj6mk,Moonhowler22,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:07:50 2015 UTC,"Flying a plane is probably much more complicated than driving a car - but I do see your point/evidence.   Though I would be willing to bet changing just the one thing on a car, the steering, and nothing else wouldn't be terribly difficult to overcome. Just drive really slowly. Wouldn't do you much good in a chase, but sneakily driving off with someone's car might not require driving at high speed.   You would definitely default back under any kind of stressful situation or event requiring a quick reaction  I do stand by my assertion that driving a car with inverted steering is much easier than riding a bike with inverted steering, as well as flying a plane with inverted rudders."

Lightbulb,3detrh,oodie1127,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:32:22 2015 UTC,"You may be right, but I'm pretty sure that's largely because people's idea of sitting ""upright"" isn't quite right. The two most important things are in the run age and the tailbone. Firstly, you need to make sure your tailbone is going out when sitting. Essentially you want to push it behind you and up. Then, when you sit up straight, imagine two hands running down you, one from your neck to groin, the other from the back of your neck to your tailbone. A lot of people jut out the bottom of their ribcage, creating an even more unnatural curve in the spine. Imagining the two hands flattening you out tends to push the spine back and flatten it out properly. Mixed with your tailbone being pushed out, you should have a pretty nice and straight back. However, it takes a lot of time, practice, and effort.   Source: go to an acting conservatory and they spent a full year teaching us how to sit upright."

Lightbulb,3ddbg6,scubadger,2,Wed Jul 15 15:56:34 2015 UTC,"Assume, just for the sake of argument, that I know as much about economics as warthogs know about geometry.

Lightbulb,3ddbg6,sionnach,2,Wed Jul 15 16:05:57 2015 UTC,"I'll be gentle :-)  From your point of view, you owed me $20. So you're down $20. But then I owed you $5, so in reality you're only down $15. Our mutual friend owes you $10, so good news - in reality you only owe $5 in total.  From our mutual friends point of view, he's owed $10 from me. Happy days - he's in the money. Except he's not, because he owes $10 to you. So in reality, he's neither up nor down. His net position is $0.  Me, I'm owed $20 by you. I'm rich! Except I owe you $5, so with $15 I'm still doing well. Except that I owe our mutual friend $10 so now I only really actually have $5 to my name. Still, better than nothing.   Now, since you owe me $5, and our mutual friend is out of the game you just pay me the $5 and all debts are paid off.   Nobody is any better or worse off because of this, but we don't have to pass so much cash around to settle debts. Compression can help cash-flow, but it won't reduce the actual amount owed."
Lightbulb,3ddbg6,sionnach,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:13:28 2015 UTC,"Another problem with debt is the interest.  But if I'm paying interest on $10 of debt and I'm collecting interest on $10 of debt then (if the interest rates are roughly the same) the cash flows cancel out.  We can eliminate the time we take processing those transactions, but it doesn't make you any better off on a net basis.  Also these situations are usually encountered in corporations which is not where the debt overhang really causes problems.  Eliminating debt cycles does nothing for the person with $100,000 in student loans who don't hold anyone else's debt for themselves."

If your screen is broken, it has nothing to do with the touch sensor part. If the touch sensor part is broken, it'll be broken for either the entire screen altogether or for major parts of the screen. You can't track a sliver that's the crack in your screen.  But I guess you can just draw it using a finger painting kinda feature.  Thing is, any abstract wallpaper would work for this. It just has to be not white-ish and not plain-ish.   Plus, Idk how much time you spend staring at the wallpaper, but I have my home screen filled with widgets and apps which come over the background anyway and will highlight the crack somewhat. Anyways, I'm mostly on my home screen for like half a second before switching to another app.   TLDR: This isn't worth making since there an easy solution is just googling for an absract wallpaper or something you like and the market is pretty much non existent.  Now I'll tell you something that'll make you dislike me. People who don't really bother getting their screen fixed will most likely not pay for the app (or IAP). I'm not saying that's the true in all cases, neither is it the only reason not to make the app, but it's definitely a contributing factor. As a developer I have to think about this. Do I want to make an app in which users are less likely (even lesser than they already are) to pay up? I would, if I didn't have to put food on the table."
