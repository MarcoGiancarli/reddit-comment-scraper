windowshots,2yg0n1,HatManToTheRescue,1 point,Tue Mar 10 23:11:01 2015 UTC,How long are the winters? And how much snow do you get/how cold are the winters? I lived in New York my whole life so I got used to winters with lake effect snow and temperatures that hover around 0
windowshots,2yg0n1,HatManToTheRescue,1 point,Tue Mar 10 23:13:37 2015 UTC,"Hmm well it differs between years I guess. This winter has been quite long with lots of snow. But I'd say winter is at least from November to March. The temperature in winter is maybe somewhere from 10°C to -10°C, but it's windy here as I said so that makes it a lot colder. Usually it snows more in the countryside, but in the capital area it tends to be wetter and windier."
