Advice,3e4dmn,JupiterK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:59:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think they should lay down even more tough love than that. Despite the amount of rent that is paid (which IMO should be more than 100, if he is 28) he should have to do his part of the household chores, or not live there. And fuck making him pay less for doing chores, that's not being an adult. Being an adult means you have to do your shit, even if you are paying rent. None of the adults I know have to pay less rent to their landlords because they do their dishes, or take out the trash.  This would really take a lot of commitment on their part, because obviously if they don't follow through with any of their tough love, he's just going to keep doing it (probably).  If they are not willing to set more ground rules and follow through, there is close to nothing you can do, though."

But about 3 weeks ago I had an MS Hug that lasted almost 2 hours which was the longest it's endured since I was a kid. Another thing that's really been bothering me lately is Sleep Apnea. I've heard that MS can cause it, but I think I have it regardless. I'm pretty sure of this because it wasn't me that came up with this theory. I recently started sleeping in the same bed with someone regularly for the first time in my life and she said that I sounded like I was choking in my sleep and that I probably have apnea. This makes a TON of sense to me because I've always had trouble staying awake during the day regardless of how much sleep and get and terrible insomnia prior to discovering melatonin.  Then there's the other less significant things like frequent urination, delayed orgasm, fatigue, nystagmus, and vertigo.  The last thing, and the one that's been really bothering me is impaired thinking. It's so hard to realize when your cognitive processes aren't how they ought to be.

As for the third world country, that's nothing. You have access to the internet which means you have access to opportunities. Being born poor isn't your fault, but that doesn't mean you can't change that for your family or for your kids.   Also, if you're unhappy about your appearance, use that as motivation and go running or join a fitness group (which would also help your social anxiety).   Good luck, my friend."

You can tell your friend you worked for this money and if he thinks it's unfair that you have more to spend, tell him to work for his own money. Maybe even give him some tips about what would be a good job for him.   It is NOT unreasonable or rude of you to stop paying for him!  If that solves the problem, great! If he causes a scene or tries to guilt you, don't give in, no matter how hard that might be. In this case it may be helpful for you to think about whether he values you for your friendship, or because he gets free stuff off of you. Not a very nice person to have in your life then.  Of course, this doesn't mean you should NEVER treat him to something again, you're friends after all. But it's not supposed to be completely one-sided, and as long as it's your money, you decide where it goes, and why. If he doesn't respect that, he probably doesn't see really you as a friend, but more as a wallet."

This should have been the end of your relationship. Not healthy. Not healthy at all. I kept on reading and it got worse and worse.   What she is doing equates to emotional blackmail. It has got to the point where you blame yourself for her actions. That is not correct. She is a grown adult who is responsible for her actions. She gained 50 ponds. She is an unmotivated slob who is overly attached to you.   100% honesty.   There is no easy way to do this. She is a ticking time bomb of mental instability that is going to explode when you leave. You have to leave. Please stop having sex with her. If she even gets the slightest hint that you are going to leave she could trap you with a pregnancy."
Advice,3e3ngo,notevenapro,3,Tue Jul 21 18:39:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response.   I agree that it's not healthy, and is the equivalent of emotional blackmail. I've felt this way for a while, especially during the times I've told her I want her to leave and she told me she's staying regardless, and I have no choice but to try to work things out.   As far as the sex goes, strangely enough, we honestly haven't had sex in quite a while, I guess because there's just no passion left. We never kiss unless it's a peck-on-the-lips for goodbye, and we don't have sex because I guess it's just not something either of us wants. Even if I try to initiate intimate contact, she immediately deflects with a simple, forceful ""no"". Which hurts my ego even more, because I'm already not attracted to her because of her weight, but for her to refuse me even still is just an awful feeling.  I know it sounds like I'm giving a million reasons to leave everyone scratching their head saying ""Why is he even still asking for help, why not just end things and move on"" but I promise it's not that easy to just tell someone who you share a home, an income, and multiple pets with ""Hey, get out""."
Advice,3e3ngo,ALittleBirdyToldMe25,2,Tue Jul 21 19:34:46 2015 UTC,I think the only reason it seems like you're coming up with so many reasons to leave her is because you have SO many reasons to leave her but you still care about her it's just not a forever type of deal especially since things have gone so sour lately.  Is there any way you could move out in December when your lease ends? That way she doesn't have an option? Maybe start looking for a new place and when you find one tell her either she leaves or you leave (to your new place).   Also just be prepared for the fire works because she's going to explode when you drop the bomb on her.   Is there anything else you wanted to know specifically? I'm just confused what you're looking for. No one here is going to tell you to stay when she clearly isn't treating you right and you've been straight with her from the beginning.

That way when you break the news and she throws a tantrum you have less items for her to break or trash. Also have a friend around just incase she becomes physical again. That way you have a witness incase things get really out of hand and you think you might need help. Since she has a history of getting physical with you and throwing things having a witness will help you to file a police report if it unfortunately gets to that point."
Advice,3e3ngo,emesghali,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:41:11 2015 UTC,"You can love someone, care for someone deeply, but not be IN LOVE with them.  Frankly, she sounds too immature at this stage to get married (as notevenapro mentioned, the hysterics are a sign of immaturity). She needs to grow up and understand that she should live life for herself and not for someone else or for a goal (goal = getting married). You sound mature enough to realize this.  My only concern is that you need to have a plan to move out (or have her move out). I'll be honest here - I'm in the same position, getting a divorce from my STBX (one of the reasons is because I am the sole reason for his existence, and I can't live like that). We have pets too. It's hard. But you need a plan before you give the break-up talk with your GF. Do it sooner than later - believe me, I know how hard it is. I hate to say this, but if you move out, perhaps you can arrange to remove the stuff from your apartment while she's working? (I hope she's working.)  I will say one thing - if you had the pets before she moved in with you, then the pets belong to you. Otherwise, you might consider splitting the pets up.  Good luck."

The moment you knew this was going to go no where you had a responsibility to end it for her own good, and yours. Yes, she will suffer.

You absolutely do not want her to get pregnant because you'll be stuck with her in your life for the next 20 years.   Start saving money. Not sure how your bank accounts are arranged, but if you have a joint checking account, then you need to get one of your own at a different bank, and get a payroll deduction so that money gets diverted from each paycheck into that account.   Contact the National Domestic Violence Center at 1-800-799-7233 or online at www.thehotline.org. Here's the link to their information about leaving a relationship safely.

So few people learn how to manage their money, they go through their entire lives deeply in debt and constantly stressed about how they're going to pay bills. Having the ability to create and stick to a budget is such a wonderful boon, even if you can't see it now this is probably the greatest gift your parents could give you.   They clearly care about you a lot, they want you to save money so that you don't have to live that way, so that you can create opportunities for yourself without being stressed out by debt. Plus, it's not like they're taking the money from you, putting it in a savings account so that you'll have it later and to teach you how to delay pleasure.  If you want them to see you as a responsible person, then you need to show them that you know how to manage your money in the best way. If you'd like help in that regard, let me know and I can shoot some ideas your way. In the end, the best solution for them is for you to show that you are responsible with your money, and the best solution for you is to do the same so that they will trust you and give you back your card.

He always left his phone laying out and I trusted him so much because ""my man would never do that to me."" Me and him went to get pizzas and he left his phone at home and my sister had to be a snoop and told me before we left and I said you won't find nothing on him and boy did she find stuff on him.

Personally, I made a mistake of thinking that I could have a day job which is non-creative and do creative stuff in my spare time. I was wrong. That just doesn't work this way.

I would honestly find someone who has done it, and ask them to have lunch and ask them what they love, what they hate, and if they could change anything, what it would be. That is a really good way to find out how things actually are.   You aren't too old to do whatever you want. However, don't rule out other professions within that field - there are about a million ways to make a lot of money. Consider different specialties, consider different disciplines, and consider the investment and time to pay off. Radiologists make a ton, physicians assistants make a ton, endodontists make a ton, speech therapists do incredibly well - the possibilities are fantastic.  The best two pieces I have ever gotten are this - one, 'nobody ever said you won't swim through a river of shit', and two, 'if you don't decide, you're deciding'."
Advice,3e30ke,ladybrainhumanperson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:49:13 2015 UTC,"I'm 30-years-old, have a post-graduate degree, grew up poor, am happily married, and have a similar way of looking at life.  Putting all of that in context, I'm looking at your situation as if I'm walking in your shoes.  Here's what I think:  1) Money is the #1 priority.  Unfortunately you cannot escape your student loans by declaring bankruptcy.  Your undergrad debt will follow you until the day you die and it can make your life miserable if you don't figure out a way to make regular payments that go beyond just paying interest.  $100K is a ton of money and the interest + principal just won't get paid down unless you begin a career that has the potential of being lucrative.    You should focus on beginning a career that will pay at least $40K at entry level that will eventually allow you to get out from under your debt and allow you to save money for future endeavors.  Having grown up in poverty, you have seen how being poor can destroy ambition and happiness.  Do everything you can to make sure you don't end up like that again.  Unfortunately this means that taking a break to join the Peace Corps or volunteer is not in your near future unless it's during your vacation time from work or until you have paid off the majority of your student loans.  2) Go to medical school!  You can start by being a nurse and then get a specialty to be a GP, specialist, surgeon, etc. in the future once you have more of a stable income.  You will be able to help people, make good money, be able to move anywhere in the world, and there's always upward advancement.  If you don't want to stop doing clinical work in 10 years, don't!  Even if you want to remain an RN or a specialist for the rest of your life, that's fine.  You'll be doing something that makes you happy that gives you money to pay down your debt plus take longer vacations.  Even if you don't like doing clinical, there are a million and one corporate jobs in healthcare that could make you happier--but you won't know what you like until you experience it.  Speak to your local university that offers an accelerated BSN program and ask about prerequisites and scholarships/grants.  School starts in late August/September and you want to get on the ball ASAP if you decide to go the medical route (which does sound good.)  If it's too late to enroll in a program, you can have an advisor sign you into 1 or 2 classes as a non-degree student, and then those credits can be transferred once you apply for the program and get accepted.  (This is what I did with my MBA and it went well.)  You should also call the companies who issued your student loans and find out if they can be put on hold until another degree is completed.  3) If you decide to go to medical school, spend your free time doing as much research as possible on scholarships and grants.  You want to avoid adding on to your already huge pile of debt.  If you don't want to go to medical school because you want more freedom in your schedule, begin looking immediately into jobs to become a realtor (especially if you live within an hour and a half of a city that's booming), a financial advisor (just need to get certifications then you're on your own to build a client base--and you'd get to give advice!), or a consultant (usually in the tech field, but there are other kinds.)  All of these positions pay well and will allow you to take off months at a time to travel or volunteer, but they are not stable if you take too much time off and clients/customers begin seeing someone else.  You say you don't like the idea of everything being too planned out, but you need to make plans immediately about the kind of job you want for a happy life. You don't want to end up taking a $10-15/hour job just to pay the minimal balance on your student loans and then get stuck doing that job forever.  4) Put marriage on the back burner.  Once your life is stable and you have a job you enjoy that's allowing you to pay your bills without worrying about living paycheck-to-paycheck, your love life will fall into place.  You may meet a doctor/technician at work and fall in love or meet someone while volunteering once your new schooling or training is complete, but over the next year or 2 you're going to be so busy building a lifelong career that you won't have the time to invest in a new relationship.  Don't sweat it.  It's totally common to meet someone in your late 20s and put off kids until you're in your 30s (or choose not to have kids at all.)  5) Think about traveling once your new degree is complete or once you've finished the tests/certifications for a new career.  Just because you have a stable job doesn't mean you can't see the world.  I traveled around the country and around Europe during my vacations away from my first 9-5 job, and I saved up a bunch of money to keep traveling if/when I choose to take a break between jobs.  It's possible, you just have to plan for it.  You can't fly by the seat of your pants; your budget needs to be meticulous.  It's not ""fun"" to think about what you're going to be doing years in the future and to watch every dollar you're spending, but it will pay off.  Good luck with whatever choice you make!  Having a planned out route can feel scary, but it's for the best and it will allow you to have the life you've always dreamed of.  :)"

Advice,3e1k8t,twistedfishhook,4,Tue Jul 21 17:21:30 2015 UTC,"It's fair enough that you're confused. I'm going to agree with everyone else: these are things you should talk to her about :)  A tip though: these are all just relative concepts to different people. I'm pretty straight - probably about as flexible as you are - and I sometimes dress a little tomboyish. It's just a style preference, not really a sign of a particular sexual bent. Discussing your sexual orientation is more common in queer circles, because, well, they're queer. At first, it's a topic because you're trying to figure it out, and then it's a topic because you do end up being a little defined by it. Not all queer people do, but that's the reason that some do.   Do chat to her though."
Advice,3e1k8t,Kairos27,2,Tue Jul 21 11:10:05 2015 UTC,"Have to agree with /u/truth_artist.  Sounds like your gf is struggling with her identity.  She doesn't know how she wants to approach her own sexuality and she doesn't know how she wants to present herself to the world.    The constant questioning of other people's sexuality is not normal and suggests that she's constantly thinking about sexuality in relation to herself.  She may be struggling with whether she is actually homosexual or whether she is bisexual and possibly whether she wants to act on either one or stay in a monogamous relationship with you.  The only thing it sounds like she has figured out is that she isn't transgender because she accepts she is a woman through and through.   Since this will be the first time you're living close to each other, you should give her space to keep thinking about her sexuality/appearance.  The decisions she makes over the coming months may shape the way she thinks for many years--especially if her LGBT friends remain in her life.  You can continue to try talking to her about her feelings on queer life, but it probably won't get you anywhere because it sounds like she doesn't know herself right now.  Just love her, listen to her, and be compassionate if/when she decides that she wants to go a different route in life."

Just because she's interested in men and women doesn't mean she wants threesomes with you, or anyone, or at all. Being bi doesn't mean you fuck everybody, being bi and being gay still means you select partners based on whatever criteria you have.  I think that sort of thinking is what's leading to some of your confusion. She's with you because she likes you, but is open to other people. Ie, shell have sex with a wife variety of people, but she chooses you.  Regardless, ask her questions. Pick her brain. She'll tell you."

Sex: The gametes produced by an organism determine its sex: males produce male gametes (spermatozoa, or sperm, in animals; pollen in plants) while females produce female gametes (ova, or egg cells); individual organisms which produce both male and female gametes are termed hermaphroditic.

If you imagine the same intense focus and obsession with someone who defines themselves in their role as a new parent, you may see the similarity.  It's not that gender identity, sexual orientation, or being a parent are negative things -- certainly not.  But the thing is that identifying fully with a gender role or any other form really only shows that specific part of our being.  We are all much more than any role or any identity we hitch ourselves to.  When we don't really know ourselves it is easy to fall into the habit of picking one aspect of our selves that is unique, talented, novel... and we overemphasize that.  It's really about not knowing or not being comfortable with the other 95% of the things that we are.  Ultimately, this is a form of ego-identity.  I suggest listening to some Eckhart Tolle.  He talks about what it is to ""be"" and the many ways that we try to fool ourselves by immersing ourselves in the ""I am a _____"" statements."

If you take this advice, you almost certainly WILL be arrested for aggravated assault; and then there's always the off chance that you'll piss someone off enough to come back armed. Here's some legitimate advice:  Record them when they enter your property and you inform them that they're trespassing, report it so that it's on file that they've been informed. Next time, with more video evidence, you have enough proof that they might actually charge them if you decide to make a case out of it.

I'd imagine this would vary depending on where you live but it's genuinely really stupid to outright refute this when you have no idea where this situation has occurred.

If you do assault someone, ""self defense"" is not an automatic ""oh, never mind then"" from the police. It is a defense to the charges, which you will have to use, in court, when defending yourself against criminal charges.

OP has no reason to believe that his neighbor is a danger to him, only a nuisance, in a court of law simply claiming that you believe a person to be dangerous isn't enough to hold up to the scrutiny you're going to face. In Australia, while it is legal to forcefully remove someone from your land if they are trespassing, you absolutely MUST NOT use more force than is reasonably necessary otherwise your use of force constitutes assault and you are liable for any damages the trespasser suffers as a result.

In the case of a home invader there's a clear threat that can be reasonably assumed, in both Australia and the United States, and both allow any means necessary up to and including deadly force with the stipulation that you can prove you had a genuine belief that it was necessary to do so to protect yourself or your family which isn't and shouldn't be difficult to prove; but the application of this ends at your front door, with the exception of self-defense."

I'm not down voting this comment, no one else likely will either so don't worry about that.   I'm familiar with most state statutes within the United States, I have to be as I carry a handgun on my person every single day.  My only argument is that it's pretty much universally illegal in first world countries to ""beat the shit out of"" your neighbor solely for trespassing. They have to actually present a threat first such as taking a swing at you or brandishing a weapon, in which case counter-aggression would usually fall under self-defense and, at least in the US, only then would stand your ground laws apply.  I'd say it's fairly safe to assume that OP is likely in a first world country, wouldn't you?   it's genuinely really stupid to outright refute [the legality of attacking an intruder] ...when you have no idea where this situation has occurred   It's genuinely really stupid to outright refute the illegality of attacking a trespasser [you keep saying intruder, this isn't someone breaking into OP's house, it's someone crossing a property line] when you have no idea where the situation occurred; the same argument can be made on both sides but one errs towards the side of caution.   Now I have to go to bed and resent having to have written all that knowing I will still get downvoted. But I win. And all the downvotes in the world can't take that away from me.   I don't know about that, every single source you provided linked directly to stand your ground statutes or justifiable force for various states. Stand your ground laws mean that a person may use deadly force in self-defense without the duty to retreat when faced with a reasonable perceived threat. A trespasser typically doesn't fall into this category as they're not inherently seen as at threat, a home-invader would be seen as a threat. Justifiable use of force generally just outlines when it's appropriate to use force and what is authorized. In the United States, the general rule is that you may use reasonable force to stop a threat to yourself or others; this generally only allows for deadly force when it's reasonable to believe that it's necessary to prevent immediate and severe bodily harm to yourself or others. Neither of these statutes applies unless acting in self defense, neither gives you the ability to instigate a hostile situation."

Also my staple diet started out as spaghetti, then I branched out to other things. Take this time to experiment with what you can cook because there is nobody around to judge or complain about you using their ingredients.

Two things really stand out to me:   He has been prescribed ""psych meds"" but he is not taking them.  You, your brother or your mother should call his Doctor immediately and let them know that this is so.  When describing your father's current behavior be mindful that any Doctor is a mandatory reporter and if you tell him or her of any abusive behavior, he or she will be legally obligated to call the authorities. Definitely go to law school.  Hopefully you can get your father's blessing and support, but do try to break as many of those financial chains as you can.  You can live in many parts of Massachusetts without a car, so leave the car at home - one chain broken.     Get some advice from a professional.  I'm guessing your father will not agree to family therapy, but you can call the National Domestic Violence hotline and get professional, sound advice.  You may also be able to go for therapy under your health insurance.  Call the health insurance company and ask BUT be aware that a copy of a bill may go to your father - it would be worth asking the health insurance company about that, too.  I'm sorry this is the life you and your family are living right now.  It gets better, trust me."
Advice,3e3pvw,Colonel_K_The_Great,2,Tue Jul 21 18:47:35 2015 UTC,"I still smoke, but I've quit for long periods of time before. The first time I quit was the only time it was a real struggle. That time I had a calendar that I would mark off every day (I was going for a month sober). Just being able to look at my red Xs on the calendar was a big help.  You're not physically addicted, so it's not like you'll go through detox or anything. And honestly, it's only the first few days that are rough, because you're used to smoking at certain times. It's the habit you have to break.  Think up a reward for yourself at the end of a number of days or weeks sober. Then keep track of time as I said above.  Once you've been clean for a few days, it won't even matter. I promise you won't miss it nearly as badly as you think you will. You'll even be able to hang out with people while they smoke and, since the addiction is not physical, it won't bother you. You may even find that you don't like weed very much after you've been off it for a while.  Sobriety is a trip as well. I mean it, it's a total trip. A whole different high. It's a lot of fun, really. You'll be all energized and alert, and you'll be amazed how quickly time flows when you're not high and how bright and distinct everything looks. You'll be so distracted by the experience of sobriety that you won't even feel like you're missing something."
Advice,3e3pvw,TheLaramieReject,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:34:53 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for taking the time to write this reply. Just hearing from people who have gone through the same thing is a huge boost.
Advice,3e3pvw,futtbucked69,2,Tue Jul 21 23:04:21 2015 UTC,"I started smoking week in Sophomore year of high school. By Jr. Year, I was smoking $30-$40 worth of weed a day, stealing money from my moms purse to pay for it. Halfway through senior year, I knew something had to change. I had tried to quit before many times, but I knew I was graduating soon and needed to get my shit together.  I'm going to tell you things you're probably not going to want to hear. But this is how I was able to do it, and it only makes it harder on yourself if you don't do this.   Cut connections with your friends who just want to hang out and smoke weed. Just stop hanging out with them. They may be cool people, but they are poisonous to your future.   Find sober people to hang out with. It will seem boring, but you need to get used to having fun sober again.   Find something that motivates you to get sober, and follow it religiously. For me, it was the prospect of joining the military. It is the major force of me getting sober and starting to work out. I knew I couldn't be smoking weed all day every day and joi the airforce. Just like you probably can't go through your last school year high on weed all the time.   Start working out. A lot. Take it slow at first, to not burn yourself out, but start getting into it heavily. Check our /r/fitness, find your niche, and follow it. For me it was weightlifting. I never thought I would be into barbell training, but my god I loved it. It seriously does become an addiction after a while. Try to switch your addiction to something healthy like working out.   The first few days / week will be terrible. But it gets exponentially better after that. When going sober for the first few days, do everything in your power to stay sober. Remember that it will get easier and easier. You will find yourself not even thinking about weed as much, your mind will be much clearer, and honestly, after the withdrawals, its like a different kind of high.   Been sober 2 years now. Hands down the best decision I ever made, was getting sober from weed. I could not be where I am now if I had kept smoking."
Advice,3e3nt2,bravadough,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:33:05 2015 UTC,"I hear where you're coming from.  I didn't have many friends as a kid and other children always made fun of my acne (starting at age 10!) and clothing.  I was a tomboy who grew up poor and people made jokes about my gender and made disgusting incest comments.  By the time I joined the workforce I had other women spreading false rumors about me and literally harassing me.  It wasn't easy to do, but focusing on what your therapist said is the only thing that will help you get through this.  There will always be people that are innately jerks.  These people are narcissists and see most people as ""beneath them"" or are so intimidated by certain people that they try to bring them down with low blows.  They don't care about your feelings; they only care about being better than you, better than colleagues, and even better than family members.  Nothing you can do or say will change the way they think or the way they act.  You have to realize that when these terrible people say or do terrible things, it doesn't reflect on you at all.  It reflects on them and makes them look bad--not you.  Those rumors that are spread are untrue and they are the plague of the narcissistic people who lack empathy.  Even though they are directed at you, you have to consciously tell yourself ""that's not about me, that's just about Jane being a bitch!""  Every time you start to ruminate on one of those rumors or someone being a jerk to you, make a mental note of saying ""That's not about me"" and then seriously think about whoever hurt you being such a bitch.  Think about how even if they have a spouse, their spouse hates who they are (or who they've become.)  If they're single, think about how no decent person would ever put up with their bullshit.  Think about how when they get sick and lose their job, no one is going to be there to support them because they don't support anyone else in a healthy manner.  If they have other shitty friends who help gossip and spread rumors, know that they don't have each other's backs and would throw each other under the bus if they could.    Thinking about how I treat people with respect and have people who love me always pulls me out of the hole of ruminating on people who did me wrong.  Think about your spouse or family members or friends who love you unconditionally and would never treat you the way that some other people have treated you...then think ""screw Jane.  She'll never have the love that I have unless she does some soul searching and changes.""  Comparing my moral compass to people that clearly lack one is an immediate mood booster once I'm able to overcome the initial shock and upset of being hurt.  Good luck getting through this.  It takes years of mentally telling yourself that you don't deserve to be treated poorly and that the things people say/do are wrong, but eventually you will be able to brush it off.  It doesn't just happen, you always have to tell yourself that those words aren't really about you."

Go to work then come home and relax. As depressing as it sounds, this is life for most adults, work a day time job and the only free time is at night and weekends. I work 9 hours a day, go to the gym for 1-2 hours, and still game on my PC for 3-4 hours a night. That's what my grind taught me, how to manage my time.

I had to tell him that there was limited space at my sister's and that there wasn't enough room (which is true). Plus I don't think my sister would be comfortable having a strange man staying at her apartment. I'm annoyed that my friend is putting me in this awkward position of having to seem like a bitch to this guy by telling him no… And now I don't know how to tell them that I don't even want him to join… I feel like such a jerk about it.   She does this sort of thing often, pushing me to do things or buy things I don't want. Example, at the farmer's market, about to buy some rosemary bread, and she says, ""Oh, you should buy this olive bread instead!"" It happens. Every. Single. Day. And I'm terrible at saying no, so I usually end up going through with her advice. She's a really nice and generous person, but I don't think she realizes how often she pushes people into doing things that she wants to do."
Advice,3e3clp,skinisblackmetallic,2,Tue Jul 21 17:42:19 2015 UTC,"You certainly shouldn't feel like a jerk. It's a simple solution as well.

I don't want to seem like a jerk, and I don't want to hurt your friend's feelings, but I'm upset that you invited him without asking me.  And now because I'm pretty sure my sister will not be happy about constantly having to pick this random guy up, you want me to take on the extra expense of renting a car.  This is not working for me.""  Ed. to add:  Don't worry too much about hurting her feelings. She's been incredibly thoughtless, both as a friend and a guest, and she needs a wake-up call pronto."

If you don't come off too strong, which I doubt you will seeing how you explained your perspective, there should be no problem.

Advice,3e3c76,Yowhattup,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:51:30 2015 UTC,"I want to see you succeed, however it seems like you have not tapped into your full potential and have some things to work on. Please don't take this the wrong way, I understand you are explaining your pov, and I just want to point out my observations.  I understand you feel you came from a disadvantaged home. I see alot of excuses of why you CAN'T. Alot of dreams of moving out, away, and to do something you enjoy doing. It is good to have ambition, but it is just a dream until you start taking action. People with no arms are still able to play the piano, paint, and do extraordinary things. We often hear of stories of homeless and underprivileged high school kids earning full scholarships to all the Ivy League schools. That is how I put things in perspective, because if you want it bad enough, you can and will get it done because there is no other option.  You need to focus your time and energy on HOW you will get to where you need. You realize you need money to move. If you want out really bad, and put forth the effort you will find a way. There are plenty of ways to make money but they all take time and effort. Even pan handling on the streets is more productive than sulking around.  I'm not saying you have made no effort to follow the path you want, but from your post I do not think you are spending nearly the time you should be to make your dreams a reality.  My parents paid for college, I went for a year and didn't go to oneclass. After I failed out all that they provided me was a room and food. I grinded a full time job and over 18 credits a semester commuting 3-4 hours a day to get my bachelors. Earning money and having to pay for college and expenses teaches you the value of money. I packed up my car the week after I graduated and moved 650 miles away to start my career with ~$3000 and a job offer.   TLDR: If you want it you will get it, but you will get no where if you don't dedicate yourself to it. You get the cards in life you are dealt with. If you have some shitty cards it just means you have to work harder and longer, but you have the opportunity to get out. Success isn't for the weak.  Good luck to you and feel free to reach out if you need someone to talk to."

P.S. The way I did money online was through a Facebook security bug report, some online investments (with that prior earning) and a lot of hard earned money with some post-writing thing that paid me little to nothing in exchange of lot of hours and energy invested...

Advice,3e31xg,scooley01,3,Tue Jul 21 16:03:46 2015 UTC,"Talking about finances sooner rather than later is a good idea.  I think one of the best tips I've heard is to keep your savings separate but to contribute a percentage of your salary (rather than an equal dollar amount) into a shared account where you can pay bills such as rent, electric, etc.  The reason a percentage is often a good idea is that 1) if you make more, you may push the lower-earning spouse toward a more expensive housing option, more expensive TV options, etc and it is unfair to pay more for something not really in your budget and 2) earning more still allows you to save more/spend more on your hobbies.  In general, keeping finances separate as much as possible is the best way to avoid resentment."

Advice,3e31xg,eightcharm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:43:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, for marriage as well.  Combining finances fully at any point is a horrible, horrible idea.  It leads to a lot of judgement about minor purchases because anything your spouse buys represents money you could have used for something you want.  It's always recommended that you keep your finances in your own account with the exception of a small amount monthly into a shared account that is used to pay bills and nothing else.  This method keeps the relationship healthy and cooperative and is also important for protecting your finances.  No matter how much you trust your spouse, women who have had their husbands gamble away all of their money because it was in a shared account also trusted their husbands that much as well."
Advice,3e31xg,CleverNameAndNumbers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:56:47 2015 UTC,"My bits of advice  Never have a joint anything. No joint bank accounts, loans, etc. If you two trust eachother and it sounds like you do then it's easier to seperate your finances. For example, if for whatever reason one of you does something to wreck your credit the other person won't be affected and can continue to give both people the benefits of good credit, wheras if you had mixed everything both people would be screwed regardless of who caused it. Also if you do go for a house mortgages are usually given out on the basis of who has the lower rating between the two. If you keep things seperate the one with the better deal can get the loan. Even if this is the case it doesn't stop both people from contributing. As for joint accounts it's not wrong to have a ""my money, your money"" thing, it's good if anything since it keeps both people accountable. You will never have to worry about the other spending more than their fair share from the joint account.   Pay your own bills and expenses. Don't ask or rely on one another to cover eachothers expenses. If you incur the expense, whether it's necessary or not, it's not your partner's responsibility, and a lot of fighting over money happens from this angle. There are obvious exceptions like ""my car broke"" or ""my arm broke"", but phone bills and shopping costs should be kept to the person who incurred them.   Split the expense according to the percent of income. Even if one of you has some other expense like a loan to repay (see above) it should be even on the line. Once again, it wasn't your partner who forced you into debt, it's not fair to make them pay. Don't try to seek deductions and excuses, you're a couple, not tax lawyers.  When it comes to taking eachother out don't ask to be taken to somewhere expensive. If you go somewhere expensive then you should split the cost. If you try to keep count of who pays when it will turn sour even if you both spend the same overall. For the small cheap things take turns paying. It will be fun and it will feel like you are giving eachother these small gifts and rewards.  The way to avoid fighting over money is to just be fair about it. Don't ask from the other person if you can avoid it and don't make them responsible for your financial obligations."

Hitting an animal is not good for creating a trusting relationship and fixing behaviour problems.  But honestly, I wouldn't take advice from a (regular) weed smoker seriously about basically anything and I'm not surprised your sister won't.  When I started university, I didn't care one way or the other about weed/smokers.  But since graduating, I've seen people develop schizophrenia after smoking too much and I've seen the lack of motivation that comes with smoking slowly and subtly kill a lot of people's chances at success.  Smoking weed 2-3x/month?  Whatever.  Any more often than that?  It's bad for you in ways most people just don't realize.  Just like drinking alcohol, smoking weed must be done in moderation to enjoy while avoiding serious negative consequences.   You say you're doing 'good' in school... What does 'good' mean to you?  (Also, it would be correct to say you're doing 'well' in school, not 'good', so I'm a bit doubtful here).  As I mentioned, smoking regularly really kills motivation and you could be doing better without the weed even if you think you're doing acceptably well now.  Bonus fun fact: weed smokers generally score more poorly than non-weed smokers on IQ tests.  But previous weed smokers who reduce smoking or quit altogether score better on IQ tests than people who have never smoked at all."

Also in regards to all stoners being unproductive, this isn't really a valid statement. For example their are dozens of examples of successful stoners.

Advice,3e2z4x,mattempirelic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:08:06 2015 UTC,"It's a valid statement to say that the same person smoking is less successful than they would be not smoking because of the neurochemical response to weed, not that a person can't be successful while smoking.  It's still a handicap.  What I'm saying is, you'll have to get used to not being trusted on relied on if you smoke regularly because that is how people often respond.  You're absolutely right, and you could try to show your sister some information on the subject.  If you can find a scientific journal article and summarize it for her that would be the most persuasive.  You're not impressing me at all with that 3.1 GPA or not smoking before 5pm.  You're cutting off a lot of opportunities by not maintaining a GPA above 3.5.  I've heard it all before from the same people who think eating themselves into obesity is ok as long as their blood pressure is fine, from people who think drinking every day is ok as long as they haven't been fired yet, from people who think not wearing a seatbelt in the car is fine because the last time they got into a car crash it was a minor one (seriously, these are all things people have actually said to me).

I understand how smoking weed can impairs someone for life if they start smoking in their teens while the brain has been developing, but I'm unaware of any studies where they say that it impairs/handicaps adults.

Weed (THC) mimics components in your brain that 'balance' circuits, and when you get high regularly the brain tries to compensate which affects processing while you are not high.  Your brain doesn't stop changing after adolescence; the only reason people are able to learn anything through life is because the brain continuously remodels itself."

You could even go for shared custody if you really want to be a daddy - you'll probably need a lawyer to sort this out.   Don't believe her if she says no child support. She might have the best of intentions, but if something bad happens to her a few years down the line, like a job loss, or needing to claim welfare, she may be forced to sue you for child support, whether she wants to or not.   The child support payments need to be official, or else they don't count, and she can sue you anyway. A few hundred here and there won't cut it.   Remember to get a paternity test.

Nobody likes being interrupted, not only is it rude but the interrupted person feels like their opinion is unvalued and not important to the discussion.  I've been at meetings and stuff where it's just been me and a group of guys and I've not even gotten a word thing. It's very distressing and I just don't see the point in being there.

So, tell me, what's wrong with that? Its your fucking case so grow the fuck up, sorry for being rude but what the fuck, why be so complex about something so simple? Don't feel bad for saying no, no is no. Its better to say no than give false hopes, you know? Grow up with the sexist thing, seriously. And men will always try to conquer, its in our nature. Don't blame a guy for trying, its simply part of who we are... Some are more shy, others are not. I just sincerely hope from the bottom of my heart that when you indeed like someone he doesn't end to be a jackass who just wants to use you, but life's an experiment in the end so we live and learn, like I have.    Edit3: The thing your friend says about you hanging out with him might be him iluded that he sees that you like him. Maybe you without knowing gave him signs or whatever. Or its just him fighting for you, trying to conquer you. Its sweet of him to try if he's trying it from the heart, you know?    Edit4: Friend-zoning means the person will never engage in a romantic perspective with you. You see him as a friend, thus he is in the friendzone, its just a new term people invented for it. If you still want his friendship just tell him that and ask him if he will feel bad for still being just that. Most of all, try to understand if he needs to walk away a bit. Everything is telling you how the guy just wants to hit your pants but sincerely, what do they know? You know this person, not them. It hurts to be the rejected person, doesn't matter guy or girl. I've rejected, I've been rejected. People here seem like they never been rejected once, its kinda crazy, I don't know what kind of people would just look at the sexual version of things really. IMO read a bit about relationships and how the human brain works in this cases, you'll learn something. Also talk to people who actually have an open mind other than biased opinions based on small texts who just say ""a guy likes me but I just see him as a friend"" and start raging ""OMG HE WANTS TO BANG YOU!!!"" lol what the fuck..."
Advice,3e1yyt,moonfallsdown,4,Tue Jul 21 22:44:50 2015 UTC,"Well you are friendzoning him, there's no question about that. He has developed feelings for you and wants to be in a romantic relationship, and you want to stay friends. That is like a perfect example of friendzoning. Anyway I'm sure he'll get over it, you can still be friends, but don't be suprised if he doesn't want to reciprocate that friendship, since it is going to be very akward from now on."

You just have to recognize that you are INDEED doing precisely what you say you aren't.  But now that it has happened, his reaction is key. If he fails to respect that you just want to be friends, then the other advice is right -- this dude isn't your friend and you probably don't need him in your life. Give him a moment to work through the rejection, and if it doesn't pan out, then it doesn't pan out. He'll find someone else to pursue, and I'm sure you can make new friends."

If I did call HR the manager would just say she ''accidentally'' forgot her phone, or ''accidentally'' forgot to call back.   Her mentality seems to suggest that her moral is: ''It's not so fun when people don't contact you back quickly now, is it?''  Almost like she's giving me a taste of my own medicine in her own mind.   What she fails to understand is that it's her job to contact people to cover shifts; she literally gets paid to do it, as it's one of the basic tasks the store would expect of her. It's not my job to respond to work on my day off when I'm not at work. I don't get paid for it."

She is temporarily working with us while my actual manager is on holiday, so next time it shouldn't be a problem because my regular manager just sends me a text introducing herself and detailing the hours she would like me to work.  If, however, this nuisance manager does call me again I simply won't be responding to her. Or I'll just say no without feeling guilty.

Advice,3e19e9,Ledairyman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:33:46 2015 UTC,"Alright stick shift driver here. Learning stick is something that takes a long time to master. And as a beginner, hills and lights were my worst nightmare.  Here's how you get better. Assuming you're off on summer right now, practice. You're probably only 15/16 and don't have a license, but driving the car around in front of your house won't get you in trouble, unless you crash. If you feel like you would don't do it. Start and stop every 10 feet while driving. Learn how to properly release the clutch and push in the accelerator with near-perfect timing. This shit takes awhile, but a trick I found to learn was hold the accelerator down more than you think you need (not like all the way in, just push it a little further than you normally would). The engine will rev but if you release the clutch slowly, you can release the accelerator too. After getting that simple thing down, try pushing the accelerator less and less and less in until it stalls from missing the clutch. After that you'll get a good understanding of how to start and stop.  Hills. Uphill is a bastard, especially at a light. To learn that (which I still fuck up) you can do a few things. 1 bobble around in traffic, keep the engine going by staying in first gear and just slowly inch forward and backward. This way you never have to fully change gears but its hard to learn. Don't do this until you have a solid understanding of how to find that sweet spot, because it will stall if you just drop the accelerator and clutch while the engines on. If you do this now you'll probably get into a fender bender.  The way my dad taught me. Once stopped put the car into neutral and put the parking gear on. Then when the light goes green, put it into first gear and release the parking gear when you start going.  Honestly this is probably not super helpful because stick shift isn't simple. Reading everything you can to learn will not help you the slightest. I'd highly recommend having someone help you out because someone can teach you how. Having someone explain it over the internet won't be very beneficial."
Advice,3e19e9,MasterChefRamsey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:54:41 2015 UTC,"From a European where most people drive manuals :  When trying to get the car to go forward without conking out, but car in first gear, release handbrake, slowly let up the clutch til u feel your ""bite"" point,  (as in if you release anymore it'll conk on you), gently press accelerator, when car starts moving, slowly remove foot from clutch.  Practice this on a flat surface first, just so you know how to control it first before driving in traffic. Like an empty car park where you can't hit anything. All manuals are different so you need to get used to your clutch.  Source: learnt and did test in manual car in Ireland, once you have a manual car down, driving auto is like driving a bumper car: no effort at all."

Keyword browse so you need to capture attention fast and get to the point quick.  Body and Employment History- Brief important points highlighting your skills and experience. I like bullet point briefs as opposed to a body of text. Capture their attention, if they want more information about something they will ask.   Picture- I'd say business professional is the sharpest way to attract attention to your profile at first glance. I have a cropped head shot in a suit and tie, as most of my acquaintances do.

There is something called 'lung breath' which may be what you're dealing with.  What foods are you eating? How often do you brush your teeth? Do you know what the smell even is?  You may have a gastrointestinal issue and you might have the smell lingering around in your stomach, you may have bad gas and not know it, few things can be going on here.  My suggestion is to find someone who specializes in this specific area. If you go to your general doctors and tell them all this, they probably have no idea what to do. Which actually sounds right considering they're telling a patient they're 'too young' to have symptoms for something."

I have seen a gastroenterologist, a dentist, and even an ENT -- and none of them have smelled anything. The gastro issue that often causes a smell is acid reflux (or GERD), but I don't have a serious case of that, and I've also done an upper endoscopy which revealed nothing. If it was coming from my stomach (due to a fistula or something),it would have been detected during the scope.   I'm at a complete loss since the professionals don't detect any smell.

Advice,3e13rt,BigFloppyMick,2,Tue Jul 21 04:18:30 2015 UTC,"I got in to a similar situation years ago, I was driving down an outside lane when a person whom had just gotten their license that day pulls out from a turn off into the outside lane. I hit her driver side.  My car was fine, a ding smaller than a tennis ball and a cracked front lamp that I was unsure if was cracked before. Her door was mangled, I felt bad but nobody was injured.  I checked the damage and could easily see it was nothing and I would probably not fix it. So I suggested to the woman that since her car was obviously going to need more repair work that we exchange insurance information but leave the claims out of it.  She didn't agree, although I assured her it was clearly her fault and I was essentially giving her a get out of jail free card, still declined. Although she did admit that it was her fault.  So I quickly got 2 contact numbers for other motorists who were there and could attest to the incident. Phoned my insurance company to inform them of the incident and to expect no claim as the other party has admitted to causing the incident.  Then her insurance phoned me and requested some info so they could inspect the car. No problem. I told them I had the information of 2 witnesses to the collision if they needed it, they declined saying that the woman had already admitted to causing it.  They come the next morning with a tow truck, I had no idea what was going on, I showed them the damage, they recorded it, loaded up my car, gave me the keys to a rental and had me sign for it.  In the end the total bill came to over a thousand pounds, to remove a minor thing. The woman phoned me frantically afterwards trying to take me up on my original offer but it was too late, the insurance gods wanted their sacrifice.

I'm not sure if any are specifically about cooking for one, but I'm willing to bet you can find a lot of great info or resources if you poke around a bit.   Here are some things that work well for me:  Preparing some relatively basic base that's really bland. Then over the next several days days add new stuff to it that ""tricks"" you into thinking that it's something new. Like, spicy quinoa in a tortilla with some lime, eggs, and parsley is totally different from quinoa in a bowl with some fruit or or chicken and some yogurt and mint or something. Point being, by having a bland (read: versatile) base you can change it up pretty easy.   Don't be afraid to freeze things ahead of time. R Meal Prep Sunday is a great resource, even if you only want to do it a little bit. Like both those things, leftovers are key!   I've found that the ideal number of trips to the grocery store for me is two per week. Any more frequently and I tend to buy too much and waste food and money; any less frequently and some fruits or produce won't be peak, and may start to go bad. Figure out what number works for you.   Personally, I can't cook meals for one person 3 times a day. That's just too many dishes and I'm too in love with leftovers to pull that off. If you can, fantastic, but I cannot.   Oh, and don't forget that bread and milk can be frozen. The bread won't taste quite as good after defrosting, but it's still reasonably good and I can't go through a whole loaf before some starts to go moldy.   I've only really rarely gone through more than 12 eggs before the use by date.   And Google some storage tips for food. Some stuff can last a really long time when stored properly, but many people aren't aware of proper storage because in a multi-person household we go through it quickly enough.   Oh, and if you find yourself in a rut and want to get out of it then try placing restrictions on a meal or a day or two.

It's not fair to your neighbors or to your dog. Dogs can get lost or hurt surprisingly quickly. You may think dogs need to run around on their own to be happy. Maybe true to some extent, but they are pack animals and feel more fulfilled doing something with their pack (for your dog, that's you).   I suggest you take walks with your dog on a leash. It's good for you, good for the dog, and good for your bond. Make sure he gets plenty of opportunities to explore, but with you paying attention and clearly leading. Then when you are doing yardwork, keep him inside or in the yard on a cable run.  I guess I'm a bit sensitive about this issue, because I have  neighbors who insists their dogs are perfectly trained, so they don't need to be restrained. they've charged my dog (who was on a leash), growled at my kids and are allowed to shit in inconvenient places. In other words, they think everything is fine and clearly I'm just being a dick, but in fact things aren't alright. Dogs need to be restrained if their owners are not paying full attention to them. No offense meant, but so does yours."

Advice,3e02se,MasterChefRamsey,2,Tue Jul 21 00:06:48 2015 UTC,"More than just a simple divorce, unfortunately. In many countries, when someone receives residency status from a marriage, you agree to ""sponsor"" them. This means that even if things don't work out, you agree to support them financially 100% for however many years the contract states (in Canada, for example, I believe it's 3 years for a couple without children). You getting a divorce does not absolve you of this, and in fact getting a divorce becomes a much larger issue when you've agreed to sponsor someone. Do not agree to sponsor someone believing you can just ""get a divorce.""  Furthermore, OP may want to check whether or not he can even sponsor her. Several countries have ""marriage fraud"" laws, including ones where couples who have not been in a romantic relationship (as defined by the state) for a minimum proud of time (e.g. at least two years in Canada) are not eligible for sponsorship. There are also income-related checks, similar to my first point, wherein the sponsoring party has to prove income capable of supporting their partner for however long. Even if a law doesn't exist, couples still in the early dating phase are often likely to be rejected based on the other requirements and their relative ""instability"" regardless.   Here is a good link for the Canadian sponsorship rules and processes. Obviously, these rules highly depend on the country, so if OP is seriously considering this, he will need to do research for his country well before he pops the question: http://immigrationcanada.pro/immigration-rules/spousal-sponsorship/  Source: I've looked into all this extensively with my longterm boyfriend (I'm the ""foreign"" one)."

Marrying someone should not be a 'yes or no' question you have strangers answer for you.

Even for little stuff like dorm things or books save up NOW so you can get some things out the way. For example, each paycheck, take $10 or $15 or even $5 out and put it aside. Do NOT touch it. Okay so let's say you get paid every week, within a year, you would save over $1000 which can go towards house things or books etc.  I went to a workshop and a very smart man said it is so much cheaper to go to community then transfer to a larger school.

Just remember this, IF you manage your money correctly, loans will be paid off and NOT hinder your life (like buying a car and house etc). Just live below your means the first few years and get them paid down like crazy. Also I went 4 years at USC and kind of wish I went to community college first. However, a lot of schools will force you to retake classes so that may put you back a year. So I wouldn't do more than 1 year of community college if you take that route.

Advice,3dxymx,baileybird,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:35:43 2015 UTC,"I had the same exact thing happen to me. My dad, a pedophile who was arrested after he molested an 11 year old, abused me, and my brother,  was dying and I did not go see him. There was no sense in it for me. Life is too short to waste on people who are cruel and abusive. My brother never stopped seeing my dad- ended up inheriting a lot of money. I Didn't and it doesn't bother me.  My dad was living in Manila, where he could freely seek out children to quench his need to hurt others.  Do not go see your dad unless it serves you to, otherwise, avoid him like the plague. You got away and you've healed- or so it seems- and seeing him on his deathbed will only wound you. You won't be able to say what you want, how could you? The guy is dying, saying anything other than comforting things is out of order, right? Why force yourself to swallow so much deceit? Just don't.  The fantasy of getting even isn't worth it. Besides, save your money and time, he's not worth it. Your brother's wife is wrong- you don't have to do shit. She wasn't raised with a cruel and abusive asshole, it's not for her to say, comment or decide. It's only up to you.  I wish you all the best and hope you find more happiness in your life. It's strange how so many people on reddit will defend pedophiles. As the child of one, like you, we know the shame, the struggles and the loss of innocence that can never be replaced.

I personally think you should go just simply because it's a chance to reconnect with your siblings. Add in the fact it might bring a bit of closure with your dad. However, if all your planning on doing is yell and assault him your best bet would be to stay home."
Advice,3dxymx,Skippy8898,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:47:02 2015 UTC,"I had an abusive father as well, he was abusive in a much different way, but I can relate to the hatred you bear. I can also relate to you wanting to make your father feel the kind of fear, helplessness, and pain he put you and others through. So many wicked and terrible people die without ever having to face the consequences of their actions.   I honestly can't say what you should do, but if you do anything, make sure you think about the outcomes of your actions, not only on your family and father, but on yourself. It doesn't sound like you have much time left to consider these options unfortunately. Make sure if you do something it won't be something you regret.   For me, I was able to deal out a small dose of revenge on my father, and I can tell you it was a damn satisfying experience. I also have more planned if the day comes when he's on his death bed. I really enjoyed making that worthless sociopath feel just a fraction of the fear and torment he put me through, but in the end it didn't fix anything, didn't help him or me become better people, or even take some of the pain away, I still have a giant life destroying blackhole in my heart. And in some ways I was disgusted with myself because that piece of shit took a good happy well adjusted human, and made them into a warped broken shell of a man who could take enjoyment in seeing someone suffer, even if my father deserved it.  My advice, if you do anything, don't resort to threats or violence, but know that there are ways to be intimidating and threatening that don't require force. Realize this isn't about him, it's about you, be every bit as selfish and cruel as he was, and then some. If you contact him, you need to be in total control, not only of the situation but of yourself. Be cold and indifferent, don't react to him, act every bit the coldblooded inhuman monster he was toward you, show no emotion. If it were me, I'd consider just showing up only to say to him, 'I'm just here to watch you die.', and then just stare at him. Don't give him the satisfaction in thinking he can make you react, even slightly.   Lastly and maybe most importantly is, we get out of this world what we put in. This is a warning to you that in making others feel fear and pain, even someone we think is universally reviled and despised, many times only perpetuates those things. What you do could have profound affects on those who might still care about your father, and sometimes people who might seem like they didn't care, really did care all along, and this is including yourself.   But even doing nothing can cause pain too, so there's that.  No matter what, good luck to you, keep doing your best to be good to yourself and others so that the legacy of generational abuse ends with you. Do your best to help others, and spread the message so that no one has to relive what we went through."

Advice,3e0mka,die_totschlager,2,Tue Jul 21 01:16:23 2015 UTC,"It's possible that she just forgot. I know that's not a really good excuse, but it happens often in weddings. There's just so much to plan and do, that when it's all over some people forget about the final and most important step - thanking people. I don't say this because she's not at fault, but just she probably didn't mean to be malicious and you shouldn't let it ruin your relationship if she apologizes.  So how to bring it up? I'd say do it in person. Tell her you have something to talk about with her that is weighing on you. Be direct. Talk about how this has really hurt your feelings and especially your mother's feelings. She probably will feel really bad. She might get defensive and not apologize, but if she does at least you'll know."

Move out and never spend another cent on your mother. Let her earn her own money. You have better things to spend money on at this age. Break contact with her.

Then arrange for your bank account to routinely deposit half of what your girlfriends mother pays into her account.  Legally there is not a great need to change lease info etc (this will cost you) as you can claim that as family members you are staying with your girlfriends mother, sitting, etc.   As long as your money is going into your girlfriends mothers account that should relieve the stress from her end. Plus only having to pay half is a good deal. From the realtor's end, nothing will appear out of order, the rent still comes in, and then everyone leaves when the lease is up. No one is put out."

It's entirely possible that she's not, and that you're reading too much into it.  If she is, then it's probably not to keep getting your business.  It's probably because she's actually interested in you in that way.  Which is nice, but also kind of a problem because that's a big no-no for therapists.  And you're also underage by most considerations.  I won't say for sure on that because it depends on the jurisdiction.  But it's at least weird, like if you were flirting with a 12 year old girl who was looking to you for advice.  I don't know the specifics, though.  If you think a relationship with this woman would be okay, and you're interested in one, maybe ask her out.  But keep in mind she's not a very responsible or healthy person, and while the attention's fun and satisfying, you might be inviting a whole lot of crazy and tragedy into your life.  Either way, I'd suggest seeing a different therapist.  If for no other reasons than that you don't feel like she's helping you and that her treatment of you is distracting and uncomfortable."

The question boils down to 'do you feel victimised' I would hazard a no as you have said you enjoy it. However, if she is a nice person and you could see yourself having some fun with her ask her some simple subtle questions to let her know such as, ""how much longer will I need therapy for? What are the rules for people who are no longer patients? Do you honestly think I need therapy?""   These questions should prompt her.   I should add that - I assume that you live at home being 17 and that she has her own place. I assume that your parents have paid her for the therapy and as such have met her. As a result I assume that should you want a proper relationship with her and also have your parents know of her it could be awkward.   That being said if you are not on a tight leash with your parents so to speak I would suggest ambiguously asking for her phone number one session and then when you have finished therapy message her. Or if you honestly feel she is old enough to handle her own consequences and you want to have sex with her still and you think she does too, text her before going to bed once you have her number even if you are still in therapy.  Remember as a patient all that will happen to you is either a yes, or a no sorry that's not whats going on here (with the potential for a change of therapist).

And I don't see why he can't be a supportive father and a disgusting pig. Maybe you view him like that, but I want you to think about it like this - Years of love should never be forgotten by hours, days or months of hate. He's still your dad. You can't change that. You can't change that he cheated on your mom with a girl your age. That's already happened. Him being your dad for 20 years has already happened.

Advice,3e13w1,djcecil2,2,Tue Jul 21 06:15:42 2015 UTC,"You should never been told about this because it has absolutely nothing to do with you or your relationship with your parents...  My father had an affair with some younger lady when I was about 13, went on for a long time.  My mother told us about it.  My sister started cutting herself and i had a breakdown because we were just too young to realise that it wasn't our fault.   He was an abusive ass before the affair started, but he got worse as time went on... For a long time after my mother told us, I had serious problems resenting the woman he had the affair with, trusting people, and eventually ended up being groomed by a paedophile because I just didn't see it coming and needed a new father figure.. But that's a different story.  In the end I realised the lady he had the affair with did us a favour because my parents got a divorce.  As I've matured I realised they really weren't right for eachother and I'm glad they divorced.  When he was with her he was not thinking about you..  He is not just a father, he is a man and a person who has needs, if you're mother wasn't meeting them then he went elsewhere.  It's a tale as old as time.  I understand totally what you're going through because I've been there.  My advice: get over it.  Don't give it a second thought and don't let it fuck you up.  Your parents are your parents and you all have a relationship that's family, but they also have their own marital relationship completely separate to you.  It is understandable that you feel betrayed, I know the feeling well, and heartbreaking that your dad thought so little of his marriage that he jeopardised the entire family, but much as we all like to think it, our parents lives don't always revolve around us.  You're an adult now.  Pick yourself up and get on with it.  And I'm saying that with love and understanding."

I highly doubt you haven't.  Believe it or not, this is the same thing. You're dad fucked up, and now has to live with that.  He didn't think about you because he wasn't thinking about you. You mean to tell me that if a super hot guy your dad's age wants to sleep with you and you want it too, your gonna think of your dad first? No, you're not.  You're dad loves you, but he made a selfish decision he now has to live with.   If you're dad truly didn't love you, you think he would have told you? He admitted he was wrong and apologized, and that's all he can do at this point.  This sounds to me like you really view your dad as ""one of those creepy middle aged guys who preys on girls your age."" I really wish o didn't conclude that, but when you're focusing on this girl's age as much as you are, that kind of says something. Remember, this 20 year old made the conscious decision of sleeping with your dad also.

You're an exception to a rule and I shouldn't have assumed either way. But I'm pretty sure crashing a $50,000+ car disappointed your dad in a lot of ways that he probably never showed you.   And I'd find it very creepy if someone my dad's age wanted to sleep with me.    Well it was hypothetical, and I did say that you would be attracted too because, you know, hypothetical situations aren't real.   And yes I would be this angry and hurt. Like I mentioned in the post. I only found out she was 20 today. I've known about the affair for a month. And I was angry and hurt the whole time. This just exacerbated my feelings.    My question is why did her age exacerbate things? What is the reason that her age makes this worse to you?  I mean, just reading the context of everything you said, did you feel like he didn't love you when you first found out? Or after finding out the girl is your age?  Let me tell you a little story about a friend of mine. We'll call him S. S thought his mom and dad had the perfect relationship: Good ole Christian people; went to church, contributed to the community, loved their son.  One day he finds out that not only is his dad cheating, but so is his mom. He freaked out like this, because his whole world fell apart. Yet, he picked himself by the bootstraps, swallowed his pride, and forgave the both of them.  I'm gonna say this and if it hurts then I'm sorry. But you don't know the whole story. Even if you think you do, there's a huge chance you don't. Have you asked your mom why she thinks this happened? Did you ask your dad when he told you?  You want advice? Be angry at your dad, but don't write him off just because he fucked up. And I don't care how damaging this is to you right now, because everyone makes mistakes, and some are waaaay worse than an affair.   Let him know you are disappointed, let him know you're disgusted. But if you keep thinking that he doesn't love you, you're just gonna dig a deeper and deeper hole of regret.   Trust me, I know when a dad doesn't love his children.   He was there for 20 years of your life (still is too), and because one little indiscretion you think he doesn't love you? What if you cheated on your bf, your parents found out, and your dad thought you didn't love him anymore? That's just ridiculous right?"

I really am, I tried making you think about everything rather than just your feelings to understand all of this. That's obviously not what you want. What you want is someone to validate these emotions, and no one in this post is, yet we are. But you need to realize that all three of you are hurting, not just you.

Unless you're an on-call person, it's perfectly acceptable for you to not pick up, not respond, or even have your phone turned off. Did she leave a voicemail asking you get back to her? What if you were out of state? I'm sure you're not the end-all, be-all for this place. Relax.  You may want to have a chat about what happened with your current manager once she feels better. If you have another day off coming up and the ex-manager is still in charge, tell her you won't be working the next day, the before you're off. If she asks you to work the next day right then and there, tell her you've got plans."
Advice,3dxkd1,chunli99,7,Mon Jul 20 12:03:20 2015 UTC,"Nah, definitely not on-call. When I retorted that I was asleep, and had been for a reasonable period of time, her argument shifted to the onus being on me to call her back. I didn't know what to say to that so I apologised.   Normally, my regular manager will leave a voice mail, or a text message, introducing herself and detailing the hours she would like me to work. I respond if it's a text, but I don't respond to phone calls from them unless their voice message explicitly requests ambiguously for me to call them back urgently. I've never had a problem thus far. Additionally, this ex-manager isn't listed in my contacts and she called me from her personal cell number, so it was listed as an arbitrary and irrelevant number. I also don't understand why she didn't just text me since she used her cell phone (would have been easier) that way she would have been able to add context. I presume she knew I would say no and wanted to gain some emotional leverage on me by getting me to speak to her instead of text.   The problem for me is that they always roster me with extremely short shifts (three hours) but for the better part of the day, so I can't plan anything else that day. Because they spread my hours out so thinly throughout the week, instead of consolidating them into longer and fewer days, it also means I have very few actual days off so I understandably accrue an abundance of week-to-week errands that really need tending to on my days off. I flat-out resent the notion of having them expect me to ''respond'' to them on my days off. I don't think it takes a rocket scientist to extrapolate that I'm not available if I haven't answered my phone — if I was a manager and somebody didn't answer their phone I would simply interpret that as a ''no'' and view it as a bonus if they did respond.   But I think what this ex-manager is alluding to is the consistency of my lack of response. Or at least, I would imagine that would be her argument if I simply said I wasn't available that day: ''Oh, so what about the others days you never responded? You were busy on those days too, were you?''"

Advice,3dxkd1,BlockedID,2,Mon Jul 20 13:17:03 2015 UTC,"I see your point and agree. . . which is another part of the problem: I'm too easily guilted and am a bit of a yes-man. My regular manager has just learnt to make requests at me when I'm at work. For instance, she will say ''can you do a shift on Thursday?'' and I will be like ''Yeah, of course, no problem''. I don't mind that because she's giving me notice. What I take issue in isn't even that this ex-manager calls me on my days off, but that this particular lady seems to take issue in my liberty to not respond.    Here's the transcription of what I said in another comment:   She would call me and ask if I was available, and I would say no, so she would sternly go: ''Why. . .What are you doing?'' with a strong tone of incredulity and resentment, and then all the things I had planned for that day would suddenly seem less important and more trivial and I would feel really guilty. She would continue: ''I ask because we really, really need you in today. Do you think you could come in?''   ''I'm sorry, but I really am busy''.   -extremely long pause- (sometimes a faint sigh in the background)   ''Okay, well, no problem. . .Cya''"

You are under no obligation to be on call or advise them as to your comings and goings when you are not at work.  She called you at 6am and did not leave a voicemail or text you?

There seems to be this massive grey area within part-time employment. Two decades ago the concept of a cell phone didn't exist, now people have come to expect that you own a phone per ''stipulation'' of your employment. Funny that. I get it if you're a surgeon on-call or a CEO of a multi-million dollar conglomerate. But I shouldn't have to live in fear that I may get called into work today when I'm out and about.

Community service opportunities are almost always there. There's many kinds of organizations who need help.   As for motivation, you just got to find it within yourself (as lame as that sounds)! Start small. Make a small goal, and expand from there! We can't always be accomplishing something every minute. And at the same time, we can't always sit inside and expect things to happen to us. I could even suggest meditating on it. Relax, and think of what you like doing, and apply it to your community. See what you can do with the talents you have!

He wanted to give his information to people regardless of if they wanted it, the fact you didn't want it and he got upset is his problem not yours.   What's sad is maybe he's right, but the way he conducted his point was inappropriate so it almost doesn't matter. He was in the wrong for trying to guilt trip you, it should be your conscious decision to help or learn not a chore because someone asked. Fact of the matter is those people are looking for handouts, you're doing them a favor by acknowledging their needs, otherwise normal human interaction with a stranger would be a second of eye contact and maybe a smile. The best thing you can do besides helping is to make eye contact and acknowledge their humanity, but that's unfortunately not always possible with crazies so it's ok if you can't do that to everyone.  You definitely don't have to be giving handouts or listening all the time to anybody who gets upset or acts like they need you to, and you shouldn't feel bad for not being able to or not wanting to. What matters are the times you do feel like being generous, and since you've done that some you're already ahead.  TL;DR: You're not bad you're normal. Normal contact with strangers is eye contact and maybe a gesture, and that'd be more than good for most homeless or street people.

The only way to know is to ask him/talk to him about it unless you have mind reading powers. I don't know what its like with girls, but us guys like things straight forward. Honesty is the best policy IMO. If he respects you and likes you enough, nothing will be ruined by inquiring to him. YOUR health comes first.  Unfortunantly, stds could be obtained easier in theory, because of the nature of FWB style relationships. I find it hard enough to find real partners to get tested for stds before intimancy; let alone a FWB.

What happened to me was some of my close friends were lost, one died, one became a drug addicted prostitute and the last moved on with a whole wife and kids deal so I was alone. I also lost my job that allowed me to be in a bubble away from human interaction. Finally Alone and horribly depressed I thought about suicide. Then something inside me said if you feel this bad living this way try something radical to break the spell I mean when you are that close to suicide there was no place to go but up. I signed up for school to pursue my dream of starting my own business. With some grant and loan money I got a car and began delivering pizzas. I put myself into a position where i had to interact with people and slowly the panic attacks stopped. the words started to come out more smoothly and i found my sense of humor I was too scared to show. Now here I am, I have plent of friends at my job, met several people at school and reconnected with my close friend who i was distant from.

Do what you would normally want to do when hanging out with any friend.  Since she is insisting on just the two of you, perhaps she has romantic designs here. This is possible and it's possible that she is more comfortable and experienced with this kind of thing. If you're into that then let her take the lead and she probably will.

Talk to them as friends not potential romantic partners.   Stop trying to be cool or seem smooth because guess what, that's gonna let her know you are neither of those things.  You know what I realized girls respond to? You being you; its cheesy, its cliché, but it fuckin' works.  By the by, I know I said you be you, but that doesn't mean to be... 'Cringey.' For example, if you do something with your close friends that other people might think is weird, then don't do that.  Just talk to her like you're not gonna get her number. Talk like you're just trying to make small conversation (because that is exactly what you're trying to do).   Last thing, don't hold girls on a pedestal. Just because she's cute doesn't mean she's confident and can get any guy she wants.  The way you feel with girls, I can guarantee you a gorgeous girl has felt the same way with guys.  Last last thing, confidence doesn't mean a big ego. Confidence means being sure of yourself, and if you're not, girls can tell."

Advice,3dzd7w,MrMonYaMon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:34:07 2015 UTC,"Welllllll. I would suggest you do try cleaning the MAS on your own.  But if your power steering fluid is leaking, that could be dangerous for you and your passengers.  If it all leaks out you will lose power steering.  Which will make your wheel suddenly very hard (but not impossible) to turn.  This causes accidents and people die from this.  In addition, running around with no fluid will cause your power steering bits (pump?) to burn up.  I would search google and youtube to see if there is a permanent or temporary fix you can do right away.  Maybe you just need to add fluid periodically.  Sorry not much help.  Just offering what I know.  Good luck."
Advice,3dzd7w,YourAuntie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:58:26 2015 UTC,"Actually as long as the car is moving the steering wheel only becomes slightly harder to turn without power steering (I drove my buddies old ford pony that was so old it didn't have power steering). A sudden loss of power steering would only be slightly dangerous. An experienced driver could easily compensate unless you are racing down tight streets at 80 mph. An unexperienced driver might subconsciously learn ""if I do this, this is what the car will do"" an experienced driver will take an action and react to what the car does. That is why an inexperienced driver shouldn't drive many different cars. An experienced driver can handle driving different cars even in terrible conditions because of this ""learned"" ability.  Since he has already experienced this problem with his car and knows how his car reacts under those conditions (no power steering) he can drive it relatively safely even if he is a young driver."
Advice,3dzd7w,ferociousfuntube,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:47:53 2015 UTC,"I would argue that cars from before power steering used gearing to make it easier to turn the wheel.  A modern car depends on power steering and without it, the torque required to turn everything is much higher.    Turn the ignition to accessory mode to unlock the wheel and give it a try.  I had to push my 85 camaro around a few times when I was working on it, and turning it ain't easy.  Same for the brake pedal."
Advice,3dzd7w,YourAuntie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:41:37 2015 UTC,that is because without power steering a car needs to be moving for it to become easier to turn the wheels. If you had to do a k turn in my buddies car it was a real struggle to turn the wheel. I would even say my ex girlfriend wouldn't have been strong enough to do it. So I am not surprised it was hard to turn your car at the speed it would be going being pushed around.

Emotional Support Animals (ESA's) are not recognized by the gov't at this moment in Australia, so landlord technically don't have to do anything to accommodate those who need them.  Source:    If private landlords do not allow pets on the premises, do they have to allow access to guide, hearing and assistance dogs under these amendments?  Yes, a guide, hearing or assistance dog is not a pet. It is a specially trained support animal that allows people with a disability to access the community and live their lives.

The best thing to do would be to move, but if you honestly can't, write a very short email outlining that you've done a lot of research and believe that getting a dog or whatever will be beneficial for your mental health, and that you'd be prepared to put down money on a deposit, and link to any videos that can explain this well. What you don't want to do is beg or make your LL feel uncomfortable.   Also, I'm a bit concerned about a person with severe bipolar ism taking on such a huge responsibility as a needy pet. I mean, dogs are a hell of a lot of work, and when you're going through a depressed point, you can't ignore your responsibilities to that animal. A lot of pets that end up in shelters come from the homes of depressed people who just give up on taking care of them, or just can't take care of them.   Fish might be a good middle ground.  They're really relaxing to watch, and you might have a lot of fun setting up a tank.

If the college ever did find out, I find it hard to believe that they would be that harsh on him if he has at least something to show that he completed high school is some form. I do doubt that he has truly been admitted yet though, he most likely applied earlier in the year before he knew he would fail, and the college accepted him on the conditional fact the he would complete whatever credits he needed. They probably sent him a letter of conditional admittance that he would be accepted once they received a high school transcript, and then put him on the mailing list. Since he never graduated, they never got a transcript, so he was never fully admitted. It is very unlikely that he is truly admitted until he registers for classes, attends orientation, or attempts to use his financial aid. I'm just saying if he is really admitted then he could probably get away with at the college, but a job is required to check, like the college is supposedly required to check."

Just remember that plastic surgery can become addictive, and always have you chasing the next improvement. Instead of learning to love yourself and becoming comfortable in your own skin, you can find yourself seeking out and focusing on your imperfections.

She is responsible for her own life - and you need to be responsible for yours. I agree with plabadajan that your mother will probably ask you for money in the future, and you need to be prepared to say no."
Advice,3dzxyk,-justkeepswimming-,2,Mon Jul 20 22:57:11 2015 UTC,"Your mother has had a lot of tough breaks in life, but she has also been the cause of a lot of her own problems. Under no circumstances should you take out extra student loans to help her out. Student loans are not like other kinds of loans. They are easy to get and hard to get rid of. If you do fulfill your goal of becoming a physician assistant, you'll be able to help her out financially then. But if you take out extra loans now and then something happens to stop you from becoming a PA, you will be on the hook for that money for the rest of your life until you are able to pay it back. So many people have become trapped in the student loan debt cycle and it is ruining their lives. I should also point out that if your mother doesn't make enough money on her own to pay for an apartment, you're just putting yourself in an unsustainable situation. You'll have to take out more student loans next year, and the year after that, and every year until you get a job. Is that what you want to do?"
Advice,3dzxyk,plabadajan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:15:55 2015 UTC,"I should probably give some detail on the loan, it is a direct unsubsidized loan for 2,000$. She can afford the apartment, on her current salary, and this loan would just go to the deposit and the moving van, and it is definitely in my best interest to move now too because if we don't I will never make it to class on time, which gives me a catch 22. Take the loan and acquire debt, or don't take the loan and lose it all. I know financially it is almost always wrong to take on unnecessary debt, but it really looks like my only option to get out of this situation, and possibly out on my own."
Advice,3dzxyk,plabadajan,2,Mon Jul 20 22:26:02 2015 UTC,"That does kind of change things. $2000 is not that much money in the scheme of things, even though it's unsubsidized.

Without being accusatory, just tell her how you're still upset about your father passing away and that you are concerned that she is taking things too quickly with her new boyfriend.

Advice,3dzsjk,CasualStraightjacket,2,Mon Jul 20 21:22:17 2015 UTC,"My question is who is going to be financially responsible for this house?  Because a bank isn't going to allow you to put eight people on a mortgage agreement, so someone is going to have to be the primary.  Which brings up a host of other issues, what if someone moves out of the house?  How do you ""buy them out""?  What if something happens and the liability of the house falls upon the mortgage signer?  You know that the other 7 will basically have no legal obligation to help the signer?  I'd say, this is an idea that is really fun in theory but is definitely not a good idea because there are so many issues that could arise.  If you want to do this, my advice is to buy the house on your own, and then rent it out to your friends or set up something of the sort."
Advice,3dzsjk,defiancy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:23:27 2015 UTC,"Well, I would be the primary head of household. I know the area, and I would likely be the longest-lasting person in the household. As far as if someone moves out, we decided we would write up a contract for all of us to prevent such arguments. I have a few friends in law, and my mother's ex worked for the court system (specifically in land and property cases) so I will likely ask them to consult me on that regard.   The agreement is, is that we split all expenses evenly regarding issues that the house undergoes. Food bills, utility bills, mortgage payments, internet, etc etc. It will be split evenly among everybody, including couples.   The house itself is a brilliant opportunity, but I doubt my own ability to pay for the house on my own. If I could, I would, and then move people in afterwards. I'm only intending for Myself and one co-signer to be the names on the deed/mortgage, but the others would be living there and would have as much say in the house as I would.   I know these people very very well. And they have spent time talking to each other. If it doesn't work out for somebody, I have some other people I can call who would be interested.

Until you can add more bathrooms, perhaps start with fewer people in the house. Also, that is a lot of people to share the common space. Maybe just use 5-6 rooms as bedrooms and the other 2-3 as quiet spaces or studios or as a playroom if a child will live there.  Only one or two people should own the place. The rest would be renters.

The Museum of Morbid Anatomy in Gowanus is a favorite of mine, though it's a little difficult to access from central manhattan.  As any local will tell you, avoid Times Square, as it's crowded and full of overpriced attractions--there's more fun to be had in the villages and outer boroughs for much less.

Your first semester is going to be really hard on you if you're not prepared, because it is a completely different environment than high school. I'd take some of your free time here to prepare.  For starters, make sure you have everything you need before class. You can usually check on your university's online system (in the US they typically use Blackboard or Canvas, but you can always find out from their website) to get your syllabus ahead of time. I cannot stress how important it is to read them. When they say the whole course is on there, they really mean it. So go ahead and get your supplies in advance and if you want to be REALLY ahead of the curve, read up a little bit on what you're learning! It can never hurt. Not to say that you should feel bad if you don't do so - I have never once read in advance for a course that I wasn't really excited about.  Side note - unless the syllabus says they will be checking for textbooks, I wouldn't buy them in advance. They're very expensive and often not used.  So on top of materials and reading the syllabus, you may want to get in touch with your professors. I have to send my professors and email before the first class with my writs of accommodations because I have a neurological disorder that prevents me from writing. If you have any kind of disability that you would need assistance with in the classroom, go talk to your school's student disability services. In my experience they take a while to get you in and on file and everything so the sooner the better.  Beyond that, just relax! Your summer is yours and you can do anything you want. Good luck!"

Advice,3dzhk1,cyanoside,2,Mon Jul 20 20:05:37 2015 UTC,"You should absolutely consider taking a PT job, as long as the PT job gets you further in your career. If a manager has a choice between two candidates with exactly equal credentials (never the case, but go with it), and they have a choice between someone who has shown they can work and someone who doesn't have experience, they will take the first.  Hiring someone is about finding the best candidate, sure, but it's also about hiring the least amount of risk possible.   And if you take a FT job and then leave for another Ft job...that's life. I wouldn't do it every three months, but that's the world.   At this stage of your career, the best thing you can do is find jobs that allow your skills to shine and give you individual success stories that you can bring up in an interview and on a resume.

Advice,3dzhci,GhostGengar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:04:14 2015 UTC,"Well. I guess your first option is to make friends on reddit. Finding the right subreddit that aligns with your interest and just start posting and stuff.  Another major problem is your inability to handle social situations. Ideally you should seek a professional but I can try to give you a few ways to try and overcome this problem.  The first option would be to focus on the history of your problem. When did this start happening? Why is it happening? Was it a specific event? Was it just always like this? Has there been periods where it hasn't been too bad? Has it gotten worse or better over time? Is it just interactions with strangers that are extremely difficult for you?  another option would be to just learn about PEOPLE. Learn how people work and function. Knowing what other people are thinking about and being able to predict people's actions and words should help you out a bit.  Another option similar to the last one would be to focus on your beliefs. What you believe usually ends up determining what is true / what actually ends up happening. It's called the self-fulling prophecy. Most of the time, if you believe a stranger ""likes you"" before you talk to them, you will treat them kindly and positively and cause them to ""like you"" even if they didn't like you. the opposite is also true most of the time, if you believe a person doesn't want to have anything to do with you, then things can go terrible wrong.  Developing a wide variety of hobbies and interests may also help you find common ground with other people. If you have nothing in common with people, you may need to just expand your range of interests.  Another option may be to explore different worldviews, different religions, different philosophies. Perhaps what you believe about the nature of existence is affecting your ability to function. Do you believe there is life after death? do you believe life is meaningless? Do you believe humans accidentally happened and that we will eventually all turn to dust? If you're a nihilist, then you may need to change your expectations."

Long story short, I'm a dancer and also had difficulty in my passions due to the autoimmune disease. My recommendation would be that you need to see an autoimmune specialist and not your current rheumatologist. It might not be in your joints. My pain comes from swelling in the hands and actually doesn't have much to do with my bones for now. There's tests that could easily diagnose if this is something you have and you general Dr. should be able to refer you. If they wont, you need a new Dr. Sadly, the healthcare industry don't understand a lot about it and quickly disregard it as something in the patients head.  What's important is to have a Dr. that understands that it's not. It's been a challenge trying to find the medicine that works for me, but personally it's been a lot of topical stuff for welts and stuff I get and then internal medicines for inflammation and anti allergy doses to bring down any irritation inside. Luckily the medicine has no side effects other than making me super nauseous in the beginning, but like no long term organ effects etc. My Dr. has worked with me (as they should) because I'm also very holistic and hate taking regular meds.   I'm sorry if I talked your ear off it's just I totally understand the frustration of having something drs don't seem to know what to do with.

I don't know anything off the top of my head in that area, but I would start by doing some google searches for top hospitals in the area and drill down by specialty, search for specialists in the field and see what info you can find out about them.  Usually docs in the kinds of places you want to be in publish papers and do studies in their field.  If you find a doctor that has published a peer-reviewed paper, that's probably the one you want to go see.  Also, see if there is a subreddit for chicago and post on there.  Probably someone has needed to see a top-notch specialist at some point and they may be able to point you in the right direction.  I know it sucks feeling like nothing can be done to fix your situation.  When I had a similar issue, I was being seen by two ""specialists"" in my area and it wasn't until I finally went to the hospital for special surgery that my problem was properly diagnosed, let alone fixed.  Doctors like those at specialist hospitals and groups are of a different caliber.

I apologize if I come out a bit harsh but this hits home and it took me a while to realize these things. (Sorry for any repetition, jotting these down during work).  -Stop with the self pity. The more negative and hopeless you feel the more impossible it seems any good will come.  -Acknowledge your strengths and weaknesses. Look for jobs that way. Work on your weaknesses.   -Skills are trained just as weaknesses are worked on. You don't get them out of nowhere and it isn't easy. Those that persevere fail more than those that don't. Why? They aren't afraid of failing, and failing teaches you what not to do and what you need to work on.  -Your attitude and outlook affects the path you take. If you keep telling yourself you can't fix things and keep chalking up your failures to simply you being a fuck-up with no way to change things. Life isn't easy. The lazy ones that give up suffer. You are LUCKY to have the chance and situation to keep trying.   -Take accountability. Attention to detail and keeping your brain on seems like a focus issue. Have you been diagnosed with ADD/ADHD? What have you tried to try and improve on these issues? What didn't work and what options do you have if that's not the way to fix it?  -You will take pride in your work when you can take accountability and want to succeed.   -Reflect on your attitude. With the 30 day probation are you going into work trying to keep the job? Did you give up simply because your boss told you it probably wont work out? What effort are you taking to try and learn how to do the work? Are you asking questions and asking for extra help?  I've been fired before. One employer kept me on even when I tried to leave because they saw the effort I was giving. You can train yourself to check your work, and look for ways to make sure the work is accurate.  I had to beat myself up like this for a while till it really came across my head. Life gets better when you are self improving.

I absolutely hate my behavior, but I am also pretty scrappy, I know I need to fix it and I am not taking this lying down.   ADD seems like the most likely issue, since I WAS diagnosed as a kid. I wish I would have looked into medication earlier, but seeing a psych is so expensive. That's not a good excuse, but it was always what was holding me back. Watching my boyfriend have to spend thousands of dollars and months of time and not even get proper treatment has scared me a lot. I feel like I need to come up with a proper plan of action for the psych, but I do think it's time. I think it could be a huge improvement.

Advice,3dz8ia,Yowhattup,3,Mon Jul 20 19:23:48 2015 UTC,"That’s the spirit and attitude you need to get started! Your abilities and limitations are set by yourself. Your attitude and actions will determine your success. Some of the things I’ve learned are: -Be confident. Overconfidence on the other hand can hurt. Take no shortcuts. Let’s say you have trouble with a task but you trained yourself a checklist to look for errors. You got 100 projects in a row completely right. On the 101st try you decide you don’t need to check. Bam, you killed any confidence you gained and the routine check that was making you a better worker was broken. -Break bad habits, they trickle down to negatively affect other aspects of life. For example I should go to bed at 11, however I tend to stay on my phone or tablet and do not sleep until 1-2. This trickles down to me waking up late, rushing to get to work late, and being tired and having a slow production rate.  -Stop being lazy. Most of the time for me, I start giving myself excuses, then things do not get done. -Aim for progress incrementally. Don’t set the bars too high, aim high with progression in between. You need to slowly ease yourself in because you are breaking bad habits and creating new good habits at the same time. -Document stuff. If you are bad at keeping track of things, start writing it down. If you are getting trained, write as much down for reference later. -Find and identify weaknesses and distractions and eliminate them.  In terms of behavior training I treat it like physical athletic improvement. When I trained to keep my focus on tasks I first put away my phone and did not open any internet browsing tabs. I noticed I was breaking the rule constantly and that I could only focus for 5 min at a time. So I got a stop watch, and told myself I needed to focus longer on the work before I even check the time I’ve spent. I put goals as to how long I start the task that I would stop to check the time. 5 min became 6, then 10, then it got easier and I wouldn’t check the time until I was finished.  I’m drawn to this topic because I’ve been in my career for 4 years now, and have had 5 jobs so far. I learned so much and realized so much that if I can help I’m glad to. Sorry for the long jumbled post. I would be glad to help if you would like to PM and bounce situations and ideas off me or if you want another perspective on things."
Advice,3dz8ia,sarahkat13,3,Mon Jul 20 20:04:20 2015 UTC,"The other stuff here is really solid. I'm just going to try to add specifics, since much of what you've said is general. (But primarily, the ADD thing sounds likely to be affecting a lot of your behavior. If you can't get to a doctor yet, then at least look around online for information about how to organize tasks as an adult with ADD.)  What should a productive day at work look like, hour by hour? If you don't know that, then what should you get accomplished in a week, or a month? If you know, for example, that you need to answer emails within 24 hours, coordinate with vendors before every biweekly meeting, and get those TPS reports in every Friday by 3, then you have some sense of how you can structure your time in a given week. (Also, pay attention to hard deadlines vs. your boss's deadlines--your boss may be someone who wants to see that TPS report by noon on a day when it's due at 3. If that's the case, noon should be your goal.) It may be really worthwhile to draw out a calendar for yourself--5 days, 8 hours--and figure out when you should be doing each task. Would it be useful to schedule specific times for emailing, maybe toward the beginning and end of every day? Or schedule times for calling specific places? Then do that, and set alarms (phone, Outlook calendar, whatever you'd like) to make you aware of these things and keep yourself on track.  Same kind of thing with your issues regarding being detail-oriented. What tasks have you done before that you messed up because of the details? Create a checklist for yourself for when you have to perform that task again in the future. Maybe make a bunch of copies of it so that each time, you can carry it around with you and literally draw a check next to each item. When you discover a new detail that's important, add it to the list.  Some of your post sounds like you don't know how you function best.

Because quite frankly, I don't care about whether I eat too much or not? I am not that concerned about health unfortunately, and definitely not concerned about my appearance because being skinny won't make me more attractive so whatever. And due to my eating schedule as of late, I don't ever feel a crash. I just wake up unhappy, and when I finally eat until I am on the verge of bursting, that is when I feel ""good"". Well, better. And I sleep usually very soon after that (since I only get to eat freely late at night).   What I do want more than anything is to not rely on food so much. It's ridiculous. I spend way too much money on it, and yeah of course I think I should be healthier and I want to enjoy healthy food but it has never provided me with joy at all. For like half a semester, I was vegan and that was the worst mistake I ever did. For the remainder of the semester, I eat pretty healthy too but my mental health remained the same. So back to fatty food I went, and I felt much better. Sometimes, I have tried moving more because it is true I definitely do not move enough, but that only worked for one day and the rest of the time, it led to more bad feelings. Basically, I am sick of feeling apathy and only getting rid of it when I eat too much."

I understand many people don't think religion can help, but I have seen the complete opposite with some of my closest friends, dealing with depression, anxiety, or anxiousness. It was merely a suggestion. The point of this sub is to give advice. Sometimes there isn't a cut and dry series of steps or processes to fix something, especially something as personal as anxiety. I was simply speaking from experience and letting OP know what has helped me among many other of my friends. Anyways I hope you feel better OP.  If I may ask, how old are you? It is very common for younger people to worry over uncontrollable things.  I would recommend finding a strong religious base, and starting from there. If you already are religious, go into the church/temple/mosque/ etc. on any given day, and ask to speak to the religious leader in private. Ask for guidance from God, your religious leader, or even help guiding yourself. There are always people there to help you.  Also, keep in mind that there are things that outweigh death. Love, life, and happiness make death obsolete. We all leave this world, but we can change it before we go. We can imprint ourselves onto the land, loved ones, or just leave a lasting legacy or idea. We can share moments, find ourselves, lose ourselves in nature, and then find ourselves again in loved ones. We can experience emotions that make life so beautiful.   The easiest way to feel those things, is to let ago of your fears and restraints, and just embrace it all. Take in the air, your thoughts, and the ideas around you, and try to make something beautiful. Craft something that only you can understand, and then share that with someone you find beautiful. In the process of all of this, death won't be on your mind, because you know you are alive."

Advice,3dx38m,helpadumbo,4,Mon Jul 20 06:40:37 2015 UTC,"You seem to have a very low self esteem and this causes you to lose motivation and discipline.  What is this ""something"" that stops you from pursuing your hobbies? Could it be laziness? Maybe it's intimidation, meaning that you don't see the point in pursuing hobbies because you feel that you aren't good at them and that others will always be better than you. Hobbies are just hobbies, even if you suck that is no reason to stop pursuing them.  Maybe try and get away from everything for a bit. Try living in a different set of circumstances. Go camping or pick up some books that you can get lost in. Volunteer maybe."

Advice,3dx38m,kairon156,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:44:14 2015 UTC,I think you're right about the self esteem.  I'm not sure it's laziness that stops me.  It feels more like a total lack of desire to do it even though I know it'll feel good.  Sounds like laziness but it feels different.  I'm still at home with the folks but looking to move out with a mate in the next few weeks so hopefully that'll have a positive effect.
Advice,3dx38m,Benfclark,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:13:28 2015 UTC,"Perhaps it's a confidence issue? Perhaps you feel that it's pointless to try and do things because there's a part of you insisting that anything you put yourself to will turn out shit? I had the same problem myself for a long time, and it really put me down and stopped me from doing a lot of things that I wish that I had done.   All it took to break that mindset for me was to take the figurative dive and actually start doing things, specifically the things that I had had big reservations about my abilities in before. Things like programming or learning an instrument, and it turned out that I could actually do them and not suck massively, and I was surprised at my own progress. Once I had taken that quantum leap I started feeling much better about other areas of my life, and I no longer look at things with such a defeatist mentality. Where there was once 'I couldn't possibly do that, so there's no point trying', there's now 'Whether I can end up doing it well or not, I'm going to give it a damn good go'.   Go and make a list of things that you've been wanting to try doing for a while, but have been afraid of starting, and goddamn do them, throw yourself at them, and remember that succeed or fail you'll either gain something or learn something.  I hope that this has been of some help. Let me know how things go for you!"

Personally I try to be someone I can be proud of even if it's simply for the little every day things. While keeping in mind we are all human and prone to making mistakes.  I've always been a deep thinker so self reflection comes easy for me and I'm able to enjoy who I am and accept the things I can't change while at the same time knowing what I would like to change and make minor adjustments over time toward my personality goals. As I stated above I keep in mind I'm only human so I don't need to be perfect, just to be the best me I can be.  if you have further questions feel free to ask. Good luck with finding yourself."

Having promise of a job is an issue that some colleges can help you with.

You need to focus on yourself, as well as those around you. If you do decide to follow an art career, in time they could come around to your way of thinking, if not, that's on them, which is also fine. You and your loved ones don't need to agree on your future, after all.  You can always do art while working in the hospital. You may also find a specialty or something else that may feel less monotonous that you could do with your medical degree. There could be a way to compromise. You could go to art school while working part time as a doctor. Or you could continue to work in medicine while teaching yourself art and possibly trying to find others like you through clubs and local gatherings.   There are many ways in which you could go and I sincerely hope you give it time and remember that no decision is set in stone and that change is always possible."

You could also call the local fire department or police station and see if they can point you in the right direction.  My last resort would be to look up your areas laws about tenant rights.

Lastly, when the time is a bit closer to actually start applying, I wanted to email advisors or their superiors on linkedin or possibly move there early with my bf and go on some informational interviews.

She should also not keep this bag in her car, as I'm sure he knows what her car looks like and would just wait by it for her to come out. She should be escorted to and from her car, and people should be checking to make sure she got home safe, and maybe checking in again about two hours after she says ""yes.""   Also, she might want to go over someone else's place(preferably someone pretty tough) for about an hour or two before she heads to hers in case he tries to tail her home...have that person check and see if they notice any random cars parked nearby, visible from the windows. Maybe the same car driving by occasionally.  A lot of people say ""take a longer route home"" but if someone is determined and has a full tank of gas, they will continue to follow you. If she notices someone tailing her, she can just head to a police station; most people take off after that.  As for when she gets home, I personally have someone on the phone with me anytime I come back from vacation while I open the door and then go around my entire apartment, turning on all the lights and checking behind doors and in closets. I also keep a can of mace near me at all times. She should have one in her purse and one by her bed.  A lot of states have little to no protection against stalking. It's weird.

Most transactions will actually show where the charge came from, so it should say JAY'S_BAR or something along those lines.  My guess? This is illegal. They rang up his charges, and added a $25 bill without any means of proof, such as a receipt. If he didn't get the original receipt (as in he wasn't asked if he wanted one), he needs to file this to his bank, and talk to the bar's management."
Advice,3ducyb,Vhett,12,Sun Jul 19 16:37:58 2015 UTC,"I talked to the bar manager and was promptly told to fuck off. We used to work there so I think that's why they thought they could get away with charging my friend more. I asked him if he would do this with a random customer and he dodged the question. I asked him what he would have done if Friend had paid with cash and he dodged the question.   Later, he sent me a text. Here's an excerpt:  ""He has a credit card slip for the portion of his tab he paid. So Ashley pre authorized his card to a certain amount and closed it. She forgot to change the amount of the pre Auth of his whole tab. So technically his tab was more. Either quit drinking and know what the Fuck you bought or shut the Fuck up. Text me some bullshit again. Like I said I could give two fucks about what you two think. O and technically it's illegal to walk out without paying your full tab.""  The whole pre-authorization thing doesn't make sense to me because   A. I'm pretty sure it only pre-auths like $10 to ensure the card is good and  B. How does the bartender accidentally charge the wrong amount and then close the tab? You wouldn't be able to without settling the remaining payment. The drinks would have to have been added after the fact. I don't know if anyone in this thread has worked in service industry before but it just doesn't add up."
Advice,3ducyb,Vhett,11,Sun Jul 19 17:30:30 2015 UTC,"That's illegal then. She wrote up the wrong charge...but the thing that applies here is the charge itself.   Legally, what a bill is, is the understanding that this amount of money is owed for the service. A receipt is an acknowledgement between customer and owner/management that the amount is agreed upon.  If a restaurant undercharges you, they cannot ask for more due to the fact the charge is the legal binding of all transactions for the night.   In most locations, if someone accidentally undercharges, what they do is inform management at the end of the night, but they cannot forcibly make you pay more after the original bill. What they should do is come up to you, state that the charges were incorrect, and ask if they can right the mistake due to the fact you do technically owe more than what was charged for.  TL;DR: That's still illegal, and what the manager said is bogus. I'd get your friend to refute the charge to his card, due to the fact that how it was done is without a doubt, illegal."

Advice,3ducyb,idiosyncrassy,3,Sun Jul 19 20:40:00 2015 UTC,"It's up to you to decide.  1) If you guys know or at least suspect that MAYBE you did in fact get $25 more drinks than were paid for, then call it even, despite the guy being a dick.   2) If you guys used to work there and MAYBE you regularly get the former employee discount in the form of economical bar tabs, then maybe call it even so the bar doesn't feel that you're abusing their generosity.  But if neither of the above scenarios are the case, then your friend should call the restaurant and dispute the charge, then call the bank and dispute the charge. He's got a credit card slip for $40 with his sig, and they have a slip for $25 with no sig. No sig, no authorization. End of story.  That manager's being a shit stain and knows damn well he has absolutely no legal standing for what he's trying to get away with.  Source: Used to tend bar, now work for a bank."

Advice,3ducyb,NWBoomer,0,Sun Jul 19 19:40:28 2015 UTC,"This is one of the major difference between using Debit cards versus Credit cards: When you use a debit card, the money is transferred from your bank account to the vendor. It is paid just as much as if you gave the vendor cash. So the only option is to negotiate a refund from the vendor (bar tender).  Credit card payments are provisional and therefore can be disputed because the credit card company is a third party. Credit card purchases can be disputed which is necessary to prevent fraudulent  transactions.  Personally I only use my debit card to withdraw cash from an ATM. I use my credit card for all other purchases. In this example, had the bar tab been put on a credit card, there would be a way to dispute the charge, even consider it fraud. But the debit card transaction is as good as cash, the money has already changed hands."

Remember this, ok? Maybe helping other injured critters can help? Perhaps preparing for this can help? If yes, then it's up to you how far you want to take this.   You could have a go-bag sort of kit in your car in case you ever see an injured animal by the road. A sturdy box, a few towels or soft rags, and a sturdy pair of gloves (hurt critters scratch and bite) for starters.   Learn what your local agencies are for injured animals. Who rescues animals? Who rehabilitates wildlife? Who can you call in the middle of the night and weekends?  Maybe learn basic animal rescue techniques. Possibly volunteer a bit at local animal shelter."

Heck, they will literally kick so hard they'll snap their own backs and die if they're startled. They're just not sturdy animals.

I lost touch with my bff throughout high school due to going to different schools. When we reconnected years later, we didn't have a lot in common but we did share that sort of spark that enables you to let your guard down and to be comfortable with someone. A friend should be able to share feelings and talk about them. In order to connect and make a tighter bond with someone, I'd say sit down, share a drink and just talk about what worries you, what worries them, etc. Forming a tight friendship is a tricky thing, not something that can forcibly happen.  If you keep putting yourself out there and try to find who you can talk to and who you care about a little bit more than most, you may be able to find a loyal bff."
