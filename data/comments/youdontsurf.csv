Just saying anti-Semitic things over a stock image of a Jewish family doesn't make something funny.   You need a good set up, like this.

youdontsurf,3e29qk,Judas_Clergyperson,4,Tue Jul 21 17:13:53 2015 UTC,"It's not about how ""offensive"" something is over how you make humor with it.   Louis C.K makes jokes about tape all the time, but the way he sets it up makes them actually funny.   Daniel Tosh just goes ""Wouldn't it be funny if someone was raped?"" and then gets pissed that no on got his ""joke"".   Same with any ""Offensive"" joke. The whole point of comedy is someone is on the receiving end. Someone is the butt of the joke. It's how you set up the joke and execute it.   This is without going into the whole ethics of who or what to lampoon. The joke has to be a actual joke.   Even with the low-hanging ones, it's best to remember: The higher the fruit is up the tree, the sweeter it tastes."

Pee is hot, relatively, and melts the fuck out of snow.  This snow isn't nearly melted enough for my approval.  Noway.jpg   Conclusion 1:  Not piss.  Some kind of chilled, yellow liquid,  squirted from a ketchup like bottle, allowing for easy (enough) cutoff.      Conclusion 2:  Freak human, with substandard piss temperatures, mechanical urethra, and super extendable penis to allow for close-to-surface, dribble free writing precision.   I prefer this option.

I'm not subbed but I'm reasonably sure it's been a cesspool for as long as I've been on reddit because it's filled with 14 year olds who think they're the shit.

The remaining soldiers are operate all kinds of facilities and services. For example, driving heavy vehicles, cooking,  handling logistics and supplies or giving medical care. These soldiers are not normally required to be trained to be in battle and usually go through a very basic training that takes about three weeks. The uniform you see is not the official one, but just what the soldiers wear inside the base when dealing with messy things, or being trained. Though it is not permitted to wear different kinds of shoes, it doesn't take more than a simple note from the doctor to get a permit to wear non-standard shoes. The soldier you see in the stock photos are from completely different parts of the IDF."
