rpdrcirclejerk,3e5hxl,pevans05,4,Wed Jul 22 03:01:57 2015 UTC,Someone who is friends with both Mimi and Porkchop. He wanted people to know about this because he feels that Porkchop is being bullied. Porkchop is the one who sent him the screenshots.

This was a crowdfunded event made by a few people, not a significant Pride event, but it's been blown out of proportion by the complete trash that is PinkNews to make out this is an attack on Pride lmao.  I think the fact people are using links of Michelle calling it ""Pride Scotland"" (which isn't an organisation that exists as far as I'm aware) proves that people are reacting to headlines rather than anything that's actually happened."

Even just looking at the headline I could see that it was made for SEO (Search Engine Optimisation, or what I like to call Seriously Encouraging Outrage). Like if you were to take ""Scottish Pride bans drag queens because they 'might cause offence'"" at face value, that sounds terrible.  What actually happened was a crowdfunded group of students setting up their version of pride has said they won't pay drag queens to show up to their events but you can still show up in drag if you want. I guess that's not as sexy though."

Ginger is what is considered ""pleasantly plump"" like Santa Claus, Paul Blart: Mall Cop, and Confucius. SLM is more like Jupiter, who according to mythology is the Bringer of Jollity.

This is the bit I particularly liked:   The big deal with cultural appropriation is when the new adoption is void of the significance that it was supposed to have -- it strips the religious, historical and cultural context of something and makes it mass-marketable. That's pretty offensive. The truth is, I wouldn't be on this side of the debate if we were talking about Native American headdresses, or tattoos of Polynesian tribal iconography, Chinese characters or Celtic bands."

For instance, you saying ""Ginger is fat"" is really nasty, but me saying ""I don't hate Ginger, I love Ginger and that is why she needs to hear hard truths. I might get downvoted for this, but don't you think we should be mean to fat people because we love them FPH didn't die for this shit!""  The points are more or less the same, but if I invoke the potential risk to my karma people will think I'm a victim."

She has made some cool references and some intelligent jokes, but they seem to be few and far between. This is fine by me, because I enjoy her just the way she is, but I'm not gonna pretend like she is some kind of genius that only the chosen few can truly understand. I think that the start of this whole ""Katya has super intelligent humor"" stemmed from the Shakesqueer episode when one of the juidges made a comment about how he could tell from her outfit and humor that she was incredibly intelligent. Now she very well may be a very intelligent person but i believe this comment led to the ""Katya has the most intelligent humor"" CJ."
