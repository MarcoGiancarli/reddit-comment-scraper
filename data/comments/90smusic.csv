I'm still kind of new to reddit, and with the exception of a few comments here and there that I've made in other subs, it's in /r/music that I've set up ""camp.""   I'm so glad that I finally checked out reddit. /r/music,  has been kind of like a ""life line"" for me. It's a way for me to feel connected with people who love music as much as I do. I'm not exaggerating when I say I don't have anyone to listen to music with. I live in a musical waste land. For example, one of my neighbors didn't know who George Harrison was, if you can believe it.   My brother was the person I shared music with the most, and, sadly, he died this past September. I was left with all of this music and no one to share it with. It was a sad situation.  So, now I post songs here, (with the wrong flair on them) and in the various other music subs, and it's a real joy for me. I love music and it's so nice to be around people who can reference ""Phil Spector"" while kindly correcting my release date error.  So, that's my story and I'm stickin' to it."

They have me garage days re revisited in return. My cousin had a bad ass version of Slayer's Decade of Aggression that was in a embossed metal case. I had the tape version of incesticide that had liner notes about curt thrift shopping and meeting one of the artists they covered running a second hand store. When I got the cd it had no liner notes.

I'd say they aged well, the songs are still good and relevant depending on your mood/life situation. I remember how every girl my age was absolutely obsessed with the lead singer Darren Hayes (who by the way aged very well, still absolutely handsome). The song ""I want you"" is what I remember really put them out there, the video was on MTV constantly. They only made two albums from what I remember but they were both pretty fantastic.

90smusic,39zao3,ELBdelorean,2,Tue Jun 16 01:31:48 2015 UTC,"After listening to the song with the printed lyrics I have to agree that I have no idea what the hell there singing about but what a hook. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe its about the Iranian revolution?"
90smusic,39zao3,ELBdelorean,2,Tue Jun 16 02:13:27 2015 UTC,"Maybe. Honestly, they are my favorite band but I don't know what half of what their lyrics are or what they mean but ill be god damned if Murmur isn't of the best records ever I've ever heard. Have you listened to the Live at the Olympia record? I'm pretty sure Michael just printed out lyrics to some of the earlier stuff they played from the internet because he didn't even know what they were."
90smusic,39zao3,ELBdelorean,2,Tue Jun 16 02:52:34 2015 UTC,"You have described almost all songs ever written. The music and melodies connects us emotionally and the lyrics play second fiddle. Our brain connects the tone of the music with the lyrics. Lyrically ""Every breath you take by The Police"" is not a romantic song but it is. I've never heard but I will listen to Live at the Olympia tonight.   I started to listen to Olympia and its awesome."

90smusic,39itj3,atticus138,2,Fri Jun 12 00:40:30 2015 UTC,"this is such a great song. I was 10 when this song came out and I was starting to discover music. I was looking back to the 60's and 70's and discovering that music as well. Looking back now, the same amount of time has past from now until the 90's that did when I was a kid in the 90's looking back on the late 60-early 70's. My point is, is that the early 90's were a great era for music. Rightfully so, all the people who were making the good music in the 90's, were born at the golden age of music in the 60's and 70's and had parents who probably greatly influenced their taste.   Anyway, I remember when MP3's became a thing in the later 90's and finally having a computer where I could download and listen to music loudly, I downloaded this and cranked it as loud as I could just to hear the drum beat and the keyboard."

I realize that ""Solsbury Hill"" was released way before 1994, but, I find this version of the song from The Secret World Tour impossible to keep to myself. I want everyone to participate in the ""Skipping Song.""  Peter Gabriel is at his finest during this tour.   I hope you are as uplifted as I am when I watch them perform this gift of a song."

Have listened through it in its entirety once and really liked it; this song in particular is the main one that's jumped out at me so far. (It's like the best chill-90s-alternative-song I've heard since ""Josey"" by Deep Blue Something.) So I only just discovered this one album by them - but I quite liked it!, and am excited to get to know more off of it and possibly by them in general."

All songs should be HQ (480p - HD). 1993 was an interesting year in music.  Soul and R&B was really hot, but plenty of alt-rock, pop-rock and rap appeared also. Some hits from 1993 aren't here because I do not like them (that much).  At some point, I may put something similar for alt-rock singles of the year. Enjoy.

90smusic,36jdw7,erythrocytes64,1 point,Wed May 20 08:06:24 2015 UTC,"I can hear the similarity as well. Good point. MBV is one of those bands tthat I have a feeling I will like, and certainly like a handful of the songs of theirs that I know, but I just can never seem to get into them. Not that I have necessarily ever purposefully tried. It seems that a lot of their stuff I tend to dismiss as a ""wall of guitar noise"" and get bored with it quickly. Mind you, that description is a huge simplification on my part, and I have only heard a small fraction of their catalog.  Are you a big fan of theirs? What would you suggest from them?"
90smusic,36jdw7,erythrocytes64,1 point,Wed May 20 20:23:23 2015 UTC,"I used to be a big fan of exactly ""wall of guitar noise"" type of stuff, so I got into them quickly. To be honest, IMO they are kind of critics' darlings, but not really all that great.  However, personally I think they have some amazing songs, which are just unforgettable and unlike anything you've heard before. These are: ""Off My Face"" ""Don't Ask Why"", ""Swallow"", ""Only Shallow"", ""Sometimes"". They have melody which is very good on its own. If you like any of them, you might want to listen their most famous record, Loveless.  In any way, they all sound kinda the same. Their music is mainly characterized by creating the feeling of disorienting distorted noise contrasting with heavenly vocals. That can be interesting, but all those noise bands like Sonic Youth really are like modern art – they are sometimes interesting but are really weird and I just don't understand them."

90smusic,32vztf,stuaaart,2,Fri Apr 17 04:14:04 2015 UTC,This song is so beautiful.
90smusic,32w0d2,stuaaart,4,Fri Apr 17 04:19:16 2015 UTC,Radio 92.9 is more of an alternative station in the Boston area but it plays a bunch of good 90's stuff
90smusic,32w0d2,FCOS,2,Fri Apr 17 17:04:45 2015 UTC,More often than not 92.9 absolutely kills it
90smusic,32w0d2,Delune_von_Bek,2,Fri Apr 17 17:41:32 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I usually listen to Pandora.  I put the 90's songs in and go along for the ride :)"
90smusic,32w0d2,ameyama,2,Fri Apr 17 14:00:41 2015 UTC,I listen to Absolute 90s in the UK - http://absoluteradio.co.uk/90s/ I hope it works wherever you are!
90smusic,32vjin,stuaaart,2,Fri Apr 17 01:44:29 2015 UTC,Garbage were a cracking band.

90smusic,32tk3l,original_greaser_bob,1 point,Thu Apr 16 16:30:48 2015 UTC,Nobody ever remembers this song when I bring it up.
90smusic,32tk3l,antagon1st,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:38:17 2015 UTC,i remember Nelly name checked it in Country Grammer.
90smusic,32os8h,stuaaart,3,Wed Apr 15 14:32:53 2015 UTC,I used to hate this song so much. Somehow I knew all the words.
90smusic,32os8h,VadersVariousCapes,2,Wed Apr 15 19:12:50 2015 UTC,boogie.

90smusic,32k93z,spoonerwilkins,0,Tue Apr 14 13:48:56 2015 UTC,"A note on this song.  The original is pretty far from a 90's song as it was written 1969 and first sung by The Maytals.  This version, on the other hand, stands on its own in my ears and came a knocking 1996 so here it is:)"

90smusic,32ekh9,RFeldhake,4,Mon Apr 13 03:40:45 2015 UTC,How has this not been posted before?  Embarrassment?
90smusic,32ekh9,ChickenDinero,3,Mon Apr 13 03:41:03 2015 UTC,"I will upvote this even if it did come out in 1999... Because I freaking love this song, no regrets. How could I forget it's 90s music?!"
90smusic,32ekh9,stuaaart,1 point,Mon Apr 13 05:16:02 2015 UTC,I was so in love with Britney. Take me back to 1998! (●ʘ̅ㅈʘ̅●)

90smusic,32au4q,nomoreanxietyy,2,Sun Apr 12 04:32:58 2015 UTC,that whole album was great
90smusic,32a8ia,L3aBoB3a,1 point,Sun Apr 12 00:18:13 2015 UTC,when this song came out i remember reading an article where songwriter said the BB King sample used on this took up an ENTIRE 3.5 inch floppy.
90smusic,32a8ia,original_greaser_bob,2,Wed Apr 15 16:25:35 2015 UTC,"Haha good ol floppy disks. Is it just me or were they way more durable and compact than ""compact discs""?"
90smusic,32a8ia,original_greaser_bob,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:29:51 2015 UTC,one of the first Macs i remember that had a cd drive you had to put the disc in a hard plastic case that looked like an oversized diskette case before you could put it in the computer.
90smusic,329qwz,skippy,2,Sat Apr 11 21:37:22 2015 UTC,I was born the same year this song came out. They play this on the radio from time to time.
90smusic,329qwz,nomoreanxietyy,1 point,Sun Apr 12 02:50:54 2015 UTC,"Not quite as good as this remix, but pretty close!"
90smusic,32a1bf,msphere2,2,Sat Apr 11 23:10:52 2015 UTC,One of my favorite SOAD songs.
90smusic,32a1bf,pope_ruggles,2,Sat Apr 11 23:11:14 2015 UTC,"This was the first unedited album I bought, it launched a new phase of my young life."

90smusic,3261my,screamingacorn22,2,Fri Apr 10 21:48:58 2015 UTC,Theres a video around with only the bassline and its one of the best things I've ever heard.
90smusic,3261my,Enchilada_McMustang,1 point,Fri Apr 10 21:55:18 2015 UTC,I will have to check that out!
90smusic,321xwm,rpilek,2,Thu Apr 9 22:41:05 2015 UTC,holy sheeit... i just barely remember this song and video... i regret i have but one up vote to give for this post...
90smusic,321xwm,original_greaser_bob,2,Fri Apr 10 19:39:03 2015 UTC,Five days late but thanks for that great comment.
90smusic,31zvrp,dreinn,3,Thu Apr 9 13:37:10 2015 UTC,Good question...Awesome song. Still my fave off the album (one of my first CD's as a young whipper snapper in HS!) Sorry I can't help you but thanks for the trip down memory lane!
90smusic,31zvrp,peachy708,2,Thu Apr 9 14:56:44 2015 UTC,I think it's from Boystown
90smusic,31zvrp,iaro,2,Thu Apr 9 17:40:59 2015 UTC,"You gave me hope! And then it was dashed. If you were referring to the 1939 Spencer Tracy movie, ""Boys Town,"" I just found the script and the quote does not appear, nor anything like it. Thanks for the tip, though!"
90smusic,31ktr2,rpilek,3,Mon Apr 6 01:10:00 2015 UTC,One of the most underrated bands of the 80s/90s
90smusic,31ktr2,decorama,2,Mon Apr 6 03:42:09 2015 UTC,Interesting sound that never received much recognition
90smusic,31jels,paul671,1 point,Sun Apr 5 17:49:12 2015 UTC,wow i had no idea about the title / artist of this song

90smusic,30zems,erythrocytes64,1 point,Tue Mar 31 22:51:12 2015 UTC,"Technically, the song was written in 1989. But I think it probably hasn't appeared in Cisco products until the '90s."
