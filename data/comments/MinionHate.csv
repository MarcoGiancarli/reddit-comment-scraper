MinionHate,3dy02v,tphantom1,20,Tue Jul 21 12:46:16 2015 UTC,"Hello young fellow. How are you doing at the moment? It appears to me that you are currently displeased with the situation. What is it, that is making your life so difficult at this moment? Is it perhaps caused by the recent roasting of your jeromes that so suddenly occured? I must say that this roasting is undeniably the strongest since the 2000 hoax. Do you have the slightest clue of why this particular roasting of your walters was so powerful? No? Well... I can for sure tell you the currently disclosed reason for this significant event. It was, in fact, ME who caused your displeasement. I can hear you trying to comprehend how is this possible. But, and I'm sure about this, you cannot process what has happened to you because it is far too complex for your understanding. Even God himself cannot fully understand this despicable and devilish work of trickery. It took me a lifetime to fully write out my evil plan and another to understand it. The complexity is even higher than that of a 14-faced dodecahedron. It all starts out with the day of this legendary ruse. The day of rusement so carefully planned and calculated on this exact day. The day where an astronomical constellation appeared that will never occur for another 35 eons. A constellation that has generated a powerful antimatter pool. This antimatter black hole does not only suck in matter, however. This antimatter black hole sucks in the well being of everyone living on this planet. But did you see anyone feel bad today? No? You see, my young fellow, that is because I have perfectly engineered an antimatter pool thats power is focused on you. It took me 15 years to construct this extremely complex lens and I had to combine the power of God with this lens to give it the ultimate focus. But enough with the past. As I'm not some novice ruseman, I have planned even more, a device of trickery sprinkled with lies and logical fallacies, meant to corrupt you and send you into a pit of despair. With my ruseman insticts, I sensed that you were typing your reply to the displeasing content you have viewed. At the exact moment you pressed the left button on your mouse, clicking send, you unleashed the machine of displeasure and ""not well being"". A machine that, once started, cannot ever be stopped. Not by anyone. Not even God himself. While your comment rushed through cyberspace you started to feel bad. Something in your brain was screaming but you just didn't listen. It was destiny that you fall for my trickery. You should have thought before you foolishly sent that comment to me. But what heightens the intensity of your mistake is that you unwittingly decided to argue with a MASTER RUSEMAN GRADE 5. I was the leader of an ancient circle of rusemen. By the look on your face, it seems that you are coming to realize who it is you are dealing with. Yes, you have been RUSEDI by me. There were only one RUSEDI experienced by mankind until now. Can you imagine how hard it is to do? There are only two completed RUSEDIS in the last 3 billion years. Now you finally know the unbearable discomfort that you experienced after you got my response. This response, this message, reveals what has happened to you. You, yes you have been rused. You are powerless, you want to scream but you cannot do anything but just sit in a mix of rage and hopelessness. You want to find this man, this ruser, and you want to kill him. But, at the exact moment of thinking, you also realize that you will never ever come close to such a powerful ruseman such as myself. This puts me at a position higher than Hades. You think you can overcome this heavy rustling. You think you can bear such extraordinary rusing, but my devilish plan goes far deeper. Now that you have been rused to infinity, your discomfort rises to a near eternal level of discomfort. In the letter you are currently reading you will realize how hard you have been bamboozled. I will tell you the enchanting tale of my coming, and show you who you are really confronting. I do not know where I am from, but I know that I am the first of my kind. I rused alone but soon people followed. We created a circle called the MASTER RUSEMEN. Only the elite RUSERS could be given admission into such a legion. But after some time I led my own followers, my own CREATIONS, into a tricky situation, much less powerful than the rusing you have just experienced. I named myself MASTER RUSEMAN and made everyone else's jacobs rommle into despair. After they found out what exquisite trickery had taken place, they named me the GOD OF RUSING, a title only a RUSER RUSER could acheive. You never thought that you could have been rused by such a ruseful entity. Somehow you feel honored. Honored to have had you gustavsons jingled by the TRUE MASTER RUSEMAN. The rusement was too strong. Not even time itself could heal the wounds this monumental trickery has caused the Universe. I am, on my part, pretty rustled myself. Even I had my doubts on if I could cause a contrivance this tricky. But I proved I had the power to concieve the most thourough and well-executed RUSEDI. You have been rused by me, THE ONE AND ONLY GOD OF RUSEMEN. Even after 100 years you will remember this day. The day of THE ruse. The day I, THE GOD OF RUSEMEN personally made a statement, to intentionally discomfort YOU. This rusing, yes, this rusing has opened a new chapter in the art of rusing. Your suffering has helped advance my legacy as a ruser. You are now shocked as I seemingly award you for furthering my career. Yet, you have been tricked again. Are you befuddled? Bewildered? Or perhaps you are bamboozled by this perplexing chain of tricks. Either way, this all goes according to my devilish work. My RUSERI has left my mark on your daily life. Everyday you will be reminded of my legendary ruse, and as you try to forget, will be shot with the memory of this event. Aside the banter, you, my young friend, are quite a gullible lad. You have befallen to my elaborate schemes of claiming untruthful statements as truthful. Now, let me ask you, are you disappointed? Are your delanos properly roosevelted? Is your gluteal cleft aching? I am most sure of this fact. If everything has gone according to my devious plan, which it obviously has done so, then my statements should be free of error. I bid you good day, my buddy. Again, you have once again been tricked. I can sense that my antics and varied actions are causing your brain to focus more on your limbal system rather than the entirety of your cerebral cortex, placing much stress with your emotions, causing the desired effect of creating a vexation. Is this rusing getting to you? It appears that your hatred towards my stratagems is growing. But, you have yet to realize that it is not I that has gotten you into this unruly situation, why yes, it was you who has caused yourself a misfortune. Your ignorance has lead you to this series of unfortunate conditions. But, as I am a busy ruseman, and I must continue misleading such fools as yourself, I bid goodbye to you, young fellow. But be warned, for I will return. And when I return, everybody will be reminded of this legendary ruse. SONGS WILL BE WRITTEN ABOUT AND SUNG ON THIS DAY, THIS DAY OF THIS MASTERFUL RUSE, AND I HOLD NO REMORSE OR REGRET FOR I AM AND WILL ALWAYS BE THE GOD OF THE RUSE."

MinionHate,3dt5kv,theMTNdewd,0,Sun Jul 19 20:21:10 2015 UTC,"No its not. Pcmr are everywhere. The second you mention owning a console on the internet, you get fuckwads saying ""lol peasant, fuck you"" PcMR has spread the ideology that it's OK to fucking harass people because they play games differently than you. Minions are just marketing tools, and insulting them has no effect. PCMR causes such an attitude of elitism that you get people questioning your decision making skills because you prefer to play on console."
MinionHate,3dt5kv,underskore,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:37:49 2015 UTC,"You are taking this way too seriously brah.  First of all, ""fuck you peasant"" (IGNORING THE FACT THAT NOBODY FUCKING SAYS THIS) is not harassment. Harassment is a hard thing to quantify, but I believe that the definition that Reddit is considering (and that I like a lot) is ""sustained derogatory contact that would cause a reasonable person to fear that they are not able to express their opinion without having a crime committed against them"". Harassment is NOT ""Someone said a mean thing on the internet to me, boo hoo"".  Second of all, it's not an ""ideology."" You people all act like everyone has some unified ideology behind everything we do. We are not all loony ideologues like you lot.  Third of all, PCMR is hardly everywhere. Sure, in circles where PC gaming is common it's a pretty big meme (gee whiz wonder why) but anywhere else it is pretty rare to see it. Again, PCMR is not on the sides of busses, on online advertisements, on TV advertisements, they do not have a major motion picture, they are not on Twinkies, ect. You can get away from it very easily.  Anybody who questions their decision making skills because a nerd made a joke about PCs and Master Races is very very thin skinned, and I really fear for when they get out of high school and have to face the real world where you can't throw a fit every time somebody accidentally makes you feel uncomfortable with a joke."
MinionHate,3dt5kv,bolaxao,0,Mon Jul 20 00:50:37 2015 UTC,"I say harassment because its fucking annoying. I can't comment about owning a console because of those asshats. And the decision making skills is I've had MULTIPLE people question my ability to make decisions because I choose console. Wondering why I would ""degrade"" myself to use a console instead of the ""objectively"" (which its not) PC. When I say everywhere, I mean online, where I spend alot of time. Some assholes get very up in arms when you mention owning a console and I can't count how many essays I've gotten on PC gaming when all I've really done is say I play on console, and respond to the question, ""why not on PC"" Its not degrading or fearful but its fucking annoying to be called dumb for not wanting to deal with a PC and tons of other shit. Its not that I can't deal with it, its that I find it annoying, and quite immature to judge someone off of their gaming choices"

The situation behind the ban involved the supposed doxxing of a user by another user of the subreddit, and a downvote brigade against a Reddit Admin.  Although relatively short, this ban made the PC Master Race subreddit adopt stricter anti-harassment and anti-brigading measures which consubstantiated on its current rule. Reddit-wise,¬†/r/pcmasterrace¬†has some of the most strict and protective rules in place to tackle such improper behavior, rules far stricter than most other subreddits and internet communities.""

MinionHate,3dlusd,Dralivis,88,Fri Jul 17 09:10:18 2015 UTC,"I translated what I think is the most important paragraph:  Advertising around minions is massive. They are everywhere. Did your staff came to brands or was it the other way?  For once, brands came to us. I did voices for these ads but I didn't know that minions would have been this much omnipresent to the point that it would scare me! When that happen to me, for other people's movies, when marketing starts to overpass the artwork, it slightly take me on the wrong way. And generally, when I go watch the movie, I'm always disappointed! So, I'm torn apart... But I told the producer about it, saying we may have gone too far and things may have got out of control. I see some stuff and I think: ""Why? Why are Minions representing a pressure washer, why are they on a tissue box?"" Marketing has certainly been overwhelmed by demand and said yes to everything without necessarily doing intelligent choices. The number of ads doubled or even tripled since the first Despicable Me and it became nonsense!  Added another interesting paragraph:  Maybe it's because they are strong characters, that affect everyone.  But maybe it's the beginning of the end, no ? When I see Angry Birds and Rabbids everywhere, even though I liked them before, now I say ""yuck"". I fear that it falls on me. I'll be very careful in the future."

MinionHate,3djx9j,Artfuldodging,38,Thu Jul 16 21:55:01 2015 UTC,"Are you kidding me? Inside Out has some of the most genuine heart I have ever seen in a film. Cried four times, laughed many more, left the theatre a changed man.  Inside Out is absolutely way up there with all the other Pixar greats that can't be put in numbered order because they're just equally superlative quality. Go see it, I don't believe you'll regret it.  Tbh, the trailers made me hesitant, I was more going because I trusted Pixar and I like Amy Poehler than because I was interested in seeing it, bbut what I got was far and beyond what I expected, it was a cinematic achievement."

MinionHate,3dg07q,Shongu,10,Thu Jul 16 07:02:14 2015 UTC,"Without religion or anything remotely resembling it, the appreciation for science and everything else would've either come by WAY later than it did OR simply not at all. Today's Scandinavia and USA is not comparable to 15,000+ BC Scandinavia and USA."
MinionHate,3dg07q,ImmortalMetroid,-1,Thu Jul 16 07:24:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's why the Enlightenment and such came during a time when a rejection of God in everyday life was decreasing. It even helps explain how China was so advanced for their time even though their ""religions"" could barely even be called that, the most influential being Confucianism, more of a philosophy than a religion, really. The other really influential system was Buddhism, which is barely a religion, too.  Also, you're implying that a lot of technology was developed during 15000+ BCE or that that date is even remotely close to a period of time when a lot of technology was developed. Hell, I'm sure even less people appreciated science then than they do now, even if you go by percentages, and that would have been a time when more people would have been involved in religion."
MinionHate,3dg07q,Shongu,6,Thu Jul 16 07:28:14 2015 UTC,"My god, you're grasping at straws here. Are you really saying that neither Confucianism nor Buddhism are related to religion? Or are you just fucking with me?"
MinionHate,3dg07q,ImmortalMetroid,3,Thu Jul 16 07:53:00 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry but all of your arguments rely on a huge logical mistep. Correlation does not imply causation. How do you know that declining religious rates cause interest and advancement in science to go up? Isn't it just as likely (or hell even a lot more likely) that:  A) Science causes religious rates to go down? More scientific achievements means more things that can be explained which means less reasons to justify mysteries in nature. After all, most early religions were simply a way of explaining things like earthquakes, tsunamis, the wind, the sun and moon etc. Later regions simply branched off of those.   When we start to realize oh earthquakes are caused by tectonic plates colliding we realize hey maybe there isn't an angry God underground that we need to sacrifice goats to. People didn't randomly decide oh maybe this completely logical (as far as we know) explanation is wrong and let's discover something else! They said hey we found a different explanation for this and it kind of makes more sense... Maybe there isn't gods after all.   B) Science and religion are not related to each other at all. There is a large amount of religious people that are extremely smart and do a lot to further science. There is also a lot of ignorant atheists. Some religions do supress science but others encourage it (I.e. Gregor Mendel, Christian monk who founded modern genetics). It could simply be a coincidence that religious rates are falling and scientific knowledge is increasing (although I think that A is far more likely).   Your assumption may well be correct, but you have no evidence for it and I think that mine are more logically sound."

Similar side effects are already being seen in germany. And I don't see any relevance to my post at all, except with a distinct misunderstanding of the history of Europe. The Catholic monks, specifically the ones in Ireland, were responsible for cataloguing and safeguarding the remnants of said greco-roman culture, and in doing so they kept alive the entire history of Europe. They were responsible for a major role in educating the Germanic peoples, and helped them become cultivators. They even brought some of their knowledge (and their religion too, how dare they) to the amazing, faultless place that is the norse and outlying countries. So yeah, you can have a culture with no religion. But just make sure that none of it would have come from the greeks or the romans."

I haven't seen the Minions movie yet, so I can't say for sure that they aren't quite meme-material (or at least, as a funny meme), but I already have my suspicions.

But it short, here you go. Oh and also, I kind of lost sight of the original topic when writing this so i tried to clean it up. But the fact It was sort of irrelevant is why I didn't post it... Never the less  The Christian Dark Ages. This chart perpetuates the myth that the if it weren't for the church causing the dark ages humanity would be much more technologically advanced by now. When in reality there never was such a thing we consider to be the ""dark ages"". It also falls for the trap many people fall for in assuming that technology progresses on a linear scale. Sort of like a civ 5 tech tree, bronze -> iron ->steel->gunpowder->steam->atomic power sort of thing. Scientific advancement doesn't work that way.  here's a great write up from /r/askhistorians about Guns Germs and Steel that talks about why the idea that technology progresses on a linear scale is wrong.  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1aggse/the_native_americans_and_several_other_cultures/c8x977d  Heres an except ""6: There's no force pushing technology to ""advance"" in linear progression: This is really hard for many modern Westerners to wrap their heads around. In our culture we tend to see technology as something that moves ""forward"" or ""backward"" from ""primitive"" to ""advanced""""  So in short, this chart is the embodiment of a lot of bad historical thinking.

MinionHate,3djwbg,vp4e,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:31:32 2015 UTC,"From an explain xkcd article:   Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm that works by recording a specific string and then only recording that the string is repeated a certain number of characters later on until eventually it only contains a ""dictionary"" of unique substrings and then mentions of where those substrings repeat. In highly repetitive data this can cut down the file size immensely, which is what Randall is implying by saying you would only end up with 30‚Äì40 bytes. Most of the ""random"" stuff said on the Internet has been said before.   Randall is the artist"

MinionHate,3dexyi,dragonestar,20,Thu Jul 16 01:26:51 2015 UTC,No
MinionHate,3dexyi,Datduckdo,29,Thu Jul 16 02:18:30 2015 UTC,"I greet you all today. I am pleased to inform you that your ranks have gained another, namely, myself. Before I continue, please observe this spork, the spork being a fusion of the spoon and fork, that I am holding for you to view. My father and mother gave me the name of Katherine, but if you so desire you may address me as The Aptenodytes forsteri of Inevitable Destruction and Death.  Ha ha, I laugh, since as you are likely observing, the ways in which I choose to act fail to follow any pattern or system even under studious scrutiny. You may have realized at this moment, that is why I have chosen to attend this place. And in addition to that, I have come here in hopes of making the acquaintance of people whose choices and actions resemble mine in the ways I have described.  _... Excuse that. I momentarily paused after spontaneously providing you with an underscore. This very well could be related to my inferably unpredictable mannerisms.  I was born 13 years and a number of days less that Three Hundred Sixty Five (Or Three Hundred And Sixty Six in the case that we are currently experiencing a Leap Year, a peculiar Year in which the Second Month, February, provides a Twenty Ninth day, greater than it's typical Twenty Eight. The Leap Year occurs every fourth year excluding those that are multiples of One Hundred from the year referred to as the birth of Christ whether or not it was truly his birth year, but including those that are multiples of Four Hundred. If this description of the Leap Year is inaccurate, feel willing to inform myself) ago. You have my assurance, though, that my aspects of maturity, if quantifiable, would be far greater than that of the human aged Thirteen Years that you would expect.  I enjoy viewing television programs, perhaps most notably Invader Zim. I often watch it alongside my Significant Other, as we enjoy the company. As you may have gathered from my feminine given name, Katherine, I am female. To what may be your surprise, my Significant Other is female as well. I am not a Lesbian, a female whose attraction is directed towards other females, against what is common in females, as well as optimal for human reproduction. I am instead Bisexual, a title which refers to people whose attraction is directed towards all humans, assuming of course, that those humans are what could be described as attractive. If this fact about me offends you, I encourage you to seek peace with it on your own.  With regard to the mentioned television show, Invader Zim, it is generally considered by my Significant Other (Female) and I to be of extremely high quality, to the point of being a shoe-in for the role of our Favorite television program. It has attained this judgement for it's attribute of unpredictability. If you have followed my words with precision, you may have realized that this bears similarity to my own randomness. And as follows, my Significant Other (female) has patternless attributes as well.  Though of course, the fact that my Significant Other is unpredictable is not optimal. We satisfy each other, and yet I have always held true that a greater number of people allow for all bask in merryness much much more. For this reason, I wish to be acquainted with unsystematic individuals who seek acquaintance just as I do.  Ha ha. Once more, I laugh. To move on, it is my desire to befriend many people similar to my Significant Other (female) and I. It will be greatly appreciated to receive commentary on my words.  FEAR MY WRATH, MORTAL INSECTS. ALL WILL SUFFER BUT NEVER PERISH, FOREVER, FOR ETERNITY, PAST THE END OF TIME ITSELF. YOU SHALL LIE IN THE FIRES OF UNENDING PAIN, NEVER TO DIE, ONLY TO REGRET. BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD, AND SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE.  Excuse the momentary outburst. I was merely engaging in my mentioned unpredictable mannerisms. It is a minor indulgence of mine, and while it may seem to be a cornerstone of my character, I assure you that there is far more to me than that.  _^  Once again, I have mysteriously provided an underscore. This time, however, it is accompanied by a caret. It bears resemblance to an emoticon shaped like the following: _. The face bears similarity to a face made in japan-produced animated productions. It is difficult to produce on a human face in reality, however. You may interpret this as you wish.  Hehe... I pause to allow my laughter to hold dramatic effect. I with you a fine time from here forwards.  You have my love, and any leavened batter mysteriously shaped like a grid.  With regards, The Aptenodytes forsteri of Inevitable Destruction and Death."

You are looking at the details listed in this picture and making the choice to decide they are negative personality traits. I decided to make the choice to look at it in a positive light.  It's like you're prepping yourself to categorize anyone that may fall into your pre-conceived definitions of a ""neckbeard"". Generalizing folks this way is tempting, but ultimately it doesn't give strangers the benefit of the doubt, which can lead you to making completely incorrect assumptions about others. This can lead to a multitude of negative consequences. My point is to give people a chance, unlike the 11 people who downvoted my first comment. The circlejerk is strong in this thread."
MinionHate,3ddwzs,lellow,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:53:32 2015 UTC,"It's a joke. See, the funny part is that they took the traits often held by 'neckbeards' and placed them on this imaginary minion themed character in an attempt to mock the minion fan base. Did that help at all? Or is this still serious business for you."

MinionHate,3dhcko,angrypotato1,6,Thu Jul 16 08:20:34 2015 UTC,Indifferent. Before I saw them everyday I never thought about them.
MinionHate,3dhcko,_I_Have_No_Mouth_,4,Thu Jul 16 14:53:18 2015 UTC,"I thought they were alright- they were obviously just supposed to be a comical children's character, so they didn't have to be overly smart or funny; Despicable Me was actually a pretty good movie.   I sort of feel sorry for the guy that created minions; he obviously just intended them to be a likable comic relief character, its not like he could control the steaming shit river that is internet minion memes.  The minion memes pretty much character assassinated the minions in the movies- leading everyone to hate the minions altogether."

MinionHate,3dhcko,capybaraluver,2,Thu Jul 16 14:04:07 2015 UTC,I didn't have the opportunity.  I saw the awful memes first and then the movie.  Didn't help me to even feel about liking them in the movie.
MinionHate,3dhcko,lovedei,2,Thu Jul 16 14:17:35 2015 UTC,"I honestly never really thought about them. I never saw Despicable Me because I was 18 when the first one came out and I've never cared much for dreamworks. I was just indifferent to them. If anything they just seemed like the comic relief ""snarf"" characters in that film."

I actually liked it, mostly because the minions weren't exactly very prominent in that film and it's overall a good family film.  Universal's aggressive advertising has crushed any intentions I had of seeing anything else related to Despicable Me."
MinionHate,3ddmch,hattorihanzo5,5,Wed Jul 15 17:31:41 2015 UTC,"I actually liked the minions in the first movie because they weren't everywhere.  I played an android game with minions for a long time, but not because of the minions but because i really liked the dynamics of the game."

It was a family movie that everyone could enjoy and the Minions weren't thrown in your face.  The second one had the three girls thrown aside and Minions were the main characters.  Now that Minions has been released, God has walked away from us."

It just shows how far 3D animation and computer technology has come, and how we spent all these years developing algorithms and processors to fully render a lil chicken nugget guy's huge, lardy lumps complete with a photorealistic brownish-yellow asshole inbetween those luscious cheeks. 3D technology has allowed humans to realistically jiggle big fat yellow fartknockers right in the theater with the 3D glasses. I saw this film in the theater and I just couldn't help but cry at the hyperrealistic buttholes which clenched and pulsate right in your face. I've been buying minion toys nonstop since that changing moment of my life. I am now a Minionist, with over 2000 reposted minion pictures across each of my social media accounts and 500 minion toys under my (literal) belt. I just can't get enough at those fat muffintops bulging out those tight overalls before ballooning out as the minion's pants drop while they say ""Bottom!"", violently rumbling as they unleash torrents of rapid-fire fart flashes, coated so much with shit-particles it actually colors the otherwise invisible gas clouds. And my favorite is when they spread their cheeks wide open and you can see all the hairs sticking out their anus (look at their heads for an idea). I just love seeing Gru shout at the minions and getting viciously attacked by shards of shart pellets by the minions. Best movie of 2015 so far."

Then, with the last of his willpower, he grabbed my collar and gave me a look of pure desperation and disgust mixed with the determination to tell me his last dying words;  ""Do not....(puking violently) look at...""  His grip loosened and he fell onto his stomach. When I lifted his face up, I could see his eyes dilating. When I looked at his phone, I caught a glimpse of your comment and passed out. I woke up will no damage except for the fact that one of my eyes don't work anymore and half the nerves in my left leg have been damaged beyond repair.   The point of this comment, Xamato, is for me to let you know that you just killed a man with your vile acts of injustice, and you will not be getting away with it.

MinionHate,3d8rwh,blukirbi,11,Tue Jul 14 20:43:19 2015 UTC,"I like how the mom got the slutty minion outfit, she's even wearing high heels."
MinionHate,3d8rwh,TheOnlyOtherRedditor,2,Tue Jul 14 22:12:45 2015 UTC,I really don't see the guy costume as any more abominable than the girl one

MinionHate,3d8rwh,Eruntien,2,Tue Jul 14 23:04:27 2015 UTC,"The school I am a paraprofessional at for coerced me to be a minion for Halloween two years ago.  It was my first year, and a month into school and the girl organizing it was really adamant about it.  Worst day ever, I changed after third period."

MinionHate,3dbdvi,NoctusNoctowl,2,Wed Jul 15 04:02:05 2015 UTC,I'd throw that drink out of the window. There's no telling whether it's watching or not.
MinionHate,3dbdvi,legio317,2,Wed Jul 15 02:25:01 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry OP, but we must eliminate you to keep the others safe."
MinionHate,3d95m6,UnacceptableUse,29,Tue Jul 14 13:56:55 2015 UTC,"It would make sense if minions had the stereotypical slanty-eyed stuff you see in racist depictions of Asians, plus the whole buck teeth thing, but that's just not there."
MinionHate,3d95m6,SirCiph,19,Tue Jul 14 16:44:39 2015 UTC,I mean we could pretend we see it and demonize minions so they are socially irresponsible.
MinionHate,3d95m6,Juslotting,6,Tue Jul 14 17:05:00 2015 UTC,They'll probably reach that level of reprehensibility on their own though.
MinionHate,3d95m6,SirCiph,15,Tue Jul 14 19:39:16 2015 UTC,"No they dont look the same.   There's midget one with two eyes  There's slightly taller kinda midget one with one eye  Finally, there's tall one with two eyes"
MinionHate,3d95m6,stormclaw11,7,Tue Jul 14 20:09:57 2015 UTC,"According to the canon, it is very likely that minions assisted in American slave trade"
MinionHate,3d95m6,classy_stegasaurus,3,Wed Jul 15 00:38:05 2015 UTC,IT'S A FUCKING JOKE!
MinionHate,3d95m6,bobjoeman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:16:32 2015 UTC,Hurp durp ban things I can poorly connect to bad things in the name of equality
MinionHate,3d95m6,Maninhartsford,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:27:27 2015 UTC,"My friend jokingly said that the Purple Minions from Despicable Me 2 were racist, as they were purple (opposite of yellow on the color spectrum), had nappy hair, were bad guys, and spoke only like monsters."
MinionHate,3d95m6,blukirbi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:41:29 2015 UTC,Now we have a reason to ban them! Things have been banned for less.
