Vocaloid,3e49tv,bauran,2,Tue Jul 21 23:11:18 2015 UTC,"Haha that's a nice goal. I wish other vocaloid saw as much figure love as miku gets...   I actually sent in a request for a Yuzuki Yukari nendoroid to GSC but I doubt that will really do much haha. Really hoping for another Yukari scale figure, maybe they will do one of her V4 art crosses fingers. Also another IA figure would be amazing because I'm personally not a fan of the pose in that figure (it looks like a really nice figure still).  At least there is that Teto nendoroid announced which will be amazing and opens the door to more possibilities on that front."

Vocaloid,3e2ck2,rprebel,4,Tue Jul 21 16:10:57 2015 UTC,"This.  The emphasis has been on female vocaloids, and a decent selection of male vocaloids is needed as well.   As for range, low baritone sounds good, even if it doesn't reach up to medium-high tenor. We already have a decent selection of higher pitch vocaloids, so something in the lower ranges would be nice (even if it doesn't go all the way into bass range)"

YuchaP's entire mylist has 4 songs that are even remotely like it. Here are the YT links:  Thief Night Trick  Immoral Actress  Risk Dice  Blackjack  nyanyannya next, best match to your tune, I think, starting to forget what it sounded like. nya has no youtube account, or at least not one that's known. This isn't a complete list of his/her work, but I'm pretty sure it's all the jazz in there.  Doctor = Funk Beat  Fräulein＝Biblioteca  Club = Majesty  Empress = Disco  Hahahahaha, Oster used to be named shemaleP apparently. Guess she needed an image change once she got more popular. She has a huge mylist on nicodou that dwarfs her YT page's display; I didn't sift through them all but I think I got all the jazz numbers. If you want more I suggest looking at her nico mylist instead of YT.  Moonlit Night and Black Cats  Gossip this one's not even vocaloid wth lol  PIANO*GIRL  on the rocks"

I do not have spotify and I feel that directly paying this guy $5 (or however much it would cost) would be much more beneficial him than whatever meager sum spotify pays out in streams. (which seems to be less than a cent per play).  2)Let your blog speak for itself.  3)Add as many artist links as you can for future articles, as of now you make your audience do research. I don't mind taking an extra 5 minutes to find this guy's Twitter, or Beautiful lie's VocaDB page but a lot of people won't want to bother. You should provide these links to make your audience's lives more easier."

The definition of ""noncommercial"" for CC has been known to be kind of contentious, with extremes such as not being allowed on YouTube because YouTube collects ad revenue.  Before Crypton adopted CC, they had two licenses available---the Piapro Character License when you are not generating any revenue, and Piapro Link for when you are generating revenue even if it's breaking event/nonprofit/noncommerical.  1st PLACE, meanwhile, has a slightly more generous license where there's no restrictions with noncommercial use and very few restrictions for using the character commercially when decorating a CD.  Basically, to be fully in the clear, you have to abide by those guidelines, and for that to happen with gray-area stuff like the whole ""noncommercial"" phrase, you'd probably have to hire a lawyer to be 100% sure.  That said, people break these rules all the time, especially outside of Japan, where enforcement would be expensive, anyway.  Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, but I have read and/or signed many contracts w.r.t. intellectual property in both Japanese and English."
Vocaloid,3dj74a,hightrancesea,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:04:11 2015 UTC,"There is nothing you can classify as derivative work in that sample. A derivative work would be if you used Crypton's official cover image or part of it to create a new work.  The CC-BY-NC is refering to 1 specific image  - Crypton's official design by Kei used on the packaging of Hatsune Miku. CC-BY-NC by no means applies to the character itself. It applies to that specific image (or maybe other specific images by Crypton). If I draw Miku then that's my ""intellectual property"" (retarded term) and I can do whatever I want with it including sell it.  tl;dr: You can't print the official design and sell it.  The only potential issue could come up with the trademark. No one will hunt you though for printing the words Hatsune Miku together with art that clearly suggests Crypton's product. They might if it in any way negatively affects their public image. But since that's not the case, your work is just another form of promotion."
Vocaloid,3dj74a,skyeondope,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:16:48 2015 UTC,"To the best of my understanding, the actual designs in the given sample are derivative works based on adapting the original character designs (e.g. using Miku's hair ornaments and twintails).  To quote the WIPO:   In copyright law, the term “derivative works” refers to the translations, adaptations, arrangements and similar alterations of preexisting works which are protected under Article 2(3) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1971) as such without prejudice to the copyright in the preexisting works.   By redrawing part of the character, especially one that is effectively a distinguishing characteristic of the character, it would be an arrangement or similar alteration of the original art.  By your wording of ""used Crypton's official cover image or part of it"", I can only deduce that you meant it's only infringing if you are literally copying-and-pasting the images and/or pieces thereof.  That is not the case, because if it were, then there would've been no point to Crypton issuing the CC license or the PCL because no one would need to directly use the illustration itself or pieces of it---just get someone to draw some fan art.  In general, fully developed characters (insert joke about Miku not having a fully developed chest) (i.e. a character who had more than just a name in the original work) are protected by copyright law.  Tom Clancy got in legal trouble with his first publisher, because he assigned all copyright for The Hunt for Red October to that publisher; thus when he wanted to use the protagonist in a subsequent novel with a different publisher, they had to reach a legal settlement before continuing.  Thus, if this CC-BY-NC license does not effectively give you permission to use the character Hatsune Miku, then you'll be infringing if you use her character without additional permission from Crypton.    You do bring up a good point, though; it appears that rights regarding the name of the character seems to feature a lot more prominently in the Japanese character licenses.  For example, the Piapro Character License gives permission for the user to use the character's name or part thereof (assuming the user isn't violating any other parts of the license):   自ら作成した当社キャラクターの二次創作物のタイトル、説明文等に当社キャラクターの名称の全部または一部または愛称を使用し、または当該二次創作物に当社キャラクターの名称の一部を用いた独自の名称を付与すること。 In the title or description of a derivative work based on our company's characters, you are allowed to use all or part of the character's name as well as new names based on part of the character's name.   The license for IA also applies to the name as well, as can be seen in the preamble:   1st PLACE株式会社が発売元であるVOCALOID™3 Library[ IA -ARIA ON THE PLANETES- ]を 使用し作成した音声データ、及びキャラクター・名称(「IA」もしくは「イア」) 等（以下、本キャラクター）の利用に関するルールです。 These are guidelines regarding the use of audio data created using the VOCALOID3 Library IA -ARIA ON THE PLANETES-, published by 1st PLACE Co., Ltd. as well as the usage of the character, character name (IA or イア), etc. (hereinafter referred to as ""the character"")   Same with INTERNET's guidelines:   「本キャラクター」とは、バーチャルボーカリスト『がくっぽいど』、『Megpoid』、『Lily』、『CUL』、『kokone』、『Chika』並びに当社ウェブページ、カタログ、ポスターなどの販売促進物で使用されている一切の画像、キャラクターデザイン、キャラクター名称「神威がくぽ」、「GUMI」、「Lily」、「CUL」、「kokone」、「Chika」をいいます。 ""The characters"" is taken to mean the virtual vocalists ""がくっぽいど"", ""Megpoid"", ""Lily"", ""CUL"", ""kokone"", ""Chika"" as well as all illustrations used in the promotion thereof (including but not limited to the company's webpage, catalogs and posters), the character designs and the names of the characters (""神威がくぽ"", ""GUMI"", ""Lily"", ""CUL"", ""kokone"", ""Chika"").   tl;dr: characters are covered by copyright; you're even more screwed if the CC license doesn't give you permission to use the character; Japanese EULAs mention permission to use the names in addition to the art/design"
Vocaloid,3dj74a,hightrancesea,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:35:50 2015 UTC,no one would need to directly use the illustration itself or pieces of it   Of course you'd want to use the official illustration. The most obvious case would be using it to accompany an article about Vocaloid in a mag or something.  I believe your outlook on what is a derivative work is way to restrictive. I would never consider the Miku cosplay from Lucky Star OVA to be infringing in any way. Are you American? Cause I can see some of your logic applying there. It's rediculus what shit goes through courts there. Like the Apple patent on round corners on mobiles.  Well whatever I don't plan to argue about something that can go either way in court. The question is whether OP can get into trouble selling his prints and the answer to that is simply no. Nothing will happen even if he sells a lot. Just keep a positive image of the original and maybe link to Crypton and there is nothing to fear because common sense.
Vocaloid,3dj74a,skyeondope,2,Sat Jul 18 16:43:51 2015 UTC,"Of course you'd want to use the official illustration. The most obvious case would be using it to accompany an article about Vocaloid in a mag or something.   A professional magazine would seek to obtain permission directly from the company to use the image, anyway.  For press use, some companies do put up images that can be freely used for that purpose (see AH-Soft) and press releases also come with images that can be used.   I believe your outlook on what is a derivative work is way to restrictive. I would never consider the Miku cosplay from Lucky Star OVA to be infringing in any way. Are you American? Cause I can see some of your logic applying there. It's rediculus what shit goes through courts there. Like the Apple patent on round corners on mobiles.   I'm sure we can all find strange outliers with any legal system.  While the American legal system can be tortuous sometimes, hence making for verbose contracts, that is not the basis for my line of reasoning; I base my reasoning on the wording of contracts and the law as well as the years of experience I have had with derivative works and copyright, from making derivative works myself to laying out contracts regarding assignment of copyright with Japanese business partners.  As for Lucky Star, they got permission from Crypton as well as some other companies whose material they used.  All the ""real"" eroge that showed up in OreImo were also attributed in the credits as well.  It's fine that you disagree with me; in my first comment I simply offered my opinion in an attempt to give OP to the best of my ability the full picture: (1) it is technically infringing on copyright and (2) people infringe on it all the time and usually do not get sued."
Vocaloid,3dj74a,hightrancesea,2,Sun Jul 19 03:45:31 2015 UTC,"Those look really cool, let us know if/when you do sell them!"
Vocaloid,3dj74a,aznidb,2,Thu Jul 16 22:05:04 2015 UTC,"As long as you never said, ""I own these characters"", you will be fine. You should probably read up on this though, in case you go professional. But like I said, you aren't planning on selling these prints to a musuem or other businesses so you should be fine.   An issue arises once you start making a lot of money (ex. selling your prints to be distributed via a musuem/Hot Topic/etc. Since your work is doujin, you won't have these issues)."
Vocaloid,3dj74a,shslmiku,3,Thu Jul 16 19:47:25 2015 UTC,"It is a common fallacy to post messages like ""I don't own XYZ"" when trying to avoid infringement accusations.  At best, you might be defending yourself from accusations of plagiarism and/or trademark infringement, but that statement doesn't protect you from accusations of copyright infringement.  And like I said in my other reply, the crux of the matter (at least with the Crypton characters) is the definition of ""noncommercial"".  Creative Commons's website says: ""CC's NonCommercial (NC) licenses prohibit uses that are 'primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation.'""  Whether that applies to OP's plan is not 100% clear, though."
Vocaloid,3dj74a,hightrancesea,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:11:45 2015 UTC,"I think it's fine, people sell art books and posters and such of fanart of multiple characters overall (maybe contact the individual companies to double check?) I think Zunko merch would be the best to do b/c her image is basically free-er to use or something b/c she was originally done or charity or something, but I don't think Cyrpton or anyone's going to sue you or we would've heard about a lawsuit from others already."

Perhaps you can talk to a vendor (maybe welovefine would be interested) and get them to talk with Crypton/INTERNET/1st PLACE (you might be out of luck with SeeU) and then print/distribute these?  That way you don't run into legal issues, your art reaches a wider audience, both you and the vendor make money and the software companies are happy, too."

Vocaloid,3dj74a,hightrancesea,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:12:05 2015 UTC,"What I mean is an actual vendor like welovefine and not a middleman like DeviantArt.  Welovefine has held contests before for Miku-related artwork and has produced a lot of Miku T-shirts, etc., so I assume they have a line to Crypton if approval is needed.  With DeviantArt, you're kind of back to where you started, since the onus for getting permission is on you."

Vocaloid,3d4t2w,wes9523,4,Mon Jul 13 15:39:36 2015 UTC,"Before /u/jrharbort gets here to tell us how 1st Place is a terrible company for being involved with IA producers and ""forcing"" her to gain fans... Yes.  Yes we do.  Current English voice banks are certainly hit or miss, but anything that lets more people be involved with the vocaloid community is a good thing.  The only trick is helping Japanese companies see that the western fanbase is a profitable one."
Vocaloid,3d4t2w,AdvanceRatio,3,Mon Jul 13 21:57:36 2015 UTC,Did he say that during one of his stream??
Vocaloid,3d4t2w,overlordRush,3,Tue Jul 14 01:31:11 2015 UTC,"Uh.  Shit.  I meant to not post that, it sounded petty once I actually typed it out.  Frankly, I probably overreacted.  But, since its already out here:  He posted a few things on twitter after the IA concert that felt in bad faith.  First was one saying how an auto-filter on Youtube prevented him from uploading videos from IA's concert at AX, and how he wouldn't bother to get it sorted out, despite claiming permission to record and upload during the concert.  This seems petty to me, almost as if stating IA is not worth his time.  I understand that his site's primary focus is Miku, but that's just not on.  Following this, he made a post stating he didn't think much of the IA community and that her growth was forced.  This right here is what really set me off.  Miku and the Crypton Vocaloids have concerts all over the place, and Crypton is pretty damn hands on (consider the amount of Miku merch they license every year).  It's hard to see Miku Expo LA/NY as anything other than attempts at growing and solidifying the western fanbase (despite how much we all love them for it).  Consider the TV appearance (Conan?), and the press in the pit both days in LA who had no idea what was going on (I ended up near different groups on both days).  1st Place taking an active role in IA's growth shouldn't be unexpected, or frowned upon.  Fact of the matter is, no matter which company is involved, they're doing a lot (either from the shadows or outright) to push their own voice banks.  The culture surrounding Miku exists because she was the breakthrough voice bank.  For a lot of people, she is the ""first"", and a lot of weight gets attached to that.  Even so, any time I get into a group of fans, I quickly find out that while you may have fans of Miku, or Rin, or Luka, or IA, or Gumi, etc., in the end, they're actually just Vocaloid fans with a favorite character or voice bank.  This has gone on past what I intended, so I'll stop here.  tl;dr: I take issue with the way he handled IA's North American debut.  In all fairness, his opinions are his own.  But, as a relatively high profile press figure, throwing out off-hand negative comments regarding a well-liked voice bank/character kind of feels like a slap in the face to Vocaloid fans who were actually excited about the concert.  Edit: I finally got around to reading his Mikufan article, and that helps him come across a lot better.  More excited about IA, which really didn't come through in his tweets."
Vocaloid,3d4t2w,AdvanceRatio,2,Tue Jul 14 04:07:00 2015 UTC,He took my tweets out of context.
Vocaloid,3d4t2w,jrharbort,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:14:04 2015 UTC,"Um... No? I'd never say such a thing, and not sure why you'd think I would. Seems you took my twitter comments a bit out of context. I was pointing out how the growth behind IA is a lot more commercial-driven compared to Miku, where you see a lot more community drive. Simply comparing the ratio of ""popular"" songs that were heavily advertised/promoted, versus the ones that were composed by non-licensed artists. And that's just for the music side of things. It's pretty clear that Miku is much more community-driven.  That being said, IA is, and always has been since her release, my 2nd favorite Vocaloid."

Maybe Toeto? (I would think drums would be too 'loud' for something like that but you could start with something like that) Good luck"
Vocaloid,3cvxhm,KonpeitoKiss,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:40:11 2015 UTC,"I would agree that choosing slower songs would be a good starting point for a beginner drummer. I'd argue that there are three core characteristics that determine the difficulty of learning a track.   speed technicality (odd time signatures/dynamics, etc) limb independence   If you can't keep up with the track, the other two mean nothing (you are already unable to play along). Even if you are not experienced enough to play some of the rudiments/dynamics in some tracks, you can still play along if you can keep up -- though the part wouldn't be note for note to the original. For example, I wouldn't expect that a new drummer would have the ability to play sasakure.UK's ""5 Minute Hypothesis"" note for note, but you may be able to play along with your own part. That may be very difficult due to the odd time signatures though.  But on to your question -- I think that you should check out some of 40mP's songs. They're really cool tracks, and they're generally pretty simplistic. For example, check out 'Left Behind City', 'Puppet Clown', etc."

Vocaloid,3cqb8r,Kwout,5,Fri Jul 10 03:23:01 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but since the light comes from the ionisation of air molecules, isn't its colour dependant on the air composition? The purple we see in the video and photos is consistent with nitrogen, the prime constituent of Earth's atmosphere. It's very cool tech (I had no idea plasma holograms were even a thing), but it's a far cry from being something employable in entertainment, what with the complete lack of control over the hologram's colour."

The same thing with a touchable hologram (provided they ever solve the whole retina-searing issue, ouch). Holographic computers like what we see in the Mass Effect games would no longer be fiction, either.   Image what it would be like if fans could hug her.   No shit. Can you image being a future vocaloid fan if this happens? Some 12-year old would get the thrill of a lifetime. Heh, suddenly that ""glass wall"" isn't looking like so much of a wall, anymore.

Vocaloid,3ckhqu,theLegACy99,4,Wed Jul 8 16:51:03 2015 UTC,"But there's still plenty of songs featuring the Vocaloid characters being made, it's not all gone as the post seems to imply. So I'd call it inaccurate. There's still fans of the characters around as well. It's not all about the characters anymore though, as it used to be."
Vocaloid,3ckhqu,riipah,2,Wed Jul 8 17:03:48 2015 UTC,"That's not the idea though. The idea is that the forefront of the scene has become clogged and stagnant with nothing but old content and series continuations, which makes it much harder for new content/smaller producers to break out. If you watch the latest Vocaloid rankings you'll see that the number of new songs up there is lower than ever.   Of course there's a ton of music still being made, but if people aren't seeing it through the deluge of regurgitated old content, than that's the beginning of the end. This is exactly what kills a scene. I don't think the Vocaloid scene is going to disappear anytime soon, but the number of breakout producers and new hits springing up from unestablished P's will be much lower."
Vocaloid,3ckhqu,Geminarius,2,Wed Jul 8 18:26:18 2015 UTC,"I agree with that, but the post was too absolute, implying there's hardly any of those ""Vocaloid original"" songs being made, which is simply not true."
Vocaloid,3ckhqu,riipah,4,Wed Jul 8 19:16:48 2015 UTC,This article doesn't really give any sources to their claims and just comes off as a bunch of poorly based speculation. There's still a huge number of people creating some amazing music with vocaloid software and new hits are still coming out (a lot of my favorites are very recent). Events like the IA concert just a few days ago along with miku expo show that it is still very popular expanding westward. Magical mirai 2015 is coming up as well showing another big event.   It sounded to me like this person individually lost interest and wanted to give a reason why they're no longer interested rather than an actual unbiased reasons as to all the whole aspects of vocaloid.
Vocaloid,3ckhqu,bauran,3,Wed Jul 8 17:26:20 2015 UTC,"I agree, I have to say that I haven't noticed a significant drop in the number of Vocaloid songs being made.

Weirdly, that's how I've always viewed Vocaloid since I'm never big on idolizing characters and stuff.  It's a pretty fascinating read/watch (quite long though).

Vocaloid,3cftnc,Pikmin1211,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:17:50 2015 UTC,"8 bit vocaloid     That actually sounds awesome. Do you own any vocaloids as of right now? Also, I notice the Teto flair, I think she'd work well with chiptune aswell."

Vocaloid,3cf7ab,theLegACy99,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:51:54 2015 UTC,I think the person who composed vividest might've made a demo? Or they probably got an early copy of v4 flower or something like that. Although it is weird how people haven't been talking about a demo yet

Source  As a rule of thumb, if you can't find whatever it is you want to post about mentioned on:  A) Official Miku FB Page  B) Mikufan.com  C) any mention on Vocaloid Otaku  D) Piapro blog  Then it's probably a fan project.   I've noticed that you get a lot of Vocaloid news from Tumblr. Tumblr is really really unreliable for vocaloid news since a lot of blogs tend to jump the gun in an effort to be the first to spread the news. As a rule of thumb, I would wait a few days and check the reliable sources I put in that list before trusting a post on Tumblr. (Or really any post on social media)."

Vocaloid,3bqgyw,formaliiin,2,Wed Jul 1 13:17:12 2015 UTC,I thought it's always been recycled.
Vocaloid,3bqgyw,overkillninja,2,Wed Jul 1 11:26:27 2015 UTC,No big surprise? I'm sure later in the future they will have changed it up. They really can't do the same thing forever but really it's no big surprise that they use the same performance for a few years. That stuff is really tough to produce and I think they would want to use it as much as possible.
Vocaloid,3bqgyw,chunter16,3,Wed Jul 1 12:57:25 2015 UTC,"What I meant was, this isn't a case of using the same performance (e.g: MikuPa do pretty much the same each year), this is a case of mashing together performances from various concerts over the years, without actually updating them to match one another. For instance, they included World's End Dancehall. Great, we all love Wowaka! Re-using choreography is fine, since otherwise it goes to waste. However, they didn't even replace the models - they just used the exact same performance from 2012. When you see that followed by the 2014 performance of Akatsuki Arrival, it looks a bit of a mess. It's the mash of models over the years that bugs me personally. It's my opinion though ^"
Vocaloid,3bqgyw,Tsukuruya,3,Wed Jul 1 13:02:45 2015 UTC,"I'll agree that it doesn't do much to keep people from thinking of it as a movie with a lot of spectators, though that too isn't far from the truth. I'm going to guess that it was because they were saving time between songs so they could play more of them, they'll get the pacing better with time.  They'll have a greater issue getting these transitions to work with new songs, some of the famous songs are upwards of 6 years old."
Vocaloid,3bqgyw,AMRAAM_Missiles,2,Wed Jul 1 14:07:05 2015 UTC,"I think overtime they improved the models to an extent. Remembered comparing Mikunopolis to Miku Expo LA and there was a better change of quality, though Mikunopolis had more costumes and I think Miku Expo LA uses Sega's modules (I think).  The only thing that is a small pet peeve is the fact they really try as much as they can to not have Miku touch her own body, as it may cause graphical clipping and may ruin the experience. I thought the concert was already pre-rendered and such."
Vocaloid,3bqgyw,Erzeal,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:22:58 2015 UTC,"Now, it is incredibly hard for us to notice any changes from those pictures (which were taken from the performance's video). But i wouldn't be surprise if they recycle the model. At best, let just hope that they would bother adding in new song.  Just to remind everyone, this kind of thing that they are doing is incredibly hard. New song = new animation to rig to the model + new song for the band to practice + the timing has to match = more thing to screw up.  Remember the error that they had on one of the concert very recently when her voice didn't come out when she was greeting the crowd? That was embarrassing but understandable."
Vocaloid,3bqgyw,Erzeal,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:36:33 2015 UTC,Well at least it was her first time there. I will agree they should have consistency. As few concerts as there are a year I don't see why they shouldn't make it brand new everytime. They will have to if they ever start touring more. You want to give people a reason to go and go again and not give them the exact same show everytime. On a similar topic why the hell isnt Gumi at the concerts yet?! Seriously wtf.
Vocaloid,3bqgyw,chunter16,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:24:35 2015 UTC,"I mostly agree with you there, however a lot of work is required for a brand new concert every year. The main point of my article was to point out that they've brought back old performances, but made no effort to update them. But as for Gumi, these concerts are by Crypton and SEGA, so that's the answer. Internet Co. have done some like performances with Gumi of course, and a lot of fans who run their own concerts often feature her (SRP and Vocalekt Visions in particular). Gumi has been featured at many events, just not the SEGA concerts of course."
Vocaloid,3bqgyw,Erzeal,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:48:53 2015 UTC,It's frustrating because she's one of the most popular vocaloids behind Miku and is in the Sega games. I don't know why it would be a big deal to license her from Internet Co. It would be big advertisement for them too.
Vocaloid,3bqgyw,chunter16,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:21:49 2015 UTC,"If it ever got to that level it would be Internet Co. having a concert that features all of their characters/voicebanks.  My understanding is that the concerts are expensive loss leaders, meant to draw newcomers into in the hobby. You'd tell a friend about the show, wouldn't you?"

Vocaloid,3bosqx,KonpeitoKiss,2,Wed Jul 1 01:03:55 2015 UTC,"Okay, the Japanese page was quite a bit more informative. The Cubase version of the editor is the only one that works on OSX.   I use Ableton so thats pretty annoying :(, no idea why they can't make the whole thing a VST.  Guess it's a VM / WINE or nothing.  Apparently Piapro studio runs on OSX natively but it seems to only have support for v3 vocaloids."

Vocaloid,3bosqx,sir_vancelot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:42:53 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately YAMAHA is making getting into Vocaloid4 very, very difficult for Vocaloid users outside of Japan. The V4 engine debuted in December and STILL the V4 Editor is not available to Americans, not even digitally. And physical copies aren't being sold outside of Japan. Looking at the Vocaloid Shop, there isn't a standalone Vocaloid 4 Editor for Cubase, only an upgrade from the V3 version to V4.   There IS good (decent?) support for OSX among Vocaloid3 voicebanks; most of the more popular ones are available for it. And I expect that will continue with Vocaloid4 voicebanks, but right now it's difficult to get into if you aren't Japanese. : / Since most of the most popular voicebanks are available for V3, you might consider getting the V3 Editor for Cubase and a V3 Vocaloid; but if you can, it might be best to wait until the end of the year to see if YAMAHA can pull their heads out of their butts soon."

Vocaloid,3bkp1o,Geminarius,26,Tue Jun 30 00:32:38 2015 UTC,"Quite the opposite, it's growing but not in a easy measurable way.  The rankings tend to have older songs since they get more points by having a lot of views, so it's harder for new songs with only 5,000 views and 500 mylists to get in, versus a song already established like Happy Synthesizer with 16,000 views and 50 mylists.   Add in the fact that LA is getting another Miku event with the art gallery happening next week, and how successful (and packed) Mikuexpo in China was, I'd think you were a little crazy OP.  It's growing, it's just harder for new songs to get any attention hence the low point scores on the ranking."
Vocaloid,3bkp1o,shslmiku,3,Tue Jun 30 03:33:46 2015 UTC,"Do you think it's therefore there's a problem with the current ranking system then? It sounds like that's the case.  But no, I think it's not declining, but I'm not that active on the vocaloid scene, I lean more towards utaite albums and things like that, but they're interconnected."
Vocaloid,3bkp1o,yorukita,8,Tue Jun 30 04:59:28 2015 UTC,"It's complicated.   I think the current ranking system should be revamped and give more points to newer songs, but at the same time, if people on NND want a nostalgia trip and keep listening to Happy Synthesizer, who are we to say that it shouldn't show up, just because Happy Synthesizer is popular that week (or for several weeks)?  It also doesn't help that free NND accounts only give you 100 mylist options, I ran out of mylists to give on my free account. NND also used to allow multiple views to count at once. (When you refresh a video on youtube, it counts as another view). NND stopped this practice because of spam? (Idk what prompted them to stop that). and so it was easier for songs from 2007-2009 to get more views simply by refreshing the page. Today on NND, a video gets one view from one unique visitor, refreshing the page won't up the view count."
Vocaloid,3bkp1o,shslmiku,2,Tue Jun 30 05:14:45 2015 UTC,I'm not too sure now the ranking system works - I was under the impression that Songs with higher TOTAL view count > Songs that have gained the most views that week.   I agree with your point - maybe songs should be ranked according to views gained that week?
Vocaloid,3bkp1o,yorukita,5,Tue Jun 30 05:27:43 2015 UTC,"maybe songs should be ranked according to views gained that week?   That is how they're ranked though. But with the current system if a video from 5 years ago gets 16,000 views and a video from this week get 16,000 views, they are counted equally. (Which isn't fair for the new video since it's hard to get attention compared to established classics).  The ranking system is hard to understand but hopefully my posts made some sense at least!"
Vocaloid,3bkp1o,shslmiku,2,Tue Jun 30 05:36:52 2015 UTC,"Oh I see. So it just needs rebalancing of how views are weighted according to how old or famous the song is.  Thanks for explaining, it did make sense!"
Vocaloid,3bkp1o,yorukita,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:39:06 2015 UTC,"While I certainly see what you mean, I feel that lately it's become disproportionally geared toward older titles. I've been using the rankings as a discovery tool for quite a while, and even though certain old tunes would always crop up again and again (I'm looking at you, Senbonzakura), there would still be a solid handful of new songs in there.  Looking at this week's charts and some of the several weeks prior, I feel like I'm seeing very little new releases. It's just a handful now, and older hit songs are making massive comebacks instead."
Vocaloid,3bkp1o,shslmiku,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:35:33 2015 UTC,"The new releases are still there, they just aren't getting enough views and mylists to make it in the weekly ranking.  If you're really interested in discovering new songs, I highly recommend the daily vocaloid ranking. This ranking is based on views and mylists in the last 24 hours, and no song is featured more than twice. I usually find a gem or two within a few days of watching it."
Vocaloid,3bkp1o,hypoxify,11,Wed Jul 1 19:08:58 2015 UTC,"I think it's definitely growing with this upcoming tech savvy generation, although I think the recent lull is just another inevitable trough"
Vocaloid,3bkp1o,cam19L,5,Tue Jun 30 00:36:18 2015 UTC,the lull may just be due to the subject matter just getting older
Vocaloid,3bkp1o,vocathor,5,Tue Jun 30 00:47:21 2015 UTC,"I've been keeping track of search results for new original song uploads on NND for each Vocaloid.  My data goes back almost 3 years for each month.  It's unfortunate I haven't tracked both original and cover usage.  There is a somewhat downward trend of fewer total original songs being uploaded since the beginning of this year.  So far, this year has had 10,315 uploads.  Last year, 2014,  for the same period, was 10,480.  2013 for the same period was 12,100.  We're already behind.  But, things could pick up the rest of the year.  What's more interesting are the performance of each Vocaloid...I'll leave that summary for another day."

The Vocaloid scene looks more like a saturation than a decline to me.  A decline would be marked by something a lot worse e.g. CFM getting out of the speech synthesis business, ending all Vocaloid development work. Many of the successes the overall Vocaloid/UTAU community enjoys today could be traced back to CFM's marketing and sales push of Hatsune Miku. IIRC one of the nicodou's 2010 livestreams mentioned Miku as one of its biggest drivers of the video sharing site's growth. Imagine all that stops overnight."
Vocaloid,3bkp1o,riipah,3,Tue Jun 30 06:07:27 2015 UTC,"I think it's because it has been becoming more commercial and mainstream, which generally happens with things that become popular. Someone might talk about ""maturity"", but I'd like to avoid that term since it implies something that is inevitable and generally preferred.  In stores in Japan it seemed strongly that Vocaloid has been shifting from the ""doujin"" section to the commercial music section. Vocaloid producers becoming professional artists signed with big labels, and Vocaloid itself becoming more recognized among the masses with all those big events. That can be both good and bad. Generally it means bigger, more professional content, but also less varied.  In a world of masses where the community isn't as tight anymore popularity seems to depend on commercial promotion and what is already popular - popular things becoming more popular while lesser known artists getting ignored. I've heard a lot of Vocaloid fans complain they can't find the new interesting songs behind the few hit songs.  Of course part of it is because after Miku's release there hasn't been any major improvements or changes in Vocaloid software. It's harder to impress people anymore, harder to experiment. Most of the new Vocaloids feel kind of meaningless (to older fans at least) since there's so many coming out and they're so similar. It's harder to identify with the characters in the same way as it was back when Miku came out and there was only a handful of characters.  So I guess it comes down to why people are into Vocaloid. Originally it was about peer production, something new and special in singing, cute character designs and voices that fans could identify with. Those are all still there, but being shadowed by commercial, professionally made Vocaloid music. That will obviously make some of the older fans and artists lose interest.  I think that would explain the decline in the Vocaloid rankings and new songs on nico nico overall. It's too early to say the Vocaloid scene overall is in decline, because of those big concerts and other events happening worldwide. That will depend on how lasting the commercial and overseas popularity is.  This is just my view from following the fandom for a few years."
Vocaloid,3bkp1o,ariolander,3,Tue Jun 30 10:33:07 2015 UTC,Maybe that specific sunset of the fandom but from my POV as manager of an Engloid-centric Vocaloid blog I haven't seen this much hype in years. With the upcoming release of Vocaloid 4 the fire hasn't looked brighter.

Vocaloid,3bkp1o,KonpeitoKiss,2,Tue Jun 30 15:08:06 2015 UTC,"I usually don't watch those but some times I do see the same songs get to the rankings again now and then, but there's plenty of songs that get uploaded everyday, but they aren't necessarily viral or popular unless a first time producer does something really successful or it's uploaded by an already popular person. Events take a while to organize though we can't expect consistent releases all the time since musicians need breaks and get writer's/art block."

Vocaloid,3bkp1o,KomorebiSound,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:31:03 2015 UTC,"I think the scene will grow as long as Yamaha keeps investing in software development. The problem with vocaloid, in my opinion, is that it's still an early build despite having shipped 4 releases... The software is usable and can be mastered to achieve great results but it feels far from a solid product that a producer can take and easily integrate into their workflow.  The vocaloid scene will live long thanks to the classic hits, but the growth that you are talking about will only come if the software keeps improving and new producers decide to start using it."
Vocaloid,3bkp1o,Erzeal,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:55:44 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen any signs of a decline yet. If anything it seems to be getting more popular. There does need to be a better way of showing off/pushing new works though so it's not just the major stuff taking over. I also wish that Crypton would start touring Miku around a lot more than just 2 or 3 concerts a year, an American tour would be cool. They need to add more to the concerts though, I don't know why Gumi hasn't been in them yet. I think IA has a chance to grow popularity wise."
Vocaloid,3bkp1o,skyeondope,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:02:25 2015 UTC,Gumi and IA are not Crypton's vocaloids so featuring them is a question of interest and licensing expenses. Considering Crypton doesn't make any profit directly with concerts I doubt they'd ever feature them.

Vocaloid,3bkp1o,vocathor,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:28:15 2015 UTC,Think of the concerts as an advertising campaign to create interest from fans and potential new fans. They are likely to buy from the real money makers:  Merchandise and other products with character tie-ins.  Crypton makes stupid amounts of money off their character and name licenses.

Pick and choose whatever questions you like, I have lot.  1) Considering the success of Mikuexpo last year and the probable success of this year's art gallery, is it possible for each year to have it's own Miku event in LA or southern California?  2) Is there any possibility for more official English tutorials (or even an english guidebook similar to already released Miku V3 guides)? A lot of people buy the software and have no clue what to do with it.  3) How many people are involved in the creation of an english voicebank? The reason for this question is that all of Crypton's english vb have some phoneme issues, most notably [@r], [I] and [@U], (Luka V4 for example according to the wiki, [I tested those phonemes with Eng Miku and she also has those same issues]) those phonemes have a thick accent and add an unnecessary ""R' sound, or are just incorrect vowel sounds, making their English incomprehensible. How many people are involved for testing and feedback? [Not a question but please suggest that CFM hires native english speakers for working on their english voicebanks]  4) Are there any plans for another Mikubook?  5) Are there any plans to engage more producers in the western fandom like an original song contest?"
Vocaloid,3bh4s0,shslmiku,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:43:37 2015 UTC,"Here some questions I would like to be answer if possible.   1.Is there going to be a V4 release for Kagamine Rin and Len?(probably not going to be answer)   2.Do you have any big events your planning this year, like you did with David Letterman?   3.Since your a small company, are your going to expand with employees and collaboration in the future?    Are their any plans for CFM for have a contest for fans to win tickets for a upcoming Miku concert in Japan or America? Do you any plans to release a new Hatsune Miku game in Japan, or a release in the west?  Is there going to another Hatsune Miku manga/book coming out soon or in the future?  Have you ever had a anime adaption or a anime for miku and the rest of the Cryton Future Media crew? (Luka, Rin and Len etc)    That's all the question I have. Thanks and I love contribute in the Vocaloid community! (I don't know why the question numbers resets)"
Vocaloid,3bh4s0,VenRox-Ven,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:26:32 2015 UTC,According to the wikia there will be a Rin/Len update (http://vocaloid.wikia.com/wiki/Kagamine_Rin_%5C_Len_Vb_update) but no set release date so far.
Vocaloid,3bh4s0,KonpeitoKiss,2,Mon Jun 29 17:27:29 2015 UTC,"Release date is announced for Q3 2015, actually."
Vocaloid,3bh4s0,KonpeitoKiss,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:55:23 2015 UTC,"Q3? Well, I remember people saying it might be delayed like Luka or they'd focus on Miku first but hopefully it'll be worth the wait for composers, I usually don't listen to a lot of Rin & Len unless it's Dateken or some other composers that tune them a specific way"
Vocaloid,3bh4s0,KonpeitoKiss,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:01:47 2015 UTC,"Answers already exist for many of your questions.  1: The Rin/Len V4 release was announced for Q3 2015.  2: Crypton doesn't make any of the games I believe you're thinking about, other companies are responsible for that. They do, however, develop some mobile games.  3: Similar answer for books: Crypton doesn't make those.  4: No."
Vocaloid,3bh4s0,kirito_kurosaki,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:00:36 2015 UTC,"Good luck, I can't think of any questions that wouldn't be already asked to them a hundred times already. Maybe ask them if they'd consider making a vocaloid based on a popular utaite like Piko was"
Vocaloid,3bh4s0,jcpb,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:26:17 2015 UTC,How about thoughts on Virtual Reality videos/games or 3D AR videos like the previous one with MitchieM
Vocaloid,3bh4s0,kirito_kurosaki,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:01:18 2015 UTC,"That pretty much requires Sega and/or Sony onboard for game development, which is beyond CFM's scope."
Vocaloid,3bfvek,AnimeKilljoy,3,Sun Jun 28 21:26:19 2015 UTC,Um yes I'll take 20
Vocaloid,3bfvek,Pikmin1211,2,Sun Jun 28 23:00:42 2015 UTC,"Aww, that'd be a cute cover for like a notebook or something"
Vocaloid,3bfvek,KonpeitoKiss,2,Sun Jun 28 22:04:41 2015 UTC,do you have the base sprite
Vocaloid,3bge43,GeekyCreeper,3,Mon Jun 29 00:10:14 2015 UTC,"http://rotb.piiym.net/polygloid/?p=phonetics  OR for example your want the vocaloid to sing ""disgusting"", so you draw out 3 notes because there are 3 syllables in 'disgusting'. in the first note your drew you out, you would type the word and it automatically fills out the rest of the notes.  I hope that made sense."
Vocaloid,3bge43,barabobam,2,Mon Jun 29 00:20:44 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Now, which column is the text I need to input?"
Vocaloid,3bge43,barabobam,3,Mon Jun 29 00:22:51 2015 UTC,"Always the first one.  Alternatively, you could right click and there's an option in the drop down menu that says 'Insert Lyrics'. You could input them there if you want, or edit the lyrics you have so far."
Vocaloid,3bge43,barabobam,3,Mon Jun 29 00:28:58 2015 UTC,"Awesome, man! You're my hero!"
Vocaloid,3bge43,sir_vancelot,2,Mon Jun 29 00:48:34 2015 UTC,No problem!! Glad I could help _^
Vocaloid,3bge43,vocathor,4,Mon Jun 29 01:27:57 2015 UTC,Something to keep in mind about the list barabobam provided is that it seems that it has not been updated since the Vocaloid2 era. If you are using the Vocaloid3 or Vocaloid4 Editors (and a V3/V4 English Vocaloid) things may be a little different. (I am a new Vocaloid4 user so I'm still learning the ropes myself.) http://vocaloid.wikia.com/wiki/English_Phonetics The list here may be more up to date and accurate for the newer versions of Vocaloid.
Vocaloid,3bgbfv,Kiiroshima,2,Sun Jun 28 23:45:45 2015 UTC,[[yasashii intensifies]] would love to get a Neru sub. So I'll be cheering for you. Do you need a specific karma.. Thing to create a sub?
Vocaloid,3bgbfv,formaliiin,2,Wed Jul 1 11:33:40 2015 UTC,"I have no idea how much karma I need, but you could possibly donate your eyebrows. That might be enough."
Vocaloid,3bgbfv,formaliiin,2,Thu Jul 2 01:11:09 2015 UTC,I just have to warn you I'm only human and I have a finite number of eyebrows :(

Vocaloid,3bf5a9,KonpeitoKiss,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:48:11 2015 UTC,I don't know why it is now because this song was made 8 years ago and one of the most dedicated song to miku. I'd like to read this.
Vocaloid,3bcvxt,K0mit,2,Sun Jun 28 00:47:38 2015 UTC,"The dream, ahh. Nice."
Vocaloid,3bcvxt,PsychoNitro,2,Sun Jun 28 05:04:15 2015 UTC,"I went to supercon and ended up seeing him leaving, thought it was a cool sight."
Vocaloid,3bcvxt,C4Edgez,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:48:58 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to work out if those plates are fake... I can see no mention of 野長 (Nonaga) as a city or any area at all. 長野 (Nagano), however, is fine and most everybody knows that. Also, it's a very modest itasha effort. I've seen far better on a Lancer before..."
Vocaloid,3bcvxt,Loserbait,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:59:35 2015 UTC,"Likely fake. 野長 turns up a few person matches, but no places. As for the itasha itself, it's a decent starting point - and that's all the good news about it."

Especially after learning that it's a trilogy only recently, haha.  Spiral Trilogy series  1: Moon Snow Flower -- YouTube w/ subs / Nico Nico Douga 2: Paradoxical Paradigm -- YouTube w/ subs / Nico Nico Douga 3: Signal -- YouTube w/ subs / Nico Nico Douga    Spiral Trilogy on KarenT Ebot's Piapro"
