The parts fit and are nicely finished, the instructions are clear despite being in Chinese. The wheels, axles, transmission and shocks arrive already built, that saves some time. The chassis goes together without problems. The bodyparts fit together well and as long as you've got the right glue it shouldn't give you any problems. Cutting and filing the 70 cleats took some time but watching some IASIP made it bearable."

For you, just rip out the old mech speed controller, stick it in place, initialise and off you go.   It's compatible with both nimh and lipo battery configurations, nimh is more or less plug and play, lipo is more effort with chargers, firebags, monitors and upgraded connectors.  If you want to see a significant performance upgrade this controller will also allow a motor upgrade, again just plug it in and go.  $17 - http://www.ebay.com/itm/Tamiya-53068-OP068-RS-540-Sport-Tuned-Motor-/121697285353?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item1c55b934e9   If you want to spend more money (+$40) a full brushless system will give you another jump in performance, to get the full advantage from it you'll need to go lipo, not essential but brushless on cheap nimh's is a waste."

In other words, the ONLY thing you will find is that ALL batteries today will last MUCH longer than that battery did.

rccars,3dxahz,alkyjason,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:06:55 2015 UTC,This is something I can get behind.  Are those stock AR60 axles?  How are they holding up against the big clod tires and the power.  Everything I read said people had to replace too many parts to stand up to big brushless power and it scared me away from my shafty monster truck project.
rccars,3dxahz,Derigor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:01:47 2015 UTC,"After a 2 batteries the axles seem to be holding up, they are all stock but the pinion is shimmed a little so there's no slop. I haven't totally beaten on it yet. The stock transmission did give out one the second battery though. I had hardened gears and an aluminum cad on the way but ran out of patience and ran the stock one. It did handle very well though. It does need sway bars and I'm working on that now, the wheelies were a little funky without them. It's never gonna perform like an erevo or anything but I definitely like the driveability better than my clod( stock wheelbase, 4 link, eMaxx shocks, old trinity brushed motors and Novak esc, rear lockout) it drove much more predictably than the clod but still kinda bobbed around and had the old school monster truck looks. I am going to stiffen up the damping some and see what that does for it."
rccars,3dxahz,Derigor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:23:36 2015 UTC,Right now I'm running a clod on a thundertech rage chassis with two Holmes hobbies 21t brushed motors.   It's alright on 2s Lipo and insane on 4s. 3s is probably the sweet spot but I don't have one laying around.   I was looking at building an ar60 based truck but after spending time on rcmt it seems a lot of guys are moving away from those axles and toward the mad force axles.   Make sure to post on here more of your truck as you break it in and crush things.

rccars,3dvyqa,Nemesisllama,3,Mon Jul 20 23:49:25 2015 UTC,The most important thing is to have the proper crystals with the proper MHz. I have a futaba t2ph connected to one of those receivers. It should be 75mhz. I've also seen a hitec Lynx paired with one and when I get back home to Portland I will test an old airtronics blazer with it. For best results though typically futaba radios work best.   However for the price you're better off just picking up a new 2.4ghz radio with receiver. Like a flysky for example which can be had for $20-$30  Edit: that's a xxxt Francis edition. If you look in another post I made today you'll see that I picked up my old xxx kinwald edition buggy this morning from storage so I must say Brother!!!  That truck was top of the line in its day. And could probably still hold its own at the local track still.
rccars,3dvyqa,Derigor,2,Mon Jul 20 00:45:35 2015 UTC,"Well if you plan on going all in on the hobby I'd buy a futaba 4pls and use that.

rccars,3dw0yf,BardsDirge,2,Mon Jul 20 06:19:05 2015 UTC,Pull the motor out and give it some power. See if the motor is making a noise. Roll the car with the motor gears demeshed (is that a word? {Gears not touching or motor removed}) and see if its coming from the drive line. Inspect the spur gear. My 10 scales that I run without gear covers make that noise too. For me it comes from crap getting packed into the valleys of the gear. Sand and dirt get packed in the lowest points of the gear and it causes that noise in my experience. It takes a little while but you can clean out the spur gear with a pick or a needle. Hope this helps. Keep me posted!

rccars,3duiu9,Lolfred13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:51:08 2015 UTC,Very easy. Loosen the screws that hold the motor in place. Slide motor to adjust. And then re tighten. You want enough gap that there is a little play between the gears. The easiest way is to put a piece of paper between the gears. Push the gears together and tighten. Then remove paper. You do not want to push hard.

What I am ticked about is that they KNEW beforehand that there would be delays, and yet, still stated 5-9 business days. If they put up a little disclaimer saying that shipments to Canada were frequently being delayed by up to a month, I could choose a different shipping option, or wait to place the order all together.

First of all they listed the incorrect part for my rc, then asked me to pay for a tracked courier bag to return the wheels that were incorrect (courier was worth more than the wheels). I asked to add some parts to the wheels that were being sent to me and have the shipping fee waived. This was agreed, I paid for the shocks and lights I was after, and got told I would have the shipping fee refunded after sending them a copy of the invoice (the invoice that they generated to send to me. Eh?). After receiving the package which had the correct wheels and shocks, I realised they never sent me my lights. I sent the copy of the invoice, received no refund for my shipping, but I did receive another package identical to the first. Another set of wheels, another set of shocks, no lights. At this point I can't be bothered with the website and won't use it again."

That's just how ordering from China or Japan goes.   Your package will eventually show up.  They are a reputable company and not some fly by night organization.

My problem was that the rep from asiatees told me that packages to Canada take a month, yet the shipping page takes 5-9 business days (2weeks). If they knew that from the get go, they should have that posted. I don't even care if the reason it got stopped was because of customs, I can handle that, and would not bother me at all, that happens.

To expect something to travel from the other side of the world and clear international customs and be delivered to you in that time frame with the cheap shipping option should have raised an eyebrow.    I agree with you 100% their site shouldn't have claimed that.  It's silly for them to even write that on there in my personal experience 9 to 14 days is about the average I wait.

For one the stock arms have too much flex and allow the dog bones to pop out. As you can see your axles have excessive wear where the dog bone sits. To solve your problem you want to upgrade the arms and hub carriers with rpm parts. Then replace those axles and dog bones with aftermarket cvd's. Don't get the hpi ones.

You also need a low voltage alarm but they're less than $10.    The Blackfoot is the same as my Wild Dagger but mine is dual motor. Same chassis.    Asiatees.com sells bearing kits so you can upgrade from the bushings.  Plus they have other bits too like taller shock towers.    Those two things plus a 20 tooth pinion should get you q tighter vehicle that goes 20-25 mph.    Apparently the drivetrain can handle a mild brushless system as well.

Buying a ShortCourse truck, then taking off the ShortCourse body to get a lower center of gravity - fine with me, but it would have been easier to buy a buggy.  The essence of RC SC is that it's not a buggy. Removing the SC body for a lower CG and driving with what is essentially a buggy body is - to me - missing the point. Want to drive a buggy ? Drive a buggy! Want to drive a ShortCourse? Drive a ShortCourse! But why buy a ShortCourse just to remove the stuff that makes the difference?"

Putting a LCG belly pan WOULD change the center of gravity.  Have you ever raced RC trucks?  At the track Short Course or not a LCG is always better, no matter the body.  The body is only cosmetics pure and simple.  If you don't like his truck then move on.  It seems in the end you don't like it that's fine, I as well as others do enjoy it."

Ofcourse it does, the body has quite some weight and is positioned high up so it moves the COG up. The body is not just cosmetics, it has mass influences the COG and thus weight transfer.

rccars,3dnr12,nealbot5000,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:14:16 2015 UTC,"Why so hostile? I'm just explaining the body really does have quite an effect on the driving behaviour of RC ShortCourse cars.  The sideways weight transfer is increased a lot by the lexan shell. Most ShortCourse bodies weigh between 200 and 300 grams - that's around a quarter of a kilogram. Especially with ShortCourse cars the body is positioned relatively high above the wheels and chassis so this has quite some influence on the center of gravity.   ShortCourse cars are a lot more prone to flipping over when cornering when the body is on then when the body is off. This is exactly the reason companies make light-weight bodies for ShortCourse trucks that weigh 20% less but break much easier as well - people use the normal bodies for practice, and the light-weight bodies for actual races.  If you're just bashing you probably won't notice it, but anyone actually racing SC cars competitively knows how much influence the body has on the center of gravity and thus the lateral weight transfer. This is why the body is always mounted as low as possible. Mount the body 20mm higher on your car and try to take high speed corners and see what happens."

After watching your video and reading your issues, your diff is absolutely slipping or ""barking"". This is a very bad thing. If you diff has been doing this for long, meaning, a couple minutes worth of runtime your diff is toast and will not function properly until all the diff balls and rings are replaced and rebuilt.  I'm not going to say you made a horrible mistake, but you picked a very advanced racing kit, which is not generally recommended for a beginner. You discovered the reason! Most people picking up a racing kit will have learned somewhere how to build and break-in a ball diff before they get started. The diff is almost literally the ""heart"" of a racecar and on an rc car is it actually a tuning aid for traction and steering response. I don't want you to feel like I'm chastising you or anything (I made the same mistake myself as a beginner), but generally people end up with more ""bulletproof"" vehicles for their first car.  Having said all that, here is the first part to an excellent video series on how to build and break-in a ball diff and slipper clutch. Essentially, the diff has to be tight enough so the little ball bearings don't slip against the rings, but loose enough so that the wheels can turn independently of each other. Yours is so loose that the sound you are hearing is the balls scraping against the rings inside the transmission. If you ever hear that again you need to stop what you are doing and tighten the diff immediately or loosen your slipper clutch.  Here's a secondary solution for you. It'll cost you about $25-30 but it'll make your problem go away forever:  a gear diff. The gear diff will never slip but it will also not be as adjustable and ""fast"" as a ball diff will in a competition setting. I'd really recommend you throw the gear diff in your car until you start racing and get consistent. It'll be easier on you in the long run and I'm very confident you'll never break it. If you decide to get the gear diff hang on to the ball diff, sealed in a plastic bag and get a rebuild kit for it. Rebuild it slowly and carefully and follow the instructions of that video I showed you. Save it for when you think you can handle it in your car. It's definitely a performance improvement, but at this point in your experience you need something easy, not something fast.  Feel free to reply or PM for more help. I've been racing for 15 years and have been a Team Losi/TLR driver for that entire time. I own one of each 22 vehicle they make (22/T/SCT/4) and know those cars inside and out. I'm here to help. Get out there and have fun."

I will be defiantly   in future going to ask for racing advice so say alert. here is my 2 part video of the problem:   Part 1:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw2g9Sm1Bes  Part 2:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuwkljOdq3Y   Thank you for the advice, a gear diff might be the way to go for now, but if i go to my local race way should i have a ball diff for racing?"
rccars,3dodoa,68pontiac,2,Sat Jul 18 23:16:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice, a gear diff might be the way to go for now, but if i go to my local race way should i have a ball diff for racing?   Eventually, yes. But gear diffs are definitely very raceable and many people prefer them for high-traction surfaces. A ball diff is generally a better choice because it is far more adjustable and much easier to adjust. A gear diff has to be removed from the car and opened up to be adjsuted. (They are often filled with very thick silicone fluid to slow down or speed up their movement/action.) A ball diff is also considerably lighter than a gear diff and reducing rotating weight will increase acceleration and top speed.  In the meantime tighten the diff more. There's a screw that holds the assembly together that should be installed on the (US) ""driver's side"" of the car, assuming you didn't install it backwards. Tighten it up until the noise goes away. Also, consider loosening the slipper clutch to help compensate for the looser diff."
rccars,3dodoa,68pontiac,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:46:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I will most likely order a gear diff for street.  for my local track (http://rchr.biz/), would this be considered a ""high traction"" surface? as for the ball diff rebuild, do you think the diff is savable? I can open it up and take pics if that helps  Thanks again"
rccars,3dodoa,68pontiac,2,Sat Jul 18 23:59:53 2015 UTC,"I watched one of the YouTube videos your track posted. It's hard to tell from the video but it seems similar to what I race on, which could be considered low to medium traction, depending on the prep on the track. If it's been watered lightly, swept recently or had sugar applied the conditions can change rather largely. Don't sweat the ball diff vs. gear diff dilemma too much. Chances are  you won't really notice much of a difference on the track until you get a really good feel for the car. Learn to drive it well before you go too far overboard with tuning it.  My opinion may seem a bit extreme, but if my diff ever slips on the track for more than a minute or so it's time to rebuild. The rings will develop a groove from the balls slipping against them. As soon as a groove forms the balls start to shave down and go out of round. There's no saving it at that point and it's due for new balls and rings at the least. It might seem excessive to some, but I'm a ""maintenance freak"" if you want to call it that. Some people will flip the rings over and use the other side (that hasn't developed a groove) and re-use the balls, but it's just not the same as a new diff. It's definitely better (and that's how I rebuilt my wife's diff most recently) and is absolutely better than a ""crunchy"" diff."

rccars,3dodoa,lametec,2,Mon Jul 20 04:23:25 2015 UTC,You are welcome. Take your time rebuilding the diff and when it comes time to throw it back in there be sure you break it in slowly and tighten it immediately if it slips (or loosen the slipper clutch).

If so, it seems the noise follows the speed of the motor and not the transmission, so that pretty much only leaves motor bearings."

I have a Traxxas Emaxx that has two steering servos, one of them had gone out and the symptom that I had was my steering wouldn't return to center, it also would not fully turn to one direction but would fully turn to the other side.  I solved my problem by buying a new servo"
rccars,3dnics,Knobz116,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:53:34 2015 UTC,More than likely you need a new servo. It's not unusual to put everything low dollar into something that's getting sold used. Most people starting out aren't going to know brands or models of the parts your getting. Your best bet would be to pick up a hitec high speed servo. That's a decent me priced reliable servo. You can get for 25-35 bucks.
rccars,3dnics,keriv100,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:02:48 2015 UTC,"In addition to the suggestions you have already received (and before you spend any money), I would also suggest checking to make sure the bolts that hold the steering hardware are not too tight. This can cause the steering to not return to center. I am referring to the bolts that hold the top brace down over the steering components with the ball bearings. When re-assembling the vehicle, an easy mistake to make is to tighten these too much and cause a symptom similar to what you are describing.  They talk about it a bit on this thread. I have also seen it mentioned in a few YouTube videos.  I hope this helps."

rccars,3dmprf,Jay69Rich,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:49:50 2015 UTC,Also make sure your trim didn't get moved.  It has to see neutral for several seconds to arm the ESC.

The rpm adds some weight.
rccars,3diiav,richsphire,3,Thu Jul 16 15:26:52 2015 UTC,I have the Everest 10 and I love it. The necessary upgrade is to replace the plastic lockers with the axial steel lockers. There are a few ways you can go with this.    Buy the lockers and use a dremel to grind the plastic lockers from the stock diff housings so that the lockers will fit.  Get the lockers and the axial diff cases as well as the diff gaskets. All this will cost less than $20. And takes care of the front and rear.  Now you have the axles. The stock axles need to be ground down on the ends with a dremel to fit the smaller slot in the axial locker. Very easy to do. Or if you don't want to bother with the dremel the stock ax10/scx10 axles will be a direct fit.    The stock esc I hear can handle lipo but I don't know if it has a lvc. I replaced mine day one with a $20 hobbywing 1060 that can handle 3s. The stock drive train does seem to handle 3s just fine but I replaced the top and idler gears with steel ax10 gears for peace of mind. The transmission diff gear however has different sized out drives requiring a funky sized bearing that I couldn't seem to find In Order to run an axial gear. So that's one point of incompatibility I've found.   The motor I've been running is just a cheap rc4wd 35t motor. It gives me a good mix of torque and wheel speed. I also had some fun with a 27t but it didn't crawl as well.   The biggest upgrade you can make and what turned my humble redcat into a beast is a set of new tires. I went with the hb rovers and I never feel like I'm lacking traction.   Redcat offers aluminum c hubs and steering knuckles but they seem expensive to me. Stock plastic axial c hubs will fit just fine with a little modification to the screw hole in the hubs. So if you break a c hub you can at least get a new one at your lhs as long as you're willing to drill or dremel it.   A lot of my upgrades have been more about axial/redcat compatibility experiments rather than actual need. If you have any specific questions feel free to ask I've done a lot of modding to my redcat just to try stuff.  The exceed maxstone 10 is virtually identical to the redcat so you can find some more options for modding by checking those forums. It's been out longer so there is more info on it.   The body actually seems to hold up pretty well to a lot of hard falls and rolls over rocks. I painted the outside of mine gun metal gray. The stock paint scheme was not something I was fond of. Any 1/10 scale crawler body will fit. Especially those made for an ax10.  Some may require additional wheel well trimming though.   Oh yeah the stock servo seemed just fine to me but I'm currently running a tower pro mg996r just because I wanted to try it. And I also suggest a ubec to let you give full 6v or more power to the servo. I'm happy with the servo which seems to have plenty of torque for the Everest. I'd say get at least a 12kg servo.
rccars,3diiav,Nemesisllama,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:45:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for that info. I will look into it all thoroughly.  I will certainly get the tires. I like the idea of swapping out the motor and ESC like you mentioned.  Any advice on getting a different body on this thing? If not, I might do something like you did and paint the outside of it. Maybe plastidip it too."
rccars,3diiav,Nemesisllama,2,Thu Jul 16 17:40:07 2015 UTC,"Any crawler specific body should fit without much issue other than some extra trimming. I did forget one major upgrade/tuning you can do that makes almost as much of a difference as the tires. Get some nitro fuel tubing and cut 4 2mm pieces from it and install them inside the shocks underneath the piston. Then fill the shocks with 100wt shock oil. This will lower the COG, limit tire rub on the body and virtually eliminate torque twist."
rccars,3diiav,if0rg0t2remember,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:25:06 2015 UTC,100wt is way too heavy for all but the heaviest crawlers. This is a light one with a comp style frame.
rccars,3diiav,Nemesisllama,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:55:30 2015 UTC,Seems to work great in mine. Was the suggestion of an experienced comp crawler at my lhs. I like the slow suspension action.

rccars,3dat3a,knobber_jobbler,2,Tue Jul 14 22:11:11 2015 UTC,"Used can be great if you have some experience in the hobby and/or willingness to learn.  Most of my cars have been used and for the most part I have lucked out by asking questions and whenever possible looking at what I'm buying very closely.  Most of my transactions take place on RCTech as well! :)  The problem is, when you are new to the hobby or a new platform you DON'T know what to look for or what questions to ask.  This can lead to overpaying for something that has been beat on hard and requires a good bit of money to get back into.   Can be very frustrating to find out the car you just bought needs $40 in new bearings, a full shock/diff rebuild, or more just to handle correctly.  Bent bulkheads/shock towers are another common item.  Application matters as well.  If you have no intention of ever visiting a track (let alone racing) I would have a hard time recommending a 2wd or 4wd 1/10 buggy to anyone.  There are much better options out there and you may not be able to get many parts.  I don't mind turning some wrenches and with a reasonable collection of spares a little work doesn't scare me, but that's not always the case."

I recommend doing a lot of reading on forums to see what others are using as well as seeing what's coming out so I can cherry pick the deals when the new model drops.   I only got a 1/10 buggy because I like the way they handle compared to the SCT.   I think it's important to remember to have fun.   I also think it's important to set a spending limit....like Vegas.

rccars,3d70lg,Troybylt,2,Tue Jul 14 02:13:00 2015 UTC,Awsome responses guys thanks!
rccars,3d70lg,Max_Xevious,3,Tue Jul 14 02:17:41 2015 UTC,"HPI had one for sale many years ago, but it was about $100, I found a cheap knockoff for about $20 on Ebay and picked one up. Since I know it was severly frowned upon (and illegal to use now) for racing, I snuck it into my 4wheel mod on a race night to test it out.  HOLY SHIT  It was amazing how much of a difference it made racing. It did not matter if you were balls out everywhere on the track, that damn thing would keep the car straight no matter how much I messed up. I found that I could be completely reckless, way to hot into corners and power out without a care in the world.  I ended up having to stop using it as it was constantly blowing out the BEC in my speedos. After having them warrantied a few times, I started getting the stink eye from them asking WTF I was doing to constantly be blowing them out.  ahh.. good times. I will probably pick one up to play with again, it was so much fun."
rccars,3d70lg,OhZone,2,Tue Jul 14 16:07:54 2015 UTC,"Oh man, love AVC in my 1/8 Mugen. I don't race or anything so it stays in there. For bashing it's a ridiculously awesome upgrade. A little pricey they can be found on sale. I think I paid like 60 on a 30% off at the hobby store."
rccars,3d70lg,Ban_All_Gifs,2,Tue Jul 14 05:03:46 2015 UTC,"The one I got is under $20. You can't go wrong at that price. I don't know if it's as good as the more expensive ones, but it certainly works quite well.  http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__65686__TrackStar_D_Spec_Drift_Gyro_V2.html  They also have a very well-priced radio set with an integrated gyro, which would be nice for new builds.  http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__47077__TrackStar_D_Spec_TS4G_2_4GHz_4_Channel_Radio_System_Gyro_Integrated_.html"
rccars,3d70lg,OhZone,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:12:11 2015 UTC,Wow. That is super cheap. I wasn't aware that the gyro was something that could be installed separate from the receiver. I'll probably pick up a couple more for the two cars that should be arriving in the next few days.
rccars,3d70lg,richsphire,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:46:03 2015 UTC,"I enjoy AVC. I have it on a couple vehicles and I think it rocks. Just something for fun. I certainly still like manual control too, but this is something fun for bashing and playing like you described (BMX track)."
rccars,3d5mqv,TheHailngDragon,11,Mon Jul 13 18:38:10 2015 UTC,we just buy new ones when the old ones get dirty.
rccars,3d5mqv,jonny-,4,Mon Jul 13 19:01:07 2015 UTC,If only I had the money! Haha
rccars,3d5mqv,JonnyPockets,2,Mon Jul 13 19:03:03 2015 UTC,"I mix water and organic all purpose cleaner in a spray bottle, and I spray the dirty bits with it. Then I blast it all off with my air compressor. Rinse and repeat until desired cleanliness is achieved."
rccars,3d5mqv,CruJonesBeRad,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:18:49 2015 UTC,Terrorfied to get any water near my rc.
rccars,3d5mqv,knobber_jobbler,3,Mon Jul 13 19:41:26 2015 UTC,My buggy gets the same bath before every run on the track. Just take your time spraying the dirt areas and keep away from electronics.
rccars,3d5mqv,PartyboobBoobytrap,2,Mon Jul 13 20:31:24 2015 UTC,"If your electronics aren't waterproof its easy to make them splash resistant with a mixture of plastic electrical tape and something like corrosion x.   Go onto YouTube and search for Squirrelrod, he has a whole series on it."
rccars,3d5mqv,knobber_jobbler,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:03:35 2015 UTC,Seems like a good idea
rccars,3d5mqv,PartyboobBoobytrap,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:06:47 2015 UTC,"Despite all the cleaning methods here, leaning to the side of caution is less fun but less expensive.  I've seen more than one waterproof RC been shown up as only water resistant."
rccars,3d5mqv,knobber_jobbler,2,Tue Jul 14 01:03:04 2015 UTC,Just need to check up on who actually made the ESC and servo.  I wouldn't trust some generic Chinese clone which says its waterproof but I do trust that my Castle waterproof system is actually waterproof. That all said it is very easy to make them better than splash resistant.
rccars,3d5mqv,terminashunator,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:46:53 2015 UTC,"For sure.. I was speaking more towards the fact that even a completely waterproof vehicle will still have bearings rust and water flows grit into places it would normally go.  I avoid water with my RCs, but dust can be just as evil."
rccars,3d5mqv,let_them_burn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:16:43 2015 UTC,"Getting sealed bearings and sealed diffs will help but yeah, something is eventually going to get rust and dirt will get where you least want it."
rccars,3d5mqv,Derigor,2,Tue Jul 14 17:17:07 2015 UTC,C...clean? I've never heard of that RC!
rccars,3d5mqv,curtiswernthere,2,Mon Jul 13 20:16:23 2015 UTC,Lots of guys go over their cars with pb blaster and a tooth brush. Every so often I'll take my apart completely for a thorough cleaning. Most of the the time I leave them dirty so long as it's not in critical areas.
rccars,3d5mqv,Brownrdan27,2,Mon Jul 13 21:02:09 2015 UTC,"Simple Green for old stuff, just soak the plastic parts in it for a bit.  Newer stuff, air compressor or shop vac... maybe a leaf blower?  Who am I kiddin, I dont clean shit."
rccars,3d5mqv,mercenario27,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:59:23 2015 UTC,To get mine really clean (and to find broken bent stuff). I'll tear my cars down to the chassis in between race days. And clean them with simple Green and a tooth brush.
rccars,3d5mqv,c0dy_sx,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:29:34 2015 UTC,Yea i was thinking it may be time to do so.

rccars,3d4q2j,Wasney,3,Mon Jul 13 14:40:30 2015 UTC,"Both hex screws stripped when I got to them. Looks like they had already been pretty bad from the previous owner. I plan on taking it to the shop tomorrow and seeing if they can get them out.  If not, a stock transmission is around $40, or a pro-line around $80.  Considered drilling through. Would only need to replace the two screws and the arm part from the differential. The differential is what is broke anyways. When I spin it there is a lot of popping and grinding. Can't get in without taking this side off though."
rccars,3d4q2j,Congzilla,3,Mon Jul 13 14:40:33 2015 UTC,You can get drill bits made for this at Home Depot.  It's actually really simple to get them out.
rccars,3d4q2j,Grimatoria,0,Mon Jul 13 15:36:29 2015 UTC,They don't work
rccars,3d4q2j,Scootin_Houten,3,Wed Jul 15 21:45:58 2015 UTC,"Usually for RC cars you can super glue a allen key in there, wait for it to dry and loosen it! I wouldn't recommend it on anything larger tho!"
rccars,3d4q2j,MofAwesometown,2,Mon Jul 13 16:40:05 2015 UTC,"Super glue has almost always worked for me, great suggestion!"
rccars,3d4q2j,yourbathroom,2,Mon Jul 13 17:23:15 2015 UTC,"Tried that, I think they are locktight or something. Heat didn't help. I have the screws from the other side to compare. May try to drill out with my smallest bit. Worse case I visit the shop tomorrow!"
rccars,3d4q2j,Nemesisllama,2,Mon Jul 13 18:46:12 2015 UTC,You can pull the female shaft off and then you can buy just the output ball from MIP if you happen to destroy it trying to get it off....
rccars,3d4q2j,Nemesisllama,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:53:29 2015 UTC,"Yupp, that is the plan if the shop breaks it. Figure I might as well start building a relationship with them! Lol."
rccars,3d4q2j,the_ike,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:59:10 2015 UTC,You could very carefully make a slot in it to use a small flathead screw driver. It's kinda a lazy way to do it and will mark the drive shaft a little but I've done it to remove stripped screws before. See if the hobby shop can help though.
rccars,3d4q2j,Max_Xevious,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:53:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't have a dremel, saw that online. Tried heating it with my soldering iron to loosen it, that didn't work. Tried drilling into it and slowly going into reverse with pressure. That didn't work. Even bought a screw extractor but it was too big. Need a micro set."
rccars,3d4q2j,Max_Xevious,3,Mon Jul 13 14:58:38 2015 UTC,It's a good device to have in this hobby. You can get a decent one at harbor freight for $25. They also have a really cheap one for $10
