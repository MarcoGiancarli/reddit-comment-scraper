After that, there are a couple B&W films that aren't likely, along with the Film Ventures International movies (City Limits, Being from Another Planet).  Fifteen in total if you include the Godzilla films, which are either expensive to license or not being licensed at all. That's not bad for a show with 100+ epsiodes.

Which is low but a lot of mst3k movie selections usually get closer to a 3 or 2.5 think some ppl gave it higher marks because of the casting heh

I'm a sucker for sword & sorcery anyway, but this movie just gives them so much to work with. The main character's acting is horrible, and to top it off he's completely unlikable. The host segments with Pearl are awful and those turn a lot of people off, but the movie riffing itself is amazing.

It's a movie that the director and producer clearly put a lot of effort into, it has a generally comprehensible story line, the voice acting, even for Roger Corman, isn't too bad.

MST3K,3b7yom,DrDougExeter,6,Sat Jun 27 03:42:40 2015 UTC,Cynicism. That's where I draw the line. There are films that are entirely self-aware and are a great time - something like Dead Snow or Tremors. The low-budget modern films ground out in a few weeks' time by the likes of Asylum feel like cynical cash-grabs.

On the other hand, James Nguyen is ""foreign"".  Just as with Tommy Wiseau, e (at least, I) kind of cut him a break because...well, does he know what he's up against?

I thought they were going to try to learn from the mistakes of the original and just rewrite the story a little, make it better paced, make Torgo and the master a bit creepier, and boom you would have a somewhat decent movie. Instead what they've decided to do is make an intentionally bad movie, which never ends well. Every good bad movie had people putting some heart into it. Intentionally making a bad movie is a horrid waste of time and it makes everyone question why they supported you in the first place.  tldr version: this is going to be worse than Hobgoblins 2."

But let this be a lesson to everyone to think twice before posting after pulling an all nighter that came on the heels of only getting about three hours sleep the night before, and trying to subsist mostly on coffee.  I mean seriously, even my warning and pseudo apology for the ridiculously and unnecessarily long post that follows is ridiculously and unnecessarily long itself!)  I'm kind of dissapointed in myself for not being able to think of any specific examples, even though I know there are a ton.  I first got into MST3K when I was about 10 or 11 years old, so you can imagine there were countless things I just didn't get.  I mostly watched it by myself or with my brother during the school year, then during summer I'd sometimes watch it during sleepovers with my cousins, and sometimes my mom and/or aunt (and of course the whole family for turkey day marathons!) As such, I remember a few times asking my mom and/or aunt about a joke, which usually resulted in a ""oh, uh, I don't get it either"" for the more raunchy stuff, or sometimes getting an actual explanation for the jokes that were suitable for the ears of a kid my age but that I just didn't get (but also sometimes getting an ""I have no idea"" response that was legit for some of the more obscure references, although growing up in WI I'm fortunate to have gotten a lot of their Midwestern references)   I'm the youngest in the family, my brother being four years older than myself, and my cousins being two and five years older.  Naturally, being so young, those age gaps made them so much wiser and world weary in my eyes, so I often turned to them for jokes I didn't get.  But sometimes even after being told, I still didn't get it, but pretended to so as to not look like a fool.    Nowadays, a big part of the joy of the show for me is that even today, nearly a quarter century later, I'm still discovering new parts to laugh at that I didn't get before. And not just the dirty, raunchy, and generally more adult orientated jokes, but also the pop culture references, or references to historical events and people, etc.  On a related note, that's also a huge reason I still love MASH, and rank it as easily being in my top three comedy series of all time, if not the greatest. I started watching it around the same time as MST3K, and my mom and I had this kind of nightly ritual on non-school nights.  It aired right after the 10 o'clock news, and my mom would often end her night by watching the news, followed by MASH and then whatever happened to air after MASH.  We had this huge blanket that we both loved, so I'd lay on the floor right up against the couch, and she'd drape the blanket over her and I and watch MASH until I fell asleep.  I still remember how excited I'd get when a Colonel Flagg episode would come on, because those were her and my favorites.  Compared to MASH though, MST3K was like the equivalent of a PG movie to MASH's R rating.  Not that MASH really was R rated, but there really are a ton more adult orientated jokes and themes, especially stuff like sexual jokes and innuendo.  So I probably only got about half the jokes the first couple years of watching it, and after about the 1000th ""you'll get it when you get older"", I just stopped asking for explanations all together."

MST3K,3az1z3,whyamionthissite,2,Wed Jun 24 23:39:06 2015 UTC,"I have only seen one legit. I bought Twilight for my wife and her friend, who are most assuredly NOT Mysties. They laughed so hard they had to pause the movie. I am thinking about easing in by buying another commentary track, probably for Star Wars Episode VI. Should be a good one. Do you have any recommendations? I love the shorts, so maybe I should look there?"

After that the Harry Potter tracks are also amazing.    Remember to try the VoDs too, I never would have gotten in to RTs if it wasn't for those. Nice and easy, buy, download, and it's yours!"

MST3K,3az1z3,circuitloss,2,Thu Jun 25 04:09:07 2015 UTC,"This is true. When they get too muffled, it's quite jolting to hear the difference between the film and the guys. I think I generally prefer color, but as long as the film isn't too dark and is a clean transfer it's usually good."
MST3K,3az1z3,TrickOrTreater,3,Thu Jun 25 13:13:48 2015 UTC,"Color, definitely. The pacing of the black and white movies is so slow and boring."
MST3K,3az1z3,UnicornToots,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:44:51 2015 UTC,"Color ones seem to have better bad music (if that makes sense).

MST3K,3afcp6,analogkid01,5,Fri Jun 19 19:00:39 2015 UTC,The movie takes place on what is supposed to be a vast colony ship.  They're just little carts to help workers and such get around.

MST3K,3afcp6,ConradBHart42,-12,Sat Jun 20 04:18:48 2015 UTC,"When I ask ""what are those stupid go-kart things,"" I'm asking for make/model, something along those lines.  I understand how they're used within the world of the movie.  Here's the joke you're re-enacting:  Two men are adrift in a hot air balloon, with no idea where they are or which way they're heading.  They come upon a tall office building and see an open window.  One of the men shouts out, ""Hey, can you tell me where I am??""  The guy in the office shouts back, ""You're in a hot air balloon.""  The man in the balloon smiles, knowing exactly where he is now, and navigates his way to his intended landing zone.  When his companion asks how that information was even remotely helpful, he says ""Well, given how useless his response was, I knew we were at the Microsoft headquarters, and that our landing zone was a mile to the east.""  It's funnier in the original Pashtun."
MST3K,3afcp6,analogkid01,11,Sat Jun 20 04:24:52 2015 UTC,"My answer isn't useless, but thanks for being insulting.  If you want a make/model ask for a make model.  They're movie props, which means they could be anything dressed up as something.  It's pretty common in car movies for instance, to take something with a similar frame and dress it up to look like something else,  because what they want to emulate is exceedingly rare and/or expensive.   Anyhow, if you really need to know the make and model, finding the prop master for the movie is your best bet, because it's a basic frame with a cheap custom shroud that they though looked suitably futuristic."

However, I really became a fan in college, when I would watch episodes to take a break from school work (and I had a lot of schoolwork).

MST3K,39q245,vegetaman,3,Sat Jun 13 17:44:46 2015 UTC,"I've a moderately similar story.  My dad was a -colossal- scifi buff. He watched the original Star Trek when it was on Sunday nights at 8 or whatever. He had me reading War of the Worlds when I was like, 10. He would absentmindedly draw schematics/blueprints for spaceships (he was a Machinist) while watching the Simpsons.  Well, that certainly influenced me immensely (though today, I suppose I'm more of a fantasy lover; I straddle both worlds, really). The first movie I ever saw in my entire life (Raffi tapes notwithstanding) was Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster. Since, I have been an inordinately passionate Godzilla fan. I have a whole book that I damn near sleep with just exploring the movies (A Critical History and Filmography of Toho's Godzilla Series, for the interested).  He died of cancer in 2008. I was 15 then, 22 now.  I don't know if he himself ever saw MST3K, but God, he would have been a truly passionate fan. I only stumbled across Joel and the Bots while poking around Youtube, and had no idea what I was getting into. But, in Joel, I can really see my dad. I mean, my dad was a big, dark-skinned fellow who suffered no bullshit (if a kid was being a bully, for example, he wouldn't go to the principal - he would go to the -kid-, personally, and ask what the deal was), but even as I was little, we would riff those movies, even before I knew what it meant to ""riff.""  One of the running gags was in King Kong vs. Godzilla, where Kong drinks a sleep-inducing berry juice, and just collapses to the ground, at which point I would mirror the action, and he'd say ""Night night Tommy!"" I was no older than 7. And I thought that was such a riot.  I'd voice the monster fights with my sister, like Crow does. We weren't in a very high rung on the financial ladder - not impoverished, but breaking even. Trips to Blockbuster were -amazing-. I got like the same five movies in random rotation, and renew the same old stupid riffs.  After finding MST3K... well, if I watch it attentively, sometimes it feels like he's still here. Not like reliving my days as a child, but like I'm 22 and he's 63. It's... odd, but in a great way.  Apologies for wall of text, I just wrote in a stream of consciousness."

MST3K,39q245,Miss_Interociter,3,Sun Jun 14 05:46:36 2015 UTC,"What MST3K means to me, sentimentally speaking, is, like most everyone else has said, watching on Saturday mornings with my dad.   My parents always refused to get cable when I was a kid, so my first exposure to the show happened when the show was briefly syndicated to local stations from Aug '95-Aug '96, so I was either 7 or 8. My parents had friends over, I couldn't sleep and I heard them all laughing in the living room. I went out there, and they were watching an old movie with a giant bald man and a tiny woman. The giant man gets mad, starts yelling, gets up and leaves. And then I heard a third voice from the row of seats on the bottom of the screen that I had just noticed. ""Oh, that's the problem: he was sitting on a bush!"". I eventually fell back asleep and was taken back to my room. I only later found out what that show and episode was later (309-Amazing Colossal Man).  The next brush with the show was probably in early 2001. My dad rented MST3K: The Movie from Blockbuster. We watched it and laughed. I would soon find other MST3K episodes at local Blockbusters in the area. The first two episodes rented were Manos and Mitchell. I watched them with a friend who had cable and who explained that the show was already cancelled.  Soon, I started finding the Rhino VHS's and DVD's at local stores and started growing my tiny collection. It wouldn't be until early 2002 that I discovered, when reading a TV guide, that MST3K was still being shown on the Sci-Fi Channel at 9 AM on Saturdays.   Since my house didn't have cable, I had my dad wake up and drive me to his office early on Saturdays to tape the show off the conference room TV/VCR. Ironically, the first episode I taped was Diabolik. My dad and I would do this Saturday ritual until later in the Fall when I discovered a tape-trader online and bought Seasons 2-10, minus the episodes I'd taped and the few episodes I was able to download off Kazaa. My parents withheld the cache of episodes until Christmas that year. The giant box of VHS tapes traveling cross-country with us to my grandmother's house in Wisconsin.  When Sci-Fi stopped renewing the re-runs, me and my dad made one last morning trip to his office to watch the last broadcast of MST3K on cable TV, 912-The Screaming Skull on January 31, 2004.  His office since closed. Everything was liquidated and they opened a skeleton office. But they saved the TV. Whenever I see it nowadays, I think back to those mornings with my dad. Me sitting on the floor, him in a chair drinking coffee. Both laughing."

Then, when I was about 12 or 13, a friend introduced me to the show and watching it with my dad and my brothers became a Saturday morning tradition.

The best response posited something I didn't think of but makes a lot of sense: The 50% off, everything must-go sale on MST3K.com, which seems indefinite at this point (its been going since May 9), might be Jim Mallon liquidating his stock, making one last big wad of cash before he sells off his share of BBI and MST3K to another party, to make way for a reboot.

MST3K,39d770,Tarlcabot18,2,Thu Jun 11 04:17:40 2015 UTC,"So I've seen that some people think BBI's big merch sale is actually Jim Mallon liquidating all of his mst3k merch in preparation for someone buying out the rest of the proprietary rights (and by extension, BBI) to make way for a reboot, and this is his last chance to make a bunch of money.  Anyone else buy this theory? There's some talk in another thread here about the reboot saying this sale is related to the reboot and that something is going to happen ""soon"".  I'd like to believe this, and was going to write a big post about it, but I want to see what everyone else thinks."
MST3K,39d770,Tarlcabot18,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:25:20 2015 UTC,It would be awesome if it turned out to be true. Although I think that Rifftrax would have to end for them to reboot MST3K.
MST3K,39d770,Bellstrom,2,Thu Jun 11 14:14:14 2015 UTC,"The only single person capable of buying out Jim at this point, besides Joel, is Mike.   Jim owns at the very least a 51% share. Joel owns, at most, 39%, since Jim and Joel started at 45% each and Jim now has a controlling share. Kevin and Trace both should still each have 5%.  Mike was left out, but since he bought Rifftrax lock, stock and barrel from Legend Films a few years ago, I'm assuming he's banked enough cash to buy Jim out of most of his share. The MST3K brand has to be more valuable tham Rifftrax, and if the opportunity arose, I can't imagine Mike passing up the chance.  And that solves a lot of problems with the reboot. It minimizes Jim and brings the Rifftrax guys back into the fold."
MST3K,39d770,ConradBHart42,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:38:35 2015 UTC,Very interesting... if you haven't already you should make a post about this. You make it seem quite possible

MST3K,396nw4,sdpcommander,5,Wed Jun 10 14:36:40 2015 UTC,It was alright. Mike was easily the funniest and had some of the most brutal jokes. He opened a with a JFK assassination joke.
MST3K,396nw4,rifftrax,2,Wed Jun 10 22:23:32 2015 UTC,It was pretty good. Better than other episodes of the show I've seen. I did feel like the timing was kind of awkward though. Not necessarily with the Rifftrax guys but with Hardwick's delivery of the segments/transitions.

They knew not everyone would get every joke, so the idea that someone is going to get every joke instantly 20 years later is a bit absurd.    except the really cheesy live-action skit sequences   They grow on you, especially Mike's big dumb mug.  Easy enough to skip if they're that bad for you.   and the topical references that are no longer topical.   I like these, personally.  They can give you some....perspective? into the kinds of things that used to be popular, and as I was growing up with MST3k, they made reference to a lot of the stuff my parents and grandparents enjoyed when they were younger.  As an aside, you've basically said ""I like the jokes I get"".  Which is fine.  At least you recognize that the jokes you don't get aren't an indication of your own intelligence.  I have an inkling that you would enjoy Rifftrax much more than trudging through the archives of MST3k.  The humor is all modern (sometimes surprisingly so) and rarely very obscure.  You can also choose to watch just short films, obscure films, or modern blockbusters.  They have a very good back catalog at this point.  There's also no skits interrupting the riffing.  (Riffing is what the fanbase has come to call the practice of telling jokes at the expense of the video being watched.)"
MST3K,394oxa,ConradBHart42,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:10:38 2015 UTC,"i have watched rifftrax and i actually enjoy it less. i enjoy the references i do get in MST3K, it just seems a bit daunting sometimes with so many of them. i prefer clever humor that's thought out as opposed to internet meme references and stuff like that, which rifftrax does sometimes. i'm a pretty knowledgable person, i don't want anyone to get the impression that i'm the kind of person who thinks family guy is top notch comedy and doesn't get clever references. it's just that i was born in 1994 and there's no way of me understanding a reference to a commercial motto from the 50s. i major in audio production in college, not all of existence. while i have a refined taste in comedy, there's stuff i can't help my ignorance in due to the fact that unless you're them, i guess you're just not going to understand absolutely everything. now i know that it's mean to be that way so i'm okay with it. i just felt like i was missing something."
MST3K,394oxa,profgray2,7,Thu Jun 11 08:55:41 2015 UTC,"An MIT study. Yes they did one, found that an mst3k episode averages 350 jokes each. (that is off the top of my head. So may be wrong, but it was in that area. I remember)  Each show had jokes ranging from sports (which I never get) to literature, to Shakespeare, to TV, topical news, and geek life.   So more or less expect to miss some of the jokes no matter what. This is just part of the charm.   And as the song says....   Remember that it's just a show, I should really just relax....."
MST3K,394oxa,IlllllIIlllIIllIIIII,2,Tue Jun 9 08:09:23 2015 UTC,"wow that's fascinating. i really appreciate the attention to detail in the show. the cultural awareness. the intelligence mixed with silliness is what i love about the humor. though i was wondering if i'd really enjoy much more if i didn't understand some of the references. you'd have to be an incredibly aware genius to understand absolutely all of the random, rapid fire jokes. thank you for helping me understand that it's okay if i don't understand some of the jokes.  upon looking over the wikipedia timeline of actors, i see that there are a couple different set-ups. and i've read that the show has a different feel depending on them. do you personally have a preferred era of the show? just out of curiosity, i'm interested in your opinion."
MST3K,394oxa,Invisible-Gorilla,-1,Tue Jun 9 09:08:35 2015 UTC,"""Just relax"" relates solely to science facts. It has nothing to do with missing jokes. I really wish people would stop abusing that phrase.   OP, I would just Google any joke you don't understand and soon you'll be up to speed."
MST3K,394oxa,IlllllIIlllIIllIIIII,5,Tue Jun 9 11:10:30 2015 UTC,It's just a song. It's not a holy commandment or scientific law. Just relax.
MST3K,394oxa,Somethingmorbid,-1,Tue Jun 9 19:19:42 2015 UTC,I agree. Stop quoting it to tell people to stop thinking about their favorite show.

MST3K,394oxa,sgtcarter,2,Tue Jun 9 14:54:06 2015 UTC,"Also keep in mind that the show is 25 years old so there will inevitably be jokes that are no longer topical. However, even so, they really love making obscure jokes - some that you wouldn't get even if you are a pop culture expert.  One such example is the ""Stop her, she stole Mike's keyboard!"" riff used in several episodes - a reference to a ex-girlfriend of Mike Nelson's who, when they broke up, stole his keyboard. I only learned the origin reference when I read the Amazing Colossal Episode Guide.  With your favorite episodes/shorts, it's fun to either Google the riffs that go over your head or (my favorite) one day you accidentally stumble upon the reference yourself and laugh out loud. Then you can impress your friends and enemies with your own obscure pop culture knowledge."

MST3K,394oxa,nomad_mali,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:58:04 2015 UTC,"Dude you ask a great question and it deserves many answers, this being one.  In a number of different episodes you'll hear Mike riff ""I thought you were Dale"".  This is from an old Grape Nuts commercial featuring ""Mrs. Burke"" (who is the pretty Dale's mom) and Dale's boyfriend at the family pool.  The BF splashes Mrs. Burke and says ""Mrs. Burke?  I...I thought you were Dale!""  That's how young Grape Nuts will make you look.  His ""I...I...I"" stammering reminds me of Mikey from Teenage Strangler, which to me is the most hysterical MST3k of all.  YouTube search for I Thought You Were Dale and you can watch this stupid f'in commercial.  Knowing the source makes the riffs all that much better so good luck!"

Heck, I actually have downloaded every single episode over the years. At one point, I was backing them up on video DVDs (with home-made menus, and everything ). I've got about 120 discs worth of 'em burned, but stopped once I bought my first 1TB hard drive. However, I still buy the sets when they are released. I know, I'm retarded."

Like the missing bumpers, stingers, title cards, etc. If they do Volume 2, I’d like the MST Hour wraps for 301 and 303.

I ended up ripping the video and came close to re-adjusting the audio line by line before I realised I'd rather saw off my own head.  Now the set just sits on my shelf, collecting dust. I'd rather buy a new version which fixes this issue, then the rest in the same format so the spines have a nice appearance on my shelf.  [edit] Either that or a release of the episodes in broadcast order. That'd be neat.  [editedit] Oh, and subtitles! For the love of God, subtitles! Please let my dad be able to watch MST3K!"

So the idea may not have been Joel's in the first place.   Secondly, the skit could fit anywhere in the show's history.  If it had taken place in season one or season ten, it would be just as funny and just as in-character.  Third, I don't think there are any other bits on the show that intentionally mirror behind the scenes drama.   why did he select ""The Seven Faces of Dr. Lao."" as the source for his plaque quote? Is the joke that he selected a quote from a crappy movie because he loves crappy movies?   Man, if you have to ask, you'll never know."

MST3K,3884l4,SelfreferentialUser,4,Tue Jun 2 16:34:08 2015 UTC,The strange bit is that Joel explicitly and vehemently denies this connection.   I don’t think you understand how testimony works.

MST3K,3884l4,bill_clay,4,Tue Jun 2 15:56:16 2015 UTC,"Not officially, but the concept remains the same. He himself has refuted your claim; you’ll have to provide some additional evidence other than “I don’t believe him” for it to hold."

Joel left MST3K over a couple of different issues:  1) Who was going to direct MST3K:TM, and the writing process surrounding the film.  Joel wanted a more egalitarian approach in terms of who would direct the movie, Jim wanted Joel to focus all his energy in front of the camera.    2) The fact that his partner (Jim) wasn't really interested in producing anything at BBI other than MST3K (and outside of interpersonal relationship issues, this is largely cited as the same reason Trace left).  3) Joel's innate need to challenge himself, and not stagnate."

Joel won't sign off on any further prints, so no end to the sale until everything is gone.  MST3K reboot to follow inventory liquidation. Right? Am I right?"
MST3K,384y4a,bill_clay,3,Tue Jun 2 03:01:38 2015 UTC,I hope he does. Nobody on the outside of the situation knows for sure but it sure seems like Mallon's been the source of all the behind-the-scenes issues with MST3K.

MST3K,37lmap,mrboston9,1 point,Fri May 29 14:55:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback.  I originally had the seats much lower, but when I staged it onto a shirt, it just didn't look as good as I had imagined. Perhaps if I made the seats larger (and fewer) it might work out better. Going all the way around would be cool, and it was an idea that had occurred to me, but I'm not sure how practical that could be to print. But I agree it's a cool concept.  I'm not sure how well it would work without the text - that was in fact the original intent of the design - to take the instruction and turn it into an actual, usable mantra. I think without the text then the silhouettes are just pointing at the wearer's torso, which is kinda weird.   It's interesting that your response was that there wasn't much thought put into it - there was actually quite a bit, but your feedback is appreciated. :)"

MST3K,36rncw,JLSMC,11,Thu May 21 16:05:20 2015 UTC,"When BBI was founded, everything was split thusly:  Joel: 45%  Jim: 45%  Kevin: 5%  Trace: 5%  Josh: Screwed for being underage.  One of the sticking points in the contract BBI signed with HBO and The Comedy Channel in 1989 was that BBI retained all the rights to the show. So everything is owned by BBI, not the networks or their owners.  Joel, Kevin and Trace have all said in one place or another that they all get residuals still, so I'm assuming those 4 get their respective percentages. Though I've assumed Joel sold some of his stake to Jim when he left, as it's been stated that Jim owns a controlling share.  Everyone else gets bupkis. Which was one of the points of contention with Jim and the rest of the cast in the later years of the show when the Rhino VHS's started being released and everyone realized that the proprietary split would be a source of income in the future.  Of course, that's just the BBI side. Shout! takes a big cut, too, as to pay for the agreements with the rights-holders for the films, production of DVD's, marketing, Turkey Day, etc."
MST3K,36rncw,Tarlcabot18,8,Thu May 21 16:40:57 2015 UTC,"One of the sticking points in the contract BBI signed with HBO and The Comedy Channel in 1989 was that BBI retained all the rights to the show. So everything is owned by BBI, not the networks or their owners.   Man they were lucky they got in on Comedy Central when they were still a fledgling network. No way CC would agree to that kind of deal now."
MST3K,36rncw,sleepsholymountain,3,Thu May 21 17:21:45 2015 UTC,"Indeed, it would be almost unthinkable nowadays anywhere. But, unfortunately it's one of those things that work against them if they ever want to reboot the show."
MST3K,36rncw,Tarlcabot18,2,Thu May 21 17:24:42 2015 UTC,Why is that? You'd think having exclusive rights to the show without having to get permission from (or give money to) Comedy Central or the Syfy Channel would make it easier for them to do a reboot at any network/studio they want. Is it just because Jim Mallon and/or Joel would have to sign off on it and they don't want to?
MST3K,36rncw,sleepsholymountain,3,Thu May 21 19:02:01 2015 UTC,"Jim Mallon has final say on everything, and he is on good terms with no one."

MST3K,36rncw,bill_clay,2,Fri May 22 03:46:57 2015 UTC,"Partially. What I'm mostly talking about is that a network wouldn't be getting much. The network has to front the costs of production, negotiate and pay for film rights (which has gotten much harder since the 90's), market the show and take up 2 hours of airtime.   They can't put out the DVD's and make money that way, they don't own the show. The best they can hope for is advertising money from sponsors if there's good ratings. And that's a big if.  It's a risky proposition to make, pay for and air a show you probably won't make your money back on."
MST3K,36rncw,Tarlcabot18,3,Thu May 21 19:40:46 2015 UTC,I would think that a network would be able to make a different deal for any new episodes that were made with their money. They would take their percentage off of the top and the rest would be split under the old agreement.
MST3K,36rncw,TheCarrzilico,3,Fri May 22 01:56:31 2015 UTC,Trey Parker got a similarly good deal for South Park.  If I remember correctly he retained all digital distribution rights to the show (this was back when streaming video wasn't really a thing yet)

He wasn't a polished performer or a great writer   I realize Josh went on to become a genuine talent, but including him as a founder at that point would have been a significant risk, since he might never have developed his talent properly if he only stayed in the MST3k bubble like the rest.  Let's not forget that if he hadn't left MST3k we probably wouldn't have Freaks and Geeks or the other Josh projects you all love.    Buy hey, if you want to start up your own business, and give an 18 year old a significant stake of ownership in it, by all means feel free.

Although several movies were bought 'in bulk' (I.e. The show made one deal to obtain multiple films) most episodes are one-off contracts the producers had to sign for the rights holders for each individual film.   My understanding is this is the principle reason why there is no master box set with every episode. The rights you'd need to obtain to release over 200 films on DVD from literally all over the film industry makes such a prospect nearly impossible.   I don't know if this answers your question..."

I do recall in Sidehackers when everyone was telling jokes (near the end) before the ambush, one guy uses the slur 'faggot' and Joel and the bots are like ""Oh no!"", etc. Whereas in Werewolf when the caretaker says something about ""dracula being a faggot"" it goes unnoticed. Now, Mike is definitely more right leaning with Joel the other way. I don't see Mike as being  homophobic (at least he doesn't publicly decry homosexuality) but there were different writers. Joel wasn't on the set anymore and neither was Frank (a known and sometimes, annoying, far left guy). I don't view either of them as misogynistic or homophobic, maybe they just didn't notice certain things that could be offensive? Just my thoughts anyway."

MST3K,35i3ds,xiaxian1,9,Sun May 17 01:01:34 2015 UTC,Castle of Fu Manchu has always been the hardest for me. The guys try - lord knows they try - but it's not particularly funny and the plot makes no sense. I've tried watching it many times and to this day I couldn't tell you what it was about.   So Castle of Fu Manchu is my 'worst'.
MST3K,35i3ds,fnordx,2,Mon May 11 03:54:53 2015 UTC,"I totally agree.  It was the one movie that totally broke Joel and the bots, and Frank and Dr. Forrester as well, even worse than Manos."

MST3K,35i3ds,ConradBHart42,3,Wed May 13 02:34:51 2015 UTC,"The movie is so terrible and inept that it can't help but be a serviceable episode.  One of the hardest episodes for me to get through, ever, is The Projected Man.   Aside from the Lembach bit, there is absolutely nothing about that episode (let alone the movie) that captures my attention.  It's quite possibly the most British film on the show, challenged only by The Deadly Bees (which is a good episode, in my opinion).   So, one of the things that defines the Joel era vs Mike era (aside the obvious) is the style of film.  This might not be apparent to younger viewers.  Before the internet, you wasted weekend afternoons on the couch, in front of a TV, watching whatever movies your local TV stations (you know, before cable made it big) could afford the rights to play.  If it wasn't a big network affiliate, you'd get stuff like Pod People, City Limits, or Warrior of the Lost world.  In retrospect, it's clear that by the time of Joel's departure, they were running out of these campy sorts of films and moving on to anything that was vintage but not a recognized classic, and eventually on to movies that were home rental cash-grabs."

I don't know if the unethical behavior of a scientific foundation's bureaucracy as it relates to one of its grantees is the best plot setting for a horror movie. ""And the plot thinnens"" is one of the universal use rifts, though."
MST3K,35i3ds,ConradBHart42,2,Mon May 11 16:24:22 2015 UTC,"I don't get how the plot ""thickening"" is supposed to be a good thing.  In TPM it does exactly that;  like a bowl of porridge left to sit, it congeals into a hard, unpalatable mess.  The ambiance of the movie is positively dry (aka British) and from my unreliable memory, the pacing of the dialog and set-up in the beginning is very spacious.  Absolutely no chemistry or atmosphere.  Not to mention, everything in the film is so NORMAL.  The only thing that requires any suspension of disbelief is that this guy can touch people to kill them with electrical burns, and that this happened as a science experiment gone wrong.  In contrast, TISCWSLABMUZ starts out with a drunken carnival patron refusing to boink a witch, and then becoming an acid-faced zombie.    I realize that's a high bar, and that they don't all need to have some element of absurdity to be a good episode.  I just think that's what makes really good episodes.  They need something to sink their teeth into, solid ground to plant their feet onto.    Maybe I'll give TPM another go.  I feel like I'm being REALLY hard on it compared to other similar films I actually like."

MST3K,3480ga,ComebackShane,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:59:04 2015 UTC,"Pyrography:       Pyrography or pyrogravure is the art of decorating wood or other materials with burn marks resulting from the controlled application of a heated object such as a poker. It is also known as pokerwork or wood burning.  The term means ""writing with fire"", from the Greek pur (fire) and graphos (writing).  It can be practiced using specialized modern pyrography tools, or using a metal implement heated in a fire, or even sunlight concentrated with a magnifying lens. ""Pyrography dates from the 17th century and reached its highest standard in the 19th century. In its crude form it is pokerwork.""    A large range of tones and shades can be achieved. Varying the type of tip used, the temperature, or the way the iron is applied to the material all create different effects. After the design is burned in, wooden objects are often coloured. Light-coloured hardwoods such as sycamore, basswood, beech and birch are most commonly used, as their fine grain is not obtrusive. However, other woods, such as pine or oak, are also used. Pyrography is also applied to leather items, using the same hot-iron technique. Leather lends itself to bold designs, and also allows very subtle shading to be achieved. Specialist vegetable-tanned leather must be used for pyrography (as modern tanning methods leave chemicals in the leather which are toxic when burned), typically in light colours for good contrast.

MST3K,33hzcu,lolzergrush,13,Wed Apr 22 19:34:00 2015 UTC,"Avoid a lot of the ""top episodes"" because they tend to feature truly awful movies, and those can be hard to get into. These tend to be slow-paced and hard on the eyes, which is a common mistake for showing newcomers. Movies like Manos, Pod People, and The Starfighters are really terrible and that makes them great for hardcore fans, but they can be a huge turn-off for newbies.  Go with something featuring a more recent movie (70's or 80's), along the lines of epic fantasy or sci-fi depending on what they're into. The bottom line is no guy is going to get into an episode if he's not into that type of movie.  Suggestions:   For fantasy, go with Deathstalker and the Warriors from Hell. It's not too slow-paced, and the SoL segments are great. Mary Jo Pehl was probably at her absolute worst in this episode, but just explain lie that she was brand new to the show. If he's into Bond flicks, show him Operation Double 007. Tell him it's the most obscure of Connery's Bond movies (it's technically true!) and that it's a lot of fun. It starts out strong so you don't have to worry about attention span. For martial arts movies go with Master Ninja 1..or 2. There's not really any continuity except for the hamster. Both of these episodes are a lot of fun for a newbie and they were serious attempts to make a TV show, so it's not that hard to watch. For sci-fi go with Overdrawn at the Memory Bank. This one is probably the ""least horrible"" movie that tends to get on a lot of top episode lists.  If none of those genres appeal to him, just punt and show him Angel's Revenge. We're guys, we're easy. We like boobs. This is a movie with a lot of them and you're the one picking it, so you can't really lose. The runner-up would be ""Alien from L.A."" but Kathy Ireland's voice is high-pitched enough to cause sonic castration, so I'd avoid it.   Finally don't expect any guy to be really into it for a whole two hours. It's important that you pick something that's interesting right from the start because newbies always lose interest in the first 15 minutes. If he's really into you then he'll stay around for a while longer just to be with you, and if he's not then don't waste all this great advice on him.  edit: typo in link"

While never a particularly mainstream actor, Baker achieved brief fame from starring in the extremely popular 1973 film Walking Tall.  Later, he was cast as CIA agent Jack Wade in the Bond film GoldenEye which was originally intended to be a recurring character in future Bond films, but in the end he only appeared in one more, Tomorrow Never Dies.

MST3K,33hzcu,StupidTVBeMoreFunny,17,Wed May 6 05:32:20 2015 UTC,"My wife & I both love MST3K (not to mention Rifftrax, Cinematic Titanic, and now Other Space). We met in early '96 and were both already fans of the show. We went to the movie together on one of our first dates. To this day, we watch at least a little MST3K every night before bed. MST3K is quite possibly an embarrassingly (not really) large part of our relationship."
MST3K,33hzcu,et11robot,6,Wed Apr 22 19:20:15 2015 UTC,I automatically upvote any comment that mentions Other Space. We're gonna make Season Two happen!

MST3K,33hzcu,yodamaster103,2,Wed Apr 22 21:15:55 2015 UTC,"damn, I was one years old back then, sometimes I forget how old this show is, I guess that proves how timeless it is"
MST3K,33hzcu,missysk8,12,Thu Apr 23 06:43:27 2015 UTC,"Back when I was single I introduced a few boyfriends to the show and I never met one who didn't like it. I never considered it a requirement, but I don't think I would have gotten too serious about someone who didn't like the show.    I'm definitely the MST fan in my marriage. My husband likes it and has probably watched every episode at least once with me, but in my absence probably wouldn't watch it much.    He can quote Pumaman, Track of the Moonbeast and Werewolf with the best of them, and he is pretty gracious about my constant references to the jokes. But I am no longer allowed to shout out Johnny Longbow's stew ingredients any time he is trying to make a list...    We both like Rifftrax and especially the live shows. Our son likes Rifftrax, too and goes to the live shows with us."
MST3K,33hzcu,Homer_Jr,8,Wed Apr 22 18:56:00 2015 UTC,My wife and I are married because of MST3k.  We would watch an episode or two at the end of most of our dates.

I figure if I can find a guy who knows one of the references I mentioned, it'd be all good... though I think MST3K takes preference (after religion and politics, of course). My dad and I are the only MSTies in the family, and I'd love to have a husband who would get my MSTieness and the unique sense of humor that results."
MST3K,33hzcu,lolzergrush,5,Wed Apr 22 20:16:01 2015 UTC,"""the Richard Basehart to my Gypsy.""   Around here this would have gotten you a few marriage proposals, a couple flower bouquets in Servo-shaped vases, and a guy serenading you outside your bedroom window dressed up like Torgo and wobbling his knees while singing Idiot Control Now."

There's a woman in my MST3k Meetup Group who I know is single and looking, I think she's really cute and I'm into redheads, and she named her kids after two comic book characters... but I find her politics and religion to be irreconcilable with mine.  Which, you know, hey, MSTies really can be all stripes, and I firmly believe that MSTies are good people, but it can't fix everything."
MST3K,33hzcu,AlfishKK,5,Wed May 6 05:36:36 2015 UTC,"My  husband and I both love it. He used to watch it when he was little, so he got me into it, but I'd say we love it equally."

MST3K,33hzcu,Vriess,5,Wed Apr 22 20:44:15 2015 UTC,"My wife and I are currently in the middle of a near-nightly marathon of every non KTMA episode of MST3K (due to how hard the KTMA eps are to watch picture and quality-wise) and we have had a blast! As of this writing we are on episode 419 ""The Rebel Set"" tonight.  The fun part is sharing our adventure on Twitter (@jypsy) and having other fans and sometimes those from the show chime in here and there. It really has become a special bonding time in a strange way.   Some episodes she really can't get into, -especially this season, and I can't blame her- but some like The Beatniks she enjoyed simply because it was truly that terrible but watchable.   She was semi-familiar with the show prior to us meeting in 2002 but wasn't as big of a fan as I was.  That is of course changing now, and we are both lamenting the fact we are unable to go to C2E2 and meet the cast of Other Space this weekend and share our experiment with Trace and Joel personally.   It takes a special kind of person to put up with their partner's cheesy movies. It takes an even more special person to dive in alongside them."

I should have built up to it instead of going straight for the gold.  She actually asks to watch the enforcer chase scenes regularly, because it cracks her up."
MST3K,33hzcu,megamikeman,4,Wed Apr 22 19:16:58 2015 UTC,Has she seen Puma Man yet?

Recently single. My most recent ex gave it a go a couple times. Few chuckles here and there. She did buy me tickets to Rifftrax Live: Anaconda aka in Durham where they did the broadcasting and I could tell she was there strictly for my benefit. She did always complain about how many of the DVDs I own though.  If I could find someone who was as into it as I am thatd be fantastic. But id understand if they didnt catch on. MST3K is an.... acquired taste. But I would never stop watching it."
MST3K,33hzcu,au79,4,Wed Apr 22 21:10:00 2015 UTC,"She's absolutely into it. I introduced her to it early in our relationship, and now it's one of our favourite things to watch and quote together."

MST3K,33hzcu,Cornan_KotW,3,Wed Apr 22 18:47:42 2015 UTC,"My wife is mostly bored by MST3K itself as in her opinion some of the movies they do are irredeemable by any amount of jokes.  She has very very much enjoyed some of the Rifftrax though, particularly Aeon Flux and Daredevil.    ""And floors to keep us from falling all the time""  and   ""I'm gonna get soooo nude""  are permanent fixtures in our joke lexicon."
MST3K,33hzcu,LindyKatelyn,3,Wed Apr 22 19:52:16 2015 UTC,"On our third date my now fiance showed me Invader Zim which I had never seen. I loved it. So on our fourth date I showed her the MST3K episode of Gamera. She...didn't hate it.  Over the years she's seen pretty much every episode at least once thanks to my habit of putting on MST3K while I play video games. She's now a casual fan and can throw around references at will. We both enjoy introducing our friends to episodes they haven't seen when we can trick them into coming over for dinner.  I don't have to have an SO who loves MST3K, but I doubt someone who HATED it would put up with me long enough for me to dump them. I put on almost an episode a day."
MST3K,33hzcu,sleepsholymountain,3,Wed Apr 22 21:43:39 2015 UTC,"My boyfriend doesn't watch it with me. It's kind of a bummer, but I don't often meet people that do. I do improv comedy now and I've tried to explain to him that I got my sense of humor from watching MST3K as a kid. He just won't sit down and watch it. He did enjoy Other Space though. I also encourage you to go to the live show alone. I've gone to a lot of the live broadcasts in theaters alone. Better to go solo than not at all."
MST3K,33hzcu,Miss_Interociter,3,Wed Apr 22 23:26:51 2015 UTC,My fianceé and I watched the Laserblast episode on our first date.

He also likes Monty Python and Black Adder, so it's really not a surprise he watched MST3K. I'm a more hardcore fan than he is, but he loves Danger!! Death Ray, This Island Earth, Prince of Space and Mr. B Natural and assorted other episodes/shorts.  We now have two little 7 year old MSTlets who ask us if we're ready for some football and bellow ""NORMAL VIEEWWW!"" around the house."

MST3K,33hzcu,BlasphemousWords,2,Wed Apr 22 19:33:59 2015 UTC,"My wife loves the humor and the characters. As weird, young teens, we each used to tape syndicated episodes aired late on a local TV station. These days, she retains her love of the jokes/characters, but as a busy adult she doesn't want to use up 2 hours of life to watch a bad movie. We did go to see Cinematic Titanic live together (Astral Factor) and both loved it."
MST3K,33hzcu,VeryMacabre,2,Wed Apr 22 20:50:36 2015 UTC,My girlfriend watched it before we met and our mutual love of the show was one of the things that we really connected on at first.  MST3K love connection

MST3K,33hzcu,Kicktoria,2,Thu Apr 23 01:49:22 2015 UTC,"My girl really prefers Rifftrax only b/c she knows the movies themselves, I can live with it.  Few days ago we started to watch the Star Wars saga & she forgot how bad EP 1-3 were. I smiled, & switched the audio to the Rifftrax commentary.  It reeeeaaaally helped her get through it (to me a true fan watches them all, good & bad). Her fav still is Twilight.....""LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLadys"""

I have friends who have met (and married) through their love of MST3K. One of my favorite couples met because he had an MST3K sticker on his car, she left a note on his windshield telling him how awesome he is for liking MST3K, they met, and fell in love. Seriously, MSTie love can be the best love.   I usually go to Rifftrax Live by myself. It never bothers me, though, because I'm so focused on the funny. I also tend to make new friends at the show, so that's always a plus. :)   edit: words"

MST3K,33hzcu,Quite_Intangible,1 point,Thu Apr 23 10:14:33 2015 UTC,"I found out my wife used to watch it occasionally in high school. I had just about all the boxed DVDs up to the point we met (seven+ years ago). So, basically I got her 'reacquainted' with the show and we've seen just about every single episode multiple times. She likes all the classic episodes that have been brought up. I think she even enjoys Riff Trax a bit more than I do. :)  When it comes to dating and finding people with the same interests I always just hoped that the person would have a few shared interests. As long as there was something we could enjoy doing together I was happy. I think it's important to have things in common and then a few other things that you can do on your own. I'd consider MST3K fandom to be more of a 'bonus' trait than a deal breaker.  Good luck finding someone. I know they are out there. I plan on introducing our kid to it once he gets a little older (he's two) to keep the flame alive!"

Not always a good thing, but shows like that always evolve to find their sweet spot of comedy."
MST3K,33i2q8,microchannelplate,8,Wed Apr 22 19:49:34 2015 UTC,I've really enjoyed it. I want to see the crew walk in on Zalian and Art watching bad movies and cracking jokes...
MST3K,33i2q8,MogMcKupo,7,Wed Apr 22 22:40:54 2015 UTC,Or even just an off comment that is a HUGE nod to MST.  Like they come in back and Zalian is talking about working at this placed called Deep 13 and having a moment with this Janitor...'wonder whatever happened to him'
MST3K,33i2q8,NeutroBlaster96,8,Wed Apr 22 23:16:36 2015 UTC,"Love it. It was pretty damn good, like Red Dwarf with a Star Trek sized cast."
MST3K,33i2q8,smithrr3,4,Wed Apr 22 20:39:12 2015 UTC,Definitely reminds me of Red Dwarf.   I really like it!
MST3K,33i2q8,et11robot,4,Wed Apr 22 22:12:02 2015 UTC,"I really liked it. I was surprised right off the bat how good the pilot was, since pilots have to do so much heavy lifting just getting all the characters introduced and into place. Then it just kept getting better. The whole cast really pulls their weight (even Michael, whose whole character is about being unnoticed and underestimated).  I love how you get more and more little details as the show goes on about how society and technology have changed in the future."
MST3K,33i2q8,zakktravis,2,Wed Apr 22 20:58:37 2015 UTC,"It's my new favorite!  Been watching an episode at a time, here and there, since someone mentioned it in this sub.  Joel and Trace are absolutely great.  Joel saying of his fantasy tuna sandwich, ""it doesn't have to be on the ground,"" is still cracking me up."
MST3K,33i2q8,analogkid01,6,Wed Apr 22 22:57:03 2015 UTC,Love it - can't wait for season 2.  I wonder what convinced Joel to take an on-camera role again.

MST3K,33i2q8,analogkid01,2,Thu Apr 23 01:17:10 2015 UTC,"I wonder what convinced Joel to take an on-camera role again.   There's this green paper that people trade for goods and services.  I imagine it played a role.  There's probably also a certain appeal that he's not a creative honcho (to my understanding) on this show and he just gets to show up, mess around with Trace, and go home at the end of the day.  Maybe they let him design the robot."
MST3K,33i2q8,ryantherobot,2,Thu Apr 23 23:10:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but remember...  ""Eventually I got asked to be in a Michael J. Fox sitcom called High School U.S.A. I didn’t think it was funny and said no. They doubled the money, and that kind of offended me. I realized, oh, that’s right, my opinion means nothing in Hollywood. I’d seen other people compromise, and I felt that once you gave up on what you wanted to do, you couldn’t go back. It was selling out. So I decided to go back to Minneapolis.""  (And just for fun, another odd Joel quote...)  ""Film distributors would do this trick where they’d license you several movies. Half of them might be movies you’d heard of, and half were the movies we actually wanted, the B movies. We didn’t want the cocaine—we wanted the baby laxative they put in the cocaine."""
MST3K,33i2q8,polakbob,3,Sun Apr 26 00:12:51 2015 UTC,"Loved it! I just finished the season yesterday and I can't wait to watch it again. However, episode 6 is the worst, and if it weren't for a big moment at the end, I would say skip it. Other than that, great show."
MST3K,33i2q8,analogkid01,3,Wed Apr 22 20:57:07 2015 UTC,"Pleasantly surprised. The first trailer I saw made me gag a little. First episode ended just interesting enough to make me bite for episode 2. By the end of the 2nd episode, I was sold. I love this show."

MST3K,33i2q8,xiaxian1,1 point,Thu Apr 23 07:43:45 2015 UTC,The pilot is a little rough because there are a lot of characters and situations to set up. After a couple of episodes the show finds itself a nice groove.

MST3K,33i2q8,DiscoJer,2,Fri Apr 24 00:48:40 2015 UTC,I'm really enjoying it. Starting second viewing of it.  The one thing that bugs me is Trace's voice - it sounds like a voiceover (which it probably is) instead of recorded at the same time as the other voices. I'd like it if they could get his voice sounding more 'inclusive'. It just kind of takes me out of it a little.
MST3K,33i2q8,JakeWasHere,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:42:53 2015 UTC,"I hadn't noticed his voice sounding off, but I wasn't really paying attention. I will try on my next watch-thru."
MST3K,33i2q8,JacksonBigDog,2,Thu Apr 23 06:30:34 2015 UTC,"Much, much better than I anticipated. Once the show got past the mediocre pilot, it became consistently hilarious very fast. The banter between the crew members is sharp and witty, and the show keeps track of its continuity for some clever long-running gags.  This show has all the makings of a cult classic. I would be very disappointed if they didn't get a second season."
MST3K,33i2q8,CaptainWackee,2,Thu Apr 23 05:41:20 2015 UTC,I hope so to. Imagine if Star Trek:TNG had been cancelled after season one? Because that season sucked hard. Or if MST3K had never made it past the KTMA episodes? I say they should give it a chance.
MST3K,33i2q8,JacksonBigDog,1 point,Thu Apr 23 06:28:07 2015 UTC,Terrible. Had to stop watching it because it was so awful.

MST3K,33b1ul,GurillaTacticz,4,Tue Apr 21 12:20:37 2015 UTC,"I remember they showed us the room where they would all watch the movies they were riffing. They had to watch them over and over again, while coming up with jokes. Imagine watching a movie like Manos several times in a row!  The ""movie studio"" wasn't a movie studio. The ""chairs"" you see behind them was actually a long cutout in the shape of seats, painted black. They would sit on the floor with those behind them (Kevin and Trace/Bill pretty much lying on the floor) and watch the movie on a monitor on the floor in front of them.   For the movie segments, they had a special Crow and Tom, both painted matte black. Tom's head was painted over you couldn't see through it.   Since they had the castle set and the SoL bridge set right across from each other, they would literally just turn the camera around to face whichever set they wanted to film. The camera was right in the middle of the two areas.   Cambot was very delicate, which is why they almost never used him.   Our tour guide (Beeze, I think?) forbade us from raiding the fridge in the breakroom when someone asked :P She was also the one who would take pictures of people standing by the props. She took one of me with Tom on the bridge, and another of me standing next to the spaghetti ball. I'd guess the ball was about 4' in diameter, it was much bigger than I expected it to be!   All in all, it looked like a really down-to-earth place, not all that fancy. I have to think that working there was a lot like just hanging out with your friends. And watching really horrible movies, of course."
MST3K,33b1ul,NecroJoe,5,Tue Apr 21 15:18:02 2015 UTC,Now I really want the painting of Crow squishing tiny Tom Servos.

First full episode available is KTMA 4, as no fans out there have surviving tapes earlier than that.  Edit:  Downvote me all you want. Doesn't change the fact that this mega-stoned segment https://youtu.be/cGDQ0E2HbYk?t=4m38s and jokes such as ""The million slanty eyes of Sumaru"" are not things that Joel is probably that proud of or wants wider circulation for.

That yipes stripes song is not only amazingly goofy, but is so badly overdone and poorly dubbed that I don't even think the girl even sang that song.

Our family enjoyed owning the video store for 18 years. We were one of those big independent video super stores and had over 40,000 items for rent including movies on VHS, DVD and laserdisc, all formats of games and audiobooks.  It was a pleasure as a movie lover to introduce our boys to different types of movies as they grew up. I'm glad both of them enjoyed MST3K movies and shorts.

Nowadays more than ever there are ways for people to easily let the fan community know what they're up to, if that's what they want. If they'd rather be left alone then they won't.

They do have a sci-fi framing premise, but it's more of a throwaway gag and doesn't come up during the films.  There are a couple of physical gags.    It's 100% worth it if you're the sort of person that likes to purchase media and you have the resources.  I know they sold DVDs of the first few that were very bare-bones, not sure if there's been some grander release since.   You can watch a whole bunch on Hulu if you're in the states, full films."
MST3K,3276xm,ConradBHart42,2,Sat Apr 11 04:56:46 2015 UTC,"Cinematic Titanic is great. It's pretty hard to find it for free, and it's artist funded so you're better off paying. If you have amazon prime it's on there. The dvds can get really cheap as well."

Sylvester declined to reprise his role in the film 2010: The Year We Make Contact (1984), in which he was replaced by Roy Scheider. Scheider is generally regarded as having been mis-cast for the part, with the vast difference in mannerisms and appearance between Sylvester and Scheider such that the roles have periodically been mistaken for different characters [(http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-william-sylvester-1611159.html).

It's not a huge stretch to go from bad movies to bad tv shows, and of course they had a large back-catalog to choose from.   I'm not sure what year this took place in, I'd imagine like 96 or 97.  Ultimately MST3k's fatal flaw is that it didn't fit neatly into genre labels.  It didn't handle comedy movies well, and that's what CC had in droves.  When it went to sci-fi, it was easy for execs and sci-fi fans to be alienated on casual viewing because it's easy to take the riffing as 100% malicious, since MST3k had (arguably) drifted so far from its origins.  I personally wouldn't think they were flippant with their counter-proposal, but probably did make some demands they knew CC wouldn't be willing to meet."

Legacy of article  Eegah:       In 1993, Eegah! was featured on Comedy Central's cult television series Mystery Science Theater 3000 and became a fan favorite. In the published episode guide to the series, The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Amazing Colossal Episode Guide (ISBN 0-553-37783-3), the cast considers the shaving scene from Eegah, in which Eegah lolls his tongue around and laps up shaving cream, to be one of the most disgusting things they've witnessed during their time on the show. The writers also speculate that some kind of romantic relationship existed between Arch Hall, Sr. and his on-screen daughter Marilyn Manning, due to the uncomfortably non-familial chemistry in their scenes together. One of the film's more inept moments became a running joke on the show: Hall, Sr.'s line ""Watch out for snakes!"" is blurted out despite a lack of any visual source for the dialog. The line became a running gag, both on other episodes of the show and in a limited fashion as a pop-culture meme, appearing on The Office and as the closing line of The Rick Emerson Show.

Is it limited to episodes already released on DVD, or are they able to get tapes of the stuff never (or not yet) cleared for DVD release?  It's a slim possibility, but sometimes licensing for syndication is included in the original licensing deal for films.  We might see new airings of classic gems that most of us have had to watch off of third-hand VHS."

MST3K,30g3tx,tswurve,2,Fri Mar 27 14:23:38 2015 UTC,"Shop around. Never settle on the first one you go to. Getting a tattoo is a lot like buying a car, except it's a car you're going to have for the rest of your life. Draw it on the spot you want, it doesn't have to be super realistic, but you need to know if you're going to get sick of it, or regret it the next day. Ask people who have gotten tattoos in your town where they got it from, what it cost, what the service was like, etc. Make sure anyone who is going to put ink in you is certified and uses all the proper equipment. If/when you get the tattoo make sure you follow all the instructions you're given on how to maintain and protect your tattoo. You don't want to fuck it up like I did. (I have a Max from Sam and Max (Freelance Police) on my arm but it's faded very badly because I didn't listen to my tattoo artist.)"

MST3K,306c89,PartyMoses,7,Tue Mar 24 22:48:27 2015 UTC,"This looks a lot like questions I was asked when I was in grade school, pre-common core. I remember math teachers taking off points on story problems because I didn't adequately capitalize the first letter in my sentence or I forgot to put a period at the end, even if I got the question right (which, for me, was remarkable enough). This isn't a common core problem, it's a bad math teacher problem.   Most of the math teachers I talk to, by the way, actually really like the common core approach to math, and are usually pretty quick to tell me that math was moving toward the common core style before common core made it common core. It teaches ways to approach problem solving in general, first, and then moves on to how to apply those to math. Common core's number line method of solving basic addition and subtraction might seem unnecessarily convoluted at first, but it's based on the same idea as an abacus, and it has a broad application across more advanced types of math. The idea is to teach kids number sense, not just rote methods for solving rote problems in a vacuum.   I honestly wish I'd been taught this way as a kid. I was always lousy at math, because math teachers teach better to the kids who intuitively get it and less on the kids who actually had trouble. This way, the good-at-math kids are still going to be good-at-math, and the not so good kids have a more helpful, intuitive way of approaching math, even if it might wrinkle the brains of people who were never taught that way."

MST3K,30744w,dberthia,9,Wed Mar 25 00:41:21 2015 UTC,"Start with the episodes you hear the most about, or go to Club MST3K and watch the eps with the most ""laughs."" Alternating between Joel and Mike, as someone recommended below, is also a good idea. Introductory episodes I'd recommend include Pod People, The Amazing Colossal Man, and Puma Man. Season 1 is something you should come back to and sample episodes here and there if you end up falling in love with the show and wanting to see all of it.  EDIT: Also, lots of Gamera episodes. Maybe the vast amount of Japanese special effects films they did in season three won't be for you, but at least give Gamera a try."
MST3K,30744w,et11robot,4,Wed Mar 25 19:46:42 2015 UTC,"How much of it had you seen prior to starting from the beginning? Bits here and there, or an episode or two, or just heard about it and wanted to see what the fuss was?   In my opinion the writers hit their stride around season 3 or so, and then it just got better and better. Also, if you're totally new, it can be an acquired skill to take in a whole episode. They're long compared to other tv shows!  My advice would be either, 1. Start with some of the ""shorts"" on YouTube, they are quick and self-contained, and usually very rich with hilarity.  Or 2. Look through the movie descriptions and just pick one you think sounds amusing, even if from a later season.  I've found it's really hard to watch an episode if the movie doesn't engage you on SOME level, and every fan of the show I've ever met has episodes they just. can't. do.  Don't worry too much about losing continuity in the host segments if you skip ahead, the theme song will always give you the gist of the situation.   If you want recommendations please let us know!  There are definitely eps that are solid gold, and some that are...tougher nuts to crack, haha.  So to answer your question: yes!"

I watched it years ago as a kid and enjoyed the hell out of them.  Season 1 though, it was weird.  As a kid I never saw the first season so I never knew about the other side kick.  To me, Frank was always Dr. Forrester's sidekick.  I didn't really like the character Larry too much, fortunately he was only there for season 1.  Season 2 picks up.  As to what someone else said about Season 8 being the best because of Bill Crobett...  I dunno.  Like I said above, I just recently got to Season 8, and I actually kind of find Bill Corbett obnoxious.  Like I'm fine with him on Riff Trax, but to me, he's not Crow.  Also Dr. Forrester left at the end of Season 7.  I grew up with the Comedy Central era, and the Scifi era is just vastly different for me.  It definitely does pick up, but there are some really big misses along the way even in the better seasons.  Don't expect every episode to be laugh out loud.  I've even fallen asleep during some movies that were particularly bad."
MST3K,30744w,et11robot,-1,Sun Mar 29 01:45:19 2015 UTC,"The show becomes funny in season 8 ... and even then not every episode is a gem. The laughs per minute really increased in the show once Bill Corbett joined. His delivery is second-to-none when it comes to all the cast members throughout the show's history.  There are a couple stand-out episodes from the Comedy Central era, but the show was mostly just reference-heavy back then rather than having quality jokes.  Also, the hacky prop comedy in the beginning of each episode is cringe-worthy to say the least."
MST3K,30744w,analogkid01,4,Wed Mar 25 19:16:16 2015 UTC,"If we consult Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar, we can see that the show truly becomes funny merely three minutes before the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve. The vastness of space and time truly is humbling."

Pierce writes a scene in which he himself is mocking rural country folk, despite having quite a bit of redness to his own neck, and he's trying to pass his character off as some sort of intellectual.  Meanwhile Mike and The Bots get their jabs in at the townfolk's expense, using just about every stereotype in the book.  I think the only thing missing is mention of sister-cousins or some other inbreeding.  Of course, most of the crew comes from Minnesota, and they make plenty of jokes about Minnesota being full of backwoods creeps as well.  So everyone is making fun of ""those guys"" when they're probably not too far off from being ""those guys"" themselves."

MST3K,2yurxk,VGAddict,4,Thu Mar 12 23:55:08 2015 UTC,"Apparently mostly because there were issues between the actors/artists and Jim Mallon's handling of the show's business. From Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Definitive Oral History of a TV Masterpiece:  In the mid-’90s, two more beloved cast members exited the show: Conniff, who played a moronic, Joel-torturing henchman named Frank, left in 1995. Beaulieu—who played Frank’s boss, Dr. Clayton Forrester, while also voicing Crow—departed in 1996.  Beaulieu: One of the most frustrating things for me was finally realizing that all we were going to produce out of Best Brains was Mystery Science. We had such a beautiful environment, we had our own studio, our own production facility, we had a shop, we could build anything, we had the talented people. But the way it was structured, from a business standpoint, it was just impossible to produce anything else and be fair to everyone involved. Jim Mallon was going to own any new show produced. And that didn’t really sit well with a lot of us.  Conniff: I’ve never gotten any residuals or royal­ties from the show, or any money from merchandising. But that has never been a bone of contention with me, because Mystery Science Theater was my first TV show. It was my entry into something that I really wanted to do with my life, which was to write for television shows. And it was my passport into that world, and besides my salary, that’s kind of my payment for being on the show. I’ve always been totally cool with that."
MST3K,2yurxk,Eliphion,1 point,Fri Mar 13 04:13:38 2015 UTC,"Didn't Mallon sort of bankroll the KTMA episodes, more or less?  It sounds as if he felt he should have a major part of any success Joel/Trace/The Rest got in perpetuity because of that, and that he basically controlled the finances around BBI.  This is just conjecture, I should mention, based off the ""create anything new and be fair to everyone"" line in Trace's comment above.  As I recall, Joel/Jim had 45% share in BBI each and Trace 10%.  Everyone else was ""just"" a writer/actor/crew/etc.  So as MST3k was immensely popular, Jim was making large amounts of money despite putting nothing in creatively (or at least, very little), and not really funding the show any longer.    Wouldn't surprise me if Jim was being pressured to sell off his share to some of the show veterans who came in during the CC era, but didn't give in."
MST3K,2yurxk,ConradBHart42,3,Fri Mar 13 04:53:34 2015 UTC,You were almost on the money about the ownership split. It looks like Trace and Kevin each have five percent compared to Joel and Jim's 90.   http://dbrauer.tumblr.com/post/68080493885/from-the-archives-mystery-science-theaters

I think Trace and Josh said they got like $20 an episode and Joel got more but still not much.  Jim was a producer at KTMA, so I think he got the show made.  But I'd be shocked if the money literally came out of his pocket.  There wasn't any money for costumes, really.  Joel built the bots out of stuff he already had--he had a weird side business selling sculptures like the robots.  The movies were movies out of KTMA's vault.  Where'd you hear about this 45/45/10 split?  I thought it was just 50/50 Joel/Jim, though I admit I don't know where I heard that."

On the other hand without all of this drama Mike, Bill and Kevin may have never taken over the spotlight becoming (IMHO) the best riffer trio on the show.    Either way it's a damn shame it turned out the way it did for Trace and Frank."
MST3K,2yurxk,Chefca,3,Fri Mar 13 07:15:37 2015 UTC,"To add insult to injury, because Bill didn't get in on the ground floor of Best Brains and is not a share holder, he sees no money from any sales of any of the MST3K work that he did. So if we all went and bought The Final Sacrifice from Vimeo en masse, Bill would see precisely $0.00 of that. And Bill said on Twitter that Best Brains knows this and flat out refuses to change it."
MST3K,2yurxk,Miss_Interociter,2,Fri Mar 13 14:10:00 2015 UTC,"That's pretty shitty, and unfortunately it seems more and more that's just the way the entertainment industry works, lots of (rightfully!) bitter actors and writers out there. Does Mike get anything, I mean he was head writer..."
MST3K,2yurxk,Chefca,2,Fri Mar 13 14:30:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, he and Kevin does. I'm not sure share holders is the right term. Let me see if I can find the article I read.  Edit: Okay, here's the article. Thanks to /u/Tarantulas for posting the article in this thread  Best Brains is relatively debt-free, having used a $123,000 advance on the first season’s $344,000 license fee to pay for the space they sublet from Beaulieu’s brother’s company, a few assemble-them-yourself Techline desks, and a single phone line. Hodgson and Mellon each own 45 percent of Best Brains; Trace Beaulieu and Kevin Murphy split the remaining 10 percent.  Also, from my Googling, because Mallon is President of BB, Inc. he can cock block a lot of stuff (he cock blocked The Film Crew, for example.)  If I had to guess, Mike has something legally because he's able to use the MST3K name and logo in the RiffTrax promos (or does he get that legal right through Kevin? IDK)."
MST3K,2yurxk,Miss_Interociter,3,Fri Mar 13 14:39:43 2015 UTC,"Per an article I dug up from 1991, the only people with a stake were Jim, Joel, Trace and Kevin. Split 45-45-5-5, respectively. Josh got nothing because he was underage, and that probably added to his reasons for leaving. Joel, Trace and Kevin all say they still get residuals, but it's unknown of the split still looks like it did in 1991.  But I've never seen anything with Mike saying he gets any kind of residual.  And I agree that any MST3K mention with Rifftrax is through Kevin's stake. Which is why Cinematic Titanic was able to do Shadowrama, they employed Joel's and Trace's stake, which still wasn't enough to get the characters from MST3K. Though, I'm assuming Joel sold off some of his stake to Jim when he left, I'm just not sure how much."
MST3K,2yurxk,Tarlcabot18,2,Fri Mar 13 14:55:48 2015 UTC,"any MST3K mention with Rifftrax is through Kevin's stake   Isn't the mention just a factual ""From the guys who brought you MST3K""?  You don't need ownership of something to state a fact like that."

Here's what I remember him saying... paraphrased, remembered from twenty years ago.  ""Because we did the movie, we only did six episodes for Comedy Central.  And then they cancelled us.  I got laid off.  I went to sign up for unemployment, and where it said profession on the form I had to put 'puppetier'... there's not a lot of work for puppetiers out there right now.  I realized, even if we got picked up again, I didn't want to be on the roller coaster anymore.  It was just time to move on.""

In the alien region I went with the Z'no cyborg. Finally in the etc region I took the obvious 1 seed Torgo.

If anyone has a better collaborative tool for this sort of thing, I'm up for suggestions Scheduling/dedication is always the biggest issue with projects like this. I'd say that two writing sessions per film of a few hours each is necessary (eg the second and third thursdays of the month) Public domain is our friend. As much as I'd love to do more contemporary works, it's best not to get sued.

This deal is for a 4 episode pack to sell to PBS affiliates and other public television type stations (run by universities, etc). These stations are usually much more easily seen, have larger viewing areas, and often have contracts to be shown on local cable, whereas RetroTv doesn't and isn't.

I use an Afterglow one that was, I think, all of $25, and it gives pretty good sound.  Only recommendation I'd have is that if you've got a small condenser style mic that's going to be close to your face, get a ""pop guard"", which is basically just a foam condom you put over the end of the thing so you can't POP your Ps and SSSSSS your Ss."

MST3K,2wtcl5,schleppylundo,3,Mon Feb 23 10:40:36 2015 UTC,MST3K (etc.) is a comedy show based on a shared love/hatred of bad old movies.  The Razzies is pointing and laughing.  There's nothing else to it.
MST3K,2wtcl5,stupidestpuppy,3,Mon Feb 23 17:52:31 2015 UTC,"I think Rifftrax gets a bit mean from time to time.  For example, Rod's bizarre mannerisms in Birdemic get a fair amount of attention, and rightly so, but they also just outright mock the character as being some kind of moron because of flubbed lines or poor writing - both the fault of the director.  I feel like that's a bit mean toward the director.  Yes, he could have done more takes or hired a native speaker for proofreading, but he didn't.  It comes off to me as just ""let's laugh at the foreign guy""."
MST3K,2wtcl5,ConradBHart42,4,Mon Feb 23 20:16:14 2015 UTC,Thank you. Fascinating idea.
MST3K,2wtcl5,OneTimeIDidThatOnce,3,Mon Feb 23 00:50:37 2015 UTC,"Most people's conception (and I want to say, especially Joel's) of which movies belong on MST3k and which deserve Razzies are very different from each other.   Most fans say something like ""you can feel the love the writers have for the subject"" when watching them riff on the bizarre concepts that became films for most of the early seasons.  We look back at these movies from a culture that has very defined demographics with well-known preferences and inclinations, but when films like ""Attack of the Eye Creatures"" got made, they were more or less throwing something at the wall to see if it sticks.  They didn't have boundaries to rein them in.  You actually still get that sometimes with modern films, made to a niche interest (like Final Justice.  I guarantee there was a paying audience who wanted to see what JDB would do in not-Italy)."

According to legend, in 1870 two gold prospectors, Frank Lemon and a man named Blackjack, struck it rich in the Rockies in Alberta, Canada. But they quarreled over whether they should try to mine the gold then or return in the spring, and in a fit of rage Lemon murdered his partner with an ax. Driven mad with guilt, Lemon fled and was never able to find the mine again. The lost Lemon Mine has remained a mystery to this day; no one has succeeded in locating it, and some believe it never existed.   The joke is clearly a reference to the fact that lemons grow on trees, not in mines, so investing in a lemon mine would not be very wise."

MST3K,2u4rfj,microchannelplate,10,Thu Jan 29 22:49:52 2015 UTC,"By the way, the reason I thought it may be animation is because I couldn't sense any type of ""depth"" in the silloettes.  They appear two dimensional."
MST3K,2u4rfj,Rob_T_Firefly,12,Thu Jan 29 23:10:49 2015 UTC,"That's intentional.  The contrast is cranked way up so the silhouettes come out solid black, the better to stand out against the movie and look like shadows."

MST3K,2tbnn7,Mrs_Fonebone,6,Fri Jan 23 22:13:47 2015 UTC,"I think the problem they hit before was that once they got known, it was too expensive to get the rights to movies--they said once people figured out the movie was going to be torn to shreds, the copyright holders didn't want to sell or asked for way too much money. So RiffTrax avoided the problem by being a separate product, a kind of alternative audio track.  Of course these cost money, unlike watching them on TV in the old days. So we need to find a really, really rich person to re-launch the Satellite of Love!"

MST3K,2tbnn7,JDNTX,2,Thu Jan 22 22:02:26 2015 UTC,"The Sci-Fi Channel has a lot of awful movies, and they used to host MST3K.  It's a good match, I would think.  Oh they call it SyFy now though, for some reason."

MST3K,2tbnn7,bloodyhand,7,Sat Feb 14 17:40:18 2015 UTC,"I've said in previous comments I believe that a reboot is a pretty dangerous thing. The expectations of a lot of us fans are pretty high. I'm sure it could find fans again, there's always a market for poking fun at, or just watching, bad movies (Rifftrax, CT and Red Letter Media's Best of the Worst all spring to mind) but I'm not sure many of us old MST fans would enjoy it quite like watching Mike/Joel and the bots.   I hope I'm wrong of course. I'd love to see more MST3k. I still hope a reboot happens, and with Joel's hinting last November, hope is pretty high. :)"
MST3K,2tbnn7,Ltsmash99,2,Fri Jan 23 01:20:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm super worried that a hypothetical reboot would just end up being a hyper-fetishized version of the original, i.e. the riffers would just rattle off catchphrases and references to classic episodes. For example, they would spend entire episodes just going ""NO SPRINGS""/""ROWSDOWER""/""HI KEEBA""/whatever other memorable quotes from popular episodes there are. Kinda hard to explain but I hope you get it."
MST3K,2tbnn7,Ltsmash99,8,Sat Jan 24 21:58:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think the show will ever return to its glory days.  Rifftrax has been a pretty damn nice alternative. Plus, they release content on a very regular basis.  It also stars my 3 favorite MST veterans, Mike Nelson, Bill Corbet and Kevin Murphy. All in all, I'm content with Rifftrax."

MST3K,2tbnn7,MST3Kimber,1 point,Fri Jan 23 21:59:56 2015 UTC,Rifftrax is pretty funny. I usually go see it when it's shown in theaters. I thought the one they did of Anaconda recently was funnier than some MST3K episodes.
MST3K,2tbnn7,Teaflax,3,Fri Jan 23 22:41:27 2015 UTC,"There have been whispers of it returning, but Joel has said in his AMA's and in interviews that he would introduce new bots, new cast, new writers, etc. I believe he is very interested in making this happen eventually. I have faith that I will love it no matter what changes are made. And personally, I think the crew from Incognito Cinema Warriors XP should be the new cast and writers for the hypothetical MST3K reboot. Kevin and Mike have already said they wouldn't be interested in returning, and ICWXP is pretty much the next gen MST3K. Either way, I would like Joel involved and for the Turkey Day Marathons to continue every year."
MST3K,2tbnn7,MST3Kimber,3,Sat Feb 14 17:41:42 2015 UTC,"There's just one flaw in that plan. The ICWXP are even less funny than Family Guy. I really wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt, because they're aspiring to pay tribute to something of the highest standard, but in the end I had to conclude that they're just not particularly able humorists - especially in the tedious host segments."
MST3K,2tbnn7,MST3Kimber,0,Fri Jan 23 01:43:01 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I find the host segments entertaining, albeit a bit too long, but The Haunted Mouth is one of the funniest riffs I've seen since MST3K went off the air."
MST3K,2tbnn7,underthepavingstones,2,Fri Jan 23 13:44:09 2015 UTC,When did Kevin and Mike say they wouldn't be interested in returning?  What about Bill? Or even Trace?
MST3K,2tbnn7,saxonjf,3,Fri Jan 23 15:01:44 2015 UTC,"In their AMA's, in interviews. They're both doing their own thing now, and Kevin said that he will always love the show, but he wants to focus more on the future of Rifftrax and his writing. If I recall correctly, Bill said he would be open to guest-staring or writing, but he's also trying to focus on Rifftrax. I haven't seen Trace say anything about it, but I would think that he'd be into joining forces with Joel, since they've been working together pretty steadily for years."

Take 12 to the Moon.  There's just no way Turner negotiated for that movie by itself: it must have been in a bundle of a thousand.  For MST3K to work, network owners just need to demand the right to show the movie amended and with commentary.  Best Brains can certainly ask for permission to riff it as a courtesy, but that wouldn't be necessary."
MST3K,2tbnn7,Teaflax,1 point,Fri Jan 23 04:05:31 2015 UTC,I doubt it. Honestly I wish the Film Crew stuff hadn't got nixed. I love Rifftrax. If they added some more in between narrative it'd be perfect. I have a feeling bringing back the actual show though would simply not work though.

No matter what you think of the president and his polices Glenn Beck (in my opinion) is a truly vile character.  He has supported horrible anti-gay politicians like Rick Santorum for president. He would like nothing more than our government to operate like a pseudo-theocracy.

Oh, it's on the wiki:  ""Nelson is married to fellow MST3K writer Bridget Jones, and the pair have two sons. They moved from the Minneapolis, Minnesota area to San Diego, California in mid-2006.[5] Nelson and his family moved back to Minneapolis in 2014.  He has described the role of Christianity in his family as ""the very centerpiece of our lives. We're heavily involved in our church, my wife works with youth groups and churches as her profession, and almost every career and life decision I make depends upon it."" He studies Christian apologetics and cites William Lane Craig and C.S. Lewis as influences.[10]  During a 2004 interview with the fanatic site MST3K Review, Nelson described himself as Protestant and conservative: ""I read the National Review cover to cover. Check in at Townhall.com every day. Check the Washington Times daily. Listen to Dennis Prager and Michael Medved on a regular basis. Read Mark Steyn with regularity. Read the Weekly Standard.

They were merciless to Reagan when he acted in the Phantom Creep shorts. They also went after Clinton just as hard.  My objections is Glenn Beck using someone else's great original idea to push his ideology.
MST3K,2t36q6,saxonjf,-1,Tue Jan 20 21:26:21 2015 UTC,"There aren't many truly original ideas, and, as someone else mentioned, Comedy Central riffed over the state of the union way back in the 1990s. And if the Sklar Brothers could riff over classic sports and not catch bushels of hatred for it, I think someone can riff over the State of the Union and it not be that big of a deal, either."

He has managed to monetize virtually everything that comes out of his mouth. He gets $13 million a year from print (books plus the ten-issue-a-year magazine Fusion). Radio brings in $10 million. Digital (including a newsletter, the ad-supported Glennbeck.com and merchandise) pulls in $4 million. Speaking and events are good for $3 million and television for $2 million. Over several days in mid-March Beck allowed a reporter to follow him through his multimedia incarnations, with one exception, his 5 p.m. daily show on Fox News, which attracts just under 3 million viewers. (FORBES has a relationship with that channel via Forbes on Fox.)  Source   You're not wrong.  He passes himself off as a newscaster when he really spouts bullshit to manipulate people for money."

That DIY era was big in the early '80s, and I could see this show playing alongside Night Flight on Friday night and being a cult hit.

It's a silly campy movie that makes fun of itself without anyone riffing it, but Joel's lines don't even have any comedic value when you take the racial connotation out. It's just awkward and cringy to watch that episode even though the original movie is fun. I'm glad they grew out of whatever was going on in the middle of season 2.  Also, Toho has the rights and BBI really gaffed by not securing them.

She asked why they made so many jokes about people being gay and that as a gay fan it always turns her off and Bill Corbett was great. The audience basically was sort of antagonistic towards this girl (in my opinion) because she was asking a hard question and he said something like, ""first off, it's hard enough talking about these issues in any forum but to come to dragoncon and criticize a guy who wrote jokes on a show in a session for the show, that takes a lot of guts and you deserve all of our respect."" He went on to say that in the 90s he was basically less evolved, and made jokes that he is sometimes ashamed of making now. I gained a lot of respect for Bill Corbett that day."

It's funny.  I go by what Stephen Fry says about being offended:  “It's now very common to hear people say, 'I'm rather offended by that.' As if that gives them certain rights. It's actually nothing more... than a whine. 'I find that offensive.' It has no meaning; it has no purpose; it has no reason to be respected as a phrase. 'I am offended by that.'

MST3K,2ss554,lolzergrush,2,Sun Jan 18 06:50:46 2015 UTC,"BBI was and has never been in charge of securing the rights. That was up to Comedy Central/Sci-Fi, who sent them boxes of movies that the channel could forseeably acquire. The DVDs, it's up to Rhino and Shout! Factory. Rhino was the one that released the Godzilla episode; from what I've heard on forrestcrow, they had secured the rights with a practically-defunct company that had once distributed the movies that did not own the rights anymore and then released them."
MST3K,2ss554,lolzergrush,1 point,Sun Jan 18 02:42:12 2015 UTC,"No rights acquisition of the movies had nothing to do with Rhino and Shout! Factory, this was far before their time. The moment the derivative work was made and published, it would constitute infringement if the rights were not acquired. Rhino and Shout! only need the rights to distribute the works produced by BBI much, much later when they sold the home video collections long after the episodes had aired.  The network actually didn't acquire the rights; they did provide some of the cash outlaw but it was Jim Mallon who did the legwork. This was one of his stipulations so that the creators would be left alone and not have to deal with constant interference from The Suits."
MST3K,2ss554,DiscoJer,1 point,Sun Jan 18 02:49:32 2015 UTC,"I've never read that BBI falsely acquired the rights to the Godzilla movies. Rhino obviously did, but when did BBI?"
MST3K,2ss554,lolzergrush,1 point,Sun Jan 18 02:53:10 2015 UTC,"I didn't say that they falsely acquired the rights. There was no deceptive or fraudulent intent.  They simply erred when trying to acquire the rights. Maybe someone never bothered to contact Toho, or never received a response; maybe they dealt with some shady vhs distribution company that was operating in the ambiguity of overseas copyright. Who knows. Point was that getting the full rights to the Godzilla franchise was never really in their budget so someone made a mistake."
MST3K,2ss554,Supervisor194,2,Sun Jan 18 02:56:51 2015 UTC,"So wait, there were actually issues with BBI's episode? I've always heard it to be Rhino's issue in releasing them, because the rights got switched up. (Sorry if I'm coming off as overbearing, honestly just curious)"
MST3K,2ss554,lolzergrush,0,Sun Jan 18 02:59:46 2015 UTC,"No you're fine.  To actually make changes and release an edited, changed version, MST3K didn't simply need the distribution rights. They needed to own that particular film. As in, it's theirs, they can do what they want with it.  Obviously this was a huge difficulty, which is why they acquired the rights to films no one wanted.  Godzilla was still a profitable franchise in the US in the early 90's, with VHS tapes entering the market and being sold and resold so a cult following of fans. In fact the franchise was still doing very well in Japan and new movies were coming out. Companies that produced low-cost VHS tapes with imported titles (think exploitation films, kung-fu movies, and so on) could still turn a decent profit by paying Toho fees, but a lot of them were just basically bootleggers with decent box covers...operating under the assumption that it wasn't worth it for Toho to prosecute an obscure company in the US.  However in the 2010's with the internet in all its glory, it's a lot easier for Toho to digitally identify how and where their product is being used. So they're unhappy with seeing their product make money without their consent or compensation because it diminishes the market value of their work (the essence of copyright). Twenty years ago they were probably unaware or unconcerned about two of their more obscure titles appearing on an obscure show on a little-known network, but BBI never owned the Godzilla franchise and Toho wouldn't sell the rights to just a couple titles.  It never made sense to me how MST3K was able to show Godzilla movies, except through benign neglect. The ownership of these movies is not listed as BBI which means that they never had the rights to use it, however it's Toho Ltd.'s responsibility to do something about it and they never apparently bothered until now."
MST3K,2ss554,au79,3,Sun Jan 18 03:16:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think you have it right.  When they were first airing the show, they had no idea it would ever be sold on DVD.  They simply got the rights to use the movies on the show.  Then when they decided to release the show on DVD (or VHS, early on), they had to go back and re-do the rights, this time allowing the movies to be sold. Not all companies were okay with this.  And apparently in the first, KTMA season, they never bothered to get the rights at all, they just used the movies the TV station had licensed, not realizing they needed to   And I think you are giving TOHO way too little credit. It's not like the world was so difficult to comprehend in the 1990s for a Japanese company."
MST3K,2ss554,Difascio,1 point,Sun Jan 18 06:49:34 2015 UTC,"They needed more than simple distribution rights because they were showing a substantially different version - edited for format, content, and time not to mention the fact that they were overlaying a new audio track on top of it. They used pubic domain whenever possible of course, but BBI is the sole owner of the rights within US jurisdiction for the titles they showed (when things were done correctly).  What you said about KTMA is right along the lines with this. KTMA itself had the distribution rights as a public access station, but they needed to actually own the movie to make such substantial changes to it.   And I think you are giving TOHO way too little credit. It's not like the world was so difficult to comprehend in the 1990s for a Japanese company.   Whoa, that's not what I said at all. It's that it was difficult for them to enforce because information wasn't as prolific. Tracking down infringement now is extremely easy and can be done through computer algorithms (like the automated takedown on YouTube). Doing it in the early '90s meant having employees combing through the bins at obscure video stores. I never suggested anything about Toho not understanding; just that it wasn't worth the time and expense back then."
