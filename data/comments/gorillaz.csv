What makes MSG is that Damon's voice, which seems to be on point (he had a terrible cold for that tour which hadn't hit yet) and the band just playing totally out of their minds.

The quintessential nugget that makes the Gorillaz sound unique. It's dubby, it's poppy, it's kinda weird and goof and cartoony. There's a real kitschy-ness, a sound I think worked best with the older Gorillaz art. It's maybe not a great song overall, I don't think it really stands on its own. But as a tidbit of Gorillaz ephemera, a glimpse into the early processes of finding the Gorillaz sound, it's priceless."
