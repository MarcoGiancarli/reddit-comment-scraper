ImaginaryTechnology,3duih3,Bond4141,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:23:36 2015 UTC,"Biggest issue is the back light though. Using this outdoors will drain your battery, quite like your phone. Assuming it's always on that is. Simply having AMOLED and a black and white mode when not being fiddled with would probably let the battery be ~3+ days. depending on use that is.   Could also have a hybrid screen. The clock section could be E-paper/colour E-paper, like the Pebble. While the other sections are two separate OLED, or AMOLED displays.   Not taking away from your work, Although that would be my biggest concern upon purchasing. Which I fucking would. Seriously, we need someone to kick start this."
ImaginaryTechnology,3duih3,kilkil,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:33:36 2015 UTC,"I can see a few development kids that could be possibly made to serve the purpose...tbh I'm a designer, not an electronics guru, so anything above modifying a raspberry pi a wee bit, and I'd need to build a proper dev. team, but I'd be interested in it if I thought it was feasible...  Conceptually, the OLED would only come on if you a) tapped the screen or b) the accelerometer activated it because it realised you'd raised your arms and rated your wrist...  Biggest problem is the screen...sourcing a suitable flexible old screen in the right form factor could be tricky... To get it off the ground I'd have to a) develop the concept a lot further, putting out annotated clear ideas of how it would function, b) get together a team of people who unlike my pixel-pushing self are really good at hardware & software design, and c) get a kickstarter up and raise the capital to actually build the thing, get production facilities ready to churn them out etc. and ship it..  First step would presumably be a prototype that doesn't fit the form factor but does the job...raspberry pi shows promise in this sort of device...or a similar ""wearables"" development kit...trick is to use as much stuff off-the-shelf as possible - the more you have to design and have custom-cabbed, the more it costs and the more it goes wrong (and the more people you have to pay to get it working...)"
ImaginaryTechnology,3duih3,OneYearSteakDay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:06:56 2015 UTC,"Actually, this is quite feasible. I can't do links because my internet is being very intermittent, Although do searches on ""Flexible Battery"", ""Flexible display"" and ""Flexible PCB"". It all seems to exist. Battery seems like the least developed though. Although that could be fixed by having a false-flexible battery. A bunch of small batteries hooked together in series/parallel like a metal watch band. Not flexible on it's own. But together, it'll flex. Surround it in some kind of plastic/metal, toss in a small circuit with Bluetooth, NFC, and if you're feeling crafty, SIM card support with it's own mobile antenna. In fact, I could see smart bands replacing phones, while watches cannot (See Samsung Gear S). The bigger screen mainly would allow the user to text much more efficiently.   Actually, I just re-read your last post. 50mmX25mm? That's 5cmX2.5cm. Really, quite small. A pebble's watch dimensions (not screen) are about 5x3.5cm. And that requires no wrap.   Anyways. IMHO a screen that isn't on all the time is rather meh. The accelerometer can turn itself on quite a bit, wasting power. Even so, there would be some input lag between the accelerometer and the screen, causing annoyance. At least, a handful of Apple Watch reviews state that. However, if you're going with a high fidelity screen (which you should), you'll require some kind of power saver. I think that, like Android wear, it should go black and white. Like I said, my internet is shitty, but this shoudl be a gif to what I'm talking about. This would be when not in use, so if you need to glance at it for say, the time, or weather, then you'll be able to tell the time, withought a shake of the wrist, or a touch of a screen/button.   That said, you'd need to work on the interface. First off, make the fucker waterproof. No ports, wireless charging, files over Bluetooth. Add a waterproof speaker and microphone. Should be easy-ish. That said, the main issue is water makes a touch screen unusable. IF you're unaware, a touchscreen uses the body's electromagnetic field to figure out where it's being touched at. Hence why conductive things like Stylus', Oranges, and cheese work. But plastic, and gloves, do not. However, this is only a problem underwater, or possibly, in the shower. As such, if you desired for it to be useful outside of showing what is currently on the screen, you'd need to add either buttons, something like Apple's crown on the Apple Watch, or some other form of input. This could make the bracelet look ugly though, so I wouldn't fault you for not wanting underwater usage. Although I stand by the waterproof thing. If it's waterproof, it can't have water damage.   I'm assuming you're thinking the screen should be flush with the outside? While a solid design point, I think it should be recessed a little. Humans are prone to hitting things. One accidental bang on a door could damage the screen. A small protruding edge would help keep damage at a low.   For usage, that's really up to you aswell. It can either be a smartphone accessory, like all smartwatches (Excluding the Samsung Gear S). Or a smartphone on it's own. If you try to make it a smartphone, you'll have less competition, but more shit that can go wrong. IF it's an accessory, then you're burdened with siding with a phone brand (I'd assume Android). And having all the fanboys attack your product.   As you said, for function, I'd assume it would be quite a lot like your diagram. It would show ~3 screens. A watch face, weather, and something else. Maybe stocks? System info (Bluetooth connected, battery info, etc)? Or just the time and weather shown, taking the fell length. Really, it could be anything. Although, swipe right on say, the weather. And it changes from current, to the forecast. Or changes location. Swipe right on the clock, and have it change to a different timezone. Swipe left, and you're greeted with a list of apps/faces. Tapping on an App launches it. Say the phone App. Allows it to full screen and be used. But, flick your wrist away from you, and it's back to the home faces. Tapping on a face replaces the face you swiped from. Say you replace Time with a messaging face that shows that last few contacts/messages you've received. Then say you two fingers, right beside each other on the face, and spread them. It'll launch the associated App.  At least, that's what I'd do with it.   If you're serious about trying to get this to be a thing, I'd say attempt to contact the guys to invented the Pebble, the first smartwatch. See if they'd be willing to help you get started, or at least share some tips on how to get started. Keep in mind, they're company was more or less made on Kick starter. Hell, their success pretty much made Kick starter. So I'd assume they could tell you a few tips and tricks. That said, they made a kickstarter page with a working product, so you would need some script monkeys and hardware devs. I'd suggest hitting up some people at a local university/collage and asking their ideas on this project. Mostly, if they're interested in helping you out. Then get a prototype. made. Probably using a Rasberry pi/Arduino. then look for investors. Figure out what kind of specs you want, and then look into a hardware manufacturer. tweak the design a bit, then start the kickstarter. If that fails, look into private investors. And hopefully that doesn't fail.   You probably won't be able to make much of it off the shelf. It will require a custom battery, screen, casing, etc. Actually, I don't think anything would be off the shelf electronics. You'd want a small circuit board for a bigger battery, so that'll be custom. The CPU and such will be pre-made of course. Although that doesn't really could either. It will need quite a bit of power for a HD screen like that.   anyways. I think I've talked your ear off enough for one night. I hope I havn't turned you off to this Idea. It's a great idea, but it would be tough to make."
ImaginaryTechnology,3duih3,OneYearSteakDay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:25:18 2015 UTC,"Very tough to make, I agree....but I'm good at being able to split the possible from the just-very-hard.  This will be very hard.  Not 100% it's a runner, so I'm not yet convinced there would be a market - is it a smartphone? A smartwatch? Somewhere in between?  If it's a smartphone, it would have to either have a headphone port, ship with bluetooth headset, or have some awful speaker out so you can raise your hand to your face etc.  I missed a zero on the screen - 50mm by 250mm - i.e. 25cm long....3 or 4 ""apps"" can display at once..scroll up to change where they are/which apps are visible on a  ""carousel"" type thing... I imagine texting on it would be a bit hard but do-able...this is more a permanence thing.  Ideal screen would be an as-yet-uninvented tech that only lights when you need it, but can be any ""reflective"" colour you like without drawing power (a la e-paper), so you couldd have a pretty patterned bracelet, that lights up and becomes a wearable computer when you interact with it, but is otherwise a piece of stylish jewellery etc. Would be unisex mind you, so ""plain black"" would be there as well - I certainly wouldn't wear ""pretty patterns"" on a bracelet...tech geeky is one thing, but patterns cross the boundary into ""this is aimed at girls"" for me...  If it's not a smartphone I don't see it would necessarily have to be an accessory - if it has bluetooth, wifi etc. it can function on it's own, pair it to a phone for data/app configuration etc. if you like...  When I meant off-the-shelf, sure there would need to be some adjustment of boards etc. but off-the-shelf tech, i.e. no developing custom silicon and if possible, use existing system designs (likely rasp-pi), just ask for it on a flexible pcb...  I'd see the design as ""semi-flexible"" here - a fairy hard band, but it flexes enough to go around your wrist.  Maybe it would ned some sort of cord or strap that covers the ""gap"" between the ends of it...  If I wasn't trying to keep things realistic, the gap would be traversed with a magnetic ""cuff"" that extends outwards from both ends and meets in the middle, very futuristic...but not very do-able (unless you want half the usable space and most of the power taken up with servos and electromagnets)...  I'll think some more on this...just wanted to reply immediately.."
ImaginaryTechnology,3duih3,SabashChandraBose,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:32:00 2015 UTC,"i think there would be a market for this. Not a huge one, but definitely a market. For a lot of people, smartwatches are to small to be used as a standalone product. This would fox that. As well as fix the battery life issues people have. Although, even so, posting it in /r/Lightbulb for opinions would help. Someone may steal it though. Keep that in mind.   That said though, I feel like shipping with a Bluetooth headset, as well as having a speaker/microphone would be a great idea. Even if it wasn't a phone, the ability to use voice commands would be great. And with such a large product, you could use multiple microphones for nice cancellation, and clearer audio. Hell, if it's a rigid band like the picture above, you could have stereo speakers. One on each end. This would also usher in a new era of wearables. A market that would be booming in a few years.   25cm for the screen is a bit, insanely huge. That's almost a foot long before the bezel. Half that might be the best. 12.5cm. Same with the width. 5cm is quite big, almost 2 inches. IMHO, 3cm would be a bit more suitable.   Before I talk on the display, I would just like to add that if the tech ever exists. Making a smartphone alike a snapband would be fucking awesome. Take it off to use it, snap it back on to hangup/travel.   The issue isn't that the screens don't exist that light only as you need it. It's that the detection is wonky. Samsung tablets have eye detection to tell when in use. Most smartwatches have gesture detection, etc. Although, the tech you're talking about is already partially existent. Pebble has an E-paper display with 64 colors. No, not 64bit, 64. Yes, a bit sad, but probably being refined even as we speak. Although, if one could get a translucent display ala this, overlay that on top of an Epaper display (For always on looks, and designs), then a back light underneath that would illuminate the top display when in the dark, would be both doable, and fucking hard. However, The E-paper display could show the designs well when not in use. Making this a reliable idea.   While it could, and should have standalone features. Without cell service, it looses a lot of it's power. Bluetooth with a phone allows that to happen. However, a GPS module would also work wonders. Sidenote: heart rate sensor. This needs that.   I was also thinking of it as a semi-ridgid structure. As such, having special flex points would make the PCB not need to be flexible. Hell, the Iphone6 was able to be bent a bit and still work. With bend-friendly tech, it should be quite easy to be well made, and rather cheap.   That all said, if you really want to get on board with this idea, the design should be made first while you look for backers. Play around a bit in sketchup or open scad, or something that make 3D files. Then, check out /r/3Dprintmything and get a 3D printed (fully plastic) prototype sent your way. See how it looks, what you like and don't like. Maybe wear it around the house for a week and make notes on what you need to change."

I agree regarding size - I was spitballing it, but 30-35mm wide, and then maybe 100mm-120mm long would definitely be do-able...  The tech isn't a problem for the screen - it's the circuitboard etc. for a ""snap band"" style... Not sure 2 screens would be feasible...you'd be using a LOT of power/space, not to mention cost...no-one will buy a product if it's insane expensive, no matter how cool it might be. 64-colour paper is a bit sad...i'd seen that as well.  Ah, if only we were 5 years ahead in time!  Phone service would in my mind, merely serve to overcomplicate - a sim-card alone would take up a ton of space...then you've also got extra regulatory problems, network support, do you go GSM or CDMA etc.  3D isn't a problem - I'm a 3D artist/graphics designer (mostly 2D really, but  did 3D in uni, and here, as you can see..this was a 3D render!) so using a CAD app won't be a problem...if I can work out the right devout to base it on I can even lay in the basic design stuff to start from...."

You got some great points, actually, and I'd like to address some of them :) - The tank being slower and bumpier is imo a reasonable trade off for highly increased  terrain passability. Here's an interesting article I bumped into a while ago: http://www.theengineer.co.uk/in-depth/the-big-story/the-future-of-military-tanks/1001769.article  I imagined the tanks and APCs of the future being based on a modular system of 3 types of platforms - Wheeled, tracked and walker.  Also, don't forget that very often Merkava tanks operate in dense urban areas, where their speed is very limited anyway. Add lots of rubble and craters, and I think there's some justification to use walkers.   Regarding center of mass - One of the main tools of concept design and illustration is pushing the boundaries of these principles, to create tension and interest. Of course, when it's too much it looses some points credibility-wise. It's a delicate balance that I hope to master some day.

ImaginaryTechnology,3dbrcp,the_enginerd,6,Wed Jul 15 01:20:42 2015 UTC,Not sure why downvotes. Nice original work if a bit rudimentary by the standards of this sub. Did you do the background and subject both? I'm no artist but id say at a minimum you'll want to work on your shading and detail work over your character it would make a world of difference. The human form is off in awkward ways too but not necessarily untenable from my perspective if there were some more detail.   I am guessing there are other subs better suited to art critique though and while you do meet the subs guidelines folks here seem to be used to professional artistry.   It's better than I could do so have my upvote and commentary  good luck on your journey.  Edit: my number one anatomical comment would be work on the legs. The subjects right knee is simply too low on their leg and the left doesn't exist (you could maybe show a hint of it front and or back just with shading alone). I'd suggest taking a a look at a film like the rocketeer perhaps for some anatomical influences in jet packs even if it is a bit dated it should he a good study in this type of propulsion.

ImaginaryTechnology,3d5k5f,d2artist,2,Mon Jul 13 21:05:27 2015 UTC,"There's an unusual flexibility of scale here. Usually when people include humans, it anchors the height of the objects in a scene. Here we're not left with any clear information about the relative depth of the girl and the robot, except in assuming that she's looking at it, and thus that it's vaguely further away than she is. The plants provide some context, but even the plants aren't well-defined with respect to the little girl.   The robot could be twenty feet tall or two hundred feet tall. It's an interesting ambiguity. I only hope it was intentional."
ImaginaryTechnology,3d5k5f,mindbleach,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:46:57 2015 UTC,"wow, that's how i imagined scenes from The Old Axolotl by Polish sci-fi writer Jacek Dukaj, all biological life dies, people upload their minds to mainframes, using robots/mechs as avatars and after few decades try to recreate life, there is a scene when small girl born from artificial womb is talking with main character in form of a fighter mech, that's how i imagined that scene:)"
ImaginaryTechnology,3d144i,One_Giant_Nostril,11,Sun Jul 12 17:28:04 2015 UTC,Hello beefed up Gekko model!
ImaginaryTechnology,3d144i,Nimiety_One,8,Sun Jul 12 20:03:17 2015 UTC,Looks more like Rex to me
ImaginaryTechnology,3d144i,Uhrise_Chicken,10,Sun Jul 12 20:37:23 2015 UTC,Could it be? Metal Gear...
ImaginaryTechnology,3d144i,hellachinky,3,Sun Jul 12 23:39:46 2015 UTC,Metal... Geeaaaar?
ImaginaryTechnology,3d144i,Teik1066,9,Mon Jul 13 07:33:42 2015 UTC,"His deviantART gallery.  Don Bradford's artwork has been posted here before.  This mech is available as a full resin model kit, 150mm tall, 91 resin and brass pieces. If you're interested, search whitedragonminiatures.co.uk (I have no affiliation with that website, just passing on information)."
ImaginaryTechnology,3d144i,robo_duck,3,Sun Jul 12 17:38:59 2015 UTC,"Wow, what a fantastic job! I really like how the artist captured the movement of the mech."
ImaginaryTechnology,3d144i,mischiefpenguin,3,Sun Jul 12 19:56:33 2015 UTC,This must be Kaz's metal gear.
ImaginaryTechnology,3d144i,Scruftdog,2,Mon Jul 13 03:14:15 2015 UTC,I have this on my desktop at work and several people have stopped in their way by and commented holy crap that looks real.

ImaginaryTechnology,3cy1ft,toucher_of_bums,8,Sat Jul 11 20:24:13 2015 UTC,"I don't like the edited version.  what's going on in the bottom left & right?  why does the earth stop?  What is added by this weirdness?  That being said, the original is really great."
ImaginaryTechnology,3cy1ft,Prosthemadera,5,Sat Jul 11 22:23:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, why would you edit that? And edit it so poorly?"
ImaginaryTechnology,3cy1ft,BattleStag17,3,Sun Jul 12 00:11:10 2015 UTC,My guess: giving the picture a more desktop-like ratio
ImaginaryTechnology,3cy1ft,augmaticdisport,2,Sun Jul 12 04:31:37 2015 UTC,You can do that without ruining the artwork
ImaginaryTechnology,3cy1ft,ziggl,2,Sun Jul 12 11:14:29 2015 UTC,"Whoah seriously.  Looking at the edited version first, I'm drawn to the corners like, ""what is this world that just ends?"""
ImaginaryTechnology,3cy1ft,Draxagon,8,Sun Jul 12 05:20:17 2015 UTC,"Dude, what? The original is way better."
ImaginaryTechnology,3cy1ft,ThaBenMan,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:11:10 2015 UTC,Tim White is awesome - I still have a bunch of these trading cards with his artwork on them that I got when I was a kid.
ImaginaryTechnology,3cy1ft,CreepyMaleNurse,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:11:19 2015 UTC,Reminds me of some of Peter Elson's stuff. Awesome.

ImaginaryTechnology,3ct7c3,balrogofni,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:05:29 2015 UTC,Great art piece. Love the blue a lot for some reason.
ImaginaryTechnology,3c9dus,RaCailum,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:57:51 2015 UTC,The photoshop effect is a little much for me. But that's probably just because I can recognize it so well.
ImaginaryTechnology,3c9dus,Humpa,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:14:19 2015 UTC,Make an x-post to /r/cyberbooty
ImaginaryTechnology,3c9dus,Siedrah,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:16:45 2015 UTC,The second version of it is amazing!
ImaginaryTechnology,3c9dus,Maltroth,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:36:53 2015 UTC,It looks really cool but the logo in the middle looked like pixeled out genitalia at first glance.

ImaginaryTechnology,3c10vr,Torvusil,2,Fri Jul 3 19:53:19 2015 UTC,Would you believe I just started playing through Homeworld today for the first time? I think I'm kinda addicted. It's great.
ImaginaryTechnology,3c10vr,SeriousSpy,2,Sat Jul 4 11:35:54 2015 UTC,"For those not in the know, over the last year we've had the release of Homeworld Remastered Collection and the unofficial prequel Shipbreakers became Homeworld: Shipbreakers as they were granted the use of the IP by Gearbox."
ImaginaryTechnology,3bz173,One_Giant_Nostril,11,Fri Jul 3 08:36:01 2015 UTC,This is an illustration for Robot Envy: Zenith  Matt Tkocz has a great ability to shuffle art styles as you can see by viewing his ArtStation and website.  I love the idea of someone holding up their iDevice to capture the moment instead of running for the hills - a neat commentary on our present priorities.
ImaginaryTechnology,3bz173,ConorPF,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:42:55 2015 UTC,"I read into it more as, like, this is a fairly common occurrence so they're just used to it."
ImaginaryTechnology,3bz173,yParticle,8,Fri Jul 3 22:56:03 2015 UTC,I'm really digging this art style.  Something about the high detail/low texture/dramatic lighting really make it stand out.  I'd love to see this used in animation or a game.
ImaginaryTechnology,3bz173,crashnburn254,2,Fri Jul 3 17:47:40 2015 UTC,"Kind of similar to the style of the game ""Another World"""
