Oregairu is about a loner who joins a club that helps students with their problems.

Animesuggest,3e4347,anonymepelle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:40:20 2015 UTC,That's a bit hard to answer. It's a story about relationships and the drama that comes from those relationships and a lot of that drama is left unresolved. If the manga had contineued on the ending would have been very different from the ending you see in the anime.   At the same time you aren't left wondering what will happen next when the anime is over. The ending is an actual ending. It's more like you're left wondering what would have happened if the manga didn't go on haitus and all the plot threads reached their natural conclusion.

It has more of a focus on comedy and is a 'realistic' look at giant robots and how ridiculous yet loveable they are.  There are two timelines:  Patlabor: Early Days -> Patlabor: The Movie -> Patlabor: The Movie 2 -> Patlabor: WXIII  Patlabor TV -> Patlabor: The New Files  The more serious entries in Patlabor are episodes 5 and 6 of Early Days and the three movies, and are focused on politics and espionage (particularly movies 1 and 2) which is an Oshii staple.

The only weird things if you watch Railgun before Index is that there's a clearly significant secondary character who shows up periodically without complete explanation (protagonist of Index), and that one of the major storylines is actually covered in Index, so doesn't get full treatment in Railgun.

There's two ways of doing it:  (ufotable remake of) Fate/Stay Night -> Fate/Zero (season 1 and 2) (VN/LN release order, reversed anime broadcast order, reverse chronological order) <- Fanboy prefered order.   Alternatively you can go:  Fate/Zero (season 1 and 2) -> (ufotable remake of) Fate/Stay Night (reverse VN/LN release order, Anime broadcast order, Chronological order)  .........  It's kinda like Star Wars. It's two series with independent stories that fall under the same continuity. It doesn't really matter which order you do, but whichever you watch first will reveal plot points from the one that comes after.   It is highly recommended that you watch the Unfotable remake of Stay Night as (from what I've heard) the original adaptation wasn't all that great.  All the other Fate/ anime are either alternate versions or side stories. Reading the VN is not required. But I guess if you want to read a VN then that's a good option too.    From your PTW some really good ones are:   Kokoro Connect + Ova Planetes Spirited Away The Girl Who Leapt Trough Time (If you end up liking this one I strongly recomend: Wolf Children and Summer Wars by the same director.)"

Explored mainly in the first and last works.  Gundam 0079 -> Zeta -> ZZ -> CCA  But yes, there are a LOT of episodes. You can watch the compilation movie trilogy instead of the original Gundam series, but I personally thought the series was fantastic, and the rivalry no doubt gets a lot more screentime in it than in the movies. You can't watch the Zeta Gundam compilation movies, as its ending differs quite a lot from the actual ending for Zeta Gundam and renders everything past it non-canon.

Animesuggest,3e1xot,GeeJo,2,Tue Jul 21 10:59:06 2015 UTC,"Shingeki no Bahamut   Trailer: Subtitled version What it's about: Favaro is a bounty hunter with a rogueish charm, surviving on his wits and combat skills. He's made more than a few enemies in his time, including the relentless former nobleman Kaisar. By pure accident, a young woman of mysterious origins overhears one of his taller tales - about visiting the mythical land of Helheim - and mistakes it for the truth, taking him on as a guide. Why you should watch it: Bahamut was one of the biggest surprises of 2014. By all rights it should have just been another generic card-game adaptation of the kind that we've seen dozens of times before. Instead, what we got was a flawlessly animated major action-adventure series reminiscent of Pirates of the Caribbean or The Road to El Dorado. The cinematography and direction are fantastic, not just for a ""card game adaptation"" but by any standard. The characters are distinct, likeable, and consistent, with clean attractive designs. The story is leavened by a dose of humour (mostly well-executed sight gags), and the world itself is more interesting than I'd expected. It's just a really fun show to watch. Caveats: Shingeki no Bahamut is at its strongest when the episode isn't actually progressing the central plot all that much. The story itself is, at its core, a pretty generic fantasy adventure; it’s the character interactions that make the show what it is, and where it rightly spends most of its time. There's a noticeable dip in quality in the middle of the run, but even at its worst, it's still good television. Similar works: the aforementioned Pirates of the Caribbean. Within anime, Hitsugi no Chaika and Garo.     Zankyou no Terror   Trailer: PV Trailer What it’s about: Two teenagers with a mysterious past, who go by the codenames Nine and Twelve, engage in a battle of wits with the Tokyo police. While setting up terrorist attacks with an aim towards minimal casualties and maximum property damage, they run into the lonely Lisa Mishima, a schoolgirl desperate to find somewhere to belong.  Why you should watch it: Zankyou no Terror does for the terrorist what Dexter did for the serial killer. It provides a human face without trivialising the horror of what they're actually doing. The characters are complex and the premise is very interesting. It’s an intellectual thriller with a wealth of symbolism to be found with even a surface reading, from the legend of Oedipus to the use of light and dark to other, less obvious allusions. The soundtrack is thoroughly modern and the show contains one or two pieces of animation that are going to go down as a new high watermark.  Caveats: The second act is not quite as strong as the first, failing to capitalise on much of what made the opening episodes so interesting and introducing a rather cartoonish villain. For no apparent reason, really. Things pick back up towards the end, but a lot of time is wasted that could have been better spent on developing the characters and themes. Also beware of horrible, horrible Engrish. Themes: The power of symbols, which ties directly back into the theme of terrorism. A new generation’s rejection of (and by) the society of their elders. Antipathy towards the sins of the past and the shadows cast into the present. Youthful disaffection leading to rebellion leading to…revolution? Lots of playing around with this general motif. Similar works: Death Note. Eden of the East is kind of similar, but it's a lot more lighthearted."

If you haven't seen a lot of anime prior to watching this I would say you should go in with a grain of salt before you watching. To someone new to anime (like I was when I first started watching it) it can be way over the top.

Also if we're recommending VNs then Umineko no naku koro ni fits your requirement for crime scene analysis perfectly.

Animesuggest,3dxxna,synthesis11,8,Mon Jul 20 15:59:53 2015 UTC,"Daily Lives of Highschool Boys   Trailer: DVD Trailer What it’s about: Tadakuni, Yoshitake, and Hidenori are three utterly ordinary high school students. There’s no secret plot to take over Japan, no sports trophy to be won or grand romance to play out. There’s just the everyday world of teenagers in an all-boys academy; arguments, fantasies, awkward encounters and amusing yourself and your friends while hanging out. Why you should watch it: It’s one of the most accurate renditions of male adolescence that I can think of. All of the social awkwardness, jokes that only make sense to you and your friends, and all-around low-stakes activities that nonetheless have all the characters invested in their outcomes. The show is hilarious, and the short sketch format (each episode being broken into three or so individual segments) lends itself well to the setting. The cast steadily expands to keep things interesting, to the point where several of the original characters more or less fade into the background by the end. The Japanese voice actors play their parts perfectly, every single one. The “Literary Girl” skits are some of the funniest stuff I’ve seen in anime for a long while. Caveats: As with any comedy, there are going to be a few jokes you find unfunny, and when that happens you’re stuck with it while it plays out for the next ten minutes. It’s an almost exclusively male cast, so don’t go into it expecting your standard boobs-and-cute girls high school anime. Themes: Adolescence. Friendship and social awkwardness. Similar works: Nichijou, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun     Yondemasu yo, Azazel-san   Trailer: The PV Trailer for the second season is the most I can find. What it's about: The Akutabe Detective Agency is successful for a very unusual reason: it solves its cases by summoning demons. Thankfully for the world, these demons are incompetent, lewd, and limited in their powers by the act of summoning, but their abilities are more than enough to cause trouble. Akutabe's new intern Sakuma contracts with a particularly useless and perverted demon named Azazel, and struggles to get much work out of him at all. Why you should watch it: It's crude humour done well. Azazel-san never pretends to be more than it is, and instead revels in sex jokes, gross-out gags and slapstick. There's just so much crammed into every episode that you're certain to find something lowbrow to laugh at. And you can really tell that the voice actors were having a lot of fun with the script - to a man they all put in stellar performances. The art style and sound design are clean, bright, and complement the writing brilliantly - the character designs make great use of caricature for humour. And the episodes are only generally around 10-minutes long, so it's not that much of a time commitment to complete the whole run in a binge. Caveats: The show comprises a set of two-episode arcs, and some of the set-ups or characters do fall a little flat. When you find that you're not enjoying a particular storyline (for me, the 'pervert arc' and 'hospital arc' of the second season were a bit of a miss), it's easy enough to just skip ahead. There's no real greater storyline going on, though there are a few continuity gags thrown in here and there. Themes: ""Be careful what you wish for"", at least in the early episodes. It's fun to watch Sakuma's changing attitude and outlook as the series progresses and she's influenced by the idiocy and petty evil of the demonic side of the cast. Similar works: Gintama is probably the best comparison to make."

The main characters are all incredibly unique, and the situations (ESPECIALLY Harima) get into just make you roll on the floor laughing.  Next, I'll throw in twintails.

Still king of the humor genre, though.   Two other shows that do have some romance(-ish elements), but don't really harp on it and are absolutely at the top of my comedy pile: Full Metal Panic! Fumoffu and Hataraku Maou-sama! Fumoffu is technically S2 of a series, but it is pretty great standalone and is one of my absolute favorite anime period. Arakawa Under the Bridge is similar, but skews a bit more romance for me.  For pure humor, I favor Nichijou, Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou, Azumanga Daioh and Sakigake! Cromartie Koukou, all gag shows based on 4-panel mangas or similar.   I can also recommend Lucky Star, GJ-bu, Plastic Nee-san, Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt, FLCL, Yondemasu, Azazel-san, Gokusen, and Muteki Kanban Musume in a pinch, although none of them truly hit the spot consistently for me.

Animesuggest,3dy8fn,primealx,7,Mon Jul 20 14:44:26 2015 UTC,"Romeo x Juliet   Trailer: English dubbed version What it's about: Fourteen years ago, there was a coup in Neo Verona. The reigning Capulet family were slaughtered down to the last woman and child by their rivals, the Montagues. Or so it was thought. A single survivor, the duke's young daughter Juliet, was smuggled out of the castle and kept secret for over a decade while the ground was laid for a rebellion against the Montagues and a restoration of the Capulet dynasty. Juliet herself is unaware of her heritage, and has been fighting as a vigilante against the increasingly corrupt and violent city guard in defence of the people, when she runs into a young noble named Romeo - the son of Duke Montague.  Why you should watch it: It's an excellent example of the ""action romance"" genre, and balances both halves incredibly well. At the same time, the plot spins out at a perfect pace, neither lingering nor rushing through Juliet's progression and her coming to terms with her destiny. The animation and character designs are clean and well-executed, and the soundtrack (including a Japanese cover of ""You Raise Me Up"" as the title song) adds an emotional depth to every major scene. It's also interesting to see an ""outside view"" of Shakespeare's work; it's a different story than the one you might know, more fairy tale than Greek tragedy, but it's still quite well told. The English dub is well worth picking up if you don't have a strong preference for subs, as there's some poetic lines from the original work put in now and then that add some flavour to the script. Caveats: There is little effort put into creating nuanced antagonists. Montague himself is a classic moustache-twirling tyrant and the traitors, turncoats, and city guards are unambiguously evil. This simplification carries through into the plot itself, with much of the original tragedy excised and streamlined. As a standalone work the show is excellent; as a reflection of the classic play it's a little lacking. This is not exactly a fair comparison to make, though. Themes: Much like the original, doomed love is where the meat of the story lies. Acceptance of one's duties and obligations, and heroic sacrifice to see them through, is also a primary focus for Juliet's ""coming of age"" as well as several secondary characters. Similar works: The Twelve Kingdoms. If you want more adaptations of classic Western literature, try Zetsuen no Tempest or Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo      Maoyuu Maou Yuusha   Trailer: PV Trailer What it's about: The story starts where most others end: the Nameless Hero bursts into the throne room of the Demon King, looking to end the long war between humans and demons in one stroke. Except...the Demon ""King"" is actually a woman, and one who makes a series of cogent arguments showing that a quick end would only lead to civil war, and that for true peace, the pair must co-operate to spark an economic and political revolution in both kingdoms.  Why watch it: This is a pretty smart show, and it doesn't shy away from showing off in that regard. At the same time, the narrative balances the intellectual discussion with a strong romantic subplot and regular doses of action to keep things lively. It's a very binge-able show with something for everyone. The painted backgrounds are interesting to look at and the rest of the animation is equally above par. The voice actors for the two protagonists have worked together a lot (they previously played Holo and Kraft Lawrence from Spice and Wolf, and Lelouch and Kallen from Code Geass), and there's good chemistry between them. Caveats: The ending is quite abrupt. It resolves all the major plot threads while remaining open-ended, so it's not disappointing, but there's a definite invitation there to pick up the Light Novels or Manga (a second season is quite unlikely at this point). If macroeconomics bores you to tears, give this one a miss. Themes: Economics, politics, war, and peace (and how they relate to one another). Similar works: This show is basically a bridge between Spice and Wolf and Log Horizon, borrowing the director and voice actors from the former and the author from the latter, and there are strong thematic and stylistic ties at both ends. For a medieval fantasy setting and a general anti-war message, also check out Junketsu no Maria. For a less serious “modernising the medieval” take, try Outbreak Company."

Animesuggest,3dydz0,reisumi,8,Mon Jul 20 22:45:38 2015 UTC,"Serial Experiments Lain   Trailer: English dubbed trailer What it's about: Lain is an isolated, troubled girl. At home, her parents and sister barely acknowledge her existence, and at school her only link to her classmates is her friend Alice. Hers isn't a unique situation, of course - all across the world, people are becoming disconnected from their real lives, in favour of the digital experiences of the Internet. But increasingly strange events seem to point to a deeper connection between Lain and the world of the Wired. Why you should watch it: Lain is a unique experience. It's a moody, existential work that trusts the audience enough to let them draw their own conclusions about what is going on, about what is real and why things are playing out as they are. The sound design is fantastic, getting a lot of work out of extended silences, and the soundtrack suits the show. The director's background in Japanese horror shines through in almost every aspect of the show - there are no (or few) ""jump scares"", but Lain manages to evoke an intense feeling of isolation and unease. If you're up for a slow-burning psychological show that presents you with puzzles and questions you're going to have to spend some time (or a second viewing) unwrapping, give it a go. Caveats: I think the above section should be enough to decide whether to watch the show or not. It is slow-burning, it is existential and philosophical, and there isn't a lot of traditional anime ""action"" going on. Decide for yourself if that's what you're looking for, because the show makes no apologies. Themes: The division of fantasy and reality is the heart of the show, with a lot of musing going on about the nature of the self - if everyone agrees on the nature of reality, or that you are a certain type of person, can you really dispute those perceptions? Can a person have more than one identity at a time, and deliberately craft those identities to display different aspects of themselves while still remaining whole? Similar works: The works of Satoshi Kon, particularly Paranoia Agent. Texhnolyze, Ergo Proxy.     No Longer Human   Trailer: Fan-made trailer What it's about:  Yozo Oba leaves high school lost and alienated. Disconnected from his family and with no sense of purpose, he falls into a cycle of self-abuse, depression and drugs that taints his life for years. The story is told in three chapters, with each chapter depicting him at different points in his life and the slow, steady spiral into oblivion that he seems incapable of escaping.  Why watch it:No Longer Human is a reimagining of a classic Japanese tale, bringing it into the modern era. It’s a first-rate character study of a suicidally depressed man as he struggles and fails to cope with everyday life. It's a pretty harrowing and ugly watch, but as a psychological work it's first-rate. Caveats: The story is about depression and so is naturally going to be a little slow and, you guessed it, depressing. Just know what you're getting into. Themes: Depression, self-loathing, alienation. Similar works: The rest of the works in the Aoi Bungaku Series are similar adaptations of literature, and several examine other flavours of mental instability with much the same depth shown here. They're all by different directors, and the animation and general ""feel"" changes with each new arc."

The first 20 minutes are totaly representative of what the whole film is like. It's very bittersweet.

The only series that comes to my mind is Hakuoki. I didn't really enjoy it that much - but it's pretty popular. The brother's one of the antagonists and he's unhealthily obsessed with her - he's not one of the main characters.

Animesuggest,3dwtu4,ScalaZen,2,Mon Jul 20 15:45:18 2015 UTC,"I would recommend Gungrave.  The first episode makes you think its going to be a pretty straightforward action anime.  The next episode is set 10-13 years before the first episode, in this we are introduced to the MCs, Brandon Heat and Harry McDowel.  Harry is the leader of a street punk gang and Brandon is the quiet strong arm that will do whatever Harry wants him to.  You follow them as they eventually whined up getting mixed up with the mob.  Harry is all about it as he wants to have power and a better life, Brandon is hesitant but doesn't want to leave his best friend.  Over the course of the show you see these two go on separate paths but both wind up climbing the ranks through different means.  Harry uses his natural instincts and his charming demeanor to get closer to the big bosses while Brandon works at the lowest level collect money from deadbeats who aren't paying their gambling debts, usually with force.  Once Harry speaks to Brandon about how he should present himself better and strive for greatness Brandon takes it to heart and begins getting better at what he does and becomes the top level hit man for the mob.  Now although this is a lot of info keep in mind I haven't divulged anything from the other plot lines of this show, it does have a few that begin and end as their stories cross paths with Harry and Brandon.  If absolutely nothing else this show is full of VERY well designed characters that each have their own history that takes place before the show starts and does quite a bit to make the crazy people you meet feel like a real person that given the circumstances of their life and their distrust in others, or desire for power would be hard pressed to say no.  Granted remember this isn't a realistic show overall but most of it entails Harry and Brandon just being bad ass mafioso's."

Serial Experiments Lain / 5. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann / 6. Puella Magi Madoka Magicka (Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica) Edit: Little disclaimer, I literally just went on Google and typed "" animes like Neon Genesis Evangelion "" and those are what I found, so...I have no idea if these are even similar, but I hope they are :D"
Animesuggest,3dwtu4,DubzOnlyPlz,15,Mon Jul 20 05:00:22 2015 UTC,"RahXephon is like Evangelion in the same way that YuYuYu is like Madoka - it's a riff on the same thing, overshadowed by the parent work Gunbuster is like Evangelion in that it's a rough draft of Anno's thoughts. You can see the seeds of the series, but it's still quite a different show - it starts as a parody of Aim for the Ace! and ends as a Super Robot spectacle. I haven't seen Bokurano yet Serial Experiments Lain is like Evangelion in that it's a very introspective, philosophical work that gets a lot of work out of the silences and deliberate exclusions of information. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is basically everything Evangelion isn't, and deliberately so. It's a reaction against it, and wouldn't be the way it was if Evangelion hadn't changed expectations. Madoka Magica is like Evangelion in that it's a ""mature"" take on a genre that had come to be identified with a particular younger audience - magical girls instead of mecha - and makes strong use out of symbolism and characters-as-psychological-models.   I'm not sure that suggesting the top results of Google without context is really in the spirit of the sub.    In terms of what the body of the request asked for, Madoka and Lain are probably the best bets - they're not mecha, their aesthetics are quite different, but they take the same approach to character development and leaving interpretations to the viewer."
Animesuggest,3dwtu4,GeeJo,4,Mon Jul 20 05:19:10 2015 UTC,"I have seen them all so i will go ahead and comment,    RahXephon is often times skipped over by most fans as being and Eva clone, so that in itself should be all the recommendation you need. The premise and setting in the first few episodes will leave you saying ""this is just like eva."" While they are fairly similar in a lot respects, RahXephon avoids some of the pitfalls of eva and isn't quite as dense/ its a little more straight forward (just a little) It still has some great character development so i think it is a great first stop if you want something like EVA. Gunbuster -  This is another mecha series and the reason this is recommened is because it shares the same director as Eva. Gunbuster was the first series Hideaki Anno directed, and you can see a lot Eva's roots in this series. This series is a little shorter, but the character development follows a very similar path and will feel familiar to you as someone who liked eva.  Bokurano - This is a fantastic series that i would highly recommend, but i wouldn't recommend it to you in this thread. Bokurano is a darker series involving mecha's, but based on what you are looking for a would save it for another time. The main reason is that it has a large cast of characters with at most 2 or 3 episodes focused on each one before it moves on. I think its something worth watching but it doesn't fit what your description all that well. Serial Experiments Lain - This is the first diversion in genre. This series has no mecha's and doesn't even have any action to speak of. Of the ones listed it is by far the most dense. The level of ambiguity and the number of interpretation of this work are extremely high. It will most definitely get you thinking.  As far as character development, there isn't to much character interaction in this one. The conflicts are more with society and within ones self, so the eva clashing of personalities doesn't really happen here. But if you want something to get you thinking, this will do it.  Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann -  This is one on the list that is least like Eva, and it is the one i would recommend not watching if you really want something like NGE. It isn't bad, its just the other end of the mecha spectrum. This series is goofy to crazy levels. There isn't really anything that is up for interpretation or that is ambiguous. It is extremely straightforward in its balls to the walls approach to things. The character growth is there in that it is more a coming of age, but the internal character development on multiple characters just isn't present. Madoka Magica - This is another departure in genre as this is a magical girl anime. I would say that this fits pretty well. It has strong internal character development on multiple characters. The conflict forces growth in interesting ways. I wouldn't say that it is very ambiguous or up for interpretation. It is pretty straightforward and the good parts are the darker twists and turns that are taken. This is a fantastic series, though i think the comparison is more of a stretch in my mind.    There's my thoughts on the comparison to EVA, and of these i would definitly recommend RahXephon, Gunbuster, and Lain to you based on what you are looking for with Madoka being sorta close. Hope it helps clarify."
Animesuggest,3dwtu4,Bigfatk,2,Mon Jul 20 05:33:48 2015 UTC,"This is a very good assessment. I'd add that, TTGL is sort of a reconstruction to Eva's deconstruction. Eva took apart the super robot genre to see what makes it tick, and what would happen to more realistic characters in this context. The creators of TTGL took that information, and used that to make super robot anime *better"", while also responding to some of the not-so-good dark conspiratorial anime to come out in the wake of Eva (like Arjuna). I'd describe TTGL as the Kingdom Come to Eva's Watchmen.  To add another recommendation, if you're not fansub averse (and it's not hard to find on the Usual Places), there's Space Runaway Ideon. To continue with the comic comparison, if Eva is Watchmen, than Ideon is Miracleman - the prototype that laid the groundwork that would come later, in terms of the character depth of the story, the tone, and even the ending (in the sense of End of Eva more than eps. 25-26)."

Animesuggest,3dwtu4,DangeresqueIII,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:06:41 2015 UTC,"In regards to recommendation for anime particular with character depth and exploration, I'd recommend the following. I'll be echoing a few people who've already posted, which should just give more reason to see them. :)    Serial Experiments Lain: An experimental anime made on a tight budget, this show examines the possibilities in the invention of the Internet and one young girl's attempt to solve the mystery of who she is. It's themes about identity are similar to a few that Eva tackles and it's look at how the Internet affects people is still surprisingly topical. Abe was perceptive for his time. Paranoia Agent: I can only recommend this one tangientally since I haven't made time to watch it ye, but the show explores the different ways that individuals that come into contact with a recurring character deal with emotions like terror, helplessness, and ideas of self worth. It's episodic, so most episodes showcase one or two characters that don't interact with the others, but it's still a great exploration into fear and death. Also it's by Satoshi Kon, the director behind Perfect Blue. Shin Sekai Yori: While this show has a lot more attention to detail concerning the world and plot than Eva does, the characters and their varying interactions are extremely important and vastly change the way the plot moves. There are time jumps and some long arcs, but the characters have diversity and agency and are extremely individualistic and interesting. Puella Magi Madoka Magica: A deconstructive magical girl show (though there isn't a strict agreement on that consensus) that takes tropes presented in Sailor Moon and Card Captor Sakura and adds real life consequences. The characters are interesting and dismantled like they are in Eva, though they aren't as strong, and they are the forefront of the narrative. There are missing plot details like Eva, and some people get caught up in those, but most do not."

Animesuggest,3dwtu4,phil3570,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:37:53 2015 UTC,"It's already been said but throwing my own recommendation behind it:  Space Runaway Ideon is a series written and directed by Yoshiyuki Tomino following the cancellation of Mobile Suit Gundam.  The story is about a group of Earth colonists who are attacked by an alien civilization and who are now forced to flee across the universe aboard a ship of unknown origin.  A lot of parallels can be drawn to Gundam, especially in how Ideon portrays the reality of being forced to fight and the effects of war on it's mostly civilian crew. Still, because of the amount of unknowns throughout the series (Where did the ship and the giant robot Ideon come from? Why were they buried underground? Who are the aliens attacking them?), the end result is something entirely different with it's own unique twists.  Should note that Ideon, like the original Gundam, was cancelled early. It's complete ending came out several years later with the movie Be Invoked which is very much recommended in addition to the main series as it brings closure to it.  (There's also a recap movie A Contact -- it tells the basic story of the main series but guts most of the character development and isn't recommended.)"

Animesuggest,3dxkun,scodeth,4,Mon Jul 20 10:55:00 2015 UTC,"I haven't checked out everything yet, but so far my recommendations would be:   Charlotte - The latest show from KEY, who are well-regarded for a bunch of their previous sci-fi/romance/drama titles (Clannad, Kanon, Angel Beats etc.) Looks set to become a proper KEY-style tearjerker as the show goes on. If you haven't seen any of their stuff before, this is worth a try, especially if you're into emotional series; if you've seen anything by KEY already, you'll probably know by now whether or not you like their style.  Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou - A somewhat fanservice-y harem/romantic comedy with monster girls. It doesn't try to be much more than brainless fun, but it does a damn good job at doing that.  Jitsu wa Watashi wa - Another romance comedy with monster girls, oddly enough, but this one has more of a late-90s, early-00s retro style. At this point it the old cliches almost feel fresh again for me - your mileage may vary, but I'm definitely enjoying this as lighthearted fun. Shokugeki no Souma - Kind of a mixed bag of genres, but it's probably best described as 'a shounen cooking show with a mix of comedy and drama.' It's a feel-good series that still doesn't forget the story, and uses a large character cast to build its world. There's some fanservice in the first few episodes, but it fades away quickly enough as the show goes on, and the anime as a whole really does improve with each episode. If the premise interests you even vaguely, try to stick with it for a while. Rokka no Yuusha - An action/fantasy anime that takes a fairly run-of-the-mill premise (a group coming together to defeat the demon lord) but stands out with its unique setting (largely a mixture of Mayan and medieval influences). Could end up anywhere from great to terrible, but it's passed the three-episode test and is picking up steam as it goes. Gakkou Gurashi - I'm going to parrot what most other people say on this one: it's best not to describe the show too much, but give it an episode and see what you think. You might like it, you might not, but it goes interesting places and is worth 25 minutes of your time.

Prison School goes for (relatively) more realistic character designs, a dark colour scheme, and a generally crude, unhappy vibe; it's got a focus on physical and cringe humour, masochism, etc. Monster Musume is almost the polar opposite, with a bright and energetic colour palette alongside a generally more upbeat script and characters.   You might like both of them regardless, but I guess what I'm trying to say is to not watch one, dislike it, and then disregard the other because they're part of the same genre. Some people enjoy both shows, while others have differing opinions on the two - MonMusu is shaping up to be my top guilty pleasure of the season, while Prison School was... very much not my kind of thing.

Gangsta - Seinen stuff. It fills this rarely satisfied seinen spot in a season. Best OP music this season too.  Game of Laplace - Insta-favorite once the third episode kicks in. The works its based on Rampo Edogawa mystery fictions. If you ever read Detective Conan (or Case Closed), Conan Edogawa is literally a play on the name of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Rampo Edogawa. Psycho-Pass-ish in ""visuals"". Great OP and ED. Sleeper hit of the season.  Gate - Sold me on the manga right after the first episode. I like where the manga is going. Less of a ""should I watch it"" and more like ""should I read it"". Best World meets World dynamic and development (the manga have some serious shit) so far.  Charlotte - Hated the writing but this hooks me right from the aesthetics and characters. Most beautiful OP this season (seems PA Works is cashing out those bounties from Shirobako). KEY and Jun Maeda work. This is like Angel Beats all over again. With more budget at least. And better characters.  Shokugeki no Soma - Good shit. Both manga and the anime. Shounen with the right pacing, right characters, and right visuals. It is the right ""shounen"" story I would recommend to anyone.  And finally:  Overlord - Log Horizon/SAO with a twist.

Animesuggest,3dv2bl,CermaSL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:36:18 2015 UTC,"Yondemasu yo, Azazel-san   Trailer: The PV Trailer for the second season is the most I can find. What it's about: The Akutabe Detective Agency is successful for a very unusual reason: it solves its cases by summoning demons. Thankfully for the world, these demons are incompetent, lewd, and limited in their powers by the act of summoning, but their abilities are more than enough to cause trouble. Akutabe's new intern Sakuma contracts with a particularly useless and perverted demon named Azazel, and struggles to get much work out of him at all. Why you should watch it: It's crude humour done well. Azazel-san never pretends to be more than it is, and instead revels in sex jokes, gross-out gags and slapstick. There's just so much crammed into every episode that you're certain to find something lowbrow to laugh at. And you can really tell that the voice actors were having a lot of fun with the script - to a man they all put in stellar performances. The art style and sound design are clean, bright, and complement the writing brilliantly - the character designs make great use of caricature for humour. And the episodes are only generally around 10-minutes long, so it's not that much of a time commitment to complete the whole run in a binge. Caveats: The show comprises a set of two-episode arcs, and some of the set-ups or characters do fall a little flat. When you find that you're not enjoying a particular storyline (for me, the 'pervert arc' and 'hospital arc' of the second season were a bit of a miss), it's easy enough to just skip ahead. There's no real greater storyline going on, though there are a few continuity gags thrown in here and there. Themes: ""Be careful what you wish for"", at least in the early episodes. It's fun to watch Sakuma's changing attitude and outlook as the series progresses and she's influenced by the idiocy and petty evil of the demonic side of the cast. Similar works: Gintama is probably the best comparison to make, though Azazel-san is generally cruder."

Animesuggest,3dthhe,Nokel,4,Sun Jul 19 14:54:26 2015 UTC,There are other shows with practically omnipotent MCs that are much much better written and handled. One example is Maoyu.
Animesuggest,3dthhe,Silvard,3,Sun Jul 19 17:41:57 2015 UTC,"Bad in that it has very poor writing.  There's nothing especially intelligent or interesting in the way the MC overcomes enemies, it's simply new powers revealed as needed. The point of mentioning his 'specialness' was to highlight the absurdity of it all, and the extremes to which the writer takes it.  Overpoweredness itself is not fundamentally the problem - it's the premise of things like One Punch Man, for instance. The way Mahouka takes itself rather seriously is what truly drives it into so-bad-it's-somewhat-funny territory."

So if you're looking for character drama, that isn't going to happen very much.  The story shows the state at which magic science is at and the current role of magicians in society; as weapons, their education system, and as a culture.

Animesuggest,3dthhe,nyahdon,22,Sun Jul 19 12:05:46 2015 UTC,"Hellsing Ultimate   Trailer: The official one flat-out sucks. This one's a bit better, though it’s a little too long. What it's about: There's a secret battle going on in the dark corners of the world, a fight against ghouls, vampires, and who knows what else. The Hellsing Organisation of Great Britain is pledged to defend the realm against all such dangers. At the same time, it is locked in a continual struggle against the encroachment of the rival Catholic Church into its jurisdiction. Both tasks are becoming ever more difficult but, thankfully, they have an ace up their sleeve - an ancient vampire named Alucard who fights for reasons of his own. The question is: how far can he be trusted? Why watch it?: It's gory, dark, and action-packed from start to finish. Alucard is overpowered as hell, so if you're a fan of ""badass protagonists"", Hellsing Ultimate is a pretty safe bet. I'm a huge fan of the soundtrack too, which has a very distinctively dissonant jazzy feel to it. The story is relatively simple, but it sticks to its strengths and never gives the audience a dull moment. Caveats: Don't bother with the original series, Ultimate is the one you want to go for. The gore and fight scenes are deliberately over the top, Tarantinoesque.  Similar works: Elfen Lied, Tokyo Ghoul.     Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei   Trailer: Aniplex Trailer What it’s about: Magic is no longer a mystery, but a codified science upon which all modern militaries depend. To encourage development of the necessary skills, national academies have been set up for prospective talents to hone their skills. Tatsuya and Miyuki Shiba have just enrolled in ""First High"", only to discover that prejudice and classism are rife within the student body. Why you should watch it: This is an unapologetic power fantasy. It does away with the usual tropes of having the protagonist start out weak only to discover their true potential - Tatsuya starts off leagues ahead of his peers and stays that way. The magic system, politics, and general worldbuilding is intricate and detailed, and a lot of attention is lavished upon making sure the audience keeps up. The animation of the fight sequences is also pretty fantastic.  Caveats: The pacing is really, really weird. The complexity of the world requires a lot of exposition, which isn't handled as adroitly as one might hope - lots of sit-down ""As You Know"" conversations. There is a heavy (albeit one-way) incestual romantic substory going on, so if that squicks you out, I’d probably avoid the series. Themes: Objectivist-leaning discussion on privilege, responsibility, and classism Similar works: The world of A Certain Magical Index/A Certain Scientific Railgun is in many ways quite similar, though the story and characters are quite different."

The anime is lighthearted, the characters are incredibly fun and the whole idea is just so fresh even though it's an ecchi. I don't even watch it for the fanservice, I watch it because everything else is just so damned feel-good.

Together with the second season that would occupy you for roughly fifty episodes. If you think the art in still images looks offputting, I recommend at least giving it a couple of episodes and seeing what you think. One Outs might be worth a look too.  Yamato 2199 is a neat space opera/war story with some very nice battles and a kind of fun adventurous vibe. It's very sincere and absolutely doubles down on naval metaphors for space warfare and on fantastical space opera stuff, if those are deal breakers. Here's a trailer."

Animesuggest,3duju9,ace-s,2,Sun Jul 19 16:49:13 2015 UTC,"I would say, first off- the shows first like 8 episodes made me want to drop it. It felt silly. I would say things to look out for are situations that feel real, because Mawaru takes from a TON of real life events to unfold its plot. Its a show that after you watch i recommend you go read a few articles about why exactly its such a complicated show. You can enjoy it without knowing anything going in, like i did but you will enjoy it more once you read exactly what is based on fact and what the director was aiming to say."
Animesuggest,3duju9,Savassan,2,Sun Jul 19 18:43:25 2015 UTC,"Check out Night on the Galactic Railroad, Ikuhara lifts a lot of visuals and symbols from it and there's even dialog in the first episode that refers to the novel that it's based on. I know it's an older movie, but seeing it at some point on your Penguindrum journey, even if it's right after you finish, will help you make a bit more sense of things. The novel/film is a classic taught in Japanese schools so the show was made with the assumption that the viewer would be familiar with it.  If you're feeling a bit more ambitious Ikuhara draws upon Haruki Murakami's work, most specifically the short story Super Frog Saves Tokyo and his non-fiction book (some spoilers). You can understand the show without a familiarity with Murakami though."
Animesuggest,3duju9,ChangloriousBasterds,2,Sun Jul 19 22:37:05 2015 UTC,"Are you familiar with the director Ikuhara at all?  Not saying you need to know his previous work to get Mawaru (in fact I think it's the best entry point into his work in some ways), but understanding a bit about his sensibilities might help making sense of the show.  He directed most of the original Sailor Moon and Revolutionary Girl Utena.  So you might keep an eye out for how he plays around with the concept of magical girls in Mawaru.  But really I wouldn't worry about all that too much and just enjoy the show the first time around.  It might have you scratching your head here and there but it does make sense in the end.  It's not just complicated for the sake of it."
Animesuggest,3duju9,2233e,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:09:00 2015 UTC,"I would say don't judge the show by it's first episode. The first episode  was quite crazy which can be off-putting or intriguing depending on other people - and you maybe like wtf did I just watch. It is definitely misleading as in it seems really cute and bubbly but it's quite a dark show. Also, I think it has one of the most unique and unexpected endings in an anime. Great anime overall!"

The same things have different meaning as it goes along, it has to do with repetition within a song structure, but I'm too tired to explain that point any further at the moment. It gets more and more emotional throughout the entire show, and from what I remember, it was mostly the 2nd half that made me cry, and I cried a lot. Like, damn near constantly for 12 episodes, getting worse and worse as it went along all the way to the last episode. I had a clear advantage going in, though, having been a musician for almost a decade and all."

I have a feeling this was a significant reason why I enjoyed this series so much (I started piano lessons at the age of 6 and completed my lessons at the age of 17; I'm 27 now). People said there was melodrama, and I can't deny that there is. However, I've certainly felt the terror of being on stage and being judged for every note, every dynamic, every slight breath of silence between phrases at a competition or exam. I've felt the terror and nervousness so much that, once, I nearly forgot where the starting position of my hands was supposed to be on the keyboard once I sat down. I've felt the thrill of finishing my piece and knowing I nailed it to the best of my ability, but I've also felt the worst guilt and humiliation of totally screwing up a piece and thinking about stopping the performance half-way through to save myself any further embarrassment. I once participated in a piano competition, where all but one of the competitors was around 16-18 years old, but we were all soundly beaten by a 10-year-old kid. So, yeah, there was melodrama and narrative for a lot of that, but honestly, their thoughts often mirrored my own when I was in that position.  (And for the second arc,"

Animesuggest,3dtkxb,_vogonpoetry_,2,Sun Jul 19 14:24:59 2015 UTC,I don't like melodrama. I don't like Your Lie in April. Personally I didn't mind the show at the point you are at. I hated it for how dumb it gets later.
Animesuggest,3dtkxb,revoopy,2,Sun Jul 19 17:27:10 2015 UTC,I didn't really like it at the beginning because of out of place comedy and didn't like main heroine.   I don't know what episode it was but it got better for me - probably around where you are. By the end it became one of my favorites.  The difference between us is I liked the internal monologue because I could connect to the MC. You don't magically get over these things - especially as a teenager. Personally took me from about the 4th grade till 12th grade to make even a little significant progress with a similar but less traumatic situation.  Anyways there is another arc after that one - which many like more - without his creepy mom.  Also these type of threads are always going to bring out people who don't like the show so you are guaranteed to get many responses telling you its overrated and bad. Not that those opinions are true or false but don't let them influence you and decide by yourself.

All in all, I think the characters were way too young to portray what they were supposed to(shit, they're in fucking middle school). The pacing is shit, some(a lot) of character's are ultimately pointless, character development came way too late for some.  In essence, it is just a worse Anohana or Nodame Cantabile(these two shows have noting in common, but both share themes with Shigatsu.)  Guess what I'm saying is, if you didn't like the first half, you won't like the second."

Nodame I havent seen, but Im pretty sure its a cutesy shoujo romcom.  If anything, I'd say to watch the second season of ef: A Tale of Memories if you want a show similar to YLiA"

Most romance shows with drama and tragedy are comparable to some extent, I guess.. I kinda thought the second halves of Shigatsu and Clannad After Story were fairly similar. Aside from making me cry my guts out, I mean  ef: A Tale of Melodies has some blatantly obvious similarities, though, and after reading the comment by /u/ExOsc2 it seems to have everything that was expected to be in Shigatsu and wasn't. Plus, it's made by Shaft (Madoka, Monogatari) so you know it's good shit."
Animesuggest,3dtkxb,HughSurname,2,Sun Jul 19 11:39:03 2015 UTC,"I... doubt that's what they meant. Nodame is a josei comedy. There's very little drama going on - even then, it mostly deals with the characters' music careers and growth as a zany yet absurdly adorable couple."
Animesuggest,3dtkxb,Hatsie7,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:50:33 2015 UTC,"Ill take the opposite of what I think will be the main opinion here: it doesn't get better.  That might not be entirely fair. It does get more emotional. But man at the start of the show I thought I was in for another Nodame Cantabile, BECK, or maybe even Sakamichi no Apollon. But it dragged, and dragged and dragged. It was almost unbearable. I felt really mislead: At the beginning of the anime I thought this was going to be a story focused on romance and characters and drama; with music tieing it all together. Instead it felt more like the story of Kousei's internal problems and how he overcame them. It's not what I wanted. I wanted romance and/or heartbreak and drama between characters. There wasn't nearly enough to satisfy me. And in my opinion the ending is pretty meh.  Perhaps it isn't fair of me to impose what I personally want onto an anime. But it was hard to sit each week and say ""this week we'll see some romance or some drama"" and (seemingly) each week instead it was ""heres more of Kousei's internal problems, and more of the status quo in regards to the health/emotions of the other other characters.  So if you were hoping for a romance that actually went somewhere, it doesn't get better. Its not a bad show by any means, but not what I was hoping for with how the first few episodes were."

I watch a lot of anime and have dropped a lot of shows what are concidered really good. If anime bores me there's no way I can push through another 10 episodes until it gets ""good"".   So my point is, that everyone have different tastes. While I considered Shigatsu an 10/10 anime, I can see why people may not like it though."

I am gonna quote something I posted long ago as it still fits the bill.  ""Go watch Gankutsuou. It is the modern take on The Count of Monte Cristo. The story has many mature themes and frankly is very enjoyable.  Aoi Bungaku Series if you like semi-episodic anime based on Japanease stories. This is a must watch for anyone who likes good looking anime with an amazing plot. Each few episodes the book changes and so does the art and the plot. A solid choice to watch next.  Lastly, Baccano! might also be something worth your while as it is based on a novel. The whole anime is based in 30's New York but with a twist. There is a bunch of immortals running around this city with stories that go to many themes and intertwine with each other. The anime follows the stories of these immortals. A simple must watch for any anime fan out there and an easy access anime if you wanna watch it with someone else as the Dub is amazing and goes above and beyond.""  And keep in mind Baccano! is soon to be re-watched and discussed on r/anime. It is a must see anime with an amazing dub and no better time to watch it than now :D  Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is mindfuck anime to the max. Show or movies work nicely. Movies have better art and the first two movies cover the whole show while the third movie is new-ish and continues the story. Do not read on this anime or you will be spoiled. No way around it.  1/2"
Animesuggest,3dtd12,goh13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:54:42 2015 UTC,"Now, for more recent stuff, try to watch the KnK movies in you PTW list. All of them are good but number 6 is rather.........meh to be honest. Number 5 is easily a 10 for me. Such an awesome anime work all around.   Parasyte Maxim tells the story of someone who gets an another being stuck in them and the moral choices they have to make. Imagine Tokyo Ghoul but with realistic MC, awesome fights and the show being not gay like TG and you get Parasyte. You can also think of it as a bloodier Death Note without killing humans part.  Katanagatari is an amazing overlooked adventure anime. It has a good story if you can swallow the first episode. Although half the fun is in the characters so drop the anime if they do not grow on you but they probably will.  Patema Inverted is a rather good movie I just watched. Not a lot of mindfucks but can be stressful to think about the world they live in. Great voice acting, art and story really sell this movie for anyone planning to have a good time.  And by far the best show I have seen, a perfect show that got a perfect 10 from me, Shinsekai Yori. This show is a masterpiece all around. If you like a good story, this show was made for you! The show worst arc is the first 8 episodes but I think they were great nonetheless and episode 8 made some people hate the show but do not let that discourage you from this gem as the show changes tone right after that.  I am willing to explain how amazing SY is but that would be a waste of time as time not watching this amazing show is time wasted, IMO.   All these shows and movies have their share of twists, darkness, thriller elements and sometimes comedy. I hope you enjoy all of them because most of them were recommend for me long ago when my list was rather short. Let the good karma flow :D  2/2"

I dropped those last two series though, but they are ""must-watches"" because ""must-watches"" are defined by the community, when you ask someone ""what do you think the must-watch series are?"" you're not asking them ""What are your favourite series?"", you're asking them ""What do you think the community regards as the best series?"".  Star Wars is a must-watch series, but star wars is overrated and a bit crap, Doctor Who is a must-watch series, but I bloody hate time-travel. Ghost in the Shell is a must-watch series and i'll get round to it eventually."

Animesuggest,3dt8k1,LeafErickson,2,Sun Jul 19 08:25:56 2015 UTC,"The one's you mentioned are shows that people who are new to the genre should watch because they're above average and easy to follow.For people who have already been watching anime for a couple years I'd go with Gunbuster/Diebuster, Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and Kids on the Slope."
Animesuggest,3dt8k1,SeeOtter,2,Sun Jul 19 06:12:49 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of ""what shows everyone should watch"" stems from what series you got hooked on anime with, or what anime got you hooked again when you were starting to feel passive about it. There's a lot of series that got such a running they became ""cult classics"" regardless of their actual individual merit. Essentially, the shows everyone should watch boils down to ""what shows would you suggest to newcomers to anime"" and ""what shows would you hold back from that list, but suggest later.""  A lot of people would easily throw Death Note or FMA are ""newbie"" shows as they're very easy for anyone to watch. Then there are shows like Gintama, in which you should probably have some more anime under your belt before watching (or so I've been told). Then there are shows where you think ""man, this is an amazing show, but maybe I should hold out on this one for a bit.""  So if you put together all those suggestions you'd have a good list of the shows everyone ""needs"" to watch. The problem moving away from those suggestions is that you'll be straying into your preferences, which would obviously stray away from ""universal appeal"". It may be your personal favourite show in the galaxy, but if its not digestible by everyone, you can't really add it to the list.  I would assume that shows that are universally appealing would then be really popular and thus make that ""newbie"" list, but I suppose it could just be that there are enough shows like that that went under the radar.  /end tired rambling"

Animesuggest,3dt8k1,genericperson,2,Sun Jul 19 06:36:48 2015 UTC,"I don't really think there are any 'must-watch' or 'should-watch' titles; watch what you like. But if you want some thoughts about some possibilities pre-2000, here's an extremely partial and incomplete set of thoughts:   Sabu and Ichi Detective Tales, a kind of neat black & white limited animation show about an Edo-period crimefighter and a blind swordsman. Not fully subbed, but worth seeing an episode or two just to get a sense for really old anime. Prince of the Sun: both a good representative of early Toei filmmaking, and something that looks forward towards the work of Ghibli Ashita no Joe: classic and highly influential sports show. Mazinger Z and Getter Robo, the first piloted mecha show and the first combining mecha show respectively. These are hard to watch in their original forms, and, though you're welcome to disagree, I think for a lot of anime fans it's easier to watch modern reflexes of them like New Getter Robo (but see the Getter primer for your options on that) and Shin Mazinger Z (which is amazing). Space Battleship Yamato: a key space opera and IIRC the first anime which created fanclubs. The original is good fun but quite hokey in places, so those who aren't hardened to all the material might just want to watch 2199. Rose of Versailles: highly influential Dezaki shoujo. Oscarrrrr! Mobile Suit Gundam: by which I mean the '79 TV series, not the whole franchise; you can watch the compilation films, if you want -- unusually, they don't damage the TV version too much. Possibly because the TV version, while it has its virtues, isn't consistently amazing. Perhaps something to file under ' This exists and is important, but may or may not be to your taste'. Super Dimensional Fortress Macross and/or the related film Do You Remember Love?: anime talks about pop culture, and itself. Most of the time it remembers how silly it is and does a good job of being entertainment. Fist of the North Star: premier and influential 80s shounen splatter action. Unusual among long-running shounen battle shows for having a hero who is already an adult and is clearly more powerful than almost (but not absolutely) everyone else in the show. Here's an ANN column about it. Daicon III and IV opening animations: early Gainax go crazy, please fans, win plaudits. Megazone 23 (part 1): not the first OVA but possibly(?) the first to get a big budget treatment. Has a couple of decent twists. Touch: possibly the most important Adachi adaptation. Cynics would say you could have more fun in less time by watching Cross Game… Urusei Yatsura: sitcom; seventy-something episodes directed (IIRC) by Mamoru Oshii. This exists and is important, but may or may not be to your taste. Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise: early Gainax go wild with the largest budget at that time ever allocated to a Japanese animated feature film. Unlike most of the rest of early Gainax's output, in that it has a certain sincerity not smothered by fannish in-jokes. Some sick animation. Patlabor in its various forms: an unusually restrained and dry comedy by anime standards, with relatively normal adult working people as its heroes. The first and second films, directed by Oshii, are excellent, especially the second one. Bubblegum Crisis: a fair representative for late-80s OVAs, in good and bad ways. Legend of the Galactic Heroes: anime's greatest space opera, perhaps one of the best space operas in any medium. Akira: it's Akira. Gunbuster: classic early Gainax, with a powerful ending. Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still: a moving and comprehensive tribute to Mitsuteru Yokoyama, directed by the mighty Imagawa also loads of fun; huge story, huge soundtrack and wild martial-arts battles. Macross Plus: for my money the best Macross title; still anime's finest dogfighting scenes; stands well on its own; Yoko Kanno soundtrack; co-directed by Shinichiro Watanabe ('the Cowboy Bebop guy'). Ghost in the Shell: key cyberpunk film and one of Oshii's best. Dear Brother: Osamu Dezaki returns to the idea of young women in an intense, aristocratic environment behaving badly ala Rose of Versailles. Dezaki's important not just because he was a good director, but also because he was influential for various other directors, including Shinbou and Ikuhara. Sailor Moon: This exists and is important, but may or may not be to your taste. You can catch Ikuhara cutting his teeth in some seasons. Neon Genesis Evangelion: it's Evangelion. Cowboy Bebop: it's Cowboy Bebop. Ninja Scroll or, really, any other significant Kawajiri thing that'd give you a sense of his style—Wicked City or Cyber City Oedo 808, for example. There needs to be some Kawajiri somewhere on a list like this. Memories: three really neat sf short films. Overall head of the project was Otomo, the director of Akira. Includes some early script and art direction work from Satoshi Kon. Serial Experiments Lain: Lain will mess with your head. GaoGaiGar: the glorious last hurrah of the Yuusha franchise. This exists and is important, but may or may not be to your taste. Revolutionary Girl Utena: perhaps the best shoujo TV anime ever made; something that looks back to Rose of Versailles and forward to your Princess Tutus and Penguindrums. Perfect Blue: Kon's feature film direction debut and a brilliant psychological thriller Jin-Roh: Okiura's obsessively restrained animation and Oshii's unsettling writing combined in a really very fine thriller."

Animesuggest,3dt8k1,HughSurname,3,Sun Jul 19 06:29:38 2015 UTC,"it really depends. personally, i have a handful of genres that I love, a bunch that I like, and one or two that i just don't like.  Whatever it is you're into, there's a lot of good anime out there. I have a wide enough range of  interest (and a strong enough tolerance for weird shit) to keep me occupied for the next couple of years (Its been about 8 months and Ive seen around 100 shows, at an average of 24 episodes per show) I still havent seen a lot of the ""starter anime"" like Baccano and Durarara, or Evangelion, any of the Gundam series, along with a laundry list of classics, new popular anime (SAO never) and there's probably a backlog of thousands upon thousands of good, forgotten series (stuff like Plastic Memories thatre short and standalone, and ones thatre good but dont sell well)  Also, stuff that came out before '04, roughly the start of a large improvement in art quality, is hard to recommend, since a good amount of threads here are by people who dislike old anime style (in their defense, I couldn't fap to this, now could I?)  Alright, I'll list some shit by genre that I think's good.   Samurai stuff: Samurai Champloo - great for beginners, well balanced and full of ""fuck you"" attitude. Incerdible dub. Rurouni Kenshin - the series is a classic and the 2 hour prequel OVA series is the greatest historical swordsman movie of all time, of its own merit. Prequel sub, series dub. Katanagatari - incredible fight scenes, well fleshed-out dialogue, nice historical feel with seamless sci-fi elements. incredible plot, the progression rises and peaks at the end. Gintama - I'll be mentioning this one in the comedy section, but for now, if you want aliens in your historical Edo-period samurai show, here's 300 episodes that you just have to see!! Akatsuki no Yona - unless I see a season 2 announcement, i can't in all good conscious push this on you, unless you read manga.  Action (without heavy Japanese cultural influence) -all have good dubs or are being dubbed atm: Both Berserk and Claymore are well-respected, incredible, riveting, utterly engaging hack & slash gut-fests that seem to be exclusively hated by people who read the manga. Full Metal Alchemist (anime original) and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (remake, faithful to the manga) are incredible, and manage to shove in as many genres and themes as Code Geass, if not more. There is huge debate over which ending is better, so I can't recommend one or the other, but the original is more mystery-driven, and the remake has comedy and is oh-so-faithful to the source material. Parasyte is hard to describe, other than ""flesh eating monsters are gonna decapitate everyone you love"" but as a guy who doesn't care much for horror shows, this anime managed to claim the #1 spot on my personal favorite list. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012) needs no introduction. It may overtake Parasyte, I've still got 2 seasons to finish, tho.. Angel Beats! is a thing of beauty, and is irreplaceable. I almost dropped it after episode 3, but thankfully I gave it another chance.  Mystery/Thriller (all dubs): Madoka Magica is one you should go into without expectations. It's good to have some sort of background in the magical girl sub-genre, though. Steins;Gate is incredible, and is another that you should go in blind for. Eden of the East is somewhat similar to the last two, being set in an urban environment, and... fuck I've been at this for like 15 minutes nd I've done 2 1/2 genres.... I'm listing them from here on out  Romance   Toradora -dub- comedy, drama Golden Time -  comedy, drama, seinen (targets males 18+) Clannad -dub- drama, tragedy, some comedy, slice of life/cute You Lie in April -being dubbed atm- music, tragedy, drama ef: A Tale of Memories - seinen, a thing of beauty, just watch m8 Spice & Wolf -dub- very unique. unfinished adaption, but 100% worth it Seto no Hanayome -dub- my favorite comedy. yakuza mermaids bruh Ore no Imouto - wincest. lol comedy, borderline harem, seinen Kokoro Connect - not telling you anything. except that its got a great dub.   Not for the feint of heart   Welcome to the NHK! -dub- youll know after episode 1 whether or not youll be able to connect wit hthe protagonist Denpa Teki na Kanojo - Q. Tarintino fans, look no further   Anime that will lengthen your lifespan   Kiniro Mosaic - 5,000 hugs K-ON! - 4,500 hugs Non Non Biyori - 4,500 hugs Ichigo Mashimaro - 4,000 hugs and 1,000 keks Usagi Drop - 1,000 - 10,000 hugs depending on how you take it. I'm in the upper percentile, but I can see how it's not for everyone   Comedy (various)   No Game No Life - as a not-hardcore yet not-casual gamer, this anime drove me to tears, not out of sadness, or out of joy, but pure anarchic desire getting me worked up to the point that I wanted to scream Nichijou - sketch-com extraordinaire Gintama - hooollyy shit. It starts funny, drops a permanent lel-bomb on itself 25 episodes in, and from that point gets steadily funnier and more outrageous as it goes along Seto no Hanayome, as stated is also a romcom B Gata H Kei -dub- sex joke (situational) and Seitokai Yakinidomo, the less romantic alternative Ghost Stories - dub only (Crispin Freemen, not the new dub)   dammit.... I'm going back to watching anime. peace"

I also liked the format, with each girl getting their own arc where the MC has to figure out their parameters and how to conquer them. After several such arcs, the show takes a turn and ties all the conquests together into a bigger overarching plot which explains what is going on. Finally at the very end of the story, MC makes a choice of one of the heroines, which is super rare."

Nunally had Charles' geass used on her. He alters memories. She was made to believe that she saw the incident that made her blind and paralyzed when in fact she is not.

Nana and Planetes are also great for complex characters, although their casts aren't nearly as big as LotGH (then again, the vast majority of series can't touch LotGH in terms of cast size and complexity).  Adding:   Hunter x Hunter - Huge cast? Check. Complex characters? For a shounen, at least, I'd say yes. Gon, the MC, comes closest to having an archetypal personality, but the series at least doesn't have him winning battles with the power of friendship or some BS like that. Most of the other characters have their complexities, particularly the antagonists of the York New Arc and the Chimera Ant Arc. Twelve Kingdoms - Has 4 story arcs, which each focus on a different set of characters, although Youko is the MC in two of them. This, however, allows a variety of different stories and perspectives to be explored. Youko, in particular, goes through a tremendous amount of character development. This series also has some amazing world building. Fate/Zero - Has quite a large cast of characters, some of whom get more focus than others, but for the most part, the series does take the time to explore and/or develop many of them. Haikyuu! - Yes, a sports anime. However, I really enjoyed how this series didn't focus too much on the two main characters, but rather, took the time to explore other characters, including some from the other teams - their dreams, their strategies, their weaknesses, and their inner demons.

Not much world building since it's in modern-day Kyoto, but the fantasy aspect does give it a different sort of perspective. Trailer. Aria - I know you said you're not a huge fan of cute girls, but Aria fit all the rest of your criteria. Excellent world building, light-hearted (in fact, it's known as a great healing anime), and is complete (3 seasons + an OVA; a special is due to be released this autumn).

Animesuggest,3dqerp,StoiaN40,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:07:32 2015 UTC,"If you're enjoying Gangsta., it's definitely worth checking out  Black Lagoon   Trailer: Dubbed trailer What it's about: Rokuro ""Rock"" Okajima was your average Japanese salaryman, buttoned down and sucking up. Until an assignment to the South China Sea sees his boat hijacked by the mercenary Lagoon Company, and he's taken hostage. Maybe it's just Stockholm Syndrome, but there's something unmistakably alluring about the freedom of the lives of his captors, and it's not long before he throws in his lot with the pirates. Why you should watch it: It's a straight-up, balls-to-the-wall action series. It's absolutely unapologetic about its grittiness, violence, and obscene language. At the same time, the characters are fascinating and the story lends itself well to the self-contained arc format that makes up the majority of the run. Black Lagoon is also famous for having a particularly accomplished English dub. Even if you generally prefer subtitles, I’d urge you to give this one a try in English. The voice actors knock it out of the park, and it honestly seems more authentic to listen to the American accents than the originals. Caveats: Not many, really. If you're easily offended by swearing, avoid the show like the plague. Other than that, it’s really quite solid. Bear in mind that it's more of a collection of loosely-connected adventure arcs, rather than one large coherent storyline. Themes: Making decisions and living with the consequences. In particular, it disparages those who would sit on the fence without committing to one course of action through sheer indecision. Similar works: Gangsta.,  Gunsmith Cats, Cowboy Bebop and Jormungand. Outside of anime, Firefly."

The points that match is that magic is in this world, but it works as a system. Rules, capabilities of each person, and individual magic are there. Though this takes place in the future, and is in a modern society. So it might not fit the sorcery part completely.  There is lots of talk about fights and events. You can have sometihng happen and the characters will use just as much time discussing it. The same applies to politic motives which are there too. If you are not liking that, you may find that you don't like this one.

Animesuggest,3dnqan,savepoints,2,Fri Jul 17 20:26:03 2015 UTC,"I mean, seems like you and me don't have similar tastes at all, so I'm not going to mention any specific shows. Instead, what I tend to do to keep my list ""trimmed"" (I currently have 387 PTW, but was sitting at around 450 earlier this year), is I tend to generally not keep shows that go under 7 in score (I know, there are some shows under 7 that you may still think are good, but it's just a general rule).  I've also come to notice that I very rarely tend to stick to pure SOL-shows, so I went through and just deleted a lot of shows that were just that (going by what I knew about them or just tags).  So there you have some general points of advice, I guess. But honestly, as some others have pointed out, 60 are not a lot at all, especially since the majority of those are actually really good shows in general, so you'd probably miss out on a lot of stuff just for the sake of keeping your list short."

Animesuggest,3dotvn,NateDx,2,Sat Jul 18 01:01:42 2015 UTC,"So you definitely want something short, probably 11-13 episodes.  Would help narrow things down if you gave some sort of list but...  Baccano! is a high-action drama set in the Roaring Twenties of NYC, with a colorful cast and shenanigans all the way down.  Lots of blood though.  FLCL is a 6-episode OVA that remains a masterpiece of coming-of-age stories, though it's not going to make a ton of sense if you're not paying much attention.  Good series to watch at random though, especially because of how short it is.  The World Is Still Beautiful is a short, sweet, well-made romance/shoujo with an excellent female lead and an interesting male counterpart.  Not terribly long and plot moves along quite well.  Fantasy setting, rather entertaining.  On a similar note to Baccano!, if you're looking for action there's always the classic Black Lagoon, which clocks in well and has its own fair share of absolute craziness.  It's more understandable but less narratively interesting than Baccano!, which is fine because it focuses heavily on people being badass.  Also has a very good dub, by the way.  If that doesn't quite strike your fancy there are also plenty of good short comedies, like Nichibros (The Daily Lives of High Shool Boys) and the also-solid Working!!, the story of the rather strange staff working at the Wagnaria Cafe.  Amagi Brilliant Park is also a cute comedy that's easy to marathon, centering around an overly-punny team of people attempting to save an amusement park from closing down due to lack of traffic.  Great pacing and the humor is on point."

Animesuggest,3dotvn,chevybow,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:46:45 2015 UTC,Here's my list of short(ish) anime's that you can finish in 8 hours or less that I really enjoyed:    Anohana. An anime where a ghost of a dead girl comes back to one of her childhood friends. Takes a look at a group of (past) friends as they work to finally move on from the depressing past. 11 Episodes.   One-Week-Friends. A girl loses all her happy memories each week- thus she finds it hard to make friends. A boy named Hase finds her cute and decides to befriend her regardless of the fact that its well-known she has no friends. 12 episodes.    I binged watched both of those series. Anohana is romance/drama and one-week-friends is slice of life/comedy/school.   If you're maybe looking to watch some animated movies instead of series here are some I would suggest:    Colorful. A dead spirit has committed a grave sin. However it gets a second chance at life. It gets put into the body of a young boy who committed suicide. He must come to terms with what sin he committed in his prior life as he takes on an emotional journey to try and figure out more about itself. Drama/Supernatural/Slice of Life.  Summer Wars. A bit Studio-Ghibili like but this movie was pure enjoyment rather than depending on complex plot or characters. A boy receives a text message of a math puzzle on his phone. Due to his love of math he solves it- only to realize that he gave a hacker the code needed to hack into what is essentially the internet. He must now try to stop the hacker before it's too late. SciFi/Comedy.

Mahou Shoujotai Alice has magic in it which, from my vague memory, is not entirely unlike that in LWA, with the use of minor sprites/spirits.  Ojamajo Doremi borrows some of the witch idea and involves magical education and a clumsy lead, and is even quite good, but it is pitched very young indeed, and you might find it too childish, I don't know.  Mahou Tsukai Tai! and its sequel TV series are a kind of adventure/comedy thing, a bit fanservice-y at points, about a group of magicians who function as a club at an otherwise normal school.  There are of course piles of magical girl anime beyond that, but they tend not to major on education or the school environment, and they tend to eschew the witch thing. After thinking about it, I wonder whether LWA is perhaps more distinctive (within anime) that I had given it credit for.

Kill la Kill is a really over the top anime. Don't get me wrong after watching it I consider it one of my all time favorites, but if your even fairly new to anime like I was when I started it the first time, you will likely consider it a too over the top. So I would recommend watching it after you have put a few other more daring anime to help bridge the gap. It's an awesome ride though when you do finally get into it!  Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is tied for first place as my all time favorite anime, and the original is in my top 15 or so. I would highly recommend you start with Brotherhood if you want to watch an anime that is widely considered as the best all time. The original version is also extremely good I might add, and both I think you would like both because of the differences in how the cover the manga up to the point where the first series goes down its 'original' ending route. Also I might add that both have some of the best music I have ever heard in an anime, they really fit the tone of the show perfectly.  Cowboy Bebop needs no introduction from anyone other than the name and the fact that you should watch it asap. Even with its age, its nothing short of extraordinary. It will amaze you. The opening song up to the end of every episode is great and I highly recommend that you also put a priority to watch this sooner rather than later."

However, it does make references to things in Heaven's Feel, as well as some references to Hollow Ataraxia (the sequel to F/SN), so having seen/read/played the entire F/SN series would be the best.   But honestly, even if you don't understand all of the jokes, I still highly recommend watching this, if you're into Fate/ or Nasuverse in general.

As for the Fate ending disregarding Archer, I think it's more of case that Archer didn't have his memories and therefore didn't really do much for his plan of killing Shirou.

Word of God is that Archer isn't from any of the canonical routes, and that the events of each of them make it unlikely (though not impossible) that he'll tread the same path. Mind of Steel would definitely not end in an Archer though. Archer hated the Guardianship as it betrayed his core ideals - he was only brought into a conflict too late to save anyone, and was only there to kill whoever survived to keep the peace.

Animesuggest,3dli7n,HecticNickzors,7,Fri Jul 17 06:15:41 2015 UTC,"Daily Lives of Highschool Boys   Trailer: DVD Trailer What it’s about: Tadakuni, Yoshitake, and Hidenori are three utterly ordinary high school students. There’s no secret plot to take over Japan, no sports trophy to be won or grand romance to play out. There’s just the everyday world of teenagers in an all-boys academy; arguments, fantasies, awkward encounters and amusing yourself and your friends while hanging out. Why you should watch it: It’s one of the most accurate renditions of male adolescence that I can think of. All of the social awkwardness, jokes that only make sense to you and your friends, and all-around low-stakes activities that nonetheless have all the characters invested in their outcomes. The show is hilarious, and the short sketch format (each episode being broken into three or so individual segments) lends itself well to the setting. The cast steadily expands to keep things interesting, to the point where several of the original characters more or less fade into the background by the end. The Japanese voice actors play their parts perfectly, every single one. The “Literary Girl” skits are some of the funniest stuff I’ve seen in anime for a long while. Caveats: As with any comedy, there are going to be a few jokes you find unfunny, and when that happens you’re stuck with it while it plays out for the next ten minutes. It’s an almost exclusively male cast, so don’t go into it expecting your standard boobs-and-cute girls high school anime. Themes: Adolescence. Friendship and social awkwardness. Similar works: Nichijou, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun"

But it's really one of the best shows I've ever seen, I'd put it in my top 10. The romance is sort of subtle but I think it's a bit more realistic. Trust me this one is gold. Golden Time - this is in my top 3 romances. The plot is great and the romance is a bit more mature (it takes place in university rather than high school). It's just super good, if you like romance then this is essential. Nagi no Asukara - This is a really dramatic one with the biggest love polygon I've ever seen, but it's so good. It starts a little slow but I guarantee when you hit the halfway point you'll be hooked. Nisekoi - this harem/rom-com is one of my favorite shows out there. Admittedly it's not really a show to get into if you want some real romantic development, but if you like funny and cute romantic situations and adorable characters, then 100% get into this, it's got such a nice style. 5 centimeters per second - this is a 50-minute drama/romance movie that is one of the realest things I've ever watched. It's got one of the best melancholic feels I know, it's so good. If you like bummer stuff and you like romance, this is a must-watch."

Its often serialized in Magazines where the artist is paid to release the story in a chapter by chapter format for each issue of the magazine. Every once in a while, the chapters from each issue is compiled into a single volume of multiple chapters, which we western audiences are more familiar with. A lot of manga gets adapted ibto anime if it popoular enough. One Piece is a Manga  A novel is a book, words on paper, printed all at once as a complete story. Harry Potter is a Novel  A light Novel is self explanatory. Usually no more than a hundred or so pages, with a target demographic of teens who arent into heavy reading.

Generally speaking light novels have less complex prose than novels and fewer characters per page. This doesn't mean that a LN series as a whole will always be a quick read: the Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere LN series is famously massive.

It's pretty hard to know what you mean by 'the classics', as there are a few ways to look at it. Do you have a MAL, or anything like that? For now, I guess I can refer you to some anime that have good dubs, IMO. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is one of the only anime I will not watch subbed. You say they enjoyed Cowboy Bebop, so they might like Samurai Champloo. It's also a great dub. I'm just now getting into Monster, but the dub seems great so far, and it has a long, overarching story, which seems really promising to me."
Animesuggest,3dluch,gusti123,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:02:11 2015 UTC,"(Anything I mention in the first two paragraphs should be available dubbed unless I say otherwise.)  Since your mum liked Michiko to Hatchin, perhaps Guardian of the Sacred Spirit would go down well with her, and possibly other members of the family? Dennou Coil comes to mind as another reasonably exciting and action-packed but still firmly family/parent-appropriate show, but that has no dub. I've seen Princess Jellyfish go down well with a mixed audience. Since your sister enjoyed Fruits Basket, she might like OHSHC, if she hasn't seen it already -- maybe she wouldn't be the only one, I've again seen mixed groups enjoy the show. I can't think of many things which can match Attack on Titan's initial hook, whatever I might think about its later execution. I suppose Death Note seems to have a similar effect? And that is at least relatively long.  If your parents enjoyed Cowboy Bebop, have they seen the film? That might be an option if they haven't. I'd have thought that any Mamoru Hosoda film would be accessible to non-fan viewers and also reasonably engaging and exciting. Ditto Time of Eve. Satoshi Kon's films too, if they're up for darker and more psychological stuff. Macross Plus is fairly accessible, would kill two hours forty minutes, and has (as I was telling someone only yesterday) an excellent dub featuring Bryan Cranston as the lead.  It's always hard to know what someone means when they say they've seen the classics, so for you yourself I will just throw out some ideas. Most of these aren't dubbed because they're a bit more off-piste. One Outs and Kaiji? Kamichu (which is dubbed)? Mononoke? Mazinkaiser SKL (which would be a good way to blow off some steam)? Eccentric Family? Build Fighters (no, really)? Nasu and its sequel? Azazel-san (this one's very crude and offensive, but very funny -- it's like Detroit Metal City)? Yamato 2199? Mai-Hime? Stellvia?

So for example there is an arc that introduces several characters and has a set up for something, however after the arc ends the setup becomes irrelevant and the characters never show up again.  So essentially whoever did the storyboarding basically kept the wrong scenes, which leads to major confusion on the part of the viewer (if they havent read the manga).  That said, as a reader i actually enjoyed root A because its just awesome to get to see scenes you've read animated, and luckily the studio didnt mess up any of the scenes it chose to animate.  If i had to break it down I'd say the first 3-4 eps were pretty good, 5-9 were terrible, 10-11 were good, and 12 was god awful."

There is a minor plot arc involving Aoi's acrophobia, but it doesn't take much mental concentration to get through it. There's also a second season, with 24 12-minute-long episodes, where the girls expand their adventures a bit more. That one does touch a serious issue, namely the dangers of altitude sickness, but it is again easily resolved and lightly handled.  Joining in the throng to recommend Aria.

Animesuggest,3dj92o,Jitsuo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:27:45 2015 UTC,"Daily Lives of Highschool Boys   Trailer: DVD Trailer What it’s about: Tadakuni, Yoshitake, and Hidenori are three utterly ordinary high school students. There’s no secret plot to take over Japan, no sports trophy to be won or grand romance to play out. There’s just the everyday world of teenagers in an all-boys academy; arguments, fantasies, awkward encounters and amusing yourself and your friends while hanging out. Why you should watch it: It’s one of the most accurate renditions of male adolescence that I can think of. All of the social awkwardness, jokes that only make sense to you and your friends, and all-around low-stakes activities that nonetheless have all the characters invested in their outcomes. The show is hilarious, and the short sketch format (each episode being broken into three or so individual segments) lends itself well to the setting. The cast steadily expands to keep things interesting, to the point where several of the original characters more or less fade into the background by the end. The Japanese voice actors play their parts perfectly, every single one. The “Literary Girl” skits are some of the funniest stuff I’ve seen in anime for a long while. Caveats: As with any comedy, there are going to be a few jokes you find unfunny, and when that happens you’re stuck with it while it plays out for the next ten minutes. It’s an almost exclusively male cast, so don’t go into it expecting your standard boobs-and-cute girls high school anime. Themes: Adolescence. Friendship and social awkwardness. Similar works: Nichijou, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun     Bartender   Trailer: Opening animation What it’s about: Despite his youth, Ryuu Sasakura has gained a reputation as a master bartender among his peers and patrons alike. People seek out his bar in the hopes of receiving the perfect cocktail - a ""Glass of the Gods"" that not only suits their desires but guides them on the next step of their journey.  Why you should watch it: It's a laid-back, meditative slice-of-life show. There's nothing all that flashy about it, but every episode introduces new patrons with new problems and new stories to tell. There's nothing outlandish or unbelievable about the stories (aside from Ryuu's Sherlockian ability to read the minutia of behaviour), but they're all interesting and well put-together. The show is unabashedly Western-focused, with cocktails, stories and trivia drawn from the UK and the U.S., and literary references ranging from Thoreau and Hemingway to Rabelais and Descartes. The show does a good job of introducing and settling each story in its own episode and, as a bonus, each episode ends with a recipe for the featured cocktails, if you want to try them yourself. Bartender isn't in the running for ""greatest show of all time"", but it's a unique experience and well worth checking out if you want a bit of a breather from heavier or more action-packed series. Caveats: With no overarching plot, it's a show that's best watched an episode at a time. Just sit back with a drink in hand, because you'll definitely want one by the end of each show. Themes: Well, on the surface, the show's message might be read as ""alcohol is the solution to every problem"" but, really, it's more about how the great stresses and tortured dilemmas that we all face really aren't that bad - that all one needs is some distance and time to reflect, and the courage to see what needs to be done. And, of course, a receptive ear as we moan about our lot. Similar works: The Time of Eve, A Piece of Phantasmagoria.     A Piece of Phantasmagoria   Trailer: None that I can find. The episodes are only three minutes each, though, so a trailer seems a bit redundant. What it’s about: The world of Phantasmagoria exists only in dreams, populated by a bizarre set of groups and individuals. Each episode provides a small glimpse into a different section of the world, steadily assembling a picture of a strange world of interconnected and bizarre locations. From a town made of bread to a sea of glass, from a factory converting rainbows into paint to the movie projector that overlays the stars into the night sky, the inhabitants of Phantasmagoria interact in unusual and unpredictable ways with the place they call home. Why you should watch it: It’s a sedate, dreamlike series of shorts. Bedtime stories, really. The calm narration, the surreal but peaceful people and events, even the simplistic visuals and sound design all seem to come together to present something truly unique. This is a pretty classic take on animation. It’s imaginative, it’s weird, and it’s wonderful. It’s not really a show to binge through, though. Just take an episode or two at a time before bed or when you feel the need to calm down a bit. Caveats: The show has very, very crude animation even for its time, and it looks even worse in comparison to the slick presentation of the average show today. It’s also quite hard to find a legal subtitled copy of the series, though there are always certain places on the web that will have it available. Similar works: Bartender has a very similar feel to this show. As does Mushishi, to a lesser extent. Outside of anime, take a look at Salvador Dali’s Destino."

Animesuggest,3diodh,Jaspaaar,11,Thu Jul 16 17:12:57 2015 UTC,"Well, a lot of people are only into anime for a year or two, and that's fine. It's more than fine, it's great that so many people find entertainment for a while in it. So one possible thing that happens to people is that they lose interest and go off and do other things.   Or, they remain interested but consume at a lower rate, which I often think is a positive development: watching the handful of things a year which are really your kind of thing can be a healthy engagement, while trying to watch tonnes of things can burn people out.  It depends to some extent on how broad your taste is, but if it's reasonably broad there really is quite a lot of older material to go back to. I've been watching anime for close to a decade now and I'm still working my way through older titles that I'm interested in. Indeed, my plan-to-watch list is still growing. There's just loads of material which doesn't get mentioned very often. And every year brings new titles which I must get round to trying at some point.  And, as /u/milnivek says, manga is worth investigating. Particularly for certain kinds of thing: manga-readers tell me that there's quite a lot of interesting seinen and josei manga which can be found in English translation, but stands no hope of ever receiving an anime adaptation."
Animesuggest,3diodh,soracte,2,Thu Jul 16 16:26:47 2015 UTC,"I'm currently somewhere between ""super into it"" and ""consuming at a lower rate"".

Animesuggest,3diodh,soracte,4,Fri Jul 17 07:58:13 2015 UTC,"Between my Watching, Completed, and On-Hold lists, I have 276 entries - meaning, I've at least partially watched that many anime. Trust me, there is always something to watch - maybe something new, maybe something that I missed a few years ago, or maybe an older series from before I started watching anime. Anime has such an extensive history that I don't think it's even possible to watch all the ""good stuff"" - and what people count as ""good"" will vary from person to person, anyway.  I think the trick is to try not to burn yourself out. Don't watch anime for the sake of filling out your MAL and claiming you've watched X amount of anime. Watch anime because you want to. It's not a race or competition. Watch anime when you feel like it, not because you feel like you have to. When you feel like watching anime is a chore, you've burned yourself out. Go do something else for a while, and return to it when you feel like it."
Animesuggest,3diodh,duckface08,3,Thu Jul 16 18:23:53 2015 UTC,I've been watching anime for over a decade.  It's not really uncommon for me to loose interest for a couple months or so.  Usually I'll get back into it because there's a really good line up of new shows currently airing or about to air.  What helps is that I've got no qualms about watching old shows.  I'll go back and discover old gems from the 80's and 90's and that helps keep my interest going.  I get sick of watching anime that feels like the same stuff I've seen over and over again.  So for me there's much less in the way of new shows that I find appealing as compared to someone who is fresh to anime.  Even so there are usually a few new shows most seasons that I like.  I love to be surprised by a new show.  For instance with Shingeki No Bahumut I went into the first episode with very low expectations and was expecting to drop it at the end of the first episode.  That series ended up being on of my favorite that season.  Looking for new gems like that keeps me coming back and paying attention to whats coming out.
Animesuggest,3diodh,speedyturtle4,3,Thu Jul 16 18:11:45 2015 UTC,"260+ anime now, decent, think I'm probably hitting the ""above average"" range, maybe not a veteran though.  My PTW is the largest it's ever been, I just don't think you ever really get to the point where you totally run out, I mean i've seen MALs 800+ with 100+ titles in the PTW. There's just too much stuff to be able to keep up.  For example: For the last two seasons I've been watching things that interest me as they air, plus I've watched a few other series, so in theory I should be closing the gap. However, I still haven't watched some titles things are sequels too, this season i'm behind on gatchaman, last season it was durrarara and JoJo. So even though I'm watching things as they come out AND watching other shows. More shows are being added to the backlog.  We're pretty much at the point where if we're coming into anime now it'll be near impossible to catch up on every ""above average"" show, there's just too much."

I have always thought about going to read manga/LN's but a majority of them arnt finished and i dont like reading ongoing things because i never remember to stay up to date. For some reason, i dont enjoy manga as much as i do anime even tho i love reading and anime.

I assume that you end up watching mediocre anime just because there is an extent of which re-watching will entertain you.   I don't agree with your assumption. There's a lot of series out there... anime as a medium is over 40 years old. Popularity isn't necessarily indicative of quality or the enjoyment you get out of it, especially when you factor in how many shows are seemingly forgotten to a modern audience.  My list is 343 completed shows, 34 watching (which includes both airing shows as well as things watched slowly in chunks) and about 350 on my planned to watch list. Excluding airing shows, I've been focusing on watching shows within the genre that got me into anime (mecha) over the last two years.

I read a lot of novels, and play computer games, cycle, gym, jog, cook, garden, have a partner, a stamp collection that hasn't been tended to in years, probably should start looking at starting  my thesis soon and a few other past times so I can always spend more time invested in one of them if anime is not the go."

I don't think it is possible to keep going with so many all the time, eventually you can't watch boring cliche crap which is most of anime, and you have to try really hard to find something that holds your interest.

Watching currently airing shows has its pros to binge watching completed shows, and I actually prefer the former.   If that isn't enough to satiate your anime craving there are a two other options I can think of. The first is to move into anime source material (manga's, LN, and VN).  Each have a far larger amount of material and by sheer numbers you should always be able to find something to keep you entertained. The second is to branch into other anime related hobbies. That is cosplay and/or collecting.   Personally I'm fine just watching airing shows, and even after a decade I can still find some old gems to binge if I really want to."
Animesuggest,3diodh,Navvana,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:38:42 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think there is always something you can find to fill up your time. You just have to be in the mood for that particular show.  There are times when you're going to feel like you have nothing to watch, and you'll go a day or two, watch and episode of a few new anime, and not get into it. Just keep browsing. Find something you enjoyed and watch a few episodes of it again, then look for other anime that are similar to it.  I personally browse MAL and this sub, looking for shows similar to one I enjoyed a lot. Eventually I'll stumble across something I've never heard of, or saw mentioned and never picked up, and I'll give it a try. Some of the best shows I've seen were discovered this way.  Sometimes you just have to battle through and find something that tickles your fancy for the current mood you're in.  Here's a couple you might like based on MAL.  White Album 2: You threw a 10 at Your Lie in April, so I think WA2 will be right up your alley. Romance and Music focused, with some very bittersweet scenes and emotional pull. I personally enjoyed it a ton, and recommend it to anyone that like romance, and doesn't mind some sad parts.  Overlord: You rated NGNL, SAO, and Log Horizon highly. Overlord is currently airing, and is about a Guild Leader who is pulled from his favorite MMO that is closing down into a fantasy world where he becomes his character. All of his NPC followers go as well, and become more than NPCs. It looks to be a really great anime.  Code Geass: I'm sure you've heard this one before, but I didn't notice it on the list. Always a solid watch, if only for the MC. Considered one of the best anime of the last two decades.  Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari: I always end up recommending this just because I enjoyed it so much. Similar to NGNL in that a person is pulled to another world, where he is incredibly powerful. Mecha show, harem, comedy, spinoff of the old Tenchi Muyo. OVA format, 1 hour episodes, but rather entertaining."

Animesuggest,3dlvaw,LeafErickson,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:09:27 2015 UTC,"In addition to Angel Beats, which was already suggested, I think you'd like  Death Note: It isn't traditional action and is more mind games, and the romance does take a bit to come into play but its there, Light does love to use his love interests in his plans.  Higurashi: Very similar to Mirai Nikki in that anyone can snap and go crazy at any moment. Romance is once again involved but takes more of a back seat to the action.  Stein's Gate: More of a time-travel epic than traditional action, but it is a thriller and has heavy romance, especially near the end of the show (the romance takes a while to develop, but is the strongest of any in these suggestions other than Angel Beats IMO).  Parasyte: The most straight-up action of any show on this list, I would reccomend it to anybody. It aired recently and was very popular, romance is definitely included  I am not sure if you would ever give Mecha shows a try. If you are feeling it, Eureka Seven is pretty famous for its romance"

A couple of scuffles in the early episodes but nothing amazing, it's mostly low level violence.  However I realized that the story is actually the main focus of this anime and after I kept seeing good character after good character come into the plot it just kept getting better because I LIKED these people.  The sense that these people are doing exactly what they were going to do in order to achieve their goals.  Gungrave is an excellent anime that has a nice visual, a very well drawn out story between two former street gang leaders who rise the ranks through the mafia called The Organization.   Don't see a whole lot of other people even mention it because it's older but I was damn shocked to not find a typical action anime, they explain  EVERY SINGLE THING TO YOU.  The steps they take along nearly all of their rise to power, the betrayals in the mob, how well the businesses are being run, how these two are making more than just a name for themselves but actually getting high  enough in the organization to control it.  Then WHILE this has been going on another plot is also building that eventually collides with are two street punks who are now high level mafioso.  Seriously just give the first few episodes a try if the action from the first episode, which actually takes place around episode 17 or 18, isn't your taste and the atmosphere of the very history rich city doesn't grab you might want to stop watching.   I liked it so much I apparently mentioned it enough that my girlfriend secretly bought it for me and gave it to me for christmas."

Animesuggest,3dhlw8,GeeJo,8,Thu Jul 16 20:23:27 2015 UTC,"Higurashi   Trailer: No good ones, sadly. It’s a difficult show to make one for, I suppose What it's about: On the surface, Hinamizawa is a peaceful idyllic town. Keiichi Maebara certainly agrees, after settling into a new life at school surrounded by young girls. But nothing is as it seems; dark secrets and a string of murders are just the beginning, and it isn't long before Keiichi is at the centre of a widening gyre of horror, gore, torture and murderous insanity.  Why watch it: Horror is a difficult genre for animated shows to pull off. The abstraction makes it difficult for the audience to empathise and get into the right state of tension. Higurashi is one of the rare successes, capitalising on a sense of foreboding in the early sections, and then upon its odd format later. The show is broken into a series of arcs, each covering the same time period but from a different perspective. With each ""reset"", you know exactly how bad things are going to get, but you don't know how it'll get there. Caveats: Do not let yourself be fooled by the first episode. While even the opening episode does drop some hints about what's to come, it's still a pretty cutesy-poo way to start for someone expecting a horror. It's setting the stage, be patient. Themes: Sin and atonement. Similar works: Shiki     If you're willing to try something a little different,  Song of Saya (Visual Novel)   Trailer: Fan-dub trailer What it’s about: The fact that he survived the accident was a miracle. To expect him to come out unscathed was too much to ask. Fuminori Sakisaka awakens from the car crash that killed his parents with a bizarre form of agnosia that distorts his perceptions of the world around him into a Lovecraftian hellscape. His friends are writhing fleshy monsters, his food a disgusting mess of gore and filth. Determined to hide his condition for fear of being condemned to an asylum, he contemplates suicide - until a young girl, angelic in contrast to the putrid meat-corridors of the hospital, appears by his bed and introduces herself as Saya. Why you should try it: If you've never tried a Visual Novel before, this is a great place to start. Written by the acclaimed Gen Urobuchi, the story takes about the same time to complete as a one-cour anime, and is unusually linear - prompting you for only one real decision on how you believe the story deserves to end. Saya no Uta is a story of horror and devotion, of love and monsters both human and otherwise. For all that ""tentacle monsters"" are a big part of the Western perception of Japanese media, there is a surprising lack of true Lovecraftian horror. Saya no Uta takes up that slack, and weaves into it threads of isolation, sinister desperation and a romance that is both beautiful and horrifying. Finally, the soundtrack is fantastic – I don’t think Shoes of Glass is ever going to come off of my playlist. Caveats: If you are the type of person who requires trigger warnings on the media you consume, steer well clear. Saya no Uta contains murder, rape, cannibalism, slavery, sadism and body horror. It also features H-scenes (porn) with an under-age girl. If you're not squeamish, or if you're a fan of Gen Urobuchi's other works (Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero, Phantom: Requiem), you really should give this a try, though. Themes: The philosophy of aesthetics, and how our senses define us, from our morality - why is it alright to poison cockroaches but not puppies?  - all the way to our sense of identity. The question of which option is the true end of the story is left up to the audience, and it's a tough one to solve. Similar works: Within anime, I'm going to have to say Pupa, but it's a terrible show and you shouldn't watch it. Outside, try the works of H.P. Lovecraft."

B Gata H Kei - Lots of humor, it has a female MC but the guy is pretty much a ""realistic straight man"" type who is a bit shy considering the girl is out his league. The romance is also surprisingly good despite the premise sounding quite vulgar. The dub is really good, especially for the MC.  Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu - Only seen the first season, but it's enjoyable and has plenty of comedic and lighthearted moments. Girl loves anime and other otaku-related things, guy finds out and keeps her secret. From what I've seen the romance develops quite nicely, and you completely buy into them liking each other."

Also I can't say I enjoyed the story up to where I watched it - not really a big fan of mystery/ghost stories/etc. Sure there might be romance (iirc), which is one of my favourite genres, but for some reason I couldn't get into it. Plus, I couldn't really understand much due to dialogues being kind of hard to understand for me (english isn't my first language), even though I usually don't have this problem with other shows. I don't really understand why this show always gets so much praise, but I guess everyone has their tastes. As for madoka, I think I'll watch it some other time.

Also its probably the most gorgeously animated show I've seen, PA works really nails it K-On!: if you like cute girls being cute and good anime music, the first season is just that.  If you like good slice of life elements surrounding graduation and friendship, with lots of humor, K-on!! second season is jut that.

About the latter, I worded my previous sentence incorrectly: what I was trying to say is not that the complessive length of the show is what makes me hesitate, but the fact that each episode is 50 minutes long. I'm sure the show is really good beacuse I haven't heard any bad comments about it, even though it's not really discussed frequently (as far as I can tell).

I can think of some anime that have Violent MC+Romance Subplot, but most of them have college level people. And most of the shows are more action focused over Romance focused.  Things like Elfen Lied and Kara no Kyoukai are the 2 closest i can think of. But even these arnt great fits. Maybe Mirai Nikki)? Id say Mirai nikki and Kara No kyoukai are the 2 closest to ""violent MC+dark backstory+romance"" that i can think of.  Something like Darker than Black- Murderer MC Very small sub-romance isnt right. Not enough romance.  Gungrave- One sided love, romance isnt a main aspect, Violent MC but not in highschool.  Phantom: Requiem for a Phantom- Dont remember this show well, but i know it fits the violent MC+dark Past. Think it also has romance but its not a main theme.  Hope someone else has better recommendations."

It seems most anime with Violent backstory MC also focuses heavily on action/thriller and less on the romance side of things. I just gave you the shows with a bit of all in them. I would start with mirai Nikki cause it prob fits what you are looking for the closest. Some people love the show, i thought it was ok. But there is 1 episode that takes place after the ""final episode"" so make sure you watch it. I personally think Kara no Kyoukai is a FANTASTIC show and it has a decent amount of romance/violence."

A lot of the people who worked on A Lull in the Sea also worked on Hansaku Iroha, including the writer, Mari Okada, who did the script and series composition. I love her writing style. I've never seen characters feel as real as the ones in her anime. I had that same moment after watching it where I wondered why most slices of life weren't as good as it. Nagi No Asukara is the only anime to maybe top it in that category. I think I might like the characters in Hanasaku Iroha more.  Also, I haven't watched it yet, but Mari Okada also worked on Toradora, and this excellent comment by /u/Anime-Summit makes it sound very similar to Hanasaku Iroha and by that extension Nagi No Asukara."

If you're looking for realistic romance with good character writing, Nana is a really good choice, and if you're willing to take a chance on something completely different from anything you've listed in your post, Flowers of Evil is pretty great (very atmospheric and oppressive, fantastic characters again though).

Don't be put off by the rotoscoped art style; it can be off-putting at first, but it's perfect for the tone of the show.

Without giving too much away, it's a SOL about a guy who has been a shut-in for 3 years and has developed quite a few mental disorders from his lifestyle. The story largely involves him trying to change himself for the better, but not really knowing how to act around other people.   I had a roommate who had social anxiety disorder and the way the show presented it was done so perfectly. The interactions really range from comedic to dramatic to cringe-worthy sometimes. It's hard not to like the show as you're rooting for this guy who is just trying to make friends and to become a better person."

This show is pretty lengthy but I always recommend that people watch it until the end. Psycho-Pass is another on your list that I like to recommend to people. If you are at all interested in dystopian societies / violence / crime shows then you are in for a treat. Both of these shows have great villains and a good team of heroes.

In seriousness though, people don't like to accept this. but the Sadomaochistic-lesbianism does make sense as a theme. This is essentially a prison. How many prison dramas do we see with implied or even shown male on male rape (looking at you American History X), prison bitches or something similar?  That being said I can't really blame anyone for being offput because of that, if you don't want it fair enough, but add it to your drop list next time so it doesn't get suggested again. :P  In the meantime, Psycho-Pass and Shirobako are both anime original, though neither have really finished, we're still waiting on the English BD of the Psycho-Pass movie and Shirobako had a finale in a sense, but it is a SoL and SoLs don't really ever ""conclude their plots"" persay."

Animesuggest,3dhovn,EpicCenter134,2,Thu Jul 16 21:38:25 2015 UTC,"Mobile Suit Gundam. One of the most influential series ever made. Must-watch. You'll watch, think it's full of tropes, but you have to remember it invented those tropes. Much of Aldnoah/Zero, which you seemed to like, is shamelessly ripped straight from it. Heaven's Fall? Colony drop. Orbital Knights? Colonies. Landing Castles? Colony drop. Slaine? Char. Deucalion? White Base. And so on. Difference is, Gundam is an excellent series. If you liked Aldnoah/Zero, then you'll like this even more. If you don't want to watch 43 episodes, then there's a compilaton movie trilogy as well which is apparently quite well done. You've also got the rest of the franchise to explore.  Take Planetes off your on-hold list, it changes gears into a serious drama fairly soon.  Top wo Nerae! Gunbuster. Classic super robot OVA from the 80s, made by The Master, Mr Anno, himself. It's a real labour of love, and was basically a bunch of nerds making an anime full of everything they love about anime. It accomplishes in 6 episodes what most series fail to do in 25, with a strong cast, stunning and detailed animation, grand music, fantastic fights, and heaps of raw emotion. Its sequel, Top wo Nerae 2! Diebuster is fantastic as well, but not quite as good. It's a real homage to 80s Gainax.  Ghost in the Shell (1995). You say you've seen the must-watch shows but you haven't even seen one of the defining films of the 90s. Philosophical and intelligent science fiction. Plus, you've got the sequel film Innocence and the alternate universe series SAC.  Legend of the Galactic Heroes, a grand war opera full of politics. Start with My Conquest is the Sea of the Stars. Overture to a New War is a remade version of the first two episodes of the main OVA.  Of course you also have ABe's works, such as Serial Experiments Lain, Haibane Renmei, and Texhnolyze.

Animesuggest,3dh8ez,BrownCow123,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:04:08 2015 UTC,"Hellsing Ultimate   Trailer: The official one flat-out sucks. This one's a bit better, though it’s a little too long. What it's about: There's a secret battle going on in the dark corners of the world, a fight against ghouls, vampires, and who knows what else. The Hellsing Organisation of Great Britain is pledged to defend the realm against all such dangers. At the same time, it is locked in a continual struggle against the encroachment of the rival Catholic Church into its jurisdiction. Both tasks are becoming ever more difficult but, thankfully, they have an ace up their sleeve - an ancient vampire named Alucard who fights for reasons of his own. The question is: how far can he be trusted? Why watch it?: It's gory, dark, and action-packed from start to finish. Alucard is overpowered as hell, so if you're a fan of ""badass protagonists"", Hellsing Ultimate is a pretty safe bet. I'm a huge fan of the soundtrack too, which has a very distinctively dissonant jazzy feel to it. The story is relatively simple, but it sticks to its strengths and never gives the audience a dull moment. Caveats: Don't bother with the original series, Ultimate is the one you want to go for. The gore and fight scenes are deliberately over the top, Tarantinoesque.  Similar works: Elfen Lied, Tokyo Ghoul.     Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei   Trailer: Aniplex Trailer What it’s about: Magic is no longer a mystery, but a codified science upon which all modern militaries depend. To encourage development of the necessary skills, national academies have been set up for prospective talents to hone their skills. Tatsuya and Miyuki Shiba have just enrolled in ""First High"", only to discover that prejudice and classism are rife within the student body. Why you should watch it: This is an unapologetic power fantasy. It does away with the usual tropes of having the protagonist start out weak only to discover their true potential - Tatsuya starts off leagues ahead of his peers and stays that way. The magic system, politics, and general worldbuilding is intricate and detailed, and a lot of attention is lavished upon making sure the audience keeps up. The animation of the fight sequences is also pretty fantastic.  Caveats: The pacing is really, really weird. The complexity of the world requires a lot of exposition, which isn't handled as adroitly as one might hope - lots of sit-down ""As You Know"" conversations. There is a heavy (albeit one-way) incestual romantic substory going on, so if that squicks you out, I’d probably avoid the series. Themes: Objectivist-leaning discussion on privilege, responsibility, and classism Similar works: The world of A Certain Magical Index/A Certain Scientific Railgun is in many ways quite similar, though the story and characters are quite different."

(Screenshot) The Garden of Words: Really anything by Makoto Shinkai, but this is his most beautiful production to date. It's a 45 minute movie, and every scene is breathtaking. (Screenshot) The Tatami Galaxy: I'm currently watching this myself and am constantly taken by the visuals...so creative and over-the-top, in an artistic way. Unfortunately, as others in this thread have mentioned, there's no dub and the narrator talks at hyperspeed so you do spend most of the time looking at the subtitles. Still...I'd check it out because it's so fascinating to look at, when you get the chance to. (Screenshot) Dead Leaves: A pretty crappy, stupid story, but very visually entertaining. Feels like a comic book, lots of cartoony hyperviolence and bold colors. (Screenshot) Mushishi and Mushishi Zoku Shou: Both are very similar in every respect. This is just a really beautiful anime, very calming and at times bizarre, but the art style fits it so perfectly. I love the character designs in this anime, and the soft, realistic color palette. (Screenshot) Tekkon Kinkreet: Good movie, but the art is what makes it, if you ask me. Very singular, haven't seen anything that looks quite like it. (Screenshot)"

Animesuggest,3ded24,danbuter,6,Wed Jul 15 20:32:05 2015 UTC,"Gankutsuou. The clever use of textures and patterns create a gorgeous futuristic baroque setting and atmosphere.   Patema Inverted. The art style's standard - but the switching of camera angles makes for a unique visual experience.  The Tale of Princess Kaguya. A Ghibli movie. Its traditional japanese art style matches the story beautifully.     The Eccentric Family and House of Fives Leaves also have very distinctive art styles but no dubs.    The Secret of Kells - while not an anime, is a visually stunning piece of western animation with great voice acting. Thought I'd mention it, in case you ever feel like branching out."

Animesuggest,3ded24,zelce,4,Wed Jul 15 20:08:53 2015 UTC,"ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two - typical Shaft animation with some of the absolutely most creative scenes I've ever seen in anime. No idea if the dub is any good, but it's easy to appreciate the art even with subs. To be honest, you can watch most of Shaft's most popular anime besides Nisekoi and you won't be disappointed by the art and animation direction.  Kill la Kill - very rough art style to match the fast-paced, action-packed, whimsical nature of the anime's plot and of the strange dystopian ""academy"" in which it is set. Looks pretty when it wants to, and downright awesome when it needs to.  Hyouka - for the most part, just another of Kyoto Animation's gorgeously drawn anime, but there are quite a few interesting surreal moments that make it worth a mention here.  Saekano: How to Train the Ordinary Girl to Be the Heroine - parody that plays on all the tropes you see in dating sims and romance light novels (and their respective anime of course). Plays around with colourful stills to make it feel like a dating sim, and has a soundtrack typical to one. Filled with a lot of meta-humour jokes about the anime's art direction.  Redline - another crazy action flick like Kill la Kill, this time with an art style that somewhat resembles pop art to match the anime's retro cyberpunk feel.  The Tatami Galaxy - wahahaha, evil me, suggesting a show without a dub and with a main character who speaks so quickly even I can barely read the subtitles in time! I'm kidding, after the first ten minutes it's not so bad. It also looks great. Must-watch if you want creative art styles, subtitles or no."

Animesuggest,3dgzm6,Literally_Bokassa,2,Thu Jul 16 05:48:56 2015 UTC,"Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru   Trailer: Note that the promotional materials for this show were created to be deliberately misleading, painting it as a simple Slice of Life show. Nonetheless, here's the official preview trailer What it's about: Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero. That is, she's a proud member of her middle-school Hero Club, and she spends her days helping others with tasks great and small. As it turns out, however, the club is a front. It’s an excuse to gather together girls with the potential to use Holy Magic in defense of the world against the alien Vertex threat. This is a dream come true for the valiant Yuuki, but nobody seems to be able to give a straight answer about the details of the threat they face. Why you should watch it: The show is quite explicitly modeled after the hugely successful and influential Mahou Shoujo ""deconstruction"" Madoka Magica - just look at the character designs and colour schemes and you'll get a good idea of the roles each of the girls are going to play in the show. That said, the series takes its own path, spending a great deal more time developing its characters and showing them living their lives, and all the while the audience waits for the other shoe to drop. The audience gets a sense that something is off, something is wrong, but without anything specific to put a finger on. This tension is maintained marvelously. The show slowly builds upon itself, reaching a crescendo, allowing for all of the built up emotion and uneasy feeling to spill over. The result is a consistent ride of trepidation that never lets up.Backing this up is some seriously gorgeous artwork for the ""battleground"" world and an energetic soundtrack that keeps up handily with the action set pieces.  Caveats: First off, this is unapologetically a Mahou Shoujo series, complete with fan-servicey transformation scenes and butt-kicking middle school girls. What ""twists"" there are are also spread across the whole series, so you're going to be spending a great deal of time watching general Slice of Life scenes with the characters interacting in a relatively normal middle school environment. Themes: Sacrifice and altruism, friendship and family. Power comes with a price, but that price is worth paying to protect those you care about. As the show explicitly states, anything is possible if you try hard enough with your friends.  Similar works: Madoka Magica, Selector Infected WIXOSS.     Zipang   Trailer: Opening animation What it's about: The newly-built Japanese AEGIS Cruiser Mirai is on its way to a routine joint training exercise with the U.S. Navy at Pearl Harbor, when it is caught in a bizarre storm. Once the rains and wind pass, they find that there’s no satellite signal and no sign of their escort ships. But things are stranger than they seem, and the crew soon discover that they’ve left the 21st Century behind – the date is June 4, 1942, and the Battle of Midway is about to begin. Why you should watch it: It's a fantastic war drama, posing an interesting question: with the military capability to shift the balance of the war in any direction they choose, should the crew of the Mirai support their homeland, attempt to minimise casualties by ending the war sooner, or maintain neutrality in the hopes of bringing their own future to pass? There's no right answer, and each of the characters wrestles with the issues that arise from holding information and military power that could turn the tide of the greatest war in modern history. Refreshingly for a show about war, neither side (nor any of the characters, in fact) are made into simple bad guys. Everyone has their own ideals, their own ideas about what to make of the situation that they've now found themselves in. Caveats: This is a drama with action scenes, not an action show with dramatic scenes. Don't go in expecting explosions and battles in every episode. Also, the show was produced for the purpose of drawing people into reading the manga, and the ending is an obvious invitation to do just that. Unfortunately, while there’s a lot of content left in the manga, very little of it past the anime end point has been translated into English by fans, and there is no official licenced version on the horizon. Finally, the CGI scenes are pretty basic. Thankfully, they're not the focus of the show, usually being simple transition and establishing shots of the fleets and aircraft. Themes: Can a people brought up in peace truly judge the actions of soldiers fighting to defend their homeland? Do you sacrifice a known and prosperous future for the lives being lost in the present? Where does ones duty lie - to country? captain? friends or strangers? Zipang poses a lot of questions, and leaves it to the viewer to decide the answers for themselves Similar works: Gate has the JSDF facing off against an even more technologically disadvantaged foe, but doesn’t worry too much about the morality of war, simplifying the situation with an unambiguously evil opponent. For that aspect of Zipang, you’re better off looking at shows like Flag and, to a lesser extent, Legend of the Galactic Heroes. Outside of anime, John Birmingham's Axis of Time novels have a very similar premise (though it's an American fleet transported back, rather than a single Japanese cruiser)."

Animesuggest,3dd9qi,GeeJo,24,Wed Jul 15 13:12:29 2015 UTC,"Serial Experiments Lain   Trailer: English dubbed trailer What it's about: Lain is an isolated, troubled girl. At home, her parents and sister barely acknowledge her existence, and at school her only link to her classmates is her friend Alice. Hers isn't a unique situation, of course - all across the world, people are becoming disconnected from their real lives, in favour of the digital experiences of the Internet. But increasingly strange events seem to point to a deeper connection between Lain and the world of the Wired. Why you should watch it: Lain is a unique experience. It's a moody, existential work that trusts the audience enough to let them draw their own conclusions about what is going on, about what is real and why things are playing out as they are. The sound design is fantastic, getting a lot of work out of extended silences, and the soundtrack suits the show. The director's background in Japanese horror shines through in almost every aspect of the show - there are no (or few) ""jump scares"", but Lain manages to evoke an intense feeling of isolation and unease. If you're up for a slow-burning psychological show that presents you with puzzles and questions you're going to have to spend some time (or a second viewing) unwrapping, give it a go. Caveats: I think the above section should be enough to decide whether to watch the show or not. It is slow-burning, it is existential and philosophical, and there isn't a lot of traditional anime ""action"" going on. Decide for yourself if that's what you're looking for, because the show makes no apologies. Themes: The division of fantasy and reality is the heart of the show, with a lot of musing going on about the nature of the self - if everyone agrees on the nature of reality, or that you are a certain type of person, can you really dispute those perceptions? Can a person have more than one identity at a time, and deliberately craft those identities to display different aspects of themselves while still remaining whole? Similar works: The works of Satoshi Kon, particularly Paranoia Agent. Texhnolyze, Ergo Proxy.      Paranoia Agent   Trailer: Fan-made English dubbed trailer What it's about: Tsukiko Sagi, creator of the beloved cartoon character Maromi, is on her way home from work when she's attacked from behind. The description she gives of her assailant - a young boy with a bent golden baseball bat and inline skates - leads the media to dub him ""Shonen Bat"" ('Lil Slugger in the English dub). But while Tsukiko was the first victim, she's far from the last. The police are put under increasing pressure as more and more people are attacked, with seemingly no connection between the incidents or the people involved. Why you should watch it: Paranoia Agent is the sole foray by the acclaimed director Satoshi Kon into TV anime. It's a psychological mystery show aimed at an exclusively adult audience, and it isn't afraid to swim in deeper waters in its content and themes. While loosely episodic, every character's story ties into the central plot in some fashion, providing different insights into the mystery of Shonen Bat, little snippets of this giant world that you are trying to piece together. In the end, the multiple pieces come together to form something pretty amazing, that may or may not leave a good mark depending on how you enjoyed the rest of the show. The animation and character designs really stand out from the crowd, and Kon's use of dreamlike sequences, magical realism and blurring the lines between fantasy and reality makes this a surprising and fun watch, especially as the plot comes to a head in the final few episodes. It also has one of the weirdest and most subtly disturbing intros of all time. Caveats: This is a weird show. It doesn't so much play with your expectations as throw them out and invite you to keep up. Disregarding convention can work really well for some people, but for a general crowd it's just off-putting, and opinions are split on how well the show treads the line. It can also at times seem like it's not really going anywhere, particularly with the trio of almost standalone stories in episodes 8-10. Themes: The lies people tell themselves, and the false fronts they put up for others. The way that people tend to seize upon easy solutions and escapes rather than actually solve problems, and the way this comes back to hurt themselves and others. The power that fear, stress, paranoia, gossip and imagination hold over human society, and the way that mass media only heightens the effects. People more familiar than I with Japanese society read it as a condemnation of post-war Japan itself, particularly ""kawaii culture"" and otaku-ism. There's a lot of different ways to read the show. Similar works: The works of Haruki Murakami. Wind-up Bird Chronicle and maybe 1Q84 in particular. David Lynch too, now that I think about it. Within anime, look to Kon's film work, such as Paprika and Perfect Blue, or to psychological shows like Serial Experiments Lain"

A majority of episodes are non-linear, and episodic in storytelling. So episode four may actually occur before the events of episode one, while they are all loosely tied to one-another.  There is an overarching plot and story that isn't evident till much later on, but there are strands of it throughout every episode, and coupled with the lack of exposition, makes you sit back and really think about what happen, and try to draw your own theories/what happened."

Animesuggest,3dfbto,anonymepelle,3,Wed Jul 15 20:48:05 2015 UTC,"Bartender   Trailer: Opening animation What it’s about: Despite his youth, Ryuu Sasakura has gained a reputation as a master bartender among his peers and patrons alike. People seek out his bar in the hopes of receiving the perfect cocktail - a ""Glass of the Gods"" that not only suits their desires but guides them on the next step of their journey.  Why you should watch it: It's a laid-back, meditative slice-of-life show. There's nothing all that flashy about it, but every episode introduces new patrons with new problems and new stories to tell. There's nothing outlandish or unbelievable about the stories (aside from Ryuu's Sherlockian ability to read the minutia of behaviour), but they're all interesting and well put-together. The show is unabashedly Western-focused, with cocktails, stories and trivia drawn from the UK and the U.S., and literary references ranging from Thoreau and Hemingway to Rabelais and Descartes. The show does a good job of introducing and settling each story in its own episode and, as a bonus, each episode ends with a recipe for the featured cocktails, if you want to try them yourself. Bartender isn't in the running for ""greatest show of all time"", but it's a unique experience and well worth checking out if you want a bit of a breather from heavier or more action-packed series. Caveats: With no overarching plot, it's a show that's best watched an episode at a time. Just sit back with a drink in hand, because you'll definitely want one by the end of each show. Themes: Well, on the surface, the show's message might be read as ""alcohol is the solution to every problem"" but, really, it's more about how the great stresses and tortured dilemmas that we all face really aren't that bad - that all one needs is some distance and time to reflect, and the courage to see what needs to be done. And, of course, a receptive ear as we moan about our lot. Similar works: The Time of Eve, A Piece of Phantasmagoria.     Denki-gai no Honya-san   Trailer: Japanese trailer What it's about: The Umanohone is one of the many bookstores in Japan selling manga, light novels, and doujins (even the dirty ones). More importantly, it's home to a wide range of characters with their own particular appreciation for the industry, from an aspiring manga writer to a girl obsessed with zombie-media.  Why you should watch it: Denki-gai is a slice-of-life comedy show focusing on relationship humour and raunchy jokes at the expense of the more easily-embarrassed members of the cast. It's pretty trope-heavy and shamelessly pokes fun at the manga/anime industry and its otaku fanbase, but never gets mean about it. There's also a surprising amount of time set aside for romantic developments between the characters. In all, it's a light, fluffy comedy to relax with between heavier fare. Caveats: The brand of comedy is made pretty clear in the first episode and doesn't move away from that. So you can pretty safely decide whether to continue just based on that. Similar works: Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, Working!!"

As a comedy, Devil/PT stands out simply for being ""funny because it is"" and NHK especially for being so realistic. Of all of them, I would say that NHK and Eden are the best (not counting FLCL as my personal, subjective favorite) and also Yamada and Mermaid if you are looking for something that's primarily a comedy. Sadly, Devil is an incomplete manga adaption. The plot's great but doesnt get explored in the anime, but it has a ""conclusive enough"" vibe, kinda like Spice & Wolf 2 and Sakurasou (no one agrees with me here, but it at least resolved the final arc so I'm saying it)"

Animesuggest,3ddjik,HughSurname,2,Wed Jul 15 17:05:43 2015 UTC,"Btooom! kind of fits this. The fighting mostly involves explosives, but there are no super powers or ninja moves involved. It's all about tactics and outsmarting your opponent. There are some physical fights too, but they're all realistic.   The setting is people get sent to an unknown island and are forced to participate in a real-life version of a game called Btooom. Everyone has a crystal embedded into their hand, and the winners are determined by whoever gets 8 crystals together.   Some examples would be someone having a C4 type bomb, and setting it under a rock. Then he gets someone to chase him to kill him, and runs past the C4. As the pursuer chases him, he activates the C4 and kills the other person."

Animesuggest,3dd24f,LordTumnas,2,Wed Jul 15 09:05:10 2015 UTC,"Hey there. The Fate series is pretty complicated, so here is my (somewhat) quick and (hopefully) easy guide to how best to watch the Fate series for you. Starting with Fate Zero is a perfectly fine way to do it, but it may not be the best way. I have recently adapted this guide, so any and all feedback on it is welcome.  It is recommended that you read the following notes before the guide to understand what I'm talking about. If you really don't want to, you can skip down to the next section.   The Fate franchise started with a visual novel by Type-Moon, Fate/stay night, which has three routes: Fate, Unlimited Blade Works, and Heaven's Feel, which are intended to be read or watched in that order. Currently, the Fate route has a poor adaptation by Studio Deen called Fate/stay night (2006), which will also spoil the other routes. It is not recommended for beginners.  Unlimited Blade Works has a reasonable adaptation by ufotable. It has a prologue and two seasons, which you should consider as one complete anime. However, UBW was never intended as an introduction to the series, and is considerably weaker without first reading having read the Fate route. There is also a Studio Deen movie of the same route. It is terrible. Do not confuse the two. A film adaptation of Heaven's Feel is currently being made by ufotable. It currently has no confirmed release date.  There is a prequel to all three routes called Fate Zero, which was the first to be animated by ufotable. However, it is by no means intended to be watched first as it will spoil a great deal of the Fate route and of Heaven's Feel. It also has two seasons which you should consider as one anime.  There is a Magical Girl spinoff series called Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya and a Type-Moon parody sketch series known as Carnival Phantasm. If you've heard of these before, these are not part of the main canon; do not worry about them just yet. Only watch them after everything else.  There is a sequel visual novel called Fate/hollow atoraxia, which you can only read after all three routes of the original VN.      So, with which anime should I start the franchise?  Unfortunately, there isn't a perfect way to start: if you start with Fate/stay night (2006), the other routes will be spoiled; if you start with Unlimited Blade Works you will have a somewhat confusing entry to the anime and you will have to wait for Heaven's Feel to be released before you watch Fate Zero unless you want to spoil it; and if you start with Fate Zero you'll have spoiled Heaven's Feel.   The absolute best way, then, is to start with the visual novel. I cannot stress this point enough; once you start any of the Fate anime, the first whole route of the VN at least is spoiled.  Understandably, not everyone wants to do this. If you are unsure, you could always try playing through the prologue of the VN (~3 hours long) to get a feel for the novel's style. After reading the prologue, you could then:    Read all three routes (recommended)  Read the first route and continue with Unlimited Blade Works, then Heaven's Feel, then Fate Zero (perfectly fine, but you'll still have to wait for Heaven's Feel to be released) Abandon the VN entirely and continue with one of the anime-only routes:        Unlimited Blade Works -> Heaven's Feel -> Fate Zero   (This is for those who are willing to wait for Heaven's Feel to be released. It has the advantage of containing fewer spoilers.)   Fate Zero -> Unlimited Blade Works -> Heaven's Feel   (This way has more spoilers, but has the advantages of being a better introduction to the series (besides Fate Zero's first episode, which is bland but necessary to watch) and not requiring you to wait a long time for Heaven's Feel to be released before you watch it all.)  Do not watch Unlimited Blade Works -> Fate Zero -> Heaven's Feel, as this way contains the most spoilers, has the worst start to the series, and is generally likely to be very unsatisfying. If you do not think you can wait for HF before watching Zero, do not start with UBW, start with Zero.  Other than that, it's entirely up to you. You'll hopefully enjoy the series either way, so pick a watch order and get stuck in!"
Animesuggest,3dd24f,longliveaffinity,-1,Wed Jul 15 11:27:02 2015 UTC,"No. F/Z first is the worst option.   The original visual novel is composed of three routes. These are, in the order they are unlocked in the original release of the game:   Fate Unlimited Blade Works (UBW) Heaven's Feel (HF)   Fate sets down the rules of the world and does a lot of exposition and infodumping, and introduces many of the key characters and themes. UBW builds upon this knowledge, and explores other characters in more depth. Finally, HF builds upon the knowledge from these two routes and goes even more in-depth on the setting, on the themes, and on the characters. In the newer releases of the game, this order is not enforced, by it should still be adhered to for the optimal experience.   In certain routes, some characters have very little place in the story, while in others they may be main characters. That is why this structure is used.  Now we reach the anime adaptations. There are three entries currently: Fate/stay night (2006) by DEEN (henceforth referred to as F/D), Fate/Zero (2011) by ufotable (or F/Z) and Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works (2014) by ufotable (or F/SN: UBW).  This is where it becoems difficult. F/Z is a prequel to the events of the VN, but it is assumed that you have read the VN. Many events which were BIG reveals in the VN are nonchalantly dropped in the first episode of F/Z like it was nothing. In fact, the entire ending of F/Z does not even make sense if you haven't read the final route of the VN, HF.  Therefore, F/Z cannot be watched first. So how do you go anime-only? Well, F/D was an adaptation of the Fate route so it would make sense to start there. Trouble is, it was made to sell the VN, so it was a mishmash of the VN routes. And it has shocking animation. And it's generally considered terrible, both as an adaptation and as an original work. So not watching it would be optimal.  That leaves us only F/SN: UBW, which was ufotable's adaptation of the second route of the VN. If you watch that without having read the VN... well, a lot of important reveals that happened in the Fate route would be unknown to you, so you would not know the significance of many of the events that transpire in F/SN: UBW. Not only that, but F/SN: UBW has a lot of callbacks to F/Z, so it makes sense to have seen F/Z before F/SN: UBW. Trouble is, F/Z spoils much of the Fate route and the HF route. We have reached a contradiction by trying to go anime-only. Either we watch F/SN: UBW and miss out the much of its significance, or we watch F/Z and ruin a lot of Fate and HF. Not only that, but F/SN: UBW cut a lot of internal dialogue which explained many character's actions and thoughts - watching F/SN: UBW without having read UBW would be, I imagine, an incredibly confusing experience. Obviously, this seems to be no good.  This leaves us with HF. One of the suggestions I see thrown around a lot is the 'optimal' anime-only route (F/SN: UBW -> wait for upcoming Heaven's Feel movies -> F/Z). This is the closest to the intended watch order as you're going to get. Trouble is you'll be wating for years.  The only way to watch everything and enjoy it to its fullest is to read the VN in its full, all routes, in order. Then you can go on and watch whatever you like, as spoilers no longer affect you.  In conclusion, the optimal path is:  VN (Fate -> UBW -> HF) -> F/Z -> F/SN:UBW  I hope this has helped you.   If you absolutely refuse to read the visual novel, the second-best option is UBW -> wait for Heaven's Feel movies -> F/Z.  The next-worst option is UBW -> F/Z -> wait for HF.  The worst possible option is to watch F/Z first."
Animesuggest,3dd24f,Who_is_Zander,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:45:55 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say it's the worst option.   The series is still very enjoyable if you end up watching it in that order. F/Z was my introduction to the series anyways. Series is now my favorite as well.  Maybe I'm just not a purist.
Animesuggest,3dd24f,zamwut,-1,Wed Jul 15 11:14:57 2015 UTC,I think the only danger of watching F/Z first is it might bait you into thinking UBW will be good too
Animesuggest,3dd5jj,Liawuffeh,3,Wed Jul 15 09:53:52 2015 UTC,"Just using those examples, I'm left guessing you like high-paced action (ie. actual fight scenes being a regular occurrence), and a story that isn't drawn out. To name some that are commonly popular;     The first thing that comes to mind is Berserk. But, you might want to check out an episode or two before deciding to dedicate yourself, as - like you said - some people do raise issue with the art style and/or older animation.   Also sounds like Fullmetal Alchemist/Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood might be up your alley.   Code Geass Is a crowd favourite. Pretty badass storyline and main character.   For something that'll have a very similar feel to Rurouni Kenshin in terms of story and characters, you won't go wrong with Trigun.     ...actually there really are just too many that fit the terms you've provided, so I'ma stop before I end up here for hours.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes, especially if you include the OVAs, starts in their childhood and maybe covers 30 years. Several seasons.

If you haven't, then that should probably be at #1 on your to-watch list. It's the best match based on the anime you've watched, has the most universal appeal of arguably any anime series anyone could recommend, and is considered by many to be one of the best anime series (#1 on MAL). I'll recommend other series as well, but I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong with Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood here (keep in mind that the are 2 Full Metal Alchemist series; you don't have to watch the original Full Metal Alchemist and can go straight to Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood because Brotherhood is a reboot, not a sequel).  Other recommendations based on your taste:   Magi (I've seen all the series you listed, and I'd say Magi probably is the anime you'd enjoy most based on the shows you listed, second only to Full Metal Alchemist; the show has 2 seasons: Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic, and Magi: The Kingdom of Magic, with Labyrinth being the first season; it's shounen fantasy and is based in a Middle Eastern setting). Black Lagoon (Mostly episodic with a few arcs, extremely action-packed and violent, probably the most exciting show you could watch if you just want non-stop action with guns and stuff) Darker than Black (Mostly episodic, similar to Black Lagoon but with more supernatural aspects, lots of action but not as much as Black Lagoon) Cowboy Bebop (Space Western, also mostly episodic, very noir, must-watch if you're looking for a classic anime series) Baccano! (Lots of action, non-linear Pulp-Fictionesque style of storytelling) D. Gray-Man (Shounen, Demons, Supernatural, Fantasy) Monster (This one's Seinen. If you want something darker, this is it. Monster is a masterpiece of storytelling, considered by many to be one of the best horror/thriller anime ever made. However, if you're looking for just action, Monster is not the series for you. Monster is classified as a thriller, but the thrill comes from the show's masterful use of suspense, rather than its action.) Attack On Titan (You've probably already heard of this one, but if for some reason you haven't, I figured I'd list it as well. It gets some flak for being ""overrated"" nowadays, but that doesn't mean it's not good. After all, it got popular for a reason. Great action, and giant titans are quite thrilling.)"

Animesuggest,3datw8,animeisbae,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:13:28 2015 UTC,"A Piece of Phantasmagoria   Trailer: None that I can find. The episodes are only three minutes each, though, so a trailer seems a bit redundant. What it’s about: The world of Phantasmagoria exists only in dreams, populated by a bizarre set of groups and individuals. Each episode provides a small glimpse into a different section of the world, steadily assembling a picture of a strange world of interconnected and bizarre locations. From a town made of bread to a sea of glass, from a factory converting rainbows into paint to the movie projector that overlays the stars into the night sky, the inhabitants of Phantasmagoria interact in unusual and unpredictable ways with the place they call home. Why you should watch it: It’s a sedate, dreamlike series of shorts. Bedtime stories, really. The calm narration, the surreal but peaceful people and events, even the simplistic visuals and sound design all seem to come together to present something truly unique. This is a pretty classic take on animation. It’s imaginative, it’s weird, and it’s wonderful. It’s not really a show to binge through, though. Just take an episode or two at a time before bed or when you feel the need to calm down a bit. Caveats: The show has very, very crude animation even for its time, and it looks even worse in comparison to the slick presentation of the average show today. It’s also quite hard to find a legal subtitled copy of the series, though there are always certain places on the web that will have it available. Similar works: Bartender has a very similar feel to this show. As does Mushishi, to a lesser extent. Outside of anime, take a look at Salvador Dali’s Destino."

Animesuggest,3d9to8,danbuter,3,Tue Jul 14 16:55:08 2015 UTC,"Giant Robo is possibly the gold standard for pulp globe-trotting adventure in a setting that claims to be the future but really draws a lot on steam- and diesel-era technology. Definitely give that a shot. The Space Cobra TV show is very much a kind of 'two-fisted tales' space series -- I wrote a more in-depth recommendation here. If you've not tried it, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and its sequel series both have strong influences from penny dreadfuls, action comics and Indiana Jones; I suspect you're most likely to enjoy the first series -- which is set in late nineteenth-century Britain and then 1930s America and Europe. The second series is a bit more puerile at times. It's less directly like a classic pulp adventure story, but specifically if you're interested in flying ships ala Last Exile, Simoun is actually quite good if you can get into the unusual premise. EDIT: Further thought: if you've not tried it already, Space Battleship Yamato 2199 is a recent space opera series which, because of its origins, cleaves quite faithfully to the kind of fantastical imagery and sincere optimism often seen in early/mid-twentieth-century space opera."

Amagami SS is a pretty interesting show, too. For dubbed you could try Beck, or Kanon (2006) if you dont mind heavy drama (its kind of a more comedy-heavy version of Clannad)"

I'd say the same for JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012) - even though the protagonist isnt alone, he's usually fighting on his own. They more or less take turns, I guess, and honestly these 2 shows are outrageously good for action shounens so I wanted to recommend them anyways.

My personal recommendations from your PTW list would be One Outs, Psycho Pass and No Game No Life. For NGNL think mind games like Death Note/Code Geass but far less serious and only 12 episodes. One Outs is my favourite mind games anime, and is about psychological tactics used in baseball (sounds a bit boring but its very good)."

Animesuggest,3d6s94,AdrianWillis22,6,Tue Jul 14 01:10:56 2015 UTC,"The arguments I have heard (not that I agree with them all but make your own decision) are:   Watch the original first because after watching Brotherhood, the feel of the series is different and not as enjoyable. To get the best out of both watch Brotherhood after Watch the original first because it spends more time developing the characters. Watch Brotherhood first as its the superior and intended story by the original author. Watch Brotherhood first as you might not want to commit yourself to 51 episodes, a movie, and then get to the 64 episodes. If you love Brotherhood you can always check the original out later.   Here is what is recommended  Personally I just recommend Brotherhood because I personally prefer it and don't like recommending a show that would require watching 51 episodes and a movie first."

Animesuggest,3d6s94,AdrianWillis22,5,Mon Jul 13 23:53:31 2015 UTC,"Definitely Fullmetal: Alchemist Brotherhood  Amazing soundtrack/universe/action, with a fun and relatable cast, epic and mysterious story told with little time wasted, tragic and/or interesting backstory for most characters all with a solid conclusion to their own story, written for teenage/young adult males by a female author - so it appeals beyond the intended audience - with great female characters and emotional scenes.   Its the number one rated anime on several sites such as MAL for a good reason. Oh and every anime you have watched is a battle shonen or has a lot of battle shonen aspects in it. If Hunter x Hunter is the pinnacle of a battle shonen, FMA:B is the pinnacle of battle shonen thats focus is predominately not on the battle shonen aspects.  You are fine either watching FMA or FMA:B first. Both are complete with the same beginning and have conclusive but different endings.  Edit:  You'd probably like:   Fate Series - watch order Soul Eater - Recommend checking out the manga as they deviate from each other. Baccano Claymore - recommended switching to the manga for the full story - also the anime's ending is anime original, rushed, and should just be ignored.

It will blow your mind and pull heartstrings at the same time, and will leave you breathless at all moments.

There were always things I enjoyed about it but I didn't find it nearly as funny as everyone else.  Finally I'm like 234 episodes in, and I don't regret it. Solid 8/10.  It has some amazing moments/episodes, some poor episodes, and on average it has solid comedy episodes.  Watching a comedy anime is really easy to do because the episodes sorta fly by once you get used to them.  I've been watching on and off for over a year, sometimes I watch when I'm in the mood, and sometimes I pound out 50 episodes in a couple days.  Overall it's been worth it and there's a lot to enjoy. If I'm the most critical person of the series out there (that actually watched most/all of it), then the odds are good that anyone else who gets as far as me will like it even more.  If you find references funny, or are familiar with a lot of battle shounen/Gundam/Dragon Quest stuff, then there's tons of references you'll enjoy.

Animesuggest,3d7dtd,Clannad-Feelchair,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:49:04 2015 UTC,It's not such a huge flaw when you think about it having over 270 episodes and counting. Getting through the beginning ensures you still have hundreds of episodes that are worth it.

Hmm besides that I really can't think of anything more, maybe it is just not your kind of humor, otherwise you could just check out a few episodes of the latest season and see if you enjoy those and go back and watch the older episodes later, but you'll not be able to enjoy some jokes based on characters."

But even after episode 25, it was only around a 6 or 7 for me, but after I got to the serious arcs it shot up immediately and I loved it. The thing about Gintama is that it keeps getting better. The episodes get funnier, the animation gets better, the inside jokes make me want to abandon my sides, and the serious arcs get better and better. The characters are so lovable too. I didn't get the hype with Gintama either at first but it is definitely a 10/10 for me."
Animesuggest,3d7dtd,zoukon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:55:42 2015 UTC,"The thing about gintama is that it has a slow start to solidify the setting and characters. This takes about 20 episodes, which is quite long, but worth it. The gallery of characters is huge, and most of them are interesting. I find the setting to be genious, because it allows pretty much anything to happen.  Really enjoying gintama really comes down to understanding the references, but even without the references the show is still enjoyable. You will most likely have to force yourself through some of the first episodes, but i am sure that you will enjoy it afterwards.  And don't watch watch episode 1 and 2. they are filler and they are horrible!"
Animesuggest,3d7dtd,b4rth,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:37:19 2015 UTC,"I felt this way about Gintama for awhile - I'd watch an episode here or there around other shows and never really understood what all the fuss was about. I also tried to read the manga because manga is my preference, but felt the same way.  I'm not sure at what point my feelings changed. I still don't necessarily marathon Gintama in the way I do other shows but I'm a big fan. Part of it was abandoning any expectations of what Gintama really was or could be. (I reckon I'd really bloody love a serious version of Gintama with the same characters, similar themes but with an actual overarching plotline... Can barely imagine it now.) But going with the flow and basically just getting to know the characters makes a big difference. Hell, my favourite episode is 23 minutes of the gang sitting around a table participating in true mental warfare over who gets to eat all the meat.  I'm still working my way through it alongside other shows so it's taking me far longer than usual, but I don't mind. When I actually sit down to watch it (usually to break up longer marathons of the aforementioned other shows, or if I only have 20 mins) I really, reaaaally enjoy it - for me it just doesn't have that ""addictive"" quality I was looking for and expecting in the beginning. In any case I'm gonna be really sad when I catch up, but at least I can then move onto the manga!"

Animesuggest,3d7dtd,duckface08,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:47:15 2015 UTC,"As the others said, Gintama has a slow start. I personally didn't start seeing why it was so good until about 20-25 episodes in, but once I got over that hill, the comedy became pure gold and things just got better from there.   The thing about Gintama is that it has a huge cast of characters, so the first 20 or so episodes really sets them up. Once the set up is done, you'll know the characters - who are friends, who are enemies, who are rivals - and the jokes play off those relationships with ever greater depth, occasionally even bringing back minor characters from the past and fleshing them out even more. On top of all that, Gintama never forgets to have fun and make fun of, well, everything, from other anime or video games to politicians (including Obama) and historical figures.  If it helps, Gintama is mostly an episodic series, occasionally featuring short story arcs, so you don't have to feel pressured to watch it all at once. Take your time with it and enjoy it when you're in the mood."

Animesuggest,3d4nrl,DinoTsar415,9,Mon Jul 13 18:13:35 2015 UTC,"Ergo Proxy   Trailer: English dubbed version What it’s about: The show is set in a futuristic utopian (read: dystopian) city, Romdeau.  Humans and robots coexist, with the issues of basic subsistence and social order maintained through a system of central management. In the middle of this is Lil Meyer, a young and ambitious investigator from the Citizen Information Board, and a new immigrant worker named Vincent Law. But something is on the loose, a mystery that the authorities seem willing to do anything to contain and that will embroil both protagonists into a crisis that threatens to destroy the stagnant safety of Romdeau City. Why you should watch it: The series is serious, sober, and philosophical, with a richness of symbolism and thematic development that’s rare to find in any work, let alone an anime. It’s a mystery show that doesn’t spoon-feed its audience, trusting you to be intelligent and observant enough to keep up. The sound design and animation are fantastic: the muted palette and brooding soundtrack combine to create a suitably oppressive, claustrophobic atmosphere to match the storyline. The two protagonists are pretty well-developed, maturing steadily over the course of the show. Caveats: Whenever a series has an explicit philosophical bent, there are always those who are going to see pretentiousness. Ergo Proxy doesn’t help itself in this regard by being fairly meandering, all too happy to spend multiple episodes on things that don’t really move the plot forward. The show can get pretty depressing with a palette primarily composed of browns and greys and its general dystopian feel, but it’s definitely worth a watch. Themes: Living in a dying world. Gnosticism – flawed creators and flawed creations. What it means to be human. Similar works: Texhnolyze. Outside of anime, Sandman.     It may not seem like it to begin with, but  Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru   Trailer: Note that the promotional materials for this show were created to be deliberately misleading, painting it as a simple Slice of Life show. Nonetheless, here’s the official preview trailer What it’s about: Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero. That is, she’s a proud member of her middle-school Hero Club, and she spends her days helping others with tasks great and small. As it turns out, however, the club is a front. It’s an excuse to gather together girls with the potential to use Holy Magic in defense of the world against the alien Vertex threat. This looks like a dream come true for the valiant Yuuki, but nobody seems to be able to give a straight answer about the details of the threat they face. Why you should watch it: The show is quite explicitly modeled after the hugely successful and influential Mahou Shoujo “deconstruction” Madoka Magica – just look at the character designs and colour schemes and you’ll get a good idea of the roles each of the girls are going to play in the show. That said, the series takes its own path, spending a great deal more time developing its characters and showing them living their lives, and all the while the audience waits for the other shoe to drop. The audience gets a sense that something is off, something is wrong, but without anything specific to put a finger on. This tension is maintained marvelously. The show slowly builds upon itself, reaching a crescendo, allowing for all of the built up emotion and uneasy feeling to spill over. The result is a consistent ride of trepidation that never lets up.Backing this up is some seriously gorgeous artwork for the “battleground” world and an energetic soundtrack that keeps up handily with the action set pieces. Caveats: First off, this is unapologetically a Mahou Shoujo series, complete with fan-servicey transformation scenes and butt-kicking middle school girls. What “twists” there are are also spread across the whole series, so you’re going to be spending a great deal of time watching general Slice of Life scenes with the characters interacting in a relatively normal middle school environment. Themes: Sacrifice and altruism, friendship and family. Power comes with a price, but that price is worth paying to protect those you care about. As the show explicitly states, anything is possible if you try hard enough with your friends. Similar works: Madoka Magica, Selector Infected WIXOSS.     Black Bullet   Trailer:PV Trailer What it’s about: The apocalypse has come and gone. A parasitic species known as the Gastrea has infected every animal and person outside of a few sanctuaries, transforming them into monsters capable of passing the infection onto others. Tokyo lies in the shadows of a protective boundary of monoliths, but some Gastrea still slip through the cracks. Government-sponsored contractors, or “civil officers”, are responsible for hunting them down. They operate in pairs: children born with a mediated form of the Gastrea infection (granting them unusual powers) with an older watchdog. The show follows one such pair, Rentarou and Enju, as they combat threats to the city. Why you should watch it: It’s an adrenaline-pumping action show that switches between humour and pathos on a dime. The fight sequences are excellent, but the show also takes pains to develop the characters of the protagonists and their allies. The show throws a lot of stuff at the wall in a very short space of time, so if you don’t find the first episode to your taste, give it another one or two to make sure. Caveats: The humour is quite lowbrow – mostly innuendo and slapstick. The show tries to pack way too much into the early episodes, making it feel a little rushed. And at its heart it’s a show about ass-kicking little girls and giant monsters. If that doesn’t sound like your kind of thing, it’s probably not worth your time. Themes: At what point does your obligation to protect a populace who hates you end? Humans as weapons. Similar works: Unbreakable Machine Doll. Attack on Titan."

Animesuggest,3d6j96,flyscan,2,Tue Jul 14 01:03:24 2015 UTC,"The yuri most people will refer to is that one of the characters has a bit of a crush on another.

For me personally, I was indifferent to the anime ""well that was a stupid waste of time"" and never thought about it further. I discovered the manga by accident looking for something after Battle Angel Alita, somewhere though the first through chapters I got hooked... Sure it's not for everyone, but, well... I would say there is a very short list of works that's made a lasting emotional impact on me: Berserk (Golden Age Arc), The Cay (book), Battle Angel Alita, Brothers (computer game), Game of Thrones (book), One Piece (Arlong Park Arc)  Also, I'm curious, at what stage did you drop Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica?"
Animesuggest,3d59kh,shadowchampion,9,Mon Jul 13 17:06:40 2015 UTC,Seirei no Moribito MC uses a Spear.  Monster fighting does not happen until late in the series prior that it is fighting other people.  Utawarerumono MC only ever uses a fan.  He is more a comander in the army.  This is bit a harem / fan service + fantasy show.  Not so much monster fighting as war / battles although everyone looks a little monster-ish with ears and tails and wings.
Animesuggest,3d59kh,RareBlur,2,Mon Jul 13 17:59:38 2015 UTC,"I second Utawarerumono.  You can also try Slayers, where the main character focuses on magic.  She technically uses a sword...but only maybe three times in the whole series.  She'd rather just blow up a problem with a fireball or dragon slave than use a weapon.  The supporting characters are the ones who focus on swords.  And depending on how loose you want to be with the genre of fantasy, there's tons of Mahou Shoujo series where a character doesn't use a sword.  Or any weapon at all.  The most common weapon is usually a magic rod of some kind."

Surely one of us here has started it and can help you out.   Here is an overview for all the anime airing this season.    Character Discussion  Favorite Characters as per MAL  I wasn't really sure what to write, but looking at these characters, it's actually fairly obvious that my favorite characters have some sort of darkness or had a dark chapter in their lives.  Suppose I'll write a bit about the lesser known of these.  Hime ""Himeko"" Onizuka  is my favorite from this list and also representative of the whole SKET-dan, since all three of them are amazing.   Leaving all the hilarious things that make up their characters aside, they all went through some serious bullshit and only through helping each other, got out of their misery, able to move on and found a club dedicated to helping others.  Feitan is a member of the phantom troupe, a criminal organization, is fond of torturing people, speaks in a barely audible whisper and has one of the craziest laughs I've heard. His ability and weaponry is very interesting and at least he cares about the other members of the troupe.   Kageyama was my favorite in Haikyuu!! pretty much from the get-go. Grumpy, brutally honest, narzissistic and incredibly gifted. He opened up with the help of the other club members and formed an amazing pair with Hinata.  Stuff I dislike: Random moe-blobs/fanservice in otherwise serious shows, extremely high-pitched voices, MC is a perv and in some cases unjustified strength.    Might add in more later, mind is a little clogged atm.    Other than that I finished rewatching the last 5 episodes of SKET Dance and this time around actually decided to try out the Manga and it's just as great. Really hope they adapt the last ~120 Chapters some time in the future.  Finished Yozakura Quartet: Hana no Uta just about an hour or so ago.

Makishima breaks this, because he follows a well-reasoned, intellectual, philosophical code, there's one episode which really shows this level of ""honour"" Spoils, because that's what he believes.  A lot of people therefore (and understandably so) put him in the well-intentioned extremist category, but he doesn't belong there, because he's doing this for himself. He makes no excuses for his actions like WIEs do, his actions aren't a compromise to his beliefs or a lesser of two evils or a gambit or a crossing the moral event horizon or any those.

Animesuggest,3d50pr,engalleons,3,Tue Jul 14 08:08:04 2015 UTC,"Re: characters  My favorites list  I tend to prefer strong women.  That strength can be physical, mental, emotional, based in sheer willpower, or some combination of the four, but in any case they draw on that strength to see their convictions and goals through as far as they can.  Moreover, they generally don't need to rely on others in the beginning to have the opportunity to develop their strength - instead, they discover and employ it on their own as needed."

Animesuggest,3d50pr,RozenMaidenFanClub,2,Thu Jul 16 18:58:31 2015 UTC,"Some of my favorite characters (Possible Spoilers):  Accelerator: Toaru Majutsu no Index - There's just something about him that I really like. He starts off as a villain, a total psycho, but over the course of the story arcs he becomes more of a good guy/anti-hero. I like it when evil characters turn somewhat good. Also, he has an awesome power, vector manipulation. He and Last Order are adorable together!  Souseiseki: Rozen Maiden -  Another character I really like. She is the more serious and down-to-earth of the twins, with Suiseiseki the more 'childish' twin. I like her no-nonsense attitude and her tomboyish-ness! Also, the love the twins have for each other is admirable.   Misaki Shokuhou: Toaru Kagaku no Railgun S - She barely appears in the anime, only showing up in the first and last episodes. I immediately liked her and was hoping for more of the character, but, it wasn't to be. Again, it's her attitude which won me over. I'm guessing she is more prevalent in the light novels, which I've yet to read. Best girl!"

Characters I love: Dekomori, blonde undine girls who say ""ara ara"" a lot, various incarnations of ""2D Only-kun"", teacher-chan's, ditzy monster girls, slutty man-chasers/Momo Deviluke's, yakuza mermaids, and Robert E.

I think the best example of vital, annoying characters is the girl from Ichigo Mashimaro (a show very similar to Non Non Biyori, I like it just a bit more than NNB. Imagine if Renge were more of a prankster and all 4 girls were the same age)  I also liked the relationship between Deko and Mori, regardless of how tsundere it was lol. (Chu 1 & 2 spoilers)"

A sentence I never even imagined saying until now, gonna give it another episode, but I think i'll probably drop this one. Overlord - Really didn't like the first episode of this, weird ecchi moment and soooooo much exposition dropped via internal monologue. Again, I give almost everything two episodes, but this is looking like a drop. Bikini Warriors - A small part of me hoped this series would be dark, gritty and played dead serious just to fuck with me. It wasn't, 99% chance of dropping after next episode. Danchigai - hmmmm this could turn into a lovely, cute SoL series or another shitty siscon series, still not clear which after the first episode.  Prison School - I wasn't expecting much, it's my experience that recommendations starting ""It's ecchi, but ..."", don't go well. I was wrong, very funny first episode, interesting art and design choices, Dominatrix ecchi >> Monster Girl ecchi. Looks like this could be a good series, ecchi's often fumble, but based on first episode alone I'm predicting an 8/10. Teekyu 5 - Love that OP, more Teekyu goodness. Non Non Biyori S2 - looks like this season might run concurrently with the first, hope that's not the case I don't like that type of ""sequel"", still, damn good episode though. Predicting 9/10 if that's just the first episode, 8/10 if they all or most of them run concurrently with the first season   Second Episode mentions:   Gangsta - They seem to be going for an episodic format with an overarch, would have prefered a Black Lagoon like format personally. Also considering how much they talked about Spoilers I feel like I still know barely anything, maybe not quite enough exposition. On track for an 8/10. Shimoneta: Adversely to Gangsta, changing my prediction to 8/10 with possibility of 9/10, strong follow-up episode. The series is playing to it's strengths, I can't quite put into words what's so good about this series, but I think it may be the characters. Wakako-zake: Dropped, just not appealing to me, interesting art/design choice for the main gal, but other than that this is a pretty boring ""food and drink"" recommendation show.   Other series:    Watched all of Yami Shibai, a bit hit and miss, but some of those episodes were really fucking creepy."

If it follows the source material, the currently-airing Overlord will fit in the niche too.  If you're willing to try something a little different,  Song of Saya (Visual Novel)   Trailer: Fan-dub trailer What it’s about: The fact that Fuminori survived the accident was a miracle. To expect him to come out unscathed was too much to ask. He awakens with a bizarre form of agnosia that distorts his perceptions of the world around him into a Lovecraftian hellscape - his friends are writhing fleshy monsters, his food a disgusting mess of gore and filth. Determined to hide his condition for fear of being condemned to an asylum, he contemplates suicide until a young girl, angelic in contrast to the putrid meat-corridors of the hospital, appears by his bed and introduces herself as Saya. Why you should try it: If you've never tried a Visual Novel before, this is a great place to start. Written by the acclaimed Gen Urobuchi, the story takes about the same time to complete as a one-cour anime, and is unusually linear - prompting you for only one real decision on how you believe the story deserves to end. Saya no Uta is a story of horror and devotion, of love and monsters both human and otherwise. For all that ""tentacle monsters"" are a big part of the Western perception of Japanese media, there is a surprising lack of true Lovecraftian horror. Saya no Uta takes up that slack, and weaves into it threads of isolation, sinister desperation and a romance that is both beautiful and horrifying. Finally, the soundtrack is fantastic – I don’t think Shoes of Glass is ever going to come off of my playlist. Caveats: If you are the type of person who requires trigger warnings on the media you consume, steer well clear. Saya no Uta contains murder, rape, cannibalism, slavery, sadism and body horror. It also features H-scenes (porn) with an under-age girl. If you're not squeamish, or if you're a fan of Gen Urobuchi's other works (Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero, Phantom: Requiem), you really should give this a try, though. Themes: The philosophy of aesthetics, and how our senses define us, from our morality - why is it alright to poison cockroaches but not puppies?  - all the way to our sense of identity. The question of which option is the true end of the story is left up to the audience, and it's a tough one to solve. Similar works: Within anime, I'm going to have to say Pupa, but it's a terrible show and you shouldn't watch it. Outside, try the works of H.P. Lovecraft."

If Fuminori doesn't count as a villain protagonist, then I doubt anyone could. Even Light Yagami had his reasons. From any possible human perspective, the pair are evil in both mind and deed.

Animesuggest,3d5zil,Chode_E_Queeford,5,Mon Jul 13 20:15:34 2015 UTC,"Kara no Kyoukai - written by the same person as the original Fate/stay night (not Fate Zero). By the by, have you seen or read Fate/stay night? Slower than both, but that isn't really a criticism. The main characters are a lot more earthbound than those of the Fate series.  Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - like Psycho Pass, but a bit more ""mature."" I hate saying that because it sounds snobbish, but Psycho Pass tends to give you stuff in a more conventional contemporary way, but SAL makes you think about things for yourself a little bit more.  Berserk - has probably one of the best characters of all time of any medium: Griffith. The end is fairly inconclusive if you don't want to read the manga, but I only watched the anime and it was fine. Naturally, more dated animation than my other suggestions.  Madoka Magica - written by the same person as Psycho Pass and Fate Zero, and featuring what is probably Shaft studio's more imaginative animation ever in its surreal fight scenes. It ticks pretty much all of your boxes except perhaps character development for the main character. That kind of serves a purpose, however, and it has other great characters as well. Now and Then, Here and There - one of my favourite anime ever. A young boy is transported to some ""other"" world which is governed by a military dictatorship. Takes a while to pick up, but when it does it's one of the most emotionally intense anime I've ever watched. Kill la Kill - the fun thing you watch after all the depressing recommendations I've given you ;). Fantastically hectic comedy and action, gorgeous and coarse art-style, amazing plot and characters. A fun approach to the dystopia genre, if that makes sense. The ""fanservice"" is not what it seems; around 3 episodes in it's explained a little, and after that point I was really able to appreciate the anime a lot more.       Since /u/Chode_E_Queeford mentioned it and I agree, Shinsekai Yori - a group of six children become disillusioned with their utopian society when one of their friends disappears. The kind of anime which is a lot better a week after it's finished when you've thought about it enough, if you like that sort of thing. Doesn't really tick the ""crisp animation"" nor ""great character development"" (it was alright) boxes but it's still a good anime.   Can't write a paragraph on NGE though because I ain't seen it."

Animesuggest,3d5zil,shunkwugga,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:38:58 2015 UTC,"Attack on Titan or Knights of Sidonia. Both are on Netflix, looking at that short list it seems you have an account so shouldn't be too hard to watch.   Attack on Titan is about humanity's struggle within a walled city against an insurmountable threat known as the Titans which lurk just outside the wall, giant humanoid monstrosities that seemingly only live to eat people. The story centers around Eren Jaeger, a young member of the Survey Corps whose job it is to venture outside the walls and try to settle the area so humanity can reclaim the lost ground. Lots of political intrigue as things go on and trying to solve the mystery of the Titans, which ends up complicating things and shedding new light on humanity's relationship with them.   This is going to sound very familiar:  Knights of Sidonia is about humanity's struggle within a massive ""seed ship"" called the Sidonia against the Gauna, a mysterious alien race whose only purpose is to seemingly consume humans, that came one day and destroyed earth, forcing humanity to race to the stars and find a new planet to call home. Sidonia is the only known seed ship to still exist, as communications have been lost with the others since they left the solar system. The story centers around Nagate Tanikaze, a newly enlisted Garde pilot who is a prodigy with the Gardes despite having been raised in secret tunnels deep within the ship.   The two series are incredibly similar: main character is a young prodigy at fighting whatever unknowable threat is facing the last bastion of civilization, and said threat hasn't actually been imminent for a very long time before the start of the series. Attack on Titan starts with the breaching of one of the walls letting Titans invade humanity's walled city, and Sidonia starts off with a routine mining team discovering a Gauna after 100 years of silence and being nearly wiped out by it. However, there are clear differences.   Attack on Titan focuses much more on the political side of the conflict with character focus only really on what their plans against the Titans are. It's very fatalistic, with character bonds mostly being friendships and never progressing beyond that or if they do, those relationships are never explored. The show mainly focuses on the fight between the humans and the Titans.   Knights of Sidonia, on the other hand, is much more driven by character interaction and relationships. There are some light fanservice and harem elements during the slower parts of the show, but thematically it's very similar to Attack on Titan in that the primary focus is on the struggle between humanity and the Gauna. While Attack on Titan focuses on political intrigue, Sidonia focuses more on military technology. Humanity in Attack on Titan already has basically perfected anti-Titan countermeasures with few exceptions. In Knights of Sidonia, the enemy is constantly evolving so there's more of an arms race element in the show.   If you want to compare them to live-action shows: Attack on Titan:The Walking Dead::Knights of Sidonia:Battlestar Galactica reboot.  My personal vote for the two (if you have to choose one) goes to Knights of Sidonia. This is mostly due to an issue of pacing. Attack on Titan is slow. Like, ""nothing happens for the first 5 episodes after the pilot"" slow. Sidonia has ""breather"" episodes, but for the most part the action is much more condensed and easier to digest than the long drawn-out chapters that take place in Attack on Titan. Also, Attack on Titan has people zipping around on grapple hooks. Knights of Sidonia has giant robots."

The whole thing was a mess imo, I liked the first three episodes of S1, then it quickly became ""That Highschooler is the only one who can beat them and he does it with pseudoscientific bullshit."" Why actual scientists don't get it done? No one will ever know.  At least the ending of S1 had an Impact, one that made you think earth was fucked and Mars would crush them easily, but they had to go and feature the bee gees in the very first episode of S2 and give Inaho TWO convenient plot devices, to make him even more OP.   At that point I was actively rooting for Slaine and well you know how that turned out.  Oh and to actually address your points, truth be told I don't know either. It's pretty much the ending of what could have been and doesn't really satisfy anyone, except people who rooted for the status quo."

Not that that reason makes particular sense of course. As the only source of Aldnoah (as far as the clans know anyway) it's pretty much her way or the highway. Even if they tried to keep fighting with just the machines they had active those aren't going to last for long. They were activated by the emperor and his health is fading pretty quick.

Animesuggest,3d3ot1,sandwichsaregood,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:31:30 2015 UTC,"I didn't find it quite so frustrating, but there are a lot of factors which make her marriage understandable. They could have told it from another angle, but I can appreciate the decision to end the series in a way that departed from expectation.   third is, by what is said in my previous points, after Asseylum declared herself as ""Empress"" of the empire, she pretty much hold the absolute power and authority without the need of declaring she is making Klancain as her husband. as she could just tell them to stop or better yet also declare the nullification of her marriage declaration with Slaine as this pretty much tell the lost of support by the empire to Slaine's expedition   She had absolute rank, yes, but not really power. Slaine's meteoric rise had many of the orbital knights swayed to his side. There were a signficant portion that wanted nothing more than to subjugate earth completely, and a minority swayed to join out of want to not be considered an enemy.  Klancaid was a sort of leader of those who were abstaining from Slaine's faction, from my understanding. The circumstances surrounding Slaine's ultimate downfall aren't to be taken separately, but as a whole. In one fell swoop, much of his military might is destroyed. Immediately afterwords, Asseylum decrees that she has taken the throne as emperess, and then proceeds to acknowledge Klancaid's faction by declaring him her husband. Further, she declares an end to hostilities with Earth.  This leaves those orbital knights who would remain loyal to Slaine's cause branded as traitors facing the unexpended might of the abstaining orbital knights should they continue. Were there other ways Asseylum might have acomplished this? Perhaps. On the other hand, we know nothing of Vers politics. Perhaps she needed to take Klancaid as her husband in order to wield any power of the throne."

Animesuggest,3d3up6,Slaxophone,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:27:38 2015 UTC,"It's been a long time since I've watched it, so don't recall clearly. When in human form, they can speak normally.

The earlier episodes used to be very low definition, but have recently been remastered (season 1-3, episode 1-206), and can be watched on Crunchyroll if you have Premium. If you start watching somewhere, have it be the beginning. If you only want to watch a series of a certain length, so be it, but you'll probably get hooked and will watch everything because you got addicted."

Animesuggest,3d3up6,CpCdouchebag,2,Mon Jul 13 16:25:22 2015 UTC,"Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is this concept to a tee. I would say part 3 (seasons 2 and 3) fits this the most even though the entire series fits the formula quite well. A summary of all 8 parts manga and anime that I wrote can be found here.      Part 3 follows the journey of a deinquent son, Jotaro Kujo, and his journey to defeat DIO an immortal vampire who's actions and minions have tormented the Joestar bloodline for over 100 years). Jotaro along with his Grandfather Joseph Joestar, and friends Avdol, Polnareff, Kakyoin, and Iggy he meets on the way, must travel to Egypt from Japan to defeat DIO.  Each of the protagonists and villains also have these abilities called stands. These stands are manifestations of a persons willpower and have differing abilities and appearance. The video game series Persona was based upon this same concept.   As you asked for there is lots of traveling (though most of it's through dessert) and characters come and go. (expect to cry).  I would suggest starting with season one. It covers DIO's backstory, as well as Joseph's backstory, and overall makes Part 3 a better experience. If you like those then there's a ton of manga that has yet to be adapted over the 28 years Jojo has been around. The anime is very faithful so picking it up from part 4 can be done relatively easily. And the entire series has been done officially in color, so when the translation team gets finished you can enjoy a full color manga experience."

It stars with Phantom Blood (the first 9 episodes of season 1), then goes to Battle Tendency for the next 17 episodes. Then it's season 2 and 3 for Stardust Crusaders. It's not too hard.

Over a century ago, civilisation was destroyed by a species of Lovecraftian abominations known as the Gauna. The only survivors are crowded onto a single colony ship travelling through the void. Short on resources, they've nevertheless survived in isolation for over a hundred years, mining asteroids and maintaining constant combat readiness, just in case. Many sacrifices and adaptations have had to be made, but the people are safe and secure. Until, one day, the Gauna return. Why you should watch it: It's a great mecha show, and does a good job of balancing exposition and world building against more conventional action scenes. The show manages to maintain a high state of narrative tension without dragging things out; overall a fantastic translation of the original manga. It helps that it has an excellent soundtrack and sound design behind all of the action taking place on screen. Caveats: The animation is largely computer generated. For the backdrops and action set-pieces it works really well, but the characters’ faces end up looking alien and mask-like. It gets better as the series goes on, but it’s pretty jarring at the start Similar works: The show is essentially a blending of Attack on Titan and Battlestar Galactica, with mecha space-battles thrown for good measure."

It's a comedy with some lewdness because Onizuka is a perv. The World God Only Knows. It is about a nerd who chooses to reject the real world because it is flawed and spends his time playing dating sims. He is known as the 'God of Conquest' because of his skills, and one day gets contracted by the underworld to assist them in capturing runaway spirits who are hiding in the hearts of young girls.

I've only seen season 1 but there's hardly any mind games, mostly just Inoho figuring shit out emotionlessly because the plot deems it convenient.  NGNL sure, but it's a very fan servicey goofy mind game anime. So keep that in mind.

Animesuggest,3d1s6i,NoMercyOracle,3,Sun Jul 12 22:02:07 2015 UTC,"I'll start of by suggesting 5 Centimeters Per Second, which is a beautifully animated movie, which you could watch just for the animation (even though the character design was lacking). The anime, unlike many other romances fail to be realistic. 5 cm/second is out of the norm because it's highly realistic and has an amazing animation. The movie is slow paced at just over an hour long so it should be a great watch on a lazy night. Here's the trailer for a quick preview.   This one is my favourite anime out of these four anime I'm suggesting to you: White Album 2. Before you get confused - ""is that a second season?"" No White Album and White Album 2 are different anime. Confusing right? White Album is pretty bad and boring so just stay away from it. Anyway, take note that this anime is highly dramatic so fasten your seat belts and more importantly your heart. At first the anime felt like a cute romance drama but as it progressed it just got more and more intense leaving me speechless. WA2 is very realistic, serious, and filled with jealousy.  Next I would say Kokoro Connect. Although it's an anime with highschool kids it's not set too much at highschool (other than their clubroom). The group of friends have to tackle a new found power amongst themselves, learning things that weren't meant to be known about. It either breaks or brings the friend closer but you'll have to watch it too find out for yourself ;). The show gives a bit of a roller coaster ride like feeling as the mood gets from funny to serious easily.  My final suggestion for you would be Garden of Words. It's another movie by the same producers of 5 cm/second at 45 minutes and has even better animation because it's made 6 years later (2013 now). It's not too out of the norm expect for its animation, but anytime I suggest 5 cm/second I fell obligated to suggest this. Anyway, here's the trailer."

It aims to turn anime tropes on their head so if you haven't seen any, you aren't going to enjoy it fully, IMO. It is a really great series though.   If you just want something with similar ""artstyle"" I wouldnt say it too different from the norm. You might be used to seeing undetailed and bland art styles used in DBZ, Naruto, etc.   I'd recommend an anime film like Redline if you want something with vibrant colors and interesting designs along with exaggerated animation not dissimilar to ME!ME!ME!."

Like the Oculus, except directly into your head. And the premise is they get trapped inside the VRMMORPG of the same title. If you die in the game, you die in real life. And so its the story of them trying to beat the deathgame to escape. It gets a lot of hate among critics for certain aspects of the story, but among casual watchers its very popular and explores a lot of different genres over the series which makes it a great gateway anime."

It's qualities are too many to list, but I'll give it a shot. It's a great supernatural series with a consistent world that feels larger than just what we're allowed to see in the course of the series. It has a mystery that's great the first and second time through. It addresses subjects from growing up, to how one shares love, to what it is to be human. It starts slow, but there's a lot to love in its ever hastening movement toward one of the most interesting conclusions I've seen in the medium. I love this series.

It's chiefly a drama about characters having to reconcile everything they once understood with new information and perspectives, and about how they find, or manufacture, what little ""good"" can exist in a situation in which no one else can tell them what is right or wrong. It deals with some heavy topics. That doesn't mean it doesn't have it's moments of fun and action and adventure, but, yeah, it isn't a feel-good type show.   P.S. If you're looking for a really great show that is a feel-good comedy, maybe try season two of Working!!. You seemed to like the first season well enough and I think the series only gets better from there. As a bonus, season 3 just started so you can watch it along with the rest of us if you catch up.

It's a good show, just not as good as the others in my first post.  OreImo - A bit controversial which is why I didn't recommend it earlier, but I enjoyed it a lot. The romance is mainly in the second season.  Noucome - Similar to Haganai and Is This A Zombie when it comes to romance, but it's even less developed than those.  Ouran Koukou Host Club - Has some romantic scenes especially in the later half, but it's not a focus.  The Pet-Girl of Sakurasou - Has romantic elements through-out the show, probably shouldve recommended this in my earlier post.  The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya - Has a few romantic elements, it's mostly subtle or in the background though. The movie is fantastic.  Working!! - There's certain characters who have crushes on others, but progression is incredibly slow.  OreGairu - The romance is building up most of the time, and for good reason. So don't expect much progression in that aspect.  Yamada-kun and the 7 Witches - Romance is a big focus, lots of kissing(there's a reason for that). Personally, I loved it at first but then it got a bit rushed. Still, it's conclusive."

Animesuggest,3d218b,wardaniel9,3,Sun Jul 12 22:59:56 2015 UTC,"I'm going to say what essentially every person who's watched Steins Gate says to those who haven't - the first episodes are a bad gauge on the show overall. They are meant to lay down the building blocks of what is to come later. You won't find a lot of exciting things happening until you are already at the midpoint, but once you're there it increases in intensity exponentially from there on out. It's completely understandable how someone can get easily bored with the beginning; a lot of people drop the show early on because of it. It definitely redeems itself if you decide to stick with it all the way through."

""far from it, I am hououin kyouma""  from then on I could stop watching... I guess if you don't like Houoin from the start your not gonna ever like him... but in term of comedy like I said I think its underestimated... :P...   also in term of pure comedy try D-frag (dub).."

Madoka Magica is tailor made to make you cry. Kokoro Connect is sad, but also very thrilling and involving, but I'm pretty sure I got choked up a few times. 5 cm/s is pretty depressing, but I think it draws from personal experience, so unless youve been in a situation where you were ""2 ppl in love who cant be together"" then idk how much itll affect you. Steins;Gate is incredible, and absolutely twisted for what it does to a certain character T.T - FMAB is a shounen, so unless 64 episodes of action is something you want, there's better ways to make you cry.

Hunter x Hunter(2011) (Not the 1990 version, it's an older version of the same show)   It does kind of fit in some of the arcs. Though, here the MCs isn't OP, but strong depending on where you are in the series. The focus you as for is not exactly there, but in the beginning there is a competition to become a Hunter where you'll see how strong people are compared to others. There's also an arc a bit later with floors which you win matches, and the higher you go the stronger opponents.   The focus is though not always on the strongest, but on smart play and techniques, and teamwork. Even when against opponents that are much stronger, there is other ways to win than overpowering the enemy, by fighting smart.   Also like Mahouka, there is talk about the fights and the system of power. (There is super powers, you'll see a bit into the anime) There is often a narrator during the fights, but the characters also discuss the fights and how things are.   It may fit a bit, and i did my best to describe without any spoilers. You should check it out, and i'll of course answer any questions if you are unsure.    Edit: Also highly recommend getting a MAL, both for you to keep track when you rack up a big amount of shows and for us making recommendations, since we know what you have watched and what you prefer.

I was busting up laughing in so many places. The pacing is just really abrupt and leads to a lot of unintentionally humorous situations to me. Aside from that, I liked the story. I was pretty enamored with one character who wasn't in the movie much, but it looks like he's in the anime a lot more. The anime seems like it goes way more in depth so I am definitely going to finish it. I watched the first episode last night. I would say the art style, for me at least, was hard to get past (dead eyes and weird lips) but it seems like it's good otherwise. I've only heard great things about it. I'm kind of sad I watched the movie first, as I take it to be a tl;dr version of the story, so now things are spoiled for me without anything having gone into too much depth. But oh well. Maybe start with the manga or anime first for this reason.  edit: now I'm 17 episodes in. It just made me cry ;-; this show is actually really, really good.

Is this a Zombie? one of my favorite shows in general and very funny also classic Ecchi. Punchline:  Is a show that came out recently and if you have a drinking game related to girls underwear then good luck trying to not die. The Testament of Sister New Devil:  Its just Ecchi and the uncensored is actually hentai not even borderline it IS HENTAI!! and this is supposed to be a tv show.  The censored version literally blocks like the entire scene in some episodes so good luck. Sekirei:  Yea I mean two seasons of a pretty garbage anime but it is Ecchi so its got that going for it. Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou:  Ok anime with Ecchi and this one wasn't as bad as the ones above it if I remember correctly but thats probably why it was an ok anime instead of garbage. Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?:  I mean this isn't an Ecchi show but there is one character who everytime they are on screen their boobs are like right there and they are on screen alot. Absolute Duo:  It is Ecchi but Its been a while so I dont remember that much about it but it is Ecchi. Trinity Seven:  pretty much same answer as Absolute Duo. Isuca:  Really strange show but it is Ecchi. Rosario to Vampire:  Wow I forgot Rosario to Vampire funny show and ecchi.  It doesn't actually have that much Ecchi but it is a harem anime so you know what you are getting into. Sora no Otoshimono:  I'm putting this here but I'm guessing you know it.     Jeez I am pathetic.  I didn't watch these for a drinking game but because I like the comedy.  Does that make me a sad person?  The worst part is I'm still searching for more Ecchi stuff.  Hope this helped!  Here's My anime list if you want to find anything.  http://myanimelist.net/profile/Nazerack  Edit:  Forgot an amazing show that is airing right now sorry you can't marathon it for the drinking game but   Prison School:  Is amazing its up there with the best Ecchi Comedies.

The MC is deathly afraid of women and has to deal with a bunch of girls who, well you know.. are from a planet with only women and want to  ravage him  Kono Naka ni Hitori - equally as bad, but I actually watched it recently so I remember this much... it's about on-par with ToLOVE-Ru in sheer number of tit flashes and seduction scenes, and since the plot is ""one of them is secretly my long lost little sister who wants to marry me"" you guys can do a beer bong or something for every plot twist/reveal too"

Animesuggest,3cyi2m,GeeJo,3,Sun Jul 12 06:30:14 2015 UTC,"Elfen Lied:   Trailer: Official. What it's about: A subspecies of humans have begun to appear in isolated pockets around the globe. Distinguished by a pair of cranial nodes granting them immense telekinetic powers, they display an apparently universal tendency towards sociopathy and violence. For the safety of the public, their very existence is a closely-guarded secret and any specimens discovered ""in the wild"" are brought in to be studied in heavily fortified laboratories.  One day, something goes wrong with the base security, and one of these ""Diclonii"" escapes back into society. Why watch it: Elfen Lied is infamous for its incredibly high level of violence, and it lives up to its reputation in every regard. The story is both dark and compelling, and you truly get a sense that no character is safe. The mystery surrounding the main character is teased out masterfully, balanced with a decent dose of action scenes and funny character moments, and overlaid with a haunting soundtrack. Caveats: The series has a weird approach to narrative tension. It's essentially ""all or nothing"", transitioning straight from brutal action scenes to domestic humour and then back again. It's also slightly forgetful, spending a lot of time introducing characters that have little actual impact on the story or presenting plot twists that are then never built or expanded upon. Finally, a moderate tolerance for moeblobs is recommended.  Theme(s): Nature vs Nurture. The various ways that people deal (or fail to deal) with emotional trauma. Similar works: If you're looking for something of a similar violence level, Deadman Wonderland and Hellsing Ultimate are probably your best bets. Story-wise, Brynhildr in the Darkness and Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom offer the closest parallels.     Deadman Wonderland   Trailer: English Dubbed version What it’s about: The police arrive at a school to find a classroom full of dead children, with only one survivor – a young boy named Ganta. The evidence of his guilt is overwhelming, despite his protestations of innocence, and the verdict is both swift and decisive. Death. The sentence is to be carried out at Japan's only private prison, Deadman Wonderland, where inmates must participate in death games for the amusement of tourists. Why you should watch it: This is an action show through and through. It pulls no punches, with deaths, fights and assorted ultraviolence in nearly every single episode. The conflicts and threats that Ganta faces are continually ramped up, and every time he begins to get a handle on his current situation, a new wrench is thrown into the works. The characters are entertaining in their insanity (and Shiro is adorable), and there’s a mystery to be solved under the surface of the story, but it’s the fight choreography and the fluid animation of the action scenes that are the major draws for the show.  Caveats: This is not a show you should try and watch with a 480px pirated stream; there are a lot of dark scenes - not thematically speaking (though that's true too) - but in a literal sense of having the screen mostly black. Watching it on BluRay helps with the contrast but, annoyingly, there doesn’t seem to be a single release without some degree of gore censorship. Finally, the series ends quite abruptly. While it settles all of the immediate conflicts, it feels a lot like the first half of a story than a solid conclusion. But there’s always the manga to turn to if you want more. Themes: Typical shounen fare with the power of perseverance and friendship Similar works: Mirai Nikki, Elfen Lied. Outside of anime, The Hunger Games"

I find that Devil May Cry is much more similar to the original Hellsing, but maybe I need to rewatch both after I'm done with this round of Hellsing Ultimate.  Parasyte has a couple dark-ish moments and has plenty of kickass fights in it.  I don't think it's in the Tokyo Ghoul league of blood, but the story is astounding.  Also, I couldn't help but stalk your list and notice you haven't seen the Steins;Gate movie yet - definitely check it out!

Highly enjoyable, but again it's more of a fun romantic slice of life in high school than a true romance anime.  Kimi ga nozomu eien - More grounded and somewhat realistic take on the love triangle situation. Starts in highschool but after a few episodes does a time skip, then the series revolves around how much the main cast has changed in that time, and to rediscover what has led them to that change.   Kimi ni todoke - Heartwarming tale of a socialy akward girl with no friends and her quest to find friendship and love. I cannot recommend this series enough, the main character is not your typical shoujou heroine and it has some truly heartwarming moments that I just couldn't help to shed a tear.  Kaichou wa Maid-sama! - A more standard fare, tsundere romance. However, I find the humour spot on and I really enjoyed the comedic tone of the series.

FLCL - 9 - Full of cartoony slapstick, parodies, and references, it's a fast paced sketch comedy with a lighthearted tone and is just a ton of fun. However, I think the show is less impressive as a pure comedy than as the intricate and unique coming of age story it is. In my opinion, the dub is really good, and you may want to watch that, but you can't go wrong either way.  Golden Boy - 10 - A short, memorable episodic harem comedy done extremely well. Very well animated, with plenty of adult jokes and visual gags. The story is surprisingly great, in a way you wouldn't expect given its subject matter. It pretty much had me laughing out loud at all times. It's similar to Bakemonogatari, but in a louder kind of way, not that that's a bad thing.  Samurai Chomploo - 8 - A largely episodic adventure series with a great cast of characters. Lots of dark comedy, visual gags, and character humor. Just plain likable.

The main character is actually kinda likeable, feeling like a normal otaku you could talk to on the street rather than the dakimakura-as-a-waifu freaks we're used to seeing.

Here's a few possible things that can happen:   There might be politics involved, especially (Episode 2). Ecchi and even possibly harem are likely  It might be possible combat between big armies will start to become rare, especially when it can be a one sided massacre. I expect more combat between smaller groups of soldiers, such as the MC's unit.    All in all, I don't think the anime will be as militaristic as it first seems. This anime has a lot of potential to be great and unique, but it also has potential to be a failure. It's hard (atleast for me) to judge how good or bad the anime will be this early."

The bad thing: The characters (at least the main one) is super shitty. I dont get how you could write a character that doesnt even feel ANY emotions whatsoever and even drags the whole tension into a fucking weeaboo joke.

Animesuggest,3cy2f8,loco1876,2,Sun Jul 12 01:32:52 2015 UTC,"I really enjoy the read for having a somewhat unusual main character and the somewhat unusual mix of military fetish and fantasy fetish, somewhat similar to various Harry Turtledove novels/Eric Flint historical fantasy novels.  The main character is similar to Captain Justy Ueki Tylor, posited as a happy-go-lucky relatively insignificant man who is in the eye of the storm of world-changing events by virtue of a string of military and diplomatic successes on the frontlines, and because of his lackadaisical and non-ambitious attitude its intentionally ambiguous as to whether he's a highly-skilled genius or simply lucky. His own superiors are uncertain despite close observation for years; they're none too fond of his discipline but find it difficult to argue with repeated and remarkable success.  Whole chapters are devoted to this, particularly in that he's a veteran special forces member so you'd expect him to be highly competent, but...  However, its core appeal of modern man in fantasy world is running into trouble on the strategic front because of of feeling like Japan is a gigantic Mary Sue because of the lack of legitimate threat from the fantasy world denizens since a single battalion can apparently defeat the greatest military power in the fantasy world with minimal losses because the usual equalizer, magic, is no match for a gun, much less heavier armament.  On the smaller scale, the story is reasonably good at exploiting moral dissonance between the two worlds.  Its unclear how they can resolve this without resorting to them literally fighting multiple gods simultaneously which already feels untrue to the themes set up  or having other Earth-countries become involved, in which case it becomes skirmishing between colonial powers.  It feels like the author really wants to bring in other nations into the world as the fantasy world is considered to be an entire world of untapped natural resources (in particular, oil) and relatively unpopulated land which would make Japan the most powerful nation in the world if left unchecked.  However, they're are severely constricted as the Gate is basically located in Tokyo, leading to insurmountable supply route problems from other powers short of new Gates appearing in other countries.  Still, it's a lot of fun and has vast potential."

For some reason I was expecting another game anime and also the whole fact that the main character is an otaku.  But the fact that he's an otaku doesn't seem to be that bad.  Also what I really like about this show is it's big scope that it offered. It showed big battles. It also delves into the political choices from people on both sides. I really like how big the scope is, it's not an anime that just focuses on a small cast like SAO or Dungeon. It uses the cast to help see the big scope things.  Also the idea of an advanced military versus something a lot less technologically advanced is really interesting."

Animesuggest,3cvqtq,Anime-Summit,50,Sat Jul 11 14:52:26 2015 UTC,"One big thing to know about Toradora is that it kind of redefined what RomComs could be.  If you've seen modern post-toradora romcoms, then you've likely seen shows take it's elements and make them better (or even perfect them), but what Toradora did for romcoms as a whole is immense.  Romcoms were TERRIBLE before Toradora (I'm sure there is an exception or two) and it hit everything that you really need in a romcom.  And Taiga is honestly one of the best depictions of a Tsundere that exists in anime, outside of maybe Asuka Souryou (Shikanami) Langley in Evangelion.  One thing about Ryuji though is that he is seeing that softer, helpless side of Taiga pretty early on, and combining that with his issue of having a scary face making people not like him, he sympathizes a bit with Taiga.  It also doesn't hurt that she is Minorin's best friend, and Ryuji is all about them Genki Girls.  The relationship starts like that, but it quickly becomes Ryuji helping Taiga in a world that has failed her. At times this can almost be like protecting a pet from the outside world.   Taiga is weak beneath the Tsun, not just soft. She's defenseless and been hurt far too many times to trust.  Ryuji, on the other hand, has practically grown up taking care of his mother, who is an oddly successful ""buy me drink me"" girl at a club (totally a milf) who has kind of tried to shirk off parental duties after Ryuji's badass of a father died (he died right? not just ran off?)  So Ryuji has been taking care of his adult (and mostly not incapable) mother, and Taiga is in need of some assistance.  These things combine into some well done characters behaving very naturally.  Out of all Anime MCs, Ryuji isn't dense, or unwitting. He's sympathetic, but he also doesn't let Taiga get away with all of the shit she tries to pull.  As another commenter pointed out. These are character flaws in them. Not things that are just there cause ""haha isn't it funny?"""
Animesuggest,3cvqtq,aliveatnight,12,Sat Jul 11 07:24:31 2015 UTC,"I want to back up this comment. Their relationship is based on understanding, and despite Ryuji taking care of her, he also knows how to stand up to her and not be pushed around.  Not only that, but by the end of the shows, the characters (especially Taiga) have all undergone their own personal growth and become better people. That's a huge part of the reason that I enjoy it too."
Animesuggest,3cvqtq,shadowspark2,3,Sat Jul 11 12:09:24 2015 UTC,"To build on top of this comment, the anime really understands what ""love"" is. The show doesn't obsess over trying to get the main character together with his crush, but instead focuses on developing the characters, which, by proxy, develops their relationships and has them fall in love. Nothing about the relationships feels forced or unimaginable, and that's what's best about Toradora. Nothing feels fake, which is hard to do through a medium like anime.   Worst part of Toradora is that it's hard to find anime that are as good as it. Definitely a great show, and you'll probably like Taiga more as it goes on. She might be harsh, but it just makes the contrast with her more vulnerable moments even greater."

Also, taiga isn't really that violent, once we account for the exaggerated violence to be...just that, exaggerated.  Taiga had a bad attitude and it made people have a bad impression of her. Over time she started to become what people thought of her. They viewed her as someone who would be quick to aggression, so she became that to make things easier on her.  She's not a good tsundere because of the violence though. That doesn't even register on the radar.  She's a good depiction of a tsundere because she has her reasons for wanting to be closed off actually shown as part of the ongoing story, as opposed to a loose idea from the past.  She doesn't needlessly flip back and forth with the nonsense ""well, it's not because I like you, baka"". She sticks to what she knows she feels. She gets softer when dealing with Kitamura because she has a childlike infatuation with him stemming from the fact he isn't so quick to judge her.  She isn't stuck in this horrible place where she denies herself (or at least the parts she understands of herself) ala Rin who still pretends to be uninterested after literally having sex with the guy she knows she likes.  Taiga is hard on the outside because it's what those around her have shown her she needs to be to get by, and getting past that is a long difficult process, not just a kind word that gets a blush and then backlash."

So, are you gonna argue against Rin from the anime or the VN? Because there was no sex in the anime at all as they used the Realta Nua script.  Either way you're still very much wrong as there is a clear difference between the level of affection she displays from the start up until she's with Shirou in London. What you falsely describe as ""flip flop"" is actually insincerity of expression, a trait she displays in her interactions with everyone but Saber.  The origin of her behaviour is well documented and developed from events of Fate/Zero and the subsequent tutor she was forced by circumstances to endure.  Despite all this as well as her vast potential for violence and displaying might, she contains herself and is a far more believable and pleasant person than Taiga ever is and she very well deserves her spot among the very few high-quality tsundere in anime/VN.  Taiga on the other hand is in fact the violent kind of tsundere: she hits the MC physically more than once, her interactions with side-characters often involve physical violence and one of the major scenes of the series outright displays the ferocity of her character because she simply cannot express herself and confront others without using brutal methods.   She might have her reasons for being closed off, childish and peckish.. but there's absolutely no excuse for the violence displayed which is a part of her character - something she is well known for throughout the school and is a part of the narrative.  tl;dr: bullshit"

Was a pretty great scene though. Probably the only one that is actually violent in the show.  And I explained in the last one why she is a little violent, which you then disregard as ""no reason."" She became violent because it's what people were projecting onto her.  It seems that, while you are saying people can only think she's a good tsundere because she's violent (so far from true), you're ACTUALLY saying she CAN'T be a good tsundere because she is violent, which may be even MORE shallow.  Yes, Rin is insincere, and that insincerity is the only thing providing her tsundere traits in the first place, and they're not very good. Tsundere isn't about being insincere. It's about having reasons to keep people out.  Also, Rin becoming more sincere over time is just a sign of good character development, and has nothing to do with her being a good tsundere.  As I've said, Rin is a good character. She's just not a good tsundere.

You downplay Taiga's violence using ""little violent"" and ""comedic effect"" but it makes no consequence. Slapstick comedy has nonstop violence from tsundere and it's equally annoying and of poor quality as the level of tsundere has very much to do with the subtlety, rationale and character depth she displays with being tsundere.  What does ""people were projecting onto her"" hold as value against ""family was brutally torn apart(in the way Rin's was) and was raised by a psychopath"" ?   Literally every character in Toradora! has expectations and people projecting things unto them yet none behave in such a crude fashion as Taiga which is a big reason why most people dislike her and are more fond of Ami and even Sumire who outright gives her a piece of her mind.  also, way to insist on non-existing sex-scenes from the ubw anime: ufotable bailed completely and deen slapped a cgi scene (even in BDs) and called it a day; not that it makes any difference, she's clearly not ""flip flop"" or insincere with Shirou post-war.

Her tsundere traits are watered down, and often inconsistent.  What seems to be the issue is that you are STUCK on this violence thing and incapable of seeing past it.  Yes, Taiga is violent. That has basically nothing at all to do with this discussion, as far as ""tsundere"" is concerned. That's a whole different character flaw.  Also, nice implying that Taiga's family wasn't also torn apart.  I'm honestly feeling like you watched 4 episodes of Toradora, didn't like Taiga because you prefer genki girls, and are now preaching about it. My evidence being that you basically ignore every story element in the show aside from her being violent.

Anyway, that has 0 to do with Rin and you're straight up brainlessly flaming.  There is no instance whatsoever you can claim Rin's tsundere trait is inconsistent.  Yes, the main issue is the ""violence thing"" as it was my primary complaint as to Taiga's quality as a tsundere. The fact the entiriety of her 'tsun' is just browbeating people makes her a very poor character. The fact that it's used as comedy only serves to highlight what a simple gimmicky type of tsundere she is.  Taiga's family being ""torn apart"" is a far cry from what happened to Rin and using the fact the story of Fate/ has supernatural elements is a poor argument due to the fact the tragedies, consequences and behaviours of characters are almost always consistent with real life: people suffer horribly both psychologically and physically. The MC himself is heavily affected while Rin kept herself in one piece.  You should've known most of the things I wrote about Fate/ so if you haven't paid attention or just didn't care enough to remember then don't bother arguing about things you have no clue about, let alone derail the original comment by going off on tangential topics.

Simply put, it's romcom done properly. And given how generic this genre is, that's pretty damn hard to find to be honest.  As for the relationship between Ryuji and Taiga... Ryuji is always trying to help Taiga because he's a nice guy deep down and she obviously needs help.

He has an obsession with cleaning that even extends to his school work, well and above what is expected or even noticed.

It felt like a long haul for me to but once things finally start to get near the end it is so worth it. I forced myself to watch it all the way through and its one of my top three anime ever now. I would suggest sticking it out."

Animesuggest,3cvqtq,fapbm,-1,Sat Jul 11 08:40:09 2015 UTC,"Some may call me a shallow twat, but I hated Taiga after she broke into fucking Ryuji's house, attacked him with a fucking wooden katana, stabbed a hole through his wall, and then ate his food. Now i don't know about any of you, but if some random girl broke into my house and started attacking me, I would knock her the fuck out and call the police, not take it like a little bitch and offer her tea.  As far as lead males go, Ryuji was okay I guess. He had some unique factors, such as being a clean freak, which actually made him somewhat likable.  The only other character who I gave a fuck about was Ami. She was exactly what I wanted her to be through the entire series, a massive cunt. That aside, she developed really well as a character throughout the series and as the 'story' progressed, she became more of a likable character.  I would rant for a paragraph about the half assed shitty ending, but i'll avoid spoilers for anyone who has read this far into my rant. All i'll say is that the ending seemed really forced and ""EHMERGERD SO TSUN TSUN"". Fuck it annoyed me so much.  TL;DR = Toradora is 4/10 due to its shitty lead girl with bad character progression and its only redeeming factors being the lead male and some of the side characters."

So from what I know, people like it because they treat it like the generic anime premise done really well.   Just looked up a review on youtube, here is the top result. Skipping to the end, or the ""final verdict"" he has, he even goes on to say that while it does have its flaws (one of which is an overreliance on Taiga) the show ends ""beautifully."" At the end of the day tho if you don't like Taiga I don't recommend forcing yourself."

I might recommend checking out the manga since you can get the important details much faster than watching 20 minute episodes, but can then jump right into the modern episodes or whichever arcs look interesting.   Unfortunately I'm not far enough info the anime to be able to say exactly where a recap episode might be, but I'm aware of at least one time jump that might hold a skip."
Animesuggest,3cy41t,DrShocker,2,Sat Jul 11 21:56:52 2015 UTC,"I love One Piece so forgive me if I'm a little bias. I would recommend starting at episode 229. It's the beginning of the Water 7 arc and gives you a good feel for the current crew's relationship, as well as a recap of their origin stories. (This is terrible if you have watched from the start as it drags but if you haven't seen them then it would be a good summary.)   You could then skip further ahead but IMO all the arcs from their (Thriller Bark, Sabaody, and Impel Down into War of the best) are amazing story lines and I doubt you would notice how many episodes you are watching. That's the best thing about OP once you're gripped by it, you're no longer intimidated about the amount of episodes but rather relieved that you have plenty of story ahead.  Alternatively, you could read through the One Piece Wiki and get summaries of the arcs and jump in when you want. But I would definitely recommend watching ""War of The Best"" as it is absolutely incredible."
Animesuggest,3cy41t,AntMan_42,2,Sat Jul 11 22:53:52 2015 UTC,I would read the manga till you feel comfortable enough to move into the anime. Reading a chapter takes 5-10minutes. One Piece is really all about the adventure and skipping part of it wouldnt be right. It might take you a while but it'll be worth it in the end
Animesuggest,3cy41t,Animeop,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:40:33 2015 UTC,"Try asking this question in the subreddit page /onepiece.  For some reason, the people who has answered so far hasn't seen it (or enough of it), or/and are judging it poorly based on what other mainstream animes are like.  Not saying these answers are bad, I'm saying they can be unreliable.  As for my answer, I would say you'd have no idea what the hell would be going on if you were to skip so much episode. The one piece universe is unique in a way that it is dynamically expanding. It is no linear like what you'd see in Naruto, nor does it follow a predictable cycle like one from Bleach. The character cast and plot is too huge to be able to skip.  The only valid suggestion is the one DrShocker made. Read the manga.  If you still insist in not doing so, the only other suggestion are youtube videos which attempt to summarize the whole anime. They're mostly ment for one piece viewers for nostalgia, but they can also give a quick summary of what happened within 700 episodes."

The main praise I always give it is that it is one of the only two shows I've seen where I had no idea who the MC would end up with. On top of that, I feel like this show strikes the perfect balance of slice of life/comedy and seriousness. There are only a handful of serious events, but they don't feel shoehorned in like with other harems.  Also going to second Kimi ga Nozomu Eien  (Rumbling Hearts). This one takes a couple episodes to get going, but once it does it goes hard. It was not until the last few minutes of the last episode that I had any idea at all who the MC would end up with, its even harder to predict than Shuffle. Its worth noting that this is very much a drama, not a rom com or generic harem, though it does have some comedic moments."
Animesuggest,3cwbgi,VolcanicWolf,2,Sat Jul 11 14:04:10 2015 UTC,"Rumbling Hearts definitely sounds like something I'd be interested in.

Animesuggest,3cwbgi,HughSurname,2,Sat Jul 11 19:22:11 2015 UTC,"I second Shuffle!  It's somewhat a pretty by-the-numbers harem anime with some fantasy twists here and there. Now, what it does well is that, because you can get whatever girl you choose in the original VN, the anime gives a balanced amount of time to each heroine, but it really makes a good job at keeping you guessing who's going to win the love of the MC.

Also, Golden Time...I don't feel falls under this category. All you have to do is watch the openings and endings...they could have been a least a LITTLE more subtle about it and actually have all the characters in the openings and endings but choose to feature just the two main characters. Poor choice IMO. (Also, if you didn't like the beginning of Golden Time, you probably won't like the rest much either. I just got done watching the whole thing and I never warmed up to it. I didn't have anything else to watch at the moment so I figured I'd give it a chance but kinda wish I hadn't.)  Here are my top picks for you: -Honey & Clover (& Honey & Clover 2): EXACTLY what you're looking for! <3 -Chihayafuru (& Chihayafuru 2....hoping they'll come out with more, if you want a finished anime that discloses who ends up together, you'll want to pass on this one for now.

Animesuggest,3cwm8r,longliveaffinity,3,Sat Jul 11 12:34:57 2015 UTC,"I'm back with another round.  Bartender is a very atomspheric show, somewhat similar to Mushishi, though I haven't finished.  Memories is a trilogy of short movies worth mentioning. The first, Magnetic Rose, is a real piece of art, and his a stunning sci-fi atmosphere, with bits of horror mixed in as it goes on. The other two films are weaker but are still worth watching.  Planetes is something else I feel is worth mentioning. Its main focus is not on atmosphere but on characters, but through that it is very comfortable during its SOL parts. It also nails the space aspects, making it times feel very peaceful but at others extremely stressful. It becomes almost oppressively stressful and dark as the series goes on though."
Animesuggest,3cwm8r,Who_is_Zander,3,Sat Jul 11 12:50:56 2015 UTC,"If you want an atmospheric anime & love cyberpunk, you should definitely check out Akira. It's perfect in every way for what you're asking. It's an animated film, about 2 hours.  It's not the high-tech-low-life kinda cyberpunk, but more of a ""post high tech but still low life"" thing. It's one of the best films in terms of visuals and atmosphere to this day.  Another film related to cyberpunk is Jin-Roh. It's more of a steampunk universe, but it's still something that cyberpunk fans would love. I haven't seen the dub, so I don't know if it's good, but it was a bit hard to follow with subs. Maybe you should consider that.  Phantom: Requiem for a Phantom is an insanely good series with great atmosphere. It has its slow moments, and some parts might seem weird if you're not used to anime in general (even though it's not heavy on fanservice at all). Just disregard 1 or 2 scenes as the director's cringe-venting. Still, I never regretted having watched it. It's about underground organisations, assassins, and personal drama. Set in the USA, too.  Regarding the colourful Beyond short, it's hard to think of something. All that comes to mind are romantic shows like AnoHana, but it's not about mystery - just character drama. A very good series, but perhaps not something you're looking for, nor one of the first anime one should watch - but that's debatable.  Finally, Death Note is an anime that's perhaps best suited to be called entry-level. It's very atmospheric, has solid plot, and interesting characters and premise. Some consider the second season to suck, but I liked both.    Others gave you other suggestions, so let me give you a few comments of my own. All of the shows that I will be discussing below are good - at least I do like them. I'll list their drawbacks to provide a second perspective.  The Ghost in the Shell movie can be a little low on action, but it's good food for thought. It depends on what's your thing. The second one is more of a Hollywood action movie, but it's absolutely gorgeous, and has some mindfuck. It's not the colourful japanese suburbia that you fell in love with, though. I cannot comment on the series (Standalone Complex), but AFAIK you're better off watching the movies first.   Cowboy Bebop's frequent criticism lies in the fact that it's rather episodic. Its usual mood is a more uplifting one, but it has its share of serious episodes, and the idea is a rather solid one.  Psycho Pass is also an anime which you may either love or hate. Its pacing is rather slow at the beginning, but it gets much better later on. It's the closest thing to Blade Runner you can get that I can think of."

For BladeRunner, Psycho Pass is definitely what you are looking for, as others have stated. Also the original Ghost in the Shell film is very atmospheric, not dissimilar to BladeRunner in that way.   As for that scene in The Animatrix, that was my favorite too :) so calm and peaceful and fun looking... Interesting camera work too. I'm not sure there's anything else quite like that, but Serial Experiments Lain at least captures the suburban setting combined with a haunting atmosphere and some definite Matrix-like elements. Opening for reference. Not exactly upbeat though, which might be more like FLCL. Paprika is another fantastic film that probably captures a similar atmosphere. Opening for reference. Lastly, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time might be something you would be interested in. Its a great film regardless, but it certainly has a lot of that peaceful suburban life element you are looking for, combined with a little sci-fi."

And, just as with School Days, the vast majority of people will rush forward to the infamous Sora route and glaze over the rest of the anime. That is a mistake.  Someone else mentioned White Album 2, yet the original White Album and its second season has a much more School Days feel to it. It's not your usual harem anime at all and, while it doesn't go as far on the dafuq scale as School Days did, it's pretty twisted in its own right. I'm actually more cautious in recommending WA than I am for putting School Days in front of people, but you've cleared a good chunk of my flags for it already.   This will be kind of a weird analogy, but... If you think of School Days as being kicked in the head by an elephant, then think of Kimi ga Nozomu Eien as a swift punch to the solar plexus by a rhinoceros. It's not your usual bizarre love triangle at all, and the characters have motivations behind them that slowly unfold to the point where your opinion of each of them will change at least once during the course of the anime.

Animesuggest,3ctpgk,semajdraehs,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:17:35 2015 UTC,"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzimiya (and its follow up film Disappearance):   Trailer: English dub What it's about: Haruhi Suzimiya is bored. This isn't an unusual trait for a high-schooler, but her solution is unique: set up a club dedicated to investigating the paranormal and supernatural. Dragged along for the ride is the cynical Kyon, who takes the general weirdness and domineering personality of Haruhi in his stride. Why watch it?: Haruhi is a cult sensation within anime, and she's far and away the most popular character for female anime cosplayers. She's an incredibly strong and well-developed character and anchors the entire show. Kyon, likewise, is one of the best realisations of the ""cynical, sarcastic narrating teen male lead"" that's almost omnipresent in the world of Visual Novels. The series itself is easy to pick up and drop whenever, leaning towards episodic content and with a non-linear storyline. It's funny, it's addicting, and it's weird. Caveats: Viewing order for the show is a little contested. See this image for a breakdown of the argument. Pacing-wise, the original broadcast order is fantastic, but it makes some bizarre choices in what to show and when, particularly with the first episode, which is a home-movie created by the characters and has an entirely different style, storyline and aesthetic than the rest of the show. To anyone who's already seen the whole show, I should only have to mention the words ""Endless Eight"". Themes: The power of imagination is the surface theme but, if you dig even slightly below that, there's a strong urging by the creator to the audience to try to find joy in the ""merely real"". You don't need espers and time travelers for the world to be interesting, and if they did exist, they'd quickly become mundane anyway. Similar works: Robotics;Notes and Angel Beats! both have a somewhat familiar set of characters and share the same premise: weird stuff going on in a high-school environment."

Animesuggest,3cuy8a,gvenck,2,Sat Jul 11 02:00:10 2015 UTC,"Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka?   Trailer: Preview trailer What it’s about: Gods have come to the world, and have decided to have some fun by running the world as an RPG. Through performing heroic tasks and killing monsters in the gigantic labyrinth known only as the Dungeon, their followers gain incredible power, wealth, and status. To date, the goddess Hestia has only managed to attract one person into her Familia – the idealistic young adventurer Bell Cranel. But after a chance dungeon encounter provides Bell with the more concrete goal of becoming as strong as possible as quickly as possible, things begin to change for both of them. Why you should watch it: It’s a fun, fast-paced fantasy action show. DanMachi makes the conscious decision to just embrace the tropes of stories like this and run with them, and the result is a polished, charming coming of age story. It manages to balance comedy, action and plot pretty well, and throws in light romantic notes to keep things interesting. The creators have effectively managed to boil down the source material to exactly what’s needed to keep the show moving forward – there’s no wasted space and at least one big “spectacle” scene in every episode. Hestia herself has proven a very popular character, but it’s Bell who carries the show as the naïve but well-meaning (and increasingly bad-ass) protagonist. In short, it's great light entertainment aimed at a primarily young male audience. Caveats: Well, it's inevitably going to draw comparisons to Sword Art Online, much of them deserved. I do wish that a show about adventure had been a bit more...adventurous with the story it wanted to tell. Still, there's nothing wrong with sticking to the classic tropes if you can put a new shine on them, and DanMachi pulls that off quite nicely. The harem elements start to grind as Bell picks up an increasingly preposterous set of admirers without realising that a single one of them is interested in him romantically. Critics nit-pick the loss of the detailed stats and explanations; it’s a valid criticism, but I think it managed to strike a nice balance between exposition and leaving some stuff for the source material itself to expand on. Themes: Nothing all that ground-breaking – it’s a pretty typical “power of heart” shonen action show, where not giving up is the key to both victory and the hearts of beautiful ladies alike. Similar works: Sword Art Online is easily the closest comparison. They even share the same voice actor in the lead role.      Shingeki no Bahamut   Trailer: Subtitled version What it's about: Favaro is a bounty hunter with a rogueish charm, surviving on his wits and combat skills. He's made more than a few enemies in his time, including the relentless former nobleman Kaisar. By pure accident, a young woman of mysterious origins overhears one of his taller tales - about visiting the mythical land of Helheim - and mistakes it for the truth, taking him on as a guide. Why you should watch it: Bahamut was one of the biggest surprises of 2014. By all rights it should have just been another generic card-game adaptation of the kind that we've seen dozens of times before. Instead, what we got was a flawlessly animated major action-adventure series reminiscent of Pirates of the Caribbean or The Road to El Dorado. The cinematography and direction are fantastic, not just for a ""card game adaptation"" but by any standard. The characters are distinct, likeable, and consistent, with clean attractive designs. The story is leavened by a dose of humour (mostly well-executed sight gags), and the world itself is more interesting than I'd expected. It's just a really fun show to watch. Caveats: Shingeki no Bahamut is at its strongest when the episode isn't actually progressing the central plot all that much. The story itself is, at its core, a pretty generic fantasy adventure; it’s the character interactions that make the show what it is, and where it rightly spends most of its time. There's a noticeable dip in quality in the middle of the run, but even at its worst, it's still good television. Similar works: the aforementioned Pirates of the Caribbean. Within anime, Hitsugi no Chaika and Garo.     Fate/Zero:   Trailer: Fan-made AMV What it's about: The Fourth Holy Grail War: A battle-royale between seven pairs of mages and heroic legends summoned from the past, fighting to the death. The winner is granted an artefact capable of fulfilling their greatest wish, no matter how large. Why watch it: Fate/Zero balances psychological and philosophical discussion against heart-pounding action, with little filler or fan-service to get in the way. The animation quality is simply one of the highest out there - the common joke is that ufotable could have bought a small country with what everyone presumes they've invested in this series. But the heart of the show is in the character interactions. This is not a ""coming of age"" story; every character arrives on the scene with a well-established identity and a coherent set of ethics and morals. The plot is an excuse to throw them up against one another and see what shakes out. The story is gripping and it does a decent job of contrasting different philosophies, with particular attention paid to the problems of Utilitarianism and confronting Nihilism. Caveats: This is an adaptation of a story set in a large existing body of work (the so-called ""Nasuverse""). As such, the first episode is basically a gigantic infodump where it tries to set up enough context from the source material that the rest of the show can get right down to action without interrupting to explain the mechanics. You have to watch the first episode to understand what's going on, but it doesn't sell the series particularly well. Also, the ending, while spectacular, does leave a lot of things unfulfilled, a lot of questions that are only fully answered in the follow-up Fate/Stay Night re-adaptation. Everything between the first and last episodes, however, is solid gold. Primary theme(s): Conflict of ideologies, with particular focus in the second half given to Utilitarianism. The nature of leadership, the place of chivalry. Similar works: Anything else by Gen Urobuchi - Madoka Magica or Psycho-Pass. Outside of anime, the Visual Novel of Fate/Stay Night is an obvious follow-up. It’s a major time-sink, but definitely worth the effort if you enjoyed Fate/Zero."

Animesuggest,3cv340,longliveaffinity,3,Sat Jul 11 00:52:28 2015 UTC,"Madoka Magica:  This show is one of the hardest to discuss without spoiling in advance, simply because from the description it sounds utterly unlike anything you're asking for. Until it changes. That said:   What it's about: Madoka Magica begins with the standard ""Magical Girl anime"" set-up - the moral and upstanding Madoka is approached by two strangers. The first is an adorable-looking alien named Kyubey, who offers to fulfill any wish a teenage girl might have, provided that she's willing to sign on the dotted line and risk her life fighting against strange and dangerous beings known as ""witches"". The second is a mysterious girl her own age named Homura, who strenuously warns Madoka against taking up the offer. Why watch it: Madoka Magica is one of the most highly-rated anime series of all time, and for good reason. It's often called a deconstruction of the magical girl genre, though there's some argument as to how accurate that description is. Whether it is or not, after the show gets going, the brakes come off the train as the plot careens towards an action-packed conclusion, with a massive amount of characterisation stuffed in along the way. The package is completed with a gorgeous soundtrack and a unique approach to animating action sequences that makes this an incredibly memorable series. Caveats: This show is the reason for the standard ""three episode rule"" for watching anime. Also, once you strip away the thematic elements that define the show, it is at its heart a Magical Girl series. If you're utterly unwilling to countenance watching it based on that, then, well, fair enough. Themes: Utilitarianism. Faustian bargains. Hope, despair, and sacrifice. Some see Buddhist or Christian overtones. Similar works: Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru, Revolutionary Girl Utena, Selector Infected WIXOSS . You also can’t go wrong by trying out any of the other works by the writer, Gen Urobuchi: Psycho-pass, Fate/Zero, Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom      Death Note   Trailer: Dubbed What it's about: One day, a hyperintelligent but bored teenager finds a notebook with a set of instructions attached: write someone's name in the book while thinking of their face, and they will die. He immediately sets about trying to use this new power to ""purify"" the world of all criminals and set up a new social order with himself at the head. In the process, he ends up pitting his wits against an equally brilliant detective trying to put a stop to the ongoing murders. Why you should watch it?: Death Note is a cornerstone of modern anime; it's one of the few shows almost universally regarded as a decent entry-point into the medium. The story is gripping, fast-paced, and full of twists and turns. Light Yagami is one of the most expert renderings of a descent into sociopathy that I've seen in modern fiction, and his conflict with L is endlessly fascinating. The show is the closest anime has come to ""Breaking Bad"". Caveats: The first thing people talk about when it comes to Death Note is the endless ""PLOT TWIST""s - a certain level of suspension of disbelief is required with regards to some of what goes on. The second thing everybody will talk about is that the latter half is noticeably weaker than the early material. It's true that there's a sudden lurch in the pacing after a particularly critical event, and plot holes begin to build up in the race to the finish-line. But if you're willing to roll with it, Death Note remains solidly entertaining from start to end. Theme(s): Corruption of power. Ennui and hubris. Similar works: Plotwise, Code Geass.  Zankyou no Terror has a similar dynamic to it.      Black Lagoon   Trailer: Dubbed trailer What it's about: Rokuro ""Rock"" Okajima was your average Japanese salaryman, buttoned down and sucking up. Until an assignment to the South China Sea sees his boat hijacked by the mercenary Lagoon Company, and he's taken hostage. Maybe it's just Stockholm Syndrome, but there's something unmistakably alluring about the freedom of the lives of his captors, and it's not long before he throws in his lot with the pirates. Why you should watch it: It's a straight-up, balls-to-the-wall action series. It's absolutely unapologetic about its grittiness, violence, and obscene language. At the same time, the characters are fascinating and the story lends itself well to the self-contained arc format that makes up the majority of the run. Black Lagoon is also famous for having a particularly accomplished dub. Even if you generally prefer subtitles, I’d urge you to give this one a try in English. The voice actors knock it out of the park, and it honestly seems more authentic to listen to the American accents than the originals. Caveats: Not many, really. If you're easily offended by swearing, avoid the show like the plague. Other than that, it’s really quite solid. Bear in mind that it's more of a collection of loosely-connected adventure arcs, rather than one large coherent storyline. Themes: Making decisions and living with the consequences. In particular, it disparages those who would sit on the fence without committing to one course of action through sheer indecision. Similar works: Gangsta.,  Gunsmith Cats, Cowboy Bebop and Jormungand. Outside of anime, Firefly."

But if you're committed to pruning rather than slash-and-burn, remove the following:   Berserk movies - terrible CGI, stick with the original series or go read the manga. Black Bullet - As a complaint by anime reviewers, ""Pacing issues"" tends to get an eye-roll from me as it's generally down to personal taste, but this one is just egregious. It rips through the plot at a ridiculous pace and still manages to end unfinished. Black Rock Shooter - Honestly? A bit dull. Watch the music video and leave it at that. Candy Boy - Sakura Trick does this better Danganronpa - Disappointing adaptation of good source material Deadman Wonderland - Very strong start, peters out and dribbles off at the end. Elemental Gelade - Just kind of generic. Elfen Lied - I think if I were to re-add one, this would be it, because it's a show that gets a lot of talk about it being the poster-child of teenage-angsty ""edginess"", but it's still not that good. Fairy Tail - There are better ways to spend the time needed to finish this. Fate Stay/Night (DEEN version) - Not as terrible as the memes make it out to be, but there's no reason to watch it with ufotable's Nasuverse offerings available. Fruits Basket - more aimed at young girls.  Gakkou no Kaiden - The dub is hilarious, but if you've watched the highlight reel there's no real need to watch the whole thing. Girls Bravo - It's funny, but it's bad. Grisaia - Not a good adaptation Guilty Crown - Disappointing, but pick up the soundtrack to listen to. Hellsing (leave Hellsing Ultimate) - it meanders off into its own story which doesn't work as well as the Ultimate OVAs. Excel Saga Houkago no Pleiades Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi - Good worldbuilding, but doesn't know what it's doing and careens wildly from one arc to another. Kantai Collection: KanColle - Go with Girls und Panzer instead. Kiss x Sis - Unless you're really into pandering of this type, in which case keep it on. Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? - I like the idea of ""Mahou Shonen"", but it wears most of its jokes pretty thin within the first few episodes and never bothers to come up with fresh ones. The second season of Log Horizon (better to pretend it only got one) Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei - this is just a trainwreck. Mangaka-san to Assistant-san to The Animation - Stick a video of someone shouting ""PANTSU"" on loop and you've got basically the whole show. Mekakucity Actors - Great music, incoherent story. Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu - There's nothing besides Haruhi-nostalgia to sell this series over any other school romcom. Ore, Twintails ni Narimasu. - This was a flash in the pan for the Fall season. It was apparently a lot of fun to watch alongside the crowd, but it's basically been forgotten less than half a year later. Outbreak Company - Fantastic premise, and it's actually quite fun, but I myself finished the show less than a week ago and it's already fading from memory. You've got enough to watch that it isn't a big loss. Pandora Hearts - Poor adaptation of great source material. Remake when? Plastic Nee-san - If you've seen a few gifs of this, you've seen the show. That said, it's not exactly a huge time commitment, so just plough through it if you can't bear to drop the show from the PTW list. Rolling☆Girls - An average show, but it didn't really know what it was doing. Seirei Tsukai no Blade Dance - Go with Familiar of Zero if you like this archetype. Speed Grapher - A weird bondage-fetish superhero noir. The individual parts all work OK, but put together it's a huge mess. You can predict the story about 10 episodes in advance, and the characters are fairly cookie-cutter. Tiger & Bunny - It's unique in Japanese animation, but if you're familiar with American superhero cartoons of the last decade or so, there's not much new here. Tokyo Ghoul √A - Just pretend that this doesn't exist. White Album (leave White Album 2) - Ditto.   Not all of these are bad, and many are worth watching, but with 400+ titles these stick out as fat that can comfortably be trimmed without losing much. You can always re-add them later when you've cut through some of the better shows on the list."

Animesuggest,3ctyxh,GeeJo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:28:12 2015 UTC,"Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun   Trailer: PV Trailer What it's about: Nozaki has a passion for manga. For writing girls' manga, to be specific. And he's successful at it, too, even if nobody at school believes him. Then again, they'd be more likely to do so if his personality wasn't so stoic and oblivious - to the point where he mistakes a girl's confession as a request for an autograph. Said girl, of course, isn’t willing to leave things like that, and decides that the best way of getting closer to the object of her affection is to volunteer to help out illustrating his manga. Why you should watch it: It's less of a romantic comedy than a comedy about romance. As a writer, Nozaki draws inspiration from all of the people he meets, and he's in luck as the shows cast is suitably bizarre and hilarious, from his best friend and ladykiller Mikoto, who embarrasses himself with the cheesy lines he spouts, to Chiyo's obliviously offensive Yuzuki, who terrifies the male population of the school. The show takes a sketch format, with each episode being broken up into several smaller stories about particular incidents or characters. Caveats: There's no real on-going plot, so don't go in expecting one. The characters are fun enough to riff off of for the whole length of the show, though, so it's not a big issue. Themes: This isn't really a show that you look to for deep thematic content, but there's still a bit to be said about it. Time and again Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun comes back to the idea of reversing expectations and roles (particularly gender roles) - the ""manly"" character is secretly the shyest person in school, the stoic Nozaki is secretly one of the most popular writers of girl's romance, the ""Prince"" of the school is actually a girl, etc. Obviously some ""reversals"" like this are intrinsic to comedy, but Gekkan Shoujo does enough of it that it's reasonable to say that there's a point to them in and of themselves. Similar works: Daily Lives of Highschool Boys, The Comic Artist and his Assistants."

From what I've watched, Rokka no Yuusha had what I felt was the strongest premiere, with strong visuals and animation, a great fantasy setting, and a very interesting hook that will be introduced in later episodes. Might go the way of a generic shounen, but Im hoping it will remain more interesting than that.  Beyond that, Gangsta has been great so far as well. Great action with a dark and grim setting makes for plenty of entertainment and potential. There's also more Durarara airing this season, if you watched the previous few.  Snow White With Red Hair had a great first episode as well. It's a very well done fantasy shoujo, and I'm really liking it even though its from a genre that I usually detest (shoujo and me just don't click for whatever reason). Hopefully it keeps that up.  If you missed the previous season as well I would suggest to check out Kekkai Sensen - its easily the best show of the spring season, being a highly entertaining and wacky action series with a colorful cast of characters.

Noriko’s father was killed in one of the first fleet actions of the war, and now she trains in the hope of fighting back from the cockpit of a combat mech.  Why you should watch it: Gunbuster’s main claim to fame is being the directorial debut of Hideki Anno, (Neon Genesis Evangelion). This sells it a bit short, though – the show stands on its own two legs as a great example of 80s “giant robot” battlers. Noriko’s journey from her time as a trainee to her final battle is well mapped-out, and the audience gets to see her struggle and overcome her fears, feelings, and failings, as well as the various perils of space combat. One particularly impressive element is the show’s use of realistic time-dilation as a plot point. On top of the dangers they face in the fight itself, they know that every battle drags them farther away from home. Caveats:The first episode is a deliberate parody of the tennis show Aim for the Ace!. If you haven’t seen it before going in, this is the reason for the absurd mecha gymnastics and sports-show storyline. Things do pick up in later episodes, but it exacerbates the problems of a short run-time – the emotional impact that events have on Noriko doesn’t match up with the audience’s experience because we’re not given enough time for things to soak in. Finally, Gunbuster is very much a product of its time; the soundtrack and the visual aesthetics are pure 1980s. Be prepared for cheese. And random nudity. Themes: Transience and mortality. Even in a worthwhile cause, time is spent faster than you might think. But the relationships people forge are truly eternal. Similar works: The follow-up Diebuster is a good place to start. Otherwise, Knights of Sidonia for another standard mecha vs alien show, or Neon Genesis Evangelion for more of Anno’s vision of how things should work. Outside of anime, Ender’s Game bears a lot of similarities."

Albedo is a frequent secondary character edging into ""main"", while Shalltear is more there to play off of Albedo herself.  That said, it's not a romance anime - the yandere relationship is a sideshow, not the focus."

In all honesty, I love anime that allows one to feel sadness as the show has truly excelled in making a connection with the audience. By taking a break from anime and watching shows, you will allow your analytical skills to skyrocket as more often than not, there is a lot to be analyzed in anime and shows.  TL;DR: Watch House of Cards or Daredevil."

Animesuggest,3ctrwd,anonymepelle,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:41:04 2015 UTC,"Barakamon and Tsuritama are two great slice of life series that should fit what you are looking for. There are certainly emotional moments within them, but they are generally very 'happy' shows and ones which are easy and relaxing to watch. Watch Barakamon if you prefer a more grounded show, and Tsuritama if you prefer something that has some very interesting supernatural elements.  If you don't mind checking out manga, I would also suggest giving Bonnouji a read. It's a romance series which is simply sweet and has zero drama, and definitely fits what you are looking for as well."

It's insane, I dont know whether to laugh or to cry sometimes, and the fighting is beyond great. So over the top, so ridiculous, so fkin good.   Seconding everything /u/Isiwjee suggested, and maybe adding Eden of the East (dub) too. All of those have great dubs, but Madoka's sounds a little better in Japanese.
