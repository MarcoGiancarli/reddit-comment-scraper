japan,3e0oow,bmjtx,3,Tue Jul 21 01:34:29 2015 UTC,"Well, the dates on the photos, 15.5.20, and so on means it was probably May, 1942 (year 15 of the Showa Emperor), Cape Gloucester is on the island of New Britain, and was an ugly, wet, jungle fight. The flag is sort of a good luck charm, usually signed by a soldier's school/village mates. That was probably taken off a body.  (Especially with a date of Dec 26,which was in the middle of the combat period.)   The campaign was undertaken basically to help isolate the huge navy base further along the island at Rabaul. The scrap book is a Japanese navy commemorative thing, (and in way too good of condition to be a battlefield trophy), so I'd guess he found it or traded for it after the navy base at  Rabaul fell, and that it has no connection with the flag."

The copyright owners fight and the telecom giants fight for you to use their shitty service.  Japan does fall behind in things like UI and real usabiltity but this is due to their incorrect misuse and overuse of vendors. The vendors are shitty to apply what is needed for another company and sometimes stick to old tech and languages, because they have their business relationships formed and their is no need to change otherwise.

The second world war was a low point for humanity from all different countries, allies and axis. Mitsubishi, BMW and other companies like Mercedes which used POW/slave labor in factories did it because they needed to survive while the various countries bombed each other into oblivion. Yes there were many decisions that made Japan aggressors and many that were immoral, but only deemed war crimes because Japan lost the war. You think the US is ever going to apologize for firebombing civilians and dropping an atomic bomb on a civilian city ?

So, you are right that they did not have to do it, but it is much nicer to do it especially when they know the ex-POWs (who are still alive) want it.

WWII had some good guys and bad guys on both sides. But it is the most clear-cut of good guys vs bad guys of any war I can think of in the last several hundred years. Arguing that the war crimes of allies even compares is just ignorant.   Also it is very important for Japanese companies especially to apologize. Japan is notorious for denying the war crimes, which pisses off a lot of other Asian countries who suffered the atrocities from the Japanese. ANd the US has publicly apologized and acknowledged the horror of the firebombing and the a bombs countless times. They may not have said they wouldn't do it again, but they have certainly acknowledged the horror and damage it did. Also the US poured in inane amounts of money and resources to rebuild Japan ( as a foothold against the USSR, among many other reasons) but because of that public acknowledgement and efforts to rebuild. Japan harbors zero ill will to the US. ANd because Germany openly admits its sins with the aggression Holocaust etc. Europe and Israel do not harbor ill will to Germany.  Asia still is bothered by Japan because it never admitted it did anything wrong. Admitting so takes huge steps towards building those relations back up. If you think forgetting the past just because it was someone else problem, solves things, you are sorely mistaken."
japan,3dvyw4,sgtoox,4,Mon Jul 20 19:03:24 2015 UTC,"Japan is denying war crimes because most of the time they dont see them as war crimes.

"" If you think forgetting the past just because it was someone else problem, solves things, you are sorely mistaken."" I never said that Im just saying in this case Mitsubishi which was contracted by the government to make supplies for the war shouldnt have to apologize. If you think the US or any other government wouldnt do the same thing in a second if an enemy was winning the war and nearing their land you are mistaken. Prisoners of war on the production line are not much different than people forcibly drafted into war against their will and we have done it in the US since the civil war."

After the war the U.K. quickly worked to regain control of its Colonial empire territories, and also worked to ensure that the Dutch and French could regain control of their colonial empires.

Except half the guests will give me no money because of customs, and many will give nothing at all since a plane ticket is already too expensive. Some I have to pay for part of their plane ticket if they come to Japan."

Clearly they won't pay for guest's plane tickets so that is one cost they don't have to cover. Also, it is quite possible that Waikiki is much cheaper than in some fancy place in central Tokyo (though I have no idea). Seriously, you are not that close to that person and the gift expectations are kind of ridiculous when it's already a burden to even attend in the first place. I don't know what they expect, but I wouldn't go all out."

I got married this March, and I've been to 2 weddings in Japan over the years. Of course it can also depend on your friends.

In fact, I've seen TV shows in Japan that show the return of flags like this to the families.

Some families have practically nothing from their lost loved ones. It has nothing to do with the nationalists, the fascists, or trumpeting the pride of people who were for the war. I can't imagine how you trot all that ridiculous shit into a simple question about returning one individual's private possession to either him or his surviving relatives.  Can you please cite some instances of people being pissed off that some dirty foreigner here to soil their women or shame their glorious warrior spirit returned a flag or some other souvenir either stolen from a prisoner or robbed off the body of a dead man? Some instances of nationalists or fascists making political hay of such a return?"
japan,3dtw8r,mike_cash,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:31:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying I agree with what he's saying, but you have to understand that this ""property"" has symbolic content.  If you found a Nazi flag with names on it, would you try to return it to the family of the people who were named?  They might well percieve it as offensive if you did.  I'm not saying what the right thing to do is, because I honestly don't know.  But it's more complicated than just ""returning property.""  Japan is not America-- our cultural/moral standards surrounding human decency can and do differ.  The best thing to do would probably be consult several Japanese people about whether or not one should attempt to return the flag."

What on earth is there on the flag in question for the surviving relatives to be ""offended"" about? I swear to God, the world has watched too damned many Hollywood movies about Japan.  Tell me, wise one, what differences in Japanese cultural/moral standards surrounding human decency do you imagine would cause the relatives to be offended by having something returned? Please give some examples where such returns have caused offense in the past.  The best thing to do would be to consult the Japanese group which exists for the sole purpose of repatriating shit like this for fuck's sake. Why is it any time a subject involves Japan everybody has to make shit about a hundred times more complicated than it needs to be? Leave all that honor/dignity/respect/samurai/bushido/culture bullshit at the door for once. Jesus Harold Christ, they're just people and the surviving relatives would like to have their shit back."
japan,3dtw8r,mike_cash,0,Sun Jul 19 23:13:11 2015 UTC,"Whoa.  Calm down.  I'm not the same person that's been talking to you.  I couldn't agree more that the correct group to talk to would be the Japanese group that exists to handle things like this-- if there is such a Japanese group (didn't realize there was) this is clearly what's culturally appropriate.  All I was saying is that I don't know how what symbolic content a flag like this might have for a Japanese person.  I'm a sociologist.  ""Property"" is not just ""property""; you're oversimplifying the situation.  If what a Japanese person would want is to have the flag back, then the best thing to do is to give the flag back, but trying to simplify/neglect/ignore the fact that cultural context is variable is ridiculous.  It isn't about people missing family members (obviously anyone would)-- it's about how someone might read an object with symbolic content.  This is actually ridiculously complicated and not necessarily predictable, which is why the best thing to do in situations like this is consult natives (in this case, the organization that handles this sort of thing).  To give you an example of how symbols are read differently for people in different cultural contexts, a baseball will never mean the same thing to the average Chinese person as it does to the average American.  This isn't because one meaning is wrong or right, nor is it because one meaning is better or worse; it's because cultural context varies.  I'm not talking about honor/dignity/respect/samurai/bushido/culture bullshit (however, there are definitely some aspects of honor and respect that are literally built in to the Japanese language and I do think that honor and respect are handled differently in Japan than in many Western countries), we're talking about the fact that my visceral response when I see a certain symbol can be systematically linked with the cultural context that I live within.  If we don't exist within a cultural context, it's not a good idea to try to predict what sort of visceral responses a symbol might bring about.  Frankly, I don't disagree with what you're saying should be done, I disagree with the way you're saying it.  ""People are just people"" is a ludicrous oversimplification of humanity that doesn't do anyone any justice.  We've all got plenty in common, but there are also differences.  Ignoring these differences is insensitive at best and at worst catastrophic.  You and the person you've been arguing with are both doing the same thing: pretending that you can predict how someone in a different culture is going to respond to a symbol.  The correct reason to give the flag to the Japanese group that handles these flags is not ""because the family will obviously want the flag back.""  The correct reason to give the flag to the Japanese group is ""because I am not in a position where I can reasonably determine what should be done with this symbolic object; I should give it to someone who is."""
japan,3dtw8r,SarutobiSasuke,0,Sun Jul 19 23:25:17 2015 UTC,"If I don't exist within the cultural context, I'm certainly right next door to it by now.  I can't understand all the angst about whether evil foreign devil woman despoiling samurai spirit feeling hurting whitey might cause some discomfort in something as simple and human and returning a private possession....it smacks largely of The Big White Man needing to protect the poor defenseless Japanese people and is highly patronizing. It all smacks of the ridiculous crap we get all the time of people wanting to come to Japan and who are worried shitless about doing or saying something that will ""offend"" the Japanese sense of honor/dignity/respect, as though everybody is the country is extremely delicate and spends their whole lives wandering the streets looking for shit to get offended about so they can either cut the other person's head off or cut their own guts out to preserve their honor. Hollywood horseshit. Yes, the Japanese people are just people. They don't have to be handled with kid gloves.   The main reason the object should be given to the group is not because the group is Japanese and better able to handle cultural sensitivities involved with repatriation, it is because they are better equipped linguistically to actually track down the owners when that is possible to do at all. You practically never encounter anyone with one of these looted war souvenirs who has the slightest clue what is written on anything, much less how to go about repatriating it.

Hmm, well, maybe it's not really your fault. /r/JapanCircleJerk is an echo chamber so you probably just don't realize how you sound, or how your humor doesn't translate when you spill over onto the main board.  But aside from that, it's because someone is actually asking for help in this thread, ya know? This thread was a legitimate plea for help. And while yes, it was basically shooting an arrow in to the night, even the smallest dose of empathy should suggest even a slightly serious response.  And what happened? You all spill over from the circle jerk and filled the thread with nonsense and mocking the OP.  And yea, I apologize if you're offended by the 'bitter' comment. But, bitter is a good descriptor. Just look at japancirclejerk's front page... it's a shit show. The people who frequent there clearly aren't enjoying their time in Japan and then turn around and make fun of the people who are. What do we call that? Oh, yea... being bitter.  So when bitter people post bitter comments both of which spilled over from a bitter subreddit... yea, bitter seems apt.  I apologize if this is offended you, and I understand you'll need to defend yourself, your subreddit and friend, but please note that I wasn't ever disagreeing with you at any point in my original comment.

Why do you characterize /r/japan as the ""main"" board? Is JCJ in your mind some lesser and illegitimate offshoot of /r/japan? If you cut off the participation of many of the JCJ crew in the other Japan-related subreddits, you're essentially cutting off a large hunk of the people who actually are capable of providing informed answers to the questions which come up in the other subs.  Making a joke in the face of a serious request for help is an asshole move, no doubt, but there is no way it is indicative of one being bitter.  Why do you think those of us who congregate in JCJ are ""clearly"" not enjoying our time in Japan? How on earth do you arrive at that conclusion? I don't know everyone's particulars there, but by and large they tend to be the people who have been here for decades, are quite comfortable and content with living here, and are just amused by some of the ignorant statements and antics of more recent arrivals who are still fascinated and impressed with themselves just for being here.  You haven't offended me the least little bit, and no apology is necessary. I appreciate your taking the time to give me a serious and heartfelt reply.  I sometimes wonder if the popularity of the ""bitter"" appellation is unique to describing gaijins who've been around longer than the speaker, or if it is just in more common usage in English speaking countries than it was when I used to live in one and that's why I'm seeing it more than I would expect."

In all honesty, I think JCJ is starting to become a problem somehow ... many topics are genuinely funny and, somehow, pointing at real thinking disorder toward Japan from people living here or just being admirator or the country or some of its aspects.   But man, so many jokes are shit and revealing of a very low level of mentality ... when it's not joke but actual statement just aimed to upset, point fingers and judge one another in a vain hope to feel better about oneself. So many parts of that subs sound like a JHS classroom ...   Maybe the joke wasn't bad in itself, but people are getting sick of JCJ worst posters ? Maybe."

These boards are heavily visited by primarily English-speaking foreigners. Do you know the nationality of the theif? Can you even guess?  Were they French, German, Spanish, Polish, Italian, Israeli? I understand the need to feel like you're doing something, so I suggest trying to make an educated guess on their nationality and then posting on boards there.  Until then, continue staying in contact with the police. For theft, there isn't much they can do and sentimental valuables don't really rank high on the police 'care-o-meter' so, sadly, your friend may have to just accept that loss.  Your other option is to call the school she worked at, explain the situation, and maybe they can come up with something quickly. If she is an ALT, contact the branch company and they can help translate the situation. But I'd talk with a foreigner as the Japanese staff might be sympathetic but give a 'shouganai' response."

More plainly, most people are fucking stupid. Majority opinion is a fucking stupid metric to decide what policies are good in the real world.  From time to time, our elected leaders will choose policies that are not popular with the ignorant masses (sometimes, or should I say almost always when it comes to issues of Japanese defense and American bases, opinion and protest marches are being led by paid shills for foreign governments who tend to have a hammer and sickle and red flag theme, but I digress), but make sense in the real world."

Luckily she isn't doing this kind of stuff anymore, but it hurts me to know that hundreds or maybe even thousands of girls out there roam the streets alone at night in scary, dangerous neighborhoods, selling their body for 30.000 yen just to get by or, in some cases, because they yearn for love and expensive clothes. Just ordinary girls like my sister. Still just children, but getting fucked by nasty 60 year old salaryman Takehiro. Some even force the girls to drink alcohol or smoke because they want them to get shitfaced drunk so they can't say stop, or just because they like to ruin the innocent image of the cute like high school girl. My friend didn't even have any protection from bosses. She was completely alone and would sometimes get in a bad situation which could be classified as rape without a doubt, but how would she report it?   And her classmates, they didn't have a clue. Just hours after having sex with an old man in a love hotel, she would go to school with a hangover and a few thousand yen extra in her pockets, claiming that she probably caught a cold. They never knew. She was just one of the girls in their eyes. As a fucking 15 year old. She was barely even out of middle school.   And the worst part? To this day, she still gets harassed and called out on the streets. I've witnessed it. With my own eyes and while talking with her on thr phone. No wonder she hates walking outside alone.

I said hi, made some small talk, then asked if she wanted to go out.   一万円。 <--- 10,000 yen, or about a hundred dollars. At first, I was surprised, and then she said that it was JUST go out and have a meal. So yeah. There you go.  On a side note, I was walking around town a couple days ago and saw an older gentleman and a 20something women. They were chatting and he pulled her waistband and looked down her shorts. Yep.

The recommended route for tourists in Japan are pocket Wi-Fi's delivered straight to the Post Office at the airport. You can pick it up as soon as you arrive. Most tourists already get their sims or pocket Wi-Fi from one of the providers here anyway.  I used CDJapan's WiMax pocket Wi-Fi last time I went and took me 2 mins to find the Post Office at Narita, true unlimited quota across multiple devices, not like this 100mb a day garbage."

In the UK they're sold in supermarkets/stores so prominently that I didn't see them at first (expected them to be further back), whereas in France I had to take my passport to the one Orange store in the area and spend about 30 minutes (and 40 euros) fluffing around."

japan,3dpdkg,EvoEpitaph,0,Sun Jul 19 23:31:39 2015 UTC,"It depends on where you go as Wi-Max's coverage isn't as extensive as Docomo's, should be fine in the big cities though.  EDIT: I just saw Malaysia's rate for a traveller's sim card $58 for 5GB or 2GB+2GB(night usage) for $55 (which is less than 2000 yen)."
japan,3dpdkg,sanjugo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:17:40 2015 UTC,Does this provide voice service?
japan,3dpdkg,darkstriders,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:31:24 2015 UTC,You can order a sim from bmobile and have it shipped to any airport / hotel you want and the service will be way way cheaper as far as I know.
japan,3dpdkg,MysticSoup,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:35:34 2015 UTC,"""only credit cards accepted""  :-(. I dont even have one and during the last visit the one from my Girlfriend was not accepted. Why dont they simply allow cash aswell?"
japan,3dpdkg,densha_de_go,2,Sat Jul 18 16:02:54 2015 UTC,"It's advisable that your GF call her credit card issuer and inform them of the impending trip, so they are aware what's going on and approve any transactions from abroad."
japan,3dpdkg,jcpb,0,Sat Jul 18 18:51:10 2015 UTC,"Because terrorists use cash. Terrorists avoid using credit cards, due to the Islamic prohibition on borrowing/lending. Japan doesn't have terrorists, so they don't have to worry about cultists and chemical weapons."

japan,3dsyvn,TheRedViper85,7,Sun Jul 19 03:58:23 2015 UTC,You probably aren't going to get anything very nice for 80000 yen. But for a nice area nearby I'd choose Ningyocho. Kind of a small town vibe with lots of variety in restaurants both foreign and Japanese.

japan,3dnj83,amazing_ape,8,Fri Jul 17 18:41:43 2015 UTC,"This sounds pretty sad from the article (though my Japanese isn't at a level where I can confirm for myself.) That being said, making discussions on legislation like this is actually pretty ingenious. Obviously the main problem is that it would likely always be partisan propaganda. But talk about accessibility! The main problem with laws and legislation is they're so boring and overcontrived that most average people can't hope to understand them and really be informed as to how their society works. An unbiased manga (comic, animation, whatever) series on your country's legislative process, especially around election time, would actually be an amazing tool."
japan,3dnj83,ZeroDaNominator,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:43:21 2015 UTC,"Sort of like that ""I'm just a bill"" cartoon. Not a bad idea, IF political parties aren't using as propaganda."

japan,3dnj83,Finnish_Nationalist,0,Sat Jul 18 14:12:58 2015 UTC,Were they? It'd certainly be interesting to read the Mein Kampf manga.

japan,3dm9ui,Koopakid64,14,Fri Jul 17 12:34:09 2015 UTC,"Something about them being in Lambo's make them seem not so Bosozoku... More like new money Yakuza that are dumb with their money instead of playing it cool with a black Crown or Cima. Bosozoku always seemed to be a working wage level of gangster, in my opinion. This trailer gives a more proper view.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQtIBpR0iCE"
japan,3dm9ui,OnLakeOntario,4,Fri Jul 17 14:47:13 2015 UTC,"I honestly didn't know they had so much gang affiliation, I just thought it was a weird subculture."
japan,3dm9ui,TheTabman,7,Fri Jul 17 15:56:19 2015 UTC,"Some of the Bōsōzoku groups are also xenophobic and nationalistic fucks. But not all though, some use the nationalistic icons and symbols only because they look ""cool"". Generally, the older Bōsōzoku (35+) are idiot ultra-nationalists, while the younger are only idiots.     Disclaimer: The books told me so! Never meet a Bōsōzoku myself."
japan,3dm9ui,KiwiMaoriJapan,12,Fri Jul 17 17:15:56 2015 UTC,The director is extremely talented but wasting his talents with this ...story.
japan,3dm9ui,xpowa,6,Fri Jul 17 15:35:24 2015 UTC,Want to watch it but I lived in a town that had tons of of these punks.  I hated them so much.

japan,3dm9ui,bonkyubonbon,3,Fri Jul 17 23:35:37 2015 UTC,"Here's another video with this guy, though not centered on him. It's also not about Bosozoku and doesn't have a story, but imo it's entertaining to watch."
japan,3dm9ui,bigtoepfer,5,Fri Jul 17 21:38:28 2015 UTC,"Having ""Bosozoku"" and ""cool"" in the same sentence is... daring. Nice video though.     Only IMO of course."
japan,3dm9ui,moheji,3,Fri Jul 17 14:11:03 2015 UTC,"I guess ""interesting"" would have been a better choice of word lol"
japan,3dm9ui,PeaceMaintainer,2,Fri Jul 17 14:28:08 2015 UTC,"It's funny how viewing documentaries about these guys is kind of cool outside of Japan. Like, yeah! They're stickin it to the man! They're bucking the system!   And then you live here and you realize they're just assholes."
japan,3dm9ui,Umbo,2,Mon Jul 20 00:58:01 2015 UTC,Never consider this guy bosozoku any time I'd watched the video.  I suppose since there are bikers in the video it makes sense to add the tag.    Kind of a old video that this point though.  Surprised it hasn't been posted here before.
