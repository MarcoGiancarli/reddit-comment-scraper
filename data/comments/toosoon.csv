toosoon,3ddznj,robbiegd,3,Wed Jul 15 15:50:50 2015 UTC,"Anyone else think it's kinda bullshit how child support is tied to your income? Especially if those children never lived with their father, how the fuck do they or the mother deserve $400k? According to google ""The median wage in the US per person is $26,695."" so that's basically 100% of the average person's salary for 18 years. Seems like an unrealistic requirement for raising a child as a single parent."

toosoon,3ddznj,PurpleNuggets,8,Wed Jul 15 16:48:49 2015 UTC,The close to half a mil in child support might be based (at least partially) on his income instead of number of kids/time without payment.
toosoon,3ddznj,MasterChiefFloyd117,6,Wed Jul 15 22:05:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, child support is based on monthly gross income. Especially if there's a large disparity between the parents' income (i.e. DMX knocked a girl up in the 'hood before he became famous, so he became rich and she stayed poor), then the payments will be higher."

toosoon,3ddznj,AlextheGerman,9,Thu Jul 16 04:23:42 2015 UTC,I'm sure no white people owe back child support. /s
toosoon,3ddznj,rj20876,4,Wed Jul 15 21:59:23 2015 UTC,"Not really. He grew up in a very rough neighborhood in Yonkers, and hopped from group home to group home. Bad childhood, turned to crime, etc. He blew in the late 90s, but really dropped off the map in the mid-2000s and never revitalized. Suddenly his income source disappeared along with his fame, thus his return to the only other thing than rapping that he's ever known.  So if the stereotype is that people who grow up in rough areas and have bad childhoods are more likely to turn to bad things, then... The stereotype is correct. But for some reason I don't think that's the stereotype you're referring to."

toosoon,3d7miq,1000timesinmyhead,0,Tue Jul 14 18:48:10 2015 UTC,I was expecting the thing that picks you up when you die in MarioKart
toosoon,3d7miq,bagano1,-7,Tue Jul 14 14:38:08 2015 UTC,"Quite honestly, she might be better than most of the idiots that have run that company in the past 20 years. Nintendo is badly managed. Their name alone would put them back on top if they would try to seriously compete with Microsoft and Sony and stop dicking around. If they released a console with blu-ray and supported it properly and stopped being difficult with third parties, they would instantly destroy everyone.  It's just insanity."
toosoon,3d7miq,Karsonist,2,Tue Jul 14 17:11:01 2015 UTC,"So I guess you were just black out drunk the entire last generation when the Wii shit on the 360 and PS3 from a great height? They're not idiots for taking a different approach from Microsoft and Sony. Blu-ray might have been a reason in purchasing a console last generation but I doubt it factors into many peoples decisions now they are much cheaper to buy on their own, separate from a gaming console. Yes the Wii U is performing very poorly but you're armchair CEOing a rapidly changing and multi-facted industry."
toosoon,3d7miq,bagano1,-3,Tue Jul 14 19:00:38 2015 UTC,So I guess you were just black out drunk the entire last generation when the Wii shit on the 360 and PS3 from a great height?    Are you fucking serious?  Do you get out much? This doesn't even deserve a response.
toosoon,3d7miq,Karsonist,2,Tue Jul 14 19:05:25 2015 UTC,I'm speaking in terms of sales
toosoon,3d7miq,bagano1,-5,Tue Jul 14 19:26:02 2015 UTC,"The systems sold well because every Tom, Dick and Yuppie bought one to play at parties.  Once the fad was over, the system collected dust. The real gamers continued to support the Xbox 360's and PS3's that they had.  Nice try though."
toosoon,3d7miq,studdenfadden,5,Tue Jul 14 19:36:41 2015 UTC,Real Gamers Console Owners   Pick one
toosoon,3d7miq,flesjewater,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:43:14 2015 UTC,But in the end sales is the only metric that matters in the real world. And they did a great job at that.
toosoon,3d7miq,bagano1,-2,Tue Jul 14 23:24:12 2015 UTC,"They didn't sell games for the Wii, genius.  That's the metric that ultimately mattered or did you completely miss that?"
toosoon,3d7miq,Karsonist,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:43:21 2015 UTC,"Microsoft straight up copied Mii's on the 360 and the Kinect and Playstation Move were both attempts at emulating the Wii's success. Nintendo tried doing their own thing when they realized they couldn't beat them mirroring their strategy and Sony and Microsoft shamelessly copied them when taking a risk rewarded Nintendo. So if you think they give two shits about ""real gamers"" then you're as naive as you are condescending. Iwata was more of a real gamer than anyone who will have take on a high mantel and competing companies, he just knew that once he took on CEO that the bottom line was sales and pleasing stock holders, not appeasing someone like yourself."
toosoon,3d7miq,bagano1,-5,Tue Jul 14 20:02:57 2015 UTC,"Typical Nintendo cult member. Bet you still wish Nintendo Power was around, huh?

toosoon,3d7miq,Karsonist,-1,Tue Jul 14 20:13:08 2015 UTC,"If by going strong you mean diminishing once great franchises like halo or putting out gorgeous games that are boring as fuck like the order. I own all the the systems of last gen and enjoy them equally, I'm not the kind of faggot who goes around calling other people cult members. I go where the fun is and the Xbox one and ps4 are overpriced pieces of hardware that are easily out performed by a good PC rig.

I posted the context because otherwise this is just a picture with an obscure name. It's not a joke, it's words with no sense behind them. If you want people to laugh or at least enjoy your joke, you need to provide context. For a while, this sub was good about it, posting an article or whatever for the backstory to the joke. These posts, however, rely on the willingness of someone to go ""Oh, this isn't funny at all, I should research this further"" rather than ""what the fuck is this shit, what a dick"".  I didn't ask OP to say ""THIS IS FUNNY BECAUSE X AND Y AND EVEN Z, AND YOU MIGHT EVEN FIND IT FUNNY BECAUSE OF B!"" I'm asking him to give me the ""Why did the chicken cross the road?"" to his post of ""To get to the other side"".

toosoon,3cm3v4,modernbenoni,-2,Thu Jul 9 13:33:29 2015 UTC,"It is a pop culture referencing joke. The point of such jokes is that people already know what you are referring to. Your comparison to you providing ""why did the chicken cross the road?"" does not hold up at all because that is part of the joke, and is absolutely required for the punchline to make any sense.  No, this is more like if I said the joke: ""What was Whitney Houston's biggest hit? Her last!"", and then you coming into the comments and complaining that I did not point out that she is dead and was a known drug user. If you don't know those facts then the joke is just not aimed at you."
toosoon,3cm3v4,boredcanadian,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:38:13 2015 UTC,"That'd be all well and good if this was a name everyone knew off the top of their head like Whitney Houston, or Micheal Jackson. This guy hasn't even been alive as long as they'd been famous, so it's not as recognizable, and as a result is a pretty niche joke. It's just fine as a joke if you know the first part is ""Football player loses finger in fireworks accident"" which could have been solved by posting an article. As it is, it's a name that not a lot of people will know right away unless they are motivated to google it for some reason.  It would have taken 5 seconds to make a post with context, and was pretty common for a little while on this sub, which was great. Then a couple people decided to post something relying on name recognition of a random athlete who had an accident that same day and somehow didn't make the sports section of the news where they report every fart and hiccup.  You'll notice that there are always posts asking for context in posts like this, I went the extra step and added a link directly to it. Posting context is nothing new, and asking for context is nothing new."

Individuals have every right to display all manner of tasteless things on their own private property and person. Having a symbol of the confederacy permanently affixed to a state capital building specifically in protest of the civil rights movement is something quite different.  Also, one would think a freedom lover would also support the rights of any business owner to choose not to stock a product that they find objectionable or at least do not wish to be associated with. How is that any different from a bigoted pizza restaurant refusing to cater a hypothetical gay wedding? Are business owners only allowed to have beliefs when you agree with them?"
