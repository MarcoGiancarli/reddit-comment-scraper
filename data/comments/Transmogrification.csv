The fix is simple - get exalted with Lorewalkers in Pandaria and buy their tabard! It's as if the T18 normal set was made for this tabard. Getting exalted is actually much easier than it sounds - you must visit landmarks around the Pandaria continent and once you've visited them all let Lorewalker Cho tell you a bunch of stories. Use this addon to get it : http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/handynotes_lorewalkers  In the picture i've got the heroic version of the headpiece, as i havent got the normal head transmog yet. My weapon is Amber Spear of the Klaxxi'Vess which can be purchased when reaching Exalted with Klaxxi in Pandaria.

I know Archimonde is bare-chested with visible pants/boots, but since I can only wear cloth I'm pretty restricted in what I can use. I know there are chests that would go with the colours in the Archimonde pieces, but I really like going the bare-chest route like the Eredar lord himself. The Archimonde pieces I'm using are:    Head: Demon Prince's Ascendant Crown Shoulders: Mantle of the Eredar Lord Belt: Demonbuckle Sash of Argus  The other pieces I'm using are: Chest: Anchorite Robe Hands: Spelltwister's Gloves    I pretty much only use staffs, so I'm looking for a staff to match this set and I'm having a bit of trouble. I've tried matching the green or the bronze, and I'm having trouble with both. Best I have so far is Jaina's Staff, but the shade of green isn't quite right. I'm currently farming for Terokk's Shadowstaff but it hasn't dropped yet.  Anyone know of any other staffs which may be a better fit?"
Transmogrification,3dxmy5,Sarkat,2,Mon Jul 20 11:28:19 2015 UTC,"There's a pretty decent common staff that has the same hue of dark gold/brass, you can try it.  There are also a druidic-looking Spire, and a couple of old pvp gladiator's staffs."
Transmogrification,3dxmy5,Appl3P13,3,Mon Jul 20 14:13:01 2015 UTC,Technically it's an uncommon staff.
Transmogrification,3dxmy5,pilstrom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:23:18 2015 UTC,"That Skettis staff was the very first one I tried, but I dismissed due to the green not being the right hue, although upon further examination the bronze matches fairly well.  The Spire you speak of was also another option I looked at, but it's got that darn blue glow effect around the top of the staff, and the blue clashes with the whole set in my opinion.  I initially dismissed the PvP ones because that'd mean I'd actually ned to PvP, which I hate, but I'll need to give them a closer look."

I believe humans still start with the same robes from classic."

Transmogrification,3db7cx,dwot,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:47:34 2015 UTC,http://wowroleplaygear.com/  Best site in my opinion. Also you don't need people to help you for oldschool raids. Look up guides on youtube if you are struggling with certain fights. MoP content is better to do with a small group than solo.

Transmogrification,3bfe9v,TheWheatOne,2,Tue Jun 30 01:18:40 2015 UTC,"Most of this xmog is from the Gateshattering Battle set of which there are a few color variations. This is a great ""conquistador"" looking set and pairs nicely with a polearm for a different kind of strength dps look.  I know the Red & Black set can only be completed through quest rewards. Blacksmiths can craft the shoulders and helm, but none of the other pieces. It's called the ""Redsteel"" set, but the other pieces are completely different models. BS can also craft other color pieces ""Stormforged"", but I don't think they can do the whole set. I've only looked into this for the red/black, so check those Wowhead links first.   Red/Black - Mount Hyjal quests. Start at the beginning of Mt. Hyjal, follow all the quests and in an hour or so you should have a complete set. I just redid this recently specifically for this gear.  Blue/Silver/Copper - Vashj'ir quests.  Yellow/Silver/Copper - Deepholme quests.  Green - this whole set can be obtained from BoEs, very easy to collect.

Nothing I tried was satisfying to me, mostly because there are no really cloth-looking gloves and boots.

Transmogrification,3aoejt,wbehri01,2,Mon Jun 22 04:36:13 2015 UTC,"So I was running around looking for alternatives for some items because I had thrown them out (Auchenai Monk's Tunic), or didn't want to grind rep (Mind-Expanding Leggings), and I managed to find a few.   Leggings of Brazen Trespass are a great alternative to Mind-Expanding Leggings because while you're farming for Gloves of the Argent Fanatic the leggings have a chance to drop in an earlier cache.   I had already thrown out my Auchenai Monk's Tunic so while I was searching I found Mag'Hari Scout's Tunic. It is a very complicated item to get. The quest chains you need to complete are in the comments on WoWHead.  Another item I swapped was Tabard of the Explorer. I exchanged it for Saberstalker Tabard. I found that the Saberstalker tabard fit better with the animal-like theme.   Scapp gave me some fantastic ideas for weapon since I am not a Rogue but I went looking for more staves/polearms that Monks can use. I ended up settling on Baleful Polearm with Blood Draining. There might be a better Illusion to use but I don't feel like testing every one out.  Finally I was looking for a good alternate to Snow Lily Belt because I'm currently on the lowest pop server (Ravenholdt) and it's very difficult to get previous expansion's materials. If anyone has any recommendations I would love to see them.  My finished product with all alternates is here. If you want to see my character switch the player to Pandaren Male.  tl;dr A bunch of alternates to some gear."
Transmogrification,3aoejt,jad103,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:10:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!!  I am currently using Leggings of Brazen Trespass for this xmog as well. But, if you are at least friendly with the kirin tor, you can wear their tabard as you farm the ICC dungeons and ToC and you will get lots of rep for them :)  Auchenai Monk's Tunic is DEFINITELY a problem piece for this set. I know I did the quest and threw out the item already, I wish I kept it. That Mag'Hari Scout's Tunic is horde only though, so for a dwarf that wouldn't work. Currently, I use the chest from Halls of Reflection (same ""set"" as the shoulders)  Ugh, the Saberstalker Tabard is so cool.. I'm just sooo lazy to farm the rep haha (and undergeared so it's hard)  The weapon looks great :) If you download MogIt, you can test out every illusion and see what each of them looks like. It's a lot of work, but you won't have to spend money each time (if that's how it works.. Never used an illusion before)  The Snow Lily Belt is hard to get, but I really like it because of the bear paw on it. What I'm doing is just leveling Leatherworking on my character to get it.. :P  That looks like a really nice set! Thanks for all the alternatives and for the reply :)"

So now I just roll all dwarves haha  But just a warning, they are pretty hard to make good looking leather sets for, so I'd be careful. One xmog set alone should not determine what race  you roll. But that being said, I'm going to try and make/post more dwarf rogue sets since mine just got to 100 and I plan on maining him in 6.2.  Look out for more of my posts in the future :)"

If you like big weapons, the 1H hammer is HUGE. It's about the same size as a medium sized 2H, so you can interchange it with that. I just thought the saber was too nifty to pass up :3"

Transmogrification,3aaw5x,Scapp,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:33:11 2015 UTC,"This is the first time I've seen Hailstorm used in a non-obnoxious way that actually works! Nice job.  I think the shield needs a bit of work. The one you have right now fits well enough, but it'd be better if it could fit with your sword and the wings on your helmet a little better. The (not-so) subtle hints of blue in some of the pieces is what makes this set awesome. I'll try and find a good shield for you, but no guarantees. Sorry!  Also, you might consider a tabard? Maybe something blue to go with the set, but it might make the blue a bit overpowering. Just something to consider :) (Tabard of the Shattered Sun isn't too bad. It's got that blue gem in it, the gold, and it adds some black to the set. Here's a picture)  EDIT: Upon further inspection, I saw that your shoulders have a bit of a green glow, which sort of clashes with the blue. I looked for a few options for you, and I found three that are alright, but your current shoulders work just as well as them. I'll list them and give you a picture just for reference, though. Here is the picture of the three shoulders (I just had the Northern Barrier shield on because I like it). Prideful Gladiator's Scaled Shoulders, Valorous Aegis Spaulders, and Swiftsteel Shoulders, respectively. Keep in mind these are just suggestions and if you're happy with the xmog, keep it the way you like it. :)"
Transmogrification,3aaw5x,Scapp,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:20:44 2015 UTC,Have you tried Northern Barrier as a shield? This is how it would look on your set. I think it has the nice gold and blue colors.

What it basically does is that it changes the gear you wear to visually replace another piece of gear. You have to own the piece of gear you want to transmog, and to do it you need to visit a transmogrification person who will transmog your gear for you at a price. There is a person in Orgrimmar, Stormwind, and Warspear. You can learn all about it if you just search it up or read the sidebar of this subreddit :)"

I start at the Icy Veins Priest Cloth Model Guide: http://www.icy-veins.com/wow/transmogrification-priest-cloth-item-models-guide I use the Wowhead.com profiler to load a toon, and then put on different items that I like from the Model Guide. If I find one I like, I check how easy it is to acquire, and through Wowhead.com I check whether there are look-a-likes (""Same model as"" tab) that are nicer or easier to get.

Transmogrification,39f3ej,IAmTheWasted,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:17:53 2015 UTC,"That's the vanilla PvP armor set for Horde cloth wearers, the original armor is still available for honor points from capital city honor vendors, however the transmogrifiable version of the armor is only sold only by Tini Smalls in Area 52 in Netherstorm.  I believe if you obtain the applicable PvP title you can then unlock the armor for purchase, but I'm not sure if the new Cataclysm versions of the titles will allow you to buy the armor, you may need to have acquired the equivalent title in vanilla before they removed the titles. I'm not certain though, as I'm not a PvPer, and the Wowhead comments on the other more prominent sets seem to indicate that achieving the Cataclysm equivalent title will also net you the armor.

The crown, I discovered, matches well enough about half the time (the other half is when the icy skull shows!) Basically I liked the ""dressy"" look of the Acherus Knight's Legplates, and tried to come up with a ""clothy-looking"" Transmog to match, without using too many pieces of the original Acherus Knight's Transmog Set. Fine Pilgrim's Hat would be an easy substitute for the Crown and may match better, but as a Death Knight I prefer the iconic look of the Crown.  Unfortunately, I won't be making this in-game anytime soon. The Chestpiece, Shirt, and even the Shoulders sell for pretty high prices on the Auction House. The guitar-axe would be even harder/pricier to obtain."

Transmogrification,38xbg2,Scapp,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:01:35 2015 UTC,You might think about rotating the sets a little in the future? It might be more appealing that way. :)
Transmogrification,38xbg2,Scapp,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:32:35 2015 UTC,"I did think of that. I will explain my choice, which can be judged as well.  As WoW Model Viewer still does not include the Mythic sets, I had to make the video in WoWHead's Dressing Room. While this does include a rotation feature, it has to be done manually with the mouse.   On 20 models, as since they follow eachother every 10 seconds, a switch in position could be very awkward to the eye. The same happens with the rotation that would not be similar in every model.  This said, I do really think you are correct. The rotation was definitely one of the things I wanted, such as the background. Unfortunately, I couldn't make it for this video.

I noticed the other day that if you want to change up the shoulders, the T16 SoO shoulders go well with the Ulduar sets--10m and LFR line up well, and 25m and Mythic do as well. I'm currently trying to scavenge weapons which will look good with those sets for my own tmog. A+ choice!"
Transmogrification,38i1t0,KushNCR,1 point,Thu Jun 4 10:28:12 2015 UTC,I personally feel monks shouldn't have bulky gear as they would need to be agile and stuff so less = more imo. Also fist weapons. I love fist weapons.

For example, the Crystalforged set is a potential starting point: http://i.imgur.com/SudXfAK.jpg  As is the white version of the DK starter out of Naxx/Uld25 (boots drop from Maly. There is no set belt and I'm too much of a DK to have remembered to even look for one): http://i.imgur.com/kz01U7a.jpg  Personally, though, I'm generally opposed to using full sets for transmog, so I started spitballing random pieces in and out in MogIt. I ended up right around here when I realized I'd better stop before this turned into A Thing that I would spend entirely too many hours tweaking and days coming back to look at leading to more hours tweaking etc: http://i.imgur.com/EhSJ96o.jpg  Hopefully that's at least a little helpful, though =]"

That armor is attached to the Ogre, and varies in multiple styles.  8-Interesting bow but I don't think it's available to players.  9-This sword belongs to the ""Jin'yu"" style of weapons and is not available.

Transmogrification,37wwn5,Luvas,4,Sun May 31 02:05:27 2015 UTC,"Here's the Armory Page also.  A load of grinding and work went into this one. I'm quite proud of it. First, it was a matter of creating a Goblin (thus going through their entertaining but extremely long tutorial questline), Pugging till 30, questing in the battlefield which name I cannot remember, Faction Changing, Pugging till 48, then running around some in the Searing Gorge (and trying to find the Eastern Plaguelands also).  Not only did I Faction Change so that I could have the Neurosurgeon's Tool cleaver-dagger, but picking a Goblin before doing so meant obtaining roughly half of a pretty unique-looking set of Leather armor, so I looked around and found an Uncommon item set that matched nicely (or at least, looked like it matched nicely when I previewed it on WoWHead). Just the journey to obtain the item set, from questing in the Goblin Tutorial, to some random battlefield, and also the Searing Gorge, was hella strenuous. However some of the quests were actually fun.  The result? Well, I think the cleavers look best on Night Elven males; they have an impressive size within their large, capable hands, and the colors, well... You can tell up close in-game that they do not match. It irks me. But it looks nice to the untrained eye, and it's not just one copy/pasted Transmog Set, which would also otherwise irk me. Lastly I was going to try the Fuzzy Headcover (the head to the recolor Discovery Armor), but it doesn't really look nice with Yngwie's Vest (a decent bit of chest shows), so I short-notice opted for an Eyepatch. Doesn't match, but hey, it's red. I also, upon using said Faction Change, tried to imitate the skin and hair color of the ""official"" Night Elf Mohawk as closely as I could.  The items I used are as follows:   Swashbuckler's Eyepatch Suntara Spaulders Inherited Cape of the Black Baron Yngwie's Vest Dancer's Belt Hatchling Handlers Borelgore's Skin S.B.R.B. Prototype 2 Glutton's Cleaver Neurosurgeon's Tool"

I just don't like them, and those things I coined off Mythic Thogar a few weeks back happened to match the color scheme okay enough. Other weapons that I like with this set: Kagraz's Burning Blade (the mythic version), The Black Hand, Ashkandi/Reclaimed Ashkandi (I prefer the latter, it's a lot less ridiculous-looking), Skullsplitter Greataxe from Firelands (either version), Blackblade/Bleakblade of Shahram from UBRS.

Transmogrification,37s7nz,PaeroPwns,1 point,Sat May 30 13:48:34 2015 UTC,It's a shame that you can't transmog daggers to swords. I can understand it for rogues (subtelty looks strange enough with a sword/mace/axe in off hand) but for mages/locks/druids daggers just don't seem to look right.
Transmogrification,37s7nz,loppol11,1 point,Sat May 30 16:49:31 2015 UTC,Can't you?  I thought they removed limitations and you can now transmog all one-hands to other one-hands.  I know you can change two-handed axes/swords/maces to polearms and even staves.

Add to that RL struggles and I just could not find the time to get this done.  But I finally got the last 2 fragments to drop tonight and I decided to finish this up.  I'm still working on a good shield match.  I was so caught up in the hammer that I forgot to get a good shield ready.  Don Gonzale's can usually be found on the AH.  I bought mine for 250g.  I chose the Lightbringer helm because I prefer the hair to be visible and it still fits the color scheme for the most part (also KT won't drop the redemption one QQ).  Gray Hair cloak has my favorite color/design for this set so I kept that around.  Sadly I cannot use Val'anyr while raiding, but it's definitely my in-town set for now.

Transmogrification,379qxg,Luvas,2,Tue May 26 00:51:10 2015 UTC,"After days/weeks of planning and searching (and after coming up with two separate ideas), I settled on a different sort of Transmog for a Tauren Paladin. Again, like a prior outfit I worked on, seeing the huge curve past Level 60, I decided I'll stick to this for quite a while.   What really sold me was the 2H sword I didn't realize existed. I tried numerous 1H weapons (paired with Sternhorn's Shield) such as Krol Blade, Giant Club, Tribal Blade and Chopping Wideblade. But the two former weapons (and how clunky they looked when sheathed at the waist) were discouraging despite their awesome size. So although I've been Protection up till 59, I might need to go Holy/Retribution (ironic, because the major reason I rolled Tauren was so I could look and be ""tanky""). I was careful to go for a look that read ""Armored, but still tribal"". The shoulders were the least ugly in their level range (other than some shoulders from PvP). The Silvershell Legs are the shortest Platelegs, and have patches of brown that suggest that only the silver pieces are the actual armor. The gloves/legs/chest are all unique and do not belong to any specific (transmoggable) Transmog Set. I thought the headdress was also like this, though it turns out that it does belong to a Transmog Set, but the tribal look of it (and the gold trim) still has its place, even if the dark color of the feathers stand out a little too much. The fur portions, lastly, are accented by the doublet. Cape I chose purely for color, the set looked too weird with a fur cape such as Raptor Scrap Cloak.  The items used were:   Vanguard Headdress Overlord's Spaulders Plate of the Shaman King Jouster's Wristguards (Almost any Wrists will do since the Gloves usually override them) Truesilver Gauntlers Commander's Girdle Thunder Bluff Doublet Champion's Cape Greatsword of the Sunwalker Crafted Dreadful Gladiator's Greaves of Alacrity (Planned/Owned but not yet equipped.

This chestpiece is the ONLY one that has this kind of ""oversized"" looked that can be transmogged, so you have to accept that Roshi wore another one of his fantastic shirts... The sunglasses are a cosmetic jewelcrafting item, so if you take this transmog for a raid, you should just tmog your helmet into a Mistdancers Helm.  Of course you should make a bald human with that long chinbeard (white hair) to start this in the first place.

Transmogrification,370c9p,FatalNForce,6,Sat May 23 18:02:48 2015 UTC,"Did you want this to be a functional transmog, meaning something you could raid or PvP in, or was this just for RP purposes? The reason I ask is that I have done a little bit of research on this set, and have run into the following issues:      These NPC's are not wearing chest armor. They are simply wearing the Rustic Workman's Shirt.       The gloves and/or bracers the NPC's are wearing do not appear to be available to players. There are some reasonable facsimile's available, such as the Spike Chain Gauntlets, but they are Mail. This creates an issue of mixing armor types, as the other matching items are Leather.       The boots as they appear on the NPC's, are not accessible to players. However, there is a suitable variation available, the Swashbuckler's Boots. The difference is these have a cuff at the top, whereas the NPC's boots do not.      The good news is that I did find the following items that matched, and they are Leather:     Oiled Leather Leggings  Blackthicket Spaulders     Hope this helps! :)"
Transmogrification,370c9p,drichatx,2,Sun May 24 00:00:35 2015 UTC,It is indeed for RP purposes so it is quite fine!  Unfortunately it is for a rogue so I will have to find an alternative glove piece that is leather.  On the other hand you have been amazingly helpful!

It's hard to make sets that aren't super bulky or made of pure plate, as a Tauren Sunwalker would likely use a variety of wood, leather and chain in their gear over solid metal.  I've made a few Sunwalker sets but never posted them. Well done!"

Transmogrification,36spnu,Bulliwyf,1 point,Fri May 22 00:39:37 2015 UTC,"I'm talking from a Lore point of view with the Tauren race themselves. As a race they use a lot of leathers, furs, and very little metal. It doesn't make sense for NPC's like Dezco or Sunwalker Jo'hsu to suddenly whip out the 'human' looking sets and wear them. To be honest, most of the Sunwalker NPC's are poorly dressed and some are even given weapons that make no sense (Hammer of the Naaru on Jo'hsu).  Some of the Sunwalker NPC's in Thunderbluff wear a metal set with red straps and fur on it and even though its the most outdated in terms of appearance, it matches the best.  /U/Luvas used a lot of 'Earth tones' in his set and stuck to matching the Thunderbluff Tabard and to be honest, it looks a lot better than most of the Sunwalker NPC's."
Transmogrification,36spnu,GentlemenHookedi,1 point,Fri May 22 01:11:57 2015 UTC,"I actually stuck with the color mainly cause of the shoulders. They were the only ones I liked. The plate of the shaman king is the only moggable part of that ""fur and metal"" set described. Covering it with a thunder bluff tabard is what led me to make this. I did attempt to match the silver of the chest, as I linked in my OP, but I also agree that I like this better."

When Valkyreon was young, he aspired to become a Paladin, through vigorous training over many years he accomplished his goal.  Throughout his training he met a young women with whom he fell in love.  When they came of age they wed and took to the battlefield together.  They fought through many battles, an unstoppable force of light, until one day, when they came face to face with a pit lord and his cadre of burning legion.  Together they led the charge with an army of soldiers at their back, and ultimately, his love fell.  Valkyreon quickly fell to madness, the light left him, but still he fought, nothing but vengeance on his mind.  When the battle had ended, Valkyreon turned from his men and left them.  After many years of solitude, he heard tale of a Lich King.  With that a Spark was lit within him, he forged for himself some new armor, offering the barest minimum of protection, and he set out eager to find death.  To this day he has still not brought about the death he seeks."

You can easily solo every raid up to Cataclysm, and probably a good part of MoP as well. You'll probably find cool weapons along the way.  The addon Mogit is very useful for browsing through every model you can use. For exemple I was looking for weapons to match my paladin T7-10, and found a 1H crafted axe and a 2H quest reward from Dire Maul that fit perfectly, that I would probably never have found without Mogit."

(You'd think there would be one, considering the Blingtrons wield one) That being said, I like this ... thingie, being a 2H Mace. It's the only category of weapon I haven't put on a character, yet. And unlike The Shoveler and Cold Iron Pick, I thought of a neat design to go along with it.  I'm okay with the whole staff-elemental thing. I did want to make a Shaman (mainly so I can play a Healer), and the design of the goblins' totems makes it synergistic with the whole mechanic theme, methinks."

It took me 5 weeks to get 5/8, missing only the gloves, chest and helm. Took 10 weeks to finally get the gloves, 17 weeks to get the chest, and after 19 straight weeks of killing both Nef and Ony, the helm finally dropped.  The helm was 50% more likely to drop because Nef drops 1 helm per kill, and Ony25 drops 2 helms per kill. It almost wasn't worth it.  Almost."

Here are the two options I ended up going with, imo they looked the most fitting for an engineer.  Supposed Mace: You get this from a questline in stranglethorn vale. It involves questing through the ships around the coast for the Bloodsail Buccaneers.  Vagaries of Time: You get this from Heroic Morchok. It's easily soloable, I even did it on 25m Heroic for the extra loot chances.  With my engineer xmog I would usually switch between those and the Peacekeeper Blade, but I see you already have that :).  Anyways, hope this helped!"

Transmogrification,34g38y,SteveCFE,5,Thu Apr 30 21:17:09 2015 UTC,"As soon as I found out that our characters would be personally commanding the Alliance Forces in Draenor I decided that my Stormwind Guard transmog needed upgrading. This is my transmog set used for Warlords of Draenor! It's themed around the Stormwind Tabard, and was made using mostly Wrath Era gear. I also have a Priest Transmog themed around the Argent Crusaders Tabard which I might share at some point!  If anyone has any suggestions for better gear, a two handed weapon, or ground/flying mounts that would work, please share them!   My headcanon is that my Warrior is the last son of a minor noble family from the Burning Steppes, with his family having lost the land when the Dark Irons set off their volcano when he was young. (Much like Morgan) He joined the Stormwind Army and rose through the ranks on account of his skill and bloodline, eventually being handpicked to lead a small regiment during the Northrend Campaign - this is where he found his Runeblade. After many campaigns (against the forces of the Lich King, the forces of Deathwing, and the forces of whoever we were fighting in Pandaria) he was promoted by the King himself, and chosen to command the Alliance Garrison in Shadowmoon Valley.   ITEM LIST  Helmet: Stormwind Helm  Shoulderguards: Cobalt Shoulders  Cloak: Sentinel's Winter Cloak  Chestpiece: Cobalt Chestpiece  Gloves: Brilliant Saronite Gauntlets  Bracers: Cobalt Bracers  Belt: Incarnadine Girdle  Legplates: Cobalt Legplates  Boots: Crustacean Stompers  Sword: Slayer of the Lifeless  Shield: Steelforged Shield (Rank 3)  Tabard: Stormwind Tabard  Shirt: Blue Lumberjack Shirt"

Transmogrification,34g38y,healu,3,Fri May 1 02:49:39 2015 UTC,Great looking set. Why not the Cape of Stormwind? Or Shawl of Shiting Probabilities. I think those would go with the theme a little more than your current cloak.
Transmogrification,34g38y,Caspira,1 point,Fri May 1 15:39:41 2015 UTC,"I have those in my void storage, and the Shawl of Shifting Probabilities was the original cape with this set.

I found these shoulders (Equilibrium Epaulets) and wanted to try to make my shaman look bad in a different way than the Dark Shaman. Like maybe this is the kind of shaman that Gul'dan would have on his team.  Hat is Headdress of the First Shaman, Chest is T1, gloves are Streamtalkers. I threw a Drillborer Disk and Emerald Ripper on to try to finish the look, but I'm not married to them.  Suggestions are welcome."

Pretty nicely done!"

Dragonstalker Leggings would work even better but I don't know how well I can take Ragnaros) Mantle of the Desert's Fury (Substituting Sparkleshell Shoulderpads for now) Lord's Cape Burnished Tunic Epic Purple Shirt"

Transmogrification,33upgi,mistweave,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:08:00 2015 UTC,I'm actually not even sure if most of the pieces shown here come in a red version. At least the shirt and leggings don't. Interesting food for thought though.
