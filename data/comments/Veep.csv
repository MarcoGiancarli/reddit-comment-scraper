Veep,3a1fk4,steveythetv,6,Tue Jun 16 14:03:57 2015 UTC,"I think the title best season is arguable.  There were some definite highlights in the season. The season opener was fantastic! The finale was also quite good. The episode where Amy left was definitely a highlight. And there were also a lot of good sub-themes and memorable moments. Jonah's sexual harassment was funny. I loved Richard being his sidekick. And that lobbying convention was good times.  That said, I think it also missed some opportunities and had a few stumbles. Mostly, the season completely failed to capitalize on the presidential race. The primary debate in Season 3 was hilarious. But in season 4, her opponent was almost as invisible as the President was in earlier seasons. I think more could have been done there. Also, while they certainly had their moments, I thought the episodes where Selena was sick and the congressional hearing episodes were great in theory, but in practice felt a bit awkward.  I love the show. And I'm looking forward to season 5. But I think the best season, in my opinion, is still season 3."
Veep,3a1fk4,KingPickle,4,Tue Jun 16 15:46:24 2015 UTC,"The congressional hearing episodes were a plot device lifted straight from The Thick of It, where I think it worked better than in Veep, because the characters in The Thick of It are much more immoral and sociopathic than those in Veep."

They were flirtatious up until the London episode (S3E7), in which Kent asks her to cancel the meeting with the royal family. Sue replies:   Sue: You have put me in a hideous situation, remotely I might add. So from now on, remotely is how we will interact.  Kent: Sue, there's no need to take that tone. I'm used to a better class of tone, so...   In the next episode, their public tiff is acknowledged. After Sue interrupts the debate prep, Kent conspicuously wanders into the room to confront her:   Kent: Sue, I cannot stress to you enough the interruptability of this meeting  Sue: Well maybe I should get my mother to sign these papers  Kent: Sue, do not test me. I do not want to have a scene here, I will not have a scene.  Rep. Furlong: Someone needs to check if they're having makeup sex   And in the final episode of season 3, the two fight for office space in the West Wing:   Sue: Sir, I don't want your office next to mine, I do not want you on top of me.  Kent: Well, I'm going to be, so work with it."

These people are professionals, not jokers or posers like Jonah, Amy, Gary, Mike and Dan.  Kent and Sue can keep their relationship outside of work, more or less.  That's one of the things I really appreciated about Veep: how understated and nuanced the dialogue and characterization can be.

Veep,39vz78,eigil,15,Mon Jun 15 14:54:14 2015 UTC,"As Gary said ""Amendments? Get it right the first time!"""
Veep,39vz78,thenewmeredith,7,Mon Jun 15 16:13:51 2015 UTC,"The issue with that is that there wasn't a guaranteed popular vote when this all started. What was envisioned was more of an indirect democracy, since the people weren't trusted to be educated enough to elect a President. So the people elected state legislators and members of the House of Representatives, and state legislators elected Senators and in many cases Presidents, with the state's electoral votes going to whomever the state legislators voted for. The 17th amendment changed it for Senators, and states pick how to apportion their electoral votes so all of them chose eventually to do it by popular vote."
Veep,39vz78,vreddy92,2,Mon Jun 15 19:14:51 2015 UTC,"The popular vote is a pretty good tie breaker, but even with how outdated the Electoral College is, it does serve a very important purpose. It spreads out the decision among all the states not just the populous ones. If you think this isn't fare you are probably living in one of those populous states. Remember the President is the leader of all the states in a union not the people. There is a distinct difference. Your state government is suppose to be tied to the people, your federal government is to run the union of states. To make sure even the small or low population states still have some say in the execute branch the electoral college gives them a much larger percentage of the vote then a straight popular election. It forces the executive branch to never forget the smaller states - which is a good thing on the whole.   So the tiebraker was designed in that spirit. The representatives of the states and through them the people will choose the president. The house of representatives is like a condensed electoral college in that sense. The senate choose the VP since the VP is nominally their leader (though by senate rules he has no power but to case a tie break vote since that is guaranteed in the constitution - the no real power thing is not law but senate rules which only takes a simple majority of the senate to pass). Interestingly the Senate and the House don't have to vote for the same ticket so the Dem VP can win with a Repub President.  If the House ties, they just revote until there is a winner. (The VP-elect [decided by the senate below] steps into power if no president is selected by inauguration day)  If the Senate ties, then the current VP casts the tie breaking vote (presumably for himself if he is on the ticket). Since there is no possible way this vote doesn't happen without a clear winner by the end of the term it is the ultimate fall back.  If the last thing happens, the VP elect becomes president by possibly voting for himself/herself and then appoints a new VP that will be approved by the Senate after the swearing in of the President."
Veep,39vz78,still-at-work,9,Mon Jun 15 18:16:08 2015 UTC,"So doesn't this mean Tom James would only be ""acting president"" until the House picked?  Unless the House picks Tom and the Senate picks Selina, which may be possible."

Veep,39vz78,typicalredditer,3,Mon Jun 15 07:36:41 2015 UTC,"There's one way around this- a faithless elector. It's actually the route I thought the show was going to go a few weeks ago.   If no ticket wins a majority of the electoral votes, the house decides the presidential race from amongst the top three vote getters. The senate chooses the vp from among the top three vote getters.   Assume one faithless elector for Myers/James switches his vote and selects Tom James for POTUS and Selena for VP.   Now the totals are O'Brian 169, Myers 168, James 1. The House could then elect Tom James in his own right as president.   Since Selena has one electoral vote as VP the senate could pick her as the #2."
Veep,39vz78,still-at-work,3,Tue Jun 16 00:29:11 2015 UTC,"No its possible, it would take a deal lock in the house on multiple votes but its possible. If the house can't give a majority to the winner by the end of the current presidential term the winner of the Senate VP vote is the new president.

James Poniewozik of Time explains the ambiguity as follows: Veep is ""almost all politics and almost no political issues"". Robert Lloyd of Los Angeles Times explains the lack of need for party affiliations, or even political ideology in a similar manner, saying that Veep is ""less a show about politics than about politicking""."

Veep,39vdmz,BrianScalabrine_AMA,6,Tue Jun 16 04:50:47 2015 UTC,what do you mean by 'no legend'?  Blue being Democrat and red being Republican is an overwhelmingly famous political convention
Veep,39vdmz,B11111,-3,Tue Jun 16 04:52:04 2015 UTC,"A legend is a part of a map or chart which indicates the definitions of certain conventions.   IRL there's been a recent shorthand about red states and blue states, but the episode was carefully made not to force that into the fictional world.

Commander-in-Chief had a Republican administration when the VP Mackenzie Allen (a political independent but also a former moderate Republican congresswoman from Connecticut) becomes President.  House of Cards is a Democrat, but Frank Underwood is a fairly  moderate Democrat, which makes sense as he's from South Carolina - what we would call a Blue Dog Democrat, which some on the far left would basically be a DINO."

Veep,38ykhf,Akronite14,2,Fri Jun 12 21:56:00 2015 UTC,Finally got a chance to watch it. Holy hell I was laughing my ass the entire 28 minutes. I do not think Bill is gone from the show. I do think it will end on a cliffhanger though was she elected or not.
Veep,38ykhf,thedictatorscut,3,Mon Jun 8 23:28:50 2015 UTC,"I love this show, but this episode made it even clearer that the Jonah sexual abuse storyline/bit is awful. Why is it funny? Am I missing something? We are making a joke about a victim. If Jonah was a female character this show would be off the air.   Again, I LOVE this show. I also LOVE Patton Oswalt, which is why I was disappointed his role was so... lame. Seriously, anybody understand why they keep pursuing this?"
Veep,38ykhf,Akronite14,22,Tue Jun 9 04:43:34 2015 UTC,"YMMV, but I actually have been really impressed with the way the Jonah storyline's been handled. I don't think the narrative is making fun of him as a victim so much as pointing out the ways that sexual abuse in government (i.e. that congressman who went after all the pages during the Bush administration - blanking on the name) tends not to be taken seriously/brushed off as ""just playing around."" If everyone were laughing at it, that'd be one thing, but there's been enough of a mixed reaction that it's more like... just a realistic depiction of the shitty way victims are treated. Like, I thought having Dan, of all people, seem genuinely upset and taken aback was an interesting choice.  Again, it's all up to personal interpretations, so feel free to disagree with me, but speaking as someone who has dealt with sexual assault and harassment in the past, I actually have a lot of good things to say about the way this plotline has been handled. The show itself is so cynical, but there have been moments like Dan calling it out as sexual abuse and Richard's throwaway line ""Well, you're probably still dealing with the emotional fallout"" that I really appreciated. (Also Furlong's look of absolute disgust in the scene when Teddy is fired! I think they made an interesting choice to have two of the biggest assholes be totally appalled by it.)"
Veep,38ykhf,thedictatorscut,2,Mon Jun 8 21:09:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply. That makes a lot of sense, though at times it genuinely feels like we are being asked to laugh at Jonah.  In their testimonial, Dan repeated a question to Jonah from the congressman about where he was touched clearly in a ""fuck you Jonah"" kinda way, so I didn't quite feel the sell of Dan being sympathetic.  The idea of them satirizing the actual treatment of harrassment victims makes sense though, especially in the context of the deposition where these incredible personal questions are being launched out of context.  A lot of the time, people act shitty to Jonah through joking about his victimhood, which can be chalked up to the characters being shitty. But I also feel like the these are jokes we are meant to laugh at, among the usual sniping and insults we see. Am I being overly sensitive? Perhaps the subject matter is making me lose track of the cynical core of the show's humor like you paraphrasedly said."
Veep,38ykhf,fireswater,12,Mon Jun 8 23:13:34 2015 UTC,"I think the issue is that they're walking a fine line by having Jonah be the victim in the first place. It's hard to empathize with him wholeheartedly, because he's still kind of a gross person who says hugely inappropriate things to other people constantly, but I also know that Tim Simons has said in interviews that he made the choice to play the storyline as straight as possible out of respect for actual abuse victims, and I think that's paid off - his performance hasn't been slapsticky and the actual harassment has never been the source of the joke; if anything, Jonah's initial denial/insistence that it's just guys being dudes turning into frustration with the way other people have been treating him has been a really interesting arc. And, I mean, not all victims are totally sympathetic people anyway, so I think it adds an extra layer of ""sometimes bad things happen to bad people and it's hard to know how to feel about them."" That plus the inherent cynicism can definitely cloud the waters here a little bit, but I don't know, I still feel okay with it in my gut, whereas I have definitely not felt as okay with assault plotlines on other shows this year (cough cough Game of Thrones).  (And I wouldn't necessarily say that Dan's been sympathetic, but the fact that he called it out as abuse the first time he witnessed it really stuck out to me. The ""Jesus Christ, does he do that to you all the time?"" scene. I thought it was an interesting touch coming from such a canonically slimy character - an ""even evil has standards"" moment, to use the TV Tropes term.)"

Veep,38ykhf,Werner__Herzog,5,Mon Jun 8 05:33:52 2015 UTC,"The episode had its moments for sure,  but it lacked a continuity.  I think the format would have done a lot better if they had at least some short cuts to the discussion between those involved outside of the court room. I think that this format would work well for the first 5 minutes or maybe even first half of the episode,  but as it went along it seemed dragged out,  lacking any real depth and really kept us out of the loop in a show where the viewer is the only one ""in on it"".    For me it was a monotonous 28 minutes with some good chuckles buried within it. It was basically 28 minutes of getting nowhere and inside jokes imo"
Veep,38ykhf,l33t_sas,9,Mon Jun 8 05:36:00 2015 UTC,"I think it was okay. But I'm a little underwelmed. On The Thick of It they did a very similar thing. They also didn't show anybody talking outside of the inquiry room, but you'd see people react in the audience when Melcolm would have spun something and people would occasionally say something that indicated what was happening on the outside. You should check it out if you didn't yet, to see what they were intending to accomplish with this episode. I think it's on hulu (but of course you'd have to watch the entire series first...)."
Veep,38ykhf,suss2it,5,Mon Jun 8 05:40:12 2015 UTC,"Anybody who is a fan of Veep should watch The Thick of It regardless. They're pretty similar in style, although Veep has pretty clearly been aimed at a more American sense of humour."

It had very believable responses and reactions from both the interrogators and interrogees, for the most part.  This was White House staff goofing about in front of the whole world. It was still hilarious, but the suspension of disbelief was at times too great."
Veep,38ykhf,samboosam,3,Mon Jun 8 23:29:38 2015 UTC,"I dunno.  I give them credit for trying a novel format.  It's like the Modern Family ep done entirely via social media.  The MF ep was a triumph, but I agree that this wasn't so much.  What bugged me is that as the knives came out as their stories conflicted and cratered is that they'd switch between live testimony in the House committee and then depositions, which would've been done weeks before the live testimony, so the inconsistencies born in the committee room couldn't have had an effect on the previously-recorded depositions.  Maybe nobody else noticed this.  I live in DC so it's probably just me."

Selina, actually, didn't ""say"" anything and they could say in her weakened state her staff went off the reservation. I say based on the look on Amy's face when Bill wouldn't let her go in the White House, and she called Selina a bitch, she has something up her sleeve.  And again, Gary offered $$$$.  He would do anything for Selina, I say he bends over."

I think Dan and Amy are either going to make things much worse or somehow save everyone… or at least Jonah since those three are testifying together. Or Richard will somehow incriminate himself in things he wasn't involved in because he's just super enthusiastic to testify."

Especially in the middle of an election, it's not exactly a sign of confidence that Selina, the President, can't get a bill that she wanted passed.

But assuming it was a bad bill, who brought it to the floor for a vote months before an election? It only kind of makes sense to me if Congress on the show is controlled by the opposite party, who brought the bill to be voted on as a symbolic move to show Selina's weakness. But the way the show portrayed it, the vote was a dead heat with undecideds, so it shows the House of Representatives took it seriously at least.  Selina's campaign wanted it to fail so they could campaign against the other side for killing the bill, but they needed a couple of people in Selina's party including Pierce for the deciding vote, which weakens their case. The way I see it, sabotaging the bill hurt their election chances way more because of how the media would spin it as an embarassment for Selina and now the House bringing on investigations."

Veep,385592,rflairfan1,4,Mon Jun 1 23:10:37 2015 UTC,"Disagree.  I said the other night to my husband, this season they humor is not as blatantly funny, but is defiantly more interesting.  And there is the fact that she is president, and there is more at stake now. But when things go to hell, which is often, it is hilarious"
Veep,385592,JJulie,4,Tue Jun 2 00:20:11 2015 UTC,Loving it
Veep,385592,OneOfDozens,3,Tue Jun 2 01:06:42 2015 UTC,I expected this season to change as much as it has with Selina's new role.
Veep,385592,wundaii,4,Mon Jun 1 23:34:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Sue not being the stationary gatekeeper is strangely unsettling. This season has a lot more ""action"" going on...whereas I've always appreciated the past seasons' ability to have somewhat slow plots but cram in a lot of humorous jokes and asides. There's also the shift in power...from being the veep who can't even get a phone call from the president, to the president who's gleefully shafting the veep, though obviously, the show is riffing off the theme that even as president, Selina is still hamstrung. I wouldn't say the 4th season is worse off, though...it's just different."
Veep,385592,danwin,2,Mon Jun 1 23:11:21 2015 UTC,"As long as the character development makes sense (I'm looking at you, The Office), I enjoy change. They could have gone with 8 seasons of Selina as Veep, but that would have gotten boring and predictable in a hurry."
Veep,385592,CrazyEdward,2,Tue Jun 2 13:42:24 2015 UTC,"Valid criticisms all but I still am loving the season. I think we'll have a better understanding of it all at the end.  It sounds like you prefer the character-driven show to the plot-driven show... and this season they've introduced a ton of new characters but we don't get to spend time with any of them... instead the plot has been hurtling us forward.  But I think that's more like what it feels to be the president... everyone really is always running around, roles are constantly changing, it's chaotic."
Veep,385592,bigmooseextreme,2,Sun Jun 7 14:56:46 2015 UTC,"To me, its better than its ever been (and its consistently pretty great) The writing and the delivery is spot on. I think the movement of Dan and Amy to a B story is smart, giving other talent the ability to play a bigger role in the verbal sparring (Ben, Richard, and most surprisingly Henry James)"
Veep,385592,BoredExNewYorker,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:35:11 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%. I am a huge fan of Veep and JLD, but this season they have lost their way. By moving Dan, Amy and Jonah out of the mix, the magic of the ensemble is lost. There have been some good scenes, but def not as funny."
Veep,37qx6p,edible_building,7,Fri May 29 18:01:11 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure you're correct. The data leak was caused by a low level employee (who stopped working there before the repercussions of the leak) who I assume distributed the info to the departments/people who used the info (for flyers/HIV anecdote) assuming that the info was obtained legally.  Basically, a lot of people dropped the ball when it came to having HIV girl's info going public. Bill Ericsson kind of goes over it when talking to Ben in the episode ""Data""--he lists a few things like, ""Why didn't we have the girls' parents' permission to talk about her?"" A bunch of obvious steps were missed which would have stopped the public from finding out about the data leak.  Someone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong!"
Veep,37qx6p,ohmygogh,4,Fri May 29 20:52:08 2015 UTC,"My impression was that Selina's campaign office used the secret data obtained from the White House to target flyers & letters towards bereaved parents. Then this sensitive data was breached by hackers. Now, I'm thinking it's only a matter of time when the hackers/press realize that Selina's team used this secret info to target those ads and that's why they were freaking out about going to Federal prison.  I think the HIV girl incident is totally different where the press connected the dots from Selina's speech and discovered the girl's identity. The data breach has nothing to do with the HIV girl."
Veep,37qx6p,sed_base,5,Fri May 29 21:12:43 2015 UTC,The HIV girl is definitely part of the hacking/data breach---Ben says so right after it breaks and a reporter asks an unknowing Selina about it (and Richard confirms it later when talking to Dan). The hacker came from within the White House. That's why they fire Leigh and Dan (scapegoats since the real hacker stopped working there a while ago).
Veep,37qx6p,ohmygogh,3,Sat May 30 05:02:24 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your explanation. You and /u/sed_base have cleared it up for me but a few more questions linger: Why would the HIV girl be on that mailing list if her parents aren't recently bereaved?  I understand that the larger leak was from the Family First mailing list, and that a lot of this plot has not yet been revealed so I'll watch on, and hopefully edit the main post once it's all divulged."
Veep,37qx6p,ohmygogh,5,Sat May 30 01:48:40 2015 UTC,No problem--I knew all of my re-watching would pay off somehow! The HIV girl wasn't on the mailing list. The data leak just provided the information that Selina used in that on-camera interview. The mailer issue is a second problem stemming from the leak.  I think you're right… this whole data issue is probably going to keep expanding with a lot of repercussions.
Veep,37qx6p,ohmygogh,3,Sat May 30 04:18:11 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling Tom James is going to use this as leverage or divulge it somehow in like a book deal or something. In the Storms episode he was talking to a publicist or an editor on the phone on the way back to the limo, as though he was writing his autobiography."
Veep,37qx6p,JJulie,2,Sat May 30 04:22:36 2015 UTC,Yes! Tom James is definitely not the ultra-likeable guy he's been portraying. He's shady!
Veep,37qx6p,RegularJohn263,3,Sat May 30 04:54:33 2015 UTC,Spoiler tags are not working for me but this link gives an episode description of the second to the last episode. This could be an indication of things to come for her staff.  http://www.spoilertv.com/2015/05/the-spoilertv-daily-newsreel-28th-may.html
Veep,37qx6p,JJulie,3,Sat May 30 13:22:35 2015 UTC,I think HIV girl and the hacking scandal are two separate things.
Veep,37qx6p,ohmygogh,3,Sun May 31 07:03:55 2015 UTC,I am getting them confused.  Deleted scene from last week.  Iannucci posted this on his twitter. Seemed to think it was important.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpCwHCh6QDc
Veep,37qx6p,JJulie,3,Sun May 31 15:54:27 2015 UTC,"They're not. Think of it like this…The hacking happened and that caused the two separate, but related incidents:  1) HIV girl (major news story that went public due to redditors figuring out who the girl was based on what Selina said in that interview; scandalous issue, but not illegal which is why they fired Dan)   2) Campaign mailers (which is still a secret at this point because it was illegal)"
Veep,37qx6p,vreddy92,2,Sun May 31 20:06:45 2015 UTC,Thanks.  It really is confusing.  You have to wonder what is going to come out next.
Veep,37mpd6,danwin,29,Thu May 28 19:27:44 2015 UTC,It'd be a waste to have Matt Walsh as a series regular on a comedy and not allow him to improvise!
Veep,37mpd6,katiebug88,18,Thu May 28 20:08:03 2015 UTC,"There was a recent yahoo screen interview with most of the cast recently and they described the process. Basically the writers do a script, which is then ironed out in rehearsal. During rehearsal, the actors are allowed to improvise despite the script and the writers are present to see which bits work and if there's anything they'd like to incorporate. They don't write it down or record it, just remember it if they liked it and then add it to the next version of the script. So they write another script and then rehearse that. And you get to the final shoots. They end up shooting over 110 minutes each episode, which they edit down to 28 minutes, which is another reason the show is on a rapid-firing pace all the time."
Veep,37mpd6,edible_building,16,Fri May 29 05:00:41 2015 UTC,"Now you mention it, i felt i really really need to see those one hundred minute episodes"
Veep,37mpd6,trongkien,5,Fri May 29 11:10:20 2015 UTC,I know in the Thick of it they'd do two takes exactly as on script and then do a third take where the actors were free to improvise a bit more.
Veep,37mpd6,YoureASoldierBodie,3,Thu May 28 23:28:39 2015 UTC,"Every scene is rehearsed with the actors improvising things to make it funnier if possible. This whole process is observed by the writers, who take notes of the improvisations they feel work and incorporated to the shooting scripts.   This is what they call ""workshopping"" so it's sort of a semi-improv, semi-written sort of thing."
Veep,37hr8p,Magic_Horse_Balls,22,Wed May 27 18:54:24 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of this guy before, but I feel like Veep is going finally springboard him into something big in the near future.   Apparently he was in We're The Millers and Horrible Bosses 2, but I don't quite remember that.   But he is hilarious and I think he fits the role very well on the show."
Veep,37hr8p,smackythefrog,6,Wed May 27 22:36:23 2015 UTC,I've seen both of those movies but don't remember him.
Veep,37hr8p,rflairfan1,16,Thu May 28 01:16:37 2015 UTC,He has been my favorite thing about this season. That's saying a lot when the whole cast is this talented and delightful. Pairing him with Jonah was a stroke of genius. They play so well of each other.
Veep,37hr8p,ToadvineFresh,15,Thu May 28 14:12:49 2015 UTC,"I loved that quote:   In my family, basketball is a religion. Also Catholicism. That's actually the main one.    And that one about taking care of / shooting lame ducks."
Veep,37hr8p,doegred,12,Thu May 28 23:16:27 2015 UTC,Never fails to make me laugh. He's got that going for him where I almost laugh just looking at him.
Veep,37hr8p,meh100,13,Wed May 27 22:48:40 2015 UTC,Richard: You know I was thinking we could stop for a coffee...  Jonah: Teddy's been touching me...  Richard: ...or tea.   Got to give someone credit for being able to steal a scene from Jonah.
Veep,37hr8p,danwin,20,Thu May 28 02:55:50 2015 UTC,"I love his childish giggle when Tom James says ""So you're this guy's veep, huh?""  Also, right before that, ""Richard T. Splett"" is probably my favorite bit of him. As usual with this show, great writing and great performance."
Veep,37hr8p,Severian427,8,Wed May 27 22:48:54 2015 UTC,I'd love to see a Splett/Jonah spinoff. They could have their own little adventures in Youtube while we wait for Season 5!
Veep,37hr8p,lancelot482,8,Thu May 28 02:21:58 2015 UTC,i usually hate the character trope of well meaning oblivious doofus. but holy shit is this character well written and  performed. the timing is impeccable.
Veep,37hr8p,bigtallguy,3,Thu May 28 08:17:03 2015 UTC,"They've really upped the quality of his character this season. Last season he was kind of unbearable when paired with Amy, but he's playing off Jonah quite well this season."
Veep,37hr8p,SepticReVo,3,Thu May 28 02:01:44 2015 UTC,"Pairing him off with Jonah is gold. When he was playing opposite Amy, it felt a little more awkward and how he was just being shouted at."
Veep,37hr8p,edible_building,6,Fri May 29 17:51:28 2015 UTC,I had to Snapchat the BRING BACK MY PIG moment. Channeling Ron Burgundy so well.
Veep,37hr8p,jcast747,2,Thu May 28 00:20:49 2015 UTC,I couldn't agree more. I literally just came to this subreddit to make the same comment.
Veep,37hr8p,celebrategoodtymes,2,Fri May 29 07:25:47 2015 UTC,Brilliant casting.
Veep,37f0ba,BumBumiLikeBum,19,Wed May 27 03:35:59 2015 UTC,"They're already renewed for season 5 so it's not ending after this season. I hope Selina stays POTUS and Amy and Dan come back to work for her, that'd be my ideal scenario."
Veep,37f0ba,KenNoisewater_PHD,15,Wed May 27 04:52:53 2015 UTC,Tom James somehow becomes Potus and Selina remains Veep?  I have no idea how they woud do that mind...
Veep,37f0ba,mulkabu,9,Wed May 27 08:38:32 2015 UTC,"The series is kinda going in this direction, isn't it? Tom James is depicted as the more competent and well liked politician."
Veep,37f0ba,CptFizz,4,Wed May 27 12:26:39 2015 UTC,Political-wise and reputation-wise I don't think Selina can step down from being POTUS to being a Veep again.
Veep,37f0ba,herrdunphy,6,Wed May 27 13:42:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's such a blatantly unrealistic outcome that I don't think I could continue watching if they did it. Lack of real world precedent aside, Meyer was quite clear that she wouldn't go back to being Veep. Crazy stuff happens in this show, but they're always able to maintain a certain level of plausibility and consistent characterization."
Veep,37f0ba,SpiffyShindigs,14,Wed May 27 14:03:18 2015 UTC,She'd rather get shot in the fucking face.
Veep,37f0ba,SylvesterMcMonkey,2,Wed May 27 14:24:16 2015 UTC,I don't get the impression that they care too much about realism...

Veep,37f0ba,bigupurself7,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:13:00 2015 UTC,You have it right. So the house can't decide on a president so the Senate which is heavy Democrat picks her VP candidate and he becomes President.
Veep,37f0ba,Epircus,7,Wed Jun 17 15:29:23 2015 UTC,I think it will turn out Tom James will be a pseudo dick Cheney where Selina is now being constantly undermined by him and successful at it.
Veep,37f0ba,eigil,4,Wed May 27 07:24:41 2015 UTC,"This season has been setting up so much, I don't know what's a red herring and what's not. Veep in general is so unpredictable, I just don't know. When season 3 began, I would not have guessed in a million years that it would have ended with Selina suddenly becoming president.  So, there are things like that data breach that might wind up getting all the characters in trouble. Echoes of Nixon and Watergate. So many people at the top know about this data breach and are covering it up. Selina's career is over and she might get impeached or resign first and who knows. If Tom James has actually become the interim vice-president because Doyle after ""Convention"" stepped down from office immediately rather than serve the remainder of his lame duck term, then maybe Tom James becomes the new president like Gerald Ford.  Or the show follows a GOP POTUS. In ""Convention"" they did make a big deal over the running mate being Latina. I could see someone like Sofia Vergara or Eva Longoria replacing JLD as the new lead, but that seems lazy and too much like a jump-the-shark moment, so I don't think this will happen.  My guess is that next season, Selina wins a term in her own right and the show becomes like a comedic West Wing, following both Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Hugh Laurie as co-leads."
Veep,37f0ba,CaptnYossarian,1 point,Wed May 27 05:18:12 2015 UTC,"The Thick of It did the pivot to the ""other side"" so well, I wouldn't be surprised if it did switch to the GOP side. Different set of issues to champion, different side of politics to lampoon (fight with the Tea Party etc), it would be worth it."
Veep,37f0ba,tissot,3,Sun May 31 23:50:54 2015 UTC,"With Amy and Dan working for Lobbyist and Mike looking increasingly dissatisfied with the way he is treated, I could see them shifting focus on the lobbying business."

Veep,374hka,Milk-EyedMender,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:11:46 2015 UTC,"Agree. I think if Seinfeld was in its prime later like in the 2000s, like House and AD were. We would be thinking the same about Elaine.   In last weeks episode, Tom diagnosed Mike of something and reminded me House. I'm pretty sure the writers had him say it because of his previous work.   I think Gary is very similar to Buster. Which is why we see Buster more, especially with his relationship to Selina or Lucille."
Veep,374hka,nwpluviophile,45,Sun Jun 7 16:26:51 2015 UTC,I really enjoyed the touch of honesty and serious tone of Tom James talking about his son as well as his reaction to what the breach was - it was a nice change of pace for the show.

Gary would also whisper talking points for small talk like that time when she visits the military base & Selina is shaking hands with the soldiers. Her small-talk game is solid at that time

Right now she's sweeping it under the rug, trying to redirect the attention onto herself but I don't see how much longer she can keep it up.   I can definitely see her having a huge meltdown as Tom's popularity grows and she realizes she's awful at her job and has sent away everyone who was close to her / giving her good counsel cuz she's just an awful person who's gotten extremely lucky.   Couple plot things, I loved Ben trying to talk to Sue and be friends because he misses everyone.   The last bit of the episode where Tom made a bad call to go to North Carolina was brilliant. Totally humanized him at a point where it seemed like he could do no wrong.

Veep,36ba74,sed_base,19,Sat May 23 14:45:14 2015 UTC,Can't wait to see if Amy & Dan team up against Selina. They have some serious dirt on her.
Veep,36ba74,ohmygogh,8,Mon May 18 00:17:43 2015 UTC,Why would they team up against Selina? They would wanna work with her to gain influence for their clients? UNLESS.. They're planning on blackmailing her into working with them. Dang!
Veep,36ba74,sed_base,19,Mon May 18 05:25:18 2015 UTC,Where has Bill Ericsson disappeared to? I miss his smart ass-ness.
Veep,36ba74,zombarista,12,Mon May 18 03:01:01 2015 UTC,Kent was a bit low-key with his remarks as well
Veep,36ba74,CrazyEdward,18,Mon May 18 05:28:05 2015 UTC,"Tom is NOT forgetful at all, as evidenced by the ""soy milk"" and his very good banter with his constituents and colleagues.  He was playing dumb when she was coaxing the fuck story out of him.  His memory is being foreshadowed as an important plot element as evidenced by Tom saying ""Fun fact, that is used as a truth serum...""  He knows something important.  Something bad is going to happen, and it's going to happen to Selina...  I think Tom knows he has tons of dirt on Selina, and as someone else mentioned, they might change spots on the ticket..."
Veep,36ba74,zombarista,5,Mon May 18 22:21:25 2015 UTC,I'm with you that Tom remembers that night more than he lets on. Selina's earlier implication was that they actually had sex (she was one of his skeletons) but the story seems a lot more complicated now...
Veep,36ba74,dangerousdave,4,Tue May 19 03:36:58 2015 UTC,"I know the show is a comedy, but this is getting a little dark for me.  I don't like watching Selina's world spin out of control."
Veep,36ba74,samboosam,2,Tue May 19 04:04:48 2015 UTC,ahahahahahhahaha I'm just going to imagine your cringing reactions from now on.

Veep,36ba74,aeyuth,14,Mon May 18 05:10:02 2015 UTC,I loved that scene with Amy and Dan in the parking garage. Fantastic.
Veep,36ba74,trongkien,3,Mon May 18 04:11:15 2015 UTC,I loved watching Amy and Purcell on the same side.
Veep,36ba74,herrdunphy,4,Mon May 18 04:22:12 2015 UTC,How the tables have turned. When Sidney purcell and amy first met in season 1.obviously amy just wishes to distance herself as far from him as possible.  Plus its always a delight to see rogers Furlong and Sidney spilling out the most obnoxious lines
Veep,36ba74,macrovore,12,Mon May 18 10:02:41 2015 UTC,"It was a good episode, but I do miss the gang when they're together. I have realized that the beauty of this show is in the ensemble."
Veep,36ba74,Aqquila89,49,Tue May 19 00:43:37 2015 UTC,"Calling it now: Meyer and James switch spots on the ticket, so we can actually have a Veep season 5."
Veep,36ba74,survivor00,16,Mon May 18 05:50:18 2015 UTC,I think that'd be too unrealistic. It has never happened in the history of the United States. And Selina is too proud to do something like that.
Veep,36ba74,FilthyMenshevik,8,Mon May 18 15:52:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah how would that even work? Selina was the one who was officially given the nomination at the Democratic Convention, after which she picked Tom as a VP, which is usually how it goes. How can they switch when Tom wasn't the one that was voted for?"
Veep,36ba74,Aqquila89,7,Mon May 18 22:21:37 2015 UTC,"Going by the Veep playbook: the candidates appear in the wrong order on the ballot, due to a fuckup with putting their names in alphabetical order. That's outlandish, but it's also a TV show, and basically everyone involved with Selina's office is terrible at their jobs (with the exception of Sue.)  Alternate theory: everything after Kent telling Selina that she's going to be president in season 3 has been a dream. I only say that because of the ridiculous montage of her first weeks as PotUS in the last episode of season 3."
Veep,36ba74,survivor00,8,Tue May 19 05:48:33 2015 UTC,"everything after Kent telling Selina that she's going to be president in season 3   This would be my reaction to that.   They wouldn't do that. The oldest, lamest trick in the book. Never. They have more integrity."
Veep,36ba74,walkingtheriver,3,Tue May 19 07:21:43 2015 UTC,"If they did the dream cop-out, it'd be so horrible and unforgivable that I'd actually find it great."
Veep,36ba74,macrovore,1 point,Tue May 19 06:05:51 2015 UTC,"with the exception of Sue   She might act like she's good at her job, but she really isn't. She lacks most morals and disrespects her superiors constantly"
Veep,36ba74,eigil,4,Sun Jun 7 13:30:59 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but Tom is so friggin' popular.  He seems to be at least willing to be Veep, but the media is literally all about him."
Veep,36ba74,CrazyEdward,7,Mon May 18 17:27:41 2015 UTC,"It's not unheard of for the running mate be more popular than the presidential candidate. Sarah Palin was arguably more popular than John McCain was in 2008, getting more media coverage and much higher crowds at campaign rallies.  Actually, I can see some parallels between fiction and reality here. Palin was chosen because the McCain campaign desperately wanted to counter Barack Obama's star power. Selina's campaign scrambled to finally settle on Tom because they were unnerved by the other guy choosing a running mate who was Latina."
Veep,36ba74,Aqquila89,2,Mon May 18 18:48:10 2015 UTC,I'm with you. Lot of chatter about how Selina somehow becomes Veep again... but I can't see any way she'd subject herself to that humiliation. Would be completely out of character and unrealistic.  I'd say we're more likely to see the show turn to focus on James... but even that seems unlikely.
Veep,36ba74,aeyuth,3,Tue May 19 03:29:26 2015 UTC,Selina already decided in season 2 that she'd rather retire than be Veep again.
Veep,36ba74,Aqquila89,2,Tue May 19 07:22:55 2015 UTC,"She voted against her own clean jobs bill, she was never gonna say ""as a woman"" during the POTUS-prolife incident, etc. The way things turn out to have her act opposite to how she thinks she will makes the show.  Would you agree?"
Veep,36ba74,aeyuth,1 point,Wed May 20 19:44:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but as I've said before, it'd be way too unrealistic to switch places on the ticket - this is unheard of in American politics. I'd be very disappointed in the showrunners if they did this."
Veep,36ba74,OneOfDozens,1 point,Wed May 20 19:51:48 2015 UTC,"I agree it's too easy.  Although... They may very well pull it off, very talented writers."
Veep,36ba74,Aqquila89,2,Wed May 20 20:03:51 2015 UTC,There's never been a woman president
Veep,36ba74,aeyuth,8,Mon May 18 16:09:46 2015 UTC,But it's not at all unlikely right now that the next one will be a woman. Presidential and vice presidential candidate switching spaces mid-campaign - that's ridiculous.
Veep,36ba74,xqueenfrostine,1 point,Mon May 18 16:26:08 2015 UTC,First time for everything.
Veep,36ba74,OneOfDozens,0,Wed May 20 19:40:24 2015 UTC,"Not the same thing.    If this was happening before their convention, a switch could have happened because that's when the party gets together to decide who they want to represent them. At this point, it wouldn't be legally possible to change who is where on the ticket without Selina's consent.  And even then it might not be possible.  There's a reason why candidates who have died or dropped out sometimes still appear on the ballot come election day.  After certain cut off dates, ballots are finalized and no changes are allowed to be made."
Veep,36ba74,BoredExNewYorker,2,Tue May 19 05:14:49 2015 UTC,Oh the only way I'd see it happening would be her being convinced she can't win as pres  Maybe Amy and Dan come up with a campaign destroying her and promoting him
Veep,36ba74,BoredExNewYorker,7,Tue May 19 13:37:14 2015 UTC,I like that idea. Plus the story arc this year is pretty thin. The only continuity is that she is running for election. I think her losing it on Tom is likely.
Veep,36ba74,aeyuth,6,Mon May 18 14:20:49 2015 UTC,Tony Hale (Gary) is killing it as usual. He was so funny in this episode. Uncrossing his legs on the bus.. Lol.
Veep,36ba74,TensionMask,3,Mon May 18 14:22:22 2015 UTC,"What did it mean that Tom didn't react to Selina mentioning ""that night""?  Was he blackout drunk or something? Why was Selina upset?  edit: spelling"
Veep,36ba74,sed_base,18,Mon May 18 04:11:32 2015 UTC,Just that it was so not a big deal to him that he doesn't even remember.
Veep,36ba74,Aqquila89,19,Mon May 18 04:18:07 2015 UTC,"Oh, I thought that he did remember but just that he didn't see it as sexual tension at all. Selina's side of the incident is that she got out of the cab & saw that Tom got out too so perhaps that was going to lead to sex. Tom's perspective was that he got out at the same time as Selina because he loves to walk at night and wanted to walk home. I don't know, perhaps I'm not able to read between the lines on this one."
Veep,36ba74,PhinsPhan89,12,Mon May 18 05:35:18 2015 UTC,"Which is especially humiliating to Selina, because - as we could see -  Tom remembers everything about people he only met once. He doesn't need a Gary."
Veep,36ba74,scuczu,4,Mon May 18 14:33:25 2015 UTC,Or he's really embarrassed about what happened.
Veep,36ba74,PhinsPhan89,3,Mon May 18 05:05:42 2015 UTC,"I got that feeling, like he remembered, and remembered he forgot about it on purpose, and tried to be gentle about mostly forgetting it."
Veep,36ba74,Heinz_Tomato_Ketchup,1 point,Mon May 18 16:38:41 2015 UTC,Pretty much what I thought.
Veep,35qqkt,maxwdn,20,Tue May 12 19:00:21 2015 UTC,Well this was clearly about Karen.
Veep,35qqkt,Ausrufepunkt,38,Wed May 13 11:23:12 2015 UTC,"serious props have to be given to anna chlumsky for this scene. i'm definitely reading into this a little too much, but i especially love how she sounded choked up when she was talking about how there will never be another woman president - because amy is obviously someone who would like to see that again, you know? and the fact that she works (well, worked) for someone who is not doing that effort any favors is fucking killing her. (i'm not making any sense, am i?)  but this scene was great."
Veep,35qqkt,pukerock,12,Wed May 13 03:13:24 2015 UTC,"As I've said before, I think it must have hurt Amy that when she delivered what she considered to be the final, devastating blow, Selina just sat there with a bored expression, eating a piece of chocolate. We know she got under Selina's skin, because she asked Tom James to be her running mate and fired Karen, but she did a good job looking unimpressed."
Veep,35qqkt,Aqquila89,17,Wed May 13 11:53:04 2015 UTC,"I think Amy could tell, having been Selina's chief of staff and trusted adviser for so long. She probably knows Selina better than even Gary, because Gary has a too romanticized ideal of her while Amy sees who she really is.  Also, throughout most of the speech, you could see Selina was silently seething through her steely gaze. And when Amy dealt that final blow, Selina broke and had to do an overly exaggerated flippant expression while doing something else like grabbing for a piece of chocolate, like a not-very-convincing poker face. It's like when you're in school and some bully says something really cruel but the sucky part is that you know it's true, you try to act like you're unfazed but inside you want to cry. That was Selina."
Veep,35qqkt,eigil,9,Wed May 13 16:31:26 2015 UTC,"And when Amy dealt that final blow, Selina broke and had to do an overly exaggerated flippant expression    I don't know, it seemed to be that it was at that point that she managed to calm herself and pretend to look bored. Before, she looked visibly angry, as you've noted.  By the way, Amy is not really in a position to take the moral high ground, is she? I mean, she essentially said that America couldn't have a worse president than Selina, but so far, she worked tirelessly to have her reelected. She's even worse than Selina from that point of view: Selina is incompetent, but believes that she isn't. Amy fully knows that Selina is a disaster, yet works to ensure four more years for her, just to further her own career."
Veep,35qqkt,Aqquila89,6,Wed May 13 17:21:39 2015 UTC,"That's an excellent point. I suppose it might be chalked up to a little bit of party tribalism, a little bit of optimism, and a little bit of blind ambition. When Selina was VP and powerless, it was probably easier to forgive her deficiencies, but now that she's lucked herself into a position of power it's becoming dangerous. Amy used Selina's presidential run to further her own career, but maybe she was also a loyal member of their party and believed that Selina in the White House was preferable to the other party.  But then there just comes a point where you have a Nicole Wallace/ Sarah Palin moment when it becomes too obvious the emperor has no clothes and you have to walk away."
Veep,35qqkt,eigil,17,Wed May 13 18:05:29 2015 UTC,that is super awesome
Veep,35qqkt,Tanderix,18,Tue May 12 19:35:57 2015 UTC,Anna Chlusmky. For your Emmy® consideration.
Veep,35qqkt,benmal,3,Wed May 13 17:28:34 2015 UTC,"definitely, with all her other reactions to Karen as well throughout the episode I reckon she's a huge contender with this episode"
Veep,35qqkt,vmanthegreat,14,Fri May 15 14:51:54 2015 UTC,"My collegue is thinking of quitting his job because they hired someone who kisses ass, and after showing him this scene it gave him courage to do something like this"
Veep,35qqkt,Baltron9000,6,Tue May 12 23:59:09 2015 UTC,"Amazing. I wonder if this theme of betraying the campaing team for outsiders and old friends is something that they are drawing from all politics, or is there a specific president that they are modeling?  Man, I don't know shit about politics."
Veep,35qqkt,not_slim_shaddy,5,Tue May 12 22:21:09 2015 UTC,Mic drop. exit stage left
Veep,35qqkt,Salterian,14,Wed May 13 01:58:24 2015 UTC,"This was an epic moment.  I wonder what they're going to do now that Dan and Amy are both off the team.  I'm guessing next she jettisons Mike and maybe Sue (not Gary; never Gary), then she ends up losing the nomination but gets tapped for VP again.  Then the whole team sadly crawls back to the same spot where they all started."
Veep,35qqkt,eigil,19,Tue May 12 20:38:19 2015 UTC,She can only lose the election at this point. The convention was the end point of the nominating process. Selina is her party's presidential nominee and Tom James is her VP running mate.
Veep,35qqkt,Aqquila89,6,Tue May 12 22:21:39 2015 UTC,"I think she'll win, because Veep was renewed for a fifth season, and if Selina loses the election, what the hell will that be about? Selina in her retirement?"
Veep,35qqkt,kiac,-2,Wed May 13 11:51:22 2015 UTC,"As salterian said, she might go back to Veep.  E: Alright I realise why this is wrong now, duh. Not my fault the show skipped over the nomination result. Downvoting was just a bit rude, reply with a correction."
Veep,35qqkt,skerit,-2,Wed May 13 17:13:51 2015 UTC,"Huh? Haven't seen veep in a while, but the way the episode blurps were written it looked to me as if she had already won.   s04e01 - Selina's staff frantically works on her first major speech as president; Gary questions his worth s04e02 - The president's staff prepares for her state visit with the Israeli prime minister s04e04 - President Meyer travels to Iran, where an American reporter is being detained   So IMDB is just full of shit, then?"
Veep,35qqkt,Severian427,8,Wed May 13 06:47:56 2015 UTC,"She stepped in the president's shoes after he unexpectedly resigned (end of S3), but at the same time she's preparing for the next election and hopes that she will actually be elected."
Veep,35qqkt,VanSensei,5,Wed May 13 07:44:00 2015 UTC,"She just filled in for POTUS. Same thing happened in the UK - Tony Blair resigns, so Gordon Brown becomes the new PM starting in 2007. In 2010, he loses to David Cameron."
Veep,35qqkt,YoureASoldierBodie,8,Thu May 14 11:08:35 2015 UTC,Maybe Dan and Amy become Hugh Laurie's staff. And the focus shifts back to the new Veep towards the end of the season ready for the next season.
Veep,35qqkt,Cyer_bot,6,Wed May 13 18:19:59 2015 UTC,Lol turning VEEP into a 'Dr. Who'-esque type of show where it revolves around the new Veeps rather than Selina would be something.

Veep,35jtk8,YoureASoldierBodie,4,Mon May 11 19:47:24 2015 UTC,Aww that was super cute.  Of course the show cuts loose anyone even close to being an honorable character. If she stuck around she would just be corrupted...
Veep,35l06e,meisterkeister,7,Mon May 11 10:42:39 2015 UTC,"I don't mean this to demean the writers of the show, because the writing is usually fantastic. That said, if the plan all along was for her to get the nomination, then they backed themselves into a corner having her lose Iowa and New Hampshire. Would have been very difficult to play out her path to victory. Better to just skip ahead and hope people don't question it too hard."
Veep,35l06e,BruinsMurph,15,Mon May 11 12:30:35 2015 UTC,They did give some good reason for it. Brokering a peace deal with Israel and setting an American hostage free would surely make voters lean your way.
Veep,35l06e,BruinsMurph,3,Mon May 11 12:48:20 2015 UTC,That's true. I guess my point is less that it's implausible she could win the nomination. But that actually playing it out over the course of the season would be a long slog.
Veep,35l06e,sed_base,2,Mon May 11 12:54:39 2015 UTC,They're already 5 episodes in. I guess their plan is to focus the next 8 episodes more on her antics during the general election against that baseball coach & his latina running mate.
Veep,35l06e,CrazyEdward,7,Mon May 11 16:48:33 2015 UTC,"Actually they said ""Senator O'Brian"" and not Thornhill... there was a Senator O'Brian in a prior episode but not related to this election... so I'm not really sure what the Latina running mate story was all about except as setup for the Doyle replacement story."
Veep,35l06e,BruinsMurph,3,Tue May 12 04:13:32 2015 UTC,Wasn't she running against the baseball coach in the primary? I don't think we know anything about her opponent in the general.
Veep,35l06e,globalglasnost,1 point,Mon May 11 16:54:54 2015 UTC,"im actually glad the writers didnt focus too much on the state conventions and the overall nomination process, it did jolt my suspension of disbelief a bit but i just chalked it up to what you said and also the fact that i think they were eager to get rid of the Thai ladyboy haircut"
Veep,35l06e,jlesnick,1 point,Mon May 11 17:15:17 2015 UTC,"She lost as VP, then she became the acting President.  Then she had success as President.  That's why.  It's not that nuts under the circumstances.  Becoming the acting President catapulted her."
Veep,35l06e,BruinsMurph,3,Mon May 11 21:13:36 2015 UTC,She lost Iowa as VP. She lost NH as POTUS.
Veep,35l06e,dickensmw,3,Mon May 11 23:45:25 2015 UTC,"Ok, so I wasn't the only one unclear on this. I have the same question. Throughout the episode, I just assumed that she got her party's nomination."
Veep,35l06e,eigil,2,Mon May 11 11:46:55 2015 UTC,It was safe to assume she got her party's nomination since the episode focused on her and her team deciding on a running mate.  Losing candidates after the primary/caucus season don't typically choose running mates for themselves during their party's nominating convention.
Veep,35l06e,4011,1 point,Mon May 11 18:21:34 2015 UTC,She officially won the nomination at the convention. That's what happens at conventions.
Veep,35l06e,dlopez1196,-1,Sat Jun 13 01:48:17 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking she has it on paper, but with all the shakeups, I see Danny Chung announcing a renewed candidacy and staging a floor fight for the delegates, eventually winning and Selina begrudgingly takes his offer for veep. I mean, if the show's premise is Selina as an unhappy veep, 1) she has to be veep, and 2) Danny Chung is the ultimate POTUS to piss her off at every turn. Being president brought new dynamic for a season or two, which is great but I think it's time to get back to the show's original premise. And I think the writers are turning in that direction as well."
Veep,35l06e,TheClevelandUnicorn,3,Mon May 11 17:34:50 2015 UTC,That scenario is highly implausible. She is most definitely the nominee of her party
Veep,35l06e,brucejoel99,1 point,Mon May 11 18:50:25 2015 UTC,"When it comes to highly implausible, there's no one like Armando Iannucci..."
Veep,35l06e,eigil,4,Tue May 12 20:51:29 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't make sense for a sitting president to self-demote herself to a lesser position, and for a person who didn't get any votes during the primary season and wasn't nominated at the party's convention to all of a sudden be the party's presidential nominee in the general election."
Veep,35jfry,NotEmmaStone,73,Sun May 10 23:27:22 2015 UTC,So happy Hugh Laurie finally showed up!
Veep,35jfry,sed_base,34,Mon May 11 03:02:31 2015 UTC,Me too and that entrance was amazing!! Great accent!  Hugh Laurie is the new Veep!!
Veep,35jfry,YoureASoldierBodie,23,Mon May 11 08:03:50 2015 UTC,Hugh Laurie is the new Veep!!   Ha! I've just realised he's the titular character. Amazing.
Veep,35jfry,DrDejavu,6,Mon May 11 17:58:08 2015 UTC,And before he arrived... Doyle was the titular character.  lol
Veep,35jfry,Aqquila89,7,Sat May 16 05:09:30 2015 UTC,"When they were talking about an universally beloved politician, it never occurred to me that he's the character who will be played by Hugh Laurie..."
Veep,35jfry,NotEmmaStone,10,Mon May 11 22:17:51 2015 UTC,There was a lot of build up to his character being introduced so I had a feeling it would be him!

Veep,35jfry,NotEmmaStone,61,Mon May 11 02:50:23 2015 UTC,"Long time coming, she's put up with Selina's shit for long enough without saying anything. I think she'll be back in the next episode or two though."
Veep,35jfry,sed_base,10,Mon May 11 03:07:55 2015 UTC,But a pretty hard fall for her to resign as campaign manager. She could've also just been patient & elbowed that annoying new advisor out like the way she did with that trainer in UK but I suppose the stresses of the convention got to her too
Veep,35jfry,Aqquila89,13,Mon May 11 08:17:58 2015 UTC,"It's kind of sad when you think about it, because Amy has pretty much sacrificed her personal life for this job. In ""Detroit"", when Selina says she wants to talk to her as ""friend to friend"", Amy notes, shocked: ""I  spend more time with you than any of my other friends. That technically makes you my best friend."""

Veep,35jfry,foca9,6,Mon May 11 08:25:25 2015 UTC,Julia Gillard? Was she awful?
Veep,35jfry,BumBumiLikeBum,11,Mon May 11 11:20:44 2015 UTC,"She's a very polarising figure in Australian politics. Overall, she had a few minor achievements, and a few minor mistakes. She didn't have enough time to establish a lasting legacy to be remembered for. However, the media created a lot of vitriol that saw her widely detested by the Right, and an underdog for the Left."
Veep,35jfry,smartestkitten,3,Mon May 11 11:38:37 2015 UTC,Couldn't have said it better myself. The party had a lot of infighting and backstabbing which was covered a lot in the media and unfortunately she was the face of that party at the time.
Veep,35jfry,enosprologue,2,Mon May 11 12:11:27 2015 UTC,According to some. She certainly had to put up with more crap than others.
Veep,35jfry,stankbucket,-3,Sat May 16 10:30:28 2015 UTC,So we won't have another black president? But we did get another Bush - and we might get a third.
Veep,35jfry,MAINEiac4434,13,Mon May 11 15:24:27 2015 UTC,"If Jeb Bush gets nominated, they could run a disabled dolphin as a Democrat and it'd sweep everything except Florida and Utah."
Veep,35jfry,stankbucket,4,Mon May 11 17:39:25 2015 UTC,You misunderestimate the voters. You do the same to the Dems assuming they will put up a solid alternative.
Veep,35jfry,MrXhin,3,Mon May 11 18:05:50 2015 UTC,Florida would go 52-47 for Dolphin.  Jeb sucks.
Veep,35jfry,nomotrollfosho,2,Wed May 13 03:44:19 2015 UTC,Bush vs Dolphin  That's a shitty Syfy film that we need
Veep,35jfry,BrianScalabrine_AMA,4,Fri May 15 12:21:21 2015 UTC,Obama approval ratings are consistently in the high 40s. Bush left office with 17%.
Veep,35jfry,stankbucket,0,Wed May 13 14:24:46 2015 UTC,"Obama's average is a few points lower than Bush's overall (47 vs 49.4). Bush's lowest was 25 so he did not leave with a 17. That was probably his ""strong approval"" which is not the number you're talking about. That being said I was not trying to say anything good about Bush at all. I was saying that the first Bush was not very good and we still got another and may get a third. Obama's leaving office number is still N/A so there is nothing to compare."
Veep,35jfry,insert90,2,Wed May 13 14:47:42 2015 UTC,Bush's overall is really skewed by him hitting the 90s after 9/11 while Obama's stayed in the 40s (with a few weeks in the 30s/50s) pretty much his entire term.
Veep,35jfry,stankbucket,1 point,Wed May 13 21:15:10 2015 UTC,Bush also got dragged down by the economy and the unending war as a result of 9/11. He currently has the 3rd lowest average of all presidents since FDR and there is likely no way for him to go anywhere but down between now and 2016 if history holds. He's creeping into Carter territory.
Veep,35jfry,BrianScalabrine_AMA,2,Thu May 14 19:24:33 2015 UTC,You seem to be suggesting that we wont get another black president because Obama did such a bad job. But Obama is still reasonably popular and will definitely be remembered as a perfectly adequate president.
Veep,35jfry,WatchOutRadioactiveM,0,Wed May 13 14:54:59 2015 UTC,and will definitely be remembered as a perfectly adequate president.   By whom?
Veep,35jfry,BrianScalabrine_AMA,3,Fri May 15 17:55:28 2015 UTC,history
Veep,35jfry,WatchOutRadioactiveM,0,Fri May 15 18:22:29 2015 UTC,"I don't know who this history guy is, but he sounds like a chump."
Veep,35jfry,stankbucket,0,Fri May 15 18:25:41 2015 UTC,It's impossible to say how a president will be remembered until he is book-ended. He is going on 2 years of his disapproval surpassing his approval and approvals traditionally continue to sink during the lame duck years. I understand you're a fan of his and you can understand that I'm not and I really wanted to be one when he got elected.  The only reason that I voted for him in 2012 was that I figured 4 more years of him was better than a possible 8 years of Romney. That's about as ho-hum as it gets. Then again I'm in NJ so my presidential vote doesn't matter.
Veep,35jfry,sed_base,3,Wed May 13 15:01:47 2015 UTC,"There's no fucking way Jeb Bush get even close to being nominated. Lemme tell ya something, atleast half the people running are doing it simply for the 501-c-4 anonymous super pac money."
Veep,35jfry,BumBumiLikeBum,33,Mon May 11 16:40:16 2015 UTC,"Best part was when Selina tried to save face by brushing it off as a tantrum, and then Amy had the lady-balls to come back for more. The most perfect rage-quit in history."
Veep,35jfry,Aqquila89,11,Mon May 11 13:18:44 2015 UTC,"I think Selina did a pretty good job looking unimpressed. It must have hurt Amy that when she delivered what she considered to be the final, devastating blow, Selina just sat there with a bored expression, eating a piece of chocolate."
Veep,35jfry,PhinsPhan89,23,Tue May 12 11:40:29 2015 UTC,"Selina is probably a bad president, but she's a good politician."
Veep,35jfry,PsychedOutSuckwads,2,Tue May 12 18:02:50 2015 UTC,this is the whole show summed up pretty much

Veep,35jfry,aussie_huddo,10,Mon May 11 11:40:00 2015 UTC,"I would highly recommend, especially if you like Seinfeld. After watching curb you can see Larry David's influences on George and the show as a whole."

Veep,35jfry,Fingolfiin,5,Mon May 11 13:13:24 2015 UTC,"The character George is basically Larry David but I wouldn't say that Curb is anything like Seinfeld. Completely different styles, both very funny Curb more so for me."

He was also the first person to say that he needed to go when the scandal hit the fan. Dude is on fire this season.

Veep,35jfry,NotEmmaStone,11,Mon May 11 11:41:43 2015 UTC,"I was wondering about that too but during their fight about it I definitely got the impression that he did something for her. Something big. Hid something, destroyed something, fixed some huge problem that she had. Whatever it was, it was a big deal given that Gary hasn't told anyone else about it and he's not good at keeping secrets. Remember how it took about 30 seconds for him to tell the rest of the team about her miscarriage? I really hope they address this again soon, I'm dying to know what happened!"
Veep,35jfry,dickensmw,3,Mon May 11 23:09:42 2015 UTC,I'm also thinking more along the lines of Gary doing something big for her. That's the biggest impression that scene from East Wing left me with.

I don't know if it's the direction or just the chemistry between the actors but the back-and-forth you see between Selina & other actors during a big scene is just amazing. For example, Selina's almost kiss with Gary, Selina & Mike's interactions throughout this season and so on. One of my favorite was the new female advisor completely snubbed out when Selina was introducing all the members of her staff. So realistically cringe-y, so funny! And the jokes this season have just been on another level altogether!! The book depository line, from Jonah was brilliant! Same for the Pearl Harbor line in this episode. Maybe it's because I'm not that perceptive but sometimes if I rewatch an episode I end discovering few new jokes!"

I lost it when she introduced herself to Hugh Laurie (are we going to call him Tom James here?). It was so cringy but super hilarious.    Also, Hugh Laurie's reactions to everything are killing me! From when the team asked him to repeat his joke everytime (and Karen spoiling the punchline) to when he saw Gary coming out of the bedroom with clothes and footwear. Can't wait to see him react to what a shitstorm he went into."

Veep,35bn0y,valek005,26,Fri May 8 20:38:55 2015 UTC,I agree.  While I think the show has had to make decisions that make it seem like she is a Democrat the show doesn't feel like it has an political agenda.  It is a satire of our system.

Veep,35bn0y,gcatchris,2,Wed May 13 17:30:10 2015 UTC,"I've actually thought she's a moderate Republican. She had a pretty hard stance on immigration, doesn't feel strongly pro-choice when the president of her own party is pro-life. Maddox, who's in the same party, is staunchly Christian/pro-life/pro-military. Her advisers told her to sound more pro-Israel than pro-Palestine, and she seemed disturbed by Dan's support of abortion.  She has some liberal tendencies, such as the clean jobs bill, but honestly I just think she's a moderate who cares way more about politics than policy. It doesn't really matter for the show."

I doubt that anybody like Maddox or POTUS would be members of the Democratic Party. She's definitely more left-leaning than most Republicans, so she would probably be labeled as a RINO like Mitt Romney or Olympia Snowe. Her political stances on the show regarding environmental protections and health care form are quite similar to their positions.  However, she was never disturbed by Dan mentioning abortion. She was only conflicted about voicing a pro-choice stance b/c she had to support POTUS' stances despite it being an issue that affected many vulnerable women. Also, most American politicians (Democrat AND Republican) are pro-Israel."

It's just fun to discuss.  You can't really guess what her party affiliation is based on her personal opinion on issues to staff. Most politics are only hard party liners in front of cameras and donors, and really only in election cycles. But as a Marylander, I'd guess Democrat. In over 100 years only 4 senators from Maryland were Republican. 3 of those senators were born and raised in Western Maryland. The other was elected in 1917. And she is decidedly NOT a Western Maryland girl. And while some senators are not from the state they represent, Maryland has only had 3 senators not born and raised in Maryland in the past 100 years. The one term Republican elected in 1917, one term Senator Bruce who was from Virginia elected in 1923, and Senator Joe Tydings, who was born in NC but raised in Maryland from toddler age after being adopted by his (step)dad who was Senator Millard Tydings born and raised in Havre de Grace, MD. So, based solely on the voting patterns of the Maryland constituency, and the fact that she is definitely not a girl raised in Cumberland or Frostburg  (I might buy Fredrick, but it still be would be a hard sell) I would have to say Democrat. And I'm sure I have over thought this completely. But as I said, it's fun!"

Since you asked, I'll give you a few minor suggestions:  -You have a typo at the top of the last page. It should be ""polls"" and not ""poles"".  -I think the two jokes ""covered more than a kidnapped white girl from Florida"" and ""turned like a white girl at a music festival"" sound too similar for different non sequiturs. I would have Mike's attempt at a joke seem a little more pathetic. Maybe he says something like ""This will be covered more than a Queen Elizabeth sex tape."" and everyone looks at him with disgust and confusion.  -I was a little confused on the details about Gary's shoulder. In the first act his right shoulder is hurt, but then he is shot in the left shoulder.

Also, the actress who plays Catherine is the most underrated member of the cast, I think. She really owns the part, she gets just enough Selina-isms that their relationship seems real. I think Arrested Development is the only other show I can remember where the family dynamics are so believable, even when there's extraordinary/unbelievable things happening all around the characters.

When she comes back from the bathroom after her ""false alarm"" and she's talking about wanting to redo her kitchen in the same wood as the table on AF1, she totally sniffs deeply like she's clearing her sinuses, and all of that stuff she's doing is basically how people act when they're on coke.

Veep,34f4bv,The_Code_Hero,8,Thu Apr 30 16:59:27 2015 UTC,ideally it would be nice to see the cast of both shows do a crossover where they stage a coup over the real life Congress.  i think all of America can agree that even the writers of Jonah's and Zoe's characters can write better legislation than our current Congress
Veep,34f4bv,globalglasnost,0,Fri May 1 01:35:01 2015 UTC,So could u or I! Just make everything a crime And drum up the scare tactics. I like where Ur heads at

Veep,34f4bv,csxnewbie,2,Fri May 1 14:37:07 2015 UTC,"It's not at the same time, within the last 6 months. But I recently watched all of West Wing most episodes for the first time. I then watched season 1 & 2 of HOC to get a refreshers before season 3. Then I watched Veep all again to get a refresher for season 4. Also have had Veep on since, it's one of my all time favorite shows.    They are all great in their own way. West Wing had a good balance of drama and comedy. HOC has some comedy probably a little more unintentional. Veep up till this season never really tried the drama to much.  I enjoy all 3 shows. I don't know that I would ever watch WW again though. But HOC and Veep will forever be in rotation."

Veep,342h3e,noodle539,2,Mon Apr 27 20:18:50 2015 UTC,"Definitely. There's an episode later in the season called ""B/ill"" (referencing a scene in Kill Bill ie the Families First Bill that Selina wants passed.)  The writers for the show all worked on The Thick of It and mirror stories from that show all the time. My guess is that Dan goes to the Opposition and works on destroying support for the bill.  I'm all for that, I think that introducing the Opposition in TToI improved the show by a large margin."
Veep,342h3e,BigMuffsN808s,25,Sun May 3 13:58:26 2015 UTC,I have always assumed from season 1 that they would end up together.

Veep,344dir,ParticularJoker,2,Tue Apr 28 06:04:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Gary has performed a pregnancy test himself, on Selina's urine, and was totally unfazed.

Veep,33z7l6,apostrotastrophe,7,Wed Apr 29 10:12:52 2015 UTC,"Can someone explain the fuck up of this episode? When I first started watching I was pretty confused about the political stories because I don't follow politics at all and I'm feeling that again. All I got is: Selina mentioned HIV girl and reddit found out more about her It was internal? They're firing Chloe to save face, but did the Expendebelles have anything to do with that? Did they find out who did it? Selina sent letters of her and babies to parents with dead children using something illegal.    That's all I have. I'd appreciate it someone could explain it better."
Veep,33z7l6,CVance1,19,Mon Apr 27 22:41:26 2015 UTC,"Here's my best shot: HIV girl's info and and the info used to mail those brochures came from a govt data breach (which was traced back to a worker who has long been gone and therefore can't be ""sacrificed"" to the media). In order to save face in the media, Selina's camp has to put the blame on someone (and fire them)--the expendabelles are too low on the totem pole, they thought firing Chloe/Leigh would be enough (but she wasn't newsworthy enough to get noticed), so they planned to fire Ben until Bill Erickson talked Selina into firing Dan instead so they could maybe fire Ben later if the data breach problem worsens. I hope that helps!"
Veep,33z7l6,RufusMcCoot,8,Tue Apr 28 00:06:25 2015 UTC,"Someone opened up medical records that the government technically has access to but that are supposed to be accessed only by people treating a particular person.   That information was then used to find an example of an ailing child, and out at the forefront of Selina's platform to support families. She and her team didn't know where the kid's name or info came from, and must have assumed it was from somewhere ethical.   The mailing campaign was about that same data breach - medical records that were private being used as a tool for political marketing. Whoever was working on putting together the mailing list thought it would be a great idea to use the information to find parents who had just lost a child.   I have a family member who works at the tax office, and technically has access to everyone's tax records. However, she would be in huge trouble if she accessed them without it being necessary. If she was renting out her basement, she couldn't just look up the people who applied to choose a tenant. Same thing here, except large-scale, and used for political gain."

Veep,32juyt,rhadamanthus52,2,Fri Apr 17 23:37:58 2015 UTC,"As pointed out it's because the speaker introduces the President in this situation. However it's also true that the VP has almost no legal power- iirc they only constitutionally vote as a tiebreak in the senate, and they are first in line if the president dies/can't continue. That's about it so legally they probably have less power than just about any generic elected official in DC, as well as less power than a ton of civil service types.  In practice the VP has to do something while they're waiting around for a tie in senate voting or a dead president, so they get delegated all the jobs that need an official Executive Branch presence that the President doesn't want to do such as receiving or visiting dignitaries of countries with which the US doesn't have important active negotiations, and making political visits to domestic locations and politicians to try to win support for presidential initiatives.   Depending on the administration the VP can take a more or less active role. Dick Cheney is widely considered to have been one of the more hands on/active VPs under Bush, including being the architect of several major policy pieces. Contrast with Joe Biden who is used more as a political stumper, and not known for being a major strategic player inside the West Wing."

And they aren’t ready to make babies until we’re older.”  I looked at my sister, now a slim, tough one-year-old, and at her tiny belly. I imagined her eggs inside her, like the sack of spider eggs in Charlotte’s Web, and her uterus, the size of a thimble.  “Does her vagina look like mine?”  “I guess so,” my mother said. “Just smaller.”  One day, as I sat in our driveway in Long Island playing with blocks and buckets, my curiosity got the best of me. Grace was sitting up, babbling and smiling, and I leaned down between her legs and carefully spread open her vagina. She didn’t resist, and when I saw what was inside I shrieked. “My mother came running. “Mama, Mama! Grace has something in there!”  My mother didn’t bother asking why I had opened Grace’s vagina. This was within the spectrum of things that I did. She just got on her knees and looked for herself. It quickly became apparent that Grace had stuffed six or seven pebbles in there. My mother removed them patiently while Grace cackled, thrilled that her prank had been such a success.""    As she grew, I took to bribing her for her time and affection: one dollar in quarters if I could do her makeup like a “motorcycle chick.” Three pieces of candy if I could kiss her on the lips for five seconds. Whatever she wanted to watch on TV if she would just “relax on me.” Basically, anything a sexual predator might do to woo a small suburban girl I was trying.    I shared a bed with my sister, Grace, until I was seventeen years old. She was afraid to sleep alone and would begin asking me around 5:00 P.M. every day whether she could sleep with me. I put on a big show of saying no, taking pleasure in watching her beg and sulk, but eventually I always relented. Her sticky, muscly little body thrashed beside me every night as I read Anne Sexton, watched reruns of SNL, sometimes even as I slipped my hand into my underwear to figure some stuff out."

His destruction of Jonah was just so... thorough. And this was especially impressive considering that Ed, up to that point, hadn't said a mean thing about anyone:    ""Jonah, you're not even a man; you're like an early draft of a man where they just sketched out a giant, mangled skeleton but they didn't have time to add details like pigment or self-respect.

Veep,2e58d7,AugustinexBoethius,20,Thu Aug 21 02:52:36 2014 UTC,I have always believed her to be a democrat...I didn't realize that was in question.
Veep,2e58d7,theotheramy1,3,Thu Aug 21 06:35:38 2014 UTC,"I thought she was a liberal leaning Republican. Though, I admittedly know very little about US politics."
Veep,2e58d7,stufstuf,0,Fri Aug 22 17:17:19 2014 UTC,Those don't really exist anymore.
Veep,2e58d7,kintaeb,2,Fri Oct 3 17:25:39 2014 UTC,Why you got downvoted for this is a mystery.
Veep,2e58d7,jrjuniorjrjr,2,Sun Jan 4 06:16:13 2015 UTC,"Well, when the show first came out, they made a big deal about how they're not even hinting at Selina's party because it would detract from the show. But, as you said, it's pretty obvious that she's a democrat. So I guess the show decided they weren't going to keep it a total secret, as originally planned.     Anyway, one reason Selina's party could be ""in question"" is that she's usually fighting with Doyle, Kent, and other members of the party about her policies. Like when Kent said ""children are of no value"" (lol) and Doyle threatened to leave if she mentioned universal childcare in her speech. Those scenes made it sound like they were all republicans and Selina is just a bit more liberal than the rest of her party."
Veep,2e58d7,Andrado,5,Thu Aug 21 15:06:42 2014 UTC,"I think she's a moderate Republican, actually. Many of the policy controversies in the show revolve around her clashing with the POTUS, who leans right on a ton of stuff, and she is a part of his Republican-leaning administration. Immigration amnesty was actually a Reagan administration policy (Republican), and there are a lot of pro-choice Republicans. The ""warmonger"" quote would make her seem like a supporter of military action, in line with Republican values, more Republicans are starting to come to terms with gay rights than ever before.  I also noticed that in the Midterm Election episode, some of the districts that they say were won by their party are districts that always go Republican - they didn't win any solidly blue districts.  The most likely scenario is that they give her party elements from both the Republicans and Democrats so she can never completely fall in line with either."
Veep,2e58d7,kindalas,11,Fri Oct 10 22:01:11 2014 UTC,She is obviously a Republican.   She is just so bad at it that she'd make a better Democrat.
Veep,2e58d7,kittyguy,8,Thu Aug 21 14:00:28 2014 UTC,I'm sure the people who write the show are all liberal and it comes through unintentionally.  Also so far as I know you have to take sort of a pro life pledge to be a republican.
Veep,2e58d7,MpMerv,2,Thu Aug 21 09:10:31 2014 UTC,"I too always thought she was a democrat. She doesn't at all carry herself like a cookie-cutter conservative woman. And, as others have mentioned, there are episodes where she takes stances that are traditionally liberal."
Veep,2e58d7,BroSciencePhD,1 point,Thu Aug 28 23:15:45 2014 UTC,"When Dan was tasked with discrediting Chung in the early primary (S3E4), he said that he ""had to succeed where the entire Republican guard failed."" Chung, Selina & Co., Maddox, etc. are all Democrats.  Other figures, particularity House Speaker Marwood, are likely Republicans given how the show seems to parallel real life in terms of the gridlock surrounding the shutdown."

And yes I'm aware that Mitch Hurwitz produced 'Veep''s pre-HBO pilot.  Big deal - he doesn't have a role in 'Veep.'    And just to be clear - Arrested Development wasn't 'comedic perfection' either.  Albeit, it is one of - if not the - smartest television comedy ever to air, but perfection it is/was not.  Season 3 was just north of good and season four was in a word - acceptable.  Look I really like 'Veep.'  Obviously I wouldn't be posting about it if I didn't, but let's be real - comedic perfection it ain't.  If HBO were to cancel their season 4 order and end the show tomorrow - seven years from now the show would never have amassed such a loyal cult following nor would the show be brought back to life like AD.  But don't take my word for it - the critics seem to agree with me as well. You know - from a craft perspective..."

Veep,27nkft,CaptnYossarian,13,Thu Jun 12 23:13:11 2014 UTC,Depends on how the elections go.  It's possible she has to concede during the primaries and is given the veep position by the winner as a consolation prize.
Veep,27nkft,chAMPIRE,6,Mon Jun 9 04:02:40 2014 UTC,"Granted I recognize this is fiction but there's two problems with that:  one, presidents don't serve as veep in subsequent administrations (even Selina has said she'd rather be shot in the face then serve as veep again).  And the other - only Bill Clinton has lost Iowa and New Hampshire and went on to win the nomination.  Both problems are really the junkie in me nit picking - where as its a comedy and anything could happen.

I used to love everybody but now? Um...no. I like Gary, I like Sue, I like Mike, I love Ben. I'm on the fence about Amy and Dan. But I sure as shit am not rooting for Selina. I really don't understand how good things continue to happen to somebody who fucks up SO CONSISTENTLY. I cringe with every new episode, she has absolutely no tact when dealing with anybody.   If she fucks up this turn of presidency she's getting because POTUS has resigned and SOMEHOW gets the presidency from her already fucked campaign, I think I'm really gonna have to punch somebody in the face. Probably myself out of complete embarrassment for this character."
Veep,27nkft,don-chocodile,25,Mon Jun 9 02:27:38 2014 UTC,I don't think you're supposed to really like any of the characters.  They're mostly assholes.  I sure as hell would never vote for Meyer.
Veep,27nkft,OneOfDozens,6,Mon Jun 9 06:46:22 2014 UTC,"To be fair, she is now the sitting President, the party is most probably going to nominate her, by default, as she is an incumbent who is now running for re-election. She has already beaten her opponents that we know already, Chung, Maddox, etc., bar some major fuck-up during her presidency before the nomination is made public.   She is also much more likely to be elected now just by virtue of being the current president, and she can basically knock down any comparison to another candidate with her experience, however brief it will be.  That said, this show is about the backstage view of running a political office, every ""major"" fuck up we see the characters freak out about is barely an embarrassing Politico article. How many of HuffPo and Politico's front page articles are usually these kinds of minor bungles?   The tape of them insulting the campaign donors in the last episode? That is the kind of mistake that makes a campaign take a hit, they apologize, fire some people to make it look sincere and in the end it doesn't matter all that much because it blew over and the general populace have forgotten about it by election day.  Candidates and sitting politicians have gotten away with much worse, just by weathering the media storm and doing the right kind of damage control. It is funny to watch a politician and her team scramble to get public opinion on their side, in a way that is by most accounts fairly accurate."

Veep,27ob81,Aqquila89,5,Mon Jun 9 16:41:45 2014 UTC,"The fun and games turned mean tonight.    I agree with Point 1, but Point 2 completely misses the point. All the characters on Veep are meant to be horrible. And horribly relatable. The show has always been a black comedy about the nastiness of the political class.   Selina Meyer, the Veep, has become a terrible bitch. And with scant few exception, everyone around Selina seems nasty and shallow.   Has Selina ever been anything else? She smashes things when she's angry, cares little to nothing for any of her staff, and even less for her own daughter. With Gary and Clint excepted, who are hilariously incompetent, everyone is hilariously mean.   Amy Brookheimer as the Veep’s campaign manager is a friendly face in a sea of piranhas.    Didn't she orchestrate Dan's mental breakdown and put him in hospital for her promotion about two episodes ago?"
Veep,27ob81,LG7,1 point,Mon Jun 9 11:17:02 2014 UTC,"I don't think Gary is incompetent. He's excellent at being Selina's bag man. Beyond that, he's a hopeless sad sack, but he's good at his job."
Veep,27ob81,OneOfDozens,0,Mon Jun 9 15:46:51 2014 UTC,"For me, the show turned a corner last night, from ""charmingly mean"" to ""soullessly cruel."" Or rather, the VP herself did.   As I point out in my little write-up, I think Selina's meanness was tempered by her being dragged back down to earth constantly. In these last two episodes, she is elevated so ridiculously that it presents a real challenge to the show's genius going forward."
Veep,27ob81,mads-80,-1,Mon Jun 9 16:40:10 2014 UTC,"I thought it was Jonah who drove Dan nuts, right? I'll have to re-watch to be sure. My main point is that Amy is a bright, likeable character."
Veep,27ob81,down_v0te,3,Mon Jun 9 16:41:09 2014 UTC,"I agree with a lot of these points, the common hatred of Jonah in season 1 was funny and did actually endear me to some of the characters. However, by making Selina morally ambiguous with her stances on things it makes it much harder to want her to do well. Obviously the point is that Veep is reflective of US politics as well so its just something that we have to accept, the constant setbacks and hard fought minor victories that last only moments. The nastiness is something that has really been more frequent as the pressure has become higher, perhaps if Selina somehow stays as Veep then we'll see  things become lighter?"

Veep,27ob81,fameistheproduct,1 point,Mon Jun 9 13:21:15 2014 UTC,"What a shit analysis of this show, and if this idiot thinks the point of this show was to have ""likable"" character to root for he clearly hasn't been paying attention. The character are horrible people, as are most people in real life, and like most people they are more horrible when under tremendous stress.   I laughed so hard at the ""you're all losers"" bit, and it is certainly not the first one of its kind, ""the incompetence in this office is staggering, STAGGERING,"" the entire episode in which Selina tortures Mike, Amy and Dan with who among them will be fired, etc.   A key point in the dynamic of this show for all the non-politician characters is how they relate to having pledged an allegiance to someone for their ideologies but who is forced to betray those ideas and their allies when politically necessary, and how they must also act in their own interest. Especially in season 1 and 2, with Amy having to sink the legislation that she helped write and turn against her(and Selina's) platform on immigration(deling with the pro-caucasian caucus)."

My point is, my head is full of memories of suiting up then trying to be articulate and persuasive.  The drain plug, the twitch, ""legitimate holes"" . . . I practically bruised my knee slapping at it during this episode, and I'm making inappropriate noise at this hour watching a repeat.  Also, I get that this is a personal opinion, but I think there has never been a woman with short hair who would not have been more attractive with long hair.  That ""she can pull it off"" sentiment seems to me a disingenuous social convention.  It was a delight to see a show where the story did not spin hair mutilation into a trendy style choice.  Brutal honesty is the currency of Veep, and this episode delivered big time.  I can personally relate to half of those public speaking disasters, and this was a splendid convergence of plausible ridiculousness."

That guy is running circles around her and ten we are supposed to believe she will turn it around at the last second? American politics don't work like that, one mistake and you are sunk. Great example of this is Rick Perry running for president. When e announced he was running he was way ahead in the polls (yeah I know it was still aways off but he had momentum.) But after he forgot his 5th point during that debate (which was an honest mistake or just brain fart) he was toast. He did not recover from that and everyone knew he was as good as done. When running for president you have to be as close to perfect as possible and in reality Salina would have been out of there by S4.E5  (obviously I'm not say Rick perry would have won Presidency with out that slip up, he was already sliding on the polls before that but I was just trying to illustrate how cut and dry American politics can be, especially when running for President)"

Veep,25wdt1,herrdunphy,3,Mon May 19 22:43:51 2014 UTC,It's from a Theremin. It was a staple of Sci-Fi in the 50s and 60s.
Veep,25wdt1,theruins,1 point,Tue May 20 00:31:48 2014 UTC,"Theremin:       The theremin /ˈθɛrəmɪn/,  THAIR-ə-min; originally known as the ætherphone/etherphone, thereminophone  or termenvox/thereminvox is an early electronic musical instrument controlled without physical contact by the thereminist (performer). It is named after the westernized name of its Russian inventor, Léon Theremin, who patented the device in 1928.  The instrument's controlling section usually consists of two metal antennas which sense the relative position of the thereminist's hands and control oscillators for frequency with one hand, and amplitude (volume) with the other. The electric signals from the theremin are amplified and sent to a loudspeaker.  The theremin was used in movie soundtracks such as Miklós Rózsa's for Spellbound and The Lost Weekend and Bernard Herrmann's for The Day the Earth Stood Still and as the theme tune for the ITV drama Midsomer Murders. This has led to its association with a very eerie sound. Theremins are also used in concert music (especially avant-garde and 20th- and 21st-century new music) and in popular music genres such as rock. Psychedelic rock bands in particular, such as Hawkwind have often used the theremin in their work.

Veep,25gbhl,Dusty_Machine,7,Tue May 13 20:47:07 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that's true. We really didn't get to see how frustated she was ""campaigning as running mate"" because the first season started after that. So seeing that would be awesome, also, it would be the second time so she'll be extra-frustated."
Veep,25gbhl,StarHeadedCrab,2,Mon May 19 09:09:23 2014 UTC,"Campaigning as a running mate, then not winning would be the perfect way to end the show - the ultimate statement that politics is fickle and the VP can't change that. Also there won't need to be any resignations or party pressure (I don't think the show's illustrated why selina bows down to lobbyists and party heavyweights all that well); because of the US system, Selina losing the VP job means she loses all political office."
Veep,25gbhl,Dusty_Machine,2,Mon May 19 13:30:33 2014 UTC,"I agree with you. But I think she will win the primaries and loose the election, so she will be the oposition leader or something. I don't know about the change of name."

Veep,25gbhl,Dusty_Machine,11,Mon Jun 9 03:47:58 2014 UTC,"Actually the sitcom ""Yes minister"" (one of the main influences to Iannucci when he started The Thick of It) changed it's name to ""Yes, Prime Minister"" when the main character became PM, so it's a possibility although ""Veep"" and ""Potus"" as names are less alike, so that could be a dealbreaker."
Veep,25gbhl,Dusty_Machine,1 point,Tue May 13 16:20:12 2014 UTC,Who knows at this point. I think the writers are probably trying to balance Plot/character development and continuity/maintaining the same humor. It's fun to theorize though. Selina being president I think would ruin some of the humor but it could add a lot as well. So much of what made the first two seasons great was her quibbling over bullshit with her entourage without having power.

Veep,25gbhl,ctownlegend,4,Fri May 16 09:43:33 2014 UTC,I hear all of your points. I agree proximity to power is a major theme. But I disagree that there will be a new potus. I think it will be the same one. Previously Dreyfus said in an interview with Stewart that the potus would never be revealed to the viewers. I think that's a major theme. I don't think they'll change that dynamic. Sometime in the next episode or two perhaps the potus will run again? One theory.
Veep,25gbhl,menevets,2,Tue May 20 01:07:25 2014 UTC,"I think it's a running gag that she will never see the president. I don't think they'll make her president, but I think it will be spectacular if she is. The potential of satire from that office is endless."

Veep,24q84b,klosec12,5,Wed May 7 01:45:07 2014 UTC,"I think he came in at the time when The Office was faltering a bit around when Carell left, but his character in this and Silicon Valley have been fantastic, and i agree with you that in SV he is one of my favourites there, probably only behind Peter Gregory and Dinesh/Gilfoyle."
Veep,24q84b,klukins,4,Wed May 7 01:48:07 2014 UTC,"So I watch Veep, The Good Wife, Playing House, and Silicon Valley. I cannot keep who he is straight.

That scene with Selina and Dan though. Whew.    I also like how they're still going with the Kent/Sue thing. I don't ever see that happening but it's funny as hell seeing Kent creeping on Sue thinking he's being slick.
Veep,24q84b,hoojman,9,Wed May 7 00:32:29 2014 UTC,"Not gonna lie. I watched that entire scene with my hands on my face and I was peeking through my fingers. It was that cringeworthy (in a great way). When Dan revealed that he killed a dog, I freaking howled."

Veep,2453yk,ILuv2eat,22,Mon Apr 28 07:10:17 2014 UTC,I loved the actress who played Melissa  (CFO of Clovis). The guest spots they have on this show are so well done.

Looking forward to the new Jon Oliver show, I decided to just go ahead and give Veep a shot (I had seem the main actor on the Daily Show once).  I loved it.  I am the type of watcher who usually just grins at hilarious jokes -- I never laugh.  I can honestly say that I laughed twice during this program.  That is a very rare feat.  I don't remember exactly, but I think it was the guy who made the viral videos who did it for me (edit - I also found craiiig hilarious).  He seems to be a great actor and I hope he is a main or at least reoccurring character.  Isn't he the dentist from Hangover BTW?"

Veep is genuinely one of the funniest shows on television right now, and I think this season is really good because it manages a fairly consistent/linear plot that allows Veep to develop without being as disjointed as it was in the first season. I really do have to thank Armando Iannucci for creating television that convinced me to work in politics (sort of fucked up, right?), and Veep will continue to be and become even more relevant to me as it goes on."

It's like, I get that the Veep's whole office is a collective butt monkey to be railed on, but it's growing really tiresome that they never ever seem to catch a break.  It makes it really frustrating to watch.  Compound that with situations like tonight with that utter asshole of a producer berating Amy never getting his comeuppance, Selena not shutting down the piece because of the interviewer's continual flaunting of her guidelines, and... I dunno.  The show simply isn't much fun anymore.  It's all ""kick her while she's already down,"" and really isn't funny.  I hope it turns around.  The first season and earlier episodes were brilliant."
Veep,1g0d3i,maveric1k,2,Mon Jun 10 04:36:50 2013 UTC,"I agree, the way the press flaunts their arrogance is too much. It's like, 'hey assholes, journalism is dead mutherfucker' ever heard of that dickballs?????"

Veep,1g0d3i,morris198,3,Mon Jun 10 19:34:16 2013 UTC,"I dunno how something like that would be excused/explained in the terms of the show.  It's not like the Vice President of the United States is obligated to give an interview to that particular interviewer or her crew.  What should have happened is someone should have said, ""OK, that's it:  interview over.  Any future interviews will go to your competition, and I will see to it that you and everyone else on your team are blacklisted from anything to do with the White House.""

Veep,1e7l4m,Federico216,32,Mon May 13 09:41:10 2013 UTC,"I did. There weren't many actual references to Finland, but they were all gold.  Here's a short clarification for all the Finnish spoken in the episode (it's a straight copypaste from my comment from AV Club, lazy as I am), even though it was mostly explained on the show.   ""Kassi"" what Gary kept saying, indeed means ""bag"" in Finnish. It is also used as a euphemism for scrotum, but only in plural form. The joke still kind of worked. The gift book said ""Suomi on raskas maa"" (Finland is a heavy country), when they probably intended to write ""Suomi on rakas maa"" (Finland is a lovely country) The stuff Finnish Prime Minister said in ""Finnish"" after that was either just gibberish, or so badly pronounced it was incomprehensible ""Anteeksi"" = ""Sorry"", Anteeksi + Dan = Danteeksi Selina Puupää, literal translation = Selina woodhead (pretty oldfashioned and silly insult, hardly ever used. Equivalent would be... I don't know.. doofus?`)"

The number and quality of jokes are still pretty much the same. Or maybe it's just because I love Tony Hale and laugh pretty much every time he's on screen.

I know that Finland was probably chosen exactly because it's so unimportant and uninteresting, but that just made the episode funnier. Good episode, some awesome lines again, especially Gary was as hilarious as always.  I was impressed that they actually took time to shoot some stuff in Helsinki, and used some actual Finnish."
Veep,1e7l4m,herrdunphy,8,Mon May 13 10:22:23 2013 UTC,"Selina Puupää! I found it kind of weird that anyone here would give enough shits about US-politics to write a sign for veeps visit (that song would've never even reached the news here), but I guess we are the land of nuts anyways.  //The Angry Birds-gift was amazing cringe comedy though. That was something Finns would definitely do."
Veep,1e7l4m,Alpha_Q,2,Mon May 13 08:02:05 2013 UTC,It seems like this season that the writers are going to eventually work in a Dan and Amy romance. They keep dropping lines about Amy needing a boyfriend and since her and Dan use to be an item I think they are going that route. Not sure if I'm a fan of that or not just yet. Not sure if that's actually going to happen just yet either.
Veep,1e7l4m,herrdunphy,2,Mon May 13 08:15:56 2013 UTC,"IMO, Season 1 had more Amy/Dan romance moments than this season. But I would love them to hook up and get picked on it by everybody else."
Veep,1e7l4m,keef_hernandez,3,Mon May 13 00:07:31 2013 UTC,"I hope that's the only thing that happens. I wouldn't really be able to enjoy any romance on such a show. In fact, one of my favourite aspects of the show are that they avoid such things, like when they just mentioned Dan and Amy going out for 3 days without showing it (it think it was in episode 2 or 3 for season 1)."
Veep,1e7l4m,herrdunphy,2,Mon May 13 09:50:15 2013 UTC,"Yes, and they mention in it just a scene or two, I didn't even know that they dated! I have learned about that through watching deleted scenes.    It would be funny if Sue or Mike teases Amy about being in love with Dan. Or even Jonah. Hahaha. And then Selena giving them nicknames."
Veep,1e7l4m,twinathon,2,Mon May 13 15:56:16 2013 UTC,"Unfortunately, I think they are going down the ""she is interested in someone else, which makes him realize his feelings"" path. Of course, that's just a guess based on a line from the preview for the next episode."

Veep,1e33sh,Charlesworths,3,Sun May 19 23:10:50 2013 UTC,Apart of the POTUS usage is to add to the satire of The West Wing. The show's pilot spends a good portion establishing the term POTUS which Sorkin apparently read or heard in his research for the show.
Veep,1e33sh,HalpTheFan,2,Sun May 12 10:48:55 2013 UTC,"Much, much more common in a written context. It seems easier to just say 'The President' or 'Obama' in conversation."
Veep,1e33sh,JoshLyman_,2,Sat May 11 04:52:38 2013 UTC,"He will probably remain unnamed, unseen and unheard. The show isn't about him, so ""POTUS"" is a great way to mask him and keep his identity minimal. But to answer your question - I have absolutely no idea."

Her office would be in the EEOB (Eisenhower Executive Office Building) right next door to the White House. That's where the Veep works. I think because they were in that WH guy's office so much it seemed to get confusing about who was where this episode.  You can visually tell the difference between the two usually. WH is often cream colored, bland and vanilla and cramped. Whereas the EEOB has that standard big hallway with all the doors and the black checked floor, tall ceilings in her office area, and more space, but has that horrible bureaucratic feel about it.  The scenes of her in the EEOB look more to me like the Russell building where the Senators are housed, but I suppose the interior of the EEOB looks like that.  Source - I was in DC just last week and was fascinated by how close the EEOB actually is to the WH. I mean, it is RIGHT there."

Veep,1ccpbe,Alpha_Q,16,Mon Apr 15 10:37:43 2013 UTC,"this episode centered on the ""mid-term elections""  1) every 4-years the president/vice-president are elected along with other smaller positions around the country (governors, senators, representatives) 2)But not all smaller positions are elected on the same cycle as the president/veep, some are 2-years off  this means there are elections every 2 years and in this episode the president/veep's party (democrat or republican) was losing most of the races and ended up losing control of the House of Representatives, so they will now face significantly more opposition in passing legislation  In the Dan/Furlong storyline, Furlong chairs a committee in the House of Representatives but is running for governor of Ohio. If he loses the race, he keeps his seat in the House and will go after Dan for back-dooring the McCauley amendment against the president's wishes last season. Because their party lost control of the House, even if Furlong loses his election and remains in the House, the committee chairmanship will go to a member of the other party most likely. So Dan is in the clear."

Veep,1akz22,TrueBfan,1 point,Tue Apr 16 07:16:04 2013 UTC,"Ok let me just say that Julia Louis-Dreyfus is a comic genius! I was introduced to this show by my boyfriend and I saw the ""that's like trying to us a croissant as a f***ing dildo"" episode. Omg I have never seen anything so hilarious! I showed everyone I knew the next day! I am sooo excited for the rest of the second season and I just learned they got locked into a third so now I am ecstatic! If I ever had the chance, this would be the show I would want to be on!"
Veep,1akz22,Federico216,1 point,Thu May 2 06:49:54 2013 UTC,I haven't seen a single bad show from HBO (I know they also did Girls and Sex in the City but I haven't seen them so...). Heard they were developing a comedy set in political circles and I was interested immediately.
Veep,1akz22,Blue_Clouds,1 point,Mon May 6 10:25:24 2013 UTC,I got into it because its on HBO and supposedly had some resemblance to The Thick of It.
Veep,1akz22,Cot427,1 point,Mon May 13 13:52:43 2013 UTC,"I just watched the first episode of Veep and suffice to say that I'm addicted.  I've seen it advertised on HBO while watching Game of Thrones a few times, and honestly I've needed a good comedy until the next season of Girls comes back on.  Julia-Louis-Dreyfus is so great in this show.  I really enjoyed her as Elaine on Seinfeld and also enjoyed her in New Adventures of Old Christine, although not as much.  I think this show as the potential to become one of her best."

Veep,vmhcs,galudwig,1 point,Wed Jun 27 10:41:09 2012 UTC,"Fantastic show! Yes, Minister/Yes, Prime Minister for the 21st Century with a lot (A LOT) more profanity."
Veep,vm02y,Chaserjim,1 point,Tue Jun 26 03:32:12 2012 UTC,This was THE standout moment of the season for me.  But there are just so many great little quips like this one.
Veep,uvjz2,jlesnick,11,Mon Jun 11 03:04:16 2012 UTC,Veep has just turned out to be a phenomenal show.  You cannot deny that this ensemble is incredibly talented.
Veep,uvjz2,jlesnick,4,Mon Jun 11 05:32:38 2012 UTC,"Yep. The first few episodes were shaky, but I'm loving the dynamic between  the characters."
Veep,uvjz2,MelodyLoom,1 point,Mon Jun 11 05:38:47 2012 UTC,"Agreed, I think it just had to be that way though.  A few initial episodes of getting to know the characters, learning their dynamics."
Veep,uvjz2,RelationshipCreeper,3,Mon Jun 11 23:02:46 2012 UTC,"I came for the Julia Louis-Dreyfus, stayed for the holy crap, everyone on here is fantastic."
Veep,uvjz2,Pseudo_OSF,3,Mon Jun 11 08:50:24 2012 UTC,Loved this episode.  Can someone explain how the whole Twitter thing   got leaked? I missed something.
Veep,uvjz2,Pseudo_OSF,6,Mon Jun 11 05:36:44 2012 UTC,I'm sure the reporter just put 2 and 2 together. Mike pretty much told her exactly what to say.
Veep,uvjz2,PateraSilk,1 point,Mon Jun 11 06:40:44 2012 UTC,Who was the actor that played Will (the congressman's assistant) I can't place the face.
Veep,uvjz2,Pseudo_OSF,0,Mon Jun 11 04:06:46 2012 UTC,Rich Sommer I recognized him from Mad Men if anyone else comes looking. He's not listed on IMDB for the episode for some reason.
Veep,uk8ai,Scroogl,4,Mon Jun 4 14:33:38 2012 UTC,"The best supporting cast member is definitely Tony Hale, I think. The way he broke up with Ted was absolutely fantastic, and his letter of resignation over one mistake, when he has consistently been one of the best at actually filling out his role in the office (keeping Selina fed/happy) was awesome."
Veep,uk8ai,coolcreep,1 point,Mon Jun 4 18:39:31 2012 UTC,"Gary's my total favorite of the series.  The way he quickly says something about people approaching Selina kills me everytime.  My favorite was ""Wife not daughter!"""
Veep,uk8ai,DriveOver,1 point,Tue Jun 5 02:42:17 2012 UTC,"Tony Hale is absolutely perfect, and Reid Scott is playing detached career minded social climber flawlessly."
