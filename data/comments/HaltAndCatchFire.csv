HaltAndCatchFire,3e5omm,ferae_naturae,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:47:23 2015 UTC,Seriously. Their video player is the reason why I stopped watching this show. I couldn't get through an episode without the player failing.
HaltAndCatchFire,3e5omm,includePhreaker,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:11:07 2015 UTC,0.99$ Because that's the cost of average app.
HaltAndCatchFire,3e1oa7,NeptunusMagnus,6,Tue Jul 21 07:20:02 2015 UTC,There's a fan campaign to save the show.
HaltAndCatchFire,3e1oa7,factandfictions7,2,Tue Jul 21 11:45:54 2015 UTC,"I think the reason I began to doubt the show's future is that ""Humans"" seems to be doing more successfully in what is generally regarded as a better time slot (even though it's up against ""True Detective"" and the like). Also, debuting the show right after ""Game of Thrones"" wasn't exactly a vote of confidence in my opinion. I've contacted AMC but it seems hard to get a real fan movement going."
HaltAndCatchFire,3e1oa7,Baba_Ganoush_Big_Guy,2,Tue Jul 21 13:16:38 2015 UTC,"That would be terrible. But I will say, it's pretty exhausting to watch when every week their main story (success/failure of mutiny) gets slapped with a catastrophic problem.   And now Gordon is in a tailspin... It can be frustrating."
HaltAndCatchFire,3e1oa7,MakeFlowers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:51:08 2015 UTC,Yeah... I honestly have no idea where this season is going.  Still enjoy it
HaltAndCatchFire,3e1oa7,NewAnimal,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:20:04 2015 UTC,Trying to do anything about it is just trying to beat back the tide.  The show was in cancellation territory after last season and AMC gambled on it being a slow burner and that's clearly not worked out for them.
HaltAndCatchFire,3e1oa7,ChamberTheBrobot,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:54:54 2015 UTC,Community fan here. I just got into this show a few weeks ago... DONT GIVE UP!! AMC > NBC - they may well respect even a small amount of enthusiasm.
HaltAndCatchFire,3e1oa7,shnnrr,-3,Wed Jul 22 08:05:13 2015 UTC,I'm sticking with it until the end of this season but I don't want to see another season.  This show is a nightmare and knowing that it will end with everyone but Cameron completely screwed is too much.  At the moment I don't want to see a season three. I'll wait till the last episode to decide if I'm going to start actively hoping it's cancelled.
HaltAndCatchFire,3e1oa7,typhonblue,0,Tue Jul 21 23:50:21 2015 UTC,"The writers seem to think it's funny to make Gordon a fool and Cameron and Donna misunderstood geniuses.  They dangled a carrot with his payout at the end of season 1, and then snatched it back ""Bwaha! He has brain cancer we got you"" I can't do it."
HaltAndCatchFire,3dxt9e,IndyBrodaSolo,15,Mon Jul 20 12:30:53 2015 UTC,"As much as I love the show and its characters, S2 has felt a little bit directionless, compared to S1 where there was the clear goal of making+selling the Giant.  I wish they'd kept Gordon healthy. Early in the season it looked like he was either going to be a part of Mutiny, or do it better as a competitor. The saddest moment was when he couldn't even show any interest in a pre-release NES, just a couple of episodes after obsessively analysing and trying to improve Mutiny's tank game."
HaltAndCatchFire,3dxt9e,bluescrn,6,Mon Jul 20 21:07:53 2015 UTC,I am hoping all of this aimlessness is just their lives kind of falling apart before they all pull each other together at the end.
HaltAndCatchFire,3dxt9e,Shermer_Punt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:10:41 2015 UTC,"I agree with your point about direction. S1 felt much more cohesive between the plot and characters and their individual stories. By comparison, it feels like S2 has gone off on tangents in every which direction, with only brief moments of spontaneous cohesion that ultimately don't seem to go forward anywhere.  I've also been quite disappointed with Gordon's story this season, too. You're right, it started off with some promise, but then it just totally derailed into this whole mess to the point of me wondering if they're just in the process of writing him out of the show."
HaltAndCatchFire,3dxt9e,_Cabal_,14,Tue Jul 21 21:40:38 2015 UTC,I love this show but isn't this wishful thinking?  The ratings are terrible. I wish more people would watch this damn show!
HaltAndCatchFire,3dxt9e,Splinter_Pizza,7,Mon Jul 20 18:43:38 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling that they will cancel after this year. As much as I don't want them to. I hope they wait it out and get season 2 up on netflix ASAP. Season 2 is so much better than season 1 that maybe it will get more attention. Otherwise, this show is a goner."
HaltAndCatchFire,3dxt9e,tafluhr,6,Mon Jul 20 20:03:05 2015 UTC,I think season 1 was better. I love season 2 but I have a feeling this shows a goner.
HaltAndCatchFire,3dxt9e,cocoabishnu,6,Mon Jul 20 20:52:07 2015 UTC,"Sorta feel the same.  S2 started out better but overall S1 was more enjoyable, though Limbo was pretty good.  S1 had more focus on the technology rather than relationship drama.  I think Cameron's character and Mutiny in general are hurting the show, and I really don't care about Joe and Sarah's relationship."
HaltAndCatchFire,3dxt9e,evanvolm,3,Mon Jul 20 23:06:13 2015 UTC,"I agreed season 2 is better IMO, I don't know if they will cancel it how is the ratings compared to their other shows like turn and hell on wheels, I don't know anyone who watches hell on wheels, and Halt has to be waaaay cheaper to make since it's all filmed in basically one house"
HaltAndCatchFire,3dxt9e,7screws,4,Tue Jul 21 01:38:09 2015 UTC,"I read that as well but as well all know the all too important age demographic they are shooting for with ratings is not there right now and all the networks are out for is the almighty dollar. It is my hope that AMC does not have too much on the horizon for the fall that they will give it another season as I want to keep making discussion threads for y'all as long as possible.  On a different note - I am very curious to see what they do with the season finale (about to watch last nights episode in less than an hour here as I was at the airport during it). I wonder if they wrote it like they did with 'Parks and Rec' after Season 3 I believe where they never knew if they were going to get picked up again and the season finale could be used as an end of said season episode or an end of series episode.  Whichever way they go, I'm very happy that I got to watch two seasons of an amazing TV show that is simply too intelligent for the average viewer that wants their TV spoon fed to them. Its nice to have something for a bit rather than never that had fantastic writing, acting and everything in between that was not reality bullshit or a played out additional season of a TV show that was not necessary.  Lets keep holding a great thought that it is renewed for a 3rd season on AMC or if it is let go something like Netflix or Amazon picks it up.  a."
HaltAndCatchFire,3dxt9e,asstasticbum,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:00:39 2015 UTC,After making my self watch 3 seasons of the walking dead hoping it became as good as its first season I set my expectations really low on AMC.
HaltAndCatchFire,3dxt9e,caotic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:34:40 2015 UTC,Try to give it another chance. The new showrunner as of season 4+ actually gives a shit for the source material and it's much better as a result. Honestly I think the show's weakest points by far are when they try and do something original and it just drags shit out.
HaltAndCatchFire,3dxt9e,Persian_Assassin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:49:05 2015 UTC,"I guess I really want TWD to be a better show, I have kept watching, and every time I finish an episode I sigh. Even the deaths of characters seem unnecessary and not plot affecting. I get the feeling the are just trying ""Gorge-R-R-Martin"" things up just for the sake of it. Anyways this is r/HACF, and for the first 2 or 3 episodes felt a little bit like a soap opera in the proximity of computers."
HaltAndCatchFire,3dxt9e,caotic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:22:24 2015 UTC,"I guess, I still like it more than the first season. It is kinda slow burn but you know these characters are going to inevitably attract each other no matter how many times they say ""I'm out."" I like the indie dev direction more than the IBM clone so far. I am hoping it'll end with some sort of big event like the conference last time, and points for more Nintendo references."

HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,factandfictions7,2,Mon Jul 13 03:27:16 2015 UTC,"True. It's not that Cameron's not a great programmer (she is), she just sucks at management (and seems to hate it).  For reference: Donna's also a programmer, but she's better at management (she leads by example)."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,GerardKalissimo,5,Mon Jul 13 03:32:40 2015 UTC,Donna isn't a programmer.
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,factandfictions7,5,Mon Jul 13 12:14:00 2015 UTC,"You're right. Donna's a Hardware Engineer. The logic still stands, though. She's better at managing Mutiny (Bos is the only one that surpasses her on that)."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,SawRub,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:53:04 2015 UTC,"They often are, just that they often end up being so terrible at it that they get replaced or tank the company."

HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,ParanoidAndroids,9,Tue Jul 14 04:46:39 2015 UTC,I feel like this is said during/after every episode of this show.
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,carraway,12,Mon Jul 13 02:19:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, generally with good reason. Only this time we get to add ""hypocritical"" to it.   She talks all this talk about Mutiny being ""open"", a place where people can do whatever they feel, everyone has a voice, etc. Of course, we all know that's not true: she'd call Donna her partner then act totally on her own anyway--and occasionally maybe snark at a code monkey.   But now, the rest of the company is seeing how all her talk really means nothing, and worst of all? She's making dictatorial decisions that would greatly impact all their futures without being at all forthcoming, and manipulating them all into supporting it anyway (chanting ""Mutiny!"")."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,15413453452,6,Mon Jul 13 02:40:10 2015 UTC,Mutiny is pretty much the Soviet Union.

HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,ParanoidAndroids,2,Wed Jul 15 22:13:33 2015 UTC,Oh I agree 100%. I hate how she is so utterly unlikable.
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,Wilde_17,11,Mon Jul 13 03:22:43 2015 UTC,"It's like she finally starts to get a bit of character development and you think you might be able to root for her and then she goes and does something incredibly immature again.   I mean gee Cameron, yeah no one likes ""selling out"" but I'm sure the rest of mutiny would rather have food on their tables. The whole plot line of will they/won't they sell was so frustrating to watch! I think in the first season you could argue that she was a bit of the underdog in a sense (along with everyone else at Cardiff) but there's barely anything likable about her at all this season imo."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,aaron91325,10,Mon Jul 13 06:12:20 2015 UTC,I don't think she's supposed to be likeable. That's Donna's role. Cameron is the genius with the single vision. She's going to do whatever it takes to reach her goal... kinda like she did in season 1.   Don't forget that she's still a college-aged kid. Think about how self-centered you(and everyone) were at that age.
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,Wilde_17,3,Mon Jul 13 07:50:47 2015 UTC,"I'm still in college and I'll probably laugh at this when I'm older (not going to risk saying ""ooh but I'm so mature"" haha :P) but I think most people mature out a little at least by that age, or have some sort of respect for other people/self-awareness, idk.   Do you think the fact that she is a genius is a redeeming feature then? It'll be interesting to see where the writers take her character."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,aaron91325,3,Mon Jul 13 08:07:19 2015 UTC,"I'm hard pressed to find what her redeeming features are. Sure she's awesome at coding and has insight into where the future of the industry lies but in that sense she's similar to a Zuckerberg or Jobs, I suppose. I'm not sure that either of those two have character qualities beyond their professions. Maybe that's why they were so successful. For me, it's really hard to root for her but I do find myself rooting for the people she's surrounded by. So maybe that's her redemption, her ability to attract great people? I dunno."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,Mybrainmelts,3,Mon Jul 13 19:16:49 2015 UTC,her actions speak for themselves.
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,nickboy98,7,Mon Jul 13 06:09:44 2015 UTC,That's the point. She's meant to look like she's out of her depth.

HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,typhonblue,3,Mon Jul 13 14:28:53 2015 UTC,"Amazing he was able to do that at 11.  Considering the first season established he was on life support for two years starting around when he was nine.   I guess they had really good rehab in the 1950s. Just a few months to get back into the swing of things after years bedridden, yessir.  And he must have kept up with his schoolwork too since he was in sixth grade at 11.  For the love of God, if they'd just changed one goddamn number in that scene it wouldn't have shived a hole in the continuity and fucked it."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,Wilde_17,9,Mon Jul 13 08:13:00 2015 UTC,"I wonder if it was another one of his lies? Idk, just guessing here but that's what it reminded me of."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,factandfictions7,3,Mon Jul 13 09:57:16 2015 UTC,I thought the same. It felt like that time Gordon ripped Joe's shirt and the scars were revealed.

HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,typhonblue,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:48:46 2015 UTC,Why would he lie here? Let me guess. He's trying to tear Tom and Cameron apart by putting them at odds.  It's a long game I reckon.
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,nidarus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:58:51 2015 UTC,Why would he lie about how he got the scars? Probably the same reason: the truth is something that he's more ashamed of.

HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,typhonblue,2,Mon Jul 13 21:48:11 2015 UTC,Someone else suggested he's lying again. But why? And it's not like it's completely unreasonable that Joe has faced homophobia.
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,MoneyTreeFiddy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:00:07 2015 UTC,Because he is a lying sociopath. He lies when the truth would be easier.

HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,rhadamanthus52,3,Mon Jul 13 02:20:53 2015 UTC,It won't help at this point. CTE is degenerative. The only hope (increasingly rare as they commit to symptoms like this ep) is that it was a misdiagnosis.
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,gatomercado,10,Wed Jul 15 10:57:39 2015 UTC,I have a panic attack every time I watch this show. It's so sad to see Gordon like this :(      I also feel bad for NewWaveLev. He didn't want to meet but was peer pressured into it.
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,scubascratch,5,Mon Jul 13 05:02:02 2015 UTC,Most pushed by Cameron
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,gatomercado,3,Mon Jul 13 07:34:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah her and Bodie were the two. I knew some bad shit was going to happen when Bodie had that dumb smile. If he thinks something is a good idea, don't do it."

HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,factandfictions7,5,Mon Jul 13 07:14:47 2015 UTC,It would be interesting if she were worse than all of them. I think Joe would be quite freaked.
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,kosher_pork,21,Mon Jul 13 16:38:23 2015 UTC,"Our Company  My Company   Make up your goddamn mind and stop stringing your staff along. All of them have stayed behind because they were told it's their company and they're equal partners. That sense of belonging/ownership allowed them to take the pay cuts.  God fucking dammit, Cameron."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,factandfictions7,7,Mon Jul 13 06:53:08 2015 UTC,"That transition from ""our company"" to ""my company"" felt like a power play of sorts. Cameron, in her own way, showed them that they can vote all they want but she retains the power to implement her decision (not very democratic, I know). Suffice to say the whole thing is very unfair, but also in character."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,gro55man,3,Mon Jul 13 16:41:05 2015 UTC,It seems like everybody left in Mutiny are pretty talented. Once again another stupid business decision by Cameron the child. I doubt any of them will have trouble seeking employment somewhere else where they would actually be paid.
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,nidarus,6,Tue Jul 14 15:53:39 2015 UTC,"I think the point of that storyline, and perhaps the episode, is that she did make up her mind.   She realized that the whole hippie ""everybody's equal"" is nonsense (and considering her 90% share, a lie anyway). It's her company, whether the rest of Mutiny like it or not."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,SawRub,2,Mon Jul 13 20:25:09 2015 UTC,"I think at first she thought she wanted it to be a true democracy, but when it was threatened, it became 'my company'."

They can go work somewhere where they don't get to have fun and work with their friends and slack off and be creative all day. They only have that because of her, she made an environment where computer programmers could work like that. Does anybody remember where they were before? It's her company, she decided and she's damn right to do so."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,gro55man,5,Tue Jul 14 06:50:52 2015 UTC,And leave they should and probably will. Cameron takes them all for granted. She's a pretty useless manager/owner.

HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,VicPayback,26,Mon Jul 13 07:35:58 2015 UTC,"Man, they seem to going out of their way to make Cameron really unlikable this season."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,tinyassassin,18,Mon Jul 13 02:15:58 2015 UTC,she's always been unlikable
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,carraway,21,Mon Jul 13 02:16:52 2015 UTC,"In retrospect, this is so true - it was just harder to see because she was juxtaposed against the, frankly, unrealistically sociopathic S1 Joe.   Now that the rest of the show is toned down a bit closer to the land of realism, her insecure/selfish/immature core of a personality is much more salient."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,SawRub,3,Mon Jul 13 02:45:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah Joe being crazy, as well as Cameron's relationship with Boz, made her somewhat less hateable."

If they don't like it they can go away, but they like her vision (and the freedom they get with it) until they think they can get some money out of it? They work creatively and like the way things are because she made them that way, none of them would be where they are if it wasn't for her. Who the hell are they to tell her what to do with her baby? She has too much integrity to sell out and that's an admirable quality. Her vision is more important than the friends she has made or her new romance. Joe does the same thing so many times and doesn't get nearly as much shit."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,JohnCenaLunchbox,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:47:48 2015 UTC,"They stuck around because they were all equals. Now they are not, and they know it.   Plus Cameron is a whiney person with hardly any interpersonal skills, let alone professionalism."

HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,damsel_of_darkness,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:20:44 2015 UTC,"While I agree that they implicitly knew it, there is a vast difference between understanding the unspoken concept of having a leader in a so-called leader-less company, and being forced to recognize--and respect--the fact that she is their leader. It would be like suddenly hearing your parent tell you, after years of promising that they did not have a favorite child, that they really always did love their firstborn more than you. It's a jarring realization, and not only takes time to fully internalize and accept, but could provoke irreparable consequences in the interim."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,possiblyhysterical,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:08:33 2015 UTC,It's amazing to me that people would sympathize with a mass of coders more than the main character of the show whom we know way more about. But I guess the audience is a bunch of nerds so they understand.
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,ParanoidAndroids,5,Sat Jul 18 01:04:28 2015 UTC,Hopefully Donna and Gordon actually communicate for once.

HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,factandfictions7,9,Mon Jul 13 02:39:25 2015 UTC,It would be a twist if yo-yo got a job with Jacob and then helped Westgroup create a competitor for Mutiny.
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,gatomercado,2,Mon Jul 13 03:07:06 2015 UTC,I totally see that happening. Maybe Westgroup will take their offer off the table at a time Mutiny wants to finally sell. Yo-yo will work for whoever can pay him. He also seemed to have a crush on Cameron and seems to be bitter about it.
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,CrashingOnward,8,Wed Jul 15 02:01:08 2015 UTC,With his Nintendo money? Sure. He definitely is the smartest one out of Mutiny so far if he got into consoles.

HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,factandfictions7,8,Mon Jul 13 16:19:39 2015 UTC,"What gets to me is how unhappy he looks. And yes it does feel forced.   I think that Sarah feels threatened by Cameron and she senses that, if Joe has to choose between them, he'll most likely choose Cameron. Judging by next episode's promo, Sarah's got some secrets of her own. Maybe that's how Joe's relationship with her is going to implode.  Either way, Jacob is going to play an important part on the whole ordeal."

HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,drt0,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:16:37 2015 UTC,I suspect moving to California also comes from her desire to have Joe make his own thing and Cali is where the computer business is.

Not only is there internal strife between the co-workers and Cameron, but they are likely to run into the same issue they ran into earlier in the season with infrastructure. It's funny, because in a way, Joe has essentially ruined something else, even though his intention was genuine."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,VicPayback,9,Mon Jul 13 17:25:42 2015 UTC,Tech-savvy early adopter gay bashers? Seriously?
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,nlpnt,29,Mon Jul 13 02:46:44 2015 UTC,In Texas in the '80s as the AIDS crisis was playing out? I don't doubt it.
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,CrashingOnward,8,Mon Jul 13 02:51:17 2015 UTC,"Well you do have to consider that computers were still very expensive, then to have the know how to get online onto a paid bbs service that's not huge or with the ease of access as what we have today. It's really unlikely someone would spend the cash and time to do that back then. Possible but very unlikely considering the small pool required."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,_ben_lowery,8,Mon Jul 13 02:55:25 2015 UTC,It's also possible that the motive to use Mutiny wasn't to go beat up gay people but that they met online and he saw the opportunity.
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,evinugur,2,Mon Jul 13 18:22:59 2015 UTC,Malicious people can have money to spend on things. We don't really see the situation through the perspective of Lev's attacker but I have no issues believing the plausibility of some group of people wealthy enough to have the technology and malicious enough to arrange such an assault. I think you're implying that that's why they'd buy the computer/mutinity but it could merely be their afterthought. The time and location of the show also lends to the plausibility of the situation
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,ultimatebob,15,Mon Jul 20 22:05:31 2015 UTC,It's 1980's Texas. I'd imagine that there were plenty of gay bashers back then.
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,VicPayback,10,Mon Jul 13 02:51:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I think of that more as rednecks, not nerdy types on Commodore 64s. It's entirely possible, just a bit of a stretch."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,preventDefault,6,Mon Jul 13 02:55:16 2015 UTC,"It seems like if they wanted to rob some programmer, they'd have greater success portraying themselves as a girl on the internet… instead of hoping to find the single open homosexual in 1980's Texas.   But the show did kinda imply the whole time it was due to his sexuality."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,R3dR1bb0n,10,Mon Jul 13 04:43:57 2015 UTC,"I dont know how old you are, but hating on gays was still pretty common in the 90s and hell is still pretty widespread. People just dont talk about it in the open anymore.  And that was certainly not just a redneck problem back then. Being a nerd has nothing to do with being liberal, actually very often the exact opposite."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,VicPayback,2,Mon Jul 13 14:14:26 2015 UTC,"I was alive in the 80s, I know what it was like. It's just that as this comment points out, it would take a lot of money and effort to go through with that. Again, not impossible, but an unlikely plot contrivance."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,FishOnHead,3,Mon Jul 13 15:58:54 2015 UTC,"Another comment also points out that they could have been a user of Mutiny already when they stumbled across Lev. All it would take is setting up a fake subscription (as was confirmed) and ba-da-bing ba-da-boom, last night's episode.  I find it entirely realistic that a computer using nerd not using a computer and Mutiny for the express purpose of discriminatory assault, could be prejudiced enough to do this. I've had friends in the 90s that would have been prejudiced enough* to do this (we are no longer friends). Hell, I used to a be a bit homophobic myself, when I was less-informed courtesy of my religious mother. Not that I'd have ever gone to that length. I'm not seeing anything out of the ordinary, but maybe it's because things just haven't really progressed that far in West Virginia. I'm never sure.  Edit: a word"
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,VicPayback,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:23:48 2015 UTC,"Once more, I'm not saying that this kind of thing didn't happen, it's just implausible. They are already implying that Mutiny basically invented everything we know about the internet (broadband, chat rooms, etc.), and are now including ""catfishing."" I like the show, but it can be a bit ridiculous at times and that's mainly what I was trying to point out."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,FishOnHead,2,Tue Jul 14 05:29:02 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, I'm just not seeing what's implausible about being a pre-existing user prior to hatching your scheme?  Computers are expensive and require some knowledge to run...but it doesn't seem likely these people bought a computer to attack Lev, either. They likely were already using one."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,gatomercado,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:37:52 2015 UTC,"Your problem is that you assume many types of people didn't use computers, just nerdy programmer types. Think of HAM radio enthusiast and people use CB radio."

HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,accountII,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:15:06 2015 UTC,We might not know the full story yet. It might be that he was spotted as being on a date and the other guy got away.
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,ferae_naturae,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:08:39 2015 UTC,"20 years ago we had Internet psychos, and today we still have them.  What's odd is the police are still confused as to what to do, or how to catch these guys.  Frickin' technology."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,SoylentGreenIsPurple,3,Tue Jul 14 05:34:29 2015 UTC,They literally want to destroy Mutiny by monetizing it!
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,possiblyhysterical,7,Mon Jul 13 02:13:37 2015 UTC,"Did anyone else see the scene where Sarah's dad basically admitted to not giving a shit about the creative vision of the company? That completely validated Cameron's decision, but everyone wants to pretend that she's an idiot."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,KptKrondog,2,Tue Jul 14 06:53:15 2015 UTC,Well it doesn't help that she didn't relay that conversation she had with Joe to the rest of mutiny.  If she had she would seem a bit less like an ass.
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,nlpnt,2,Thu Jul 16 05:19:20 2015 UTC,...and THAT'S why Cameron doesn't like working for anyone else...
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,shawnee_,4,Mon Jul 13 02:50:19 2015 UTC,5 million dollars in 1985.  Did the writers calculate for bubble inflation a little prematurely?
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,tinyassassin,10,Mon Jul 13 02:41:28 2015 UTC,it's tv.  It was meant to be dramatic as hell.
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,Not_A_Chef,3,Mon Jul 13 02:46:07 2015 UTC,What's so bizarre about a 5 million dollar offer?
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,TehSilencer,3,Mon Jul 13 08:08:05 2015 UTC,"It is worth ""$11,013,215.86"" of 2015's money according to the government's inflation calculator."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,salemjs,6,Mon Jul 13 14:32:19 2015 UTC,"Just like Pied Piper initial offer, huh?"
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,geckahn,3,Mon Jul 13 22:09:12 2015 UTC,"Nope, that was a funding round. Not a sale of the whole company."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,dorncog,3,Tue Jul 14 03:40:18 2015 UTC,Aaand a big F U from Cameron
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,Not_A_Chef,2,Mon Jul 13 02:14:06 2015 UTC,Cameron pisses me off to no end this season.
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,zakl2112,2,Mon Jul 13 08:04:55 2015 UTC,So what's stopping Joe from just starting his own company similar to that of Mutiny.  That's season finale shit right there!
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,tinyassassin,4,Mon Jul 13 02:27:06 2015 UTC,"because he needs cameron, she has the vision, he knows how to sell it and rake in the big bucks"
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,nlpnt,5,Mon Jul 13 02:29:11 2015 UTC,Exactly. If they didn't hate each other and she didn't hate everything he stands for this would be a very different story.
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,factandfictions7,3,Mon Jul 13 02:35:27 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, the problem with those two (apart from the unfinished business) is that they tend to get into a destructive path pretty quickly.   They could be great together, they'd just have to figure out a way not to kill eachother first.."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,possiblyhysterical,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:08:45 2015 UTC,"Exactly, everyone who hates her needs to see that all of this only exists because of her. She created an environment where community was developed."

HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,Kylethetrashpile,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:13:21 2015 UTC,"My prediction, based upon everything that has happened so far, is that Joe will personally end up buying mutiny separately from his ex-father-in-law's company after breaking it off with Sarah. Bosworth will take more of a leadership role within the company before leaving. Cameron and Joe will continue their weirdness but i dont know if they're willing to just ruin her relationship although I doubt Joe will remain single. I think Donna will leave fairly soon and I also think Gordon will accidentally tell her about Jules. When Donna either leaves him or waits for him to die she'll be set from his business though they seem to be heading towards bankruptcy before it takes off with the way Gordon is spending. Either way, Donna ends up in control of the money and continued to whine constantly. I'd also say that over half of Mutiny is going to splinter.  No spoilers, just guesswork"
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,gatomercado,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:02:15 2015 UTC,"Joe is broke though. He would have to get Gordon to buy it, or fund Donna's Community."
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,tinyassassin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:04:01 2015 UTC,boom!  I bet that Tom was just telling a story to manipulate cameron.
HaltAndCatchFire,3d25co,possiblyhysterical,3,Mon Jul 13 02:48:44 2015 UTC,That completely undermines the setup that he's the exact opposite of Joe.
