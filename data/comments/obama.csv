That's like people who are old and can't move, can't hear, can't see more than 10 feet, yet they still have a drivers license and get on the Interstate doing 25 mph.   that shit needs to stop as well.   just because you have a pulse does not mean you should have access to firearms.  Personally i think the larger problem by far is dumb gun owners who let their 4 year old play with their loaded guns unsupervised.  Seems like every single day i'm reading about a story of some child shooting someone ""accidently"" because the parents don't know what proper gun safety is."

In his tenure in office he's grown the debt over 80% from $11-ish Trillion to an estimated $20-ish Trillion.  This means he has incremented the debt nearly as much himself as ALL previous President combined, including Bush. Unemployment is only down if you ignore the herd of elephants in the room: The labor participation rate is a multi-decade lows - people have just quit looking for jobs entirely and are sponging off their fellow citizens in all kinds of clever Obama-enabled ways: Welfare, unemployment, phony disability claims.  The holy grail of liberalism.   Moreover, you can only claim lower unemployment if you assume a job is a job is a job.  But the Obama era is the  era of the fast food worker working multiple jobs because as employers avoid Obamacare and don't hire for the higher paying jobs. Paychecks are not up in any meaningful way.   The middle class (the bulk of the population) either has stagnant or declining buying power. Of course home ownership is up. A zoo animal (arguably smarter than this idiot) would have overseen that. When you enter office with home ownership at all time lows, there is nowhere to go but up.  In actual fact, Obama policies prevented a more rapid and meaningful recovery on all these front.   Obama:  The cure for freedom and prosperity with a parade of fools following him around."

I'll add this, though - would you be willing to see taxes raised significantly on high-income (1mil/year+ for example) earners and the military budget significantly decreased to improve the deficit? That's (part) of what I'd do, but I know the republicans in congress would shit on that idea.  The housing market, price-wise, is basically back to where it was in 2006, at the height of a bubble, but appears to be there as a result of actual value instead of bad loans. I don't know how you can call that anything but a win. The issues I see now are affordability in certain markets and cash speculators who are driving up prices in those same markets, making it harder for prospective buyers looking to actually live in the house they buy. I don't know what the answer is for home ownership, which is actually down since Obama took office, but maybe we're at closer to a realistic level for the percentage of people who should own vs rent now. The idea that home ownership isn't the end-all-be-all has been floated for a while, and certainly a lot of people who shouldn't have had mortgages were getting them prior to the great recession, and that's a big part of what caused it.  I'd like to see affordable condos / townhomes built with the goal of having more low-income people own their place, instead of just renting it, but I haven't heard much about that sort of program."

No.  I'd like to see a flat tax inflicted on everyone without exception including Obama's crackhead base.  If every loser (aka ""Democrat"") actually had some skin in the game paying taxes, they wouldn't be in such a big hurry to waste money on other losers.  And I am happy to see a nice big military - it keeps the bad guys on their toes.  Unfortunately, our military currently suffers under an incompetent dolt as commander who couldn't direct traffic, let alone the direction of a nation.   is basically back to where it was in 2006, at the height of a bubble,   It depends where you live.  What is clear is that home ownership is down, down, down in the Obama economy.  Socialism always fails.   I'd like to see affordable condos / townhomes built with the goal of having more low-income people own their place,   That's what got this whole mess going in the first place:  Leftwing economic fantasies.  The poor should not own homes because they cannot AFFORD them.  How do I know this?  Because I grew up in a working poor family.

The labor participation rate is a multi-decade lows   The labor participation rate has been declining for forty years because the median population age has been increasing for decades. This has nothing to do with Obama.   Paychecks are not up in any meaningful way.    Because the GOP has gutted unions and union membership has plunged. With strong unions, you have meaningful increases in wages. With unions declining, the 1 percent earn more so everyone else must earn less.   Of course home ownership is up.

Please do show me because I am 100% certain I've never ever said that.  What is immoral is you FORCING me (at the point of the government's gun) to help people YOU decide need help.  If you care about them so much then YOU pick up the tab.    The issue isn't the helping, it's the forceful and threatening manner it is applied by 3rd parties."

It's not exactly some big secret. And  o. because why not help someone that needs help."
obama,3cgsuo,veritasserum,3,Wed Jul 8 20:53:18 2015 UTC,"Stealing my money and giving it to someone else   This is exactly the sort of pennywise-but-pound-foolish myopia that plagues American conservatism today.  For nearly two centuries, the US has invested in public post-secondary education, particularly since establishment of the land-grant colleges in the 19th century, which grew into the state college system. So Obama is doing nothing more than advocating we continue that trend, supported by countless Republicans and Democrats for many decades.  Using taxpayer dollars to subsidize higher education is a wise investment in a nation's future. A college-educated American will earn, on average, three times what a non-college educated American will in his or her lifetime. Those increased earnings will not only be reinvested into the economy, fueling economic growth, but will also increase tax revenues in the long term.  For every dollar spent today in publicly funded higher education, the government will earn much more in increased revenue in the decades to come. This will be a very profitable return on investment.  So, no, it's not stealing from you, because your taxes will not be increased by one cent to find this and the US has been doing this already for more than 150 years. In fact, the opposite is true -- your taxes will be lower overall with time; because of publicly funded higher education, we will have a more prosperous society."

obama,3bpwtx,Skyrmir,2,Wed Jul 1 16:20:02 2015 UTC,"If, decades later, we look back and see that the trend has continued, we actually could tie it back to the ACA, as the affects of the recession would have dissipated. So later, yeah, we may be able to see a causal relationship. But right now we're still too close to things to know for sure."
obama,3bpwtx,CaspianX2,2,Wed Jul 1 16:37:14 2015 UTC,"Of course these numbers couldn't be skewed at all due to the influx of employers raising wages massively in one shot.   I think there's a boost and a fall.  I just recently got a decent raise, but I know many people who are not so lucky.  If you work for one of these companies who are suddenly raising all employee salaries to above 70k, then that's a massive part of the formula if some of those employees are currently in the 35-40k bracket, which is happening.   Hopefully these saints, (I recall one story, a CEO who made a few million was cutting his own pay back to 70k and raising all of his employees wages to a minimum of 70k), will start a trend and this will begin happening in places where people aren't making much.  Because currently I feel like those of us who weren't that bad off to start with are being put in a better position but the single mom working doubles at dollar general is still just as poor as before, if not more so.   Definitely on the way up, and it's better, but we have to figure out a better way to narrow the gap."

He most likely wears it whenever he gives any speech in public. You know because he holds the highest office in one of the biggest countries in the World. Some people want him dead for some stupid silly reason they have imbedded in their own head. So you never know when someone will want to take a shot at him.

Threats to the president happen more often than people think. They don't want the media to know about every plot or attempt. That shit stays classified if it's possible.
