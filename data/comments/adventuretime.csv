adventuretime,3e1zq4,graaahh,5,Tue Jul 21 16:51:50 2015 UTC,You should. James Baxter is the most magical non-magical animal ever.
adventuretime,3e1zq4,demicus,4,Tue Jul 21 17:03:13 2015 UTC,Seeing James Baxter makes you realize just how shitty the Ice King's horse costume was.

adventuretime,3e1zq4,rocknin,-12,Tue Jul 21 19:48:34 2015 UTC,This was such a shitty episode.
adventuretime,3dzmlm,oatmonster,16,Mon Jul 20 20:40:33 2015 UTC,"Wow, looks great!  Method/materials?"
adventuretime,3dzmlm,Lollsa01,23,Mon Jul 20 21:19:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  The blade is a piece of wooden trim/moulding with two bevels cut out on the tablesaw to give it a diamond cross section. The crossguard was a two by four cut to shape with a jigsaw. The pommel is an old wooden wheel I had lying around that I embedded two of those little glass pebble things into.   Rough spots and imperfections in the wood were given a layer of bondo and sanded down. After that, the whole thing was primed, sanded, and primed again. Paints are all from a rattle can.   Right now the hilt is just wrapped with electrical tape, I didn't have leather on hand. I'll upload progress pics when I get a chance.  Edit: Here you go!"
adventuretime,3dzmlm,KGSupreme,12,Mon Jul 20 21:39:13 2015 UTC,Well done! The paint job looks really clean. Here are mine so far.
adventuretime,3dzmlm,NotHerbert,5,Tue Jul 21 01:50:52 2015 UTC,"Nice! I really like the ""Finn Sword."""
adventuretime,3dzmlm,Arrythmia,10,Tue Jul 21 01:52:39 2015 UTC,Where'd you learn the name?  I've been watching the sword upgrades since the get go (yay leveling up!) but I never picked up on a name.
adventuretime,3dzmlm,brunosssaur,9,Mon Jul 20 22:20:48 2015 UTC,I just got it from the wiki. It references one of the games as the source.
adventuretime,3dzmlm,WizKoulikov,6,Mon Jul 20 22:23:26 2015 UTC,AKA Golden Sword of Battle :)
adventuretime,3dzmlm,coltsblazers,4,Mon Jul 20 22:45:28 2015 UTC,"Apparently, they say it's Scarlet (a she) in one of the videogames."
adventuretime,3dzmlm,capntom13,3,Mon Jul 20 22:29:25 2015 UTC,"It comes from the first game ""Hey Ice King, Why'd You Steal Our Garbage"". I like it and use that name as well."
adventuretime,3dzmlm,GentlemanIntheSuit,8,Tue Jul 21 02:22:03 2015 UTC,It's name is Scarlet because Finn is colorblind...?
adventuretime,3dzmlm,Gobitto,3,Mon Jul 20 23:40:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I was so confused, ""isn't scarlet a red color? Then why is it blue?"""

adventuretime,3dzdyv,Always_LeaveANote,36,Mon Jul 20 19:39:46 2015 UTC,"It is a bit of a soul searching season, which means it's dealing with much more abstraction. To me, Jake the Brick is one of the best episodes of the show, ever."
adventuretime,3dzdyv,hybrination,3,Mon Jul 20 19:51:57 2015 UTC,I love the mellow guitar playing in the backround as jake describes what he seeing:)
adventuretime,3dzdyv,Emilecardinal,12,Tue Jul 21 02:16:02 2015 UTC,My main gripe is that the humor doesn't feel as strong as previous seasons.  I mean on average there are some good funnies in this season but they feel less frequent and less clever. Thing is humor IS subjective so sombody could easily dissagree and I would have no argument.
adventuretime,3dzdyv,blazzerftw,7,Mon Jul 20 20:19:05 2015 UTC,"I feel that has less to do with episodes being ""unfunny"" and more to do with the bleak tone of this season compared to others."
adventuretime,3dzdyv,BestNameEver_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:46:55 2015 UTC,"Maybe they couldn't put a lot of new jokes in without repeating themselves. I don't know, AT is a very creative show but I feel a lot of the usual funny scenarios have been done. I think the next season will be very unusual as well, the show never disappoints in that regard."
adventuretime,3dzdyv,creyk,6,Tue Jul 21 15:16:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah it did feel really different and I still can't really describe it. Not bad per say, but I preferred earlier seasons. That said, Jake the Brick was awesome haha!"
adventuretime,3dzdyv,lovemyMFLB,5,Mon Jul 20 20:02:58 2015 UTC,"I just wanna say that there is a LOT of crossover in this season, that's one of my favorites things about it. I just watched ""Giuseppe"" and noticed Abracadaniel said ""If we just surrender to these events, the answer will reveal itself!"" I won't spoil it, but that was some really early foreshadowing."
adventuretime,3dzdyv,BestNameEver_,4,Mon Jul 20 23:58:27 2015 UTC,"It was kinda different compared to the earlier seasons, but in my opinion, it was still a REALLY good season. It's probably my favorite."
adventuretime,3dzdyv,GamerFox-01,4,Mon Jul 20 20:01:12 2015 UTC,"Completely agree with you. I understand that it's Finn's maturing period and all, but something is missing from what first attracted me to AT that's in all the other seasons (1-5). Sorry, I know lots of people love this season, but this was my least favorite one."
adventuretime,3dzdyv,birds_of_the_air,12,Tue Jul 21 01:48:40 2015 UTC,"You mean Jake the Brick that got nominated for an Emmy?   No, the season was pretty great. :)"
adventuretime,3dzdyv,speakinred,9,Mon Jul 20 19:50:58 2015 UTC,He didn't ask if it was good or not... :)
adventuretime,3dzdyv,RigattoniJones,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:56:45 2015 UTC,"They asked if it was strange though, and /u/speakinred disagreed and said it was great, not strange."
adventuretime,3dzdyv,Nikittele,4,Mon Jul 20 21:03:39 2015 UTC,Why can't it be both?
adventuretime,3dzdyv,speedyskier22,3,Tue Jul 21 05:51:27 2015 UTC,"For me it begun good, lost it, found it at Jake the brick, forgot some good characters and history (marceline) and ended promising a good future (a potential good season 7)."
adventuretime,3dzdyv,Apollyon42,3,Mon Jul 20 20:10:36 2015 UTC,I love the few episodes leading to jake the brick almost as much as I love jake the brick. I feel like it's the most we've seen jake grow in the entire series
adventuretime,3dzdyv,fuqdeep,3,Mon Jul 20 20:46:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with everyone else, it's good in a different way than all the previous seasons. I really liked it, though it's not my favourite."
adventuretime,3dzdyv,nawanawa,3,Mon Jul 20 20:51:39 2015 UTC,"Oh well, if you find that oddly different wait for the last episode."
adventuretime,3dzdyv,artisticMink,3,Mon Jul 20 21:33:27 2015 UTC,"All of the episodes from that last week, actually"
adventuretime,3dzdyv,MahatK,3,Tue Jul 21 02:10:26 2015 UTC,Yes. I think it suffered from being spread out so much and broadcast so sparodicaly tbh
adventuretime,3dzdyv,flamingmongoose,2,Mon Jul 20 21:36:11 2015 UTC,"The season was a bit more experimental... bleak, somber, and contemplative.  The humor was less ""lolz fartz"", and more subtle, but it was still there. I really dug it, and I think it's one of the best (although I'd love a return to a season four-esque style)."
adventuretime,3dzdyv,Way_Moby,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:24:27 2015 UTC,how would you define season four-esque style? What set that season apart?
adventuretime,3dzdyv,creyk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:21:41 2015 UTC,"A healthy combination of silliness and goofiness, mixed with world-building and a willingness to explore (formerly) one-off characters. I think both season 5 and 6 veered a little too dark for me to say that they're my favorites. I really like how season 4 produced some really silly episodes (""Card Wars"", ""Gotcha!"") but also some legitimately dark and touching ones (""I Remember You"", ""Lady & Peebles"")."
adventuretime,3dzdyv,Way_Moby,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:24:25 2015 UTC,"That is a great explanation, thank you :]"
adventuretime,3dzdyv,creyk,2,Tue Jul 21 18:25:15 2015 UTC,"It's by far the strangest season yet and it's worth the watch.  There's a lot of incredibly special episodes in the batch. It also tries to string together things as a whole to a greater degree, but it fell a little short for me in the end.  Maybe retrospectively I can fully appreciate it for what they were doing."
adventuretime,3dzdyv,badgraphix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:26:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I certainly respect it. Kind of reminds me of the final season of Futurama, it's just so tonally different."
adventuretime,3dzdyv,Stinky_WhizzleTeats,2,Tue Jul 21 05:33:12 2015 UTC,"I thought it lost a little of its spirit when Penn left and it became more somber and mellow and slower. I still think it's a good season overall but I don't want it to have ""seasonal rot"" like Dexter's Lab and the Powerpuff girls after tartofsky and McCracken left their shows to pursue other interests"
adventuretime,3dzdyv,bumgrub,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:50:22 2015 UTC,"A lot of people seem to have mix feelings, but it really was an amazing season. I suggest people actually look through the episode and review everything we've had the privilege of seeing because a LOT happened. I tried to sum it all up, but it took too long. It's definitely my favoruite season of all. We learned so much about the characters and the Land of OOO, and I doubt they will be able to top this next season, especially since they have said that they are going ""back to the shows roots""."
adventuretime,3dzdyv,meowstix,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:27:19 2015 UTC,"I haven't finished it either. I do find it a bit strange; however, I also find it amazing. Different isn't always bad to me."
adventuretime,3dzdyv,twerpturd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:06:47 2015 UTC,"You're definitely not crazy, OP.  But I took it in stride.  The excitement regarding AT when it first premiered was our bewilderment over what it was exactly.  People couldn't pigeonhole what they were seeing, and there was also the hope that it would evolve into something even greater (which it TOTALLY did).  If AT was defying out expectations and refusing to settle into a formula this season, it was being the AT we always loved."
adventuretime,3dzdyv,oldme616,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:29:20 2015 UTC,Jake the Brick was nominated for an Emmy sooooo
adventuretime,3dzdyv,MahatK,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:57:24 2015 UTC,"For me it was the best season so far. As I see it, AT has been developing and getting more and more mature just as Finn is. So the first seasons are very childish in a way, while this last one is incredibly deep and full of abstractions and metaphysics stuff."

adventuretime,3dvuo2,zephyrtr,5,Mon Jul 20 13:08:44 2015 UTC,By far the funniest ending to an AT episode

The most common answers are that he is either getting powers from the grass sword, or that he has powers because he is a reincarnation of a Catalyst Comet.  In the episode The Tower, we can very obviously see his powers come into play.  He summons the materials to build a tower and get a magic arm simply because of his emotions.  In previous episodes we have seen him summon hordes of butterflies to aid him.  In the recent finale, he willed Banana Man to save Jake, just as he willed Martin Mertens to save him."

Prismo is a lover of strong flavours, I bet he would be spicy. He also has that otherworldly quality, so he would need to be an unusual flavour combination.  Marceline is going to taste like mostly red things, probably mostly strawberry, but again she would have a sharp twist, maybe lemon? Or mint, because she's so cool.  Ice king would have some mint because of the cooling sensation, but with something underneath the surface, something sweet... Also I think Ice king should be a strong flavour because he is very bombastic.  I don't know what Finn would taste like, but I feel something grassy would be appropriate, not just because of the whole blade of grass thing, but also because he is very outdoorsy and hates being inside.  Jake loves food of all kinds, so he is the hardest to pin down. He is also a quite spicy kind of guy, and I expect he would taste very similar to prismo.  Lady rainicorn should be a mix of many flavours, but nothing too cloying because she is very bright.  Hope that helps!"

I have had many similar thoughts about many of the characters you mention.  I had forgot about the spicy pickles thing with prismo, but then agian, I don't really know how that would play out as a vape. I had actually imagined him with a fresh raspberry lemonade style taste, not sure why, it just feels like it would fit well.  I like the idea with something pepperminty and red for Marceline.  Ice king should definitely be bombastic  Finn and Jake are very difficult because they are main characters and quite dynamic. for some reason I would like Finn to be some form of milkshake or icecream. Jake should be buttery bacon pancakes  for Lady rainicorn I was thinking skittles or starburst."

I just find it strange that videos like this always pit cartoons against each other as if they are competing and one must ""win"" or something. I don't care if people prefer one cartoon to another, but it's almost like they way people pick sides in political debates... the analysis is interesting, but I just don't understand the whole ""picking sides"" mentality. They're just telling stories."

adventuretime,3dtes6,CouldaBeenWorse,5,Tue Jul 21 05:26:25 2015 UTC,"TBH a lot of ""improvements"" people suggest for the show would make it a meh version of Steven Universe if you ask me. What if I said Steven Universe should cut back on plot/development episodes, increase philosophy, expand the world more, and allow for more filler/experimental episodes? All you have then is a mediocre attempt at imitating AT.   What most people are looking for in AT (more action, plot development, and ""feelz"") they'll find in SU and end up not being able to appreciate AT for what it is. This guy has some valid points, but I feel like he's comparing apples to oranges."
adventuretime,3dtes6,BestNameEver_,9,Mon Jul 20 05:19:17 2015 UTC,"What is this guy's deal? He just reeks of ""stop-liking-what-I-don't-like"" attitude. I haven't seen this video of his, but he's made one prior to this where he whines about Adventure Time not aligning with his expectations and so he won't be watching anymore.  I mean, you can't like both? Or better still, keep your boring opinion to yourself - nobody cares what you think. Just because you have an opinion, doesn't mean you should make a 15-minute video about it.  End rant.  Good day."

He made several valid arguments and stated himself that he does not mind if people like Adventure Time, he was just sharing a thought that he (and what he felt like others) had about the show as of late. No need to be so cold and close-minded."
adventuretime,3dtes6,ultibman5000,7,Sun Jul 19 18:40:00 2015 UTC,"I have nothing against people expressing their opinions, it's just that a lot of people shouldn't because, well...they add nothing of value. Take the creator of this video for example: he is constantly contradicting himself, I mean just look at the title of the video. And then - like you said - during the video, he says: ""oh, I have nothing against people liking Adventure Time, but this is why you shouldn't like it. I mean it's totally fine - you liking AT, even though there's a way better cartoon here in Steven Universe. But again, totally fine. [Sic]""  Like I said, contradicting himself. He could've just said his piece and then gone, there was no need to make a second 15-minute video about why he thinks Adventure Time has gone down the toilet.  Anyway, I've gone on long enough. Hope I was able to assuage some of your worries about me."
adventuretime,3dtes6,AbdulRakhib,0,Sun Jul 19 21:32:05 2015 UTC,"Value is subjective, there could've been several subscribers who wanted him to make such a video, and he could be validating his opinion to himself as if practicing in front of mirror. If someone wants to say their piece, let them say it. It's not harming anybody. Can you give me an actual timestamp from the video where he says something like that? It sounds to me like you're demonizing him for having a different opinion, yourself. :P"
adventuretime,3dtes6,ultibman5000,2,Tue Jul 21 04:43:50 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I forgot that it's difficult to distinguish between a serious tone and a joke on the Internet, without the signifiers ""lol"" and/or ""jk kidding"". In regards to your last question - don't we all to some extent? That's exactly what the guy from the video is also doing: for some odd reason, he doesn't like the fact that Adventure Time doesn't cater to his needs specifically and has decided that because of that, the show is a failure.  That's not why I'm ragging on this guy though; my point is, he's already said all of this in a previous video and I just don't see the point of making a second video where he repeats himself. So there you have it, my problem isn't with his views on Adventure Time, I think I just don't like him because he's full of himself."
adventuretime,3dtes6,AbdulRakhib,5,Tue Jul 21 14:22:01 2015 UTC,"The complaint against the story arcs was valid. I personally have no problem with it, but Adventure Time has the issue of dropping things and abandoning continuity. I think it compliments the show and allows it to exist as a sort of catalogue of the land of Ooo, but from a storytelling point of view, it is incoherent.  I wish this post was not so downvoted, because it is a good analysis of the show, even if it comes from the perspective of someone who thinks that this aspect of the show is a negative thing."

adventuretime,3dtes6,CouldaBeenWorse,2,Tue Jul 21 05:29:40 2015 UTC,"The single episodes with never-revisited characters are one of my favorite things about adventure time. The world is complex and chaotic. Every character doesn't need to I teract with every other character.  I think I preferred the themes of the later episodes than the early ones. I feel there are less ""lessons"" but it goes I to some rather heavy shit. Maybe those situations are lost on the video's author for some reason.  I enjoy Adventure time because it's mostly story arc free. And I don't think it's as free as the video author makes it seem. Sure, villains don't have arcs, but that's not the only conflict.

adventuretime,3djhyg,DrNeato,5,Fri Jul 17 15:57:03 2015 UTC,"In the episode, his conflict was choosing between the three mirrors, which represented Id (desires), Ego (reason) and Superego (morality). I think that was a test to see if someone was ""worthy"" of joining Matthew, and Finn didn't even hesitate to choose the third mirror so he could save Lemongrab.  Finn definitely learned something from his comet experience. At first he was trying to control everything and fulfill his role as the hero, and in the end he accepted that there is no ""universal intention"" and some things are just beyond control. This is pretty clear when he says to his dad ""Well, there is no changing you, I guess""."

adventuretime,3djhyg,lava_soul,14,Fri Jul 17 15:04:54 2015 UTC,"Unpopular opinion, I think SU has become a much better show than AT.   The last few seasons of AT, I'd finish a lot of episodes feeling a little dry, wondering where the heart went. Turns out, it went to SU.  Adventure time has become a mishmash of ""quirky"" episodes, but it all seems sort of phoned in and uninspired, and sort of forgets what makes the characters tick. (For the record, I love the stranger, good AT episodes, say ""BMO Lost"" or ""All the Little People"" or ""Dungeon Train,"" because they're so thoughtfully strange, and at their core are about fleshing out the show's characters.)  Steven Universe always has a laser focus on the character/emotional story beneath the surface. And lately had been doing a great job balancing the domestic drama at the show's core with the bigger lore.   And the hit to AT'S music when Rebecca Sugar left was worse than I'd thought. Honestly, sometimes it's just bad now."
adventuretime,3djhyg,sethescope,6,Fri Jul 17 13:33:07 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that the last season lacked in the emotional department, but season 5 had plenty of gems: All the Little People, Jake the Dad, Bad Little Boy, Simon and Marcy, Puhoy, James Baxter, Be More, Time Sandwich, Box Prince...   And I don't think SU has found a balance between drama and plot yet. Keystone Motel, while cute and all, felt sooo drawn out and kinda contrived. That being said, it's mostly a pretty good show."
adventuretime,3djhyg,lava_soul,2,Fri Jul 17 15:57:44 2015 UTC,"To be fair, apparently unbeknownst to most, the drama IS the plot. That's why the writers say there are no filler episodes. The story is supposed to be very character-centric, not lore-centric."

adventuretime,3djhyg,Cpt_Catnip,3,Fri Jul 17 03:43:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think season 1 is atrocious, it's just as the audience there isn't a complete understanding of why things are as they are and we're not completely told until Steven starts learning it himself. I do feel the first few episodes feel a bit naff whilst watching them but once you get further in the season you appreciate them more for what they set up."

adventuretime,3djhyg,JGDawg,2,Fri Jul 17 17:55:20 2015 UTC,I personally enjoy it.
adventuretime,3djhyg,ThisIsNotMyBody,4,Fri Jul 17 09:17:28 2015 UTC,"I should hope so, since it stole Rebecca Sugar from us!  If she's writing for it, I imagine it isn't terrible, although the little I've seen hasn't really appealed too much."

adventuretime,3djhyg,ergman,2,Fri Jul 17 11:40:27 2015 UTC,"when I think of single episodes, I don't think a single one is fantastic on their own without prior knowledge. Steven Universe (more specifically on the bigger episodes) really builds up on what came before and the past needs to be known by the audience. Steven Universe is fantastic when binging like 20-30 episodes at a time. I've grown to like it a lot more than Adventure Time currently, even though AT has gone further into it's bigger story than SU has so far, but the little hints of it is what's making me enjoy SU so much more than any other show I currently watch (including non-cartoons)"
adventuretime,3djhyg,MrScottyTay,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:21:58 2015 UTC,"Yep, just like AT it has a little ramp up time, but for me AT's ramp up was 3 seasons, SU had around 10-15 episodes. But SU is very similar to AT, but it brings more feels constantly, since its rebecca sugar."
adventuretime,3djhyg,Bigmethod,9,Sun Jul 19 20:02:50 2015 UTC,I could understand if it doesn't win. It's a great episode out of context but in context it's perfect. All these big story elements stop and the important characters we are so heavily invested in just listening to something so simple. If you don't know the characters then the impact won't be as great.
adventuretime,3djhyg,leon385,8,Thu Jul 16 22:30:50 2015 UTC,"If history repeats itself, its biggest competition is probably Mickey Mouse (seeing that it's beaten AT two years in a row)"
adventuretime,3djhyg,ME24saken,44,Thu Jul 16 22:05:51 2015 UTC,Jake the Brick is such a great episode. I'm going to rewatch it right now!

adventuretime,3djhyg,weiers08,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:26:24 2015 UTC,"I think its pretty cute and enjoyable. Think of it as the art school younger sibling of Adventure Time. Both are super unique story and 11 minutes long. Characters are flawed, versatile, and easy to like. I think it brings up topics generally not seen in a lot of shows, especially not kids shows. Plus the music numbers are as cute as the adventure time ones."
adventuretime,3djhyg,Fruitsniffer,5,Fri Jul 17 22:28:01 2015 UTC,One of my favorite episodes. I can't comment on its competition but I think it really deserves the win.

I'm not exactly sure what I love about it so much but it really does speak to me."

adventuretime,3djhyg,Fbulol,3,Fri Jul 17 02:47:23 2015 UTC,"I think it's because it can stand alone as an episode, rather than the lore filed ones (which I agree I prefer over this one)."

adventuretime,3dp3c7,ThatPickleGuy,5,Sat Jul 18 02:28:33 2015 UTC,"Its best to watch from the beginning to understand all the characters and story arcs. However there are some awesome one off episodes that could get you a feel for the show. Some of my personal favorites were The Real You, Thank You, Princess Cookie, Card Wars, Puhoy, Time Sandwich, and Jake the Brick (which was nominated for an emmy). Alot of the best episodes require background knowledge of characters and general lore so I'd definitely recommend watching the entire thing. Episodes are only 11 minutes each so it won't take too long. Adventure Time has produced some amazing television so I hope you can enjoy it all"
adventuretime,3dp3c7,yellowfellow378,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:33:20 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is a good post. I probably will just go in order like Arrythmia suggested, but I'll make sure to keep an eye on these episodes.   I'm mostly worried that the Ryan North characterization of the cast, the one I'm used to, will affect how I see the television cast. Is the feel of the comics similar to the show? Or has Ryan North's writing kind of changed the style of humour?"
adventuretime,3dp3c7,yellowfellow378,3,Sat Jul 18 03:43:15 2015 UTC,"I haven't read the comics so I couldn't say, but I'm sure other people here can"
adventuretime,3dp3c7,ToastedFishSandwich,3,Sat Jul 18 03:46:16 2015 UTC,I found the comics to be pretty similar to the show. They're pretty much as accurate as they could get.
adventuretime,3dp3c7,CouldaBeenWorse,2,Sat Jul 18 21:59:59 2015 UTC,"Ryan North gives the characters a sort of single-tone optimistic attitude which only barely reflects the characters' emotional development in the show. At least in the first ten comic arcs or so. If you like the overzealous optimistic enthusiasm in the early comics, you might be upset, but otherwise, you should adjust to the original characterization of the cast without much issue. But you have enough background at this point to watch any of the recommended background episodes above. I would also suggest Wizards Only, Fools and Little Brother if you want a break from the early seasons when you watch from the beginning. None of these episodes have much plot dependence, so it might be fun to watch them early.  Hug Wolf is a similar episode from an earlier season. The Creeps as well.  I would watch some of these before you get to them in order, but it never hurts to go in order, so do what feels good.  edit: Also Another Way is a good season 3 episode."
adventuretime,3dp3c7,ToastedFishSandwich,3,Sun Jul 19 19:20:49 2015 UTC,Watch the show.

adventuretime,3dldz0,Firstasatragedy,14,Fri Jul 17 05:24:07 2015 UTC,I absolutely love all the surreal and occult themes that show is touching upon. Magic Man's story is one that hit close to home.
adventuretime,3dldz0,_r4ph431,9,Fri Jul 17 05:56:32 2015 UTC,"Currently on season 6, episode 11. It's fucking weird, man. Seems like whoever is writing and animating starting taking acid. I really hope it gets better soon, because there has been pretty much zero story progression so far. The big twist at the end of season 5 (no spoilers) is pretty much solved in the first two episodes.  Honestly, it isn't that the humor is weird or surreal, it's just that there isn't much humor at all in some of the episodes. Just bizarre things happening and no explanation as to why, and no resolution at the end. It departed from the ""two bros roamin' the lands and havin fun"" and went to ""hey, here's some weird shit and now our characters are really emotional.""  Anyways, I think it's kinda in a recess right now. Hopefully it pulls out some good stuff soon.  Oh, and to answer your question: Season 5 is best, imo. Enjoy it!"
adventuretime,3dldz0,RationalGoblin,3,Fri Jul 17 08:45:36 2015 UTC,"You've gotta remember that AT was never intended to have a deep story it would focus on regularly, however I do also wish they would to it more commonly than they do. After the halfway mark there are many, many great episodes and a few story ones as well. Look forward to Evergreen!"
adventuretime,3dldz0,PenguinPirate4,2,Sat Jul 18 11:19:37 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah, of course. I mean, technically, it's a kids show. The backstory is what made season 5 really interesting for me, though, especially with Marceline and Ice King.  Looking forward to the later episodes!"
adventuretime,3dldz0,RationalGoblin,7,Sat Jul 18 17:21:22 2015 UTC,"I feel as though after Pen Ward left, the direction got a bit... too real if that makes sense. Its around the episode about the cycle of life. Jakes kids start telling him off for not working, and just that takes me out of the whole sureal world since nothing about reality applies to them or phases them, but his kids are there trying to drag him down... I dunno. I feel like its lost its passion for adventure for the sake of adventure..."
adventuretime,3dldz0,DontCatchLupus,5,Fri Jul 17 18:13:52 2015 UTC,I think I could point to each season and say a different thing they each did best (though I'd have to rewatch earlier ones). Season 6 is my favourite though.   I'm a huge jesse moynihan fan though so thats no suprise. Super excited for him to do more episodes with sam alden!
adventuretime,3dldz0,oposssom,5,Fri Jul 17 09:10:07 2015 UTC,"Definitely better as it goes on imo, background stories unravel and are linked to things that happened waaaay back in the series, which is awesome!  Rewatching episodes will be fun just for that reason (finished watching S6 yesterday)."
adventuretime,3dldz0,kynrael,4,Fri Jul 17 14:01:08 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest problem is that the ""Adventure"" is gone from Adventure Time. I still love the show, but it tends to wax philosophical a lot in Season 6 and focus even more mature topics without really taking the time to carefully place it in the AT world and instead shoehorn AT stuff into this theme they're going for. Season 7 apparently will take a step back from this though and despite all this I still love season 6 and all of AT, but there is a sense of whimsy that was prevalent and my favourite part of the early seasons which is pretty much missing in S6."
adventuretime,3dldz0,BloodChicken,2,Sat Jul 18 12:17:45 2015 UTC,"I was going to say this as well. Something happened and now there just isn't the same sense of go anywhere, do anything questing that the early days had."

adventuretime,3dldz0,Shaby28,5,Sat Jul 18 22:47:34 2015 UTC,"I loved the show initially and loved how there was all of this hardcore, plot heavy stuff going on in the background. As the show progressed, this was drawn to the foreground and we started to understand more about the Great War, tragic character origins, and the current state of the world.  Then things got incredibly intense with ""Escape from the Citadel"", Finn meets his dad, loses an arm, discovers the threat of the Lich invading with an army of incredibly dangerous aliens. Things escalate even further as we learn about the Catalyst Comet and the destruction it's foretold to bring.   And then, suddenly, out of nowhere things just fizzle out. After all this promise of a great threat, plot intensifying to a boiling point, the Catalyst Comet actually arriving, nothing. All of the intense story moments we were promised just kind of get wrapped up nonchalantly and there is no large plot development to show for it.  This is what has turned me off from the show. For whatever reason it just threw away all the momentum it had been gaining and has thrown a bunch of filler our way. It's still a decent show, but this has prevented it from being the amazing show that I used to see it as."
adventuretime,3dldz0,Lord-Octohoof,2,Fri Jul 17 18:22:03 2015 UTC,"I think it got better. It becomes more story focused, which I love."
adventuretime,3dldz0,DevilDjinn,2,Fri Jul 17 14:54:25 2015 UTC,Progressively better since S01E01 and has now reached the point where its plateaued as a favourite show and therefore won't get better or worse IMO unless something crazy good/bad happens.
adventuretime,3dldz0,Howseh,2,Sat Jul 18 14:13:24 2015 UTC,"For me: Season 6 < 1 < 4 < 2 < 5 < 3  Mixed bag, I guess."

I guess, most of all, it hasn't done anything big or surprising enough plot-wise to keep my interest piqued.  Also, since it's come out, other shows with stronger story & character development (like Steven Universe) have popped up and they've consumed my interest more than AT. I still watch new AT episodes but I'm not nearly as big a fan as I used to be."

adventuretime,3deck6,kidkolumbo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:36:56 2015 UTC,"It feels like a mix of Evangelion and Attack on Titan, but I've only seen the first 10 episodes of Attack on Titan.  They get attacked by weird aliens, and a lot of people die.  It's kind of Shonen-y, since the main character is super special and perfect at everything and all the girls want him, however thankfully he's not annoying.  I do like it.  It presents things without explaining it till later, and you can really feel the desperation from the fights, tow things I love in any narrative.  If you can deal with typical anime bullshit like ""don't watch me change"" kind of things, you'll likely find something to like, and that stuff rarely, rarely happens.  However, you also have to work past it's animation.  On one hand, it's an intentional style.  On the other hand, it's ugly.  I watch it for the plot, not really for the eye candy.  But, it does some some really cool scenes that rise above the rest of the show."
adventuretime,3deck6,Pantscada,2,Thu Jul 16 23:47:12 2015 UTC,"The way you described the animation reminds of RWBY. The animation for the models isn't too great, but the fight scenes are fantastically well done. The animation also gets better in the second season. If you haven't watched it, I recommend it."

adventuretime,3deck6,everfalling,18,Wed Jul 15 20:05:36 2015 UTC,I think it's because it's a reused model from a more risque source.

With 5 being the all-time high. It's just that you need to know some of the characters from the first few season to really appriciate some of the things going on in 4,5 and 6. Oh well, but it's nagging on a high level."
adventuretime,3dhli7,artisticMink,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:42:16 2015 UTC,Season four is my favorite if only because it's the first season I saw as it aired. Plus many of the episodes are just awesome. I really have been digging the vibe these last few seasons too. Seasons five and six were both awesome.   I feel kind of bad saying it but I think season one is my least favorite. Not that it's bad... In fact much of it is excellent! It's just that the highest highs of season one don't really compete with the highest highs of other seasons.

""Another Way"" is so shrill and unpleasant.  I hate that episode.  He was paired up with Bert Youn, so otherwise their episodes were half great (Tom's half) and half dull.  I like Tom's solo ""Thank You"" but it's not very funny.  It's just an interesting episode.  Kent and Somvi's episodes around this time cemented Somvi's status as a hated storyboarder who made slow, irritating episodes.  I've made a complete 180 on him because of his recent episodes with Seo Kim, but there was a legitimate reason I had to be won over.  Jesse Moynihan was stellar the entire season.  He carried this season on his back.  Adam and Rebecca went .000 in season three.  Awful, awful episodes."

adventuretime,3dfyvs,twerpturd,5,Thu Jul 16 06:07:50 2015 UTC,"regarding the overarching backstory:  they don't have a unified plan regarding the show.  what individual writer/artists do is introduce something, like a character or place or aspect of the AT universe.  then sooner or later, sometimes years later, somebody will take that something and make a story out of it.  sometimes one writer/artist will introduce and run with an idea.  for example, Wizard City is mostly Jesse Moynihan's baby.  sometimes lots of different writer/artists nudge a character in different directions.  it makes sense for a show that is more a bunch of glimpses into various lives instead of one focused story.  our own lives don't have ""destinies"" that we are born with, and few people know their ""life goals"" early in life and immediately work towards it, or have only one life goal.  outside of just how entertaining it is, it makes me proud to be an AT fan because its approach to storytelling is pluralistic.  it represents the way a thriving society doesn't force a common goal upon anyone, but instead allows us to work together towards our separate, sometime conflicting goals."

adventuretime,3da689,ziggykareem,20,Tue Jul 14 19:38:29 2015 UTC,"Unknown, I can attempt to answer. Also, note: We're going to be ignoring most cosmic and otherworldly entities, as they technically reside outside of Ooo. Though, the current strongest cosmic entity is GOLB.  Currently, regarding the strongest entity on Ooo proper, is a tossup between the following:   Finn - He was revealed to have come to Ooo as a Catalyst Comet, and is thus a cosmic entity. Beyond just having been a Comet, Finn is noted as also potentially being such a major piece of the fabric of reality that other Comets may have come from him.  The Lich - Also possibly a Comet-generated entity , the Lich is not only as powerful as Finn (potentially), but he also has knowledge of the ""time before time."" The implications of that are, as of yet, unknown - but the fact that he knows such implies he has a great depth of knowledge far beyond most others. Gunter/Orgalorg - So, Orgalorg is one of the few known entities to exist from before time. Orgalorg's reputation precedes him, and he's both markedly cruel and exceptionally powerful, having been known to destroy worlds (though he did manage to get banished by Grob Gob Glob Grod). Ice King/Simon Petrikov - The Ice King, himself, is not innately powerful - rather, his crown is. His ability to control the crown, though, is what ultimately gets the Ice King onto this list. The crown itself was designed by Urgence Evergreen to stop a Catalyst Comet, and thus it can be assumed that Ice King could potentially harness that power. As such, he would have an ""automatic trump card"" for both Finn and The Lich, should he have both the ability and will to do so. One other interesting thing to note is the Ice Kings ability to physically disrupt the ""source code of the universe"" - an ability that, thus far, no other character has been able to accomplish. This would technically supersede any ability that any character could have, discluding GOLB (who can directly affect not only this universe, but all others as well). Goliad and/or Stormo - Technically, both Goliad and Stormo have an unlimited potential for growth. The more they learn, the stronger they become. Before Goliad was stopped, she had managed to acquire telekinesis as well as the ability to reanimate the dead in a short order of time, and it could be assumed that if she hadn't been stopped, she would have acquired the abilities necessary to distort and shape reality.   Now, with that list, we can start pairing down based on direct comparisons:   Gunter is subservient to Ice King, and was defeated by Finn when he transformed into Orgalorg. Finn technically defeated the Lich on more than one occasion, but it was only through luck or providence (e.g. giving the Lich life through Citadel Milk), which tend to follow Finn where he goes. The Lich technically defeated Finn on more than one occasion, but only to be set back later. Ice King is constantly defeated by Finn, but managed to defeat the Lich on Farmworld Ooo. Goliad and Stormo cancel each other out, and are forever locked in a psychic battle with one another. Until that changes, they're both harmless.   With that list, we can scratch off Orgalorg and the sphinxes, which would give us the following three:   The Lich is more powerful than Finn, but less powerful than the Ice King. Finn is more powerful than the Ice King, but less powerful than Lich. The Ice King is more powerful than the Lich, but less powerful than Finn.   As a leaving note / food for thought: This leaves us with a rock-paper-scissors concept for the three of them. I think it's also interesting to note that one could ascribe a particular moral value to each of the three, further enforcing the ""rock-paper-scissors"" concept:   Finn would necessarily be considered ""Ordered Good,"" Lich would necessarily be considered ""Ordered Evil,"" Ice King would ultimately be considered both ""Chaotic"" and ""Neutral,"" which would in every way act as a contrast between the other two."
adventuretime,3da689,FM4k,6,Tue Jul 14 19:24:19 2015 UTC,"Ice King's crown doesn't have the ability to stop no comet- The crown causes it's master to be like master Evergreen from Cretaceous Gunther's perspective. that was the deepest truest wish of Gunther. I will agree the crown holds an incredible amount of power as seen in the farmworld universe, (assuming that the farmworld crown is identical to the relevant universe's) but I doubt anyone will be able to harness it on purpose.   hold up  I just realized that Cretaceous Gunther knew Evergreen wanted the power to destroy the deadly lich comet, so unless he was a total blockhead and didn't realize this in his deep brain when making the wish- Ice King should in theory have the innate desire, perhaps even ability to destroy a deadly (green) comet."

adventuretime,3da689,FM4k,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:46:56 2015 UTC,She's probably on mars.
adventuretime,3da689,smtktc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:52:30 2015 UTC,"why would she go to mars? i think she will stay in Ooo to prank people like magic man did, or somehow help simon"
adventuretime,3da689,BigDaddy_Delta,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:08:07 2015 UTC,"I was surprised when she discovered the correlation between magic uses and mental illness, because when you think about all the magic users of Ooo have some kind of mental problems"
adventuretime,3da689,mistermartian,5,Fri Jul 17 07:50:39 2015 UTC,"My guess would be Jake.  Jake, in my opinion, has always seemed like he was chaperoning Finn on missions he may have even taken before in his youth. He often predicts the outcome of the adventures before they happen, and tends to be slightly annoyed when things don't go smoothly. He's only seemed shocked by the outcome of anything that's happened on one occassion, and that's when Finn lost his Arm.  Otherwise, he generally lets Finn do his thing and only intervenes when things are slightly out of control.  I would say Ice King, but I'm not sure if I feel like he has control of his powers or if the crown is controlling him. It's weird."
adventuretime,3da689,artisticMink,6,Tue Jul 14 21:22:45 2015 UTC,"Jake is probably correct, whatever he is. The crown is a pretty good bet as well. Then there is Abadeer, of course, but he's not really a inhabitant of ooo.  In the end, i would say enthropy. For some reason, i feel the whole world of Ooo is destinied to die and grow up again. As we often see in the glimpses of future events. (Candy Castle inside modern ruins and stuff like that)."
adventuretime,3da689,mistermartian,2,Tue Jul 14 22:18:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The reason I disagree with answers like Orgalorg or The Lich is because they seem to be less powerful on Ooo then they would be out seeking destruction in the Universe.   I was originally going to say Goliad/Stormo, but they seem to be deadlocked for eternity. Really sad."

Darren  It is implied that anyone defeated by Darren is completely erased from existence, even disappearing from alternate universes. He can shoot a destructive laser from his mouth. He is able to open a portal to an alternate universe, through which he can summon a rain of eggs that hatch into an army of warriors known as ""The Dragon's Teeth"".  Hunson Abadeer Described as ""deathless,"" apparently meaning that he is immortal even going as far to say he literally can't die. He is capable of stealing souls (with the Nightosphere amulet on), shapeshifting, regenerating, and growing to tremendous sizes. He also knows karate. Party God Is literally the god of partying, capable of shooting laser beams out of his mouth, can split himself up into smaller wolves and can enlarge/reduce his size.  Little Dude Who ever he takes over gets the proportional strength of a hat, which is apparently a lot. When he takes the Gumball Guardian he becomes massively overpowered. Tons of potential. King Worm AKA the king of worms. Shoots a hypnosis beam to trap his victims in a dreamscape prison and drain them of their life energy. The only way to break free is to have your deepest fears appear on the dream plane. Scorcher Scorcher can levitate and can conjure fire through his hands and feet.

Then again, her kryptonite is the most common thing on the planet: water. It covers about two-thirds of Earth. Just cast her down a watery prison and bam, she's a threat no more.  Finn has some unexplored psychokinetic (also known as telekinetic) abilities, which could have near-unlimited capabilities. But like I said, it's an unexplored field, so I wouldn't bet my money on him yet.  The Lich. We all know who he is: destroyer of life, and indeed he has the capability of achieving that goal. However, he has been defeated more than once before, whether by luck or otherwise. That would implicate that he's not really as strong as we all think he may be.  The same could be said with Orgalorg/Gunter, who is a demon from before the Big Bang. He too has the capability of ending all life, but he too has been defeated.  I could go on, but these guys are the ones I'm betting on for now."

You don't think either would willingly leave the other behind forever do you?  But I don't think this is the last offer like this they will hear, kind of like how wish magic is the real buzz, but we have already seen like 8 ways to get a wish granted.

A one is like, sober, basically, and 10 is like, the highest you've ever been in your life. Like, so high, you went to start the laundry, but you forgot your car keys so you had to go back to get them, and by the time you realize how freaking stupid that is and go back to do your laundry for reals, you realize that you're not actually holding a laundry basket, but a pizza. You don't even know where this pizza came from.    So, your title is basically saying that your sister got blazed out of her gourd and drew an adventure time picture."

adventuretime,3d9ncu,KevinTheLoner,2,Wed Jul 15 21:16:54 2015 UTC,"Much like Adventure Time, it's a show where personal growth is a huge focus. Steven's mannerisms, self-esteem, and ""wisdom"" have changed pretty drastically since the beginning.  Likewise, Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl (the Crystal Gems) originally appear to be thousand-year-old infallible sages/mothers, but they're comparatively ""young"" in Gem terms, and that begins to show later on in the show.  It's fairly understandable from the get-go, but as you watch, stories from the past unfold to explain exactly why certain characters act the way they do, especially to and around Steven and his family/friends.  Overall, if you're looking for incredible writing, some beautifully teary moments, and a lot of that ""Ooh, Ooh, that's what X meant when she said Y to Z!"" that Adventure Time also (enjoyably) flaunts, Steven Universe is a wonderful show to watch."

If CTR was to ever be remade in this day and age, and not like the ""sequels"" to it, I believe it would topple Mario Kart in quality, especially if they went the Oddworld New & Tasty route.

We do not know what Betty is up to. Magic Man lost his powers, and we don't know what he's doing now.  Perhaps his new prison is shame. There is currently no newer episode that explores Magic Man or Betty's adventures. Dream Gunther is a shade of himself, Gunther, who is also Orgalorg.  Gunther did not consciously remember his desire to steal the comet, but his subconscious desire took place through his dreams.  Subconsciously, Orgalorg/Gunther plotted Princess Bubblegum's downfall so he could steal her spaceship to get to the comet. Sweet Pea is the Lich, born as a child.  While not actively evil, he harbors the Lich inside him.  The Lich is a reincarnation of the Catalyst comet, just like Finn.   Finn is a reincarnation of the Catalyst Comet.  He did not absorb Glob's powers.  Finn has been previously shown to have real powers, like in The Tower.  Whether these powers are caused because he is a true paragon of goodness and virtue, because the grass sword gives him power, or because he is a reincarnation of the Catalyst Comet is currently unclear.    Personally, I believe Finn's powers come from him being a paragon of goodness.  He was shown to have powers before he got the grass sword.  For example, he summoned his horde of astral butterflies when he was paralyzed by the Ice King.  It's very possible he can do these things only because he is the reincarnation of the comet, but it seems more like he can do these things just because of how at peace he is with the universe, like at the end of the recent finale.  I hope this helps!"

adventuretime,3cw2hh,YouJellyFish,4,Sat Jul 11 06:46:28 2015 UTC,"Puhoy is pretty strongly based on THE INNER LIGHT, one of the best episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation if not the best. This is supported by Jonathan Frakes providing the voice for old Finn, as he portrayed Riker in the Star Trek: TNG series. I recommend watching that episode, it's very good. I think the ending sentiment of that episode will help inform your idea of how this episode is supposed to resolve.   Being that the only interaction we see with Golb is Finn jumping off his tongue, and him turning his head, I don't think you should draw the conclusion that Golb ate the pillow world.   My interpretation is that traveling between dimensions like that might require going to some kind of a base dimension before making the lateral move to the Ooo dimension - Golb just happens to be pretty entwined with various realities, so it's on one of the most basic floors."
adventuretime,3cw2hh,qwerqwert,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:48:02 2015 UTC,"golb is like a demiurge that ates realities or existences that he created he's the creator but he also creates worlds like food, so he eats the souls that died in that dimensions and maybe the dimension too that explains why prismo couldn't get back margles she doesn't exist anymore"
adventuretime,3cveyr,andtheAbsurd,3,Sat Jul 11 02:32:35 2015 UTC,"There are 3 existing games for consoles;   Adventure Time: Hey Ice King Why'd You Steal Our Garbage Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Beacause I Don't Know Adventure Time: The Secret of the Nameless Kingdom   The first game is for the ds and 3ds and is probably the best one of the three. The game is essentially a Zelda 2 clone with an Adventure Time skin but it is a actually pretty good game. I spent plenty of hours beating the game and having fun doing it. I recommend playing this game.  The second game is a top down dungeon crawler game in which you go down into Princess Bubblegum's secret underground dungeon and beat up the escaped prisoners on 100 floors while you collect power ups and treasure which you use to upgrade your characters stats. The bad part of the game is that whatever treasure you find, you must spend it all when you come back to surface after every 5 floors before re-entering the dungeon or it will be taken away due to ""candy tax"". Also some of the bosses (which you will encounter every 10 floors) can be quite difficult. The cutscenes in the game are reminiscent of retro games which isn't a bad thing, but worth noting. Overall I would recomend this game if you don't mind spending hours upon on hours collecting treasure to recieve upgrades.  The third game is also a zelda clone but of the much more popular ""A Link to the Past"", I haven't played much of this game because I don't care for the genre but if you are a fan of ALttP then i would definitely recomend this game for you.  The are also a few ios games that I haven't played except from the game ""card wars"". If you enjoy playing card games then this game is perfect for you, but be quick to download it as it is only free for the next few days.  There is also a 3d detective game coming out in October called ""Adventure Time: Finn and Jake Investigations""."

Some notes on which versions to get if you aren't sure:   is the best of them, just avoid the NDS version. It is scaled down from the 3DS and it looks like garbage. is allegedly better on PC and console because it has multiplayer. 3DS suffers from being scaled down from the big screen version and looks way worse than it should. (and lacks that multiplayer) is running on the same engine as #2 but looks and plays better. I need to give that one another shot.   Has anyone played ""Adventure Time: Finn and Jake's Epic Quest""? It was a Unity browser plugin game, but went full Windows Steam release for $10. I didn't know it existed until researching to answer here."
adventuretime,3cveyr,ewzzy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:49:09 2015 UTC,"I've played the 3DS and Android AT games... so like the opposite platforms, but I can still give some guidance. As far as I can tell there aren't any for Mac, but there are some great ones for iOS.  Card Wars - Adventure Time Card Game  A bit sucky with the in-app purchases but a great card game. I just got into the real world card game because of the fun I've had with it.  Ski Safari: Adventure Time  A side scrolling endless runner with a great Tony Hawk style trick score system. It's better than the full console games. Buy the coin doubler early on but don't bother with other in-app purchases.  Time Tangle - Adventure Time  Another endless runner, but this is 3D from behind. It looks like the glitch episode of the show which is neat, but can get repetitive pretty quick.  Adventure Time Appisode - Furniture and Meat  Like Dragon's Lair, but for babies. Don't buy it. It's a barely interactive version of an episode you've already seen.  Jumping Finn Turbo  Based on a flash game, but a really good flash game. Very simple launcher mechanics, but good at what it does. Seek out the browser version first to see if you like it.  Rock Bandits - Adventure Time  A slow platformer that you control via tapping and swiping. I got bored before I got far enough to see if it got good.  Treasure Fetch - Adventure Time  Like the classic Snake game but way way more complicated. I'm sure if you can get used to the controls there's a lot to enjoy, but I never did.  The Rest  These either aren't on Android or I've never tried them if they are: These Lumps - Adventure Time Adventure Time Game Wizard Legends of Ooo - Adventure Time Beemo - Adventure Time"

""Adventure Time: Card Wars is an impeccably designed card-battler with the show’s signature humor generously slathered over it. Don’t be turned off by the energy mechanics — this is one game that makes that minor annoyance worth tolerating.""  ""This game is super fun and addictive.  I was genuinely impressed how well they came up with fun an functioning card game from a few min of a show.  Not sure why so much negativity about the microtransactions though.  Sure, you can buy packs and whatnot, but you don't have to, and it's not necessary.  You can the ability to get packs and whatnot just by playing the game.  I've spent 30+ hours playing with zero micro transactions.""  ""This is a good game except that you need to buy alot of hearts (e.g. costly). Puzzles like Smartball Gravity Games or Glow Puzzle is better that way as they are truly free. I still give it 9 as it beats many repetitive games that quickly become boring.""  ""Card Wars is fantastic up until the free-to-play aspects become apparent, which is a problem in a game that has an up front cost.""  ""The people who gave 0s and 1s are too biased and don't know what a truly horrible game is. Firstly, the gameplay is decent as stated by boingMan (yet he gave it a 1?). It's a fun ""pick up and play a few rounds"" type of game not meant for long sessions. Single player is entirely enjoyable without micro transaction. My pvp experience was also fair. I'd call it an above average game especially coming from an already established franchise where they could have just made no effort. While i do admit micro transactions are the only thing keeping this game form attaining a higher score, but hey what can you do cartoon network gotta get their money back somehow.""  ""A light but fun and well-presented game that struggles under the weight of gratuitous IAPs.""  ""A solid CCG, Card Wars – Adventure Time unfortunately undermines itself with poor implementation of its in-app purchases.""  ""The in app purchases in this game make it absolutely terrible to play. You pay gems for energy, cards, retrying levels, etc. Another potentially great game destroyed by in app purchases. The concept is good and the gameplay entertaining which is why I'm giving it 1.""  ""Card Wars is atrocious. It's a major cash grab. For something you paid 3.99 for it wants you to play through the nose for it. It's dumb, slow and you need to pay to proceed! Don't buy at all. It's a fine show but a horrible game.""  ""Disgusting. Pay-to-play app that charges up front. This is a terrible trend in mobile gaming: half-baked tie-ins to gaming/tv/movie franchises that are simply made to gouge fans. I feel sorry for the devs whose work is ruined by this kind of short-sighted greed.""  Sorry for the wall of text.  TL;DR - seems like the microtransactions are more than just a minor inconvenience in Card Wars. Ah well :/"
adventuretime,3cq2cz,Stofenthe1st,5,Thu Jul 9 23:55:02 2015 UTC,Minor inconvenience is putting it mildly. The only way to get any decent cards is through a bloody roulette chest that can only be opened with gems. Gems which cost money and are also needed to increase your card storage size (you start the game with ONLY 20 slots in freaking TCG!) The only consolation being that there's a few bugs that let you bypass a few of these money drains and the AI is shit so you won't have to restart too many times.

She was sorta coming to terms to the fact that nothing is permanent and everything is in flux... except her. So maybe she'll be OK. Maybe."
adventuretime,3covrk,ThisTemporaryLife,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:17:51 2015 UTC,"Well, she has Princess Bubblegum because she will live for a long time before she dies of natural causes.  After a 1000 years, I think she has reached the point that those close to her that die are the equivalent to when we loose a friend in our normal length lives, its sad but you just have to accept it, and after awhile its not as heart breaking any more.  Since Marceline's body has seemed to age, she may end up die at some point, which means that her and PB will be together for a while if they have similar life spans.  That is if I didn't forget it being stated somewhere that she is in fact immortal."
adventuretime,3covrk,treemasternick,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:45:06 2015 UTC,"Since Marceline's body has seemed to age, she may end up die at some point     Well, probably not. She's been at the age she's at for awhile because, at some point between ""Simon & Marcy"" and present day, she was bitten and became a vampire, thus freezing her at that age. Had she remained unbitten she would most certainly die (or at least age very slowly - she's half-human and half-demon, so perhaps she would have been aging fairly slowly to begin with [Hunson is deathless, it stands to reason she would be half-deathless{?}]) at some point.    BUT WHO KNOWS?! WE NEVER WILL 'CAUSE SHE'S A VAMPIRE AND SHIT, THAT AIN'T CHANGIN' PROBABLY"
adventuretime,3covrk,OmegaEGG,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:49:21 2015 UTC,"I think she may already is a vampire, she has the teeth, but not the bite.  If I am wrong, you would be right."

Root Sword PB's Hairdo plant ""Ruby"" (Emerald from the sand kingdom) Notung, Billy's Sword Marcelline's Axe Bass, Hunson's locket hanging from it. Finn's Flute   Middle:   ""Chicken Soup"" + Swiss Army Knife from Simon and Marcy Ice King's Crown A bottle of magic water (A potion? (???)) Hambo Marcelline has been eating strawberries (Below Hambo) A Prism (???) Enchiridion Flame princess' Candles Billy's Gauntlet Cold Spell Crown (???) Farmworld Finn's Robot Arm Arm is resting on what appears to be a bomb Some kind of mystic Orb (???) Jake's Favourite Cup   In the cup:   Syringe used by Me-Mow? Prismo's Pickle Hot-Dog Princess Hot dog Potion vial (???)   Lower middle:   Some Kind of snail shell (Realistic version of the waving snail???) Apple (Tree Trunks) Egg (BMO's ""Baby"") DEMONIC WITCHING EYE! Ice King's Tapes Some Key (???) Coloured balls (Gumballs???) PB's Googoomamameter (Going Babies) Zergiok's Eye A pendant (???) Royal Tart Demon blood sword Picture of a pig below sword (Mr Pigs? Flooped pig?)   Bottom:   Lolly pop (Random candy stuff ???) Lemon sweets Gumdrops (Gumdrop candy kids)   Probably missed a few things but that was fun  EDIT: Holy shit I just noticed Death hiding in the background on the left middle."
adventuretime,3cl7zu,Karthaz,2,Wed Jul 8 22:28:58 2015 UTC,"Cool, I agree with most of those, but I just wanted to add in some others or what I think some of them may be.   A bottle of magic water (A potion? (???))   I think it's the cyclop's tears that Finn got in ""Another Way."" Never mind, here's a screenshot I took of the tears and it's not the same bottle. Still trying to figure out what it is.   A Prism (???)   I think this may be a reference to Cuber (the guy who tells graybles). You can see them in the title card for ""Graybles 1000+"". He calls it his holo pyramid viewer in the first graybles episode.   Potion vial (???)   I agree with /u/Tomatentom's comment in the other thread that this may be a reference to Princess Bubblegum (thinking of her lab and experiments). Actually, it looks like Me-Mow's antidote, as pointed out by /u/gigem-nikon.   Some Key (???)   The key is from ""Vault of Bones"", the episode when Finn takes Flame Princess to a dungeon. Finn finds the key to the chest they found earlier.   Coloured balls (Gumballs???)   I believe these are gumballs and a reference to Rattleballs.   A pendant (???)   It looks like Princess Bubblegum's pendant in ""The Vault,"" the episode with Shoko (Finn's past life).   Some kind of mystic Orb (???)   This kind of reminded me of the wish orbs from ""The Limit,"" but I'm still looking around.   Picture of a pig below sword (Mr Pigs? Flooped pig?)   I do think it is the pig from Card Wars.   Crown (???)   Still trying to figure this one out.  Lastly, there seems to be another book underneath the Enchiridion. It's pink. I think it might be Ice King's diary. I thought it might also be Lumpy Space Princess's book from ""Gotcha,"" but it looks more like a hardcover book like Ice King's diary (LSP's book is stapled, so I think it's probably not a real book cover)."

adventuretime,3cl7zu,Karthaz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:13:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks, you too. After having looked through the AT wiki, I do think it is Ice King's diary as there aren't any other pink hardcover books. I also think his diary and the Enchiridion are probably the two more important books in the show. The others are kind of just mentioned briefly and don't really add anything to the story."

adventuretime,3cls0k,twerpturd,3,Wed Jul 8 23:40:03 2015 UTC,"""FINALLY WE CAN DIE!"" went over huge when that episode premiered.  in retrospect, I think it was childish to be excited about the ""edgy"" aspects of early AT episodes.  Everybody wanted it to be an adult swim show, but it carved out its own identity.  AT is like Brian Regan or Jim Gaffigan, who dirty comedians are in awe of because it's UNTHINKABLE to them to make people laugh without vulgarity.  Regular Show seems like a show that could be much more direct and honest, not to mention funnier, if it didn't have to be clean.  Adventure Time rarely ""bumps into its limits"" and seems completely natural with the language it uses."

I didn't get all of it and found it fun but pretty weired at times. Today, i 'll just can ask myself what the fuck i watched back then. It's a little similiar with adventure time. Especially the more psychodelic episodes are a different thing to children and teens/adults."

I probably shouldn't admit this, and it probably takes me into the creepy old-guy territory, but I've always been a big fan of animation. And I also blame Craig Ferguson for his continuous enthusiasm for the show when he hosted the Late Late Show."
adventuretime,3cn0ah,YouJellyFish,2,Fri Jul 10 21:57:56 2015 UTC,"I'm 21 now.  I started watching Adventure Time three years ago, and binged watched the whole thing.  I know several children who like the show, but not really to the same level that the people my age seem to.    The kids I know who like the show like it because they think Jake is cute or funny.  When I talk to people my age we're always arguing about which episodes were the best, and what their significance to the plot was.  Both are valid ways of appreciating the show, but I think the age of the people the overall story was written for is around 18 to 20ish."
adventuretime,3cn0ah,Lannisterr,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:06:27 2015 UTC,"Valid point. Everyone relates to different things in the show. Especially at different ages you grow attatched to characterds, themes and individual plot lines between characters."

adventuretime,3cn0ah,hieronymus-wolf,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:13:06 2015 UTC,"16 year old. I was with AT since the beginning, watching S1 when I was 11-12ish. I did fall out of touch with the for a little around the end of S1 to the middle of S2 or show, but other than that I've been following it ever since. The show basically grew up with me. I started having English classes discussing literary devices and more mature themes, which timed perfectly with watching S5-S6. I wasn't too into S6 and was losing touch with the show. I discovered Steven Universe this past spring though, and along with S1-S5 being added to hulu, I decided to re-visit the series as a whole. Thanks to my 9th grade English teacher being amazing, I was able to appreciate S6 and the whole series a lot more, catching a lot more crossover themes. It's probably my favorite show, with FMA:B coming in at a close 2nd (I like big picture stuff)."

But I'm one of the fans that loves the wacky, offbeat episodes. The first season was primarily that type of humor, with just a touch of backstory towards the later episodes.  So I really enjoy episodes like ""Chips and Ice Cream."", ""Card Wars"", and ""Ghost Fly"". They are goofy episodes for a goofy show."

adventuretime,3cgb7z,yellowfellow378,58,Tue Jul 7 18:50:29 2015 UTC,I think they have a bit of time left before it gets stale. It's just going to be much harder competing with last season's finale lol
adventuretime,3cgb7z,Fbulol,58,Tue Jul 7 18:55:04 2015 UTC,"I doubt it, I think last season finale was one of the weaker ones. Usually stuff gets epic but this one was kind of just . . . meh"
adventuretime,3cgb7z,Charlie8090,19,Tue Jul 7 22:05:43 2015 UTC,"I think the finale felt underwhelming because they set it up with a bunch of crazy episodes (Hoots, You Forgot Your Floaties, Orgalorg), not to mention the whole comet plotline. Also, the fandom kinda went crazy with the theories. But I prefer the finale as it was to what people were predicting, with Golb coming back, PB/Jake dying, Finn being an ancient monster..."
adventuretime,3cgb7z,lava_soul,30,Wed Jul 8 03:08:08 2015 UTC,"Eh, IMO, the finale was amazing because it expanded on the series without really changing or adding anything that wasn't already there. I'll take the slow burn over the flashy explosion in this case. Furthermore, the line ""I've put a lot of work into this meat reality, I'd like to see it through,"" was more powerful than anything else they could have done."
adventuretime,3cgb7z,BestNameEver_,3,Wed Jul 8 04:12:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, although it wasn't one of my favorites I definitely prefer it to fan theories. Some of them are just too out there and ridiculous."
adventuretime,3cgb7z,Charlie8090,29,Wed Jul 8 03:38:42 2015 UTC,"I liked the metaphysical angle. My favorite episodes tend to be the ones that make me go ""Huh, I don't know how to feel about that. I will have to think more."" In my opinion epic action does not fit with the show's style."
adventuretime,3cgb7z,Cuofeng,11,Wed Jul 8 03:00:45 2015 UTC,"I don't mean epic action necessarily, I just mean that it was awesome, like the Lich was a great episode and Billy's Bucket List really didn't have any epic action, it was just awesome when you see Billy again after he's been gone for season and he tells Finn that his dad is alive."

adventuretime,3cgb7z,ryegye24,3,Wed Jul 8 00:48:54 2015 UTC,"Quoting something I wrote a couple of days ago since it's relevant and I'm lazy.   I think it's suffered a little from all the hiatuses, to be honest. Season six was actually pretty great, but because it kept going off air, it was kind of tainted. If you watch it all together, it makes a lot more sense and it just seems better. I mean, sure, it had it's fair deal of bad episodes, but every season has had that. And it's a different storytelling style to SU. You can't say the storylines are sub-par or whatever, they just take longer to pay off. The Finnale didn't live up to everybody's expectations, because the fandom was hyping it up to be some enormous, status-quo shattering thing, but the crew never said that was what it was gonna be. We set too high of a bar. But it still changed things. It just happened in a subtle way. People are acting like nothing happened, but if you consider all the episodes that premiered in that week, stuff did change. Betty's gone nuts, the Lich is still chilling as Sweet P, PB is now just B, there's the Golb thing, and the Orgalorg storyline sure as hell isn't done. Personally, I think it was a great way to finish the season, and I think it's great Finn's finally come to terms with all the crap he's gone through."
adventuretime,3cgb7z,martythedrunkunicorn,2,Wed Jul 8 12:00:29 2015 UTC,"This was the first season I really wasn't a fan of. The second half of the season was a bit better, but overall it felt like the show might have already peaked"

adventuretime,3cgb7z,vernes1978,6,Wed Jul 8 07:27:52 2015 UTC,"I've been pretty content with the formula so far, that is, an ""end-game"" scenario, like with the Lich, that spans a couple seasons but is resolved (or maybe, who knows with Sweet Pea), with one-off episodes to break the tension.  I think this can help it from becoming stale, like with Pokemon or Jackie Chan Adventures, or any other show where they're constantly struggling with the same villains every episode and it just sort of goes on.  That said, I do miss the more frequent one-offs that were present on early seasons, Walnuts and Rain is probably my favorite recent episode."

adventuretime,3cgb7z,Owyn_Merrilin,3,Wed Jul 8 05:25:20 2015 UTC,"Considering the beginning of season 7 is an 8 parter (that's 2 hours total, counting commercials, around 90 minutes not. Also where 8 of the 9 episodes missing from the 52 ordered for S6 went)...we're getting our movie. Though I'd love to see a theatrical movie as well."
adventuretime,3cgb7z,CyborgDragon,7,Wed Jul 8 06:18:35 2015 UTC,"There's nothing actually saying at what point in Season 7 Stakes will air. That's just the order in which Wikipedia listed the leaked episode titles. Furthermore, it's a Marceline-focused miniseries that Adam Muto has said will probably not start off the season. I'm too tired to link to all that stuff right now,  but you could easily find the core information with Google.  Also, a threatrical AT film was confirmed months ago. Pen has been focused entirely on it since November."
adventuretime,3cgb7z,AspiringRacecar,2,Wed Jul 8 07:58:30 2015 UTC,"You know, I think I'd be happy if they just gave that 8 parter the kind of budget that went into Over the Garden Wall.

adventuretime,3cgb7z,AspiringRacecar,2,Wed Jul 8 04:59:47 2015 UTC,"but so was those other shows as well.   I mean, driven by the storyboard artists. AT in particular has been noted for the freedom it gives to its storyboard artists. How much do you know about the writing process of those other shows?   season 6 in my opinion was the worst in terms of quality and continuity and energy.   What did you dislike about the continuity?"
adventuretime,3cgb7z,Stinky_WhizzleTeats,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:36:24 2015 UTC,"I know about the way run their their storyboard and I think it's better off then some shows, but some you know you just lose their pizzazz once the main man is gone. It doesn't really work well on the ""surface level"" you know the ""adventure, comedy and silliness"" and plot taken at face value but them you get the deeper layer where instead of a monster it represents something else more complex metaphor like in ""what was missing"" you know silly songs with a deeper meaning of things like Finns feeling of inferiority for example and have real world applications. Season 6 didn't have much of the suface level but extended deeper and deeper trying to be more mysterious and philosophical almost like Ice King's furniture coming to life, I didn't think it was a bad episode but there was nothing on the surface to really attract me towards watching that episode but it feels like I'm forced to look into some deeper meanings behind these newer episodes and it makes not want to enjoy it becuase it won't draw me into the story. Same with the Sweet Pea/pinnochio plot (it shows hes still got the lich but when will thay ever be mentioned again?) and when Finn astrolly projects himself with no meaning until 50 episodes later. I expect better from the Adventure time crew on how to tell a good story and adventure but they introduce plot threads and don't follow up on them for 20 or 30 episodes, I don't find it charming and fun and silly like the previous 5 seasons the episodes now feel so somber and not energetic and creative and imagintive. People don't analyze it becuase it's mature and all that they analyze it based on the face value of the episode and then dig for that deeper meaning. I still love adventure time and I'll still watch it but it's not really the same now, now don't get wrong I don't want to insult or offend or cause down voting but that's my little commentary and opinion. I hope you respect it."
adventuretime,3cgb7z,AspiringRacecar,2,Wed Jul 8 07:06:22 2015 UTC,"I thought most of the episodes were still pretty fun in their own right, but okay. I was never arguing against your opinions.  Telling a long, continuous story all at once isn't really something that the series has ever done, though. I'm still a little confused about why you think S6's continuity has been worse than that of previous seasons."
adventuretime,3cgb7z,cheezballs,-2,Wed Jul 8 07:39:40 2015 UTC,"6 was by far the ""worst"" season. Still better than most other shows,  but when comparing it to other AT seasons it was quite bad."

If he ages in real time season 8 will mean he is 18 by midseason. But I could be wrong. As long as the writing is still spectacular you'll hear no complaining from me."

One shot, rated k, Bubbline, girlfriend angst with a silly ending.  https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10604062/1/National-Holiday  Frozen Hearts: ""When another human is found in Ooo, little does anyone know that it is just the beginning of a series of events that will change everything.

adventuretime,3cm20a,OmegaEGG,2,Thu Jul 9 03:54:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I tried to give a nice diverse list in regards to length and themes. What was really hard was finding stories with a decent length that actually had any closure to them. That's the curse of fanfiction right there, 90% is attrocious and of the 10% very few actually get finished."

SteelDragonDown - They've written a really good AU fanfic, which has Simon and Gunther in the place of Finn and Jake. Things are a little confusing, but Finn was born before the Mushroom War in this AU, found the crown, went through all the stuff our Simon went through with dog kidnapping in the place of princess kidnapping, and Bonnie in the place of Marcy.   Shwoo - They've done a bunch of stuff set in the same AU as SteelDragonDown, based on episodes of the show.  And here's the Adventure Time tag on Archive Of Our Own, sorted by likes. You might have to sift though a bunch of NSFW stuff, but there's plenty of good stories here.  Also, I wrote a short fic myself the other day about Simon and Betty. I'd love it if you gave it a look."

Though, i'm still a little iffy about the fact that there isn't a proper central place for Adventure Time Fanfiction. I'll might try to do something about that during semester break.  I also read ya story. After a somewhat troublesome entry, it turned out to be pretty good. Could see something similiar happening in the show. Only point of critique, at least for me, would be that some things - especially in the beginning - where described multiple times without adding something new to it. Felt a little like it was just there for the sake of 'more text', instead of giving the reader more information."

This one's a very interesting take on Shoko's life. I haven't finished it yet, so don't spoil anything for me. :P  Shoko by SoundGeare: ""This is the story of Shoko.""  Rated: Fiction T - English - Adventure/Tragedy - [OC, Shoko] Princess B. Bubblegum - Chapters: 72 - Words: 73,043  Don't like Bubblegum and see her as a bad person? This one's for you. Fret not, I like Bubblegum. I think she is an interesting character. I just like this rendition of an evil Bubblegum.  Scorched Ooo by FieryCrusader: ""Bubblegum's actions from ""The Cooler"" have infuriated the Fire Princess for the last time. Lives were unfortunately lost after the last incident and now both of their civilizations are on the brink of war. Will the fate of Ooo survive this impending conflict?""  Rated: Fiction T - English - Tragedy/Hurt/Comfort - Finn, Princess B.

I don't have many words to say about this one, so I'll just leave it to the summary.  Fall by Writingsterner: ""Almost 3 years after the Red Throne, Eastern Ooo, now stable, is recovering from a relatively large war, . But a coup in the land of fire could put an end to that. No one is safe in Fire Kingdom, ever since their ruler had been arrested by the conspirators. Now thugs roam the streets, and the new king is moving rapidly to remilitarize.

Bubblegum, Flame Princess, Earl of Lemongrab - Chapters: 5 - Words: 9,738  If you are a FinnxPhoebe fan such as myself, check this out. Having been up to date to the story, I'd say it's definitely a fun read.  The Citadel of Truth by Ooobserver: ""Now 17, Finn the Human has become a mature hero of Ooo. However, repressed feelings for Flame Princess are desperately trying to tear him apart, and the fiery girl knows his pain. As an ancient evil rises to consume all existence, a final chance will present itself to Finn and his friends to not only stop the madness but finally unite a couple struggling for each other's love.""  Rated: Fiction T - English - Adventure/Romance - Finn, Flame Princess - Chapters: 76 - Words: 464,161  If you want to see a Farmworld Universe fanfiction, I suggest you read this.

The wonderfully creepy 'It Follows' soundtrack is done by Disasterpeace who as well as composing epic chiptuney music for many awesome video games has soundtracked an episode of Adventure Time (not sure if it's aired yet or not....).  And we're back! :-)
adventuretime,3cah5q,worshiptribute,2,Mon Jul 6 23:38:38 2015 UTC,Oh wow! :o I did not know that at all! I'm going to watch the film soon. xD
adventuretime,3cah5q,FelipeFS,5,Tue Jul 7 00:00:40 2015 UTC,It's so disturbing because of its mystery and originality. One of the best horror films of the decade imo
adventuretime,3cah5q,royalflashmartian,3,Mon Jul 6 15:55:42 2015 UTC,I'll definitely give it a watch! :D
adventuretime,3cah5q,machineoperator,7,Mon Jul 6 15:58:15 2015 UTC,That's a great Fionna hat!  Did you make it?  The only one I was ever able to find had ears so heavy it wouldn't stay on the top of my head.  You look so adorable!
adventuretime,3cah5q,captainhindsite5752,10,Mon Jul 6 15:01:32 2015 UTC,"I thought the ears were a little short to be a fionna hat.   Edit for whoever downvoted me, I was only making an observation, not criticizing the OP in any way :)"
adventuretime,3cah5q,khkarma,4,Mon Jul 6 16:47:09 2015 UTC,The ears are flopping in these photos. In some of the other pics on my Facebook page you can see them standing up. :)

adventuretime,3cgtuk,nutshack,3,Tue Jul 7 20:18:25 2015 UTC,It's off-season and they're driving newer shows. All of the episodes from this season on On-Demand if you have comcast/xfinity and I know CN is working out various deals to get more episodes on NETFLIX.
adventuretime,3cgtuk,mistermartian,2,Tue Jul 7 20:42:35 2015 UTC,hulu has 5 seasons and I don't see it on netflix anymore so idk if netflix is getting any more.
adventuretime,3cgtuk,tripbin,2,Wed Jul 8 07:25:16 2015 UTC,They've been removed from Netflix before. They removed Courage and PPG (which both only had one or two seasons) and added them back with all seasons a few month's later.
adventuretime,3cgtuk,mistermartian,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:15:04 2015 UTC,They also added a lot of season 6 episodes recently.

adventuretime,3cgtuk,mistermartian,2,Tue Jul 7 20:44:41 2015 UTC,"Teen Titans' revamp is, if I remember correctly, a wildly successful test run for a revamp style for a few shows, including the Powerpuff Girls and if rumors are true, Courage the Cowardly Dog. I think there are a couple of originals coming next year as well."
adventuretime,3cgtuk,mikeman1090,2,Tue Jul 7 21:23:57 2015 UTC,Fuck yes if this is true. Courage the Cowardly Dog is awesome. Just hope they don't go full cgi like they did with the newest episode

There was nothing saying that the Finn comet was from after Evergreen, so quite a few people assumed that he crashed on Earth, became a butterfly, then that weird goop stuff, then Gunther, then onto Shoko."

The Reddit post links to my Flickr (where you can download them at various sizes); since I submitted two separate designs, I didn't want to double-post with a link to each entry on Reddit. So, here are the actual Shirt.Woot links to the specific derby pages -- where you can bestow votes upon them, if you so desire! After all: Votes = Potential to Print!  ""Get Down on that Fizzy Grape"": A mash-up between ""Super Porp"" and the 1950s Pepsi Soda logo; graffiti-style.  ""Wizards Only, Fools!: A mash-up between Ice King, Gunter & Crew, and the Dairy Queen logo; cartoon-style.  You do need a Woot account with at least one purchase in order to vote; however, the Shirt.Woot catalog has a plethora of great designs (and a few Adventure Time parody t-shirts), so you may find something you like (if you haven't already). -:) Either way, regardless of whether you vote, I just thought that this subreddit -- more than any other -- would appreciate and get a giggle out of my work. -:D  Glob be with you!"

adventuretime,3c8drd,martythedrunkunicorn,3,Sun Jul 5 22:09:11 2015 UTC,"Same here. I've tried getting a couple of my best friends into it, but they're both hardcore anime purists and basically refuse to watch any western cartoons at all. I've tried explaining how deep the show gets and how well-written it is and everything, but they don't believe me."
adventuretime,3c8drd,AdventureFalls618,3,Mon Jul 6 04:37:29 2015 UTC,"I know those feels, I have a bunch of Otaku friends but I personally prefer western cartoons.

I've seen every episode at least twice, regularly post on /r/adventuretheory and am always thinking about the characters, dialogue, the universe of Ooo... Unfortunately as a 28 year old man, everyone I know either thinks its a dumb kids cartoon or one of those 'pot smoker shows'.  I ordered a demon blood sword replica from Etsy,when it arrived my roommate gave me a 'how old are you, twelve?' look.  Maybe I am wack and have poo brain to still be into AT as someone who's on the far end of their 20's... but I choose to believe it's the world that's wack. thank goodness for the subreddit."
adventuretime,3c8drd,LordMegatron586,2,Mon Jul 6 03:59:17 2015 UTC,"I'm a 26 year old woman and cartoons are still some of my favorite things to watch. Like I said to some one else on here I can get why people think this is a stoner show, it's so random and out there sometimes, but I don't smoke and I get it just fine. I think there's a subtlety to a show that most people don't get because they're used to cartoons being so straight forward and basically just laying everything out for them."
adventuretime,3c8drd,LordMegatron586,2,Mon Jul 6 14:35:36 2015 UTC,I have no friends around me who like Adventure Time. They mostly just watch Steven Universe or something like that; they claim AT is too confusing for them.

I would get depressed if this show didn't exist.  I usually don't care if someone dislike this show. But it does really pisses me off when someone thinks that this is a pot smoker show. I  would seriously end the friendship with anyone who think that a person need drugs to able create this show like this. That's like the easiest way for anyone to lose a friendship from me. That's just insulting, it just makes me feel disgusted."

I guess it's hard for some people to follow because it bounces around so much and can be kind of random but I have no trouble getting it. It's subtle, and not a lot of people can get subtle stuff, they want things laid out for them and they want it to be simple. This show doesn't do that, if you don't pay attention you miss a lot of the context that makes it great."
adventuretime,3c8drd,Corben11,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:19:55 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of things that are hard to notice unless you pause it to look for things, or watch with headphones to listen carefully.  I usually hear crickets chirping when the episode takes place at night when I watch with headphones. At the end of episode of The Lich, you can hear cows mooing, even though you don't really see any cows. In sunny episodes, you can hear the birds chirping. In some episodes, you can hear the sound of the wind. It just feels real. The episode that takes place at night feels like night in real life. You won't be able hear these kinds of stuff when you don't watch with headphones. That probably because I don't really hear things very well unless I watch with headphones.  The snails are really hard to spot until you watch a episode  multiple times. In the episode ""Is That You?"", I feel like I'm the only person that noticed that there's a Enchildiron book next to the globe thing in Finn's bedroom."

adventuretime,3c66vc,micolodeon,4,Sun Jul 5 05:17:49 2015 UTC,"As far as Lovecraft canon goes, Orgalorg is more of a Nyarlathotep-type figure. Shoggoths are- for lack of a better word- pretty dim. They don't really have the wherewithal to be conquering worlds, and they're also way more formless than Orgalorg is, in that they're basically like giant amoebas, while Orgalorg seems to be more of an octopus-thing. Strange, certainly, but not the chaotic amorphous blob of eyes and mouths that we've all come know and love as Shoggoths.  Nyarlathotep, on the other hand, is a much closer match. He's an outer god who, unlike most outer gods, actually goes around conquering shit. More importantly, he's also a shape-changer who hides his true, abominable form with a harmless-seeming (yet charismatic) mortal disguise.   Now, Orgalorg certainly seems more independent than Nyarlothotep, but we don't have to get into the whole Azathoth thing for the sake of this metaphor."

Plus I like thinking of nicknames for her.  P-Bizzle, P-Bimmagio, P-Bomb, Pibsgibs, Pobsgobs, Pubsgubs, PB&G, Pleebs)  Least fave depends on a lot of things.  There are a lot of characters with one or two appearances who I don't like, such as Ricardio and the Nut royal family.  But in terms of repeating characters, I'd have to say I don't really dislike any of them.  I love to hate them.  They all have unique charms.  But I guess it isn't really dislike as much as liking them less than the rest, so I'd probably say Abracadaniel.  Not that I don't enjoy some of his moments, I'd just say that a lot of the time he misses the mark."

adventuretime,3byels,pollypod,18,Fri Jul 3 04:48:06 2015 UTC,"I sincerely hope you at least consider it, while true it may be annoying having a sub private, this is something Reddit should work together to stop."
adventuretime,3byels,Sparky-Sparky,4,Fri Jul 3 04:58:01 2015 UTC,I can respect your decision. Frankly Fan-base subs such as /r/adventuretime are one of the only reasons I have staying here and I don't care to loose them to stupid corporate moves.
adventuretime,3byels,mamueller,39,Fri Jul 3 14:01:50 2015 UTC,Fuck this. Reddit admins have been absolutely abusing their power for quite some time. If you don't recognize this your blind. /r/adventure time should go private to let reddit know that this is all bull.
adventuretime,3byels,alexshatberg,19,Fri Jul 3 04:48:39 2015 UTC,"One of the big issues with this whole thing is the way admins are treating moderators. We as a sub have worked and communicated with an admin in the past and I, personally, have communicated with multiple. All experiences myself, or the mod team have had as a whole have been pleasant and helpful. I understand this can't be said by a lot of other more popular subs, but since we as mods are not currently involved in the issue, we are going to try and keep out of this situation the best we can.  I know I'm probably going to get flack for this but unless something changes, I don't think we will go private at all.  And please, don't take this as us not being sympathetic to the rest of the mods that have had unpleasant experiences with the admins. This whole situation really does suck."
adventuretime,3byels,BagelBurner,14,Fri Jul 3 07:07:28 2015 UTC,"Yoshi, I feel like the main reason you, the mods, are getting flack is because you didn't put this up to the community vote. A handful of other niche subs did so and the general opinion was usually ""nah"". I don't think /r/adventuretime should blackout either, but asking the community before making the decision seems to have become the default course of action."
adventuretime,3byels,jercshore,7,Fri Jul 3 12:42:04 2015 UTC,"It all happened so fast, it was late, we didn't find out what was going on until like 2 hours after it had happened, there were several reasons we didn't put it up to a communal vote."
adventuretime,3byels,pollypod,6,Fri Jul 3 19:31:33 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Why isolate so many others from their daily source of news, discussion, and amusement when they did nothing wrong? We would be hurting more users and the community as a whole. It was irresponsible for the admins to do this, yes, but surely there is a less extreme and more vocal way to express our thoughts. We don't even know why she was fired. It could be over something trivial or a completely reasonable course of action."
adventuretime,3byels,KnotKnox,5,Fri Jul 3 08:36:24 2015 UTC,"I still don't understand how the admins are being dickish? I've read the whole post thing, but I'm still lost as to what exactly they've done wrong outside of the firing a key player without notice."
adventuretime,3byels,Superdudd,7,Fri Jul 3 04:55:13 2015 UTC,"It's that fired her in a way that really fucked over Iama, plus really fucking over any and all subreddits that include AMAs. Not only that people have been pissed at the admins for a while now."
adventuretime,3byels,mamueller,-18,Fri Jul 3 04:56:54 2015 UTC,"I still don't understand how the admins are being dickish?   It stretches back years, this was the straw that broke the camel's back. For years mods have been asking for better bare bones mod tools (Most mods of large subs use third party extensions) and better communication before they decide to throw everything out of whack. After years of getting told ""We're getting to it, promise."" they got fed up."
adventuretime,3byels,KnotKnox,2,Fri Jul 3 05:14:58 2015 UTC,Is this why you asked Ellen Pao directly about bringing r/pics back?
adventuretime,3byels,mamueller,5,Fri Jul 3 13:37:51 2015 UTC,"And that's just the tip of the iceberg. The banning of multiple subreddits just a few weeks ago, despite your opinions of them, was uncalled for. Ellen Pao has an incredibly shady past which posts on reddit have been actively deleted. It's just a shit storm. Admins need to let reddit be organic. Users will decide which content is appropriate/acceptable. Admins don't need to be interfering with this."
adventuretime,3byels,KnotKnox,-10,Fri Jul 3 05:23:51 2015 UTC,"1.) Those subreddits were banned for repeated harassment. I've myself seen the PMs /r/fatpeoplehate and /r/transfags sent to people telling them to kill themselves. I personally reported the comments where /r/FatPeopleHate mocked someone's /r/SuicideWatch thread and told them to kill themselves. Various subreddits are still around because despite being shitty, they aren't harassing people.  2.) Mods routinely decide on a single submission to allow so their frontpage isn't filled with duplicates. The admins don't remove things unless it goes against site wide rules (child porn, doxxing, copyright violations, etc). The loonies who tell you they are censoring posts have been saying so long before Ellen was around.  3.) Other than people using it spread their uninformed agenda, this has nothing to do with Ellen Pao. This was a result tense mod-admin relations."
adventuretime,3byels,KnotKnox,2,Fri Jul 3 05:41:17 2015 UTC,"1) While very possibly true (and I don't doubt it considering the people who frequented FPH), the sub never once organized a brigade on other users. Individuals acted on their own volition and they should be banned/shadowbanned. The sub as a whole should not. It was a corral for people who shared the same ideas. Just like coontown, srs, etc.   2) As a quick example mods of /r/news were removing all topics on the TPP until just earlier this week when the fast track was approved. And honestly I couldn't give a rats ass what mods do to their own subs. Thats their choice. Just Using this as a reason that users are upset.   3) This has a lot to do with Pao. Tonight's specific incident? No obviously not. But her as CEO was quite a heavy load on the camels back.   I'm not trying to be a dick (I'm quite drunk in fact), and I don't even quite understand why we're arguing since we seem to share the same idea about all of this, but I just wanted to present my thoughts on your counters."
adventuretime,3byels,JohnFuckingMarston,-23,Fri Jul 3 05:50:00 2015 UTC,"Check out /r/hangryhangryfphater for FAR more evidence of FPH brigading and harassment than what I've just linked below      FPH would often post pictures of random people they saw in public to shame them. Or they would cross post something from a sub like /r/skincareaddiction or /r/makeupaddiction and then harass the OP based on their looks. Or the one time a woman posted in /r/sewing about a dress she made and that got harassment. Or when a couple met over GTA5 and that got cross-posted.      Alright, let's start linking actual examples of harassment and chronic toxicity that FPH has done.    Thread 1: An open letter to all the fat fats who may be lurking here...    Thread 2: Drama in /r/progresspics when OP's pictures get crossposted to /r/fatpeoplehate.     Thread 3: /r/fatpeoplehate is mentioned in a video by youtuber Boogie2988. Brigade happens on a comment he made in the the sub yesterday about his face.    Thread 4: Big girl on r/unexpected is compared to a planet. Comments are apparently gatecrashed by redditors from r/fatpeoplehate .    Thread 5: Redditor from /r/sewing posts pictures of herself wearing her new dress. Someone cross-posted those pictures to FPH and a drama wave happen.    Thread 6: This is a thread where a FPH user celebrates his co-worker's death    7: /r/fitshionvsfatshion: an entire sub dedicated to bullying how fat people dress and showing how it ""should be done""    Thread 8: Here's a post where a FPH user posts a dead woman's photos to mock them    9: Here's a sub they made to make fun of fat people at weddings    10: Two users met over GTAV, one of them was fat! This led to /r/FPH brigading the sub.    Thread 11: FPH brigades /r/suicidewatch and tells a suicidal redditor to kill himself.    IAmAN00bie did an excellent compilation on some of their brigading. Again first hand experience, I also personally witness them organizing brigades from IRC onto Twitch streams.  1) The mods did not care and even supported it at times. It was not ""a few bad apples"" it was the entire subreddit.  2) They don't allow politics. Why they define certain things and politics and not others only they know, but it's not some Illuminati conspiracy by General Pao like angry redditors would have you believe.  3) Again, other than people using it to spread their anti-Pao gibberish, this has nothing to do with Pao.  I don't mean to be condescending, but everything you're saying is second hand information of second hand information. People who don't understand reddit moderation or reddit behind the scenes tell other users who don't understand reddit moderation or reddit behind the scenes what to believe. It's an endless chain of misinformation.  What you don't see are the random people getting harassed because the anti-Pao witch hunt has deemed them the newest target. You don't see how neo-nazis and similar ilk are always the first ones to start posting anti-Pao stuff to try and incite further witch hunting. You don't see the mod mail people get from the ""benevolent"" witch hunt. You don't see the mods deleting their posting histories because they're afraid of being doxxed. You don't see the neo-nazis using reddit to recruit young and impressionable teens. You didn't see literal hundreds of people posting comments harassing a teen who had just gotten surgery for cancer. You didn't see what we had to do so she wouldn't read the comments and see ""You should have died fucking fatty"".  Reddit is a terrible source of information, half the people on this site will believe the sky is red if it gets upvoted enough. A lot of people work hard so you don't have to face the disgusting realities that spawn from the misinformation you're spreading."

adventuretime,3byels,KnotKnox,15,Fri Jul 3 06:48:14 2015 UTC,"For those going private, its more of a boycott protest. Revenue can't be generated from a sub if there is no traffic.

This is the idea behind those who switch to private."

adventuretime,3byels,TheNaussica,11,Fri Jul 3 17:27:04 2015 UTC,"We did consider it. We discussed it for over an hour. Our reasoning is that in our experience, our relationships with admins had been pleasant. I know for a fact that cannot be said for every sub. But until more information is given to us, namely why Victoria was let go, we wish to stay out of it. We are sympathetic to what has happened. We just feel like we have insufficient data to take action against the admins.   We are a relatively small subreddit when looked at the major ones affected. Thus they have more interactions, or in this case lack of interaction, with the admins regarding AMAs and other admin duties. We at /r/adventuretime have had little interaction with the admins thus we cannot say we are against them. In addition, all the information is new to us and the truth has yet to be made public.

That being said, I don't think that season 6 has been that lacking with adventures. Adventures aren't just physical, like through a dungeon. They can be mental, emotional, spiritual as well.

adventuretime,3bxdmm,LordMegatron586,13,Thu Jul 2 22:57:44 2015 UTC,"Tree trunks will be vital to the eventual inner confrontation between the conciousness known as sweet pea, and the lich."
adventuretime,3bxdmm,uddictiun,29,Fri Jul 3 03:18:00 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of on board on this. There are a lot of really (probably intentionally) unlikable characters or moments when good characters are annoying (and luckily enough great ones to balance it out) in the show, but Tree Trunks is pretty high on the list of characters who have yet to be likable for me personally."
adventuretime,3bxdmm,zuxtron,14,Thu Jul 2 23:26:28 2015 UTC,"I'm one of those weirdos who like Tree Trunks.  Dreams of Love has one of the best songs in AT, and Apple Wedding is top 10 episode material."
adventuretime,3bxdmm,Pkacua,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:14:04 2015 UTC,"Apple wedding was good because of everything else going on. Tree trunks just makes me uncomfortable, I guess. She feels like a novelty which is highlighted by the fully formed characters around her. But of course that shouldn't dim your love for her, more power to you."
adventuretime,3bxdmm,NuclearOops,12,Fri Jul 3 11:19:36 2015 UTC,"I totally understand peoples disdain for T.T.. There's this disconnect between how she acts, how everyone treats her, and the characteristics she is supposed to embody.  But I love it. Who says a sweet old lady can't be completely self-possessed and histrionic? Who says she can't be shallow and flakey? People don't like Tree Trunks because they want Tree Trunks to be a sweet doddering old elephant instead of a selfish woman who goes through men and craves attention. The fact that everyone else acts like she is the former just bothers people more.  But how many people do you know like that? Because people who actually act like T.T. keep up their acts very well. It takes getting to know someone to start to truly develop disdain for them. How well does everyone know her. After the Apple episode Finn and Jake treat her with more caution and distance. They drop the Lich in get doorstep because they figure her ego and doting will at least make sure he's raised to be loved, hopefully that will keep him from becoming the Lich again. Hopefully.  But more to the point people don't line Tree Trunks because they want Tree Trunks to behave like a sweet old lady abd age doesn't. She doesn't fit your mold. She doesn't fit any role. She's her own elephant for good or for ill and she'll always continue to be Tree Trunks whether you like it or not."

adventuretime,3bujeb,icorrectpettydetails,11,Thu Jul 2 19:58:28 2015 UTC,"Here's my two cents on this. Fiona is actually set to be older than finn. The entire gender swapped universe is merely fan fiction made by the ice king, but the ice king is no pedophile, even for bubblegum. Within 20 seconds of her being turned 13, the ice king said ""well, I'm out"". And the ice king made Fiona out to be his perfect mate. So it's doubtful that she'd be as young as finn."
adventuretime,3bujeb,Apollyon42,2,Fri Jul 3 03:23:14 2015 UTC,"That is... Very possible.  I remember that episode, liked that part so much (don't really know why) I can't hate the Ice king after that."
adventuretime,3bujeb,MrNathanman,2,Sat Jul 4 04:45:24 2015 UTC,Yeah. He's an alright dude. I have this feeling that after they separate Simon from the crown there'll still be a little bit of ice king that will come through every now and then.
adventuretime,3bujeb,CouldaBeenWorse,3,Sat Jul 4 05:09:11 2015 UTC,I completely agree. It kinda bothers me.
adventuretime,3bujeb,Takkuu,3,Thu Jul 2 14:51:12 2015 UTC,"It looks more obvious because the art style has so little detail, but from the beginning, Fionna was (based on average) three to five years into puberty. Finn's only indicator was his voice change and being taller, but that fits.  The point is sort of moot though. The entire situation is an Ice King fantasy."
adventuretime,3bujeb,ranranbolly,6,Thu Jul 2 15:39:48 2015 UTC,"All the gender-swapped characters are part of Ice King's fanfic.  To me, it would make sense for them not to be exactly like their Land of Ooo counterparts.  Instead, they would be constructed in a way that reflects how Ice King views all the characters."
adventuretime,3bujeb,martythedrunkunicorn,3,Thu Jul 2 16:15:11 2015 UTC,"Prince Bubblegum seems to be more delicate.  And Ice Queen...wasn't she originally a nymph or something? Not even a female version of Simon? I read that somewhere, and I can't quite recall the source, so for all I know it's just a fan concept."
adventuretime,3bujeb,JoshuMertens,4,Thu Jul 2 14:02:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's in the comics. Ice Queen started out as a Water Nymph (think those water girls from Thanks For The Crabapples, Guiseppe), but she got sick, or hurt, or something, and Cake, who was raised by her, went and found a magic gem, made it into a tiara for IQ, and it healed her, but also drove her nuts."
adventuretime,3bujeb,puzzlednerd,3,Thu Jul 2 16:59:49 2015 UTC,"So its an alternate universe, and the history of Alternate Ooo varies differently"
adventuretime,3bujeb,SwampinBlazes_,3,Fri Jul 3 10:57:53 2015 UTC,"I've always felt like Jake and Cake were just absolutely nothing alike personality-wise.  In fact, Cake annoys me."
adventuretime,3bujeb,vaughnerich,4,Fri Jul 3 15:36:39 2015 UTC,"Girls generally start puberty earlier than boys. Anyway, what do you expect finn to look like at 16/17?"
adventuretime,3bujeb,Lifelikeahobo,7,Thu Jul 2 11:37:23 2015 UTC,"Well, uh, Finn is 16 now- he said so in the comet! Part of me thinks that, well, Fiona is intentionally sexier. That said, they don't necessarily have to be the same age- ice queen looks far younger than Simon!"

adventuretime,3bg9e2,Ubel,2,Mon Jun 29 21:29:38 2015 UTC,My boyfriend got one last year and it's a normal sized mouse pad. Never had any problems with its size.

adventuretime,3bg9e2,newtype06,2,Mon Jun 29 13:41:34 2015 UTC,"Which would be a gaming mouse pad.  I had an ArtCow pad for years back around 2006 and it was the absolute ""standard"" size that mouse pads have been since mice have existed, basically.  A very perfect 1990s sized mouse pad, that $1 mouse pad basically fits that description. Same exact size, had rounded corners and the same decently thick kinda plushy construction.   It's weird but when I think of mouse pads from back in the day, those Art Cow ones are exactly what I think of, because pretty much all mouse pads for years were that same exact size/thickness/shape/quality.  Compared to my much thinner and larger SteelSeries pad, not the same quality, but for $1 I was very impressed and honestly still impressed and surprised they are running this deal.  I literally got one from them around 2006 and at the time thought ""this deal isn't gonna last"" lol ...  I also figured it would be an extremely cheap mouse pad, but the one I got from them at the time was just as good quality as something you'd pay $10-15 for in a local store. Lasted me probably three years of serious daily use.  Even though I have my SteelSeries now, I will likely get another ArtCow one.  It would be amazing though if they let you pay like $3 for a large size, I can't imagine it would cost them that much more to make, so they'd be making more profit (or less of a loss, not sure if they sell these as a pure incentive or not.)"

In that the writers and actors all say it's true, and write like it is, but the network doesn't let it be overt like, at all.  They get a little more overt in the comics, but not much.

No word from any of the writers about their relationship.  For the record I'm bisexual and I would love for them to be canon, I just don't think we can call it ""confirmed"" yet."

I heard that the show has too much fanservice lately and they added this storyline in because Tumblr and the like shipped them together. I am very confused about the whole thing.

adventuretime,3b7gov,decamonos,4,Sat Jun 27 03:07:31 2015 UTC,Wanna talk about it?
adventuretime,3bbrl9,IcedAmerican,35,Sat Jun 27 18:31:36 2015 UTC,"The show does not have AN antagonist. It has a hero. That hero is faced with many difficulties. Ice King is a major antagonist, as well as a sympathetic character. The Lich is the most dangerous.  The show is more about what life is than it is about a conflict with a single antagonist.  It might be easier to pinpoint the major struggle than the main antagonist. The struggle in the show seems to be to find what good means. That takes many forms. Finn struggles with what it means to be a hero and a good person to other people. PB struggles with what it means to be a good and fair leader. Ice King has immortality at a price, and his struggle is with the price he paid for survival, which is commonly held to be a positive thing."
adventuretime,3bbrl9,CouldaBeenWorse,11,Sat Jun 27 19:01:12 2015 UTC,"So I'll go through the candidates you gave:  Lich - Dangerous, cosmic enemy.  Not easily defeatable, almost every time it has been through a fluke and luck.  At least for now though, he is disposed of.  Probably #1 in his prime.  Ice King/Ice King's Crown - Lots of potential but also a lot of issues.  Limited power, can't be used without water nearby, but also can't be used in intense heat.  Then the Ice King himself doesn't seem to be able to apply it well, among other issues.  Definitely not a huge villain or else he's be caught pretty easily.  Pretty near bottom of the list.  Gunther/Orgalorg - Cosmic level villain, but nowhere near powerful enough to do much damage.  Almost always constrained to Earth, and seemingly relatively easily defeatable by Finn.  Granted he has potential, we'd need to see more of him to make a final call.  Princess Bubblegum - Not what I'd call an antagonist.  I think the last episode shows she really was doing what she was doing for the love of her people and not to stay in power, since she ultimately ended up surrendering that power (granted she was pretty annoyed).  She has nice goals and goes about it badly.  Also never against Finn, which I think is necessary for her to be an antagonist rather than just a villain.  Hunson Abadeer - Possibly Global level villain?  He never seems to really work at full strength, or maybe he is and just isn't that powerful?  I don't know.  He's definitely evil, but he seems too bleh to care about doing anything.  Old Age/Growing Up - Maturity (combining these) - Definitely an antagonist, and something that has definitely shown its face now and then.  I wouldn't consider it the biggest antagonist, but they are definitely something in the background.  Peppermint Butler - He's...weird.  He never seems to really have evil intentions.  He can be a dick at times (see: Nemesis), but more often he seems to just be using dark magic to kinda piss around.  Death (character) - Not really an antagonist.  He has a job, he does it.  Never does he seem to go out of his way to do anything evil.  Just kinda does what needs to be done.  Death (concept) - Eh.  Only rarely discussed on the show, wouldn't consider it a primary force of it.  Finn's Dad - Nope.  He's a douche, but he does everything for himself, never against anyone else in specific.  His constantly moving nature makes it so this means that he isn't really against anyone for long enough to be considered an antagonist.  Barely long enough for most people to remember him.  Responsibility - Honestly Finn doesn't have enough responsibility for this to be a driving force in the show, let alone a primary antagonist.  It's brought up now and then (See: Jermaine), but not really enough for it to be a primary contender.  Flame Princess: Not an antagonist, just kind of her own person doing her own thing.  Usually that's a good thing (preventing the fire kingdom from invading the candy kingdom for instance).  She used to be kinda evil, but that was more from...misunderstanding, I guess?  She seems pretty chill by now (heh).  Magic Man - I could go on for pages about Magic Man. I'll keep it short.  He's like the ultimate dickhead.  He probably could destroy the world if he wants to, but that isn't fun.  He lost his powers though, so he's probably demoted.  Fear (gut grinder) - Brought up three times...defeated pretty quickly.  Not a primary contender.  Even the concept is usually only brought up with him.  Lemongrab - Dick, but he really is like Kim Jong Un.  He keeps to his own kingdom, and really doesn't do much against anyone else in recent history at least.  So I don't think we can pinpoint a specific antagonist.  The most powerful or dangerous?  Probably the Lich.  But the show isn't a single story, so it won't have a single antagonist."
adventuretime,3bbrl9,alexxerth,2,Sun Jun 28 02:16:29 2015 UTC,"Magic Man  He lost his powers though, so he's probably demoted.   What about Betty/Magic Ma'am?"

adventuretime,3b79b0,Waddles77,21,Fri Jun 26 15:18:34 2015 UTC,What started the talk of them being together? Cause I've never even felt like there was a possibility of it.
adventuretime,3b79b0,TheSpaceMuffin,14,Fri Jun 26 18:52:52 2015 UTC,"The cartoon kicked it off with Marceline's song ""I'm just your problem"" in the episode ""What Was Missing"". It seemed to hint that their past relationship might have been more serious than just friends. Other than that instance the cartoon hasn't really chased it any further.     The comics however love to imply romantic feelings between them. There are bits and pieces here and there through the main comics and mini-series. But there are two examples that stand out.  In one story arc which jumps further and further into the future PB and Marceline rule as Queen and Queen of the combined Candy-Vampire Kingdom, similar to how a married sovereign couple would rule.  http://i.imgur.com/0EzR0RH.png  http://i.imgur.com/XB0Godo.png     The second is in the latest comic mini-series ""Marceline Gone Adrift"". The series has flashbacks to their friendship while PB was building the Candy Kingdom. Then in the final issue the writers kind of took it a step further with a tender moment between them when facing possible death.  http://imgur.com/a/PAH90  So in the cartoon it is an easily enough dismissed theory. But several of the comic writers seem to be into the idea of a PB and Marceline romance. Maybe it'll happen in the show, who knows."
adventuretime,3b79b0,Mr_Beef_,21,Fri Jun 26 23:36:16 2015 UTC,"One of their voice actors (I forget which one) said that they were ""totally together"" during an interview, which the writers immediately NOPE'd all over, but the fanbase got on it pretty quick.  Also, the episode ""What Was Missing"" reveals that Princess Bubblegum's most precious item is a shirt that Marceline gave to her that she wears as Pajamas."
adventuretime,3b79b0,Urytion,13,Fri Jun 26 18:58:43 2015 UTC,Oh okay. I knew about the T-shirt and that seems like a huge stretch
adventuretime,3b79b0,TheSpaceMuffin,7,Fri Jun 26 19:48:10 2015 UTC,Well there's also the episode where bubblegum trades the shirt to a witch for hambo and the which remarks that the shirt has an incredible amount of sentimental affection.

However, some form of official confirmation wouldn't hurt."
adventuretime,3b79b0,Bluxen,4,Sat Jun 27 00:44:53 2015 UTC,If I remember correctly one of the writers specified they can't make it canon because the show airs to kids around the globe where it's still unacceptable in many other countries.

Lemonhope sort of reset things in that we returned to there being just one lonely old Lemongrab and Finn's relationship with PB seemed to have improved.

After a few episodes this character very abruptly dies at the end of the episode, the closing credits song switches from a light pop song to symphonic metal, and the show from that point on becomes a dark and depressing genre deconstruction along the lines of Watchmen or Evangelion."

adventuretime,3b7bhk,thevraptor,7,Fri Jun 26 15:34:14 2015 UTC,"If this film is the endgame, then it'll definitely have all those things plus higher production values. However, if this movie is what I think it is - a way to garner new viewers, then I fear it'll look like something more akin to the first SpongeBob movie. What I mean by that is, they'll introduce a brand new, one-off villain for the heroes to overcome. Also, there won't be much continuation of character growth from the show, in fact, the characters will probably revert (perhaps not fully) to the way they were at the beginning of the show - Finn will be an unquestionable hero, Jake is the comic relief, P-Bubs is the princess and nothing more etc.  Obviously, the writers and co. have improved a lot since the beginning of the show, so the film won't exist in it's own bubble universe, but I do think it'll be just a one-off adventure. I hope I'm wrong. I do hope that the creators of the show are able to pull off something special for the existing fans and the same time, gain new viewers and make lots of money, because they do deserve it."
adventuretime,3b7bhk,AbdulRakhib,4,Fri Jun 26 15:56:23 2015 UTC,"The thing is, if it relies on existing plotlines, then it would be confusing for new viewers. I'm sure the writers can write a great one-off plotline while still retaining the character depth that you were worried about.  As for the villian, I'm sure that they can create a fantastic antagonist for the movie. Either that or they'll use Golb."
adventuretime,3b7bhk,Lifelikeahobo,3,Fri Jun 26 16:04:59 2015 UTC,Golb would be cool because even if you watch the show you don't know that much about him that can't be covered in a quick montage or something to that effect.

adventuretime,3b9aij,alexxerth,-4,Sat Jun 27 01:30:53 2015 UTC,"Glad to see I'm not the only one.  I mean, I still like AT, but I just feel like there isn't much...progression, I guess?  I mean, with Steven universe stuff happens, things and people change.  Steven gets more powers, we learn more about the Gem's past, Connie gets freaking sword skills, and all sorts of stuff.  There's a sense of progress to it all.  With Adventure Time, I feel like there just isn't much that's actually changing now.  I mean, look at the comet, that was geared up to be literally an agent of change.   What changed as a result of the comet?  Finn's dad is gone.  Which was the norm for the entirety of his existence on this show.  I really feel like there is something big that's going to happen eventually, we've seen the future of the candy kingdom, we know something happens.  But when?  I mean, they set up like fifteen chekhov's guns, fired 14 of them, and they all turned out to be blanks."
adventuretime,3b9aij,Roneci,2,Sat Jun 27 02:01:00 2015 UTC,"I mean, look at the comet, that was geared up to be literally an agent of change. What changed as a result of the comet?     Are you kidding me?   I don't think that the comet has to ""hit"" or directly affect someone through communication and intention like with Martin.    I think like in traditional mythos and legend, the comet just being there in the sky is enough to affect change. A comet in the sky has been a portent of change throughout human history, and it never requires an impact for the comet to be blamed for the changes.    I think we can blame Magic Ma'am on the comet even more directly than you may think, remember Glob sacrificed himself thinking that he was stopping the catalyst comet, so even though what he hit was Martin's ship, it happened because of the real catalyst comet. Without Glob's helmet Betty never would have been in a position to transform.    We can blame the comet as well for the night that the Cosmic Owl neglected his duties. Gunter was becoming more aware of his nature because of the comet and in this state of awakening Gunter proceeded to affect dreams and manipulate Cosmic Owl, which completely altered the timeline due to many, many dreams that should have been prophetic remaining unvisited by the Owl.    I think people are missing the point that the comet affects change in much more subtle ways than just hitting the planet.  Just to go further, we can blame Princess Bubblegum's fall from power on the catalyst comet too, due to the connection with Gunter and the prophetic dream -- which as I've demonstrated happened directly because of the comet."
adventuretime,3b9aij,AspiringRacecar,2,Sun Jun 28 08:21:01 2015 UTC,"I mean, look at the comet, that was geared up to be literally an agent of change. What changed as a result of the comet?   Well, since it was prevented from striking the Earth, it didn't end up becoming a new embodiment of good or evil like it was supposed to. However, it did indirectly lead to PB not campaigning against the King of Ooo, as well as all the stuff that just happened with Gunter/Orgalorg, Finn and Martin, which could eventually have some major effects, especially since I don't think Finn's prophetic dream has really come true yet."

There was also no way for him to know about Finn's grass-arm, and generally speaking Orgaglorg didn't really witness anything that indicated Finn's power.   So yes, it was a relatively ""easy"" victory for Finn, but that doesn't belittle Finn's power nor Orgaglorg's. Orgalorg was simply ignorant and had dropped his guard. It would definitely not play out similarly if they met in the space of battle again."

adventuretime,3azk4t,Guybrushes,3,Tue Jun 30 15:35:45 2015 UTC,"Saw your thing in writing prompts. I loved the prompt so I'd written something before it vanished:  Bren is facing down a monster. They both stare at each other, panting, twitching towards weapons, etc.  BREN: Now is the time-  MONSTER: (half a second behind) Now is the time-  Bren frowns.  BREN: Now is the time-  MONSTER: (half a second behind) Now is the time-  Bren growls  BREN & MONSTER: (simultaneously) Nowisthetimeto- Nowis-   BREN: Come on! You're ruining this!  MONSTER: My species has no need of dramatic tension.  Bren attacks. They fight. It's as awesome as you can animate. Bren gets a shot in and knocks him down.  MONSTER: I concede. The day is yours.  BREN: You concede?  MONSTER: I do.  BREN: Wow. I really hadn't thought this through.  MONSTER: Do with me as you will.  BREN: I'm not really sure what that would be. I've got nowhere to put you.   MONSTER: You're not going to kill me?  BREN: It seems kind of mean at this point.  CUT TO -   MONSTER is walking off with his arm in a sling. BREN is waving goodbye.  BREN: You got enough for a cab?  MONSTER: I've got an expense account.  CUT TO -  THE VOID. It looks like a trendy start-up's rec room. Sitting in bean-bags or egg-shaped chairs are JENNA, the dream warrior, EDMAR, the fluffy looking cute monkey-thing, and MOLOCH, the Dark One.  BREN flops down onto a beanbag. They nod at each other in recognition.  BREN: Can I ask you a question?  MOLOCH: Sure.  BREN: What do you do with a monster who concedes?  EDMAR: Never leave an enemy alive. It's bad technique.  JENNA scowls.  MOLOCH: I don't know. It's never happened to me. But I tend to sew their lips shut.  EDMAR: That just makes it harder to take the face off. Never leave an enemy with its face still attached. That's a basic rule. That's basic. You should know that. Face should be one of the first things that comes off.  JENNA folds her arms in disgust.  JENNA: If an enemy concedes, you can't hurt them. You've got to have a code. You have a code, Bren?  BREN: I guess. I thought I did. I never really thought about it.  EDMAR: You gotta have a code.  MOLOCH: Definitely.  BREN: You guys were just talking about sewing lips shut and cutting faces off.   MOLOCH: That's the code.  MOLOCH and EDMAR fist-bump.  JENNA throws her hands up in despair.  JENNA: Ugh! There's no talking to you guys!  EDMAR: I've spent the last three nights being snuggled in a garden of flowers. I'm the greatest warrior my world has ever known and nine times out of ten when I get taken Outside, I end up as a novelty backpack. Don't come to me with your problems of fallen foes.   MOLOCH: Being in a nightmare isn't any easier. Last one I was in had so many spiders even I was freaked out.  JENNA walks her fingers like a spider on MOLOCH's back. He jumps in the air.  MOLOCH: That's not cool.  EDMAR: Seriously. You've got to have a code.  JENNA decides to ignore them. She turns to BREN.  JENNA: So what did you do?  BREN: I let him go. I made him promise not to come back, but even that seemed kind of a cop-out. It's not like we get a choice, is it?  JENNA: You did the right thing. I'm proud of you.  BREN blushes. It's obvious he likes JENNA. Hey, why do we capitalise names in scripts? It seems weird. Anyway, BREN stares out of the window at the spinning and spiraling void of infinite possibilities outside.  BREN: Seems like we don't get enough choices. Ever wonder who it is out there, pulling all the strings?  MOLOCH: Best not to think about it. Whoever it is, they're clearly sick.  BREN: You guys ever think about what would happen if we met up out there?  MOLOCH: Sometimes. It's bound to happen sooner or later.  EDMAR: When it does, you better watch your face.   MOLOCH bristles  MOLOCH: You won't get anywhere near my face, fluffmo!  EDMAR: I'll be wearing your face like a surgical mask, you-  They look like they're going to fight. JENNA grabs each of their ears (they've got ears, by the way) and sit them back down again.  BREN is still staring out of the window.  JENNA: Don't listen to those guys, Bren. We ever meet up out there, maybe we won't be fighting monsters. Maybe we'll be doing something different, like -  BREN: (a little too quickly and enthusiastically) Like ice-skating under cherry blossoms on an autumn evening?  JENNA: I was going to say dialling a really long number into a telephone, and then getting it wrong and having to start all over again, but getting it wrong again and spending all night dialling. You never had to do that one?  BREN: (disappointed) Yeah. That's what I meant.  Good luck with the search!"
adventuretime,3azk4t,KelonjAllDay,2,Wed Jun 24 19:52:42 2015 UTC,"Also, from what I know, scriptwriters capitalise names and locations to make it easier for the actors to read, also some softwares (such as Celtix) recognise fully capitalised names as new characters and it's easier to organise them later.  Though you only capitalise iy the first time otherwise it registers two different characters with the same name, then things get loopy. Though I dont know the full reason, only what my mom has told me (she has a doctorate in scriptwriting)"

adventuretime,3auygt,CouldaBeenWorse,16,Tue Jun 23 18:40:47 2015 UTC,"For what it is worth, here are my observations.  A lot of people jumped on the Adventure Time train back in early seasons which were chaotic with episodes which had little to do with each other. I think the tipping point was when season four came. The Flame Princess arc was too story driven and led them to believe that the show had lost the spontaneity and creativity of earlier seasons.  Now the show is swinging yet again, but it is bigger. It went from being a loose collection of days in Finn's life to being a story of his development with a lot of background  of the land of Ooo to build the setting and then to a huge collection of storylines all around Finn and his friends, and somewhere, it became a documentary of a set of hugely cosmic events which happen to center on a protagonist who was formally defined by his humanity in an essentially alien world.  The show has almost completely redefined itself around its relatively constant center several times, and some people came to the show for one of those definitions without really becoming attached to the center. So as Ooo develops and the show attacks it from different angles, people jump ship because the previous view was the thing that made them love the show."

adventuretime,3auygt,substance_dualism,3,Tue Jun 23 19:01:41 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people did not enjoy the episodes about Finn learning about relationships with Flame Princess and Princess Bubblegum.    It felt like they were trying to present Finn as a deeper character with flaws and challenges, but what they actually produced was stilted narratives that were often cringe-inducing and awkward.  Instead of making him more emotionally mature, he just got touchy-feely and weak, or occasionally unrealistically, uncomedically pathetic.  Sometimes when shows try to give strong characters flaws they wind up overdoing it, and make the character less sympathetic to a large portion of the audience.  The same thing happened when The Office tried to round out Jim in later season by giving him some flaws and failures to work on.  I feel like Adventure Time has mostly moved away from that, but a large portion of the audience lost enthusiasm during those seasons."

adventuretime,3auygt,Silverriolu295,2,Wed Jun 24 04:20:58 2015 UTC,"I'm probably one of those who hasn't enjoyed S6 as much as previous seasons. It's not so much because of storyline issues, it's more that the show seems to have lost a lot of its sense of fun. I understand that they're trying to show Finn being more mature, but too much of his behavior now is basically just 'meh, whatever.' That, along with the overly convoluted musing on existentialism, makes it that much less fun for me. The much-reduced lack of Finn-Jake bro time is also disappointing.  I'm not even wanting the screaming, ogre-beating Finn and Jake from S1 and S2. My favorite parts of the show were the character-driven episodes where it was just the characters having fun. One of the best examples I can think of is probably Marceline's Closet, where there wasn't any narrative to tell, just three characters interacting in hilarious ways."
adventuretime,3auygt,thevraptor,2,Thu Jun 25 17:14:53 2015 UTC,"I remember waiting for every episode of season 4 to air and enjoying every bit of it. Did the same for when season 5 started with that cliffhanger.. but I immediately felt something was just.. different.. not bad just kinda felt different.. still watched it for a little bit and was ok.. but then the episodes started becoming less entertaining and becoming more about some cryptic nonsense that makes no sense. Only way I can explain it. I saw the episode ""Astral Plane"" for example.. what the hell was that about.. how did Finn exit his body randomly when he went to sleep.. to go around random places whilst talking about cryptic crap.. then going to space and having GGGG dying or something? That kind of stuff if what I'm talking about. It wasn't entertaining in the slightest just confusing and weird.. and.. cryptic as I said. So yes the show has changed that's undeniable. If you still enjoy it.. well congrats! I wish I could enjoy it as once before.. and if you think I'm just not into it anymore.. I can watch season 1-4 episodes today and still enjoy them no problem. So no. Sorry for the ramble."

adventuretime,3auygt,Distraction182,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:27:20 2015 UTC,"By ""so many people"", do you mean your friends, or ""a group of users on an internet forum""? Because I've seen those in the second group, such as the cartoon board on GameFAQs, and from what I can gather, there are a few common points for the hate. I still love the show to pieces, its currently my favorite cartoon, and it is still hugely popular, because ""a group of users on an internet forum"" is a very vocal minority. Anyway, as for those points...  -The show has gotten too ""big"". Like, it started off as post-apocalyptic Earth with weird denizens and wacky adventures. Then comes this huge evil being known as the Lich. Then we get peeks of alternate timelines and what the nuclear fallout was like. THEN we are dealing with cosmic entities and events like Orgalorg, the Citadel, and the Catylist Comet.  -The show is getting to philosophical. I can see where they are coming from with this point. I'm fine with allegory and leaving things open to interpretation, but just to make things cryptic and deep for the sake of being cryptic and deep is just annoying. The Mountain is a prime example of this.  -The show builds up huge events, only to resolve them really quickly. This is another thing I can agree on, but it doesn't really bother me because I just enjoy the ride and the worldbuilding. The show has kind of always done this, but it was more understandable earlier on because the stakes weren't nearly as high. Take the most recent arc, for example. The Catalyst Comet was set to be this harbinger of doom and Orgalorg was set to be this feared cosmic beast that is as old as time itself. Both of them are quickly dealt with within minutes. The comet offers Finn the opportunity to ascend to a higher plane of existence, which he declines and his father takes instead. Orgalor's plan is thwarted thanks to Finn's grass sword, and is now back to being Gunther due to latching onto Banana Man's spaceship. (Although I am sure that wont be the last we have seen of Orgalorg.)  -The show has simply become too dark and edgy.  Those are the reasons I have gathered, so make of it what you will."

I think I kinda wanna say something about that! Usually this cosplay isn't that um...boob-y! Standing up straight hides all clevage all together! Its pretty lucky, that. And I know youre like uuuh-huuuu you're bending over I know what youre doing shifty eyes. But the thing is, i really am just trying to show off the backpack and everything I made! I had to use my laptop, and all the other pictures I took either cut off the hat or the socks or I couldn't get the backpack in.... I thought a long time about posting this picture or not, cause, well honestly i don't like how much my cleavage shows! Mostly I just cosplay dudes, cause its a lot easier.  I've always had a bigger chest, probably cause I'm pretty darn curvy! BUT I decided, heck it all, this picture is one of the cutest I've taken. Plus it shows off as much of the backpack as I've ever been able to show without turning around... And I look way skinnier then I actually am in it hehe, so yeah, I liked that too. I'm also as asexual as the day is long so I really didn't think people would have such a reaction...aren't boobs just like, literally just fat lumps that produce milk? I mean, they kinda are gross when you think about it!   and one of the reasons I like fionna is because shes so confident. She's silly, and fun, but she knows who she is as a person and doesnt let little things embarrass her. So! I know my chest shows more than it needs to but darn it I really like this picture! So I decided to be self confident enough to post it, even though it is about a year old.  Bweh, I'm typing way way too much sorry! I kinda babble when I'm anxious. BUT thanks for taking the time to comment and like my cosplay everyone! Im just gonna go scuttle of reddit and not check it for like, um, a couple months?? Yeah!! That seems like a good amount of time hahaha!"

Sex shouldn't be something to be ashamed of, it's natural. Even though I said it, it was half a joke, and while you said that boobs are gross I think you know that subconsciously they're aesthetically pleasing at least in some way because the picture you took here is just fine. You look amazing without seeming overtly grotesque about the cleavage, it's modest at worst.

adventuretime,3aluc6,NuggetX3,19,Sun Jun 21 14:16:04 2015 UTC,"The PB-Finn relationship is definitely one of the show's more complex. We know that Finn really liked PB, and that he might still have feelings for her, but that PB was 'turned off' (for lack of a better term) due to being focused on her duty as queen.  The show could literally go in any direction with them at this point."
adventuretime,3aluc6,Way_Moby,6,Sun Jun 21 14:41:13 2015 UTC,"I feel like Finn has moved on from PB in the recent episodes. I dunno, he just doesn't show the same thing he used to show (gosh my wording :P) before, like blushing, when PB goes asking him a favor or something."
adventuretime,3aluc6,JD0806,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:07:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah not only that, but PB went from being a pretty straightforward and likable character to being really manipulative and crazy."
adventuretime,3aluc6,puzzlednerd,15,Fri Jul 3 18:04:34 2015 UTC,IDK. The time when she became Finn's age physically kind of negates the theory for me. She was definitely interested in him.
adventuretime,3aluc6,silverblaze92,5,Sun Jun 21 15:10:45 2015 UTC,"In the ""Pajama Wars"" episode, it seems their platonic relationship could have gone a little further, but it was interrupted because of PB's duty as a princess."
adventuretime,3aluc6,Fishy63,4,Sun Jun 21 16:27:50 2015 UTC,"FP's reaction to a kiss could melt down the planet, she's just concerned for the safety of Ooo"
adventuretime,3aluc6,Volner,3,Sun Jun 21 14:43:42 2015 UTC,"Even more horrifying, she was willing to let Finn suffocate and die if it meant killing Flame Princess and saving the planet."
adventuretime,3aluc6,LilPotato911,3,Sun Jun 21 23:10:13 2015 UTC,There is a theory that PB is a sociopath.
adventuretime,3aluc6,Usermane01,3,Tue Jun 23 14:29:48 2015 UTC,Theory?  It's god damned canon at this point!

adventuretime,3aluc6,ThisTemporaryLife,9,Mon Jun 29 01:45:22 2015 UTC,I've always liked the thought of Marceline and Finn being the endgame relationship. There's already a bit of romantic tension between the two. And I feel like Marceline was expressing some sort of subconscious want for Finn when she told her Fionna and Cake story.
adventuretime,3aluc6,DaCh33f,6,Sun Jun 21 17:04:59 2015 UTC,I think PB and Marceline represent two ends of a spectrum. And Finn lies in the middle. That is why there is a tension between the three of them.
adventuretime,3aluc6,Jackbo_Manhorse,2,Sun Jun 21 23:02:30 2015 UTC,PB and Marceline used to go out though. XD
adventuretime,3aluc6,Entershikari,0,Mon Jun 22 07:08:24 2015 UTC,There's already a bit of romantic tension between the two   [Citation needed]
adventuretime,3aluc6,Awesom3xNinja,3,Thu Jun 25 03:57:47 2015 UTC,"I know that the love between Finn and FP was brought back to light in the finale, possibly negating any thoughts on him liking anyone else nearly as much anymore, but I can't help but feel he may move back into place relationship wise with either Marceline or PB fairly easily. There's always been a bit of romantic tension between him and Marceline, but there's also definitely a connection between him and PB when she's more worry free, the primary example being when her physical age was brought down to equal Finn's. I feel like this connection could resurface more after her loss of the election, and in turn her power and need to care for Ooo as much. With less stress on those fronts, she may have more time and mind to create a stronger connection with Finn like she did when she was briefly younger, just a bit of headcannon for consideration :3"
adventuretime,3aluc6,LordMegatron586,2,Sun Jun 21 21:59:28 2015 UTC,I think since PB lost her kingdom she's going to be having a lot more free time. I think the major problem was her duties as the princess and the age difference (Finn's 17 so he's a lot older since he originally started like PB.) I think with this free time she's going to get to know Finn lot more and like him this upcoming season.
adventuretime,3aluc6,Havok-Trance,2,Mon Jun 22 02:40:30 2015 UTC,Now that she's not a queen anymore maybe she'll see Finn in a different way. And he'll be 17 years old too.   I think they'll date once he'll be much more mature when he'll be less clingy and needy thanks to experience.
adventuretime,3aluc6,Andy_Lisinski,2,Mon Jun 22 02:51:17 2015 UTC,"Well, Finn and Jake are technically part of the Candy Kingdom and PB treats her subjects like her children, so that could explain their relationship. Although that now PB has been ""deposed"" as a ruler, it could change."
adventuretime,3aluc6,isaalacrymosaa,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:40:40 2015 UTC,"Though I'm more of a FP/Finn shipper, I genuinely hope that the show writers explore this in season 7, with PB no longer being the ruler of the Candy Kingdom. It opens up a whole new road of possibilities."

Empress Bubblegum would have stuck a dagger in whimsey.

adventuretime,3ac8rw,TimeLordBurrito,4,Fri Jun 19 03:05:04 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend either, honestly. The best thing people have to point to with HIKWYSOG is the theme song. That should tell you a lot."

adventuretime,3ac8rw,Docjaded,4,Fri Jun 19 06:33:44 2015 UTC,"It's not a bad game. It's just like an old school dungeon crawler. People don't like it cause it's repeative, but that's what a dungeon crawler is. People don't realize this expect something like the first game."
adventuretime,3ac8rw,WizKoulikov,12,Fri Jun 19 14:25:36 2015 UTC,I grew up on the dungeon crawler genre...  This was a bad dungeon crawler.

adventuretime,3ac8rw,triconda,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:44:47 2015 UTC,There's a lot of Rougelike games that take your unspent money. It pushes you to work harder and stay in the dungeon longer. And like people are saying you get an item later on that lets you keep it.   As of the crashing I've never experienced that. I've played on 3DS so I'm not sure if it's less stable on other platforms.
adventuretime,3ac8rw,triconda,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:55:09 2015 UTC,"I play on 3DS as well.  When there are too many enemies onscreen, it goes boom (Susan Strong's stage or the Lemongrab stage are frequent culprits).  I would stay in the dungeon longer but after 10 levels it sends you to town whether or not you select yes."

""Adventure Time: Explore the dungeon because I don't know"" combines the old playability of Gauntlet. No online, no DLCs (at least for 3DS IIRC), 4 players with different skills, a lot of dungeons, you need to gain treasures to improve your character.  A zillion references to the show (the cyclops tears, the hugwolves, the bosses, the annoying Magic Man...)        The music, sometimes is a nice BGM, but sometimes is EPIC.        The game is hard and is repetitive, for fucks sake, it's GAUNTLET with Finn and Jake.        The second part (The nameless Kingdom) is like a Zelda game.        I get every achievement in XBOX 360 (even the Nightsphere stages). This game is only intended for the adult audience of Adventure Time, nowadays if kids don't get a checkpoint every 2 seconds it's sooooo hard.        /rant."

adventuretime,3ae1sq,GreatDragonator,9,Fri Jun 19 17:37:29 2015 UTC,"There's no real consistency or schedule, you know? Kids really like schedules and consistency. So, if you get used to ""Every thursday at 6, X show is on. Then 6:30 is Y show and 7 is Z show."" And then suddenly, it changes, to ""This week at 6, X show is on. Y show is on next week at 6. Z show is on the following week at 6.""   You can't really expect anyone to follow that. It will just sort of end up being, ""Oh, I guess X show isn't on anymore? Weird.

adventuretime,3ae1sq,MrScottyTay,3,Fri Jun 19 11:41:23 2015 UTC,"I think it might be because of the steven bomb taking up a timeslot each day. They probably prioritised that over a rerun when the season has just ended too, sort of like a mini break."

On the weekends, reruns/new episodes of Transformers, Sonic Boom, and Pokemon are also on the schedule, all 3 of those only air at 6-9am est. Adult Swim takes up 10 hours of each day's schedule.  Currently, only one show every weekday gets a new episode, and  that changes every week.  No AT at all, though. None at any day. Tom and Jerry, their last remaining classic cartoon rerun, is also notably missing.  Even worse, it looks like TTG is getting a 5 and a half hour marathon EVERY DAY."

adventuretime,3ae1sq,Sithsaber,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:53:26 2015 UTC,"Then you don't understand the point of the show.  The original ended nicely.  Go! isn't ruining your childhood, it's attracting a much younger audience to that world so that when they're older, they may stumble upon the original Teen Titans and enjoy life even more.  That being said, Teen Titans Go! is a hilarious semi-parody.  I loved the original just as much as any fan, but I love Go! it's own special way.  It's amazingly funny and clever and still has a bit of the comedic charm from the original.  If you watch this show and expect it to be the original Teen Titans, you're doing it wrong, and I feel bad for you."

I've emptied many tissue boxes because of those two episodes. Just... The sheer horror and hopelessness of their situation, the way it's executed... I've watched plenty of shows, most of them for adults, attempt something as emotionally upheaving as those two episodes, but they rarely, if ever, come close.  Edit: I have terrible grammar."
adventuretime,3aarn3,martythedrunkunicorn,6,Thu Jun 18 16:48:32 2015 UTC,"Well the thing is, is that it doesn't seem like it's trying to force emotion. In I Remember You, the thing that made me cry was that it was revealed Marceline's bear was from Simon, and in Simon and Marcy it's when he calls her Gunther that got me, or when he sings the Cheers theme song."
adventuretime,3aarn3,martythedrunkunicorn,6,Thu Jun 18 16:55:46 2015 UTC,"I get what you mean. So many shows attempt to make sad episodes by just throwing depressing things at the wall and seeing what sticks, but not Adventure Time. All the little details they put into it, from the way Marcy gets a tiny smile on her face when Simon kisses her before going to fight whatever was in the bush, to the way that Ice King felt remorse for pushing her, when, with any other character he's hurt, the most he's reacted with is ""whoops, I've got the dropsies."" That's the brilliant thing about this particular storytelling style; it's so fluid and natural that it hardly ever feels forced."

Whenever there's a multi-part canon series is episodes it always makes me want to know more when they're over and it makes me sad that it just goes back to episodic. I think I'd like the series more as a narrative but I'm fine with the way they do it now just cuz some random episodes are hilarious.

adventuretime,3aduu8,WarsDeath,7,Fri Jun 19 08:56:29 2015 UTC,"I find it difficult to see how someone wouldn't find this season interesting. If nothing else, it has been interesting.  But to take some guesses about why you feel that way:   You miss Rebecca Sugar's episodes Steven Universe is much more dramatic and frequently provides backstory, character development and/or plot progression   I'm still watching Adventure Time because I find it to be unique, diverse, unpredictable, funny, authentic, powerful and increasingly interesting.  As for whether Season 7 will ""bring it back to its former glory,"" Jesse Moynihan has said that he shifted more towards humor, characters and adventurous scenarios for Season 7, so there's something. Though Pen apparently stopped doing episode outlines a few months after they started writing the season, so he could focus on the movie."
adventuretime,3aduu8,AspiringRacecar,2,Fri Jun 19 10:37:53 2015 UTC,"It was interesting, and i still like AT, ive realized after readingSkyDancingLeaf's comment, i think it was just the last fourth of the seasons side episodes didnt appeal to me, which is wierd saying since my favorite episodes are side stories like Evergreen from this season and Simon & Marcy from last, but its probably the fact that i hate finns dad so much and i dont like baby lich very much either and they focused around them I will say Graybles 1000+ had me seriously like ""What the serious fuck"", i guess since im also used to adventure time being more ""fun"" this season was a lot more serious overall"
adventuretime,3aduu8,twerpturd,2,Fri Jun 19 11:57:30 2015 UTC,"There is a thing with Rebecca Sugar and AT, where some people think her episodes were the best, and now like SU better than AT.  I'm a JMoyns/Tom Herpich fan myself, and never cared for Rebecca, so I'm still 100% satisfied with AT.  I've watched some SU, and from the very beginning I saw that it was well made and was very quickly trying to develop its side characters and hint at some backstory.  I think Pearl is a pretty awesome character.  But there's just lots of stuff that I don't like about it.  If you sat next to me and watched some episodes, I'd point out a bunch of specific things that bug me.  I chalk it up to Rebecca Sugar being such a tremendous talent that she was too much herself to jibe well with AT.  She needed to be separated from AT, but given her own show to realize her own vision.  Everybody wins."
adventuretime,3aduu8,BestNameEver_,2,Fri Jun 19 09:24:16 2015 UTC,"If you sat next to me and watched some episodes, I'd point out a bunch of specific things that bug me   I'm curious, could you share these? Something has been bothering me lately about the show as well."
adventuretime,3aduu8,BWoodrum,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:21:02 2015 UTC,I'm streets behind. What is SU?
adventuretime,3aduu8,twerpturd,6,Fri Jun 19 15:25:57 2015 UTC,"SU is Steven Universe, which was created by former AT (Adventure Time) storyboarder Rebecca Sugar.  while I'm at it:  Rebecca instantly made her name known among AT diehards with ""It Came From The Nightosphere"" and the Fry Song that Marceline sang that episode.  She also did Susan Strong, the first two Fionna & Cake episodes, the first Lich episode, the first few Flame Princess episodes, and was known as the storyboarder who did AT's most important episodes during the era.  She was also known for the songs she wrote for the show, like the Fry Song and Bacon Pancakes.  I wasn't a fan."
adventuretime,3aduu8,LadyRavenEye,4,Fri Jun 19 15:46:57 2015 UTC,Steven Universe is a glorious manifestation of everything that is Right and Good with media today.  But it takes some warming up (like a lot of early seasons of various television shows--including imo AT).    First 35 episodes are ad-free on hulu+ ;)
adventuretime,3aduu8,SkyDancingLeaf,2,Fri Jun 19 16:05:31 2015 UTC,"My only issue with Adventure time is they just dick around too much I between major plot points.  I get that there needs to be suspense and waiting, and fun moments, and not everything has to be some big epic show-stopper. But they just drag it out too long for me to keep my interest.  After the amazing Season 6 opening, I really wanted to see where the arm/Dad thing went. But they just threw the arm back on like it was nothing (only to have it, predictably, show up Deus Ex style at the end of Season 6) and they just ignored all the Dad stuff apart from a couple episodes.  I feel like they just tried to hard to string us along, and broke up the story way too much. This is why I now like Steven Universe better. It still has funny filler-type episodes, but the story goes and gets moving at a much more reasonable pace.  Because that's what a show is about, a story. Not unneeded suspense due to a 10 episode gap between the season's ""main"" story. Adventure Time just drags it out for the sake of dragging it out."
adventuretime,3aduu8,Sithsaber,2,Fri Jun 19 11:16:07 2015 UTC,"AT got experimental, and so organicly told that all the arcs stepped on each other in a way that wasn't meant to be ""satisfying"" in a traditional sense."

It had a bunch of great episodes though, and I like this more philosophical approach, but if Season 7 truly is more humor and adventure based, I feel it will improve."

Apparently after a couple of James Bond films Connery gave the studios an ultimatum which boiled down to this -""Make the film ZARDOZ or I ain't doing and more Bond films!""    Voila! We can now see Connery in a banana hammock, a drugged up telepathic Übermensch super-society, and a future mutant Jimmy Stewart impersonator."
adventuretime,3a3fk9,Uncivilized_Elk,419,Tue Jun 16 22:39:33 2015 UTC,This scene made me insanely uncomfortable more  then anything else.
adventuretime,3a3fk9,bluegreenwookie,215,Tue Jun 16 23:46:09 2015 UTC,Right? It's basically rape.
adventuretime,3a3fk9,TheAlbatross,168,Wed Jun 17 01:06:36 2015 UTC,It's straight up rape.  LSP deflowers Finn.

I'd like to believe it was just a really sloppy make-out session. ""Taking it to the deep end"" can imply makeouts if the ""kiddy pool"" was just a peck on the lips."
adventuretime,3a3fk9,IronTank,45,Wed Jun 17 07:59:55 2015 UTC,"it's still clearly unwanted shit, the visual metaphor of the flower is definitely a real thing, and it makes sense within the context of the episode."

adventuretime,3a3fk9,zephyrtr,6,Wed Jun 17 15:09:05 2015 UTC,finn clearly didn't consent
adventuretime,3a3fk9,reprapraper,-3,Wed Jun 17 23:23:38 2015 UTC,People started being flippant about this topic when they found this scene hilarious.
adventuretime,3a3fk9,Oldchap226,4,Wed Jun 17 17:28:01 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't understand how other people being unkind absolves you for being unkind as well.  This one was a pretty emotional episode; and I think it delves into a lot of the pitfalls of early relationships. They did put in some humor there, with it being LSP and all and the ridiculous double entendre, but I think the whole theme of the episode (and that includes Finn's regrettable morning) is something a lot of people can or will relate to. It's okay to get bent outta shape about it; but people will have different reactions to this episode, and that's okay too."
adventuretime,3a3fk9,zephyrtr,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:38:57 2015 UTC,"Woah, woah, woah. First off, all they did was make-out, but the metaphor is there. The whole episode is about Finn exploring making out with people to overcome sadness and depression; the making out is OF COURSE a metaphor for casual sex, but to all those people who assume and/or swear by the interpretation that it's 100% a sex scene... I mean, you do realize there are other ways of interpreting this, right?  Also, there's a MASSIVE difference between rape, and having sex and then regretting it later."
adventuretime,3a3fk9,Way_Moby,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:49:03 2015 UTC,"Virginity doesn't necessarily imply sexual virginity, just in case you somehow didn't get that.  Did you think the Virgin Islands were named for people who hadn't had sex yet? Or because people decided to make the act of someone discovering the land a giant metaphor for sex?"
adventuretime,3a3fk9,SketchingScars,40,Wed Jun 17 18:59:13 2015 UTC,"because when AT wants to get dark, it gets dark."
adventuretime,3a3fk9,Lucifer_Hirsch,32,Wed Jun 17 09:07:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but really? I feel like it's just being looked into too deeply. Is it really AT wanting to get dark or is it the community? It was a funny kissing joke and the community is twisting it into rapey time."
adventuretime,3a3fk9,IronTank,58,Wed Jun 17 09:38:02 2015 UTC,"Except that Finn's flower loses a petal right after LSP does whatever she does, a common symbol of the loss of innocence."
adventuretime,3a3fk9,Turnoffdefaults,8,Wed Jun 17 10:28:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but his flower had been losing petals the whole episode.  I took it to mean that the plan to kiss the princesses wasn't working."
adventuretime,3a3fk9,namegoeswhere,22,Wed Jun 17 13:13:22 2015 UTC,Obviously that was the point of the scene but it doesn't mean they had sex and it certainly doesn't mean it wasn't consensual.
adventuretime,3a3fk9,AfghanPandaMan,19,Wed Jun 17 11:01:13 2015 UTC,"Well Finn obviously didn't want it at the beginning, so he probably didn't randomly change his mind."
adventuretime,3a3fk9,WubShrimp,2,Wed Jun 17 13:30:56 2015 UTC,"Um he went in for the kiss the first time. We don't see if he went in for the kiss the second time because it was a POV shot made to freak audiences out a little, but prior to that he had the same expression as before he went in for the first peck, and he never said ""I don't feel like swimming"".  So I don't see the ""obvious""."
adventuretime,3a3fk9,SketchingScars,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:39:27 2015 UTC,Since when did innocence come to mean specifically ones sexual virginity?
adventuretime,3a3fk9,NuwandaTheDruid,9,Wed Jun 17 19:00:09 2015 UTC,"I agree that it probably wasn't sex. But Finn is done. He doesn't want any more, and LSP forces him to go the futherest he ever has; sloppy makeouts. It's not necessarily rape, but it's definitely non-consensual, hence the ""deflowering""."
adventuretime,3a3fk9,IronTank,-4,Wed Jun 17 18:38:59 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I acknowledge the flower petal as a loss of innocence and the covering up with sleeping bag as a sign of regret.  We've seen how Finn acts when he is 100% not giving consent for something though, like the episode with clowns kissing his feet. He was injured and to an extent imobile yet he still protests and walks out of the house to find the magical tear to heal himself.  If Finn really didn't want to make-out with LSP he would've screamed in a funny way and ran off through the woods. So yes, his innocence was lost to an extent and he regretted what he did with LSP but it doesn't have to get so dark and serious of a metaphor."
adventuretime,3a3fk9,Flooping_Pigs,3,Wed Jun 17 19:18:13 2015 UTC,A user here already noted that a falling flower petal means a taking of virginity in manga. Or somethin's.
adventuretime,3a3fk9,AntsInMyMouth,7,Wed Jun 17 12:54:30 2015 UTC,Doesn't Penn voice LSP?  So how creepy was that for him to voice?
adventuretime,3a3fk9,trainercatlady,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:48:40 2015 UTC,I would genuinely love to know this.
adventuretime,3a3fk9,efgi,6,Wed Jun 17 13:04:07 2015 UTC,Does LSP even have the parts necessary for that? I thought lumpy people reproduced by budding.
adventuretime,3a3fk9,zephyrtr,4,Wed Jun 17 13:03:45 2015 UTC,"Well a deflowering doesn't necessarily imply a rape. I implies loss of virginity, sure, but I got the sense in this episode that Finn was pretty much 'meh' about everything. So when LSP was like, ""We're taking this to the deep end!"" he felt like, 'Okay, whatever.'"
adventuretime,3a3fk9,SagaCult,16,Wed Jun 17 14:30:14 2015 UTC,"He's clearly disturbed in the very next scene, lying there. He even covers himself while LSP sleeps. Sick"
adventuretime,3a3fk9,zephyrtr,5,Wed Jun 17 14:43:46 2015 UTC,"Sure, but a rape is not defined by whether the person regrets it happening or not; it's defined by consent. I've had regrettable sex before; I don't imagine that makes me a rape victim."
adventuretime,3a3fk9,SagaCult,2,Wed Jun 17 15:05:28 2015 UTC,I'll give you that we really didn't see Finn saying no to her
adventuretime,3a3fk9,MrNathanman,12,Wed Jun 17 15:16:49 2015 UTC,Not saying no != yes
adventuretime,3a3fk9,zephyrtr,0,Wed Jun 17 16:31:52 2015 UTC,"While you are right, courts in the real world are still deciding if an absence of a ""no"" implies consent or not.  For a cartoon (we are talking about a cartoon) and in a scene that we don't see in its entirety, I'd say it's impossible for us as viewers to say definitively whether Finn was raped, or if he just had a regrettable experience. Whether he was forced into something he did not want, or if he opened himself up to experiences he later regretted.  When people are on the rebound like this, it's really hard to say — Finn seems to be open for whatever, so long as it might make him feel something, and that might include some regrettable sex. I think that's the point the artists wanted to get across, though they did come out and say LSP was only talking about french kissing so ..."
adventuretime,3a3fk9,MrNathanman,3,Wed Jun 17 17:24:44 2015 UTC,"I think it is pretty clear.  I'm going to use the same quote I did elsewhere. Replacing some of the actual words with what is going on if you agree that this scene could be about sex.  "" Wha—What?! I didn't wait infinity [to make out]! We're [having sex]!""  Fin then expressed discomfort.   LSP grabs fin by the shirt and the last thing you see is LSPs lips.   If this were not a cartoon there would be no question as to what happened."
adventuretime,3a3fk9,Rodanz,-4,Wed Jun 17 18:12:27 2015 UTC,Not saying no while being perfectly aware and conscious of your actions= Yes. Regretting it later doesn't nullify consent.
adventuretime,3a3fk9,Oldchap226,5,Wed Jun 17 17:27:25 2015 UTC,Non-consensual loss of virginity is still rape last time I checked.
adventuretime,3a3fk9,zephyrtr,0,Wed Jun 17 14:38:14 2015 UTC,"All I'm saying is: since there's a cutaway, we really can't know if Finn consented or not — and a 'deflowering' is a classic metaphor for loss of virginity; not necessarily a rape, so you can't point to that for certainty."
adventuretime,3a3fk9,Oldchap226,2,Wed Jun 17 14:58:13 2015 UTC,"I'd be fine with a scene like this if it was aimed for adults. However, this show is not. Kids see this and might start thinking it's ok to pressure people into things. Even if that person feels uncomfortable and gives cues about being uncomfortable, it's ok since you're only pressuring and they didn't exactly ""fight back."""
adventuretime,3a3fk9,Rodanz,4,Wed Jun 17 17:31:45 2015 UTC,"At which point has the show EVER stablished Lump Princess as a role model? If anything the stablished rule of thumb is, if you see her do it, it's probably wrong and awful."
adventuretime,3a3fk9,zephyrtr,3,Wed Jun 17 17:36:55 2015 UTC,"Well I think the following scene makes it pretty clear the show doesn't endorse that kind of behavior; there are repercussions for it, and LSP lately has regularly been painted as someone you don't want to be. I don't generally agree with talking down to kids, and this was left pretty ambiguous, and also had a solid moral compass so I can see why S&P allowed it."
adventuretime,3a3fk9,Rodanz,-4,Wed Jun 17 17:40:45 2015 UTC,"Regretting it later doesn't nullify consent. Finn was aware, conscious and perfectly capable of stopping it at any time. It was not rape."

Finn never actually actively protests -- he says he's unsure and might not be ready, but who the hell doesn't say some version of that when they lose their virginity?  That whole tihng is overblown, it was an awkward first sexual experience, no more than that."
adventuretime,3a3fk9,TheAlbatross,36,Wed Jun 17 04:23:21 2015 UTC,Hmm if someone is unsure and the other person forces the issue... Yeah that's not consent
adventuretime,3a3fk9,Roneci,21,Wed Jun 17 04:32:07 2015 UTC,"I didn't see it as forced, I saw it as a nudge.  Nudges are okay, it's part of natural give and take.  The whole ""active enthusiastic consent"" culture is new and kind of ridiculous, imo."
adventuretime,3a3fk9,Yojimara,18,Wed Jun 17 04:37:25 2015 UTC,"True, there is such a thing as nuance when it comes to real natural sexual contact."
adventuretime,3a3fk9,Roneci,23,Wed Jun 17 04:43:11 2015 UTC,"I can see why people may say it was rape or rapey, but I don't see it. Finn says he is not a good swimmer meaning he is not competent in this territory, but he does not say ""I don't want to go swimming."" The ""right in the vault"" comment though does make it sort of dark though... but there's no good indication Finn wanted the ""event"" to end during its (inter)course.  The conversation is basically: ""Let's have sex."" ""But I'm not very good/knowledgeable."" ""I'll guide you.""  That isn't rape. It's just weird when it's LSP.  Either way though, LSP can now be described as a sexual predator due to that behavior, because god forbid she encounters somebody weaker than her she wants to take to the deep end...  And nudges are OK as long as they are in no way forceful and IN NO WAY has the other person displayed signs of not wanting to, merely being unsure. If the person is unsure or has fears in regards to say, being inexperienced (like Finn), then soft nudges or affirmations can be fine. If the person at any point says they don't want to or say nothing but their face looks unhappy, THAT SHIT IS NOT OK. That IS rape."
adventuretime,3a3fk9,MrNathanman,3,Wed Jun 17 06:29:30 2015 UTC,"^   This    When people take scenes like this and overblow it and call it rape, it really discredits the experiences and opinions of actual survivors.   ^(Like me)"
adventuretime,3a3fk9,Rodanz,5,Wed Jun 17 15:26:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think LSPs words were a nudge. "" Wha—What?! I didn't wait infinity [to make out]! We're [having sex]!"""

Like, he said he didn't know what he was doing and LSP said that she'd guide him through it (in an super weird way, but still), then they had sex. That's not an uncommon way for someone to lose their virginity."
adventuretime,3a3fk9,designated_shitter,13,Wed Jun 17 07:56:22 2015 UTC,"What makes me uncomfortable is people terming situations like this (which are still deplorable on LSP's part, don't get me wrong) under the same word that's used to describe much worse situations.  Finn was unsure and vulnerable, sure, but he could have easily refused."
adventuretime,3a3fk9,Rodanz,2,Wed Jun 17 10:33:12 2015 UTC,"I took the scene to be clearly non-consensual, but I'm not sure we can then jump to the conclusion that they had sex.  What's irksome is that sex is certainly a possibility, given that Finn and LSP are spending the night together.    So:  maybe rape, maybe not.  Definitely non-consensual. Definitely not cool."

adventuretime,3a3fk9,LadyLaFee,2,Wed Jun 17 17:37:51 2015 UTC,"This scene was the most uncomfortable part, but that's what made me enjoy the episode so much. It really helped explain the complexities of youth sexuality, virginity and even sex addiction.  Throughout the entire episode Finn is trying to doctor the heartbreak from all the loss he's been forced to deal with in a short time (Flame Princess, realizing his father just abandoned him and doesn't really care, losing his arm) he does this by making out with the princesses, but in a lot of ways it's also alluding to his sexual growth and his exploration of who Finn is sexually.  I don't care to speculate if Finn lost his virginity to LSP but that's not the point. The show uses these kinds of moments to engage both the young audience and the mature audience in separate ways but ultimately instill the same moral per say. I like the subtlety in dealing with this issue when it comes across the much younger audience and the intelligence when it comes to viewers like ourselves. It's dark but playful, thought provoking but keeps itself from getting too intense."

adventuretime,3a3fk9,DopeBoyG,96,Tue Jun 16 23:29:54 2015 UTC,"Finn's flower petal falls off (deflowered), he says ""Right in the vault"", and just the presentation of that scene; I don't care what Jesse says, the implications and what was alluded to is oh-so obvious.  Sure, maybe it didn't physically happen in the show, in the same sense they are going to show Finn's crotch on fire rather than him having a boner, but it sure as hell was alluded to far more than I thought you could ever allude to sex on non-AS CN.  Also, the 'ol ""the show is canon, whatever is outside the show is not canon"" thing. Honeslty this scene can be interpreted to whatever tier you want. Probably not tier 15 though."
adventuretime,3a3fk9,Xervicx,31,Tue Jun 16 23:36:16 2015 UTC,"Finn's flower petal falls off (deflowered), he says ""Right in the vault"", and just the presentation of that scene; I don't care what Jesse says, the implications and what was alluded to is oh-so obvious.   I think all of that could still apply to the kissing thing. I mean, has Finn had any other rather sexual or intensely physical moments with anyone in the series before? That might be part of the deflowering thing. And considering the fact it was forced on him he'd probably put it ""right in the vault"".  Though it's also important to point out that no one would ever publicly admit it if sex was supposed to be implied. It's like if the people behind Spongebob admitted half the jokes they make were supposed to be adult in nature. The only time people do that is when there's a huge outrage about something (and half the time they're apologizing for something people just took out of context, while ignoring all the real mature jokes they meant to make)."
adventuretime,3a3fk9,DopeBoyG,14,Wed Jun 17 02:08:22 2015 UTC,He had already kissed how many princesses in that same episode before getting to LSP? And I'm pretty sure he's kissed Fire Princess before too.
adventuretime,3a3fk9,3rdLevelRogue,14,Wed Jun 17 03:38:20 2015 UTC,"Well yes, he did kiss people before, but not in a forceful or even arguably excessively passionate way. It's usually cute pecks on the cheek or lips or a display of affection, not an attempt to create a make out session. The way LSP did it was something a bit more excessive than what he'd been through right? Unless I missed some Finn-on-Princess action somewhere!"
adventuretime,3a3fk9,DopeBoyG,-16,Wed Jun 17 04:05:20 2015 UTC,That's because LSP actually means Little Slut Princess and should be reprimanded for forcing herself on a child... Can you tell I'm a little hurt by what happened?

It ends up with LSP taking him to the deep end, after which he loses a petal (ie, gets deflowered) and sends that memory right to the vault.  It's freakin' genius. I laughed so hard I was nearly crying upon first seeing it (LSP's voice, particularly when she goes ""Woah, where you going?"" just exponentially magnified the comical impact of this scene)."

The only reason he was able to survive is because of his thorn(the grass sword) that reacted to Finn's intense pain and saved him. Not to mention Finn was inside Orgalorg cutting his guts to pieces so of course he got beaten a little quickly. Not to mention the entire episode itself was just rushed."

But she is constantly abusing her authority, which manifests itself through controlling and spying on other people, and rarely ever does she question herself that she might be wrong.  I mean, her whole kingdom is made up of clones she has made just to be able to rule over as a princess. And that's not even mentioning the whole moral line she's skirting by creating clones in the first place. Would she even be a princess if it weren't for the fact that she created all her subjects for herself?  She might not be evil per say. But i wouldn't exactly call her nice either."

adventuretime,3a1s47,Sanjispride,-10,Tue Jun 16 19:35:41 2015 UTC,"""You are not allowed to advertise your personal merchandise"" is right on the sidebar. Post the art, not the etsy shop."
adventuretime,3a1s47,Bitchbitchbitcher,5,Tue Jun 16 18:40:31 2015 UTC,"Unless you have evidence to the contrary,  it's not OP's shop.  Seems ok to me."
adventuretime,3a1s47,i_slobber_buckets,-9,Tue Jun 16 18:54:23 2015 UTC,"Personal friend is close enough for me. No shops at all would be my preference. I have no problem with art, there is no need to link stores,  especially etys. Also OPs pic is the only AT merch in it so its not even relevent past the portrait,  which we see without the store."
adventuretime,3a1s47,Bitchbitchbitcher,2,Tue Jun 16 19:34:26 2015 UTC,"It is custom a.t. portraits, not just that one but agree otherwise; seems more like advertising for her friends shop than for the art. Maybe just put the store in the comments?"
adventuretime,3a1s47,GustavoAmadovar,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:43:41 2015 UTC,I don't really think this sub should advertise shops either.  I just thought you were rolling a bit hard.

I kept waiting for a melody to take off. Great textures and pads though.  Ignore my criticism if you prefer your way - I don't know this genre well. Whatever you do, keep creating!"
adventuretime,3a2o9e,stumppi,2,Wed Jun 17 13:10:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for being civil even though you didn't like it! Thats pretty rare these days. Yeah, the drums probably sound generic because they're pulled off an 808, which is by far the most sampled drum machine in existence right now and I didn't really mess with them besides EQing and setting a bass tone on top.   I never ignore valid criticism, so thank you. Have an upvote."

adventuretime,39xhm5,sn0wer,3,Mon Jun 15 21:37:20 2015 UTC,"Definitely, I think they put it together very well. If you weren't the wiser you'd think it was exclusively an Adventure Time game (like card wars)."

Its basically a ""last gen gamestop"" Plus movies. they had a small counter stand with card packs. The manufacturer is aquarius then it has the cartoon network and frederator logos but im sure thats for legal reasons. that is literally all the info ive got from the box. Sorry men"

adventuretime,3a0cyl,sunspear06,6,Tue Jun 16 06:10:23 2015 UTC,That's my favourte speech on the show.
adventuretime,3a0cyl,AllAtOnc3,16,Tue Jun 16 21:43:30 2015 UTC,No it's not.  It was always and will always continue to be a bunch of nice sounding but ultimately inane words about fighting against the universe's adversity.
adventuretime,3a0cyl,Uncivilized_Elk,4,Tue Jun 16 08:22:12 2015 UTC,"Yes it does, it's a cosmic dance between bursting decadence (sweetness, life) and witheld permissions (terror & death withold other's permission to live freely), and sweetness can win.  The four deserts floating behind him at the end all have colors representing the four elements of OOO - Sugar, Fire, Slime, and Ice.  The Lich's rebirth into Sweet P is very much an illustration of this battle, can sweetness prevail over the Lich's nasty nature?  The Tart Toter's words only make sense to us later (tomorrow) but were relevant even then (yesterday)."
adventuretime,3a0cyl,MrLaughter,2,Tue Jun 16 18:35:05 2015 UTC,But... That was not the intent when they wrote it
adventuretime,3a0cyl,Zordman,10,Tue Jun 16 18:57:09 2015 UTC,With this show it really doesn't have to be. It very well could be retroactively significant.
adventuretime,3a0cyl,mobileredditmademe,2,Wed Jun 17 02:28:41 2015 UTC,Or was it?
adventuretime,3a0cyl,MrLaughter,-5,Tue Jun 16 18:58:00 2015 UTC,"It's not the intent ever. Perhaps it matches the color of the elements... oh wait that has no specific relation to the general struggle of life that the speech is about, so therefore even if it was deliberately made to reference the elements of Ooo (it wasn't) it's a putrid failure and should have never been done in the first place (again, it wasn't) because including those colors accomplishes absolutely nothing in regards to literary narrative or foreshadowing.  I'm almost tempted to go find random scenes that feature those four colors to make more fun of this absurdity but I don't have that much time to waste (but I do have some, don't get me wrong)."
adventuretime,3a0cyl,Uncivilized_Elk,-4,Tue Jun 16 21:23:56 2015 UTC,"And the Bible predicted 9/11.  It's a bunch of vague words that sound fun; the message is about as vague as you can possibly get. It can be applied to any and all struggles.  So no, it's not. It always has and always will continue to make the same amount of sense (hence the tomorrow and yesterday! No, not hence that, I'm just being a dillweed in performing an ""analysis"" to show how ridiculous it is to treat scenes this way with no regard for the validity of foreshadowing).  Why don't you go out of your way to make bad interpretations about the squirrel, pidgeon, and Oreos while you're at it. Yup... this is definitely the off-season."
adventuretime,3a0cyl,Uncivilized_Elk,5,Tue Jun 16 21:16:42 2015 UTC,"Did that guy kick your dog or something?   Maybe you should go out of your way a little less often. Was all of that really necessary? It's a children's show, that some adults enjoy by finding subtle hints of deeper meaning every once and a while. Take it easy."
adventuretime,3a0cyl,shanesanity,0,Tue Jun 16 21:40:11 2015 UTC,"He did indeed abuse my dog. He laughed while he did it.  Edit: Granted, I could word myself like I'm talking to a child, but just because I disagree with a presented claim and type out that disagreement doesn't mean I'm not calm and taking it easy. Hell, I'm eating bagels slathered in cream cheese while typing these replies. I'm taking it pretty darn easy if you ask me.   Edit 2: If it makes you feel any better, I already said all I have to say on the topic and won't be adding more to it. But I'm not sure why it's so terrible that some of the subtle hints of deeper meaning you (in a collective sense) try to find can be wrong and silly, because everybody can make mistakes and we all do, all the time. If I make a topic about how Finn's blue clothes are a metaphor for his feelings on being abandoned as a child, I expect to get flack for it. And if I make a thread about a hypothesis I actually think is plausible, I do want people who disagree to try their best to tear it apart and show me why it's not if they think it's not."
